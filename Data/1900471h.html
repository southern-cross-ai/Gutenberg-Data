<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<p class="first">"I THINK I'll go on up to Riverview." Chief
Inspector Pointer, one of the Big Five of New Scotland Yard, laid
down the report which he was reading. "Yes, I think I'd like to
see the house where yesterday the mistress was found shot, the
companion seems to've been endowed with second sight, and where a
caller apparently dissolved into air."</p>

<p>Superintendent Haviland stared at him blankly, and then around
his own Twickenham police station.</p>

<p>"The coroner's verdict was 'Death by misadventure," he said
finally, glancing at the clock as though to assure himself that
that was only half an hour ago. "Of course, as I was just saying
to Mr. Wilmot here, the verdict's all wrong, but it was the only
possible one according to the witnesses. Perhaps it's just as
well. It sounds better than 'suicide,' for the relatives."</p>

<p>They were talking of the death of Mrs. Tangye who had been
found, yesterday afternoon, sitting dead beside her tea-table,
with a service-revolver lying on the floor beside her, and a
bullet from it through her heart. The Webley was a souvenir of
her days as an officer in the Waacs during the last year of the
war, and was kept on a bracket in the room. Her husband had
explained to the Coroner that his wife had recently spoken of
having her initials engraved on it. He suggested that she must
have been looking it over with that in her mind when she had met
with her fatal accident. The Coroner thought this sounded highly
probable. There was no question at the inquest, or before it, of
foul play. To say that there was no sign of a struggle, hardly
did justice to the ordered neatness of the room and the dead
woman. She wore at neck and wrist fine lace frills which would
have torn at a touch. The very material of her new gray velvet
frock was as spotless and smooth as when she had slipped into it
after lunch. The bullet fitted the revolver. The only finger-prints on the butt were those of the dead woman. Apart from these
facts, Mrs. Tangye was the last person to sit tamely in a chair
and let any one press a weapon against her breast, as the
blackened frock, as well as the autopsy, showed must have been
done. She was a good shot. She had once in France put a bullet
through a drunken Annamite's foot with most unrattled
precision.</p>

<p>The chair on which she was found was a fragile, gilt affair
which she favoured for making tea. Any struggle, and over it
would have gone. It was not so much as scratched. Behind her
stood a none too firmly placed electric stand-lamp. It too would
have crashed very easily. On the table beside her lay a china
bell-push. The bell was in perfect order, and had not been
rung.</p>

<p>Nothing was reported missing. Her purse lay in her handbag
with over five pounds in it on a chair in the room. The French
windows were said to have been found locked from the inside. The
servants were certain that no one could have entered the house
unnoticed between four, the hour when Florence, the parlour-maid,
had brought in the tea-things and seen her mistress alive, and
six, when she had made the terrible discovery.</p>

<p>No sound of a shot had been heard, and yet the revolver bore
no marks of a silencer. It was thought that it must have gone off
when some noisy vehicle was passing.</p>

<p>All the friends of Mrs. Tangye with whom the police had been
able to get into touch agreed that she had seemed in the best of
spirits, and that the suicide was out of the question.</p>

<p>She was thirty-five, and even the gossipy circle could not
hint at any entanglement on her part.</p>

<p>Yet Haviland, the Twickenham police Superintendent, did
believe that it had been a case of suicide. For on the day before
her death Mrs. Tangye had sent off a large trunk of clothes to
the Salvation Army leaving out for herself only the garment she
was wearing. And yesterday, the fatal day, she had spent some
hours destroying all her private papers.</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean, Pointer?" Wilmot, the third man,
asked curiously. "I've seldom listened to duller evidence. But I
suppose I'm prejudiced. Naturally, as a newspaper man, I had
hoped for something more worth while, more&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door flew open. A young man dashed in. Nodded to Wilmot
and Haviland. Shot a discreet glance at Pointer. Seated himself
in front of a battered typewriter in one corner, and began a
spirited imitation of a machine-gun in action.</p>

<p>Pointer looked at him.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant glance, and Newnes was one of the youngest
reporters on the Staff of the <i>Daily Courier,</i> but he
interpreted it correctly.</p>

<p>"Let me see to-morrow's sun rise!" he pleaded. "I was the
first person called in by Mrs. Tangye's maid, you know. And this
is my last will and testament concerning her. You needn't caution
me to print nothing without permission. I'm more than discreet.
I'm dull."</p>

<p>The men laughed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you wouldn't mind telling your story again. I wasn't
at the inquest." Pointer settled himself in a chair.</p>

<p>Newnes, like all his craft, minded nothing but exclusion. He
began at once:</p>

<p>"Yesterday afternoon, about six, I had just strolled over
Richmond Bridge, when a maid rushed out of one of the big houses
screaming, 'A doctor! Help! Help! She's dead!'</p>

<p>"Behind her in the doorway stood another woman, who called to
the first to 'Come back, Florence! Come back at once!'</p>

<p>"I thought if 'she' was dead, I couldn't do much harm. So I
said 'Hold on. I'm half a doctor. Let's see what's wrong.'</p>

<p>"'She's killed herself. Oh, she's dead! Come in and see what
you can do for her, sir. Oh, the poor mistress!'</p>

<p>"I took her by the arm and walked her back to the door again,
where the other woman, who turned out to be Mrs. Tangye's
companion, was still standing. I explained that I had been a
medical student (I didn't add that it was only for two months)
and that perhaps I could do as well as anybody. 'Quite as well.'
She said as coolly as you please: 'There's been an accident. Mrs.
Tangye has shot herself. I think no one ought to go in till I've
telephoned to the police. Better give that hysterical girl
something to quiet her meanwhile.'</p>

<p>"I pointed out that as she and the maid had both been in the
room, I might be permitted a look at the lady. Possibly something
could be done of after all. She nodded towards a door. I opened
it, and stepped in. I heard her ring up the police station as I
did so. There, beside a tea-table in a deep recess, sat a
handsome, well-dressed woman with her head sunk on her breast.
She looked about thirty. She was quite dead. Her cheek, which I
took care to do no more than touch, was icy. A revolver..." He
proceeded to describe what he had seen:</p>

<p>"While I was making my notes, the Superintendent arrived.
He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Many thanks." Pointer held out his hand. "If anything turns
up that the papers can be usefully told, you shall have the first
hint. And now&mdash;sorry, you know, but police-routine&mdash;"</p>

<p>Newnes made no protest. In a large town, a man is a reporter,
not by the grace of God, but of the police.</p>

<p>Wilmot came under quite another heading. His discretion, like
his position, was not a mere promise, but a well established
fact. For several years, he and his articles had been the helpers
of the law. For Wilmot was that much abused definition, a
criminologist. And a great one.</p>

<p>"The ploughman homewards plods his weary way." He watched from
the window Newnes' reluctant turning of the corner. "And now, may
merely mortal man inquire what has brought one of the Big Four of
the New Scotland Yard upon the scene?"</p>

<p>Pointer drew out his pipe. "When there's anything odd about
the actions of three people connected with a case in town which
ends in a death, or rather begins in one, some man from the Yard
is sure to drop in sooner or later. Merely as a matter of
routine."</p>

<p>"Odd about <i>three</i> people, sir?" Haviland repeated
aghast.</p>

<p>"Let me see," Wilmot murmured. He loved riddles. "There's Mrs.
Tangye for one of course. She didn't shoot herself every day to
be sure. But the other two?"</p>

<p>"There's her companion," Pointer said tranquilly.</p>

<p>"Whom you credit with occult powers. A fashionable but quite
unexpected attitude."</p>

<p>"How else was this Miss Saunders able to tell so quickly, and
so certainly that her employer was dead?" The Chief Inspector
filled his pipe, while Haviland listened spellbound. "As the
evidence stands, Miss Saunders says that she had barely got back,
and was taking off her things in her room upstairs when she heard
the maid call out. That, mind you, is the first sign she had that
anything was wrong in the house. Now, the parlour-maid says that
after one shriek&mdash;when she found her mistress sitting cold
and still in her chair&mdash;she darted from the house in a blind
panic. Your Mr. Newnes, who strikes me as an accurate observer,
and is, of course, trained to notice carefully, says that he saw
Miss Saunders standing in the doorway&mdash;already certain, that
Mrs. Tangye is dead&mdash;when the maid rushes towards him. The
maid screams for help. She's natural, however incoherent. The
companion composedly tells him there's nothing to be done. If she
really only came out of her room when she heard the girl below,
it's not easy to understand how she could have been so positive,
from one hurried glance, that Mrs. Tangye was past all aid. It
looks as though she knows more than we do, about the whole
affair. As if, supposing her to have been out at all, she had
gone into the room where Mrs. Tangye was, immediately on her
return, and found her dead, before going on upstairs."</p>

<p>"What! Without saying a word to any one!" Superintendent
Haviland was a married man. Pointer was not. The police officer
thought that this was a bachelor's idea of feminine powers.</p>

<p>"And the visitor who vanished into thin air," Haviland went
on, "do you mean Mrs. Cranbourn, sir, for your third person? The
lady whose coming at six led to the discovery of the body?"</p>

<p>"Just so. Mrs. Cranbourn. But for her having been
expected&mdash;that point only came out just now at the
inquest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, sir. As a matter of fact I mentioned her name here, in
the report I sent in last night." Haviland bent over the
sheets.</p>

<p>"It's not the visitor's name. It's the fact that she was
<i>expected.</i> Known to be coming..."</p>

<p>"Coming by a boat-train," Pointer spoke slowly, with a curious
look in his eyes, "so the parlour-maid says she was told by her
mistress. No boat-train could get in in time enough to let Mrs.
Cranbourn have four o'clock tea with Mrs. Tangye at Riverview.
Then why was it ordered at four? And Florence was not to bother
to come in again until Mrs. Cranbourn should come." Pointer
looked down at his boot-tips meditatively.</p>

<p>"Getting into touch with Mrs. Cranbourn should clear up many
difficulties! But even as it is, what became of her?"</p>

<p>"Florence&mdash;that's the parlourmaid&mdash;thinks she
hurried off without waiting, when she saw what had happened.
Natural enough under the circumstances." Haviland spoke rather
stubbornly.</p>

<p>"But where to? Which way did she go? Straight on up to Heaven?
Remember, Newnes saw only the running maid, the standing Miss
Saunders, and no one else. You arrived before he left, and found
no sign of her."</p>

<p>"When you put it like that, it sounds odd, for a fact."
Haviland bit his lip.</p>

<p>The caller had not been seen since. It was believed that she
must have slipped away in the general confusion. The Coroner,
though he regretted her absence, did not think that her evidence
would have been of more use than that of the numerous other
friends available. For she had not found Mrs. Tangye alive. Mrs.
Cranbourn was a barrister's widow, living in Malaga, and was
unknown to the maid by sight. The police had had a cable from the
consul there, saying that the lady had left the town a week
ago.</p>

<p>"Her visit seems a big trump in Tangye's hand&mdash;it
certainly points to accident rather than suicide," Wilmot
murmured.</p>

<p>Haviland grunted, non-committally.</p>

<p>"Why don't you believe Mrs. Tangye's death an accident,
Haviland?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"How could it have been one, sir? Apart from the fact of the
trigger working uncommon stiff, the safety-bolt acts perfectly,
and Mrs. Tangye was used to that particular revolver. Then look
at the tearing up of her papers, and the packing off of her
duds."</p>

<p>"Tangye explained that, you know," Wilmot reminded him.</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Tangye wasn't going abroad for Another month. And
why not leave her papers? To my mind, her desk and her wardrobe
were as good as a signed confession that she had made away with
herself."</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>"Personally my belief hasn't been changed by the verdict,"
Haviland murmured after a pause, "though it ends the case as far
as we are concerned."</p>

<p>"Unless, of course you, sir&mdash;" he turned to Pointer and
left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>"Any special reason you know of which isn't given in the
reports for her to've killed herself?" was his only answer.</p>

<p>"Well, there's Mrs. Bligh. She's just left for Cannes this
morning. Colonel's widow. Lives in Cadogan Square. Belongs to a
very smart set. She and Mr. Tangye..." Haviland's tone was full
of meaning. "The fact is, though there's nothing to prove it, I
think Mrs. Tangye got wind of the affair, and got fed up. Lost
her grip of things, and decided to end it all."</p>

<p>"If every woman whose husband goes off the rails at times were
to shoot herself, the surplus of females over males in the
British Isles would soon be a thing of the past," Wilmot pointed
out dryly. Haviland grinned, but stuck to his guns.</p>

<p>"I don't pretend I mayn't be wrong. As a matter of fact, I've
got two headings in my notebook, same as you say you have in your
head, Mr. Wilmot, and I enter things accordingly. Most of 'em, so
far, go on both pages. I can't think you'll want me to add
another headline, sir."</p>

<p>Haviland finished with his eyes on Pointer. The Chief
Inspector was skimming through the life story of the dead
woman.</p>

<p>"Mable Headly. Only child of the Rev. Charles Headly, rector
of Over Wallop for twenty years, and Nether Wallop for thirty,"
he read out.</p>

<p>"Sounds peaceful!" murmured Wilmot. Haviland took up the
tale:</p>

<p>"Miss Headly taught at the Holland Park High School till war
broke out. Then went to France as an officer in the Waacs. She
married Clive Branscombe, the architect. He built the Chelsea war
memorial, I think?"</p>

<p>Haviland turned to Wilmot.</p>

<p>"May he rest in peace, in spite of that and other crimes of a
like nature," breathed the newspaper man.</p>

<p>"They lived in Cheyne Walk for some five years. A year after
he died, she married Tangye. That was three years ago now."</p>

<p>"Any children?"</p>

<p>"None all round, sir," was the comprehensive reply. There
followed another short silence.</p>

<p>"Only one will known," Pointer mused aloud, "leaving
everything to her husband. Made on her marriage to him. Contents
familiar to every one. How much did she have to leave?"</p>

<p>"She had nothing when she married Branscombe, but he left her
ten thousand in cash, which she promptly invested in Tangye's
firm. There's a belief in some quarters in fact, that that was
why he married her. The sum came in very handy just then, they do
say. And besides that ten, she had some nice bits of property
here and there in Worcestershire that were rated for death duties
at another ten thousand. Of course, I don't know how much of the
land she's sold. You see, she'd destroyed all her memos."</p>

<p>Pointer stood up.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see the revolver."</p>

<p>Haviland brought it from the safe. It would have to be
returned within an hour or two to Tangye anyway, he thought.
Pointer lifted out the weapon on its slung carrier, puffed some
bright coloured powder over it, and blowing gently, studied the
result intently with his glass.</p>

<p>"Seems to've taken the marks of her grip very well."</p>

<p>"It has for a fact. The poor soul had been having buttered
crumpets for tea."</p>

<p>"Have the Tangye's a dog?"</p>

<p>"No, sir." Haviland looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Is there a cat in the house?"</p>

<p>"No, sir." Haviland wondered how many more animals would be
suggested, but he looked with wrinkled brows at Pointer.</p>

<p>"Those scratches seem recent. What made them?"</p>

<p>"Tangye thinks they must have happened in France. The revolver
was always kept in its box at Riverview. You'll notice her
fingerprints are over the scratches, so the latter can't mean
anything, sir."</p>

<p>Pointer noticed more than that. He gave the weapon another
long look before he straightened up.</p>

<p>"I should like the usual photographs and enlargements of that
made at once, please." Then the Chief Inspector turned away.
"It's a problem!" he said, studying his boot tips.</p>

<p>"You mean the explanation as to whether it was suicide or
accident? I can't make up my own mind definitely." Wilmot spoke
in a surprised tone. It was true that he was not often afflicted
with doubt.</p>

<p>"No. I mean the explanation of the facts."</p>

<p>Haviland pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, even the fact, which had first seemed puzzling,
that, though Mrs. Tangye was considered right-handed like most of
the world, the weapon lay beneath her left hand, and carries its
finger-prints, was explained by an old friend. Mrs. Tangye had
been left-handed in her girlhood, and though she had trained
herself out of the habit, yet in moments of great excitement she
was liable to 'revert.' Inquiries made in her father's
parish&mdash;he's been dead these fifteen years
nearly&mdash;corroborated this. To my mind, there's no question
but that it was either suicide or accident. Judging by the facts,
that is."</p>

<p>Superintendent Haviland always judged by what he considered
facts. And by them alone. "Those finger-prints on her revolver,
sir. They're Mrs. Tangye's right enough. It isn't as if there
were any reason to suspect they're faked. They're uncommonly
clear ones."</p>

<p>"They're uncommon from more points of view than one," the
Chief Inspector murmured, with that air of detachment that was so
marked a characteristic of his, and so deceptive.</p>

<p>"What in the world are you driving at, Pointer?" Wilmot asked
curiously. "Quite apart from her finger-prints, foul play seems
an absolute impossibility. Surely no woman would have sat still
and let herself be shot down like a mad dog, without a struggle.
Without ringing that bell beneath her very fingers!"</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, sir,"&mdash;Haviland was so bewildered
that he had some difficulty in finding his voice,&mdash;"I very
carefully looked even at the cushion on which her feet were
resting. I photographed it specially, though it doesn't come out
well. Those marks on it could only have been made by a pair of
resting feet. She hadn't pressed them in, or tried to rise. Her
slippers were a bit dampish from that stroll in the garden which
she'd taken just before tea. Yet they hadn't done more than dust
the velvet with sand, as you might say."</p>

<p>"How does the woman's death strike you, Wilmot?" Pointer asked
abruptly. He was a great admirer of the newspaper man's
articles.</p>

<p>"Like Haviland, I think, on the whole, that it was suicide.
Though since hearing the evidence just now, I shouldn't be amazed
if the husband were right, and it turned out an accident.
Certainly the effect of tranquillity in Mrs. Tangye's face and
pose struck me very much when I was taken to see her yesterday. I
think it was more marked in reality than it is in the photographs
of the scene. What intrigues me most in the case, I confess, is
that Chief Inspector Pointer should have thought it worth his
while to come down about it."</p>

<p>Haviland wondered too.</p>

<p>Pointer did not explain.</p>

<p>"As I said, I'll go on up to Riverview with you, after lunch,
Superintendent, if that time will suit you. I want to ask a few
questions. The answers may clear up some of the items that puzzle
me."</p>

<p>"You interest me tremendously, Pointer. By Jove, you <i>do</i>
interest me!" Wilmot was not flattering the other. He really was
glad now that Newnes had caught him&mdash;Wilmot&mdash;yesterday.
The whole affair was exceptional as far as he was concerned.
Newnes had dragged him out of the evening boat-train at Victoria,
where he had been on the point of dashing across the Narrows with
three other newspaper men of his own standing to investigate a
rumour. A rumour which had only reached well-informed circles as
yet, and which very guardedly hinted at regicide. It came from a
state where such incidents do occasionally lend a mediaeval touch
to court life. The special correspondents were all keen as so
many unhooded falcons, but Newnes, breathless, dashing up with
the effect of long legs floating behind him, had seized Wilmot by
the arm.</p>

<p>"Couldn't find
you&mdash;wanted&mdash;stay&mdash;Vibart&mdash;letter." He
gasped. While well-meaning porters draped themselves hastily upon
him.</p>

<p>Wilmot, snatching up a bag from between his feet, had sprung
out as the wheels began to turn. The two other men were half
inclined to follow. If the great Wilmot found it well to stay,
where lay the point of their going on? But they thought better of
it. Even newspaper men may once in their lives, have relations.
It was possible that W. W. had been fetched home for some
overwhelming family disaster.</p>

<p>Newnes had handed the man beside him a letter. Tearing it
open, Wilmot&mdash;in a vile temper&mdash;for he had had to make
a dash to catch that train, had read:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Wilmot</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">Rumour unfounded. H.M. was merely having a
private week-end. Want you to ring me up on the 'phone
immediately.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Vibart</span>.</p>

<p><br>
Within five minutes Wilmot was connected with his temporary
Chief, editor and permanent friend, Lord Vibart, the owner of the
<i>Daily Courier.</i> To him the other spake winged words. Since
the affair which Wilmot had been commissioned to undertake had
fizzled out, Vibart had another suggestion to make. It seemed
that the <i>Courier's</i> youngest reporter had just had a stroke
of beginner's luck by being the first outsider to find a Mrs.
Tangye, wife of a member of a well-known county family, sitting
dead beside her afternoon tea-table. The police thought it was
suicide. Would Wilmot take a look at the case, and send along one
of his special articles.</p>

<p>"Of course, I quite understand, my dear chap, that you're
above any suicides except royal ones," Vibart said dryly
(Wilmot's high opinion of himself was well known) "but I
particularly want the spot light to play on Twickenham just
now."</p>

<p>Wilmot knew that, and knew why. Vibart was backing a new
helicopter, and the trials were to be staged there next month.
But he failed to see why he should alter his plans for the sake
of the other's pocket.</p>

<p>"It's not in my line," he said unyieldingly. Nor was it.
Outside of the realms of politics, murders, difficult and
involved, were Wilmot's province. He had no superior in laying
bare the psychology of the criminal. And he did it, not with the
scalpel, but with the pitying touch of one who saw something
beautiful dragged through the mire, something fine blunted. No
man living could surpass him in investing the most sordid crime
with a touch of the Inner, of the Noble. He was a master in the
art of suggestion. Like some marvellous chemist Wilmot could
extract 'atmosphere' from a poker and a bottle of stout.</p>

<p>"Anything's in your line, if you'll undertake it," Vibart said
placatingly. "Look here, there's no other chap can handle it as
you can. Stir up the public to run a special bus out to see the
house where it happened."</p>

<p>Vibart had the soul of a tradesman.</p>

<p>"But the arrangements for my holiday are already made," Wilmot
protested truthfully enough. As the other affair had fallen
through, he did not see why he should not put the clock forward.
In fancy he was already basking in a green, sunny nook between
Lequectico and San Sebastian, where little black pigs curled
their tails in the orchards, and the trout were only waiting to
rise to anything with blue Andalusian cock-hackles on it.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear chap, forgive the remark, but he who pays the
piper&mdash;you know. You stood out for a pirate's ransom before
you promised to go to Gretonia. I think we must get our money
back somehow. I don't see you returning that cheque." Vibart
thought plain-speaking might avail.</p>

<p>It did. Wilmot capitulated. He had gone out with Newnes to
Twickenham. To the handsome old house near Richmond Bridge, had
sent in an article of "The Hollowness of the Solid," which was a
little masterpiece in its own <i>morne</i> line, and was prepared
to send in one last, on the blood-lust that crowds inquests.
Neither article was in the least what Vibart wanted, but Wilmot
was apt to take his own line.</p>

<p>Haviland turned away from the safe.</p>

<p>"I've finished now, sir. But I can take you up to Riverview
after lunch if that would suit you better."</p>

<p>Wilmot reached for his hat. "I'm off for my deferred holiday
in Spain." He spoke with an anticipatory smile. "Otherwise I
should have enjoyed hearing how it all flattened out into a most
ordinary affair."</p>

<p>"Why not wait a day or two," Haviland urged, "it won't take
long either way. I mean, until we find out for certain. The
Tangyes like the Branscombes had lived here, or near here, all
their lives. We know all about them."</p>

<p>"That's why I'm off," Wilmot tossed a match away. "People whom
you know all about, Haviland, aren't in my line at all."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it, Superintendent, and waste a fond
farewell." Pointer scoffed: "We shall see Mr. Wilmot again at
Riverview this afternoon, depend on it. And very welcome you'll
be," he finished, turning to the newspaper man. "You, and any
help you can give us."</p>

<p>"Help? What in?" Wilmot opened his eyes till they looked like
round marbles. "Oh&mdash;you mean in putting the room to rights
after you've had the carpet up, and the wallpaper down, and taken
the furniture to pieces. I know your airy methods. But possibly I
may drop in on my way to the boat-train for the last time.
Possibly I may."</p>

<p>"Very possibly," Pointer agreed. Wilmot, with an answering
smile, walked briskly down the steps of the police station.</p>

<p>A hand touched his shoulder, it was Cheale, a solicitor, and
the claims investigator to the Company in which the dead woman
had been insured.</p>

<p>"I've been combing the streets for you since I lost you after
the inquest. Come and have lunch with me."</p>

<p>"This is Twickenham," Wilmot pointed out sadly, "yonder is
Bushey Park. Do people lunch hereabouts? If so, prithee where? In
Richmond tea-gardens?"</p>

<p>"They take a seat in a friend's car," Cheale steered him
towards it, "and let themselves be whirled away to
Picadilly."</p>

<p>"Cold grouse? Moselle?" Wilmot bargained, his foot on the
step.</p>

<p>"We'll split a bird and a bottle," Cheale answered handsomely.
Like the car the lunch was his Company's.</p>

<p>He chose a safe corner, and in guarded voices they discussed
the inquest.</p>

<p>"It's a clear and simple case of suicide," Cheale began.
"Clear and simple!" repeated Wilmot. "Is anything ever quite
limpid?"</p>

<p>"You think it's suicide," Cheale looked at him with certainty.
"What about your article in to-day's <i>Courier?"</i></p>

<p>Wilmot met his gaze with a faint, deprecatory smile. "I'm a
newspaper man. When it's a case of two alternatives I naturally
choose the more spectacular, or the more dramatic. Whichever word
you prefer."</p>

<p>"But speaking as man to man?"</p>

<p>"There you go again," complained Wilmot. The two were old
friends. "As what man to what man? As a journalist to the
consultant of an insurance company that bars suicides from
payments, of course I back suicide. If I were Tangye's friend,
and speaking to him, I should equally agree with him as to his
wife's death being undoubtedly an accident."</p>

<p>"Turncoat!" the other muttered reproachfully.
"Backslider!"</p>

<p>"I'm a broken reed," Wilmot confessed. "Don't lean on me. I
change sides as often as a Chinese regiment&mdash;or a lateen
sail.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

"Singing with the wind;<br>

Veering with the current."</p>

<br>

<p>Cheale looked pointedly at the grouse, the wine, and then at
the man opposite him. Wilmot and he laughed.</p>

<p>"Our directors read that article of yours this morning. They
want you to investigate this case for us, if you will. For, as
you say, we have a suicide clause in all our policies. Of course
the Company doesn't want to contest an honest claim, as you know
well. Not that I mean that Tangye would put forward a dishonest
one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you think so!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no. I wouldn't go as far as that, either. Other
people too can sit on both sides of the fence. But Tangye struck
me as over-keen this morning in the court-room about the death
being an accident. Ram it down your throat&mdash;dare-you-to-disbelieve-it tone and manner, that I thought a little odd.
Though he looks a bit of a blusterer. Also the evidence itself
seems to me to point as much to suicide as to a slip. But I must
go over to Dublin at once on a complicated investigation that may
need time. Will you take the case on? Prove for us that Mrs.
Tangye's death, was, what I believe it was, a suicide?"</p>

<p>"How do you prove a suicide?" Wilmot asked captiously. He was
known to his conferes as Wilful Willie. "Isn't it rather like
proving something to be a ghost? I can see how you prove a
murder, but a negative?"</p>

<p>He inhaled the bouquet of the wine. Fragrant. Hinting at far-off violets.</p>

<p>"Yet, quibbling apart, you think it's one? Come, out with the
truth! You were better than the best detective in the Brice
Revenue Frauds. And in the Tomkins murder, you were right again
as to where the murderer would be found. I heard that you
prophesied before any one else how the Palking diamond theft
would turn out."</p>

<p>"Some song, Caedmon!" Wilmot murmured approvingly, with closed
eyes and a fatuous smile. "Sing on, Minstrel! Sing on the Works
of Wilmot the Wonder. The Wizardly Winner!"</p>

<p>Cheale took no notice.</p>

<p>"Well then," the Special Correspondent laid aside his chaff.
"To my mind, on the evidence as so far known, I&mdash;the
veritable I&mdash;hover between a suicide and an accident. Now
inclining strongly to the one, now to the other conviction. When
did Mrs. Tangye insure with you?"</p>

<p>"She and her husband both took out policies in favour of each
other, instead of settlements, when they married."</p>

<p>"Big ones?"</p>

<p>"Ten thousand pounds apiece."</p>

<p>Wilmot pursed his lips.</p>

<p>"Who pays the premiums?"</p>

<p>"Tangye pays both according to the agreement."</p>

<p>"Supposed to be fairly well-to-do, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Used to be. Very much so. But the firm has never recovered
from that Mesopotamian crash in oils just before he married. And
we happen to have private information, that a big Irish broker
with whom he has large commitments, won't be able to weather
settlement. That's day after to-morrow. Hit by the fall in the
franc. If so, Tangye too, may have to go under. I shall be able
to get more definite information tomorrow on the spot. Now,
what's your answer? Will you look into the case for us? Sift any
claims that Tangye may make? As I told you, he's already
thundering for the insurance money."</p>

<p>"The river always gives me rheumatism," objected Wilmot.</p>

<p>The other mentioned what sounded like an excellent plaster in
Bank of England notes, and Wilmot did not consider himself a
wealthy man.</p>

<p>"You'll take your own line, of course." Cheale lit a
cigarette. "Had it been any one but you, I intended to suggest
looking up Mrs. Tangye's past as a first step."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tangye's past! Mr. Tangye's present is very much more to
the point, believe me, if you hope to prove a suicide."</p>

<p>"That's our platform obviously. The idea of domestic trouble.
But you haven't given me an answer yet. Will you take the case on
for us?"</p>

<p>"For the truth&mdash;yes," Wilmot corrected him quickly. And
to do Mr. Cheale and his Company justice, that was what he
wanted. They settled it at that. Cheale went into
particulars.</p>

<p>His lunch over, Wilmot telephoned his new interest in the case
to the Chiswick Police Superintendent, who was just finishing a
modest midday meal with the Chief Inspector. Pointer in
particular welcomed the news most cordially, for, as he explained
to Wilmot, it would greatly help his own inquiries.</p>

<p>"If you'll slip me in under your cloak, and let me ask some
questions ostensibly to help you make up your mind I'll be
greatly obliged. Otherwise, I should be rather put to it to get
the information I need, without arousing suspicion that suspicion
was aroused."</p>

<p>As Wilmot taxied out to the two officers, he ran over in his
mind the questions he wanted to put. He had not troubled to do so
before. Wilmot was not a detective. He had carefully abstained
from probing the Hinterland of the Tangye's married life
yesterday. All he had sought then was sufficient material for his
dreamy, gloomy sketch of the quicksands under the smiling
ripple.</p>

<p>Arrived at the station, he hastily skimmed through Haviland's
report.</p>

<p>Besides the servants, the household at Riverview only
consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Tangye, and Miss Saunders, the
companion. It was Miss Saunders who, after telephoning to the
police, had rung up Mr. Tangye's offices in the city. The head
clerk, who took the message, told her that Mr. Tangye had already
started for home. He had reached Riverview in a quarter of an
hour to be met by the sympathetic Superintendent with the news of
the tragedy.</p>

<p>Questioned about the way in which the rest of the day had been
spent by Mrs. Tangye, the maids had had nothing out of the way to
report. Nor did the diary which the police had reconstructed with
great care of the days before yesterday, the fateful Tuesday,
show anything noteworthy.</p>

<p>On Saturday the husband had gone off for a week-end in the
country. Mrs. Tangye often shared these, but this time it was a
man's shooting party in Norfolk, and she had remained at home. On
Sunday morning, however, she had telephoned to a local garage for
a car, and had driven down to an orchid-show which was being held
at Tunbridge Wells. She had left home in the car about twelve in
the morning, after arranging over the telephone to lunch with a
friend in that town. The telephone messages sounded as though
both ideas had been suddenly taken. Mrs. Tangye had let her three
servants go off duty until six. Returning at that hour, Florence
found her mistress had just got back with a headache, and wished
dinner cancelled. Next day, Mrs. Tangye had seemed quite herself
again.</p>

<p>Most of the morning she had spent at the hair-dresser's. In
the early afternoon she had sent Florence, who acted more or less
as her maid, with a note to Jay's. It concerned an evening frock
which they were making for the woman who was not to live to wear
it.</p>

<p>As he read the note aloud which Florence had taken to the firm
in question, the Coroner had agreed with the husband that it did
not sound as though Mrs. Tangye were weary of life. She had asked
for something younger-looking in the way of trimmings to be sent
her for selection.</p>

<p>Florence had got back by five, in time to serve tea as usual.
Mr. Tangye had returned by then from his week-end. He had only
stayed a short time before returning to his office on some very
pressing business, which Mrs. Tangye had told Florence would
detain him in London overnight, and possibly for a few days.</p>

<p>The husband explained that the business in town which had
taken him away on this last, complete, day of his wife's life,
was only an accumulation of letters. There was nothing whatever
in the nature of business worries to call him from home.</p>

<p>In the additional notes which the Chief Inspector put at his
command, Wilmot learnt a few other items about the husband.
Pointer was known to keep his papers always up to time, with
suggested work blocked in, and to lock them daily in his safe at
Scotland Yard, so that should anything happen to him, the case
would not be hampered.</p>

<p>Wilmot read that the firm of Latimer and Tangye was one of the
most respected on the London Stock Exchange, and though it had
suffered severe losses a couple of years back, yet, by moving
from an expensive house in Chelsea to Riverview, and cutting down
their household to its present modest proportions, the Tangyes
seemed to lead a very comfortable, care-free existence.</p>

<p>Latimer was long dead. Tangye was in sole command.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<p class="first">THE afternoon was very still with the misty
stillness of a day in late November. To Wilmot, the Thames,
running so softly beside them as they walked up from the police-station, seemed like the river of life. Enigmatic. Uncertain.
Never the same for more than a minute. Now an unbroken stretch of
shadows leaden and hopeless. Now a fairy stream, all silver and
glitter.</p>

<p>Much hung on their errand. One word from the tall young man
swinging ahead in front, and some life now at ease would become a
hunted thing. Wanted by the police. The life itself wanted.
Forfeit to law. It must be a strange feeling. He had sometimes
thought that criminals enjoyed their peril with an awful joy. The
exultation of wit pitted against wit. But would that word be
spoken here? The Special Correspondent had found nothing
yesterday to justify it. He was looking forward keenly to seeing
the Chief Inspector at work.</p>

<p>Wilmot had never been accused of a lack of belief in his own
very considerable powers. It was therefore, perhaps,
characteristic that the possibility of a man entering a room with
him, or after him, looking it over, and discovering clues where
he could see absolutely nothing, should seem to him a marvellous
feat. He remembered Pointer's words about the dead woman's
finger-prints on her revolver. Uncommon in more ways than one,
the Scotland Yard expert called them. Yet they had looked all
right to Haviland. And they had looked all right to him. They
were Mrs. Tangye's without a doubt. What then was odd about
them?</p>

<p>Wilmot had never been of the French school which ranks
reasoning higher than observation. To him, the bushman's gift of
reading a spoor was one of the most entertaining exercises of
intelligence still left to a humdrum world.</p>

<p>Twickenham has some fine old houses. Riverview was one of
these. Wilmot, looking up at it, thought, as he had thought
yesterday when Newnes had taken him to it, that a less likely
setting for a tragedy it were difficult to imagine. Every brick
spoke of security. Of comfort. Of calm. The garden that
surrounded it was an overcrowded, cluttered-up affair where one
acre had been made to carry the trees, and shrubberies, and
herbaceous borders of three.</p>

<p>Florence, the parlourmaid, opened the door. A constable who
had followed took up an unostentatious seat in the hall. Pointer
was never eavesdropped.</p>

<p>"Shall I show you to the room, sir?" Florence evidently
thought that the house held but the one. Haviland still had the
key in his pocket from the inquest. "Miss Saunders is out for the
moment, but she'll be back soon."</p>

<p>The three men stepped into a large room which had a little
windowless extension jutting out towards the river, forming a
snug, draught-proof retreat, where stood a tall lamp, a square
double-tiered tea-table, a couple of comfortable armchairs, and
the high, slender, little, occasional affair on which Mrs. Tangye
had been found seated.</p>

<p>The room itself opened into the garden by a couple of long
windows which fastened with a patent catch impossible to open
from the outside.</p>

<p>Wilmot looked about him with interest. He had not had time
before, or rather, his mind had been too occupied with other
things, to let him sense the atmosphere then. Gazing around him
now, he tried to reconstruct the dead woman's personality from
what he could see, as might a man fresh come, knowing nothing of
the tragedy. He was planning a little article on "Hidden Forces"
for one of his impressionist sketches.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant room. Dark brown, with covers and hangings
in vivid wall-flower tints ranging from red to clearest amber. It
was a comfortable room. Even the castors were well oiled.
Symbolic this last, Wilmot thought. Life too, for Mrs. Tangye had
evidently been well oiled. It was not in the least a subtle room.
Yet the dead woman had obviously cared for music, for, on the two
pianos the parts of Stravinsky's own reduction of his latest
concerto were still open.</p>

<p>Wilmot flicked the pages shut with a contemptuous finger,
murmuring something about "watered Bach." Then he seated himself
on a chair by the wall, and folding his arms, stared around him
inch by inch. He could see nothing, however small, that looked
even odd, let alone suspicious. Evidently neither could Haviland.
Though his eyes flew along the walls&mdash;the ceilings&mdash;the
windows&mdash;with the speed of a new fighting plane doing stunts
at a review. The gaze of both men came to a standstill on
Pointer, who was sauntering around the room with his swift,
unhurried, step.</p>

<p>He stopped at the tea-table first. On a used plate the handles
of a little gilt knife and fork detained him. Then he stooped to
the undershelf. Only one cup and plate showed signs of use.</p>

<p>"You found no finger-prints in the room, except those of the
people in the house?"</p>

<p>"Just so, sir."</p>

<p>"Those on the bolts of the French windows inside the room were
Miss Saunders's?"</p>

<p>Haviland nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Correct, sir. She says she tried them to make sure they were
fast. They were."</p>

<p>"She claims to've been away from the house changing a book for
Mrs. Tangye at the circulating library from four to nearly six.
How about it?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't verify it at the library itself, sir. But she was
seen in some tea-room close by about that time. I confess I
haven't tested her alibi, for her evidence seemed all
right&mdash;I mean, the case seemed quite straightforward, in
fact. I mean&mdash;" Haviland pulled up. What he really meant was
that he thought the case was not one that required investigations
of that kind.</p>

<p>Pointer had passed on to the fireplace, where Haviland had had
the ashes kept. Pointer picked up a newspaper and gently fanned
them.</p>

<p>"Only paper ashes. 'Mrs. Tangye seems to've burnt her letters
out on the hearth. Piece by piece. No marks of stirring on the
tiles. But what about the fire itself?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Must have been lit late. Just a couple of smouldering logs
were all I found, sir. I had them taken away, but the ashes
haven't been touched."</p>

<p>"Wasn't the room cold?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"Not to notice. At least...I had my great coat on..."</p>

<p>Haviland flushed. Had he overlooked something? But Pointer
turned away immediately.</p>

<p>"Now, Superintendent, you saw, when you first came in here
yesterday?"</p>

<p>Haviland was secretly impatient.</p>

<p>A lot of work was waiting for him back at his station. He had
been here on the day before, and had gone over the room very
thoroughly. A detective from the Yard had been here. The Coroner
had been here. It seemed hardly likely that any late corner could
find anything worth while, even if that late comer was the
youngest Chief Inspector at the Yard. Mrs. Tangye's death was
either suicide or accident, a quite ordinary affair. Merely
imperfectly docketed at the inquest. But he obediently explained
to his superior how the room had looked when he had entered
it.</p>

<p>"That clothing over there is what she was wearing when found,
I suppose?" he asked when Haviland had done.</p>

<p>"Correct, sir. I had them brought in here for the jury to look
at this morning." Top of all was the velvet frock with the powder
blackened breast, and the scorched hole.</p>

<p>"You can see, pressed into the pile, the very ring the
autoisnatic made." Haviland pointed to a little circle. "At
least, a part of it. Along this burnt bit here."</p>

<p>You could see a mark. But was it made by her revolver? It
looked a very thin line to Pointer.</p>

<p>He turned away, and seated himself at Mrs. Tangye's writing
bureau. Haviland watched him with the air of a man about to be
completely and entirely justified. He felt certain that he would
yet leave the room without a stain upon his official character.
He had found nothing amiss because there was nothing amiss to be
found.</p>

<p>"You say in your report, that, not finding her keys, you
opened the desk with a pass-key. How about it?" Pointer asked on
rising.</p>

<p>"They're mislaid somewhere. I only looked through this one
room for them of course."</p>

<p>Pointer made no comment, but asked to see the body. They found
Newnes in the upstairs room, putting the last touches to a
sketch. Pointer signed to him to finish.</p>

<p>"If she did it intentionally, I wonder if she's glad now or
sorry." Newnes hoped to start a little debate which would enable
him to slide into the official circle. No one answered.</p>

<p>"Has she changed her lot for the better?" he mused, with one
eye on Pointer.</p>

<p>"She certainly has for good," Wilmot said dryly, pulling up
the blind to its fullest extent.</p>

<p>Death is not the brother of sleep. Nor does it look it. Sleep
is active. As active as waking. The subconscious is in full
control. The work of repairing, rebuilding, is going on full
speed ahead. But death&mdash;for what lies before us, is the
actual end. Nothing now but a return to its component parts await
the wonderful machine which has been definitely scrapped by its
owner. To Wilmot indeed, all that there ever could be, or ever
had been, to Mable Tangye lay before them.</p>

<p>As for the two police officers, the point of greatest interest
for the moment was not why, but how.</p>

<p>Newnes took another reluctant departure. Then only did Pointer
go up to the coffin. He gazed very searchingly at the face
inside.</p>

<p>Suicide demands an unusual temperament. Pointer saw no signs
of it here. To him these were the last features to associate with
the voluntary pushing open of that door which we call death. Mrs.
Tangye looked a handsome, upstanding, hot-tempered, rather
selfish woman of around thirty. One who would put up a good fight
for all her possessions, including life. There was pluck in her
face, as well as resolution. He would expect this woman to have
found a way to cut her losses, supposing she had them, not allow
them to swamp her. Yet equally certainly she was a woman who
would not have gone against the accepted order of things.
Respectability was stamped on her. Conventionality engraved on
every line. Even around the corners of the mouth where, an
impulsive temper lurked as well.</p>

<p>Pointer studied her hands carefully.</p>

<p>"Come on anything, sir?" Haviland asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>"They have been washed, of course. But on her left hand under
her two wedding rings are traces, of what will prove to be
butter, I fancy&mdash;" He pushed a tiny wad of sterilised cotton
beneath them and then put it away in a corked bottle which he
swiftly labelled, "&mdash;as you'd expect from the greasiness of
her finger-prints on that revolver. That's why I asked about a
cat or a dog. I thought she might have been feeding one. Yet
apparently only a quarter of a crumpet was eaten, and that with a
knife and fork, on whose very smooth and polished handles she
left no finger-prints whatever. Odd!"</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you what I think is odd?" Wilmot, giving up all
idea of spectacular developments, lit a cigarette, and, as usual
prepared to take the centre of the stage. It was his favourite
stance.</p>

<p>"The oddest thing about this affair that I can see, is the
reason that made Miss Saunders have Miss Tangye's body put in
this shabby room at the end of the Corridor. Why not in her own
bedroom?"</p>

<p>"Because of Mr. Tangye, I suppose," Haviland suggested. He
liked commonplace explanations. He found them generally the right
ones.</p>

<p>"Why not shift him? There's a well-furnished spare-room nearer
the stairs. Why stick her away in this boxroom? It's little
more," the newspaper man insisted.</p>

<p>"Well, that's a fact," muttered Haviland, "that's a fact."</p>

<p>Pointer led the way downstairs. In the hall they met Tangye.
When he heard that Wilmot was acting for the Insurance Company,
his jaw tightened. After a second's pause, he asked all three
into his study which was opposite the room where the tragedy had
occurred.</p>

<p>The stockbroker was an unusually handsome man. So well
dressed, that he was only saved from being over-dressed by a
certain ease of carriage. He had rather full, dark eyes. A
pleasant manner when he chose. And a very pleasant voice at all
times.</p>

<p>As he was one of those people who cannot imagine a talk
without a drink, he unlocked a tantalus at once.</p>

<p>Pointer declined a cocktail, and so, after a moment, did
Haviland. He could not see what the Chief Inspector had to go on,
or even whether he were going on, but should this prove a "case"
then Tangye obviously might be in it, and the rules of the Force
forbade a drink with a possible arrest, unless for the purpose of
getting at the truth.</p>

<p>"You sent me a note, I think," Tangye returned to the Chief
Inspector, "asking me some question or other about my wife's
friend, Mrs. Cranbourn. I've just had a cable from her from
Marseilles. Would you care to see it?"</p>

<p>The stockbroker handed him a slip of paper on which Pointer
read: "S.S. <i>Reina Hermosa.</i></p>

<p>"Read of your dear wife's tragic death in paper. Terribly
grieved. Maid mistaken in my name as visitor. Mable knew I am
away Mediterranean cruise. Started week ago. Could not possibly
have been England yesterday. Only reached Marseilles this
morning. Leaving to-day. Next stop Piraeus. Letter follows."</p>

<p>"Must have been another lady of the same name who was coming,"
Tangye explained. "There seems to be some sort of a muddle. Not
that it's of any consequence except in so far as that the mere
fact of a caller coming, renders the idea of suicide absolutely
preposterous. Some imprudent gesture on my wife's part&mdash;she
handled that revolver very recklessly&mdash;I don't pretend to
explain it. But there was no cause, none whatever, for her to
take her own life. The very supposition was monstrous." And he
glared at the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Nothing is missing, I understand?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever."</p>

<p>"How about her keys?"</p>

<p>Just for a second Tangye hesitated. Then he said casually, "I
don't call them lost; mislaid, possibly. Nor are they of any
importance."</p>

<p>"Had she no latch-key?"</p>

<p>"I suppose she had. But they're sure to be somewhere in the
house."</p>

<p>"There's a safe in your bedroom, I think?"</p>

<p>"Always open. We never used it. It was in the house
originally. My wife had no valuables. She didn't care for
jewellery."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tangye had a cousin," Pointer began, after a leisurely
glance around the room, "who was brought up with her from
childhood. About the same age too, I believe."</p>

<p>"Oliver Headly?" Tangye nodded. "Quite so."</p>

<p>"Was she in communication with him at all?"</p>

<p>"Not as far as I know. He's not been heard of for years."</p>

<p>"I suppose he's been notified of her death?"</p>

<p>"No one knows his address."</p>

<p>"He's her only living relative, I understand?"</p>

<p>Tangye nodded once more. "Supposing him to be alive. He hasn't
given a sign of life for ten years or more."</p>

<p>Pointer was looking out of the window.</p>

<p>"There's no way down to the river from the house, is
there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, no! None needed. River at the bottom of the garden,
always means garden at the bottom of the river," Tangye spoke
with feeling.</p>

<p>"But you fish?"</p>

<p>"Dace or roach, which?" scoffed their host.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, sir," Pointer eyed the expensive double outfit
on a side wall. Split cane, and spliced salmon rods hung to one
side of trout rods, and a couple of serviceable hickories such as
he himself used. Tangye's gaze followed his.</p>

<p>"Oh, those! I do a bit now and then, when away. But my wife
could land a salmon with the best of them on the Tay."</p>

<p>Pointer continued to stroll around the room in a negligent
way. Then he glanced at Haviland, who rose thankfully. "Can we
look over your bedroom, sir?"</p>

<p>Tangye said by all means, and chatted on to Wilmot.</p>

<p>Pointer found that, unlike Tangye with the river, Haviland had
not overstated the case in his notes. Mrs. Tangye had cleared out
practically everything in the way of clothes but those in which
she had been found dead.</p>

<p>"She hadn't packed anything for herself," Haviland pointed
out, "didn't even have her dressing-case taken down off the
wardrobe. The fact was, she'd finished with clothes. That's what
I think."</p>

<p>He watched Pointer draw aside a strip of tapestry which hung
between the beds. Behind it was a safe. Haviland talked on.</p>

<p>"Tangye's a cool chap! His wife's not buried yet, but here he
is chatting away about Mayflies as lightly as though he were one
himself. In fact, to listen to him, you'd think, now the inquest
is over, that he hadn't a care in the world!"</p>

<p>"No." Pointer said reflectively, looking along the door of the
safe. "No. I wouldn't make that mistake. Tangye has at least one
care left. And that is to direct as much as possible of his
conversation to Wilmot, less to you, and as little as possible to
me. But he's not a cold-blooded man. I take it he's been very
highly keyed-up, and the let-down is coming along a bit fast for
his nerves. Just send a puff of finger-print powder over this
door, will you. You have your bag with you."</p>

<p>The yellow powder discovered no marks, not even on the handle-knob. Pointer and Haviland tried the other metal objects in the
room. All showed the usual signs of handling. "That's funny, for
a fact." Haviland peered through a glass at the immaculate
surface of the safe door. Pointer sniffed at the hinges.</p>

<p>"Been recently cleaned with ether. Unlike the handles of the
little knife and fork in the morning-room, which were clean, but
not cleaned."</p>

<p>Pointer led the way downstairs, and asked for a room in which
the claims investigator could put a few questions to the
household&mdash;or have them asked&mdash;ostensibly for his
benefit.</p>

<p>Regina Saunders, who had just returned, was the first called.
She came in so quietly that Wilmot did not hear her. He looked at
her attentively as she seated herself. Yesterday he had barely
known that she existed.</p>

<p>Walking up to the house just now, he had wondered whether the
explanation of the discrepancies in her statements which had
puzzled Pointer was going to turn out one of those sordid,
triangular affairs called usual, because they are the exception.
She did not look like a charmer. But you never could tell. Never.
At a first glance she seemed to consist chiefly of negatives. She
was not old. Neither did she suggest youth. Without being pretty,
she was not bad-looking. Apparently she had no marked
characteristics of any kind, unless it were those of the perfect
background. She seemed a type of "Ye Discrete Companioun."
Silent. Dark. Attentive.</p>

<p>Gazing at her intently, Wilmot put her age, correctly, as
close on forty. For the first time focussing his mind on her as
she sat composedly facing Haviland,&mdash;Pointer was casually
glancing through the morning paper,&mdash;noting her down-dropped
lids, her pale, tight lips, Wilmot felt as though he were
standing in front of a house with drawn blinds and closed doors,
behind which were wild doings.</p>

<p>It was one of his intuitive, telepathic impressions which, so
far, had never let him down.</p>

<p>"I should like to run through the facts of yesterday again,
with you," Haviland explained, "for the benefit of Mr. Wilmot who
is looking into Mrs. Tangye's death. He has asked the Chief
Inspector and me to put a few more questions." She said
nothing.</p>

<p>"How long have you been with Mrs. Tangye?"</p>

<p>"Three years." The little dark eyes looked up for a second.
Something in the glance told Wilmot that the time had seemed long
to this woman; very long.</p>

<p>"And before that?"</p>

<p>"I was mother's help to a Mrs. Wren. She will be quite willing
to answer any questions. I was with her five years, and left of
my own choice."</p>

<p>"May I ask why Mrs. Tangye wanted a companion originally?"
Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Chiefly for music. She had a good voice also, she was
extremely fond of duets."</p>

<p>"Were you ever a nurse?" the Chief Inspector continued. She
looked surprised. "Never."</p>

<p>"Was Mrs. Wren's husband a doctor? Was your father anything
connected with medicine?"</p>

<p>She was obviously puzzled. "Mr. Wren was a vicar. My father
was an organist. I've never had anything whatever to do with
nursing, or medicine, or illness, or anything of that sort. Why
do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Only part of our regular routine," Pointer said reassuringly.
He rose and, followed by Haviland, stepped out through the French
windows to look over the garden. They had agreed that Wilmot
should be left alone with her to do some of the questioning.</p>

<p>"Now, between ourselves, Miss Saunders, what sort of a woman
was Mrs. Tangye?" Wilmot spoke confidentially. It was a tone that
had helped him more than once. It was wasted on Miss
Saunders.</p>

<p>"Do you think there's much difference in women?" she asked
indifferently. "Much real difference?"</p>

<p>"The Colonel's lady, and Judy O'Grady," he quoted with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Quite so. Though there's no case of Judy here," she spoke
sharply. "Mrs. Tangye is dead, poor soul. Dead." She repeated the
word, lingering on it. To Wilmot's acute ear there was something
approaching unction in her voice. "I, for one, would rather say
nothing against her."</p>

<p>And with that she gave a most illuminating character sketch of
her late employer. Envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness
were in every sentence. According to her, Mrs. Tangye had been a
selfish virago.</p>

<p>"Yet you stuck it here for three years," Wilmot said thought
fully.</p>

<p>"The pay was good."</p>

<p>Pointer and the Superintendent returned from their inspection
of the garden.</p>

<p>"All seems in order. Now, Miss Saunders, about Mrs. Tangye's
last days&mdash;"</p>

<p>But when it came to Monday, Regina Saunders was of no help.
Once a month she had that day off in addition to her free
Sundays. As she had explained at the inquest, this last Moriday
had been her own, and been spent away from Riverview.</p>

<p>"And when did you decide to leave here?" Pointer asked. "You
could hardly expect me to stop on after Mrs. Tangye's death," she
said coldly.</p>

<p>"It's a censorious world," Pointer agreed, "still&mdash;you
left&mdash;when?"</p>

<p>"About seven, I think."</p>

<p>"I see. Now, as we explained to you, this gentleman," Pointer
turned to Wilmot, "is investigating the death on behalf of the
Insurance Society, and we want to give him all the aid we can.
Would you object to occupying your old room again for a few days?
It would be a help to be able to turn to you at any time."</p>

<p>"I am here all day. I am staying on to superintend the
household for a little while&mdash;at Mr. Tangye's request. But I
prefer to go home to my sister's at night."</p>

<p>"But to oblige us? Just for a night or two?" Pointer wheedled.
"Something might turn up after you had left here?"</p>

<p>Miss Saunders looked impatient.</p>

<p>"I never go back on a decision. Once I have made up my mind, I
stick to it."</p>

<p>"Admirable trait," Wilmot murmured in mock admiration.</p>

<p>"We should, of course, expect the Insurance Society to pay for
the convenience," Pointer went on, "a pound a night is the usual
thing, I believe, in a case of this kind, where it's done merely
to help the investigation, and is only a question of two, or at
most three nights." He turned to Wilmot. "Quite so; a pound a
night," Wilmot agreed.</p>

<p>Miss Saunders pondered the proposal for the first time.
Evidently Pointer's improvised tariff appealed to her. But after
a minute she shook her head. "I prefer to go to my sister's, as I
have arranged."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Did any one see you leave the house yesterday when you went
to the circulating library?" Haviland asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But at any rate the person who served me with
tea in the Japanese tea-room next door might remember me. She
knows me by sight quite well." Miss Saunders spoke
indifferently.</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. Tangye want any particular book brought back, or
leave it to you?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"She left it to me. I found nothing that she would care for,
so I brought home the book she had given me. She had not quite
finished it I knew."</p>

<p>"Did you ask the librarian for any book?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You didn't change any book whatever there?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Pointer glanced at Wilmot.</p>

<p>"Now going back to the cause of Mrs. Tangye's death," the
newspaper man began, "which is what I want to establish, you feel
sure that she didn't shoot herself intentionally?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. Why should she shoot herself? She had everything
in the world that she wanted, hadn't she?" the last words came
with a rush.</p>

<p>"Do you mean Mr. Tangye?" Wilmot asked so blankly that
Haviland bit his lip.</p>

<p>"I mean everything." But Miss Saunders spoke more guardedly.
"Mrs. Tangye wasn't used to the kind of life he gave her. A
motor, and maids, and that. She told me herself once that she had
known what it was to be bitterly poor."</p>

<p>The stipend of the Reverend Charles Headly having been under
three hundred a year, out of which he had to pay a curate, the
men thought that that was quite likely.</p>

<p>"Then you think she was happy?" persisted Wilmot.</p>

<p>"As much as her temperament would let her, I do. She was one
of those women who always want what they haven't got.. She was
always contrasting Mr. Tangye with Mr. Branscombe's
perfections."</p>

<p>"That doesn't sound to me a happy life," Haviland
murmured.</p>

<p>Miss Saunders flashed him an ironic glance.</p>

<p>"You mean in fact that they quarrelled?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"They led the usual married life," she said dryly. Wilmot
laughed, while Haviland, who was a very happy man in his home,
looked at her with marked distaste.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tangye says you were the last person to see Mrs. Tangye's
keys. Could you tell us when that was?" Pointer asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>Her eyes were on his as he spoke. Far back in them a spark
glowed suddenly. The question had obviously come as a complete
surprise. And all three men thought that the surprise was not the
only emotion stirred. There was anger.</p>

<p>And there was something that for a second suggested dismay.
But she looked down her nose immediately, and said with perfect
composure, "I can't think that he would say such a thing!" This
was true enough.</p>

<p>"My mistake doubtless," Pointer said easily, and changed the
subject to the visitor, the supposed Mrs. Cranbourn, Miss
Saunders said that she saw no one as she ran down the stairs. She
thought that the caller must have stepped into the drawing-room
and let herself out later on.</p>

<p>"But the reporter who came back with the maid said that you
remained in the hall till the police came."</p>

<p>"That's quite true." Miss Saunders looked puzzled. "But
perhaps she left after the police arrived. We were all in the
morning-room together for a time then."</p>

<p>"Impossible. I had a man posted at both doors. Front and
back." Haviland was very certain of this.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of it before. What <i>did</i> become of
her?" Miss Saunders looked uneasy.</p>

<p>"Leaving her on one side for the moment, how did you first
learn that Mrs. Tangye was dead?"</p>

<p>Miss Saunders repeated what she had told Haviland, and the
Coroner.</p>

<p>"You came immediately Florence screamed?" Pointer's tone
suggested a delay. A suspicious delay.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"At her first scream?" Pointer persisted. As though he
intended to prove that in some way the companion had been
dilatory.</p>

<p>"I ran down immediately. She only screamed the once. I glanced
in at the open morning-room door, and hurried after her to try
and stop her making a scene in the street." Miss Saunders spoke
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Tangye was not sitting where you could see her from
the door."</p>

<p>Miss Saunders made a movement with the edge of her cupped
hand, as though brushing off some imaginary crumbs from the table
top beside her.</p>

<p>The room was very still.</p>

<p>"I may have gone in far enough to see her sitting in her
chair," she said finally.</p>

<p>"And by merely glancing at her from a distance,
you&mdash;without any medical knowledge&mdash;were able to tell
the reporter who met the maid that no help was wanted? That he
need not go into the room where Mrs. Tangye was?" Pointer spoke
gravely. "You took that formidable responsibility on yourself
after one look?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you try to do something for her?" Wilmot burst out.
Both he and Haviland were watching the woman intently, at whom
Pointer seemed barely to glance. She looked quite unruffled. But
again her hand swept the table top, with a slow, considering
movement.</p>

<p>"I suppose I must have run up to her," she said meditatively.
"As to helping her&mdash;" there was something repressed in Miss
Saunders level tones, "of course, I didn't want to touch her till
the police came."</p>

<p>Haviland nodded official approval of that eminently correct
attitude. But Pointer looked very wooden.</p>

<p>"Why? Did you think a crime had been committed?" She passed a
furtive tongue over her thin lips.</p>

<p>"Such an absurd idea never entered my mind."</p>

<p>"Any more than the equally absurd one of trying to see if you
could do something for the poor lady," Wilmot retorted.</p>

<p>She did not shift her eyes from Pointer, though she answered
the comment.</p>

<p>"One does not need to be the king's physician, nor yet a
gifted detective," her gaze was mocking, "to know what a bullet
wound over a heart means, with a dropped revolver on the floor by
the body's side."</p>

<p>"To go back to what happened after Florence screamed," Pointer
continued; "you still maintain that you were able to run down the
stairs, get across the whole of the morning-room to the recess,
make certain that Mrs. Tangye was dead, get out of the room
again, and be seen standing in the front door before Florence had
more than left the house? The reporter said that as the door
opened, and she rushed out, you stepped into the open doorway
behind her."</p>

<p>"It all happened so swiftly," Regina Saunders muttered.
"Still, human beings take some time to move from one spot to
another, you know."</p>

<p>"This cross-examination is ridiculous," she snapped defiantly.
"It tells nothing."</p>

<p>"On the contrary! It tells much," Pointer's voice was very
hard. "It tells us that you didn't run into the morning-room at
all when Florence called out. You went straight down the stairs
to the front door, reaching it just as the maid flung it wide. In
other words you knew, without going in, what was in the morning-room. You knew because you had already been in there. Don't try
to mislead us!"</p>

<p>Pointer turned on the woman with something very forbidding in
his stern face. He towered over her. He stood six feet three. She
paled. But her eyes remained watchful and ready. Again she swept
the table beside her, her gaze now following the motion of her
hand.</p>

<p>"You're right," she said suddenly, speaking in a pleasant,
conversational voice. "You're quite right. When I got back from
the library, or rather from the tea-room a little before six, I
went in to the morning-room to tell Mrs. Tangye about not
bringing her any book. I found her&mdash;dead! Just as Florence
did a little later. I was so horrified...It was such a shock. I
managed to get to my rooms. But once there&mdash;I think I
fainted. I had just pulled myself together when I heard Florence
scream, and ran down to the front door. As you guessed. Frankly,
I cannot see what is wrong in my not saying that I saw poor Mrs.
Tangye a moment before the maid did. And lost my nerve in
consequence for a few seconds."</p>

<p>Pointer made no comment on this amended account.</p>

<p>A question put by him as to whether she had ever met Mrs.
Tangye's cousin Oliver was answered in the negative. She did not
even know, she said, that Mrs. Tangye had a relative alive.</p>

<p>Florence came in next. She was very nervous, but Haviland soon
put her at her ease.</p>

<p>Pointer, apparently for Wilmot's sake&mdash;seemed much
interested in Mrs. Tangye's directions about her expected
visitor. Especially in her order that she was definitely, and
distinctly "not at home," to any other caller. No matter
whom.</p>

<p>"She told me that I wasn't to worry if Mrs. Cranbourn was
late. Very late. As the boat train was often hours behind
time."</p>

<p>"Worry?" Pointer echoed, "what did she mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I suppose that I wasn't to worry her," Florence suggested
shrewdly, "the mistress couldn't abide fuss. Never liked me to go
in and out much. Oh, I had to make my head save my heels with
Mrs. Tangye, I assure you, sir. I think she spoke as she did to
stop my bothering her with more hot water, or freshly-toasted
cakes."</p>

<p>"That was quite usual, was it?"</p>

<p>It was. Florence repeated that there had been nothing in the
least unusual, or out of the way, in her mistress's manner or
directions yesterday, and also that nothing however trifling had
happened then, or before, which she had not already told.</p>

<p>"How was it that the police only found a couple of logs alight
in the morning-room fireplace when they were here yesterday
evening? Was the fire only lit very late?" Pointer asked
casually.</p>

<p>"Oh, that fire!" Florence clasped tragic hands.</p>

<p>She told them that the chimney was always uncertain, but that
yesterday it had distinguished itself. Nothing the maids could do
would make it burn, let alone blaze. From before breakfast until
the hour set for tea it had smoked sullenly. "I wonder that Mrs.
Tangye didn't use another room," Pointer mused.</p>

<p>"You'd have wondered more, sir, if you'd seen how thick it was
in there. Fit to kipper a haddock, it was really." Florence went
on to tell how she had urged her mistress to let her bring the
tea-things into the drawing-room, as on other occasions when the
morning-room chimney had been tiresome; but Mrs. Tangye would not
hear of it.</p>

<p>"The wind changed after four, I noticed when I opened the door
at six that the fire was behaving itself&mdash;all things
considered&mdash;better than I'd hoped."</p>

<p>The fireplace was in the main part of the room.</p>

<p>"Wasn't the room cold?"</p>

<p>"Not so bad when the windows were shut, for the kitchen
chimney warms it then, but it was bitter when I brought in the
tea-things. Mrs. Tangye had to keep the windows open because of
the smoke. She must have shut them later on when the fire began
to blaze up."</p>

<p>Florence was as certain as she had been at the inquest that
the windows were tightly fastened when she caught sight of her
dead mistress.</p>

<p>"Tell us once more about the visitor, what did she look like?"
Wilmot asked, on Pointer glancing at him.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Cranbourn, sir? Sort of stout and all muffled up in a
fur coat with a large collar up to her eyes. Very wheezy voice. I
couldn't notice much, for she stepped past me at once, saying,
'I'm most frightfully late, I'm afraid.' She was talking and
moving all in one breath. I opened the morning-door and went
forward saying, 'Mrs. Cranbourn to see you'm. But when I got to
the alcove&mdash;" The rest they knew.</p>

<p>She had no idea what had become of the caller. "I suppose she
caught sight over my shoulder of Mrs. Tangye. At any rate I
didn't see her no more. But when I think of the poor mistress
sitting there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did the visitor step towards the morning-room as though she
knew the house?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"She did. Mrs. Tangye always has tea in there in winter."</p>

<p>"Then the lady must have been to Riverview before?"</p>

<p>"Very likely. But not in my time. I've only been here a year.
Mrs. Cranbourn must have known the house from before then."</p>

<p>"Are you <i>sure</i> it was Mrs. Cranbourn?" Pointer asked
quietly.</p>

<p>"Why, who else could it be, sir? At that hour, and all bundled
up from a journey?" Florence stared at the Chief Inspector as
though he must be strangely dense not to see this for
himself.</p>

<p>"That's true. She was very agitated, you said, I think?"</p>

<p>"She was in a frightful rush, sir. She almost shoved past me.
But there! We little know! The next moment I must have pushed
past her to get out of the room!"</p>

<p>Florence could not amplify her account of the caller. The
shock of finding Mrs. Tangye dead had wiped away all clear
remembrance of the woman whose arrival had led to the
discovery.</p>

<p>Pointer turned the subject.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tangye's dress looks to me rather handsome. All that fur
and silver embroidery. Isn't it more elaborate than she usually
wore of an afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir. Mrs. Tangye dressed very quiet. That frock was
going to be worn at a wedding next week."</p>

<p>"Had she had it on before?"</p>

<p>"Once. This last Monday."</p>

<p>"Ah yes, the day she sent you to Jay's."</p>

<p>Pointer went over the Monday too, very carefully with
Florence. He learnt nothing fresh.</p>

<p>Coming again to Tuesday, and to the missing keys, Florence
said she was sure that she had seen them lying on the top of her
mistress's writing bureau when she was in the room at four.</p>

<p>Pointer glanced at Wilmot.</p>

<p>"You look a clever girl," Wilmot said flatteringly, "what's
your opinion of this sad affair? Your honest opinion as between
friends. The inquest is over now."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, of course it was an accident! She didn't kill
herself I Not she! Why, there's that evening-dress. She'd only
just ordered it. You don't throw away sixty pounds for nothing,
do you? At least Mrs. Tangye didn't. And those shoes that were
being made to match. Oh no, sir. It was an accident. Mrs. Tangye
did something careless-like with that Webley of hers, and that
was that!"</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, have you ever see her handling the
revolver when you were in the room?" Haviland asked.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have been in the room long, if I had, you bet,"
Florence spoke with a vigour that made the men smile.</p>

<p>"And when did you last see it in its box?" asked Pointer.
"Monday morning it was there all right. I know by the weight. But
it wasn't in it yesterday morning."</p>

<p>The inquest had elicited the fact&mdash;from Tangye&mdash;that
his wife had spoken of putting it in a drawer in her bureau to
help her to remember about the initials.</p>

<p>"Can you suggest any reason why Mrs. Tangye went through her
papers so thoroughly yesterday morning?" Pointer was now
questioning her. She could not.</p>

<p>"And about Miss Saunders&mdash;did she start her packing on
Monday or only yesterday morning?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday morning, sir."</p>

<p>Haviland inwardly opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah yes! After that quarrel she and Mrs Tangye had." Pointer
was bluffing.</p>

<p>"You mean their talk after breakfast, sir? Oh, they weren't
quarrelling. The mistress's voice was quite low and soft. And she
always raised it when she was angry. Always. It sounded to me
more like it was Miss Saunders who was huffed. I heard her say,
'It's not the money. It's how it looks. I insist on staying till
at least the end of the week.' That was the first thing after
breakfast, that was."</p>

<p>"Ah yes," mused Pointer again, "the quarrel came after lunch,
I think."</p>

<p>"It couldn't have, sir. The mistress went out directly lunch
was over, and there was no trouble when they were at table. There
hadn't been no quarrel or the mistress would never have talked to
her as she did. Talked quite a lot for Mrs. Tangye."</p>

<p>"Where were they when you heard Miss Saunders speak of
leaving?"</p>

<p>"In the morning-room, sir. Miss Saunders said that and walked
out."</p>

<p>"Did she look vexed?"</p>

<p>"Well no, sir. But that goes for nothing. Miss Saunders never
shows when she's angry. But she pays you back for it just the
same."</p>

<p>"You don't like Miss Saunders?"</p>

<p>Florence did not. But servants rarely like companions. Pointer
harked back to yesterday afternoon, and tried his last cast:</p>

<p>"You said at the inquest that your mistress came in from the
garden as you brought in the tea-tray?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Five minutes to the hour that was."</p>

<p>"Did she often go out in the garden after dark? On such a day
as we had yesterday?" Pointer was doing all the questioning
now.</p>

<p>"Well no, sir. Now I come to think of it she
doesn't&mdash;didn't."</p>

<p>"Did you see her in the garden at all?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't have. You see, sir, in this house the back garden
is all at the side. Except just a little bit that's in front."
Wilmot laughed outright.</p>

<p>"She was alone in the garden, I suppose?" Pointer went on. "Oh
yes, sir. Quite alone."</p>

<p>"How do you know, if you couldn't see her?" Pointer persisted,
half-smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I should have heard voices, shouldn't I? The
window of my pantry&mdash;it's too high up to see out of, but it
gives on to that side." She stopped suddenly, as though
remembering something. A rather startled look spread over her
face.</p>

<p>"Yes?" cooed Pointer persuasively.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, that's funny! Talking of her being alone, my
sister Olive, she said to me as we were giving the silver a rub-up before bringing in the tray, she said that she thought she
heard a crunch-crunch on the gravel behind the mistress. But then
Olive&mdash;" she hesitated, "my sister hears things. She's not
normal, the doctor tells us." She announced the fact with some
pride. "She's taken on something cruel at Mrs. Tangye's death.
Says she felt it coming, and ought to've warned her. But there,
Olive is that way! It's not being normal does it."</p>

<p>"What did she hear out of the pantry window?"</p>

<p>"Something like steps coming after the mistress over the
gravel, sir. Very soft-like and cautious. I switched on the
electric to have a look&mdash;we was working by the
fire&mdash;and at that the steps stopped dead. Not Mrs. Tangye's.
The other ones I mean."</p>

<p>"You heard them, too?"</p>

<p>"Quite clear for just a moment before they stopped."</p>

<p>"Footsteps that stopped when you switched on the light,"
Pointer looked at his boot tips. "I'll look at your pantry in a
minute. Did you or Olive hear the steps again?"</p>

<p>They had not.</p>

<p>"Some butcher's boy coming for orders," Wilmot's tone was
dryly amused.</p>

<p>"At that hour of an afternoon, sir!" It was Florence's turn to
be diverted.</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;missed the tradesman's entrance in the dark,
and hoped to be directed to it."</p>

<p>"Then why did the steps stop, sir?"</p>

<p>"Were they peculiar footsteps?"</p>

<p>"In a way. They seemed to have a sort of kink to them every
now and then. Sort of a catch, if you know what I mean." She
tried to illustrate her meaning, and did a Highland fling which
failed to convince.</p>

<p>Olive was next summoned. She was a slender, pale, young woman
with over-large eyes, and a timid smile.</p>

<p>"We're still uncertain about this affair," Wilmot began on a
sign from Pointer, "now what do <i>you</i> think about it? You
ought to have formed your own opinion, living in the same house.
Do you think that Mrs. Tangye meant to shoot herself, or was it a
genuine accident? Come now, as between ourselves."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I don't know what to think. Florence, she
thinks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We know what your sister thinks," Pointer assured her
pleasantly, "but you now?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, cook thinks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We shall learn in good time what Cook thinks, but what about
you? Mr. Wilmot wants to hear your opinion."</p>

<p>Olive grew desperate.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I can't help thinking the mistress <i>did</i> do
it. But was drove to it like. She was all of a twitter that last
day. Yesterday. I think she did it in a fit of passion, half wild
about something. I felt it coming along, sir. Oh, I felt it
creeping on her."</p>

<p>"Just what do you mean by that?" Wilmot spoke gently, but with
obvious curiosity.</p>

<p>"I feel things beforehand, sir. I knew when father was going
to die weeks and weeks before the crane broke. I felt the same
feeling come on me again a couple of days ago. Sunday morning it
was I got up with it. And it's never left me since."</p>

<p>"Surely it's left you by now," Haviland suggested in his
hearty, healthy, beefy voice.</p>

<p>"Not to notice, sir." A cryptic reply that made his lips
twitch.</p>

<p>But she, too, had heard no sound yesterday afternoon that
could possibly have been a shot.</p>

<p>"Now, about Mrs. Tangye, did you see her by chance in the
garden before tea?" Pointer asked, as though nothing had been
said on the subject.</p>

<p>"I heard her walking up and down on the path that runs past
the morning-room windows. It's been freshly gravelled."</p>

<p>"Was Mrs. Tangye alone?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know." Olive spoke slowly. "I have
wonderful hearing, sir. That's what makes it seem so funny I
heard no shot. No blind man can hear better than me. I heard
footsteps creep up behind the mistress. Getting nearer and
nearer. They weren't more than a yard behind her when Flo turned
up the light, and they stopped. Flo heard them too, just
then."</p>

<p>"But I thought you said you weren't sure if Mrs. Tangye was
alone in the garden." Wilmot spoke in some perplexity.</p>

<p>"But you can hear things sometimes that you couldn't see."
Olive spoke under her breath with a quick dilation of her pupils.
"I know you won't believe me, sir. Flo doesn't in her heart. She
thinks its because of what happened after. But I knew then those
steps meant harm to the mistress."</p>

<p>"Were they peculiar footsteps?" probed Wilmot again. "Not in
the way you mean, sir, though they had a sort of stumble to them.
But I pray God never to hear 'em no more." Haviland thought the
atmosphere was getting a bit tense. "You spoke of Mrs. Tangye
having killed herself," he began, "why should she do that? Come
now, Olive, just you hold on to facts. Don't think of spooky
things any more." Olive looked rather hesitatingly at the police-officer.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Superintendent, now it can't harm nobody, now that
the inquest's over, I don't mind saying that I saw her myself
going through the master's over-coat pockets. This last Saturday,
just before dinner. He had left his top-coat behind that he
usually wears down to his office. And Mrs. Tangye pulled out a
letter and stood reading it. Short note it was. She folded it up,
and stood tapping the floor with her foot before she put it into
her handbag and went on into the dining-room with a toss of her
head that as good as said she had made up her mind to
something&mdash;" Olive stopped, as though she had said too
much.</p>

<p>No pressing could get her to supply the name of any woman from
whom the letter might have come. Obviously she did not know it.
And to the rest of the questions put her, she could only bear out
what her sister had already told them. She too had never heard
Mrs Tangye refer to any living member of her family.</p>

<p>Miss Saunders stepped in to say that the undertakers' men were
coming, and that Mr. Tangye would be obliged if they need not
know that the police were in the house. They would be some time.
Half an hour probably. Pointer turned ostentatiously to
Wilmot.</p>

<p>"Let's go for a stroll," that figure-head suggested. "We can
come back and finish afterwards."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>

<p class="first">THE three men walked towards the river in
silence for some minutes. A soft, sibilant murmur came from the
water which had lost its lights now, and lay hidden in mist. It
seemed to Pointer to be chanting
"Accident&mdash;Suicide&mdash;Murder?
Accident&mdash;Suicide&mdash;Murder?" under its breath.</p>

<p>Any of the three might still be the word that would fit the
puzzle which the Chief Inspector intended to solve. Haviland
turned to the newspaper man.</p>

<p>"Well, whether accident or suicide, we hand it over to you
now, Mr. Wilmot. Unless the Chief Inspector thinks otherwise, of
course. I suppose the case is closed, as far as the police are
concerned? Olive seems to've got hold of the right tip. That
letter that she saw Mrs. Tangye reading must have been the last
straw. As a matter of fact, I said we should find that something
of that kind had happened."</p>

<p>Pointer lit his pipe.</p>

<p>"The footsteps that stopped," he spoke the words as though
they pleased his ear. "Sounds like one of your own articles,
Wilmot."</p>

<p>Wilmot turned a meditative eye on the Chief Inspector, "Nice
head-line. But I make a point of never misleading my public."</p>

<p>This time it was Pointer who looked his question.</p>

<p>"Well, even if they ever existed, which I very much doubt.
Tangye may have run down from town hoping to make his peace with
his wife. Say that there was a row on Monday which made him skip
dinner at home." Both Wilmot's listeners nodded. Each had already
said that to himself. "He may have gone into the garden after
her. It would cost me my reputation to raise hopes of a dramatic
development, and then have it fizzle out into father's list
slippers."</p>

<p>"You think it will?"</p>

<p>Wilmot did not reply for a second. Had they found anything
which suggested foul play? Honestly, as far as he could see, they
had not. But what about Pointer? His were the eyes that counted
in this search.</p>

<p>"What does the Counsel for the Prosecution say?" Wilmot asked
instead of replying.</p>

<p>"That when you talk of suicide&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or accident. I'm afraid I think that's only too possible,"
Wilmot said pensively.</p>

<p>"Or accident. You forget the butter under Mrs. Tangye's
wedding rings," Pointer spoke very seriously.</p>

<p>"You overwhelm me with confusion, so I had!" Wilmot spoke in
mock consternation. "Is this the sort of rock on which a police
inquiry is built? I've no idea how that mysterious process
begins. Do you inventory the butter on her finger solemnly under
the heading of 'Clues of which the Police are in
Possession'?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Haviland laughed in his turn. "The fact is, we
haven't found even the ghost of such a thing as a clue which
points to a crime, have we, sir?"</p>

<p>"And where there's no clue there's no crime?" Wilmot
queried.</p>

<p>"Whose steps stopped in the garden?" Pointer asked. "Tangye
would have come on in, if they had been his. At least, so it
seems to me. Why was her left hand so buttery that it left such
clear prints on her revolver and yet none on her fork?"</p>

<p>Haviland turned to him quickly.</p>

<p>"You spoke before of her prints on the Webley as being odd,
sir? In what way, in fact?"</p>

<p>"I can tell better when I have studied the enlargements," was
the evasive reply.</p>

<p>There was a short silence. This was different from theorising
beforehand. The Chief Inspector was looking over the fields. Was
the <i>Hark, Hallo!</i> coming? It all lay with the young man
leaning with folded arms on the low parapet of the bridge and
staring straight before him with level, quiet eyes.</p>

<p>Haviland fidgetted with a cigar. "Of course," he said
dubiously, "it's a question of finding out what's essential and
what isn't..."</p>

<p>Wilmot gave a short laugh. "Be able to do that, Haviland, and
you'll be a god, not a policeman."</p>

<p>"Still, as a matter of fact," Haviland went on doggedly, "that
is what has to be done."</p>

<p>"And pray what is the essential fact or facts here?" Wilmot
asked indulgently.</p>

<p>Pointer answered for the Superintendent, "The most essential
thing in, this case is to find out exactly what happened on
Sunday. When the break occurred."</p>

<p>"Break?"</p>

<p>"Between the old Mrs. Tangye and the new Mrs. Tangye. Between
the woman who went on as always, and the woman who apparently
changed her habits so much."</p>

<p>"She seems to've quarrelled with Tangye on Monday as usual,"
Wilmot reminded him.</p>

<p>"True," Pointer had to smile at the other's tone. "Yet she
first began then to prepare for her coming departure."</p>

<p>"Safe word that. We can all meet on it," Wilmot murmured
approvingly.</p>

<p>"Apparently, only apparently, of course," Pointer went on,
"she seems to've been her usual self till Sunday morning."</p>

<p>"Till that letter she read," Haviland breathed.</p>

<p>"Until she went to Tunbridge Wells at any rate. Possibly that
decision itself marked the beginning of the change. For when she
gets back she goes to bed. She starts next day weeding out her
wardrobe; the day after she tears up her private papers. It looks
to me as if something had happened down at that flower-show."</p>

<p>"Sunday," Wilmot repeated meditatively. "I don't follow you
there, Pointer. The break, as you call it&mdash;the breaking-point would be nearer the mark, I think&mdash;occurred in my
judgment, not between two Mrs. Tangyes, but between her and her
husband, and took place Monday afternoon. You say she had changed
by Monday. I can't see any change before that talk or quarrel,
with her husband about five in the afternoon. On Monday morning
she had had her hair waved, says Florence. We know that in the
afternoon, she took a vivid interest in her new evening-dress.
Those preparations on which we all lay so much store, though we
read them differently, only began after she had seen and talked
with her husband at tea-time."</p>

<p>"No, not quite," Haviland corrected, "as a matter of fact she
went out and left word before five with Carter Patterson to take
her trunk to the Salvation Army's old clothes department.
<i>Before</i> her husband got home from his weekend."</p>

<p>Wilmot did not know this. It altered his argument as he at
once said.</p>

<p>"And you think what happened on Sunday when she was away from
home so important, do you sir?" Haviland asked, "More so, in
fact, than the letter itself, which sent her down there?"</p>

<p>"We may be able to guess the letter from what took place. But
not the other way round. Was the show the sort of thing that
would get into the papers, Wilmot? London papers?"</p>

<p>"You mean would any reporters be sent down to Tunbridge who
might be able to help us? Not one." Wilmot explained that orchid
shows in country towns, even big ones like this affair, would
never get beyond a line or two, and those would be telegraphed up
by some local amateur enthusiast, who would also, in all
certainty, write the articles in the more important country
papers. The exhibition firms supplying the smaller ones with
data.</p>

<p>"The show on Sunday is one essential then, sir. Are there any
others?" Haviland had been meditating on the Chief Inspector's
words.</p>

<p>But Pointer did not answer directly. He seemed to be thinking
aloud.</p>

<p>"Monday afternoon, when Miss Saunders is absent, Florence is
sent off too on an errand, and Olive is told that Mrs. Tangye's
not at home to any one before five o'clock, and is given a stiff
bit of mending to do. In other words, Mrs. Tangye secures herself
from interruption Monday afternoon. Then next day, yesterday,
Miss Saunders is sent out. She's the only one in the house who
can come and go as she likes, remember. She generally has tea
with Mrs. Tangye of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Tangye gives particular orders for an uninterrupted
chat with her special friend." Wilmot spoke impatiently. "My dear
fellow, no one could accuse you of swallowing camels, but you
certainly do go for any gnat in sight."</p>

<p>"Doesn't Mrs. Tangye's partiality for having tea in an
impossible room strike you as peculiar?" Pointer countered.</p>

<p>Haviland stared. Wilmot permitted himself to look puzzled.</p>

<p>"Senseless whim," he murmured, "but not necessarily criminal,
I should have thought."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily senseless," Pointer replied with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>"You think the smoky fire&mdash;but would that weigh much, in
fact, with a desperate woman&mdash;sick of life&mdash;?" groped
Haviland.</p>

<p>"It would weigh heavily with a woman expecting a visitor,"
Pointer reminded him. Haviland stepped away to let a perambulator
come up and pass them.</p>

<p>"In the plan which the Superintendent drew of Riverview,"
Pointer went on in his absence, "Haviland's an excellent officer,
very thorough along his own lines. He has a quick eye."</p>

<p>"He has&mdash;for a fact," Wilmot laughed, and Haviland,
catching the last word, grinned.</p>

<p>"I'm an Essex man," he said in excuse, as he turned to Pointer
when the bridge was empty again, "you were saying, sir?"</p>

<p>"That in your plan the morning-room shows as the only one in
the house which can be entered directly from the garden, without
having to pass any other window. Now, adding this interesting
detail to the unusual fondness of Mrs. Tangye for a smoky room
yesterday, and you get quite an intriguing little sum."</p>

<p>"You might, if they belonged together," Wilmot agreed
cautiously, "but if you add the density of the atmosphere to the
distance from the earth to the moon, your result's not likely to
be of much practical use."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought when I learnt from the evidence at the
inquest that Mrs. Tangye had been <i>expecting</i> a visitor. An
expected caller drew a straight line through my sum. This cable
of Mrs. Cranbourn's, however, reverses that. Or rather, what
seems like a stroke through the whole, becomes one of it's most
important items."</p>

<p>"Are we at last to be permitted to glimpse your
meaning&mdash;to fathom the mysterious depths with which you
credit that fact?" Wilmot screwed up his eyes. A sign of close
attention.</p>

<p>"Remember the situation of the morning-room. Mrs. Tangye's
sticking to it in spite of discomfort, and add the new fact that
very definite instructions were given by her that she was not at
home yesterday, except to a certain, very carefully specified
lady, who quite positively couldn't come. I maintain that my sum
total's worth thinking over. Especially if you add a few other
extras floating around."</p>

<p>Wilmot pondered for some minutes.</p>

<p>"You mean?" he repeated cautiously.</p>

<p>"This: Mr. Tangye never gets back on Tuesdays from his office
until half-past six at the earliest. Mrs. Tangye sends her
companion off just before four to change a novel for her at the
circulating library and tells her to have tea out. The library is
about half an hour away. It doesn't close till seven. Tea at
Riverview was ordered at four; one would have thought that Miss
Saunders could have had it before going for the book. The maid,
after bringing in the tea-things, always leaves her mistress
undisturbed until she clears away at six. That is a rule of the
house, we learnt. Now, if in addition, Mrs. Tangye tells her that
on no account will she be at home to anybody except to some one
who isn't&mdash;<i>can't be</i>&mdash;coming, then, in this way
she both has an excuse for ordering, as she does, a very ample
tea, and also insures in every possible way that she can count on
being undisturbed for two hours. Four to six."</p>

<p>"But the caller of later on? The woman who came and said she
was frightfully overdue," Haviland protested, "aren't you
forgetting her? Her name may have been Cranbourn too, as Tangye
suggested."</p>

<p>"Sort of gratuitous little muddle that's quite to be
expected," Pointer agreed.</p>

<p>"Yes," Wilmot said slowly, thinking over Pointer's words, "you
can't get around the fact that some woman came. And on an
appointment, you know."</p>

<p>"I don't know," Pointer put up his pipe with a sigh, "I must
leave her on one side for the moment. Her coming doesn't explain
anything&mdash;nor hang together with anything."</p>

<p>"She made a bee-line for the morning-room," Haviland pointed
out.</p>

<p>"True but I can't see why Mrs. Tangye should stick to that
particular room in spite of smoke, and bitter cold, for the sake
of some one who could come to the front door, and therefore could
have been shown into any other room. At least as far as we yet
know to the contrary."</p>

<p>"Then for what reason did she stick to it?" Wilmot asked
irritably. He never liked asking for solutions.</p>

<p>"There's just a possibility that Mrs. Tangye gave some one an
appointment in that room. Some one who was not to come to the
front door. It was this bare possibility which brought me down to
Twickenham in the first place. Only that expected
visit&mdash;that bluff&mdash;about Mrs. Cranbourn&mdash;put my
theory all out, for the moment."</p>

<p>"Um-m. Seems to me a very heavy scaffolding to builds around
one smoky chimney," Wilmot temporised. Had he been the one to
originate it, he would have hailed it with joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, there are other things. Why did Mrs. Tangye walk up and
down outside that window, while the maid brought in tea? Unless
it were to be on the lookout lest this 'some one' should blunder
into the room while the girl was still there? It was hardly an
afternoon to select for a turn in the garden. The open window
would send its ray of light far out as a beacon, a guide,
remember."</p>

<p>"You think Mrs. Tangye had given some one a rendezvous, a
secret appointment yesterday afternoon?" Wilmot cocked his head
on one side. "Is that where that cousin of hers comes in? The one
you questioned Tangye about? Your interest in any one is rarely
to their credit. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"He seems a bit of a dark horse. Distinguished himself at
Oxford. So much so that the authorities thought one half term
quite sufficient. I haven't got all the notes on him yet.
Apparently, as Tangye said, he dropped out of sight some dozen
years ago."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Tangye was Mrs. Grundy's twin sister. Nothing
romantic. Nothing of the heart could make the lady we looked at
just now step one inch off the beaten track. Take that from
me."</p>

<p>Pointer took it. Took it very seriously. Wilmot's judgments on
men and events were not to be lightly passed over. He had a
famous knack of winning by a head. His own head, as Fleet Street
put it.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, the fact remains," Pointer continued, "that on
the two days following last Sunday, Mrs. Tangye takes very
similar measures to safeguard herself from interruption for at
least a part of the afternoon."</p>

<p>"There's that vanished cousin of hers," Haviland put in, "he
might fit the idea you have about that morning-room. Supposing
he's done something and couldn't show his face, in fact."</p>

<p>"Just so. He might. Though I don't necessarily think that it
was a man who came. As I said before, I only call the criminal
'him' for the sake of brevity. Also women don't commit murder as
often as men do."</p>

<p>"Not enough courage," Wilmot was no lover of the fair sex.
"But even if you're right about Mrs. Tangye's reason for speaking
as though she expected Mrs. Cranbourn, I hold that it would only
be to gain time for the last, fatal step. That at least is how I
read the story. Sorry. But it seems to me the only
reading&mdash;so far. I see no possibility of that bullet having
been fired by any other hand but Mrs. Tangye's.</p>

<p>"I maintain," he said again, after turning Pointer's
suggestion carefully over in his mind, "that Mrs. Tangye stuck to
that room because it was, or rather had been, her favourite. She
had spent many happy hours there. The room tells that. She wanted
to say good-bye to life in its friendly atmosphere."</p>

<p>"And the order for a larger tea than usual?"</p>

<p>"More bluff. To have the room to herself. Remember you
yourself suggested that reason for the minute directions about
admitting any one but Miss Eden."</p>

<p>Pointer shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can't see that Mrs. Tangye's actions yesterday play any
part in the theory of a suicide. In mine they do. In mine each is
vital. They're unintelligent in any other light. Mrs. Tangye
could have shot herself much better in bed."</p>

<p>"The' fact is, that's what's been bothering me," Haviland
broke in, "but I think she may have meant to be found by Tangye.
Or even by her caller."</p>

<p>"Anything's possible." Was all Pointer would allow that shot,
by way of marks. "But so far, no new facts shake my theory. And
when a theory's not shaken by closer inspection, it's
strengthened."</p>

<p>"Nice little pile of chance sweepings is all I can see,"
Wilmot sighed.</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>Pointer and Haviland both smiled.</p>

<p>"It's all very well," Wilmot admitted grudgingly, "but your
theory doesn't hold the late caller."</p>

<p>"I don't know yet if it's necessary that it should," Pointer
said equably. "Mrs. Tangye's own actions don't seem to have
included her either. The order to the maid might have been to
exclude her. Time will show where she belongs. Outside or inside.
But the idea of suicide makes the whole series of things
incomprehensible to me."</p>

<p>"And you think in your theory they become translucent?
Comprehensible? Come, as a favour to me, expound them in that
light."</p>

<p>Wilmot was quite in his element. He always enjoyed a
discussion of theories. He obviously meant what he said. Pointer
was never keen on holding forth, but Wilmot pressed him
again.</p>

<p>"I really should like to know how the facts look in this new
light to your Scotland Yard mind. If you'll excuse me calling it
that. I mean it as a compliment. And after your unkind references
to my biased point of view&mdash;" he laughed and settled his
elbows more comfortably on the coping of the bridge.</p>

<p>"Well, looking on Mrs. Tangye's death as a crime. Always
bearing in mind that that's only a hypothesis as yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I do!"</p>

<p>"The first thing that strikes one is the way she was killed. A
bullet rather suggests, other things being equal, that the
murderer was not a member of her household. Poison is their usual
weapon, in a premeditated crime. Next&mdash;there's been no
effort to mislead the police, or delay the finding out of the
dead woman's identity."</p>

<p>"Granted," Wilmot said at once "identity evidently plays no
part in this sinister affair."</p>

<p>"It may play a part just the same," Pointer demurred. "Its
part may be that the sooner it's known that she's dead, the
better."</p>

<p>"You mean the insurance claim Tangye sent in by the eight
o'clock evening post yesterday?" Wilmot raised an eyebrow
reflectively. "'Pon my word, Pointer, almost thou persuadest
me..."</p>

<p>"The visitor was apparently not one of whom Mrs. Tangye was
frightened. She sends Miss Saunders out on Tuesday. She had sent
Florence out on Monday, the day when, I think, the caller came
the first time. The crime, if I'm right, and there was one, was
too well executed for it to have been planned without a very
careful inspection of the premises. But to continue with Tuesday,
the husband is away from home. Judging by the preparations, the
secret caller is some one Mrs. Tangye is prepared to welcome. The
ample tea and so on. Of course they may merely represent so many
attempts at propitiation. But Mrs. Tangye doesn't look to me like
a woman who would bend easily under pressure."</p>

<p>"It all sounds to me like her cousin," Haviland mused
again.</p>

<p>"But her smart frock?" the Chief Inspector queried, "her
dressed hair? But whether Cousin Oliver or some one else,
obviously the relationship, or tie, between them is not one that
Mrs. Tangye cares to acknowledge. The visitor is to come and go
unseen."</p>

<p>"Supposing&mdash;just for the moment&mdash;that such a being
exists, wouldn't any murderer have taken care to trump up some
specious need for secrecy?" Wilmot pointed out.</p>

<p>"Possibly. But unless the need were real, and affected both, I
should have expected, since she was perfectly mistress of her own
time&mdash;that she would have arranged to meet him elsewhere.
But obviously that might not suit the murderer. One place would
be very unlike another place to him.</p>

<p>"Then the secrecy was more important to her than to him, in
your fascinating, but to me, quite impossible melodrama?"</p>

<p>Pointer thought not.</p>

<p>"As a rule, when it's only to one person's interest that so
much trouble be taken, the other person, the one not so vitally
concerned, makes some slip, that gives the whole show away. None
has been made here. On either side. Mrs. Tangye seems to've taken
as much care beforehand that nothing should be known about a
caller coming in by the garden, as he takes afterwards to be sure
that he's left no trace."</p>

<p>"There wasn't a mark of finger-print in that room that didn't
belong there," Haviland said earnestly.</p>

<p>Pointer felt sure of this.</p>

<p>"The visitor whom I'm imagining," Pointer went on, "came in
the day-time. On a Tuesday. Though in winter Mrs. Tangye's
generally alone over the week-ends. Choosing the day-time looks
to me as though he were either married, or lived in chambers, or
at an hotel, or some place where his comings and goings at night
might be noticed. As to the day of the week, that looks as if
time pressed, and he couldn't wait till the next week-end."</p>

<p>"What about the past week-end?" Wilmot asked, "and even if it
were any one in the house&mdash;mind, I don't believe for a
moment in your theory&mdash;they might well be too shrewd to
choose the night. Rather a home-made look about a job done
then."</p>

<p>Wilmot had a wide experience of murder cases. Wider even than
Pointer's. For Wilmot was only called in to take or
make&mdash;<i>causes clbres.</i></p>

<p>"They could have faked a burglary," Haviland suggested. "Good
faking is an art not acquired in one night," Wilmot pointed
out.</p>

<p>"Suppose we say that hole is halved," Pointer suggested. "But
was it Mrs. Tangye, or this mysterious visitor of hers that made
her leave nothing among her papers bearing on her own affairs? Or
is their absence unconnected with her death?" He was asking
himself the question. "At any rate her visitor belongs, or came
into her life, before she went to France. Before she corrected
herself of being left-handed. Apparently he has not seen her in
the meantime, since she's trained herself out of it. Offhand one
would say some old lover cropped up...And that, I think, is as
far as mere deduction takes us."</p>

<p>"It could scarcely carry you much further unless you assisted
it with a crystal ball, and a Ouija board," Wilmot murmured.</p>

<p>"Except," Pointer was impervious to sarcasm when he chose,
"that no sounds whatever were heard from the morning-room. Which
looks as though there had been no unexpected entrance of still
another person, a third party, who was not in the secret."</p>

<p>"Of course, Tangye being out, Miss Saunders out, and the
servants having their own tea shut away in their quarters, that
doesn't mean much in fact," Haviland murmured. "But the room, and
Mrs. Tangye herself&mdash;no, sir! There was no sign of any sort
of trouble to be seen."</p>

<p>"Just so. We may take it that there was only one visitor. Some
one whom she thought a friend. But who was not. Some one who
profited by her death. For it was a deliberate crime&mdash;if a
crime."</p>

<p>"You should write novels," Wilmot scoffed.</p>

<p>"Ah, I said this was only theory&mdash;speculation. Like some
of your articles."</p>

<p>"Quite so. But I live by my fancies, whereas I thought you at
the Yard depended on footing the solid earth for your daily
bread. And once again, what about the woman who came at six, and
said she was frightfully late? It looks as though in your
solution of the problem A and B would have to meet 'Which is
absurd.' According to your own premises, I maintain that there
was only one caller at Riverview yesterday. The woman whom
Florence showed in. Or do you suggest that Mrs. Tangye was
playing the part of Providence to a young couple? And the
gentleman arriving first, shoots her as a lesson not to
meddle?"</p>

<p>"I don't think Mrs. Tangye would have put herself out to such
an extent for any mere friend. For anything but sheer
necessity."</p>

<p>"Then your theory exonerates Tangye&mdash;I mean, if it's a
fact that there's a criminal here?" Haviland asked. "Though, as a
matter of fact, there can't be, sir! You must excuse me, but I
can't see it your way."</p>

<p>"So much the better! If I'm right you'll come round, both of
you. If I'm wrong, there's only one misled. As to Tangye&mdash;it
could have been an accomplice of his. Though I see no reason for
that thought, and many objections. Still, it could have
been."</p>

<p>"And where's Miss Saunders in this most bewildering dream of
your's?" Pointer laughed; he knew Wilmot would ask that.</p>

<p>"She's outside. Not inside."</p>

<p>"Really? Like the late caller, eh? Forgive the question, but
are all the facts of the case going to be outside your
theory?"</p>

<p>Pointer only made a good-humoured gesture of not being able to
tell yet.</p>

<p>"You'll have to keep her outside," Wilmot warned him in mock
anxiety, "because otherwise she blows it sky-high."</p>

<p>"She does," Pointer agreed. "My theory presupposes no inside
helper except Mrs. Tangye herself."</p>

<p>"Well, a suicide verdict doesn't fall to pieces because of the
companion," Wilmot murmured in high good humour, "personally, I
welcome her as a human note. So you call a 'theory' something
that begins in smoke and ends in mythical steps heard by a couple
of hysterical maids?"</p>

<p>"They struck me as very truthful young women. Don't run down
the only corroboration I've got so far as to the existence of
that unknown visitor! As I see it," Pointer watched the river as
though he did see 'it,' and only 'it' in the running water, "some
one came into that morning-room by the long windows yesterday
just after four. Came in, after having been to the house the day
before, and laid his plans. Came in after having possibly
followed her about in the garden until the flash of light from
Florence's pantry warned him that he might be seen. Very likely
he had overlooked that little slit high up in the ivy. But
afterwards&mdash;after he came in&mdash;" Pointer fell
silent.</p>

<p>"It sounds most alluring. Most dramatic! But no, no! I can't
see," Wilmot prodded the air with his cigarette to accentuate
each word, "no, I cannot see how there's the possibility of foul
play here. Mrs. Tangye in her own home&mdash;a good
shot&mdash;the bell to her hand&mdash;her maids within
call&mdash;her finger-prints on her revolver&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"And Miss Saunders..." Pointer said again, "is she shielding
some one? If the latter, what is the motive? Love?"</p>

<p>"Of lying," Wilmot finished cynically.</p>

<p>Pointer laughed, but refused to believe that here they had an
example of art for art's sake.</p>

<p>"I had thought when I read about that visitor in the reports
on the inquest that Miss Saunders might be shielding her, but
assuming her ignorance about the lady's departure to be honest,
and I do, it looks as though she might be shielding Tangye. And
that fits in with another impression left by her evidence. An
impression as though she had been more guarded when Haviland
first tackled her yesterday than she was this morning, or at the
inquest."</p>

<p>"And that's a fact," Haviland agreed, "though it's generally
the other way around. People generally come out in black and
white first of all, and then begin to tone 'em down, and mix one
in with the other, as they think things over and get qualms. But
not Miss Saunders. It was yesterday she was careful. Didn't want
to come down hard on any statement as it were. But this morning
everything was sharp and clear. No more 'I thinks' nor 'to the
best of my beliefs,' about her to-day. And I wonder why she won't
stop at Riverview at night..."</p>

<p>"Fear," Pointer said briefly. "She's afraid. She wanted to
accept that preposterous offer I made on your behalf, but
wouldn't."</p>

<p>"You think she's afraid of Tangye?" Wilmot asked. "Queer!"</p>

<p>"Her being afraid of Tangye," Pointer went on thoughtfully,
"shows that he either is, or she thinks he is, at least connected
with his wife's death."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," Haviland said slowly, "that's what I
thought as I watched her. That she was afraid, I mean. And I
should think that's another essential in the case?"</p>

<p>Haviland eyed Pointer.</p>

<p>"Not if she's wrong. And she may be. Only time&mdash;and
Tangye&mdash;will show. As Miss Saunders' evidence is so strongly
on his side, it looks as though they might have made a bargain
with each other. If so, in some way, the lost keys are mixed up
in it. He and she both jib at those keys. Neither has made any
effort to have them found. The maids were unaware of their
loss."</p>

<p>"They both claim the keys are unimportant," Haviland reminded
him.</p>

<p>"They do. And they both look uneasy when they're mentioned. At
least Tangye does, always. And Miss Saunders was more than uneasy
that time when I made her think Tangye had connected her with
their loss."</p>

<p>"Well! Well! Well!" murmured Wilmot with gusto. "I still don't
see any sign of a crime materialising, but you do give a glimpse
into a very intriguing little family circle. But speaking about
that visitor, how did she get out? That still remains as great a
puzzle as ever."</p>

<p>Haviland promptly solved it for him.</p>

<p>"There's a cupboard in Mr. Tangye's room where overcoats and
golf-clubs and such things hang. The back of it is really a door
we found just now, leading out by the tradesman's gate. I didn't
notice it yesterday, for I didn't search the house. I'm afraid I
took her leaving a bit for granted in fact."</p>

<p>"You think she got out that way?" Wilmot asked. "If so, that
would show?"</p>

<p>Pointer answered for Haviland, who was not quite certain what
it ought to reveal by Scotland Yard standards of divination.</p>

<p>"For one thing that the caller who was mistaken for Mrs.
Cranbourn, knew the house."</p>

<p>"Whew-w-w!" whistled Wilmot, "bloweth the wind that way?"</p>

<p>"Which way, Mr. Wilmot?" Haviland asked with a furrowed
brow.</p>

<p>"Secret passages&mdash;vanishing ladies&mdash;gent's smoke-room&mdash;Sultan's favourite&mdash;that way. The way of the film
vamp. Are you going in for the mysteries of Udolpho, Pointer? If
so, I get off here and now. Architectural details always bore me
to tears. There's no scope for the brain in that sort of
thing."</p>

<p>"There's plenty of scope for any brains in this," Pointer
reassured him. "For all of ours. Even for yours, Wilmot." But the
newspaper man shook his head.</p>

<p>"I ought to've refused the job. It's quite out of my line.
This hunting for clues...The Insurance Company ought to've sent
down a retriever dog, not me!"</p>

<p>Pointer burst out laughing, so did Haviland, and so, after a
moment's gloom, did Wilmot himself.</p>

<p>"Think so? Could Fido tell me why Miss Saunders gave no
thought as to how that visitor got out? I think her bewilderment
was genuine. What has been occupying her mind so intently that
there was neither time nor room in it to spare? What's she been
so busy over? I really think that's more in your line than
Fido's, Wilmot. So, don't let them exchange you for him yet
awhile."</p>

<p>"But I'm no good at this game," Wilmot protested. "You, as
becomes a C.I.D. man, can't be happy without a crime to unearth.
While I, for the life of me, am unable to even see the
possibility of one here." He, too, spoke very seriously now.
Seriously and thoughtfully. "I see odd trifles such as must
generally accompany accidents or sudden deaths one would imagine.
When the roof's torn off a man's house. But no more. For one
thing, to me that revolver having been fired by Mrs. Tangye's
left hand seems conclusive."</p>

<p>"It's the Insurance Company's best trump, I agree," Pointer
said handsomely. "Yes, it's odd. Very."</p>

<p>"I don't call it odd. I call it an impossibility unless her
death was either self-inflicted or due to an accident. For it
clearly marks emotion. And as such is of great weight in proving
a suicide, and not out of place in asserting an accident. But it
couldn't exist&mdash;couldn't&mdash;in a murder. For I should
like to remind you, Pointer, that there are such things as
genuine suicides, and genuine accidents. Though they don't seem
to've come your way. That Charteris tangle coming on top of the
Eames Erskine Case has put your eye out."</p>

<p>"Very possibly. But your clever criminal always stages the
effect of either accident or suicide. Preferably the former.
Don't forget that either. You know as well as we do that not
every case is docketed at the Yard under the label which the
coroner's verdict hangs on it."</p>

<p>Wilmot did know.</p>

<p>"And that's a fact," murmured Haviland fervently. "Speaking of
doors, Mr. Wilmot, that door found leading out of Tangye's
smoking-room...Well, what leads out of a thing, leads into it
too!"</p>

<p>"And that's a fact," Wilmot quoted gravely.</p>

<p>"Of course it may mean nothing. In fact, I still don't see how
there's a crime here, for Mrs. Tangye would have rung that bell
quick as light if any unauthorised person had come into the
morning-room."</p>

<p>Wilmot sighed.</p>

<p>"Entrances&mdash;exits&mdash;butter on fingers&mdash;Fido's
job!" he murmured disconsolately. "But supposing this were a
crime&mdash;which I'm perfectly satisfied it's not&mdash;on the
evidence so far, that is to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perfectly satisfied? Is that the Insurance Company speaking?"
Pointer imitated a telephone call.</p>

<p>Wilmot grinned.</p>

<p>"Fairly satisfied then. A nice look-out for us it would be!
Not the ghost of a hope of catching the criminal."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't bank on that," Pointer said tranquilly.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that you believe we could catch a criminal
with nothing more to start on than the little we've got hold of
so far?" Wilmot's tone showed his incredulity. Yet he was a firm
believer in New Scotland Yard. In the will to win of the quiet
men trained there. And among these men Pointer had risen high and
swiftly. Wilmot wondered if more had reached the ears of the
C.I.D. than of the police.</p>

<p>"Routine does a lot," Pointer murmured placidly.</p>

<p>Wilmot laughed outright.</p>

<p>"I feel like Watson's youngest bady in the arms of the mighty
Sherlock. Do you mean to tell me, seriously, that without the
person who killed Mrs. Tangye&mdash;you quite understand that my
acceptance of his, or her, existence is purely academic, and
solely for the purposes of discussion&mdash;without his making
one false step, you could hope to bring home this crime? I'd be
willing to bet a thousand pounds it couldn't be done."</p>

<p>"You'd lose, Mr. Wilmot," Haviland said loyally. But he, too,
had his doubts. He knew Pointer's record. But every man makes
mistakes sometimes. The Chief Inspector was a favourite with
those who worked under him. He was probity itself, unassuming,
open-minded, quick, accurate, and absolutely untirable once he
had set out on a trail. But he was no wizard. Haviland wondered
uneasily if this case might not be going to be one of the Yard's
few blunders. Somehow, Haviland could not say how, he felt that
Wilmot might have less science, less determination, but more
luck. It was not the way by which Wilmot considered that his past
triumphs had been won. But allowance must be made for <i>esprit
de corps.</i></p>

<p>"If I'm right, then it's the one false step he's already taken
which ought to do the trick," Pointer said grimly. "He's killed.
And unless it's an entirely motiveless crime, a homicidal
impulse&mdash;killed for a reason. In the case of a lunatic, I
grant you, the best detective outside of a book, might not be
able to do his duty. But if a motive once existed, it can be
found again. It exists as much as a lump of concrete exists. It's
better evidence. For it's indestructible.</p>

<p>"Of course," Wilmot mused. "I agree that once a man commits a
crime, he sets machinery in motion which he can't stop without
showing himself in the effort. For he's part of it. But what if
he's too clever to make any move?"</p>

<p>He shook his head at the prospect of the law in such a case.
So did Haviland.</p>

<p>Pointer's face hardened. "Murderers always think that if they
can plan their crimes cleverly enough, they can get away with it.
My whole life is based on the conviction that you <i>can't</i>
have a premeditated crime with a motive so clever that it can't
be found out, and traced home. Unless there's a slip in the
handling of the investigations. The murderer gambles on that
slip, that's all."</p>

<p>"I wonder!" Wilmot weighed the thought in his mental balance,
then shook his head.</p>

<p>"Speaking of facts," Haviland suggested, "if we could find a
few more. That cleaned-off safe door was odd. That smoking-room
exit very handy. Still, they don't prove anything. Mr. Tangye's
alibi seems very sound."</p>

<p>Pointer shook out the dottle from his pipe.</p>

<p>"Time's up. We had better return to the house. After that, I,
or rather you, Wilmot, have an appointment with Stewart, he's the
Tangyes' family solicitor as well as the Coroner, you know. And
then you got Miss Eden to give you an appointment over the
telephone for later in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Miss Eden?"</p>

<p>"The friend with whom Mrs. Tangye spent the greater part of
Sunday at Tunbridge Wells. She's up for the inquest and the
funeral. I doubt though, if it will be easy to learn anything
fresh from her&mdash;judging by her deposition."</p>

<p>"Sorry," Wilmot said apologetically, "but you'll have to
deputise for me. I seem to've made double engagements for this
afternoon. So, unless you would like to write my next article,
and send in half a column of your opinion on the new
Opera&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer declined with a laugh.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>

<p class="first">
POINTER stepped in for a moment with Haviland at the police
station. He wanted the photographs of the revolver. They were
ready for him. An Inspector hurried in. "Mr. Tangye's been
telephoning, sir. He says he's gone over his wife's papers, and
finds there's a large sum of money missing from the house.
Fifteen hundred pounds. Says it must have been at Riverview
yesterday."</p>

<p>"This does alter things for a fact!" Haviland jumped up with
the eyes of a good watch dog who hears some one on the step. Was
it possible that facts, real facts, facts which you could marshal
and exhibit, were going to bear out the Chief Inspector's
fantastic idea?</p>

<p>They telephoned the news on to Wilmot, and walked quickly up
to Riverview. Tangye was waiting for them. He looked both angry
and uneasy. Taking them into his study he closed the door, and
rapidly amplified his message.</p>

<p>It seemed that Mrs. Tangye had employed a separate firm of
solicitors for the management of her property. Sladen and Sladen
of Baker Street. Tangye said that he himself knew nothing of her
estate. Had always refused to know. But on going over the papers
which the firm had sent him, he had found that half of a sum paid
her during the past fortnight was missing.</p>

<p>"Like her keys," Pointer reflected aloud, and Tangye turned a
swift, wary, glance on him. But he answered impatiently:</p>

<p>"The keys are of no importance. A sum of money is a different
thing. It seems she sold a farm over a week ago for three
thousand pounds. The money was paid in at her solicitor's office,
and remained there till yesterday. But just after two, Mrs.
Tangye drove up in a taxi, without an appointment, and took the
whole amount away with her. She was paid in bank-notes. Half of
those notes are missing."</p>

<p>"Bank-notes? Why not a cheque, sir?"</p>

<p>Tangye explained that his wife had had an invincible dislike
to cheques. A bank had once failed, leaving her with an uncashed,
worthless cheque. Since then, all her transactions had been
strictly in notes.</p>

<p>"Well, of course," Haviland repeated, taking down the numbers
of the notes, "this does alter things, for a fact."</p>

<p>"Not in the essentials. Mrs. Tangye's death was an accident.
Couldn't of course have been anything else," Tangye said shortly,
"but that missing sum may have been stolen."</p>

<p>"She would keep the money in her safe, I suppose?" Pointer
suggested.</p>

<p>"She might have."</p>

<p>"You think the loss was unconnected with her death?"</p>

<p>"Obviously. But how many people would you trust in a house
with the mistress dead, and a wad of notes like that?" Pointer
and Haviland nodded their agreement with the only possible answer
to this question.</p>

<p>"But what makes you think your wife had not invested the money
in some way? She might have posted that fifteen hundred off at
any time between two and the hour she returned to
Riverview&mdash;about four."</p>

<p>"I've always seen to her investments. Why should she pay a
stockbroker's charges when she could get it done for
nothing?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she wanted a bit of a flutter with it, and did not
like to you know. There's a tremendous boom in cotton just
starting."</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose Sladen and I have 'phoned to every inside
and outside man, every bucket-shop in the kingdom, before turning
to you?" Tangye asked impatiently. "No offence, Chief Inspector,
but I'm afraid you're only losing time with your questions. The
best thing for you to do is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For me to decide, sir," Pointer finished very quietly.</p>

<p>Tangye mumbled what was meant for an apology.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can be sure that Mrs. Tangye might not
have gambled in another name," the Scotland Yard official went
on.</p>

<p>"No point in that. She was absolutely her own mistress."</p>

<p>"The exact halving of the money looks as though she had some
definite purpose in view," Pointer went on unruffled.</p>

<p>"And how do you know that none was spent yesterday, sir? A
lady can get rid of a lot of coin in a couple of hours, for a
fact," Haviland said with the gloom of a husband and father, as
he went off to the library to telephone the numbers of the
missing banknotes to his inspector at the police station, with
instructions as to where to try to-night.</p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred pounds!" Tangye repeated the sum under his
breath as though the figures loomed large to him. "It's not the
money in itself. But I don't like to be done. No man does. I
won't be done!"</p>

<p>"It seems quite simple to me," Pointer said mendaciously.
"Those lost keys and the lost money will be found to belong
together. Find who has taken the one, and you'll find who has
taken the other."</p>

<p>He was watching Tangye in the mirrcr, as he seemed engrossed
in getting his pipe to draw better.</p>

<p>Tangye stiffened in his chair.</p>

<p>"Damned nonsense. You must excuse me, Chief Inspector. But
that cock won't fight. Can't. I know those keys are somewhere in
the house, as I told you. On thinking it over, I remember now
quite clearly seeing them myself lying about the place after the
police left. I can't recollect where&mdash;but I know I saw
them."</p>

<p>Pointer dropped the subject of the keys.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tangye," he said instead in a low voice. "You know more
than you're telling us. About this missing money. Or, at least,
you suspect more. You have some reason for feeling so certain it
was stolen."</p>

<p>Tangye's face paled a little. He detached a cigar-band with
extreme care, and laid it on the exact centre of a log, as though
it were a votive offering, and as such had to be presented with
strict conformity to rule.</p>

<p>"Not at all. But my knowledge of my wife's habits makes me
feel sure that Mrs. Tangye had done none of the things with the
money you suggest. I believe it was in the house when she had
that fatal accident. I believe that some one, knowing it was
there, stole it."</p>

<p>Pointer bent forward.</p>

<p>"Whom do you suspect?"</p>

<p>Tangye got up and walked to the window. Drew up the blind with
a snap, and let it down again with a crash. That done, he helped
himself to a stiff drink. Then only did he reply.</p>

<p>"No one. That's what I want you to find out. You're so
extraordinarily interested in Mrs. Tangye's death, which is no
mystery, and perfectly simple&mdash;though God knows it's
terrible enough&mdash;yet, when I hand over to you a genuine
inquiry, you seem to want <i>me</i> to do the work, the
investigation."</p>

<p>Tangye's nerves were evidently strained.</p>

<p>"It's the idea of being done, I can't stand," he said himself,
as though in excuse.</p>

<p>They sat in silence for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"By the way, while the Superintendent is putting one of his
men on to trying the railway stations and other open-all-night
places, I'd like another word with you about Mrs. Tangye's
cousin. We want to be sure he wasn't in touch with her just
before her death."</p>

<p>"You can be sure. They were on anything but a friendly
footing. Naturally. Oliver is a thoroughgoing blackguard. My wife
usually refused to even speak of him. He would hardly venture to
write to her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he might have come."</p>

<p>"Here? To Riverview? I should like to see him dare to show his
face here. I should have had him kicked out inside of ten
seconds, and as for Mrs. Tangye&mdash;! I suppose you know
something of his record?"</p>

<p>Pointer only confessed to an extreme interest to learn it.</p>

<p>"He was sent down from Oxford. Cheating at cards. He's been
auctioneer's clerk, sailor, orchid-hunter, and rumrunner since
then."</p>

<p>"You feel quite certain that he had not written to Mrs. Tangye
in all these years? She was his only relative." Tangye sat,
apparently thinking back.</p>

<p>"'Pon my word! I wonder if he could have had the collossal
nerve! She used to say that he could blarney a cannibal. You know
that he once got Branscombe to give him some money for a fresh
start? Oliver started all right&mdash;drug-smuggling to the
Bantus. Mrs. Tangye stopped the supplies as soon as she learnt of
it."</p>

<p>"Was there anything odd about his appearance? I mean anything
that would attract attention? Stick in the memory? Been easily
recognised again?"</p>

<p>"Yes to all the list. Unforgettable sort of face. Bird of
prey, yet clever! Then he was immensely tall and thin."</p>

<p>"Had he a limp?"</p>

<p>"He hadn't when I saw him, but if the rumour's true I heard
some years back that he was gun-running for the Riffs, I should
think it probable that he has one by now."</p>

<p>Pointer got as detailed an account of the missing man as
Tangye's remembrance could supply. He asked if Miss Saunders
might join them for a moment.</p>

<p>She came in with her quick, silent step, which yet conveyed no
suggestion of lightness.</p>

<p>Pointer watched her in the mirror, his back to the door, as
she entered. She flashed a swift glance first at him and then at
Tangye. That glance was unmistakable to the eyes on her. It was a
confederate's glance.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong?" was telegraphed as clearly as though ticked
out in Morse. So these two were partners, at least for the time
being. At any rate in something. Tangye's eyes avoided hers.</p>

<p>Turning, Pointer explained the circumstances of the missing
money to her. He noticed that Tangye waited for him to do this.
She looked startled and uneasy, and something else that even
Pointer could not decipher, it was so quickly repressed. Pointer
thought that she seemed inclined to doubt the whole story until
she heard of the solicitor from whose offices Mrs. Tangye had
taken the money only yesterday.</p>

<p>She then said that Mrs. Tangye must have banked it, or used it
in some way. Tangye retorted that that was what they all thought.
He looked at the woman with a lowering stare.</p>

<p>"Do you want us to list the money under 'missing or stolen,'
or only under 'stolen'?" Haviland asked returning to the
room.</p>

<p>Tangye started a little.</p>

<p>"Under 'missing or stolen,'" he said after moment's thought.
It was the most natural form where a doubt existed. But it was
also the only form which would let Tangye stop the inquiries
should he later find, or pretend to find the money. Once entered
as <i>Stolen,</i> only an order from the Home Office could check
the search being carried through to the bitter end.</p>

<p>Did Tangye know this?</p>

<p>Pointer let Haviland do the talking, while he sat apparently
listening. In reality observing. He noticed again how little the
stockbroker turned to him. He made Tangye uneasy in some way.
What way? And he made him more uneasy now that he was talking of
the missing money. Why?</p>

<p>And again why did Tangye try so hard to pull himself together
during this talk. Each time that he was on the point of being
natural, would come some evident effort.</p>

<p>Evident to Pointer's observant eyes, that he was anxious to
make no slip. What sort of a slip? But he seemed genuinely eager
that the money should be traced. Eager, and yet cautious. Who was
he shielding or prepared to shield? The Chief Inspector
speculated on the new turn the case had taken. Was it an honest
turn? Fifteen hundred pounds in the house Tuesday afternoon. Was
that connected with the death of Mrs. Tangye or was it but a
coincidence? Certainly his idea of a crime was not weakened by
this new piece of intelligence. There came another thought. This
lost money fitted in so well with his theory of an outsider, was
it possible that that was Tangye's aim? What if he too knew of
the unknown's existence, was in league with him, feared lest the
police had learnt of his visit, and with the guilty man's haste
to cover even non-existent tracks&mdash;had invented the lost
money as a pretext for the stranger's visit?</p>

<p>But the longer Pointer studied the man talking to the keenly
interested Haviland, the more he decided that Tangye's emotion
about the loss was genuine. That Tangye was trying to repress,
not to force, the note on this point. He acted to the very keen,
trained eye of the detective officer like a man much more
concerned in the matter than he cared to show. On this came the
reflection that possibly Tangye had wanted the whole 3,000 so
badly that he had had a hand in his wife's death. A hand so
carefully concealed that now, little by little, he could venture
to direct the search towards it. Was it a case of a criminal
having been "done" by his accomplice, and trying to get that
accomplice caught? Tangye's frequent use of the word suggested
this. So did his manner. By what he did not say, as much as by
what he did. Pointer believed that for some reason he dared not
be more explicit. Yet Tangye was emphatically not a man to be
frightened of shadows. A stockbroker must have good nerves.</p>

<p>Rising, Pointer asked Miss Saunders to come into the drawing-room. He closed the door with ostentatious care. It gave a
confidential suggestion.</p>

<p>"Miss Saunders," Pointer spoke very low, "there seems to me,
quite frankly to be something rather&mdash;well&mdash;odd, about
this claim of Mr. Tangye to that fifteen hundred pounds. What do
you think yourself?"</p>

<p>"Of course it isn't lost," she spoke shortly, and with a note
of anger in her thin voice. "Mrs. Tangye's invested it somewhere
that they haven't found yet. That's all."</p>

<p>"It's very perplexing," he said a little dismally, "very
perplexing, indeed. Did you make any arrangements on Monday as to
where you intended to go from here?" he asked in the same
breath.</p>

<p>She had not expected that question. She all but jumped.</p>

<p>"I don't understand. Going from here? Monday? It was only Mrs.
Tangye's death yesterday that made me decide to go to my
sister's."</p>

<p>"You had your trunk brought down in the morning?"</p>

<p>"I thought Mrs. Tangye's idea of sending some clothes to the
poor an excellent one," she said sweetly. "I intended to do the
same."</p>

<p>"I see. Now, do you mind telling me where you were last
Sunday? This lost money puts the case in our hands, and we've a
regular routine to work through."</p>

<p>"Where was I last Sunday?" She turned a watchful eye on him.
"At church, part of the time."</p>

<p>"It's the remaining part I want to hear about," he said
lightly, "you left here, at what hour?"</p>

<p>"In time for the eleven o'clock service. After that I stayed
with a friend. And we took the children to one of the museums by
way of a treat."</p>

<p>"Could I have the name of the friend?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't think of dragging her into this sad business."</p>

<p>"And in the evening?"</p>

<p>"I spent helping her. She put me up."</p>

<p>"And Monday?"</p>

<p>"We spent shopping."</p>

<p>"For the children too, I suppose?" he said gravely.</p>

<p>A light flickered in her eyes. It looked like amusement.</p>

<p>"You might be a family man yourself," she murmured ironically.
The door opened. But why had Tangye stopped outside to listen
first? He glanced in airily.</p>

<p>"Oh! Sorry to interrupt. I was afraid you had gone, Chief
Inspector."</p>

<p>"No, I was saying to Miss Saunders that with such a sum in the
house why of course we have to ask a number of fresh
questions."</p>

<p>"But who would steal bank-notes?" Miss Saunders asked
pertinently.</p>

<p>"When did you last see Mrs. Tangye at her safe?"</p>

<p>"Many months ago I saw her lay some books in it. She used it
as a sort of cupboard at times. It was always unlocked."</p>

<p>"Could it be locked?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." She turned to Tangye, whose jaw shot
forward.</p>

<p>"Of course it could be," the master of the house said
briefly.</p>

<p>"And the key was on her key-ring, I suppose?" Pointer,
continued.</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"Then the missing keys might be important, after all."</p>

<p>Tangye said nothing. Miss Saunders brushed the top of the
marble mantelpiece with her hand. She, too, said nothing.</p>

<p>"Florence saw them at four on her mistress's desk," Pointer
went on.</p>

<p>"So she says." Miss Saunders' tone was contemptuous. "You seem
to attach great weight to a maid-servant's word&mdash;almost as
great as to a reporter's!"</p>

<p>"As a rule, neither have anything to gain by mis-statements in
a case of this kind," he said blandly. "You didn't happen to
notice them in the room on your return from the library? I mean,
before Florence came in?"</p>

<p>Tangye started. He cast a quick, furtive, look at Pointer and
then at the woman.</p>

<p>"No," Miss Saunders said very composedly. "I do not think they
were there then."</p>

<p>Pointer was apparently bending over a table near him, but he
saw the hard, suspicious stare that Tangye gave the speaker. She
returned it with something of defiance. There was a silence which
the detective officer did not break. Here was no love affair, he
thought. Whatever had been in the past, these two did not like,
did not trust, each other now.</p>

<p>He wondered why Tangye seemed so unwilling to link the lost
keys with the lost money. The stockbroker did not strike him as a
clever man outside of his own walk of life. If there. Though
Pointer had a feeling, had had it from the first, that Tangye's
path was beset&mdash;at least to the man's own
thinking&mdash;with pitfalls. That he was afraid of saying one
unweighed word, one hasty conclusion.</p>

<p>"She invested it, you may be sure," Regina Saunders said,
turning towards the door, "but it's most distressing for every
one until it's found. Olive's already given notice. Florence
wants to leave when she does. Cook's looking out for a new post.
I'm afraid, Mr. Tangye, that you won't be able to keep the house
running many more days." She left them at that, with a cool nod
apiece. Tangye looked after her without saying anything. There
was a set to his full mouth which was not easy to read.</p>

<p>"I should like to see the maids, please&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>Olive came in first. She had told Pointer already that she had
not seen the keys since just before lunch yesterday, and then in
Mrs. Tangye's hands. Mrs. Tangye was in her bedroom at the time
talking to Miss Saunders.</p>

<p>He had not asked for further details then. Now, he did. Olive
was quite sure that she had heard the door of the safe shut and
locked as she went on down the stairs, dusting the banisters. No
other lock in the house sounded like a safe lock, she maintained,
and Pointer privately agreed with her. Miss Saunders and Mrs.
Tangye had passed her a moment later, going in to their
lunch.</p>

<p>"Had they been quarrelling, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Tangye was looking quite calm. She was
saying something like 'I can't help that, Miss Saunders. By this
evening, if you please.'"</p>

<p>"And Miss Saunders?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she said nothing, sir. But she gave her a look as she
stepped behind her for to pass. It was a look that said 'Just you
wait; my lady!' if ever one did."</p>

<p>"Mustn't make too much out of a glance, Olive," Pointer said
lightly.</p>

<p>"But you see, sir, Miss Saunders&mdash;she has a way of
getting even with you. You can't tell yourself how she does it.
If the mistress had lived&mdash;but there!" Olive stopped herself
or tried to, then she burst out, "If Mrs. Tangye had lived, Miss
Saunders wouldn't be acting as if <i>she</i> was mistress here.
But there!" Again she pulled herself up. "We're leaving. It won't
matter to Flo and me."</p>

<p>"Why are you leaving?"</p>

<p>Her voice faltered.</p>

<p>"I can't stand it, sir. I'm not so sure as I was that it was
an accident. The more I thinks it over the more I feel as though
there was something&mdash;something&mdash;not quite right about
the mistress's end, sir. It's thinking about those footsteps does
it."</p>

<p>"You've no other reason for leaving?"</p>

<p>"I've nothing to complain of, sir. But how can I stay on in a
house where there's a room I can't abear to enter, and a garden I
can't pass through without it gives me a turn."</p>

<p>"The garden too?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir! I never go through it without hearing those
footsteps coming up behind me same as they come up behind the
poor mistress. Seems as though they was after me too."</p>

<p>Looking at her pale face, Pointer thought it high time that
she left.</p>

<p>"Have you any place in your mind?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, Florence thinks&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm quite sure she does. And so does Cook. But I want to know
what <i>you</i> are going to do."</p>

<p>"I'm to go to Lady Ash, sir, and Flo is to come too, later on.
It was Miss Barbara as settled it. I'm glad to be going there.
There won't be nothing to be frightened of in a house where Miss
Barbara is."</p>

<p>"Ash? Wasn't that the name of the partner of Mr. Branscombe,
Mrs. Tangye's first husband?"</p>

<p>"That's the lady, sir. They live just over the bridge in Kew.
She's a friend of Mrs. Tangye's. But Miss Barbara, she never
comes here. She's on the committee of the G.F.S. That's how I
know her. She's a dear, Miss Barbara is I I'm going at the end of
the week."</p>

<p>"Miss Saunders is leaving Riverview too, I understand?" Olive
looked surprised.</p>

<p>"Florence thinks&mdash;" she caught herself up and laughed for
the first time since Pointer had heard her.</p>

<p>"To think of not being allowed to speak of me own sister, sir!
But that's Flo on the stairs now."</p>

<p>She really had quick ears. And accurate ones. Florence stepped
in a moment later, and took her place.</p>

<p>"It's a dreadful idea about some money being missing, sir,"
she began earnestly, "I don't like to stay in a place where
there's been a loss like that. None of us do. But what had we
ought to do, sir?"</p>

<p>Pointer advised her to stay on until she could go to her next
place.</p>

<p>"No one suspects you, or any of the servants," he reassured
her, keeping the qualifying "so far" to himself. "But Florence,
there's something that may have a bearing on this money, which
you haven't told us."</p>

<p>"I, sir? Oh, I'm sure I've told you everything I could think
of!"</p>

<p>Pointer hoped she had not been quite so thorough as that.
"It's about this quarrel between Mrs. and Mr. Tangye on Monday
when he didn't stay to dinner."</p>

<p>"But there wasn't any quarrel, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there was! Over&mdash;well, to be quite frank with
you, I wouldn't say this to every one, mind, we heard it was over
some one&mdash;a gentleman&mdash;whom Mrs. Tangye had known
before, who used to write to her, and meet her now and then on
the quiet."</p>

<p>Pointer looked inquiringly at Florence. She was shocked. "Oh,
sir what a thing to say! And Mrs. Tangye not even buried yet!"
Apparently there was a close time for scandal.</p>

<p>"We know she wasn't very fond of her husband," Pointer spoke
as though half sorry for what he had said.</p>

<p>"Then you know more'n me, begging your pardon. Anyway, that's
no reason for thinking <i>that</i> of her. She wasn't that sort.
Not at all!"</p>

<p>"Yet there was a quarrel," Pointer spoke as though he knew
what he was only guessing. "Was it connected with Miss Saunders,
do you think? We've been told that Mrs. Tangye was sometimes a
little jealous of her."</p>

<p>"My goodness! Whatever for?" Florence opened amazed eyes.
"Why, Mrs. Tangye was twenty times handsomer! And whatever her
faults, the mistress had a heart. Miss Saunders hasn't any heart.
Cruel unkind she can be, if she thinks she dare."</p>

<p>"Oh, we were told that Mr. Tangye&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you believe all you're told, sir," she said earnestly.
Pointer kept his grave face. "There was nothing of that kind. At
least I think so. I mean, I think not." Florence's tone showed
that the idea was new to her.</p>

<p>"Then what did Mr. and Mrs. Tangye quarrel about on Monday
afternoon? It was a very violent one. He struck her!&mdash;"
Pointer went on in a low voice. Florence jumped.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir! Never! The master wouldn't do such a thing.
Besides, it was she who was so angry. He kept trying to pacify
her." Florence put her hand to her mouth. Too late. Then she
began to cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't do anything to make things worse for any one,"
she sobbed. "And it hadn't anything to do with her accident the
next day, nor to do with this missing money, sir. It hadn't
really!"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, if we knew that for certain&mdash;" Pointer
said in an undecided tone, "of course if we could be sure it had
nothing to do with the case why, that might be different. But
you're certain it wasn't <i>he</i> who was in a rage?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir. That he wasn't! He never is!"</p>

<p>"But you told me that there was no quarrel at all between
them? How can I believe you now?"</p>

<p>Pointer did not speak angrily. Florence was a gentle soul. She
choked.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to make bad trouble worse, sir. But the
mistress did go for the poor master last Monday. She seemed quite
beside herself. Yet just before she spoke to me very quiet, as
she'd been all day long."</p>

<p>Pointer still looked undecided.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, if we knew for certain what the quarrel was
about, and it might not have to be entered at all," he repeated
vaguely, "what exactly did Mrs. Tangye say? But be very careful,
Florence, to only tell what you really heard. Not what you
thought was said."</p>

<p>"I didn't hear anything worth repeating sir. Just half bits
and ends. I wasn't listening, only putting something right on the
tea-tray that had toppled over. I had to wait a moment before I
could come in. The mistress&mdash;it's dreadful to say of her now
she can't ever speak again&mdash;but she was raging wild. 'The
house is mine and I insist on your leaving it,' was the only
sentence I heard. Complete that is. But she never meant it. Fond
of the master she was, and he of her too, in his own way. But she
kept on that he was to leave the house. A thing I shouldn't have
thought she'd have said. He said he was going all right. But he
stayed on for tea after all. So they must have made it up."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Tangye must have said more than one sentence."</p>

<p>"Lots more, sir, but I couldn't give you her exact words. She
said she had come to the limit. That she wasn't going to put up
with things any more. That sort of talk, sir. Not meaning half,
nor a quarter, of what she said."</p>

<p>"And he?"</p>

<p>"He kept his temper wonderful, sir. Kept hushing her. I heard
him say once that she was making mountains out of molehills."</p>

<p>"Didn't he say anything more? I can't believe that there was
no reference to money?"</p>

<p>"I didn't hear none, sir. Nothing but his trying to quiet
her."</p>

<p>"You didn't hear any names? Such as Bligh, for instance?"</p>

<p>Florence shot him a shrewd look.</p>

<p>"No, sir. But I shouldn't have been surprised if I had."</p>

<p>"You don't think it could have been Mrs. Bligh who came to the
house at six yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. I know Mrs. Bligh. She comes now and then to our
best dinner parties. And I didn't make any mistake in the name,
sir. The master read me that telegram, sir. But Cranbourn was the
name the mistress gave. And, besides, she talked about her. Said
as how she didn't want to be interrupted in her talk, as they
hadn't met for so long, Mrs. Cranbourn living in Spain. I can't
make out about that cable, sir. Seems to me most mysterious. It
does indeed."</p>

<p>Pointer went off on another tack.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Tangye, now, did he ever have any friends in to tea
for a chat in his smoking-room?"</p>

<p>"Many a time. Gentlemen only, of course."</p>

<p>"Ah, he'd find that way around to the back gate convenient, I
dare say."</p>

<p>Florence looked puzzled for a moment.</p>

<p>"The master never uses that! The room was the housekeeper's
when old Mrs. and Mr. Branscombe lived here, so I've heard."</p>

<p>"Didn't Mrs. Tangye sometimes use it? Or any friends of
hers?"</p>

<p>Florence thought.</p>

<p>"I don't think so, sir. Though once she showed Miss Eden out
that way the last time she stayed here. It is shorter if you're
in a hurry to get to the telegraph office."</p>

<p>"When was this?"</p>

<p>"About a month ago."</p>

<p>There was another pause. Pointer seemed to have finished. "By
the way, who was it chose the room into which Mrs. Tangye's body
was carried?" he asked conversationally.</p>

<p><i>"She</i> did." This startling reply was explained by
Florences' face of indignation.</p>

<p>"That's no way to treat a corpse, is it, sir? Disgraceful, I
call it. Cook and Olive and me, we've put all the greenery around
we can, but it's not a room fit for a corpse, is it, sir?"
Pointer thanked Florence and pausing for a second outside the den
to hear the two voices within, slipped upstairs into Tangye's
dressing-room. He gave it a quick, but sufficiently thorough
search. In the clothes-basket he found a crumpled silk
handkerchief, which still smelt of ether, and showed marks of
dust. It was Tangye's own handkerchief. It had been used to wipe
the safe. But was it he who had used it? Like everything else, it
was inconclusive.</p>

<p>Pointer slipped downstairs once more, and let himself into the
morning-room. He had "forgotten" to return the key.</p>

<p>He put all thought of the missing notes entirely on one side
for the moment. The death was a fact. They were but a tale told
him, and a tale with many perplexing features. Even granted
moreover, that all was exactly as Tangye said, and even supposing
them to be connected with Mrs. Tangye's death, they did not help
to solve the immediate problem of how the woman had been killed,
supposing the Chief Inspector to be right, and that she had been
killed.</p>

<p>It certainly was going to be a stiff proposition to prove a
crime there; let alone solve it. Hitherto, even when they had
first led the search astray, there had always been some clue, a
match, a print of hand or foot, withered leaves, a smear of
paint, to serve as a kick-off. To start the ball rolling. But if,
as he believed, a murder had been committed here at Riverview,
the criminal had done his work very neatly. No tags had been left
lying about.</p>

<p>In an obvious murder a detective gets a certain amount of help
from the general rule that an inmate of the house stages, or
tries to stage, the effect of an outsider, an outsider that is a
member of the household.</p>

<p>Clues in such cases read in the reverse direction as it were.
But outsider and insider meet and merge in a well-set suicide
scene.</p>

<p>The windows had been found latched by the Superintendent. That
suggested some one in the house. Pointer and he had questioned
Miss Saunders as well as Florence very closely, and both had no
reason to think that the companion was holding anything back when
she said that she had found them closed. If Pointer put a
question mark beside her statement, it was merely because the
woman had been in the room before the alarm was given. Was she an
accomplice? The suicide effect made that doubtful. This was not a
death by force, but by cunning. Mrs. Tangye had not been
overpowered. That was certain. But out-witted in some way. So
Pointer believed. Nor did the manner of death chosen suggest an
accomplice.</p>

<p>Supposing she had 'been killed. How could it have been done?
Swiftly he went over the room piece by piece. Still he found
nothing suspicious. Finally he took out a couple of photographs
which Rogers, the constable, had handed him at the police
station. They were the enlargements of the marks on the revolver,
and of Mrs. Tangye's finger-prints. He studied the latter first
of all. They were certainly wonderfully clear. They had been made
by Mrs. Tangye's left hand. There was no doubt of that. Her hand
had been so greasy that it had left a perfect impression even of
the palm. Yet there was a fitted basin with hot and cold water
beside the morning-room. Was it likely that a woman&mdash;a
lady&mdash;would sit still with fingers as buttery as a new cat's
paws, and not wash them? Wilmot's suggestion of a slip and a
hasty grab, did not explain this&mdash;supposing she intended to
live. Of course if Wilmot and Haviland were right, Mrs. Tangye
might have been so lost in brooding thoughts as to be
inaccessible to material things. But the plate on the tea-table
with its neat little lake of congealed butter did not bear out
the idea of an accident.</p>

<p>The enlargements showed that his keen eyes had been right. The
grip was a most singular one. The tips had clutched the revolver
no harder than the palm of the hand. If as hard. But Pointer
could not believe that such a shock as a bullet through the heart
sends to every atom of the body, would not have contracted the
hand sharply. Here, all had been even&mdash;flaccid. The only
really strong pressure shown had been made by the palm and the
bases of the fingers.</p>

<p>Pointer could think of but one explanation to that. An
explanation so terrible that he must make sure that it really was
the only one. Or at least, as sure as possible.</p>

<p>He looked long at his boot-tips. Then he studied the
photographs again. But this time of the scratches on the
revolver. They looked freshly made. Though in a weapon kept in a
closed box that might not mean much. Apparently at some time or
other the weapon had been bounced up and down among a lot of
metal oddments. But that is not usually a Webley's fate, even
unloaded. Nor did they look erratic enough for that. The
enlargements showed him that two small marks were exactly
duplicated on both sides. And the trigger had a central rake
which did not extend to the bevelled edge. But for the finger-prints, it looked as though the trigger had been fired by some
mechanical means. He thought of the missing key-ring. The mark on
the trigger could well have been made by a ring snapped back.</p>

<p>But apart from probability, was there even the possibility of
such a plan as that would mean, having been carried out here? The
marks on the Webley puzzled Pointer, but not so much as the fact
that it had been fired actually touching the woman's dress,
pressed against her breast. This was the real kernel of the
problem. How could a revolver have been got as near as that by
any hand but her own, without alarming Mrs. Tangye? Haviland and
Wilmot were one in saying that here lay the proof of accident, or
suicide. And to crown all, as Haviland pointed out, the Webley
must have been held very level. No hasty swing, or chance
pointing of a weapon, this, if it were a crime. Full front, level
with her heart, touching her dress.</p>

<p>And the bell beneath her nimble fingers had not even rung! It
was a riddle. Granted that the firer was an intimate friend,
companion, husband even, how could they have got that weapon so
close against her? There had been no struggle. Pointer agreed
with the upholders of the suicide, or accident theories on
that.</p>

<p>He slipped out across the hall and stood a moment by the
smoking-room door. Haviland had interpreted his glance correctly
and was leading Tangye on to discuss past and present men to whom
he had given odd jobs about the house and who might therefore, be
labelled possible suspects.</p>

<p>Pointer heard the gush of the soda water, and Haviland's "I
don't mind if I do, sir," and returned to his own problem.</p>

<p>He locked the door behind him and took a turn up and down the
room. He felt as though he were faced by a stone wall, on the
other side of which lay his goal. Somehow, or other he would get
over or break through.</p>

<p>The fine poise of his head, the set of his jaw became more
pronounced. Danger signals both with him.</p>

<p>It was the photograph of the dead woman herself, which he
stood in front of him this time. Square and at her ease she sat
in her light chair, feet together, one hand, fingers up, on her
knee, the other extended limply down with the revolver on the
floor below it. Why did she sit beside, not turned towards her
tea-table?</p>

<p>Pointer did not believe that she had been moved after death.
Yet there was something artificial about her pose which had
struck him from the first. Something arranged...Something
set...Set!</p>

<p>Pointer had an idea. She looked as though posed for her
portrait. Suppose she had been!</p>

<p>Suppose the revolver had been hidden in a box-camera, and that
Mrs. Tangye had been asked to sit for her picture.</p>

<p>That would explain her position. Straight on her chair, facing
into the room where the murderer would be pretending to focus
her. The composed and yet stiff attitude of her body, especially
of her feet. It would also explain the scratches on the
revolver.</p>

<p>Pointer imagined an emptied box-camera, fitted with a few
wires to hold the revolver. Its muzzle pressed against the hole
in front where the lens would have been taken away.</p>

<p>The click of the shutter at the side could be made to pull the
trigger by the simplest of mechanical arrangements, such as a
ring passed through a stout elastic band.</p>

<p>Pointer imagined the murderer asking for a portrait of the
seated womn. Coming close and apparently focussing her in the
"finder." Then suddenly advancing the box with a rush, and
sending the bullet straight through her heart, almost
noiselessly.</p>

<p>As he saw it, the murderer at once picked up Mrs. Tangye's
left hand, rubbed it lightly with butter from the muffin dish, he
had used his handkerchief probably, and then, pressed it around
the weapon as much as possible as a living woman would have done,
had she fired it. Then he had dropped the hand. It was a most
artistic performance, but, as almost inevitable, just a shade
over-acted. He had been a little too prodigal with the butter. He
had pressed the palm a little too closely on the revolver.</p>

<p>Those footsteps in the garden, the "footsteps that
stopped"...Pointer did not think the murderer would be late for
his appointment. Rather the other way. Suppose he had been
waiting in the garden till the exact time set. When Mrs. Tangye
walked out into the darkness he might well have thought that a
still better variant of the original idea was possible. The
camera packed probably with asbestos shavings, would deaden the
sound of any bullet&mdash;even if fired when all was still. There
is always a certain risk in an indoors murder that some one may
enter, and the crime be prevented, or suspicions aroused, or the
murderer be caught red-handed. Pointer thought that those steps
outside on the gravel path which the maids had heard coming
closer, closer yet to Mrs. Tangye, might well have belonged to
the murderer stalking his prey, until Florence's unexpected
turning on of the light had stopped him, and told him that, after
all, it would be best to proceed according to plan.</p>

<p>But whose steps were they? Whose? Man's or woman's? It was a
devilishly ingenious idea. Who had thought it out, and carried it
out? It could be any one, provided he, or she, had some excuse
for taking Mrs. Tangye's photograph. There was Oliver Headly? He
fitted many of the spaces very well indeed. Was he back in
England? He had been an orchid-hunter at one time. It was to an
orchid show that Mrs. Tangye had gone on Sunday. Had the cousins
met at Tunbridge Wells? Had a reconciliation of sorts taken
place?</p>

<p>There was Miss Saunders...There was Tangye&mdash;Pointer
thought of the glance which they had exchanged just now. Some
understanding was between them. Her belief that Tangye had
something to do with his wife's death must rest on some
foundation, or Tangye would not be so reluctant to take a high
hand about the money which he claimed was missing. For that
Tangye suspected the woman of having stolen the money, Pointer
was certain. His alibi was not what Pointer considered a good
one. Like a middling hand at Bridge, it was neither bad enough to
pass, nor good enough to bid on. All depended on what other cards
might fit in with it.</p>

<p>And that quarrel with his wife. Her ordering of him out of the
house which legally was hers. Tangye's face showed a temper that
could, if let loose, be violent enough. He had used a Webley in
the war. He reaped an immediate reward in the cessation of the
double premiums, in the payment of the Insurance money, as well
as in the control of his wife's invested funds.</p>

<p>Yes, Tangye stood to gain tremendously by his wife's death. In
more ways than one, if gossip were true. One thing was certain.
Whoever had killed Mrs. Tangye <i>knew</i> that the heralded
visit of Mrs. Cranbourn was a bluff. The Chief Inspector did not
believe that they would have chanced it otherwise.</p>

<p>Pointer heard the two men in the den go upstairs, Tangye
saying something about showing Haviland a loose shutter.</p>

<p>Pointer stepped into Florence's pantry.</p>

<p>"Look here, I want to take a good photograph of the morning-room by flash-light. Just as part of the usual routine. Is there
a camera in the house that I can borrow?"</p>

<p>"The master has one. He was talking of taking Mrs. Tangye's
portrait only a few days ago."</p>

<p>"Mr. Tangye's just gone out, I think. But, anyway, his would
hardly be large enough for a picture such as I want. I suppose
it's one of the usual fold-up kodaks? Goes into a flat case like
this?" He motioned a size.</p>

<p>He learnt that Tangye had just bought a new one, a large one,
the kind of one that the Chief Inspector wanted, Florence
thought.</p>

<p>"He took it don into the country on Saturday. I don't know if
he brought it back or not."</p>

<p>Florence opened a press in the smoke-room. It was not there.
Did any one else at Riverview photograph?</p>

<p>Miss Saunders did. The master had shown her how to use a
camera that had been given her. It might do. It, too, was a box,
though Florence thought not so large as Pointer wanted.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was an old one of Mrs. Tangye's that he could
have for the time being?</p>

<p>But Mrs. Tangye only had a very small vest pocket kodak, At
that, to Pointer's apparent surprise, Tangye was heard descending
the stairs. Thanking the maid, Pointer said he would be able to
ask him about it, after all. But he took very good care to do no
such thing, as leaving Haviland to follow, he walked on to the
police station alone.</p>

<p>So Tangye photographed. Tangye had bought a new, large camera
about a fortnight ago. Tangye had spoken of taking his wife's
portrait. Humph...And Miss Saunders photographed too...</p>

<p>The lapping of the river no longer sounded to him like a
whispered, threefold question. Rather it was like slipping
footsteps with a catch in them. Slithering footsteps with a kink.
They softly kept pace beside him till he reached the station, as
if some Unseen were close at hand.</p>

<p>Here, as he had taken the longer way round, he found Haviland
and Wilmot, who had cut his engagements and come down in a
hurry.</p>

<p>"Of course, this is just some chance, some coincidence that
has happened at the same time as Mrs. Tangye's death," Wilmot
began at once. Wilmot's determination to be biased amused
Pointer.</p>

<p>"Tangye may be quite right in saying that the loss of the
money is unconnected with her death," Pointer reminded him, "I
think there was a murder. <i>He</i> says there was a theft. If
that's true, it's quite possible that we have two distinct crimes
here, with two distinct criminals, or sets of criminals."</p>

<p>"Kind Heaven above, bring me safe to shore!" prayed Wilmot.
"Fortunately, I have suicide to cling to or I should be drowned.
Still, it's all vastly interesting. All this seeing an
investigation in the raw, as it were. I confess I never realised
how difficult it is to strike the right trail. How easy to get
lost along the wrong one."</p>

<p>"There's one thing fairly certain," Pointer spoke with
decision. <i>"If</i> the man who planned and carried out the
murder also took the notes, then he will either have some paper
exonerating him, purporting to be written by Mrs. Tangye, or
really written by her, or it is Tangye himself. Tangye or a tool
of Tangye's. He alone could have disposed of the notes without
any questions being asked; without the numbers being traced. They
are his property on the death of his wife. He may possibly have
expected the whole sum to have been in the house. Certainly he
had been let down over them in some job or deal. Nothing else
explains his temper at their loss."</p>

<p>"Luckily, I'm not asked to do more than investigate any claim
Tangye may make in proper form by a fortnight from yesterday.
It's a fascinating cross-word puzzle. Though, mind you, suicide's
the right word, and all these others are only duds that Dame
Fortune insists on slipping into the spaces." The newspaper man
spoke, as usual, with certainty.</p>

<p>"It's a funny show for a fact." Haviland's voice marked but
little enthusiasm for the humour of it, but a great deal of
determination to find the right word. "I thought at first that
this money alters the whole case. So it would, in fact, but for
the way she died." Haviland ran over the whole array of beloved
facts.</p>

<p>Pointer unfolded his idea of a portrait&mdash;of a camera.</p>

<p>Haviland gasped. Wilmot actually let his eye-glass drop from a
distended eye. He stared at Pointer with something like awe.</p>

<p>"By Jove! You really...? By Jove! I wonder! But, of course, it
was suicide. Yet&mdash;If by some miracle it weren't!" He paused
for a moment. "That criminal you're supposing has brains,
Pointer!"</p>

<p>"So have we!" Pointer retorted briskly. "Better brains. Just
because we're not criminals. They may commit clever crimes, but
those gentry are never really clever, or they wouldn't commit
them at all."</p>

<p>"That's not been my experience," Wilmot said sadly. "No. On
the whole I'm afraid I think a criminal brain can be a very
clever one. Too clever to be caught sometimes."</p>

<p>"You can't compare a crooked thing with a straight thing.
Their minds must be warped." Pointer, apart from being one of the
heads of the finest detective force in the world, was by nature
of that "deep goodness given to men of real intelligence." He
would never permit a crime to be invested with any aureole of
genius, if he could help it. Wilmot shook his head, after another
long "think."</p>

<p>"And how far does this new idea waft you? Mind, I don't for a
moment think you're right, Pointer. But I like to have the novel
read to me chapter by chapter."</p>

<p>Pointer clasped his hands behind his head, and looked up at
the ceiling, his pipe between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Keeping my belief in a secret visitor&mdash;whether cousin or
not&mdash;out of it, for safer reasoning, speaking offhand, going
merely by the camera, not trying to fit it in with any other
idea, I should say that it looks as if the murderer, if a man,
was not a big man. Not a crack shot. Or hadn't good sight. He's
very careful not to be able to miss. He's quick and deft with his
hands. Those scratches on the revolver aren't fumbling ones. I
should say his little machinery worked well. Quick and deft with
his brains too, I should say. Neat and careful in all his ways.
He makes no real blunder. Not one. I think, to be fair, we can't
count the trifling overdoing of the butter a fault. Except for
the machinery part, the whole has an almost feminine touch."</p>

<p>"I'm bound to say you're half persuading me there's something
in your theory," Wilmot spoke grudgingly. "But no, no! That's the
primrose path of fancy. I stick to the humdrum&mdash;the proven.
The more I think it over, the more I doubt that camera idea of
yours. It's too brilliant. It does too much credit to your
imagination. Yet it's most alluring! Of course there is that
cousin&mdash;but no! no!" He seemed to pull himself up on the
brink of a swerve.</p>

<p>"Then you think her finger-prints were made for her? That she
was dead at the time?" Haviland could add two and two together as
quickly as any man, provided they dealt with facts.</p>

<p>Pointer nodded.</p>

<p>"Haviland, farewell!" Wilmot declaimed dramatically. "I see
that thou art lost to me. From now on, 'I am even as it were the
sparrow that sitteth alone upon the house-tops.' I grant that
it's a seductive theory&mdash;" Wilmot looked as though greatly
tempted to come over to the official camp too, "but there's too
much of a revelation from Sinai about it for me. I'm a slow-going
chap. I plod. I stumble. I grope."</p>

<p>Pointer and Haviland burst out laughing. For Wilmot's
lightning deductions were famous. Though, as he truly said, they
had hitherto always been made after the facts had been clarified
and sifted, and the possibly relevant set aside from the provenly
irrelevant.</p>

<p>"The strange thing is that use of the left hand," Pointer
ruminated. "For&mdash;unless a blunder, of course&mdash;it dates
the murderer. And as, so far, we've found no other blunder, it's
possible that it was unavoidable. That he didn't
couldn't&mdash;know that she had educated herself out of it. That
would mean that he belongs to an early part of her life. Before
she went to France. Before her first marriage.'"</p>

<p>"In fact, it looks as if that left hand pointed directly to
her cousin; first met again after long years, on Sunday,"
Haviland suggested. "Do you think he took Mrs. Tangye's keys off
with him?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"If so, then it looks as though Mrs. Tangye had something he
wanted to get hold of. Something more than the money, supposing
he took that. I've tried banks and safe deposit vaults, and so
on. I can't think of any other lockable place..." Haviland sat
turning over in his mind possible misses.</p>

<p>"You know," Wilmot thoughtfully swung his glass of light beer
to and fro, "if I thought this a crime. If I were you in fact,
Pointer, or you either now, Haviland, I should remember that it's
quite possible that neither the cousin nor Miss Saunders, are
connected with the murder, and yet that Tangye is. He seems to've
been hard up for ready cash on Tuesday. Cheale's going to wire me
in code if he learns of anything definite over in Dublin about
that Irish failure that's expected to be announced next
Saturday." And on that the party broke up.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>

<p class="first">
THE first name on the list which Pointer had drawn up before
coming down to Twickenham was that of Mr. Stewart, the solicitor
to the Tangyes, and also the Twickenham Coroner.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector was shown in without any delay on sending
in his card, and at once explained that he was acting for Wilmot,
who was unavoidably prevented from coming.</p>

<p>Stewart put the tips of his thin white hands together and
waited. He was a very punctilious, elderly man, who did not look
over pleased at Wilmot's substitute.</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. Tangye withdraw her will even temporarily from your
keeping?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"She did not, Chief Inspector."</p>

<p>"Then I take it that she wrote to your firm suggesting
altering her will, or at least asking for it back."</p>

<p>"And why do you 'take it' that way?" Stewart asked
bleakly.</p>

<p>"Because of the character of the very searching questions you
put at the inquest."</p>

<p>Stewart was drumming on the table before him.</p>

<p>"The point&mdash;about her having possibly asked for her will
back&mdash;will have to be cleared up," Pointer spoke as though
regretting the necessity. "Since Wilmot inclines to the belief
that Mrs. Tangye's death was suicide. And you know his standing.
The Company has given him <i>carte blanche.</i> He did think of
applying formally for the handing over of any papers, or letters,
in your possession, but I think we can arrange it between
ourselves. After all, it's only just a matter of routine. She did
write you on the point. We feel sure of that."</p>

<p>Stewart pressed a bell, and a moment later handed Pointer a
docketed letter.</p>

<p>It was from Mrs. Tangye, and was dated the night before she
died.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Stewart</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">Please send me my will at your earliest
convenience for some alterations I wish to make. And please treat
this request as strictly confidential.</p>


<p class="letter">Sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Mable Tangye</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>"Did you send her the will?"</p>

<p>"It would have been posted to her Tuesday night, but for
hearing of the terrible accident," Stewart stressed the word,
"that happened to her."</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Wilmot would like to keep this. I'll give you the
usual receipt." Pointer folded the letter away in his pocket
book. Stewart said nothing.</p>

<p>"Had she ever asked for her will back before?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea as to the nature of the change she wished
to make?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. I doubt if she would have made
any&mdash;perhaps a small bequest to Miss Saunders. A very
faithful, conscientious woman that. Otherwise I feel sure that
the principal beneficiary would have remained Mr. Tangye."</p>

<p>"Yet you didn't mention the letter at the inquest."</p>

<p>"Mentioning it, which means producing it, would have served no
useful purpose except to arouse painful and most unfounded
gossip. And would have been contrary to her own written request."
Stewart looked sharply at the man in front of him. "I, too, take
it that you are not satisfied with the finding of this
morning?"</p>

<p>Had Stewart asked before that verdict was given he would have
had a full reply, but now he was a dethroned monarch. Pointer
said briefly:</p>

<p>"I am helping the Insurance Company, or rather Mr. Wilmot, to
get a few facts together for his final judgment, and
unfortunately I was not at the inquest myself. I've only read the
reports."</p>

<p>"To some purpose," Stewart said acidly.</p>

<p>"You knew the dead woman for many years?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"I drew up her first marriage settlement. Or rather
Branscombe's. She had nothing to settle. Her father had a small
annuity. Her mother left nothing."</p>

<p>"What about her cousin Oliver?"</p>

<p>Stewart looked an inquiry.</p>

<p>"I understand that he is her only relative."</p>

<p>Stewart smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"I've had the pleasure of being on a case with you before, Mr.
Chief Inspector. You understand a good deal more than that about
Oliver Headly, I'll go bail. I shouldn't be surprised if you know
where that unmitigated scallywag is at the present moment."</p>

<p>Pointer assured him that as yet he only knew of his existence,
and the most outstanding features of his murky career.</p>

<p>Stewart added a few more. Among them that as he was a
penniless orphan, his uncle, the Hampshire rector, had
practically adopted him, had lavished a small income and a great
love on the lad, and had died after a very painful interview with
his bank manager. The parson, white and haggard, had told the
only big lie of his life. He accepted as his a signature on a
cheque which the cashier had refused to pay out to the nephew.
The old man had collapsed before he reached his home. Dying from
a literally broken heart. Greatly to the relief of all who knew
Oliver, that young man had left England about twelve years ago,
and since then, as far as Stewart knew, had not been heard
of.</p>

<p>Pointer asked if there had been anything of a love affair
between the cousins.</p>

<p>Stewart did not know. But in the early days the rector had
hoped they would marry. Stewart went on to say that he doubted if
the wish would have come to anything, even without Oliver's
putting himself outside the pale, for he understood that Mrs.
Tangye had always disliked her cousin intensely.</p>

<p>Stewart was a man of scrupulous honesty. He would hold back
what facts he could which would tell against his client, but
nothing, not the wealth of Golconda, would have made him deviate
from the truth. He now leant forward and tapped Pointer's knee
with his glasses.</p>

<p>"There never was a more respectable, creditable past than Mrs.
Tangye's, I should say."</p>

<p>He ran over the points of her uneventful life again, and of
her first husband's settlements.</p>

<p>"You never came upon any trace of any one who might have a
claim on her? Who might bear a grudge against her?"</p>

<p>Stewart made a gesture of definite negation.</p>

<p>Pointer looked at his boot-tips.</p>

<p>"She didn't also write about withdrawing her money from her
husband's firm? She is bound to give him six months notice of any
such action."</p>

<p>Stewart looked at the dock.</p>

<p>"Sorry to cut you short, Chief Inspector, but I have a client
waiting."</p>

<p>"I should like that letter too, please," Pointer said
placidly. Stewart smiled.</p>

<p>"There is none such in existence."</p>

<p>Pointer felt fairly certain that in that case, it was Tangye
who had destroyed it. Your family solicitor never destroys a
paper, which may yet be wanted.</p>

<p>"Would you be prepared to swear that it had never reached
you?"</p>

<p>"My time is up, Chief Inspector," Stewart said firmly, rising,
and opening the door politely.</p>

<p>Pointer drove on to see Miss Eden, the next name on his mental
list, with plenty to occupy his mind.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Tangye had asked for her will back. After that
&mdash;presumed&mdash;quarrel on Monday afternoon. If it had
taken place at all, it must have been a serious one. And she had
apparently either given notice, or been about to give notice of
withdrawing her money, ten thousand, from Tangye's firm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tangye seemed to have done some quick work on her return
from Tunbridge Wells. Monday must have been a full day.
Items:</p>

<p>Trunk packed, and sent off.</p>

<p>Husband quarrelled with, and apparently sent off too.
Temporarily at least.</p>

<p>Will sent for.</p>

<p>There was a precipitancy, an urgency, about her actions which
had struck him from the first.</p>

<p>He found Mary Eden, the friend with whom Mrs. Tangye seemed to
have spent this last Sunday afternoon which the Chief Inspector
thought so important, to be a quiet young woman of around thirty.
She looked very self-possessed. He also thought that she looked
as though she were steeling herself for an ordeal, as she turned
towards him when he was shown into the drawing-room of her
flat.</p>

<p>As for Miss Eden, the Chief Inspector was a surprise to her.
In his quiet manner. In the kind of good looks which nature had
given him. He did not resemble in the least the Scotland Yard
detectives of fiction, she thought. He reminded her a little of
her brother, the finest amateur cricketer in England. Such
splendid physical fitness generally meant a brain to match in her
opinion, and always meant tireless energy.</p>

<p>Something in her glance made Pointer think&mdash;and
rightly&mdash;that she regretted having given him the interview
at all.</p>

<p>"I hope you won't think me troublesome when I ask&mdash;in Mr.
Wilmot's stead&mdash;to see the letter that Mrs. Tangye wrote you
after her return from Tunbridge," was Pointer's opening.</p>

<p>The hazel eyes fixed on his did not waver. Rather they
steadied.</p>

<p>"Letter?" Pointer had an impression that Miss Eden would have
liked to tell a lie, but either dared not, or would not.</p>

<p>"Just so. We know she sent you one," bluffed Pointer. There
was a pause. Miss Eden turned her face still more away from
him.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I didn't keep it. But I'll look for it afterwards,
if you like, and send it on to Mr. Wilmot. I see his address is
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer had used Wilmot's card with a pencilled line
introducing himself only by name.</p>

<p>"Why does he wish to see it?"</p>

<p>"I believe the Insurance Company want to be sure of the hour
when it was posted." He explained vaguely. "When did you receive
it?"</p>

<p>"By the first post Monday morning," she said, after a slight
pause.</p>

<p>That was what Pointer would have expected had any such shock
taken place at Tunbridge as would adequately explain Mrs.
Tangye's action of Monday and Tuesday. Judging by her appearance,
she was not a woman to take counsel about her actions, he
thought. He would expect her to make up her mind as to what she
would do on the way back from Kent, write about it to her
friend&mdash;for Miss Eden was a very close friend, all the
reports showed&mdash;and then act on her own initiative.</p>

<p>He looked at Miss Eden with that quiet, pleasant glance of his
that seemed to see so little, and saw so much.</p>

<p>She was on the alert now for questions about that letter. He
knew as well as though he could read her mind that every defence
was up, plenty of rounds ready, and no possibility of getting
past her unnoticed. She had been taken by surprise when he had
opened with the letter. But she was ready now. So that,
throughout the rest of the interview he learnt nothing but the
barest of facts. That Mrs. Tangye had arrived for lunch. That the
two had gone to the orchid-show about three and left at five.</p>

<p>"Did you meet any one you knew down there?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tangye has no friends down there, and I know very few
people in Tunbridge," was the evasive reply.</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Tangye was seen with&mdash;" Pointer spoke
hesitatingly. "Perhaps she wasn't with you all the time," he
added as a bright afterthought.</p>

<p>"All the time," Miss Eden said in a low voice. She was an
exceedingly poor liar.</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>"Did she enjoy the show?"</p>

<p>"Not very much," Miss Eden spoke slowly, "it gave her a
headache. Glasshouses are stuffy things at best, aren't they?
Perhaps she got overtired." Her lip quivered as she finished.</p>

<p>"Oh? Wilmot thought you walked to the station afterwards?"</p>

<p>Again there came a little pause, then, "Mrs. Tangye fancied
the air would do her headache good. So I told the car to go on to
the station and wait for me there."</p>

<p>"Enclosed car?"</p>

<p>Miss Eden nodded.</p>

<p>"Partition between the driver and the other seats?"</p>

<p>Miss Eden's eyes darkened. After a second she said briefly,
"No. But really these questions seem to me rather wide of the
mark..."</p>

<p>"Just part of the regular routine. Mr. Wilmot wants me to
cover as large an amount of obvious ground as possible," Pointer
reassured her. Asked about Oliver Headly, she relaxed for the
first time. She grew natural. She had never liked Oliver, she
said at once. His was one of those rare natures which, even when
quite young, showed no trace of softness, of any thing but self-seeking.</p>

<p>She thought that his cousin had not heard from him since he
left England years ago. She agreed, however, that, in spite of
everything, a certain amount of family feeling for her only
relative might have remained in Mrs. Tangye's heart.</p>

<p>Pointer seemed very interested in getting a description of
Oliver. He listened closely though apparently casually. "Striking
appearance? Easy to recognise again if one met him suddenly?"</p>

<p>"Oh, unmistakable. But we think he must have died
abroad&mdash;after all these years without a sign of life."</p>

<p>Miss Eden looked at the clock.</p>

<p>"What would you say was the most outstanding characteristic of
Mrs. Tangye? Of her attitude to life I mean?" Pointer asked
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Miss Eden pondered.</p>

<p>"She had so many all about equal qualities," she murmured.
"There was pride&mdash;the right kind of pride which one might
call self-respect. And there was directness&mdash;she was a very
direct woman. There was a way she had of dwelling on the
past...Once she had lost a thing, she valued it higher than
anything she owned; but, otherwise her's was a strong
character."</p>

<p>And on that the interview ended.</p>

<p>Pointer had a most useful, though bulky, stud on one of the
gloves which he never wore. Properly handled, it yielded a roll
of tiny films the size of a pea, which could be enlarged into
very useful portraits. Armed with these one of his detective-inspectors would be able to comb the show early to-morrow, and
also the town. On Tuesday afternoon Mrs. Bligh was supposed to
have been at her club. A woman detective was sent to try that
out, by means of a bribe, and a substituted waitress.</p>

<p>Pointer drove off, feeling that to-morrow should bring some
useful facts to light. But facts alone never solved any
puzzle.</p>

<p>He ran over the events chronologically as he made for his
rooms.</p>

<p>Friday night, Mr. and Mrs. Tangye had been at a dinner and a
dance. Both apparently on the best of terms with the world and
each other. Saturday morning all went as usual. In the afternoon
Mrs. Tangye had attended a matinee with friends and gone on to a
cheerful tea. Tangye had left about ten in the morning for his
Norfolk week-end. Pointer had called up his host over the
telephone, and had been told that the stockbroker had spent all
the time shooting wildfowl, until he left after lunch on Monday.
Yet Tangye only owned two suitable guns, and neither of them had
been taken down from their rack in his den. The dust on them had
told Pointer as much, and the answers by the maids to a casually
put question of his had proved it.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector considered the visit to Norfolk as very
hypothetical. Yet Tangye's friends were standing behind him
solidly. And they were all men of good position. Here was no
criminal clique. Pointer thought that if they backed his story up
as they had done, it was because they knew quite well that he had
spent the week-end, or at least, some of it, in company with a
lady. With Mrs. Bligh probably. With the writer of that
note&mdash;possibly&mdash;that Olive had seen Mrs. Tangye
reading.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Tangye's interest in orchid-shows at Tunbridge, which
had arisen so suddenly, was very likely connected with that
letter too, as Haviland had thought.</p>

<p>Last Sunday! What had occurred, presumably down in Kent, that
had so altered all Mrs. Tangye's quiet, well-ordered existence?
That had&mdash;so Pointer expected to find .&mdash;led to her
death two days later?</p>

<p>He did not think that here was a crime dropped accidentally
into events which were already stirring before it happened. The
flight of Mrs. Tangye from her home, which he believed had been
pending, and the death of Mrs. Tangye, were, he thought, linked.
Though whether closely or loosely, time alone could show. Time
and routine-work.</p>

<p>That night an undetected burglary was committed in London. The
victim of the crime never knew of it. Tangye's offices in the
city were entered by a tall, quick-moving figure, wearing rubber
soles, and with the arm torch and adjustable keys of his craft.
The burglar seemed to be an original. Everything that was not in
the safe&mdash;a burglar-proof safe&mdash;was looked at, but the
only things taken were oddments such as blotting paper, and the
contents of the waste-paper baskets.</p>

<p>Pointer, for it was he, paused longingly on his way home,
outside the flat over a shop where Miss Saunders lived with her
sister, but the yapping of a small Pom sent him reluctantly off.
Back in his own rooms he examined his haul, which did not include
the keys as he had hoped. An hour's work piecing, reading,
deciphering, made him certain that he had drawn a blank. And on
that he turned in, and slept the sleep of the hard worker.</p>

<p>Next morning Pointer sent in his card to the particular Sladen
who had acted for Mrs. Tangye in all estate matters. The
solicitor was a cheery young man who looked on life as a great
joke. He substantiated Tangye's story of the purchase of
Clerkhill farm for three thousand pounds by a Mr. Philpotts, a
farmer living near Rugby.</p>

<p>The money when paid over had been left in his safe by Mrs.
Tangye who had discussed the merits of various Funding loans
without deciding which appealed to her most.</p>

<p>Sladen, too, had heard from his late client herself about the
bank that had failed, and knew of her unconquerable aversion to
cheques.</p>

<p>"Pleasant lady, I understand?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Very. Terrible shock to hear of such a death having come to
her." Sladen actually looked grave for a moment.</p>

<p>"Of course, we're only concerned with tracing this money, but
the Insurance Company is trying to decide whether accident or
suicide was the more likely explanation." Pointer seemed in doubt
himself.</p>

<p>"Not suicide," Sladen said positively. "Oh, dear ino! Not
suicide! Very shrewd eye for a bargain. Very keen on having a
<i>quid</i> for her <i>quo</i>&gt;."</p>

<p>"That's a help," Pointer looked grateful for any assistance.
It was his most useful mask when he had to go in his own person
to make inquiries.</p>

<p>"Now, this Mr. Philpotts&mdash;lie might be able to confirm
that too?"</p>

<p>"Rather!" Sladen laughed again. "Not much doubt but that he'll
agree with me. Would you like his address in town? He's staying
for over the funeral. He used to know Mrs. Tangye years ago in
her father's parish, when she was quite a little girl, so he told
me."</p>

<p>"Keen amateur photographer, isn't he? I seem to recollect his
name as exhibiting now and then. I go in for a bit of that sort
of thing myself."</p>

<p>"Ah? Dare say. I know nothing of him personally."</p>

<p>"Then how did you come to suggest him as a purchaser?"</p>

<p>Pointer seemed bewildered. Sladen decided that the low amount
of serious crime in London compared with that in other capitals
is due to the natural goodness of the Londoner, rather than to
any fear of detection.</p>

<p>"I didn't suggest him," he explained, "we advertised the farm
in the usual way. Mr. Philpotts answered, and as his money was
there in the bank, and Mrs. Tangye very much favoured him as a
purchaser after she'd learnt that he used to be one of her
father's church-wardens, why the deal went through."</p>

<p>"Had they met since those early days?"</p>

<p>"Not as far as I know. Mr. Philpotts liked everything in
writing. So did Mrs. Tangye. We forwarded the papers to her and
put the thing through for her."</p>

<p>Pointer had asked last night at Riverview whether Philpotts
had ever been to the house. As far as was known he had not.</p>

<p>Next, the Chief Inspector wanted a detailed list of the papers
sent by Sladen to Tangye. He read it through&mdash;once, and then
asked about a green cash book, and a brown account book of Mrs.
Tangye's. Sladen had never had either in his care. Yet Pointer
had found them in a locked drawer in Tangye's desk at his office,
together with various other papers of Mrs. Tangye's which the
Chief Inspector had duly listed, and which also, he now saw, were
not on Sladen's list. How had they got into Tangye's possession?
When Haviland had seized on the absence of all personal papers
from his wife's desk as a proof of suicide, Tangye, though
indignant, had had to fall back on the explanation that his wife
had destroyed them as a preliminary to her tour abroad with him.
All the papers which he had seen in Tangye's drawer had been
folded into trim slips, neatly and very fully docketed in the
dead woman's writing. They looked as though they had been
compressed into the smallest possible space. They looked, in
fact, to Pointer, as though Mrs. Tangye had selected them as
essential and sufficient for her purposes before destroying the
others. Pointer had spent some time last night with them spread
around him, and had noticed that every necessary item and note
and receipt was included. But no more.</p>

<p>Yet he had found them in Tangye's drawer. Though the presence
of them in his wife's desk would have taken away one of the two
main props of the suicide theory which he fought so persistently,
and which it was so much to his interest to disprove.</p>

<p>There had been nothing in the papers kept which gave any
reason for his objecting to their being found and read.</p>

<p>Pointer questioned Sladen about the withdrawal of the money
yesterday.</p>

<p>He was told that the whole transaction occupied a bare five
minutes. A cab had driven up just after two; Sladen was busy with
a client. His head clerk had taken the sum in question, three
thousand pounds, from the safe, and obtained the usual receipt.
He had ventured to expostulate on the danger of carrying large
sums in handbags. Mrs. Tangye had assured him that it was to be
immediately invested. She declined his offer of sending an
escort; that was all Sladen knew.</p>

<p>Pointer learnt nothing more from his head clerk except his
opinion of such unorthodox proceedings, and his belief that in
some dim way they were connected with the entry of women into the
law courts. When it came to facts, Johnston could not even say
whether Mrs. Tangye had walked away from the offices, or taken a
taxi, or whether she had a friend with her waiting outside.
Pointer gathered that the old head clerk had been thrown into a
state bordering on coma by the speed, and irregularity of Mrs.
Tangye's actions. Neither the clerk, nor Sladen had ever heard
her mention her will, or will-making. Nor had she ever referred
to the money invested in her husband's firm.</p>

<p>Pointer asked for a specimen of Philpotts's writing and the
number of every note paid for Clerkhill farm. He knew already
that Tangye had not drawn out nor paid in, any large sums to his,
or his wife's banking accounts during the past month.</p>

<p>The stockbroker had only given him the numbers of the missing
notes, but since the dead woman had removed them all from the
solcitor's care only a few hours before her end, the Chief
Inspector felt a keen interest in each.</p>

<p>Accordingly he next had a brief interview with a young Jew of
his acquaintance. Hyam was a rising financier, and his moments
were precious. But, for the sake of a time when Pointer had saved
him from a very nasty position, he could always spare a few for
the Chief Inspector. Pointer only needed one. He wished to trace
any possible activities of Tangye on the cotton market and learn
what had become of the notes which the stockbroker had taken over
on his wife's death. Would Hyam use any private means of finding
out both points? The investigation would be greatly hampered, and
incidentally a quite possibly blameless man harmed by inquiries,
however discreet, undertaken officially. Hyam said "Trust him!"
And Pointer hurried off to the largest orchid importer in the
world, Jaffinsky, near the China Docks.</p>

<p>Jaffinsky was asked whether any well-known orchid-hunters were
in England, just now. Pointer thought that these intrepid men,
few in number, who face deaths tragic and solitary, as part of
their daily work, would be sure to know one another, and might
keep touch in that loose, yet sufficient way common to men whose
task needs very special training and special gifts.</p>

<p>"There's Smith; he's looking after our plants at the Tunbridge
show. His beat's Burma and the Himalayas. Then there's van
Dam&mdash;we could get hold of him for you, I dare say. Sumatra's
the same to him as his back garden. Or what about Filon, the
Frenchman? What he can't tell you of Madagascar, or North
Africa&mdash;but I forgot, he went back last week. And if you're
interested in the Congo, Bielefeld's a marvel. He&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll try Smith," Pointer said. "It's only a toss-up. I want
to inquire about a man, a one-time orchid-hunter too, so I was
told."</p>

<p>Smith and the Chief Inspector were soon seated in a quiet
little back room littered with moss and bamboo. Smith was a
strange-looking fellow. The colour of mahogany, with a face
apparently carved out of red stone, wide-apart eyes, gray in
colour, very still and rarely blinking, a mouth like a slit, a
chin like a grocer's scoop, and a body like a whip-thong.</p>

<p>Pointer explained in a few words what he wanted. Had Smith
ever chanced to come across a man called in England, Oliver
Headly? An Oxford undergraduate?</p>

<p>He was about to give a description, but Smith did not need
more than the name.</p>

<p>"Headly? Oh yes, I knew him. About ten years ago. Afghan
border. But he was no good."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Oh-h, many reasons. A good hunter of any kind of
game&mdash;your kind, Chief Inspector, or my kind&mdash;is born,
not made. Well, Headly wasn't born. Also he had too many irons in
the fire. That border is rather tempting to a certain kind of
man. Gun-running, opium smuggling, doped whisky, are all
lucrative by-paths."</p>

<p>"And the kind of by-paths to appeal to Headly?"</p>

<p>"Anything with money in it would appeal to Headly. Especially
if it was off the true. And if it had a spice of cruelty in it,
so much the better. But why this interest in a chap who's
dead?"</p>

<p>"Sure he's dead?"</p>

<p>"Filon told me a year ago that he saw him shot in Fez. Been
gun-running for the Riffs. Shot under another name. Called
himself Olivier, and refused to state his nationality. I'll give
him that credit."</p>

<p>Pointer expressed a doubt as to Filon's information.</p>

<p>"I think you can depend on it. Our eyes are our breadwinners,
you know. You learn to see accurately, if you're hunting orchids.
Don't want to risk your neck to bring home something that grows
on Wandsworth common. Besides, Headly wasn't a man to forget in a
hurry. Filon told me he recognised him, waved to him, and that
Headly waved back. They were going to blindfold him but he
refused, and faced them smoking a cigarette."</p>

<p>Pointer obtained a few more details which would enable him to
tap the French authorities at Fez, and get into touch with Mr.
Filon, then he asked casually, "Was Oliver Headly a good
shot?"</p>

<p>"Rotten. Luckily he knew it."</p>

<p>And with that the Chief Inspector took his leave.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>

<p class="first">
THE pace of an investigation is a variable tempo. Impossible
to foresee. Some little detail, unimportant, never "mentioned in
despatches," may take days. Some great step be covered in one
stride.</p>

<p>Pointer had hardly finished making a few arrangements for
trailing some of the characters in the little circle concerned so
far, however vaguely, with Mrs. Tangye's death, when Haviland
rang up.</p>

<p>"We've located one of the missing bank-notes, sir. It was paid
in as part of a first-class ticket on a Royal Mail boat going to
South America. Paid in by a young man of the name of Vardon."</p>

<p>"Vardon? Christian name?"</p>

<p>"Philip. Never heard of him before."</p>

<p>Pointer had. He opened a stand in one corner. Ran a finger
over the cards, and presently drew out some papers. From these he
extricated one, and glanced at it. It was a sort of genealogical
tree of the Tangyes, the Branscombes, and the Headlys, as far as
concerned the present generation. Philip Vardon was marked as the
only living relative, bar the sister, of Mrs. Tangye's first
husband, Clive Branscombe. He was the architect's cousin, and
would now be about thirty-four. Apparently he was unmarried.</p>

<p>"That makes him a sort of cousin to Mrs. Tangye, in fact,"
Haviland noted at the other end. "The address the shipping office
gives us is in Fulham."</p>

<p>"You'd better go there at once. I'm due at the Home Office.
There can be no question of telephoning to me there. You'll have
to handle Vardon yourself. Act on your own responsibility.
Meanwhile, not a word to Tangye. There's something twisted about
that money&mdash;and those keys."</p>

<p>Pointer reached for another telephone, and was connected at
once.</p>

<p>The steamship company repeated what Haviland had just told him
along the private wire from his station, but in more detail.
Before they had closed last Tuesday about a quarter to seven, a
first-class ticket to Puntas Arenas in Patagonia, had been sold
to a Mr. Vardon, on a boat due to sail next Saturday. Two days
off yet. He had crossed with them before, he said, nearly a year
ago, on his coming to England from the same port.</p>

<p>"What class had he gone then?"</p>

<p>After some time Pointer got the reply that Vardon had come
home second-class. Did they know his profession? He was an
artist.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector's further questions drew out the fact that
Vardon had been in only a week ago, talking of going back
steerage. Also that when he had dashed in late on Tuesday
evening, he had seemed tremendously excited. The clerk at first
thought that he had been drinking.</p>

<p>Haviland, with his Inspector, rushed up to the dingy
apartments in Fulham. Only to learn that Vardon had left there
late Tuesday night. He had come home about eleven, packed in a
great hurry, and taxied his luggage to an hotel nearer the docks.
The manageress was not surprised at the haste. Her lodger's month
was just up, and as the rooms would have had to be taken for
another four weeks, she had quite agreed with Vardon that there
was no need for that expense, seeing that he had made up his mind
to return to South America by the next boat.</p>

<p>She gave the young man an excellent character in every way. He
had had two garrets called a suite for nearly a year now.
Evidently his means were narrow, but she had no complaint about
unpaid or dilatory bills.</p>

<p>As Haviland represented himself as a business man who had an
appointment with Vardon, and might be coming in with him on a
venture, he asked, and got, the name of the hotel to which the
young man had gone.</p>

<p>Here again, Haviland was just too late. A Mr. Vardon had
arrived last Tuesday, or rather early yesterday morning, it was
past midnight&mdash;but he had not liked the room assigned him,
and had gone to another hotel.</p>

<p>Which one? The hall porter could not say. As Haviland learnt
that the man had taken his own luggage, and done without a cab,
he tried the nearest. There was a certain brevity and ascerbity
in the porter's tone that made Haviland wonder just what had
happened, but he had no time to waste. In the second hotel he was
told that a man of that name was stopping there till Saturday,
when he was leaving by one of the Royal Mail steamers. Haviland
sent up his card, an unofficial card. Could Mr. Vardon spare him
a few minutes in private?</p>

<p>A slender, dark-eyed young man with a pleasant, rather gentle
face, looking much under his real age, came down into the empty
smoking-room at once.</p>

<p>"It's about Mrs. Tangye&mdash;" began Haviland.</p>

<p>Vardon stared. "She's not here."</p>

<p>The two police officers in plain clothes stared in their turn.
"Mrs. Tangye's dead. She was buried an hour ago," Haviland said
after a pause.</p>

<p>"What?" Vardon certainly looked horrified, incredulous,
amazement. "Mrs. Tangye buried?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you read of the case in the papers, sir?" Haviland
asked. He pointed to one lying on the couch beside him. "Here's
the whole story, and a bit more&mdash;for about the third time in
<i>The Flashlight."</i></p>

<p>Vardon snatched at it, and seemed to read it through
breathlessly from beginning to end. It was an account of the
funeral, and a last dishing up of the manner of her death.</p>

<p>"What an awful thing!" he dropped it to the floor and faced
them with his eyes still distended. "I never even glanced at a
sheet yesterday or to-day. Been too busy. And to think I heard
the newsboys calling out 'Twickenham Inquest' yesterday, and
never even stopped to buy a copy."</p>

<p>"Too busy?" Haviland repeated questioningly.</p>

<p>"I'm off to Patagonia day after to-morrow. Decided rather
suddenly to return. Takes some work to get your things on board
at such short notice."</p>

<p>Vardon picked up the paper again, and again seemed to read the
column through, shaking his head here and there.</p>

<p>"What a shocking fatality! I must telephone at once&mdash;" he
began. Then he seemed to really see the two strangers for the
first time since one of them had handed him the paper.</p>

<p>"And may I ask to whom I'm talking? To what I owe this
call?"</p>

<p>"It's about your ticket, sir." Haviland said slowly, "about
one of the notes you paid for it. Where did you get them?"</p>

<p>"Is there something wrong with the notes? Do you mean that
they're bad?" Vardon's face whitened. "Then I can't&mdash;what
<i>do</i> you mean?" he finished hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling us where you got them? I'm afraid it's
rather a serious business."</p>

<p>"In what way? Mrs. Tangye, the lady whose dreadful death is in
that paper, gave me them last Tuesday afternoon&mdash;day before
yesterday in my rooms at Fulham. The very afternoon on which it
seems that she shot herself. She's backing me in a new venture of
mine. But for God's sake, don't tell me these notes are no good!
Why, I've cabled my partner! If I've let him in for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're genuine enough, as far as we know, sir. There's
nothing of that kind the matter, I believe. Mrs. Tangye's
executors couldn't account for their whereabouts, and we've been
asked to trace them. I suppose you have some agreement, something
in writing?"</p>

<p>"Naturally I have. I should rather think so! It's upstairs.
I'll fetch it. I take it you are from her solicitors?"</p>

<p>"That's it, sir," Haviland nodded.</p>

<p>Left alone, the two police officers relaxed their tension.
Vardon had made a good impression. Five minutes went by.</p>

<p>"Better go on up and lend a hand, Brown," Haviland suggested
to the Inspector. "He looks to me like a chap who would need help
with his packing."</p>

<p>A moment later a stony-faced Brown slipped in again, and
holding the door shut behind him, gasped: "He's bolted!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" Haviland sprinted up beside the other as though
he had some infallible recipe for collecting the absent.</p>

<p>But Vardon had gone. He had walked out of the hotel
immediately with his suitcase, nodded rather breathlessly to the
hall porter, turned a corner, and vanished. As all rooms were
pre-paid no one had spoken to him.</p>

<p>The two police officers said little. There are some things for
which speech is too limited.</p>

<p>"He fits everything!" Haviland said tensely, as very white
about the gills, he reported what had happened to Pointer later
in the afternoon. Haviland had cause to look pale. Scotland Yard
does not tolerate many blunders. But Pointer knew only one
unpardonable offence. That was untrustworthiness.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! He fits in right enough."</p>

<p>Haviland waited miserably for compliments on his brilliant
handling of the case. None came.</p>

<p>"Shall I get out a warrant for his arrest?" he ventured to
ask, very much doubting whether he would be entrusted with it.
"Though he's sure to make for abroad. An artist must know many a
port where he can lie hid. South America, too!"</p>

<p>There was still another painful point for Haviland to trot
out.</p>

<p>"He owns some sort of a box-camera. So they told me at his
rooms in Fulham. It isn't with the suitcase, nor yet with the
luggage he's sent to the boat."</p>

<p>Pointer sat awhile thinking.</p>

<p>"Got your car below? Good. I'll speak to Wilmot over the
'phone," he did so, telling him briefly of what had happened, and
asking him to wait for Haviland who would bring him back to the
Yard in his police "non-stoppable."</p>

<p>When Wilmot arrived, Pointer suggested a line of action on the
part of the newspaper man, to which Wilmot consented after a
little pressing.</p>

<p>Then Pointer turned to Haviland, and sketched to that slowly-reviving officer, how and where the next step should be
taken.</p>

<p>Pointer himself was just back not only from the "breakfast"
but from Mrs. Tangye's funeral. It had been a more than usually
melancholy affair. The knowledge that Scotland Yard was in some
way concerning itself with her death made the wildest rumours
run.</p>

<p>While there, however he had met a lady who had travelled up
with Mrs. Tangye on her return from Tunbridge Wells. By chance
getting into the same compartment at Ashford. She had found Mrs.
Tangye suffering from a bad headache. Mrs. Tangye had referred to
the orchids, and said that the heat had been too much for her.
She had sat with closed eyes apparently suffering very much, till
they reached town, where she had refused her companion's offer of
a lift in her car, and had taken a taxi.</p>

<p>So Pointer's doubts were solved as to whether whatever it was
that had caused what he called the cleavage in Mrs. Tangye's
life, had taken place at or after Tunbridge.</p>

<p>If it had taken place on Sunday at all, it had apparently been
while with Miss Eden.</p>

<p>Pointer's eyes were on that young woman a good deal during the
funeral. She avoided Tangye. He avoided her.</p>

<p>At the funeral too, Pointer had met Philpotts the Rugby
farmer. He looked an honest, elderly man. Philpotts scoffed at
the idea of Mrs. Tangye having had any intention of going where
pounds, shillings, or even pence, mean nothing.</p>

<p>"She gave way on the fences, but she stuck to her point about
the timber," he repeated several times, half admiringly, half
grudgingly. Pointer had brought the talk around again to Mrs.
Tangye. The farmer's knowledge of her early days added nothing
new, any more than did his few recollections of her cousin.
Philpotts's own alibi of Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, which
Pointer obtained by many indirect turns of the talk, was
unverifiable.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon he claimed to have spent with his wife in
Westminster Abbey. The same time on Monday had been earmarked for
the National Gallery, and Tuesday, after four, had seen them
either gazing at the shops, or in one of the large tea-rooms
where identification is impossible.</p>

<p>"It's queer," Pointer said now, when talking him over with
Haviland and Wilmot, after he had finished detailing his plan
about Vardon, "how few of the people connected with Mrs. Tangye
can be located last Tuesday between four and six. Mrs. Bligh, is
so far, the sole person who is definitely vouched for by several,
unbiased, witnesses. She really did play bridge at her club from
before four until after six."</p>

<p>"What would you have?" Wilmot asked raising an eyebrow. "How
many more points do you want to prove that there's no crime here?
By the way, how about the man you sent down to Tunbridge with the
family portrait-album?"</p>

<p>"Which unfortunately did not contain a picture of Oliver
Headly. There seems to be none extant of him. But Watts has just
reported. No one in the show itself can identify any of the
faces. There was a huge crowd on Sunday. Some minor royalty
present. But outside, just by the gates, he found a tobacconist
who recognised Tangye as having bought a box of vestas from him
in the early afternoon last Sunday. That's our only haul."</p>

<p>"Vardon fits everything," Haviland repeated sombrely. He
refused to be either comforted, or diverted. "When he said he had
an agreement in writing, I ought to've suspected something. After
what you said! But he seemed so straightforward. Yet, I shouldn't
wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Haviland proceeded gaily to sketch a long-ago flirtation,
a meeting after many years, a planned elopement, the sale of the
farm, and a murder when he found that the woman insisted on
accompanying her funds.</p>

<p>Wilmot listened. Now blowing hot, now cold, as was his way. He
called it the impartial poise.</p>

<p>"You may be right all along the line, Haviland," Pointer said
finally when appealed to as umpire, "but&mdash;so
far&mdash;there's no reason known to us why Vardon shouldn't have
come to the front door. In other words, he fits the preparations,
but Oliver fits the French window."</p>

<p>"Front door! Back door!" Wilmot suppressed a yawn; "wouldn't
<i>any</i> murderer have come to the French window?"</p>

<p>"My point is that Mrs. Tangye wouldn't have expected him to
come that way," Pointer said rather dryly. "It's not a case of a
house-breaker's murder, but of a carefully prepared plan, and of
some one whom Mrs. Tangye invites&mdash;expects&mdash;that
way."</p>

<p>"There's a door into and out of the smoking-room, we've just
learnt. Wouldn't that be a more usual way of unnoticed entry than
by a window? Your whole theory hangs on those windows, which were
found closed remember."</p>

<p>"That Miss Saunders <i>said</i> she found closed. The smoking-room cupboard door has a Yale lock. Tangye has the only known
key. Any one using it would have have had to cross the central
hall to get at Mrs. Tangye. And Florence was on the alert."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"The fact is, I've had another thought," Haviland said so
impressively that his two hearers smiled, "of the man who bought
the farm. Philpotts. He's an old acquaintance. He would know
about the money. What about Philpotts as the gent of the
footsteps the two girls heard? The farmer's sure to walk stiff
with rheumatism."</p>

<p>"Why should he go to the French window rather than to the
front door?"</p>

<p>"My dear chap, don't let a little thing like that stump
you."</p>

<p>Wilmot begged. "I repeat that obviously a man, or woman, with
a criminal intent, would prefer to come, and above all to go, as
unobtrusively as possible."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I repeat my question. The answer to which is the
answer, I believe, to our whole riddle. Why should Mrs. Tangye
aid him by lending herself to that entrance? It's not the coming
of in the murderer by the window, but Mrs. Tangye's apparent
preference for that way, that strikes such an odd note. On the
other hand, if it could have been her cousin...If Filon was
mistaken..."</p>

<p>Late that same afternoon a young man was in the act of
following his luggage on to the Harwich boat, when a hand touched
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vardon? Don't go on. There's an officer from Scotland
Yard waiting to arrest you by the gangway. Come with me. I'm a
friend."</p>

<p>The man to whom these words were hurriedly whispered, jumped,
and swung round on his heel.</p>

<p>"Let your gear go, and follow me. I've a taxi. Been waiting
for you before they should nab you," Wilmot urged. Vardon
followed the other to a cab. Once they were in, he loosened his
muffler which hid the lower part of his face. "Who on earth are
you?"</p>

<p>Wilmot gave his name. To his surprise, it apparently conveyed
nothing to Vardon.</p>

<p>"Newspaper man, you say? But how are you mixed up in
this?"</p>

<p>"I travelled down in the same compartment with a C.I.D. man,
and he talked a bit," Wilmot said. Truthfully enough. Pointer had
talked&mdash;to him. "I learnt that you had been shadowed when
you bought your ticket. Your passport gave you away. You had to
have it renewed, didn't you? Hard luck! Well, I determined to get
in first and whisk you off."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"I'm acting as claims' investigator for the company in which
Mrs. Tangye was insured. The policies excluded suicides. We
believe her death to have been self-inflicted."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tangye's death? But what on earth has that to do with
me?" Vardon asked in seeming stupefaction. "I thought it was the
notes that were in question."</p>

<p>Wilmot looked at him for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>"The police believe that death to have been a murder. Or at
least they're trying to believe it," he said finally.</p>

<p>"What hour did she die?" Vardon asked feverishly. He certainly
was either innocent, or a good actor.</p>

<p>"Between four and six on Tuesday afternoon at her house in
Twickenham." There was absolute silence in the cab.</p>

<p>"Stop!" the artist suddenly rose. "Drive to the police
station. I must face this thing. It's worse even than I thought.
Infinitely worse. And that was bad enough!"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't go to the police, if I were you," Wilmot
suggested, "better let me take you to a house I know of where you
can have time to think things over."</p>

<p>"I'm innocent!" Vardon declared almost defiantly.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, there is no criminal here in my belief. No
fact has been laid before me&mdash;as yet&mdash;of a nature to
change my opinion that Mrs. Tangye's death was a suicide, if not
an accident. Apart altogether from acting for the Insurance
Company, I&mdash;so far&mdash;believe that she shot herself
because of domestic trouble."</p>

<p>"So do I!" came from the man beside him. "I'm absolutely
certain that she killed herself. That was why she let me have
that money. She wanted to make a gift of it. I've understood the
whole strange episode since reading of her end."</p>

<p>Wilmot turned to him eagerly.</p>

<p>"Good. You can prove that?"</p>

<p>"Prove nothing. It's only my firm belief. Looking back on what
she said, and how she said it."</p>

<p>There was another silence.</p>

<p>"Look here," Wilmot said, "I'm a newspaper man, as I told you,
Special Correspondent to the <i>Daily Courier,</i> but not a
syllable gets into the press of what you tell me. My word on
that."</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me?" was Vardon's reply. He seemed
wrestling with his own thoughts.</p>

<p>"To the rooms of a friend of a friend of mine." Again Wilmot
spoke the literal truth. The rooms belonged to a friend of
Pointer's. "You can stay quietly there till we can think of the
best thing to do. How about changing your name?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather not. The police can't have anything worth while
against me."</p>

<p>"Then, why did you run away?" Wilmot's glance asked. Vardon
flushed.</p>

<p>"It's awfully good of you to take me on trust, this way," he
said awkwardly, as they drew up in a quiet street of Sloane
Square.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a man who, though Vardon could not know
it, was of the greatest service to the Yard. He, and his neatly
kept house in which Pointer had installed him.</p>

<p>Going upstairs&mdash;the rooms were on the first floor, Bates
never had any rooms on the ground floor "empty." It was too easy
to get into and out of them&mdash;Vardon tripped. He recovered
himself instantly.</p>

<p>"My leg gives out at times. Broke my knee-cap when I first got
to Patagonia."</p>

<p>Wilmot was very thoughtful for some time after that little
mishap.</p>

<p>The rooms were all that could be asked. The terms amazingly
moderate.</p>

<p>But Wilmot explained that they belonged to an "explorer" who
sub-let them during his long absences. He did not add that the
gentleman was now exploring Dartmoor prison. Vardon heaved a
quick sigh, as he heard the door close. "Ever hunted?" he asked
Wilmot.</p>

<p>"Rather! Why?"</p>

<p>"I used to love it. Used to think November marked the
beginning of the real year. But never again! By Jove, no! Now
that I know what it feels like to have the hounds after you."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Wilmot was patiently waiting. Vardon
leant on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you'll think me a fraud? After all your trouble
and risk to get me here. But I must talk things over with my
solicitor first. D'you mind coming in later on? Say, after
dinner? About nine?"</p>

<p>Wilmot said he quite understood, and would come again at about
ten.</p>

<p>Vardon held out his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm more grateful than I can say. Just at present I'm a bit
stunned. You must make allowances."</p>

<p>They shook hands and Wilmot went back to Pointer.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector sat thinking for a moment after Wilmot
left him. A bell rang. He had a telephone extension which
connected with Bates's instrument. Picking up that receiver, the
Chief Inspector heard a voice asking for a number. A glance at
the Yard's telephone directory gave him the name that fitted it
as Dorset Steele, Solicitor, Bedford Row.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dorset Steele wanted on the telephone at once, please. No
name," the voice went on. There was a pause. Then Pointer heard a
gruff: "Well? Well? What is it? What is it?"</p>

<p>"Can you come and see me? You recognise the voice, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"I do. Well? Well?" snapped the solicitor.</p>

<p>"I'm in a quandary. I can't come myself, but I'd like to see
you as soon as possible," Vardon gave his address.</p>

<p>"Coming at once," barked Dorset Steele, and hung up.
Apparently Vardon was not the apple of the legal man's eye, yet
in a very few minutes, Bates showed Dorset Steele up. A tall,
thin, rather untidy looking man who carried his head a foot in
advance of his rounded shoulders. The "lost golf-ball" look,
Barbara Ash called it.</p>

<p>"Now, what's wrong?" he snapped by way of greeting, looking at
the young man under his eyebrows like an old poodle of uncertain
temper.</p>

<p>"I'm in a nasty hole. So much so that I didn't venture to
clamber out by myself, until I had talked things over with you.
The police all but arrested me to-day for the murder, or a share
in the murder, of Mrs. Tangye."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Dorset Steele tossed his soft hat into a chair as though
it were the ring. Then he promptly sat down on it. He stretched
out his muddy boots&mdash;his boots seemed to find mud as a water
diviner does springs&mdash;subconsciously. Then he nodded to
himself, as though this were what he had long expected, and on
the whole, hoped would happen.</p>

<p>"Your story?" he asked curtly, squinting at the other around a
collar that suggested a liking for comfort.</p>

<p>"I haven't much of a one. Mrs. Tangye came to my rooms last
Tuesday about&mdash;well shortly before three as nearly as I can
now recollect. She said she knew that I had some sort of a land
proposition in the Argentine in which I was trying to interest
people over here. And that she had decided that as I was Clive's
only relative, and he had left everything to her&mdash;Clive
Branscombe was her first husband, you know&mdash;she wanted to
take an interest in it with me. She pulled out one thousand five
hundred pounds from an envelope in her bag as casually as though
they had been a pair of gloves. She handed me the roll and said
that another fifteen hundred should follow at the end of a
twelvemonth. Would that do? I told her two thousand in all would
be ample. I wanted to go into the question of percentages, and
into the affair itself &mdash;which isn't in the Argentine
really&mdash;but she wouldn't wait. Told me to write it all very
fully, and send it to her at her bank. Obviously, in the light of
what has happened that was just an excuse. She didn't even
trouble to pretend an interest in what I was going to do with the
money. I suggested three per cent for the first year, five the
second, ten the third, and twenty-five after that. I don't mind
telling you in confidence that it's an untouched quinine grove,
and there's a fortune in it. The difficulty is to keep its
location from being guessed at."</p>

<p>"Have you this promise of Mrs. Tangye's in writing?"</p>

<p>"That's the trouble. I insisted on her sitting down and
writing a line to say that the fifteen hundred now, and the same
amount to come after twelve months, was a loan. She scribbled off
a few words to that effect while I wrote out a duplicate. We
signed both. I wanted witnesses but though I nearly broke the
bell, no one came. I rushed downstairs but there wasn't a soul in
the office. There never is; I asked her to wait, but she
wouldn't. Finally I had to let her go. She didn't even let me
finish telling her that at Puntas Arenas, Maunde would have a
proper agreement drawn up, signed, and witnessed, if she would do
the same in town. She was out, and down the stairs before I had
got the words out."</p>

<p>"Taxi waiting?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. The Tube is next door."</p>

<p>"Well? Well? What about the line you say she did write?"</p>

<p>"I packed up and went to a hotel in the city, you know.
Smith's hotel near the docks. And there my bag was lost or
stolen. Her note about the money was in it as well as some other
things that I need, too. I kicked up a row, but the bag was gone.
They insisted that I had left it in the cab. I know better. I
moved my remaining suitcase to a hotel opposite and there, this
morning, two men, police officers from Twickenham, came to
interview me. When they asked me to show them the paper I was in
a tight place. They had just told me of Mrs. Tangye's suicide. I
hadn't opened a paper for days. The news stunned me. And then
this question about the money! I had cabled Maunde to go ahead.
To sign the necessary papers. But I hadn't sent the money. I
thought I'd take that out myself. I intended to sail Saturday,
you know. It was on me. The positon was ghastly. That paper of
Mrs. Tangye's was gone. She had tossed mine on the fire when I
handed it to her. I decided that I must at least get the money
off to Maunde at once. So I skipped. Whatever happens I'm glad I
did. He's got the money by now. I cabled it over. As for me, I
thought I could get aboard unnoticed if I went at once. But no
such luck! And the end would have been the same if I'd told those
two chaps that I couldn't find the bag."</p>

<p>"The effect on the jury wouldn't have been the same," snapped
Dorset Steele.</p>

<p>"No. I'm afraid not. But it won't come to that. Of course,
I've lost this <i>chukker,</i> I quite understand that. But give
them time, and the police are sure to find out that she killed
herself."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come to the funeral? Barbara couldn't
understand it."</p>

<p>"I hadn't an idea Mrs. Tangye was anything but in the best of
health. Not an idea!"</p>

<p>"And why didn't you write to Barbara to tell her the
news?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tangye asked me to say nothing about the loan."</p>

<p>"Eh?" Dorset Steele shot the young man a sharp glance.</p>

<p>"Yes. She told me to say nothing about her coming with me into
the venture. I said, 'Certainly not, if you don't wish it,' and
she nodded as though to imply that she most certainly did
<i>not</i> wish it. But naturally that promise doesn't hold good
under these circumstances."</p>

<p>"And now, where are you? Whose rooms are these?" Vardon told
him of what had happened down at the docks. "You don't know your
landlord then?"</p>

<p>"You mean the man downstairs? Not in the least. Why?"</p>

<p>"He was in Scotland Yard. If you're here, you're under
observation." Pointer gave a laugh at the other solicitor's
acumen, when, next morning, he heard this part of the
conversation wound off the microphone in the "clock" on the
mantelpiece which was recording every word the two men spoke.
"The case is in the hands of Chief Inspector Pointer, I've
learnt. They're keeping it dark about the death. They claim to be
investigating only the loss of the money. But that's not the sort
of a job he takes on. He's as unscrupulous in getting his
evidence as any criminal in the land," Dorset Steele said
savagely. There was a by no means forgotten incident in which one
of his most carefully coached witnesses, and a bottle of whisky,
and Pointer had all played a part, that still rankled. "He'll
leave no stone unturned to hang you if you're guilty. But he's
fair. He's as straight as that poker and about as easy to
bend."</p>

<p>Vardon turned red. "So, I'm under observation! And I thanked
that chap who stopped me going on the boat...He'll get something
other than thanks when I see him again!"</p>

<p>"Wilmot! A moment." Dorset Steele went to the telephone. He
was soon in touch with a man he knew on the <i>Courier.</i> He
laid down the tube with a grunt.</p>

<p>"That part is true. He is acting as claims' investigator for
the moment to the Insurance Company. In place of Cheale..."
Steele sat down again and fell into deep thought. "He's on our
side, therefore."</p>

<p>"Are you taking my case?" Vardon asked suddenly and
bluntly.</p>

<p>Dorset Steele hesitated. He shot the young man a sour
glance.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said at last. "But it's going to be stiffer than you
think.. Pointer's name in it means that. Suppose this turns into
a murder case. Do you know the facts against you? There's the
money traced to you which was last paid Mrs. Tangye. There's your
slipping away. Where were you Tuesday afternoon around five?"</p>

<p>"I was strolling through the Army and Navy stores pricing
things and making out a rough list."</p>

<p>"Speak to any salesmen?"</p>

<p>"Not one."</p>

<p>"Meet any one you knew?"</p>

<p>"By Jove, I did! Lift man who took me up to the bun floor used
to be a chap&mdash;" his face fell. "Perhaps I'd better leave him
out."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"He was one of the under-stewards on the boat I went out on.
Got into trouble."</p>

<p>"What kind of trouble?"</p>

<p>"Some ass dropped his pocket-book literally at the chap's feet
one night without noticing it. Poor Pike has a family who seem to
specialise in expensive illnesses, so he picked it up, and I'm
sorry to say, kept it. That was bad enough. But the worst of it
was the Head steward saw him. End of Pike. He'd have been jailed
only the passenger refused to prosecute."</p>

<p>"Were you the passenger?"</p>

<p>Vardon gave an awkward laugh.</p>

<p>"Holed it in one," he acknowledged.</p>

<p>"Help him afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes, I had to. The chap turned up by chance at a
ranch where I was painting the barns. He was half starving.
Winter was coming on. Winter on a Patagonian plain! He'd have
died with those lungs of his. I got the R.M. to give him another
chance on one of their fruiters. He's done quite well since
then."</p>

<p>Dorset Steele looked at him.</p>

<p>"And that's the best you can do as an alibi? Nice witness for
the jury to hear pulled to pieces. Nice motive to put him in your
debt, so that he'd swear to anything to help you. That's what
they'd say."</p>

<p>"I know the outlook's pretty poor." Vardon thrust his hands
deeper into his trouser pockets, "but I didn't kill my one time
cousin-in-law, Mr. Dorset Steele, even supposing she was killed.
Anc that's something to go on, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Grudgingly the solicitor admitted that it might be. But
apparently he would have vastly preferred guilt and a solid
alibi.</p>

<p>There was another silence.</p>

<p>"Have you any explanation," Dorset Steele said suddenly, "any
that we can make the jury, if it comes to that, I mean, as to why
Mrs. Tangye suddenly paid you that money? I leave your story of
an additional fifteen hundred out of it."</p>

<p>Vardon did not answer for a minute. "I can't explain it
either," he said lamely. "We'd never met before. She said she
wanted to settle up all her outstanding debts, and she thought I
had a claim on Branscombe's estate. A moral claim. She talked a
lot about wiping the slate clean before another start elsewhere,
and so on. Oh, she meant to kill herself. Not a doubt about it!
At the time I was too flustered to have my wits about me. She
said that money could be a fetter under some circumstances, or at
least of no use. And as I had written to her several times for a
loan from her first husband's estate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut! Tut!" barked Dorset Steele, "you had not! but go on in
your own way for the moment."</p>

<p>"That was all there was. I thought I was in a dream, I assure
you. I've lived in a dream till that man Wilmot touched me on the
arm and, as I thought, saved me. By Jove, when he calls around
later he'll hear what I think of him. I'm a quiet chap as a rule,
but I won't answer for what I shall say to him."</p>

<p>Dorset Steele pursed his lips. Obviously he was considering
the effect of a possible black eye on the jury as a consequence
of the interview.</p>

<p>"Better not see him." He got up. "I must be off. I'll have a
talk with the police and see if they're keeping anything
important up their sleeves." He shot a glance at Vardon. There
was no answer.</p>

<p>"You've nothing more to tell me?"</p>

<p>"I've told you all I know."</p>

<p>Dorset Steele looked savagely at him.</p>

<p>"And you expect a jury to swallow it?"</p>

<p>"Why not? It's the truth," there was a flash in Vardon's
eyes.</p>

<p>"They'll certainly call it stranger than fiction," the
solicitor promised grimly.</p>

<p>He got up off his hat, tossed it on his head, thrust his arms
into his top-coat which he had taken into the room with him, and
made for the door.</p>

<p>"See no one&mdash;if you can avoid it. Say as little as
possible. And&mdash;keep cheerful."</p>

<p>He finished with an unexpected smile.</p>

<p>While Dorset Steele was talking to Vardon, Pointer was going
through the artist's luggage. He found no camera, box or
otherwise, but he came on a ring of keys beneath everything else
in the suitcase which looked like household keys. The number of
the Yale key tallied with that on the Riverview front door. So
did the number of the safe key. Clearly these were the missing
keys of Mrs. Tangye. The keys which Tangye refused to have
connected with the missing notes. Which he said he had seen at
Riverview on Tuesday, after the police had left.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>

<p class="first">
HAVILAND was greatly cheered by the news of the keys. "A clue
at last!" he chortled.</p>

<p>"To what?" was Pointer's question. "To whom?"</p>

<p>Haviland stared.</p>

<p>"Why, to the whole affair. It's a direct link with Mrs.
Tangye. In fact, it's a direct link with her murder, I should
say."</p>

<p>Still Pointer did not reply.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a fact anyway!" Haviland said desperately, "just
as his having two of those notes in his possession was a
fact."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the sole importance of a fact lies in the way we
look at it."</p>

<p>"A most true remark, oh, worthy sir!" chimed in Wilmot who had
driven down with Pointer, and was now breakfasting at the
Twickenham police station. "And let me also remind you two
bloodhounds on the trail, that Vardon may have a perfectly
satisfactory explanation of those keys being found in his
possession."</p>

<p>"He's sure to have! In fact, when you see him, Mr. Wilmot,
you'll find he'll explain everything so nicely that you'll think
what a pleasure it is to meet such a candid young gentleman."
Haviland was still sore.</p>

<p>"Insurance Company's dropping behind, I fear," Wilmot
murmured. "I wonder, if after all, it was a crime? I wonder This
case certainly has unexpected light and dark places."</p>

<p>"The fact is, they always have," Haviland announced
despondently.</p>

<p>"It's the charm of the word, of course," mused Wilmot, "that's
why people read detective stories. For that and&mdash;the love of
the chase."</p>

<p>"The love of justice," Pointer spoke for once with real
warmth, "it's because they satisfy that&mdash;I suppose the
deepest passion of every one's heart, but a criminal's&mdash;that
people read, and write, detective novels."</p>

<p>"I read 'em for facts, helpful facts," Haviland volunteered.
"Really, some of the dodges these writers get hold of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're wrong. Both of you." Wilmot, as usual, spoke with
certainty. "The same thing makes people read, that makes you,
Haviland, a policeman, and you, Pointer, a detective. And that is
for the sake of the thrill. Of the manhunt. There's nothing else
in the world quite like it. Why, even I begin to get the whiff of
it in my nostrils."</p>

<p>Pointer was silent. Only his friends knew the Chief
Inspector's dislike of that common phrase, and point of view. To
himself, Pointer was but a keen, impartial keeper of the open
road, the path of law and order. The only path by which
civilisation, to his mind, could march on.</p>

<p>"I suppose Vardon'll be allowed to give his explanation?"
Wilmot asked a little curiously.</p>

<p>"In due time." It was Pointer speaking. "But as Tangye's
leaving town for a week-end, we'll go to Riverview first. He's
kept in the house with a cold, so he told me. Are you coming with
us, Haviland?"</p>

<p>But a dull affair of a burgled boot-shop deprived the
Superintendent of that pleasure.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, perhaps Vardon was the person Tangye
suspected all along," he said, hopefully, trying to cheer himself
by the suggestion that he was not about to miss much.</p>

<p>Pointer and Wilmot walked to the house. The sun was shining. A
rather apologetic sun, as though begging spectators not to ask
too much. To remember that this was November&mdash;and England.
His rays, faint and pale, seemed to cool rather than warm. Yet
their touch spelled beauty. They brought out the thrushes' song.
They lifted the lark.</p>

<p>They set free the strain of wren and robin in a clump of
evergreen beside Richmond Bridge. Plaintive and sweet notes.
Joyous and pearly. A blind man might have thought it spring, so
mild was the day. But the trees knew better. They were only
waiting for the coming of a wind with which to wrestle. Like
giants stripped for a fight, their old clothes, the withered
leaves, lying in tumbled heaps below them, they could now give
back as good as they got. Beautiful to look at, fine and firm,
they swayed aloft. Concerned solely with their own affairs, till
the burden of giving shade and shelter should be theirs once
more.</p>

<p>Pointer's and Wilmot's arrival evidently roused Tangye from a
revery in an armchair. He looked very haggard. Very unhappy. He
turned an alert eye, none the less, on them when they were
ushered in.</p>

<p>"What I have to say is in strict confidence," Pointer began.
Tangye nodded. Looking an almost savage interest.</p>

<p>"One of the missing notes has been traced. To a Mr.
Vardon."</p>

<p>"Vardon! Philip Vardon?" There was stupefaction in the other's
voice. And something that sounded very like chagrin.</p>

<p>"You know him, sir? Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Why, a cousin of my late wife's first husband. A cousin of
Clive Branscombe's. There's a mistake been made somewhere, Chief
Inspector."</p>

<p>"Not unless the mistake was in the number of the notes given
us." Pointer lobbed that ball back very swiftly.</p>

<p>"Is he with you now?" Tangye half rose.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately he tricked us by a tale of a document, and got
away."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I'm&mdash;damned," Tangye repeated under his
breath, his eyes goggling. Pointer gave him the outlines of what
had happened.</p>

<p>Tangye listened with at least every appearance of breathless
interest. "He says Mrs. Tangye gave him the money on Tuesday
afternoon," he repeated thoughtfully. He was the business man
now, weighing both sides. "In that case he's sure to have that
paper he spoke of. It wouldn't be like her not to have the
agreement in writing&mdash;nor like any woman&mdash;" a sudden
passion rang in the grudging tone, "perhaps he merely rushed away
to find it. Remembered he'd left it behind him in his lodgings.
Hasty thing to do, but I think you'll find everything's all right
when you get into touch with him again." Tangye strode over to
his tantalus. Things were unlocked, tumblers clinked. As before,
Pointer, and this time Wilmot, declined a drink. Tangye stood
eyeing his cocktail with a bitterly disappointed air, as though
his favourite recipe had gone back on him. As though the mixture
were anything but what he had expected to see.</p>

<p>"But that would hardly explain how he came to have her keys
packed away in his suitcase," Pointer continued.</p>

<p>Tangye's glass gave a postman's knock against the table.</p>

<p>"Let me see..." Pointer seemed to ruminate, "isn't he a crack
shot? Bisley prize-winner, or something of that kind?"</p>

<p>"I never heard so. He's quite fair with a gun. Can be trusted
out with a keeper, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Has he ever spoken to you about this proposition of his?"</p>

<p>"Once. But I don't go in for that sort of thing. Never touch a
speculation. Apparently my wife decided after all to have a try
with him."</p>

<p>"I suppose he called here frequently on the subject," Pointer
suggested.</p>

<p>"He's never been to the house."</p>

<p>"But a friend of your wife's, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"They had never met."</p>

<p>"Of yours, then?"</p>

<p>"Not especially. I've known him off and on since we were boys.
He, too, was at Haileybury, though after my time. Of course
you'll stop all proceedings. Naturally he'll have a perfectly
understandable explanation of both keys and money."</p>

<p>Pointer said nothing.</p>

<p>Tangye looked at him sharply. "<i>I</i> lodged the complaint,
or information, or whatever the official name is, and now I
withdraw it&mdash;until we hear from Vardon."</p>

<p>"Very good," Pointer was unperturbed. "Personally I'm only
interested in the missing money, and the keys, in so far as they
may concern a theory regarding Mrs. Tangye's death."</p>

<p>"Regarding it as what?" Tangye stopped his glass midway to his
lips.</p>

<p>Pointer looked very official. Wilmot's face showed nothing. He
had been listening and watching with equal keenness.</p>

<p>"It looks as though Vardon's capture might end the inquiry
that we've been making&mdash;as a matter of routine&mdash;into
Mrs. Tangye's death. In other words, sir, I fancy the charge
against Mr. Vardon may have to be murder. I'm sorry to use the
word about your wife's death, but that's what it looks like at
present. You understand that this is entirely confidential. Is
not to go any further."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;on&mdash;earth&mdash;do&mdash;you&mdash;mean,
Chief Inspector?" Tangye seemed unable to believe his ears. His
hand shook so that he replaced the glass hastily on the table.
"Wilmot here claims that Mrs. Tangye's death was a suicide. I
have maintained, and the Coroner has maintained, that it was due
to an accident."</p>

<p>"But we at Scotland Yard are wondering if it mayn't be due to
a crime," Pointer said concisely.</p>

<p>"Things look very black against Mr. Vardon," the Chief
Inspector went on in his level, unemotional tones, "other things
than I am at liberty to speak of."</p>

<p>"How black?" burst from Tangye. It was an odd question.</p>

<p>"Black enough to dangle him at a rope's end," was Pointer's
reply. Made with calculated brutality. "Those notes together with
those keys in his luggage will do the trick alone."</p>

<p>"You forget I saw the keys here at the house long after Mrs.
Tangye was dead," Tangye said instantly. He evidently was not too
rattled to think swiftly.</p>

<p>"So if Mr. Vardon says Mrs. Tangye handed them to him, or
dropped them in his room by accident, as she gave him the money,
he's lying?" pounced the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>Tangye splashed the soda water that he was pouring out, in a
fine fireman's spray over himself. He set the tumbler down
hastily, and mopped. Then he picked up the glass again. He
hesitated. Finally he almost threw it on a side-table and poked
the fire. Very much to its detriment.</p>

<p>"I must have mistaken some other bunch of keys for my wife's.
Obviously that's what I did. Miss Saunders' probably. But in any
case there's no question of murder, nor of foul play of any kind
here. As a matter of fact, solid fact," he glanced at Wilmot and
flushed, "Mrs. Tangye shot herself. That's the honest truth. She
<i>did</i> commit suicide. I meant to keep it to myself. But of
course I can't let a man be arrested for what never happened. And
that's why I believe she let him have the money. It would be all
of one piece."</p>

<p>"You're sure Mrs. Tangye's death was suicide?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"Haven't I just said so? I might as well be hung for a sheep
as a lamb. She told me she was going to do it. Told me on Monday
afternoon. I didn't believe her&mdash;then!"</p>

<p>Wilmot had hard work not to show how great was his triumph at
this news. Even as it was, a good deal leaked through.</p>

<p>"And about those keys of Mrs. Tangye's found among Mr.
Vardon's things. Have you any idea how they got in his
possession?" Pointer asked thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I? How should I have?"</p>

<p>"Just so." Pointer spoke regretfully. "I was afraid of that.
Doubtless there's no explanation possible that lets him out.
Well, of course, they're pretty damning, and plain,
evidence."</p>

<p>"Evidence of what? Why the devil do you harp on those keys?
Ten to one as he says, Mrs. Tangye dropped them in his rooms when
she sat talking over the business deal."</p>

<p>"But they were seen here at Riverview after she returned. At
four."</p>

<p>"Who saw them? I told you I wasn't sure of which bunch I
saw."</p>

<p>"But Florence is sure."</p>

<p>"Florence! Florence has muddled them with other times.
Florence!" Tangye repeated irritably. "I tell you Mrs. Tangye
shot herself. And that sad fact makes your suspicions
absurd."</p>

<p>Tangye turned to the soda water. He had replenished his
glass.</p>

<p>Pointer had been standing playing with the lever, apparently
idly. It seemed to be jammed. Tangye took out his penknife and
with a few neat touches set it going again. He was talking as he
worked.</p>

<p>"Thrown up my hand, haven't I? But damn it all, there is a
limit to what one can do for filthy lucre. Mrs. Tangye," he
pulled himself up. "But no matter. Where was I?"</p>

<p>"You were telling us about what she said on Monday."</p>

<p>"I got back from Norfolk about five. She&mdash;well&mdash;" He
paused as though at a loss how to tell the facts, and yet not be
lacking in decency to the dead. "We quarrelled. Badly. Finally
she said that she was going to end it. To kill herself. I said
something like 'don't do anything foolish,' and she turned on me
saying that 'what she was going to do was wise&mdash;not foolish,
whatever I might think.' I went up to town hoping that things
would calm down of themselves. You know what happened next day
before I saw her again. I think she delayed that shot till just
about time for me to get to Riverview." He was very pale. "Life's
a mad thing." He said after a pause, "Damned mad."</p>

<p>"I knew it was suicide all along," Wilmot said quietly. "I can
send in the report of your statement to my Company, of
course?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"And exactly why did you say her death was due to an
accident?" Pointer asked eyeing the repairs done to the lever
with an apparently absent-minded gaze. They were quite up to the
standard of the work necessary to arrange that camera.</p>

<p>"Why brand myself as a suicide's husband? Why broadcast our
domestic unhappiness? No one guessed it. There was nothing overt.
We got on each other's nerves from the first, that was all."</p>

<p>"The firm of Deakin and O'Malley was hammered on the Dublin
Stock Exchange this morning. I am to understand then that your
firm is not involved in its difficulties?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"You've been listening to idle rumours," Tangye said suavely.
"My firm is in no difficulties. I can't say that the hammer may
not be heard to-day over there&mdash;" he glanced from his
windows toward where the city lay, "but not for me."</p>

<p>He spoke with conviction. His only mistake was to let a note
of triumph creep into his voice. There was a village blacksmith's
ring of "something accomplished, something done," about that, and
his gaze, that told of strenuous effort and hard-won success.</p>

<p>"And you think that after a quarrel with her husband, of the
kind you suggest on Monday, a wife would kill herself Tuesday,
leaving everything to that husband?" Pointer asked again.</p>

<p>"It's what happened here. Mrs. Tangye was a very fair-minded
woman, when there was no question of her temper leading her
wrong. She was a splendid character at bottom. Possibly on the
other hand, she may not have remembered her will, any more than I
did at first." He spoke the last words very clearly.</p>

<p>"Naturally," Wilmot assured him pleasantly. Pointer shot him
an amused look. He was sure that Wilmot would find anything
"natural" which backed up Tangye's confession that his wife had
killed herself.</p>

<p>"And now to get down to facts," Pointer might have been
Haviland, "would you be more explicit as to the trouble between
yourself and your wife? What exactly did Mrs. Tangye say on
Monday?"</p>

<p>Tangye gave a short laugh. Not of mirth.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you half nor a quarter of what she said. I don't
think she could herself, if she were alive, poor girl. You know
what a woman is when she's beside herself with some fancied
grievance."</p>

<p>"Try and remember as much as you can," Pointer suggested
prosaically. "For the fact that Mrs. Tangye wrote to Mr. Stewart,
yours and her solicitor, asking him to notify your firm that she
wished to withdraw the ten thousand pounds invested by her in it,
makes the quarrel very important."</p>

<p>Tangye's lids drooped over his rather bold eyes. He stood
silent for a moment. Then he wheeled smartly about. The very
sound of his heels told that he had made up his mind. He walked
to the door.</p>

<p>"Excuse me a moment." He was gone.</p>

<p>Wilmot looked at Pointer. His eyes waved the flag of victory.
"I <i>knew</i> I couldn't be wrong!" he said softly. "I knew it
<i>must</i> be suicide!" Pointer slipped out of the door like a
shadow. Wilmot thought that there was something unpleasant in
seeing such a big man move so silently. There was more here than
mere absence of sound. Pointer's very body seemed to blur with
the shadows of the dark day.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector stood a second in the hall beside Rogers
the constable, listening intently. Then he stole swiftly up the
stairs to the first landing. He made for a little sitting-room
taken over by Miss Saunders. There he heard a low murmur. In a
second a police "stethescope" was pressed against the crack. The
ends in his ears. "Very well," he heard Miss Saunders say. "I'm
quite ready. I felt sure it would come."</p>

<p>There was a stir.</p>

<p>Pointer was sitting in the same chair as before and in the
same attitude when Tangye opened the door again, this time for
Miss Saunders to precede him. She was self-possessed as always.
Very sure of herself, in her prim way.</p>

<p>"I think Miss Saunders should hear what I am obliged to say,"
Tangye said briskly. Shutting the door resolutely behind him. His
manner was positively business-like.</p>

<p>"You asked me now, Chief Inspector, what my late wife and I
quarrelled over on Monday when I returned from my week-end. I'm
sorry to say it was over her having unexpectedly found out that
Miss Saunders and I had gone for a spin in my car Sunday
afternoon. We met at Tunbridge Wells. Lunched together at an
hotel there, and drove around to the orchid-show. By bad luck my
wife happened to be there, too, and caught sight of us. After
all, there was nothing wrong in what we did. Injudicious, of
course. We both see that now?" he finished.</p>

<p>"Quite so. Injudicious, but not wrong," Miss Saunders echoed
letting her eyes for a second dart from face to face.</p>

<p>"If you would like to question Miss Saunders, I think she
would be kind enough to answer you," Tangye went on.</p>

<p>"I don't think there's any need of anything so painful,"
Pointer said stolidly but with his eyes on the other man.</p>

<p>They were large eyes. Very quiet eyes. Very clear eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, then," Tangye went on, almost as though dictating a
letter, "as I said, Mrs. Tangye saw us."</p>

<p>"And you didn't see her?"</p>

<p>"I didn't. Did you, Miss Saunders?" Tangye turned to her. She
shook her head.</p>

<p>"Please say whether you did or not?" Tangye ordered, still
with that indefinable tone of brisk command of the situation in
his voice. He might have been sailing a yacht, with a breeze
blowing that just suited him and his boat.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't see her," Miss Saunders spoke up briskly
too.</p>

<p>"Yet we stayed in the show some time. How long would you
think?" he went on.</p>

<p>"About two hours, I fancy."</p>

<p>"I put it about that too," he nodded. "I thought it better not
to see Miss Saunders off in the train, so we said good-bye
outside the station."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Tangye looked around on his hearers almost
as though expecting applause. Obviously Pointer and Wilmot were
being treated to a benefit performance. But whose benefit?
Tangye's, or Miss Saunders', or the absent Vardon's. Miss
Saunders rose and slipped quietly from the room.</p>

<p>"And now perhaps you'll be able to tell us some of the things
your wife said to you on this Monday afternoon?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>Tangye shook his head. "I'm afraid I don't remember much. She
was absolutely unlike herself. We've had quarrels before, of
course. But never one like that. I quite misunderstood the
position. You see, I thought&mdash;I fancied she was bluffing.
Mrs. Tangye, I mean. I had an idea&mdash;totally wrong as it
turned out&mdash;that she was not nearly so angry as she chose to
seem. I thought she was overdoing it. I see now that it was
hysteria, and dangerous hysteria at that. But I give you my word
that I only thought then she had decided to give me a bit of a
scare so as to teach me not to do that sort of thing again."</p>

<p>"That's very interesting," Pointer said slowly. "She struck
you as really not angry? You thought it acting?"</p>

<p>"I swear I did. Overdone acting at that. I thought she was
forcing the note all the way along. More fool I!" Tangye sighed
heavily. His brief air of triumph had entirely left him.</p>

<p>"Did she ask you to leave the house?" Pointer put in.</p>

<p>Tangye seemed to feel a sudden check. He hesitated for a
second. "Possibly. I think she did say that among the flood of
other things."</p>

<p>"You weren't discussing money affairs then?"</p>

<p>Tangye stiffened. "I don't understand."</p>

<p>Pointer gave him no explanation, as rising, he made his way to
the drawing-room where Miss Saunders sat reading.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know about Mr. Vardon," he began chattily. She
stared at him.</p>

<p>"Know what?"</p>

<p>"Well, strictly in confidence, it looks very much as though we
might have to arrest him in connection with Mrs. Tangye's
death."</p>

<p>Miss Saunders' face flamed a brick red. Her lips parted in a
curious tense look, drawn away from her rather long teeth.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vardon? Mrs. Tangye's death? What are you talking about?"
There was a spark in the depths of her bright, rat-like eyes.</p>

<p>Pointer repeated that certain facts had come to their
knowledge which unless explained, looked very bad for Mr. Vardon.
The presence of her keys in his luggage, for one thing.</p>

<p>Miss Saunders sat tapping the end of her thumb nail against
her clenched teeth. It was the gesture of one uncertain what to
do. What to say. "And of course, Mr. Tangye let you think it!"
she said under her breath.</p>

<p>Pointer looked at her meaningly and nodded.</p>

<p>Miss Saunders gave a little sound as though she were
choking.</p>

<p>"Why do you think Mrs. Tangye's death was a murder?" she
asked. There was no hesitation about her use of that terrible
word. No look of shrinking in her face. Yet she had lived three
years with the woman about whom she was putting that grisly
question. She might have been a collector inquiring, why an
expert thought his Goya drawing to be a Mengs. There was intense,
burning interest in the coming answer, but no personal
emotion.</p>

<p>"Well, we do. The outlook for every one in the house is quite
altered by the mere supposition. To come to the point of this
interview, your own alibi is unsatisfactory."</p>

<p>That got home. She bit her lip.</p>

<p>"It's not genuine. Miss Martins, as I believe the manageress
of the tea-room is called, mistook you evidently for another
customer. In any case the fact that she is your sister would
discount her evidence. There's no use your denying what we know,
Miss Saunders," as she opened her lips, "the matter is too
serious for that. Where were you really between four and six
Tuesday?" His voice came sharp and stern. She licked her thin
lips with a tongue that shot out like a snake's, swift and
furtive.</p>

<p>"At the library and then in the tea-room. My alibi is quite
good. As to its having been substantiated by my sister&mdash;why
not? She's in charge at the tea-room. Others may have seen me
there if you've frightened her into some mistake. I won't pretend
to misunderstand you, you know. But what possible cause should I
have had for harming Mrs. Tangye?"</p>

<p>Pointer bent forward and stared hard at her. She blinked.
"Why, you yourself have been trying to force the note of
your&mdash;understanding&mdash;with Mr. Tangye."</p>

<p>This time she turned a genuine and ghastly gray.</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" she rose to her feet and her eyes widened.
"Blundering idiots I If I had killed her, wouldn't I be the first
to snatch at the chance of accusing Mr. Vardon? But I tell you he
didn't do it Oh, you fool! You damned fool!" She shivered with
fury. Pointer thought for a second that she would actually fly at
him. Her small eyes, set close together like those of a bird,
seemed to snap fire, so fierce was their glare.</p>

<p>The door opened. But why had Tangye paused once again outside
to listen?</p>

<p>Miss Saunders passed him with one contemptuous, yet menacing
glance.</p>

<p>"What in the world&mdash;" Tangye began. "I stepped in to ask
if you would be a witness to my statement, which Wilmot is taking
down. My formal renouncement of the Insurance claim on my
wife."</p>

<p>Pointer followed him back into his den.</p>

<p>"Bit previous," Pointer glanced down at the paper. "It may not
be Vardon, but it may not be suicide, either." Wilmot looked put
out. The case was as good as over as far as he was concerned. He
was mentally drafting a cable to his little Galician village, at
the same time as this letter of Tangye's.</p>

<p>"You mean you <i>will</i> make a murder out of it?"</p>

<p>Tangye's last whisky had been nearly neat.</p>

<p>"I assure you," Pointer said gently, as he had to say so
often, "that Scotland Yard is not Moloch, to be fed with human
sacrifices, innocent or guilty, no matter which, so long as the
supply doesn't run short. If Mrs. Tangye's death was a suicide,
you may be sure that that will end the inquiry, and we shall turn
our attention elsewhere. But we must get the thing clearly worked
out. That's part of the routine."</p>

<p>Pointer left the two alone at that, and took a turn in the
garden. The robin, whose preserve this was, eyed him hopefully.
Pointer looked energetic. He might be going to use a spade. But
the Chief Inspector was oblivious of fluting call or confident
bright eyes. He was thinking. So it was to be suicide. According
to Tangye. But according to Pointer? That was what really
mattered.</p>

<p>It was a very sudden right-about-turn, this of Tangye's.
Neatly executed, but very sudden. Was it the peril in which
Tangye learnt for the first time that a man stood whom he
considered innocent? Or was it something else, deeper? Was what
seemed disinterestedness self-interest? Did Tangye suddenly
realise that the question of murder was in the air? Did he want
to scotch, not so much a present, unfounded accusation, as a
possibly well-founded one in the future? Did he see himself as
Vardon's successor in the list of suspects, and decided to block
that eventuality? Or was the widower merely a belatedly honest
man? Was Wilmot right? Had Haviland been right in the beginning?
Was Mrs. Tangye's death, after all, self-inflicted, in spite of
smoky room and scratched revolver? Or were Tangye and Vardon in
collusion? Those keys...</p>

<p>Returning to the house he and Wilmot took their leave.</p>

<p>"My field day, I think!" the newspaper man stepped out
cheerily; "we've got the motive. You were right about it having
been that Sunday down at Tunbridge that practically fired the
shot. The husband throws up his claim&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The investigator packs his trunks, sends in his bill, and
flits to sunnier climes," Pointer finished the picture.</p>

<p>Wilmot chortled.</p>

<p>"Of course you, as the representative of the law, tried to
spoil it all. But nothing will undo the fact that Tangye
confesses he was only trying it on with the Insurance society.
He's obviously however, not the man to hang an innocent chap. I
think Tangye's genuinely shocked to find that by trying to
swindle the Company out of that insurance payment, he's tying the
noose around the neck of another. He comes forward and says very
honestly that his wife told him in so many words that she
intended to kill herself."</p>

<p>"But she didn't!"</p>

<p>"Didn't kill herself? I think&mdash;in spite of many
difficulties, perplexities&mdash;that she did."</p>

<p>"Of course you do. No offence, Wilmot, but that's what the
Company expects you to do until actually convinced. That's your
brief."</p>

<p>Wilmot looked at him with surprise on his face. "Do you mean
to say that you suspect this double confession or confidence, of
just now? In Heaven's name, why?"</p>

<p>"Why should I believe it? That's more to the point."</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, it's too bad!" Wilmot's voice was frankly
peevish. Here was the case, his case, settled, and here was this
obstinate policeman still holding up the traffic.</p>

<p>"There are two sides to every question," Pointer reminded
him.</p>

<p>"Not to a circle. A never-ending circle, which this case seems
to be in your eyes," was Wilmot's tart rejoinder. "Indeed? What
about inside and outside?"</p>

<p>Wilmot laughed, almost against his will. "What makes you doubt
what we've just heard?" he asked finally.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow! If Tangye had carried a banner inscribed,
'I'm doing a neat bit of acting. What price a brain-wave?' It
couldn't have been clearer. Miss Saunders too, was very pleased
with her star-turn. In the beginning."</p>

<p>They reached the station. Haviland had returned. He now
listened eagerly.</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought Tangye wouldn't be able to explain away the
fact of those keys!" Haviland said gleefully. "Funny he should
try to. I wonder what really did happen to them?"</p>

<p>"I wonder too," Pointer said. "Certain it is that Tangye could
tell us if he wished to."</p>

<p>"Looks as though Vardon and Tangye have an understanding of
some sort, in fact," Haviland thought. "And that's why Miss
Saunders wanted to help him as well as Tangye&mdash;at least, I
suppose that's why..."</p>

<p>"She's the owner of a 'one-good-turn-a-day' nature, you think?
You two chaps make me tired. Forgive my frankness," Wilmot
stifled a yawn, "but why cudgel your brains for some recondite
solution? Miss Saunders and Tangye went off on Sunday. She's
quite willing to snatch at any alleviation on the sly. Like most
of her sex. Tangye's right; there's no murder here. There's
suicide. And there's possibly, but only possibly, a theft."</p>

<p>"Suicide? Because Mrs. Tangye saw her husband and her
companion looking at orchids together? Her sense of proportion
must have been out of action. Come, Wilmot, you don't believe
that yourself!"</p>

<p>"I believe," Wilmot said earnestly, "that Mrs. Tangye had far
more ground than that. Far more reason. That she had fought a
losing battle well and long. That finding she was steadily being
driven back, in spite of all her efforts, she got tired of the
useless struggle, and ended it. That has, up to now, been my
theory, unless it really was an accident. Failing either of
those, my own mind turns more and more to that missing cousin of
hers. The man with the love of money and the streak of cruelty in
his character. I suppose you're getting into touch with the
Frenchman, Filon?"</p>

<p>"Trying to. Also with Fez. There, of course, we shall have no
difficulty. They will doubtless be able to furnish us with
photographs and finger-prints of the man they shot. The man who
called himself Olivier."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>

<p class="first">
POINTER had found one other thing among Vardon's effects which
might have a bearing on the case. This was a packet of four
letters tied with a shoe-lace. They were all from an address
which he had seen already given in the police reports as the home
of Sir Richard Ash, the partner of the late Branscombe.</p>

<p>The notes were short ones. Beginning "Dear Philip," and ending
"Sincerely yours, Barbara Ash."</p>

<p>And sincere enough the writer seemed to have been. Phrases
such as "you're sleeping life away," varied with, "can't you wake
up, and show what's really in you?" Once came the surprising
aphorism, "There's no use your saying that content's a jewel. It
isn't. It's awfully cheap paste."</p>

<p>Pointer had sat awhile thinking, after he read them. All but
one were undated. The envelopes were missing, but the shortness,
the absence of general news, the thick linen paper suggested that
the notes had been sent to some one in England. They were the
kind of letters that might be expected to have some effect. Had
they stirred a man up to commit a crime? It was possible. It
would depend on the man, and on whether they came as a final
touch on the dipping scales of right and wrong. The keys were a
different matter.</p>

<p>These damning keys. Seen in the morning-room at Riverview just
before the end&mdash;if Florence was right&mdash;and found lying
among a lot of oddments in the bottom of Vardon's valise marked
for the hold. Pointer did not think that they had been slipped in
after the things on top had been packed. Apart from how Vardon
had got hold of them, why had he kept them? Were they to be used
again? If so, why pack them in the bottom, and in a bag not
intended for the voyage?</p>

<p>"A gentleman from New Scotland Yard to see you, sir," Bates
announced immediately after the interview with Tangye, laying
Pointer's card down beside the young man who sat reading the
<i>Araucana.</i> In spirit back in the New World, listening to a
war-chief's song.</p>

<p>Fiery and fresh, the lines still hummed in his head.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I&mdash;eh&mdash;" Before he could collect his
thoughts sufficiently to finish his protest, Pointer was bowing
to him. Vardon did not ask what the Chief Inspector wanted. He
waited. Pointer explained himself at once.</p>

<p>"I'm in charge of the investigations about that missing money.
Would you mind telling me how the note which has been traced to
you, came into your possession? I ought to tell you that a
criminal charge may follow, and that, if so, what you say may be
used against you. You are quite at liberty to refuse to
answer&mdash;if you think it wise."</p>

<p>Vardon looked as though greatly tempted to avail himself of
the freedom. But after a moment, he told Pointer the same story
as he had the solicitor.</p>

<p>"And how do you explain the fact that her keys have been found
in your luggage?" the Chief Inspector asked when the artist was
silent.</p>

<p>"Her keys? Impossible! Mrs. Tangye's keys!" Vardon sat open-mouthed.</p>

<p>Pointer said that it was true, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Vardon, after staring at him, as though he might be joking,
finally suggested that Mrs. Tangye must have dropped them
unnoticed on his table when she was in his room. The artist went
on to say that he had started his packing, by shaking the
tablecloth into his valise, and then throwing in other things on
top. The valise bore out this simple method.</p>

<p>"What hour did Mrs. Tangye come to your room?"</p>

<p>"About three."</p>

<p>"And what hour did you start packing?"</p>

<p>Vardon thought that he had begun about a quarter past eleven,
when he came in from a musical play to which he had gone.</p>

<p>"Did you have any other visitors in your rooms on
Tuesday?"</p>

<p>Vardon said that, as far as he knew, nobody had come to see
him.</p>

<p>"And now, why did you&mdash;well&mdash;decamp, when
Superintendent Haviland and an inspector of his called on you
yesterday morning?"</p>

<p>Vardon flushed hotly. Up and up, the crimson surged, until his
very ears burned a brick red against his fair hair.</p>

<p>"I lost my head," he said bitterly. "I wanted time to think
things over."</p>

<p>"And to get rid of the remainder of the notes," Pointer
finished to himself.</p>

<p>"Few people care to be caught in a tight corner by the
police," Vardon went on. "That note I got Mrs. Tangye to write
was in my bag. My bag had gone. Not that it's of any value except
for that precious bit of paper. You must confess the outlook was
pretty bad for me."</p>

<p>Naturally, since a man cannot be both hare and hound, Pointer
never considered any outlook so bad that jockeying the police
would better it.</p>

<p>"May I ask&mdash;by the way, we're verifying the whereabouts
of every one, of course&mdash;merely a matter of
routine&mdash;where you were this last Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Sunday?" Vardon seemed puzzled. "At a concert in the Albert
Hall."</p>

<p>"Meet any friends?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Did you go alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And Monday afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Writing letters in my diggings."</p>

<p>"And Tuesday afternoon, from four to six?"</p>

<p>Vardon waited a moment as though to be quite sure.</p>

<p>"I did a lot of strolling through shops generally," he said
vaguely.</p>

<p>"You were seen near Twickenham on a motor-bicycle about five,"
Pointer said suddenly. "Can you explain that?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of calling on a friend who lives out that way.
Then I changed my mind. Half decided to call on Mrs. Tangye and
ask a question about the sending off the rest of the money.
Thought better of that, too. Decided that I was too wrought up to
think clearly, and roamed the shops instead, chiefly the Army and
Navy stores."</p>

<p>"Just so. But may I ask why you didn't mention this trip
across the river just now? Why you didn't tell it me
voluntarily?"</p>

<p>The worm turned.</p>

<p>"Does any one ever tell anything voluntarily to the police?"
Vardon asked, and Pointer's eye acknowledged the hit. "You didn't
go to Riverview itself last Tuesday?"</p>

<p>"I only wish I had." Vardon leant forward. "I looked at my
watch as I crossed Richmond Bridge. It was a little before five.
Had I gone on, it might have made all the difference. A chat
sometimes does."</p>

<p>"Were you on friendly terms with Mrs. Tangye?'</p>

<p>"I'd never met her before. She came up last Tuesday
unannounced. As she came in she introduced herself."</p>

<p>"I see. You never went to see your cousin after his
marriage?"</p>

<p>Vardon played with the covers of the book beside him. He had
the true artist's hands. Small-boned, slender.</p>

<p>"Once. Our parents had not been on good terms. He was much
older than I. By chance Mrs. Branscombe was out that day. Just
as, by chance, I was in South America when they married, and at
sea the day he died."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tangye was different, you say, from what you
expected?"</p>

<p>"Rather!"</p>

<p>"And how was it that you had so clear an idea of what she
would be like? Since you had never met her?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;I had heard of her, you know. Got an
impression of a rather masterful character&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see." Pointer looked at his boot tips as he sat resting his
head on one hand. "Have you written to Mrs. Tangye lately?"
Pointer asked next.</p>

<p>Vardon hesitated. Palpably.</p>

<p>"I think I've said all on the subject that I care to say, for
the present," he said finally.</p>

<p>"So you <i>did</i> write? You did ask her for money? You see,
I've no intention of being unnecessarily prying, but we know that
you came home from South America some ten months ago now, and
approached various people in the city with a view to interesting
them in some proposition of yours. Now it seems likely that you
would have mentioned the matter to the woman who had inherited
all your cousin's money. Was the proposition a gold mine, as they
say?"</p>

<p>"In a way. I'm afraid I can't discuss it with you." There was
a silence. "Don't think I'm keeping anything back that can help
you." Vardon went on quickly, "to my mind, what will help you
best, would be to make you realise Mrs. Tangye's whole manner on
Tuesday. She struck me as being in a most extraordinary&mdash;I
don't know what to call it&mdash;moodstate of mind? She was
paying me one thousand five hundred pounds in ready money. Not
being a rich woman, that must have meant something to her. It did
to me, by Jove. Yet she gave me a feeling that she wanted to get
it over, and be at something else. I doubt if ever such a large
sum was given to a totally unexpecting person with such casual
speed." For the first time Vardon smiled a little. "She tugged
the envelope out of her handbag and handed it to me..."</p>

<p>"One moment! Was it already in an envelope? I mean didn't she
have to separate it from any other notes?"</p>

<p>"No. She had two envelopes. The other looked about the same
size. She handed me the one without looking at it. She asked me
to count the money. I could hardly see. I had to count it four
times, and each time it added up to something different. So I let
it go at that, and pretended to find it correct. I had to almost
hold on to her to get her to sit down and write that note saying
that it was a loan, before she was out of the room in a sort of
whirl of hurry and flurry. <i>I</i> felt that way, of course.
<i>I</i> had a hundred things to do. But I should have expected
Mrs. Tangye, or any woman, to talk a lot. Give me some good
advice. Ask questions as to how it would be first applied. But
no. All the business part of the interview I had to force on her.
She acted as though she had handed me a ticket for Peter Pan. I
can't explain it except by her intending to kill herself."</p>

<p>"What makes you so sure?"</p>

<p>"This gift of the money, for one thing. I didn't see it at the
time in that light, naturally, but above all, her manner, her air
of being done with things. Finished with them. I can't express
clearly what made me think that. For, after that loan of the
money, the rest was a confused jumble, but the impression was
made very clearly.</p>

<p>"One thing I'm certain of. If it wasn't suicide, then it was
accident. Mrs. Tangye struck me as just the kind of woman to have
an accident with a weapon. She was very hasty in her movements.
Very impatient. I can imagine her snatching at something that
caught in her laces, and giving a pull. Thank God, if the shot
had to be fatal, at least, it was instantaneous." And at that
Varden walked to the window to raise it.</p>

<p>As he did so, he all but tripped. It was but a second's catch
in his step, but Pointer, like Wilmot, thought of those words of
the maid.</p>

<p>"And what exactly was it that made you change your mind on
Tuesday about going on to see her? When you were so near
Riverview."</p>

<p>"I thought it seemed rather ridiculous. Like an interchange of
state visits. She had been to see me at three. I to run in to see
her at five. I didn't want her to think that I was going to sit
in her pocket."</p>

<p>"You didn't pass the house?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you know the companion at Riverview?"</p>

<p>Vardon started. Whether because of the question, or because
his mind was on something else, it was impossible to tell.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"My I ask the name of the friend who lives out Twickenham
way?"</p>

<p>"You may not. Sorry."</p>

<p>Pointer was fairly certain that it was Barbara Ash.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vardon, we want nothing in the world, nothing," Pointer
spoke very convincingly, "but to get at the truth about the death
of Mrs. Tangye. That's the only reason, I assure you, why I ask
unpleasant questions, dig up uncomfortable things, and generally
make myself a confounded nuisance. The only things I'm interested
in, the only things I remember, are what help on the search. A
search for truth, remember. Truth and justice. Nothing else.</p>

<p>"You say you think Mrs. Tangye's death was a suicide. I don't.
But if you could convince yourself that we don't want you, or any
man, unless he's guilty, we might be able to help each other.</p>

<p>"If you're guilty, of course you must do the best for yourself
you can. I think I should get you in the end," Pointer gave the
other a knife-like look. "But if you're innocent, I assure you
that no one&mdash;not even the girl you were going to see Tuesday
'out Twickenham way,' can want more earnestly to prove you so.
For that means a step nearer to the right man, the guilty
man."</p>

<p>It was a long speech for Pointer. But it had done its
work&mdash;apparently. Vardon seemed in a more friendly mood.
"You mean I'm as suspect as all that?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, things look very black against you."</p>

<p>"But how could there be a murder here? Why? Mrs. Tangye wasn't
the kind of a woman to stir people to violent emotion either way,
I should have thought. She seemed a nice, warm-hearted, hot-tempered, high-spirited woman."</p>

<p>Why hot-tempered and high-spirited, Pointer wondered.</p>

<p>"You say, she wasn't the kind of woman to stir people deeply,"
the Chief Inspector repeated. "I'm afraid the fact that she very
likely had some fifteen hundred pounds, on, or near her, last
Tuesday afternoon, and that they may have thought she had three
thousand with her, would stir some hearts to their very
foundations."</p>

<p>Vardon showed an aghast face. He asked about the money.
Pointer told him the outlines of the land sale, and then
questioned him about his work.</p>

<p>Vardon spoke interestingly of it. He had started out as a
painter of portraits in Buenos Aires. Come down to barns, fences,
and signposts in Argentina, then, so he told
Pointer&mdash;drifted to Patagonia, taken up photography when he
had a frozen right wrist that refused to limber up&mdash;and now
was working as a film photographer of wild animals. Of the
creatures that live lives so like, yet so unlike our own.</p>

<p>Pointer asked him whether he could change his own film camera
into one that would carry plates, and the two discussed
mechanical means. Vardon showed an expert's skill in taking a
kodak to pieces that he drew out of his pocket, and re-assembling
it.</p>

<p>Finally Pointer questioned him about the lost bag. Vardon did
not seem in a hurry to let him have the details.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's gone for good. Left in the taxi probably.
Fortunately, except for that paper of Mrs. Tangye's, there was
nothing of value in it."</p>

<p>"Rather an important exception," Pointer said dryly. He had
ascertained that the young man had not acted as though there was
nothing of any value in the bag when he first learned of its
disappearance.</p>

<p>"Very much so," Vardon agreed. "I thought I gave it to the
page-boy when I drove up. But they deny that. I was paying the
cabby at the time, who was slow about making the right change.
Then in the lounge, after a room had been given me, I stayed down
looking up time-tables and comparing routes. It must have been
nearly half an hour later that I finally went upstairs. Even then
I didn't miss the bag at once. When I did, I ran downstairs but
the hotel denied all knowledge of it. We got a bit warm, and I
went off to another hotel."</p>

<p>"Did you go back to the first one afterwards to inquire?"</p>

<p>"I did, naturally. I asked for the manager. And the band
played the same tune as before. Hall porter, lift-boy, chamber-maid, and reception-clerk. I think on the whole, now I'm cooler,
that they're doubtless right. I must have left it in the cab or
at my old diggings. Or on the pavement outside while I waited for
the taxi to come up."</p>

<p>Pointer knew that on Wednesday morning, Vardon had made every
effort to get the bag traced. He had telephoned Scotland Yard
about its loss, describing its contents as chiefly papers of no
value except to the owner but offering a reward of five pounds
for its return. He had sent a similar announcement to be inserted
in the personals of the <i>Morning Post.</i> His message to the
"Lost" department had been very urgent. He had spoken as though
greatly concerned to recover the bag. Now he professed himself
quite prepared to accept its loss as a definite fact. Yet, in it,
so he claimed, was this important paper. Pointer thought that
Vardon on the whole, would prefer the bag not to be found. And
the Chief Inspector wondered why. Was the paper, the important
half-sheet, with Mrs. Tangye's words on it, really in the bag? If
so, was it accompanied by other papers of which he wished the
police to remain in ignorance?</p>

<p>Had there been a bag at all, or had there not?</p>

<p>Pointer's last questions were about Tangye. Vardon said he
knew him fairly well. Had he approached him about this "gold
mine" of his in South America? Vardon at once said that he had
written to ask if the subject would interest him, and had
received a pleasant but definite letter saying that Tangye never
speculated or went in for possibly risky investments. As to
Riverview itself, Vardon had spent many a week there as a lad. It
had belonged to his grandparents.</p>

<p>Pointer spoke of Oliver Headly. Vardon had met him once by
chance on a boat crossing to South America about eight years ago,
and taken a great dislike to the man whom he spoke of as a
disgrace to his race.</p>

<p>Did he know what had become of him? Vardon said that save for
the fact that he had made Latin America too hot to hold him, he
had heard nothing of him.</p>

<p>Pointer found Haviland waiting for him at the Yard. Ostensibly
with some housebreaker's finger-prints to be verified, but in
reality to hear how the interview had gone. He had no doubt as to
the guilty man. Vardon's flight, he thought, meant just that. And
his explanations, he considered very poor.</p>

<p>"In fact, I never saw a poorer case," he repeated now for the
third time. "The money traced to him. He confesses to having the
whole of the missing sum, and he takes good care to get it into
the hands of a confederate. Keys of her safe and doors found in
his possession. Proof that he knows the dead woman's companion.
Proof that he was seen hanging around the house at the time of
the death. Why, it's a cert, for a fact!"</p>

<p>"Dorset Steele's a good man," Pointer murmured, "no better
criminal solictor in town." The wording was ambiguous, but
Haviland agreed.</p>

<p>"Still, not all the lawyers' brains in the Kingdom can talk
away facts. But it's odd he doesn't seem to give a damn for the
bag now. It should be all important to him, and that's a fact.
But with, or without it, his solicitor'll have his work cut out
to get him off, if you choose to have him arrested."</p>

<p>"That's just it." Pointer seemed finally convinced that his
boot tips had nothing more to tell him. "That's just it,
Haviland. Send Vardon up for trial, and accuse him of Mrs.
Tangye's murder, and I doubt if he'd have a dog's chance of
getting off without at least penal servitude for life."</p>

<p>"You don't think he's guilty, sir? Not after those keys?" It
was not so much a question as an exclamation.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't see what answer he could make to such a charge,
in fact," Haviland said in a distinctly disappointed tone.
Visions of returning with Vardon handcuffed fading from his mind.
He bore the young man a grudge. He had all but cost Henry
Haviland his official life.</p>

<p>Dorset Steele was thinking very much what Haviland was saying
as he ordered his lunch. He sat staring at his meat with such a
suspicious air, that the waiter hovered near anxiously.</p>

<p>"Tough job!" muttered the solicitor, stabbing at the plate
with his fork.</p>

<p>"Tough chop?" repeated Smithers horrified. "Indeed, sir?" and
whisking it off, he retired in person to the grill.</p>

<p>Dorset Steele gulped down a glass of port, followed it with
boiled potatoes, and rising, under the impression that he had had
his usual meal, passed out.</p>

<p>"Miss Barbara waiting to see you, sir," he was told at his
office. A young girl who looked about twenty&mdash;she was six
years older&mdash;light of foot as Atalanta ran up to him.</p>

<p>"I couldn't get to you before, grandfather, how did it go?
Will he be all right?"</p>

<p>"Nice muddle you've got the firm into," he said testily. "The
young man is guilty."</p>

<p>"Guilty of stealing that money? Oh, no I No!"</p>

<p>"If he can't find the bag, supposing he's definitely arrested,
that's what the jury will say, and that's all that matters!"</p>

<p>Barbara pulled a chair up, stood on it, and laid her cheek
against his wild, gray hair.</p>

<p>"How you frightened me till I remembered it was only you now
tell me all&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>He told her, peering at her every now and then over his
glasses. She was a pleasant sight. A pretty girl, if the term be
not taken too strictly. She was tall, slender, erect; with bright
brown eyes, bright brown hair, a bright pink and white
complexion, bright rose-red lips, a bright smile, and one beauty.
A laugh of rare charm. Like silver bells ringing in the sunlight.
But she was not laughing now. Dorset Steele had been to see
Pointer. The Chief Inspector had been frank as to the larger
charge that hovered as yet dimly in the background, but which was
to move slowly, inexorably, to the foreground of its own weight
as it were. Barbara listened in silence. She was breathing fast
and tense when the solicitor had finished.</p>

<p>"You think his having been seen near Riverview at that hour so
bad? Grandfather? <i>We</i> live near there, you know," her voice
quivered, "wouldn't it explain matters if people knew that Phil
and I had just got engaged&mdash;secretly? Suppose Mrs. Tangye
had guessed that, and for that reason wanted to help
him&mdash;and me. Philip only asked for the money so as to marry
me, you know."</p>

<p>"Eh?" Dorset Steele wheeled, and stood looking at her like a
rook inspecting a Jenny Wren. Then he took a turn up and down,
his hands under his coat-tails that flapped in time to his
tread.</p>

<p>"You'll break down when you're cross-questioned. For this case
may yet go before a jury. You'll break down, and then where will
we be? Worse off than ever! The jury&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shan't break down. Phil asked me to marry him many times.
And I&mdash;I&mdash;" she hung her head. Two bright drops rolled
slowly over her soft young cheeks. "I don't want to tell a lie,
but I must, oh, I must save him! In my heart I said yes. Surely I
can truthfully say I accepted him. I did in my heart. Where's my
bag, my hanky's in it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"M-m," mumbled the solicitor gruffly, but wiping the tears off
with a very tender touch. "Yes&mdash;that might be a help. He was
hovering around Twickenham on Tuesday to see you? I guessed as
much."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! That's quite true."</p>

<p>"It's all quite true, or it's of no use," snapped Dorset
Steele. "And that about Mrs.
Tangye&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;that might help. But what about
yourself?" he shot the question at her savagely. "What about
yourself, heigh? All the notoriety? All the ordeal? Though you've
grit in you. What about yourself, child?"</p>

<p>"Oh, grandfather," the girl, quite undismayed by his glare,
caught hold of his coat with both hands and buried her face
between them, "if you save him you save all of me. I was such a
pig to him! I thought he was too easy-going, too contented. I
thought he needed waking up. I only talked to him about
money&mdash;money&mdash;money, every time he asked me to marry
him. The last time I jeered at him because he was poor."</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell that to any jury?" stormed Dorset
Steele, apparently beside himself with indignation, but patting
the back of one brown little hand. "Because, if you are, it's all
up with him. There's the motive. Don't you see?" This time he
released himself resolutely. "Barbara, my dear, are you sure he's
innocent?"</p>

<p>She did not raise her head. "Grandfather, you know he's
innocent!" And even the keen old lawyer did not notice that she
had not answered his question.</p>

<p>"M-m, well, perhaps I think so&mdash;but you see his father
and I were old friends&mdash;" then the solicitor shook off his
momentary weakness, "but the only question that concerns us, is
what will the jury think? Now put your bonnet on, and I'll take
you to see him. If you've thought it over. Weighed the
consequences. Heaven knows what your mother will say when she
hears of it!"</p>

<p>"Put my what on? What do you suppose this is?" Barbara touched
the velvet tam o'shanter she wore. "I'm ready. As to
mother&mdash;she's still in Yorkshire."</p>

<p>According to all novelists, Barbara ought to have stopped to
use her powder-puff before starting off. She did not own that
apparently inevitable adjunct to every woman. Certainly Philip
Vardon noticed nothing amiss as the door swung open and Dorset
Steele barking: "I've brought some one to see you," shut it, and
walked the landing outside.</p>

<p>Vardon started up. Pointer had only just left him. He leapt
forward; then he took a step back.</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to've come, Barby. But, how like you! How like
you!"</p>

<p>"Phil, dear Phil!" It was she who ran to him and put both arms
around his neck. "You poor dear boy! You poor darling!"</p>

<p>And after that Vardon took the goods the gods provide but once
in a life, and the two were tragically happy. Sensing danger, yet
content for the moment, till a harsh, irascible, cough sounded
outside.</p>

<p>"It's my grandfather. I must go. Now, remember, we got engaged
last Saturday on the links. I asked you not to tell any
one."'</p>

<p>"It was to see you I biked down to Kew, Tuesday afternoon. I
wanted to tell you what had happened!" He stood looking into the
face he thought so lovely.</p>

<p>"I wish you had come to the house," she sighed.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I remembered that you had said that on Tuesday
you were going to your aunt's at Hampton Court, so I didn't ring.
I didn't want to meet your mother. Not after the last interview I
had with her."</p>

<p>"Mother's a darling. But she knows so little of life. She
doesn't know how to judge," explained her aged daughters There
fell a dead silence. Barbara wished that she had not used that
last word. The door opened with considerable difficulty.</p>

<p>"Ready?" growled Dorset Steele, and started ahead down the
passage.</p>

<p>Barbara took a 'bus back to her home. With every turn of the
wheels her heart grew heavier. She had told her grandfather that
Vardon was innocent, but she felt a sickening doubt as she
thought over the whole position. Now that she was alone by
herself. Away from that atmosphere of suspense, and pity, and
dread. The doubt came first when her thoughts again ran over
their talk last Saturday. It had been on the Richmond links.</p>

<p>Vardon had asked her to marry him. There was another young man
in the offing, and he was jealous. Very jealous. Barbara had
thought this just as well then. Every detail came back to her
now, and added its mite to the growing pile of fear deep down
within her.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get some money?" she had asked impatiently.
"Others get it. Why can't you? Nobody cares how nowadays."</p>

<p>"That's the sort of speech to make a man commit a crime,"
Vardon had said thoughtfully, rather than indignantly.</p>

<p>His words had startled her even then. She had looked at him
half laughing, half impatient. She had been thinking of business.
As she looked round at him his face seemed to her to have
changed. The desire for money exudes a poison gas of its own,
necessary though our modern life has made the shekel. Its blight
lay on Vardon at that moment. It had taken something from his
face, leaving it, even to her eyes, less attractive.</p>

<p>"It's no use asking me if I love you, when you haven't enough
to marry on. Mind you, I don't promise that I should marry you
under any circumstances. What about playing on? Some one else may
possibly want that bunker where your ball has been resting this
half-hour."</p>

<p>Vardon had picked up his niblick. He was the sort of man, she
reflected, who would always use a niblick in a bunker. Barbara
watched him slogging away. The lie was certainly bad. But was he
one to make the best of it? Five explosions clouded the air with
sand and stones before the ball was shot out&mdash;to lie very
close to the pin she had to own. Half the bunker seemed to have
accompanied it.</p>

<p>Barbara gave her own ball a neat little undercut and holed it.
Philip promptly went on with the talk.</p>

<p>"I asked you to marry me just now," he said rather sternly,
"and you pointed out that a poor devil of an artist&mdash;or
photographer, worse yet&mdash;living in Patagonia has no right to
a wife. As Spiers wants to marry you, and is well off, am I to
understand that he will be the lucky man?"</p>

<p>Barbara had known both the men in question since her early
teens. She was not in the least nervous.</p>

<p>"I told you the strick truth, Phil." Voice and face were alike
kind at that moment. "You're letting every opportunity drift past
you. I don't believe you've ever exerted yourself in your life!
What have you to share with a girl? Nothing except fat
content."</p>

<p>"Fat content!" the words stung her as she remembered them to-day. There had been no fat content in the face she had just held
so close to her own. His laugh even then had exasperated her. Why
could she not let him go? But there were times when Vardon seemed
to have Barbara under a reluctant spell. It was his good looks,
she had told herself last Saturday, not the good qualities she
believed underlay his gentleness. She despised man or woman who
was led by the outside of things. Surely she would not be so
disinclined to part, if Phil had a broken nose, and turned his
feet in? She even gifted him with a pair of outstanding ears in
her effort to be honest with herself.</p>

<p>Vardon, quite unconscious of these devastating changes in his
appearance, played on moodily.</p>

<p>"Money is a test nowadays. Of course it's horrid. But you
can't get away from it. Father would like to see the old Mandarin
idea of knowledge the only nobility, but&mdash;" she shook her
head. "So, until you have enough for two to live on, you're not
in the running."</p>

<p>"And dear Spiers passes the post with ease?"</p>

<p>There was no doubt about Vardon having lost his usually sweet
temper. His drive nearly swiped the tee-box off its foundation.
His ball rocketed up to heaven like a Saint Catherine's wheel
surrounded with tufts of grass and debris.</p>

<p>Barbara had eyed him coldly.</p>

<p>She intended to turn away in silence. But at twenty-six it is
still hard to be dignified with an old playfellow.</p>

<p>"Edgar's money would have nothing to do with it in any case,"
she replied loftily. "I don't care any more for him than I do for
you, but at least he can ask a girl to marry without being
ridiculous. And you can't. Not as things stand. Sorry not to
finish the round, but I'm tired."</p>

<p>She meant that she was cross.</p>

<p>"Look here!" he said hotly. "You quote your father. I wonder
what he would say to giving up the round in a fit of sulks?"</p>

<p>Privately Barbara wondered too. But she had an answer ready.
What woman ever runs completely out of that ammunition?</p>

<p>"After your language when you sliced into those briars, I
think he would advise it," she said primly. The very hedge itself
fell back a foot.</p>

<p>Suddenly she laughed. After all youth is youth. Vardon joined
in, and they finished the round in at least neutrality. When it
was over he held a gate shut that led to the high road.</p>

<p>"If I had money, Barby, should I be in the running? If I were
prosperous, and all that, would you marry me?"</p>

<p>"It isn't the money, though it does take that to live
nowadays. It's all that not having money stands for."</p>

<p>"There's that pamphlet of mine on South American lizards..."
he began.</p>

<p>"Finished?" She turned on him with an eager light in her dark
eyes. At the look on his face Barbara flushed in vexation. She
would have liked to shake him. Shake him till the cloak of take-things-as-they-came should drop off him.</p>

<p>"I see," she said in a low tone. "Not finished, still!"</p>

<p>"Hang it all, writing isn't like hurdy-gurdy, that you turn
the handle."</p>

<p>"I think a hurdy-gurdy more to be respected. It would mean
effort. You don't make any. You never have! If we married, people
would say that it was I who married you!"</p>

<p>Barbara thought again of her last glimpse of him. His face had
not looked easy-going at that moment. Vaguely even then, the girl
had felt that instead of doing good she had done harm.</p>

<p>She had meant to prod Philip's better nature awake. Had she
prodded the other side of him instead? It was Barbara's first
qualm on that score. Her first lesson gainst improving her
fellow-mortals. But she had felt so sure that deep within
careless, easy-going Philip Vardon lay a man, generally fast
asleep, who sometimes, at rare intervals, had walked and talked
with her. It was that seldom seen, other Vardon, who had captured
her. He was not in the least like the lazy casual fellow with
whom she generally had to be content. She began to realise that
there are at least three sides to everybody. The best, the worst,
and that serviceable mixture of both, the everyday. In striving
to rouse the best had she stirred up the worst? Even last
Saturday she had been vaguely uneasy.</p>

<p>Barbara trembled as she stared out of the 'bus window. Did she
love Vardon? She was not sure. Not at this moment. A little while
ago, talking to her grandfather of his peril, in the room with
him, seeing his worn face, an overwhelming rush of feeling, such
as she had never dreamt of, had swept her away, in spite of
herself as it were. But now? Now that she could lose sight of his
danger, her thoughts swung around to herself. Had she been quite
honest on Saturday with her talk of money as the test of
character? She sat thinking awhile. Barbara had a shrewd inner
vision. There was good stuff in her. Her mother wanted her to
marry Edgar Spiers. Edgar was well off. She had thought that she
wanted to follow her heart, and marry Vardon, provided she could
wake him up to work harder. What she had really wanted, she saw
it now, was to marry both a man with money, and the man
she&mdash;if not loved&mdash;was attracted to. It was not him
whom she had tried to help, but herself. Yes, herself. She wanted
to marry him, and at the same time marry well. She did not spare
her feelings. And what was the result of her efforts? With cold
terror she realised that Philip Vardon, who, if left to himself
would never have hurt a fellow creature, would possibly,
probably, be shortly accused of murder. Accused of it. Could he
be guilty? She did not think so. But in this sudden white honesty
that flamed through her, she knew that whatever she might appear
before man, before God she felt a doubt. A doubt which would
prevent her marrying him. She would fight for him till he got out
from under this awful cloud, but then&mdash;she would have to
take stock of where she stood. All the passionate side of her
nature he touched. All that side, that has to do with self-sacrifice, with pity, he now called towards him. But Barbara knew
she would need more than this. She would not marry Philip until
she was absolutely certain that he was innocent. But no one
should know that.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>

<p class="first">
POINTER too, was making for Kew, also for the home of Sir
Richard Ash, in his quality as one-time partner of Vardon's
cousin.</p>

<p>The house inside showed the unmistakable signs of a large
family, and small means. But the comfortable, untidy, drawing-room struck a pleasanter note than many a prettier one.</p>

<p>It rang of happy hours.</p>

<p>Sir Richard was a small, dapper man, with eyes alert and
bright.</p>

<p>"I suppose your call has to do with my late partner's
unfortunate cousin," he began without preamble, once the
greetings were over and Pointer seated, "Mr. Dorset Steele
telephoned us of his trouble."</p>

<p>The door opened, and Barbara came in. She had just got
back.</p>

<p>She was about to leave the two alone with a murmured word of
apology, when her eyes fell on the stranger's card that Sir
Richard Ash had laid on a table near the door.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she came closer, "are you&mdash;is that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm from New Scotland Yard," Pointer said with a bow. He
thought that she had one of the most taking faces that he had
ever seen. Her eyes, at once fearless and penetrating, rested on
his in a mute question.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Chief Inspector, have you found out yet if it
was&mdash;an accident?"</p>

<p>"My dear!" her father said gently, but she kept her eyes on
the detective officer.</p>

<p>Pointer was moved by that look.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could tell you something&mdash;" she began,
"something about Mr. Vardon. You know, we're engaged?"</p>

<p>"My dear!" her father said again gently.</p>

<p>Pointer looked at her very kindly. Nothing short of absolute
necessity would have made him question her. He, who knew so well
what snares his questions often held! Not willingly would he lay
the burden on her young heart of wondering afterwards if it had
been something that she had said, or failed to say, which had led
her lover to his death. For, it might yet come to that.</p>

<p>"I think I shan't need to trouble you," Pointer said easily,
"but thank you for the offer."</p>

<p>Her father looked relieved. She only watched the more
intently, trying to read what lay behind the words. A little of
the truth she guessed, and went very white.</p>

<p>"There's nothing like routine-work in a case of this kind,"
Pointer assured her. "And perhaps if I might speak to Sir
Richard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alone," chirped Sir Richard in great relief, "my
dear&mdash;the Chief Inspector's time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But daddy, you can't tell him as much as I can."</p>

<p>Pointer saw that there was nothing for it but the truth.</p>

<p>"It's this way. Suppose you wished afterwards you'd put things
differently, mightn't it worry you? I don't think it would be
quite fair to you, just because you and Mr. Vardon are
engaged."</p>

<p>She said no more, and left them. It might seem a dreadful
thing of which to suspect a nice girl, but the Chief Inspector
would have been unwilling to bet on the point, so certain did it
seem to him, that outside, with her ear against the door jamb,
Miss Ash would have been found.</p>

<p>"How long has Miss Ash been engaged?"</p>

<p>Now that was just the question at issue between Barbara and
her parents. Sir Richard always attributed it to the wonderful
intuition of woman that Barbara hugged him quite especially that
night. He replied:</p>

<p>"She tells us that they became engaged about a week ago. They
intended to keep it to themselves till the young man should have
a more assured future."</p>

<p>"You have no objections to the match?"</p>

<p>"Apart from his lack of means, none at all. I like Philip
Vardon. He's been very unfairly treated in the past, to my
thinking, and taken it splendidly."</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"His Cousin Branscombe's will. Philip Vardon should have had
the land left him. Every foot of it was Vardon. It came to Clive
Branscombe through his mother. But he was one of those men whom a
handsome, imperious woman can twist around her little finger. And
Mrs. Tangye, poor soul, was both those things."</p>

<p>"Otherwise a nice woman?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly."</p>

<p>"Ever anything against her? Hint of scandal, or that sort of
thing?"</p>

<p>"Not a breath."</p>

<p>"Did she strike you as a very, how shall I put
it&mdash;lawabiding woman? I mean, do you think she would ever
lend herself to anything illegal in any way?"</p>

<p>Pointer was thinking of blackmail.</p>

<p>"The last woman in the world," Sir Richard assured him with a
smile, and very definitely.</p>

<p>"Or to be mixed up in anything illegal?"</p>

<p>"Or to be mixed up in anything not strictly above-board, and
most respectable. In fact her respectability&mdash;I should
say&mdash;was a shield and buckler nothing could get past."</p>

<p>He tried Ash on another tack, but Sir Richard knew personally
nothing of Mrs. Tangye's cousin, nor of her inner life since she
had married her present husband.</p>

<p>Pointer thanked him and had risen to go. Turning to him again
he said civilly:</p>

<p>"Miss Ash has a bad cold, I see. I'm afraid it's a legacy from
the funeral yesterday."</p>

<p>"No. She's getting over an old one. Though I always say that I
don't know about weddings, but one funeral is sure to make
another. Yet in her case, it seems to've done no harm."</p>

<p>Pointer hoped that the architect's saw would come true in this
case. He certainly intended to do his best to see that Mrs.
Tangye's funeral should be followed by another&mdash;that of her
murderer.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector found Wilmot at the police station,
chatting to Haviland.</p>

<p>"Vardon's alibi is rotten." Haviland spoke cheerfully. "As for
his box-camera he says he sold it to a man he met in the train a
month ago for a fiver. Hard up for an excuse! In fact, he fits
the theory we now have of the murder to a T, sir."</p>

<p>"All but the preparations on Mrs. Tangye's part for his unseen
arrival," Pointer said in his unmoved way. "A most important
'but,' Haviland. Otherwise, I agree that he fits, supposing his
story to be false. For obviously Mrs. Tangye wouldn't have gone
openly to the man's room who, a couple of hours' later, was to
come so secretly to Riverview, in order to hand him a sum of
money she could just as easily have given him at her own
house."</p>

<p>"Hence the yarn, you think?" Haviland asked.</p>

<p>"Possibly. But on the other hand, if Vardon's telling the
truth, and she did go to Fulham, did give him the money to use
for them both, the account he gives of her fits in with what we
know of the rest of Mrs. Tangye's actions last Tuesday. Her rush
would be not to be too late for that most important appointment
in the Riverview morning-room. An appointment for which she had
prepared so well. The distrait manner which Vardon mentions would
be due to it. So on the whole, until we learn of something that
shakes his story, or that would explain why he should be expected
to come by the French windows, and not by the front door, I
accept it."</p>

<p>"What he told you fits in most of all with suicide," Wilmot
reminded him.</p>

<p>Pointer shot him an ironic glance.</p>

<p>"I don't see the Insurance Company's advocate seeing it, if it
didn't."</p>

<p>"Any more than I can see a crime here&mdash;yet," Wilmot said
seriously. "That little point he told you about Mrs. Tangye
picking up her pen with her left hand shows what happened. She
fired that shot too with her left hand. Or she had an accident
while holding it in her left hand. Vardon's no criminal. Apart
from every moral consideration, he hasn't the brains for such a
crime as you're postulating."</p>

<p>And here Pointer rather agreed. Though with reservations.
Criminals have odd pockets of cunning, which even a trained eye
may overlook in a first summing up of their character.</p>

<p>Haviland glanced up from his papers.</p>

<p>"I tried that speech of yours on the tea-room manageress. She
crumpled."</p>

<p>"What rune was this?" Wilmot asked. "Does Pointer go in for
incantations? Pray lend it to me. I'm off to see my tailor."</p>

<p>But Pointer, it seemed, had only told Haviland to ask if it
were true, as Miss Saunders maintained, that she had been wearing
a purple cloak on Tuesday. The manageress had fallen into the
trap, and said that she had been.</p>

<p>"The more I seemed to doubt Miss Saunders having really worn
that cloak&mdash;she hasn't such a thing in her wardrobe, of
course&mdash;the more the woman remembered it. Well, of course,
that does for the alibi. Once a liar always a liar. And that's a
fact. The two women have put their heads together, and concocted
it. That's what happened. As a matter of fact, I don't believe
now that Miss Saunders was either at the tea-rooms or in the
library last Tuesday afternoon between four and six."</p>

<p>Haviland looked half-uneasy at the boldness of his own
thoughts, but Wilmot and Pointer only nodded, as though each had
already reached that point some time ago.</p>

<p>Barbara meanwhile was discussing the man in charge of the case
with her grandfather.</p>

<p>"Looks to be a bit off-colour," Dorset Steele said moodily. He
was sitting with his latest stamp between his fingers. The
solicitor collected.</p>

<p>"Does he?" in tones of horror.</p>

<p>"Don't you think so?" He held out a Sandwich Island gem.
Barbara covered it promptly with the ash tray. A present from
herself, which the solicitor regularly produced during her
visits, and which he as regularly forgot to use.</p>

<p>"I'm speaking of the Chief Inspector from Scotland Yard. He
seems so tied by what he calls routine."</p>

<p>"Huh!" snorted Dorset Steele, almost blowing the stamp off the
table. "Routine, indeed! that's what he called his work in that
Mailing affair last year. Would Mailing have come out with the
truth and ruined our whole defence if Pointer hadn't&mdash;"
Dorset Steele broke off too indignant to continue, though Barbara
heard a muttered "Bottle of ginger-beer indeed! Our best
witness!" Snatching up a lens, the solicitor examined a purchase
viciously.</p>

<p>"He's a good man," he admitted finally, grudgingly. "His
evidence always carries tremendous weight with any judge and
jury."</p>

<p>"I'm going to go to the hotel in the city where Phil went, and
I'm going to hunt there for that bag of his," Barbara said
suddenly. "Of course it's there. He says he saw it taken in by
one of the lift-boys. I'm sure I can find it. He pretends now
that he doesn't want me to bother. That it's not worth finding,
but that's only to save me worrying."</p>

<p>Dorset Steele was sure she could not find it. Pointer had
telephoned to him only a little while ago, that two of Scotland
Yard's men had failed to trace it. He knew, though Pointer had
rung off, that the Yard were searching taxis and left-luggage
places. But he thought any diversion good for Barbara.</p>

<p>"I never heard of a madder idea!" he said crossly, and Barbara
only smiled. She sped down to the hotel. To the booking-clerk, a
pretty girl with a sympathetic eye, she explained that she was
Vardon's fiancee and, as he couldn't come for the bag himself,
she wanted to make quite sure that it hadn't been overlooked in
some odd corner. It contained some important papers.</p>

<p>The girl was friendly. But though she summoned porters and
lift-boys, the bag was denied by all and sundry as resolutely as
a pain by a Christian Scientist.</p>

<p>Barbara halted disconsolately in the lounge, loath to go. The
feeling that though right, she was impotent, that something more
should be done, but she did not know what, made her desperate. So
much hung on the bag. Had it been stolen? Had some honest
mischance happened to it?</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Ash," said a voice she had heard for the
first time yesterday. A voice that sounded wonderfully pleasant
just now. It suggested resource. It suggested power. She shook
hands with the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>"Come about the bag? Not found it yet, I see. What do you say
to some tea and toast while I carry on?"</p>

<p>He piloted her into the coffee-room. It was a cold day and a
chilly room but his mere presence was comforting. He was so
thoroughly on his own ground. Mentally, if not actually.</p>

<p>Barbara handed over the reins gladly.</p>

<p>Pointer started in with asking for the lift-boy, who by this
time considered himself the hotel's most interesting inmate. The
lad told his side of the story fluently enough.</p>

<p>"There was a lot of luggage come in. Party of Americans
arrived. I took it all up in the service lift, and then carried
it down, storey by storey. The hall porter had seen to its being
chalked with the numbers of the rooms. The gentleman never had a
bag with him at all. That's flat."</p>

<p>"Did you take any more luggage up afterwards?"</p>

<p>"No. It was my last trip."</p>

<p>Pointer went up in the lift. He was shown over the hotel
willingly enough. The management wanted the thing settled.
Pointer represented himself as coming on behalf of the luggage
insurance company from whom Vardon was claiming the value of the
bag.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be seen that even distantly resembled the
article in question. The lift-boy who had taken over after the
first one went off duty was next summoned. His answer to
Pointer's question, as to what he would do if he found any
overlooked luggage left on the top floor landing, was that he
would bring it down.</p>

<p>"I'd place it in the lift, like I always do if it's there, and
either come down with it if I'd the time, or the night porter 'd
haul it down when the lift was next wanted. Either way, nothing
couldn't get lost. You can't lose luggage in this hotel, sir, not
if you tried!"</p>

<p>"There's no light by the lift on the top floor."</p>

<p>"The lamp in the corridor is enough. You don't need light to
get in or take out luggage. All you want is to see the number on
'em. And the corridor lamp is good enough for that."</p>

<p>Pointer nodded. He had done with the boy. He now asked for the
lift's mechanician, and a ladder. Together the two mounted on top
of the cage. The workman flashed a repairer's lamp around. There,
hidden from view by a deep ornamental border, lay a brown kit-bag, marked P. V.</p>

<p>"That's what I'm after!" Pointer picked it up, and gave a
receipt&mdash;on a luggage insurance company's paper&mdash;to the
hall porter.</p>

<p>What had happened must have been that the first boy left the
bag on the top landing by an oversight. The second boy, seeing
the number of a room on a lower floor chalked on it, had heaved
it into the lift as he thought, but on to the lift as it turned
out, which had already been sent down. The dim light, and dark
shaft had at once suggested this to Pointer. No man but an
absolutely fearless one rises high, either at Scotland Yard, or
in the Force. Yet Pointer held his very breath as he tiptoed past
the coffee-room door, at which Barbara was casting constant
glances.</p>

<p>His footsteps would not have disturbed a tigress with a
wounded cub. But Barbara heard them. She darted out into the hall
just as he was arranging a message to be delivered to her
later&mdash;much later.</p>

<p>"You've got the bag? Phil's bag? Oh, well done."</p>

<p>Pointer made the best of what he considered a very bad job,
and let her accompany him back to his car. Nothing but actual
violence would have torn her from his find. He span out the tale
of his discovery to the utmost as they drove along.</p>

<p>"You're taking it to Mr. Vardon, of course?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" Pointer echoed loftily as though nothing in the
world could ever induce him to trifle with, or detain, another's
property. "But I think we'll just call in and tell Mr. Dorset
Steele its found. He's on our way."</p>

<p>"I want to be there when it's opened." Barbara's fine little
nostrils were quivering like a filly's with eagerness.</p>

<p>Pointer was very official.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid this kind of thing&mdash;routine work&mdash;must
be done as routine," he said stiffly. "I think you can trust Mr.
Dorset Steele to state the case accurately to you
afterwards."</p>

<p>Barbara seemed duly crushed as he had hoped.</p>

<p>"Where would you like me to put you down?" he asked as they
came in sight of the solicitor's office.</p>

<p>"My bank is quite close," she suggested pleasantly. It was
next door. Pointer glanced sharply at her, but Barbara was
counting some change in her purse with the look of incredulous
and pained surprise which that operation generally calls forth on
a woman's face. Her whole air was business-like. Absorbed.</p>

<p>She shook hands with him and tripped into the lobby. To run
swiftly through a passage, out the other side, up a back stair
and into the office of Dorset Steele. She tried the knob of his
private office. It was locked.</p>

<p>"No one can come in!" snapped Dorset Steele's voice. "It's me,
grandfather," she said meekly. He made no reply.</p>

<p>The head clerk who had witnessed her mad swoop upon the inner
room, proffered a paper. Barbara wrapt herself in it haughtily,
blinking to keep back the tears.</p>

<p>"Phil's bag! I know they're opening it without waiting for
him!" So, she was not to be there. To see his vindication. She
wanted to read that piece of paper more than any of them could.
It would be balm to her quivering, doubt-tormented spirit.</p>

<p>The door was finally unbolted. Barbara was in like a wind-driven bird.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked, "well?" For there stood the bag in the
centre of the table. "Have you opened it? Without Philip?"</p>

<p>"A pretty state of things!" fumed Dorset Steele, putting an
arm around her. "My private door practically forced open
like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you find it?" she asked in quivering suspense.</p>

<p>"A paper signed Mable Tangye giving Mr. Vardon the money to
invest for her, is here all right, Miss Ash," Pointer reassured
her.</p>

<p>"Then, what's wrong?" she asked her grandfather, looking
searchingly into his face, "what's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" he snapped, dropping his arm, and turning away.</p>

<p>Barbara's gaze grew more agonised.</p>

<p>"I think you'd better explain, sir," Pointer said quietly. He
opened the bag again; he lifted out an envelope.</p>

<p>"There's the paper giving him the use of the money. But would
you say that was written by Mrs. Tangye?" he asked Barbara
reluctantly.</p>

<p>Barbara stared at it. Her eyes blurred.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know her writing well enough to say."</p>

<p>"It's not like any specimens which Mr. Dorset Steele and I
have," Pointer explained. "And it's written with Mr. Vardon's
stylograph. And on his paper. The last is natural of course. So
is the pen, perhaps, but that writing?" He eyed it very hard.</p>

<p>"I know you'll take his word&mdash;" she began. It was a silly
sentence. But she was speaking as much to her own heart as to
Pointer. She turned to him, confident of being met half-way. Then
she stared. He had altered. She had thought his eyes kind; they
were steel. For the first time Barbara sensed that the man beside
her was by nature a close-in fighter. The cut of his nostrils,
the set of his lips, the very bone formation of his good-looking
face, would have told a skilled observer as much at a glance. But
for the first time in her knowledge of him, the invincible,
fiery, essence of the spirit was flaming through the calm
exterior of the man.</p>

<p>Instinct told her that nothing would move the Chief Inspector
to alter the course which he thought the true one, by the breadth
of an atom. She was right, nothing would.</p>

<p>He seemed to her suddenly very awful. Very terrible. She would
not be the first who had had cause to think him so.</p>

<p>She looked dumbly at her grandfather.</p>

<p>"The Chief Inspector believes it's a forgery," he said
curtly.</p>

<p>Pointer did not go as far as that, he only considered a
forgery as possible.</p>

<p>Barbara sat down. She felt faint. What was this law that never
seemed satisfied? She thought of the gulls that she had fed only
this morning on the Embankment. Their stretched necks and greedy
eyes intent on more, always more. Cruel and insatiable by some
law of their very being. Remorseless.</p>

<p>"Philip's clever with his pen," she said swiftly, "if he had
wanted to copy Mrs. Tangye's writing, he'd have done it better
than that."</p>

<p>Her grandfather's eyes stopped her. Dorset Steele looked as
though he were going to bite.</p>

<p>"We maintain that it was written with Mrs. Tangye's left hand,
and as such would naturally show great differences," the
solicitor said at once.</p>

<p>"Leaving that on one side for the moment. As we three are
together, and since Mr. Vardon hasn't got here yet&mdash;we
telephoned to him to come on," Pointer explained to
Barbara&mdash;"there's another point I'd like to ask you about,
Miss Ash."</p>

<p>"You don't need to answer, mind!" Dorset Steele threw in. "A
man came to Twickenham police station this morning. To see the
Superintendent. He spends his free afternoons going over the
fields close to Richmond golf links with his dog picking lost
balls. It seems he heard you and Mr. Vardon together last
Saturday afternoon. He was out of sight, he says, behind a
thicket at the time. According to him, Mr. Vardon was speaking as
though he hadn't any certainty that you would marry him. Yet you
told us that you had become engaged some days before then."</p>

<p>Pointer stopped Barbara with a gesture as cautionary as her
grandfather's might have been.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to answer without thinking very carefully
over your reply. According to this man, Mr. Vardon spoke
unwillingly of a screw that he could turn&mdash;if need be-which
would let him make a good deal of money. According to this man,
you called over your shoulder as you moved away, out of earshot,
that if so, he had better turn it, and turn it hard. Now, if you
care to explain this conversation when you've thought over your
answers&mdash;they are very important, Miss Ash&mdash;I would
like to hear what you have to say. You're not bound in any way to
reply, as Mr. Dorset Steele, here says, but if you should care to
clear the points up&mdash;that about the date of your engagement,
as to whether Mr. Vardon did make any such remark, and you such a
rejoinder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The man misunderstood the whole thing," Barbara said quickly.
"Mr. Vardon and I had&mdash;well&mdash;had a quarrel. I was in a
horrid temper. Things had been rubbing it in to me what marrying
a poor man meant&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lady Ash would not have cared to hear herself alluded to as
"things."</p>

<p>"Philip has the sweetest, kindest temper in the world. I was a
perfect little beast to him. Oh, a perfect toad. Simply too
loathsome for words. I goaded him into saying those words. Of
course, he didn't mean anything. And, of course, I knew he didn't
mean anything!"</p>

<p>"The man heard incorrectly. No such words in fact, were
spoken," interrupted Dorset Steele in such stentorian tones that
his clerk in the next room jumped. "Will you hold your tongue,
Barbara!"</p>

<p>Barbara shook her head.</p>

<p>"If this story is going about, it had better be faced. It's
just luck that the only time such a phrase was ever used, was
when there was an eavesdroppr. It was Banks, wasn't it?" she
asked. "Father of Bobby Banks, whom we had to discharge. He was
one of the caddies." Barbara was honorary secretary of the golf
club run by the G.F.S.</p>

<p>"Exactly. The man had a grudge, and magnified some trifle,"
Dorset Steele nodded energetically.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vardon refused to see me this morning," Pointer said
after a pause.</p>

<p>"On my instructions," snapped the solicitor.</p>

<p>"Pity. He might be able to straighten this little tangle out
by one word."</p>

<p>"My experience is that one word only ties tangles tighter." In
his irritation Dorset Steele' was getting as alliterative as a
Skald.</p>

<p>"You still think it's safer not to let him talk to me?"
Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Safer? You mean wiser. Certainly. Look at this whole
conversation&mdash;" the solicitor evidently considered it a
sorry sight. "The case is going to the dogs."</p>

<p>Pointer, without glancing at Barbara, rose.</p>

<p>"If you'll excuse me, I'll smoke a pipe outside."</p>

<p>He thought that the girl needed a respite.</p>

<p>In silence Barbara stretched a hand up to her grandfather's
shoulder and side by side the two stood looking into the
fire.</p>

<p>She saw a dark enough picture. He saw a worse one still.</p>

<p>"Did I&mdash;did I bungle things?" she asked at last, under
her breath. "The truth seemed best."</p>

<p>"Truth!" the solicitor snorted. "This conversation on the
links&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If only it hadn't happened," she said sadly.</p>

<p>"If only it hadn't been overheard, it could have been kept
from the jury!" he muttered. "Well, when you see your Philip
next, try to din a few elementary facts into his head. Truth is
what it's best for the other side to believe," he repeated
forcefully.</p>

<p>"You'll never din that into his head. Nor into mine either,
I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Pointer came in again. He still had the bag with him. Now he
placed it on a table behind the door.</p>

<p>"Nothing is to be said about that, until the door is closed."
He took up a place at the window, Steps were heard outside.
Coming up the stairs. They were on the first floor. Suddenly
there came a little halt in them. A sort of catch. Then they went
on again. The door opened. Vardon came in. He looked older,
leaner. Barbara felt with a sudden pang that she would give all
that she possessed to see again that sunny, all's-well-with-the-world look on his face. She watched him with misty eyes. Had she
turned an innocent man into a criminal? Was it possible that she
had egged him on, talked him on, nagged him on to&mdash;She hated
herself for the terrible doubt but it was there. Not of the man
as he would have been had she let him alone, but of the man whose
nerves she might have worn down with her constant reproachings,
exhortations for many months now. Had he&mdash;the
stranger&mdash;done this thing?</p>

<p>Vardon's eyebrows lifted as he shook hands with the two of
them.</p>

<p>"We've found the bag that went astray," Pointer said
cheerfully. "Just look through it, and see if everything's there.
It's unlocked, as you said."</p>

<p>Vardon started. He looked swiftly, not at the bag, but first
at Pointer and then at the solicitor. The bag came third. Then he
opened it, and bent over the things inside. Pointer had put the
paper nearly on top.</p>

<p>"Ah, here it is! Now, you see!" Vardon drew it out. But the
paper had been under his fingers for fully a second. True, he
looked as though a load had fallen from him, but he also looked a
little bewildered. Pointer thought that he looked as though not
quite able to believe his own luck.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector took the sheet and asked if he identified
it as the one that Mrs. Tangye had written in his rooms. If so,
the Scotland Yard man would take it with him, giving Dorset
Steele a receipt for it. The solicitor initialled it. He had
every confidence in Pointer but he took nothing on trust. Like
Pointer himself.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vardon, what screw did you have that you could turn to
order to get money?" Pointer asked as the paper changed hands
finally.</p>

<p>Vardon's face darkened. He looked narrowly at the two men. He
did not glance towards Barbara.</p>

<p>"Just a silly phrase," he said earnestly. "Just a silly, empty
phrase."</p>

<p>And to this explanation he stuck. Barbara said nothing. She
sat wrapt in suffering. Had Philip only meant that? His face came
back to her. Lowering. Tainted by their talk&mdash;her
talk&mdash;of money as the only goal. She felt certain that he
had meant something more.</p>

<p>Pointer left the three to a dreary silence, and drove off.</p>

<p><br> <br> "So he really had a real bag and a real paper from
Mrs. Tangye," Wilmot murmured when he dropped in at the Yard in
answer to a telephone message from Pointer.</p>

<p>"And the latter fact interested him far less than his
uncertainty as to whether something else was, or was not in the
bag."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was acting?"</p>

<p>"He was far too absorbed in finding out what was in the
bag&mdash;and what was not. So am I therefore."</p>

<p>"Pretty wide field." Wilmot gave his little smile, "I mean,
what might have been in the bag, and wasn't."</p>

<p>"Pretty wide, but not illimitable."</p>

<p>"Well, of course, as a matter of fact, it would have to be
something the bag would contain." Haviland had managed to make
time to be present at the interview too.</p>

<p>Wilmot at once agreed that that would shut out certain
articles.</p>

<p>"And I can see the objections to it being a live animal, or a
gas, or a liquid," the newspaper man went on suavely. "But even
so, the field seems pretty wide for guesswork. Pray, how do you
start, Pointer?"</p>

<p>"Something like this: Vardon expected to find something in
that bag that wasn't there. He did not look in the least worried,
or regretful at its absence, and was on the whole, thankful not
to find it.</p>

<p>"So, evidently it was something that would have made his
position worse. That is to say, that would have thrown a deeper
suspicion on him.</p>

<p>"While his fingers actually passed by the sheet of paper we
all wanted to see, the one he claims Mrs. Tangye wrote when she
gave him the money, they kept searching the pockets in the bag's
lining. Pockets that would only admit of papers. He stared first
and hardest at a long envelope-which proved to contain his
cheque-book. He pulled it half out while he thought we were all
busy with the paper. As soon as he had a clear view of its top,
he thrust it back. The address was away from him. It was an
unopened envelope evidently, but of the same long, narrow shape,
that's the danger. He eyed the remaining papers and books but he
didn't take any up."</p>

<p>"Securities?" asked Wilmot, "do you think he is missing
anything of that kind?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it's money. Vardon didn't look as he would have
done if anything on which he had counted were missing, let alone
anything for the sake of which he might be supposed to've
committed a crime. And the oddest thing is he didn't know whether
it was there or not. It's not a case of something missing in the
ordinary sense. There aren't many things which would fit the
facts. He doesn't seem to be nervy of it turning up anywhere
else, whatever 'it' is. At least, he has made no efforts to go
back on his tracks in any way."</p>

<p>"That's his cunning!" came from Haviland.</p>

<p>Pointer rose. His minutes were valuable.</p>

<p>He himself was off to Vardon's late lodgings in Fulham. An
Inspector of his had been there and found nothing. Watts could be
trusted, yet Pointer felt that something had escaped his eye, as
it must have Haviland's. But he came down to the ground floor in
the draughty house with nothing scored. The rooms, still empty,
were detective proof.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vardon can't come himself," he explained to the frowsy
manageress, who seemed to think that a pearl necklace, which
would have staggered a Romanoff, went particularly well with a
woollen pullover. "But he's afraid he's left something behind. I
couldn't quite make out what, over the telephone. Something about
a paper..."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not here. He's lost it somewhere else. Mislaid it like as
not. He reely was too rushed to notice what he was doing last
Tuesday."</p>

<p>"Yes, he took all his luggage with him," she went on in answer
to a question of the Chief Inspector's. "A new cabin trunk; old
trunk for the hold, a suit case and a bag."</p>

<p>That was the tally. Pointer tried again.</p>

<p>"Still he misses something, and thinks it was left here. I
couldn't make out over the 'phone just what as I say. How about
an overcoat, or a hat, or a cane even, left in the hall
stand?"</p>

<p>She made a motion with her hand and ran down to a semi-basement, negotiating the holes in the carpet with the skill of a
pilot among familiar buoys. A moment later she called up:</p>

<p>"Here's his top-coat. His old one. He was wearing a new one
when he left. He must have forgotten this. It's his, all right. I
mended those pockets for him once myself." Pointer laid it over
his arm and thanked her. Then he stayed on chatting. He learnt
nothing about the artist from the woman. Vardon's had been a
quiet, unobtrusive figure in the house, liked, but hardly
noticed.</p>

<p>He switched the talk to Mrs. Tangye's accidental death. The
manageress remembered reading the case in the papers. She had had
no idea that her late lodger knew the lady.</p>

<p>"He more than knew her. He was a relation. There's a regular
family row raging just now because he says he wasn't told of her
death till he saw it in the papers. The family say that one of
'em came here that same evening&mdash;last Tuesday&mdash;and left
a message for him."</p>

<p>Pointer wanted to find out whether the keys found in Vardon's
luggage might have been left on his table, as he alleged, though
not necessarily by Mrs. Tangye. Florence was still as certain as
ever that she had noticed them on the desk at Riverview at
four&mdash;after Mrs. Tangye's last outing.</p>

<p>"I didn't hear of any message. But, of course, in a house like
this..."</p>

<p>"Under a management like this," Pointer amended mentally.</p>

<p>"Still, if any one at all called last Tuesday evening, it
would likely have been about the death. I expect it was a lady,"
he hazarded.</p>

<p>"A lady did call here last Tuesday for Vardon"&mdash;a young
man lounged in for some change for the telephone. "She waited in
a car outside for him. As I came up the steps she bent forward
and asked me, if by chance, I knew whether Mr. Vardon were in. I
glanced up at his windows, saw a light, and told her he was. She
sat back with a grunt&mdash;but without a thankee."</p>

<p>"Pretty woman? Young? Fair-haired?"</p>

<p>"Look here! I'm off!" the stranger backed out laughing. "No,
no! It's all right. She's a rising cinema star. Is she as pretty
as they say?"</p>

<p>"If she's a star, she belongs to the Milky Way. The face I had
a glimpse of wasn't one to fill the stalls."</p>

<p>"About twenty?" persisted Pointer.</p>

<p>"Times two!"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector looked disappointed.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean his cousin! Thin, hatched-faced type, with small
dark eyes?" Pointer went on to describe Miss Saunders very
accurately though apparently casually.</p>

<p>"That's her!"</p>

<p>"Well, of course then he's right. And he wasn't told.
She&mdash;his cousin;&mdash;wouldn't know either. Not at that
hour. I take it it was about eight?"</p>

<p>"About."</p>

<p>"I wonder she waited for him. I wouldn't. Vardon's such a
careless chap. I dare say she had to sit on for another
hour."</p>

<p>"No. I heard him come running down only a few minutes later
and the car buzz off. My rooms are below his."</p>

<p>"I'll bet he was still wrestling with his tie as they drove
away," laughed Pointer. But the other had not looked out of his
window.</p>

<p>The manageress knew nothing more. No one in the house knew
more. Pointer shook the patently expectant hand, raised his hat,
pressed the starter, and let in the clutch in one co-ordinated
action. There was a paper in the inner pocket of the coat. It
felt like a letter.</p>

<p>In a quiet square he examined his find. It was a long,
official-looking envelope addressed to, "The Registrar of Wills,
Somerset House, London."</p>

<p>With his penkife he raised the flap which was stuck down but
not sealed. He drew out a will. By it Mable Tangye left
everything of which she should die possessed, to Philip Vardon,
cousin of the late Clive Branscombe, and appointed him sole
executor.</p>

<p>The will was on a form obtainable at any stationer's. Below
the printed matter was written in Mable Tangye's writing, but a
singularly uneven writing&mdash;that she requested Philip Vardon,
if possible, not to withdraw the ten thousand pounds invested in
Harold Tangye's firm for at least two years, unless the
stockbroker had pre-deceased him.</p>

<p>Pointer tapped the paper thoughtfully.</p>

<p>It was witnessed by one, Edmund Stone, stationer, of 10 River
Road, Twickenham, and Robert Murray, assistant, at the same
address.</p>

<p>The date was last Monday. Monday! The day before the one on
which Mrs. Tangye had a fatal accident, said the coroner.
Committed suicide, said Tangye and Wilmot. Been murdered, said
Pointer.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector replaced the envelope, and sat on, staring
at his patent tips that winked back at him as though they could
tell him a great joke if they would. But what Pointer already
knew was sufficient to keep his thoughts occupied.</p>

<p>No wonder the artist was nervous lest this paper should fall
into the hands of the police. Here was motive, and motive
sufficient some might say. Vardon, the sole legatee&mdash;fitted
every step of the way now, if his story of Mrs. Tangye's visit
were false&mdash;except the entrance by the French windows.</p>

<p>There, like some cabalistic Sign of Protection, stood the big
question mark, raised by Pointer's own theory of the crime.</p>

<p>So long as he could not be linked with that, so long as no
reason showed itself why Mrs. Tangye should have arranged for him
to come secretly, Vardon could not be considered more suspect
than Miss Saunders, nor than Tangye, supposing the husband to
have used another man as his tool.</p>

<p>It was possible, quite possible, that Haviland was right, that
Mrs. Tangye had been preparing to go to Patagonia with Philip
Vardon, but if so, if Vardon were the criminal, then some strange
reason lay behind the murder which had not been even guessed at
yet. Of that the Chief Inspector felt assured. Before arresting
the artist, Pointer intended to be absolutely certain of his
guilt. The odds were too enormously against Vardon to permit of
any other course. Here was no case of a man refusing to explain.
Whether true ones, or false ones, he had a reply to every
question.</p>

<p>Pointer gave his head an impatient shake. He wanted something
that could connect up with those footsteps heard in the garden,
walking stealthily behind Mrs. Tangye, stopped by, fearful of,
the light.</p>

<p>Those footsteps still belonged to no one. Disembodied, Pointer
heard them day and night. Whose were they? Vardon's? The
husband's? Oliver Headly's? Or those of some still unknown,
unsuspected person, some tremendously important person in Mrs.
Tangye's life? They might still be anybody's. They still lay in
the no-man's land between all the events.</p>

<p>Pointer's thoughts turned back to the will itself. The
absolute deletion of her husband's name as a beneficiary, and yet
the request at the foot about not withdrawing the money from his
firm immediately. That little note was stranger than the will
itself, Pointer thought. Supposing the latter to be genuine. He
could imagine a woman leaving her fortune away from a husband
with whom she had cause to be angry, with whom she was about to
have a furious quarrel, but in that case, why the apparent
unwillingness to inconvenience him unduly? That did not look like
blind rage.</p>

<p>A new thought stirred in the great detective's mind. He put it
on one side for the moment, and concentrated on Vardon, and
Vardon's rooms last Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>What of him and Miss Saunders? Supposing that the evidence
Pointer had just gleaned had been accurate, she had been at
Fulham about eight last Tuesday evening. In other words, as soon
as she could get there after the police had left Riverview. She
had apparently not gone upstairs, but some one had run down and
driven off with her.</p>

<p>Pointer called in his thoughts, which were racing too far away
on a breast-high scent, and turned his car towards the
stationer's, where the will form had been possibly bought, where
at all events, it appeared to have been witnessed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>

<p class="first">
POINTER stopped his car at the stationer's in Victoria Road.
He produced his official card. Mr. Stone showed him into a little
back parlour with outward calm and some inward trepidation.</p>

<p>He was thinking of sundry half-crowns on "certs" that came and
went&mdash;chiefly went, on most days of the racing year. But
Pointer was affability itself. Did Stone remember any one calling
at his shop last Monday, and buying a will-form?</p>

<p>Stone heaved a sigh of relief. He remembered the lady
perfectly. Mrs. Tangye it was, "as shot herself by accident the
day afterwards." She had come in to ask where the nearest agent
for Carter Patterson's could be found. He had pointed out the
shop further down.</p>

<p>Looking around her, with the patently amiable intention of
buying something, she had picked up a will-form from a pile by
the door.</p>

<p>"Will-forms!..." The idea had seemed to go home. She had read
the printed paper through, and stood a moment, as though
thinking. Stone had been called to another part of the shop to
help his assistant hold his own in a wordy dispute about some
weekly payment, and forgot the lady. The argument was a long one,
necessitating much searching of ledgers. When it was over, he saw
the lady seated on a chair writing on the bottom of one of the
forms. She covered what she had written with a sheet of blotting-paper and asked him and his assistant, now alone in the shop, to
witness her signature, saying that what she was signing was her
last will and testament. They witnessed for her, and received
what Mr. Stone considered a very handsome payment for the
trouble. He saw her slip the will into an envelope which she
bought from him, and, after a moment's hesitation, address it to
the Registrar of Wills, Somerset House, before folding it up
unfastened, and putting it into her hand-bag.</p>

<p>His identification of the lady as Mrs. Tangye was fairly
satisfactory. He had only seen her in a dusky shop, in her hat,
but he remembered her name perfectly. He had remembered it when
he read of her death in the paper.</p>

<p>"Some people say it's all nonsense about being bad luck to
make your will. I dunno. My brother made his will and died the
same year. And look at this case! Still of course if you mess
about with loaded firearms&mdash;will or no will&mdash;you're
likely to end up sudden."</p>

<p>Pointer saw that the man was under the honest impression, as
was his assistant, that it was this will which had been referred
to at the inquest. The Chief Inspector drove on his way again
with another little brick added to his pile.</p>

<p><br> <br> "'Unless Charles Tangye should pre-decease Philip
Vardon,'" Wilmot read aloud again. "M-m."</p>

<p>"Just so," Pointer agreed, "not so much look of suicide about
that proviso as there might be, eh?"</p>

<p>Wilmot re-fixed his eye-glass.</p>

<p>"Why so? My Company claims that Mrs. Tangye was staging an
accident effect. This was part of the pasteboard scenery. To make
a will, and then shoot herself, would look a bit obvious. That
proviso is merely a stage-direction. Nothing more. And there's
another thing," Wilmot went on in a thoughtful tone, "this paper
knocks your idea of a romantic visitor on the head. Where's any
mention in it of the chap with whom you thought she was about to
decamp? Of the 'footsteps that stopped,' in other words?"</p>

<p>"Why, he's the only one mentioned!" Haviland struck in,
"Vardon, in fact. He's deluded her into leaving him all her
money, and he gets rid of her before she can spoil his plan of
marrying Miss Ash."</p>

<p>Wilmot had to allow that this was possible.</p>

<p>"I wonder where Tangye comes into this." Wilmot screwed up his
eyes, thinking hard. "If a crime, <i>if,</i> mark you both! mark
you both! I have a strong inward feeling that in some way he and
that woman&mdash;" he broke off and finished his cigarette in
silence. "I should think this will may be a blow to him," he
began again. "Cheale writes me that Tangye's hard hit by the
Irish failure. That there were large commitments left on his
hands."</p>

<p>"Tangye&mdash;Vardon. Vardon&mdash;Tangye," Haviland murmured.
"And just a bit of Oliver Headly thrown in. They sort of swing to
and fro. And Miss Saunders now with one, now with the other."
Haviland had been puffing finger-print powder over the will. He
shook it off, and then compared the result with his photographs
of prints belonging to the "circle."</p>

<p>"Lot's of men's prints. Vague ones we haven't got. Shop
fingers, I take it. Several smallish ones in gloves. Mrs.
Tangye's, in fact. But here are Vardon's clear enough. Here at
the corners. Though you found the flap of the envelope gummed
down, he must have opened it and read it through before he shut
it up again."</p>

<p>"Do you still go by finger-prints?" Wilmot spoke as though to
a user of bows and arrows, but Haviland refused to be drawn. He
knew the most modern suspicion of that form of proof, but he
himself swore by it.</p>

<p>"Obviously Vardon knew the contents of the will or he wouldn't
have worried about it's possibly being in his bag," Pointer spoke
a little dryly. "If Mrs. Tangye had left her money to the
hospitals, Vardon would have told us of it, you may be sure."</p>

<p>Pointer's constable-clerk brought in a set of papers, and his
two visitors left. They had been talking in his room at the Yard.
In the plainly furnished but airy inner den where the Chief
Inspector worked alone with his many knee-hole tables. One to
every case, in which he was concerned. The reports brought him
were from Hyam, and they helped to fill in a few more of the
blanks still vacant in the puzzle.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, as soon as the banks in Manchester
opened, those notes to the value of fifteen hundred pounds which
Tangye said were safe, that half the Clerkhill farm price in
other words, in which Pointer was most keenly
interested&mdash;had among others, been handed in by a clerk from
William Merchant and Son, Cotton brokers. The men who were most
concerned in the great cotton boom now sky-rocketing. Tangye's
hosts during at least part of his last week-end.</p>

<p>The notes could obviously not have been posted later than
Tuesday night from town to reach Manchester by Wednesday morning.
Pointer thought it even possible that Tangye had sent them off by
the six-thirty collection.</p>

<p>Certain it was that Haviland had not found any of them in the
morning-room, nor in the open safe on his arrival at Riverview
ten minutes past the hour. But they might have been reposing in
some other room, or even in the pockets of either Tangye or Miss
Saunders.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector had thought for some time that Tangye must
have been at his home during the hours of suspicion, or the
woman's hold over him could not have been what Pointer believed
it was, a strangle-hold. He felt sure that she had seen the
stockbroker there between the death of Mrs. Tangye and the
arrival of the police.</p>

<p>Had she caught him red-handed, and helped him to erase any
traces he might have left? Or had the companion only found a dead
woman, drawn her own grim conclusions, and made her bargain with
that knowledge, and the ready money she had found. It was a sum,
which coming just when it did, might have meant salvation to
Tangye, allowing him to carry on his margins until the stock
soared next day.</p>

<p>Tangye's manner, his suppressed fury when he believed that
probably double that sum had been there. His hope that the thief
would be caught while he did not dare to speak clearer as to the
thief's possible identity, all looked to Pointer as though Tangye
had linked Miss Saunders with that loss with a promptness and a
certainty that seemed difficult to understand unless Miss
Saunders had been the provider of the one half, and was therefore
suspected of being the thief of the other half. But if so, what
had she received in exchange? She was not a woman to give up as
much as a bent sixpence without some equivalent. What would she
accept in return? Not money, for she was handing that over. Then,
if not money, what would tempt her? Pointer knew of one thing
that would. A promise of marriage. And, if he knew anything of
Regina Saunders, it would have been a promise in writing. Had
Tangye given her this? It would explain that air of having
secretly, not as yet to be openly shown, the upper hand, the
whip-hand, which had struck all three men interested in the
investigation.</p>

<p>It would explain, too, Tangye's tone, as he had ground out
between his teeth that if Mrs. Tangye had given Vardon the money,
as was claimed, there would be something in writing to show for
it.</p>

<p>Pointer pushed in the little pigeon-hole in his brain where
this new item was now laid, and turned to the task immediately
before him. An interview with Miss Eden, which he thought might
be rather difficult. He had asked for it over the telephone, and
learnt that she was down at her settlement in Bethnal Green.</p>

<p>He found her in a tiny private room looking very tired. "Is
there anything wrong?" she asked. A poor opening move.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tangye now states that his wife committed suicide and
withdraws all claim to the insurance money.</p>

<p>"We have learnt that while at the orchid-show with you, Mrs.
Tangye saw her husband and&mdash;and&mdash;" Pointer looked
mysterious, "jumping to conclusions&mdash;doubtless wrong ones,
she first told him on Monday of her intention to kill herself,
and on Tuesday carried it out."</p>

<p>Pointer might have been a father in an earjy Victorian
drama.</p>

<p>Miss Eden waited.</p>

<p>"No No!" she murmured brokenly, "oh, no!" She covered her face
with her hands. "How could she let it drive her to such a
dreadful act!"</p>

<p>After a second she recovered herself.</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell me, though it's rather late in the day,"
Pointer was very grave, "just what did happen. We know it from
other sources, but I would like to hear your side."</p>

<p>"How could she have let it drive her to do that?" Miss Eden
murmured half to herself. Pointer felt that she had asked herself
that question many times.</p>

<p>"Just what did she see?' he spoke less sternly now.</p>

<p>"It all seems so utterly inadequate," she answered wearily.
"We were walking through the Brazilian Garden they made there,
when suddenly Mrs. Tangye&mdash;" Mary Eden hesitated for her
words, "I've heard of people starting back as though they saw an
abyss opening before them, but I never saw it done before. It
really was as though Mrs. Tangye felt the ground give under her.
She jumped back with a sort of gasp. Her face was as white as
that&mdash;" Mary touched a paper beside her, "I had been looking
somewhere else, but following her eyes I saw&mdash;I just caught
sight of&mdash;well, of Mr. Tangye and some woman's
sleeve&mdash;turning the next corner ahead of us."</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>"That was all. Absolutely all. Of course&mdash;I
know&mdash;Mrs. Tangye had some previous knowledge, and
recognised the sleeve. But why should she have looked like that?
She let me lead her away as though she were in a sort of dream,
but as soon as we sat down she jumped up, and said she wanted to
go back for a moment, would I mind waiting for her? She was only
gone ten minutes at most, if as long. When she joined me again,
she wanted to leave at once. Would I stay on without her? She
thought fresh air might do her good. I insisted on going to the
station with her. Walking up and down the platform, waiting for
the train to come in, she told me about a letter, which had
brought her down to the show. I had not heard of it before, or I
should not have gone with her."</p>

<p>"Can you recall the exact words in which she spoke of the
letter?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>Miss Eden thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"As nearly as I can recollect her words, they were, 'To think
that I only came down because of that woman's silly letter.' Then
she was silent until the train came in."</p>

<p>"Was Mrs. Tangye angry?"</p>

<p>"I think she was too stunned to be angry. She seemed really
quite dazed. I think&mdash;" Miss Eden showed her perplexity in
her face, "I think Mrs. Tangye must have been brooding over her
troubles until she lost her mental balance. What was there in all
this to give such a terrible shock as she had had? I think there
must be more behind, than we shall ever know. Some family
tendency to suicide. Some morbid strain."</p>

<p>"And the letter she wrote you?"</p>

<p>"I kept it." She flushed scarlet. "But I couldn't bear-, when
there was no need&mdash;for you to see that last note of hers.
But now that there's a question of some innocent person being
implicated in quite a wrong idea of Mrs. Tangye's death, you
ought to read it. Here it is." She held it out to him.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mary</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">I know you will be shocked by what I am about
to do. But it is too late to enter into all that leads me to take
the step you will soon learn of. I know your kind heart will not
judge me harshly. I cannot think of yesterday calmly. Suppose I
had not gone! I am taking the only possible way out of the
trouble for <u>all</u> of us. I am not thinking only of myself,
believe me.

<p class="letter">And so, till we meet again dear, dear friend, in some future where all will be understood&mdash;good-bye.

<p class="letter">Your affectionate,

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Mable</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>Pointer handed the letter back to Miss Eden.</p>

<p>"I do not think it will be needed. But please keep it
carefully."</p>

<p>Mary hastened to slip it into a locked drawer as though she
could not bear to look at it. There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Was Mrs. Tangye an impulsive woman?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Very. To me she was always kindness itself. But there's no
use saying she was an easy woman to live with. She wasn't."</p>

<p>"Would she be likely to take a strained view of anything not
in itself wrong?"</p>

<p>Miss Eden looked surprised.</p>

<p>"It's odd your saying that. For Mrs. Tangye was most sensitive
about what she considered deception. If she thought that things
were being kept from her, she could be utterly deaf to reason, or
even justice."</p>

<p>"Was she a frank woman herself?"</p>

<p>Mary Eden considered.</p>

<p>"She was a truthful woman," she said finally. "I don't know
that I should call her a frank woman. She was too reserved for
that."</p>

<p>Pointer asked a number of questions as to the person seen with
Tangye at the flower-show.</p>

<p>Miss Eden could only repeat that she had barely glimpsed the
sleeve of a very smart squirrel coat. Now Miss Saunders had a
squirrel coat. Pointer had noticed her wearing it. Miss Eden went
on to say that she seemed tallish. That, too, fitted the
companion, as well as Mrs. Bligh.</p>

<p>Miss Eden felt quite sure that Tangye had not seen his wife.
He and his companion had turned off at right angles, or rather,
were already turning, when Mrs. Tangye had given her start and
backward step.</p>

<p>Pointer left time for a little pause, then he said:</p>

<p>"You heard from Mr. Tangye, I see, about our visit?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then how did you know that an innocent person was 'implicated
in quite a wrong idea of Mrs. Tangye's death'?" Miss Eden made a
little motion with her hand.</p>

<p>"That slipped out. I heard from Miss Ash about Philip Vardon.
She often works down here. She's here now. And I've something to
tell you about Mr. Vardon&mdash;and Mrs. Tangye"&mdash;she
hesitated, evidently with little liking for the task.</p>

<p>"In a way, it seems like betraying the confidence of the dead.
But she had a very keen sense of justice. I think it would grieve
her now&mdash;where she is&mdash;if I kept silence. I heard what
I'm going to tell you from Mrs. Tangye herself. I haven't spoken
of it to Miss Ash. I thought of writing to Mr. Vardon, but I've
decided that the quickest way, in the interests of justice would
be to tell you.</p>

<p>"The day before Mr. Branscombe died, Mr. Vardon dropped in to
see his cousin. From what followed, Mrs. Branscombe&mdash;as she
was then, of course&mdash;thought that his call had been artfully
planned. I don't see why it wasn't mere chance. She herself was
out, getting a breath of air. She nursed her husband splendidly.
He died of pneumonia, you know. Well, in the night she came in
and found him working away on a new will. A will leaving the
money to her, but the land and houses to Philip Vardon. When she
asked her husband what it meant&mdash;the paper had slipped from
under his pillow&mdash;he told her of Philip's call. Mr.
Branscombe was too ill to be questioned much and towards morning
he grew worse and died.</p>

<p>"Mable imagined a sort of conspiracy between her husband and
his cousin. She thought they were trying to do something behind
her back which should have been done openly. I understand that
she flung the paper into the fire&mdash;it was only a draft, not
even finished&mdash;and wrote Mr. Vardon a letter. It must have
been a terrible one if it was anything like what she told me she
said. I believe Mr. Vardon consulted a solicitor with a view to
taking action. But he decided to do nothing. Mrs. Tangye kept the
story to herself except for telling me, and Philip Vardon has a
very forgiving nature. A very sweet temper. But, though Barbara
doesn't know it, I feel sure that the screw he threatened to
turn&mdash;she told me how important you think that
speech&mdash;was that burnt paper. It <i>was</i> Mr. Branscombe's
intention to alter his will. And in common justice, Mable should
have carried out his wishes.</p>

<p>"Please don't misunderstand her," Mary Eden bent forward
earnestly, "she was anything but a mean woman, but she thought
poor Philip had tried by underhand scheming to trick her husband
when he was too ill to be quite sure what he was doing. Philip
Vardon! Who never had a scheming thought in his life? You can
quite see now why she would give him that money, that fifteen
hundred, can't you, and promise him the remainder of what the
house fetched?"</p>

<p>Wilmot at any rate would be able to, Pointer thought a little
ruefully,</p>

<p>"I quite expected she would have mentioned him in her will,"
Miss Eden went on, "I think she would have done so, if it hadn't
been made at the time of her second marriage. While she still
felt resentful."</p>

<p>"I've heard a rumour that another will's been found, leaving
everything lock, stock, and barrel, to Mr. Vardon."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! That's quite out of the question. She never would
have done that. It wouldn't have been fair to her husband. We
were talking of wills only a little while ago&mdash;two or three
months at most&mdash;and she said that she looked on the money
invested in Mr. Tangye's firm as his absolutely. That she had
told him so when they were married. But that she felt free to do
what she liked with the rest."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector left Mary Eden without telling her that
she had done just as much harm as good to Vardon's case. Some
might say she had given the prosecution a splendid motive;
evidence of resentment or vengeance on Vardon's part.</p>

<p>Pointer imagined that the artist saw it in that light too.
Hence his silence. Though Mrs. Tangye might have made it a
condition of the handing over to him of the money. Might have
accompanied it by some speech such as: "If I give you this, will
you let bygones be bygones?"</p>

<p>Pointer did not drive himself this time. He sat back, lost in
thought. He was trying to keep the whole series of loose facts in
his grasp. Miss Eden's account had disappointed the Chief
Inspector greatly. It had been of no help whatever as far as the
incidents of the orchid-show were concerned. That letter did not
sound like a meeting with Oliver Headly. Even Tangye and Miss
Saunders, or Tangye and Mrs. Bligh could not account for it, he
thought, could not have changed Mrs. Tangye's whole outlook on
life. What had really happened down there? Whom had she seen,
whom met when she had slipped away for those few minutes from her
friend? Pointer felt that there must be far more here than he had
yet learnt. Must be. Was Miss Eden's story true? Was that letter
genuinely written after Mrs. Tangye's return Sunday night? The
envelope was. And the letter matched its writing. Jerky, dashed
off with quivering fingers.</p>

<p>The idea, born in Pointer's mind when he read that will the
will leaving everything to Vardon, and nothing to
Tangye&mdash;was stirring now.</p>

<p>He found, on his return to Scotland Yard, that two cables had
come from Fez with a portrait&mdash;also cabled&mdash;of Olivier,
gun-runner to the Riffs. Pointer had the portrait at once sent
out to Oliver Headly's college at Oxford. No one was able to
definitely recognise in the ragged, gaunt, man with the week's
growth of beard, and the hard lines around his mouth and eyes,
the young man who had had to leave sooner than he had intended.
All agreed that it could very possibly be Oliver Headly after the
sort of life he seemed to have led. Smith, the orchid-hunter, had
also a copy shown him. He, too, could not be sure. He thought it
was a picture of Headly, but he was not certain. It was the best
that Pointer could do on that score, so he put it aside.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tangye might have kept more watch on her cousin's career
than was thought. She might have believed him dead, and have met
him suddenly in the flesh. More, she might well have known that
for some law-breaking exploit of his, his life, or at least, his
liberty, was forfeit if he were recognised. Yes, that might
explain some, but not all the actions of the next days.</p>

<p>His thoughts passed on to Vardon. Hastily his mind ran over
the reports gathered about the artist.</p>

<p>As a boy, at Haileybury he had not been distinguished for
games, nor yet for study, but in that most important field on
which only the English public school sets its proper value, in
character, he was a favourite with men and boys.</p>

<p>"A thoroughly good chap," was the verdict.</p>

<p>At the Royal Academy, where he had studied, the tribute was
necessarily of a vague character, but there, too, he had made an
excellent impression.</p>

<p>Pointer placed no belief in faces. Your really clever
criminal, if not born with an honest expression, cultivates one
with all the ardour of a botanist with a new plant. But he
believed greatly in the early reputation of boy or girl. Then
too, Philip Vardon was an artist. He had chosen that career for
himself. Not stepped into his father's shoes, nor sat in a
relative's seat. Yet neither was his the burning genius that
flames its way through all obstacles. No. Vardon was quite good
at his work, but nothing more. He knew that. He must know that.
Yet he had kept to a life that could only promise mediocrity, and
the pay of mediocrity. Here could be no love of money, one would
think, or he would have chosen differently.</p>

<p>And yet...there was that will, and what it stood for in
Pointer's mind. The tiny idea of growing, feeding, moving to and
fro.</p>

<p>Pointer's thoughts went off to the camera which he believed
had figured in that last act. The expert at the Yard had been
intrigued, too, with those scratches on Mrs. Tangye's Webley.
Pointer and he had coated a similar revolver with wax, and
experimented with it, until scratches had been produced that
tallied very exactly. They had found that only one ordinary
accessible camera was large enough for the purpose, and had the
screw in the right position. This was a box type, of the
<i>Lux</i> stocked by most dealers, but not often sold on account
of its high price.</p>

<p>Pointer had given orders for the necessary checking up of the
sales to be done. By to-morrow he hoped to have a list of past
purchasers. It might or might not help. Fortunately the camera in
question was a comparatively modern make.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2>

<p class="first">
THE Chief Inspector went on to see Vardon again. As he climbed
the stairs to the first floor a very sweet tenor reached him.
Vardon could sing.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector opened skilfully, but Vardon either was,
or professed to be, in ignorance, as to any callers at his flat
last Tuesday evening, or of any object which could have attracted
them during his absence.</p>

<p>True, Pointer learned that about a fortnight ago Tangye had
been met by chance in the street, and had come on up to see a
Patagonian iguana, since presented to the Zoo. But he had stayed
a bare fifteen minutes, and had not been alone in the room.</p>

<p>"Did any one telephone to you last Tuesday close on
eight?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Vardon said, some one had. So, at least, one of the
chambermaids had told him, but, on hearing that he was out, the
voice, a man's voice, had said that another time would do as
well, and had left no message.</p>

<p>That, at any rate, fitted. Tangye, if not an invited guest,
would have wanted to know that Vardon was out, before running up
stairs. Even if the artist's rooms had been locked, the key, as
Pointer himself had found just now, had doubtless hung below his
number on the indicator board, and, in that ill-kept house, any
stray passer-by could have taken it.</p>

<p>And if those keys were not taken by Philip Vardon, if they
really had been left in his rooms unknown to him, then, since
Regina Saunders was below, Pointer believed that the only other
person worried by any mention of them, Tangye&mdash;was connected
with their puzzling re-appearance among the artist's effects.</p>

<p>Pointer, after learning the exact date of Tangye's call at the
rooms, which told him nothing, passed on immediately to another
important point.</p>

<p>"Why did Mrs. Tangye make a will in your favour?" The question
came in exactly the same tones as the preceding ones.</p>

<p>Vardon paled. He said nothing. Pointer repeated the question.
Vardon fingered the Spanish book which he had been reading when
the Chief Inspector had first come to see him. Pointer was wont
to say that as a rule, the less mind a man possessed, the greater
difficuty he had in knowing it, but the Chief Inspector did not
think that that was the trouble here. Vardon, like Tangye when he
had heard of the discovery of the keys, was rather weighing
alternatives, neither of which he liked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said undecidedly.</p>

<p>"Equally unaware of why you didn't mention the fact to
us?"</p>

<p>"Naturally I didn't volunteer information which has no bearing
on the case. Things look black enough, in all conscience, without
my touching 'em up."</p>

<p>"You know," Pointer said after a second, "if you're innocent,
I really think you would do best for yourself to tell us
everything. Short of an actual confession on your part, I don't
see how the case could look worse&mdash;"</p>

<p>Vardon went to his telephone, and tried to reach Dorset
Steele, but the solicitor was out of town.</p>

<p>He came back, and again his foot gave a sort of queer little
jerk as he crossed the carpet.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said finally, "I'll trust to your being
honest. And not trying to trap me into some talk that can be
twisted afterwards. You asked me why Mrs. Tangye made that will.
I told you I don't know, and you've as good as called me a liar.
I don't know, but I can guess. She had evidently, patently, had a
definite rupture with Tangye. Hence the gift of the money, and
the change in her will. She told me, I've forgotten to mention
that, to send the properly drawn-up contract to her bank, not to
Riverview."</p>

<p>Pointer nodded.</p>

<p>"She handed you the will fastened up, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Any one would suppose so. But it wasn't even gummed down.
Just as she was rushing out of the room she picked it up from the
table, where she had laid it on entering, and said, 'Glance this
through and then post it for me, please.' With that she was gone.
I took it for granted it was to do with the money lent me, until
I read it. And that was really why I nearly went in to see her
later in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"That, and to ask her if I mightn't speak, to one particular
friend, of her backing our venture. But the will was most in my
mind. It didn't seem playing the game. There was no reason for
her to swing from one extreme to another." Vardon looked as
though he would have taken back that last sentence if he could;
"That is&mdash;er&mdash;it seemed unfair to Tangye. At any rate,
I decided not to post the will until I had talked the matter over
with her, or written about it to her."</p>

<p>Pointer stared at his boots. Then he looked 'up.</p>

<p>"Was there any question of a silence as to something that had
happened in the past&mdash;implied or not&mdash;on your part, in
return for the loan, or for the will?"</p>

<p>Vardon ran his finger along some of the Castilian'words as
though spelling them out.</p>

<p>"I consider such a question rather an insult," he said
finally, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"It isn't meant in that way." Pointer spoke very earnestly.
"You surely don't wish Mrs. Tangye's murderer to escape
justice?"</p>

<p>"But she wasn't murdered!" Vardon said shortly.</p>

<p>"She was," Pointer was quite frank now. "To the best of my
belief, she was. And a peculiarly cruel, dastardly, murder, too.
Surely you're not against me in my hunt for the criminal?"</p>

<p>Vardon seemed stirred by the ring in the other's voice.</p>

<p>"You're one of the brass-hats at Scotland Yard, they tell me,"
he spoke uneasily, "you chaps take crimes rather for granted.
Crimes and criminals."</p>

<p>"Not in this case. Unless I miss my guess, we've here as
clever a criminal as I've yet encountered. I need every particle
of help that can be given me. If I waste my time over innocent
people the real culprit may get away. Now I
read&mdash;well&mdash;many things into that will. And I ask you
again, was there nothing known to you in her past which Mrs.
Tangye wished kept a secret?"</p>

<p>Vardon hesitated.</p>

<p>Pointer went on, "I never met her alive, but if I know
anything of faces, the last thing Mrs. Tangye would have wanted
would be for her murderer to get off."</p>

<p>"And the last thing I or any one would want. But you must be
mistaken for once, Chief Inspector. You must be! Who would murder
Mrs. Tangye? Tangye has been here&mdash;as you, of course, know.
He tells me there's nothing missing. With the fifteen hundred
pounds loaned me, every farthing's accounted for. Then why on
earth should any one kill her?"</p>

<p>"We have our own ideas on that." At least Pointer was
beginning to have the glimmering of one since reading that will.
"Then at most, Mrs. Tangye only referred to that draft of a will
made by her former husband,&mdash;by Branscombe,&mdash;in his
last night? The draft which she burnt?"</p>

<p>Vardon's look of bewilderment was almost comic.</p>

<p>"How the dickens&mdash;how the dickens did you learn of
that?"</p>

<p>"Routine work. But, frankly, was that the screw you intended
to turn&mdash;on Mrs. Tangye?"</p>

<p>Vardon's face flamed.</p>

<p>"Ghastly expression to've used. But&mdash;well, it was. You
see, my grandmother&mdash;Clive Branscombe's grandmother,
too&mdash;was a Vardon. She used to always say that the land she
had brought the Branscombes was to come back to us Vardons
ultimately. Sir Richard Ash, Branscombe's partner, nearly got my
cousin to make a will to that effect once. But Clive put it
off&mdash;until he tried to draft it again, too late. As you've
learnt in some miraculous way. I thought there was no one alive
now who knew of that incident."</p>

<p>"And didn't she ask you on Tuesday not to speak of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She asked me to forgive and forget what had happened
after Clive's death, and she said something which is rather
terrible. In the light of what happened. 'You'll find it'll all
come right&mdash;and very speedily.'"</p>

<p>That last was one to Wilmot, Pointer thought as he hurried
off. His next interview was with Tangye. He wondered how the
stockbroker would take the news of a later, altered will.</p>

<p>Tangye almost leaped to his feet when Pointer told him briefly
that in the course of some routine work, a will of Mrs. Tangye's
had been found, dated last Tuesday, leaving everything of which
she should die possessed to Vardon.</p>

<p>"Vardon! Impossible!" he said again, as he had said before,
but with a very different intonation. "Preposterous! I shall
fight it! I deny its genuiness. Mrs. Tangye repeatedly told me
that the money invested in the firm was to be mine on her
death."</p>

<p>But the surprise he tried to put into his voice did not carry
conviction to Pointer.</p>

<p>Pointer had only handed him a photographic copy. The
photograph itself had been carefully locked up at Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p>Tangye flung it on the table.</p>

<p>"I don't take back a word of what I said. Truth is truth. My
wife told me she intended to commit suicide. You find her shot,
with the revolver beneath her hand that fired the bullet. No
struggle. No hint of foul play..."</p>

<p>"There are hints of it," Pointer put in quietly, "only hints,
it's true."</p>

<p>"Because I don't think he killed my wife, doesn't mean that I
intend to sit still and see Vardon sweep the board clean. Right's
right. But one man's wrong is no man's right." Tangye was getting
incoherent. "The land yes. If my wife sold a farm, and chose to
let him have the money, that's nothing to me, once I know where
the money was, but it was agreed, when we married, that her ten
thousand&mdash;" he was off again.</p>

<p>Pointer had to interrupt the tenth rendering of the same
motive to take his leave.</p>

<p>He slipped into the morning-room where Miss Saunders was
generally to be found. Just now she was standing looking up at a
large portrait of Mrs. Tangye on the wall. A very recent addition
to the room.</p>

<p>"I had the enlargement done in Bond Street. Rather good, don't
you think?" she asked Pointer. Without waiting for a reply she
went on, "I think her picture should be about the house. I like
to see it."</p>

<p>Anything smugger than her tone could not be imagined. Finally
she took her eyes away with an almost visible effort.</p>

<p>"Has anything fresh turned up, Mr. Chief Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We've found another will of Mrs. Tangye's. Later than
the one read at the inquest. Leaving everything to Mr.
Vardon."</p>

<p>She stared at him a moment in silence. Then, compressing her
lips, she swept the mantelpiece with the edge of her cupped
hand.</p>

<p>"Leaving everything?" she finally asked.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Genuine?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Tangye thinks not."</p>

<p>"But you?" she gave him a piercing look.</p>

<p>"We see no reason to doubt it, so far."</p>

<p>She made no comment. Turning, she left the room, apparently
lost in thought.</p>

<p>Pointer went for a walk in the old Deer Park. It was a sunny
afternoon; the elms and larches showing gold under a cloudless
sky. There was a buoyant pulse in the wind and sun. The air on
his face brought with it smells of frost, of oak leaves, of wet
soil under some southern wall, of a belt of spruce to
windward.</p>

<p>Blue was the sky overhead, blue the wet ruts underfoot,
against the yellow litter of leaves on the ground. Pointer smoked
and meditated. His thoughts on Tangye and Vardon first of
all.</p>

<p>Miss Saunders, judging from her question to the stranger
entering the chambers, had seemed to think that the stockbroker
was having a talk with Vardon, but Tangye and Miss Saunders were
by no means in each other's complete confidence.</p>

<p>But supposing that Mrs. Tangye's husband had been in the
artist's rooms last Tuesday, what would have taken him there?
Within an hour or two of his wife's terrible death.</p>

<p>Did Tangye know of that gift of the money&mdash;or of the
will? Had he come to search the artist's rooms for them? A few
discreet questions had told Pointer that Vardon was quite unaware
of any search among his effects, and nothing is harder, to an
amateur, than to hunt through another person's belongings and
leave them as they were.</p>

<p>Still it was possible that the motive which had brought Tangye
to the rooms, supposing him to have come, was connected with his
wife's visit only a few hours before. But he had apparently taken
Miss Saunders there. It might be therefore, that what he had
wanted was a necessity, was a step, in somethng which he and she
were to proceed to do together.</p>

<p>It was, of course, quite easy to disbelieve Vardon's story,
and see in him the man who had joined the waiting woman and
driven off. But though Pointer did not distrust simple
explanations, he generally tried to make sure that no other ones
were possible, before accepting them.</p>

<p>One thing was certain. If Tangye had left the keys on Vardon's
table, he had done so unintentionally. His quick confession, or
at any rate, his effort to exculpate Vardon as soon as he heard
that one of the notes had been traced to the artist, showed that
he was not trying to fasten any guilt on the other man. That,
too, was evidently the last thing desired by Miss Saunders, but
in her case, if she had made a bargain with Tangye, naturally she
would not want her purchased help to seem unneeded.</p>

<p>Vardon's room&mdash;Mrs. Tangye's
keys&mdash;Tangye&mdash;Pointer's thoughts passed on to the will.
And to the new and startling idea it had given him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he came upon Barbara, a couple of irons under her
arm, on her way home from the links. She looked careworn, he
thought.</p>

<p>"Suppose we exchange news." He fell into step beside her in
obedience to a gesture.</p>

<p>"Do you give a fair exchange-rate?" She spoke a little
wistfully.</p>

<p>He acknowledged the hit with a laugh. A laugh of sympathy; he
was very sorry for Barbara.</p>

<p>"I'll give you full value. Speaking plainly, Miss Ash, I want
to find out something definite from Mrs. Tangye's past. Nothing
in the least to her discredit, but I want to reconstruct her
life. Before she married Branscombe." Barbara's eyes widened. But
she was one of the very few people who, when they have nothing to
say, say nothing.</p>

<p>"You see," he was not looking at her, but at a fine old stag
who paced towards them with ideas of apples, "some people might
think there was a good, sound, probable motive for a murder
already to hand. But I want to make sure that there isn't a
better, sounder, more probable one still, to be got. It's
tremendously true that the strongest motive wins, you know."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. The stag walked huffily off. Pointer
felt that something was stirring in Barbara, was welling up
within her. But after a moment she said quietly, "Surely you know
everything there is to know about Mrs. Tangye's past. I've just
been talking to my grandfather. He says that the worst thing
against Mr. Vardon is that he was seen near Riverview late on
Tuesday afternoon. Is that the case? I mean, is that a very
important thing against him?"</p>

<p>"Very," Pointer admitted, still not looking at her.</p>

<p>"Of course, if any one else had been seen on Tuesday near
Riverview between four and six, it would make a great deal of
difference. But as it is Mr. Vardon seems the only one.
That&mdash;taken into consideration with other things&mdash;does
look very serious."</p>

<p>They were across Richmond Bridge by now. Barbara said good-bye
abruptly. The short winter day was almost over when Pointer
turned back. Stray leaves touched his cheek with cold little
fingers as they fell. The lights of a barge drawn up to be mended
shone red like the eyes of the Great Sea Serpent, who had found a
refuge at last. Pale winter moths floated past. The moths that
some old folk say are the spirits of the dead. They vanished, or
were palely seen, as they drifted now through darkness, now
through the rays of a lamp. They were too much like the
underlying facts of Mrs. Tangye's death, he thought, to be
pleasant company for a detective officer.</p>

<p><br> <br> Pointer had purposely given himself plenty of time
before turning in at Twickenham police court. He was not
surprised to find Barbara Ash being politely entertained by
Haviland. The Superintendent was showing her his stamp
collection, knowing that her grandfather owned a notable one.</p>

<p>"There's something very fascinating about stamps," Haviland
was saying as Pointer hung up his hat. "Nothing uncertain about
them. I always liked geography at school. History no. There's no
proving half of what they tell you in history. But in geography,
if they say a town or river is in a certain place, you can go and
find out for yourself. You can prove it, as a matter of fact.
Even if you don't do it, you know you could go and look. Or
dig..."</p>

<p>Pointer seemed just sufficiently surprised to see Barbara
again so soon. She flinched a little, as she looked up at him.
Then she took a seat further from the light.</p>

<p>"I've something very important to say," Barbara was pale
beneath her tan, "I suppose I should have told you before, but I
didn't realise&mdash;things&mdash;until our talk just now. My
grandfather doesn't know I'm here," she added, with a quaintly
reassuring voice.</p>

<p>"And that's a good thing, too," Haviland thought. Barbara
paused for a moment.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was afraid he might think it unwise&mdash;what I am
going to say."</p>

<p>Pointer thought this highly likely. Only tell the police what
they already know, was Dorset Steele's motto. Barbara drew a deep
breath. She went paler yet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tangye is supposed to've been in town until after six. At
least so my grandfather tells me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The two officials nodded.</p>

<p>"Yet I saw him coming out of Riverview's side gate, the
tradesman's gate, just a few minutes after the churches around
struck half past five."</p>

<p>"Where exactly were you?"</p>

<p>"I was at the corner before you get to the house, coming up
from the river. It's a place where some hollies hang far over the
road."</p>

<p>"What did Mr. Tangye do?"</p>

<p>"He opened the gate very carefully, and very slowly, and
closed it, after standing as though listening for a second, very
quickly behind him. Then he jumped into his car, and was off. I
don't think he saw me."</p>

<p>"Was the engine running?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Had he anything in his hand?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a package of some sort."</p>

<p>Pointer nodded towards some shelves.</p>

<p>"Could you pick out a book of about the size of the package
you saw in his hand?"</p>

<p>Barbara picked up an A.B.C. and a Continental Bradshaw. She
thought that the box in Tangye's hand was about the thickness of
the latter and the general size of the former. Could it have been
a camera? Pointer asked. Barbara thought that it looked not
unlike a large box-camera.</p>

<p>"He came out so oddly. So noiselessly," she repeated, "He
opened the gate without making a sound. And he looked up and down
the garden path before closing it."</p>

<p>"He looked towards the house?"</p>

<p>Barbara nodded. There was a short silence.</p>

<p>"And you yourself, Miss Ash, how did you come to be so close
to Riverview?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I merely happened to be passing," she said awkwardly.
"You can go to our house from the Richmond links either around by
Riverview or through the Deer Park."</p>

<p>Pointer sat quite still. His eyes on his pen point for once.
He had not expected this. He really had thought this girl a fine,
honest, creature. Was she too to come within the circle of those
tainted suspects of his? Oh, the pity of it!</p>

<p>Barbara spoke again. Impulsively, in a rush. This time in her
natural voice. A voice that suggested all things young, and
frank, and fair. "I&mdash;I take that back. I mean, that wasn't
truthful," she broke off in great distress.</p>

<p>Pointer came to her aid.</p>

<p>"You're trying to tell us, aren't you," he said very kindly,
"that you were the visitor whom the maid mistook for Mrs.
Cranburn? At least that's what we've thought for some time."</p>

<p>Pointer had at least suspected as much since his visit to her
father. Barbara fitted in with so many points of the case.
Florence might easily have mistaken a bundled-up figure for that
of a stout woman. And the voice of a girl with a cold for a
wheezy voice. Barbara looked both relieved, and a little
appalled.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you know," she said quietly, "I would have spoken at
once only I was afraid&mdash;after you detained Mr. Vardon, that
you might think there was some connection&mdash;on his part I
mean, because it was me. Florence didn't recognise me. She had
only seen me once."</p>

<p>So Barbara, too, thought that Vardon might be guilty. Or else
she would have come forward at once. Her explanation held good
for the time since Vardon was under police observation, but from
the first she must have suspected him.</p>

<p>"You were calling on Mrs. Tangye?" Pointer asked pleasantly.
"I think you can depend on us, Miss Ash, not to
misunderstand."</p>

<p>Wilmot, who had dropped in to ask a question of Haviland, took
a seat after a glance of permission from Barbara.</p>

<p>"Just a friendly call, I suppose?" Wilmot asked.</p>

<p>"No," she sat with her eyes on her gloved hands, obviously
suffering. "No; not quite that. Not unfriendly, of course. I
wanted to see if I couldn't get Mrs. Tangye to do something for
Mr. Vardon. After that talk on the links," she glanced at
Pointer, "I, too, was rather stirred up, and wondered whether
she, a comparatively wealthy woman, might not be induced to give
Mr. Vardon at least a hearing. He has a perfectly sound
proposition to lay before any one. But she wouldn't let him even
tell her of it."</p>

<p>"Had you ever broached the subject with Mrs. Tangye before?"
Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Never. But I telephoned Sunday afternoon and asked if I might
come in early about three on Monday afternoon as there was
something I wanted to talk over with her. She said that she would
be at her dressmaker's at that hour. I suggested the next day,
Tuesday, about five. She said that would suit her excellently,
especially if I would come to tea. On Monday evening she rang me
up to put off my coming indefinitely, saying she would write and
make another appointment, but I was out, and the maid forgot to
give me her message; so I went on Tuesday, expecting to see
her."</p>

<p>"Do you remember just what she told the maid Monday evening
over the 'phone?"</p>

<p>"Norton says that Mrs. Tangye said, 'Ask Miss Barbara not to
come to-morrow as we arranged. I have a most urgent engagement
that I can't put off. Tell her I'm so sorry. I'll write and
explain.' But, as I say, the message wasn't given me until
Tuesday night when Norton read of Mrs. Tangye's death in the
evening papers. Meantime I started rather late for Riverview from
Hampton Court Palace, where a relative lives." She gave the name.
"I was driving our car myself; something went wrong. It's always
leaving you in the lurch when you want to bustle along. There's a
good garage not far from Riverview, you have to pass the house
coming from Hampton Court." She gave its address. "That's when I
saw Mr. Tangye leaving by the side gate. I went on to the garage
and had a long wait there until some one came to whom I cared to
hand over the car. Then I hurried on to Riverview, though it was
nearly six. As I came to the tradesmen's gate I found Mr. Tangye
had left it open. It cuts off a corner of the little drive, so I
took it too. I walked around the clump of laurels this side of
the morning-room to look in. I wondered if Mrs. Tangye had given
me up. But through the curtains I saw that the light was on, and
hurried back around to the front door. As I stepped away the
curtain was pulled aside for a second, and some one&mdash;a
woman&mdash;peered out between them. Perhaps she heard me on the
path."</p>

<p>Barbara paused for half a second.</p>

<p>"It was Miss Saunders&mdash;I suppose," she added slowly. "Why
suppose?" Wilmot asked.</p>

<p>"It was the most dreadful face I've ever seen," the girl said
in a low voice. "The face of a ghoul. Malignant. Horrible.
Gloating." She shuddered as it seemed to rise again before
her.</p>

<p>"Did she see you?"</p>

<p>Barbara shook her head.</p>

<p>"She was looking in the opposite direction, after one glance
around. As though after Mr. Tangye. I only saw her for a second.
I hurried to the front door and rang the bell. You know what
happened then."</p>

<p>"What made you choose the morning-room?" Pointer asked. He
wanted to give her time, and began with the least important
question.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tangye had said over the 'phone, 'five will suit me
perfectly. You won't mind having tea with me in the morning-room,
I know."</p>

<p>"You knew the house?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. In dear old Mrs. Branscombe's days I used to be
there a lot."</p>

<p>"And now, tell us what happened after you rang the bell. Just
as though we knew nothing."</p>

<p>Barbara recounted the story with which they were all so
familiar by now. She had nothing new to add to the scene in the
morning-room.</p>

<p>"Did you see the revolver?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Underneath her left hand. The next thing I
remember was hearing a man's voice saying, outside the room, 'I
don't think I can do much harm if you and the maid have both been
in.' And I thought I should only be in the doctor's way. I took
it for granted it was a doctor. I thought a caller was certainly
not wanted in the house at such a moment. There were plenty of
women to help. I crossed the hall into what used to be the
housekeeper's room in the old days. It's evidently a smoking-room
now. A moment later I heard people in the hall, and the same
voice, it was the reporter's I learnt at the inquest, asking if
that was the room. I let myself out by the tradesmen's door."</p>

<p>"And why did you say nothing at your home of having been to
Riverview?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"I'm not by way of visiting Mrs. Tangye. Every one knows that.
I should have had to explain why I suddenly called at Riverview
after having refused to go with mother times out of number."</p>

<p>"The coroner remarked on your absence at the inquest."</p>

<p>"Yes. But he said my evidence could not have made any
difference as I had not seen Mrs. Tangye alive. I should have
come forward in spite of everything, if he hadn't added that. But
you see, I hoped to keep it from my own people&mdash;and from
strangers&mdash;that I was going to ask Mrs. Tangye to help
Philip Vardon. It's only now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now that dear Philip is involved," Pointer finished to
himself, rather grimly.</p>

<p>"Now that I am bringing a sort of accusation against Mr.
Tangye, that I see I must tell everything against myself as well.
I owe the truth, all of it, to Mr. Tangye and to you." Barbara's
eyes would have softened a Chinese executioner.</p>

<p>"Did you notice her keys lying on her desk?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I instinctively looked around for a glass of water, and
they were lying beside a glass. I almost touched them before I
noticed that hole just over poor Mrs. Tangye's heart."</p>

<p>"And can you swear that you had not been to Riverview before
your arrival at six last Tuesday?"</p>

<p>She looked surprised.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I can. We discussed the time when I left the
Palace at five, after having been there from before four. And at
the garage both the girl who was there to take telephone orders,
and I kept our eyes on the clock till a mechanic finally arrived
just before six."</p>

<p>When she had left they looked at one another.</p>

<p>"To think I dropped in to tell you two that Tangye has sent in
a formal renunciation of his wife's insurance money. Alas! I know
full well what wild hopes this last little bit of tittle-tattle
will rouse in any policeman's bosom." Wilmot groaned. "I don't
say that my own is quite unperturbed."</p>

<p>"Well, I dunno..." Haviland lit a cigar. "Her story may seem
to let Vardon out, but the fact of her having been at Riverview
at all last Tuesday, just at that hour too, lets him in deeper
than ever to my thinking. And even if she's telling us the
truth&mdash;we can easily verify it&mdash;it goes to show how
much he needed that leg-up. The fact is that both he and Tangye
were evidently desperate for funds just at that time." Haviland
glanced questioningly, however, at the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>"Her story sounded truthful," was the brief reply.</p>

<p>"So it did. But the fact is, all tales told us police sound
that," Haviland commented shrewdly, "when, like Miss Ash, they
take time to think them over. A gal and her young man! I
dunno!"</p>

<p>"We always knew Miss Saunders was putting the screw on Tangye.
The only screw that would make him knuckle under, something
connected with Mrs. Tangye's death." Wilmot had been thinking
over Barbara's story. He, too, thought it had a truthful
ring.</p>

<p>"That part of it's just what the Chief Inspector and me have
maintained from the first," the unblushing Haviland said with
quite a patronising smile.</p>

<p>"What you, or any one else, maintains from the first, doesn't
count," Wilmot retorted, "it's only what you maintain at the end,
that does. I confess&mdash;I confess&mdash;" He sat obviously
considering the new light thrown by the girl on the case.</p>

<p>"It certainly is very disturbing for my Company," he finally
decided aloud. But further than that he would not go.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>

<p class="first">
POINTER got through to the stockbroker over the telephone. He
told the answering clerk that he&mdash;Mr. Wright, the name had
been agreed on with Tangye, wanted to speak to Tangye at once.
Tangye promptly suggested that Wright should come on to see him
in about two hours' time. Until then, every minute was already
engaged.</p>

<p>Pointer agreed, and put in some hours, hard work at his own
rooms in the Yard, wading through the papers waiting for him.
Among them were reports on the purchasers of Lux cameras. In all
England, only three of them had been sold from any known
photographic dealers during the last six months. And all to men.
One had been in the Haymarket to a man identified from his
portrait at once by manager and salesman as Tangye. That had been
close on a fortnight before his wife's death. One had been in
Exmouth, and had been bought by a deeply bronzed, very big,
youngish man, who looked as though he had lived an uncommonly
hard life. One had been sold in Folkestone, only last Monday
morning as soon as the shop opened. In this case the buyer had,
by chance, been recognized by the salesman as Professor Orison,
guest of honour of the local P.S.A. the evening before.</p>

<p>Like the other two, Professor Orison had carried the camera
away with him.</p>

<p>So it was a Lux that Tangye had bought. What had become of it?
Pointer had already sent a man down with careful instructions to
Norfolk, to the house where Tangye had week-ended. He had learnt
that the stockbroker had only been absent from the shooting-party
from early on Sunday till the evening.</p>

<p>He knew too, that Tangye had arrived at North Walsingham with
a camera, because the railway porter had identified his portrait
as that of one of Mr. Riddell's guests who had brought one with
him on his arrival on Saturday, and refused to let him, the
porter, carry it even as far as the car. When the same man left
for town, Monday noon, he had no camera with him. A footman at
the house, too, was quite sure that Mr. Tangye had left on Sunday
morning with his camera in the car beside him, and had not
brought it back on his return in the late afternoon. He said that
Tangye had spoken as though he intended making a present of it to
a lady, and was only testing it first, he supposed that the
stockbroker had done so on the Sunday.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Watts represented himself as sent from the
photographic dealers to whom Tangye had complained of a faulty
lens. They maintained that the camera must have had a bad fall
after it left their hands, and he, Watts, wanted to trace the
camera's movements very carefully. Pointer sat a moment gazing
across the river running beneath his windows.</p>

<p>That youngish, sunburnt-looking man at Exmouth&mdash;Vaguely
the description would have passed for Oliver
Headly&mdash;supposing Oliver to be alive. He took up his pen. It
seemed a hopeless quest, but instructions were sent to the
Exmouth constabulary to do their best. They were furnished with
portraits of the man as he had been twenty years ago. The
photographs from Fez were no good here, for that man had
undoubtedly been stood against a wall by a firing-party. Then
came the last of the three purchasers&mdash;Professor Orison.</p>

<p>Pointer had heard of him as one of the smart lads of the
moment. A lecturer in duchesses' drawing-rooms on the Power of
the Mind. For all that his erudition, like his degree, was
laughed at by scholars.</p>

<p>Pointer had seen him a couple of times. At a royal garden
party. At a ducal wedding. Orison was a striking figure. Thin,
elderly, bent, with a face like a wrinkled glove in which burned
two dark, keen eyes beneath tufted white brows. He claimed to be
of noble Polish descent on his mother's side, and wore a long
drooping Polish moustache, and a Paderewski-like mop of fine
silvery hair. He even spoke with a Polish accent.</p>

<p>Pointer turned to <i>Who's Who,</i> and learnt that Drummond
Orison, Ph.D. of Palmyra, U.S.A., the son of a physician, had
been born in Brussels some seventy years ago. That he had
travelled a great deal, especially in the East. That he had,
never married. That he now lived in Hampstead, and that his
recreations were "Thinking and butterfly catching." That his
publications included two volumes on "The Quantum Theory as
applied to Mind," and other books of a like ilk. All of them
fairly recent publications.</p>

<p>To any one but Pointer it would have seemed a blameless
record. Even a Lux camera might have passed as innocent in such
hands, but the Professor had bought it last Monday, and in
Folkstone&mdash;Folkestone, the end of the railway line on which
Tunbridge Wells lies!</p>

<p>Pointer marked his report with a sign that meant that the
thinker's home was to be the object of special, but very discreet
attention by the policemen who passed it, and that the passing of
it should be included in their programme as often as
possible.</p>

<p>He added in his neat legible writing that the Folkestone
salesman should be skilfully tapped for possible further details
of last Sunday evening. Then he wrote out some instructions for
his own C.I.D. and wound up by cabling to his confreres in
Brussels for particulars of Orison's life while there.</p>

<p>Pointer's man had already learnt that the Professor had
apparently spent last Sunday afternoon travelling to Folkestone,
and Monday and Tuesday in his study at Hampstead.</p>

<p>All seemed quite as it should be, bar that untimely purchase
of a camera. But Pointer took no one at his face value. Or at
least very few people.</p>

<p>It was now high time to drive off for Tangye's office. Pointer
was shown in at once. Tangye met him with some impatience.</p>

<p>"Some important development, I suppose? Since you've asked me
to lose a week-end in town."</p>

<p>"The case is developing," Pointer assured him a little grimly,
"but do you think it's quite fair to your old clerk to let him in
for perjury? For a criminal prosecution? We have a very reliable
witness who saw you during five to six last Tuesday&mdash;not
here in your office."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" Tangye said fiercely, "a damned lie!"</p>

<p>"What was in that package, sir, that you were seen carrying
out of the tradesmen's gate at Riverview about half-past
five?"</p>

<p>Tangye seemed to shrink into his clothes. His knuckles
whitened as he gripped the edge of the writing-table.</p>

<p>"I tell you I wasn't near the place," he began to bluster.
"Mistaken identity!"</p>

<p>"Independent witnesses," Pointer bluffed back.</p>

<p>Tangye rose, and Pointer had to take his leave; to find
Haviland waiting for him in his room at the Yard. The
Superintendent had had a chat with Mrs. Bligh's maid. Tangye had
brought the camera in question with him when he came to lunch at
Tunbridge on Sunday. The maid explained that her mistress then
expected to be invited on a certain yachting cruise to Egypt, and
since her hostessto-be was a keen photographer, she had asked
Tangye to buy her the best camera for temples and indoor work,
and to show her how to use it.</p>

<p>"But she either lost it, or it didn't please her, or
something. Anyway, she didn't have it with her when she came
home. Nor he neither. I know, for I went out to the car. There
wasn't any camera in it," the maid explained.</p>

<p>In the course of further conversation she let it drop that at
the best of times Mrs. Bligh was not a lady who permitted
questions, and that since she had not received the invitation in
question, it would be as much as the maid's life was worth to
speak of photography in any form.</p>

<p>Pointer had already had a private note issued to all
photographic dealers, second-hand shops, and even to all dustmen
in town, asking them to watch out for a large box-camera which
might have been left for repairs, or been thrown out, broken up.
So far nothing had resulted. He had not thought that it
would.</p>

<p>What had become of Tangye's&mdash;or Mrs. Bligh'scamera? Duly
entering its absence in his notes of the case, he turned to some
other work, but within an hour there came another message over
the 'phone from the stockbroker. Would Pointer make it convenient
to see him again at his office?</p>

<p>It was a very chastened Tangye who was speaking.</p>

<p>Pointer dropped everything and hurried into the city. Tangye
shook hands almost eagerly.</p>

<p>"So glad I could catch you. I wanted to see you again at once.
I want to&mdash;er&mdash;modify&mdash;er&mdash;In fact, I've a
damned unpleasant statement to make." He spoke as though it were
the fault of the detective-officer, then he got himself in hand
again. "It's about my alibi. There's no use trying to throw dust
in your eyes, I find."</p>

<p>Pointer thought that bricks rather than dust had been used,
but he only bowed.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," Tangye avoided Pointer's placid gaze,
"I spent part of those two hours which interest you so much with
Miss Saunders, in the Old Deer Park."</p>

<p>Tangye went on to tell of an appeal to him on Tuesday from his
wife's companion after she had received notice to leave Riverview
at once. They had met in the Park, talked it over until at half-past five, he had driven back to his office to see what could be
done.</p>

<p>"Miss Saunders, of course, will bear out every word of this,"
he finished.</p>

<p>"Of course," Pointer echoed politely.</p>

<p>Tangye shot him a glance, but the Chief Inspector took his
leave without further comment. He was due in the Assistant
Commissioner's room.</p>

<p>Pointer and his superiors at New Scotland Yard did not see eye
to eye about Mrs. Tangye's death. The Assistant Commissioner
agreed with Wilmot that only a very active fancy could find a
crime in it. Barbara Ash's little story gave Captain Pelham food
for thought, however, and he sat awhile digesting it.</p>

<p>"Looks as though you were going to be right once again,
Pointer, in that it was a murder, but mistaken in your theory of
how it happened."</p>

<p>"I don't think that's possible," Pointer was never conceited,
but he spoke very firmly. "In many cases, my theory might be
wrong or right, and yet the case would stand. But not here.
Either Mrs. Tangye was murdered as I imagine, or she wasn't
murdered at all. It's that cousin of her's, Oliver, that
complicates all the reasoning."</p>

<p>"You mean that if he dove-tailed with the murderer by chance,
or intention, your idea of an appointment in the Riverview
morning-room loses all its force? That's one of the things I want
to talk to you about.</p>

<p>"We've had a private report from a man whom, even to you, I
can only call Captain X. He's been doing some secret service work
in Morocco. Personally, from what he told me, I haven't the
shadow of a doubt that the Olivier whom the French shot was
Oliver Headly. In in any case, Oliver was a doomed man from the
time the French and Spaniards joined forces. He knew too much.
And he knew it too accurately. When they caught him, he got a
note through to Captain X, giving him some very important
information. Unfortunately he had clearly sent a. previous note
which never reached its billet. The Riffs caught the carrier, X
thinks. In this second note he winds up with 'Don't forget the
message to my cousin.' He signs his note, as he always did,
merely with a circle. X says he met Olivier and is absolutely
sure that he was an Englishman, a man of education, a bad hat,
and a plucky devil. His age he puts at the age Headly would be
now, and he once saw a book in his possession with the initials
O. H. inside it. I think all this rules Mrs. Tangye's cousin out.
Of course there's just a chance that he wasn't Olivier, and
therefore, may still be alive, but I think it's hardly worth
considering. Meanwhile, there's another point.</p>

<p>"Vardon's uncle, he's an M.P. for God knows where, has been
writing to us," Pelham went on pensively. He was a long, loose-limbed, clever-looking man "A nasty note. Wants to know if we are
armed with <i>lettres de cachet,</i> and threatens to set the
press on to asking if <i>Habeas Corpus</i> is dead or not. We've
got to let Vardon go. Or arrest him. That's an order from on
high. Now, what shall it be?"</p>

<p>Pointer had expected this.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. Vardon shall be told at once that he can go
where he likes. Fortunately where he likes will be
Patagonia."</p>

<p>"I'm glad that's your idea of good fortune. I suppose you
chatter Patagonian too, like a native, and will be off there
before we know where you are?"</p>

<p>Pointer laughed.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I'm not interested in Patagonia&mdash;so far. What I
mean is that he'll be practically under observation all the time.
I shall tell him that we have no objection to his leaving, and
ask the captain of whatever ship he chooses to keep an eye on
him. If I may, I'll telephone the good news to him at once."</p>

<p><br> <br> "So Oliver Headly, the cousin, is out of it. Well,
as a matter of fact, he never was really in it," came from
Haviland, as he and Wilmot lunched with Pointer.</p>

<p>"I'm not concerned with Oliver. He's beyond our powers to
investigate or locate," Pointer agreed. "At any rate, Tangye
doesn't fulfil the necessary conditions. Even without Miss
Saunders' support of his latest alibi. I think he's merely a
frightened man, though frightened for very good reasons."</p>

<p>"All the facts we've been able to discover, I still consider
only accidental, not incidental&mdash;from the point of view of a
crime," Wilmot mused, "but had there been a crime here, I should
have thought Tangye&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vardon, Mr. Wilmot!" Haviland struck in, "Vardon's in the
very middle of things. The keys in his luggage. That
will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, that will!" the newspaper man frowned thoughtfully, "that
will!"</p>

<p>"That will suggests a new thought to me," Pointer said, after
a moment's pause.</p>

<p>"A quarrel with her husband?" Wilmot finished.</p>

<p>"I don't call it the will of an angry woman," Pointer
continued. "No, I think&mdash;I think&mdash;there's but one
explanation that fits that will. Easily. And that is that Mrs.
Tangye felt that Tangye had no right to the money."</p>

<p>"Forfeited it, in fact, by his treatment of her?" Haviland
looked a little doubtful. Wilmot only waited.</p>

<p>"Suppose Mrs. Tangye had been married before she met
Branscombe? Married secretly. Thought her husband dead. Say he
was some one&mdash;possibly a criminal&mdash;of whom she was
bitterly ashamed as soon as she had married him. There are three
years of her life of which we have no record, you remember.
Suppose she saw down at Tunbridge last Sunday, not Tangye and
anybody, but this first husband, this only legal husband whom she
had thought long dead and buried&mdash;I think, that would
explain everything. And that alone.</p>

<p>"Tangye is away Sunday. She sees to it that he's away Monday
as well. He may have been speaking the truth when he tells us
that that quarrel had a forced, theatrical air. She may have
snatched at the pretext afforded her by his having been down at
the show, just as she would have jumped at any other excuse. Her
one thought, if my idea is correct, would be to get the man out
of the house who isn't her husband, who never was her husband,
and have a reasonable motive in the eyes of her circle, for
leaving him. By the same argument, Branscombe's money reverts to
his heir. She halves the sale of the farm, her only loose money,
and calls in the sum invested in Tangye's firm which I think she
intended to halve too."</p>

<p>There was a silence as he finished.</p>

<p>"You think that Vardon was really her husband!" Haviland
ejaculated under his breath.</p>

<p>"Where does this lead to&mdash;?" Wilmot asked slowly, "I
don't see&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Vardon. That's where it leads to, Mr. Wilmot, and that's a
fact."</p>

<p>"Vardon?" Pointer spoke meditatively&mdash;. "Maybe, but at
any rate it leads, apparently, directly away from Tangye. At any
rate I shall work from along a different line, and we shall see
where we fetch up. Of course, it's a mere guess. But it's a guess
that might account for Mrs. Tangye's wish not to have her visitor
come to the front door. She would naturally be nervous about any
one seeing the man who was really her husband&mdash;and, if I'm
right, her only husband. It was a position which would make any
woman get rattled."</p>

<p>"But why should he kill her?" asked Wilmot, perplexity in his
voice, "this is all very interesting, very exciting even, but
where does it lead to? Why the deuce should he kill her? She,
him&mdash;yes. But there's no sense in his doing away with
her!"</p>

<p>"Suppose he were a convicted felon? A sentence still hanging
over him? Or, married? Has a family? Or on the eve of another
marriage? He, too, may have believed her dead. Since he seems
to've made no effort to come across her before. There might be
reasons, many reasons, which would fit in here."</p>

<p>"Vardon fits in, right enough in fact," Haviland murmured.
"He's in love with that pretty Miss Ash."</p>

<p>"Would fit! Might be reasons!" Wilmot shook his head.
"Pointer, your suspicion is like the sun which only circles, but
never sets."</p>

<p>"Still, it would fit the facts," Haviland said with
enthusiasm, "and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean it fits Vardon," Wilmot retorted tartly. "I think
we're only getting more and more at sea. You're going too far and
too fast, Pointer, when you take to inventing a third husband for
that poor lady, or rather only one."</p>

<p>Pointer merely nodded a pleasant good-bye as he hurried off.
Three years of Mrs. Tangye's life were unexplored. The years from
twenty to twenty-three. Her father was dead by that time. She had
gone away with a relative of her mother's, a highly respectable
lady, who had died two years before Miss Headly reappeared to
teach in a high school in town. She had always been a poor
correspondent. Her friends had believed that she had meanwhile
been somewhere in the north of England. The Headmistress of the
school in London thought that she had gone as governess to some
family connection, but as she knew Mable Headly of old, she had
not looked the matter up.</p>

<p>It was quite possible that those three years would not explain
the mystery, but Pointer could see no other chance of clearing it
up. But how to get on the track of them? He had been trying in
vain all this week to get into touch with any one who could
supply him with a clue, a jumping-off board. None had been found.
Possibly there was no mystery. If so, this last effort, too,
would end in vague ripples. If the guilty man were Vardon, the
investigations would come back to the artist. Slowly possibly,
but surely. Those footsteps that stopped in the garden last
Tuesday...</p>

<p>They still were on the wrong side of the circle which, as he
reminded Wilmot, had two sides. Would they resist his efforts
much longer to trace the person to whom they belonged?</p>

<p>It was barely possible, of course, that Mable Headly had got
actively entangled with criminals, not merely by a hypothetical
marriage to one. She might have dipped down into the underworld
herself. But a criminal for three years, and before, and after,
those years never to fall below the line of highest
respectability? Pointer had never come across such a case, for
Mrs. Tangye had not struck any one as a two-sided woman. All that
Pointer could learn of her was of a piece.</p>

<p>What did fit his theory, was what he had heard about her
throwing a halo over the past. Over what she had lost.</p>

<p>Pointer thought this explained her actions when, or if, she
had met a first husband whom she had supposed dead, last Sunday.
Suppose that husband in need of money? Suppose he had ingratiated
himself with her? Suppose he had talked of starting life again
together? Mrs. Tangye had shown herself a woman very easily
affected by men. Mrs. Tangye collects her papers bearing on her
money affairs, gives away her clothes which would only remind her
of what must shock her deeply&mdash;life with a man to whom she
finds she is not married. That letter to Miss Eden becomes
intelligible under this light. After receiving this rediscovered
husband on Monday, they arrange that on Tuesday she shall leave
Riverview, either with him, or more likely far, after him.
Pointer thought that she was obviously planning her escape from
her old life to look like a separation from Tangye because of
Tangye's flirtations. Pointer could imagine more than one reason
why Mrs. Tangye to give her the name she bore, but which he had
begun to think might not have been hers legally&mdash;should
decide not to reveal the truth till later, if ever.</p>

<p>Seeing her husband's infatuation with Mrs. Bligh, Pointer
thought that she was the type to have never told the real truth,
to have never set free the man and woman she thought had deceived
her. She had looked a very jealous woman to Pointer. He recalled
Miss Eden's words about her being capable under provocation, of
acting very unjustly.</p>

<p>Pointer's men had not been able to trace any marriage earlier
than that to Branscombe. But she might have married abroad. Or
even under another name. But the point was, how to get into touch
with her past?</p>

<p>He went for one of his short, brisk, walks in the pouring rain
that slanted down like silver threads sewing earth to heaven.</p>

<p>How to get into touch with that buried past of Mrs. Tangye's?
With that unknown bit that extended from fifteen years ago, from
the time when the late Lady Susan Dawlish, her mother's aunt,
took her away on her father's death, till she reappeared in the
London high school, three years later.</p>

<p>The last time he had seen Tangye in Riverview, the stockbroker
had been taking down his wife's fishing-gear from the wall. Her
basket had been a roomy, Welsh osier creel. How about the flies
in an old book that Pointer had borrowed on his first visit to
the den, a fly-book evidently home-made, bearing the initials M.
H. on the coarse flannelette cover? He had taken it as an
additional proof that Mrs. Tangye had really been left-handed in
her girlhood, since it dated from then, so Tangye had told him,
when he let him keep it temporarily.</p>

<p>They were not Scottish flies, that Pointer knew. Each locality
has its own variants of the regular standbys, and these were
different from those he had himself used in Scottish rivers.
Apart from whence they came, they had told him several
things.</p>

<p>They had been made by a left-handed person, and, though very
neatly done, the cheapest materials alone had been used. And they
were copies of cheap flies, too, so Pointer thought. Now, neither
Over nor Nether Wallop lies by a river, yet these flies had seen
much usage. They were salmon flies moreover, and such a complete
set would hardly have been made for a mere visit to relations.
Nor could Pointer trace any such visits, and he had tried hard.
These flies therefore, he thought, might belong to that uncharted
bit of Mable Headly's life.</p>

<p>Pointer drove to an angler's shop in Jermyn Street which he
himself often patronised.</p>

<p>"Welsh flies these," the salesman said, pouring over the lot,
"old-fashioned. Twenty years old, I should say, or copies of
flies twenty years old. That's an Usk Canary. But whipped to a
string of gut! Tut, tut! Home-made evidently. But neatly done.
And neatly used too. You can always tell if they've been jerked.
Hullo. That's one of Father William's old Parsons. He's given up
those hackles years ago. But that's no copy."</p>

<p>"Sure? It may be important."</p>

<p>"Certain. If I found the Grand Lama using it in Thibet, I'd be
certain."</p>

<p>"And who is Father William?"</p>

<p>"He's a character, that's what he is, sir. And the best rod
south of the Tweed, amateur or pro. He never leaves the Usk. Not
he! To see him cast a fly&mdash;oh, it's a beautiful sight! He's
always out with his rod as soon as they take the nets off. Began
life as a gillie. Used to sell his flies to the gentlemen who
employed him, and so started in the business. Those Durham
Rangers and Jock Scotts over there are his work. They look a bit
light, but Lord, they make the right ripples. And that's the
whole secret, ain't it, sir? It's not so much the fly you use,
though that counts, of course, it's the way he 'lights. But it
takes Father William to get the right kick out of 'em. He has a
way!"</p>

<p>Pointer asked for the address of this pattern.</p>

<p>"William Morgan is his name. His cottage is Ty-Cerrigliwydian.
It's just outside the town of Usk. But you'll never find him
there, sir. He's out fishing all day, and at the Inn of an
evening. He loves to talk, does Father William. Age? Getting on
for seventy, I should say, and good for another seventy
again."</p>

<p>Usk? Now Usk is not far from Cardiff. And Pointer had just
been reading that name in connection with the dead woman, though
not a close connection. Remembering Tangye's and Sladen's words
about Mrs. Tangye having told each of them that she had once had
something to do with a bank that had failed, Pointer had had a
list of all such failures in the last twenty years sent him. Her
name had not figured among the depositors, but that meant little.
There had been a big smash fourteen years ago in Cardiff.</p>

<p>And also&mdash;oddly enough about that time&mdash;he was very
vague as to dates, said he never could be sure within a couple of
years, Vardon claimed to have had his headquarters at Cardiff for
some eighteen months while working partly on some local stage
scenery, partly on sketches of the country around. His dates were
so elastic, and his localities so vague, that Pointer again
wondered whether this were accident or design. He had wrung a few
names out of him finally, and turned them over to Watts of the
C.I.D. to investigate.</p>

<p>Pointer drove first to New Scotland Yard, and arranged matters
with the Assistant Commissioner. Then he dropped in to see
Wilmot.</p>

<p>"I'm leaving the affair in Haviland's hands for a while," he
explained.</p>

<p>"Who's he to lose this time?" Wilmot asked with great
interest.</p>

<p>Pointer had to laugh.</p>

<p>"He can turn to you for advice if he gets hung up in too many
facts, and the Yard'll throw cold water on any schemes, which are
over-desperate with regard to Vardon. I want to be free to do a
bit of routine work."</p>

<p>"In the wilds of Upper, or Nether Wallop?"</p>

<p>"Neither. I'm off to hobnob by the banks of the swift-flowing
Usk with a gentleman yclept Father William."</p>

<p>"It sounds a pleasant change from the hurly-burly of town,"
Wilmot murmured enviously, "a big detectve has a tremendous pull
over a newspaper man. We can't suddenly feel that our work
demands a dash to the forests of Malay, or a fortnight in the
best hotel of a smart winter resort. You can. You don't have to
keep a list of the relations who've already died; nor check up
your attacks of the flu. What's your excuse?"</p>

<p>Pointer told him. Wilmot was thoroughly interested, but
expressed himself as very sceptical of any good results.</p>

<p>"Seems a blind alley to me."</p>

<p>"That's to find out. Merely as part of the regular routine it
has to be tried."</p>

<p>"The Insurance Company has just sent me a little reminder that
things seem to be hanging fire."</p>

<p>"Why not come along with me on your own? The nets are being
left off the Usk a month late this year. Come and help me
fish."</p>

<p><i>"Me!</i> My dear chap, I shall prepare to receive you when
you return in silence and tears, and I promise you here and
voluntarily, to ask no questions, nor, except under severest
provocation, to mention the word Wales in your presence for the
next five years."</p>

<p>"That ought to suffice."</p>

<p>There was a ring on the telephone. It was from Watts. Was the
Chief Inspector in Wilmot's rooms by chance? Pointer assured him
that he was.</p>

<p>"I haven't been able to check up Vardon in Cardiff, sir. The
address he gave you was pulled down some eight years ago. The
company for which he claimed to've painted that scenery, failed
about two years before that. None of the inns about remember him.
I couldn't come on any trace of him at all."</p>

<p>Pointer turned away thoughtfully.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>

<p class="first">
VARDON had barely laid down the telephone before he dashed
into a taxi and drove to Dorset Steele's office with news that he
was now a free men. The lawyer hummed, and hawed, and
threw&mdash;not so much cold water as vinegar, on the other's
apparent optimism. He refused to see the daylight at the end of
the tunnel.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Barbara, too, was not so radiant as Vardon
seemed to be. She was more concerned with what Pointer had said
than with the mere fact of Philip being allowed to go where he
pleased.</p>

<p>"Did he say that he thought you innocent?" she asked more than
once. Vardon put her off with pointing out that deeds spoke
louder than words. But Barbara was not satisfied.</p>

<p>She went to see the Chief Inspector herself.</p>

<p>"Does this mean that you think he's innocent?" she asked
bluntly.</p>

<p>"Do you know what would happen to me if I let him go, and he
were guilty?" Pointer asked with apparent candour. "We're not
allowed to make blunders like that, Miss Ash. We're expected to
go down with the ship."</p>

<p>"Grandfather says he'll be watched in Sweden where he has to
go first&mdash;about some timber, and afterwards on the ship to
Patagonia. Closer even than on land. He'll be watched in every
port. He'll be watched between every port."</p>

<p>Pointer did not reply. Grandfather was a wise old bird.
Barbara left him, but little comforted.</p>

<p>A ring came at the door of the little studio where she worked
at her china painting. Barbara was not pleased. Visitors meant
dust, and dust meant specks.</p>

<p>It was Mary Eden. Barbara liked Mary. Though one was older
than the other, they were both of them Cheltenham girls. That
counted. Mary was looking ill.</p>

<p>"I was passing, and felt that f must drop in and see you. Do I
disturb you?"</p>

<p>Barbara told her that she did not, and by way of proving the
statement, began putting her things away in a cupboard.</p>

<p>"Is it true that Philip Vardon is leaving for Patagonia?" Mary
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Barbara said that it was true. Mary Eden shivered, and drew
closer to the fire. There was silence for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"I'm glad he's free from suspicion. But oh, Barby! Barby!" and
with that, to her own, and Barbara's, boundless surprise, Mary
Eden began to cry. Terribly. Heartbrokenly.</p>

<p>It was over in a moment. But it was not forgotten, and it left
its traces on the elder girl's face. These were the kind of tears
that relieve.</p>

<p>"Since you've seen so much, I might as well tell you all,"
Mary said brokenly. "It's Charlie Tangye. He thinks he's going to
be arrested&mdash;for his wife's murder. Murder!" Mary Eden
shivered. "It's no use pretending that things aren't very
suspicious. You see, he was in a frightfully tight place
financially, it seems, and&mdash;well, of course, it was his own
money&mdash;but he seems to've sent off some hundreds that same
evening that she died. I couldn't make out about the money.
Apparently Chief Inspector Pointer thinks it was taken before the
police got to Riverview, and of course, that looks bad. So
do&mdash;other things. Some one saw him come out of the house
about five." Barbara winced. "He went back for some papers to do
with his, and her insurance. Intending to raise money on them.
And, of course, that looks terrible. His having kept silence, as
well as his having been there, and the reason for his going. It's
all terrible. Miss Saunders is standing by him splendidly. I
wouldn't have thought she had it in her. But he's desperately
afraid that the police intend to arrest him. He thinks Pointer
doesn't believe her."</p>

<p>Barbara felt appallingly guilty. Had she bought Vardon's
release with the torture of another man? Like Mary Eden, she felt
sure of easy-going Mr. Tangye's innocence.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you can help," Mary went on forlornly, "but
if you can think of some trifle?" she spoke wistfully. "I did
help to clear Philip, you know, and by something that told
frightfully against Mr. Tangye. He says the Superintendent spoke
as though I might be called as a witness against him." She bent
forward again.</p>

<p>"Barbara, I helped to clear Philip," she repeated, "can't you
help to clear Charlie Tangye? You're so quick-witted. Can't you
think of <i>anything</i> we can do?"</p>

<p>Barbara had no help to give, and Mary kissed her as she
left.</p>

<p>"Forget this scene, Barby," she said, holding her hand.
"Forget it entirely. What I've said, and what I haven't
said."</p>

<p>Barbara let her go with a remorseful heart. How could she have
acted otherwise? Yet what had she done? It was ridiculous to
suppose that Tangye was guilty, but if his wife's death was a
murder, as the police maintained, then some one had done it. Some
one, but surely not, oh surely not...</p>

<p>She broke the cup on which she was working, and merely pushed
the bits on one side with her foot, as she sat thinking.</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Pointer had said that the best motive would
win. Barbara felt afraid of the detective-officer since that one
glimpse of the inner man. But his words carried weight. Could she
find another motive than the obvious one of the will, the money.
That was what he was trying to do she knew. He had questioned her
about Mrs. Tangye's past, but the Ashes had only known the dead
woman since her marriage to Branscombe. Barbara had been of no
help, nor had Lady Ash, to whom her daughter had written at once,
been able to remember anything that would serve.</p>

<p>But she had sent a letter to her husband saying that Barbara
ought to go away for a while. Sir Richard agreed most
emphatically. Barbara had refused. Now she reconsidered that
refusal. There would be no rest for her anywhere till she knew
who really had killed Mrs. Tangye. She shivered. Up till now her
intervention had only made things worse for everybody in turn.
But she must try again and again.</p>

<p>Barbara knew that Mrs. Tangye's early life in her father's
parish till she was nineteen had been searched by Scotland Yard
without any result, so her grandfather had told her. But what
about France? As a true Briton, the girl had a feeling that if
anything odd, or out of the way, had happened in Mrs. Tangye's
past, it would be abroad. But there was no use in her going to
France. Her command of that tricky but charming language was such
as a high-school education generally leaves with its pupils. It
was all right in England, but seemed all wrong in France. The
replies of the natives even to the simplest of statements, failed
to restrict themselves to a vocabulary, which surely was
voluminous enough, judging by the years that it had taken to
acquire.</p>

<p>Barbara reluctantly decided that she was foredoomed to
failure, since she must clearly confine herself to her home land.
But where to begin? How to begin?</p>

<p>Common sense told her that everything had been already sifted.
Yet the Chief Inspector had questioned her as though he were not
entirely satisfied. If she had a chance, Barbara decided that it
would be found in some unnoticed corner. But how find that
corner? She sat cleaning her brushes and thinking. Had she any
knowledge, any forgotten, overlaid, scrap of information which
would help?</p>

<p>It was when she had given it up as hopeless, and started on
her work again, that she remembered some old songs.</p>

<p>When Mr. Branscombe died, now four years ago, Mrs. Branscombe,
as she then was, had sent his Broadwood piano to Sir Richard Ash,
saying that Cecil Branscombe had wanted his old partner to have
it as a souvenir of their friendship. A music bench had
accompanied the gift. In it the Ashes had found an armful of old
songs. They were still lying somewhere in the attic. Lady Ash had
spoken at once of sending them back. But the widow had said, with
obvious sincerity, that though she had no idea of their preserice
in the bench, she never sang them, and had no use for them.</p>

<p>Barbara seemed to remember an inscription of some sort on one
of them.</p>

<p>She disinterred the tattered bundle at home after a
considerable hunt. One only was marked, and that with a round
rubber stamp, "W. Griffith, Cathedral Road, Newport." It was a
little Welsh song, very dog-eared. At one time or other it had
been a favourite. It was a man's song. Set for a tenor voice.</p>

<p>Still it suggested to her a possible starting point. Newport
itself seemed too commercial to figure on any girl's itinerary,
but Caerlean was close by, the home of the Round Table Knights.
Close, too, was beautiful Llandaff Cathedral of which her father
had often spoke to her. Tintern Abbey was not far off. Raglan
Castle was within reach. Yes, to Newport Barbara would go, and
since whatever it may be for the man, this world emphatically
holds that still less is it good for a girl to be alone, she
decided to take her mother's advice in yet another respect, and
let Olive come with her. Poor Olive was still badly in need of
bracing up.</p>

<p>Dorset Steele was out of town, she was rather glad of that.
The critic on the hearth is apt to be avoided in times of
doubt.</p>

<p>As to funds, she had just sold a dinner service for eighteen
guineas. Eighteen and five are twenty-three. With that in hand,
Barbara felt sure that she and Olive could stay a fortnight in
some quiet spot.</p>

<p>Not even November can take the beauty out of South Wales. And
through that land of dingle and dell, glen and mountain torrent,
waterfall and wooded hill, ferny dale, and sweeping uplands runs
the Usk; broad and winding. The river, beloved alike by Welshman,
and artist, historian, salmon and trout.</p>

<p>The Wye may equal it, but nothing in the wide world can
surpass&mdash;in its own way&mdash;the sweep between two
rivers.</p>

<p>Just now the only colours were soft aquamarine and gray, but
in its proper season all would be bright with orchards and hop
fields, drooping willows and golden wheatfields set among the
shimmering green of fragrant meadows belted by hills, and ringed
by distant mountains. And all down the valley other little
rippling streams branch out, each with its waterfalls, and
bending arms of ferns. The Country of Castles, and of Arthur's
Knights this. Of tales that circle every hillock and sit on every
stone. Wealhas Tales; tales of fairies. Tales of fighting by the
score. The very dust is the dust of bards, of sweet singers to
the harp.</p>

<p>The Usk runs between curving banks, and broadens here and
there into dusky pools with gay, one-storeyed homesteads set at
intervals along it; their thatched roofs a joy to the eye.</p>

<p>Pointer thought of the reams of paper covered by rhapsodies
about the beauties of other lands, beauties far below those of
this little corner of Britain.</p>

<p>The town of Usk is a charming nook in summer, but it looked
rather forlorn on a wet November day. Fishermen by trade, or
inclination, seemed to be its only male inhabitants.</p>

<p>Pointer went first to the police station. No one of the name
of Headly was remembered there. No photograph of the Riverview
circle awoke any recollection in Inspector or constable. Remained
Father William.</p>

<p>The day was fine, yet not too fine. A perfect angler's day.
Pointer followed his Ollie down to the hurrying river, where he
speedily put his rod together. It had not been used for over a
year now. He tested it, limbering his wrists, and snapping them
to get the right flip, the little flip which would send the fly
dancing up again when almost on the water, to alight as though by
its own volition.</p>

<p>He took out his book of flies. The gillie pointed to one, and
mumbled something about its being from Father William, oh,
yes.</p>

<p>Pointer knotted on one of the local celebrity's masterpieces
and set to work. It was over an hour later when he got his
chance. There came a surging plunge, a tug, the line flew
screaming off the reel. Pointer was fast in a salmon. Whir-r-r
went the line as the fish tore in a mad rush down the stream.
Then up he came. A mighty form that rose with a swirl. One of
those strange, mysterious creatures who live in an element, a
world of their own, where men die, and who die where men live. He
shot clear of the water in a great leap. More beautiful than
anything that breathes in the open air. Beautiful as a fairy's
dream. His whole splendid length one curve of glistening silver
with mauve shadows, a twirling, splashing, like a living water-wheel. Almost translucent he looked, showing purple and azure,
and green, and always that molten, living silver.</p>

<p>Again and again he leaped, sending the water high into the
air. Each time Pointer dropped the tip of his rod, and so saved
the cast. This salmon knew the game. There was a last year's
spawning ring marked on those bright flanks. He struck a smashing
blow with his tail to free himself. Another scream from the reel,
and off he flew. Pointer had to race to keep below him as he made
down-stream with what seemed the speed of an express train. From
slippery rock to mossy stone Pointer jumped, and scrambled.</p>

<p>Then the salmon took a breather. He burrowed, trying to free
his lip from the barb. He sulked. He circled heavily round and
round this new pool with a vigour that told the rage in his
heart.</p>

<p>Again came the flash of silver lightning, swirling, diving,
leaping, shaking, in a frantic effort to get free, then came
another rush that bent the rod like a bow, that cut a feather of
spray as the line ripped through the water.</p>

<p>Skilfully Pointer parried each stroke, his finger on the
snapping reel to check the play. At every turn, and tumble, and
toss, Pointer's rod held him, played him, wound him in or reeled
him out. Then came a rest, Pointer wiped the sweat from his eyes.
The fish was not sulking now. The line was too taut for that.
Like a cross thoroughbred in a dull stable, he was thinking out
some fresh devilment for the next round. It came suddenly. The
salmon rose like a whirlwind. The water seemed lifeless compared
to the beautiful lights and shadows of him. Living light, and
living shadow.</p>

<p>With a break that was like a punch he was off. This time there
was even more method. He was trying to catch the gut between two
sharp stones. He gave another wonderful exhibition of a silver
Catherine's wheel on the churned and broken surface of the water.
The very sun came out to watch, and turned him to gold. The rod
quivered under the strain. Pointer stood, or ran, or leaped,
calm-eyed, watchful, alert, trying to think with the fish below.
Then came the last round. Pointer was keeping him in rough water
to tire him out. The fish realised this, and came upstream at
such a rate that he all but shot past. The rod was bent down, and
down, and down still more in a mighty pull. But the strain told
on the salmon. Shorter and shorter grew his rushes. Less and less
wonderful his leaps and whirls. At last he rose on his side.
Spent. Done.</p>

<p>Pointer towed him to the side. The gillie drove the gaff home,
and lifted him ashore.</p>

<p>"Well done, sir!" came a voice&mdash;not unexpected by
Pointer. He had played for it more than for the fish. "A fine,
fresh run, twenty-pounder."</p>

<p>Pointer looked at the fish on the bank. The sight was not
pretty. Sunken and glassy those bright eyes, open that close-clipped jaw. Gone was the wonderful iridescence of the scales.
The wild and savage creature, an Apollo's bow of energy, was
straight and still now. He was, to what he had been, as a two-days' cut flower it to its growing sister.</p>

<p>Pointer was no sportsman in the sense of slayer. He had to
hunt men. He did so with the certainty that he was doing the best
work possible for the world, and even, in reality, for them. But
to lift this beautiful thing out of its element, to kill it, gave
him no pleasure. He had landed what he was after, however, and
that was Father William's attention.</p>

<p>"Twenty pounds, you think? He looked the size of a motor-bus
to me awhile back, and pulled like one."</p>

<p>"You've made a wonderful beginning," the man on the bank went
on approvingly, "and if that ain't one of my flies&mdash;I'm
William Morgan, Father William, they call me&mdash;why, I'm
prepared to eat it."</p>

<p>Pointer assured him that there was no necessity for such an
extreme measure. He added that he would not dream of beginning
his first fishing in Wales with any other cast. Father William,
plump as a ball of butter, smiled, well-pleased.</p>

<p>"It was a fine fight. Newcomer to these waters, you say, sir?
But done a good bit of salmon fishing, I can see." Pointer
mentioned his name, only his name.</p>

<p>"A woman taught me to cast my first fly. Came from near here,
I believe."</p>

<p>"Came from around here? What name, might I ask, sir! I know
all the rods <i>O Gaergybi i Gaerdydd,</i> as we say. These years
and old years back. Sixty years back."</p>

<p>"She was a Miss Headly when I knew her. I believe she married
afterwards. I don't know what the name of her husband was."</p>

<p>"Miss Headly? Not a name I've ever heard. No." Father William
shook his head.</p>

<p>"But she used to buy her flies off you, when she could afford
it. Big, tall, handsome woman. Carried herself well. Used to fish
hereabouts fifteen years ago, or a little less. Left-handed."</p>

<p>"Left-handed! Oh, you mean, Mrs. Hart! Only left-handed person
I've ever known. She was a wonder, she was. And tall, and
handsome, as you say. Dark, too. Dark as one of us. Yes, Mrs.
Hart is who you mean, sir."</p>

<p>"Very likely. I knew her before her marriage. Does she still
live here?"</p>

<p>"Drowned, sir. Drowned with her husband off Newport. Caught in
a tempest. Boat upset. Neither of them ever heard of again.
Silent sort of lady, but her rod could talk. Being left-handed
was no bar to her. Let me see, she must have been drowned going
for ten years ago. Or more still. More like thirteen it would be.
Yes, the years go past like the water in the river, and mean no
more. They always were, they always are. Well, I've had plenty
for my share. Seems one of the few things you can have your fill
of, without doing other people out of their share. Years, I mean.
Yes." And Father William led his companion to the Angler's Rest,
for the day was over. Here the fish was weighed, and the tale of
his killing told to the little knot of the fraternity sitting
around the fire, their clothes steaming like the mist in the
valley when the sun shines, their long glasses steaming too.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful old kitchen. Six feet up, around this
mighty hearth with its ingle-nook seats, and well away from the
blazing logs, ran a large brass half-hoop on which a red curtain
hung. The curtain in many divisions was only pulled shut when all
the "club" had assembled. Then it was not only pulled close, but
tucked under the cushioned seats of the semi-circle of chairs,
shutting out all the world except fishermen and their tales.</p>

<p>Father William was the presiding chairman. From him a little
pathway led by the side of the billowing curtain to the rest of
the tiled kitchen. Through this passage came the maid with the
drinks. Toddy, as brewed by Father William, was the usual call,
and Pointer echoed it. Talk became general. Pointer was
accepted.</p>

<p>He let the flood of misses, and catches, and weights and
measures flow on for an hour by the great clock above his head.
Then he introduced the object of his presence. Some solicitors in
town wanted to trace Miss Headly, he said. Question of a bit of
money left her on her sister's death.</p>

<p>"As I was coming here for some fishing, I said I would ask
around. Miss Headly of hereabouts taught me to fish years ago,
before she married. This is a portrait of her sister. Is this at
all like the lady you call Mrs. Hart? The two sisters as girls
were said to resemble each other closely."</p>

<p>Only two men besides Father William had known Mrs. Hart. They
all three thought that the portrait of Mrs. Tangye&mdash;taken
only a few months ago&mdash;might well have passed as a picture
of Mrs. Hart, supposing that poor woman to have lived on.</p>

<p>"She was a younger woman then, you see," one of the men said
handing back the portrait, "twenty, and a bit. No more. Too young
to've come to such an end. But it's the young ones as are the
rash ones."</p>

<p>None of the three had known her intimately.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hart was a hard woman," one of them said.</p>

<p>"Hardly treated, I thought," another corrected; "her husband
drank, I heard. She had to sell her catches to keep her body and
soul together."</p>

<p>"What was her husband?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Used to swank about an estate of his, but after he was
drowned, it came out that he was a little peddling grocer's
manager down in Newport."</p>

<p>Pointer could collect no facts from the talk. Even the tragedy
was but a vague memory. The broken boat had been found one
morning after a sudden storm, on Peterstone Flats, just outside
Newport, at the mouth of the Usk.</p>

<p>No trace of either body had ever been found, but the tide, and
the rocks, and the storm would account for that.</p>

<p>Pointer let the talk swing round to fishing again. He did not
want to arouse curiosity. He had better means of learning the
truth now than from idle gossip.</p>

<p>He sent off a telegram to the Yard to look up the marriage
records of all H's with even greater care than had been done.
Then Pointer caught the train into noisy Newport.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>

<p class="first">
NEXT morning Pointer awoke from a dream in which he had been
playing a weird game of golf. He had not been able to hit a ball,
let alone drive one! Worn out, he had just clambered over a
hazard to find Wilmot on the eighteenth green holing a
magnificent putt, and saying affably, "Try my pet club Intuition;
it's more flexible than that old-fashioned iron Proof which I see
you still use."</p>

<p>The dream haunted Pointer, but half an hour later saw him at
the chief police office in Newport, turning over the records of
thirteen years ago. He found the tragedy reported in full. The
brief description of the couple fitted Mrs. Tangye for the woman,
and for the husband might have fitted Vardon, or many another
man.</p>

<p>Irving Hart, described as a grocery shop manager, was the same
age as his wife: twenty-two.</p>

<p>The boat used by the husband for salt-water fishing was a
small yacht of three tons, partially covered, yawl-rigged, which
he had himself skilfully fitted up. The kind of little craft a
man could be out in all night if need be. A shore loafer came
forward to testify that he helped Hart himself launch it rather
late in the afternoon. Mrs. Hart came down at the last moment and
got in. He, the witness, had warned them that a change of weather
was coming, but Hart had only laughed at him.</p>

<p>Within two hours there were wild sea manes tossing as far as
the eye could see. By nightfall no boat could have hoped to put
in. Many a one went to pieces in that storm. Many a fisherman
failed to return.</p>

<p>The loafer in question had long disappeared. His evidence at
the time had been believed, partly because it was considered
unbiased, partly because none of the Harts' effects were missing
from their rooms. A couple of very respectable women, too, bore
out that they had seen Mrs. Hart about the time mentioned walking
fast to the cove where the boat lay. Creel and rod in hand,
oilskin on arm.</p>

<p>As to the shop&mdash;the only address entered in the newspaper
accounts or on the warrant&mdash;the great new docks had engulfed
the street where it had stood. A police-sergeant, who remembered
the inquest well, had a hazy notion that the Harts had lodged
somewhere else, but he was not certain on the matter, far less
could he remember any address. The Chief Inspector was unable to
find any one who could settle this point. Water rates&mdash;gas
companies&mdash;all had only the shop address.</p>

<p>One thing was curious, Hart seemed to have no background.
Pointer could not learn of any parents, any home, from which he
had come.</p>

<p>True, this was not unusual, supposing him to be ashamed of all
three. He might even have none, in any but the literal sense of
the word. He might have been an orphan&mdash;a foundling&mdash;an
unwanted child.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if Hart were Vardon, then the lack was
easily, obviously, explained. There was no mystery about Vardon's
parentage and home. Vardon's whereabouts could not be traced
during that summer nor for the year succeeding, nor for that
matter, without the expenditure of a great deal of time and
money, for still another couple of years, which he purported to
have spent journeying round the world.</p>

<p>Certainly here in Wales, death, or other natural causes seemed
to have removed every one with whom he claimed to have come in
contact.</p>

<p>A reply telegram came from the Yard in cipher. The Somerset
House register showed no sign of yielding any earlier marriage on
Mable Headley's part than that to Branscombe.</p>

<p>Pointer looked hard at his boot-tips. Apart from his belief
that the woman he had heard called Mrs. Tangye would not have
stooped to such a position, the tale he had learnt sounded
preposterous unless Mable Headly had been tied to Hart. Why
should she, young, with many friends, and certificates that would
enable her to teach in any school in the British Isles, have
stayed to face such drudgery? Yet if she had been married, how to
find the record of it?</p>

<p>In a moment he was on his feet, and at work on what he called
routine.</p>

<p>He worked backwards, and forwards, and sideways, and all ways
around his new idea of a marriage at sea, and as the result of
three days and nights of incessant work, he learnt an interesting
little tale which unravelled at least a part of the mystery that
so perplexed him, the mystery of Mrs. Tangye's actions just
before she was murdered.</p>

<p>The story, duly vouched for step by step, was as follows:</p>

<p>Lady Susan Dawlish had come to Bettws-y-coed one summer
fifteen years ago with her great-niece, Mable Headly, then about
twenty. They had stayed at the best hotel in that lovely spot.
Mable played an uncommonly good game of tennis. So did a Mr.
Hart, a visitor at the same hotel. Also he sang in a well-trained
tenor, while Mable played charming accompaniments. He gave out
that he belonged to a good family in Ireland. Talked of his
hunters, and polo ponies, and passed for the younger son of a
hard-up landowner. Lady Susan disliked him intensely at first
sight, and took the pretext of "doctor's advice" to go to Colwyn
Bay. She had complained of the young man's unwanted attentions,
mentioning that any such match would be preposterous, as her
great-niece would be extremely well off, since she, Lady Susan,
intended leaving her all her money. The old lady was wealthy,
even by post-war standards.</p>

<p>At Colwyn Bay, Pointer found that Hart had followed the two
women, taking up his quarters in another hotel, but one which
used the same tennis courts. But after a fortnight Lady Susan
received a telegram. Her maid had told the manageress that it was
from some relatives who were starting for the Colonies, relatives
of the older woman, whom Miss Headly did not even know. Lady
Susan went on to Holyhead to see them off, taking her maid with
her. They were only to be gone two days.</p>

<p>Miss Headly promptly utilised the first to go out with Hart on
a little craft which plied up and down the coast.</p>

<p>They went out beyond the three-mile limit, upon which the
skipper, and owner, married them. A perfectly valid marriage.</p>

<p>The two young people returned next morning, very pleased with
themselves. Old Lady Susan would have to make the best of it now.
But she never returned. That afternoon a telegram arrived to say
that she had been knocked down by a motor, and killed instantly.
That was all the manageress knew. She, and others in the hotel,
still remembered the sea-marriage of the young couple. The woman
identified the portrait of Mrs. Tangye as that of the gay, brisk,
young woman of fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>As for Hart, like the hotel keeper at the inland resort, she
had liked him immensely. "So gentlemanly," "such a sweet temper,"
"so romantic."</p>

<p>The description was still the same as Pointer had heard on the
Usk. Apparently Hart had no distinguishing marks of any kind
except his good tennis, and even better singing.</p>

<p>A solicitor's story came next. A solicitor in Chester where
Lady Susan lived. She had made a will years before, leaving
everything to the relatives whom she had gone to Holyhead to see
that Saturday. Mable Headly was not even mentioned in it. The
solicitor remembered a young whelp quite clearly who had come to
splutter and bluster about the will.</p>

<p>He had also a vague recollection of a pale, silent, haughty-looking wife, the great-niece of his late client, who seemed only
anxious for her husband to come away with her. The solicitor had
wondered how on earth she had come to marry him. Again Pointer
could not obtain any definite description. The solicitor proved
quite unable, as well as unwilling to identify Vardon from his
portrait, but neither could he say that the photograph might not
be that of the man he had only seen once.</p>

<p>Pointer devoted himself to Hart's surroundings. With great
difficulty he unearthed some one who remembered Hart in Newport.
Hart at that time was an auctioneer's assistant.</p>

<p>This was just before his holiday in Bettws-y-coed. Pointer's
informant told him with a chuckle that Hart always saved up, and
took a holiday "regardless," hoping to meet some wealthy girl, or
widow, preferably the latter. "Not so long to wait," added his
one-time friend, "at least, that's what he used to say."</p>

<p>Here, too, the portrait of Vardon, a good one, was not of much
use. One moment, like the hotel manageress, the man did not think
it possible for Hart to have changed his appearance so
completely, but the next he weakened, and murmured that fifteen
years would make a difference.</p>

<p>Apart from identification, the sordid tale so far was clear
enough. Hart, at that time the young auctioneer's clerk, just
then out of a job, had cajoled what he doubtless mistook for a
wealthy girl of the upper classes into a hurried marriage with
him. It was easy to picture his disgust when he found himself
instead of better off, saddled with a girl without a penny.
Pointer too imagined her desperate efforts to right things. He
thought that the woman whom he had only seen lying, as he
believed, murdered, would have put up a good fight to make and
keep a home.</p>

<p>This acquaintance of Hart's had no idea where Mr. and Mrs.
Hart lived. The shop of which Hart claimed to be, and probably
was, the manager, was the kind known as a lockup. The man had
never met Mrs. Hart except in the shop, where, according to him,
she was a live wire wasted. Hart had a way of shutting himself up
for hours&mdash;drinking, the man said, and the shop, already at
the bottom of the hill when the Harts had taken it over, slid
completely out of sight. Then came, after nearly two years of
married life, the finding of the boat, the tragedy, as it was
assumed to be.</p>

<p>This was something learnt, but it left the kernel of the
riddle&mdash;to Pointer&mdash;still unexplained. From many small
things in the report of the inquest, he believed that the wife
had really gone out in that boat, but not so Hart. Yet his wife
would know that he was not in the boat. His wife would surely
have made some inquiries again later on. Especially would that be
the case, if she were of such a character as "the murdered
woman," so Pointer called her in his mind.</p>

<p>Finally Pointer got the real explanation. He got it from the
Chaplain of a Sailors' Home at Cardiff, whither his search for
Captain Todhunter, had led him. Todhunter was the master mariner
who had married Irving Hart and Mable Headly in that swift
fashion, nearly fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>Drunk when in charge of his old tub some four years later, he
had lost her. And with his boat, lost his own means of
livelihood. He had died in the Home about two years ago.</p>

<p>Before he died, he had made a statement on oath which was duly
taken down and witnessed. It was still in the Chaplain's care. By
it, Captain Todhunter revoked a statement which he and his mate
had made to Mrs. Hart two years after her marriage to Hart. It
seemed that the husband had tired of the tie and had arranged
"for a consideration" with the needy captain to come and make a
so-called confession to his wife. The confession being that the
ship was <i>within</i> the statutory three-mile limit, not
outside it when the marriage was solemnised, and that, therefore,
Mable Headly and Irving Hart were not, and never had been,
married. The captain said that the young woman had taken it
quietly enough.</p>

<p>She had made inquiries, but as his mate stood in with the
captain, these had only confirmed Todhunter's story. Miss Headly
had not noticed the name of a ship off for Pernambuco, which had
sighted them, and signalled them a message to take back to the
owners in Cardiff just before the ceremony, which she was now
told was worthless. Had she done so, she could have proved, as
Pointer now did, that over four nautical miles, not three,
separated them from the nearest shore. She had finally, after her
interview with the mate, accepted the "confession" as genuine.
And on the next day, had come the news of the fatal accident to
both plotter, and plotted against.</p>

<p>All the parties were dead, said the Chaplain. There were no
children. There seemed to be no living relatives. So, after
communicating the paper to the Chief Constable the Chaplain had
kept the matter to himself.</p>

<p>As to the accident to Mrs. Tangye, the only other name given
in the papers had been that of her previous marriage. Headly had
not been mentioned.</p>

<p>Captain Todhunter had always kept his log books, and Pointer
verified the place of the marriage by them, and by the log of the
signalling ship whose first mate, through his glasses, had seen
the marriage actually performed, and would have signalled his
good wishes to the young couple but for lack of time, and trouble
with the crew.</p>

<p>Pointer further learned that his owners had received a letter
only a little over a week ago on the matter. A letter signed M.
H., and dated that last Sunday of Mrs. Tangye's life. It was in
her writing, without any attempt at alteration, and was to the
effect that the writer enclosed a five-pound note to pay for
immediate inquiries to be made as to a ship which was off Colwyn
Bay on a date fifteen years ago and at a given hour. The date and
the hour of the marriage of Hart and Mable Headly. Had any such
ship signalled to a little steamer called the <i>Sea-foam?</i>
The writer wanted to know whether the latter, the ship sighted,
was within three miles from land or not. A great deal hung on the
fact the letter added, and requested that the reply be sent with
all possible speed to the initials at the foot, Paddington Post
office. To be called for. Something in the note, more than the
money, had hurried up the inquiry which was only a matter of a
couple of hours.</p>

<p>On Monday night a reply had been posted as directed, giving
the exact description of the <i>Sea-foam,</i> stating that the
present captain, the then first officer of the passing steamer,
had seen a marriage ceremony performed aboard her, beside a
little garlanded rail. That the Captain's testimony, and the log
book from which the information was taken, were open to
inspection and verification at all times. The readers of the note
had guessed M. H.'s reason for writing.</p>

<p>"Run to earth at last," Pointer said to himself. He meant the
interpretation&mdash;the making clear, of Mrs. Tangye's last
days, and at least some, if not all, of the motive for the
murder. Mable Hart had either staged that boat accident, or had
had a genuine one.</p>

<p>In either case, she had decided to cut the complicated hateful
string that her life had become. Hart had probably believed that
she had killed herself intentionally; but the thought had aroused
no pity in him. Only suggested the idea of escaping himself by
bribing the beach loafer to say that he had seen both husband and
wife set sail in the ill-fated boat.</p>

<p>At any rate, Hart had doubtless believed her drowned, and
continued in that belief. Until when?</p>

<p>If he were Vardon, until his cousin married Mable Headly. If
he were not Vardon, then until they met at the orchid-show. If he
were not Vardon, that meeting might well have been fortuitous. In
either case, what followed would, Pointer thought, have run on
similar lines. Hart had played a bold game. He had probably told
the woman who considered herself Mrs. Tangye that, though he had
snatched at the fact that by some strange mistake he was believed
to have been drowned, and though he fully believed in her own
death in that storm, yet he had never rested till he had sifted
the matter of their marriage, and proved it to be genuine.
Todhunter, Hart would claim, had been actuated by hopes of
blackmail. Hart had then given Mrs. Tangye the name and address
of the owners of the ship that had passed them during these
fateful hours fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>He had evidently used every art to soften a woman's heart. And
Mrs. Tangye? Remembering that tendency of hers to gild the past
at the expense of the present, Pointer could see how she could
have been beguiled by this apparently repentant man, who after
all, would hold a place in her heart that no other man could ever
fill. And who is not touched by the thought of fidelity? If Hart
had told her of unhappy years of regret and remorse, of vain
longings to have the past over again...</p>

<p>Pointer walked his hotel room back and forwards. Every one of
Mrs. Tangye's actions was explained by this completed story. Her
agitation when she saw Hart. Her slipping away from Miss Eden to
talk to him, her silence on the way to the station and the train
up to town. Her prostration on her arrival at the house which she
had considered hitherto her home. Her letter to Miss Eden showing
that she had decided on at least the outlines of her flight even
then. Though still, Pointer was by no means sure that Mrs. Tangye
had decided to go with Hart.</p>

<p>On Monday came her preparations for the secret meeting in the
early afternoon before Tangye should return, a meeting arranged
at Tunbridge. During that talk, the man who was certainly
planning her murder even as he sat looking about him, thinking of
this, rejecting that, had won her trust completely.</p>

<p>He and she had mapped out exactly what each was to do, so at
least Mrs. Tangye would imagine, little dreaming of just what
terrible decision was being worked out in the heart of the man
who seemed so touchingly anxious to start life afresh with
her.</p>

<p>Then came the return of Tangye, the forced quarrel to ensure
his going up to town, and to give her a pretext for leaving him,
ostensibly an outraged wife. Apart from any quarrel, it was easy
to understand that Mrs. Tangye would refuse the loan of money to
Tangye from funds in which she believed that she, and therefore
far less he, had no real rights. As to what would have come
afterwards, Pointer could only guess, nor did it matter. On the
whole he believed that Mrs. Tangye would have gone abroad. At any
rate this Monday, she had written for her old will restoring
Branscombe's money to Cecil Branscombe's heir.</p>

<p>That will! If Hart were Vardon, it, and the gift of the
fifteen hundred pounds took on another light. In that case, it
was a bad blunder.</p>

<p>Inevitable, perhaps, under the pressure of lack of funds.
Pointer followed that thought all through its ramifications. If
Hart were Vardon, then all his story of the gift of the money in
his rooms, of the talk there was false. Nothing bore out his
statement. But neither did any known facts contradict it.</p>

<p>But how about the will if Hart were <i>not</i> Vardon?</p>

<p>In that case it would be enormously to his interest not to
have Mrs. Tangye die intestate, with always the possibility of
her first marriage, her only legal marriage, cropping out.</p>

<p>Pointer imagined that Hart would have very much pressed the
point about the will. It would create an atmosphere of
disinterestedness on his side&mdash;supposing he were not Vardon.
In the latter case it would have taken careful handling. But then
the whole affair had been handled carefully.</p>

<p>At any rate, because of Hart's pressure, Mrs. Tangye had
hurried out at once after his visit on Monday, bought the will
form, and made her will. Pointer thought that looked as though
she expected to be very busy, perhaps to be away on a journey,
and was afraid of it slipping her memory. As to the notice of
withdrawal of funds from Tangye's firm; Mrs. Tanyge might have
been going to use it, or some of it, for herself. She could have
justified the keeping back, at least temporarily, for her own use
of a part of Clive Branscombe's money, by the certainty that if
the dead man had known the facts, he would not have wished her to
stand penniless in the world.</p>

<p>The rest of her actions on Monday, the Chief Inspector
thought, was Mrs. Tangye's own doing.</p>

<p>On Tuesday she had dealt with her private papers, and
requested Miss Saunders to be ready to leave Riverview that
evening. Not in anger, nor from jealousy had this last been done,
but merely as part of her plan.</p>

<p>But who was Hart? Hart, the murderer. Hart, who had been in
such a hurry to wipe out the existence of the woman whose one
crime was that she had listened to him that summer morning in
Wales?</p>

<p>Pointer could find no portrait of the man; though he brought
all his ingenuity to bear on the task of unearthing one. But he
got the promise of the choirmaster who had trained Hart's voice
that he would come to town immediately he should be summoned, to
"take a look at some faces," among which Pointer intended to take
care that Vardon's should be present. That young man was expected
to return from Sweden to-morrow, and to be held up for two days
in town before his boat sailed for South America. One thing was
certain, Hart was not Tangye. Apart from crass improbability,
Hart was fairish, Tangye was very dark. Fifteen years ago, Tangye
was at Oxford and had just won his Blue. But was there some
collusion? In detective work things are so rarely what they seem.
True, by the discovery of a still living first husband, Tangye
lost all claim to any money left by Branscombe, but, according to
Hyam's latest confidential note, Tangye was to-day a very wealthy
man. His gamble in cotton had turned out a magnificent success.
He could well afford&mdash;now&mdash;to lose his late wife's
capital.</p>

<p>There was always that key-ring, linking Tangye, and Miss
Saunders, and Vardon.</p>

<p>And there was the belief expressed by Wilmot that supposing
there were a crime here, then Tangye would be found in some way
implicated. Pointer thought of the great crime-specialist's words
more than once as he took the train back to town, every nerve
tingling, as it would with him, when the end of a hard case was
in sight.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>

<p class="first">
WILMOT and Haviland met Pointer at the London Terminus. The
Chief Inspector took them on with him to New Scotland Yard, where
he told the tale to them and the Assistant Commissioner at the
same time. Captain Pelham punctuated the telling with a few
shrewd questions. When it was over he glanced at Wilmot.</p>

<p>"You and I will find it difficult to keep our feet, Wilmot,
against this."</p>

<p>Wilmot refused to consider that all was lost.</p>

<p>"Though I grant you, Pointer, that your theory's wonderfully
improved from the puny shade it was when you showed it last. But,
as I see it, it immeasurably strengthens the idea of suicide.
Immeasurably. Suppose every fact to be right, except the end.
Have Mrs. Tangye hate&mdash;as she would, depend on it&mdash;the
very thought of Hart! Just imagine her situation, her truly
terrible situation. She's not married to Tangye. She never was
married to Branscombe. She loathes her real husband. If she tells
the world the truth, she places herself in a most pitiful
position.</p>

<p>"Even if she takes Tangye into her confidence, she knows him
well enough to feel sure that he won't be able to keep it to
himself. He will be free to marry Mrs. Bligh, or possibly Miss
Eden. Poor Mrs. Tangye! A wife and yet not a wife! Rather than
face a life in hiding, a life of perpetual humiliation, of never-dying gossip, she picks up that revolver...No wonder she fired it
with the left hand! I don't see any need for a Hart in the final
scene. I only see a broken heart. An agonised, tormented
soul!"</p>

<p>Wilmot's voice had a ring of deep feeling in it for once. "And
I see Vardon," murmured Haviland, "though I see what you mean
too, Mr. Wilmot. As a matter of fact, for the poor lady, it was
just as well it all ended when it did."</p>

<p>"I still see no certain crime here," Wilmot spoke with a touch
of reluctance that marked something approaching conversion in his
attitude, "not yet. Though I confess, I'm a bit shaken&mdash;just
a bit, by that legacy.</p>

<p>"Should it be a crime here, then I feel sure it will still
turn out to be a Tangye-Saunders affair. You say Tangye wasn't
Hart. Granted. But I say that the murderer&mdash;if he
exists&mdash;doesn't need to be Hart either. What about Tangye in
a disguise? What about Philpotts even? What about that cousin
whose death we assume, but can't prove, therefore, can't be
certain of? What about Miss Saunders slipping in through those
open windows? What about Miss Eden even...When you've had Vardon
quite definitely <i>not</i> identified as Hart, perhaps you'll
come over to my way of thinking."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall," Pointer said thoughtfully, as he went to
an inner office. "But Tangye will still be available, if wanted.
And so will the rest of your rather sweeping list." Wilmot
elaborated to his theory of some more subtle combinations of the
Riverview persons.</p>

<p>Pelham listened, but only half in agreement.</p>

<p>"You may be right, that's what I've maintained myself up till
now. But you know&mdash;well, Pointer is Pointer!" Mayor Pelham
finished with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, but he's not God-Almighty! I don't deny that this story
needs very careful weighing," Wilmot went on, "I don't pretend
that it doesn't alter some things. But, don't forget that it
opens the door to blackmail. Suppose some one else had stumbled
on it, too?"</p>

<p>"Vardon?" Haviland asked again, almost in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>Pointer entered: "I wired to the man who's shadowing Vardon to
keep watch night and day, and above all make a note of every one
who speaks to his charge."</p>

<p>"He'll find it difficult to give us the slip with Inspector
Watts on his heels," Haviland muttered in gratified tones.</p>

<p>"You think Vardon is in danger?" put in the quicker-witted
newspaper man.</p>

<p>"If he's not Hart, we do," Pelham answered very seriously, "in
that case, if Hart can do away with Vardon in some manner that
prevents definite identification of the body&mdash;why, he'll
think that he's hung up the case indefinitely."</p>

<p>"Then he doesn't know Pointer," Wilmot turned to the Chief
Inspector in mock despair. "What's a body more or less to you?
You'd merely think out some fresh tale of mystery, and sail on,
with or without the corpse.</p>

<p>"No, no!" Wilmot made a gesture with his cigarette suggestive
of dispersing smoke, or a crowd of tiny gnats, from in front of
his eyes, "you postulate a murderer who not only left no trace of
his presence at the scene of his supposed crime, but has given us
no sign of life throughout the investigation. No effort has been
made to mislead us. There has been no stir in the underwood of
the case to mark the passage of a secret criminal, and we've all
been listening attentively. I can't think Vardon, or any other
man, would have such iron nerve."</p>

<p>"The thing I'm afraid of," Pointer spoke very gravely, a
little uneasily, "is that there may be still another murder.
However, the only witness I found in Wales, who could identify
Hart&mdash;possibly&mdash;is spending a couple of days in a
nursing-home."</p>

<p>"Eh?" asked Pelham.</p>

<p>"I really hadn't the face to ask for any more men, sir. So I
suggested a quiet retreat to him. It's only a matter of two or
three days, and free of charge. I told him that he might get
sandbagged outside. That idea made him skip under shelter like a
lamb. The doctor's in the secret, but all the rest, even the
Matron, think it's suicidal mania. He's never left alone, allowed
no visitors, watched day and night, and the staff are laying
themselves out to amuse him. His only complaint will be that the
food is all cut up, and that he won't be allowed to shave
himself, but that's not much. Once Vardon's ship is back from
Sweden, it's due to-morrow, he'll be escorted up to town and
taken over by us like royalty. I think we've done our best to
safeguard him, as we have Vardon..."</p>

<p>"I hope we shan't slip up on the question of identification,"
Pelham said, "it's absolutely vital here. If <i>only</i> we had
been able to lay our hands on a photograph of this Hart!"</p>

<p>"As far as I could find out, he never had one taken," Pointer
was not pleased with that fact.</p>

<p>"I can't see how you can doubt that Vardon's the murderer,"
Haviland said firmly, "it all seems of a piece. In fact, it's
like one of these prehistoric monsters you hear of, where first
you find a footprint&mdash;heard a pair of them in this
case&mdash;and then you get a bit of a bone. Then comes along the
spine, and finally you wind up with the skull, and there you
are."</p>

<p>"Ah," Pointer said good-humouredly, "the great thing is not to
link up one beast's snout with another creature's tail. It
doesn't matter in a museum case, but it might in one of
ours."</p>

<p>And with that small joke the men separated. Wilmot and
Haviland going on with Pointer to see Tangye.</p>

<p>Pointer had sent the stockbroker a telegram before starting up
to town.</p>

<p>It was a very jaded looking man who glanced up at the two tall
figures, one in uniform, one in tweeds, as followed by Wilmot
they were shown into his den by a servant who they knew, and
Tangye knew, was a butler detective.</p>

<p>"Well?" Tangye said tersely, rather white about his tightening
lips.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," Pointer took a chair unasked. "We haven't the man
who murdered Mrs. Tangye but information has come to hand which
tends to let you out. As you've seemed to feel yourself an object
of suspicion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Seemed to feel!" Tangye flashed back, unlocking a tantalus
and pouring out some whisky for himself which he merely waved
beneath the siphon as a matter of form. He did not ask any of the
three to drink with him. He had not forgotten the day when
Pointer had refused. Nor a later day when even Wilmot had made
some excuse. "We've thought it the right thing to come and tell
you that much. Naturally we'd like you to keep it to yourself for
the present."</p>

<p>Pointer laid little stress on this last point. He thought it
most unlikely that his researches into Hart's past were not known
to the murderer.</p>

<p>"But I think you ought to be frank with us. Tell us the truth
of the tangle that you've got yourself into."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" Tangye wheeled around. "You expect a full confession
of the crime perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No," Pointer said equably, "we merely would like your own
account of why you gave Miss Saunders that promise to marry her.
Why you went to Vardon's rooms on the Tuesday your wife was found
dead. Why you returned to Riverview about five on the same
Tuesday afternoon. Of course, we have a tolerably complete idea
of what happened, but if you could explain the various points
satisfactorily, we would not expect to mention them at the trial.
Nor to question Messrs. Merchant of Nottingham about the notes
they received Wednesday morning. Notes known to have been in your
late wife's possession yet posted by you before the police left
the house Tuesday afternoon."</p>

<p>Tangye's teeth met with a click. He was very pale. He eyed the
Chief Inspector as though sizing him up. Wilmot bent forward.</p>

<p>"I should like to relieve you of my presence," he said
earnestly, "but as I understand that the police maintain the idea
of murder, my Company would expect me to be present."</p>

<p>"One more or less&mdash;" Tangye said, not over civilly. "Do I
understand that, unless wanted, my statement will be kept
private?"</p>

<p>Pointer explained that that was what he hoped, though he could
not give an absolute promise.</p>

<p>Tangye had another drink.</p>

<p>"You seem to know an amazing lot already," he said
grudgingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, like most people, we know a good deal more than we say,"
Pointer agreed pleasantly.</p>

<p>Tangye looked him over with a most unloving eye.</p>

<p>"Well, here goes! Mrs. Tangye and I had a quarrel on Monday
afternoon. It was started by her. It entirely concerned her
having caught sight of another lady and me at Tunbridge orchid-show. I told you that much. Only the lady was not Miss Saunders.
Her name doesn't matter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment. You mean Miss Eden?" Pointer nodded his head as
though this much he knew already.</p>

<p>Tangye's cheeks flamed.</p>

<p>"I mean nothing of the kind. Do you mean to tell me that
you're dragging even Miss Eden's name into this unsavoury mess? A
woman who's an angel of goodness and innocence? A girl
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, we know that she was there. And that she talked to you.
At the orchid-show." Pointer said urbanely.</p>

<p>"The lady I was with was Mrs. Bligh," Tangye snapped out. "Her
address is&mdash;" he gave it. "And now I trust that information
has laid those monstrous suspicions of yours about another
person."</p>

<p>"It has," Pointer assured him, "but you see, sir, half an
explanation is no good to us, and only tends to drag in innocent
people."</p>

<p>Tangye gulped.</p>

<p>"All that I told you about Mrs. Tangye's manner take as
repeated," he said after a moment. "Everything was exactly as I
told you, except that Miss Saunders' name was never mentioned. I
stayed on&mdash;" he hesitated, "I stayed on to tea," he
repeated. After a pause he began again, "Well, I stayed on
because there was something I wanted to speak about. Something I
wanted to say." Again he stopped.</p>

<p>"We know about that Irish firm having let you down," Pointer
put in. The going was very hard for Tangye just here evidently.
"We know that on Monday at noon Mr. O'Malley sent you a wire in
code to say that he couldn't meet his liabilities and was off for
abroad. We know that no blame whatever attaches to your firm for
the position in which it found itself."</p>

<p>"Ah, you know that?" this time Tangye looked relieved, "Well,
you've guessed why I stayed on. I had come back home intending to
ask my wife to help me out. A damned unpleasant errand. And you
can imagine my feelings when the interview started in as it did.
But I thought I might talk her into a better temper. She was
quick-tempered, but placable&mdash;as a rule. I found her
adamant. I didn't even mention money. It was impossible. And yet
I needed it as I've never needed it before in my life. I went
back to town, and on Tuesday morning tried to see if I could
raise some. But credit in the city is an odd thing. The whisper
of O'Malley's difficulties had got about, and no bank would lend.
It would have been suicide to borrow privately. My liabilities,
since Dublin had let me in, were too high. Now my insurance
papers were in my desk at home. I could raise something on them.
My wife's policy was there too. In her own writing-table. I
decided to raise money on mine, and if I could manage it, on my
wife's as well. I paid the premiums on both.</p>

<p>"I drove home without any thought of slipping away unnoticed,
but as it happened the commissionaire was busy with a messenger
boy as I came out of the alley and never saw me. I decided to
leave the car at a turning near Riverview, and let myself into
the house quietly. I had no desire to meet Mrs. Tangye...I got
the documents I wanted. Then I remembered my wife's insurance
papers. She kept them in the safe. I ran upstairs, made sure that
no one was in our bed-room, and tried the knob. But for once the
safe was locked. I went downstairs again. There was no sound in
the morning-room. Mrs. Tangye might be out. I slipped into the
garden through a side door in my study. Going around to the
morning-room, I saw that no light was lit, and that one of the
windows was ajar. I felt sure from that that Mrs. Tangye was out.
So, switching on the lamp by her desk. I opened it. It was
unlocked. The keys were lying on top. The desk was empty except
that in the pigeon-hole where she usually kept her policy, was a
small pile of account books and papers neatly tied together. Just
as I caught sight of one end of the paper I was after, I heard a
sound outside the door. I thought it was Mrs. Tangye, and
snatching up the packet, I slipped out into the garden again. It
was, of course, Miss Saunders who opened the door as I left by
the window. She watched me go." Tangye's hand shook as he lit a
cigar.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about it that my wife must have been sitting
dead in that alcove all the time. Florence says she didn't leave
the room after four she thinks. It's a horrible thought, but I
think it's a true one."</p>

<p>"I think so, too," Pointer agreed soberly. "What did you do
then?"</p>

<p>"I slipped out by the tradesmen's gate, and into my car which
I'd left at the first turning. Drove to the city and raised in
five minutes a little money, though nothing like what I needed.
But I had made up my mind what I was going to do with it. I have
an acquaintance&mdash;Merchant of Merchant Bros., as you seem to
know. He's in cotton. We had talked things over on Saturday in
Norfolk. He had urged me for once to come in on a speculation.
The biggest thing of the last fifty years he called it, and
rightly. A few fivers margined at the beginning of this cotton
boom might mean thousands at the end. It has. I got the loan,
telephoned to Manchester and posted him the cheque. Then I got my
car out, took my wife's books back with me, and drove home
intending to make things up with her. When I got to Riverview the
Superintendent was here, and I was told that Mrs. Tangye was
dead.</p>

<p>"The moment you, Superintendent, went upstairs to look over
the bedroom, Miss Saunders came into my den." Tangye paused and
shot out his lower lip. "She had an envelope in her hands with
fifteen hundred pounds in it in bank notes. In a whisper she told
me that she had found this envelope lying in Mrs. Tangye's safe.
I knew my wife had just sold a farm. I had no idea for how much.
There was still time to post the money to Manchester. I thanked
her, and decided to pass over her having unlocked the safe
without authority. Slipped out of the house and round to the post
office. There I telephoned to Merchant's son in the City. He
passed my message on to his father, and I posted the notes. On
that I returned to the house, to find Miss Saunders sitting here
waiting for me. The police had gone. She sat in the chair you're
in now, Superintendent." Tangye fixed a meditative eye on the
piece of furniture in question.</p>

<p>"It certainly was an unexpected interview. Miss Saunders
accused me of shooting my wife. In a way it makes it infinitely
more ghastly that I believe she really and truly believes I did
fire that shot. Though how she thinks Mrs. Tangye would let
herself be picked off like a half-frozen bee! All that stuff she
told you was, of course, invention on her part, but I think she
believes I murdered Mrs. Tangye, and then lost my head, and left
the notes behind me. Well, I saw pretty quickly what a position I
was in. I'm bound to say she helped me to see it. There were the
insurance policies on which I had raised money. There was the
fifteen hundred which I had just posted; by the six-thirty post,
too! There was my presence at Riverview&mdash;I had no idea then
that I hadn't been seen leaving my office. That was pure luck.
There was the visit on Sunday to the orchid-show with a lady.
There was the quarrel on Monday! It made an ugly story. Miss
Saunders didn't slur anything over. She told me that she had
cleaned up all marks of my coming in to the morning-room, and
closed the windows which I had left, as I found them open. Miss
Saunders made me an offer. To back up any story I should tell. To
substitute her name for that of the lady who really was with me
on Sunday, if I would marry her&mdash;Miss Saunders and give her
the promise in writing; at once.</p>

<p>"Otherwise she intended to denounce me. She told me that she
would say that she had seen me actually with the pistol in my
hand. I'm bound to say she put the wind up me all right. The more
I thought it over, the worse it looked. I couldn't make up my
mind what to do. Marry that octopus! Penal servitude didn't seem
much better, barring of course the disgrace. Then there flashed
into my mind a bottle of vanishing ink I'd seen in Vardon's rooms
only a fortnight before. It looked just like the regular stuff,
only it wouldn't last a fortnight. He had won it on shipboard as
a booby prize, he told me. It's common stuff in every South
American stationer's."</p>

<p>Pointer thought of his wasted efforts.</p>

<p>"I 'phoned up to find if he was in. He wasn't. But I decided
to try for that ink all the same. It meant salvation to me.</p>

<p>"I told Miss Saunders I would pick her up just over Richmond
Bridge, and take her along to my office where my head clerk was
still busy, I told her he could be depended on not to talk, and
that I would write her a marriage promise there. I took my wife's
papers off with me again&mdash;I couldn't put them back in her
desk after the police had been over it&mdash;and drove around to
Vardon's, then I made an excuse that I must run up and tell him
of the accident. But the ink was gone. He'd given it to a friend
only a couple of days before, I've since learnt. There was no
help for it. We went on to my office. There I wrote out an
agreement which she read through and tightened up. She put it
inside her dress and went back alone to Riverview. She told me,
by the way, with that engaging frankness which is one of her most
amiable characteristics, that the paper would be kept in its
sealed envelope by her legal advisor, whoever that exalted
personage may be. This was evidently a warning that it would be
no use for me to murder her to get it back. I noticed, as
possibly you did, that she refused to spend any night at
Riverview?"</p>

<p>"We noticed it," Pointer said with a faint smile. There was a
pause.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, for being so frank. If all goes well, you'll
be able to snap your fingers at that paper. It was practically
blackmail. Now at the orchid-show did you see Mrs. Tangye?"</p>

<p>"Not I! I hadn't the shadow of an idea that she was there
until I ran into Miss Eden by chance. She told me of Mrs.
Tangye's having seen me and my companion. And of her having
looked terribly upset. I pooh-poohed the idea that she should
mind. Naturally it wasn't what I should have chosen. But a
flower-show! After all a flower-show I Second to being seen at a
picture gallery I should have thought. Miss Eden, however, warned
me that my wife was terribly upset. I didn't believe her. But I
decided it might be as well not to linger. A meeting might have
been most awkward. So the lady and I left. Next day came the
quarrel. I think that's the circle complete!"</p>

<p>Pointer thought a moment.</p>

<p>"And how did you get hold of Mrs. Tangye's keys?"</p>

<p>"Miss Saunders handed them to me. While we were in the car
driving to Vardon's. I must have been ass enough to drop them in
his rooms when I tried to open a book-case. I don't remember what
became of them, so I suppose I left them lying on his table. You
see, at the time I thought them of no importance. Then came the
discovery of that missing, or rather unentered-money. I confess I
thought that Miss Saunders had taken it, and only handed me the
half. 'Pon my word, I hoped as much. I wish to Heaven she could
be jailed, but I suppose there's no chance of that?"</p>

<p>Pointer did not enter into that pious hope. There was a little
silence.</p>

<p>"I want to say one thing more." Tangye spoke very earnestly.
"I want to say it solemnly you're making a mistake, Chief
Inspector. There's no crime here. Mrs. Tangye fired that shot
herself. That I swear."</p>

<p>"And that I believe," Wilmot said simply.</p>

<p>"Firmly?" asked Haviland.</p>

<p>"I have intervals of doubt," Wilmot confessed, "but I find
myself always swinging back to my original, and your original,
belief."</p>

<p>"You found the French windows open?" Pointer asked their
host.</p>

<p>"Ajar. Since learning of your suspicions of foul play I've
searched my mind most anxiously, and there wasn't a footprint or
any sign of disturbance as of any one else having been in the
room," Tangye said, very thoughtfully. "My wife's chair was out
of sight, back in the alcove hidden by that screen, but the other
chair was in full view. Even the cushion on it was all plump and
smooth. No sign of any one having sat in it."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Miss Saunders cleaned the door of the safe after opening it,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Trust her!"</p>

<p>"And, since we are clearing up these various details, what
became of the Lux camera you took with you to Tunbridge on
Sunday?"</p>

<p>Tangye seemed bewildered.</p>

<p>"Lux camera? Oh&mdash;h&mdash;? I left it at the orchid show.
Lost it. It was a present to the lady who was with me. I was
carrying it for her and showing her how to use it, when she
caught sight of some friends and went off to speak to them; I
stayed behind trying it on some plants. That was when Miss Eden
ran into me. I put it down beside us on the rustic bench we sat
on to talk, and forgot the damned thing. It was never wanted
again. Mrs. Bligh seemed to have lost all her interest in
photography when I saw her next, and told her that I had just
discovered what I must have done. I was thankful to be spared
making any inquiries down at the show. Naturally, after Mrs.
Tangye's death, the very name sickened me."</p>

<p>Pointer had had his own inquiries made since learning from
Mrs. Bligh's maid of the camera's disappearance. It had not been
seen. If Tangye's story was true, some one had "annexed" it.</p>

<p>"There's one other thing I wish to say," Tangye said as his
guests rose to go. "I have withdrawn all opposition to the
probating of that will that Mrs. Tangye signed the Monday before
she died."</p>

<p>"You think it's genuine?" Haviland frowned. He did not.</p>

<p>"I always held that Vardon had a right to the land. As to the
money&mdash;I have no wish to hand over the sum in question to
the lawyers. Vardon agrees to leave it in my firm. They would
not," was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>"And your wife's notice of withdrawal of her funds?" Tangye's
face darkened. "A cursed unfair and vindictive thing of her to
want to do. I <i>can't</i> understand it. Except that the poor
girl really was off her head."</p>

<p>"You knew of the notice?"</p>

<p>"Stewart gave me the note when you telephoned him for an
interview. Lest you should ask...I destroyed it."</p>

<p>Tangye still looked black. Evidently he had not forgiven his
wife for that letter. Pointer thought that its existence had gone
far to make Tangye take her death as he had done. There was a
short silence in the police car that Pointer was driving.</p>

<p>"Vardon's luck seems too good to last," Haviland spoke
crossly. "And that's a fact! First he gets the fifteen hundred
pounds handed him and no questions asked. Then a will is found on
him giving him ten thousand in cash and close on that in
land&mdash;and still no questions to be asked."</p>

<p>"It does make one wonder!"</p>

<p>"Whether he is Tangye's friend and accomplice?" mused Wilmot.
"I've never had so fascinating a problem to ponder. No murder, I
still think. Yes, in spite of the great Hart discovery. At least
I think I think so. But there certainly is an intricate shadow-dance here, which is vastly interesting."</p>

<p>"Quite apart from the rest of his story, I shouldn't wonder if
Mrs. Tangye might not have told Tangye the truth about meeting
Hart on Sunday, if it hadn't been for seeing Mrs. Bligh with him
down at Tunbridge." The Chief Inspector had been pursuing his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>"You speak as though an assumption were the same as a fact,"
Wilmot's tone had something of bewilderment in it, "you assume
Hart's still alive. Without a shred of evidence to back that
assumption you go on to imagine him as having been at Tunbridge
on Sunday, and at Riverview, Monday and Tuesday. My dear chap,
you can't expect a logical mind to assume so much. You might
equally well argue that Headly <i>pre</i> was not really dead,
and that it was him she saw, and so on..."</p>

<p>"But if Hart's Vardon, Mr. Wilmot, then he becomes a fact,"
Haviland pointed out, as he got down at his police station. He
wondered why the other two laughed.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>

<p class="first">
THE day after Pointer had searched Newport without finding a
trace of the Hart's home-circle, Barbara arrived at that bustling
town.</p>

<p>She had spent the time coming down in the train in
thought.</p>

<p>There were only two things about Mrs. Tangye which marked her
out from all the other women whom Barbara knew. Her salmon
fishing, a little. Her love of duets, very decidedly. Mrs. Tangye
had once spoken as though she had always played them, even as a
little girl.</p>

<p>W. Griffith was the name of the best music shop in Newport,
she was told at a stationer's where she inquired if such a firm
still existed.</p>

<p>Leaving Olive to paddle along the sands, and try to swim in a
foot of water, Barbara set off down Cathedral Street. How to
begin? To enter a shop and merely ask if they had ever supplied
music to a Miss Headly, might not lead far.</p>

<p>Barbara was very nervous when she finally decided on what to
say. She entered the shop, therefore, with an air of defiant
self-possession.</p>

<p>"I want to get hold of some duets that used to be popular
years ago," she told the pleasant-faced, elderly man who came
forward. "I'm a nurse;" she flushed to the brim of her hat, as
though the profession were a blot on any family "and I have a
patient," she forced herself to say, "who used to love playing
duets. I think it might help her&mdash;it's a mental
case&mdash;if she could get hold again of some of the very ones
she used to play with a friend, a Miss Headly. I should of
course, expect to pay specially for them. Have you been here
long?"</p>

<p>"We've been established here since Naseby."</p>

<p>"She lived in this part of the world, and so did her friend.
And she got some at least of her music from you."</p>

<p>"She would naturally," the man said with conscious pride.
"You'd have to go to <i>Caer</i> to get a music-seller of the
same class. If she went in for duets, you may be sure she got
them from us. Here, at this very counter."</p>

<p>Barbara slipped a "refresher" across the said counter, and
after the proper expostulation it vanished.</p>

<p>"Years ago, you think? I ought to be able to help you. My
memory's a fine one, if I do say it. And we don't have many
people asking for duets nowadays. We didn't then. I can't call to
mind any one but Mrs. Hart. Not as a regular thing."</p>

<p>Barbara was disappointed.</p>

<p>"Hart? Headly, Miss Headly was the name of my patient's
friend. It was she who used to do the music buying, I
believe."</p>

<p>Headly conveyed nothing to the shopman, and he said so.</p>

<p>"Beautiful player was Mrs. Hart," he rambled on, "knew about
music. Kept abreast of things. Loss to the whole town when that
sad accident happened. She was drowned just outside that sandbar
over there. Handsome, young lady. Carried herself like a
guardsman. Fine at salmon fishing too. I think she was good at
anything she did. And quick with her wits as with her fingers.
Looked like one of us, not like a foreigner&mdash;eh, I mean an
Englishwoman."</p>

<p>"Dark?"</p>

<p>"Dark and dashing, I might say," the man spoke
sentimentlly.</p>

<p>"And drowned?"</p>

<p>"Drowned thirteen years ago. We none of us know what's ahead
of us. I always say that if we did, half of us would go off our
heads."</p>

<p>That seemed a nice, healthy way of looking at life to Barbara.
This drowned woman could not possibly be Mrs. Tangye. Obviously.
Yet, some things fitted. General age. Love of duets. Salmon
fishing. Appearance. Could Mrs. Tangye have had a sister after
all? Or was this merely a chance resemblance?</p>

<p>Barbara listened to a long-winded account of the accident. To
her it settled the matter. Then she pricked up her ears
again.</p>

<p>"Both she and her husband had come down in the world. So he
said. I don't know about him. Though he was the sort that's bound
to sink. But it was true enough of her. She was a lady. Parson's
daughter. Had an aunt a lady of title, so he used to brag."</p>

<p>Parson's daughter? Titled aunt? But drowned?</p>

<p>"Was she left-handed, by any chance?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember. I wouldn't notice that, you see, when she
was playing."</p>

<p>Barbara got him to give her the address of a little dairy shop
above which the Hart's had lived. The salesman had often spent an
evening there. "In the beginning," he was careful to add.</p>

<p>The address in question turned out to be a small milkshop in a
backwater. It was a neat affair, with a snowy marble counter,
white new-laid eggs, jars of honey arranged in a golden pyramid,
and a shining bowl of milk with a silver cover from which to
serve customers.</p>

<p>All looked spotless. So did Mr. Pringle who was just about to
serve a dirty urchin. The boy handed over a smutty jug. Pringle
filled it casually with a funnel clean as a whistle. The surplus
of milk ran cheerfully down the dirty handle just now held by the
grimy fingers, and back into the gleaming bowl. By the time this
would have been repeated many times, Barbara wondered what the
last customer bought.</p>

<p>Courageously she asked for a glass from it, however, and sat
down to chat. She was passing through Newport, she told the man,
and wanted to learn some facts about friends of friends of hers.
Called Hart. They used to live here fourteen or so so years ago.
Could he tell her anything about them?</p>

<p>"I can, Miss," Pringle spoke with the pride of the local bard,
"they lodged here with us, being English like us. Niceish young
couple. At least she was. He wasn't worthy of her. I hopes I'm
not paining you, but if you know about him&mdash;why, you do!
They was drowned in a terrible squall&mdash;as I suppose you've
heard?"</p>

<p>Barbara said she had.</p>

<p>"It was very terrible," she added, "I believe she was quite
young, and a very handsome girl."</p>

<p>"Very handsome. As to young&mdash;she would be only about
twenty I suppose."</p>

<p>"Were they&mdash;was she married here in Newport?" Barbara did
not know what to ask. Clearly the drowned Mrs. Hart could not be
the alive and later married Miss Headly. But yet...</p>

<p>"No, miss. They was married before they came. Only just
married, and already unhappy. Incompatibles, that was what they
were. And you can't expect two things that don't go together, to
go together," Mr. Pringle said wisely. "Milk and vinegar now.
It's no use saying prayers over milk and vinegar. They're bound
to part sooner or later. Because people are joined in church
don't make 'em one. My wife she don't hold with me, but I goes by
what I sees. Not by what I hears."</p>

<p>"What was Mr. Hart like?"</p>

<p>"Black-tempered man. Dark blight was his way when things went
wrong. Didn't speak out, only had a look in his eyes and a pinch
of his lips that meant bitter words when they should be alone
together. Some said he drank. He was always out of the shop and
upstairs locked in his little room. I don't say she never brought
trouble on herself. She had a high spirit. And quick with her
tongue too. But the poor girl hadn't a dog's chance with him. Not
a. dog's chance. My wife she liked Hart. But I was sorry for
her."</p>

<p>"I suppose she was the Mable Hart my friends knew? Was her
name Headly before her marriage?"</p>

<p>"Her first name was Mable. We didn't know her family name.
Never learnt it. She&mdash;well&mdash;she didn't dare trust
herself to talk of her home. That's how it struck me. But there
couldn't have been two Mable Harts living in Newport, and both
drown the same night. Could there, miss?"</p>

<p>Barbara agreed. She thought the existence of one quite enough
of an enigma.</p>

<p>"Irving Hart was his name. Some relation to Lord Irving, he
told us. But I noticed she never said no such stuff." Barbara
wished that she had been prepared for this interview, and the one
before it at the music-shop. She was fearful of blundering. Her
mind in a whirl. She drew out a photograph of Mrs. Tangye.</p>

<p>"This is a cousin of Mrs. Hart's. She's very like the one you
used to know, I believe. I'm going to leave the photograph to be
enlarged at a shop near here, that's how I have it by me."</p>

<p>Barbara felt that she was growing into a frightful liar. And
possibly&mdash;probably&mdash;no, certainly, all to no good.</p>

<p>"Like Mrs. Hart?" the man sniffed. "Why, this one might be
t'other's mother." He checked himself and looked more carefully
at it. "Of course, fifteen years&mdash;But Mrs. Hart was a
slender, tall slip of a girl...Still, of course, fifteen years
Mother!" he called to the rear of the shop. Mrs. Pringle appeared
and looked curiously at the portrait.</p>

<p>"Why it's the very spit of Mrs. Hart I As she would be if
she'd lived till now, poor soul. When they was both young girls,
she must have been as like our Mrs. Hart as one pea's like
another. I say 'our Mrs. Hart' but I ought to say your Mrs.
Hart." She turned to her husband. "You always had a soft spot in
your heart for her, Tom. I was sorrier for her husband. Nasty
temper she had, when she thought things weren't as they should
be. Oh, yes, she had, Tom. And just being drowned doesn't turn
her into an angel. Or what's the use of having to go to church
and keep oneself respectable here, if that's all there is to it?
Not that we ever saw her at her best, poor dear." The woman's
face softened as she handed the photograph of "the cousin" back
to Barbara. "Things went from bad to worse with them. Her money
too, it was. Born to better things she was, as her underwear
showed clearly. A parson's daughter she was, and though Tom and I
are Wesleyans, we're broad-minded. And played the piano something
beautiful. She kept her piano as long as she could. Used to play
duets with her husband at first. He could play as well as he
could sing."</p>

<p>"Was <i>he</i> a parson's son?" Barbara asked by way of
reaching this mysterious husband of the mysterious, inexplicable
Mrs. Hart.</p>

<p>"Not much!" came from Pringle. "Common! No class at all!"</p>

<p>"You're all wrong, Tom," Mrs. Pringle was indignant "I don't
say as he behaved right. I mean about money-matters, but he was a
gentleman&mdash;or better!" Mrs. Pringle lowered her voice
mysteriously, "I think he was something better still. You don't
seem to know about him, miss?"</p>

<p>Barbara said that her friends had only known Mrs. Hart before
her marriage and knew nothing whatever of the husband.</p>

<p><i>"I</i> think he didn't dare ask his father for help," Mrs.
Pringle went on.</p>

<p>Pringle's sniff said what he thought.</p>

<p>"Poor thing! She did scrape, and save, and pinch," Mrs.
Pringle spoke with real pity now. "And then to get drowned, both
of 'em, like rats in a trap! It do seem hard! What might her name
have been before she married, miss?"</p>

<p>"Headly. Mable Headly."</p>

<p>"There now! I said to Tom all her things was marked M. H.,
though I was sure they was older than her marriage. Changed her
name and not her letter. Unlucky, isn't it, miss."</p>

<p>Again Barbara agreed. Still all at sea. Still half dazed as to
where Mrs. Hart ended, and Mrs. Tangye began. They must be one.
But how could they be? Why should they be?</p>

<p>"Have you a portrait of him? I should like to see one,"
Barbara asked after a little pause during which she sipped her
milk.</p>

<p>"There now! If you'd only come last week, miss. My brother'd
have shown you a fine one. Taking a family group of Tom and me
and our daughter Nest we was, one day on the front step, when the
door behind us opened, and Mr. Hart walked right into the middle
of us. Just as we was all looking pleasant, and my brother was
pressing the bulb. So he got took too and never knew it. The
trouble came just then."</p>

<p>"Owed everybody right and left." Pringle explained. "We'd
never have been paid up, neither, if it hadn't been for Mrs.
Hart. The very last thing she did, miss, was to settle for
everything. Paid it the evening of the storm. Just before she
hurried down to the cove. And when I seed her little watch with
the pearls around it hanging in Jones' window, I knew where she
got the money from."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, Tom!" broke in Mrs. Pringle in great distress. "I
can't abide to hear you tell that. She loved that watch. Present
from her auntie, she once let slip. I'm sure we wouldn't have
cared if she'd let things run on a bit longer."</p>

<p>"They couldn't have run on, mother; not much longer. What
would Mrs. Hart have done then? She'd have died of it."</p>

<p>"I wish I could see that photograph of Mr. Hart," Barbara said
finally.</p>

<p>"I'll write and ask my brother to send me a copy. If you're
staying on here, and like to drop in some time next week..."</p>

<p>Barbara said that would be very kind, and promptly asked Mr.
and Mrs. Pringle to come to the theatre with her that night.</p>

<p>On her return from the play, Barbara got little sleep. Yet the
whole story as she saw it, was simple. Mrs. Tangye had escaped
from the storm which had drowned her husband, and had taken up
life again as Miss Headly. Doubtless Mr. Branscombe and Mr.
Tangye knew the truth. Barbara's interest in Hart was merely
curiosity and a vague hope that the Chief Inspector might be able
to make some use of the fact of his existence. She had not learnt
anything that mattered, so she thought.</p>

<p>She even felt very ashamed of having listened to so much
gossip. After all, whether Mrs. Tangye had been married twice, or
three times, could only concern herself and her own circle.</p>

<p>Barbara found it impossible next day to learn more of the
Harts. The only people she could hear of who had known the young
couple remained the Pringles, and the salesman at the music-shop.
It had not been worth coming for. Hart's picture, she would, of
course, hand on at once to Pointer, but what good would that do?
When two more days passed with no result, she decided not even to
wait for it, though Mrs. Pringle had asked her brother to print
Barbara an enlargement of his copy, and had promised to send it
to her hotel on this, the third day. Saddened, bitterly
disappointed, she and Olive returned to town. She decided,
however, on the way up to tell at once what she had learnt, and
what she had failed to learn, to the man in charge of the
investigations. She was surprised to find how much reliance she
placed on Pointer. Though she remained a little afraid of him
since that interview in her grandfather's office. But she felt
sure that he would never let the truth down. And she
must&mdash;she must learn the truth! The sooner her tale was told
the Chief Inspector the sooner she could tackle some other point
in Mrs. Tangye's life. Some point which would perhaps yield
something worth learning.</p>

<p>Her grandfather was down in the country, as he called
Wimbledon, drawing up an old lady's monthly will. Pointer was not
at New Scotland Yard she was told in reply to a telephoned
inquiry. As a matter of fact, Pointer was just then on his way to
meet Vardon's train, and conduct him to the buffet where the
choirmaster from Newport sat drinking endless cups of coffee out
of his own thermos flask, and within arms' length of three
waitresses who had been duly propitiated.</p>

<p>She tried for Haviland. Haviland was not in his police
station. But she finally found Wilmot in. He told her that he
would be pleased to either see her at his flat, or meet her
anywhere she wished.</p>

<p>Barbara chose his rooms, and hustling Olive into a taxi drove
to them.</p>

<p>She ran up the stairs, and was hardly in Wilmot's spacious,
beautifully reticent rooms, before she poured out what she had
found and what she so tremendously regretted not having found in
Wales.</p>

<p>Wilmot listened with breathless interest.</p>

<p>"You've done splendidly!" he told her warmly. Somewhat to her
surprise. "And the photograph?" Even he looked keenly interested
as he held out his hand.</p>

<p>"It's to be posted on to me from the hotel. I left my address.
It'll be here to-night, or to-morrow morning." She branched off
to again ask whether that first marriage would in any way help to
orient the inquiry into the dead woman's past.</p>

<p>But Wilmot considered the portrait the greatest stride which
the case had yet made towards a solution.</p>

<p>"We must get into touch with the Chief Inspector," he reached
for his telephone under a beautiful old lacquer bell. Barbara
told him that she had asked in vain for Pointer at Scotland Yard
or at his own home. None the less Wilmot tried his luck too.</p>

<p>"Out. They don't know when he'll be back. This <i>is</i>
awkward!"</p>

<p>He stood with pursed lips. What steps ought he to take? How to
act quickly and yet most efficaciously? He did not want Pointer
to come upon some ill-considered, hastily carried out decision.
Wilmot prided himself on always making the best possible use of
any information which he received.</p>

<p>"The Assistant Commissioner has just rung me up to ask if by
chance he were here. It seems that the Yard have traced a Hart, a
brother of Irving Hart's. He seems to be a sort of secretary, or
assistant to a Professor Orison. I don't know if you've ever
heard the name?"</p>

<p>"Professor Orison? Oh yes. I heard a lecture of his once, in
what I suppose he called English. But this brother you think he
may be of help?"</p>

<p>Barbara thought Wilmot was attaching undue importance to what
was, after all, an old, finished item of Mrs. Tangye's past.</p>

<p>Wilmot did not care to explain just what the photograph might
really mean.</p>

<p>"The trouble is this brother is off for Berlin to-night. And
the Yard doesn't know whether Pointer wants him stopped' or not.
An awkward thing to blunder just now. It's Pointer's case, you
see." Wilmot stood a second looking irresolutely at the girl.</p>

<p>"Can't I help? Oh, Mr. Wilmot, please don't shunt me! For
Phil's sake&mdash;for the sake of bringing Mrs. Tangye's murderer
to justice, I'd do anything! Anything!"</p>

<p>He came closer and looked at her keenly.</p>

<p>"I believe you would!" he said encouragingly. "Splendid!" He
thought for half a second. "Yes, that's the best thing to do. You
go to Professor Orison's house. This man Hart isn't there. We've
just telephoned to the Professor to ask. He says he's doing some
home work, and that he doesn't expect to see him till to-morrow.
But should Hart suddenly go there while I'm looking him up down
where he lives in Bloomsbury, you'll be on hand. You might get
some facts from him. You'll be safe in speaking quite openly to
him."</p>

<p>"And what about Olive? She's down below in the taxi." Again
Wilmot reflected for a second.</p>

<p>"We'll take her along in my car! She might come in useful for
sending a message, or whatever maids do come in for." He finished
vaguely. He was in a tearing hurry, and Barbara caught his spirit
of rush. Of things drawing to a climax. But he made time for two
things.</p>

<p>"I must leave a line to tell Pointer what we're after. And
send a message to the same effect to the Yard."</p>

<p>And, in spite of her impatience, he scribbled a note, slipped
it in an envelope, addressed it to Pointer, and left it
conspicuously on his table. Then he turned to his 'phone, and
Barbara heard the code word for the C.I.D. of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"Tell Chief Inspector Pointer that Miss Ash and I are going to
see this Hart at once. She to Professor Orison's house, and I to
his lodgings in Bloomsbury. Leave this message at every place
where Inspector Pointer may call."</p>

<p>A moment more and he was running beside her down the
stairs.</p>

<p>In his car he rattled on in the highest spirits. Barbara had
never seen Wilmot on the war-path before. This was Wilmot, the
great reporter. Wilmot of the War.</p>

<p>"I'll come with you to Professor Orison's to make sure Hart
isn't in the house. Then I'll taxi on to him, and wait till
Pointer joins me. He wont be long. If you, meanwhile will be kind
enough to stay at the Professor's till I 'phone you&mdash;half an
hour should settle everything. The lower rooms in his house are a
sort of Polish museum, you know. Ever been there?"</p>

<p>Barbara never had.</p>

<p>"I've heard it's jolly good. Scotland Yard, in its note, said
that Hart, when he's there, acts as showman; when he's away, the
Professor sometimes takes a hand himself. If he does, try to get
him to talk about Hart. You may pick up something about the
family. Where Hart came from, and so on. Say you think you knew a
sister-in-law of his."</p>

<p>Barbara bit her lip. She felt that she only understood a very
small part of the real story, and yet would have to act as though
she knew all. Few positions are more hobbling to an intelligent
person.</p>

<p>"Can't you explain a little more about why Mr. Hart
matters?"</p>

<p>"I know that you won't mind if I say that that's for Chief
Inspector Pointer to do. It's his case. I don't know how much he
wants suppressed, how much told."</p>

<p>Barbara nodded. She quite understood. Handicapped though she
would be, if she got a chance, she would do her best.</p>

<p>Wilmot stopped in front of a narrow, black and white house. A
tall, repellent-faced woman answered the bell.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Hart&mdash;Professor Orison's secretary&mdash;in?"
Wilmot inquired.</p>

<p>"No, sir. The Professor is in though."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you&mdash;no need to trouble him. The collection is
on view, isn't it?" Wilmot asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Till seven o'clock, sir." The woman stood aside.</p>

<p>Wilmot hurried back to the cab, and was off round the nearest
corner. Just as the woman was closing the door, Olive shivered
violently.</p>

<p>"I'm cold, that's all, miss. Must have caught a chill," she
answered to Barbara's inquiring look as they followed the woman
into a large, panelled room filled chiefly with weapons more or
less interesting, running from Batory to Langiewicz. They were
left alone. The next room had a press of Zainer incunabula, some
interesting <i>stiletcziki</i> cartoons, and a complete set of
Polish stamps.</p>

<p>Barbara roamed the rooms restlessly, seeing nothing. Why was
Hart thrust so much in the foreground? Wilmot evidently knew of
him as Mrs. Tangye's first husband, and of his death. Why was the
photograph of a man drowned thirteen years ago so important?</p>

<p>Suddenly Olive gave a low cry. It was not loud, but it brought
Barbara to her feet with prickling skin.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she asked tensely.</p>

<p>"The steps!" Olive was on her feet too. Listening in a strange
attitude that seemed to flinch back even as it bent forward.</p>

<p>"The footsteps! The footsteps that stopped! They've stopped
again on the landing above us. I knew! I smelled death! They're
coming in! They're coming in! They won't stop this time. Oh, Miss
Barbara, run&mdash;run! They're coming for us!"</p>

<p>The girl fell on to a seat in what Barbara thought was a
faint. But it was something deeper than that. She herself was
entirely unaffected by the girl's mad words, though the tone of
horror had startled her. Had she had a clue to them, it might
have been different.</p>

<p>The door opened, and an old man, with thick white hair and
eyebrows, and a skin so wrinkled that he looked like a deflated
balloon, came into the room, bowing politely.</p>

<p>"Did I hear some one call? I am Professor Orison and&mdash;is
your young friend ill?" He broke off. "The air is somewhat stuffy
in here, I am afraid. It is impossible to open a window without
admitting smuts."</p>

<p>Barbara would have recognised the Professor again without
having heard his name. His was neither an appearance nor an
accent to be mistaken.</p>

<p>He rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Let me assist you and my housekeeper to carry her upstairs
into an airier room."</p>

<p>Olive was taken up to a neat, simple bedroom on the floor
above. It was a warm, prepossessing room, and on his advice they
laid the girl down on the bed without making further efforts to
revive her.</p>

<p>"Leave that to nature." The professor felt the girl's pulse.
"I have some trifling knowledge of medicine. Enough to know a
case of fatigue, and a chill after insufficient food. She will be
better if left alone&mdash;in perfect quiet. There is such a
thing as mental noise and rush," he added, smiling gently, as
Barbara lingered. "Thoughts can disturb."</p>

<p>Barbara told him that Olive had had a great shock
recently.</p>

<p>"Just so. Deranged nerves. Let her be by herself in this
darkened room, and I guarantee that when you look in again in
half an hour's time, she will be sleeping quietly, and can then
be wakened without any danger. Wakened to have a cup of tea, I
should suggest, which my housekeeper prepares very well. Now, if
you like to come back with me to the rooms below I think I may be
able to make them a little more interesting than they were
without explanations. My secretary unfortunately is not here for
another hour or so. He has a better command of English than
I."</p>

<p>Barbara followed him out of the room and down below. She liked
Professor Orison, and was keen to question him about Hart.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>

<p class="first">
OLIVE woke up as the door shut behind Barbara and the
Professor. She woke up absolutely clear in her mind, not as one
coming out of a faint. It was more as though her spirit had been
away receiving definite instructions, given a certain part to
carry through.</p>

<p>She flung aside the down quilt, and got up noiselessly.</p>

<p>The voices of Barbara and the Professor could be heard
chatting pleasantly together as they went down the stairs, and
then stopped as they shut the door behind them.</p>

<p>Olive leant against the wall in a sudden access, not of fear,
but of knowledge. Knowledge of evil. Certainty of danger. Whether
from the Professor, or his housekeeper, or from some other
source, this house was no place for herself or for Barbara Ash.
Some imminent peril menaced both. She even felt certain of the
extent of the danger.</p>

<p>It was death by violence that was so close to them.</p>

<p>She slipped, bareheaded as she was, for they had taken off her
hat, down to the floor below. She was just stealthily turning the
Yale lock of the front door when the room beside it opened, and
the housekeeper put out her head.</p>

<p>"Sh-h!" Olive whispered. "I'm off to the pub for a drink. My
young lady's temperance, so mum's the word. I'll bring back a
bottle of sommat warming for you too."</p>

<p>The woman leered at her.</p>

<p>"I thought that faint of yours was a bit deep. Mind you don't
stay out too long."</p>

<p>"Trust me!" Olive whispered.</p>

<p>"Better let me turn that knob for you. There's a trick to it.
I'll leave it on the latch for you. Mind you don't forget the
bottle. Make it gin, dearie, make it gin."</p>

<p>Down the little path to the gate Olive hurried. Leaving it
open she raced headlong to the corner; a mongrel in the next
garden was barking his envy, he was so tired of his own little
patch of lawn.</p>

<p>At the corner a constable stood talking to two men in tweeds.
One tall, one medium. Olive put all her strength into a last
spurt.</p>

<p>"Inspector Pointer! Help! Miss Barbara...Oh, you're too late!
Too late!"</p>

<p>Pointer had wheeled at the first sight of the flying figure.
He had run to meet the girl, "The end house?"</p>

<p>Olive nodded.</p>

<p>The end house was Professor Orison's. It was the only gate
that stood open. Pointer did not wait to hear more. Nor did
Vardon.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector had played for all England. The first
forward of his time. But he had never run as he ran now. Vardon
was close at his heels. The constable brought up the rear helping
Olive along.</p>

<p>Pointer jumped the steps, and thundered out a true policeman's
knock with the wrought iron knocker before he flung the door
open. He wanted all within the house to know that the Law was at
hand. It was a knock to make any evil-doer pause.</p>

<p>From far above him he heard another kind of pounding as though
some one were beating on the door of a locked room.</p>

<p>As Pointer rushed into the hall, the housekeeper shrank back
fearfully into a doorway.</p>

<p>"Whatever is the matter?" she quavered. "First the maid runs
off. Then the young lady runs out into the garden and clambers
over the wall, and the master after her. Giving me a blow on the
chest in passing that knocked the breath out of me."</p>

<p>Far overhead, the sound of knocking and banging continued.</p>

<p>Pointer, a hand on her arm, ran her out to the back. He did
not intend to leave her alone, and the constable with Olive were
still in the street. Vardon was flying up the stairs, three at a
time, calling:</p>

<p>"Barbara! Where are you? It's me&mdash;Philip!"</p>

<p>There was a small garden, mostly paved with stone and with
herbaceous borders. The three walls were covered with ivy.
Pointer gave one swift look about him. A knowledgable look, then
he turned. No person, man or woman, had clambered over those
plants or scrambled over those leaves. There was no way out
except through the house.</p>

<p>He wasted no words on the woman. But dropped her with the
constable who had now arrived with Olive. The young man was
evidently not quite sure whether the girl was under arrest or
not. Another policeman came hurrying up.</p>

<p>"Olive! Which room?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know! I don't know where she went to!" Pointer had
only waited for her first sentence.</p>

<p>"Watch this woman," he thrust the housekeeper into a chair.
"Come on upstairs, one of you men."</p>

<p>He leaped up them himself, to find in a top bedroom an amazed
Vardon staring at a bent old gentleman with a wild head of white
hair. He was tied to his chair, and a towel made a very good gag.
The noise they had heard was the legs of his chair which he had
rocked violently to and fro on the wooden floor.</p>

<p>Pointer rushed into the next room. And into the ones beyond.
Then he was back again. The second constable at his heels, while
Vardon sawed at Professor Orison's gag.</p>

<p>"He may know something. Have you seen anything of a young
lady? Quick! It's touch and go!" Vardon asked.</p>

<p>"Robbery! My collection!" yelled the Professor, thrusting him
aside and trying to rise. "My Post Office Mauritius&mdash;the
fourteenth of its kind&mdash;"</p>

<p>By this time Pointer was on the floor below. He sent the
second constable up to look after Orison.</p>

<p>"Finish untying him, and stay with him till I call you."</p>

<p>Vardon joined Pointer, and began moving heavy couches, peering
into wardrobes, crawling under beds. He worked like a man
possessed.</p>

<p>As for Pointer, one dart into each room, a glance in each
object of a size to hide a body, and he was out again.</p>

<p>Running up from the basement to the ground floor, he found
Olive staring blindly about her with distended eyes.</p>

<p>"The footsteps! I knew when they stopped! Oh, Miss
Barby&mdash;dear Miss Barby! I heard them come into this
room..."</p>

<p>Vardon rushed down to them. He turned despairingly to
Pointer.</p>

<p>"You say she didn't leave by the back door. We had the front
one in sight from the corner. Then where is she? For God's sake
find her! I can't!"</p>

<p>Vardon's face looked old, and white, and fallen in.</p>

<p>Never in all Pointer's life had so awful a responsibility been
his. For Barbara was in the house&mdash;according to Olive, and
he believed the girl&mdash;yet he could not find her. To really
search that house, any house, to tap the walls, examine the
floors, would take hours. Hours! And every second here was
vital.</p>

<p>Vardon, in his own anguish&mdash;almost beyond
bearing&mdash;thought the Chief Inspector looked unperturbed. But
it was years before this late afternon in November ceased to
haunt Pointer.</p>

<p>Another man might have tried this&mdash;thought
that&mdash;believed some other thing; but Pointer knew. He
<i>knew</i> that Barbara Ash was beyond human aid. And, had
things been different, Pointer could have loved Barbara.</p>

<p>The dog next door began to bark again furiously. The constable
in charge of the housekeeper in the hall opened the front door to
look out, his hand on the woman's arm. The dog's master had
returned.</p>

<p>Even in his dash to the house Pointer had placed the mongrel
as a lurcher. The gypsy's and the poacher's dog.</p>

<p>Bred for the unbelievable quickness of its scenting powers,
its skill in finding, its intelligence.</p>

<p>Pointer, using a chairback as a pole, hurled himself across
the room, the hall, through the door and down the steps. He
vaulted the railing between the two houses.</p>

<p>"There's a girl missing. She's in that house. Your dog...It's
life or death."</p>

<p>The man, young and wiry, dashed back with him, the dog one
streak beside him, his gray-hound blood to the fore.</p>

<p>"Here!" Pointer stopped him in the print-room, the one which
Olive had heard Babara enter.</p>

<p>"We think she's been concealed somewhere. In the walls or a
secret cupboard."</p>

<p>Like master, like dog; the lurcher was all eagerness.</p>

<p>"Find her, Pal! Seek! Seek! Find her!" said his master,
setting his own mind intently to grip the dog's mind. Pointer and
Vardon were doing the same. Every nerve in their bodies was with
the dog, in some ways the cleverest beast that lives, who stood
for the barest second with one paw lifted. Then he made straight
for a wall, and stretching down between his front paws, nosed
between them. In a second, Pointer, Vardon, and his master, had
flung aside the five-foot broad bookcase which stood in no wise
different from the other cases ranged at regular intervals around
the room. Behind it the wall looked unbroken. But Pointer ran his
finger nails along the panelling. Pulling, not pressing. Suddenly
the whole panel moved towards him. As he hoped, some one had been
in too great a hurry to close the secret door absolutely true on
to its invisible catch. One pressure of a clumsy hand, and all
would have been lost.</p>

<p>Inside, hanging to a bracket, was something like a
bag&mdash;something covered with a brown cloth&mdash;it was
Barbara.</p>

<p>Olive fainted.</p>

<p>They cut Barbara down, and laid her on the floor. The dog
whimpered unheeded as he licked one hand clenched in agony.</p>

<p>Every village constable is instructed in how to bring people
back to consciousness.</p>

<p>"Schaefer's method, I see. I'm in the R.A.F. Can I help?" The
dog's master looked serviceable.</p>

<p>"You work that arm. You, that one, Vardon. Now, in time to my
counts!" Pointer dug his fingers beneath Barbara's young ribs.
Fortunately nowdays no time has to be lost in taking off bodices,
and cutting laces.</p>

<p>Pointer, while he worked, called out some instructions to the
constable in the hall. Among other orders, the man was to
telephone for a doctor.</p>

<p>Rhythmically, quietly, they worked over the girl. Giles, the
flying man, changing places with Pointer every five minutes. As
for Olive, when she came to herself again, she crouched in a
corner, huddled and shivering.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour passed.</p>

<p>Pointer felt his very heart turning cold. The bloated mask
that was Barbara's face was taking on a set look. The terrible
purple colour seemed growing more fixed. The swollen lips had
fallen still further apart. The whole body of the young girl
seemed heavier, less flexible.</p>

<p>The other saw the change too. The R.A.F. man was biting his
lips. Vardon's face was too agonised to look at. He was working
quietly, obediently, desperately, but he was sobbing now under
his whistling breath.</p>

<p>Pointer handed him the arm which he was flexing and turned
away. He tore out one of the big, plain, silver, cufflinks he
wore. Silver, so that no thief should be tempted to steal them.
With a turn of the link he unscrewed one lozenge-shaped end.
Inside it, was what looked like a coin-pressed cocoon. Pointer
ripped it open with a touch of his penknife. Within was something
wrapped in a leaf. Still faintly green. Pointer unfolded it.</p>

<p>It was a fresh Guru nut in a tiny lotus leaf once wet with
lotus dew. A slave's ransom among the Senussi. Five of them a
princess's dower. A Sheik had given it to Pointer in gratitude
for timely help. Pointer now crushed it with the handle of his
knife. He laid the crumbs on the girl's black tongue and kept the
mouth gently shut. Then it was his turn to relieve Giles.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed. Vardon gave a cry. The lips beneath his
hand had trembled and tried to close. Another second and the
colour of Barbara's face changed from blue-red to white which
slowly turned creamy. The eyes, though bloodshot were back in
their sockets now, and the lids covered them softly. Still
another minute and they lifted again. Barbara looked at Vardon. A
look that he never forgot, though he never quite fathomed it.
Confidence and love were in it, and something humble. Something
that mutely asked forgiveness. For Barbara came back to
consciousness with the certainty as to Vardon's innocence of Mrs.
Tangye's death shining like a great light within her heart. She
knew at last, by some conviction of the soul, some telepathy of
the spirit, that, whoever might be guilty, it was not he.</p>

<p>Vardon had got her into his arms, her head was lying against
his breast. What he murmured to her, those around did not have to
forget, they did not hear it, so disconnecting is great
excitement.</p>

<p>They learnt afterwards that by chance the cord around her neck
had been pulled tight in such a way that she had been garotted.
The chief pressure had not come on her windpipe, or there would
have been no chance of saving her.</p>

<p>Pointer called in the constable from the telephone. The man
had been recording an unbroken series of blanks. A great medical
congress was on, the Chief Inspector now remembered, and every
qualified man would be at it.</p>

<p>Pointer took his place, called up Scotland Yard, and rattle
off a code order. Then he slammed down the receiver, and hurried
back into the room.</p>

<p>Barbara was sitting up and trying to speak. Pointer thought
that she had better be given no stimulant after that nut, but he
suggested that she should be carried into the next room, where
there was a roaring fire, and where incidentally, the Professor
had been trying to extract information from an imperturbable but
dumbfounded constable. Barbara croaked out a refusal to be
carried, and insisted on walking, though Vardon kept his arm
around her and Giles crooked an elbow to be used if wanted. Pal
barked his joy. He liked girls, and in some way he felt that this
one belonged to him.</p>

<p>Pointer detained his master, and handed him his official card
when they were alone.</p>

<p>"We owe you and your dog&mdash;" Pointer's voice shook. For
once, the Chief Inspector could not finish a sentence. Another
three minutes, and not all the Guru nuts in the world could have
saved Barbara.</p>

<p>Giles whistled the lurcher to him. "He's not much to look at,
or rather he's too much. But I've always been glad I stole
him&mdash;saving your presence&mdash;as a pup from a drunken
tinker, who was beating him to death. He gave his greyhound-collie-airedale-retriever-setter-spaniel a friendly smack.</p>

<p>"Thanks so much for asking us to your party," he said
prettily, and the detective officer laughed, glad of the relief
to the tension of the past few minutes, "but Pal and I mustn't
stay longer. We promised mother to be back early."</p>

<p>"If ever you're in a tight place, Mr. Giles, you call on me!"
Pointer showed him to the door. There was a fog outside, growing
thicker every minute.</p>

<p>The meeting between Barbara and the Professor was almost
amusing.</p>

<p>The Professor stared in feeble bewilderment, and listened to
her story in something like a frenzy of weakness and
excitement.</p>

<p>Her tale was brief.</p>

<p>She did not recollect what had happened to her beyond that, as
she was bending over a tattered Zainer, something-it was a brown
clothes bag from an upper room&mdash;had been pulled over her
head from behind, its cord drawn tight by an unseen hand. She had
felt first as though hit by a flash of light, and then, as though
dropping through endless space into darkness. Unconsciousness had
come at once.</p>

<p>"But when&mdash;what time?" Orison shrilled, "What hour was it
when you came here? You say you saw Professor Orison. I'm
Professor Orison. The only Professor Orison. I've never seen you
before." He eyed Barbara with suspicion.</p>

<p>She told him the time. Barbara was feeling amazingly herself
again. She was in no pain. Even her swollen neck did not hurt her
unless she touched it. She felt as though she had been given a
drink of some powerful elixir. It was Olive who looked as though
she had been at the verge of death. Red-eyed, haggard, ghastly
pale, she kept close to Pointer's side.</p>

<p>Once in crossing to the fire to stoke it, Vardon tripped a
little. Olive flinched like a beaten dog who hears the whip.</p>

<p>Orison put a shaking, wrinkled hand to his head. "But I was
upstairs at that time! Tied and gagged!"</p>

<p>His story was that, nearly half an hour before the time
Barbara had got to the house, he had been in the house alone, as
he thought, except for his housekeeper, and was stooping with his
back to the door, fitting a key into the rather difficult lock of
the press that housed his stamp collection, when something, or
some one, had pressed his head on to the floor where a sponge
lay, apparently dropped from space. When he next recollected
anything, he was alone in an upper bedroom, bound and gagged. He
could hear nothing of what passed in the house, for the towel
over his mouth passed across his ears as well.</p>

<p>"But surely our stories can wait," Orison fumed shrilly, "I
presume you are satisfied of this young lady's <i>bona
fides</i>&gt;&mdash;" he looked as though he himself were not,
"the essential is to get back my green Mauritius. 1847. Three
thousand pounds! Not yet listed! I know it's been taken&mdash;"
He tottered into the next room and gave a screech that sounded
like a rusty siren.</p>

<p>"I knew it! Gone!"</p>

<p>Pointer led him gently, but firmly, back into the other
room.</p>

<p>"You really need to rest yourself, sir," he warned him, "at
your age&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My age!" piped the Professor indignantly, "my age, sir, is no
more than your own. Mind, mind is what counts. And as long as the
power of growth exists, so long&mdash;" His voice trailed off
feebly. He looked a very old man as he sat mouthing at them.</p>

<p>Tea was brought in by one of the constables.</p>

<p>"The housekeeper was too upset to bring it herself, sir," he
explained to Pointer, "says she isn't accustomed to seeing
double. Or rather to having a gentleman be downstairs and
upstairs at the same time."</p>

<p>"Now what did she mean by that?" mumbled Orison after a
thirsty drink, "the female mind is apt to lack coherence."</p>

<p>"She means that some one impersonated you, sir, this
afternoon. That the man whom Miss Ash here saw and talked to was
made up to look like you, not a difficult feat, and evidently
deceived your housekeeper as well. As to your stamp, we shall get
the man who stole it, the man who passed himself off as you."</p>

<p>"Hart!" Barbara said suddenly. For the moment she had
forgotten the talk with Wilmot.</p>

<p>"Hart? My secretary? Well&mdash;what of him?" Orison mumbled,
groping for his spectacles, as though they would help him find
the man.</p>

<p>There was a ring at the front door.</p>

<p>"That'll be Wilmot!" Pointer said eagerly rising, and going to
it himself. But it was Haviland who came back with him a second
later. Haviland, who brought in wisps of fog clinging to him. The
Superintendent evidently had no clue to this little meeting, and
rubbed his chin thoughtfully after the barest of greetings all
around.</p>

<p>Pointer did not stop to tell him of what had just taken place.
He wanted to hear as quickly as possible what Barbara had to
tell, since she seemed so able to talk. She poured out her tale
of Newport, of the Harts who lived there, of the possible
relationship with Professor Orison's secretary, as telephoned on
from the C.I.D.</p>

<p>"But does all this lead us to my Mauritius?" the Professor
interrupted once irascibly. No one heeded him.</p>

<p>"So Wilmot has gone to this Hart's address in Bloomsbury."
Pointer looked very uneasy. "Is there a telephone to your
secretary's rooms, sir?"</p>

<p>Orison said there was not.</p>

<p>"Humph. The fog's too thick to try to leave the house&mdash;"
Pointer peered behind the curtain at the solid black wall.
"Wilmot's a good man, none better in his own line, but this is
not his line. This is a policeman's job. He's an amateur. He may
have no idea of the dangerous nature of the man he thinks is
Hart's brother-in-law."</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilmot may be in trouble, that's a fact." Havilind too,
looked worried.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilmot? Do you mean Mr. Arthur Wilmot, the Japanese
collector?" asked Orison, in the tone of a man trying to find
some familiar landmark.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilmot's a newspaper man. A special correspondent. As a
matter of fact, he's better known to you, sir, I dare say, as W.
W.," Haviland explained.</p>

<p>"Oh!" the Professor's eyes lost their look of interest. "A
joumalist. A reporter, I suppose? Necessary, but degrading
office."</p>

<p>Pointer sat staring at his boot-tips.</p>

<p>"Just as well that there's some one at the other end of this
line, even though it is a position of danger. Nothing can be done
until this pea-soup lifts, but I'll use your telephone, if I may,
sir, and give the Yard an outline of what's up."</p>

<p>"Outline? Tell them the date. 1847. And the colour green."</p>

<p>Haviland heard of the Professor's loss with a concern that
seemed to placate him a little.</p>

<p>Pointer came back.</p>

<p>"They can't do anything either till this lifts. Let's hope
Wilmot's wits will pull him through, and yet detain Hart. Now,
sir, since we're all here as your guests would you like to hear
the real reason for the attack this afternoon? An attack, not on
your collection, but aimed solely at Miss Ash here?"</p>

<p>Orison blinked. He said that he certainly should like to hear
the explanation of such an astounding statement.</p>

<p>"But that stamp has been taken!" he pointed out.</p>

<p>"Overlooked, sir, I think you'll find when you've time to go
over your collection more at leisure. But do you remember hearing
of the death of a Mrs. Tangye just over a week ago?"</p>

<p>As he expected, the Professor shook his head.</p>

<p>"No. I never read newspapers. The waves set up by their
articles are not conducive to that calmness essential to the
mental worker."</p>

<p>The Professor looked longingly at his desk. On a kneehole
table lay the draft of a lecture on Minkowski. He was just making
his argument clear that under certain aspects of space-time the
triply extended, and the singly enduring can be one and the same
attribute.</p>

<p>Pointer, who had looked at the open sheets thought that they
could wait. He settled himself still more at ease in his chair,
one hand fingering the pipe in his pocket, as the next best thing
to smoking it, and began:</p>

<p>"It may help to pass the time for you, Miss Ash, and you,
Olive, since you can't get away. Once upon a time, or literally,
thirty-five years ago, a curate's daughter was born. Her name was
Mable Headly."</p>

<p>Pointer ran through the story that he had just lately been
piecing together.</p>

<p>"Apparently, Professor, this Hart who was believed to have
been drowned and your secretary are one and the same person, not
brothers-in-law," Pointer wound up, "you see our interest in him
now? It looks as though he had been aware of Miss Ash's
investigations down at Newport, and realising that if once she
gets hold of his portrait, the only portrait perhaps that exists
of him, it will be put in our hands and printed in every
newspaper by us&mdash;he determines to put her out of the way. He
himself writes a note to the Assistant Commissioner, so I think
we shall find, telling him of your secretary's name and
existence. Haviland and I don't get the news, because by chance
we're out. But it reaches Wilmot, who acts as Hart thought he
would. I think Hart expected Wilmot to come here with Miss Ash.
In which case he doubtless would have separated them, and
duplicated his murderous attempt."</p>

<p>"Then Hart&mdash;Hart killed Mrs. Tangye?" Barbara asked, no
longer bewildered.</p>

<p>"That's what we think. And Hart chloroformed the Professor and
tried to strangle you. We were just in time, or rather&mdash;but
that must wait. The point is this? Who is Hart? Is he Oliver
Headly? That's what it looks like to me. When you get that
photograph which is to be sent on from your Newport hotel, we
shall know."</p>

<p>Barbara had a momentary, dizzying realisation of the danger
that had hovered&mdash;struck&mdash;and been parried.</p>

<p>"I fail to grasp entirely the validity of the reasons that
make you think that my secretary&mdash;" the Professor joined his
finger-tips wearily, "my
secretary&mdash;is&mdash;this&mdash;wanted&mdash;man&mdash;" his
voice trailed off. His mouth remained half open. His eyes grew
dull.</p>

<p>Pointer poured him out some brandy.</p>

<p>"All this has upset you, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It would have upset any one!" snapped the Professor
ungraciously, coughing as he drank off the thimbleful. "Any one!
An irreparable loss! Even if you catch the thief&mdash;I mean,
the murderer&mdash;" he hastily corrected, "I shall never see my
Mauritius again! Never! And it was to figure in a drawing-room
talk which I had promised the dowager Duchess of Kingsford to
give this afternoon. I ought to go&mdash;the fog's
lifting&mdash;she will expect me. I feel hardly able, but I
suppose..."</p>

<p>He maundered on. Pointer drew the curtains. Some one switched
off the lights. Outside was only pale gray now. The little group
of people so strangely brought together for one tremendous hour,
began to break up. Barbara and Olive put on their hats; Vardon
watching Barbara as though she might go to pieces any moment.</p>

<p>Olive was hardly able to get her hands to her head. Barbara,
who had not yet been told of the essential part she, too, had
played in her escape from death, helping her, encouragingly.</p>

<p>Pointer and Haviland drifted to the hall outside, where the
constable sat thinking out possible solutions to all that he had
seen and heard this afternoon&mdash;and not seen and not
heard.</p>

<p>"I'll stay on here in case Hart turns up&mdash;" Pointer
opened the door to look out, "he may play a bold part, knowing
that neither victim saw him. Or Wilmot may telephone. Try to get
to him, as soon as the house-party has gone. There's a taxi
passing&mdash;" Pointer turned to the constable who was listening
eagerly, "get it for us. And a second as well, if you can."</p>

<p>The Professor, very shaky about the knees, came out and began
to fumble for his top-coat.</p>

<p>Haviland buttoned him up.</p>

<p>"Would you allow us to remain for a little while?" Pointer
asked, "your housekeeper is below. We want to question her. Also,
I think it possible that your secretary may play the part of
innocence, and come on here."</p>

<p>The Professor gave the permission with alacrity.</p>

<p>"I should be glad for you to wait, at least until that young
lady has left. I must say I consider the part she and her maid
have played in this strange affair very obscure. And that man who
came with you? He, I understand, is not a member of your
admirable Force?"</p>

<p>"No. He's here by chance. But he's engaged to Miss Ash."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" the suspicion in the Professor's voice became more
acute. "I consider the whole affair needs a great deal more
investigation than it has had&mdash;"</p>

<p>The taxi drew in.</p>

<p>"You take this one, sir," Pointer advised, "there's another
behind there for the ladies. Let me put you in, you look pretty
well done."</p>

<p>Pointer lifted the bent figure like a child down the steps to
the taxi. Haviland, grinning, opened the door.</p>

<p>A couple of men were passing. Another, on the other side of
the road, lingered.</p>

<p>Pointer turned to the nearest.</p>

<p>"Here is Professor Orison," he said, literally laying his
burden in the other's arms, and slipping, as he did so, a
respirator over the man's mouth. At least it looked like a
respirator, but it fitted uncommonly closely. "Take him to the
station, Watts. Wash him well, and you'll find Mr. Wilmot. Put
Mr. Wilmot through the mangle, and you'll find Hart. Irving Hart.
Wanted for the murder of his wife, Mable Hart, and the attempted
murder of Miss Ash. You have warrants made out in all three
names?"</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Watts nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Here, Miller, handcuff the left hand to yours. I'll
do the same with his right. We'll see he doesn't get a chance to
lift either to his mouth, sir."</p>

<p>Pointer and Haviland retraced their steps. A dog barked from a
neighbouring window. Some one hastily shut him up. Evidently Pal
and his master were interested spectators.</p>

<p>"He'll read about it to-night. I wouldn't arrest Wilmot in the
room for fear of a scene. Those two girls have had enough of
horrors. You got my message too, I see, Newnes. I suppose
Inspector Watts has been bringing you up to date as you came
along?"</p>

<p>"Rather! Back in a minute!" Newnes started off at a run to the
nearest telephone.</p>

<p>Haviland closed the front door. The spare constable was
dismissed from extra duty, the other had been sent to the police
station with the housekeeper long ago. Haviland held the knob a
second in his hand and stood staring at Pointer.</p>

<p>He had kept his face absolutely wooden outside, but it had
paled.</p>

<p>"Wilmot! Mr. Wilmot! Well, I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;I <i>am!</i>
And that's a fact! Oh, well played, sir! But Mr. Wilmot!"</p>

<p>It spoke volumes for Pointer's standing, that Haviland did
not, even for a second, question the facts.</p>

<p>"You've known it all along?" he asked with deep respect.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. Never suspected it till an hour ago. Let's
clear the house, and I'll explain."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Barbara would have followed the Professor into the
hall, but Olive had stopped her.</p>

<p>"Don't go near him, miss! He's been meaning murder every
second since they brought us into the room. He's been sitting
there longing to wring both our necks, and only putting it off."
Olive's cheeks had colour in them now. "I wasn't ill. I was
terrified. Afraid lest he should get the better of the Inspector
in some way."</p>

<p>Pointer and Haviland returned.</p>

<p>"Right you are, Olive," Haviland nodded. "But, as a matter of
fact, you don't get the better of Chief Inspector Pointer easily.
He's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll call and see you to-morrow, if I may, Miss Ash," Pointer
broke in hurriedly, "if only to thank you for what you've done.
That Pringle family, and above all, that photograph of Hart...But
we mustn't start explanations now. You may not think it, but you
need quiet. And so does Olive. I'll answer every question to-morrow, and ask just a few myself."</p>

<p>Barbara did not move.</p>

<p>"Is Philip cleared, Mr. Chief Inspector? Absolutely? I know
he's innocent&mdash;" her eyes met her fiance's for one magic
moment, "but is he cleared?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely and definitely."</p>

<p>"But how do you&mdash;" began Vardon.</p>

<p>"Ah, here's your cab," was his only answer. "Mr. Vardon will
see you both safely home," and Pointer most inhospitably opened
the door. But this time it was Olive, who stopped.</p>

<p>"Miss Barbara! That photograph! I'm sure I have it here in my
bag. The hall-porter at the hotel gave me at the last minute what
I thought was only some price lists I'd asked about, never
thinking we was going to leave Newport so suddenly. He said they
were for me, and I dropped them into my bag.</p>

<p>"There wasn't any letter amongst them. And in the train I read
the papers you bought, Miss. But while I was waiting for you
outside Mr. Wilmot's rooms, I looked through them. One envelope
is for you, and you can feel there's a picture inside it. I'd
have given it you immediate, only Mr. Wilmot was talking so hard
after we got into his car and you both seemed in such a rush.
Just now I didn't say nothing. Not in front of that Professor!
Here it is, miss."</p>

<p>Pointer laid a hand on it.</p>

<p>"I'm asking an awful lot. But will you let me have
this&mdash;without looking at it yourself? I think, thanks to you
that the&mdash;" he was going to say "prosecution" but changed
the word to "case, has got a tremendous lift."</p>

<p>"Since Hart is Mrs. Tangye's murderer, I don't want to see his
portrait." Barbara shivered. "But how did you catch him? I
thought he had got away from here?"</p>

<p>"You let Mr. Vardon take you home now," was Pointer's soothing
answer. "And we'll have a long talk to-morrow, but just one
question first. How did you get out of the house, Olive? You
saved Miss Barbara's life by that plucky run."</p>

<p>Olive explained, while Barbara for the first time learnt the
sequence of events in her rescue.</p>

<p>The two girls clung to each other. Olive was crying, Barbara
was beginning to feel exhausted. The powerful stimulant of the
nut was passing off. She was glad to let Vardon close the taxi
door on the three of them.</p>

<p>Pointer drew out the photograph, a cabinet-sized enlargement
of a family group. There in the centre, out of the shadows,
looked a face. The face of Wilmot. Practically unaltered, except
for the haziness of a beard just beginning to show.</p>

<p>A ring came on the telephone. Pointer leapt for the
instrument. Listened; and turned away with a smile.</p>

<p>"He's safely searched and locked up. All rings and personal
belongings have been taken from him. Haviland, we've won!" He
drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"This last hour I've been like Olive&mdash;terrified. But lest
he should guess, we, or rather, I, knew the truth. Frightened for
fear he should make some slip I should have to notice. That's why
I talked such a lot when that confounded fog came down. That's
why I sent his housekeeper off to be locked up as soon as
possible. Wilmot would be sure to have poison handy. Ring, cigar-case, watch. A dozen possible places. Even before I knew who Hart
would turn out to be, I expected I might have trouble to take him
alive. So I kept that respirator of mine handy. No getting
anything into his mouth with that on, even without Watts's added
precautions.</p>

<p>"Death by his own hand would be too utterly inadequate. He's
not to escape punishment like that."</p>

<p>"But what in the world made you link Wilmot with Professor
Orison? You say you had no idea of it till this afternoon? I
still don't understand it, sir. The fact is," Haviland confessed
honestly, "the more I think it over, the less I see how you did
it."</p>

<p>"It was a mistake on his part to tie his hands together, back
to back. It looked very convincing, but it showed his palms.
Interested in palmistry, Haviland?"</p>

<p>"Me? Not much! Why?"</p>

<p>"I pay great attention to palms. Ever since a crook detected
me by mine. That over-rated villain, Peace, once said that
policemen only looked at faces never at hands. They're one of the
few things make-up doesn't change. I can recognise a hand now.
Any one's. It's a mere matter of training&mdash;of routine. And
Wilmot happens to have the most extraordinary lines, and absence
of lines. Those palms turned towards me were Wilmot's, and no one
else's in the world. That gave me a tremendous jar. Miss Ash
being missing could only be Hart's work. Obviously. And here in
the house where she had last been seen alive, was Orison with
Wilmot's hands. The chain made itself.
Orison&mdash;Wilmot&mdash;Hart. And, well, if ever there was a
moment to be quick off the mark, it was when I believed Miss Ash
was in the house, and couldn't find her. For I knew then, or
rather I feared, that those hands being Wilmot's meant that we
should find her dead or dying." Pointer walked to the window, and
stood there for a long minute before he turned round again.
"Nothing but Olive's rush out of the house&mdash;nothing but the
fact that by God's mercy, Vardon and I were at hand&mdash;we were
asking the constable to point us out Orison's house&mdash;saved
her.</p>

<p>"As for Miss Ash's story about Wilmot's sending her here post-haste&mdash;those messages he sent to the Yard, and the one from
the Assistant Commissioner about Hart the secretary, and the
letter left for me on his table, will all turn out to be dummies,
of course. We may be sure that he had some very neat plan for
throwing us off the scent mapped out in that dark brain of his.
All I knew an hour ago was, that the delay before she saw the
Professor would have been sufficient to let Wilmot get into
Orison's things."</p>

<p>"He always was a lightning worker!" Newnes threw in. The
reporter had returned, and was writing like a delirious hen
scratching for food.</p>

<p>"And a cruel, ruthless venal beast under all his smooth
manners. Every one on the staff loathed him. So he stole
groceries for his shop, did he? Wilmot has always bragged about
belonging to some pious Catholic mother too devout to send him to
college. Educated by a tutor, and all that! And all the time he
had been a drunken little manager in a filthy slum!"</p>

<p>Newnes had always had a thorough dislike of the special
correspondent.</p>

<p>"I rather think he was writing, not drinking, in his locked
room," Pointer thought, "he may have been getting into touch with
editors even in those days. Oddly enough, there was a penny
bazaar not far away, I studied the old ordnance map, called
Wilmot's Bazaar. Very likely he took his pen-name from that."</p>

<p>"I'll find out when his articles were first heard of," Newnes
promised himself.</p>

<p>"Well, as a matter of fact," Haviland confided slowly, "I
thought his manner beside Mrs. Tangye's coffin very uncalled for.
His joking and smoking&mdash;but I thought it just his way."</p>

<p>"His yarn about Hart being the Professor's secretary was
rather thin," Newnes looked up long enough to hazard.</p>

<p>"Had it been cast-iron it would have made no difference.
Wilmot didn't guess that we knew all about the Professor's
household after hearing that he had bought a Lux camera. He has
no secretary here. He has a room and a typist at Sentinel House.
For added proof&mdash;if one can have such a thing&mdash;I puffed
one of my fingerprint cigarettes over the papers on his desk.
Wilmot's prints are there clear and plain."</p>

<p>"But when did you get Wilmot's prints?" Haviland puzzled. "I
thought you didn't suspect him as a matter of fact till just
now."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I was remiss enough not to suspect you either,
Haviland," Pointer acknowledged with a faint laugh. "There was no
more reason to suspect Wilmot than any other man south of the
Cheviots. But I took all our prints, so that if need should
arise, I could sift out our three from any I might be interested
in. Wilmot left his on a liqueur glass one night when we dined
together."</p>

<p>"And how long has this been going on?" asked Newnes. "Why did
Wilmot start being Orison in the first place?"</p>

<p>"Ah, why! I shouldn't be surprised&mdash;between
ourselves&mdash;if this weren't the first crime that Wilmot has
committed. Orison has only been known to be in existence about
three years.</p>

<p>"You remember the steamboat murder as it was called, just
three years ago? Norton had the case. It was never solved.
Rajah's son found murdered and some thousands of pounds of Bearer
bonds missing? Wilmot was one of the party I now remember. I
shouldn't wonder if Norton will be able to make some connections
when he hears of this. As to Orison's success, Wilmot is an
uncommonly brainy chap. Also he chose a field where a flow of
language does instead of facts, I take it. I mean metaphysics,
and so on."</p>

<p>Pointer had never been able to master that subject.</p>

<p>"Yes, Orison&mdash;in case of need&mdash;would make a very
useful second incarnation of Wilmot. Or third, if we call him
Hart. He knew how to meet the right people, too," the Chief
Inspector went on.</p>

<p>"And he knew how to advertise, none better," Newnes said
contemptuously. "I wondered why the Polish Professor was so to
the fore in every report of social things. Wilmot would be able
to arrange that without any one being the wiser. But about just
now&mdash;how did he manage to tie himself up like that? I never
saw such a piece of work."</p>

<p>"A series of granny's hitches. A useful fisherman's knot,
which you tie loosely and can pull tight. The loose end was
fastened to the bedpost, so that the further he worked his chair
away, the tighter everything went. That was part of what made him
thump about so."</p>

<p>"But those wrinkles!" Newnes murmured when he had got the
outlines down, "they really looked impossible to doubt."</p>

<p>"They're real enough&mdash;while they last. I've made them
myself. But that, Newnes, isn't for publication. Just forget
Orison's make-up."</p>

<p>"But how's it done. Between ourselves?"</p>

<p>"There's a very common substance, which, mixed with gelatine
and allowed to harden into a jelly, can be liquefied in a second
with hot water. You paint it on with a brush, or sponge it on. As
it dries&mdash;it takes only a minute by an open window&mdash;it
contracts the skin into a thousand puckers. It can only be washed
off in very hot water. That was what I was on my way to do when
Olive ran out."</p>

<p>Haviland stared. So did Newnes.</p>

<p>"Well, Orison's appearance so obviously lent itself to the
idea of a disguise, once you thought of it in that light, and
knew about that wrinkle-making dodge. I intended to call on him,
have him ask me to tea, and then&mdash;well&mdash;I shouldn't
wonder if he had found himself feeling suddenly rather faint. I
should have got close enough to him to make sure whether that
skin was natural or not. You can tell the manufactured article
when you know what signs to look for. Vardon, who has been quite
definitely <i>not</i> identified by the Newport choirmaster, was
coming along to see if he could recognise the voice. I thought
Orison might possibly be Oliver Headly. And Vardon knew Oliver. I
think one of the reasons Orison wanted to be off, was that he had
made himself up rather hurriedly. After all, Miss Ash would stare
at him as you and I would."</p>

<p>Newnes got up, his wad of notes in his hand.</p>

<p>"Of all the tales to spin! You knew he was engaged to Lord
Vibart's daughter, I suppose? <i>Secret de polichitselle.</i> It
was to be announced at Christmas."</p>

<p>"So that was it," Pointer said thoughtfully. "A smart, and, I
suppose, wealthy marriage?"</p>

<p>"Rather She was left half shares in the paper by her
grandfather who started it, you know. Her husband could become
one of the most influential men in England if he had brains.
That's why Lord Vibart is said to've finally given his consent.
No one can deny that Wilmot has brains."</p>

<p>"High stakes!" Pointer was looking through the papers in the
writing-table as he talked.</p>

<p>"No other kind would attract Wilmot in fact," Haviland
thought.</p>

<p>"Yes," Pointer went on, "it must have been a blow when he met
his wife. Undoubtedly he believed her drowned, and with her all
record of those sordid early years."</p>

<p>"Miss Vibart is a beautiful girl," Newnes said. "She's
supposed to be most frightfully in love with him. He's very
successful with women, you know."</p>

<p>"Beautiful? Wilmot would like that too." Pointer was rapidly
glancing at a pile of papers in front of him. Haviland was doing
the same.</p>

<p>"Well, she's had an escape second only to Miss Ash's." Pointer
lit his pipe. "But one can imagine the shock it must have been to
Wilmot to discover that he was, after all, still tied to a
penniless woman of no particular family or influence. Mr.
Branscombe left everything he had to his 'wife.' I doubt if she
could have kept a penny of his money. And I feel sure she
wouldn't have, finally. Altogether the fact that she was alive
meant the utter ruin of all Wilmot's plans. No wonder he had to
work quickly."</p>

<p>"To think that when I pulled him out of the train at Victoria,
he had just come away from a murder!" Newnes looked stirred. "He
was a fine actor, and no mistake!"</p>

<p>"Every criminal must be, or go under at once," Pointer threw
in with but little enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Newnes bustled off.</p>

<p>"What's much more thrilling&mdash;to me&mdash;" Pointer said
grimly, "is the thought that if I had detected any make-up in the
Professor's appearance on close inspection, I intended to tell
you and Wilmot of him to-night. Nice little surprise it would
have been for Wilmot!"</p>

<p>"In point of fact, sir," Haviland rubbed his chin
appreciatively, "he didn't miss any of the surprise. Last glimpse
I had of him his eyes were still popping out of their sockets.
Neatest thing of its kind I ever saw done! So it was Wilmot whom
Mrs. Tangye met at Tunbridge," Haviland was trying to get the
facts clear.</p>

<p>"Must have been."</p>

<p>The trial that ended Wilmot's earthly career, showed this to
have been the case. He had gone there idly, interested in the
unhealthy flowers to be exhibited, as anything abnormal drew him,
and come face to face with the wife whom he thought drowned long
ago.</p>

<p>"And he probably started as Wilmot from town, though Professor
Orison arrived at Folkestone in time for dinner that evening.
Probably. At any rate, no Orison was noticed going down. And
considering how empty the carriages were, that seems odd. Wilmot
doubtless changed after the orchid-show, using an empty
compartment, as often do. His disguise would only take five
minutes at most. I expect we shall find the Professor had some
flat, or chambers, somewhere in town where little attention is
paid to the tenants' doings, and that Wilmot will have had rooms
or chambers adjoining, but with an entrance in another street.
With a very carefully concealed communicating door made, Orison
could come and Wilmot go, or vice versa." There was a little
pause.</p>

<p>"I rather fancy," Pointer was meditating aloud, "that when
Wilmot came to Riverview on Monday, he counselled that quarrel
between the husband and wife, hoping that it would be a violent
one. And would be overheard. Just in case things went crooked,
and the suicide, or accident theories should stick a bit."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," Haviland ruminated, "it must have been
ticklish work listening to you unrolling the crime, and not have
been able to throw you off the track, Chief Inspector. And I see
that you're right in saying that a man can't hide, or bury, or do
away with clues that only exist in the mind." Haviland began to
realise the possible advantages of reasoning over trailing.</p>

<p>"He would have liked to throw suspicion on Tangye, had it been
safe. I think that was subconscious jealousy working."</p>

<p>Pointer was right in that idea. Just as it was subconscious
jealousy on his own part which made him so determined that Vardon
should have more than fair play, should only be arrested on over-whelming proof.</p>

<p>"No wonder Wilmot wouldn't come along to Usk," the Chief
Inspector said, thinking back. "Nor down to Tunbridge Wells. Nor
meet Miss Eden. He was playing safety first."</p>

<p>"Nor attend the funeral even," Haviland added. "As a matter of
fact, I don't envy his feelings when Miss Ash came in with the
news of that portrait group."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think he rather enjoyed the excitement it gave him. He
had still a good, a very good chance of suppressing the portrait,
after getting rid of the two girls. And if there was any trouble,
Orison could be <i>spurlos versenkt.</i> Though except for Wilmot
there was no one to connect the Professor with the
girls&mdash;once his housekeeper had been silenced. He drove them
here himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think he meant to do things on the grand scale. It was
his one chance. Then, if all went well, Orison would probably
have faded away in time. He's been less and less before the
public of late. I think Wilmot was tiring of him, and&mdash;if he
was concerned in that steamboat murder&mdash;began to feel
himself quite safe."</p>

<p>"Was his housekeeper in it all?"</p>

<p>"She was in his power, at any rate. I don't think there's much
doubt of that. She would do, as well as say, whatever he told
her. From the way she eyed the constable when he came in with
Olive, I knew she had had trouble with the police before."</p>

<p>"Newnes was right in saying that he was an actor. Who ever
would have guessed, without some reason for it, that the
Professor was anything other than a weak, old gentleman. And his
story about his double all so neat and pat!"</p>

<p>"Humph! I was very careful not to tackle that double. The last
thing I wanted was a crack in his plating. As to the note of age,
Orison forced that. It could be put down to shock. But it also
let him hobble about. Wilmot has a catch in his step. Did you
notice it when I was telling the Assistant Commissioner and you
two about the Hart marriage? It only seems to come when he's
greatly excited&mdash;some sort of nerve spasm apparently. He
stepped to the window to look out. I heard it then for the first
time. This afternoon, he couldn't walk without it. And there's
his poor sight...That single eyeglass of his is for use, as much
as for show. Nor have I ever heard of his being even a fair
shot."</p>

<p>Pointer rose. Orison's writing-table had yielded nothing. He
had done the arrested murderer the justice not to expect that it
would.</p>

<p>"No wonder Wilmot was such an authority on criminals. No
wonder he could enter so well into their minds. He was himself,
that hero beloved of some fiction-writers, the super-criminal.
Come, Haviland, we have all the proof we need without hunting for
it. This second murder&mdash;attempted murder&mdash;proves the
authorship of the first. If more proof were needed than we have
already and can get elsewhere. Yes, Miss Ash has been of more
help than I would have believed possible. Consciously and
unconsciously. Yet I can truthfully say that I hope to Heaven no
amateur will ever assist a case of mine in quite the same way
again. After all, risk is what you and I are paid for. It's part
of the routine. But to see that gentle girl hanging there&mdash;"
Pointer drew hard on his pipe.</p>

<p>"To think that the steps Olive heard were Wilmot's!" Haviland
chose his fattest cigar as most sustaining. He felt that he
needed support. "In fact, 'the footsteps that stopped' have been
close beside us all the time. Walking along with us, and the
case."</p>

<p>"They're stopped now," Pointer's face was ruthless, "or soon
will be. They'll walk no more in any victim's garden."</p>

<p>"And that's a fact," Haviland said solemnly, as they shut the
door behind them.</p>
