<p><span class="aa">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my dear
sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="aa">I cannot</span> allow the following Sketch to
go forth to the Proprietors of the Van Diemen's Land Company and
to the Public, without making some, though very inadequate,
acknowledgement of the obligations which are due to you for your
constant and unwearied attention to the interests of that Company
from its commencement. Your time has on all occasions been
devoted to them; your experience and excellent judgment have
greatly contributed to encourage Edward Curr, Esq., the chief
agent in Van Diemen's Land, in his arduous duties, than whom few
men have had to contend against greater trials, but they have
been surmounted by his prudence, firmness, and talent. He has
invariably met with the support of yourself, Joseph Cripps, Esq.,
Deputy-Governor, and the Directors, which has enabled him to
overcome many difficulties, and, by unremitting steadiness and
perseverance, to place the concerns of the Company in their
present satisfactory condition.</p>
<p>The advantage of your advice and exertion has been equally
felt at home; you preside over a Court of Directors, not
surpassed in weight and respectability by any in London, drawn
together by the large stake they individually hold, and by the
confidence placed in them by the Proprietors. The prosperity of
the Company has been their only object, private feeling and
private interest have invariably given way to the general good,
every question has been discussed with candour, and the good
humour and those friendly feelings which prevail, render the
meetings of Directors pleasant and efficient. To yourself the
Company is much indebted. May you long live to witness the
harmony and the increasing success of these exertions.</p>
<p>I cannot close this address without also expressing my sincere
and heartfelt thanks for the kindness and attention invariably
received from yourself, Mr. Cripps, and the Directors, for the
generous confidence placed in me, and the assistance so
cheerfully and effectually rendered to me in the important and
sometimes difficult duties of my office: these have made an
impression which no time can efface. I have the honour to remain,
with great regard and respect.</p>
<p align="center">My dear Sir,</p>

obedient humble servant,</div>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="tenth">
<p><span class="aa">In</span> order to make the Proprietors of
the Van Diemen's Land Company acquainted with the country in
which they have invested their properly, it has been thought
desirable to give a brief Sketch of the History of that
interesting island, to point out some of the difficulties against
which early settlers have had to contend, the manner in which
they have been surmounted, and the prosperity which has resulted
from their industry and perseverance, that by comparing
themselves with other colonists, the Proprietors may be enabled
to form a just estimate of their prospects, not only from produce
which forms annual income, but from the increased and increasing
value of their permanent investment in land.</p>
<p>The review of the annals of Van Diemen's Land has been a
matter of no difficulty, being a compilation from very few books,
to which is added information derived from private letters and
from individuals who have visited the colony. The Compiler, not
having been there himself, is indebted altogether to the accounts
of others. It has required no research amongst ancient and
valuable manuscripts deposited in college libraries and the
British Museum, no knowledge of ancient language, or indeed of
any language, save his native tongue, for the space of time which
this History embraces is confined to the life of man. Fifty years
have scarcely elapsed since our great navigator. Captain Cook,
visited the Southern Ocean, made known to the world the accession
of its immense continent, with numerous beautiful and fruitful
islands, and the British settler who first set foot in Van
Diemen's Land, A. Riley, Esq., a respectable London merchant, is
yet amongst us.</p>
<p>We are still in the dark as to many most essential points in
natural history; the visiters to and writers upon Australia have
not possessed that scientific knowledge which has enabled them to
give a philosophical account of the character and properties of
its productions. A rich field is here open for science; the
peculiar nature of the animal world so totally different in some
particulars from that of Europe, has not been sufficiently
studied by the anatomist; the properties of the vegetable have
not yet undergone the searching analysis of the chemist, and the
mineral world has not been laid open to the geologist. Still,
however, much valuable information is given in the works of Curr,
Evans, Widowson, the anonymous writer of "The Picture of
Australia," and of "An Account of Van Diemen's Land," lately
published at Calcutta; to which must be added, "The Van Diemen's
Land Anniversary, or Hobart Town Almanac." From these books, the
Compiler of the following sheets has made copious extracts; but
if the Proprietors wish to become thoroughly acquainted with the
subject, each should supply himself with those publications, it
being impossible by any extracts to do justice to them.</p>
<p>After this brief and imperfect History of the Island, the
Compiler has given some account of the present system of carrying
into effect secondary punishment by sentence of transportation,
comparing it with the manner in which convicts were formerly
treated, in order to shew that it has now not only become an
incentive and a premium to crime at home, but places the criminal
in a much better situation than the honest, industrious, but poor
emigrant. And in conclusion, the Compiler has given some account
of the establishment and progress of the Van Diemen's Land
Company, adding an Appendix containing extracts from
Parliamentary Papers, giving much interesting information
respecting the Aborigines of Van Diemen's Land.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p align="center">
Discovery&mdash;History&mdash;Shores&mdash;Rivers&mdash;Lakes&mdash;Character&mdash;Surface&mdash;Soil&mdash;Climate.</p>
<p>"<span class="aa">The</span> existence of New Holland and Van
Diemen's Land was not known, with anything like certainty, till
long after the discovery of America, of the passage around the
Cape of Good Hope, and of the islands in the Indian seas, as far
as Timor, Ceram, and some parts of the coast of New Guinea. There
are some disputes, or at least obscurities, as to the time of the
original discovery and the nation that made it. The French
writers on Australian voyages, the president De Brosses and the
Abbé Prévot, claim the merit for a countryman of their own.
Captain Paulovier Gonneville, who sailed from Honfleur in the
month of June 1503, was caught in a furious tempest off the Cape,
lost his reckoning, and drifted in an unknown sea, from which he
escaped by observing that the flight of birds was towards the
south; and following them. Gonneville lived six months on the
land, to which he gave the name of Southern India; and during the
time, he occupied himself in refitting his vessel, and at the
same time carried on a friendly intercourse with the natives,
whom he mentions as having made some advances in civilization.
Now all the more recent voyagers who have visited the north
coasts of New Holland and had a sight of the natives, (we can
hardly call it intercourse,) represent them as being without the
very first elements of civilization, and so treacherous and cruel
in their dispositions, that no friendly terms could be kept with
them. These considerations, and the additional one that, from the
French captain's account, the people on whose island he lived
were very like the inhabitants of Madagascar, render it almost
certain that that was the island on which he spent the six
months." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Picture of Australia.]</p>
<p>Portugal next claims the discovery. It is stated, that in the
Library of the Carthusian Friars at Evora, there exists an
authentic manuscript atlas of all the countries in the world,
with richly emblazoned maps, made by Ternao Vaz Dourado,
cosmographer in Goa, in 1570. In one of the maps is laid down the
northern coast of Australia, with a note: This coast was
discovered by Ternao de Magathæus, a native of Portugal, in the
year 1520.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* East India Magazine.]</p>
<p>"It is probable, that in the early part of the sixteenth
century, the Dutch or the Portuguese, in their way to or from the
Spice Islands, may have discovered part of the coast; and in an
old French chart, dedicated to the King of England, with an
English copy, date 1542, in the British Museum, a portion of
coast to the south of the Spice Islands is laid down and named
Great Java, but whether it be New Holland or New Guinea is not
known. The position of some of the coasts certainly gives it a
resemblance to the north-east of New Holland, which could hardly
be the result of accident</p>
<p>"In 1605, the Duyfhen, Dutch yacht, sailed from Bantam, in
Java, for the purpose of exploring New Guinea; and from the
account given, both of the country and the people, (who killed
part of the crew,) it is evident that the main land of New
Holland, to the south-west of Cape York, was seen in 1606.</p>
<p>"But the first certain discovery was of the west coast, by the
Dutch, in 1616. The French expedition of discovery, sent out in
1801, found upon Dirk Hartog's Island, off Shank Bay, in latitude
about 25° S., a pewter plate, which settled the point. It bore
two inscriptions by different persons, and at different times.
The first was, '1616, on the 25th of October, the ship Endraght,
of Amsterdam, arrived here, Captain Dirk Hartog, of Amsterdam.'
The second inscription was to this effect: '1697. on the 4th of
February, the ship Geelvink, of Amsterdam, arrived here, Wilhelm
de Vlaming, Captain-Commandant,' and mentions two other vessels
with her." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Picture of Australia.]</p>
<p>The island of Van Diemen's Land was first visited in the year
1643, by the Dutch navigator Abel Jansen Tasman, who gave its
name in honour of Anthony Van Diemen, at that time
Governor-General of the Dutch possessions in the East Indies.
Captain Furneaux, in the Adventure, who accompanied Captain Cook
on his second voyage round the world, visited it in 1773; he is
supposed to have been the first Englishman who set foot In the
island, and gave the name of his ship, 'Adventure', to the bay he
entered.</p>
<p>Van Diemen's Land lies between the parallel of 40° 20" and 43°
40" south latitude, and between the meridian of 144° 30" and 148°
30" east longitude; its extent, from north to south, is about 200
miles, and from east to west, about 160 miles, containing an area
of about 15,000,000 superficial square acres of land, or having a
surface about equal to the size of Ireland.</p>
<p>Captain Cook touched at Van Diemen's Land on his third voyage
in 1777; he cast anchor in Adventure Bay, and took in wood and
water. He, however, supposed it to be the most southern part of
New Holland; his expression is, "I hardly need say, that it is
the southern point of New Holland, which, if it doth not deserve
the name of a continent, is by far the largest island in the
world." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Cook's Voyages.]</p>
<p>"Dr. Bass, in 1798, discovered that Van Diemen's Land was an
island, separated from New Holland by a strait now bearing his
name.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Bowen landed on the east bank of the Derwent in
1803, and first took possession of the island.</p>
<p>"Colonel Collins, the first Lieutenant-Governor, arrived in
1804, established himself on the west side of the river Derwent,
and formed a settlement, giving it the name of Hobart Town; the
limits of three counties were defined, viz., Northumberland,
Cornwall, and Buckinghamshire.</p>
<p>"Colonel Patterson arrived in the river Tamar, from Sydney, in
the same year, and pitched his tent on a plain on the west bank
of that river.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant-Governor Collins died, at Hobart Town, in 1810,
and from that time till 1813, the government of the colony was
administered by different military officers, as they successively
had the command.</p>
<p>"The second Lieutenant-Governor, Colonel Davey, arrived at
Hobart Town in 1813; the ports were then first opened to
commerce, and put upon the same footing as those of New South
Wales, merchant ships having been prohibited from entering the
harbours." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Van Diemen's Land Almanack.]</p>
<p>The third lieutenant-Governor, Colonel Sorell, was appointed
in 1817, a man of liberal and enlightened mind, eminently
qualified for developing the character and resources of the
island. Under his government, the nature of the country, the
fertility of the soil, and its various capabilities and products
were made known; and, in 1819, the emigration of free settlers
from England first commenced. That may indeed be considered the
period from which its prosperity took its rise; since then the
beneficial effects of industry and capital have been displayed;
Englishmen are now established on lands which had recently been
the range of the kangaroo, and the hunting ground of the wretched
savage, who, without domicile, wandered about in precarious
search of food; forests are now brought under cultivation and
stocked with herds of cattle and flocks of sheep. A great portion
of the island already answers the beautiful description of the
poet:</p>
<p class="poem">"On spacious airy downs and gentle hills<br>
With grass and thyme o'erspread, and clover wild,<br>
Where smiling Ph&oelig;bus tempers every breeze,<br>
The fairest flocks rejoice."</p>
<p align="right"><span class="aa">dyer's
fleece.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the government of Colonel Sorell, roads were cut through
the woods from the south to the north extremity of the island,
from Hobart Town to Port Dalrymple, as well as between other
chief settlements in the interior.</p>
<p>The present Lieutenant-Governor, Colonel Arthur, succeeded
Colonel Sorell, in 1824; a man in every way well qualified to
pursue the judicious plans of his predecessor. Devoting all the
energies of a strong and enlarged mind to advance the permanent
prosperity of the colony placed under his charge, he has visited
different parts of the island, caused roads and bridges to be
constructed, and has divided the settled part of the country on
the east side of the island into nine police districts, viz.,
Hobart Town, Norfolk, Richmond, Clyde, Oatlands, Oyster Bay,
Campbell Town, Launceston, and Norfolk Plains.</p>
<p>Till this period the island of Van Diemen's Land, though
having a lieutenant-governor, was under the government of New
South Wales; but, in 1825, it was, by royal proclamation,
declared independent thereof, the lieutenant-governor acting from
orders transmitted to him from the colonial department.</p>
<p>Respecting the general character of the island, much valuable
information is given in the Hobart Town Almanack for 1831,
published by Dr. Ross. These animals are equally interesting to
the inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land and to Europeans at home.
The following particulars are extracted from that work:</p>
<p>"The general character of the surface of Van Diemen's Land is
hilly and mountainous, the hills being mostly covered with trees
to the height of between three and four thousand feet, where the
difference of climate in that lofty and exposed region checks
vegetation, and exposes to the eye, as the mountains rise upon
the horizon, a comparatively naked and weather born barren
aspect, being for five or six months in the year, from April till
October, more or less covered with snow.</p>
<p>"This hilly character of the country, especially on the
southern side of the island, admits but of little interruption.
The hills are not only frequent but continuously so, the general
face of the island being a never ending succession of hill and
dale: the traveller no sooner arrives at the bottom of one hill
than he has to ascend another, often three or four times in the
space of one mile, while at other times the land swells up into
greater heights, reaching along several miles of ascent. The
level parts, marshes or plains, as they are called in the colony,
giving relief to this fatiguing surface, are comparatively few.
The reader, however, must not conclude either that the hills of
the island are all sterile or the plains all fertile; on the
contrary, though most of the large hills and mountains are either
too steep and rocky, or too thickly covered with timber, to admit
of cultivation, a large proportion of the more moderately sized
hills and gentler undulations are thickly covered with herbage,
presenting to the view an agreeable succession of moderately
wooded downs, and affording excellent pasture for sheep and
cattle. Altogether, and on the most liberal computation, the
productive surface of the island cannot fairly be estimated at
more than one-third. To one accustomed to the moist climate and
plentifully watered countries of England, Scotland, and Ireland,
Van Diemen's Land, at first sight, may present a dry and
unproductive appearance; but upon a nearer acquaintance, it will
put on a more inviting aspect." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Hobart Town Almanack.]</p>
<p>"The shores of Van Diemen's Land are much more bold in their
general character than those of New Holland, and at some points
they afford scenery as grand as can be found in any part of the
world. One of the most remarkable characteristics of the seas
around Australia is the numerous islands with which they are
studded, and the small elevation of most of them above the level
of the sea. On the shores of Van Diemen's Land these islands are
sometimes of a different character, being pyramids of rock
presenting a columnar or basaltic appearance; on the south, some
of them also partake of the high and cliffy nature of that coast.
In glancing over a correct chart of the Australian seas, there
are several places where the formation of islands is more than
ordinarily conspicuous. Bass's Straits is full of them, and
soundings are met with, at no very great depths, in all the
channels. These islands indicate the continuation or a submarine
ridge from the termination of the eastern mountains of Van
Diemen's Land at Cape Portland to the high land of Wilson's
promontory in New Holland; and probably this is the only place at
which New Holland can be traced as having a geological connexion
with any other land, unless indeed we consider that there is a
similar connexion between Cape Grim on the south entrance to
Bass's Straits, and Cape Otway on the north-west of the coast
Such a connexion, though not quite so continuous as the former,
may be traced by Hunter's Islands on Van Diemen's Land coast, to
King's Island in the middle of the channel."</p>
<p>"The principal harbours are in the Derwent and the Tamar, to
which must now be added Circular Head and Woolnorth, a very good
channel having been recently discovered there, which will admit a
vessel of 500 tons burden, and nothing else was wanted to make
the harbour safe and desirable.</p>
<p>"Around Van Diemen's Land the winds are generally from the
west and south, and the ports, more especially the Derwent, are
accessible at all seasons.</p>
<p>"The two principal rivers, the Tamar in the north, and the
Derwent in the south, overlay each other, the remotest source of
the Derwent being within fifty miles of the north coast, and that
of the Macquarrie, the most remote branch of the Tamar, being not
more than forty miles from the tide-way in the Derwent and Coal
rivers. The country midway between the mouths of the two rivers,
is not what can, strictly speaking, be called mountainous, though
it is considerably elevated. One of the most remarkable of its
characteristics is, that between the sources of the Macquarrie,
which runs to the Tamar, and those of the Jordan, which runs to
the Derwent, there is a salt plain. In that plain there are three
pools or hollows which are filled with water during the rainy
season, but which are dried up by evaporation when the rains are
over; and so strongly is the water of these hollows, and
consequently the soil over which it flows and through which it
percolates, impregnated with salt, that a considerable quantity
is collected every season for domestic purposes.</p>
<p>"As the entrance of the river Tamar is approached, the country
becomes fertile down to the water's edge, and forms a pleasant
contrast to the dry and sandy shores of New Holland. The estuary
of the Tamar is navigable much further into the interior than any
of the rivers in New Holland: it winds considerably, and there
are some banks in it, but the tide rises fifteen feet at
Launceston, which is forty-three miles from the sea. The land on
the banks of this river is in many places very good, and in
general is well wooded.</p>
<p>"The branches of the Derwent indicate an extensive valley or
series of smaller valleys connected with that river. The breadth
from the most easterly sources of the Jordan to the western
mountains, is not less than eighty miles in a straight line; and
the length from the remotest source to Hobart Town, is about 150,
so that that river drains an extent of 12,000 square miles of
country, and though there be occasional mountains and
unproductive places, the general character of that extensive
district is fertility. At Hobart Town, the valley of the Derwent
may be said to terminate, for though the entrance be full forty
miles further before the open sea is reached, the heights
connected with Mount Wellington close up the valley on the west,
and the Coal River Comes near to the Derwent on the east.</p>
<p>"The fresh water which gets the name of Derwent, is not the
principal branch, but one that comes from the western mountains;
the one which is, as it were, the main stem of the river is the
Ouse, which rises about forty miles from the north coast, and the
same distance from the west.</p>
<p>"About the parallel of 42 degrees south, there are a number of
lakes, the largest is Lake Arthur, estimated at about fifteen
miles long and five broad; that lake is the source of the
Shannon, the first branch that fells into the Ouse on the east
side. The Clyde and the Jordan arc the other principal branches
on the east side; they both originate in lakes and marshes, and
the plains through which they pass, more especially those on the
Jordan, are very fertile and beautiful.</p>
<p>"The Macquarrie, which has its source near those of the Clyde
and the Jordan, is the largest branch of the Tamar. The grounds
through which it passes are in general rich, as are also those on
the banks of the South Esk, which rises in the eastern mountains
near Tasman's Peak, and flows towards the north-west. The North
Esk is the other principal branch of the Tamar: it joins the
South Esk at Launceston, and is a romantic little river, but its
course is too precipitous and is not available for the purposes
of navigation." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Picture of Australia.]</p>
<p>The rivers and streams which intersect the island in every
direction on the north-west quarter of Van Diemen's Land, are
frequent; the Avon, Mersey, Don, Forth, Leven, Blythe, Emu, Cam,
Inglis, Detention, intervene betwixt the Tamar and Circular Head;
and between that and Cape Grim Head, are Dutch River, Montague,
Harcus, and Welcome. All these, rising far in the interior of the
island, empty themselves into Bass's Straits, whilst the Hellyer
and the Arthur rising the Surrey Hills, fall into the Indian
Ocean, on the western coast. Some of these numerous streams will
probably serve for internal navigation, they are of infinite use
in fertilizing the large extent of country through which they
pass; but the navigation at their mouths is interrupted in
general by bars, over which vessels drawing more than four feet
water cannot pass. The principal harbours on the north-west coast
of the island are Emu Bay, Circular Head, and Woolnorth.</p>
<p>"Few, if any, attempts have yet been made to classify or
analyse the mineral productions composing the superficial strata
or subsoil of the island. Limestone is almost the only one that
has yet been brought into general use; this requisite of
civilized life has been found in abundance in most parts, with
the exception of the neighbourhood of Launceston, to which place
it is usually imported from Sydney, as a return cargo, in the
vessels that carry up wheat to that port. Marble of a white mixed
grey colour, susceptible of a good polish, has frequently been
found, though never yet dug up or applied to use. Iron ore is
very general, of a red, browti, and black colour; in one or two
instances it has been analysed, and found to contain eighty per
cent of the perfect mineral; it also occurs, though more rarely
and in smaller quantities, under the form of red chalk, with
which, mixed with grease, the Aborigines besmear their heads and
bodies. Indications of coat have been found all across the
island. Of the various species of the argillaceous genus, basalt
is by far the most abundant, indeed it would appear to be the
chief and predominant substratum in the island; all along the
coast it presents itself in rocky precipitous heights, standing
on its beautiful columnar pedestals; of these. Fluted Cape at
Adventure Bay is perhaps the most remarkable, so called from the
circular columns standing up close together, in the form of the
barrel of an organ. Circular Head, which gives the name to the
Van Diemen's Land Company's establishment, is another remarkable
instance of the singular appearance which this species of rock
puts on, resembling different artificial productions of man. That
curious rock stands like a huge round tower or fortress, built by
human hands, which stretching out into the sea, as if from the
middle of a bay, is joined to the land by a narrow isthmus, and
has a small creek on each side. In some parts, both on the coast
and in the interior, the columns stand in insulated positions,
springing up from the grass or the ocean, like obelisks or huge
needles, and presenting a singular appearance to the eye. As
basaltic rock has the power of acting on the magnetic needle, and
occurs in such large masses, it in some measure accounts for the
variations which travellers, depending upon the guidance of the
pocket compass, when in the bush, sometimes experience. Argil
also appears in the form of excellent roof slate; and in that of
mica, it is in large masses. Excellent sandstone, for building,
is found in every part of the island. Flints, in great plenty,
are scattered upon the hills. Other rare species of the silicious
genus have been found in different parts of the island,
especially in those which appear to have been washed, in former
times, by the ocean, and which have been deposited in certain
ranges or linear positions, by the lashing of the waves and the
subsiding of the waters; of these may be mentioned, though found
generally in small pieces, hornstone, schistus, wood-opal,
bloodstone, jasper, and that singular species called the
cat's-eye, reflecting different rays of light from the change of
position.</p>
<p>"Of the metallic ores, besides iron, which is most abundant,
specimens of chromate of iron, of red and green copper ore, lead,
zinc, manganese, and some say of silver and gold, have
occasionally been found, but the latter, we think, is not to be
relied on.</p>
<p>"Petrified remains of wood and other vegetable productions,
entirely converted into silicious matter, and capable of the
finest polish, are occasionally met with.</p>
<p>"According to the latitude of Van Diemen's Land, it ought to
enjoy a climate equal to that of the southern parts of France or
the northern parts of Spain and Italy, along the coasts of the
Mediterranean; but the general temperature of a country is
affected by other circumstances besides that of latitude, and
geographers have generally agreed that the great extent of
uninterrupted ocean round the south pole, compared to that of the
northern hemisphere, where land so much more abounds, makes a
difference in the climate equal to several degrees of latitude.
It would appear that this difference is scarcely sensible, under
the fortieth degree of latitude; for while the summer heats of
Buenos Ayres, the Cape of Good Hope, and Sydney, are as great as
at Gibraltar, Tunis, or Charleston, or Bermuda in America;
Patagonia, New Zealand, and Van Diemen's Land have a temperature
almost as cold in the summer season as that of London, Brussels,
or at least Paris and Vienna. While, therefore. Van Diemen's Land
has a portion of the sun's rays and a length of day equal to that
enjoyed by the inhabitants of Rome, Constantinople, or Madrid, in
the mildest winter, its summer heats are so moderated as to be
not only congenial, but delightful, to a person who has lived to
maturity in an English climate, and whose system has been
habituated to it; however warm the middle of the day may be, it
is invariably attended by a morning and evening so cool, as
completely to brace the body and counteract any enervating
effects that the meridian beat might have occasioned; and while
the summer heat is thus moderated, the inclemency of winter is
dissipated by the equality of temperature diffused from the
extent of ocean surrounding its insular position.</p>
<p>"Except on the days when rain actually falls, which, on an
average, do not exceed fifty or sixty in the year, the sky is
clear and the sun brilliant, the atmosphere is consequently, for
the most part, dry, pure, and elastic, which renders the system
in a great measure insensible to the sudden changes of
temperature that so frequently occur. In the winter, the frost at
night, except in the higher regions of the interior, or in some
deep dell, where the sun's rays scarcely ever reach, is never so
severe as to withstand the heat of the ensuing day. Sleet or snow
generally falls once or twice a year, but never lies on the
ground above a day or two, except on the tops of the mountains or
in the central parts of the island, where it has been known to
continue for a week or ten days.</p>
<p>"In so clear a sky, as might be supposed, the serenity of the
starlight and moonlight nights calls forth the notice and
admiration of every one susceptible of the charms of nature; few
parts of the globe are more favourable for obtaining a knowledge
of the constellations, or for alluring the young to the
delightful science of astronomy. A summer's morning, at all times
beautiful in the country, is peculiarly so in Van Diemen's Land.
In such a climate, and with the active life which settlers in a
new colony must necessarily lead, the health of the inhabitants,
as might be supposed, is of the best kind.</p>
<p>"On the whole, it may be fairly estimated from all the
experience that the present young state of the colony affords,
that the chances of life and longevity are twenty per cent,
better in Van Diemen's Land than in England." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Van Diemen's Land Almanack.]</p>
<p>A book was published at Calcutta, in 1830, giving an account
of Van Diemen's Land, principally intended for the use of persons
residing in India, and shewing the advantages it holds out to
them for their residence; the following is extracted from that
work.</p>
<p>"Its climate seems so well adapted to the renovating of the
constitution of those who have suffered from their residence in
India, that it only requires to be pointed out, and the easiest
manner of getting there made known, as also the cheapness and
comfort of living, when there, to turn the tide of visitors to
the Cape and the Isle of France, towards its shores.</p>
<p>"Many, also, who have saved what would only afford a bare
existence in England, or indeed any part of Europe, might, with
the addition of their pension, live with the greatest comfort in
this country; but are deterred from making the experiment, from
the little faith that can generally be put in the publications on
emigration; and from the want of correct information on points
having a direct reference to their own peculiar circumstances and
previous habits of life." *</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="quote" align="center">Natural
Productions&mdash;Progress of Cultivation&mdash;Aborigines.</p>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> natural productions of the island
are well described by Mr. Widowson in his work containing much
valuable information. The following is extracted chiefly from
it.</p>
<p>"The stringy bark is perhaps one of the most useful trees in
the island; it is found in low swampy places, and grows from
forty to seventy feet high; it is a hard straight grained wood,
and principally used in building and fencing; the bark, which
serves as a covering for splitters and sawyers is easily
separated from the wood in immense large strips.</p>
<p>"The blue gum is found in greater abundance; it is a loose
grained heavy wood and grows to an immense size. The lesser trees
have been frequently used for masts for small vessels, and are
found to answer well; the greater number of colonial boats are
built of blue gum; the oars are made of the same wood, but they
appear to retain their natural moisture for years, as they sink
instantly when dropped into the water. This wood is also used for
building purposes, but requires to be particularly well seasoned;
when dry it is extremely tough and durable.</p>
<p>"The peppermint, so called from the leaves imparting to the
taste that flavour, grows every where throughout the island. This
tree is of very little use except for shingles; in the forests,
it may be sometimes seen rearing its lofty head conspicuously
above the rest to a surprising height.</p>
<p>"The black and silver wattle (the <em>mimosa</em>) are trees
used in house-work and furniture; but from their diminutive size
are not much sought after. The bark of the former is exported to
England in large quantities. The mimosa bears immense branches of
yellow flowers, in the spring they have a most beautiful
appearance, and would form a delightful contrast to an English
chestnut.</p>
<p>"The ground saplings grow in clumps resembling our ash-poles
in form, and may be easily converted to the same uses.</p>
<p>"Huon pine is by far the most beautiful wood found in the
island; it is very superior both in colour and substance to the
Norway deal, but is scarce and difficult to be had.</p>
<p>"Adventure Bay pine is found at the extremity of the deep bay
of that name; it is a species of pine adapted for house-work and
furniture, but is not common.</p>
<p>"The light wood found by the sides of creeks and swamps, grows
larger in the top than any tree of the same size; the wood is
extremely hard and light. Mill-wheel shafts and cogs are made
from this wood, and found to answer better than any other
kind.</p>
<p>"The cherry-tree is a small diminutive plant found on rocky
hills and poor land; it is more used for the fire than any thing
else. Gunstocks are made of it, but they do not last long.
Honeysuckle is found in various parts: the cherry, the oak, and
the honeysuckle are companions.</p>
<p>"The trees and forests of Tasmania (with but one exception,
the mimosa) rather diminish than add to the beauty of the
country; where they are thinly spread, the tops grow extremely
ugly, and bear not the slightest resemblance to the worst of our
oak and elm. Two or three of the larger kinds of tree shed their
outward bark instead of leaves, and slips forty or fifty feet
long are seen hanging down from the top to the bottom, presenting
a most unsightly appearance.</p>
<p>"The mimosa is by far the most beautiful and indeed the only
tree to which nature seems to have given the appearance of
ornament. All the native trees of Van Diemen's Land, are
evergreen.</p>
<p>"The shrubs of Tasmania are very numerous, and some of them
beautiful; a few have been transplanted from the forests and
scrubs to the pleasure grounds of the wealthy.</p>
<p>"The tea-tree grows in wet situations, and in clusters along
the banks of rivers and mountain streams; the leaves infused,
make a pleasant beverage, and with a little sugar form a most
excellent substitute for tea. The natives select their spears
from among the straightest and largest sticks of the tea-tree. Of
fruits there are none indigenous in the island worth noticing.
The native cherry, currant, cranberry, or any other are as
ungrateful as the crab of England. The musk-plant, the cotton
plant, the native myrtle, the human and others are the common
shrubs of the country; the currogong is sometimes found, its
inner bark may be manufactured into ropes.</p>
<p>"The native grasses of the island very for exceed those of any
other country, and if properly cultivated, would unquestionably
be most productive." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Widowson's Present State of Van Diemen's
Land.]</p>
<p>"Though some of the quadrupeds of Van Diemen's Land and New
South Wales have their teeth so constructed as to feed only on
grass, others have teeth adapted for the gnawing of bark, and
others again have canine teeth, and live upon animal food. They
differ in one striking particular from all the quadrupeds of the
other parts of the world, with the exception of one or two
genera, which are not very extensively diffused, being confined
to America and the south-east of Asia. The peculiarity of the
Australian quadrupeds, which may be taken as their distinguishing
characteristic, is the attachment of a sack or pouch of the
cuticle to the abdomen of the female, which partially in all
instances and entirely in most covers the teats and opens
anteriorly. Into the pouch the young are received in a small
formless and embryo state, and they remain fixed to the teats
till they are perfectly formed and have acquired 8 size
proportionate to that of the parent animal, at which time they
are detached, and the teat, which had previously been extended,
slender and probably reaching the stomach of the young animal,
becomes shortened, so that the young can then suck milky
nutriment like other mammalia.</p>
<p>"From this peculiarity in their formation, the whole class
have received the name of 'marsupiata,' or pouched animals,
without reference to the structure of their teeth, or the habits
of the genus or species." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Widowson's Present State of Van Diemen's
Land.]</p>
<p>"Kangaroos, of which there are three or four varieties,
constitute the grazing animals. Their characters, (and excepting
size and colour, their appearance,) are in all the species and
varieties nearly the same. The head is small, the month destitute
of canine teeth, the eyes large, and the ears erect and pointed.
The fore part and fore legs of the animal are small, the latter
being divided into five toes armed with strong claws. Towards the
hind quarters the whole of the race get comparatively thick and
strong, and the hind legs are long, powerful, and remark. ably
elastic. The hind feet are singularly formed, they terminate in
three toes, the central one remarkably long, and armed with a
claw. The bottom of the feet is covered with an elastic
substance, more abundant and yielding more readily to pressure
than that found on the foot of almost any other animal. Some idea
of the power of a kangaroo's hind leg may be formed from the fact
that the elasticity of the two legs is sufficient, without any
fulcrum, to throw an animal, weighing between two and three
hundred weight, a distance of sixty, or, it is said, sometimes
even ninety feet at a single bound, and that the instant the feet
touch the ground, the animal is elevated to another leap. The
tail is large and very muscular." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Picture of Australia.]</p>
<p>"There are three or four varieties of kangaroos; those most
common, and which furnish sport in the chase, are denominated the
forester and brush kangaroo. They grow to an immense size, and
have been known to weigh twelve stone. Kangaroos frequently herd
together; they are remarkably swift, and bound from fifteen to
twenty feet at first starting.</p>
<p>"The brush kangaroo is much smaller and frequents the scrubs
and rocky hills.</p>
<p>"The wallabee is not very common, although found in abundance
near the mountains; they seldom weigh more than twenty-five or
thirty pounds, and are much superior in flavour to any others of
the kangaroo species.</p>
<p>"There are two kinds of opossums, the large or grey, and the
ring-tailed; they are both very harmless, and in shape not unlike
the pole-cat They live in the hollow of trees, and feed upon the
leaves of the peppermint and young grass. The skins of these
animals are very beautiful.</p>
<p>"The kangaroo rat is a small inoffensive animal, and perfectly
distinct from the ordinary species of rat, indeed it may be
called the kangaroo in miniature; it is about the size of a wild
rabbit, and bounds exactly like a kangaroo.</p>
<p>"The bandicoot is as large as a rabbit. There are two kinds,
the rat and the rabbit bandicoot, they both burrow in the earth,
and live upon roots and plants. The flesh of the latter is white
and delicious.</p>
<p>"The opossum mouse is about the size of our largest barn
mouse, it is a fac simile of the opossum; when caught it soon
becomes very tame like the rest of the animals in the island.
Manna is the food they exist upon, they are exceedingly pretty,
and their skins impart the most agreeable aromatic scent.</p>
<p>"The native porcupine or echidna is not very common nor so
large as that found in America. It appears to be a species of
animal between the porcupine and hedge-hog; it is quite
harmless.</p>
<p>"The only animals that can be termed carnivorous, are the
small hyena, the devil, and the native cat. The hyena, or as it
is sometimes called the tiger, is about the size of a large
terrier. It frequents the wilds of Tasmania, and is scarcely
beard of in the located districts. "When sheep run in large
flocks near the mountains, these animals destroy a great many
lambs. The female produces five or six at a birth: the skin
resembles the striped hyena.</p>
<p>"The devil, or as naturalists term it, 'dasyurus ursinus,' is
very properly named, if it is meant as a designation for the most
forbidding and ugly of the animal creation. It is as great a
destroyer of young lambs as the hyena, and, generally speaking,
is as large as a middle sized dog. The head resembles that of an
otter in shape, but is out of proportion with the rest of the
body; the mouth is furnished with three rows of double teeth; the
legs are short with the feet similar to the cat, being covered
with a tough skin free from hair; the skin resembles the sable in
colour; the tail is short and thick; it is generally found in the
clefts of rocks contiguous to the mountains, or on stony hills;
the head appears to be full of scabs, as though the animal was
diseased; they are very slow on their legs, are taken in small
pit falls, and killed by dogs.</p>
<p>"The native cat resembles our pole-cat or weazel as to its
mode of living. It is between the size of the two, and infests
the hen-roosts, and is a great destroyer of all kinds of poultry.
They are found in hollow trees and under dead timber: their skins
are either grey or black spotted.</p>
<p>"The feathered tribes of Van Diemen's Land are numerous. The
sea and other water-fowl consist of gulls of various kinds,
boobies, noddies, shags, gornets, cormorants, pelicans, black
swans (very abundant), the musk-duck, and all kinds of the duck
tribe. The land birds, generally speaking, are all of them
curious and beautiful. The numbers of various kinds of parrots
and parroquets, clothed in the most beautiful plumage, are almost
beyond description. The cockatoos are as great destroyers of
corn, during the seed time and harvest, as crows are in
England.</p>
<p>"Tasmania may be said to be entirely without singing birds,
although the parroquets sing admirably when taught and rendered
tame. The tribes of small birds are various, but very unlike any
birds seen in England. The crows are similar to those in England,
with the exception of white eyes. There are two kinds of magpies,
the one completely black, the other like ours, but differently
marked: neither is so mischievous or destructive.</p>
<p>"The birds of prey are, the eagle, owls, bats, and the
different kinds of hawks, which are much like those in England.
Many of the large hawks are perfectly white.</p>
<p>"The pigeons are by far the most beautiful birds in the
island; they are called bronze winged pigeons. They are more like
the partridge than the pigeon, and much more delicious to eat.
The wings are beautifully variegated with gold-coloured feathers.
They are wild, though easily shot off the stubble, where they
feed in large quantities. There are smaller kinds of pigeons, and
a beautiful species of dove, whose cooing is a melancholy
tone."</p>
<p>"The birds that may be called game, are very numerous, with
the exception of the emu or native ostrich, they very much
resemble the latter bird, and are nearly as large. They leave the
mountains to feed in the plains, and are sometimes caught by the
kangaroo dogs. They are exceedingly swift, and, like the ostrich,
have no power to raise themselves from the earth.</p>
<p>"The quail, of which there are three kinds, are far more
numerous, in many parts of the island, than the partridge in
England. They are much larger than the quail of any other
country, and afford to the sportsman capital shooting.</p>
<p>"Snipes are found in great abundance, from September to March,
in the lakes and wet valleys. They are precisely like the snipe
of England, but not near so wild. Wild ducks and widgeons are
also found in all the principal fresh water rivers.</p>
<p>"The bittern is rare and not frequently met with. Plovers are
not numerous. There are two kinds, the golden and silver plover.
The baldcoot, and a large bird called the native hen, and the
heron frequent the lakes.</p>
<p>"The coast and harbours abound with various kinds of fish;
few, or any of them, are known in Europe. The market of Hobart
Town is principally supplied from the Derwent, with small rock
cod, flat-heads, and a fish called the perch, and various others.
Sharks and porpoises are common in the river, within a mile or
two of the town, and several large black whales have been killed
in the harbour.</p>
<p>"Of the several kinds of reptiles, none are so common as the
snake; they-vary in size from one to six feet long. At the sight
of a man, they generally make their escape into holes in the
ground or beneath old trees.</p>
<p>"Centipedes, scorpions, and a small kind of lizard and frogs
are to be seen, but not very commonly.</p>
<p>"The insects are not so numerous or so annoying as in most
other countries. The ant, the mosquito, and a common green fly

<p class="foot">[* Widowson's Present State of Van Diemen's
Land.]</p>
<p>The immediate neighbourhood of Hobart Town was the first part
of the island brought under cultivation; and in order to induce
emigration, grants of land were given by General Macquarrie,
Governor of New South Wales, almost indiscriminately, to those
who applied for them. The advantage of roads, and consequently
the facilities of sending produce to Hobart Town, confined the
settlements almost exclusively to a northern direction, which on
that line passes through what was supposed to be the best land in
the island; and as cultivation extended north from the Derwent to
the Tamar, the quality of the land improved and the climate
became milder; but till the late discoveries, which have been
made by Mr. Hellyer and Mr. Fossey, the character of the whole
surface of the island was supposed to be good. Mr. Widowson, who
published his work on the present state of Van Diemen's Land so
late as the year 1829, commences his introduction by the
following account.</p>
<p>"Of all our ultra-marine possessions, vast and valuable as
many of them are, no one excites so much interest, in the proper
sense of the word, as our different settlements in New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land. They are not rich in mines,
sugar-canes, cochineal, or cotton, but they are blessed with a
climate, which, though different in different places, is yet, on
the whole, favourable to the health, comfort, and industry of
Europeans. They exhibit an almost endless extent of surface,
various as to aspect and capability, but taken together, suited
in an extraordinary degree to the numerous purposes of rural
economy, the plough and spade, the dairy and sheep walk. The
emigrant has not to wage hopeless and ruinous war with
interminable forests and impregnable jungles, as he finds
prepared by the hand of nature extensive plains ready for the
ploughshare, and capable of repaying manifold in the first
season." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Widowson's State of Van Diemen's Land.]</p>
<p>Such, though perhaps stated in too glowing terms, was the
character of the country between Hobart Town and Launceston,
having extensive plains lightly timbered, upon which sheep might
be immediately placed; but greater experience has shewn that such
is not a faithful picture of those parts of Van Diemen's Land
which have been lately explored.</p>
<p>The first difficulties experienced by settlers, even in that
part of the island which best deserved the eulogium given to it,
arose from those who had prior possession, the Bushrangers and
the Aborigines. The Bushrangers were convicts who escaped from
penal settlements, or from individuals to whom they had been
assigned, formed themselves into banditti, and as Mr. Curr
expressed it, "ranged the woods of the island, and for a period
of six years committed the most cruel and daring robberies. Their
leader, Michael Howe, was a notorious character, who was, after a
long warfare, killed in October 1818, and who might be properly
called the last of the Bushrangers." * From that period, little
inconvenience has arisen from the ravages of banditti, though
convicts have occasionally escaped and resorted to plunder and to
concealment in the woods. The Aborigines have, however, continued
their depredations upon the property of settlers, and some
murders have very lately taken place. This is a subject which
must occasion grief and distress to every man of common feeling.
The original possessors of the land must have regarded the
European settlers as invaders or uninvited, obtrusive guests; and
the occupation of land and encroachment upon their hunting
grounds, could be alone justified, by the hope that these
degraded and wretched savages might be taught the arts of
civilized life, and from a state of misery and precarious
subsistence advanced to comfort and happiness. These objects
ought to have been kept in view and perseveringly followed, and
so far as it has been in the power of government at home to
instruct, and the colonial government to follow their orders,
every effort has been made to conciliate and civilize the
Aborigines. Unable, however, to draw distinctions, they have
regarded all white men as their enemies, and have visited the
innocent with that cruelty and resentment which a savage must
naturally feel for injuries received. Finding that all efforts to
conciliate failed, it was at length determined to endeavour by
one general effort on the part of the military and the settlers
to surround the natives, to drive them to a corner of the island,
where there was sufficient space allowed for their hunting and
fishing, and then to prevent them from going to the located
districts. This plan also has not succeeded; the savage was too
well acquainted with the nature of the country, and eluded his
pursuers; but since that time, a gentleman, Mr. G. A. Robinson,
has nobly volunteered to visit the different tribes, and
personally to risk his own life, by throwing himself unarmed
amongst them, and endeavouring to induce them to accompany him to
one of the islands in Bass's Straits, which will be assigned to
the natives and to them alone. The various instructions and
proceedings relating to this subject were printed by order of the
House of Commons, 23d September, 1831, and as it must be
interesting to every proprietor of this Company, it has been
thought best, after giving an account of Captain Cook's first
interview with the natives, so that their original character and
disposition may be in some measure known, to give in an Appendix,
ample extracts from those parliamentary papers.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Curr's Account of Van Diemen's Land.]</p>
<p>Captain Cook gives the following account of his first
interview with the natives.</p>
<p>"We were agreeably surprised at the place where we were
cutting wood with a visit from some of the natives, eight men and
a boy. They approached us from the woods without betraying any
marks of fear, or rather with the greatest confidence imaginable,
for none of them had any weapons except one, who held in his hand
a stick about two feet long and pointed at the end.</p>
<p>"They were quite naked and wore no ornaments, unless we
consider as such, and as a proof of their love of finery, some
large punctures or ridges raised on different parts of their
bodies, some in straight and others in curved lines.</p>
<p>"They were of the common stature, but rather slender, their
skin was black and also their hair, which was as woolly as any
native of Guinea, but they were not distinguished by remarkably
thick lips nor flat noses; on the contrary, their features were
far from being disagreeable. They had pretty good eyes, and their
teeth were tolerably even, but dirty; most of them had their hair
and beards smeared with a red ointment, and some had their faces
also painted with the same composition.</p>
<p>"They received every present we made them without the least
appearance of satisfaction. When some bread was given, as soon as
they understood that it was to be eaten, they either returned it
or threw it away without even tasting it. They also refused some
elephant flesh both raw and dressed, which we offered to them:
but upon giving some birds to them, they did not return these,
but easily made us comprehend that they were fond of such food. I
had brought two pigs ashore, with a view to leave them in the
woods. The instant these came within their reach, they seized
them as a dog would have done, by the ears, and were for carrying
them off immediately, with no other intention, as we could
perceive, but to kill them.</p>
<p>"Being desirous of knowing the use of the stick which one of
our visitors carried in his hand, I made signs to them to shew
me, and so far succeeded that one of them set up a piece of wood
as a mark and threw at it, at the distance of about twenty yards:
but we had little reason to commend his dexterity, for after
repeated trials, he was still very wide from the object Omai,* to
shew them how much superior our weapons were to theirs, then
fired his musket at it, which alarmed them so much, that
notwithstanding all we could do or say, they ran instantly into
the woods; one of them was so frightened that he let drop an axe
and two knives that had been given to him. From us, however, they
went to the place where some of the Discovery's people were
employed in taking water into their boat. The officer of that
party, not knowing that they had paid us a friendly visit, nor
what their intent might be, fired a musket in the air, which sent
them off with the greatest precipitation: thus ended our first
visit with the natives.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A native of the South Sea Islands, who
accompanied Captain Furneaux, and came with him to England.]</p>
<p>"The morning of the 29th January (1777) was ushered in with a
dead calm, which continued all day and effectually prevented our
sailing. I therefore sent a party over to the east side of the
bay to cut grass, having been informed that some of a superior
quality grew there. Another party, to cut wood, was ordered to go
to the usual place, and I accompanied them myself. We had
observed several of the natives this morning sauntering along the
shore, which assured us, that though their consternation had made
them leave us abruptly the day before, they were convinced that
we intended them DO mischief, and were desirous of renewing the
intercourse. It was natural that I should wish to be present on
the occasion. We had not been long landed, before twenty of them,
men and boys, joined us without expressing the least sign of fear
or distrust. There was one of this company conspicuously
deformed, and who was not more distinguishable by the hump on his
back, than by the drollery of his gestures and the seeming humour
of his speeches, which he was very fond of exhibiting, as we
supposed Tor our entertainment. Some of our present group wore
loose round their necks three or tour folds of small cord, made
of the fur of some animal, and others of them had a narrow slip
of kangaroo skin tied round their ankles.</p>
<p>"After staying about an hour with the wooding party and the
natives, as I could now be pretty confident that the latter were
not likely to give the former any disturbance, I left them, and
returned on board to dinner, where, some time after. Lieutenant
King arrived. From him I learnt that I had but just left the
shore, when several women and children made their appearance, and
were introduced to him by some of the men who attended them; he
gave presents to all of such trifles as he had about him. These
females wore a kangaroo skin, in the shape as it came from the
animal, tied over the shoulders and round the waist; but its only
use seemed to be to support their children when carried on their
backs, for it did bot cover those parts which most nations
conceal, being in all other respects as naked as the men and as
black, and their bodies marked with scars in the same manner. But
in this they differed from the men, that, though their hair was
of the same colour and texture, some of them had their heads
completely shorn or shaved: in others, this operation had been
performed only on one side, while the rest of them had all the
upper part of the head shorn close, leaving a circle of hair all
round, somewhat like the tonsure of the Romish ecclesiastics.
Many of the children had fine features and were thought pretty;
but of the persons of the women, especially those advanced in
years, a less favourable report was made. However, some of the
gentlemen belonging to the Discovery, I was told, paid their
addresses and made liberal offers of presents, which were
rejected with great disdain, whether from a sense of virtue or
the fear of displeasing the men, I shall not pretend to
determine. That this gallantry was not very agreeable to the
latter is certain, for an elderly man, as soon as he observed it,
ordered all the women and children to retire, which they obeyed,
though some of them shewed a little reluctance." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Cook's Voyages.]</p>
<p>Such is the account given of the Aborigines by Captain Cook.
The documents printed in the Appendix shew the cruel and inhuman
manner in which these poor savages have been since treated, and
the measures which it is now deemed necessary to adopt, in order
to put a stop to their ravages, and to protect the persons and
properties of settlers.</p>

Australia&mdash;Fisheries&mdash;Commerce&mdash;Gardens&mdash;Hobart

<p><span class="aa">The</span> two difficulties with which the
settlers in Van Diemen's Land have had peculiarly to contend, are
the Bushrangers and the Aborigines. Another, which is common to
all distant settlements, is the communication with the mother
country or with others whence they could obtain supplies until
they were able to cultivate their lands to produce sufficient
food for their wants: the consequence was, that early settlers
suffered severely from famine.</p>
<p>The year 1819 may be considered the period from which the
colony of Van Diemen's Land has risen to consequence and wealth,
but even at that time there was some stock in the island of
sheep, cattle, and horses; and though free emigration had not
been encouraged, various individuals had settled there, and large
districts of land had been granted. A commission of enquiry was
established by government in that year, in order to ascertain the
actual state of the colonies of New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land, and reports were drawn up by Commissioner Bigg, and printed
by order of the House of Commons in the years 1822 and 1823.
These reports give the most, authentic account of the state of
the infancy of the colonies when Colonel Sorell was the
lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>From these official reports it appears, that the breed of
sheep was then in the lowest state. The following extract from
Commissioner Bigg's Reports will best shew the nature of the
flocks, and the anxious attention given to them by the
lieutenant-governor.</p>
<p>"The breed of sheep now prevailing in Van Diemen's Land was
derived from a flock imported by Colonel Paterson from New South
Wales. These sheep were of the Teeswater breed, and have since
received a slight admixture with the sheep of the Leicester breed
and with a few that have been imported from Bengal. Of the latter
there are few remaining, and the traces are nearly extinct From
the access that the sheep of these settlements have had to new
pasturage, they have thriven rapidly and as quickly increased in
number.</p>
<p>"By the return made of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land,
the muster of 1818, the number of sheep is stated to have
amounted to 127,883. In 1819 it is stated to have been 172,128;
and by the return made to the muster 1820, the number of both
settlements is stated to have amounted to 182,468.</p>
<p>"From the statement made by Mr. Deputy Commissary-General
Hull, the returns given in at the annual muster, especially of
the number of ewes, are not to be depended upon. The general
embarrassment of the settlers, and the wish to swell the amount
of their property, as well as to entitle themselves to a share of
the supply required for the king's stores, all operate to give a
delusive character to these returns. The state of the flocks
will, however, in some measure account for the rapidity of their
increase: it was the custom to allow the sheep of all ages and
sizes to herd together in the same flock, and the lambs were
allowed to breed before they had attained the age of seven
months. Little improvement has taken placp either in the size or
in the fleeces of the sheep of Van Diemen's Land; nor did it
appear likely to take place under the management of the present
proprietors and as long as their attention was devoted to the
single object of supplying the stores with meat.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant-Governor Sorell had for some time been impressed
with the necessity of making some effort to improve the value of
the wool; and after communicating with Mr. M'Arthur upon the best
means of effecting it, Governor Macquarrie sanctioned an
agreement by which that gentleman delivered, at Sydney, 300 lambs
of the improved Merino breed in exchange for a certain quantity
of land in New Sooth Wales. The lambs were embarked in a large
vessel that was destined for Van Diemen's Land, and every care
was taken for their security and preservation during the voyage.
In consequence, however, of their long detention at Sydney after
their embarkation, on account of some private business of the
captain and of the great number of lambs that were put on board
and necessarily confined between the decks, ninety-one died on
the passage, 209 were landed, and of them twenty-four died soon
afterwards.</p>
<p>"A distribution of 181 lambs, valued at seven guineas each,
took place at Hobart Town in the month of September, 1820, to the
individuals whom Lieutenant-Governor Sorell considered most
capable of giving attention to the improvement of their fleeces,
and the number appropriated to each individual was also regulated
by him, on due consideration of the application that was made to
him and the character of the applicants. Securities were likewise
given from each person for the repayment of the value of the
lambs thus distributed, and amounted to £1330 7<i>s</i>.
8<i>d</i>." * This may be considered the commencement of attempts
to improve the fleeces in Van Diemen's Land, and to make the
growth of wool important.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Bigg[e]'s Report, January 10, 1823.]</p>
<p>It is stated in Commissioner Bigg's Report that the breed of
cattle prevalent in Van Diemen's Land, was derived from an
admixture of the Bengal and the English breeds.</p>
<p>The ordinary weight of the cattle at three years old was about
470 pounds: they were much used for draught and all agricultural
purposes. The number of cattle returned at the muster 1820.
amounted to 28,838.</p>
<p>The number of horses was not stated in that report; but the
deputy surveyor, Evans, states the number in that year to have
been 411.</p>
<p>The land cultivated for wheat in 1820 appeared to be 9275
acres.</p>

<p>Having thus shewn what Van Diemen's Land was in 1820, by
reference to the maps of the island hereto annexed, just
published by Mr. Arrowsmith, and the following statistical
tables, the proprietor will see the rapid advance made in the
island, and the progress towards more extended cultivation. In
this table the population and stock of the Van Diemen's Land
Company is not included, as it appears in the annual report.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="p48" id="p48"></a><img alt="" src=
"1401091h-images/p48.jpg"></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The whole white population in the island, including convicts
in the prisoners' hulk and in chain gangs, is estimated at
20,735.</p>
<p>The number of the Aborigines is uncertain, but is estimated at
500.</p>
<p>The foregoing tables are formed from information contained in
the Van Diemen's Land Anniversary and Hobart Town Almanack for
the year 1831.</p>
<p>The chief article of exportation, in Value, from Van Diemen's
Land is wool; the rapid increase in the quantity produced,
together with the equally rapid improvement in the quality of the
fleece,-must make that article the most important and, properly
speaking, the staple commodity of the colony. Its growing
importance to our manufacturers at home is equally great, the
felting properties superior to the wool of other countries, and
the peculiar softness of the texture make it very valuable to the
cloth manufacturers, while the length of staple, combined with
that softness, makes the heavier fleeces peculiarly adapted for
the fabrics made from fine worsted. Every year adds to the value
which the Australian colonies become to the mother country; and
when it is considered, that a few merino sheep were introduced
from Spain into Germany in the year 1780, and that wool was first
imported from thence in 1809, it may be fairly estimated, that in
the course of a few years we shall get our supplies of wool
altogether from British soil. The following Table shews the rapid
increase of importation, both from New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>The next article of importance to the commerce of Van Diemen's
Land is oil. The following extracts give much information upon
that and other productions.</p>
<p>"The sperm whale abounds in the Australian seas, particularly
in Bass's Straits, the oil of which fetches a high price in the
English market; and it must be evident to every one, that if the
merchants of London find it to their advantage to equip vessels
there at a very heavy expense for such a distant speculation as a
three years' voyage to the southern fishery, how much more
profitable it would be for the mercantile people of Van Diemen's
Land to enter into the trade, when they have the fish at their
very doors? There would be no necessity for the ships keeping the
sea so long to their great detriment, as they would have a port
at hand to which they might resort, and there deposit their oil,
refit, and take in fresh supplies. The capital required would
also be much less, from the smaller size of the vessels, and the
return being so much quicker, a ready sale being found on the
spot, should the adventurer not be able to wait even so long as
to send it to the English market. Having a valuable article to
offer in return for these imports, and furnishing freight to
vessels which are now obliged to go elsewhere in ballast to seek
it, would tend much to increase the trade of the colony by
attracting vessels, and to the benefit of the settlers by
reducing the prices of articles from the greater importation
caused by it.</p>
<p>"The whale which yields the black oil is extremely numerous
all round the island, coming up even into the harbour, where the
inhabitants may witness the animating spectacle of these huge
monsters killed by the boats' crews belonging to the port One
female went up as far as New Norfolk, twenty-four miles above
Hobart Town, it is supposed for the purpose of calving, and was
killed there.</p>
<p>"Seals are very numerous on the coasts and islands, and their
skins are sent to England. No use whatever is made of the oil
which this animal yields so abundantly, the carcases being
generally left to rot by the fishermen. The skins of kangaroos
and other animals, such as those of the opossum, tiger-cat, and
platthypus, or ornythorhyncus * paradoxus, are exported, but in
such trifling quantities as to be scarcely worth mentioning. The
skin of the kangaroo answers, as well as kid skins, for the upper
leathers of shoes, and is of a very soft, pleasant wear. Till
lately, scarcely any attention was paid to the hides of the
cattle that were slaughtered out of the towns; and even now very
little care is bestowed upon them. Great quantities are consumed
by the settlers themselves in making a rude sort of rope, by
cutting the hide up into strips; and what are not so used, are
generally thrown aside to rot. The curing of hides, and salting
of beef for exportation are very worthy of attention on the part
of the settlers. The herds of cattle are increasing so rapidly,
and in many places are allowed to stray so much at large over the
country, as to be almost valueless to the proprietors: it would
be worth their while to slaughter very extensively, for the
purposes mentioned. Few attempts have been made to salt beef for
exportation; but were it properly done, India, the Mauritius,
(and Swan River for some time,) would afford an extensive market,
in supplying the navy and merchantmen. The latter generally bring
a sufficiency of salt provisions for the voyage out and home; but
were they sure of obtaining them good in India, it cannot be
doubted but that they would be glad to avail themselves of the
additional quantity of room, obtainable by only taking enough for
their outward voyage. Some trials, in a small way, have been made
in salting beef, which did not stand the changes of climate.
There can be no doubt but that this must have arisen either from
the method of curing pursued in England not being properly
understood in the colony, or from the nature of the salt made use
of. There is nothing in the climate to prevent meat being cured
just as well as in any part of the world. Hams and bacon are
cured in considerable quantities; and were proper attention paid
to the English methods of doing it, they ought to furnish a
considerable article for export to India, as well as cheese, the
making of which is beginning to be more attended to in this
colony.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The ornythorhynchi appear to blend several of
the characters of the quadruped and the bird, and in one of the
species even of the fish; they are four footed animals about
twenty inches long, terminating at the head in a bill like that
of a duck, and at the other end in a tail not unlike that of a
seal.]</p>
<p>"The corn of Van Diemen's Land is particularly fine and heavy.
Large quantities are exported annually to Sydney; and a few
trials have been made of sending it, as also flour, to the Isle
of France, where they have sold very well. Barley grows very
luxuriantly; but from the little pains hitherto bestowed in
keeping the seed free from admixture of other grains, it cannot
be extensively used in brewing of malt liquor; to which,
probably, may be attributed the slow progress in this branch of
trade, as the brewers are obliged to purchase foreign barley at a
high price. There are, however, five breweries established in
Hobart Town, producing very good beer and ale. Imported hops are
made use of at present; but attention is given to the growth of
this very necessary article, to the raising of which the climate
is found extremely favourable. It is to be hoped that at some no
very distant period, beer may also afford an export to our Indian
settlements, to which the voyage from hence is so much shorter
than from England. The distance is now performed in two months,
even in winter; and as the usual state of the winds, &amp;c.
become better known, it will, no doubt, be done in less time.
There is but one distillery now at work in the island.</p>
<p>"The bark of the mimosa, or, as it is called in the colony
'the wattle tree' is found to answer extremely well in tanning
leather, and to yield a very powerful extract for the same
purpose. Of the latter not much is made, but great quantities of
the bark are sent to England, the character of it becoming better
understood. A small portion of the extract was also sent; but
from ignorance of the mode of manufacture, it was boiled in iron
vessels; so that, although of very great strength, it did not
answer, from its imparting a colour to the leather and rendering
it brittle. Time and experience will enable the colonists to
manufacture it in a proper manner.</p>
<p>"Leather is tanned to a considerable extent in various places,
and a great deal is consumed in the making of shoes, which are
found very durable. A good deal of glue and parchment is also
made. Hats are manufactured in Hobart Town; they have not,
however, so good tax appearance as those sent from England.</p>
<p>"There is a considerable manufactory of salt in Brune's
Island; but a great deal is still imported from England.</p>
<p>"The demand for soap is largely supplied by the manufactory of
this article in Hobart Town. The barilla used is found on the
islands in Bass's Straits, and the eastern coast of the island;
and some little of the last-mentioned produce has been exported.
It only requires command of labour and capital to develops the
great resources which the island possesses within itself." *</p>

<p>The above extracts shew the capabilities of Van Diemen's Land
for general trade; considerable commerce has been carried on with
the East Indies, the Mauritius, New South Wales, and the Brazil;

the last five years, viz. the years 1827, 1828, 1829, 1830, and
1831, shew the growing importance of the trade with Van Diemen's
Land, as well as respects the raw materials imported from thence,
so essential to our national industry, as the increasing demand
for our manufactures. It is indeed to our own colonies and to
distant markets that the British merchant must look for the
consumption of the chief fabrics of Great Britain, the demand for
which will be reduced by the extension of manufactures on the
continent of Europe.</p>

<p>Hobart Town is the capital of Van Diemen's Land, the chief
residence of the Governor, and the seat of Government. It is
situate on the west side of the Derwent, near the north extremity
of the district to which it gives the name. A fine stream of
water, taking its rise from the foot of Mount Wellington, about
four miles distant, runs through the town. The banks On each side
rise all round in gentle eminences, on which the town is built.
The houses being built originally on small separate allotments of
land, consisting of a quarter of an acre each, the view, as the
stranger walks along, is left unobstructed, and generally
commands a delightful prospect over the town and buildings. The
streets are laid out intersecting each other at right angles. An
amphitheatre of gently rising hills, beautifully clothed with
trees and crowned by Mount Wellington 4000 feet high, defends it
from the westerly winds, while the Derwent with its beautiful
bays skirts it on the east. The town contained, in 1831, as
recorded in the Hobart Town Almanack, 783 houses and 6000
inhabitants. There are in the town, six corn-mills, four
breweries, a soap manufactory, about eight tanneries, and a hat
manufactory. Shipbuilding is carried on to the extent of about
200 tons per annum, and its foreign trade with England, the
Brazils, and the East Indian archipelago is considerable. The
whale fishery is also carried on to a large extent. The next town
in importance is Launceston. It is the capital of the district of
that name, the residence of a civil commandant, and garrisoned by
a considerable detachment of troops. Assizes are held there, and
they have courts of requests and quarter sessions. It is situate
at the confluence of the North and South Esk, which here form the
Tamar. The water is salt and is navigable for vessels of 300 tons
up to the town. It maintains a frequent and prosperous trade with
Sydney, being nearly in the centre of a very fertile corn
country; six or seven ships are also loaded at Launceston
annually for England, with wool, bark, and wheat, and there is a
constant intercourse with Swan River. Launceston is indeed fast
advancing in wealth and consequence, and 13 likely to become the
most considerable commercial town in the eastern hemisphere. Its
rapid increase in population and trade will soon make it vie
with, and probably surpass Hobart Town in importance.</p>
<p>The following account of a journey from Hobart Town to
Launceston, is extracted from the book printed at Calcutta.</p>
<p>"The distance from Hobart Town to Launceston, north of Hobart
Town, is 124 miles by the present road, which is most excellent
throughout, except in a very few places; made on Mac Adam's
principle, and kept in very good repair by different chain gangs,
who are also employed in making new portions of road wherever it
is found to shorten the distance, or to go through a tract of
country easier for cattle to travel. At present, travellers going
the north road are obliged to cross the Derwent fiver by various
ferries, which are not pleasant when the wind is strong. To
obviate the inconvenience resulting from the difficulty of
transit for carts and goods, a causeway is building at the Black
Snake, about eleven miles from Hobart Town, reducing the channel
of the river to about 200 yards of deep water, across which a
flying bridge will traverse; and a new line of road has been cut
from thence into the old one, shortening the distance by three
miles. An excellent and handsome white freestone bridge is
building on this line, over the Jordan River, which falls into
the Derwent, after a very long and tortuous course. Besides the
great north road, there are various others penetrating into
different districts. One goes to New Norfolk, distant twenty-four
miles, which is a large and thriving village in a beautiful
situation on the Derwent. The Governor has a country house here,
to which he frequently retires for a little relaxation from
public business. Another, after crossing the Derwent at Kangaroo
Point, goes to Richmond and Jericho, besides branches to many
other districts. In addition to the macadamized roads made, and
in progress in various parts of the colony, there are tracks into
every part where settlements have been made, that can be
travelled over in a gig without the slightest difficulty.</p>
<p>"The means of accommodation on the great roads are numerous
and excellent at the different inns, of which there are no Jess
than sixteen between Hobart Town and Launceston, and they are
equally numerous on all the other roads. The 'entertainment for
man and horse' is generally very good, and the charges not very
greatly above the inns in Hobart Town. The scenery is every where
most romantic, and will well repay the traveller for the fatigue
of his journey. Among the most beautiful places may be mentioned
the village of New Town, distant about three miles from Hobart
Town, consisting chiefly of gentlemen's houses and properties,
well cleared, cultivated, and laid out into gardens and meadows:
it is on the bank of the Derwent, the views of which at this spot
are quite charming. This place reminds one of a quiet English
village, and it only requires a spire to render the illusion
complete. Perth, on the South Esk, distant twelve miles from
Launceston, is also another romantic village with which the
traveller will be much struck, as well as with the beauty of the
river, which glides silently between its sloping banks, covered
with the finest verdure.</p>
<p>"George Town is forty miles from Launceston, and 164 from
Hobart Town, within four miles of the entrance of Port Dalrymple,
which is the name of the mouth of the Tamar, where it falls into
Bass's Straits. This is but a small place, and has fallen much
into decay since the head quarters were removed from it to
Launceston.</p>
<p>"Besides these places there are various other towns and
villages; some of them, however, merely as yet in name, and
others which are advancing considerably; among which may be
mentioned Perth, Green Ponds, Oatlands, Jericho, Campbell Town,
Richmond, and Sorell Town,&mdash;some of them very prettily
situated.</p>
<p>"There are several ranges of mountains in various parts of the
country, of considerable height; the greatest elevation as yet
ascertained is about 5000 feet above the sea, and the summits of
them are covered with snow throughout the year: very little is
known of these ranges, the difficulty of penetrating their
recesses having hitherto baffled the explorers. What is called
the Western Tier has as yet proved a bar to ascertaining the
capabilities of the country on the western side of the
island.</p>
<p>"The dwellings of the settlers are generally at considerable
distances from each other, and mostly in the style of farm
houses; though many of them belonging to the larger proprietors
are excellent dwellings, built either of weather boards, brick,
or stone, with out-offices of every description. In some places,
however, the houses are so near to each other as to form very
picturesque hamlets. There are numerous small churches and
chapels already built, both by government and private
subscription, and others proposed and in progress. Several
chaplains are stationed in the larger townships, and in the
smaller ones there are what are called catechists, who read
prayers on Sundays. There are district assistant surgeons
stationed in various parts of the colony, to afford medical aid
to the convicts and military detachments, who are paid by
government for their services. There are many very excellent
private practitioners in Hobart Town and Launceston, as well as a
few in the other parts of the country; so that there is no want
of medical attendance, although, in such a climate, it is not
much required.</p>
<p>"There is no difficulty of communication by letters, mails
being transported on horseback to all the principal districts in
the country; and the more distant settlers send their letters to
particular places appointed for them. The rates are yet rather
high, but some new arrangement is about to be made regarding the
postage, as well as to make the days of despatch more
numerous.</p>
<p>"The seasons in Van Diemen's Land may be divided as follows.
The spring commences in September, the summer in December, the
autumn in March, and the winter in June. It is some time before
the emigrant from the northern hemisphere gets reconciled to this
complete inversion of the seasons. Christmas falls in the midst
of summer; and the state of the weather quite outrages all the
associations of ideas he has so long cherished, as connected with
that period of festivity. Time, however, accustoms him to this,
as well as to seeing the indigenous evergreens covered with
foliage in the depth of winter. Trees grown from imported seeds
or cuttings, shed their leaves in the autumn of this country, the
same as in Europe.</p>
<p>"The climate seems peculiarly favourable' to raising all kinds
of vegetable productions; the only thing they suffer from, are
the night frosts in summer, which, however, do not prevail so
much near Hobart Town and Launceston as in the more elevated
parts in the interior of the island. They may be attributed to
the immense forests retaining the moisture, which is acted upon
by the piercing winds, from which, in the present open and
uninclosed state of the country, the plants are not at all
defended. As the woods get cleared and hedge-rows more
extensively introduced, the effect of these frosts may be
expected to be very much diminished. The hawthorn, whin, and all
other plants fit for this purpose, grow most luxuriantly, and the
planting of them is coming extensively into practice. Fruit-trees
of all kinds grow most rapidly, and what is surprising to an
European, generally commence bearing in the third year. Apple
orchards have been formed to a great extent: much of the fruit is
of a very good quality, and grows to an immense size. An apple
fifteen inches and a half in circumference, and weighing from
seventeen to nineteen ounces, is not uncommon. The making of
cider is only just now beginning to be thought of; but some of
the colonists now perceive what an excellent beverage may be
obtained for themselves, and servants, with little expense and
trouble, and are turning their attention to this. It is to be
hoped, that ere many years have elapsed, the making of cider will
afford an export, and at the same time tend to diminish the
present great consumption of spirits. Peaches, apricots, and
nectarines grow very luxuriantly, and bear abundantly; but being
for the most part from seedlings, they are of an inferior sort.
The peaches in particular abound so much, as to be left to rot on
the ground, or are thrown to the pigs.</p>
<p>"Grafting is becoming extensively practised, and we may hope,
in a few years, to see as fine varieties of fruit here as in any
part of the world. Damsons, plums, and green-gages, cherries,
pears, and quinces, are all to be had, but are not, generally,
very good. The grape-vine grows so well here and bears so
plentifully, as to afford reasonable hopes that at some future
period it will not be found impracticable to manufacture wine.
Some little was made from grapes in a garden near Hobart Town,
but had not attained a sufficient age to allow of any judgment
being formed. A gentleman had taken a suburb allotment, near
Hobart Town, intending to form a vineyard for the purpose of
making experiments on the manufacture of wine. Gooseberries and
currants are grown of the finest size and quality. The crops of
raspberries are, however, the most astonishing. The bushes grow
to an enormous height, and bear such quantities of fruit as have,
in all probability, never been seen any where else. A great deal
of most excellent jam is made and sold in the towns, as well as
jellies and preserves front many other sorts of fruit, of a very
good quality. The cheapness of sugar and the abundance of the
fruit will, ere long, induce the colonists to turn their
attention to sending these luxuries to the Indian market.</p>
<p>"Strawberries grow very well, but are not as yet abundant</p>
<p>"Vegetables of all kinds are most plentiful in the colony, and
of the finest quality. There is little trouble in rearing them at
almost any season of the year, from the general mildness of the
climate; as an instance of which, geraniums are grown in the open
air, attaining a great size, and being in bloom all the year.
That tender plant mignionette, may be said never to be out of
blossom. Every thing that can be grown in England may be raised
here, of the finest quality; and most of the vegetable
productions of Southern Europe, which require so much care and
expense to be bestowed upon them in England, may be had without
much of either in this colony." *</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p align="center">Convict Labour and Emigration&mdash;Prospects
of Proprietors and Settlers.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Van Diemen's</span> Land is indebted for its
present prosperous condition chiefly to crimes committed in Great
Britain. Its lands have been cleared, its roads constructed, its
towns built, by men who had either forfeited their lives to the
offended laws of their country, (which had been spared by the
mercy of their king,) or by men who, for the commission of acts a
shade lower in guilt, were banished from their families and their
homes.</p>
<p>When the Australian colonies first became penal settlements,
sentence of transportation was attended with severe labour and
great suffering. The accounts sent by convicts, both of their
voyage and their treatment on arrival, tended to show that they
were really receiving punishment due to their crime; that
whatever situation they might have filled in England, it could
not be improved in exile, but that the verdict of a jury and the
sentence of a judge brought upon them disgrace, misery, and
wretchedness. It was a common saying, that the sentence of
transportation was very little better than that of death. The
following account as to the nature of this punishment was given
in evidence, by Mr. E. G. Wakefield, before a select committee of
the House of Commons, in August last.</p>
<p>"I was also asked as to the effect of transportation to an
unwholesome colony, and I wish to remark upon that point, that
transportation to the most unwholesome colony, could not be so
severe as was the system of transportation, when first
introduced, to New South Wales. During the first four or five
years of the existence of that colony, the contracts for the
transportation of prisoners were made for 80 many embarked from
England, not for so many disembarked in the colony; the
consequence was, that the captains of the transports had a direct
interest in killing the prisoners; and the fact was, as to a
great number of ships one third; as to a considerable number a
half, and as to some two thirds, of the prisoners died on the
passage. It is a well known fact. I derive it from books and
various sources. It was a severe punishment, indeed, it was
capital punishment as to a very large proportion of the persons
sentenced to transportation; it was much more severe as a
punishment than transportation now would be, to the most
unwholesome colony we possess." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Wakefield's Evidence before the Committee
of the House of Commons.]</p>
<p>Mr. William Walker, who resided in New South Wales about
seventeen years, stated, in evidence before the same committee,
"that in the earlier days of the colony. Government were obliged
to cultivate food for the supply of the people, and that convicts
were all sent to government farms, in the first instance, and
worked very hard; the work was there very severe, and they were
much afraid of it. That those labourers, after having served
government, were, after a short space of time, assigned to the
settlers and he had heard the oldest settlers in the colony say,
they never had such men in their employment as those who had been
worked at the government farms." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Mr. William Walker's Evidence before the same
Committee.]</p>
<p>Thus transportation acted as a preventive to crime, and the
accounts sent home by convicts deterred others from its
commission. The ameliorated system with respect to the voyage
was, indeed, most necessary, but the relaxation which has taken
place as to employment on arrival has had a most pernicious
effect, and from too much severity, it has become too lenient.
Let the original system be contrasted with that which was adopted
by General Macquarrie, when Governor of New South Wales, and the
injurious consequences of which has required all the energy of
General Darling to counteract.</p>
<p>Mr. James Busby, late collector of the internal revenue of New
South Wales, and a member of the land-board of that colony,
besides giving clear and conclusive verbal evidence, addressed a
letter to the select committee of the House of Commons, from
which the following is extracted.</p>
<p>"In the management and discipline of convicts in New South
Wales, the local government has seldom, if ever, adverted to the
punishment of transportation with reference to its operation as a
<i>preventive</i> from crime in the mother country.</p>
<p>"It was the invariable practice of General Macquarrie, during
the long period of his administration, to assure the newly
arrived convict, that his past conduct would be entirely
overlooked, and that his future treatment would altogether depend
upon the line of conduct he should thenceforward adopt. The
prospect held out to him, was not punishment for the past, but
encouragement for the future, and he had the most ample evidence
in the circumstances of many of the convicts, that the way not
only to indulgence, but even to wealth and a certain degree of
distinction, was open to his ambition.</p>
<p>"With the reformation of the convict which was the object
aimed at by this treatment, there was combined another object,
which contributed to procure him additional indulgence, viz., the
value of his labour, which it was necessary to make available in
the cultivation of the land, and in providing the necessary
accommodation of public buildings; whether employed in the public
works or in the service of individuals, his labour was stimulated
by the reward of permission to work for his own behoof, during a
part of each week, and then in every shape a mitigation of his
punishment became the ruling principle of his treatment.</p>
<p>"Up to the present day, the same principles, though under
considerable restriction in their application, have continued to
prevail. The convicts have been distributed to the service of the
settlers or retained in that of government, with a view to the
demands of their labour and to the saving of expense in their
maintenance, rather than to an uniform and indiscriminative
system of discipline; and while they were encouraged to good
conduct by the prospect of a remission of their sentence, their
industry has been often either directly prompted by a share in
its advantages, or they have found means to elude the controul of
their overseers, or to obtain their connivance in turning it to
their own account. They look forward to the privilege of what is
called a <i>ticket of leave</i>, which good conduct during a
certain period will procure them, and by which they are allowed
to work for their own exclusive benefit; and although their
residence is restricted to a certain district, they are in other
respects entirely at their own disposal, so long as their conduct
is such as to escape the notice of the police.</p>
<p>"A convict for seven years is allowed his privilege of a
<i>ticket of leave</i> at the end of four years' service; a
convict of fourteen years, after six years'; and a convict for
life, after eight years' service, provided they shall have
continued during their respective periods in the service of one
master.</p>
<p>"It has been the tendency of such a system to banish from
their own minds the salutary feeling, that they were doomed to
eat the bitter fruits of bondage as a satisfaction to the injured
Jaws of their country, and as a beacon to others to avoid a
similar course of conduct; and now that all the hardships
inseparable from the first settlement and earlier stages of a
colony have been overcome, the situation of a majority has been
such as rather to excite the envy than the dread of the poorer
classes in England, to whom their condition is understood to be
well known.</p>
<p>"Whatever advantages, therefore, the present system of
transportation may afford to the colony, by supplying, at a cheap
rate, its demands for labour, (to it the most valuable of all
commodities,) it is not to be wondered at, that its inefficiency
in the objects of its first institution, as a punishment and a
preventive from crime, should at length have attracted the
attention of his majesty's government." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Busby's evidence before the Committee of
the House of Commons.]</p>
<p>This contrast in the punishment consequent on the sentence of
transportation at the early settlement of the Australian colonies
and at the present time, clearly shews, that as a preventive of
crime transportation has ceased to be useful, the reverse,
indeed, may be fairly presumed; that the change of the condition
of the labourer from his generally wretched condition at home, to
his comparatively comfortable state in New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land, acts as a premium and a stimulus to crime.</p>
<p>Mr. Wontner, the highly respectable governor of Newgate,
though he admits that some sentenced to transportation appear to
suffer much mental anxiety on the subject, says, "I think the
evil is this, that persons who are sentenced to transportation
know that their friends are exerting themselves to get good
situations for them, and they are receiving information from New
South Wales, that this person and that person, whom they had
known here, are in situations where they are getting money; this
makes transportation no terror to them." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Wontner's Evidence before the Committee of
the House of Commons.]</p>
<p>Mr. E. G. Wakefield, who, from his long confinement in
Newgate, was well qualified to form a correct opinion, says, "I
had particular opportunities of observing the impression made
upon the minds of convicts under sentence of transportation,
because, in the first place, there is always a considerable
number of such persons in Newgate, and, secondly, Newgate is a
sort of lodging-house for convicts coming from the country
prisons; they remain there for a short time, but quite long
enough to give any body who is an inmate of the prison an
opportunity of observing the impression upon their minds. I took
very great pains, during the course of three years, to observe
the state of mind of those persons, and I do not now remember a
single instance in which a prisoner appeared to me to be deeply
affected by the prospect of being transported to the colonies; on
most occasions, when I examined any prisoner, I found his mind
bent upon the colonies, when he expected to go there, and bent
upon attaining a degree of wealth and happiness such as he had no
prospect of attaining in this country. Amongst a number of
persons sentenced to transportation, and living together, I have
generally found one, and sometimes two or three, who had already
been in the colonies; and it is very seldom a session passes at
the Old Bailey without the conviction of some man who has been
transported before, consequently, the convicts associating with
these men, have the best opportunities of hearing reports as to
the state of the convicts in New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land. These reports are always exceedingly favourable; in many
cases, no doubt, they are much exaggerated in favour of the
convict, because a man who returns from transportation takes
pleasure in making people believe that he has cheated the law,
and that he has enjoyed himself, notwithstanding the sentence
passed upon him. But whilst some allowance must be made for this
exaggeration of the returned convict, the story he has to tell
is, when true, a very favourable one in the estimation of these
people. He states such facts as, that a great number of the
persons who keep carriages in Sydney were once convicts, and he
gives the names of those persons, and describes how they, in the
course of a very few years, have raised themselves from the
situation of convicts to that of the most important persons, in
point of wealth perhaps, in the colony. All these representations
are received with great delight by the convicts, and those who
think upon the subject at alt, go out with the prospect of
benefiting themselves and doing well." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Evidence before the Committee of the House of
Commons.]</p>
<p>Mr. James Busby stated, "I have known individuals who have
committed crimes to get to New South Wales, and I think I have
known of people who have endeavoured to induce their relatives or
connexions to commit crime in order to get them sent out." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Evidence before the Committee of the House of
Commons.]</p>
<p>Thomas Potter Macqueen, Esq., late member for Bedfordshire,
goes still further, and states, in evidence to the same
committee, "I consider the condition of the convict labourers in
New South Wales as infinitely superior to that of the
agricultural labourers of this country; and I have found, from my
own experience u a magistrate, that many persons have asked me
what extent of crime would insure them transportation." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Evidence before the Committee of the House of
Commons.]</p>
<p>With these facts, so stated, coming from different persons,
holding different situations, but all confirmatory, is it too
much to say, that the sentence of transportation, upon the
present system, is an incentive and premium to crime? The effect
upon the morals of the lowest classes in this country cannot be
mistaken, and the effect upon the colonies is also injurious; for
however beneficial the labour of convicts has been, it does not
follow, that under a more severe system, with more labour,
greater coercion, and more restraint, it would not, even from
those convicts, have been more beneficial. But besides the
advantage which might be derived in the colony from greater
restriction, the convict, in going to Van Diemen's Land, has now
a decided advantage over those poor, but honest, farmers who
still remain uncontaminated by vice, whose minds would revolt at
crime, and whose object is to maintain their families in comfort
and respectability, to put them in the way of getting forward in
the world, and leave a good name behind them. Men of that
description, the most useful men who can go to a colony, cannot
afford to pay the expense of their passage; they, upon certain
conditions, are obliged to engage themselves for a term of years
to serve the person who pays their expenses, generally seven
years, and at about half the wages that they could, if free,
obtain in the colony. From this agreement they have no chance of
escape, the very principles which make them detest crime would
make them adhere to the terms of their agreement; and we see,
that a criminal sentenced to seven years' transportation obtains
his ticket of leave, and earns the highest wages, at the
expiration of four, whilst the honest man has no chance of
attaining that advantage in less than seven years. But this is
not all: the present system makes no distinction between the
honest and the dishonest man; the latter can rise to wealth
sooner than the former, and it is now the decided interest of a
man to get the expense of his passage paid by the commission of
crime. The system is also equally injurious to those who engage
free emigrants and pay their expenses out, because, when the men
so engaged have been some time in the colony, they feel
dissatisfied at comparing their condition with that of convicts,
and consequently a convict labourer becomes more valuable than a
free and honest emigrant.</p>
<p>Whether, therefore, the object be to prevent crime at home or
to encourage emigration, the present system requires change. If
the sentence of the convict were defined, and he experienced
hardship in road gangs and severe labour which his crimes,
according to their degree, merited, and after undergoing severe
labour was then assigned to a settler, and he was certain that he
had no chance of escape from the full extent of that sentence; if
he were to know that good conduct during the whole period for
which he was to remain in exile, would be the only means of
obtaining encouragement at its expiration, a stimulus for
reformation would be held out, but he would not be placed in an
advantageous situation as compared with the emigrant; a
distinction, and a marked distinction, would be drawn between the
two; good character and good conduct would have their proper
weight, and emigration would thereby be encouraged.</p>
<p>In the earliest stages of the colony the settler experienced
great difficulties and had to undergo much hardship, but as each
year elapsed, these difficulties decreased, so that the emigrant
of the present day has, comparatively speaking, an easy course
and a plain road before him; still, however, difficulties must
continue, and they can only be removed by increased population,
which will give the settler more labourers and at a cheaper rate.
For one moment let a comparison be drawn between Ireland and Van
Diemen's Land. They are both islands, containing about the same
number of superficial square miles, but the one is overburdened
with population, whilst the other has only 25,000 inhabitants;
the lowest classes in the one live in misery, chiefly without
animal food, ill fed, ill clothed, without employment, and a prey
to those restless and desperate characters who have so frequently
risen up and destroyed their peace; the other has abundance of
land wanting the hand of the labourers, and great productions in
proportion to the wants of the inhabitants. If one tenth, or one
hundredth, of the population of Ireland could be transferred to
Van Diemen's Land, the advantage would be mutual, it would be a
relief to the one, a gain to the other; and if by any means the
change could be gradually made by removing the surplus population
from what is called overstocked Ireland, great advantage would
accrue.</p>
<p>Let a contrast be also drawn between Scotland and the northern
counties of England, with Ireland and the southern counties of
England. In Scotland as well as the northern counties there are
large districts wholly agricultural; the Lothians, the Cheviot
Hills scarce possess a manufacture; so also great part of
Northumberland, Durham, Westmoreland, the North and East Ridings
of Yorkshire are agriculture, they are equally healthy with the
southern counties, but the population does not overrun the
country. The children of agricultural labourers get employment in
the manufacturing districts in their neighbourhood, in Glasgow,
Paisley, Lancashire, and the West Riding of Yorkshire, where both
boys and girls obtain their settlement. Whole families rarely, if
ever, remove from agricultural districts to the manufacturing
towns, the parents remain upon their farms, but some of their
children when they attain the proper age relieve both their
patents and parish by emigration. Let this apparently natural
mode of relief be applied to other agricultural districts. It has
been recommended to send men out with their families, and to a
certain extent that may be right; but married people with
families have already fulfilled the law of nature and done their
duty in increasing population, and they have acquired fixed
habits which unfit them for a new country. There have been very
few instances of poor families removing firom the agricultural
districts to the colonies unless as servants to settlers, where
they are, in a great measure, independent of their own mental
exertion. If, however, encouragement were given, under proper
regulations, for young people of both sexes to go to the
colonies, either as apprentices to settlers, or under the charge
of superintendants who would instruct them and attend to their
conduct, it would probably be much more efficacious in relieving
the over peopled districts, because they would be removed before
they began to increase, and would raise up a useful population
where it is so much wanted. There are few persons in Van Diemen's
Land between the age of manhood and children of five or six
years, and it is exactly that intermediate description which is
most required; boys who can drive the plough and the cart, tend
the sheep, and do a hundred offices which are undertaken by the
lads of England; girls who can weed the fields, look after the
cows, and do the house-work of families. By thus encouraging the
emigration of young people, great benefit would accrue both at
home and abroad: it would be less expense to parishes to pay for
their passage, being about half the cost of adults, their
maintenance would be less expensive than if they remained at
home; and in a short time they would cease to to be a burden. If
government establish schools for female <i>convicts</i>, they
might surely be established for those who have not, by the
commission of crime, qualified themselves for such special care
and attention.</p>
<p>Mr. Busby, in his letter addressed to the committee of the
House of Commons states,</p>
<p>"Female convicts, upon their arrival, are invariably assigned
to the service of private individuals, as far as the demand for
their service will allow; the remainder are sent to the female
factory at Parramatta.</p>
<p>"Most of the advantages which are attainable by many of the
male convicts, whether in the employment of an individual or in
that of government, are beyond the reach of the female.</p>
<p>"The demand for her service in a menial capacity, is not so
great, in proportion to the number at the disposal of government,
as to make it the interest of her master either to induce her to
good conduct, by the temptation of pecuniary rewards, or to
screen her from punishment when deserved. If retained in the
factory, the discipline in that establishment is now so
excellent, that while those confined for punishment; are treated
more or less severely in proportion to the nature of their
offences, those who are retained merely because there has been no
applicant for their services, suffer little in the nature of
punishment beyond the confinement within its walls. The only
alleviation, therefore, of the punishment of the females, whether
in private service or within the walls of the factory, is the
prospect of that degree of freedom which a ticket of leave
confers, or of contracting marriage, for which every facility is
wisely afforded by government. While, therefore, excepting in the
case of characters of the most depraved description,
transportation must always appear more dreadful to the feelings
of the female than of the male culprit, there is little in their
subsequent treatment to excite the high hopes and expectations so
frequently entertained by the latter; and as leas change is
required in the punishment of a female, as regards the influence
of example in the mother country, the very efficient discipline
which has at length resulted from the great and persevering
attention bestowed upon their treatment leaves, as far as my
judgment goes, little room for practical improvement in the
colony." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Letter to the Committee of the House of
Commons.]</p>
<p>Such is the treatment which the female convicts receive. It is
a known fact, that some of them have married well, and conducted
themselves with credit and even respectability; and there is one
instance in particular, in a female who was a domestic servant in
one of the midland counties of England, having been sentenced to
transportation for robbing her master: she was most respectably
married soon after her arrival, and has since then in each year
sent home fifty pounds to her mother, who was in distressed
circumstances, thereby making the evening of her life
comfortable. If, however, government take such care of female
convicts,&mdash;not more care than they ought to take,&mdash;why
should not the virtuous and the honest have encouragement and
protection? If schools are established for the vicious, they
surely ought to be opened for those who are free from crime, more
especially if this over-peopled country of Great Britain can be
best relieved, and the interests of the colonies best promoted,
by the emigration of young persons. Parents who cannot maintain
their families without parochial relief, ought not to complain;
their children, instead of the prospect of poverty by remaining
at home, would have the hope of advancement in life in a British
Colony and a healthy climate, where by their industry they might,
as in the case just mentioned, minister to the relief of their
parents and cheer the evening of their lives.</p>
<p>The subject of emigration has of late been much under the
consideration of his majesty's government. It is one of
considerable difficulty, and the documents respecting crown lands
and emigration, which have been printed by order of the House of
Commons, dated the 13th October last, shew the anxiety of the
Colonial Department to meet the difficulties, and to devise such
measures as wilt best and most effectually promote this important
object.</p>
<p>Extensive surveys have been ordered in the Australian
colonies, and the territories are to be divided into counties,
which are to be forty miles square, to be apportioned each county
into hundreds, each of which shall comprise an area of 100 square
miles, and those subdivided into parishes to comprize an area of
twenty-five square miles, having regard to divisions by natural
boundaries, formed by rivers, streams, or highlands.</p>
<p>When these surveys are made, lists of parishes and charts are
to be prepared and exhibited, and the lands therein are to be put
up for sale from time to time; the highest bidding to be
accepted, provided it should at least amount to five shillings
per acre; ten per cent, deposit is to be made; and the balance
paid within one calendar month; the lots to be put up for sale to
comprise 640 acres at least. Such are the plans devised for
encouraging capitalists to go out to these colonies; and with a
view to supply them with labourers as well as to relieve the
counties in the south of England, supposed to be over populous,
and to place agricultural labourers in usefulness and comfort on
their arrival, several measures are proposed.</p>
<p>A tax is recommended to be laid in the colonies on convict
labour, which tax is to be extended to those convicts who have
tickets of leave; a fund is to be raised from the sale of land,
which will be applicable to the expenses of sending emigrants;
the labourers so sent out are to be hired for a stated period,
not more than seven years, and during that time one-fourth of the
wages they receive is to be paid to Government, till the advance
made for defraying the cost of their passage is paid, when, of
course, such payment will cease; and last, an abatement in the
purchase or redemption of quit-rents, now payable, is suggested
upon the principle adopted with the Van Diemen's Land Company for
taking out a limited number of free emigrants in 1827, which was
a remission of twenty pounds for each woman and sixteen pounds
for each man then sent by the Company.</p>
<p>Such are the plans proposed to encourage emigration. But his
Majesty's Government have paid more particular attention to
induce the emigration of females, and it would be impossible to
devise any measure more important to the Australian colonies than
to afford assistance to the emigration of young and respectable
women; and it would be equally beneficial to the young women
themselves, for whether in domestic employment, or in those
portions of work in field husbandry and the management of
dairies, to which they are fit, there is abundance of
employment.</p>
<p>The estimated expense of sending out young women is sixteen
pounds each, and the committee of emigration appointed by
Government proptrae, that half that amount should be defrayed by
the parents or by the young women, either from their own funds or
private subscription, which they may be able to raise, and the
other half from the colonial treasury; and reckoning that from
the sources just enumerated £10,000 will be this year at the
disposal of Government, they propose sending 1200 female
emigrants, namely, 800 to Sydney and 400 to Van Diemen's Land. An
annual supply of that number will be most advantageous, and a
greater boon could not be given to the colonies.</p>
<p>Circulars have been printed which not only shew the anxiety of
Government upon this subject, but the pains which are taken to
ascertain the character and conduct of such who are desirous to
emigrate, and every encouragement is held out for
applications.</p>
<p>But whether emigration of adults or of children be best, it is
manifest that great changes must be made with respect to the
treatment of convicts. It is not intended to promote or encourage
the increase of punishment farther than that increase tends to
check and prevent crime at home and promote free emigration; but
unless some change take place, the encouragement of crime will go
on. The wisdom of parliament will best devise the proper
measures.</p>
<p>Let these changes be made and agricultural labourers will be
eager to try their fortunes in British colonies and will be no
longer reluctant to let their children go where their cont duct
will be watched, and they will be encouraged to industry and
honesty. Another act of our Government which tends to depress and
retard the prosperity of these distant colonies, is the duties
which are imposed upon produce imported from thence, and
particularly corn. Great part of Van Diemen's Land is a corn
country, and the quality of the wheat excellent: encouragement to
grow wheat cannot arise from a demand for the supply of their own
population, for the cultivation of a very small surface would
suffice for the food of 25,000 persons; the farmer, therefore,
must depend upon demand from other countries. New South Wales for
three years successively suffered so much from drought that it
became almost dependent upon Van Diemen's Land for bread. At that
time the price of wheat advanced to ten shillings per bushel. On
the return of more propitious seasons, in the upper Colony, the
price of wheat fell to four shillings per bushel in Van Diemen's
Land, and at that price shipments were made to England, It is
evident that four shillings per bushel could not remunerate the
grower, the shipment might answer to the merchants; but from the
great fluctuation in the price of wheat at home, with the heavy
expense of such a voyage, they could make no calculation as to
the result of their shipments; and instead of a safe trade, it
becomes speculative. If the average price of wheat in England is
under sixty-seven shillings per quarter, a duty of five shillings
per quarter is imposed even from our own colonies. Surely, when
Government hold out encouragement to emigration, they ought to
protect production from such a heavy tax. The very act is an
anomaly: they virtually say, "we wish you to go out, we will do
all we can for you, but we will not allow you to send your corn
home. You may try to find a market in the East Indies, Brazil, or
any where else; but if you attempt to compete with your fellow
subject, the English farmer, we will, by tax, effectually punish
your presumption." When the com of Van Diemen's Land has to
traverse half the circumference of the globe, that alone ought to
be as much tax as the landowner can desire; and thus the Van
Diemen's Land farmer would cultivate wheat with confidence,
because the merchants would, at certain prices, always send part
of the surplus to England. It was wisely ordered, that the tax
imposed on wool coming from the Australian colonies should be
repealed, and the same encouragement&mdash;it might be called by
the fashionable phrase of the day, protection&mdash;ought to be
extended to all their products.</p>
<p>Hides imported dry pay a duty of 2<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. per
cwt. and wet, 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. per cwt., when tanned and not
otherwise dressed, they pay 3<i>d</i>. per lb. Sheep skins
undressed. 1<i>s</i>. per dozen. Beef cured, 12<i>s</i>. per cwt.
Oil 1<i>s</i>. per ton. All these taxes are injurious to an
infant colony, and raise very little revenue. The following
articles are allowed to be imported free till January 1833: bark,
flax, and wood for ship building eighteen inches square. Whilst,
therefore, this subject must come under the consideration of
parliament during the present session, in order to regulate the
trade after January next, it is hoped the importation of every
article from these distant colonies will be admitted free, so as
to remove and prevent impediment and restriction to their
prosperity. Lord Bacon says, "Let there be freedom from custom
till the plantation be of strength, and not only freedom from
custom, but freedom to carry their commodities where they may
make the best of them.</p>
<p>"When the plantation grows to strength, then it is time to
plant with women as well as with men; that the plantation may
spread into generations." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Bacon's Essays.]</p>
<p>Such are some of the disadvantages against which the
Australian colonies have had to contend; difficulties natural to
all new countries&mdash;difficulties arising from the distance of
markets&mdash;difficulties arising from unwise regulations with
respect to convict labour, and difficulties from taxation at
home; and yet these have been surmounted, and settlers, after
suffering hardships and privation for some years, which they
little expected and for which they were not prepared, have
surmounted them, and wool, which is the main article of commerce,
is rapidly improving in quality as well as increasing in
quantity.</p>
<p>With progressive advances the price of land in Van Diemen's
Land must increase. In its early settlement, government gave
grants of land where it was likely to be cleared, but now, seeing
that it thereby got into bad hands, and if cultivated at all, not
so as to improve the country, they have fixed a minimum price at
5<i>s</i>. per acre for the worst land in the worst situations;
and when the crown lands are sold, beginning at that price, the
bidders at public sale give what they conceive to be the value.
The land on the north coast has been sold at 15<i>s</i>. and
20<i>s</i>. per acre, and good locations are now becoming so
scarce that the property which has been held by individuals for
two or three years has increased in value from ten to a hundred
fold, and must still further increase with greater population and
more extended cultivation.</p>
<p>The proprietors, therefore, of the Van Diemen's Land Company
will see that they have been and are in the same situation as the
common settler. They have had similar difficulties to contend
against, but under the most prudent and skilful management of
their chief agent, their flocks and their herds have increased,
the lands cleared, the roads made; and they, like the common
settler, are beginning to reap the fruits of their outlay and
their patience. Their sheep will increase most rapidly, their
cattle and their horses will increase in a similar proportion,
their outlays will diminish, and soon cease, and the importation
of produce together with the sale of stock in the colony will
soon pay interest, whilst their investment in land, the original
cost of which was so small, will advance in value with that of
their neighbours.</p>
<p>Whatever contributes to the prosperity of the colony must be
advantageous to the Van Diemen's Land Company. Bad management
might destroy the hopes of the Company without materially
affecting the colony, but the Company could not flourish if the
colony did not prosper. Every measure, therefore, that can be
promoted for the good of the colony will be beneficial to the
Company, who are settlers in it upon a large scale, and their
prosperity must be also highly advantageous to the colony, which
has already derived great benefit from the establishment. His
Majesty's Government fixed the location at the north-west corner
of the island, which had never been traversed by civilized man; a
nucleus was thereby formed at a distant point, so that in
exploring the country, its character and capabilities might be
developed, roads made to communicate with the located districts,
and the intermediate space made available for private settlers:
whilst, therefore, it would have cost government great expense
and delay to ascertain the nature of that country, the whole has
been explored and an immense tract placed at the disposal of
Government for private settlers. So, also, the colony has derived
great advantages from the capital expended, and from the
Company's stock. It was their interest to send sheep from Europe
of the very purest breed; no pains were spared in the selection;
they have given a character to the stock of the Company, and by
the sale of rams, have improved the sheep of the colony and given
a character to the whole. The introduction of the best breeds of
sheep, horses, cattle, and pigs, are directly advantageous to the
Company, but the benefit is soon felt in the colony. The people,
also, who have been sent out do much good; some who went in the
service of the Company possessed great talents, integrity, and
perseverance; they have had the means of acquiring and diffusing
knowledge as to the capabilities and resources of the island; and
those who have been sent in more humble situations were men of
excellent character and respectable in their stations. All these
do good to the Company, but the benefit is spread over the
society of the island; the interests of the colonists and the
Company are hereby identified; the Company can do nothing
advantageous to' itself without being beneficial to the
colony.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<p class="negindent2">History of the Van Diemen's Land
Company&mdash;Object&mdash;Particulars of the Charter and Act of
Parliament, and Extracts from Annual Reports.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Having</span> thus endeavoured to give some
account of this colony, it now becomes proper to mention the
rise, progress, and present state of the Van Diemen's Land
Company; and in order to make the proprietors well acquainted
with that subject, little more is required than to make copious
extracts from the several Reports at the General Annual Meetings.
The first Report, dated 7th March, 1826, was never printed; it
was by far the most important, containing the ground-work of the
establishment, and those plans which were devised and then laid
down, and which have been almost undeviatingly pursued.</p>
<p>The original proprietors and directors took every measure to
make it a sound, not a speculative company. They knew that for
several years there could be no return, and they wisely
determined that no interest should be paid from capital, but
should commence when there was such an income from produce and
profit as would allow dividends after the payment of all the
expenses of the establishment. This course has been the means of
locking up capital for some years but so soon as dividends
commence, the advantage will be felt in the amount of the
division. It will be seen, that the progress made by the Company
has been very similar to that of a private settler, who has been
invariably exposed to difficulties and disappointments till he
has brought a certain portion of land under cultivation, and
raised a stock of sheep, cattle, and horses; but these
difficulties surmounted, and such stock being obtained, he has
gradually risen to prosperity and wealth, the live stock
increasing both in number and value, his wool improving, and his
land becoming each year more valuable. It is that point the Van
Diemen's Land Company has now attained, and the Reports will show
its gradual progressive advance. The following is almost the
whole of the First Report:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="negindent3"><span class="aa">Extract</span> from the
<span class="aa">Report</span> made to the first yearly General
Meeting of the Proprietors of the Van Diemen's Land Company, held
at he Company's office, the 7th March, 1826.</p>
<p>"The Governor, Deputy Governor, and Directors of the Van
Diemen's Land Company have great satisfaction in meeting the
Proprietors at their first general court, and congratulating them
on the success of those exertions which have led to the
establishment of the undertaking by an act of parliament and a
royal charter; the former of which is dated the 10th of June,
1825, and the latter passed the great seal on the 10th of
November last.</p>
<p>"The time necessarily consumed in the progress of these
measures has caused the proceedings of the Court of Directors, in
the general concerns of the Company, to be considerably advanced
before an opportunity was afforded of making any public Report on
the subject. In a very early stage of the application to
government for a legal sanction of the Company, a pledge was
exacted, that the shares should not be issued to the public, so
as to become a marketable or speculative property until the
'Charter should be obtained. This pledge has been redeemed; but
the Directors have felt that they would not be honourably
fulfilling the intentions of government, unless they acted in all
other respects in conformity with the prohibition. It is for this
reason that they have, contrary to the example of other
companies, forborne to issue a Prospectus, and to invite a
general application for their shares. This omission calls upon
them to enter a little more fully into their plans and
proceedings; and will excuse them for occupying more of the time
of this General Court with details, than they would otherwise be
disposed to do. Setting out, however, with a full and clear
exposition of what has hitherto been done; of the ends they have
in view; and the means by which they propose to accomplish those
ends; little will be required at their future meetings, than to
follow their general plan through its successive stages. If zeal
and exertion can insure success, the Directors feel assured, that
their Reports to the future General Courts will be gratifying to
the Proprietors, and encouraging to themselves.</p>
<p>"It is little more than twenty years since the first
settlement was made by the British on the Island of Van Diemen;
and a few years only have elapsed, since the public in England
began to be acquainted with its soil, climate, and productions.
Interesting as it has been found to be to the naturalist, it is
no less so when considered as an addition, to our already
extensive colonial empire. The regularity and salubrity of its
climate, the variety of its surface, affording dry and extensive
downs, covered with natural grass and herbage, and alternating
with rich and well watered valleys; the whole moderately
timbered, but in general free from those dense masses of wood and
jungle, which so frequently cover the lands in the tropical and
temperate regions, point it out as a country having some striking
and very peculiar advantages for the purposes of pasturage and
agriculture.</p>
<p>"Viewed in relation to its geographical position, the island
of Van Diemen presents to the eye of the politician prospective
advantages do leas attracting. The neighbouring seas have been of
late years a great and increasing resort for vessels engaged in
the Southern Whale and Seal Fishery, many of which are either
fitted out in Van Diemen's Land, or call there for supplies. By
its proximity to the Indian and Chinese, seas, it has the power
of supplying the tropical countries of the East with all the
productions of the temperate zone. The facility. also, with which
a commercial intercourse may be maintained with both the eastern
and western coasts of America, the maritime parts of which are
fast rising into wealth and importance, all concur in ensuring to
it its full share of benefit in the new and boundless fields of
commerce that are yearly opening to the commercial states of both
hemispheres.</p>
<p>"There cannot be a greater proof of the estimation in which
this island is held, than the rigidity with which the
colonization of it has advanced, and the eagerness with which the
fertile portions of its land have been sought after and settled.
Its population, which in 1810 was only 1256, holding 559 acres of
land, amounted in 1821, to 7285, holding 723,679 acres. The
estimated population of 1823, was 12,000; and the quantity of
land granted in the two last mentioned years, was, according to
Mr. Evans, the Deputy Surveyor-General, 132,570 acres. The stock
of sheep, which in 1810 was 3070, in 1821 was 170,391; an
increase in eleven years nearly in the proportion of from one to
sixty; while other live stock have multiplied in a corresponding
ratio. Its growing wealth as a commercial colony may be estimated
by the value of the merchandize imported into it, which, in 1816,
amounted to £47,256; and in 1822, to £112,982; having nearly
tripled in only six years.</p>
<p>"It was not to be expected that resources and indications of
growing wealth such as these, should long escape the penetration
of the British public, nor that individuals, whose pursuits in
trade or agriculture had led them to the island, should conceive
the project of uniting together in order to have the command of a
larger capital than the colonists have hitherto been able to
afford, and to obtain possession of a sufficient tract of land to
realize all the advantages held out by this highly favoured
country.</p>
<p>"There were other considerations, however, of much greater
importance as connected with our home manufactures, which led to
the formation of a company for agricultural purposes in Van
Diemen's Land; and it was chiefly in furtherance of these, that
on the 12th of May, 1824, a meeting was held at which it was
unanimously resolved to apply to government for a grant of
500,000 acres. About this time Colonel Sorell, the late
Lieutenant-Governor, arrived from the colony; when he was applied
to by Earl Bathurst for his opinion of the measure. Although he
differed somewhat from the opinions given to the Directors in
other quarters, as to the quantity of good land in the colony
unappropriated; yet the Court had the satisfaction to find, that
their undertaking had the support of this intelligent officer;
who, whilst he was in authority in Van Diemen's Land, had applied
all the resources of his well informed mind to the improvement of
the island; and having its prosperity still warmly at heart,
suggested a considerable extension of the privileges first asked
for.</p>
<p>"The Court has the satisfaction to say, that throughout the
whole of the negociation, whether for the grant of land, the act
of parliament, or the charter, the Directors have had the cordial
assistance of the Right Honourable Earl Bathurst, and of every
other department of government, in such a way as to convince
them, that as a body they possess its entire confidence and good
wishes.</p>
<p>"With respect to the selection of the lands to be granted to
the Company, the following rules were laid down by Earl Bathurst,
in a letter dated the 15th of April, 1825:</p>
<p>"'The Van Diemen's Land Company will receive their grant in
the north-west district of the island; bounded on the north by
Bass's Straits, on the west by the ocean, and on the east and
south by lines drawn from either shore, so as to afford the
necessary depth of country; within that district they will be at
liberty to select any ungranted land at their own discretion.
These lands, however, must be in one continuous and unbroken
tract, approximating to the form of a square, as near as may be
compatible with preserving a clear and well defined natural
boundary.'</p>
<p>"The whole quantity of <i>useful</i> land, that is, of land
capable of being used in pasturage and tillage, to be contained
in this square, is 250,000 acres. Whatever useless and
unproductive land may be included in order to complete the square
figure, will be granted to the Company gratuitously.</p>
<p>"It is arranged that the survey of the land to be thus granted
to the Company, shall be carried into effect by five
Commissioners; of whom two will be named by the crown, and two by
the Company; the fifth to be elected by the four thus appointed.
The majority of these Commissioners will concur in a report on
the lands; stating with all possible precision the exact limits
of the grant, and also the relative number of acres capable of
being employed in pasturage and tillage, or otherwise. So soon as
the limits of the intended grant shall be thus settled, the
Governor is authorized to issue a grant of it to the Company.</p>
<p>"In the grant a quit-rent will be charged, amounting to thirty
shillings per annum for every £100, of the value of the good and
productive land comprised in it. This quit-rent will not become
payable until the expiration of five years from the date of the
grant; and upon giving six months' notice in writing to the local
government, the Company will be at liberty to redeem the
quit-rent or any part of it, by paying into the colonial treasury
a sum equal to twenty times the amount of the rent proposed to be
extinguished, when so much of the land will be released from all
future payments.</p>
<p>"If the local government shall be able and willing to supply
the Company with convict labourers not exceeding the number of
free labourers employed by them in their grant, the Company may
accept such convicts, and employ and maintain them at their own
expense. The employment and maintenance by the Company of these
convicts, will be allowed in payment of the quit-rent or purchase
money: it being estimated that government has saved £16 sterling
by each convict wholly kept and maintained by the Company for one
year.</p>
<p>"The value to be put upon the land only remained to be
settled, and it appearing to the Directors, that it would on
every account be desirable to have it fixed in England, while
they yet had the assistance and local information of their
Secretary, Mr. Curr, in the negociation; as well as to obviate
the possibility of those difficulties and delays which might
arise in a mixed body of Commissioners, acted upon, possibly,
more or less, by local and particular interests, a letter was, on
the 1st of September, addressed to Earl Bathurst, requesting that
his Majesty's Government would at once impose such a price upon
it as might appear just, both as respected the interests of the
public and the Company; instead of the value being left to be
fixed in the colony, in the manner originally proposed.</p>
<p>"In compliance with this request, and to place the Company in
the same situation as it would have been in when they first
applied for the grant of land and charter, it has been agreed
that the price at which the land shall be valued to the Company
shall be two shillings and sixpence per acre of good pasturage
and tillage, on which a quit-rent of one and a-half, or thirty
shillings per £100, is imposed, equal to £468 15<i>s</i>. per
annum, payable in the-manner already described; which at twenty
years' purchase amounts to £9575 sterling.</p>
<p>"Since the arrangements for this purchase were concluded,
accounts have been received from the island, of the local
government having issued a notice, that they will not grant any
more lands, until provision has been made for public purposes.
The point to which the Directors had been so fortunate as to
conduct their negociation, prior to the receipt of this
intelligence, as well as the instructions which will in pursuance
of the agreement have been gives to the government of the colony,
exempt the Company from the operation of this notice.</p>
<p>"According to the terms of the charter, the pursuits in which
the Company is allowed to employ its capital are, the cultivating
and improving such waste lands as shall be granted in pursuance
of the agreement already made with Government, including erecting
buildings and machinery thereon, constructing roads, canals,
bridges, and such other works, as are requisite to carry on and
perfect the cultivation; and the sending out and advancing money
to persons willing and desirous to settle upon their lands.</p>
<p>"They have also liberty, subject to certain provisions, to
open and work mines of coal, iron, and other minerals; and to
quarry without restriction or condition for stone, lime, clay,
and other materials for building; to make loans or advances of
money to resident colonists, as well as individuals, as
partnerships, on the security of their lands within the colony;
also on mortgages, bonds, and judgments; to contract for and
execute any public works which may be undertaken by Government
within the island and its dependencies; to make loans and
advances upon the security of tolls and other public taxes,
within the island and its dependencies; to make loans to persons
engaged in the whale or seal fisheries, upon or in the
neighbourhood of the coasts of the island, for the purpose of
carrying on the fisheries; and lastly, to purchase and hold
houses, wharfs, and other buildings, and also lands and
hereditaments within the island and its dependencies.</p>
<p>"To some of these pursuits and privileges, more particularly
the lending of money, there are limits assigned, either as to
time or amount, or both, of which the object is, not to debar the
Company from the exercise of their chartered lights, but to guard
against their interference with the pursuits of trade or banking,
from both of which, by a special clause, they are interdicted;
but reservation is made that an extension of time or amount may
be granted, provided the Company shall be able to shew good
grounds for the request.</p>
<p>"Of these multifarious pursuits, agriculture and pasturage
have been selected for the present, as offering in the infancy of
the establishment the most beneficial, and at the same time the
least hazardous investments for the capital of the Company. The
instructions given to the commissioners and agents already
despatched are, to confine their attention, on their first
arrival, to the selection of the lands; and then to form such
farming and other establishments upon them, and to bring such a
quantity of acres into cultivation as shall insure subsistence to
the people, and afford shelter and protection to the stock and
other property collected upon them. They are strictly prohibited
entering into any other engagements or undertakings on behalf of
the Company, until these great and primary objects are
accomplished, or until further instructions shall be given, them
from hence. In all their undertakings, it has been impressed upon
them to proceed only on a scale commensurate with their actual or
probable wants, and then, on the most economical footing. When
these preliminary undertakings are in a state of sufficient
forwardness, the Court (no way forgetful of the leading object of
the Company, the growth of fine wool) is resolved to pursue the
cultivation of this lucrative production on a liberal scale.</p>
<p>"The facts and opinions adduced by those who are best
acquainted with the island, and with wool as a material in our
manufactures, so important to the mother country, concur in
persuading the Court that the climate of Van Diemen's Land la
favourable in the highest degree to sheep: that the animal
thrives as well, and is as free from disease as in the most
genial parts of Europe; and that the wool is not only capable of
all the melioration and improvement which it is found to attain
in Europe, but possesses some of the qualities most essential to
the woollen manufactures, in a degree superior even to the
choicest fleeces of Spain and Germany. The most remarkable of
these peculiarities is the high fulling property by which both
the coarse and fine wools are distinguished, and on account of
which they are eagerly purchased by our manufacturers. The Court
has also the most respectable authority for asserting, that they
are found to work much better and to prove softer, than any other
wool of the same degree of fineness.</p>
<p>"The quality of wool which it may best suit the Company's
purpose to produce, must be left in a certain degree to future
experience, suffice it to say at present, that they have their
choice; and that they have only to put upon their lands sheep of
any breed, to have in a very few years large flocks of any
description. It is the present intention of the Court to keep
separate flocks of the most esteemed breeds, not only to have the
facility of supplying the market with the quality of wool that
maybe most in request, but in order that by experiments in
crossing, and an attentive practice of those rules which
experience has taught the most successful breeders of the
Continent, a steady and progressive improvement may be
insured.</p>
<p>"Confiding in the correctness of these views, the Court has
resolved to commence as early as possible the formation of the
Company's flocks, and by an immediate exportation of sheep, not
to suffer even one season to be lost, the produce of which, if
estimated according to the progressive rate of increase in this
branch of rural economy, will be in a few years sensibly felt in
their profits.</p>
<p>"Agreements have been entered into for an early shipment of a
considerable number of selected merinos; and the Court is
cultivating a correspondence, through which it will be able,
hereafter, either to make large additions, if numbers should be
desirable, or frequent small shipments of a superior breed, if
quality should appear most advantageous.</p>
<p>"Having premised thus much as to what are the leading
privileges obtained from his Majesty's Government for the
Company, and having stated which of all those objects have been
selected as most likely to realize the expectations of the
subscribers, the Court will proceed to explain the nature of the
constitution which it has been thought advisable to form for
conducting the affairs of the Company.</p>
<p>"The capital is £1,000,000 sterling, divided into 10,000
shares of £100 each.</p>
<p>"The general management of the affairs of the Company, is
vested in a Governor, Deputy-Governor, eighteen Directors, and
three Auditors.</p>
<p>"A court of the Directors is required to be held at least once
in every month, and a general court of Proprietors on the first
Tuesday in the month of March in every year, or within fourteen
days after, of which fourteen days' notice are to be given.</p>
<p>"All elections and all questions at such general meetings of
Proprietors, are to be decided by the majority of votes of the
members present, each member being entitled to vote in proportion
to the number of shares held by him, in the following order:</p>
<br>
<table align="center" summary="p114">

<p>It is required that the books of the Company be written up and
balanced to the 31st December in each year, and the same being so
balanced and approved by the court of Directors, an abstract
thereof, shewing the state of the debts and credits of the
Company, signed by two or more of the auditors, shall be produced
at the next following yearly general meeting.</p>
<p>"Power is given to the general courts of Proprietors to pass
bye-laws; and in other respects the provisions both of the act of
parliament and charter are so similar to those of other corporate
and joint stock companies, that it is not deemed necessary to
particularize them."</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to make any extracts from the second annual
Report, dated 13th March, 1827, The Proprietors were merely
informed of the arrival of Mr. Curr and those who went out with
him. They had, however, commenced to explore the north-west side
of the island, and had fixed their establishment at Circular
Head. The third Report, dated 10th March, 1828, is interesting,
shewing the discoveries of the Hampshire and Surrey Hills by Mr.
Hellyer, and from which the following is extracted.</p>
<br>
<p class="negindent3"><span class="aa">Extract</span> from the
<span class="aa">Report</span> made to the third yearly General
Meeting of the Van Diemen's Land Company; held at the Company's
office in Broad Street, the 18th of March, 1828.</p>
<p>"At the last annual meeting on the 13th of March, 1827, the
Directors took occasion to explain to the Proprietors, the
progress that had bees made towards the acquisition of a tract of
land, suitable to the purposes for which the Company was formed;
and concluded by informing them, that a station had been selected
at Circular Head for the first establishment, around which there
appeared a prospect of finding a sufficiency of good and useful
land, although lying somewhat scattered and divided.</p>
<p>"It being necessary to provide immediate shelter for the
people and an early supply of agricultural produce for the
subsistence of the establishment, the farming servants were
employed in clearing land and the mechanics in erecting huts and
other temporary accommodations. In the mean time the Company's
surveyors, under the direction of the agents, were engaged in a
more extended examination of the north-west portion of the
island, to a considerable distance from Circular Head, with a
view to determine the situation and boundaries of the future
grant.</p>
<p>"Circular Head is a peninsula, computed to contain about 8000
acres of land; of which 4000 may be considered good sheep land,
being for the most part dry, open, grassy hills, with a herbage
of fine grass, trefoil, cinquefoil, and wild vetches, equal, in
the spring season, to any English meadow. About 2000 acres are
woody, being thinly covered with small trees, growing similar to
the hawthorn in England, and affording excellent shelter for
sheep. Many parts are rocky, but the most part abounds in grass,
and the whole is capable of being converted into sheep pasture at
a comparatively small expense. As a homestead and a principal
agricultural establishment, Mr. Curr, the Company's chief agent,
writes that nothing can surpass it</p>
<p>"The adjacent country, although it contains some considerable
portions of excellent meadow and grazing land, with a narrow slip
of good sheep-run down the west coast, was found to consist in
general, of barren heathy plains and low swampy forests; so that
a sufficient tract of land suitable for a large sheep farm could
not be had, without extending the boundaries over a wider space
than could either have been allowed by Government or have been
convenient to the Company.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hellyer, the Company's chief surveyor, was therefore
despatched on the 1st of February, 1827, on an expedition to the
southward, to examine a large open district, which on former
excursions had been seen from two different points of view, and
promised to realize the best hopes of the agents; After a painful
journey on foot, with only two attendants, in which the party
patiently endured privations and surmounted difficulties,
calculated to arrest the progress of less enterprising
travellers, they came on the 13th upon grassy hills, of the
extent of which they had previously no idea. Crossing these and
passing through a considerable tract of myrtle forest, they
forded a wide and deep river flowing to the north, which they
named the Emu. On the 14th they arrived at the base of a lofty
hill, which was named after the day, Valentine's Peak. From the
summit and from an elevation of 3000 feet, they saw a fine open
country to the north-east and south-west. Descending the south
side of the hill, they alighted in the evening upon grassy hills
and knolls, resembling a neglected old park in England; 1000 to
1500 acres in a patch, and without a tree, except a few clumps of
blackwood. Kangaroos were here in abundance, as in every other
part of the country about to be described; a sure sign of the
goodness of the soil and herbage. A brook runs across this
district, the banks of which are green with trefoil. Proceeding
in a direction west-south-west, they passed through an excellent
country, consisting of gently rising, dry, grassy hills. On the
following day they walked over many considerable hills, the grass
of which had recently been burned by the natives, and soon after
came to a noble river, with a strong current, gliding smoothly
along from south to north, and which they named the Don by way of
distinction. At that part it was about sixty yards wide, and in
the shallowest place, up to their middles in crossing. On its
banks are complete sloping shrubberies. At some distance from
this river, (Mr. Hellyer proceeds to state) they ascended the
most magnificent grassy hill he had seen in the island, the sides
consisting of several level terraces, as if laid out by art, and
the top crowned with a straight row of stately pepper, mint
trees, beyond which there was not a tree for four miles along the
grassy hills. He congratulated himself on having had so fine a
day as the preceding, or he could have had a very imperfect idea
of the extent of good country around him. The plains, or rather
hills, which he had just passed over, he named, from their extent
and importance, the Surrey Hills, being about the same distance
inland as that county in England. He describes them as resembling
English enclosures in many respects, being bounded by brooks
between each, with belts of beautiful shrubs in every vale. The
grasses in the line of their walk, were principally timothy,
foxtail, and single kangaroo. The surface soil is a dark
vegetable mould upon a rich brown open loam, of various depths,
and lighter in colour according to its depth; but the substratum
is every where gravelly, which appears to render these hills
perfectly dry. All the brooks have hard pebbly bottoms, are free
from mud, and the water is as clear as crystal. The trees found
on these bills are generally of fine growth, very tall and
straight, some of them measuring a hundred feet to the lowest
branch, and stand a hundred yards apart. This Mr. Hellyer does
not think at all too thickly timbered to afford a shade from the
summer heat; and it should be remembered, that the trees of Van
Diemen's Land do not cover the ground as in England. In number
they did not average more than about ten to an acre. There were
many open plains hereabout, of several square miles, without a
single tree. The plains or hills to the north of the peak, being
the first open country Mr. Hellyer entered upon in this journey,
he has named the Hampshire Hills. They appear even more parklike
than the Surrey Hills, and are handsomely clumped with trees. The
course of the party from the peak had now carried them nearly
twenty miles; and as far as they were able to see, there arose on
all sides grassy hills out of number, which it was delightful to
look round upon from one higher than the rest. In tracing their
way back to Circular Head, they came to the bend of a deep and
rapid river, larger than the Don already described, and more than
ten feet deep close to the banks. This they named the Arthur, in
compliment to his Excellency the Lieutenant Governor, being one
of the principal rivers of the island. Of the two districts now
described, that named the Surrey Hills appears, upon a map drawn
by Mr. Hellyer, to be nearly a parallelogram, thirty miles in
length and fifteen in breadth, lying at a distance of about
twenty-five miles from Bass's Straits at the nearest point. That
called the Hampshire Hills, lying between the former and the
north coast, is of a less regular figure, and may be computed to
be about ten miles in length by eight in breadth. The river Emu
runs through the Hampshire Hills into Bass's Straits. The Arthur,
which passes through the Surrey Hills, is supposed to enter the
western sea. The course of the Don is not yet sufficiently
known.</p>
<p>"The description given by Mr. Hellyer of the country travelled
over by him in this interesting journey, has since been confirmed
by Mr. Foasey, another surveyor of the Company, who, entering it
from the eastward, came upon a different part of the Surrey
Hills; and, crossing the river called the Leven, represents the
country in its vicinity as so admirably laid out by nature, that
it assumes very much the appearance of a nobleman's domain, both
as to extent and good quality. Mr. Fossey adds, that from actual
observation, these tracts of land both as to extent and quality,
are likely to suit the purpose for which they are required.</p>
<p>"These concurring narratives immediately determined the agents
on looking to the district of the hills as their future site of
the Company's grant; and the Directors have the satisfaction to
report, that a minute of agreement has been signed on behalf of
the Company, by which permission has been obtained of his
Majesty's Government, to select one block of 20,000 acres at
Circular Head; and two blocks, to comprise together 220,000 acres
in the districts just described, all at the valuation originally
agreed upon. The useless or unprofitable land which it may be
necessary to include, in order to give a well-defined boundary,
will be granted to the Company gratuitously, according to the
stipulation mentioned in the last Report, and is allowed to
extend to one-fourth part of the whole grant, or an addition (if
needful) of 62,500 acres. A fourth block of 10,000 acres will be
selected at the option of the Company, at some point intermediate
between the larger grant and the settled districts."</p>
<br>
<p>An Appendix was given to that Report, containing some
interesting accounts given of the country explored by Mr.
Alexander Goldie, Mr. Henry Hellyer, and Mr. Joseph Fossey, and
the danger, fatigue, and sufferings they encountered, which
reports are inserted in the note at p. 156.</p>
<br>
<hr class="tenth">
<br>
<p class="negindent3">The following is extracted from the Report
made to the fourth yearly General Meeting of the Van Diemen's
Land Company; held at the Company's Office in Broad Street, the
17th of March, 1829.</p>
<p>"The attention and labours of the Company's agent during the
past year, have been chiefly directed to carrying on the works
and cultivation at Circular Head; to opening a road from Emu Bay
to the Hampshire Hills, and thence to the Surrey Hills; to making
another road from the neighbourhood of Launceston to meet the
former in the Surrey Hills; to forming stock stations in those
two districts, removing thither the Company's flocks and herds,
and to their pasturage and increase&mdash;upon all which subjects
the Directors purpose to offer a few brief, but, they trust, very
satisfactory explanations.</p>
<p>"At Circular Head about 100 acres of land had been broken up
in April, 1827, and sixty acres more in the following season,
making 160 acres under the plough, and bearing wheat, barley,
oats, turnips, potatoes, and other crops suitable to the wants of
the establishment. Two abundant crops of excellent hay had been
got in, made entirely from the native grasses, sufficient for the
consumption of the stock of cattle. The principal buildings
erecting or finished at this point are, a commodious house,
weather-boarded and shingled, the frame and fittings of vhich
were sent from England; a smaller house for the use of the
superior officers of the establishment; cottages and huts for the
servants and for the labouring classes; a large storehouse; a
barn and threshing machine; shops and work-places for the
different artizans; requisite sheds for sheep and cattle. The
surrounding land had been fenced and drained under the able
direction of Mr. Goldie. A substantial, but not expensive pier or
jetty of wood, had been constructed at the north-west point of
the harbour, under the direction of Mr. Hellyer, at which the
Tranmere and the smaller vessels had discharged their cargoes.
These constitute the improvements which the Directors, at
present, contemplate making at this place: it will be valuable as
a homestead, not only in consideration of the improvements
actually made there, and of its affording an abundant supply of
agricultural produce, but on account of its offering a good
harbour in which large vessels can load and discharge.</p>
<p>"This feature alone is a sufficient motive with the Directors
for having stipulated for it as a part of their grant.</p>
<p>"The Company's officers have also formed a small establishment
at the mouth of the Emu river, about thirty miles eastward of
Circular Head, affording good anchorage within, but having a bar
across the entrance, which renders it accessible only to small
vessels and colonial craft; for these, however, it seems likely
to prove an useful station. The works undertaken at this place
consist of a small but substantial wooden pier or jetty; a store
or warehouse; a stable; and as many huts as are requisite for the
people employed in that vicinity.</p>
<p>"The most important works which the Company's servants have
undertaken during the last year have been opening roads; one from
Emu river and the other from Launceston, to the Surrey and
Hampshire Hills; the first from Emu river, under the
superintendence of Mr. Hellyer, had been cut into the Hampshire
Hills, in the course of which several plains or open spaces were
found, well adapted for the pasturage of cattle, 'on their
journey from the coast into the interior; the other road under
the direction of Mr. Fossey, from Launceston westward, through
Moleside, Emu Plains, and Hounslow Heath, into the Surrey and
Hampshire Hills. On the 2d of February, 1828, this road was
completed as far as four miles westward of the Mersey, or about
seventy miles from Launceston, and it was expected to be carried
into the Hampshire Hills in about two months more. Carts had been
driven upon this road as far as it was then opened, and a drove
of cattle had passed by it to the Mersey river, and thence to the
Company's settlement at Emu Bay. The great advantages to which
the Directors look forward, in having established this
communication, is not merely the transit of their own stores and
produce to and from a principal shipping port, and to the second
town in the island, but the encouragement it will afford to
settlers to establish themselves in the country through which the
road passes, which abounds with plots of rich land, and others
fit for sheep pasture, well adapted for farms, the occupation and
cultivation of which must enhance the value of the Company's
property, and have other beneficial effects on their interest.
The Directors, also, cannot help feeling that they have thereby
conferred an important benefit on the colony, by laying open and
rendering accessible so extensive and fertile a district The two
roads now described being completed, Mr. Hellyer was instructed
to continue his operations into the Surrey Hills, whilst Mr.
Fossey carried on his road until it joined Mr. Hellyer's in the
same district; all of which it was hoped would be accomplished by
the ensuing winter. In the mean time a station, or homestead, had
been selected at the Hampshire Hills, comprising every advantage
of that district, and another was ordered to be fixed on at the
Surrey Hills.</p>
<p>The following brief notices, extracted from Mr. Curr's account
of his visit to the Hampshire and Surrey Hilts, will convey a
tolerably accurate idea of the country.</p>
<p>"'The first eight miles of the coast ran through a thick
forest, after which comes a succession of small plains, which lie
in the midst of the forest, in or near to the Hampshire Hills.
These plains: are all of the same character, sound, light, dry
soil; the rock in parts appearing through the surface, well
watered by springs and creeks, apd surrounded by the best timber;
the grass is coarse, but plentiful, affording good cattle
pasture, and, after burning, sheep may be kept moderately well
upon them; they seem adapted for small arable farms in the hands
of tenants. From the last of these-plains, which has been named
'Highclere', the road passes through four miles more of forest,
when it opens on the Hampshire Hills, a district which comprises
from 9,000 to 10,000 acres of clear land. The soil resembles that
of the plains just described, and the grass is generally adapted:
for the feeding of sheep; indeed, it is decidedly a sheep
country, though it may not bear to be heavily stocked. As
respects water, the Hampshire Hills are incomparably more happily
circumstanced than aoy other district in the island, the want of
streams being one of the greatest and most general faults of Van
Diemen's Land. Here every valley has its spring, or stream of
purest water, running invariably over a clear pebbly bottom, and
many of them are deep and strong enough to be useful fences. The
Emu River, which is about twenty-two yards wide and two feet
deep, runs through the midst. There are innumerable situations
well adapted for the erection of grist and saw mills, and the
supply of timber is inexhaustible. This river does not overflow
its banks, being fed by the springs in the mountains.' Mr. Curr
continues, 'I may add, that, in point of picturesque beauty, the
Hampshire Hills yield to nothing I have seen in the island.'</p>
<p>"Of the district of the Surrey Hills the Directors have little
to add to the satisfactory information given in the last Report,
except, that on a second visit made to them by Mr. Curr, on his
journey just alluded to, he found the northern portion to agree
very much with the Hampshire Hills, but the soil and grass to
improve on advancing southward. The climate of this portion of
the island appears to be showery and changeable, sometimes cold;
snow occasionally falls in the interior, but seldom lies. The
soil appears to be naturally dry."</p>
<p>The fifth and sixth Reports, dated 1830 and 1831, give very
few additional particulars with respect to the district to be
allotted to the Company; they mention the completion of the
roads, viz., one laid out and made under the superintendence of
Mr. Fossey, from Launceston through the Surrey Hills; the other
from the Surrey Hills through the Hampshire Hills to Emu Bay, by
Mr. Hellyer, with bridges, which were erected over the rivers and
streams. And they state the definitive arrangements which had
been made with the government at home with respect to the
allotments of land, which were determined upon in the following
locations:&mdash;</p>

fifty-five bags of wool (being the clip of the year 1830) had
been received; that wool has since arrived as well as
seventy-eight bags being the clip of last year, the whole of

<div>making a higher average than fleeces heretofore imported
from Van Diemen's Land, and indicating the excellence of the
stock, which by increased care in the selection, and distribution
of the rams, and by greater attention to the manner in which the
wool is washed and got up, will assuredly improve. It is now
ascertained by experience, that the opinion given in former
Reports has proved correct, the lands at Circular Head and
Woolnorth afford pasturage best fitted for Merino sheep,
producing the finest fleeces. whilst the Surrey and the Hampshire
Kills, as well in soil as in climate, are equally well adapted to
sheep, having heavier fleeces with longer staple, peculiarly
fitted for combing purposes, and comprising in length and
strength the properties of Leicester wool, with softness and fine
hair; the system therefore which has been adopted, is now shewing
its beneficial effects.</div>
<p>By having stud flocks of the best Saxon sheep, of the
Nigretta, the Leicester and Cotswold sheep, kept totally
separate, the shepherds are enabled, by rams from the stud
flocks, to improve the coarse fleeces of the Van Diemen's Land
sheep, purchased in the island. The increase of the flocks has so
far been retarded, by the nature of the country, where, though in
the summer season on the open forests and on the native grasses,
there is abundance of food, they had no means of having provender
in the winter, till a larger extent of country was burnt and
cleared, and English grasses introduced. An opinion has
prevailed, that the flocks might have been much more rapidly
increased: there is no doubt but a superficial observer would in
the summer adopt that opinion; but it is the study of a good and
prudent manager, to regulate his flocks and herds by his means of
support in all seasons and under the worst circumstances. The
increase of the flocks must therefore be governed by the extent
of land which can be prepared for them, and limited by the
quantity of food which can be provided for their support during
winter. This is annually extending upon a large scale, and having
now more than 5000 ewes, each annual Report will shew a great
increase in the flocks.</p>
<p>It is not, however, wool alone by which profit is derived, the
stud flocks become valuable from the annual sale of ram
lambs.</p>

<p>And Mr. Curr writes, "The rams which have been delivered are
so highly thought of, that I feel confident they will insure the
sale of a much larger number next season, indeed it is probable
we shall not be able to supply all that will be wanted."</p>
<p>Cattle are next in importance to sheep in number and value-,
and here too the character of the stock begins to shew its
advantage. The bulls which were sent from this country were of
the pure Durham breed, (descendants of the celebrated bull
Comet,) and the young bulls are now sought for by the
settlers.</p>

<p>There is every probability that the demand for young bulls
will far exceed the supply.</p>
<p>Horses also are a very important part of the stock, and likely
to become more so; the Cleveland horse, sent from hence, is in
high repute, and was last spring sent to the settled districts;
making a very profitable season. One of the blood horses sent by
the George Canning, "Inglemere", was considered the best in the
island.</p>
<p>This stock however is one which requires a greater length of
time, before it can turn to profit, than either sheep or cattle.
Horses are not saleable before they are three, four, or five
years old, and till that age their annual value increases without
much expense; there were twenty-four foals in 1830, and eight
more, viz., thirty-two foals in the last year.</p>

<p>The number of acres of land under the plough is increasing,
but the produce from the livestock is so much more valuable and
marketable, that attention has chiefly been given to the
production of such a quantity of wheat, oats, barley, and
potatoes, as would supply food to the establishments; and this
policy has proved the best, for in consequence of abundant
harvests of late, in the upper as well as the lower colony, the
price of wheat was extremely low, about 4<i>s</i>. per bushel; so
that though the purchase of wheat in Van Diemen's Land, and the
exportation of it to England, (where, in consequence of its very
superior quality, it has sold at 80<i>s</i>. per quarter in Mark
Lane,) has paid well as an article of merchandize, the price at
which it was sold by the farmer in Van Diemen's Land could not
remunerate him. It is evident however that the growth of wheat
may be looked forward to as an important article of produce.</p>
<p>Some very valuable geological discoveries have been made. Mr.
Curr writes, that "beds of Turkey stone, to an inexhaustible
extent apparently, are found at Woolnorth; one bed lies close to
the shore, three or four hundred yards from the anchorage; our
carpenters use it, and say it makes as good sharpening stones as
any Turkey stone bought in England; it also makes perfectly good
hones for razors&mdash;specimens will be sent. Lime-stone and
excellent coal have also been found by Mr. Milligen, at the
Hampshire Hills; lime is particularly valuable and will save
great expense, for the lime hitherto used has been made from
burnt sea-shells collected in Bass's Straits, and conveyed a
great distance for use."</p>
<p>The boundaries of the lands are not yet finally determined. In
order to accomplish that object, Mr. Curr had been to Hobart
Town, and at a personal interview with the Lieutenant-Governor,
proposed certain points from which the measurement of the two
large grants, Woolnorth and the Surrey Hills, should be
calculated and measured; and he also requested a grant of land
between the Hampshire Hills and Emu Bay, through which the road
passes to that port To these proposals the Lieutenant-Governor
had made no objection, but wished Mr. Curr to state them in
writing, which has in consequence been done, and there is no
doubt when the spring was sufficiently advanced, the boundaries
would be defined.</p>
<p>The account which Mr. Curr gives of the people employed on the
establishment, is most satisfactory. There is no necessity for
either military or civil power to keep them in order; they
proceed cheerfully with their labour, and complaint is seldom
heard. This may in some measure be attributed to the care which
has been taken in selecting the free servants, who have been sent
from this country. Good conduct and good character have been
indispensable qualifications; every applicant was rejected upon
whom there was stain or taint, and their previous good character
was the ground of hope that they would be useful and respectable.
In this the Directors have not been disappointed, but in addition
to their good qualities, they have been well managed by Mr. Curr.
Strict, whenever offence has been committed, thoughtful,
considerate and encouraging to all who have conducted themselves
well, he has acquired a moral influence over the people far more
desirable, and with regard to the interests of the Company, far
more advantageous, than coercion, restraint, or punishment; and
it will be a subject of pride to him, as well as satisfaction to
the Proprietors, to find the men who were first sent out by the
Company, and whose agreements for the term of years have expired,
settling themselves in the Island with respectability and
comfort, and with the prospect of seeing their families prosper
in the world. The following extract from Mr. Curr's despatch,
dated Launceston, 4th May, 1831, will be read with interest and
pleasure.</p>
<p>"It has been a source of sincere satisfaction to me, in which
I am sure the Court will participate, to find all the old
indented servants of the Company, who went out per the Tranmere
and Caroline, doing extremely well with not more, I believe, than
one exception, and with the same one exception, very well spoken
of. The farming men are generally in places at wages of from
thirty to fifty guineas a-year with a maintenance; the shepherds
£50 to £60 a-year; the mechanics are chiefly in this town and
earning 10<i>s</i>. per day and upwards: these latter have got
town allotments, and are most of them building or about to build
good brick cottages for themselves."</p>
<p>Thus it follows, that though the Company engage their servants
at low wages, in comparison with what are given in some parts of
the Island, and have them indented for a term of years as a
remuneration for the expense of sending them out with their
families, those men are enabled with their comparative low wages
to save money, and at the expiration of their terms to establish
themselves respectably. The maintenance of families in the Colony
is little felt, as the women can always earn good wages. Mr. Curr
says they can even enrich themselves, and children have ample
employment in the fields and earn sufficient for their
maintenance. It must be also highly gratifying to the Proprietors
to know, that they have thus been the means of enabling
industrious and united families, who, with the utmost toil, were
scarce able to support themselves at home, to live in comfort and
to enrich themselves in Van Diemen's Land; and the number of
respectable persons whom the Company have sent out must place the
establishment in a very favourable point of view both with the
Colonists and the Government.</p>
<p>The Directors have been desirous of encouraging good conduct,
economy, and prudence by every possible means, and are now
establishing a Savings Bank, under the sanction and approbation
of Government, where weekly deposits may accumulate and increase
by interest.</p>
<p>But good conduct is not confined to the free servants; the
assigned servants or convicts behave well under the able and
judicious management of Mr. Curr, who has great advantages from
his insulated situation, distant from the located districts,
having the means of limiting the supply of ardent spirits so as
to prevent the effects of excessive dram drinking, which is much
complained of and is the prevalent vice of the Colony. But
independent of these advantages, the convict labourer knows that
it is his interest to gain the approbation of Mr. Curr, whose
influence over the whole establishment has been formed and
maintained by his own excellent example, and by the power which
he holds over every one placed under his charge; nor does this
account of the good conduct of the people rest altogether on the
authority of Mr. Curr; he writes, on the 20th May
last;&mdash;</p>
<p>"I had some conversation with the Governor respecting the
appointment of a magistrate at the Surrey Hills; the Governor
noticed the quietness of our establishments, the absence of
crime, and the little trouble they cause to the government;
confessed that he had anticipated they would have been a source
of great trouble. In truth, there has scarcely been a
misdemeanour or a complaint to remind him, or any officer of
government, of our existence; other districts, and less populous
settlements, in the colony have their magistrates, constables,
field police, iron gangs, gaols, and barracks; we have nothing of
the sort, and little need of them; and were our settlements more
compact we should have no need of them whatever."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, however, the able management of Mr. Curr, it
must be admitted that it is a duty due to the large population
now there, that suitable provision should be made for religious
instruction and the education of the children; and for the
accomplishment of these important objects the Directors suggest
to the consideration of this meeting, that a respectable
clergyman of the Established Church should be sent out.</p>
<p>The higher officers who went out with Mr. Curr have all left,
or are about to leave, the employment of the Company, their
engagements having been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Mr. Adey is established as a merchant at Hobart Town.</p>
<p>Mr. Goldie is appointed to the superintendence and management
of Sir John Owen's large property in Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>Mr. Hellyer, whose valuable services have been so great, and
whose name is so well known both to the colonial government and
at home, by his unwearied exertions for the Company, by his
personal privation and risk In exploring the country, and by the
admirable maps and plans which have been exhibited, has been
recently appointed to an important situation under the Surveyor
General of the Colony.</p>
<p>Mr. Fossey, Mr. Hellyer's companion in fatigue and equally
indefatigable in his exertions, has been lately in this country,
and returned to Circular Head by the ship Forth; in case his
valuable services should be required, he may be again engaged by
Mr. Curr, having expressed his desire to return to us, but as it
is probable the locations will be definitively fixed and the
boundaries marked out, before Mr. Hellyer would leave us, or Mr.
Fossey arrive, there may be now no occasion for his services, and
thus a considerable saving may be made in the salaries of
officers in that department.</p>

Meeting, have been&mdash;</p>

<p>The men are chiefly engaged to replace those whose terms are
about to expire, and they are indented for the term of seven
years at much lower wages than have been paid to the persons whom
they succeed; so that the expense of sending out the families
will be soon remunerated to the Company; all these, except five,
are gone out in the Forth, Captain Robertson, and are to
disembark at Circular Head, having a large quantity of stores on
board for the establishment. The Directors availed themselves of
so good an opportunity, by sending an entire blood horse and two
blood mares, as well as two more young bulls of the Durham
breed.</p>
<p>The balance sheet up to the 30th June. 1830, received from Van
Diemen's Land, and the balance sheet of the books here, are laid
upon the table.</p>
<p>The abstract of accounts which accompanies the balance sheet
from Van Diemen's Land explains the manner in which the capital
has been invested. It appears from this abstract, after reckoning
the first cost, and adding thereto the proportionate expense
which properly belonged to each branch of stock arising from the
passage-money for people going out, and their wages, that our
stock of sheep, in June 1880, cost £30,717 2<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.;
and though this is a high rate for the number of the flocks, it
must be recollected that they are the basis upon which prosperity
rests, and from which the future stock, as they increase in
number, will acquire their value. The great expense of a flock in
Van Diemen's Land is the first cost and formation, particularly
when a great part is sent from Europe, and considering the number
of German and Nigretta sheep sent at heavy expense this amount is
not larger than might have been expected, or than could have been
avoided, as no pains have been spared to make all the purchase in
the most advantageous manner.</p>

<div>But in the latter it should be recollected that we have had
the misfortune to lose four entire horses on their voyage,
although every precaution was used for their preservation, the
cost of which and the expense of conveyance, have gone to the
debit of the horse account.</div>
<p>In this abstract, the charges which have been incurred by
exploring the country in order to make a judicious selection of
land, (a service which has occupied about six years, and is only
just finished, but which was of the first importance,) also the
charge in clearing and fencing the land, bringing it under
cultivation, the expense of building, &amp;c., are all attached
to the respective locations to which they belonged; and upon
comparing this abstract with the statistical accounts received
from Mr. Curr, the amount of each investment is clearly shewn:
the following details will make the Proprietors acquainted with
the value of their outlay.</p>
<p>Circular Head is at present, and will continue to be the chief
establishment; there is an excellent roadstead where, in
consequence of a round promontory of rock, shelter is given in
the Bays formed on each side, and ships can ride at anchor with
safety; the frontispiece will shew its peculiar form, and the
beauty of its situation, having a natural but most efficient
breakwater.</p>
<p>On the land adjoining to that promontory, Mr. Curr has fixed
his residence; his house appear? in the sketch, it is called

<p>"A very great extent of country has been burnt this summer,
and the stocks therefore are abundantly provided for. On no
former visit did the Surrey Hills present so attractive an
appearance; to the extent of many square miles, where the fire
had run, the country is clothed with the brightest verdure, not a
vestige remains of the dry and withered grasses which were so
unsightly and so extremely unpalatable to the stock. I have on
this occasion traversed the hills in every direction, and I am
happy to have it in my power to say, that I am more pleased with
them on every successive visit; the quality of the soil is almost
uniformly excellent,&mdash;superior, I am confident, to any tract
of equal extent in the Island. When the old grasses are burnt
off, the fresh grass is much relished by the stock of every kind,
and the more they are fed down, the closer and richer the grasses
and herbs become; the improvement from these causes is rapid and
manifest. I have been particularly pleased in this journey with
the country on the banks of the Wey, which I had never seen
before, it is superior to most parts which have yet been
occupied, and present for several miles a succession of the most
pleasing and varied scenery; the river rises on Talbot's Marsh,
runs a few miles towards the heath, and then, turning off to the
north-west, joins the Hellyer a little below Weybridge, receiving
in its course numberless small streams, many of which are sheep
fences, though none of them large enough, except in winter, to
restrain cattle; the largest of these streams, which is bordered
by a very good country, I named Sheppard, in honour of our
director of that name."</p>

<p class="quote">As per balance sheet and abstract taken to the
30th June, 1830.</p>
<p>Such were the investments at that period, the difference
between that amount and the debtor side of the London balance
sheet, shews the amount of drafts from Van Diemen's Land, as well
as the investments in the shipment by the Forth and passage of
the people; the Proprietors will from these, form their own
opinion as to the value of their investment. At a Special General
Meeting of the Proprietors, held on the 23rd August last, it was
resolved that the books in Van Diemen's Land, as well as here,
should, in future, be made up and balanced on the 31st December
of each year; the balance sheet which will be laid before the
next annual meeting, will be for the then preceding six months
only.</p>
<p>The Proprietors must be aware that more money will necessarily
be required, not to defray current annual expenses, but upon
those permanent investments, buildings, &amp;c. which are
required on all new and unoccupied estates, in order to make the
land valuable, as well for cultivation by the Company, as for
tenants, or for sale; the main expenses are already incurred; the
country is explored and roads constructed, but the locations must
be greatly increased in value and rendered available for every
purpose by the erection of farm-houses, barns, &amp;c., and by
inclosures, these will give good annual remuneration, and for
this purpose the Directors expect it will be necessary to make
another call, not exceeding £2 [per] share, to be paid as usual
by two instalments, of which due and sufficient notice will be
given; and from the best judgement they are now able to form,
they trust this will be the last call they will have to make.</p>
<p>Capital thus employed will be a beneficial increase in value
yearly, for land is becoming scarce, particularly on the north
side of the island, and each settler must come nearer to our
borders.</p>
<p>With respect to the payment, first of the current expense of
the establishment, and next interest and profit, the Directors
feel extremely anxious to give such full and minute information
as will enable the Proprietors to judge for themselves. Mr. Curr
is of opinion, that the current expenditure will be paid this
year, by the sale of produce and shipments to Europe: and judging
from the quantity of wool, &amp;c. which will be exported, and
the sales of live stock <i>in the Colony</i>, together with the
produce of the soil, it appears that this expectation will be
realized.</p>
<p>The following computation will shew the ground upon which this
estimate is formed. Mr. Curr states that the wool which will be
sent, and which he is now about to ship, would be not less than
120 bales, and will be in much better condition and quality than
any yet received, reckoned at £20
each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=</p>

<p>The expenditure was £8800 in the year 1830. When, therefore,
the rapid increase of live stock is considered, the Directors
can, with confidence, hold out the prospect of early dividends;
it must evidently be advisable to postpone the expectation of
them for one or two years; but they trust they may fairly
calculate upon being able to announce a dividend in 1834, of
which, however, the Proprietors, from the accounts on the table,
will be able to form their own opinion.</p>

<hr class="tenth">
<p class="negindent2"><span class="aa">Report</span> of Mr.
<span class="aa">Alexander Goldie</span> of his Journey from
George Town to Cape Grimm and the western coast, dated 28th of
November, 1826.</p>
<p>"<span class="uu">At</span> your request, I beg to state, that
I left Frogmore, accompanied by Mr. Fossey, in a whale boat, with
six men, and Frederick as steersman, on Saturday the 29th of
July. Owing to the State of the tide, I was unable to get farther
than the third river that night. On Sunday morning we breakfasted
at a small creek, a mile to the eastward of the Leven; and a
heavy swell setting in from the north-west, I was obliged to put
into Pariah's Boat Harbour, about six miles to the east of Table
Cape. Next morning (Monday the 31st) before eight o'clock, we
again got off, and with great difficulty got to the west aide of
Table Cape, where we were obliged to put up for a short time,
expecting the swell would abate a little. We made a second
attempt, but were glad to steer for the nearest harbour we
could.</p>
<p>"It began to blow very hard at night, and continued so all the
next day, which prevented us proceeding. On Wednesday the 2nd of
August, at day-break, we again got into the boat, and although
the sea was much abated, yet there was a heavy swell from the
north-west; and about two o'clock we reached Circular Head, where
I found the schooner Nelson at anchor. We had scarcely got under
the lee of the bluff, when it began to blow excessively, and
continued for the next two days, so that the schooner durst not
put to sea. During these two days, Mr. Fossey and I examined this
place, and found a considerable tract of good land, in many
places quite clear, and in others very thinly timbered.</p>
<p>"The timber is chiefly small gum, tea tree, and a little
blackwood, very small. It is, generally speaking, a good sheep
run, and the soil has rather a tendency to sand than day; so that
I scarcely expect brick-earth will be found here. The bluff is
composed of dark-grey granite, of excellent quality, and the
rocks around are generally of the same description.</p>
<p>"There is good anchorage on the south side of the Bluff for
small vessels; but Frederick could not say whether it would be
equally so for large ones. It is a good deal exposed to the east
and north-east winds. It is a very inaccurate way of judging of
the quantity of land to walk over it; but Mr. Fossey and myself
thought there would he 4000 acres of good clear land, and that a
considerable quantity more could be made clear at a very moderate
expense.</p>
<p>"Saturday the 5th, being a good day and quite calm, I took the
opportunity of sending the boat to the river at Robins' Passage,
which we have called Duck River; and as it was very heavily
laden, and deep in the water, Mr. Fossey and I, with one of the
boatmen, walked there. The distance is about sixteen miles. The
country, a few miles inland, is all either swamp or wet heathy
plains; and within a mile of the shore, light grey sand. We
encamped about three miles from the mouth of the river, and next
day (Sunday the 6th) I went up four miles farther, to look for
the best way to Cape Grimm. Having fixed on the course, which was
west by south, I returned to the tent. Early on Monday morning I
ordered Frederick to take the boat with four men to Cape Grimm;
and Mr. Fossey, two men, and myself, started for the same place
by land. I kept the course I have stated for about three miles,
across open heathy plains, a good deal covered with water, and
then entered a very swampy forest of stringy bark and gum trees.
We continued that course for some hours, but there being no spot
lot a person either to sit or lie down, I altered to west
north-west, expecting that would bring us to the plains; instead
of which, it only kept us along a ridge of hills, about six miles
inland, from which we could see nothing. I again changed to
north, and got out of the forest into the plains, as it wag dark.
All the ground around was very wet, and we had little fire; but
it was a fine night, and we all slept soundly after our day's
exertions.</p>
<p>"Tuesday the 8th, after breakfast, we started, and kept
north-west; and at mid-day made the coast-I varied our course
from one to three miles inland, and found nothing but extensive
wet heathy plains, with a considerable extent of tea-tree scrub
in many places. On Wednesday we passed over a similar country,
and crossed two considerable rivers; and on Thursday the 10th we
reached the tent, about two miles east of tho most northerly put
of the island. On that day we had very great difficulty in
crossing a river, and there being no trees near, we had no means
of making a bridge. During the whole journey from Circular Head,
to within three miles of where the boat lay, I did not see any
land at all calculated for the Company's use; being all either
thick forest, or low heathy, swampy plains, composed of hungry
grey sand; I am not certain that sheep would eat the heath in the
plains; but it would be quite impossible to have stock of any
kind on them in the winter.</p>
<p>"Friday the 11th and the three following days, I examined the
land within a day's walk of the tent, in the neighbourhood of
Cape Grimm, and found it to be all good sheep land, with the
exception of a low plain, of considerable extent, which would
make a good ran for cattle. The land has generally a tendency to
sand; but, at one part, about seven miles down the west coast,
there is strong clay, which I think would make bricks. I did not
see any free-stone; but there is sand-stone close by Cape Grimm.
The timber is chiefly bad curly gum, honeysuckle, tea-tree, and a
little blackwood. It is very hilly and dry, and thickly covered
with kangaroo grass.</p>
<p>"There is a small island, about two miles from the main,
called Trefoil Island, which is very beautiful; with little
timber, and apparently covered with grass I made an attempt to
get to it, but could not, the weather was so stormy.</p>
<p>"Having seen all the land round Cape Grimm, I returned in the
boat to the river I have already mentioned (which we had so much
difficulty in crossing) on Tuesday the 15th: and the following
day started, with Mr. Fossey, Frederick, and one boatman, for a
very remarkable hill on the west coast, near West Point, and on
Hardwike's map called Mount Cameron. In crossing over the country
to the west coast, we saw a great deal of good land quite adapted
for sheep; but before reaching Mount Cameron, it becomes very
narrow, not exceeding a mile in width; and in the immediate
neighbourhood of the hill it is all heath and swamp. The hill
itself is of excellent quality, with very good feed upon it, and
may consist of 800 or 1000 acres in all. The view from the top is
very extensive, but unpromising, being surrounded by heathy
plains, and they are bounded by low swampy forests, of amazing
extent, both in the east and the south. Thursday the 17th we
returned to the tent in an easterly direction, till we came to
the river, where the boat lay about twelve miles higher up; and
seeing the country all around was grey sand covered with heath
and tea-tree, I determined to reach the tent by the shortest road
I could find, it having poured with rain nearly the whole day.
Mr. Fossey attempted to cross first, and was soon taken off his
feet, when he was obliged to swim, and luckily got safe over. I
kept lower down with the men, and by cutting trees, &amp;c. we
made a bridge on which we crossed. On reaching the other side,
Mr. Fossey was not to be found, and did net make his appearance
till next morning, having lost himself in the extensive
plains.</p>
<p>"I next began to make preparations for starting for the
Pieman's river; but owing to the unfavourable state of the
weather, I did not get off till Sunday the 20th.</p>
<p>"Mr. Fossey, Frederick, two boatmen and myself, were to
compose the expedition, each to carry ten days' provisions; and
in order to guard against our running short, I took two more of
the boatmen to carry provisions for two or three l60 days, and
then to return to take the boat to Circular Head, there to await
our arrival. The first daj we got to Mount Cameron. It rained
excessively; and from the quantity that had fallen the two
preceding, days, I found the plains much deeper in water, and in
some places difficult to get through.</p>
<p>"Monday the 21st. On leaving Mount Cameron, there is a
honeysuckle bank runs along the west point, covered with kangaroo
grass. At this place there is a pretty extensive range of hills
of the same quality as Mount Cameron, with very little scrub,
chiefly fern and indigo. After we had crossed the hills we came
upon wet heathy plains, mixed with tough tea-tree; and at this
season fully knee deep with water-We encamped about four miles
from the shore, and could see the same kind of good feed run all
along the coast, varying in width in different places.</p>
<p>"Tuesday the 22nd. We continued oar route, and, after walking
some hours, saw some rising ground to the south and west; and
thinking it might be Hardwicke's South Downs, we made for them;
but it turned out to be of the same description as that we had
already seen along the coast, only a little wider. In a very few
minutes we came to a river, which I thought was Pieman's, from
the description I had got of it. It is as wide as the Mersey at
the mouth; apparently much deeper, and a bar river. There was a
heavy sea breaking over it. We attempted to cross, but found it
was impossible. I therefore determined to keep up along its
banks, a good way; but seeing there was no chance of ever being
able to get across, I struck inland south by east. On the
opposite side of this river, I could see that the good land
became much wider, and also that Mount Norfolk was covered with
heath, and clear of wood: our distance from it might be fourteen
or sixteen miles. We continued along these wet heathy plains till
near dark. I then encamped on the edge of a forest.</p>
<p>"Wednesday the 23rd. The two boatmen returned, and we
continued our course south by east, in order to ascend a heathy
ridge; on reaching the top, I could see the plains extended for a
considerable distance, north-east and south-west; and were
bounded by low forests. We entered the forest in a south-east
course, expecting to make what we thought was a high ridge, but
which turned out to be only high trees along the side of a low
tea-tree plain. We had the greatest difficulty in getting through
the forest, owing to the fallen timber, scrub, and soft mud, in
which we sunk nearly knee deep. We continued in this way, it
pouring with rain the whole time, till about four o'clock, when
Frederick ascended a tree, and said there were plains before us.
This intelligence roused us a little, and ire made another
exertion; but instead of finding open plains, they were covered
with water, and tea-tree ten feet high; and so strong and thick,
that it was next to impossible to get through. After all were
exhausted with fatigue, we came to a small spot a little higher
than the rest, which we cleared of brush, and pitched our tent on
it. The ground was so wet we durst not lie down; and, to add to
our comfort, we had only two or three logs to make a fire. At
night it cleared up to a very keen frost, which we all felt
excessively.</p>
<p>"Next morning, the 24th, seeing the country all around was low
and swampy, and not knowing how far it might extend, I determined
to retrace our steps; considering it more than any person was
able to endure at that season of the year. It took us four hours
to get out of the forest, although we came back in our old
course; and I am sure we were not more than four miles from the
plains. On getting out, I looked all around to see if there was
any better place by which we could cross the country; but it all
looked equally low and swampy. I therefore made for the hut we
had left the day before,</p>
<p>"Friday the 25th. Finding it was impossible to cross the
country at this season as far inland as I could wish, (although I
think it is practicable at another time of the year,) I returned
to Mount Cameron, and from that by the nearest way I could find
to Circular Head, which I reached on Tuesday night the 29th.
During all that fatiguing walk, I did not see any land at all
suitable for the Company, except what I have already mentioned,
around Cape Grimm, and the narrow strip that runs along the west
coast. It rained and blew so hard from the north-east, that the
boat did not come to us till Saturday the 2nd of September.
During that time, Mr. Fossey and I again examined this place, and
the two greatest disadvantages attending it are the small portion
of good land, and being so far separated from any more of a
similar quality; and the other is the want of water. There is no
running stream; but I think water can be found by digging. At
Cape Grimm there is certainly a much greater extent of good land;
and there is a very small creek, which I understand is never dry;
but there is no anchorage for vessels of any size, nearer than
under the Hunter's Island, which is four miles off I and that I
am afraid is not so good as at Circular Head.</p>
<p>"Monday the 4th, being the first calm day after the arrival of
the boat, I left for Rocky Cape, with the intention of proceeding
inland from that place. The three following days it rained very
much, which prevented our starting till Friday the 8th. Our
course was south by west, by an observation taken from one of the
neighbouring mountains to another clear hill, about twelve miles
inland. Mr. Fossey, Frederick, two boatmen and myself, took seven
days' provisions, and made for a river about four miles to the
west of Rocky Cape. We kept up along its banks four miles
farther, and then crossed it on a tree, and entered the forest
about south-west, varying according to circumstances. The scrub
and fallen timber were very difficult to get through, and it was
impossible for us to get on more than one mile an hour.</p>
<p>"It had poured with rain for two hours; and as it was getting
dark, I determined to encamp by the side of a small river that
empties itself into the one we had crossed, and which ran at the
bottom of the hill we wished to reach. The ground, although so
wet we could not lie down, was clear of brush, and the hill on
the opposite side was very scrubby. We had the greatest
difficulty in procuring fire; and after we had succeeded, and
finished supper, the rain increased so much that the river rose
and extinguished it in a very few minutes. We were then obliged
to move away to a little eminence about thirty yards off; but
before we could reach It we had to wade to our middles in water.
There we sat the whole night, by the side of a stringy bark tree
with our blankets over our heads. It never ceased raining for one
minute during the whole night, and the river kept rising so much,
we were under considerable apprehensions of being swept away. At
the first appearance of light the next morning, we were all on
our legs, but were unable to move for some minutes from the
excessive wet and cold.</p>
<p>"The river which was not above eight or ten yards widi the
night before, was now swollen to about the eighth of a mile, and
running so rapidly it was impossible to cross it. It had also
burst out where we were; and the small spot on which we stood had
become an island; so, in order to return to the forest through
which we had passed the preceding night, we had to wade to our
arm-pits, and it was with the utmost difficulty we could stem the
current. On reaching the main river, it was about a quarter of a
mile in width, so that it was useless to attempt to cross it. We
therefore encamped on a small eminence at some distance until it
should subside, to allow us to return to the boat. Our dour and
sugar were very much spoiled with the wet, the kangaroo knapsacks
being quite wet through. We erected a bark hut, and soon made
ourselves very comfortable, happy in having escaped with out
lives.</p>
<p>"Next day, Sunday the 10th, we saw that the river had fallen
considerably, and we luckily succeeded in getting across.</p>
<p>"We had scarcely got bock to the tent when it began to blow
and rain excessively, and continued so till Thursday the 14th,
when we started for the Mersey. We reached the Leven that night,
and next morning got to the Mersey to breakfast, where we found
Mr. Adey.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><span class="aa">Report</span> of Mr.
<span class="aa">Henry Hellyer</span>, dated Circular Head,<br>
13th March, 1827.</p>
<p>"<span class="aa">On</span> the 6th, I ascended the Dip, and
saw from it a plain about fifteen miles south of Table Cape, and
a large tract of open grassy country south-east by east, lying
beyond the north side of the Peak, which I considered wan the
most desirable route for me to take, and to endeavour to ascend
the Peak; the country to the south being all high forest, tier
above tier, and to the west one mass of low forest, so flat that
I could see Mount Cameron and Cape Grimm, forty miles off,
neither of which are very lofty. After taking minute observations
of every feature of the surrounding country, I descended and took
the horses down through a steep forest, into an extensive green
flat, which I call Dipwood Marsh; and knowing it was all forest
beyond, for many miles in every direction, and finding here
abundance of fresh young grass and herbage, although very coarse,
with grass trees and fern, I left the horses and the two
prisoners, who ware already knocked up, and started for the open
country beyond the Peak, with two intelligent active men used to
the hush, each of US carrying a gun, and a knapsack containing a
large blanket and a fortnight's provision. My strength, I feared,
was scarcely equal to it; but I was determined to go as far as
possible.</p>
<p>"The country as far as Dipwood Marsh, from Circular Head, is
every where sandy, and of no utility whatever for the purpose of
the Company. It consists of barren, rocky, and heathy hills, with
useless stunted trees, heathy swampy plains, and rocky forests. I
observed there is a sharp white sand freestone to be had from
about the Dip; but its carriage would render it almost
unavailable: it would, I think, make excellent grindstones, and
rubbers for scythes, &amp;c. Dipwood Marsh extends from four to
five miles in length, and is about half a mile wide; the soil,
grey sand mixed with lumps of bulky quartz. It appears to be a
place much frequented by the natives, and has been burnt a few
months back. We found several kangaroos upon it when we came
down.</p>
<p>"I left Dipwood Marsh on the 7th, and had a most fatiguing
march for several days, through a thick dark forest, a succession
of woody mountains; and although the men climbed trees, upon
every top where it was likely to obtain an observation, we found
such a mass of foliage every where, that no distant object could
be seen until the evening of the 11th; when we were so fortunate
as to see the Peak, which then appeared to be a good three days'
march from us. I began now to consider we had travelled five days
out of our fourteen, and as I could not go near the Peak, if I
went on for the open plains, I determined to insure, at all
events, my ascending the Peak.</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 12th, having altered my course from
south-east by east to south-east by south-half-south, I found the
travelling much the same all that day; but on the 13th, we saw an
emu track down the side of a hill, which assured us we were
getting into a better country; and about noon, we suddenly came
upon grassy hills, the extent of which we had then no idea of.
The change was quite reviving: the Peak was some miles before us;
we went over these hills, and passed through a considerable tract
of myrtle forest, similar to our last six days' travelling, and
came to the widest and deepest river we had seen since leaving
Circular Head. We crossed over on a fallen tree bridge, twenty
feet above the water. Its course here is from south-west, and
going east-north-east. I have since named it Emu River. I
expected this river skirted the Peak; and we afterwards found
seven distinct tiers of hilly forest, before we arrived at the
base of the principal eminence.</p>
<p>"On the night of the 13th, we rested on the fourth hill of
ascent.</p>
<p>"On the 14th, the day was very unfavourable, being wet and
gloomy; but we could not wait for the weather, and about two
o'clock we had reached the top of the north pyramid of rock; the
highest part being yet far above us, and in the clouds. Seeing
the weather thicker to windward, and fearing the scene around me
would soon be eclipsed, I hastened to take a sketch of it; but
the clouds descended, and it poured with rain, so that we could
not see each other. There was each a thick mist, and it rushed
past us so furiously, we were obliged to take shelter in a nook
of the rocks, and wrap ourselves up in blankets, it was so
perishing cold. I wanted to wait to see if it would blow over. We
waited till five o'clock, and finding there was no chance of its
clearing, we descended; and I determined on going up again the
next day. I had just sufficient time to look round me, and see
there was a fine open country to the north-east and south-west.
We found it very difficult to get down, being obliged to hold on
to jutting perpendicular rocks, and the small twigs which grew
between them; and finding water just before dark, we stood
against some trees, before a large fire. The rain continued a
great part of the night.</p>
<p>"The country from Dipwood Marsh to the Peak, is not by any
means barren. After the first three miles from the Marsh it
chaises from a hungry, sandy soil, to a deep rich loam; and there
is not a stone to be seen, except at the bottom of brooks, which
are mostly in deep ravines and gullies, which intersect and drain
the forest in all directions. The surface soil is actually rank
with constantly decaying vegetable matter; its scent is quite
disagreeable, and the air in these dense forests is putrid and
oppressive, and swarms with musquitoes and large stinging flies,
the size of English bees. Daylight is completely shut out by
masses of foliage impervious to the rays of the sun. Myrtle is
the principal timber throughout this district: its appearance, as
to a rough bark and thick foliage, very much resembles the elm;
but there are no elms equal to those gigantic trees, being in
general from one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet in height,
and from thirty to forty feet in circumference. The wood is very
like cedar. Sassafras is found here in great abundance and of
fine growth; and on many of the higher tiers, are celery-topped
pine and blackwattle of considerable size. Fern trees, twenty
feet in height, laurel-fern, and feather-fern are every where to
be found, except in the thickest scrubs. The rivers and brooks
are so numerous, we were scarcely half an hour, during any day,
without crossing one or the other. Dead logs and branches impeded
us at every step; and we were continually meeting with large
tracts of dense thicket, from thirty to forty feet high, so
closely interwoven and matted together, as to be impenetrable
below: and we were often obliged to be walking upon these
never-dry, slippery branches, covered with moss, as much as
twenty feet above the ground, which, being in many instances
rotten, occasioned us many awkward falls, and tore our clothes to
rags-We were not able to force our way on five hundred yards in
an hour, in some of these horrid scrubs. I was glad I did not
attempt to bring the horses on any further. The grassy tract of
country which we had crossed, north of the Emu river, appears to
extend many miles to the south-west, and unites with the large
open country to the north-east. It is covered with luxuriant
grass, and there are a few large, stringy bark trees on the top
of the ridge, which runs down the centre of it.</p>
<p>"The hilly forest, from the Emu river to the base of the Peak,
is of the same description as all the other myrtle forests we
have traversed; except that the soil here is rather rocky, and
there are some stringy barks on these hills.</p>
<p>"The Peak is composed of pudding stone, (like several other of
the principal mountains which I have examined,) and is in shape,
when viewed on the east or west side, like a three masted ship in
full sail; and, when observed from the north or south, it is as
sharp as any peak can well be imagined, the sides being nearly
perpendicular. Its base extends six miles in length and about
three miles in width. There is a companion hill on the north-west
side, which is of considerable size and very lofty, but woody to
the top.</p>
<p>"The morning of the 15th was fortunately very clear and
serene: there was not a cloud to be seen. We again toiled up the
mountain with our loads, not knowing which way it would be most
desirable to go on. After getting to the top, we were several
hours struggling through thick scrub and wireweed, and climbing
over immense masses of rock: the scrub was dripping wet, from the
heavy rain which had fallen in the night. We at length arrived
upon the very highest point, 3000 feet above the level of the
sea! I found the stump of a withered box tree and cut upon it
'St. Valentine's Peak,' the date of my ascent, &amp;c., which I
drove into the cleft of the rocks at the top, with its roots in
the air. The men rolled off some huge blocks of rock, which in
their fall appeared to smoke, from the splinters which flew off,
as they struck and rebounded from one massive projection down to
another. I had now to consider which way I should proceed on my
return, to see as much as possible of the good country I had
discovered from the Peak; and as that portion lying to the
north-east might be more easily examined from the coast, I
descended at the south end, after collecting specimens of the
rock, in doing which I broke off several lumps sparkling with
crystals, and brought them sway, although I had a long distance
to carry them in my knapsack. We alighted in the evening upon an
open spot, which had caught my observation from the top. I found
it consisted of grassy hills and knolls, and resembled a
neglected old park; a thousand to fifteen hundred acres in a
patch, without a tree, except a few clumps of blackwood. Dead
trees lay totting where they had Mien; grass run to seed, the
tops of which appeared at this season nearly white, made it very
conspicuous when viewed from a distance. Here we saw kangaroos in
abundance, and tracks of them in all directions. A brook runs
across this district from the Peak, in a south-east direction,
which I think is very likely to be the source of the Leven river.
The banks of the brook are green with trefoil. We found here as
good mushrooms as any I have tasted in England. As I had only
time to make one straight line through part of the open country,
and endeavour to find my way through the mountains of forest
which divided me from the horses, I determined, from what I had
observed above, to go from this west-south-west, and see a fine
large open tract, about ten miles off. We went on in an excellent
country, consisting of gently rising, dry, grassy hills, divided
from each other by brooks, the sides of which are adorned with
blackwood fad other elegant trees and shrubs; and on the hills
are a few tall peppermint and stringy barks. About sunset, having
routed some emus, we fired at them without impeding their
progress; and having shot two kangaroos, we halted for the night.
As soon as we had made a fire, the flames caught the grass, and
it spread to a great extent, quite illuminating the atmosphere,
until rain came on and by degrees extinguished it.</p>
<p>"On the 16th we proceeded west-south-west, and after walking
about half a mile, crossed the Emu river, here running
north-north-west: saw several wattle birds: went over many
considerable hills burnt by the natives: found a lot of native
huts, and saw several trees from which bark had been taken to
cover them; soon after which we came down to a noble river, with
a strong current gliding smoothly along from south to north. I
called it the Don by way of distinction. It is fifty yards wide
and took us to our middle in the shallowest place we could find.
On its banks are complete sloping shrubberies. This river appears
to rise from eight to ten feet in time of flood. At some short
distance from the Don, we ascended the most magnificent grass
hill I have seen in this country, consisting of several level
terraces, as if laid out by art, and crowned with a straight row
of stately peppermint trees; beyond which there is not a tree for
four miles along the grassy hills. I had now arrived at the grand
opening seen from the Peak, beyond the Brown Forest: here the
natives had been burning large tracts of grass. The morning being
cloudy and wet, I was just able to discern through the mist, that
the Peak bore from hence east-north-east: the top was in the
clouds. I congratulated myself upon having had so fine a day
yesterday, or I should have had a very imperfect idea of the
extent of good country here. The plains, or rather hills, from
the south foot of the Peak, I call, from their great extent and
importance, the Surrey Hills; which name I here cut upon a large
conspicuous tree, the country being about the same distance
inland as that county in England. They resemble English
enclosures in many respects, being bounded by brooks between
each, with belts of beautiful shrubs in every vale including blue
leaf tea-tree, box, sassafras, black wood, wood-pear, birch,
sloe-leaf, mask-holly, celery-top pine, and myrtle. The whole
country here is grassy. The grasses in the line of our walk are
principally timothy, foxtail, and single kangaroo. The surface
soil is dark vegetable mould upon a rich brown, open loam, of
various depths, and lighter in colour according to its depth: but
on the tops of the hills there are rocks above the surface in
several instances; and from what I could observe, where trees had
fallen torn up by the roots, the substratum is every where
gravelly, which appears to render these hills perfectly dry. All
the brooks have hard pebbly bottoms, free from mud, and the water
is dear as crystal. The timber found on these hills is, in
general, of fine growth, very tall and straight; some of it would
measure more than 100 feet to the lowest branch. The trees are in
many places 100 yards apart. They are principally peppermint and
stringy bark; which, having lately made their summer shoots, the
whole country where they are appeared from the Peak of a lively
brownish hue, by which I was enabled to distinguish the large
tract of country which I have marked Brown Forest on the map; and
from what I have seen of the Brown Forest thus far, I do not
think it at all too thickly timbered to afford a little shade
from the summer heat. It will not, in general, average ten trees
an acre. There are many open plains of several square miles,
without a single tree. The kangaroos stood gazing at us like
fawns, and in some instances came bounding towards us; and if we
shouted they ran like a flock of sheep; we never saw so many
together. The plains or hills to the north of the Peak, being
nearer to the coast, I call the Hampshire Hills. They appear even
more park-like than the Surrey Hills, and are handsomely clumped
with trees. We continued travelling in the Brown Forest until the
morning of the 18th: we found it the same kind of grassy country
which I have before described, all the way from the Peak. Our
course in the Brown Forest has been nearly twenty miles; and as
for as we were enabled to view it on both sides, as we came
along, there arose grassy hills out of number, which it was
delightful to look round upon, from one higher than the rest that
commanded such a prospect, which continually occurred in the
course of our walk.</p>
<p>"We now approached the high forest tier of woody mountains,
near which we came upon a marshy country, and saw several snipes.
We found here two native huts, and marks of many fire-places in
the neighbourhood, as if the spot had been lately occupied by a
large body of natives. In one of the huts I saw a drawing of the
moon, done with charcoal, upon the inside of one of the slabs of
bark which formed the hut; and regarding it as an evidence of
there being artists among them, I cut out the piece, and placed
it carefully between two other pieces of bark in my knapsack. I
sketched two figures of the moon with charcoal on the bark of the
hut, and put the date of my visit. I was now travelling
north-west by north, towards the Dip Mountain, until I might be
able to get an observation to correct my course; and having
ascended the high forest tier, we hoped to obtain a bearing that
would guide us in finding the nearest way to the horses; but
there was no chance of it. Nothing could be seen but tops of
trees upon the next high tier. We descended; and on the 19th came
down through a very thick forest, to the bend of a large deep and
rapid river, larger than the Don; and at this place more than ten
feet deep close to the bank. It was here coming from
south-south-east, and going west by south; we did not therefore
suppose that we should see any more of it. We pursued our way
along a considerable tract of low, flat forest, which had every
appearance of bong inundated in the rainy season; beyond which we
again found this large river, running north-east. We were obliged
now to wade through it, at the best fording place we could find,
and it was in some places so deep and dangerous, we could
scarcely withstand the current; but, by holding on to poles, we
all got safe through it; and having wrung our clothes, we went on
over several steep hills of forest and scrub; and about sunset
had arrived on the top of a very high forest tier. The men
climbed the trees as usual, and could see nothing but tops of
trees upon the next high tier, which was a great disappointment
to me.</p>
<p>"On the 20th we came down from high mountains of dark forest,
and went over many very steep hills, without at all varying the
dismal scene; but suddenly it changed for a few minutes, we
having come down upon an excellent level spot of high fern and
stringy bark; a capital soil for the plough and easily cleared.
Its extent might be one hundred acres. It appeared to be a long
flat terrace, off the side of the mountain. Here we again heard
the great river just below, and found it running west. We had no
alternative but to find our way over; and it here appeared so
much larger, we all thought it had united with the Don since our
first crossing it. We were, however, lucky in finding here a much
better ford, with an island of gravel to rest upon; and the
current being wider, was not so powerful as at our former
crossing place. This spot would serve for a ford and depôt, if
ever a road should be made in this direction; which I think is
most improbable, from the lofty mountains surrounding it. I have
taken the liberty of styling this large river the Arthur, in
compliment to his Excellency the present Lieutenant-Governor of
Van Diemen's Land, it being one of the principal rivers in the
island. After travelling north-north-west over several high
mountains of forest, we at last obtained a view of the east end
of the Blue Peak Range, by which we knew we were many days'
journey from the horses, and too much to the west. We now changed
our coarse to north-north-east. We had no provisions left except
flour, which mixed with water only, (we having boiled our sugar
bag,) is poor living to take such violent bodily exercise
upon.</p>
<p>"On the 21st, about noon, we came down upon the Arthur again,
running east; but seeing it turned to the north, we went round
the bend, and from it ascended its very high and steep bank, in a
north-north-east direction, and came up to the foot of a long
line of perpendicular cliffs of slate, from 200 to 300 feet high,
which upon examination proved to be slate of the best quality,
splitting in parallel thicknesses to the size of ladies,
countesses, or duchesses, and lying in regular horizontal strata
from end to end. I brought away specimens, and engraved upon a
large slab standing under the cliff, 'Whoever is found stealing
slate from this quarry, will be dealt with according to law,'
with the date below it. If the Arthur should be found navigable
for barges, from hence to the coast, this discovery so near the
river, might be valuable. These cliffs appear to extend for
miles, and would supply all the world in slates. We continued
travelling in the dreary forest, over high mountains of slate,
with an abundance of capital whetstone in every deep ravine, a
great pan of the 22d; and were obliged to make our way on for
many miles, along the top of a highly dangerous, serpentine,
strong, and rocky ridge, so narrow at the top, that a single
large tree would often occupy the whole width of it; and we were
obliged to creep along its almost perpendicular sides to get past
such a tree. It resembled the top of a wall of a large castle;
and on either side below us, was a rocky ravine many hundred
yards deep. After getting over several high hills of forest, we
came down to a large river, which we knew could be no other than
the Son; and now discovered that it had not joined the Arthur, as
we before had reason to suppose. It here ran west in a deep
valley of rugged rocks, among mountains of rocky forest. Having
with difficulty waded through it, about 300 yards above a noble
cascade, where the whole body of water fell twenty feet
perpendicular with an astounding noise, we went up one of the
loftiest forest tiers we had yet encountered, which we found to
be perfectly level at the top and thickly grown with an almost
impenetrable espalier-grown scrub, that a dog could not get
through below. We persevered in getting over it till dark. It had
poured with rain nearly the whole day; the water streamed from
our fingers' ends: we were obliged to go on, or starve. This
compulsory moving on, past our strength, and the anxiety we all
felt as to our ever being able to get back to tell of what we had
seen, rendered our situation at this moment by no means enviable.
The men began to consider it hopeless, and said they should never
be heard of any more, like the seven soldiers that went from
Macquarrie Harbour, after bushrangers; but if we had only
strength left to crawl on at all, I told them I was sure we
should get out. We could not be far wrong in our course, and at
all events could make the sea-coast, even if we should continue
to be so buried in dark forest, as not to be able to get another
observation.</p>
<p>"On the 23d, we toiled as usual over tremendous mountains of
forest; and had some thoughts of throwing away every thing we
carried, being all nearly exhausted with fatigue and want of
food.</p>
<p>"On the 24th, we came to the brink of a frightful precipice,
and saw a river below, running north-east. We went along it some
distance, and found a place to descend, where We crossed the
river, and knew it must be the same we had crossed going to the
Peak, which runs into the sea at Table Cape. From a tree on a
hill further on, we saw the sea and Table Cape. We immediately
altered our course to north-west; and on the 25th, after
surmounting several steep and lofty ridges of forest, we caught
sight of the Dip, only five miles from us, hearing
west-south-west. We became a new set of men in a moment. We
struggled hard to get out of the forest, as quick as possible,
knowing now exactly the ground we had to go upon. We soon arrived
upon the heathy hills surrounding Dipwood Marsh; and, when within
a mile of the spot where we had left the men and horses, we fired
a signal, and as we walked briskly on, we had the satisfaction of
hearing a report in answer to it, which I was rejoiced at, as we
could not tell whether the men had not been murdered by the
natives during our nineteen days' absence. As we descended the
last hill, we were grieved to see two of the horses lying dead.
The men came to meet us. They were glad to see us come back,
having given up all hopes of it; and were going to leave the
place the next day, and endeavour to find their way back to
Circular Head. They said the horses had fallen off every day
since they were brought here; one of them died six days after I
left; the other died the day before I returned; the third horse
was nearly dead. I found the poor animal very weak, and scarcely
able to eat a piece of bread. I had some warm gruel made, and
poured down his throat, and blankets wrapped round him: the other
two appeared to have died from indigestion.</p>
<p>"On the following day I had the pack saddles, and several
other articles we could not carry, planted, to be sent for at
some future opportunity. We were all much in need of a day's
rest. The two men. Wells and Higginson, had taken great care of
every thing, and deserve encouragement. They did not know what to
do for the horses. I had left the two kangaroo dogs with them,
thinking they would be starved in the forest, or I should be
obliged to give them part of our provisions, which would prevent
our going as far as we otherwise might. The dogs had caught them
three kangaroos, and two badgers or woombacks. They had not
heard, or seen any thing of the natives. I had now an opportunity
of putting on clean linen, which I had not been able to do for
three weeks, (during such profuse perspiration,) or to have any
of my clothes off, except to wring the wet out-I was anxious to
get the remaining horse within reach of better food; and on the
27th we quitted Dipwood Marsh for Circular Head.</p>
<p>"The country through which we have been travelling the last
seven days, from the Surrey Hills to Dipwood Marsh, was much more
difficult to get through than that by which we went to the Peak;
the mountains being considerably higher, the ravines much deeper,
with bold rocky sides, and giddy precipices, requiring the utmost
caution not to descend too iar, to be unable to re-ascend, which
we were often obliged to do, and toil again to find a more
practicable declivity along the mountain side, after getting a
considerable distance down, which was very harassing, and seemed
often to render our return hopeless. To add to our difficulties,
we had no provisions left for the last four days, except a little
flour, of which we could only allow ourselves about a pint a day,
stirred in hot water; and we had only enough left for one more
meal when we returned to the horses. We were determined, however,
to persevere to the utmost to extricate ourselves: the weather
too had become very unfavourable since leaving the Peak. The
timber in this district I found to be principally myrtle,
sassafras, and stinkwood; and on ft mountain, west of the Arthur,
I saw several pepper trees, and procured the berries, bark, and
root, which are all very biting to the tongue. Large tracts of
closely matted scrub, with cutting grass, very much impeded our
progress. Fern trees and fern occupy the more open spaces, under
the dark spreading branches of the large forest trees. A great
number of fine stringy barks are here to be met with, where the
soil is dry; but the principal part of this extensive country is
as completely overshadowed with enormous myrtles as that through
which I went to the Peak. A great proportion of the soil here is
mixed with slate and rock; but there are many cultivatable tracts
of great extent, with a rich loam of considerable depth: creeks
and cascades arc to be found in every gully, up to the very
summits of the mountains.</p>
<p>"When we had arrived, with the only remaining horse, upon a
heathy hill on the west side of the Dip, the day being fine and
the heath dry, we set it on fire, and it raged so furiously we
were obliged to hurry out of its way, and were in danger of
getting burnt and losing the horse, from his having fallen down
and being unable to go on; and it required the strength of us all
to remove him out of its way. I expected by making a fire here,
the smoke might be seen from Circular Head, and it would be known
that the party who had gone in that direction were returning, as
the month for which I was provisioned was now expired. We
retraced our former steps to the mouth of the Detention river in
four days, and made a signal of three large fires on the shore,
as agreed, for a boat. The next morning, March the 3d, seeing no
boat coming, we proceeded round the shore; and in going along, my
attention was attracted by some curious appearances of metal
among the rocks, where I broke off some grains resembling copper,
under a kind of old metal sheathing, which covered great part of
the surface of the rocks; and in stagnant water near, I picked up
shells dyed blueish, and observed a greasy scum upon the surface
of the water. I am of opinion there must be a large proportion of
copper in it, and send the best specimens I could procure. These
rocks extend about two miles along the shore, and considerably
inland near Crayfish River.</p>
<p>"The following day, March the 4th, we arrived with the horse
near to Circular Head, to which place I went forward, and
reported to Mr. Adey the propitious result of the journey, and
the loss of the two horses.</p>
<p>"We saw no natives, but several huts, and marks of them. We
picked up green boughs by the embers of their fires, that had not
been gathered two days; we supposed they were not far off, and
might have used the boughs for musquito fans. We saw several
trees with steps cut in the bark; and, at twenty miles from the
sea, picked up the shells and claws of very large lobsters and
crayfish, which they had roasted. When the heath was set on fire,
I caught one of those curious insects the native straw; it is, I
apprehend, a nondescript. The only Creatures inhabiting these
large forests, appeared to be opossums and bandicoot rats, and, I
suppose, tigers, or native dogs, as they are called; as we often
heard the cracking of sticks by some heavy creature after dark,
as we lay, like mummies, rolled up in blankets to keep off the
musquitoes, by our fire side, upon our bed of fern leaves. This,
and the owl's doleful cry of 'more pork', and the screaming of
the opossums, were the only disturbances we experienced during
the night. Parrots, far above our reach, were chattering all day;
and when they made an unusually loud noise, it was occasioned by
the eagle-hawk pouncing upon them for his prey. We also
occasionally heard the trumpeter, or black magpie, and black
cockatoos in large mobs; but they kept so much aloft, we only
were able to shoot one of them, and one parrot, during the whole
journey; and one of the men shot a 'more pork'.</p>
<p>"I cannot conclude the few particulars I have been enabled to
give of my late walk in the bush, without acknowledging how much
I am indebted to the unwearied exertions of Richard Frederick and
Isaac Cutts, the two freemen you had appointed to attend me. But
for their assistance it would have been, from the nature of the
country, quite impossible that I could have penetrated so far, as
to see that part which is so desirable as a sheep country; the
extent of which I have endeavoured to convey an idea of in my
map, by giving it a yellow wash. I beg, therefore, to recommend
them most particularly to your future consideration, as well as
the privations they have endured, and the losses they have
sustained in their clothes and several articles belonging to
themselves. I cannot omit to state the great care taken by
Frederick to save the remaining horse, as I should have been
obliged to leave the animal to his fate, but for Frederick's
constant attention and perseverance, in conducting him from
Dipwood Marsh to Circular Head.</p>
<p>"Had I not taken the pack-hones, and conveyed provisions far
as I did, so as to enable us to start from thence, we could not
have carried sufficient to have reached that country than this
part of the coast. I therefore consider that our being enabled to
see so much of the interior, during my last journey, was greatly
owing to those poor animals whose lives have been lost in the
service.</p>

<p align="center"><span class="aa">Report</span> of <span class=
"aa">Mr. Joseph Fossey</span>, dated Circular Head,<br>
26th May, 1827.</p>
<p>"<span class="aa">Conformably</span> to your instructions of
the 3d of April last, I have to acquaint you that I proceeded
from Launceston on the 6th, for the purpose of making a tour
overland, by way of the western marshes, to the coast near Table
Cape.</p>
<p>"I left the cart at the Mersey, near Rolland Mountain, on
Monday the 23rd of April, having been confined there by
indisposition from Wednesday the 18th.</p>
<p>"The whole country, in the line of my route from Moleside to
Hounslow Heath, is (with the exception of three small marshes and
the Emu Plains, as laid down in the accompanying sketch,)
entirely forest, comprising almost every kind of timber usually
found in the colony, and principally of a mountainous
description. Hence it may be inferred, that a road for carriages
in this direction will, from the character of the country, be
very circuitous, and consume much time in finding out; yet I do
not entertain the most distant doubt of its being ultimately
discovered.</p>
<p>"The Mersey and the Forth have both sound beds, and more
fordable; and the small marshes just mentioned, being situated at
easy distances, will, together with the Emu Plains, which are of
considerable extent, form convenient resting places by the way,
affording both good feed and water.</p>
<p>"From the Emu Plains to the Heath the difficulties will be
very great, but when once overcome, all trouble will
comparatively cease.</p>
<p>"The Heath is apparently unbounded, and will be a great
acquisition to the Surrey Hills as a summer sheep run. In winter
it is covered with snow, and thereby rendered unavailable for any
useful purpose.</p>
<p>"The Vale of Belvoir next presents itself, bounded on the
north by an arm of the Black Bluff, on the south by gently rising
mounds, with some extent of clear land, running in a direction
towards Rollands. It has a large lake at the east end, with a
fine rivulet meandering through the centre, and an indescribably
beautiful waterfall on its south side, near the west end,
completes the picture. It is from two to three miles long, and of
considerable breadth.</p>
<p>"The numerous situations which present themselves as suitable
for any kind of machinery requiring to be worked by water, afford
a great variety for selection.</p>
<p>Crossing the arm of the Black Bluff, I ascended May-day Mount,
from which I obtained a first view of the lands discovered by Mr.
Hellyer, lying to the south-west, south-east, west, and
north-west of Valentine's Peak, and which combines a very large
tract of open forest ground thinly timbered, with extensive
intervening plains. The evening, May the 1st, I took my quarters
upon a very large one, lying to the south-east of the peak, of
exceedingly fine soil and good grasses, and overrun by
kangaroos.</p>
<p>"May the 2nd, passing over a little heath and some forest
land, I came upon another part of the Surrey Hills, through which
the Leven winds its course to the northward, and I forded it,
middle deep, at a point where it has two branches, and if about
twenty yards wide. The country in the vicinity of this river is
so admirably laid out by nature, that it assumes very much the
appearance of a nobleman's domain, both as to extent and good
quality, particularly that part lying east of the river. On the
west it is of marshy description, yet not in the least degree
objectionable on that account, inasmuch as it will furnish a
profusion of feed in the event of 807 particularly dry seasons
occurring; and it lies well for draining to the river and
rivulets which intersect it, should such a measure at any future
period be deemed expedient.</p>
<p>"The Green Forest, which divides the Surrey from the Hampshire
Hills, comprises myrtle, sassafras, celery-top pine, with a
little stringy bark, all of large circumference. There was also
the pepper tree and fern tree, with musk and dogwood, through
which last it required great perseverance to penetrate, insomuch
that I was reduced to crawl through it on my hands and knees, and
even in this posture all my efforts were necessary to extricate
me from the trammels by which I was encompassed.</p>
<p>"On the 5th I reached the Hampshire Hills, through the heart
of which the Emu takes its course in a northerly direction to the
coast near Round Hills. The land on the banks of this river, and
of which there is a great extent running in a line for the Dial
Mountains, is similar, both in quality of soil and herbage, to
that of the Garden Plain at Circular Head; and this remark will
equally apply to the greater part of the clear lands throughout
my route, the heaths of course excepted.</p>
<p>"The weather being now exceedingly unpropitious, rather than
enter Arden Forest under such unfavourable auspices, I remained
on the hills, chiefly subsisting on kangaroo thickened with a
little flour, (this being the most economical mode of extending
the remains of that article,) until Thursday the 8th, when the
wind veered from the north-west to the south, and it became very
clear and fine again. This induced me to proceed, and in three
days I reached the coast, within about seven miles to the
eastward of Table Cape, and between two or three to the westward
of the river Cam, late the Emu.</p>
<p>"The whole distance from the Hampshire Hills to the coast is
forest, like the Green Forest before described, except two small
plots of grass land, as noted in the sketch. A considerable
proportion of this forest is very flat and dry;&mdash;is as rich
in soil as nature can well make it, and tolerably open to within
about three miles of the coast, when immensely high fern and much
fallen timber greatly obstructed my route.</p>
<p>"Slate and freestone are both to be obtained in the
neighbourhood of the Surrey Hills; the former upon the heath, the
latter at May-day Mount.</p>
<p>"A minute examination of the recently discovered open country
will occupy much time, but as far as I have been able. to
ascertain from actual observation and appearances, it is a tract,
both as to extent and other qualities, likely to suit the
purposes tor which it is required, and is therefore worthy the
search.</p>
<p>"From the numerous huts that present themselves, it is a part
of the country to which the natives frequently resort: and on the
heath I came so near them, that I distinctly heard their call for
the assembling of their forces.</p>
<p>"Friday the 11th. I this morning proceeded, at day-break, to
the mouth of the river Cam, and then continued along the shore to
the Emu River, on the west side of Round Hill Point, where I was
highly gratified by meeting Mr. Hellyer. On the 12th, I arrived
at Circular Head; and here I beg leave to state, that both
Richard Frederick and Isaac Cutts, who accompanied me in this
tour, have proved themselves worthy of any encouragement you may
bestow.</p>

10th January,
1828.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></p>
<p><span class="aa">my lord</span>,</p>
<p>I have the honour to report to your Lordship, that a more than
usual temper of hostility has, within the last six months,
manifested itself on the part of the Aborigines of this colony,
and has rendered some active steps for protection necessary, and
I fear some still stronger measures will be required.</p>
<p>On my succeeding to the government, I found the quarrel of the
natives with the Europeans, occasioned by an unfortunate step of
the officer in command of the garrison on the first forming of
the settlement, was duly aggravated by every kind of injury
committed against the defenceless natives by the stock-keepers
and sealers, with whom it was a constant practice to fire upon
them whenever they approached, and to deprive them of their women
whenever the opportunity offered. I considered it my duty,
therefore, to declare, by proclamation, that every individual
found to have committed any criminal act of aggression upon the
Aborigines, should be prosecuted before the Supreme Court. At the
same time I enjoined the magistrates and respectable settlers to
use every means to conciliate and protect them. The proclamation,
I have reason to believe, was not without effect; and I
endeavoured still further to cultivate a friendly intercourse,
and at least make the attempt to civilize this abased race, on
the occasion of the unexpected appearance of a tribe in Hobart
Town, by alluring them, with the promise of food and clothings,
to repeat their visit. And I had formed the plan of establishing
an institution, to which they might resort, in the hope that some
might be persuaded to adopt the habits of civilized life. After
stopping a few days, however, in the neighbourhood of Hobart
Town, the tribe went back to their haunts, and have not again
returned; though, to all appearance, they were highly satisfied
with the treatment they received, and made it understood that
they looked upon the governor as their protector.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of surprise that the injuries real or
supposed, inflicted upon the blacks, have been revenged upon the
whites, whenever an occasion presented itself; and I regret to
say, that the natives, led on by a Sydney black and by two
Aborigines of this island, men partially civilized, (a
circumstance which augurs ill for any endeavour to instruct these
abject beings,) have committed many murders upon the shepherds
and herdsmen in remote situations. And they have latterly assumed
so formidable an appearance, and perpetrated such repeated
outrages within the settled districts, that I have been
pressingly called upon by settlers, in several petitions, to
adopt some measure which should effectually free them from these
troublesome assailants, and from the nuisance of their dogs,
which, originally purloined from the settlers, have increased to
such a number as to threaten to become a lasting pest to the
country.</p>
<p>But it is much easier to complain than to find a cure for the
evil, which none of the petitioners has ventured to suggest; and
I have not thought proper to do more than afford the protection
of some additional parties of police and military, and to point
out, by government notices, how far the settlers would be
justified by law in making use of arms to drive off the natives
who should present a hostile front.</p>
<p>The necessity of taking some decisive step, however, becomes
every day more apparent, as the settlers advance on the favourite
haunts of the natives; but I confess I feel the subject
exceedingly perplexing. The only remedy which I have heard
proposed is, to collect the natives, and remove them to some
island in the Straits, where there is no want of their accustomed
food, and where, by teaching them the art of cultivating the
soil, (in the mean time supplying them with bread,) they might
provide their own sustenance; and from the necessity which such a
situation would impose of becoming stationary, a better chance
would be afforded of success to any effort for their
civilisation. Not to mention the extreme difficulty of this
scheme, nothing short of the last necessity could tolerate so
great an aggravation of their injuries, as they Would
unquestionably consider removing them from their native tracts.
They already complain that the white people have taken possession
of their country, encroached upon their hunting grounds, and
destroyed their natural food, the kangaroo; and they doubtless
would be exasperated to the last degree to be banished altogether
from their favourite haunts; and as they would be ill disposed to
receive instruction from their oppressors, any attempt to
civilize them, under such circumstances, must consequently
fail.</p>
<p>The measure which I rather incline to attempt, is to settle
the Aborigines in some remote quarter of the island, which should
strictly be reserved for them, and to supply them with food and
clothing, and afford them protection from injuries by the
stock-keepers, on condition of their confining themselves
peaceably to certain limits, beyond which if they pass, they
should be made to understand they will cease to be protected.
With this view I caused a letter to be addressed to the
Commissioners of lands, directing them to point out some eligible
district in which the trial may be made.</p>
<p>The Commissioners have recommended the north-east coast, as
being the most advantageous situation for such a purpose,
conceiving, that food can be conveyed by water to that part with
the least possible difficulty, and that the natives themselves
(if they can be induced to remain quiet) would prefer it to any
other part, frequenting it as they continually do for shell fish,
and also on account of its being the best sheltered and warmest
part of the island, and remote from the settled districts.</p>
<p>It must be acknowledged that this plan also has its
difficulties, which indeed the migratory habits of the
Aborigines, and their attachment to their savage mode of life,
must attach to any scheme, consistent with humanity, for
effectually protecting the settlers from their outrages. But it
is but justice to make the attempt; for notwithstanding the
clamour and urgent appeals which are now made to me for the
adoption of harsh measures. I cannot divest myself of the
consideration that all aggression originated with the white
inhabitants, and that therefore much ought to be endured in
return before the blacks are treated as an open and accredited
enemy by the government.</p>
<p>In prosecuting the plan I have suggested, only a very limited
expenditure will be authorised, until I am honoured with the
result of your Lordship's consideration of this most interesting
and important subject.</p>

<p><span class="aa">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sir</span>,</p>
<p>I had the honour to communicate to Lord Goderich, in my
despatch of the 10th of January last, the painful necessity of
adopting some decided measures to suppress the increasing spirit
of resentment manifested by the coloured inhabitants of this
colony, and the difficulty which I felt in determining the
measures which it would be most advisable to pursue.</p>
<p>It gives me great concern to state, that the animosity of
these wretched people is in no degree abated, and that their
increasing predatory incursions upon the settled districts, which
are accompanied with the perpetration of frequent barbarous
murders, have overcome my reluctance to proceed to any coercive
measures against them.</p>
<p>The subject has undergone several days' anxious deliberation
and discussion in the executive council; and having examined all
such persons as are competent to give information, I am it length
convinced of the absolute necessity of separating the Aborigines
altogether from the white inhabitants, and of removing the former
entirely from the settled districts, until their habits shall
become more civilized.</p>
<p>The proclamation which I have issued, with the unanimous
advice of the Council, fully explains the origin and progress of
the unhappy feeling which exists, and the measures directed for
the purpose of averting its further fatal consequences.</p>
<p>It is a subject most painful under every consideration; we are
undoubtedly the first aggressors, and the desperate characters
amongst the prisoner population, who have from time to time
absconded into the woods, have no doubt committed the greatest
outrages upon the natives, and these ignorant beings, incapable
of discrimination, are now filled with enmity and revenge against
the whole body of white inhabitants. It is perhaps at this time
in vain to trace the cause of the evil which exists;&mdash;my
duty is plainly to remove its effects; and there does not appear
any practical method of accomplishing this measure, short of
entirely prohibiting the Aborigines from entering the settled
districts; a measure, however, which you may be assured shall be
carried into execution without the least avoidable harshness.</p>
<p>I have long indulged the expectation, that kindness and
forbearance would have brought about something like a
reconciliation; but the repeated murders which have been
committed have so greatly inflamed the passions of the settlers,
that petitions and complaints have been presented from every part
of the colony, and the feeling of resentment now runs so high,
that further forbearance would be totally indefensible.</p>
<p>My intention was, to have given up one district to the
natives, but such a spirit of dissention exists amongst the
tribes themselves, that it cannot possibly be accomplished.</p>
<p>It is painful and distressing to banish the natives from their
favourite haunts; but, beyond this, there is no occasion that his
Majesty's government should be apprehensive, and I do not even
yet resign all the hope of pacifying those angry feelings which
are at present but too evident on both aides.</p>
<p>His Majesty's instructions command that every measure shall be
resorted to for the instruction and civilization of the natives;
may I therefore beg to be honoured with your commands, whether,
in promoting this attempt, I am to consider myself authorised to
afford some temporary relief in food and clothing, which I fear
affords the only prospect of quieting a tribe of savages, and
may, perhaps, be absolutely necessary for their support beyond
the settled districts?</p>

<p align="right">Downing Street, 20th February, 1829.</p>
<p><span class="uu">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sir</span>,</p>
<p>I have had the honour to receive, and to lay before the king,
your Despatch of the 17th of April last.</p>
<p>His Majesty has learnt with much concern, that the
conciliatory measures to which you had resorted, with the view of
establishing a friendly intercourse with the Aborigines of Van
Diemen's Land, should have so completely failed; and that the
hostility which continues to be manifested on the part of these
people, notwithstanding the endeavours which have been so often
used to induce them to adopt more civilised habits, should have
rendered other and more decisive measures necessary for the
security of the lives and property of the settlers, as well as
for the protection of the coloured inhabitants themselves.</p>
<p>As it appears that you have not had recourse to the present
alternative of confining the haunts of the natives to particular
limits, until you had tried every other possible means of
removing the existing evils, his Majesty has commanded me to
signify to you his approval of the Proclamation which you have
issued for that purpose, and of the instructions which you have
given to the civil and military authorities for carrying its
provisions into effect. I am aware of the extremely difficult
task of inducing ignorant beings of the description of those
alluded to, to acknowledge any authority short of absolute force,
particularly when possessed with the ides which they appear to
entertain in regard to their own rights over the country, in
comparison with those of the colonists. I cannot, however, omit
to impress upon you, my most earnest desire, that no unnecessary
harshness may be exercised in order to confine the coloured
inhabitants within the boundaries which you have fixed.</p>
<p>To such of the tribes as may appear to you deserving of
assistance in the shape of clothing and subsistence, you will
afford these articles; but in thus leaving it to your discretion
to apportion that assistance, his Majesty tehes confidently on
your limiting it as much as possible; taking care that the
persons who may receive such benefits may understand that they
are alone indebted for them to the peaceable disposition they
have manifested, and to the submission which they have shewn to
the orders of the Colonial Government.</p>

<span class="aa">Arthur</span> to Mr. Secretary <span class=

1828.</p>
<p>With reference to the Despatch which I addressed to you on the
17th of April last, I have the honour to acquaint you, that in
furtherance of the proclamation which accompanied it, military
parties have been sent to the frontiers, with orders to prevent
the Aborigines from approaching the settled districts; and I am
happy to state that the native people, except in two or three
instances, when they were immediately driven back, have not since
shown themselves in any force, nor committed any violence; this,
however, may, in some measure, be accounted for by their custom
of resorting to the coast in the winter season.</p>
<p>There is nothing, I would repeat, to be apprehended from the
natives to excite your alarm, or to check emigration; the
measures resorted to will, I am persuaded, be effectual, and my
only hope is, that they may prove so without sacrificing the
lives of these wretched ignorant beings.</p>

<p class="negindent3"><span class="aa">Extract</span> of a
<span class="aa">Despatch</span> from Lieutenant-Governor
<span class="aa">Arthur</span> to Secretary <span class="aa">Sir
George Murray</span>, dated Van Diemen's Land, 4th November,
1828.</p>
<p>With reference to my Despatches to Mr. Secretary Huskisson of
the 17th of April and 5th July last, I regret to report, that the
spring had do sooner commenced, than the natives renewed their
hostile attacks, in a manner which shewed their intention to
destroy, without distinction of sex or age, all the white
inhabitants who should fall within their power; and as the
measures resorted to, under the proclamation issued on the 15th
of April, (copy of which I had the honour to inclose in my
despatch,) proved ineffectual to remove the native people from
the settled districts, and as considerable doubts had arisen how
far under it the acts could be justified which were 'necessary to
expel them, I was under the painful necessity of again bringing
the subject before the executive council, with the view, under
its advice, of adapting stronger measures.</p>
<p>After the most anxious deliberation on two successive days,
the members of the council concurred in recommending, as the only
means of affording to the king's subjects protection against the
atrocities of the aborigines, that they should be declared under
martial law, and I have felt myself called upon to issue a
proclamation of martial law against them, copy of which I have
the honour to enclose.</p>
<p>Though it has been unavoidably necessary to have recourse to
this strong measure, I am in hopes that it will be the means of
putting a speedy stop, without much bloodshed, to the lawless
warfare which has been lately carrying on between the natives and
the settlers and stockmen, by compelling the former (to whom it
may be possible to make known, through such as may be captured,
the consequences of remaining in the settled districts) to retire
to those parts of the colony which are excepted from the
operation of martial law. You will perceive by the proclamation,
that the use of arms is still in no case to be resorted to until
other measures for driving them off shall have foiled; and upon
the same principle are my instructions to the police magistrates
and military officers drawn up, copy of which I have the honour
to enclose. And you may be assured that every means in my power,
which are most consistent with humanity, will be used, even at
the present extremity, for bringing about a good understanding
with these wretched beings.</p>
<p>I propose immediately visiting all the military outstations,
and I sincerely hope, at an early period, that it may be in my
power to report that the aboriginal natives are reduced to a
state of quietness, and that the measure which has been resorted
to, of treating them as open enemies, may be annulled. Terror may
have the effect which no proffered measures of conciliation have
been capable of inducing.</p>
<p>With regard to the alarm which it is stated in the minute of
council exists among the settlers, it is doubtless very
distressing that so many murders have been committed by the
Datives upon the stockmen, but there is no decided combined
movement among the native tribes; nor, although cunning and
artful in the extreme, any such systematic warfare exhibited by
any of them, as need excite the least apprehension in the
Government; for the blacks, however large their number, have
never yet ventured to attack a party consisting of even three
armed men.</p>

<p><span class="aa">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sir</span>,</p>
<p>I have had the honour to receive your Despatch of the 4th of
November, by which it appears, that in consequence of the
determined spirit of hostility manifested by the black or
aboriginal natives of Van Diemen's Land, and the acts of
barbarity which they have committed on defenceless settlers, you
have found yourself compelled, as the only mode of preserving the
lives of his Majesty's subjects, to resort to the extreme measure
of proclaiming martial law with respect to the aboriginal
inhabitants in those districts of your government which are the
most exposed to the inroads of those people.</p>
<p>His Majesty's Government have learnt with extreme regret, that
you have been obliged to resort to this alternative. Whilst,
however, they lament the ineffectual efforts which you have used
to establish a friendly intercourse between the white population
and the native tribes, they cannot, under all the circumstances,
withhold their sanction from the measure which you have adopted.
I have therefore to approve of the proclamation which you have
issued for putting in force martial law, as a means of compelling
the natives to keep within certain districts prescribed, beyond
the settled country; and if the instructions given to the
magistrates and other officers, founded upon that proclamation,
be executed by them in the same spirit by which you have been
guided, I trust that the result will not only secure the lives
and property of the settlers, but benefit the natives
themselves.</p>
<p>It appears, from a paragraph at the end of the circular
instructions addressed to the military officers, that twelve sets
of directions have been issued, one to each of the twelve
officers employed, prescribing to each the manner in which he is
to proceed with relation to the circumstances of his own
particular district, in removing the natives.</p>
<p>I have to request that you will send me a copy of each of
these sets of directions, together with copies of any other
orders which may have been issued to those officers, or to any
other persons entrusted with this difficult and anxious duty.</p>
<p>As you appear to have provided in your proclamation against
any unnecessary interruption or interference with the ordinary
course of the law, I will not urge this subject further upon you;
and his Majesty feels assured that you will recall your
proclamation, and restore the law to its proper state, at the
first moment after the accomplishment of the object for which
your measures have been taken.</p>

<p>In your Despatch of the 25th August last, after acknowledging
my Despatch of the 4th of November, 1828, in which I had the
honour to lay before you the measures p which I had been
compelled to resort, in order to protect the settlers from the
attacks of the aboriginal natives, by the proclamation of martial
law against them, you are pleased to require me to furnish you
with a copy of the orders which had been issued to the military
officers employed in aid of the civil power, in the protection of
the settled districts, together with copies of any instructions
which may have been given to any other persons intrusted with
this difficult and anxious duty.</p>
<p>In obedience to your directions, I beg to transmit copies of
the whole of the instructions which have been issued both to the
civil and military authorities; the latter, indeed, have been
almost entirely restricted to act as auxiliaries to the civil
power.</p>
<p>Your desire to be furnished with copies of these instructions,
leads me to conclude that his Majesty's Government will be well
pleased to be supplied with still more ample information upon
this highly interesting subject than my despatches have hitherto
contained, although I trust you will be satisfied that it has
been my endeavour throughout to afford a comprehensive statement
of our situation to his Majesty's Government.</p>
<div>Some time before I was honoured with your communication, as
the hostile spirit of the natives appeared to increase rather
than to subside, and as I observed there was some difference of
opinion in the community, many respectable inhabitants in Hobart
Town earnestly desiring a continuance of conciliating measures,
whilst the residents in the interior deemed more severe measures
essential to their preservation, I judged it expedient to appoint
a Committee to collect the most ample information, and to
consider what measures it would be necessary to pursue. The
records of such a committee, composed of the most discreet and
most qualified officers of the government, I considered would
afford a most satisfactory</div>

this subject, have enabled it to trace out the origin and
progress of this hostility, together with the views and measures
of the Colonial Government, with very great precision; and in the
ample report which I have now the honour to lay before you, I
feel very confident that it will be highly satisfactory to you to
find that, much as the present state of things is to be deplored,
the orders and measures of the government have been uniformly
consistent in inculcating the most amicable and friendly feeling
towards the aboriginal natives.</p>
<p>That the lawless convicts, who have from time to time
absconded, together with the distant convict store-keepers in the
interior, and the sealers employed in remote parts of the coast,
have, from the earliest period, acted with great inhumanity
towards the black natives, particularly in seizing their women,
there can be no doubt; and these outrages have, it is evident,
first excited, what they were naturally calculated to produce in
the minds of savages, the strongest feelings of hatred and
revenge.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is equally apparent that the aboriginal
natives of this colony are, and ever have been, a most
treacherous race; that the kindness and humanity which they have
always experienced from the free settlers has not tended to
civilise them in any degree; nor has it induced them to forbear
from the most wanton and unprovoked acts of barbarity, when a
fair opportunity presented itself of indulging their disposition
to maim or destroy the white inhabitants.</p>
<p>Our present state, there can be no doubt, is very distressing,
as far as it places all remote settlers in much danger and
continued apprehension, from the sudden attacks of these savages;
but, notwithstanding the agitation which is excited, it is my
deliberate opinion, founded on personal observation, having just
returned from visiting the districts which have been most exposed
to the incursions of the natives, that there would be little to
fear if ordinary measures of precaution were adopted with spirit
by the settlers. The indifference I have generally noticed is
quite remarkable, and strikingly manifests that people, are
always much mote ready to complain of evils than disposed to
exert themselves to overcome them; not that I mean to assert that
the sudden attacks of the natives are at all times to be avoided,
and are not very alarming, but certainly much more precaution
might be individually used in every family; and this is, after
all, the only effectual security which can be given, unless a
safety-guard were placed in every dwelling, a thing which is
impossible.</p>
<p>The Report of the Committee I received in the Executive
Council, on the 19th March, as I was desirous that there should
be a full discussion of the whole subject, and that the members
of the Council should obtain such further oral information as had
not been incorporated by the Committee in the Report. And it was
the decided opinion of the Council, that the recommendations of
the Committee, so for as they advised still more energetic
measures, should be forthwith carried into effect, but that no
prospect of conciliation, however desirable conciliation was,
should induce the least abatement of the most active
operations.</p>
<p>In the margin of the Report I have made such observations as
present themselves to my mind on the several recommendations of
the Committee, and I would earnestly beg to draw your particular
attention to the whole of that document, which tends to throw a
very great light on the most interesting, and, I may add, the
most embarrassing circumstances of this Government. His Majesty's
subjects must be protected, and the outrages of the black natives
must be repressed; and yet, if it can be avoided, these wretched
people must not be destroyed.</p>
<p>On the destruction by fire of the premises and cornstacks of
Mr. Howells and Captain Clark, and subsequently of Mr. Sherwin,
the Council advised that a reward of £5 should be offered for the
capture of every adult native, and £2 for every child. This
inducement to activity in capturing the natives alive, it seems
most desirable to encourage; and I am glad to find it falls in
with the view of the Committee. The Government order which
directs this reward, will be found in Enclosure No. 1. p. 35, and
it will, I trust, meet your approbation.</p>
<p>I hope you will permit me to request,</p>
<p>First, That the strong detachment of the 63d Regiment, which
is detained at Swan River, may be relieved either from the
Mauritius or the Cape, and ordered to join their corps, which
will be a valuable acquisition to the force in this colony.</p>
<p>And secondly, I would anxiously hope that, immediately OD
receipt of this despatch, you will be pleased to recommend that
all the transports about to sail with convicts from England (the
Irish convict not having been hitherto sent to Van Diemen's Land)
may be ordered to proceed to this colony; at once 2000 might be
assigned away, if they were at all a useful class of men, and by
distributing them principally among the settlers in the most
remote parts of the colony, very great protection would be
afforded at a very trifling expense to the Government. Should
this suggestion meet your acquiescence, I would beg to recommend,
that in taking up the transports, it may be provided in the
charterparty, that the Lieutenant-Governor should have the power
to order any transport to proceed from Hobart Town to the port of
Launceston, by which means a proportion of the convicts may be
landed at once at the north side of the island, if it be found
desirable.</p>
<p>By the Report of the Committee you will perceive that the
enmity of the native inhabitants is coeval with our settlement in
the colony, and has been progressively increasing; and that they
have hitherto rejected all our efforts to conciliate them. Their
numbers, I am persuaded, are inconsiderable; although from their
migratory habits, it is difficult to calculate them with any
certainty. They are naturally a slight and very feeble race, but
certainly their exploits in the pursuit of plunder have rendered
them much more daring and robust during the last two years; and
it is rather the apprehension that they may become still more
formidable that makes me uneasy, than any dread of their present
prowess.</p>
<p>At the moment of concluding this despatch, I have received an
encouraging report from two of the parties who are employed on an
embassy of conciliation. Mr. Robinson, who proceeded to the
south-west with a party, to which were attached some native black
men who had been captured, reports that he has fallen in with a
tribe which had received him with so much kindness that he felt a
strong hope of eventually conciliating them; and Mr. Batman, who
has been employed on the north-east coast, represents that he
has, through the intervention of some black women, a very
reasonable prospect of conciliating a tribe in that quarter.
These miserable beings, I make no doubt, are wearied with the
harassing life they have endured for a considerable time past,
and would gladly be reconciled, if they knew our real intentions
towards them were those of kindness; but unfortunately, the most
conciliatory measures of the Government have been already
frequently rendered nugatory by the barbarity of runaway
convicts, or of detached stock-keepers.</p>

<span class="aa">Report</span> of the Aborigines Committee, 19th
March, 1830.</p>
<p align="right"><small>Committee Room, Government House,<br>
Hobart Town, 10th March, 1830.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Committee appointed to enquire into the origin of the
hostility displayed by the black natives of this island against
the settlers, and to consider the measures expedient to be
adopted with a view of checking the devastation of property, and
the destruction of human lives, occasioned by the state of
warfare which has so extensively prevailed, have the honour to
report, for his Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor's information,
the result of their investigation.</p>
<p>With a view to prepare themselves for recommending any
specific measures, no less than to enable his Excellency to judge
of their propriety and probable effect, they have Bought for
information respecting the disposition displayed by the natives
from the very first establishment of the colony, and have
endeavoured to obtain a connected view of the origin, progress,
and existing character of their hostility. Upon all these points
the Committee have collected a considerable mass of evidence,
oral and written, which they annex to this report, and to which
they beg to refer, in confirmation of the statements and
reasonings herewith presented.</p>
<p>From the testimony of persons who, from long residence in the
colony, are best qualified to afford information, the Committee
have collected, that many causes of offence, some wanton and
others unintentional, were given to the natives by the first
settlers, and have been from time to time renewed in opposition
to the expressed disposition and desire of the Government to
protect the former from violence and injustice. There is too much
reason to apprehend that, as the white population spread itself
more widely over the island, and the settlers came mote
frequently in contact with the natives, many outrages were
committed which no interposition of the Government, however
well-disposed, could, with the means at its command, have been
able to prevent. It would indeed appear, that there prevailed at
this period too general a forgetfulness of those rights of
ordinary compassion to which, as human beings and as the original
occupants of the soil, these defenceless and ignorant people were
justly entitled. They were sacrificed, in many instances, to
momentary caprice or anger, as if the life of a savage had been
unworthy of the slightest consideration; and they sustained the
most unjustifiable treatment in defending themselves against
outrages which it was not to be expected that any race of men
should submit to without resistance, or endure without imbibing
ft spirit of hatred and revenge. The Committee allude to those
attacks which, it has come to their knowledge, were then
frequently made by lawless and desperate characters, for the
purpose of carrying off the native women and children; attempts
which, if resisted, the aggressors did not scruple to accomplish
with circumstances of dreadful and unnecessary barbarity. In
exemplification of this assertion, the Committee cannot but
mention one fact, which, from its atrocity, would have appeared
to them perfectly incredible, had it not been confirmed by
testimony which they cannot doubt. A person named Carrots, since
dead, is known to have boasted, that having killed a native, in
his attempt to carry off his wife, he cut off the dead man's
head, and obliged the woman to go with him, carrying it suspended
round her neck. The accuracy of these representations would seem
to be most fully confirmed by the language of Proclamations
issued by Lieutenant-Governors Davey and Sorell, on the 25th
June, 1813, and 13th March, 1819, respectively, from which the
following extracts are given. Lieutenant-Colonel Davey states
that, "It having been intimated to the Lieutenant-Governor, that
a very marked and decided hostility has lately been evinced by
the natives in the neighbourhood of the Coal River, in an attack
they made upon the herds grazing in that district, he has felt it
his duty to enquire into the probable causes which may have
induced them to adopt their offensive line of conduct; and it is
not without the most extreme concern he has learnt that the
resentment of these poor uncultivated beings has been justly
excited by a most barbarous and inhuman mode of proceeding acted
upon towards them, viz. the robbery of their children. Had not
the Lieutenant-Governor the most positive and distinct proofs of
such barbarous crimes having been committed, he could not have
believed that a British subject would so ignominiously have
stained the honour of his country and of himself; but the facts
are too clear, and it therefore becomes the indispensable and
bounden duty of the Lieutenant-Governor thus publicly to express
his utter indignation and abhorrence thereof."</p>
<p>In the Proclamation of Colonel Sorell, the following passages
occur:&mdash;"The Lieutenant-Governor is aware that many of the
settlers and stock-keepers consider the natives as a hostile
people, seeking, without provocation, opportunity to destroy them
and their stock; and towards whom any attempts at forbearance or
conciliation, would be useless. It is however most certain, that
if the natives were intent upon destruction of this kind, and if
they were incessantly to watch for opportunities for effecting
it, the mischief done by them to the owners of cattle and sheep,
which are now dispersed for gracing over so great a part of the
interior would be increased a hundred fold. But so far from any
systematic plan for the destruction of the stock or people being
pursued by the native tribes, their meetings with the herdsmen
appear to be generally incidental; and it is the opinion of the
best informed persons who have been longest in the settlement,
that the former are seldom the assailants; and that when they
are, they act under the impression of recent injuries done to
some of them by white people. It is undeniable that, in many
former instances, cruelties have been perpetrated, repugnant to
humanity and disgraceful to the British character, whilst few
attempts can be traced on the part of the colonists to conciliate
the natives, or to make them sensible that peace and forbearance
are the objects desired. The impressions remaining from earlier
injuries are kept up by the occasional outrages of miscreants
whose scene of crime is so remote as to render detection
difficult, and who sometimes wantonly fire at and kill the men,
and at others pursue the women, for the purpose of compelling
them to abandon their children. This last outrage is perhaps the
most certain of all to excite in the sufferers a strong thirst
for revenge against all white men, and to incite the natives to
take vengeance indiscriminately, according to the general
practice of an uncivilized people, whenever, in their migrations,
they fall in with herds and stockmen."</p>
<p>The Committee, while they lament to revive these imputations,
apparently too well founded, against the earlier colonists, are,
however, not prepared to say, that the description given by
Lieutenant-Governor Sorell of the passive and inoffensive
character of the aborigines, unless when previously attacked, is
entirely supported by the evidence before them. It would appear,
that on the first landing of the settlers in the Derwent, under
Lieutenant Bowen, they were permitted for a time to proceed in
their operations, without any, or at the utmost with a very
slight, manifestation of dissatisfaction on the part of the
natives. The first act of decided hostility was committed at
Risdon, on the eastern shore of the Derwent, at which place the
settlement was under the command of Lieutenant Moore, of the 102d
regiment. This occurrence took place the 3d of May 1804; and the
Committee have some difficulty in deciding-whether it is to be
considered as originating in an aggression by the natives calling
forth measures of self-defence, or in an attack upon them
commenced by the settlers and military, under an impression that
an attempt was about to be made upon the position, by the
unusually augmented number of natives who had made their
appearance in the neighbourhood. It appears unquestionable that a
person named Burke, whose habitation was considerably advanced
beyond the rest, was driven from it by the natives, whose number
was estimated at upwards of 500, and much violence was threatened
by them towards this man and his wife and dwelling. But it is the
opinion of some persons who were then in the colony, that the
displeasure of these people was excited only by finding this hut
erected upon ground to which, as being favourably situated for
water and hunting, they were in the habit of resorting, and on
which they were preparing at this time to hold a general
assembly; and that they had no more hostile intention than to
remove this obstacle to their proceedings; while it is deposed to
by one who was an eye witness, that they did not proceed even to
this extent of aggression. Their having been accompanied by their
women and children, whom, when engaged in expeditions of danger,
they are known to be in the habit of leaving in a place of
security, is a circumstance strongly in favour of the opinion
that they had in view no other than a peaceful purpose, and that
they were not the first assailants. But whatever may have been
the actual course of previous events, it is indisputable that a
most lamentable encounter did at this time ensue, in which the
numbers slain of men, women, and children, have been estimated as
high as fifty; although the Committee from the experience they
have had in the course of this inquiry of the facility with which
numbers are magnified, as well as from other statements
contradictory of the above, are induced to hope that the estimate
is greatly overrated.</p>
<p>Whether or no the resentment occasioned by this encounter has
been ever since maintained, and has continued to influence the
natives in their feelings towards the white population, it is
impossible with perfect certainty to determine. It is, however,
manifestly shewn that an intercourse with them on the part of
insulated or unprotected individuals or families has never been
perfectly secure. Although they might receive with apparent
favour and confidence such persons as landed from time to time on
various parts of the coast, or fell in with them in other remote
situations, yet no sooner was the store of presents exhausted, or
the interview from other causes concluded, than there was a risk
of the natives making an attack upon those very persons from whom
they had the very instant before been receiving acts of kindness,
and against whom they had up to that moment suffered no
indication of hostility to betray itself. There have been, until
the occurrence of the late outrages, and their consequent total
estrangement, repeated instances of the natives exhibiting such
confidence as, without any hesitation, to approach the dwellings
of the settlers, and to partake of such refreshments as were then
very generally offered to them, and this friendly intercourse
having sometimes continued for several days, was usually
terminated by their departing to their own districts in a regular
and peaceable manner, so long as they were held in restraint by
the presence of a sufficient number of observers: but it is
within the knowledge of many members of the Committee, and has
been confirmed by other statements, that even at this period
there was, beyond all doubt, in the disposition of the
aborigines, a lurking spirit of cruelty and mischievous craft,
as, upon very many occasions, and even on their retirement from
houses where, as above stated, they had been kindly received and
entertained, they have been known to put to death, with the
utmost wantonness and inhumanity, stock and hut keepers, whom
they fell in with in retired stations, at a distance from
protection, and who, there is every reason to believe, had never
given them the slightest provocation. The opinion of the
Committee is most decided, that these acts of violence on the
part of the natives, are generally to be regarded, not as
retaliating for any wrongs which they conceived themselves
collectively or individually to have endured, but as proceeding
from a wanton and a savage spirit, inherent In them, and
impelling them to mischief and cruelty, when it appeared probable
that they might be perpetrated with impunity: at the same time
they have no hesitation in tracing to the manifold insults and
injuries which these unhappy people have sustained from the
dissolute and abandoned characters whom they have unfortunately
encountered, the universal and permanent excitement of that
spirit which now prevails, and which leads them to wreak
indiscriminate vengeance, as often as they find opportunity, on
the persons and property of the white population.</p>
<p>On turning their attention from the proceedings of individuals
to those of the government, the Committee derive the utmost
satisfaction from discovering that, on the part of the latter, an
uniform anxiety has prevailed to protect the natives and to
secure for them the treatment which justice and humanity require.
In evidence of this feeling, they have already referred to the
proclamations of Lieutenant-Governors Davey and Sorell in 1813
and 1819, and they have before them other documents, of still
earlier date, having the same object in view. So early as the
29th of January, 1810, a general order was issued by
Lieutenant-Colonel Collins, declaring, that any person who should
offer violence to a native, or should in cool blood murder or
cause any of them to be murdered, should, on proof being made of
the same, be dealt with and proceeded against as if such violence
had been offered to or murder committed on a civilised person.
With the proclamation of Colonel Davey already noticed, publicity
was given to an extract of a letter from Lord Hobart to
Lieutenant-Governor Collins, in the following terms: "You are to
endeavour, by every means in your power to open an intercourse
with the natives, and to conciliate their good-will, enjoining
all persons under your government to live in amity and kindness
with them; and if any person shall exercise any acts of violence
against them, or shall wantonly give them any interruption in the
exercise of their several occupations, you are to cause such
offender to be brought to punishment, according to the degree of
the offence." In evidence of the continuance of this feeling, the
Committee may also refer to a proclamation of Lieutenant-Governor
Sorell, dated 19th May, 1817; herein it is stated that, "Whereas
several settlers and others are in the habit of maliciously and
wantonly firing at and destroying the defenceless natives, or
aborigines, of this island, and whereas it has been commanded by
his Excellency the Governor-in-Chief, that the natives should be
considered as under the British Government and protection, these
instructions render it no less the duty than it is the
disposition of the Lieutenant-Governor to forbid and prevent, and
when perpetrated to punish, any ill-treatment of the native
people of this island, and to support and encourage all measures
which may tend to conciliate and civilize them."</p>
<p>There is some ground for believing that these humane
precautions were not wholly inefficacious in procuring at least a
partial return of confidence on the part of the natives, as in
the Hobart Town Gazette of the 18th April, in the following year,
the Committee find it stated, that notwithstanding the hostility
which has so long prevailed in the breasts of the natives of the
island towards Europeans, we now perceive, with heartfelt
satisfaction, that hatred in some measure gradually subsiding.
Several of them are to be seen about this town and its
neighbourhood, who obtain subsistence from the charitable and
well-disposed. In other directions there is however too much
reason to fear that the former system of injury and destruction
was still pursued, as the Committee find that His Excellency, the
present Lieutenant-Governor, considered it necessary to
re-publish, on the 23rd June, 1824, the proclamation of his
predecessor, bearing date May 1817, to which attention has been
above directed. Proceeding in the course of events, the Committee
find recorded a government and general order, dated the 4th
November, 1824, importing, that a body of natives having come
into Hobart Town, the Lieutenant-Governor requests that the
utmost kindness may be manifested towards them, until some
arrangement can be made by the Government for providing for their
accommodation and removing them to some proper establishment.</p>
<p>This tribe was subsequently removed to Kangaroo Point, where
they experienced a continuance of the humane attention
recommended in the government order, and, being under no
restraint, they were in the habit of departing and returning as
often as their own convenience dictated, or they were desirous of
obtaining fresh supplies of food and clothing, with which they
were liberally furnished. This satisfactory intercourse appears
to have subsisted during a period of two years, but not to have
had the effect of inducing the black inhabitants, in any
considerable numbers beyond those who originally came in, to
associate and domesticate themselves among the settlers. It is
even to be feared, from the nature of the events which led to the
termination of the intercourse here described, that such a
display of kindness had failed to inspire them with any sentiment
of attachment or of forbearance from their inveterate habits of
treachery and mischief.</p>
<p>A barbarous murder was committed near Oyster Bay, of which two
of the tribe frequenting Kangaroo Point were ascertained to be
the perpetrators. On their next return to that spot, they were
arrested on this charge, and after conviction on the clearest
evidence before the Supreme Court, were executed on the 16th
September, 1826. After this occurrence, the natives came no more
to the usual-place of resort. They have resisted every subsequent
attempt on the part of government or of individuals to enter into
intercourse or explanation with them; and from that period, the
frequency of their attacks on white persons and their property
has been gradually increasing. It is, however, necessary to
remark, that whatever influence resentment, arising from the
execution of the above offenders, may have had in exciting them
to such acts of violence, there were other causes in operation,
contributing to produce this result, especially the outrages of
the bush-rangers, who were then at large in the country.</p>
<p>The Committee beg leave, in proof of the truth of this remark,
to refer to a single instance, that of the notorious Dunne, who,
after a long course of atrocity, was captured. about the middle
of October, 1826, and suffered the penalty of his crimes. A few
days previous to his seizure, this man made his appearance at the
hut of Mr. Thomson, on the further bank of the Shannon, bringing
with him a black native woman, whom he acknowledged he had stolen
from her tribe, and whom in that hut he treated with violence,
from which she endeavoured ineffectually to escape. After this,
Dunne swam across the river Ouse, and landing on the opposite
bank, found himself in the midst of that tribe of natives, from
whom the woman had been carried off. During several hours he
withstood their attacks, and finally succeeded in escaping. But
their revenge was not to be thus disappointed; on the day
following that on which this atrocious act had been committed by
Dunne, and within a few miles of the spot, two men driving a cart
were attacked in a secluded wood near the Clyde, by a party of
natives, headed by a half-civilized black who hod been some time
at the settlement at Macquarrie Harbour. One of the men, William
Tidwell, was pierced by a spear through his thigh, and perished.
The same party afterwards attacked the but of Mr. Nicholas, and
subsequently that of Mr. Thomson before mentioned, where James
Scott was killed. The Committee particularly allude to this
catastrophe, in consequence of the evidence received before the
coroner, Thomas Anstey, Esq., on view of the body of Scott,
plainly developing the connexion between this act of violence on
the part of the natives and the previous outrage of Dunne. Mr.
Thomson's servant deposed&mdash;Some few weeks ago, Dunne, the
bush-ranger, brought a native woman to our hut; he brought her by
force. The same woman was with the tribe of natives when they
attacked and plundered our hut, and she was with the party who
threatened us with death on the following day, about which time
Scott was killed. (See Hobart Town Gazettes, October 14th, 21st,
and November 18th, 1826.)</p>
<p>Having brought down to this period the detail of occurrences,
and stated such as in their opinion are calculated to account for
the enmity displayed by the black against the white population,
the Committee deem it expedient to exhibit a brief compendium of
the measures which have been adopted by the government,
subsequently to the date last mentioned. Their purpose is thereby
to furnish means of judging in what degree those measures have
accomplished the intended purpose; and of further considering
what proceedings may be now expedient and necessary for the
tranquillization of the colony.</p>
<p>On the 29th November, 1826, a government notice was issued,
wherein, after reference to the series of outrages perpetrated by
the aborigines, and a statement of his Excellency's uniform
anxiety to inculcate a spirit of forbearance towards them, it was
promulgated,</p>
<p>1st. That in the event of a felony being committed, or of an
apparent determination existing on the part of the native tribes
to attack, rob, or murder the white inhabitants, any persons
might arm, and joining the military, contribute to drive them by
force to a safe distance.</p>
<p>2d. That they might be apprehended, and if resistance were
offered, force might be resorted to for that purpose, by my
persons acting under the direction of a magistrate or
peace-officer, in cases of their assembling in such manner as to
excite fear, or betraying an intention to do any harm, short of
felony, to the person or property of any one.</p>
<p>3d. That if any natives should have actually committed
felonies, the magistrates should use all exertions to discover
and apprehend, on their warrant, the principals concerned
therein, and that the officer executing the same might employ
force, if the offenders could not otherwise be taken, or if acts
of violence or intimidations were resorted to by them or on their
behalf.</p>
<p>4th. That any person having actually witnessed the commission
of a felony, might raise the neighbourhood and pursue and seize
the offenders by all such means as a constable might use.</p>
<p>On the 29th November, 1827, a second government notice
appeared, which refers to the renewal of aggressions by the
aborigines against the stock-keepers and other white inhabitants,
and directs the magistrates to act with vigour upon the
principles laid down in the order of the preceding year, of which
the substance has been just detailed. At the same time, the
Lieutenant-Governor stated, that sufficient troops to give
confidence to the inhabitants would be at the disposal of the
civil power in every district; but expressed his wish to have it
understood that his own confidence chiefly reposed in the
adoption of vigorous measures by the magistrates and constables,
who were expected to unite every degree of prudence and humanity
with the energy and decision so necessary on this distressing
occasion. On the 15th April, 1828, a proclamation was issued for
the protection of the aboriginal natives against the attacks of
aggression, violence, and cruelty committed on them by the
stock-keepers and others his Majesty's subjects, and for the
purpose of causing the natives to retire from the settled
districts of the island, in consideration of their continuing to
perpetrate frequent unprovoked outrages on the persons and
property of the settlers, and to commit repeated nan ton and
barbarous murders and other crimes. Herein it is further
represented, that the aborigines have, during a considerable
period of time, evinced and are daily evincing a growing spirit
of hatred, outrage, and enmity against the subjects of his
Majesty, and are putting in practice modes of hostility
indicating gradual though slow advances in art, system, and
method, and utterly inconsistent with the peaceable pursuits of
civilized society, the most necessary arts of human subsistence
and the secure enjoyment of human life.</p>
<p>In order, therefore, to prevent as far as possible collisions
which were attended with consequences so fatal, the proclamation
now in question established a line of military posts along the
confines of the settled districts, within which the natives were
forbidden to penetrate. All practicable methods were directed to
be employed to make known to them the provisions of the
proclamation, in furtherance of which object a letter from the
major of brigade, dated 21st April, 1828, informed the officers
commanding detachments, that the colonel commanding would
authorize them to offer any reasonable reward to persons who
should succeed in becoming the channel of such
communications.</p>
<p>All these measures of forbearance having, however, failed to
produce the desired effect, and acts of murder and devastation
being continually on the increase, a proclamation declaring
martial law against the natives was issued on the 1st November,
1828, excepting from its operation only certain specified
districts. The actual use of arms was at the same time strictly
prohibited in all cases wherein the natives could be induced by
other means to retire beyond the prescribed limits, and the
proclamation was conveyed to the police magistrates, accompanied
by a letter from his Excellency the Lieutenant Governor, wherein
it was stated, that, "the government puts forth its strength on
this occasion, by no means whatever with a view of seeking the
destruction of the aborigines; on the contrary, it is hoped, by
energetic and decisive measures and by punishing the leaders in
the atrocities which have been perpetrated, that an end may be
put to the lawless and cruel warfare which is now carrying on,
and which must terminate in the total annihilation of the
natives."</p>
<p>The observance of these principles of action has been
repeatedly inculcated since that period and up to the present
moment, by circular letters addressed to the police magistrates
and by garrison orders; but in consequence of the covert and
crafty mode adopted by the natives in making their approaches and
attacks, and their almost inconceivable adroitness in effecting
their escape, no progress whatever has been made in repressing
their outrages or apprehending their persons.</p>
<p>The suggestion formerly thrown out in the proclamation of
Lieutenant-Governor Sorell, as to the more extended mischief
which the natives would be capable of inflicting were they
incessantly to act upon a systematic plan of attacking the
settlers and their possessions, has been but too completely
verified by the events of the last two years, and still more
fatally by those of the few months which have just elapsed. It is
manifest that they have lost the sense of the superiority of
white men and the dread of the effects of fire arms which they
formerly entertained, and have of late conducted their plans of
aggression with such resolution as they were not heretofore
thought to possess, and with a caution and artifice which renders
it almost impossible to foresee or defeat their purposes.</p>
<p>They continue to occupy and ravage beyond the reach of control
and in defiance of the orders and efforts of government, those
settled districts which they were prohibited from entering. Since
the commencement of the present year an unparalleled series of
devastation has marked their passage through the country, as
atrocities perpetrated by them will abundantly testify.</p>
<p>After a careful comparison of the several statements they have
received, the Committee have no hesitation in expressing their
persuasion that a sentiment of alarm pervades the minds of the
settlers throughout the island, and that the total ruin of every
establishment is but too certainly to be apprehended unless
immediate means can be devised for suppressing the system of
aggression under which so many are at this time suffering, and of
which all are in dread that they may themselves become the
victims. It cannot be necessary to offer any additional
observation to prove that the measures hitherto resorted to,
though apparently the most judicious that could be devised, have
not been attended with success. The urgency of the case, and the
hazard to which the safety of individuals and the public peace
continue to be exposed, render it imperative on the Committee to
afford the government the aid of their best ability, and at least
to attempt the suggestion of some more effectual mode of
preservation and resistance. They cannot, however, enter upon
this province of their labours without expressing their entire
and hearty concurrence in the sentiments of humanity and
forbearance towards these wretched people so constantly enforced
by his Excellency the present Lieutenant-Governor and his
predecessors, in all the public documents which have been issued
in connexion with this subject. The feelings of his Majesty's
Government and of the British nation, they cannot doubt are
altogether in accordance with these views. For themselves, as
men, as Englishmen, and as Christians, the Committee are sensibly
persuaded, that every degree of moderation and forbearance is due
to an ignorant, debased, and unreflecting race, who, it is
impossible to doubt, were first excited to general aggression,
and systematic barbarity by the wrongs which they themselves
experienced on the part of miscreants who were a disgrace to our
name and nation and even to human nature. It is as they conceive
a plain and most imperative duty, a duty which they would on no
account take upon themselves the responsibility of violating or
of recommending others to violate, that no act of increased
severity should be resorted to against the natives, without first
having recourse to every conceivable and practicable method of
making known to them that intention, and of forewarning them of
the dangers and punishment to which they will expose themselves
by persevering in their present hostility. On the other band, the
Committee are bound to consider that the natives are now visinng
the injuries they have received, not on the actual offenders, but
on a different and totally innocent class; anjd they acknowledge
the force of the obligation to attend to the interests of that
very numerous portion of their fellow-subjects. In the
proclamation of the 15th of April, 1828, it was stated, with
equal force and justice, that the security and safety of all who
have entrusted themselves to this country on the faith of British
protection are</p>
<div>These views the Committee would therefore carry into effect,
by respectfully recommending to his Excellency the
Lieutenant-Governor the adoption of certain specific measures,
which they will now proceed to enumerate. They are perfectly
aware that such arrangements as they have to propose, cannot be
effected without a very considerable increase of expenditure; but
they are unavoidably compelled to overlook this consideration
from a sense that increased exertions are necessary for the
security of those who naturally, and with justice, look up to the
government for support and protection. They consider it,
moreover, a proceeding of manifestly good policy to make a
temporary sacrifice for the sake of preserving the whole property
of the colony from destruction, and to abate that waste of lives
which has of late been so rapidly on the increase.</div>
<table align="center" width="100%">
<tr>
<td width="60%">The most obvious suggestion certainly is, that
the first arrangements for precaution and defence should proceed
from the settlers themselves; and the first step to be taken with
this view is, that every head of a family, with every male of
competent age, at least those who are free, should be well
provided with arms, and act on all occasions with a watchful
regard to the security of their dwellings and possessions. It has
been clearly shewn, by repeated instances, that the natives have
by artifice decoyed persons to quit their houses for the purposes
of pursuit, who, on their return, have found their homes utterly
destroyed by fire and every thing of value carried off.<br>
<br>
It is impossible for the Committee to suggest, or for the
government to prescribe, all the measures of self-defence, which
in the event of an attack it may be necessary to adopt, but it is
their unanimous persuasion that all settlers should, with their
families and dependents, make the defence of their own habitation
the chief object of their concern; and should by no inducement be
persuaded ever to leave it without a competent guard.</td>
<td width="38%" style="font-size:90%; padding-left:10px;">
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">1st
recommendation<br>
of the committee.</span></div>
<br>
These suggestions the settlers have been most strongly exhorted
to attend to; they might certainly have been more watchful, and
have been ere this better armed; at the same time it is to be
borne in mind, that the means of many of them are very limited,
and that the labour of every servant they have is urgently
required upon their farms; and that they are ill able to support
them simply as a domestic police. It appears from a variety of
evidence, that servants working in the barn only a few yards
distant from the dwelling-house, have been insufficient to secure
it from depredation.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<div>This line of conduct appears to be the only one effectual
for defence; for it is justly observed by one of the gentlemen
who has favoured the Committee with an answer to their inquiries,
that "a house left without protection becomes an easy prey to
these insidious depredators, who will for days and weeks watch a
house that they have marked out for plunder, till they find the
whole of the males absent; they then pounce upon the dwelling,
and with a celerity incredible plunder it of every article they
consider valuable."</div>
<p>On the other hand, the Committee are persuaded by instances
which have occurred even within the last few days, that these
attacks are easily repelled where, parties are on their guard and
shew a determination to resist force by force; and they are
persuaded that nothing would so effectually deter the natives
from hostile attempts on dwelling-houses, as the certainty that
they would encounter resistance and a few instances of their
incurring a severe chastisement in retaliation for their
predatory attacks.</p>
<table align="center" width="100%">
<tr>
<td width="60%">In the next place the Committee consider it their
duty to recommend to every settler, to point out to his
stock-keepers and assigned servants the fatal consequences which
have resulted to the entire community from the base and barbarous
conduct which some of their class have pursued towards the
natives; how little surprising it is that the latter should
proceed to measures of retaliation; and how much it behoves them
to desist from a repetition of such disgraceful conduct, from a
regard even to their own safety, seeing that not one of those
barbarians by whom the natives were thus irritated has ultimately
escaped the effects of their vengeance.</td>

<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">2nd

<br>
The government orders and notices have been most pressing upon
this point; and the fact is that now, although the convict
stock-keepers may be equally disposed to act with barbarity, yet
their fears now prevail upon them to fly everywhere as soon as
the natives are seen.</td>

<td width="56%">With these efforts it would be proper that the
government should cooperate, by renewing, and with augmented
strictness, the prohibition to destroy kangaroos by hunting,
shooting, or other means, within the limits prescribed to the
natives, So great is the injustice of this proceeding on the part
of the whites, and so apparent the injury suffered by the
natives, through the destruction of this their principal source
of sustenance, that the Committee would deem it expedient, if
other modes of prevention fail, to make this a legal offence, to
be visited with very severe penalties. The unassisted efforts of
the settlers must, however, it is evident, be insufficient even
to defend their own dwellings. Other and more active measures,
such as the government alone can institute and support, must be
called for. It is therefore recommended that the chief direction
of all operations in every district shall be entrusted to the
police magistrate.</td>

<br>
Since this Report was presented, the Lieutenant- governor has
personally made the most particular inquiry upon this point, and
has ascertained that the prohibition against all convict servants
keeping dogs has been most effectual in its operation; and the
kangaroo actually abounds in the districts most frequented by the
natives.<br>
<br>
The act of council also, which has recently been passed to
prevent the increase of dogs in the colony, must have a very
salutary effect.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">4th

<br>
This has always been the case, with the exception of the roving
parties, which, to insure some uniformity in their proceedings,
were placed under the particular direction of the police
magistrate in the central district, Mr. Anstey, from whom they
received their instructions to proceed according to the
information obtained. If this force be augmented so as to afford
parties for each district, of course they will be better placed
under the orders of the police magistrates severally.</td>

That the field police should be increased to the utmost
practicable limit, and that sufficient inducements should be held

The field police composed of prisoners of the Crown whose conduct
merits consideration and indulgence, and every measure has been
adopted to render it complete and effective; at the same time, by
the admission into this band of any men of bad character, the
Government would only be getting rid of one present trouble by
letting in another. With every care in making the selection, it
is however most desirable to augment the field police during the
present exigency.</td>

aid of the civil power, so far as the very inadequate force now
in the colony will permit.<br>
<br>
The Committee are aware that the efforts of Government have never
been wanting in supplying the greatest possible amount of
disposable force to the disturbed districts.<br>
<br>
It is, however, worthy of consideration, whether, by some
additional encouragement, the efficiency of that force may not be
increased. The Committee would suggest, that an augmentation of
allowances should be granted to the soldiery while engaged in
this service; and that, to secure their efficiency and
discipline, they should be under the command of their own
officers, who should also receive a proportionate increase of
pay, at the expense of the colony.</td>

<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">7th

<br>
With respect to the military, they are of course already under
the orders of their own officers, and it may, perhaps, be
desirable to make some small allowance of tea and sugar to the
soldiers in lieu of their ration of rum, of which they are
necessarily deprived whilst actually serving in the bush. No
marching money being allowed in the colony, a double ration of
bread and meat was formerly given to the soldiers when employed
after the bush-rangers, which satisfied the poor settlers who
supplied them, and who always complained that the regulated
ration of bread and meat never compensated for the breakfast and
dinner consumed by the soldiers.<br>
<br>
A small colonial allowance of 5<i>s</i>. per diem to the officers
employed on this arduous and fatiguing duty would be perhaps
reasonable, as they receive no colonial allowance whatever.</td>

<tr>
<td width="56%">With respect to the mode in which the
descriptions of force here spoken of may be most advantageously
employed, the Committee do not consider themselves qualified to
offer an opinion, excepting so far as to point out some of the
defects in the system of the roving parties which have hitherto
been employed. To the propriety of engaging leaders of higher
qualifications, attention has been already directed. It is
besides the persuasion of the Committee, that notwithstanding the
exertions of that highly respected individual who has had the
superintendence of these parties, an error has been committed by
them in extending their march over too wide an extent of country,
whereby the natives have been either chased before them, and an
useless state of alarm has been kept up, or they have passed the
natives unperceived, and have left them unmolested to ravage the
country in their rear. It has also been proved that great want of
caution has been shewn in their mode of march, in carelessly
running backward and forward, talking, shouting, smoking, and
suffering other indications of their approach to alarm the keen
senses of the natives, and to warn them to fly. The Committee are
fully persuaded that such parties, conducted upon these
principles, are worse than useless; and they therefore recommend
that instead of traversing the country, as heretofore, without
system or mutual co-operation, each band should have a particular
portion of the district assigned to it, which it should
continually traverse, in the manner of a patrol, and endeavour to
obtain the roost intimate acquaintance with the tracks which the
natives pursue in their migrations, and the haunts (for such
there are known to be) which they by preference frequent. The men
under whose command they are, must also be such as possess
sufficient prudence and authority to repress all those imprudent
modes of proceeding above detailed, which necessarily gave alarm
to the natives, and preclude the possibility of coming upon them
by surprise. The only additional suggestion which the Committee
beg leave to offer is, that magazines of provision might be
established in central situations, from which the police and
military parties might receive their supplies, without the
necessity of quitting their stations, or interrupting their
pursuit.</td>

<br>
With respect to the roving parties, the observations made by the
Committee are, I believe, upon the whole, accurate. A better
class of leaders is certainly much required; but the difficulty
of getting persons of any respectability who will, day after day,
and night after night, expose themselves in traversing the woods,
is extreme. However, experience renders it evident that something
of this kind must be attempted.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Committee is right in the observation that these parties have
hitherto been too much on the move; but in justification of the
police magistrate, who has had the chief direction of them, it is
but due to observe, that when the parties have been kept in
motion, they have been censured for their indiscretion; and when
they have halted, they have been accused of inactivity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The fact is, measures which do not succeed are always
condemned.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">9th

<br>
This measure has already been carried into effect.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In recommending these measures, the Committee are animated by
a desire not to occasion, but to prevent, the effusion of blood;
they are desirous that the use of arms should be resorted to only
for the purpose of repelling an attack, or danger to life and
property, and that the main effort should be directed to capture
the natives alive and unhurt.</p>
<p>For the encouragement of this measure, they acknowledge the
propriety and recommend a continuance of the system adopted by
government, of offering a reward to any free person, military or
civil, by whom any such capture shall be effected; and they
presume that a ticket of leave, or other appropriate indulgence,
would not be withheld from a prisoner who should succeed in the
same object. They are persuaded that if the patrolling parties
are sufficiently numerous and persevering, the natives must
either be deterred from venturing into districts so occupied, or
by due vigilance in watching their movements, and caution in
approaching them, must be fallen in with and captured.</p>
<p>In effecting this, the design of the Committee is to attain
the means of opening, if possible, a communication with the
hostile tribes, and of convincing them generally, that the white
population have no other desire than the maintenance of peace. In
pursuance of this object, they have forwarded to his Excellency
their recommendation that the native women lately captured, and
who have been treated with kindness and indulgence, of which they
appeared very sensible, should be sent back to their tribe. To
this destination they have been forwarded with a suitable
safeguard; and the opinion of the Committee is, that as
opportunities present themselves, the same course should be
pursued with respect to any natives, male or female, who may in
future be taken prisoners, until it shall evidently appear that
this mode of acting has its effect in subduing their feeling of
hostility, or that they are utterly beyond the reach of
conciliation.</p>
<p>It is much to be desired, that, while under a state of
restraint, the natives should be accessible only to persons who
have the sanction of the government, as experience shews that,
from indiscriminate intercourse, they are liable to imbibe
impressions from ill disposed and improper characters, which
render them, on their return to their countrymen, more formidable
enemies than those who have never had any intercourse with
Europeans.</p>
<p>The Committee can scarcely imagine that these recommendations
will be considered as severe, or otherwise than they in their
consciences believe them to be measures of humane and necessary
precaution.</p>
<p>To guard against misconception, they, however, deem it
necessary to observe. That there are circumstances existing,
which would render it criminal to withhold protection from the
settlers, and which in some degree deprive the natives of their
claim to an entire forbearance from coercion. These are, first,
that the latter have resorted so systematically to the use of
fire for the destruction of property as to render their approach
to a dwelling house, without any other indication of hostility,
extremely hazardous; and secondly, that they are now not acting
the part of injured men, seeking to avenge the wrong they have
sustained, but rather that of marauders, stimulated by eagerness
for plunder and the desire of artificial luxuries, the use of
which has now become familiar to them. If, on the other hand,
there should be any who conceive that the aggressions lately
sustained by the settlers would justify a more severe exertion of
force against the natives than is here proposed, the Committee
would entreat them again to consider the circumstances in which
the present unhappy posture of affairs originated. They are
persuaded that under all provocation, and in opposition to any
appearance of immediate advantage, the wisest policy will always
be found to be that which has justice for its basis. They are
sensible that the natives had originally many causes for
complaint and many sources of provocation, from the treatment
they experienced, and excepting so far as may be necessary for
the actual defence of life and property, they desire for
themselves and for their country to be pure from the blood of all
men. The debt which they have incurred in taking possession of
this country they would willingly acquit themselves by every
justifiable degree of forbearance and moderation towards the
native inhabitants, and by leading them, if opportunity should be
afforded, into the paths of civilization.</p>
<p>In conclusion they venture to express a hope, that the
experience of present transactions may be even rendered useful in
the history of the world; and that in all future attempts at
colonisation, it may be steadily home in mind how strict an
obligation exists to exercise mercy and justice toward the
unprotected savage, and how severe a retribution the neglect of
those duties, even by individuals, may ultimately entail upon an
entire, an offending community.</p>

1830.</small></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="aa">sir</span>,</p>
<p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch
of the 15th of April last, transmitting copies of the orders
which you had issued to the civil and military authorities
employed in the protection of the districts most exposed to the
hostile attacks of the natives, accompanied by the report of a
committee whom you had appointed to enquire as to the origin of
those proceedings, and to consider the measures most expedient to
be adopted with a view to protect the settlers from a repetition
of them in future.</p>
<p>I regret to find that the steps which have been already taken
should hive proved ineffectual in establishing a more friendly
feeling on the part of the natives towards the settlers. Too much
praise, however, cannot be bestowed on the exertions which you
have need to conciliate these misguided people; and much credit
is also due to the gentlemen composing the committee, whose able
report you have transmitted, for the attention which they have
given this subject.</p>
<p>It does not appear of much importance at the present moment to
inquire further as to the quarter from whence the first
aggressions have proceeded, although I fear that it is too
evident, from the information obtained upon this point by the
Committee, that the provocation has principally originated with
the white people. The question which is now most essential to
consider, is, as to the remedy to be applied in the present
conjuncture; and I will, with this object in view, proceed to
make such observations as an examination of the papers before me
has suggested.</p>
<p>It is evident from the opinion of the Committee (and I
perceive that you have expressed yourself as strongly upon the
same point) that no effectual check can be opposed to the hostile
attacks of the natives, nor can the country ever be restored to a
state of security unless the settlers themselves evince a more
determined spirit of resistance to their opponents than they have
hitherto manifested. Although there can be no doubt that the
indifference of which you complain on the part of the settlers,
in a cause in which they are so much interested, might be urged
as an excuse for leaving them to their fate when assailed by the
natives, yet a due regard to the general interests of the
community would render it imprudent to decline affording
assistance to those settlers whose property may be most exposed
to plunder. At the same time you will take care, whenever called
upon to render such assistance, to impress upon the settlers the
necessity of relying, more than they have been accustomed to do,
upon their own exertions for protection; and you will require in
every such case, that the settle should take upon himself a
prominent part in the defence of the property threatened with an
attack. I am satisfied that in proportion as the settler is
reduced to this alternative, will be his anxiety to abstain from
all acts likely to irritate the natives, whilst, on the other
band, the latter will be less disposed to annoy the settler when
they find they can no longer do so with impunity.</p>
<p>The great decrease which has of late years taken place in the
amount of the aboriginal population, renders it not unreasonable
to apprehend that the whole race of these people may at no
distant period become extinct. But with whatever feelings such an
event may be looked forward to by those of the settlers who have
been sufferers by the collisions which have taken place, it is
impossible not to contemplate such a result of our occupation of
the island as one very difficult to be reconciled with feelings
of humanity, or even with principles of justice and sound policy;
and the adoption of any line of conduct, having for its avowed or
for its secret object the extinction of the native race, could
not foil to leave an indelible stain upon the character of the
British government.</p>
<p>The Committee has expressed an opinion, that these acts of
violence on the part of the natives are generally to be regarded
not retaliatory for any wrongs which they conceived themselves
collectively or individually to have endured, but as proceeding
from a wanton and savage spirit inherent in them, and impelling
them to mischief and cruelty when it appeared probable they might
be perpetrated with impunity. In order to the unqualified
admission however of this opinion, it would be necessary to have
established the fact, that aggressions had not begun with the new
settlers.</p>
<p>You have proposed as a means of mitigating the evil complained
of, that an increased number of convicts should be sent out to
Van Diemen's Land, and that the detachment of the 63d regiment,
at present at Swan River, should be withdrawn from thence and be
ordered to join the main body of that corps at Van Diemen's Land.
On the first of these points your wishes will be complied with if
possible; but with regard to the second, I must remind you, that
to seek a remedy in the augmentation of the number of His
Majesty's troops in the colony of Van Diemen's Land, would be to
trust to a resource which must unavoidably be both limited and
uncertain.</p>
<p>I approve of your increasing to a reasonable extent the field
police, and the awarding a moderate bounty to the military who
may be employed upon this particular duty; but I am of opinion
that this bounty should be supplied by the settler at whose
desire the soldier may be employed; not only with a view of
relieving the public of this additional expense, but to prevent
unnecessary applications from the settlers for military
protection, as no augmentation which could be made to the
military force under your command would be adequate to meet every
application of this nature from settlers whenever any danger
might be apprehended, nor would such a mode of employing the
military, if carried to excess, be at all consistent probably
with the discipline of the troops.</p>
<p>The mounted police could not be augmented in number, without
incurring a charge to which the finances of the colony would not
be equal; and it will therefore be desirable that the men now
composing this corps should be employed in watching the
proceedings of the natives, and in conveying to the settler in
whose neighbourhood they may have been seen, the earliest
intelligence of their movements, in order that he may secure his
habitation, and make such other arrangements as shall appear to
him to be necessary to meet the approaching danger.</p>
<p>Upon many of the details which are adverted to by the
Committee in their Report, I do not consider that I can enlarge
with any advantage. The local authorities can only appreciate the
several recommendations with which the Report concludes, and it
must accordingly be left to you to decide as to the best mode of
stationing the police authorities, and of establishing the
magazines of provisions and other necessaries which they may
require in the execution of their duties. I cannot, however,
refrain from adverting specially to the measure proposed by the
Committee, of prohibiting the settlers from destroying the
kangaroos by bunting or shooting them within the limits
prescribed to the natives, in order that this grievance may be
immediately removed, although I am happy to find that no injury
has been sustained on this head, in consequence of there
appearing to be no real scarcity of these animals in the
districts which these people most frequent.</p>
<p>Although it is greatly to be feared that much time and pains
will be requisite to alter the footing upon which the British
settler and the aborigines of the colony unfortunately stand
towards one another, I cannot conclude this despatch without
urging upon you, in the strongest manner, to continue to use your
utmost endeavours to give to the intercourse between them a less
hostile character than it now has; and to employ every means
which kindness, humanity, and justice can suggest to reclaim the
natives from their original savage life, and render them sensible
of the advantages which would ultimately result to themselves and
to their descendants, from the introduction amongst them of the
religion and the civilization of those whom it must be difficult
for them to regard at present in any other light than as
formidable intruders. With this object in view, the utmost
forbearance will be requisite on the part of the settlers, in
every case in which a native may fall in their way; and I hope
you will be able, by degrees, to prevail upon the settlers to
believe that such a line of conduct, both on their own part and
on that of their assigned servants, will not only be the most
proper and becoming, but will also prove in the end to be the
most conducive to their own interests and their security.</p>

<span class="aa">Arthur</span> to Secretary Sir George
<span class="aa">Murray</span>; dated Van Diemen's Land, 20th
November, 1830.</p>
<p>By my despatch of the 15th April last you will have been
informed, that notwithstanding the united efforts of the
Government and the respectable part of the community to
conciliate the natives, they continued to shew the most rancorous
and determined spirit of hostility to the white people, and the
settlers had become importunate in their calls upon the
Government for protection; I still, however, persevered in the
attempt to open a friendly intercourse with these people, and Mr.
Robinson, the person who had been placed in charge of the
establishment which I formed for the natives in Bruné Island,
having offered to proceed on a mission to the tribes inhabiting
the south-west quarter of the island, I readily availed myself of
his proposal, and for a short period during the winter months I
had great hopes that a friendly understanding might be restored;
some of the natives belonging to a tribe which had been known to
be hostile, in the north-east quarter of the island, having
approached a party of white people in a peaceable manner, and Mr.
Robinson having succeeded in communicating amicably with some
tribes in the north-west. Being most anxious that the peaceable
disposition which had thus been shewn should be encouraged, I
caused on this occasion the Government notices to be issued on
the 19th and 20th August. But I regret to state, that in the same
week the natives attacked and plundered, in a more systematic
manner than they had hitherto done, several residences in the
heart of the settled districts; and so great was the alarm
created by the promulgation, at such a moment, of the Government
notices in question, that, with the advice of the council, I felt
it necessary to issue a further notice.</p>
<p>I have felt myself imperiously called upon by overruling
necessity to act upon the advice of the council, by calling upon
the settlers to unite with the Government in a vigorous effort
upon an extended scale, to endeavour to surround and capture the
natives or expel them from the settled districts. With this view,
I caused the Government order to be published of the 9th
September; and directed the general movement by the community, of
which the Government order of the 22d September contains the
outline. And as it was indispensable to the success of the
arrangements that the whole island should be declared under
martial law, I issued, with the advice of the council, a
proclamation for the purpose.</p>
<p>All classes of the community have manifested the greatest
alacrity and zeal in seconding the measures of the Government, on
this occasion. The settlers have come forward with their personal
exertions and the assistance of their servants, whilst the
gentlemen of the towns have volunteered to do the duty of the
garrison, in a manner which demonstrates how much importance is
attached to the measures directed Tor the protection of the lives
and properties of the settlers, and how cordially and entirely
the whole community unite with the earnest desire of the
Government, rather to capture the savages and place them in some
situation of security, where they can neither receive nor inflict
injury, than destroy their lives.</p>
<p>In the month of July last, three native women, who were
captured last year, and subsequently treated with the utmost
kindness, were deputed to go out with presents to their tribe,
and assure them of the friendly feeling of the Government towards
them, and-invite them to be conciliated. The women readily
undertook the embassy, appeared very sensible of the humanity
they had experienced, and promised to use their influence amongst
their tribe, which they felt confident would prove successful. Up
to the period of the communication of the present measures,
however, they had not returned; but two weeks afterwards they
appeared, at the place appointed, the residence of Mr. Bateman,
in the police district of Campbell Town, and brought in with them
the chief and nine other men of the tribe. According to the
arrangement which had been previously determined upon, Mr.
Bateman treated these savages with the utmost kindness,
distributing to them clothing and food; they were placed under no
restraint, but all the indulgence which had been pledged was
manifested toward them. Mr. Bateman, who has taken the most
lively interest in conciliating these wretched people, and has
been one of the few who supposed that they might be influenced by
kindness, was, with his family, most assiduous in cultivating the
beet understanding; but after remaining with him eight or nine
days, they silently withdrew in the dead of the night, robbing
Mr. Bateman of every thing they could lay their hands upon, and
in their progress plundering every but, and spearing every white
man who had the misfortune to encounter them.</p>
<p>In October last, two of the natives belonging to the western
tribe delivered themselves up to a shepherd; they were lodged in
the Penitentiary at Launceston, as a place of some security, as
well as of some protection for them; and according to the
directions which have been peremptorily enjoined, they were
treated with kindness, and abundance of food and clothing was
provided for them, but within a month they effected their escape,
and the first notice which was received of the direction they had
taken was accompanied by the painful information of their
outrages. Eumarrah, the chief of the Stoney Creek tribe, was
captured two years ago; for some time after his capture he was
narrowly watched, but by his Apparently artless manner, and
strong protestations of attachment, lie was gradually confided in
more and more, until at length I felt a confidence that he would
be greatly instrumental in carrying into effect the measures so
ardently desired for conciliation. I have continually had him
brought to the Government House, and personally satisfied myself
that he fully understood that the wishes of the government were
those of kindness and benevolence towards his race. On this
occasion, therefore, I brought him with me, and entrusted him to
conduct a party of the natives, assuring him that they should be
clothed, fed, and protected; but to my disappointment and sincere
regret, he availed himself of the first moment to abscond, and
has, I fear, rejoined his tribe with the most hostile
intentions.</p>
<p>Other instances might be adduced of the treacherous character
of these savages; but those I have mentioned will satisfy you,
perhaps, that conciliatory measures are not likely to succeed,
and cannot in prudence be any longer pursued. It is, however,
particularly gratifying to me to reflect that they have been
persisted in as long as then was a hope of success, since I
collect from the despatches I have had the honour to receive,
that such a proceeding is in entire accordance with the views of
his Majesty's Government, although certainly a different opinion
has been formed by many of the oldest inhabitants of the
Colony.</p>
<p>Failing in every endeavour to conciliate, and the outrages of
the savages being more daring, and their murders and robberies
more systematically conducted, the next measure which we are
bound to attempt is, I conceive, that which is now in progress,
the earnest and hearty co-operation of the whole European
population to capture them, with the least possible destruction
of life, or to drive them into Tasman's Peninsula.</p>
<p>You will, Sir, readily admit, that no undertaking can be more
arduous, under any circumstances or in any country, than to
capture savages; and the difficulty is greatly augmented in this
colony, the country being perhaps the most rugged on the face of
the earth. Van Diemen's Land is perhaps unequalled by all other
islands, for the salubrity of its climate and for the fertility
of its valleys, but no country that I am acquainted with, has so
large an extent, in proportion to its area, of wild,
unproductive, impervious, rugged mountains and dense forests.
Upon capturing the native savages I cannot say,
therefore,&mdash;although it has always been a favourite notion
in the colony,&mdash;that I have ever been very sanguine; but as
a portion of the south-east quarter, containing many thousand
acres of most unprofitable soil for Europeans, is well suited for
the purpose of savage life, abounding in game, I have entertained
strongly the opinion, that it might be practicable to drive the
savages into that portion of the territory, and that there they
might be retained, as it is connected only by a very narrow neck,
which might be guarded. The united efforts of the community have
therefore been directed to this end,&mdash;either to capture, or
drive the native tribes which have been the most sanguinary and
the most perfidious and hostile, towards Tasman's Peninsula. The
Government orders are declaratory of the objects of Government,
and the measures proposed for carrying them into effect; and the
rough field-plans and memorandum will still mote distinctly point
out to you the several movements which, upon the most anxious and
deliberate consideration, appeared to me calculated to impel the
savages forward from the settled districts towards the country in
which it was desired to secure them.</p>
<p>The operations were first commenced on the 4th of October, at
the most remote districts, and after an advance of eighteen days,
the position was occupied from Prosser's Bay to Sorell, and five
parties were then sent within the circuit formed, to ascertain
whether the natives, who had frequently been discovered to be
driven before the troops, were then within our chain of posts.
The parties thus sent were selected from inhabitants most
accustomed to the hush and to the habits of the natives; and they
were instructed not to risk the hazard of attempting to capture a
few, but rather to gain information. This instruction,
unfortunately, was not sufficiently regarded; the savages were
discovered by one of the parties, and two of them were captured,
and two were shot in the struggle, and the rest disposed,
although still within the chain of posts.</p>
<p>Since this occurrence the parties within the circuit have been
considerably augmented, but all their endeavours to surround or
drive on the natives towards East Bay Neck have been unavailing,
and it is only by their traces, and a few being seen
occasionally, that we ascertain them to be within the chain of
posts. A force composed chiefly of volunteers cannot, of course,
be long expected to hold together: the settlers, notwithstanding
their exceeding anxiety to capture the blacks, become most
impatient of delay, and now no alternative remains but to advance
<i>en masse</i>, affording the chance to the savages to escape
through the numberless gaps which must inevitably be opened out
in advancing over the rugged mountainous country before us,
although it is very probable that their fears may prevent them
from making the attempt.</p>
<p>I am sorry that the Science sails for England to-morrow, which
precludes me from reporting the result, which must be decided in
another week. The providence of God will, I trust, crown the
measure with success, since it will be a most happy deliverance
for all parties that these savages are removed from the
possibility of continuing the dreadful murders and outrages which
have marked their career for some time past. I cannot, how. ever,
say that I am sanguine of success, since their cunning and
intelligence are remarkable; but whilst I hope his Majesty's
Government will approve of my having omitted no measures which
had a tendency to conciliate or to preserve the lives of these
savages, I am sure it will always be a matter of consolation to
the Government of the colony, and to its respectable inhabitants,
that we have made every effort in our power to save the
aboriginal race from being exterminated, which must be the result
if they can neither be conciliated nor taken; self-preservation
will compel the inhabitants to destroy them.</p>
<p>The idea seems too monstrous to be credited, but it is my duty
to report, that there are very strong reasons for apprehending
that some miserable convicts have incorporated themselves with
the savages.</p>
<p>I need not, I am sure, add that this subject wholly engrosses
and fills my mind with painful anxiety; but it is my greatest
consolation, that the prosperous circumstances of the colony in
every other respect, are highly cheering, and that the cordiality
and good feeling which universally prevail between the Government
and the community, encourage me to hope, that whatever measures
may be deemed necessary for our common security, will be heartily
concurred in by all classes.</p>
<p>His Majesty's Government maybe assured, that as soon as
conciliation be possible, I shall most readily and eagerly
embrace it; but I sincerely believe, if we cannot capture, or
drive the natives entirely out of the settled districts, that
there will be no possibility of conciliating, until some of their
most sanguinary chiefs have been shot.</p>
<p>I hope in my former despatches I have succeeded in conveying
to His Majesty's Government exactly the progress of this heavy
calamity upon the colony: its history is very brief. The
aborigine savages of Van Diemen's Land were early distinguished
for their extreme timidity and extreme cunning and treachery.
Soon after the colony was settled, in the year 1805, a scarcity
of provisions was felt, amounting almost to a famine; in this
extremity, the convicts were permitted to go into the bush, in
order to find food, and as the country abounded with game, they
readily discovered it, and were subsequently indisposed to return
and submit to the authority of the Government. This state of
things continued until the year 1809 or 1810, and laid the
foundation for that system of plunder which was denominated
bush-ranging. The convicts leading this predatory course of life,
continually associated with the aboriginal natives, whom, at is
unquestionable, they treated with the most unnatural cruelty,
taking away their women and often murdering the men. The
sea-faring people employed in the sealing trade also united in
the commission of these acts of cruelty; and although the
miserable savages were too timid to resent the atrocities
committed upon their tribes openly, they nevertheless secretly
speared their oppressors whenever favourable opportunities placed
them within their power. Unable to distinguish between the class
of persons whom I have described and the stock-keepers, they no
doubt frequently vented their enmity upon the latter, and hence
the enmity between the natives and the Europeans was extended.
The savages having become more expert, became also more bold and
sanguinary, and undoubtedly they would, without distinction,
murder every white inhabitant, if they could do so with safety to
themselves. In the year 1824, great encouragement was held out to
the natives, to seek the protection of the Government; and three
tribes especially, the Big River, the Oyster Bay, and the
Abyssinia tribes, were treated with peculiar kindness: huts were
erected for them, and food provided, and they were sure of
protection from all the respectable part of the community, as
well as from the Government I had frequent interviews with them
myself, and held out to their chiefs the strongest assurances of
protection. Still their enmity was evidently unabated, and I have
no doubt they were continually ill-used by the dissolute and
abandoned convicts who had absconded either from the Government
or from the service of the settlers.</p>
<p>From this or other exciting causes, the character of the
savages has evidently become more and more hostile; and although
their natural timidity still prevents them from openly attacking
only two armed persons, however great their number, yet they
will, with a patience quite inexhaustible, watch a cottage or a
field for days together, until the unsuspecting inhabitants
afford some opening, of which the savages instantly avail
themselves, and suddenly spear to death the defenceless victims
of their indiscriminate vengeance; and success in various
instances seems now to have made them as eager in this mode of
warfare, (their object being to plunder as well as to destroy the
white inhabitants,) as they were in pursuing the kangaroo. Two
Europeans who will face them, will drive fifty savages before
them, but still they return and watch, until their unerring
spears can bring some victim to the ground. This, which is a
faithful statement of our situation, must, I am persuaded,
convince you, that the hope of conciliation cannot at this time
be reasonably entertained, nor can measures to attain it be any
longer prudently acted upon.</p>

<p>With reference to my despatch of the 20th November last, I
regret to report that the measures which I had the honour to lay
before you, terminated without the capture of either of the
native tribes; but there is reason to believe, from the
comparative forbearance which the savages have since observed,
that the late decisive operations of the Government, and of the
community generally, have had the effect of deterring them in a
great measure from their usual aggressions: and indeed a party of
thirteen, from two of the most hostile tribes, including three
chiefs, have lately peaceably come in and sought protection, and
there are grounds for anticipating that others will follow their
example. I cannot hope, however, that they will generally desist
from destroying the settlers and their property, unless the most
vigorous measures be continued on the part of the Government, in
co-operation with the inhabitants. You may however be assured,
that although I feel the necessity of carrying on the decisive
measures which the safety of the inhabitants demands, I shall not
relax in resorting to every practicable means of endeavouring to
conciliate these deluded beings, which it is no less my anxious
desire than it is the wish of His Majesty's Government to
effect.</p>
<p>However tranquil and prosperous we may be in all other
respects in this colony, I can well imagine that your anxiety
will be great upon this interesting subject, and it will
doubtless, therefore, be satisfactory to you to be informed, that
it has been a most gratifying proof of the confidence which the
inhabitants of the colony place on the measures of the local
government, that notwithstanding the partial failure of the late
attempt to capture the natives, I have received addresses from
the people from all quarters, and which have originated, not with
those from whom the government might expect more-especially to
receive support, but from the people indiscriminately, expressive
of their grateful sense of the protection which the government
has evinced its readiness to extend to them, and pledging
themselves to give their assistance and co-operation whenever,
and in whatsoever manner, they shall be called upon to afford
them.</p>

<span class="aa">Despatch</span> from Viscount <span class=
"aa">Goderich</span> to Lieutenant Governor <span class=
"aa">Arthur</span>, dated Downing Street, 17th June 1831.</p>
<p>I have had the honour of receiving your despatch of the 20th
of November 1830, containing your answer to that addressed to you
by Sir George Murray, and your report of the measures you had
been compelled to adopt towards the native tribes, the result of
which I have also learnt by your subsequent despatch of the 1st
of January last.</p>
<p>The employment of force being indispensable, the plan of
driving the natives into the peninsula at the extremity of the
island, seems to me to have been well calculated to afford the
necessary security to the colonists for their lives and property,
with the least possible injury to the unhappy beings whom you
were forced to treat as enemies. The unsuccessful issue of the
operations undertaken for this purpose is therefore greatly to be
regretted, though, considering the difficulties with which you
had to contend, a different result was rather to be hoped than
expected. I shall await with some anxiety further accounts of
what has taken place. Although the surrender of some individuals
shews that your operations have not altogether failed in their
object, but have inspired the natives with no little dread of
your power, yet it will be, I fear, hardly sufficiently strong to
conquer the spirit of animosity and the love of plunder which
seems to have grown up amongst them. In this unhappy state of
things, it is most satisfactory to me to be enabled to rely so
implicitly upon your energy under every emergency, as well as on
your humanity towards a race entitled by the wrongs which they
have suffered to much forbearance, even while it is necessary to
repel their attacks. The confidence reposed in you by all classes
of the inhabitants, will enable you to turn to the best account
the resources of the colony, and is the just reward of the zeal
and ability which have distinguished your administration of its
affairs.</p>

<p>I have the honour to report that since I addressed to you my
despatch of the 1st of January last, although the native tribes,
against whom the measures of the government had been chiefly
directed, have not committed any aggressions, I regret to state
that the tribes on the north side of the island have renewed
their violence and committed several murders.</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson having returned from his conciliatory mission,
the aborigines committee have been attentively engaged in
receiving his communications, and have drawn up a report of the
future measures which they recommend for the protection of the
community and the preservation of the natives. It has not yet
been in my power to lay the report before the executive council,
but I shall take an opportunity of doing so early next week, and
shall have the honour of reporting to you by the next vessel the
measures which I shall decide to adopt. In the mean time I
transmit a copy of the committee's report for your

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="aa">sir</span>,</p>
<p>In consequence of the return of Mr. G. A. Robinson from his
conciliatory mission to the aborigines of this island, and his
Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor having expressed his desire
that the Committee appointed for this especial purpose should
re-assemble and resume its sittings; in obedience to this command
the Committee did meet from time to time, and have the honour now
to submit the following report on those points to which their
attention was directed by his Excellency, and also on the subject
of your two letters of the 1st and 3d instant, which they have
the honour to acknowledge, and upon which they are required to
give their opinion for the information of the government.</p>
<p>The first subject of their inquiry was, to ascertain how far
Mr. Robinson had succeeded in the main and principal objects of
his mission, viz. the opening an amicable intercourse and
friendly communication with the whole of the black population of
this island. The Committee feel great pleasure in testifying
their opinion, that Mr. Robinson has, in a great measure,
accomplished this object, and that in so doing he has manifested
the most daring intrepidity, persevering zeal, and strenuous
exertion. He appears to have acquired a competent knowledge of
their language, enabling him to converse with them, and to
explain the kind and pacific intentions of the government and the
settlers generally towards them.</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson appears also to have gained the confidence of the
natives to such an extent, that several of the most hostile class
have put themselves under his protection, and he feels confident
of the possibility of effecting the voluntary removal of the
entire black population, which he is of opinion is not more than
700 in number, in the course of two or three years, holding out
to them inducements of food and clothing, and a country where,
under the protection of the government, they will be secure from
the aggressions of the sealers and bush-rangers, and no restraint
imposed on their amusements and sports of the chase.</p>
<p>This circumstance leads to the second subject for the
consideration of the Committee, viz. the selection of the most
eligible place for the immediate formation of an establishment to
receive those that have been taken, and for the future reception
of the whole of the aborigines. The Committee have anxiously
endeavoured to procure the best possible information with regard
to the different islands in Bass's Straits, and after mature
deliberation, they are unanimous in the opinion, that Gun
Carriage Island, situated between Great Island and Cape Barren,
and about eleven leagues distant from the main, possesses more
advantages than any other island or place whatever for such an
establishment. There is excellent anchorage for vessels, and it
is well supplied with wood and water; it is about two miles long
and a mile and a half wide, and is surrounded by several islands
of the same extent. The natives will be enabled to pass over to
Cape Barren for the purposes of hunting; but as it does not
abound with game, they will return to the establishment where
they will always find food and clothing, &amp;c.; the island also
abounds with mutton birds, and also the surrounding coast with
shell-fish, their favourite foods.</p>
<p>The Committee are of opinion, that it would be better to farm
the establishment on this island, than to place them in any
situation where, restraint would require to be imposed, is they
conceive from the nature of their habits, and other
circumstances, the natives would soon feel discontented and pine
away.</p>
<p>To Gun Carriage Island, therefore, the Committee recommend the
immediate removal of those natives who have committed themselves
to the guardianship and protection of Mr. G. A. Robinson, and
that a government vessel be immediately despatched, under the
command of some intelligent officer, accompanied by Mr. Robinson,
equipped with all the necessary stores, &amp;c., together with a
small military guard for the protection of the blacks, and more
especially their women, from the aggressions of the sealers and
whalers, for the purpose of conveying the whole of the natives to
this place that are now on Swan Island or elsewhere.</p>
<p>It will be necessary to remark here, that this island and
those around it are much frequented by the sealers, whalers, and
also runaway convicts; the Committee therefore recommend that
such sealers, &amp;c. &amp;c. as are now living on these islands
be ordered to remove forthwith, and that no vessels or boats be
allowed to navigate these straits for the purposes of sealing or
whaling without a licence from the Government; and for the proper
regulation of this trade, and for the most desirable object of
apprehending those convicts who have or may is future effect
their escape, the Committee are of opinion that a small armed
vessel in these straits appears to be essentially necessary, and
is a measure which they would strongly recommend to the
consideration of the Government.</p>
<p>This vessel may also be made available in conveying supplies
and stores, &amp;c. to the establishment.</p>
<p>As the removal of the natives to Maria Island has been brought
under the notice of the Committee, as a temporary measure, they
feel it incumbent on them to state their objections to this
island as an establishment for the natives.</p>
<p>The first and insuperable objection is its being a penal
settlement; and to this must be added the circumstance of the
necessity of the contiguity of the two establishments, there not
being fresh water in any other part of this island. Waiving,
however, this objection, still the island is so near to the main
land as to hold out constant temptation to escape, which they
could accomplish with the greatest facility. The safe custody and
civilization of these people being the great objects of the
establishment, the Committee cannot recommend Maria Island for
this purpose to the Government. Another great objection to Maria
Island is, its not affording any harbour or safe anchorage for
vessels, which must necessarily be sent there with supplies.</p>
<p>During this inquiry, the Committee at one period were induced
to think favourably of King's Island as an eligible situation for
the establishment; but having very, maturely considered all the
advantages together with all the objections, they are led to the
conclusion, from the circumstance of the very great difficulty of
approaching it, in consequence of the strong prevailing westerly
winds, and entertaining doubts as to the security of a good
harbour and safe anchorage, that it is not calculated for the
object in view, And cannot, therefore, recommend it to
Government.</p>
<p>The Committee have now to state their opinion as regards the
best means of protecting the settlers from the aggressions of the
hostile tribes. To this subject the Committee have given great
attention, and they are unanimously of opinion, that the best
measures which can be adopted towards the aborigines are those
which have already been so successfully pursued by Mr. G. A.
Robinson; and they therefore recommend that an assistant should
be immediately appointed, who should proceed with Mr. Robinson to
Gun Carriage Island, and as soon as Mr. Robinson shall have seen
the natives comfortably settled, he shall renew his mission to
the hostile tribes, and endeavour if possible to open a
communication with them, and induce them to Join the
establishment at Gun Carriage Island.</p>
<p>The Committee however recommend, in the mean time, for the
protection of the distant settlers and stock-keepers, that
parties of armed men, four in number, should be stationed in the
most remote stock huts, with certain instructions as to their
manner of proceeding and general line of conduct. They cannot
recommend the measure of continuing the roving parties, as they
are of opinion that they have afforded no protection to the
settlers, and have only tended to increase the hostility of the
blacks, and therefore have not answered the objects of the
Government.</p>
<p>The last point to which the attention of the Committee has
been called is, the claim of Mr. G. A. Robinson on the Government
for the services he has performed. The Committee are unanimously
of opinion, that at the extreme hazard of life and health, and
foregoing every social comfort and family enjoyment, he has done
his duty; and they therefore respectfully recommend that Mr. G.
A. Robinson should be allowed a salary of £250, to commence from
the date of his appointment to this mission, and the further sum
of £100 as a free gift from the Government, for his important
services in the cause of humanity.</p>
<p>The Committee cannot close their Report without adverting to
the colonial secretary's letter of the 3d instant, inclosing
several communications detailing the renewed aggressions of the
natives in the interior, and they regret extremely to find that
they have again commenced hostilities; they cannot therefore too
strongly impress upon his Excellency the necessity of carrying
into effect the measures they have recommended, if approved, with
the least possible delay.</p>

<p>With reference to my despatch of 12th February last, inclosing
a Report of the Aborigines Committee, I have the honour to
transmit an extract of the proceedings of the executive council,
containing its advice upon the measures which the Committee
recommend with regard to the natives.</p>
<p>2dly. You will perceive that the council unanimously. advise
the adoption of the recommendation of the Committee, that the
thirty-four natives whom Mr. Robinson had induced to follow him
to Swan Island, should be removed to Gun Carriage Island, which
is situated in Bass's Straits, about eleven leagues from the
main, or on some other island which on examination might be found
more eligible for the purpose, and there be supplied with food
and clothing; and that the minority of the council further
advise, that Mr. Robinson should resume his mission to the native
tribes, and that other respectable persons, properly qualified
for the undertaking, should be employed in the same manner, to
act in unison and co-operating with him, with a view to
conciliate others of the hostile natives, and endeavour to induce
them to go voluntarily to the establishment in-the straits, and
there place themselves under the protection and care of the
Government. But upon this point the chief justice does not
coincide in opinion with the other members, and does not
recommend the adoption of measures tending to induce, the natives
in tribes to consent to expatriation. He rather recommends that
we should still strive to negociate with them, and that it should
be proposed to them to allow an European agent to reside with or
accompany each tribe, which agents would serve the double purpose
of protecting the natives and of checking any disposition towards
hostility on their part. The council further advise, that the
roving parties employed against the natives should be
discontinued, and that small parties of military should be
stationed at the remote stock hats id the interior for the
protection of the settlers.</p>
<p>3dly. As no time was to be lost in removing the thirty-four
natives from Swan Island, where there was no water, to Gun
Carriage Island or some other island in the straits, I have
despatched a small cutter for the purpose. Mr. Robinson has
proceeded in the vessel with the natives who accompanied him
round the island, and such as have from time to time been
captured; and his Instructions are, as soon as those on Swan
Island are removed and placed in security, to visit the islands
in the straits, and require the sealers to give up the native
women whom they have forcibly carried away, and to place these
women in safety with their countrymen at the intended aboriginal
establishment on Gun Carriage Island. When the establishment
shall have been formed, Mr. Robinson will undertake another
mission to the hostile tribes upon the plan he has so
successfully adopted, viz. approaching them unarmed in company
with a few friendly natives, explaining to them in their own
language the amicable intentions of the Government, and offering
food, and clothing, and protection from injury, on condition of
their being peaceful and inoffensive, or of their going to the
aboriginal establishment. By these means, and by conforming to
their customs and habits, this zealous and persevering individual
appears confident that he shall so ingratiate himself with the
natives, as to be able to induce them to accompany him, and to
remain upon the island where the establishment will be formed
without exercising actual restraint, the appearance of which, in
his intercourse with the natives, he has been cautious to
avoid.</p>
<p>4thly. As it appears to me most important to mark in an
especial manner the consequence which the Government attaches to
well-directed exertions to conciliate the natives, I have adopted
the recommendation of the Committee in allowing to Mr. Robinson,
subject to your approval, a salary of £250 per annum from the
date of his appointment to the mission, and so long as he shall
be retained in charge of the establishment, with a gratuity of
£100; which, indeed, from his long absence from his large family,
was only an act of justice; and I have further granted to him
2560 acres of land, free from restrictions. And in the hope of
inducing others to come forward in the same cause, the Government
notice, copy of which I have the honour to inclose, was
issued.</p>
<p>5thly. I regret to report, that since my last communication on
this subject, several murders have been perpetrated by the
blacks, without, as far as can be ascertained, any provocation
whatever; but I coincide with the chief justice, that as,
contrary to the most sanguine expectation, an individual has at
length been found, in the person of Mr. Robinson, who has had the
boldness, totally unarmed, to seek out, approach, and at length
confer with the natives, and has induced some of the most hostile
to accompany him to Swan Island, a hope may be entertained that
others may be conciliated and induced to follow the same course;
but with reference to the experience we have already had of the
instability of these savages, and attaching much importance to
Mr. Robinson's opinion that the chiefs have but little influence
over their tribes, and that he does not think they could deter
them from the commission of fresh atrocities, or that any
dependence could be placed in the observance of any treaty, even
if they could be induced to enter into it, I rather incline to
coincide with the other members of the council, that they should
be drawn, by every mild excitement, to resort to the aboriginal
establishment at Gun Carriage Island; for, even if they should
pine away in the manner the chief justice apprehends, it is
better that they should meet with their death in that way, whilst
every act of kindness is manifested towards them, than that they
should fall a sacrifice to the inevitable consequences of their
continued acts of outrage upon the white inhabitants.</p>
<p>6thly. I have caused such temporary accommodation as the
military have themselves been able to construct, with the
assistance of a few convict mechanics, to be erected at the most
remote districts; and in accordance with the advice of the
council, founded upon the recommendation of the Committee, the
military outposts will be maintained throughout the winter, and
small parties detached from them for the protection of the most
exposed settlers. This employment of the soldiers is exceedingly
harassing, and to you, Sir, I need not add, very destructive to
the internal economy of any troops; but I hope no precaution is
omitted which may tend to maintain their discipline, or prevent
that contamination which may always be apprehended from their
being placed in circumstances tending to promote the least
intercourse with convicts.</p>
<p>7thly. Our continued warfare with these miserable savages must
continue to be a subject of anxious consideration; but his
Majesty's Government may be assured that there is a most sincere
disposition, on the part of the constituted authorities, as well
as of the inhabitants generally throughout the colony, to embrace
every opening for conciliation.</p>
