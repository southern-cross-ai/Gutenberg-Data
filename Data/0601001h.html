<h2><a id="hawk1" name="hawk1">CHAPTER I</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TO a man standing in the gorge below, the man
clinging to the sloping cliff would have been invisible, hidden
from sight by the jutting ledges that looked like irregular stone
steps from a distance. From a distance, also, the rugged wall
looked easy to climb; but there were heart-breaking spaces between
those ledges&mdash;stretches of treacherous shale, and steep
pitches where clawing fingers and groping toes scarcely found a
grip.</p>

<p>One misstep, one handhold lost and the climber would have
pitched backward in a headlong, rolling fall three hundred feet to
the rocky canyon bed. But the man on the cliff was Francis Xavier
Gordon, and it was not his destiny to dash out his brains on the
floor of a Himalayan gorge.</p>

<p>He was reaching the end of his climb. The rim of the wall was
only a few feet above him, but the intervening space was the most
dangerous he had yet covered. He paused to shake the sweat from his
eyes, drew a deep breath through his nostrils, and once more
matched eye and muscle against the brute treachery of the gigantic
barrier. Faint yells welled up from below, vibrant with hate and
edged with blood lust. He did not look down. His upper lip lifted
in a silent snarl, as a panther might snarl at the sound of his
hunters' voices. That was all.</p>

<p>His fingers clawed at the stone until blood oozed from under his
broken nails. Rivulets of gravel started beneath his boots and
streamed down the ledges. He was almost there&mdash;but under his
toe a jutting stone began to give way. With an explosive expansion
of energy that brought a tortured gasp from him, he lunged upward,
just as his foothold tore from the soil that had held it. For one
sickening instant he felt eternity yawn beneath him&mdash; then his
upflung fingers hooked over the rim of the crest. For an instant he
hung there, suspended, while pebbles and stones went rattling down
the face of the cliff in a miniature avalanche. Then with a
powerful knotting and contracting of iron biceps, he lifted his
weight and an instant later climbed over the rim and stared
down.</p>

<p>He could make out nothing in the gorge below, beyond the glimpse
of a tangle of thickets. The jutting ledges obstructed the view
from above as well as from below. But he knew his pursuers were
ranging those thickets down there, the men whose knives were still
reeking with the blood of his friends. He heard their voices, edged
with the hysteria of murder, dwindling westward. They were
following a blind lead and a false trail.</p>

<p>Gordon stood up on the rim of the gigantic wall, the one atom of
visible life among monstrous pillars and abutments of stone; they
rose on all sides, dwarfing him, brown insensible giants
shouldering the sky. But Gordon gave no thought to the somber
magnificence of his surroundings, or of his own comparative
insignificance.</p>

<p>Scenery, however awesome, is but a background for the human
drama in its varying phases. Gordon's soul was a maelstrom of
wrath, and the distant, dwindling shout below him drove crimson
waves of murder surging through his brain. He drew from his boot
the long knife he had placed there when he began his desperate
climb. Half-dried blood stained the sharp steel, and the sight of
it gave him a fierce satisfaction. There were dead men back there
in the valley into which the gorge ran, and not all of them were
Gordon's Afridi friends. Some were Orakzai, the henchmen of the
traitor Afdal Khan&mdash;the treacherous dogs who had sat down in
seeming amity with Yusef Shah, the Afridi chief, his three headmen
and his American ally, and who had turned the friendly conference
suddenly into a holocaust of murder.</p>

<p>Gordon's shirt was in ribbons, revealing a shallow sword cut
across the thick muscles of his breast, from which blood oozed
slowly. His black hair was plastered with sweat, the scabbards at
his hips empty. He might have been a statue on the cliffs, he stood
so motionless, except for the steady rise and fall of his arching
chest as he breathed deep through expanded nostrils. In his black
eyes grew a flame like fire on deep black water. His body grew
rigid; muscles swelled in knotted cords on his arms, and the veins
of his temples stood out.</p>

<p>Treachery and murder! He was still bewildered, seeking a motive.
His actions until this moment had been largely instinctive,
reflexes responding to peril and the threat of destruction. The
episode had been so unexpected&mdash; so totally lacking in
apparent reason. One moment a hum of friendly conversation, men
sitting cross-legged about a fire while tea boiled and meat
roasted; the next instant knives sinking home, guns crashing, men
falling in the smoke&mdash;Afridi men; his friends, struck down
about him, with their rifles laid aside, their knives in their
scabbards.</p>

<p>Only his steel-trap coordination had saved him&mdash;that
instant, primitive reaction to danger that is not dependent upon
reason or any logical thought process. Even before his conscious
mind grasped what was happening, Gordon was on his feet with both
guns blazing. And then there was no time for consecutive thinking,
nothing but desperate hand-to-hand fighting, and flight on
foot&mdash;a long run and a hard climb. But for the thicket-choked
mouth of a narrow gorge they would have had him, in spite of
everything.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Now, temporarily safe, he could pause and apply reasoning to the
problem of why Afdal Khan, chief of the Khoruk Orakzai, plotted
thus foully to slay the four chiefs of his neighbors, the Afridis
of Kurram, and their <i>feringhi</i> friend. But no motive
presented itself. The massacre seemed utterly wanton and
reasonless. At the moment Gordon did not greatly care. It was
enough to know that his friends were dead, and to know who had
killed them.</p>

<p>Another tier of rock rose some yards behind him, broken by a
narrow, twisting cleft. Into this he moved. He did not expect to
meet an enemy; they would all be down there in the gorge, beating
up the thickets for him; but he carried the long knife in his hand,
just in case.</p>

<p>It was purely an instinctive gesture, like the unsheathing of a
panther's claws. His dark face was like iron; his black eyes burned
redly; as he strode along the narrow defile he was more dangerous
than any wounded panther. An urge painful in its intensity beat at
his brain like a hammer that would not ease; revenge! revenge!
revenge! All the depths of his being responded to the
reverberation. The thin veneer of civilization had been swept away
by a red tidal wave. Gordon had gone back a million years into the
red dawn of man's beginning; he was as starkly primitive as the
colossal stones that rose about him.</p>

<p>Ahead of him the defile twisted about a jutting shoulder to
come, as he knew, out upon a winding mountain path. That path would
lead him out of the country of his enemies, and he had no reason to
expect to meet any of them upon it. So it was a shocking surprise
to him when he rounded the granite shoulder and came face to face
with a tall man who lolled against a rock, with a pistol in his
hand.</p>

<p>That pistol was leveled at the American's breast. Gordon stood
motionless, a dozen feet separating the two men. Beyond the tall
man stood a finely caparisoned Kabuli stallion, tied to a
tamarisk.</p>

<p>"Ali Bahadur!" muttered Gordon, the red flame in his black
eyes.</p>

<p>"Aye!" Ali Bahadur was clad in Pathan elegance. His boots were
stitched with gilt thread, his turban was of rose-colored silk, and
his girdled <i>khalat</i> was gaudily striped. He was a handsome
man, with an aquiline face and dark, alert eyes, which just now
were lighted with cruel triumph. He laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>"I was not mistaken, El Borak. When you fled into the
thicket-choked mouth of the gorge, I did not follow you as the
others did. They ran headlong into the copse, on foot, bawling like
bulls. Not I. I did not think you would flee on down the gorge
until my men cornered you. I believed that as soon as you got out
of their sight you would climb the wall, though no man has ever
climbed it before. I knew you would climb out on this side, for not
even Shaitan the Damned could scale those sheer precipices on the
other side of the gorge.</p>

<p>"So I galloped back up the valley to where, a mile north of the
spot where we camped, another gorge opens and runs westward. This
path leads up out of that gorge and crosses the ridge and here
turns southwesterly&mdash;as I knew you knew. My steed is swift! I
knew this point was the only one at which you could reach this
trail, and when I arrived, there were no boot prints in the dust to
tell me you had reached it and passed on ahead of me. Nay, hardly
had I paused when I heard stones rattling down the cliff, so I
dismounted and awaited your coming! For only through that cleft
could you reach the path."</p>

<p>"You came alone," said Gordon, never taking his eyes from the
Orakzai. "You have more guts than I thought."</p>

<p>"I knew you had no guns," answered Ali Bahadur. "I saw you empty
them and throw them away and draw your knife as you fought your way
through my warriors. Courage? Any fool can have courage. I have
wits, which is better."</p>

<p>"You talk like a Persian," muttered Gordon. He was caught
fairly, his scabbards empty, his knife arm hanging at his side. He
knew Ali would shoot at the slightest motion.</p>

<p>"My brother Afdal Khan will praise me when I bring him your
head!" taunted the Orakzai. His Oriental vanity could not resist
making a grandiose gesture out of his triumph. Like many of his
race, swaggering dramatics were his weakness; if he had simply
hidden behind a rock and shot Gordon when he first appeared, Ali
Bahadur might be alive today.</p>

<p>"Why did Afdal Khan invite us to a feast and then murder my
friends?" Gordon demanded. "There has been peace between the clans
for years."</p>

<p>"My brother has ambitions," answered Ali Bahadur. "The Afridis
stood in his way, though they knew it not. Why should my brother
waste men in a long war to remove them? Only a fool gives warning
before he strikes."</p>

<p>"And only a dog turns traitor," retorted Gordon.</p>

<p>"The salt had not been eaten," reminded Ali. "The men of Kurram
were fools, and thou with them!" He was enjoying his triumph to the
utmost, prolonging the scene as greatly as he dared. He knew he
should have shot already.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>There was a tense readiness about Gordon's posture that made his
flesh crawl, and Gordon's eyes were red flame when the sun struck
them. But it glutted Ali's vanity deliriously to know that El
Borak, the grimmest fighter in all the North, was in his
power&mdash;held at pistol muzzle, poised on the brink of Jehannum
into which he would topple at the pressure of a finger on the
trigger. Ali Bahadur knew Gordon's deadly quickness, how he could
spring and kill in the flicker of an eyelid. But no human thews
could cross the intervening yards quicker than lead spitting from a
pistol muzzle. And at the first hint of movement, Ali would bring
the gratifying scene to a sudden close.</p>

<p>Gordon opened his mouth as if to speak, then closed it. The
suspicious Pathan was instantly tense. Gordon's eyes flickered past
him, then back instantly, and fixed on his face with an increased
intensity. To all appearances Gordon had seen something behind
Ali&mdash;something he did not wish Ali to see, and was doing all
in his power to conceal the fact that he had seen something, to
keep Ali from turning his head. And turn his head Ali did; he did
it involuntarily, in spite of himself. He had not completed the
motion before he sensed the trick and jerked his head back, firing
as he did so, even as he caught the blur that was the lightninglike
motion of Gordon's right arm.</p>

<p>Motion and shot were practically simultaneous. Ali went to his
knees as if struck by sudden paralysis, and flopped over on his
side. Gurgling and choking he struggled to his elbows, eyes
starting from his head, lips drawn back in a ghastly grin, his chin
held up by the hilt of Gordon's knife that jutted from his throat.
With a dying effort he lifted the pistol with both hands, trying to
cock it with fumbling thumbs. Then blood gushed from his blue lips
and the pistol slipped from his hands. His fingers clawed briefly
at the earth, then spread and stiffened, and his head sank down on
his extended arms.</p>

<p>Gordon had not moved from his tracks. Blood oozed slowly from a
round blue hole in his left shoulder. He did not seem to be aware
of the wound. Not until Ali Bahadur's brief, spasmodic twitchings
had ceased did he move. He snarled, the thick, blood-glutted snarl
of a jungle cat, and spat toward the prostrate Orakzai.</p>

<p>He made no move to recover the knife he had thrown with such
deadly force and aim, nor did he pick up the smoking pistol. He
strode to the stallion which snorted and trembled at the reek of
spilt blood, untied him and swung into the gilt-stitched
saddle.</p>

<p>As he reined away up the winding hill path he turned in the
saddle and shook his fist in the direction of his enemies&mdash;a
threat and a ferocious promise; the game had just begun; the first
blood had been shed in a feud that was to litter the hills with
charred villages and the bodies of dead men, and trouble the dreams
of kings and viceroys.</p>

<h2><a id="hawk2" name="hawk2">CHAPTER II</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">GEOFFREY WILLOUGHBY shifted himself in his saddle
and glanced at the gaunt ridges and bare stone crags that rose
about him, mentally comparing the members of his escort with the
features of the landscape.</p>

<p>Physical environment inescapably molded its inhabitants. With
one exception his companions were as sullen, hard, barbarous and
somber as the huge brown rocks that frowned about them. The one
exception was Suleiman, a Punjabi Moslem, ostensibly his servant,
actually a valuable member of the English secret service.</p>

<p>Willoughby himself was not a member of that service. His status
was unique; he was one of those ubiquitous Englishmen who steadily
build the empire, moving obscurely behind the scenes, and letting
other men take the credit&mdash;men in bemedaled uniforms, or
loud-voiced men with top hats and titles.</p>

<p>Few knew just what Willoughby's commission was, or what niche he
filled in the official structure; but the epitome of the man and
his career was once embodied in the request of a harried deputy
commissioner: "Hell on the border; send Willoughby!" Because of his
unadvertised activities, troops did not march and cannons did not
boom on more occasions than the general public ever realized. So it
was not really surprising&mdash;except to those die-hards who
refuse to believe that maintaining peace on the Afghan Border is
fundamentally different from keeping order in Trafalgar
Square&mdash;that Willoughby should be riding forth in the company
of hairy cutthroats to arbitrate a bloody hill feud at the request
of an Oriental despot.</p>

<p>Willoughby was of medium height and stockily, almost chubbily,
built, though there were unexpected muscles under his ruddy skin.
His hair was taffy- colored, his eyes blue, wide and deceptively
ingenuous. He wore civilian khakis and a huge sun helmet. If he was
armed the fact was not apparent. His frank, faintly freckled face
was not unpleasant, but it displayed little evidence of the
razor-sharp brain that worked behind it.</p>

<p>He jogged along as placidly as if he were ambling down a lane in
his native Suffolk, and he was more at ease than the ruffians who
accompanied him&mdash;four wild-looking, ragged tribesmen under the
command of a patriarch whose stately carriage and gray-shot pointed
beard did not conceal the innate savagery reflected in his
truculent visage. Baber Ali, uncle of Afdal Khan, was old, but his
back was straight as a trooper's, and his gaunt frame was wolfishly
hard. He was his nephew's right-hand man, possessing all Afdal
Khan's ferocity, but little of his subtlety and cunning.</p>

<p>They were following a trail that looped down a steep slope which
fell away for a thousand feet into a labyrinth of gorges. In a
valley a mile to the south, Willoughby sighted a huddle of charred
and blackened ruins.</p>

<p>"A village, Baber?" he asked.</p>

<p>Baber snarled like an old wolf.</p>

<p>"Aye! That was Khuttak! El Borak and his devils burned it and
slew every man able to bear arms."</p>

<p>Willoughby looked with new interest. It was such things as that
he had come to stop, and it was El Borak he was now riding to
see.</p>

<p>"El Borak is a son of Shaitan," growled old Baber. "Not a
village of Afdal Khan's remains unburned save only Khoruk itself.
And of the outlying towers, only my <i>sangar</i> remains, which
lies between this spot and Khoruk. Now he has seized the cavern
called Akbar's Castle, and that is in Orakzai territory. By Allah,
for an hour we have been riding in country claimed by us Orakzai,
but now it has become a no man's land, a border strewn with corpses
and burned villages, where no man's life is safe. At any moment we
may be fired upon."</p>

<p>"Gordon has given his word," reminded Willoughby.</p>

<p>"His word is not wind," admitted the old ruffian grudgingly.</p>

<p>They had dropped down from the heights and were traversing a
narrow plateau that broke into a series of gorges at the other end.
Willoughby thought of the letter in his pocket, which had come to
him by devious ways. He had memorized it, recognizing its dramatic
value as a historical document.</p>

<p class="letter">Geoffrey Willoughby,<br>
<br>
Ghazrael Fort:<br>
<br>
If you want to parley, come to Shaitan's Minaret, alone. Let your
escort stop outside the mouth of the gorge. They won't be molested,
but if any Orakzai follows you into the gorge, he'll be shot.<br>
<br>
Francis X. Gordon.</p>

<p>Concise and to the point. Parley, eh? The man had assumed the
role of a general carrying on a regular war, and left no doubt that
he considered Willoughby, not a disinterested arbiter, but a
diplomat working in the interests of the opposing side.</p>

<p>"We should be near the Gorge of the Minaret," said
Willoughby.</p>

<p>Baber Ali pointed. "There is its mouth."</p>

<p>"Await me here."</p>

<p>Suleiman dismounted and eased his steed's girths. The Pathans
climbed down uneasily, hugging their rifles and scanning the
escarpments. Somewhere down that winding gorge Gordon was lurking
with his vengeful warriors. The Orakzai were afraid. They were
miles from Khoruk, in the midst of a region that had become a
bloody debatable ground through slaughter on both sides. They
instinctively looked toward the southwest where, miles away, lay
the crag-built village of Kurram.</p>

<p>Baber twisted his beard and gnawed the corner of his lip. He
seemed devoured by an inward fire of anger and suspicion which
would not let him rest.</p>

<p>"You will go forward from this point alone, <i>sahib</i>?"</p>

<p>Willoughby nodded, gathering up his reins.</p>

<p>"He will kill you!"</p>

<p>"I think not."</p>

<p>Willoughby knew very well that Baber Ali would never have thus
placed himself within Gordon's reach unless he placed full
confidence in the American's promise of safety.</p>

<p>"Then make the dog agree to a truce!" snarled Baber, his savage
arrogance submerging his grudging civility. "By Allah, this feud is
a thorn in the side of Afdal Khan&mdash;and of me!"</p>

<p>"We'll see." Willoughby nudged his mount with his heels and
jogged on down the gorge, not an impressive figure at all as he
slumped carelessly in his saddle, his cork helmet bobbing with each
step of the horse. Behind him the Pathans watched eagerly until he
passed out of sight around a bend of the canyon.</p>

<p>Willoughby's tranquillity was partly, though not altogether,
assumed. He was not afraid, nor was he excited. But he would have
been more than human had not the anticipation of meeting El Borak
stirred his imagination to a certain extent and roused
speculations.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>The name of El Borak was woven in the tales told in all the
<i>caravanserais</i> and <i>bazaars</i> from Teheran to Bombay. For
three years rumors had drifted down the Khyber of intrigues and
grim battles fought among the lonely hills, where a hard-eyed white
man was hewing out a place of power among the wild tribesmen.</p>

<p>The British had not cared to interfere until this latest stone
cast by Gordon into the pool of Afghan politics threatened to
spread ripples that might lap at the doors of foreign palaces.
Hence Willoughby, jogging down the winding Gorge of the Minaret.
Queer sort of renegade, Willoughby reflected. Most white men who
went native were despised by the people among whom they cast their
lot. But even Gordon's enemies respected him, and it did not seem
to be on account of his celebrated fighting ability alone. Gordon,
Willoughby vaguely understood, had grown up on the southwestern
frontier of the United States, and had a formidable reputation as a
gun fanner before he ever drifted East.</p>

<p>Willoughby had covered a mile from the mouth of the gorge before
he rounded a bend in the rocky wall and saw the Minaret looming up
before him&mdash;a tall, tapering spirelike crag, detached, except
at the base, from the canyon wall. No one was in sight. Willoughby
tied his horse in the shade of the cliff and walked toward the base
of the Minaret where he halted and stood gently fanning himself
with his helmet, and idly wondering how many rifles were aimed at
him from vantage points invisible to himself. Abruptly Gordon was
before him.</p>

<p>It was a startling experience, even to a man whose nerves were
under as perfect control as Willoughby's. The Englishman indeed
stopped fanning himself and stood motionless, holding the helmet
lifted. There had been no sound, not even the crunch of rubble
under a boot heel to warn him. One instant the space before him was
empty, the next it was filled by a figure vibrant with dynamic
life. Boulders strewn at the foot of the wall offered plenty of
cover for a stealthy advance, but the miracle of that
advance&mdash;to Willoughby, who had never fought Yaqui Indians in
their own country&mdash;was the silence with which Gordon had
accomplished it.</p>

<p>"You're Willoughby, of course." The Southern accent was faint,
but unmistakable.</p>

<p>Willoughby nodded, absorbed in his scrutiny of the man before
him. Gordon was not a large man, but he was remarkably compact,
with a squareness of shoulders and a thickness of chest that
reflected unusual strength and vitality. Willoughby noted the black
butts of the heavy pistols jutting from his hips, the knife hilt
projecting from his right boot. He sought the hard bronzed face in
vain for marks of weakness or degeneracy. There was a gleam in the
black eyes such as Willoughby had never before seen in any man of
the so- called civilized races.</p>

<p>No, this man was no degenerate; his plunging into native feuds
and brawls indicated no retrogression. It was simply the response
of a primitive nature seeking its most natural environment.
Willoughby felt that the man before him must look exactly as an
untamed, precivilization Anglo-Saxon must have looked some ten
thousand years before.</p>

<p>"I'm Willoughby," he said. "Glad you found it convenient to meet
me. Shall we sit down in the shade?"</p>

<p>"No. There's no need of taking up that much time. Word came to
me that you were at Ghazrael, trying to get in touch with me. I
sent you my answer by a Tajik trader. You got it, or you wouldn't
be here. All right; here I am. Tell me what you've got to say and
I'll answer you."</p>

<p>Willoughby discarded the plan he had partly formulated. The sort
of diplomacy he'd had in mind wouldn't work here. This man was no
dull bully, with a dominance acquired by brute strength alone, nor
was he a self-seeking adventurer of the politician type, lying and
bluffing his way through. He could not be bought off, nor
frightened by a bluff. He was as real and vital and dangerous as a
panther, though Willoughby felt no personal fear.</p>

<p>"All right, Gordon," he answered candidly. "My say is soon said.
I'm here at the request of the Amir, and the <i>Raj</i>. I came to
Fort Ghazrael to try to get in touch with you, as you know. My
companion Suleiman helped. An escort of Orakzai met me at Ghazrael,
to conduct me to Khoruk, but when I got your letter I saw no reason
to go to Khoruk. They're waiting at the mouth of the gorge to
conduct me back to Ghazrael when my job's done. I've talked with
Afdal Khan only once, at Ghazrael. He's ready for peace. In fact it
was at his request that the Amir sent me out here to try to settle
this feud between you and him."</p>

<p>"It's none of the Amir's business," retorted Gordon. "Since when
did he begin interfering with tribal feuds?"</p>

<p>"In this case one of the parties appealed to him," answered
Willoughby. "Then the feud affects him personally. It's needless
for me to remind you that one of the main caravan roads from Persia
traverses this region, and since the feud began, the caravans avoid
it and turn up into Turkestan. The trade that ordinarily passes
through Kabul, by which the Amir acquires much rich revenue, is
being deflected out of his territory."</p>

<p>"And he's dickering with the Russians to get it back." Gordon
laughed mirthlessly. "He's tried to keep that secret, because
English guns are all that keep him on his throne. But the Russians
are offering him a lot of tempting bait, and he's playing with
fire&mdash;and the British are afraid he'll scorch his
fingers&mdash;and theirs!"</p>

<p>Willoughby blinked. Still, he might have known that Gordon would
know the inside of Afghan politics at least as well as himself.</p>

<p>"But Afdal Khan has expressed himself, both to the Amir and to
me, as desiring to end this feud," argued Willoughby. "He swears
he's been acting on the defensive all along. If you don't agree to
at least a truce the Amir will take a hand himself. As soon as I
return to Kabul and tell him you refuse to submit to arbitration,
he'll declare you an outlaw, and every ruffian in the hills will be
whetting his knife for your head. Be reasonable, man. Doubtless you
feel you had provocation for your attacks on Afdal Khan. But you've
done enough damage. Forget what's passed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget!"</p>

<p>Willoughby involuntarily stepped back as the pupils of Gordon's
eyes contracted like those of an angry leopard.</p>

<p>"Forget!" he repeated thickly. "You ask me to forget the blood
of my friends! You've heard only one side of this thing. Not that I
give a damn what you think, but you'll hear my side, for once.
Afdal Khan has friends at court. I haven't. I don't want any."</p>

<p>So a wild Highland chief might have cast his defiance in the
teeth of the king's emissary, thought Willoughby, fascinated by the
play of passion in the dark face before him.</p>

<p>"Afdal Khan invited my friends to a feast and cut them down in
cold blood&mdash;Yusef Shah, and this three chiefs&mdash;all sworn
friends of mine, do you understand? And you ask me to forget them,
as you might ask me to throw aside a worn-out scabbard! And why? So
the Amir can grab his taxes off the fat Persian traders; so the
Russians won't have a chance to inveigle him into some treaty the
British wouldn't approve of; so the English can keep their claws
sunk in on this side of the border, too!</p>

<p>"Well, here's my answer: You and the Amir and the <i>Raj</i> can
all go to hell together. Go back to Amir and tell him to put a
price on my head. Let him send his Uzbek guards to help the
Orakzai&mdash;and as many Russians and Britishers and whatever else
he's able to get. This feud will end when I kill Afdal Khan. Not
before."</p>

<p>"You're sacrificing the welfare of the many to avenge the blood
of the few," protested Willoughby.</p>

<p>"Who says I am? Afdal Khan? He's the Amir's worst enemy, if the
Amir only knew it, getting him embroiled in a war that's none of
his business. In another month I'll have Afdal Khan's head, and the
caravans will pass freely over this road again. If Afdal Khan
should win&mdash;Why did this feud begin in the first place? I'll
tell you! Afdal wants full control of the wells in this region,
wells which command the caravan route, and which have been in the
hands of the Afridis for centuries. Let him get possession of them
and he'll fleece the merchants before they ever get to Kabul. Yes,
and turn the trade permanently into Russian territory."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't dare&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He dares anything. He's got backing you don't even guess. Ask
him how it is that his men are all armed with Russian rifles! Hell!
Afdal's howling for help because I've taken Akbar's Castle and he
can't dislodge me. He asked you to make me agree to give up the
Castle, didn't he? Yes, I thought so. And if I were fool enough to
do it, he'd ambush me and my men as we marched back to Kurram.
You'd hardly have time to get back to Kabul before a rider would be
at your heels to tell the Amir how I'd treacherously attacked Afdal
Khan and been killed in self-defense, and how Afdal had been forced
to attack and burn Kurram! He's trying to gain by outside
intervention what he's lost in battle, and to catch me off my guard
and murder me as he did Yusef Shah. He's making monkeys out of the
Amir and you. And you want me to let him make a monkey out of
me&mdash;and a corpse too&mdash;just because a little dirty trade
is being deflected from Kabul!"</p>

<p>"You needn't feel so hostile to the British&mdash;" Willoughby
began.</p>

<p>"I don't; nor to the Persians, nor the Russians, either. I just
want all hands to attend to their own business and leave mine
alone."</p>

<p>"But this blood-feud madness isn't the proper thing for a white
man," pleaded Willoughby. "You're not an Afghan. You're an
Englishman, by descent, at least&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm Highland Scotch and black Irish by descent," grunted
Gordon. "That's got nothing to do with it. I've had my say. Go back
and tell the Amir the feud will end&mdash;when I've killed Afdal
Khan."</p>

<p>And turning on his heel he vanished as noiselessly as he had
appeared.</p>

<p>Willoughby started after him helplessly. Damn it all, he'd
handled this matter like an amateur! Reviewing his arguments he
felt like kicking himself; but any arguments seemed puerile against
the primitive determination of El Borak. Debating with him was like
arguing with a wind, or a flood, or a forest fire, or some other
elemental fact. The man didn't fit into any ordered classification;
he was as untamed as any barbarian who trod the Himalayas, yet
there was nothing rudimentary or underdeveloped about his
mentality.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Well, there was nothing to do at present but return to Fort
Ghazrael and send a rider to Kabul, reporting failure. But the game
was not played out. Willoughby's own stubborn determination was
roused. The affair began to take on a personal aspect utterly
lacking in most of his campaigns; he began to look upon it not only
as a diplomatic problem, but also as a contest of wits between
Gordon and himself. As he mounted his horse and headed back up the
gorge, he swore he would terminate that feud, and that it would be
terminated his way, and not Gordon's.</p>

<p>There was probably much truth in Gordon's assertions. Of course,
he and the Amir had heard only Afdal Khan's side of the matter; and
of course, Afdal Khan was a rogue. But he could not believe that
the chief's ambitions were as sweeping and sinister as Gordon
maintained. He could not believe they embraced more than a seizing
of local power in this isolated hill district. Petty exactions on
the caravans, now levied by the Afridis; that was all.</p>

<p>Anyway, Gordon had no business allowing his private wishes to
interfere with official aims, which, faulty as they might be,
nevertheless had the welfare of the people in view. Willoughby
would never have let his personal feelings stand in the way of
policy, and he considered that to do so was reprehensible in
others. It was Gordon's duty to forget the murder of his
friends&mdash;again Willoughby experienced that sensation of
helplessness. Gordon would never do that. To expect him to violate
his instinct was as sensible as expecting a hungry wolf to turn
away from raw meat.</p>

<p>Willoughby had returned up the gorge as leisurely as he had
ridden down it. Now he emerged from the mouth and saw Suleiman and
the Pathans standing in a tense group, staring eagerly at him.
Baber Ali's eyes burned like a wolf's. Willoughby felt a slight
shock of surprise as he met the fierce intensity of the old chief's
eyes. Why should Baber so savagely desire the success of his
emissary? The Orakzai had been getting the worst of the war, but
they were not whipped, by any means. Was there, after all,
something behind the visible surface&mdash;some deep-laid obscure
element or plot that involved Willoughby's mission? Was there truth
in Gordon's accusations of foreign entanglements and veiled
motives?</p>

<p>Babar took three steps forward, and his beard quivered with his
eagerness.</p>

<p>"Well?" His voice was harsh as the rasp of a sword against its
scabbard. "Will the dog make peace?"</p>

<p>Willoughby shook his head. "He swears the feud will end only
when he has slain Afdal Khan."</p>

<p>"Thou hast failed!"</p>

<p>The passion in Baber's voice startled Willoughby. For an instant
he thought the chief would draw his long knife and leap upon him.
Then Baber Ali deliberately turned his back on the Englishman and
strode to his horse. Freeing it with a savage jerk he swung into
the saddle and galloped away without a backward glance. And he did
not take the trail Willoughby must follow on his return to Fort
Ghazrael; he rode north, in the direction of Khoruk. The
implication was unmistakable; he was abandoning Willoughby to his
own resources, repudiating all responsibility for him.</p>

<p>Suleiman bent his head as he fumbled at his mount's girths, to
hide the tinge of gray that crept under his brown skin. Willoughby
turned from staring after the departing chief, to see the eyes of
the four tribesmen fixed unwinkingly upon him&mdash;hard, murky
eyes from under shocks of tangled hair.</p>

<p>He felt a slight chill crawl down his spine. These men were
savages, hardly above the mental level of wild beasts. They would
act unthinkingly, blindly following the instincts implanted in them
and their kind throughout long centuries of merciless Himalayan
existence. Their instincts were to murder and plunder all men not
of their own clan. He was an alien. The protection spread over him
and his companion by their chief had been removed.</p>

<p>By turning his back and riding away as he had, Baber Ali had
tacitly given permission for the <i>feringhi</i> to be slain. Baber
Ali was himself far more of a savage than was Afdal Khan; he was
governed by his untamed emotions, and prone to do childish and
horrible things in moments of passion. Infuriated by Willoughby's
failure to bring about a truce, it was characteristic of him to
vent his rage and disappointment on the Englishman.</p>

<p>Willoughby calmly reviewed the situation in the time he took to
gather up his reins. He could never get back to Ghazrael without an
escort. If he and Suleiman tried to ride away from these ruffians,
they would undoubtedly be shot in the back. There was nothing else
to do but try and bluff it out. They had been given their orders to
escort him to the Gorge of the Minaret and back again to Fort
Ghazrael. Those orders had not been revoked in actual words. The
tribesmen might hesitate to act on their own initiative, without
positive orders.</p>

<p>He glanced at the low-hanging sun, nudged his horse.</p>

<p>"Let's be on our way. We have far to ride."</p>

<p>He pushed straight at the cluster of men who divided sullenly to
let him through. Suleiman followed him. Neither looked to right nor
left, nor showed by any sign that they expected the men to do other
than follow them. Silently the Pathans swung upon their horses and
trailed after them, rifle butts resting on thighs, muzzles pointing
upward.</p>

<p>Willoughby slouched in his saddle, jogging easily along. He did
not look back, but he felt four pairs of beady eyes fixed on his
broad back in sullen indecision. His matter-of-fact manner baffled
them, exerted a certain dominance over their slow minds. But he
knew that if either he or Suleiman showed the slightest sign of
fear or doubt, they would be shot down instantly. He whistled
tunelessly between his teeth, whimsically feeling as if he were
riding along the edge of a volcano which might erupt at any
instant.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>They pushed eastward, following trails that wandered down into
valleys and up over rugged slants. The sun dipped behind a
thousand-foot ridge and the valleys were filled with purple
shadows. They reached the spot where, as they passed it earlier in
the day, Baber Ali had indicated that they would camp that night.
There was a well there. The Pathans drew rein without orders from
Willoughby. He would rather have pushed on, but to argue would have
roused suspicions of fear on his part.</p>

<p>The well stood near a cliff, on a broad shelf flanked by steep
slopes and ravine-cut walls. The horses were unsaddled, and
Suleiman spread Willoughby's blanket rolls at the foot of the wall.
The Pathans, stealthy and silent as wild things, began gathering
dead tamarisk for a fire. Willoughby sat down on a rock near a
cleft in the wall, and began tracing a likeness of Gordon in a
small notebook, straining his eyes in the last of the twilight. He
had a knack in that line, and the habit had proved valuable in the
past, in the matter of uncovering disguises and identifying wanted
men.</p>

<p>He believed that his calm acceptance of obedience as a matter of
course had reduced the Pathans to a state of uncertainty, if not
actual awe. As long as they were uncertain, they would not attack
him.</p>

<p>The men moved about the small camp, performing various duties.
Suleiman bent over the tiny fire, and on the other side of it a
Pathan was unpacking a bundle of food. Another tribesman approached
the fire from behind the Punjabi, bringing more wood.</p>

<p>Some instinct caused Willoughby to look up, just as the Pathan
with the arm load of wood came up behind Suleiman. The Punjabi had
not heard the man's approach; he did not look around. His first
intimation that there was any one behind him was when the tribesman
drew a knife and sank it between his shoulders.</p>

<p>It was done too quickly for Willoughby to shout a warning. He
caught the glint of the firelight on the blade as it was driven
into Suleiman's back. The Punjabi cried out and fell to his knees,
and the man on the other side of the fire snatched a flint-lock
pistol from among his rags and shot him through the body. Suleiman
drew his revolver and fired once, and the tribesman fell into the
fire, shot through the head. Suleiman slipped down in a pool of his
own blood, and lay still.</p>

<p>It all happened while Willoughby was springing to his feet. He
was unarmed. He stood frozen for an instant, helpless. One of the
men picked up a rifle and fired at him point-blank. He heard the
bullet smash on a rock behind him. Stung out of his paralysis he
turned and sprang into the cleft of the wall. An instant later he
was running as fleetly down the narrow gap as his build would
allow, his heels winged by the wild howls of triumph behind
him.</p>

<p>Willoughby would have cursed himself as he ran, could he have
spared the breath. The sudden attack had been brutish, blundering,
without plan or premeditation. The tribesman had unexpectedly found
himself behind Suleiman and had reacted to his natural instincts.
Willoughby realized that if he had had a revolver he could probably
have defeated the attack, at least upon his own life. He had never
needed one before; had always believed diplomacy a better weapon
than a firearm. But twice today diplomacy had failed miserably. All
the faults and weaknesses of his system seemed to be coming to
light at once. He had made a pretty hash of this business from the
start.</p>

<p>But he had an idea that he would soon be beyond self-censure or
official blame. Those bloodthirsty yells, drawing nearer behind
him, assured him of that.</p>

<p>Suddenly Willoughby was afraid, horribly afraid. His tongue
seemed frozen to his palate and a clammy sweat beaded his skin. He
ran on down the dark defile like a man running in a nightmare, his
ears straining for the expected sound of sandaled feet pattering
behind him, the skin between his shoulders crawling in expectation
of a plunging knife. It was dark. He caromed into boulders, tripped
over loose stones, tearing the skin of his hands on the shale.</p>

<p>Abruptly he was out of the defile, and a knife-edge ridge loomed
ahead of him like the steep roof of a house, black against the
blue-black star-dotted sky. He struggled up it, his breath coming
in racking gasps. He knew they were close behind him, although he
could see nothing in the dark.</p>

<p>But keen eyes saw his dim bulk outlined against the stars when
he crawled over the crest. Tongues of red flame licked in the
darkness below him; reports banged flatly against the rocky walls.
Frantically he hauled himself over and rolled down the slope on the
other side. But not all the way. Almost immediately he brought up
against something hard yet yielding. Vaguely, half blind from sweat
and exhaustion, he saw a figure looming over him, some object
lifted in menace outlined against the stars. He threw up an arm but
it did not check the swinging rifle stock. Fire burst in glittering
sparks about him, and he did not hear the crackling of the rifles
that ran along the crest of the ridge.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="hawk3" name="hawk3">CHAPTER III</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was the smashing reverberation of gunfire,
reechoing between narrow walls, which first impressed itself on
Willoughby's sluggish reviving consciousness. Then he was aware of
his throbbing head. Lifting a hand to it, he discovered it had been
efficiently bandaged. He was lying on what felt like a sheepskin
coat, and he felt bare, cold rock under it. He struggled to his
elbows and shook his head violently, setting his teeth against the
shooting pain that resulted.</p>

<p>He lay in darkness, yet, some yards away, a white curtain
shimmered dazzlingly before him. He swore and batted his eyes, and
as his blurred sight cleared, things about him assumed their proper
aspect. He was in a cave, and that white curtain was the mouth,
with moonlight streaming across it. He started to rise and a rough
hand grabbed him and jerked him down again, just as a rifle cracked
somewhere outside and a bullet whined into the cave and smacked
viciously on the stone wall.</p>

<p>"Keep down, <i>sahib</i>!" growled a voice in <i>Pashtu</i>. The
Englishman was aware of men in the cave with him. Their eyes shone
in the dark as they turned their heads toward him.</p>

<p>His groggy brain was functioning now, and he could understand
what he saw. The cave was not a large one, and it opened upon a
narrow plateau, bathed in vivid moonlight and flanked by rugged
slopes. For about a hundred yards before the cave mouth the plain
lay level and almost bare of rocks, but beyond that it was strewn
with boulders and cut by gullies. And from those boulders and
ravines white puffs bloomed from time to time, accompanied by sharp
reports. Lead smacked and spattered about the entrance and whined
venomously into the cavern. Somewhere a man was breathing in
panting gasps that told Willoughby he was badly wounded. The moon
hung at such an angle that it drove a white bar down the middle of
the cave for some fifteen feet; and death lurked in that narrow
strip, for the men in the cave.</p>

<p>They lay close to the walls on either side, hidden from the view
of the besiegers and partially sheltered by broken rocks. They were
not returning the fire. They lay still, hugging their rifles, the
whites of their eyes gleaming in the darkness as they turned their
heads from time to time.</p>

<p>Willoughby was about to speak, when on the plain outside a
<i>kalpak</i> was poked cautiously around one end of a boulder.
There was no response from the cave. The defenders knew that in all
probability that sheepskin cap was stuck on a gun muzzle instead of
a human head.</p>

<p>"Do you see the dog, <i>sahib</i>?" whispered a voice in the
gloom, and Willoughby started as the answer came. For though it was
framed in almost accentless <i>Pashtu</i>, it was the voice of a
white man&mdash;the unmistakable voice of Francis Xavier
Gordon.</p>

<p>"I see him. He's peeking around the other end of that
boulder&mdash;trying to get a better shot at us, while his mate
distracts our attention with that hat. See? Close to the ground,
there&mdash;just about a hand's breadth of his head. Ready? All
right&mdash;now!"</p>

<p>Six rifles cracked in a stuttering detonation, and instantly, a
white- clad figure rolled from behind the boulder, flopped
convulsively and lay still, a sprawl of twisted limbs in the
moonlight. That, considered Willoughby, was damned good shooting,
if no more than one of the six bullets hit the exposed head. The
men in the cave had phosphorus rubbed in their sights, and they
were not wasting ammunition.</p>

<p>The success of the fusillade was answered by a chorus of
wrathful yells from outside, and a storm of lead burst against the
cave. Plenty of it found its way inside, and hot metal splashing
from a glancing slug stung Willoughby's arm through the sleeve. But
the marksmen were aiming too high to do any damage, unwilling as
they were to expose themselves to the fire from the cavern.
Gordon's men were grimly silent; they neither wasted lead on unseen
enemies, nor indulged in the jeers and taunts so dear to the Afghan
fighting man.</p>

<p>When the storm subsided to a period of vengeful waiting,
Willoughby called in a low voice: "Gordon! Oh, I say there,
Gordon!"</p>

<p>An instant later a dim form crawled to his side.</p>

<p>"Coming to at last, Willoughby? Here, take a swig of this."</p>

<p>A whiskey flask was pressed into his hand.</p>

<p>"No, thanks, old chap. I think you have a man who needs it worse
than I." Even as he spoke he was aware that he no longer heard the
stertorous breathing of the wounded man.</p>

<p>"That was Ahmed Khan," said Gordon. "He's gone; died while they
were shooting in here a moment ago. Shot through the body as we
were making for this cave."</p>

<p>"That's the Orakzai out there?" asked Willoughby.</p>

<p>"Who else?"</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>The throbbing in his head irritated the Englishman; his right
forearm was painfully bruised, and he was thirsty.</p>

<p>"Let me get this straight, Gordon&mdash;am I a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"That depends on the way you look at it. Just now we're all
hemmed up in this cave. Sorry about your broken head. But the
fellow who hit you didn't know but what you were an Orakzai. It was
dark."</p>

<p>"What the devil happened, anyway?" demanded Willoughby. "I
remember them killing Suleiman, and chasing me&mdash;then I got
that clout on the head and went out. I must have been unconscious
for hours."</p>

<p>"You were. Six of my men trailed you all the way from the mouth
of the Gorge of the Minaret. I didn't trust Baber Ali, though it
didn't occur to me that he'd try to kill you. I was well on my way
back to Akbar's Castle when one of the men caught up with me and
told me that Baber Ali had ridden off in the direction of his
<i>sangar</i> and left you with his four tribesmen. I believed they
intended murdering you on the road to Ghazrael, and laying it onto
me. So I started after you myself.</p>

<p>"When you pitched camp by Jehungir's Well my men were watching
from a distance, and I wasn't far away, riding hard to catch up
with you before your escort killed you. Naturally I wasn't
following the open trail you followed. I was coming up from the
south. My men saw the Orakzai kill Suleiman, but they weren't close
enough to do anything about it.</p>

<p>"When you ran into the defile with the Orakzai pelting after
you, my men lost sight of you all in the darkness and were trying
to locate you when you bumped into them. Khoda Khan knocked you
stiff before he recognized you. They fired on the three men who
were chasing you, and those fellows took to their heels. I heard
the firing, and so did somebody else; we arrived on the scene just
about the same time."</p>

<p>"Eh? What's that? Who?"</p>

<p>"Your friend, Baber Ali, with thirty horsemen! We slung you on a
horse, and it was a running fight until moonrise. We were trying to
get back to Akbar's Castle, but they had fresher horses and they
ran us down. They got us hemmed out there on that plain and the
only thing we could do was to duck in here and make our stand. So
here we are, and out there he is, with thirty men&mdash;not
including the three ruffians who killed your servant. He shot them
in their tracks. I heard the shots and their death howls as we rode
for the hills."</p>

<p>"I guess the old villain repented of his temper," said
Willoughby. "What a cursed pity he didn't arrive a few minutes
earlier. It would have saved Suleiman, poor devil. Thanks for
pulling me out of a nasty mess, old fellow. And now, if you don't
mind, I'll be going."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Why, out there! To Ghazrael. First to Baber Ali, naturally.
I've got a few things to tell that old devil."</p>

<p>"Willoughby, are you a fool?" Gordon demanded harshly.</p>

<p>"To think you'd let me go? Well, perhaps I am. I'd forgotten
that as soon as I return to Kabul, you'll be declared an outlaw,
won't you? But you can't keep me here forever, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't intend to try," answered Gordon with a hint of anger.
"If your skull wasn't already cracked I'd feel inclined to bash
your head for accusing me of imprisoning you. Shake the cobwebs out
of your brain. If you're an example of a British diplomat, Heaven
help the empire!</p>

<p>"Don't you know you'd instantly be filled with lead if you
stepped out there? Don't you know that Baber Ali wants your head
right now more than he does mine?</p>

<p>"Why do you think he hasn't sent a man riding a horse to death
to tell Afdal Khan he's got El Borak trapped in a cave miles from
Akbar's Castle? I'll tell you: Baber Ali doesn't want Afdal to know
what a mess he's made of things.</p>

<p>"It was characteristic of the old devil to ride off and leave
you to be murdered by his ruffians; but when he cooled off a
little, he realized that he'd be held responsible. He must have
gotten clear to his <i>sangar</i> before he realized that. Then he
took a band of horsemen and came pelting after you to save you, in
the interest of his own skin, of course, but he got there too late
&mdash;too late to keep them from killing Suleiman, and too late to
kill you."</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look at it from his viewpoint, man! If he'd gotten there in
time to keep anyone from being killed, it would have been all
right. But with Suleiman killed by his men, he dares not leave you
alive. He knows the English will hold him responsible for
Suleiman's death, if they learn the true circumstances. And he
knows what it means to murder a British subject&mdash;especially
one as important in the secret service as I happen to know Suleiman
was. But if he could put you out of the way, he could swear I
killed you and Suleiman. Those men out there are all Baber's
personal following&mdash;hard-bitten old wolves who'll cut any
throat and swear any lie he orders. If you go back to Kabul and
tell your story, Baber will be in bad with the Amir, the British,
and Afdal Khan. So he's determined to shut your mouth, for good and
all."</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Willoughby was silent for a moment; presently he said frankly:
"Gordon, if I didn't have such a high respect for your wits, I'd
believe you. It all sounds reasonable and logical. But damn it,
man, I don't know whether I'm recognizing logic or simply being
twisted up in a web of clever lies. You're too dangerously subtle,
Gordon, for me to allow myself to believe anything you say, without
proof."</p>

<p>"Proof?" retorted Gordon grimly, "Listen!"</p>

<p>Wriggling toward the cave mouth he took shelter behind a broken
rock and shouted in <i>Pashtu</i>. "Ohai, Baber Ali!"</p>

<p>The scattered firing ceased instantly, and the moonlit night
seemed to hold its breath. Baber Ali's voice came back, edged with
suspicion.</p>

<p>"Speak, El Borak! I hearken."</p>

<p>"If I gave you the Englishmen will you let me and my men go in
peace?" Gordon called.</p>

<p>"Aye, by the beard of Allah!" came the eager answer.</p>

<p>"But I fear he will return to Kabul and poison the Amir against
me!"</p>

<p>"Then kill him and throw his head out," answered Baber Ali with
an oath. "By Allah, it is no more than I will do for him, the
prying dog!"</p>

<p>In the cave Willoughby murmured: "I apologize, Gordon!"</p>

<p>"Well?" The old Pathan was growing impatient. "Are you playing
with me, El Borak? Give me the Englishman!"</p>

<p>"Nay, Baber Ali, I dare not trust your promise," replied
Gordon.</p>

<p>A bloodthirsty yell and a burst of frenzied firing marked the
conclusion of the brief parley, and Gordon hugged the shelter of
the shattered boulders until the spasm subsided. Then he crawled
back to Willoughby.</p>

<p>"You see?"</p>

<p>"I see! It looks like I'm in this thing to the hilt with you!
But why Baber Ali should have been so enraged because I failed to
arrange a truce&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He and Afdal intended taking advantage of any truce you
arranged, to trap me, just as I warned you. They were using you as
a cat's-paw. They know they're licked, unless they resort to
something of the sort."</p>

<p>There followed a period of silence, in which Willoughby was
moved to inquire: "What now? Are we to stay here until they starve
us out? The moon will set before many hours. They'll rush us in the
dark."</p>

<p>"I never walk into a trap I can't get out of," answered Gordon.
"I'm just waiting for the moon to dip behind that crag and get its
light out of the cave. There's an exit I don't believe the Orakzai
know about. Just a narrow crack at the back of the cave. I enlarged
it with a hunting knife and rifle barrel before you recovered
consciousness. It's big enough for a man to slip through now. It
leads out onto a ledge fifty feet above a ravine. Some of the
Orakzai may be down there watching the ledge, but I doubt it. From
the plain out there it would be a long, hard climb around to the
back of the mountain. We'll go down on a rope made of turbans and
belts, and head for Akbar's Castle. We'll have to go on foot. It's
only a few miles away, but the way we'll have to go is over the
mountains, and a devil's own climb."</p>

<p>Slowly the moon moved behind the crag, and the silver sword no
longer glimmered along the rocky floor. The men in the cavern could
move about without being seen by the men outside, who waited the
setting of the moon with the grim patience of gray wolves.</p>

<p>"All right, let's go," muttered Gordon. "Khoda Khan, lead the
way. I'll follow when you're all through the cleft. If anything
happens to me, take the <i>sahib</i> to Akbar's Castle. Go over the
ridges; there may be ambushes already planted in the valleys."</p>

<p>"Give me a gun," requested Willoughby. The rifle of the dead
Ahmed Khan was pressed into his hand. He followed the shadowy,
all-but-invisible file of Afridis as they glided into the deeper
darkness in the recesses of the tunnel- like cavern. Their sandals
made no noise on the rocky floor, but the crunch of his boots
seemed loud to the Englishman. Behind them Gordon lay near the
entrance, and once he fired a shot at the boulders on the
plain.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Within fifty feet the cavern floor began to narrow and pitch
upward. Above them a star shone in utter blackness, marking the
crevice in the rock. It seemed to Willoughby that they mounted the
slanting incline for a long way; the firing outside sounded
muffled, and the patch of moonlight that was the cave mouth looked
small with distance. The pitch became steeper, mounting up until
the taller of the Afridis bent their heads to avoid the rocky roof.
An instant later they reached the wall that marked the end of the
cavern and glimpsed the sky through the narrow slit.</p>

<p>One by one they squeezed through, Willoughby last. He came out
on the ledge in the starlight that overhung a ravine which was a
mass of black shadows. Above them the great black crags loomed,
shutting off the moonlight; everything on that side of the mountain
was in shadow.</p>

<p>His companions clustered at the rim of the shelf as they swiftly
and deftly knotted together girdles and unwound turbans to make a
rope. One end was tossed over the ledge and man after man went down
swiftly and silently, vanishing into the black ravine below.
Willoughby helped a stalwart tribesman called Muhammad hold the
rope as Khoda Khan went down. Before he went, Khoda Khan thrust his
head back through the cleft and whistled softly, a signal to carry
only to El Borak's alert ears.</p>

<p>Khoda Khan vanished into the darkness below, and Muhammad
signified that he could hold the rope alone while Willoughby
descended. Behind them an occasional muffled shot seemed to
indicate that the Orakzai were yet unaware that their prey was
escaping them.</p>

<p>Willoughby let himself over the ledge, hooked a leg about the
rope and went down, considerably slower and more cautiously than
the men who had preceded him. Above him the huge Afridi braced his
legs and held the rope as firmly as though it were bound to a
tree.</p>

<p>Willoughby was halfway down when he heard a murmur of voices on
the ledge above which indicated that Gordon had come out of the
cave and joined Muhammad. The Englishman looked down and made out
the dim figures of the others standing below him on the ravine
floor. His feet were a yard above the earth when a rifle cracked in
the shadows and a red tongue of flame spat upward. An explosive
grunt sounded above him and the rope went slack in his hands. He
hit the ground, lost his footing and fell headlong, rolling aside
as Muhammad came tumbling down. The giant struck the earth with a
thud, wrapped about with the rope he had carried with him in his
fall. He never moved after he landed.</p>

<p>Willoughby struggled up, breathless, as his companions charged
past him. Knives were flickering in the shadows, dim figures
reeling in locked combat. So the Orakzai had known of this possible
exit! Men were fighting all around him. Gordon sprang to the rim of
the ledge and fired downward without apparent aim, but a man
grunted and fell, his rifle striking against Willoughby's boot. A
dim, bearded face loomed out of the darkness, snarling like a
ghoul. Willoughby caught a swinging tulwar on his rifle barrel,
wincing at the jolt that ran through his fingers, and fired full
into the beared face.</p>

<p>"El Borak!" howled Khoda Khan, hacking and slashing at something
that snarled and gasped like a wild beast.</p>

<p>"Take the <i>sahib</i> and go!" yelled Gordon.</p>

<p>Willoughby realized that the fall of Muhammad with the rope had
trapped Gordon on the ledge fifty feet above them.</p>

<p>"Nay!" shrieked Khoda Khan. "We will cast the rope up to
thee&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go, blast you!" roared Gordon. "The whole horde will be on your
necks any minute! Go!"</p>

<p>The next instant Willoughby was seized under each arm and
hustled at a stumbling run down the dark gorge. Men panted on each
side of him, and the dripping tulwars in their hands smeared his
breeches. He had a vague glimpse of three figures sprawling at the
foot of the cliff, one horribly mangled. No one barred their path
as they fled; Gordon's Afridis were obeying his command; but they
had left their leader behind, and they sobbed curses through their
teeth as they ran.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="hawk4" name="hawk4">CHAPTER IV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">GORDON wasted no time. He knew he could not escape
from the ledge without a rope, by climbing either up or down, and
he did not believe his enemies could reach the ledge from the
ravine. He squirmed back through the cleft and ran down the slant
of the cavern, expecting any instant to see his besiegers pouring
into the moonlit mouth. But it stood empty, and the rifles outside
kept up their irregular monotone. Obviously, Baber Ali did not
realize that his victims had attempted an escape by the rear. The
muffled shots he must surely have heard had imparted no meaning to
him, or perhaps he considered they but constituted some trickery of
El Borak's. Knowledge that an opponent is full of dangerous ruses
is often a handicap, instilling an undue amount of caution.</p>

<p>Anyway, Baber Ali had neither rushed the cavern nor sent any
appreciable number of men to reinforce the lurkers on the other
side of the mountain, for the volume of his firing was
undiminished. That meant he did not know of the presence of his men
behind the cave. Gordon was inclined to believe that what he had
taken for a strategically placed force had been merely a few
restless individuals skulking along the ravine, scouting on their
own initiative. He had actually seen only three men, had merely
assumed the presence of others. The attack, too, had been ill-timed
and poorly executed. It had neither trapped them all on the ledge
nor in the ravine. The shot that killed Muhammad had doubtless been
aimed at himself.</p>

<p>Gordon admitted his mistake; confused in the darkness as to the
true state of things, he had ordered instant flight when his
companions might safely have lingered long enough to tie a stone to
the end of the rope and cast it back up to him. He was neatly
trapped and it was largely his own fault.</p>

<p>But he had one advantage: Baber did not know he was alone in the
cavern. And there was every reason to believe that Willoughby would
reach Akbar's Castle unpursued. He fired a shot into the plain and
settled himself comfortably behind the rocks near the cave mouth,
his rifle at his shoulder.</p>

<p>The moonlit plateau showed no evidence of the attackers beyond
the puffs of grayish-white smoke that bloomed in woolly whorls from
behind the boulders. But there was a tense expectancy in the very
air. The moon was visible below the overhanging crag; it rested a
red, bent horn on the solid black mass of a mountain wall. In a few
moments the plain would be plunged in darkness and then it was
inevitable that Baber would rush the cavern.</p>

<p>Yet Baber would know that in the darkness following the setting
of the moon the captives might be expected to make a break for
liberty. It was certain that he already had a wide cordon spread
across the plain, and the line would converge quickly on the cave
mouth. The longer Gordon waited after moonset, the harder it would
be to slip through the closing semicircle.</p>

<p>He began wrenching bullets out of cartridges with his fingers
and teeth and emptying the powder into his rifle barrel, even while
he studied the terrain by the last light of the sinking moon. The
plateau was roughly fan- shaped, widening rapidly from the
cliff-flanked wall in which opened the cave mouth. Perhaps a
quarter of a mile across the plain showed the dark mouth of a
gorge, in which he knew were tethered the horses of the Orakzai.
Probably at least one man was guarding them.</p>

<p>The plain ran level and bare for nearly a hundred yards before
the cavern mouth, but some fifty feet away, on the right, there was
a deep narrow gully which began abruptly in the midst of the plain
and meandered away toward the right-hand cliffs. No shot had been
fired from this ravine. If an Orakzai was hidden there he had gone
into it while Gordon and his men were at the back of the cavern. It
had been too close to the cave for the besiegers to reach it under
the guns of the defenders.</p>

<p>As soon as the moon set Gordon intended to emerge and try to
work his way across the plain, avoiding the Orakzai as they rushed
toward the cave. It would be touch and go, the success depending on
accurate timing and a good bit of luck. But there was no other
alternative. He would have a chance, once he got among the rocks
and gullies. His biggest risk would be that of getting shot as he
ran from the cavern, with thirty rifles trained upon the black
mouth. And he was providing against that when he filled his rifle
barrel to the muzzle with loose powder from the broken cartridges
and plugged the muzzle solidly with a huge misshapen slug he found
on the cave floor.</p>

<p>He knew as soon as the moon vanished they would come wriggling
like snakes from every direction, to cover the last few yards in a
desperate rush&mdash;they would not fire until they could empty
their guns point-blank into the cavern and storm in after their
volley with naked steel. But thirty pairs of keen eyes would be
fixed on the entrance and a volley would meet any shadowy figure
seen darting from it.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>The moon sank, plunging the plateau into darkness, relieved but
little by the dim light of the stars. Out on the plateau Gordon
heard sounds that only razor-keen ears could have caught, much less
translated: the scruff of leather on stone, the faint clink of
steel, the rattle of a pebble underfoot.</p>

<p>Rising in the black cave mouth he cocked his rifle, and poising
himself for an instant, hurled it, butt first, as far to the left
as he could throw it. The clash of the steel-shod butt on stone was
drowned by a blinding flash of fire and a deafening detonation as
the pent-up charge burst the heavy barrel asunder and in the
intensified darkness that followed the flash Gordon was out of the
cave and racing for the ravine on his right.</p>

<p>No bullet followed him, though rifles banged on the heels of
that amazing report. As he had planned, the surprising explosion
from an unexpected quarter had confused his enemies, wrenched their
attention away from the cave mouth and the dim figure that flitted
from it. Men howled with amazement and fired blindly and
unreasoningly in the direction of the flash and roar. While they
howled and fired, Gordon reached the gully and plunged into it
almost without checking his stride&mdash;to collide with a shadowy
figure which grunted and grappled with him.</p>

<p>In an instant Gordon's hands locked on a hairy throat, stifling
the betraying yell. They went down together, and a rifle, useless
in such desperate close quarters, fell from the Pathan's hand. Out
on the plain pandemonium had burst, but Gordon was occupied with
the blood-crazy savage beneath him.</p>

<p>The man was taller and heavier than himself and his sinews were
like rawhide strands, but the advantage was with the tigerish white
man. As they rolled on the gully floor the Pathan strove in vain
with both hands to tear away the fingers that were crushing the
life from his corded throat, then still clawing at Gordon's wrist
with his left hand, began to grope in his girdle for a knife.
Gordon released his throat with his left hand, and with it caught
the other's right wrist just as the knife came clear.</p>

<p>The Pathan heaved and bucked like a wild man, straining his
wolfish muscles to the utmost, but in vain. He could not free his
knife wrist from Gordon's grasp nor tear from his throat the
fingers that were bending his neck back until his bearded chin
jutted upward. Desperately, he threw himself sidewise, trying to
bring his knee up to the American's groin, but his shift in
position gave Gordon the leverage he had been seeking.</p>

<p>Instantly El Borak twisted the Pathan's wrist with such savage
strength that a bone cracked and the knife fell from the numb
fingers. Gordon released the broken wrist, snatched a knife from
his own boot and ripped upward&mdash;again, again, and yet
again.</p>

<p>Not until the convulsive struggles ceased and the body went limp
beneath him did Gordon release the hairy throat. He crouched above
his victim, listening. The fight had been swift, fierce and silent,
enduring only a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>The unexpected explosion had loosed hysteria in the attackers.
The Orakzai were rushing the cave, not in stealth and silence, but
yelling so loudly and shooting so wildly they did not seem to
realize that no shots were answering them.</p>

<p>Nerves hung on hair triggers can be snapped by an untoward
occurrence. The rush of the warriors across the plain sounded like
the stampede of cattle. A man bounded up the ravine a few yards
from where Gordon crouched, without seeing the American in the
pit-like blackness. Howling, cursing, shooting blindly, the hillmen
stormed to the cave mouth, too crazy with excitement and confused
by the darkness to see the dim figure that glided out of the gully
behind them and raced silently away toward the mouth of the distant
gorge.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="hawk5" name="hawk5">CHAPTER V</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WILLOUGHBY always remembered that flight over the
mountains as a sort of nightmare in which he was hustled along by
ragged goblins through black defiles, up tendon-straining slopes
and along knife-edge ridges which fell away on either hand into
depths that turned him faint with nausea. Protests, exhortations
and fervent profanity did not serve to ease the flying pace at
which his escort was trundling him, and presently he had no breath
for protests. He did not even have time to be grateful that the
expected pursuit did not seem to be materializing.</p>

<p>He gasped like a dying fish and tried not to look down. He had
an uncomfortable feeling that the Afridis blamed him for Gordon's
plight and would gladly have heaved him off a ridge but for their
leaders' parting command.</p>

<p>But Willoughby felt that he was just as effectually being killed
by overexertion. He had never realized that human beings could
traverse such a path&mdash;or rather such a pathless track&mdash;as
he was being dragged over. When the moon sank the going was even
harder, but he was grateful, for the abysses they seemed to be
continually skirting were but floating gulfs of blackness beneath
them, which did not induce the sick giddiness resulting from
yawning chasms disclosed by the merciless moonlight.</p>

<p>His respect for Gordon's physical abilities increased to a kind
of frantic awe, for he knew the American was known to be superior
in stamina and endurance even to these long-legged, barrel-chested,
iron-muscled mountaineers who seemed built of some substance that
was tireless. Willoughby wished they would tire. They hauled him
along with a man at each arm, and one to pull, and another to push
when necessary, but even so the exertion was killing him. Sweat
bathed him, drenching his garments. His thighs trembled and the
calves of his legs were tied into agonizing knots.</p>

<p>He reflected in dizzy fragments that Gordon deserved whatever
domination he had achieved over these iron-jawed barbarians. But
mostly he did not think at all. His faculties were all occupied in
keeping his feet and gulping air. The veins in his temples were
nearly bursting and things were swimming in a bloody haze about him
when he realized his escort, or captors&mdash;or
torturers&mdash;had slowed to a walk. He voiced an incoherent croak
of gratitude and shaking the sweat out of his dilated eyes, he saw
that they were treading a path that ran over a natural rock bridge
which spanned a deep gorge. Ahead of him, looming above a cluster
of broken peaks, he saw a great black bulk heaving up against the
stars like a misshapen castle.</p>

<p>The sharp challenge of a rifleman rang staccato from the other
end of the span and was answered by Khoda Khan's bull-like bellow.
The path led upon a jutting ledge and half a dozen ragged, bearded
specters with rifles in their hands rose from behind a rampart of
heaped-up boulders.</p>

<p>Willoughby was in a state of collapse, able only to realize that
the killing grind was over. The Afridis half carried, half dragged
him within the semicircular rampart and he saw a bronze door
standing open and a doorway cut in solid rock that glowed luridly.
It required an effort to realize that the glow came from a fire
burning somewhere in the cavern into which the doorway led.</p>

<p>This, then, was Akbar's Castle. With each arm across a pair of
brawny shoulders Willoughby tottered through the cleft and down a
short narrow tunnel, to emerge into a broad natural chamber lighted
by smoky torches and a small fire over which tea was brewing and
meat cooking. Half a dozen men sat about the fire, and some forty
more slept on the stone floor, wrapped in their sheepskin coats.
Doorways opened from the huge main chamber, openings of other
tunnels or cell-like niches, and at the other end there were stalls
occupied by horses, a surprising number of them. Saddles, blanket
rolls, bridles and other equipage, with stands of rifles and stacks
of ammunition cases, littered the floor near the walls.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>The men about the fire rose to their feet looking inquiringly at
the Englishman and his escort, and the men on the floor awoke and
sat up blinking like ghouls surprised by daylight. A tall
broad-shouldered swashbuckler came striding out of the widest
doorway opening into the cavern. He paused before the group,
towering half a head taller than any other man there, hooked his
thumbs in his girdle and glared balefully.</p>

<p>"Who is this <i>feringhi</i>?" he snarled suspiciously. "Where
is El Borak?"</p>

<p>Three of the escort backed away apprehensively, but Khoda Khan,
held his ground and answered: "This is the <i>sahib</i> Willoughby,
whom El Borak met at the Minaret of Shaitan, Yar Ali Khan. We
rescued him from Baber Ali, who would have slain him. We were at
bay in the cave where Yar Muhammad shot the gray wolf three summers
ago. We stole out by a cleft, but the rope fell and left El Borak
on a ledge fifty feet above us, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Allah!" It was a blood-curdling yell from Yar Ali Khan who
seemed transformed into a maniac. "Dogs! You left him to die!
Accursed ones! Forgotten of God! I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He commanded us to bring this Englishman to Akbar's Castle,"
maintained Khoda Khan doggedly, "We tore our beards and wept, but
we obeyed!"</p>

<p>"Allah!" Yar Ali Khan became a whirlwind of energy. He snatched
up rifle, bandoleer and bridle. "Bring out the horses and saddle
them!" he roared and a score of men scurried. "Hasten! Forty men
with me to rescue El Borak! The rest hold the Castle. I leave Khoda
Khan in command."</p>

<p>"Leave the devil in command of hell," quoth Khoda Khan
profanely. "I ride with you to rescue El Borak&mdash;or I empty my
rifle into your belly."</p>

<p>His three comrades expressed similar intentions at the top of
their voices&mdash;after fighting and running all night, they were
wild as starving wolves to plunge back into hazard in behalf of
their chief.</p>

<p>"Go or stay, I care not!" howled Yar Ali Khan, tearing out a
fistful of his beard in his passion. "If Borak is slain I will
requite thee, by the prophet's beard and my feet! Allah rot me if I
ram not a rifle stock down thy accursed gullets&mdash;dogs,
jackals, noseless abominations, hasten with the horses!"</p>

<p>"Yar Ali Khan!" It was a yell from beyond the arch whence the
tall Afridi had first emerged. "One comes riding hard up the
valley!"</p>

<p>Yar Ali Khan yelled bloodthirstily and rushed into the tunnel,
brandishing his rifle, with everybody pelting after him except the
men detailed to saddle the horses.</p>

<p>Willoughby had been forgotten by the Pathans in the madhouse
brewed by Gordon's lieutenant. He limped after them, remembering
tales told of this gaunt giant and his berserk rages. The tunnel
down which the ragged horde was streaming ran for less than a
hundred feet when it widened to a mouth through which the gray
light of dawn was stealing. Through this the Afridis were pouring
and Willoughby, following them, came out upon a broad ledge a
hundred feet wide and fifty deep, like a gallery before a
house.</p>

<p>Around its semicircular rim ran a massive man-made wall,
shoulder-high, pierced with loopholes slanting down. There was an
arched opening in the wall, closed by a heavy bronze door, and from
that door, which now stood open, a row of broad shallow steps
niched in solid stone led down to a trail which in turn looped down
a three-hundred-foot slope to the floor of a broad valley.</p>

<p>The cliffs in which the cave sat closed the western end of the
valley, which opened to the east. Mists hung in the valley and out
of them a horseman came flying, growing ghostlike out of the
dimness of the dawn&mdash;a man on a great white horse, riding like
the wind.</p>

<p>Yar Ali Khan glared wildly for an instant, then started forward
with a convulsive leap of his whole body, flinging his rifle high
above his head.</p>

<p>"El Borak!" he roared.</p>

<p>Electrified by his yell, the men surged to the wall and those
saddling the mounts inside abandoned their task and rushed out onto
the ledge. In an instant the wall was lined with tense figures,
gripping their rifles and glaring into the white mists rolling
beyond the fleeing rider, from which they momentarily expected
pursuers to appear.</p>

<p>Willoughby, standing to one side like a spectator of a drama,
felt a tingle in his veins at the sight and sound of the wild
rejoicing with which these wild men greeted the man who had won
their allegiance. Gordon was no bluffing adventurer; he was a real
chief of men; and that, Willoughby realized, was going to make his
own job that much harder.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>No pursuers materialized out of the thinning mists. Gordon urged
his mount up the trail, up the broad steps, and as he rode through
the gate, bending his head under the arch, the roar of acclaim that
went up would have stirred the blood of a king. The Pathans swarmed
around him, catching at his hands, his garments, shouting praise to
Allah that he was alive and whole. He grinned down at them, swung
off and threw his reins to the nearest man, from whom Yar Ali Khan
instantly snatched them jealously, with a ferocious glare at the
offending warrior.</p>

<p>Willoughby stepped forward. He knew he looked like a scarecrow
in his stained and torn garments, but Gordon looked like a butcher,
with blood dried on his shirt and smeared on his breeches where he
had wiped his hands. But he did not seem to be wounded. He smiled
at Willoughby for the first time.</p>

<p>"Tough trip, eh?"</p>

<p>"We've been here only a matter of minutes," Willoughby
acknowledged.</p>

<p>"You took a short cut. I came the long way, but I made good time
on Baber Ali's horse," said Gordon.</p>

<p>"You mentioned possible ambushes in the valleys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. But on horseback I could take that risk. I was shot at
once, but they missed me. It's hard to aim straight in the
early-morning mists."</p>

<p>"How did you get away?"</p>

<p>"Waited until the moon went down, then made a break for it. Had
to kill a man in the gully before the cave. We were all twisted
together when I let him have the knife and that's where this blood
came from. I stole Baber's horse while the Orakzai were storming
the empty cave. Stampeded the herd down a canyon. Had to shoot the
fellow guarding it. Baber'll guess where I went, of course. He'll
be after me as quickly as he and his men can catch their horses. I
suspect they'll lay siege to the Castle, but they'll only waste
their time."</p>

<p>Willoughby stared about him in the growing light of dawn,
impressed by the strength of the stronghold. One rifleman could
hold the entrance through which he had been brought. To try to
advance along that narrow bridge that spanned the chasm behind the
Castle would be suicide for an enemy. And no force on earth could
march up the valley on this side and climb that stair in the teeth
of Gordon's rifles. The mountain which contained the cave rose up
like a huge stone citadel above the surrounding heights. The cliffs
which flanked the valley were lower than the fortified ledge; men
crawling along them would be exposed to a raking fire from above.
Attack could come from no other direction.</p>

<p>"This is really in Afdal Khan's territory," said Gordon. "It
used to be a Mogul outpost, as the name implies. It was first
fortified by Akbar himself. Afdal Khan held it before I took it.
It's my best safeguard for Kurram.</p>

<p>"After the outlying villages were burned on both sides, all my
people took refuge in Kurram, just as Afdal's did in Khoruk. To
attack Kurram, Afdal would have to pass Akbar's Castle and leave me
in his rear. He doesn't dare do that. That's why he wanted a
truce&mdash;to get me out of the Castle. With me ambushed and
killed, or hemmed up in Kurram, he'd be free to strike at Kurram
with all his force, without being afraid I'd burn Khoruk behind him
or ambush him in my country.</p>

<p>"He's too cautious of his own skin. I've repeatedly challenged
him to fight me man to man, but he pays no attention. He hasn't
stirred out of Khoruk since the feud started, unless he had at
least a hundred men with him&mdash; as many as I have in my entire
force, counting these here and those guarding the women and
children in Kurram."</p>

<p>"You've done a terrible amount of damage with so small a band,"
said Willoughby.</p>

<p>"Not difficult if you know the country, have men who trust you,
and keep moving. Geronimo almost whipped an army with a handful of
Apaches, and I was raised in his country. I've simply adopted his
tactics. The possession of this Castle was all I needed to assure
my ultimate victory. If Afdal had the guts to meet me, the feud
would be over. He's the chief; the others just follow him. As it is
I may have to wipe out the entire Khoruk clan. But I'll get
him."</p>

<p>The dark flame flickered in Gordon's eyes as he spoke, and again
Willoughby felt the impact of an inexorable determination,
elemental in its foundation. And again he swore mentally that he
would end the feud himself, in his own way, with Afdal Khan alive;
though how, he had not the faintest idea at present.</p>

<p>Gordon glanced at him closely and advised: "Better get some
sleep. If I know Baber Ali, he'll come straight to the Castle after
me. He knows he can't take it, but he'll try anyway. He has at
least a hundred men who follow him and take orders from nobody
else&mdash;not even Afdal Khan. After the shooting starts there
won't be much chance for sleeping. You look a bit done up."</p>

<p>Willoughby realized the truth of Gordon's comment. Sight of the
white streak of dawn stealing over the ash-hued peaks weighted his
eyelids with an irresistible drowsiness. He was barely able to
stumble into the cave, and the smell of frying mutton exercised no
charm to keep him awake. Somebody steered him to a heap of blankets
and he was asleep before he was actually stretched upon them.</p>

<p>Gordon stood looking down at the sleeping man enigmatically and
Yar Ali Khan came up as noiselessly and calmly as a gaunt gray
wolf; it would have been hard to believe he was the hurricane of
emotional upset which had stormed all over the cavern a short hour
before.</p>

<p>"Is he a friend, <i>sahib</i>?"</p>

<p>"A better friend than he realizes," was Gordon's grim, cryptic
reply. "I think Afdal Khan's friends will come to curse the day
Geoffrey Willoughby ever came into the hills."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="hawk6" name="hawk6">CHAPTER VI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AGAIN it was the spiteful cracking of rifles which
awakened Willoughby. He sat up, momentarily confused and unable to
remember where he was or how he came there. Then he recalled the
events of the night; he was in the stronghold of an outlaw chief,
and those detonations must mean the siege Gordon had predicted. He
was alone in the great cavern, except for the horses munching
fodder beyond the bars at the other end. Among them he recognized
the big white stallion that had belonged to Baber Ali.</p>

<p>The fire had died to a heap of coals and the daylight that stole
through a couple of arches, which were the openings of tunnels
connecting with the outer air, was augmented by half a dozen
antique-looking bronze lamps.</p>

<p>A pot of mutton stew simmered over the coals and a dish full of
<i>chupatties</i> stood near it. Willoughby was aware of a ravenous
hunger and he set to without delay. Having eaten his fill and drunk
deeply from a huge gourd which hung nearby, full of sweet, cool
water, he rose and started toward the tunnel through which he had
first entered the Castle.</p>

<p>Near the mouth he almost stumbled over an incongruous
object&mdash;a large telescope mounted on a tripod, and obviously
modern and expensive. A glance out on the ledge showed him only
half a dozen warriors sitting against the rampart, their rifles
across their knees. He glanced at the ribbon of stone that spanned
the deep gorge and shivered as he remembered how he had crossed it
in the darkness. It looked scarcely a foot wide in places. He
turned back, crossed the cavern and traversed the other tunnel.</p>

<p>He halted in the outer mouth. The wall that rimmed the ledge was
lined with Afridis, kneeling or lying at the loopholes. They were
not firing. Gordon leaned idly against the bronze door, his head in
plain sight of anyone who might be in the valley below. He nodded a
greeting as Willoughby advanced and joined him at the door. Again
the Englishman found himself a member of a besieged force, but this
time the advantage was all with the defenders.</p>

<p>Down in the valley, out of effectual rifle range, a long
skirmish line of men was advancing very slowly on foot, firing as
they came, and taking advantage of every bit of cover. Farther
back, small in the distance, a large herd of horses grazed, watched
by men who sat cross-legged in the shade of the cliff. The position
of the sun indicated that the day was well along toward the middle
of the afternoon.</p>

<p>"I've slept longer than I thought," Willoughby remarked. "How
long has this firing been going on?"</p>

<p>"Ever since noon. They're wasting Russian cartridges
scandalously. But you slept like a dead man. Baber Ali didn't get
here as quickly as I thought he would. He evidently stopped to
round up more men. There are at least a hundred down there."</p>

<p>To Willoughby the attack seemed glaringly futile. The men on the
ledge were too well protected to suffer from the long-range firing.
And before the attackers could get near enough to pick out the
loopholes, the bullets of the Afridis would be knocking them over
like tenpins. He glimpsed men crawling among the boulders on the
cliffs, but they were at the same disadvantage as the men in the
valley below&mdash;Gordon's rifle-men had a vantage point above
them.</p>

<p>"What can Baber Ali hope for?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He's desperate. He knows you're up here with me and he's taking
a thousand-to-one chance. But he's wasting his time. I have enough
ammunition and food to stand a six-month siege; there's a spring in
the cavern."</p>

<p>"Why hasn't Afdal Khan kept you hemmed up here with part of his
men while he stormed Kurram with the rest of his force?"</p>

<p>"Because it would take his whole force to storm Kurram; its
defenses are almost as strong as these. Then he has a dread of
having me at his back. Too big a risk that his men couldn't keep me
cooped up. He's got to reduce Akbar's Castle before he can strike
at Kurram."</p>

<p>"The devil!" said Willoughby irritably, brought back to his own
situation. "I came to arbitrate this feud and now I find myself a
prisoner. I've got to get out of here&mdash;got to get back to
Ghazrael."</p>

<p>"I'm as anxious to get you out as you are to go," answered
Gordon. "If you're killed I'm sure to be blamed for it. I don't
mind being outlawed for the things I have done, but I don't care to
shoulder something I didn't do."</p>

<p>"Couldn't I slip out of here tonight? By way of the
bridge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are men on the other side of the gorge, watching for just
such a move. Baber Ali means to close your mouth if human means can
do it."</p>

<p>"If Afdal Khan knew what's going on he'd come and drag the old
ruffian off my neck," growled Willoughby. "Afdal knows he can't
afford to let his clan kill an Englishman. But Baber will take good
care Afdal doesn't know, of course. If I could get a letter to
him&mdash;but of course that's impossible."</p>

<p>"We can try it, though," returned Gordon. "You write the note.
Afdal knows your handwriting, doesn't he? Good! Tonight I'll sneak
out and take it to his nearest outpost. He keeps a line of patrols
among the hills a few miles beyond Jehungir's Well."</p>

<p>"But if I can't slip out, how can you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can do it all right, alone. No offense, but you Englishmen
sound like a herd of longhorn steers at your stealthiest. The
Orakzai are among the crags on the other side of the Gorge of
Mekram. I won't cross the bridge. My men will let me down a rope
ladder into the gorge tonight before moonrise. I'll slip up to the
camp of the nearest outpost, wrap the note around a pebble and
throw it among them. Being Afdal's men and not Baber's, they'll
take it to him. I'll come back the way I went, after moonset. It'll
be safe enough."</p>

<p>"But how safe will it be for Afdal Khan when he comes for
me?"</p>

<p>"You can tell Afdal Khan he won't be harmed if he plays fair,"
Gordon answered. "But you'd better make some arrangements so you
can see him and know he's there before you trust yourself outside
this cave. And there's the pinch, because Afdal won't dare show
himself for fear I'd shoot him. He's broken so many pacts himself
he can't believe anybody would keep one. Not where his hide is
concerned. He trusted me to keep my word in regard to Baber and
your escort, but would he trust himself to my promise?"</p>

<p>Willoughby scowled, cramming the bowl of his pipe. "Wait!" he
said suddenly. "I saw a big telescope in the cavern, mounted on a
tripod&mdash;is it in working order?"</p>

<p>"I should say it is. I imported that from Germany, by the way of
Turkey and Persia. That's one reason Akbar's Castle has never been
surprised. It carries for miles."</p>

<p>"Does Afdal Khan know of it?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure he does."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>Seating himself on the ledge, Willoughby drew forth pencil and
notebook, propped the latter against his knee, and wrote in his
clear concise hand:</p>

<p class="letter">AFDAL KHAN: I am at Akbar's Castle, now being
besieged by your uncle, Baber Ali. Baber was so unreasonably
incensed at my failure to effect a truce that he allowed my servant
Suleiman to be murdered, and now intends murdering me, to stop my
mouth.<br>
<br>
I don't have to remind you how fatal it would be to the interests
of your party for this to occur. I want you to come to Akbar's
Castle and get me out of this. Gordon assures me you will not be
molested if you play fair, but here is a way by which you need not
feel you are taking any chances: Gordon has a large telescope
through which I can identify you while you are still out of rifle
range. In the Gorge of Mekram, and southwest of the Castle, there
is a mass of boulders split off from the right wall and well out of
rifle range from the Castle. If you were to come and stand on those
boulders, I could identify you easily.<br>
<br>
Naturally, I will not leave the Castle until I know you are present
to protect me from your uncle. As soon as I have identified you, I
will come down the gorge alone. You can watch me all the way and
assure yourself that no treachery is intended. No one but myself
will leave the Castle. On your part I do not wish any of your men
to advance beyond the boulders and I will not answer for their
safety if they should, as I intend to safeguard Gordon in this
matter as well as yourself.<br>
<br>
GEOFFREY WILLOUGHBY</p>

<p>He handed the letter over for Gordon to read.</p>

<p>The American nodded. "That may bring him. I don't know. He's
kept out of my sight ever since the feud started."</p>

<p>Then ensued a period of waiting, in which the sun seemed
sluggishly to crawl toward the western peaks. Down in the valley
and on the cliffs the Orakzai kept up their fruitless firing with a
persistency that convinced Willoughby of the truth of Gordon's
assertion that ammunition was being supplied them by some European
power.</p>

<p>The Afridis were not perturbed. They lounged at ease by the
wall, laughed, joked, chewed jerked mutton and fired through the
slanting loopholes when the Orakzai crept too close. Three still
white-clad forms in the valley and one on the cliffs testified to
their accuracy. Willoughby realized that Gordon was right when he
said the clan which held Akbar's Castle was certain to win the war
eventually. Only a desperate old savage like Baber Ali would waste
time and men trying to take it. Yet the Orakzai had originally held
it. How Gordon had gained possession of it Willoughby could not
imagine.</p>

<p>The sun dipped at last; the Himalayan twilight deepened into
black- velvet, star-veined dusk. Gordon rose, a vague figure in the
starlight.</p>

<p>"Time for me to be going."</p>

<p>He had laid aside his rifle and buckled a tulwar to his hip.
Willoughby followed him into the great cavern, now dim and shadowy
in the light of the bronze lamps, and through the narrow tunnel and
the bronze door.</p>

<p>Yar Ali Khan, Khoda Khan, and half a dozen others followed them.
The light from the cavern stole through the tunnel, vaguely etching
the moving figures of the men. Then the bronze door was closed
softly and Willoughby's companions were shapeless blurs in the
thick soft darkness around him. The gorge below was a floating
river of blackness. The bridge was a dark streak that ran into the
unknown and vanished. Not even the keenest eyes of the hills,
watching from beyond the gorge, could have even discerned the jut
of the ledge under the black bulk of the Castle, much less the
movements of the men upon it.</p>

<p>The voices of the men working at the rim of the ledge were low
and murmurous as the whispering of the night breezes. Willoughby
sensed rather than saw that they were lowering the rope
ladder&mdash;a hundred and fifty feet of it&mdash;into the gorge.
Gordon's face was a light blur in the darkness. Willoughby groped
for his hand and found him already swinging over the rampart onto
the ladder, one end of which was made fast to a great iron ring set
in the stone of the ledge.</p>

<p>"Gordon, I feel like a bounder, letting you take this risk for
me. Suppose some of those devils are down there in the gorge?"</p>

<p>"Not much chance. They don't know we have this way of coming and
going. If I can steal a horse, I'll be back in the Castle before
dawn. If I can't, and have to make the whole trip there and back on
foot, I may have to hide out in the hills tomorrow and get back
into the Castle the next night. Don't worry about me. They'll never
see me. Yar Ali Khan, watch for a rush before the moon rises."</p>

<p>"Aye, <i>sahib</i>." The bearded giant's undisturbed manner
reassured Willoughby.</p>

<p>The next instant Gordon began to melt into the gloom below.
Before he had climbed down five rungs the men crouching on the
rampart could no longer see him. He made no sound in his descent.
Khoda Khan knelt with a hand on the ropes, and as soon as he felt
them go slack, he began to haul the ladder up. Willoughby leaned
over the edge, straining his ears to catch some sound from
below&mdash;scruff of leather, rattle of shale&mdash;he heard
nothing.</p>

<p>Yar Ali Khan muttered, his beard brushing Willoughby's ear:
"Nay, <i>sahib</i>, if such ears as yours could hear him, every
Orakzai on this side of the mountain would know a man stole down
the gorge! You will not hear him&mdash;nor will they. There are
Lifters of the Khyber who can steal rifles out of the tents of the
British soldiers, but they are blundering cattle compared to El
Borak. Before dawn a wolf will howl in the gorge, and we will know
El Borak has returned and will let down the ladder for him."</p>

<p>But like the others, the huge Afridi leaned over the rampart
listening intently for some fifteen minutes after the ladder had
been drawn up. Then with a gesture to the others he turned and
opened the bronze door a crack. They stole through hurriedly.
Somewhere in the blackness across the gorge a rifle cracked flatly
and lead spanged a foot or so above the lintel. In spite of the
rampart some quick eye among the crags had caught the glow of the
opened door. But it was blind shooting. The sentries left on the
ledge did not reply.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Back on the ledge that overlooked the valley, Willoughby noted
an air of expectancy among the warriors at the loopholes. They were
momentarily expecting the attack of which Gordon had warned
them.</p>

<p>"How did Gordon ever take Akbar's Castle?" Willoughby asked
Khoda Khan, who seemed more ready to answer questions than any of
the other taciturn warriors.</p>

<p>The Afridi squatted beside him near the open bronze gate, rifle
in hand, the butt resting on the ledge. Over them was the
blue-black bowl of the Himalayan night, flecked with clusters of
frosty silver.</p>

<p>"He sent Yar Ali Khan with forty horsemen to make a feint at
Baber Ali's <i>sangar</i>," answered Khoda Khan promptly. "Thinking
to trap us, Afdal drew all his men out of Akbar's Castle except
three. Afdal believed three men could hold it against an army, and
so they could&mdash;against an army. Not against El Borak. While
Baber Ali and Afdal were striving to pin Yar Ali Khan and us forty
riders between them, and we were leading the dogs a merry chase
over the hills, El Borak rode alone down this valley. He came
disguised as a Persian trader, with his turban awry and his rich
garments dusty and rent. He fled down the valley shouting that
thieves had looted his caravan and were pursuing him to take from
him his purse of gold and his pouch of jewels.</p>

<p>"The accursed ones left to guard the Castle were greedy, and
they saw only a rich and helpless merchant, to be looted. So they
bade him take refuge in the cavern and opened the gate to him. He
rode into Akbar's Castle crying praise to Allah&mdash;with empty
hands, but a knife and pistols under his <i>khalat</i>. Then the
accursed ones mocked him and set on him to strip him of his
riches&mdash;by Allah they found they caught a tiger in the guise
of a lamb! One he slew with the knife, the other two he shot. Alone
he took the stronghold against which armies have thundered in vain!
When we forty-one horsemen evaded the Orakzai and doubled back, as
it had been planned, lo! the bronze gate was open to us and we were
lords of Akbar's Castle! Ha! The forgotten of God charge the
stair!"</p>

<p>From the shadows below there welled up the sudden, swift drum of
hoofs and Willoughby glimpsed movement in the darkness of the
valley. The blurred masses resolved themselves into dim figures
racing up the looping trail. At the same time a rattle of rifle
fire burst out behind the Castle, from beyond the Gorge of Mekram.
The Afridis displayed no excitement. Khoda Khan did not even close
the bronze gate. They held their fire until the hoofs of the
foremost horses were ringing on the lower steps of the stair. Then
a burst of flame crowned the wall, and in its flash Willoughby saw
wild bearded faces, horses tossing heads and manes.</p>

<p>In the darkness following the volley there rose screams of agony
from men and beasts, mingled with the thrashing and kicking of
wounded horses and the grating of shod hoofs on stone as some of
the beasts slid backward down the stair. Dead and dying piled in a
heaving, agonized mass, and the stairs became a shambles as again
and yet again the rippling volleys crashed.</p>

<p>Willoughby wiped a damp brow with a shaking hand, grateful that
the hoofbeats were receding down the valley. The gasps and moans
and cries which welled up from the ghastly heap at the foot of the
stairs sickened him.</p>

<p>"They are fools," said Khoda Khan, levering fresh cartridges
into his rifle. "Thrice in past attacks have they charged the stair
by darkness, and thrice have we broken them. Baber Ali is a bull
rushing blindly to his destruction."</p>

<p>Rifles began to flash and crack down in the valley as the
baffled besiegers vented their wrath in blind discharges. Bullets
smacked along the wall of the cliff, and Khoda Khan closed the
bronze gate.</p>

<p>"Why don't they attack by way of the bridge?" Willoughby
wondered.</p>

<p>"Doubtless they did. Did you not hear the shots? But the path is
narrow and one man behind the rampart could keep it clear. And
there are six men there, all skilled marksmen."</p>

<p>Willoughby nodded, remembering the narrow ribbon of rock flanked
on either hand by echoing depths.</p>

<p>"Look, <i>sahib</i>, the moon rises."</p>

<p>Over the eastern peaks a glow began which grew to a soft golden
fire against which the peaks stood blackly outlined. Then the moon
rose, not the mellow gold globe promised by the forerunning luster,
but a gaunt, red, savage moon, of the high Himalayas.</p>

<p>Khoda Khan opened the bronze gate and peered down the stair,
grunting softly in gratification. Willoughby, looking over his
shoulder, shuddered. The heap at the foot of the stairs was no
longer a merciful blur, for the moon outlined it in pitiless
detail. Dead horses and dead men lay in a tangled gory mound with
rifles and sword blades thrust out of the pile like weeds growing
out of a scrap heap. There must have been at least a dozen horses
and almost as many men in that shambles.</p>

<p>"A shame to waste good horses thus," muttered Khoda Khan. "Baber
Ali is a fool." He closed the gate.</p>

<p>Willoughby leaned back against the wall, drawing a heavy
sheepskin coat about him. He felt sick and futile. The men down in
the valley must feel the same way, for the firing was falling off,
becoming spasmodic. Even Baber Ali must realize the futility of the
siege by this time. Willoughby smiled bitterly to himself. He had
come to arbitrate a hill feud&mdash;and down there men lay dead in
heaps. But the game was not yet played out. The thought of Gordon
stealing through those black mountains out there somewhere
discouraged sleep. Yet he did slumber at last, despite himself.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>It was Khoda Khan who shook him awake. Willoughby looked up
blinking. Dawn was just whitening the peaks. Only a dozen men
squatted at the loopholes. From the cavern stole the reek of coffee
and frying meat.</p>

<p>"Your letter has been safely delivered, <i>sahib</i>."</p>

<p>"Eh? What's that? Gordon's returned?"</p>

<p>Willoughby rose stiffly, relieved that Gordon had not suffered
on his account. He glanced over the wall. Down the valley the camp
of the raiders was veiled by the morning mists, but several strands
of smoke oozed toward the sky. He did not look down the stair; he
did not wish to see the cold faces of the dead in the white dawn
light.</p>

<p>He followed Khoda Khan into the great chamber where some of the
warriors were sleeping and some preparing breakfast. The Afridi
gestured toward a cell- like niche where a man lay. He had his back
to the door, but the black, close- cropped hair and dusty khakis
were unmistakable.</p>

<p>"He is weary," said Khoda Khan. "He sleeps."</p>

<p>Willoughby nodded. He had begun to wonder if Gordon ever found
it necessary to rest and sleep like ordinary men.</p>

<p>"It were well to go upon the ledge and watch for Afdal Khan,"
said Khoda Khan. "We have mounted the telescope there,
<i>sahib</i>. One shall bring your breakfast to you there. We have
no way of knowing when Afdal will come."</p>

<p>Out on the ledge the telescope stood on its tripod, projecting
like a cannon over the rampart. He trained it on the mass of
boulders down the ravine. The Gorge of Mekram ran from the north to
the southwest. The boulders, called the Rocks, were more than a
mile of the southwest of the Castle. Just beyond them the gorge
bent sharply. A man could reach the Rocks from the southwest
without being spied from the Castle, but he could not approach
beyond them without being seen. Nor could anyone leave the Castle
from that side and approach the Rocks without being seen by anyone
hiding there.</p>

<p>The Rocks were simply a litter of huge boulders which had broken
off from the canyon wall. Just now, as Willoughby looked, the mist
floated about them, making them hazy and indistinct. Yet as he
watched them they became more sharply outlined, growing out of the
thinning mist. And on the tallest rock there stood a motionless
figure. The telescope brought it out in vivid clarity. There was no
mistaking that tall, powerful figure. It was Afdal Khan who stood
there, watching the Castle with a pair of binoculars.</p>

<p>"He must have got the letter early in the night, or ridden hard
to get here this early," muttered Willoughby. "Maybe he was at some
spot nearer than Khoruk. Did Gordon say?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>sahib</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, no matter. We won't wake Gordon. No, I won't wait for
breakfast. Tell El Borak that I'm grateful for all the trouble he's
taken in my behalf and I'll do what I can for him when I get back
to Ghazrael. But he'd better decide to let this thing be
arbitrated. I'll see that Afdal doesn't try any treachery."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sahib</i>."</p>

<p>They tossed the rope ladder into the gorge and it unwound
swiftly as it tumbled down and dangled within a foot of the canyon
floor. The Afridis showed their heads above the ramparts without
hesitation, but when Willoughby mounted the rampart and stood in
plain sight, he felt a peculiar crawling between his shoulders.</p>

<p>But no rifle spoke from the crags beyond the gorge. Of course,
the sight of Afdal Khan was sufficient guarantee of his safety.
Willoughby set a foot in the ladder and went down, refusing to look
below him. The ladder tended to swing and spin after he had
progressed a few yards and from time to time he had to steady
himself with a hand against the cliff wall. But altogether it was
not so bad, and presently he heaved a sigh of relief as he felt the
rocky floor under his feet. He waved his arms, but the rope was
already being drawn up swiftly. He glanced about him. If any bodies
had fallen from the bridge in the night battle, they had been
removed. He turned and walked down the gorge, toward the appointed
rendezvous.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Dawn grew about him, the white mists changing to rosy pink, and
swiftly dissipating. He could make out the outlines of the Rocks
plainly now, without artificial aid, but he no longer saw Afdal
Khan. Doubtless the suspicious chief was watching his approach from
some hiding place. He kept listening for distant shots that would
indicate Baber Ali was renewing the siege, but he heard none.
Doubtless Baber Ali had already received orders from Afdal Khan,
and he visualized Afdal's amazement and rage when he learned of his
uncle's indiscretions.</p>

<p>He reached the Rocks&mdash;a great heap of rugged, irregular
stones and broken boulders, towering thirty feet in the air in
places.</p>

<p>He halted and called: "Afdal Khan!"</p>

<p>"This way, <i>sahib</i>," a voice answered. "Among the
Rocks."</p>

<p>Willoughby advanced between a couple of jagged boulders and came
into a sort of natural theater, made by the space inclosed between
the overhanging cliff and the mass of detached rocks. Fifty men
could have stood there without being crowded, but only one man was
in sight&mdash;a tall, lusty man in early middle life, in turban
and silken <i>khalat</i>. He stood with his head thrown back in
unconscious arrogance, a broad tulwar in his hand.</p>

<p>The faint crawling between his shoulders that had accompanied
Willoughby all the way down the gorge, in spite of himself, left
him at the sight. When he spoke his voice was casual.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you, Afdal Khan."</p>

<p>"And I am glad to see you, <i>sahib</i>!" the Orakzai answered
with a chill smile. He thumbed the razor-edge of his tulwar. "You
have failed in the mission for which I brought you into these
hills&mdash;but your death will serve me almost as well."</p>

<p>Had the Rocks burst into a roar about him the surprise would
have been no more shocking. Willoughby literally staggered with the
impact of the stunning revelation.</p>

<p>"What? My death? Afdal, are you mad?"</p>

<p>"What will the English do to Baber Ali?" demanded the chief.</p>

<p>"They'll demand that he be tried for the murder of Suleiman,"
answered Willoughby.</p>

<p>"And the Amir would hang him, to placate the British!" Afdal
Khan laughed mirthlessly. "But if you were dead, none would ever
know! Bah! Do you think I would let my uncle be hanged for slaying
that Punjabi dog? Baber was a fool to let his men take the Indian's
life. I would have prevented it, had I known. But now it is done
and I mean to protect him. El Borak is not so wise as I thought or
he would have known that I would never let Baber be punished."</p>

<p>"It means ruin for you if you murder me," reminded
Willoughby&mdash;through dry lips, for he read the murderous gleam
in the Orakzai's eyes.</p>

<p>"Where are the witnesses to accuse me? There is none this side
of the Castle save you and I. I have removed my men from the crags
near the bridge. I sent them all into the valley&mdash;partly
because I feared lest one might fire a hasty shot and spoil my
plan, partly because I do not trust my own men any farther than I
have to. Sometimes a man can be bribed or persuaded to betray even
his chief.</p>

<p>"Before dawn I sent men to comb the gorge and these Rocks to
make sure no trap had been set for me. Then I came here and sent
them away and remained here alone. They do not know why I came.
They shall never know. Tonight, when the moon rises, your head will
be found in a sack at the foot of the stair that leads down from
Akbar's Castle and there will be a hundred men to swear it was
thrown down by El Borak.</p>

<p>"And because they will believe it themselves, none can prove
them liars. I want them to believe it themselves, because I know
how shrewd you English are in discovering lies. I will send your
head to Fort Ali Masjid, with fifty men to swear El Borak murdered
you. The British will force the Amir to send an army up here, with
field pieces, and shell El Borak out of my Castle. Who will believe
him if he has the opportunity to say he did not slay you?"</p>

<p>"Gordon was right!" muttered Willoughby helplessly. "You are a
treacherous dog. Would you mind telling me just why you forced this
feud on him?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, since you will be dead in a few moments, I want
control of the wells that dominate the caravan routes. The Russians
will pay me a great deal of gold to help them smuggle rifles and
ammunition down from Persia and Turkestan, into Afghanistan and
Kashmir and India. I will help them, and they will help me. Some
day they will make me Amir of Afghanistan."</p>

<p>"Gordon was right," was all Willoughby could say. "The man was
right! And this truce you wanted&mdash;I suppose it was another
trick?"</p>

<p>"Of course! I wanted to get El Borak out of my Castle."</p>

<p>"What a fool I've been," muttered Willoughby.</p>

<p>"Best make your peace with God then berate yourself,
<i>sahib</i>," said Afdal Khan, beginning to swing the heavy tulwar
to and fro, turning the blade so the edge gleamed in the early
light. "There are only you and I and Allah to see &mdash;and Allah
hates infidels! Steel is silent and sure&mdash;one stroke, swift
and deadly, and your head will be mine to use as I wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>He advanced with the noiseless stride of the hillman. Willoughby
set his teeth and clenched his hands until the nails bit into the
palms. He knew it was useless to run; the Orakzai would overtake
him within half a dozen strides. It was equally futile to leap and
grapple with his bare hands, but it was all he could do; death
would smite him in mid-leap and there would be a rush of darkness
and an end of planning and working and all things hoped
for&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Afdal Khan!"</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>The voice was moderately pitched, but if it had been a sudden
scream the effect could have been no more startling. Afdal Khan
started violently and whirled about. He froze in his tracks and the
tulwar slipped from his fingers. His face went ashen and slowly his
hands rose above his shoulders.</p>

<p>Gordon stood in a cleft of the cleft, and a heavy pistol, held
hip-high, menaced the chief's waistline. Gordon's expression was
one of faint amusement, but a hot flame leaped and smoldered in his
black eyes.</p>

<p>"El Borak!" stammered Afdal Khan dazedly. "El Borak!" Suddenly
he cried out like a madman. "You are a ghost&mdash;a devil! The
Rocks were empty&mdash;my men searched them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was hiding on a ledge on the cliff above their heads," Gordon
answered. "I entered the Rocks after they left. Keep your hands
away from your girdle, Afdal Khan. I could have shot you any time
within the last hour, but I wanted Willoughby to know you for the
rogue you are."</p>

<p>"But I saw you in the cave," gasped Willoughby, "asleep in the
cave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You saw an Afridi, Ali Shah, in some of my clothes, pretending
to be sleeping," answered Gordon, never taking his eyes off Afdal
Khan. "I was afraid if you knew I wasn't in the Castle, you'd
refuse to meet Afdal, thinking I was up to something. So after I
tossed your note into the Orakzai camp, I came back to the Castle
while you were asleep, gave my men their orders and hid down the
gorge.</p>

<p>"You see I knew Afdal wouldn't let Baber be punished for killing
Suleiman. He couldn't if he wanted to. Baber has too many followers
in the Khoruk clan. And the only way of keeping the Amir's favor
without handing Baber over for trial, would be to shut your mouth.
He could always lay it onto me, then. I knew that note would bring
him to meet you&mdash;and I knew he'd come prepared to kill
you."</p>

<p>"He might have killed me," muttered Willoughby.</p>

<p>"I've had a gun trained on him ever since you came within range.
If he'd brought men with him, I'd have shot him before you left the
Castle. When I saw he meant to wait here alone, I waited for you to
find out for yourself what kind of a dog he is. You've been in no
danger."</p>

<p>"I thought he arrived early, to have come from Khoruk."</p>

<p>"I knew he wasn't at Khoruk when I left the Castle last night,"
said Gordon. "I knew when Baber found us safe in the Castle he'd
make a clean breast of everything to Afdal&mdash;and that Afdal
would come to help him. Afdal was camped half a mile back in the
hills&mdash;surrounded by a mob of fighting men, as usual, and
under cover. If I could have got a shot at him then, I wouldn't
have bothered to deliver your note. But this is as good a time as
any."</p>

<p>Again the flames leaped up the black eyes and sweat beaded Afdal
Khan's swarthy skin.</p>

<p>"You're not going to kill him in cold blood?" Willoughby
protested.</p>

<p>"No. I'll give him a better chance than he gave Yusef Khan."</p>

<p>Gordon stepped to the silent Pathan, pressed his muzzle against
his ribs and drew a knife and revolver from Afdal Khan's girdle. He
tossed the weapons up among the rocks and sheathed his own pistol.
Then he drew his tulwar with a soft rasp of steel against leather.
When he spoke his voice was calm, but Willoughby saw the veins knot
and swell on his temples.</p>

<p>"Pick up your blade, Afdal Khan. There is no one here save the
Englishman, you, I and Allah&mdash;and Allah hates swine!"</p>

<p>Afdal Khan snarled like a trapped panther; he bent his knees,
reaching one hand toward the weapon&mdash;he crouched there
motionless for an instant eyeing Gordon with a wide, blank
glare&mdash;then all in one motion he snatched up the tulwar and
came like a Himalayan hill gust.</p>

<p>Willoughby caught his breath at the blinding ferocity of that
onslaught. It seemed to him that Afdal's hand hardly touched the
hilt before he was hacking at Gordon's head. But Gordon's head was
not there. And Willoughby, expecting to see the American
overwhelmed in the storm of steel that played about him began to
recall tales he had heard of El Borak's prowess with the heavy,
curved Himalayan blade.</p>

<p>Afdal Khan was taller and heavier than Gordon, and he was as
quick as a famished wolf. He rained blow on blow with all the
strength of his corded arm, and so swiftly Willoughby could follow
the strokes only by the incessant clangor of steel on steel. But
that flashing tulwar did not connect; each murderous blow rang on
Gordon's blade or swished past his head as he shifted. Not that the
American fought a running fight. Afdal Khan moved about much more
than did Gordon. The Orakzai swayed and bent his body agilely to
right and left, leaped in and out, and circled his antagonist,
smiting incessantly.</p>

<p>Gordon moved his head frequently to avoid blows, but he seldom
shifted his feet except to keep his enemy always in front of him.
His stance was as firm as that of a deep-rooted rock, and his blade
was never beaten down. Beneath the heaviest blows the Pathan could
deal, it opposed an unyielding guard.</p>

<p>The man's wrist and forearm must be made of iron, thought
Willoughby, staring in amazement. Afdal Khan beat on El Borak's
tulwar like a smith on an anvil, striving to beat the American to
his knee by the sheer weight of his attack; cords of muscle stood
out on Gordon's wrist as he met the attack. He did not give back a
foot. His guard never weakened.</p>

<p>Afdal Khan was panting and perspiration streamed down his dark
face. His eyes held the glare of a wild beast. Gordon was not even
breathing hard. He seemed utterly unaffected by the tempest beating
upon him. And desperation flooded Afdal Khan's face, as he felt his
own strength waning beneath his maddened efforts to beat down that
iron guard.</p>

<p>"Dog!" he gasped, spat in Gordon's face and lunged in
terrifically, staking all on one stroke, and throwing his sword arm
far back before he swung his tulwar in an arc that might have
felled an oak.</p>

<p>Then Gordon moved and the speed of his shift would have shamed a
wounded catamount. Willoughby could not follow his motion&mdash;he
only saw that Afdal Khan's mighty swipe had cleft only empty air,
and Gordon's blade was a blinding flicker in the rising sun. There
was a sound as of a cleaver sundering a joint of beef and Afdal
Khan staggered. Gordon stepped back with a low laugh, merciless as
the ring of flint, and a thread of crimson wandered down the broad
blade in his hand.</p>

<p>Afdal Khan's face was livid; he swayed drunkenly on his feet,
his eyes dilated; his left hand was pressed to his side, and blood
spouted between the fingers; his right arm fought to raise the
tulwar that had become an imponderable weight.</p>

<p>"Allah!" he croaked. "Allah&mdash;" Suddenly his knees bent and
he fell as a tree falls.</p>

<p>Willoughby bent over him in awe.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, he's shorn half asunder! How could a man live
even those few seconds, with a wound like that?"</p>

<p>"Hillmen are hard to kill," Gordon answered, shaking the red
drops from his blade. The crimson glare had gone out of his eyes;
the fire that had for so long burned consumingly in his soul had
been quenched at last, though it had been quenched in blood.</p>

<p>"You can go back to Kabul and tell the Amir the feud's over," he
said. "The caravans from Persia will soon be passing over the road
again."</p>

<p>"What about Baber Ali?"</p>

<p>"He pulled out last night, after his attack on the Castle
failed. I saw him riding out of the valley with most of his men. He
was sick of the siege. Afdal's men are still in the valley but
they'll leg it for Khoruk as soon as they hear what's happened to
Afdal. The Amir will make an outlaw out of Baber Ali as soon as you
get back to Kabul. I've got no more to fear from the Khoruk clan;
they'll be glad to agree to peace."</p>

<p>Willoughby glanced down at the dead man. The feud had ended as
Gordon had sworn it would. Gordon had been in the right all along;
but it was a new and not too pleasing experience to Willoughby to
be used as a pawn in a game&mdash;as he himself had used so many
men and women.</p>

<p>He laughed wryly. "Confound you, Gordon, you've bamboozled me
all the way through! You let me believe that only Baber Ali was
besieging us, and that Afdal Khan would protect me against his
uncle! You set a trap to catch Afdal Khan, and you used me as bait!
I've got an idea that if I hadn't thought of that
letter-and-telescope combination, you'd have suggested it
yourself."</p>

<p>"I'll give you an escort to Ghazrael when the rest of the
Orakzai clear out," offered Gordon.</p>

<p>"Damn it, man, if you hadn't saved my life so often in the past
forty- eight hours, I'd be inclined to use bad language! But Afdal
Khan was a rogue and deserved what he got. I can't say that I
relish your methods, but they're effective! You ought to be in the
secret service. A few years at this rate and you'll be Amir of
Afghanistan!"</p>
