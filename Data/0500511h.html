  <h2><a name="ch-0"
     id="ch-0"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>

  <p class="first">TO every woman there comes a day (and that all too soon)
  when she receives the first hint that Time, the harvester, has not passed her
  by unnoticed. The waning of actual youth may have passed with but the
  faintest regret, if any; regret for the lost bud being merged in the triumph
  at the glory of the opening blossom. But the waning of womanhood is another
  matter. Old age has no compensations to offer for those delights that it
  steals away. At least, that is what I understand from those who know, for I
  must still speak on the subject from hearsay, having received from Father
  Time but the very faintest and most delicate hint on the subject.</p>

  <p>I was sitting at my dressing-table brushing out my hair, which is of a
  docile habit, though a thought bulky, when amidst the black
  tress&mdash;blacker than it used to be when I was a girl&mdash;I noticed a
  single white hair. It was the first that I had seen, and I looked at it
  dubiously, picking it out from its fellows to see if it were all white, and
  noticing how like it was to a thread of glass. Should I pluck it out and
  pretend that it was never there? Or should I, more thriftily&mdash;for a hair
  is a hair after all, and enough of them will make a wig&mdash;should I dye it
  and hush up its treason?</p>

  <p>I smiled at the foolish thought. What a to-do about a single white hair! I
  have seen girls in their twenties with snow-white hair and looking as sweet
  as lavender. As to this one, I would think of it as a souvenir from the
  troubled past rather than a harbinger of approaching age; and with this I
  swept my brush over it and buried it even as I had buried those sorrows and
  those dreadful experiences which might have left me white-headed years
  before.</p>

  <p>But that glassy thread, buried once more amid the black, left a legacy of
  suggestion. Those hideous days were long past now. I could look back on them
  unmoved&mdash;nay, with a certain serene interest. Suppose I should write the
  history of them? Why not? To write is not necessarily to publish. And if,
  perchance, no eye but mine shall see these lines until the little taper of my
  life has burned down into its socket, then what matters it to me whether
  praise or blame, sympathy or condemnation, be my portion. Posterity has no
  gifts to offer that I need court its suffrages.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1"
     id="ch-1"></a>BOOK I. &mdash; TRAGEDY</h2>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-01"
     id="ch-1-01"></a>I. &mdash; THE CRACK OF DOOM</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE is no difficulty whatever in deciding upon the exact
  moment at which to open this history. Into some lives the fateful and
  significant creep by degrees, unnoticed till by the development of their
  consequences the mind is aroused and memory is set, like a sleuth-hound, to
  retrace the course of events and track the present to its origin in the past.
  Not so has it been with mine. Serene, eventless, its quiet years had slipped
  away unnumbered, from childhood to youth, from youth to womanhood, when, at
  the appointed moment, the voice of Destiny rang out, trumpet-tongued; and
  behold! in the twinkling of an eye all was changed.</p>

  <p>"Happy," it has been said, "is the nation which has no history!" And
  surely the same may be said with equal truth of individuals. So, at any rate,
  experience teaches me; for the very moment wherein I may be said to have
  begun to have a history saw a life-long peace shattered into a chaos of
  misery and disaster.</p>

  <p>How well I remember the day&mdash;yea, and the very moment&mdash;when the
  blow fell, like a thunderbolt crashing down out of a cloudless sky. I had
  been sitting in my little room upstairs, reading very studiously and pausing
  now and again to think over what I had read. The book was Lecky's "History of
  England in the Eighteenth Century," and the period on which I was engaged was
  that of Queen Anne. And here, coming presently upon a footnote containing a
  short quotation from "The Spectator," it occurred to me that I should like to
  look over the original letter. Accordingly, laying aside my book, I began to
  descend the stairs&mdash;very softly, because I knew that my father had a
  visitor&mdash;possibly a client&mdash;with him in his study. And when I came
  to the turn of the stair and saw that the study door was ajar, I stepped more
  lightly still, though I stole down quickly lest I should overhear what was
  being said.</p>

  <p>The library, or book-room as we called it, was next to the study, and to
  reach it I had to pass the half-opened door, which I did swiftly on tip-toe,
  without hearing more than the vague murmur of conversation from within. "The
  Spectators" stood on a shelf close to the door; a goodly row clothed in rusty
  calf to which the worn gilt tooling imparted a certain sumptuousness that had
  always seemed very pleasant to my eye. My hand was on the third volume when I
  heard my father say:</p>

  <p>"So that's how the matter stands."</p>

  <p>I plucked the volume from the shelf, and, tucking it under my arm, stole
  out of the book-room, intending to dart up the stairs before there should be
  time for anything more to be said; but I had hardly crossed the threshold,
  and was, in fact, exactly opposite the study door, when a voice said very
  distinctly, though not at all loudly:</p>

  <p>"Do you realise, Vardon, that this renders you liable to seven years'
  penal servitude?"</p>

  <p>At those terrible words I stopped as though I had been, in a moment,
  turned into stone: stopped with my lips parted, my very breathing arrested,
  clutching at the book under my arm, with no sign of life or movement save the
  tumultuous thumping of my heart. There was what seemed an interminable pause,
  and then my father replied: "Hardly, I think, Otway. Technically, perhaps, it
  amounts to a misdemeanour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Technically!" repeated Mr. Otway.</p>

  <p>"Yes, technically. The absence of any intent to defraud modifies the
  position considerably. Still, for the purpose of argument, we may admit that
  it amounts to a misdemeanour."</p>

  <p>"And," said Mr. Otway, "the maximum punishment of that misdemeanour is
  seven years' penal servitude. As to your plea of absence of fraudulent
  intent, you, as a lawyer of experience, must know well that judges are not
  apt to be very sympathetic with trustees who misappropriate property placed
  in their custody."</p>

  <p>"Misappropriate!" my father exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Otway, I say misappropriate. What other word could you apply?
  Here is a sum of money which has been placed in your custody. I come here
  with the intention to receive that money from you on behalf of the trustees,
  and you tell me that you haven't got it. You are not only unable to produce
  it, but you are unable to give any date on which you could produce it. And
  meanwhile it seems that you have applied it to your own uses."</p>

  <p>"I haven't spent it," my father objected. "The money is locked up for the
  present, but it isn't lost."</p>

  <p>"What is the use of saying that?" demanded Mr. Otway. "You haven't got the
  money, and you can't give any satisfactory account of it. The plain English
  of it is that you have used this trust money for your own private purposes,
  and that when the trustors ask to have it restored to them, you are unable to
  produce it."</p>

  <p>To this my father made no immediate reply; and in the silence that ensued
  I could hear my heart throbbing and the blood humming in the veins of my
  neck. At length my father asked: "Well, Otway, what are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"Do!" repeated Mr. Otway. "What can I do? As a trustee, it is my duty to
  get this money from you. I have to protect the interests of those whom I
  represent. And if you have misapplied these funds&mdash;well, you must see
  for yourself that I have no choice."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you'll prosecute?"</p>

  <p>"What else can I do? I can't introduce personal considerations into the
  business of a trust; and even if I should decline to move in the matter, the
  trustors themselves would undoubtedly take action."</p>

  <p>Here there followed a silence which seemed to me of endless duration; then
  Mr. Otway said, in a somewhat different tone: "There is just one way for you
  out of this mess, Vardon."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said my father.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I am going to make you a proposal, and I may as well put it quite
  bluntly. It is this. I am prepared to take over your liabilities, for the
  time being, on condition that I marry your daughter. If you agree, then on
  the day on which the marriage takes place, I pay into your bank the sum of
  five thousand pounds, you giving me an undertaking to repay the loan if and
  when you can."</p>

  <p>"Have you any reason to suppose that my daughter wishes to marry you?" my
  father asked.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest," replied Mr. Otway; "but I think it probable that, if
  the case were put to her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is not going to be," my father interrupted. "I would rather go to gaol
  than connive at the sacrifice of my daughter's happiness."</p>

  <p>"You might have thought of her happiness a little sooner, Vardon," Mr.
  Otway remarked. "We are not quite of an age, but she might easily find it
  more agreeable to be the wife of an elderly man than the daughter of a
  convict. At any rate, it would be only fair to give her the choice."</p>

  <p>"It would be entirely unfair," my father retorted. "In effect, it would be
  asking her to make the sacrifice, and she might be fool enough to consent.
  And please bear in mind, Otway, that I am not a convict yet, and possibly may
  never be one. There are certain conceivable alternatives, you know."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Mr. Otway, "if you have resources that you have not mentioned,
  that is quite another matter. I understood that you had none. And as to
  sacrifice, there is no need to harp on that string so persistently. Your
  daughter might be happy enough as my wife."</p>

  <p>"What infernal nonsense you are talking!" my father exclaimed,
  impatiently. "Do you suppose that Helen is a fool?"</p>

  <p>"No, I certainly do not," Mr. Otway replied.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then: what do you mean by her being happy as your wife? Here
  am I, standing over a mine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of your own laying," interrupted Mr. Otway.</p>

  <p>"Quite so; of my own laying. And here you come with a lighted match and
  say to my daughter, in effect: 'My dear young lady, I am your devoted lover.
  Be my wife&mdash;consent this very instant or I fire this mine and blow you
  and your father to smithereens.' And then, you think, she would settle down
  with you and live happy ever after. By the Lord, Otway, you must be a
  devilish poor judge of character."</p>

  <p>"I am quite willing to take the risk," said Mr. Otway.</p>

  <p>"So you may be," my father retorted angrily, "but I'm not. I would rather
  see the poor girl in her grave than know that she was chained for life to a
  cold-blooded, blackmailing scoundrel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Softly, Vardon!" Mr. Otway interrupted. "There is no need for that sort
  of language. And perhaps we had better shut the door."</p>

  <p>Here, as I drew back hastily into the book-room, quick footsteps crossed
  the study floor and I heard the door close. The interruption brought me back
  to some sense of my position; though, to be sure, what I had overheard
  concerned me as much as it concerned anyone. Quickly slipping the book back
  on the shelf, I ran on tip-toe past the study door and up the stairs; and
  even then I was none too soon; for, as I halted on the threshold of my room,
  the study door opened again and the two men strode across the hail.</p>

  <p>"You are taking a ridiculously wrong-headed view of the whole affair," I
  heard Mr. Otway declare.</p>

  <p>"Possibly," my father replied, stiffly. "And if I do, I am prepared to
  take the consequences."</p>

  <p>"Only the consequences won't fall on you alone," said Mr. Otway.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon," was the dry and final response. Then the hall door
  slammed, and I heard my father walk slowly back to the study.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-02"
     id="ch-1-02"></a>II. &mdash; ATRA CURA</h2>

  <p class="first">As the study door closed, I sank into my easy chair with a
  sudden feeling of faintness and bodily exhaustion. The momentary shock of
  horror and amazement had passed, giving place to a numb and chilly dread that
  made me feel sick and weak. Scraps of the astounding conversation that I had
  heard came back to me, incoherently and yet with hideous distinctness, like
  the whisperings of some malignant spirit. Disjointed words and phrases
  repeated themselves again and again, almost meaninglessly, but still with a
  vague undertone of menace.</p>

  <p>And then, by degrees, as I sat gazing at the blurred pages of the book
  that still lay open on the reading-stand, my thoughts grew less chaotic; the
  words of that dreadful dialogue arranged themselves anew, and I began with
  more distinctness to gather their meaning.</p>

  <p>Seven years penal servitude!</p>

  <p>That was the dreadful refrain of this song of doom that was being chanted
  in my ear by the Spirit of Misfortune. And ruin&mdash;black, hideous
  ruin&mdash;for my father and me was the burden of that refrain; no mere loss,
  no paltry plunge into endurable poverty, but a descent into the bottomless
  pit of social degradation, from which there could be no hope of
  resurrection.</p>

  <p>Nor was this the worst. For, gradually, as my thoughts began to arrange
  themselves into a coherent sequence, I realised that it was not the implied
  poverty and social disgrace that gave to that sentence its dreadful import.
  Poverty might be overcome, and disgrace could be endured; but when I thought
  of my father dragged away from me to be cast into gaol; when, in my mind's
  eye, I saw him clothed in the horrible livery of shame, wearing out his life
  within the prison walls and behind the fast-bolted prison doors; the thought
  and the imagined sight were unendurable. It was death&mdash;for him at least;
  for he was not a strong man. And for me?</p>

  <p>Here, of a sudden, there came back to me the rather enigmatical speech of
  my father's, which I had heard without at the moment fully comprehending, but
  which I now recalled with a shock of alarm.</p>

  <p>"Please bear in mind, Otway, that I am not a convict yet, and possibly may
  never be one. There are certain conceivable alternatives, you know."</p>

  <p>The cryptic utterance had evidently puzzled Mr. Otway, who had clearly
  misunderstood it as referring to some unknown resources. To me, no such
  misunderstanding was possible. More than once my father had discussed with me
  the ethics of suicide, on which subject he held somewhat unorthodox opinions;
  and I now recalled with terrible distinction the very definite statement that
  he had made on the occasion of our last talks "For my part," he had said, "if
  I should ever find myself in such a position that the continuance of life was
  less desirable than its termination, I should not hesitate to take the
  appropriate measures for exchanging the less desirable state for the more
  desirable."</p>

  <p>In the face of such a statement, made, as I felt sure, in all sincerity
  and with sober judgment, how could I entertain any doubt as to the
  interpretation of that reference to "certain conceivable alternatives?" To a
  man of culture and some position and none too robust in health, what would be
  the aspect of life with its immediate future occupied by a criminal
  prosecution ending in an inevitable conviction and a term of penal servitude?
  Could the continuance of such a life be conceived as desirable? Assuredly
  not.</p>

  <p>And then imagination began to torture me by filling in with hideous
  ingenuity the dreadful details. Now it was a pistol shot, heard in the night,
  and a group of terrified servants huddled together in the corridor. But no;
  that was not like my poor father. Such crude and bloody methods appertain
  rather to the terror-stricken fugitive than to one who is executing a
  considered and orderly retreat. Then I saw myself, in the grey of the
  morning, tapping at his bedroom door: tapping&mdash;tapping&mdash;and at last
  opening the door, or perhaps bursting it open. I saw the dim room &mdash;Oh!
  How horribly plain and vivid it was! With the cold light of the dawn
  glimmering through the blind, the curtained bed, the half-seen figure, still
  and silent in the shadow. Horrible! Horrible!</p>

  <p>And then, in instant, the scene changed. I saw a man in our hall a man in
  uniform; a railway porter or inspector. I heard him tell, in a hushed,
  embarrassed voice, of a strange and dreadful accident down on the line...And
  yet again this awful phantasmagoria shifted the scene and showed me a new
  picture: a search party, prowling with lantern around a chalk pit; and anon a
  group of four men, treading softly and carrying something on a hurdle.</p>

  <p>"Dear God!" I gasped, with my hands pressed to my forehead, "must I
  be&mdash;this awful thing! Is there no other way?"</p>

  <p>And with that there fell on me a great calm. A chilly calm, bringing no
  comfort, and yet, in a manner, a relief. For, perhaps, after all, there was
  another way. It was true that my father had rejected Mr. Otway's proposal,
  and such was my habit of implicit obedience that, with his definite rejection
  of it, the alternative had, for me, ceased to exist. But now, with the horror
  of this dreadful menace upon me, I recalled the words that had been spoken,
  and asked myself if that avenue of escape were really closed. As to my
  father, I had no doubt; he would never consent; and even to raise the
  question might only be to precipitate the catastrophe. But with regard to Mr.
  Otway the manner in which my father had met and rejected his proposal seemed
  to close the subject finally. He had called him a blackmailing scoundrel and
  used other injurious expressions, which might make it difficult or, at least,
  uncomfortable to reopen the question. Still that was a small matter. When one
  is walking to the gallows, one does not boggle at an uncomfortable shoe.</p>

  <p>As to my own inclinations, they were beside the mark. My father's life and
  good name must be saved if it were possible; and it seemed that it might be
  possible&mdash;at a price. Whether it were possible or not depended on Mr.
  Otway.</p>

  <p>I recalled what I knew of this man who had thus in a moment become the
  arbiter of my father's fate and mine. My acquaintance with him was but
  slight, though I had met him pretty frequently and had sometimes wondered
  what his profession was, if he had any. I had assumed, from his evident
  acquaintance with legal matters, that he was a lawyer. But he was not in
  ordinary practice; and his business, whatever it was, seemed to involve a
  good deal of travelling. That was all I knew about him. As to his appearance,
  he was a huge, unwieldy man of a somewhat Jewish cast of face, some years
  older, I should think, than my father; pleasant spoken and genial in a
  somewhat heavy fashion, but quite uninteresting. Hitherto I had neither liked
  nor disliked him. Now, it need hardly be said, I regarded him with decided
  aversion; for if he were not, as my father had said, "a blackmailing
  scoundrel," he had, at any rate, taken the meanest, the most ungenerous
  advantage of my father's difficulties, to say nothing of the callous, cynical
  indifference that he had shown in regard to me and my wishes and
  interests.</p>

  <p>It may seem a little odd that I found myself attaching no blame to my
  father. Yet so it was. To me he appeared as merely the victim of
  circumstances. No doubt he had done something indiscreet&mdash;perhaps
  incorrect But discretion and correctness are not qualities that appeal to a
  woman: whereas generosity&mdash;and my father was generous almost to a
  fault&mdash;makes the most powerful appeal to feminine sympathies. As to his
  honesty and good faith, I never doubted them for an instant; besides, he had
  plainly said that no fraudulent intent could be ascribed to him. What he had
  done I had not the least idea. Nor did I particularly care. It was not the
  act, but it consequences with which I was concerned.</p>

  <p>My meditations were interrupted at length by an apologetic tap at the
  door, followed by the appearance of our housemaid.</p>

  <p>"If you please, Miss Helen, shall I take Mr. Vardon's tea to the study, or
  is he going to have it with you?"</p>

  <p>The question brought me back from the region of tragedy and disaster in
  which my thoughts had been straying, to the homely commonplaces of everyday
  life.</p>

  <p>"I'll just run down and ask him, Jessie," I answered; "and you needn't
  wait. I'll come and tell you what he says."</p>

  <p>I ran quickly down the stairs, but at the study door I paused with a
  sudden revival of those terrors that had so lately assailed me. Suppose he
  should open the subject and have something dreadful to tell me? Or suppose
  that, even now, already&mdash;At the half-formed thought, I raised a
  trembling hand, and, tapping lightly at the door, opened it and entered. He
  was sitting at the table with a small pile of sealed and stamped letters
  before him, and, as I stood, steadying my hand on the door knob, he looked up
  with his customary smile of friendly welcome.</p>

  <p>"Hail! O Dame of the azure hosen," said he, swinging round on his
  revolving chair, "and how fares it with our liege lady, Queen Anne?"</p>

  <p>"She is quite well, thank you," I replied.</p>

  <p>"The Lord be praised!" he rejoined. "I seemed to have heard some rumour of
  her untimely decease. A mere canard, it would seem; a fiction of these
  confounded newspaper men. Or perchance I have been misled by the jocose and
  boisterous Lecky."</p>

  <p>The whimsical playfulness of speech, habitual as it was to him, impressed
  me&mdash;perhaps for that very reason&mdash;with a vague uneasiness. It was
  not what I had expected after that terrible conversation. The anti-climax to
  my own tragic thoughts was too sudden; the descent to the ordinary too
  uncomfortably steep. I perched myself on his knee, as I often did, despite my
  rather excessive size, and passed my hand over his thin, grey hair.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," I said, clinging desperately to the common-place, "that you
  are going bald? I can see the skin of your head quite plainly."</p>

  <p>"And why not?" he demanded. "Did you think my hair grew out of my cranium?
  But you won't see it long. I've heard of an infallible hair-restorer."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed! Guaranteed to grow a crop of ringlets on a bladder of lard.
  We'll get a bottle and try it on the carpet broom; and if the result is
  satisfactory&mdash;well, we'll just put Esau in his place in the second
  row."</p>

  <p>"You are a very frivolous old person, Mr. Pater," said I. "Do you know
  that?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," he replied. "And again I say, why not? When a man is too old
  to play the fool, it is time to carry him to the bone-yard. Am I going to
  have any tea?</p>

  <p>"Of course you are. Will you have it here alone or shall we have tea
  together?"</p>

  <p>"What a question!" he exclaimed. "Am I in my dotage? Should I drink tea in
  musty solitude when I might bask in the smiles of a lovely maiden? Avaunt!
  No, I'll tell you what we'll do, Jimmy. I'll just telephone down to the
  office and see if there is any silly nonsense there that may distract me from
  serious pursuits, and, if there isn't, we'll have tea in the workroom and
  then we'll polish off that coal-scuttle."</p>

  <p>"Finish it! But there's quite a lot to do."</p>

  <p>"Then we'll do the lot."</p>

  <p>"But why this hurry? There's no particular reason for getting it finished
  to-night, is there?</p>

  <p>"I don't know that there is; but we've had the thing hanging about long
  enough. Better get it finished and start on something else. Now you trot off
  and see about tea while I ring up Jackson."</p>

  <p>As he turned to the telephone, I hurried away to give instructions to the
  maid and to set the workshop in order so that we might start without delay on
  our evening's task, concerning which a few words of explanation would seem to
  be called for.</p>

  <p>My father was by nature designed to be a craftsman. He was never so happy
  as when he was making something or in some way working with his hands; and
  remarkably skilful hands they were, with an inborn capacity for the dexterous
  manipulation of every kind of material, tool or appliance. And to his natural
  skill he had added a vast amount of knowledge of methods and processes. He
  was an excellent woodworker, an admirable mechanic, and a quite passable
  potter. Our house abounded in the products of his industry; stools,
  cupboards, clocks, fenders, earthen ware jars; even our bicycles had been
  built, or, at least, "assembled" by him, and a bronze knocker on our door had
  been finished by him from castings made in our workshop. If his powers of
  design had been equal to his manual skill, he would have been a first-class
  art craftsman. Unfortunately they were not. Left to himself, his tendency was
  to aim at a neat trade finish, at smooth surfaces and mechanical precision.
  But he knew his limitations, and had been at great pains to have me
  instructed in the arts of design; and, as I apparently had some natural
  aptitude in that direction, I was able to help him by making sketches and
  working drawings and by criticising the work as it progressed. But my duties
  did not stop at that. In our happy, united life, I was his apprentice, his
  journeyman, his assistant&mdash;or foreman, as he pleased to call
  me&mdash;and his constant companion, in the house, in the workshop, and in
  our walks abroad.</p>

  <p>As our maid, Jessie, laid the tea-tray on a vacant corner of the
  work-bench, I examined our latest joint-production, a bronze coal-scuttle,
  the design of which was based on a Roman helmet that I had seen in the
  British Museum. There was a good deal more than an ordinary evening's work to
  be done before it could be finished. A portion of the embossed ornament on
  the foot required touching up, the foot itself had to be brazed to the body
  and the handle had to be riveted to the lugs, to say nothing of the
  "pickling," scouring, and oxidizing. It was a colossal evening's work.</p>

  <p>But it was not the magnitude of the task that troubled me, for I shared my
  father's love of manual work. What had instantly impressed me with a vague
  discomfort was the urgency of my father's desire to get this piece of work
  finished and done with. That was not like him at all. Not only had he the
  genuine craftsman's inexhaustible patience, but he had a habit of keeping an
  apparently finished work on hand, that he might tinker at it lovingly, smooth
  and polish it, and bring it to a state of even greater completeness and
  finish.</p>

  <p>Why, then, this strange urgency and impatience? And, as I asked myself the
  question, all my fears came crowding back on me. Again there came that
  dreadful sinking at the heart, that strangling terror of the storm-cloud that
  hung over us, unseen but ready to burst and overwhelm us in ruin at any
  moment.</p>

  <p>But I had little time for these gloomy and disquieting thoughts. The
  tinkling of the telephone bell in the study told me that my father had
  finished his talk with his managing clerk, and a few moments later he strode
  into the workshop and began taking off his coat.</p>

  <p>"Where's your apron, Jimmy?" he asked (the pet name "Jimmy" had been
  evolved out of an ancient fiction that my name was Jemima).</p>

  <p>"There's no hurry, Pater, dear," said I. "Let a person have her tea in
  peace. And do sit down like a Christian man."</p>

  <p>He obediently perched himself on a stool as I handed him his tea, but in
  less than a minute he was on his feet again, prowling, cup in hand, around
  the end of the bench where the work lay.</p>

  <p>"Wonder if I'd better anneal it a bit," he mused, picking up the bronze
  foot and examining the unfinished space. "Mustn't make it too soft. Think I
  will, though. We can hammer it up a little on the stake after it's brazed on.
  That will harden it enough."</p>

  <p>He laid the foot down, but only that he might apply a match to the great
  gas blowpipe; and I watched him with a sinking heart as he stood with his
  teacup in one hand, while with the other he held the foot, gripped in a pair
  of tongs, in the roaring purple flame. What did it mean, this strange,
  restless haste to finish what was, after all, but a work of pleasure? Did it
  portend some change that he saw more clearly than I? Was he, impelled by the
  craftsman's instinct, turning in this fashion a page of the book of life? Or
  was it&mdash;Oh! dreadful thought!&mdash;was it that he was deliberately
  writing "Finis" before closing the volume?</p>

  <p>But whatever was in his secret mind, he chatted cheerfully as he worked,
  and submitted to be fed with scraps of bread and butter and to have cups of
  tea administered at intervals; yet still I noted that the chasing hammer flew
  at unwonted speed, and the depth of the punch-marks on the work that rested
  on the sand-bag told of an unusual weight in the blows.</p>

  <p>"What a pity it is," he remarked, "that social prejudices prevent a
  middle-class man from earning a livelihood with his hands. Now, here I am, a
  third-rate solicitor perforce, whereas, if I followed my bent, I should be a
  first-rate coppersmith. Shouldn't I?"</p>

  <p>"Quite first-rate," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Or even a silversmith," he continued, "if I could have my mate, Jim, to
  do the art with a capital A while I did the work with a capital W. Hm?"</p>

  <p>He looked up at me with a twinkle, and I took the opportunity to pop a
  piece of bread and butter into his mouth, which occasioned a pause in the
  conversation.</p>

  <p>I had entertained faint&mdash;very faint&mdash;hopes that he might say
  something to me about his difficulties. Not that I was inquisitive on the
  subject; but, in view of a resolution that was slowly forming in my mind, I
  should have liked to have some idea what his position really was. It seemed
  pretty plain, however, that he did not intend to take me into his confidence;
  notwithstanding which I decided in a tentative way to give him an
  opening.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't that Mr. Otway who was with you this afternoon?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "How did you know?"</p>

  <p>"I heard his voice in the hall as you let him out," I answered, with
  something of a gulp at the implied untruth.</p>

  <p>The chasing hammer was arrested for a moment in mid air, and, as my
  father's eye fixed itself reflectively on the punch that he held, I could see
  that he was trying to remember what Mr. Otway had said in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, after a brief pause, "it was Mr. Otway. I should hardly
  have thought you would have known his voice. Queer fellow, Otway. No brains
  to speak of, but yet an excellent man of business in his way."</p>

  <p>"What does he do&mdash;by way of profession, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"The Lord knows. He was originally a solicitor, but he hasn't practised
  for years. Now he is what is called a financier, which is a little vague, but
  apparently profitable. And I think he does something in the way of precious
  stones."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that he deals in them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, occasionally; at least, so I have heard. I know that he is something
  of a connoisseur in stones, and that he had a collection, which he sold some
  time ago. I have also heard&mdash;and I believe it is a fact&mdash;that his
  name was originally Levy, and that he is one of the Chosen. But why he
  changed his name I have no notion, unless it was an undesirable one to
  present to the financial world."</p>

  <p>I was half disposed to pursue my enquiries further, but as he finished
  speaking, he once more began to ply the hammer with such furious energy that
  I became quite uneasy.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't exert yourself so much, Pater," I remarked. "Remember what
  Dr. Sharpe said."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" he replied. "Sharpe is an old woman. My heart is sound enough. At
  any rate, it will last as long as the rest of me. An old fellow like me
  cannot expect to go in for sprinting or high jumping, but there's no need for
  him to live in splints and cotton wool."</p>

  <p>"Nor to endanger his health by perfectly unnecessary exertion. Why on
  earth are you in such a fever to get this thing finished?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not in a fever, my dear," he answered; "I'm only tired of seeing this
  thing lying about unfinished. You see, as it stands, it is only so many
  pounds of old bronze, whereas a couple of hours' work turns it into a
  valuable piece of furniture, fit to take a dignified place in the catalogue
  when we are sold up. Just consider how finely it would read:</p>

  <p>"'Handsome bronze scuttle, in form of Roman helmet, the work of the late
  owner and his charming and talented daughter, capable of serving either as a
  convenient receptacle for coal or as a becoming head-dress for a person with
  a suitable cranium.' Don't you think that would sound rather alluring?"</p>

  <p>"Very," I replied; "but as we are not going to be sold up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The rest of my sentence was drowned in the din of the beaten metal as my
  father returned to his hammering, and I only watched in mute discomfort until
  this part of the work was done and the great brazing jet was once more set
  a-roaring.</p>

  <p>The work progressed apace, for my father was not only skilful and neat,
  but could be very quick on occasion; and as I watched the completion of stage
  after stage, I was conscious of a growing uneasiness, a vague fear of seeing
  the work actually finished; as if this mere toy&mdash;for it was little
  more&mdash;held some deep and tragic symbolism. I felt like one looking on at
  the slow wasting of one of those waxen effigies which the sorceresses of old
  prepared with magical rites for the destruction of some victim, whose life
  should slowly wane and flicker away with the wasting of the wax.</p>

  <p>And meanwhile, above the roar of the blowpipe flame, my father's voice
  sounded, now in a cheerful stave of song, and now in lively jest or playful
  badinage. But yet he did not deceive me. Behind all this show of high spirits
  was a sombre background that was never quite hidden. For the eye of love is
  very keen and can see plainly, despite quip or joke or jovial carol, when
  "Black Care rides behind the horseman."</p>

  <p>What a miserable affair it was, this pitiful acting of two poor,
  leaden-hearted mortals, each hiding from each the desperate resolve with
  smiles and jests that were more bitter than tears! For I, too, had now my
  secret, and must needs preserve it with such a show of gaiety as I could
  muster by sheer effort of will. The resolution of which I have spoken was
  growing&mdash;growing, even as the toy that we were making was growing
  towards completion, and as I seemed to see, as if symbolized by it, the sands
  of destiny trickling out before my eyes. So I, too, had my part to play in
  this harrowing comedy.</p>

  <p>Works which have consumed much time in the doing have a way of coming to
  an end with disconcerting suddenness. When I mixed the acid for the "pickle"
  in the great earthenware pan, it seemed that a great deal still remained to
  be done, in spite of my father's feverish energy and swift dexterity. And
  then, but a few minutes later, as it appeared to me, behold the finished
  piece standing on the bench its embossed ornament telling boldly against the
  sulphur-browned background, and my father stretching himself and wiping the
  blackened oil from his hands; and it was borne in on me that, with the final
  touch, his interest in the thing had fallen dead.</p>

  <p>"Nunc dimittis!" he murmured. "It's finished at last. 'Now lettest Thou
  Thy servant depart in peace.' And that reminds me, Jim; don't the shops keep
  open late to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Some of them do," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Good," said he. "Tell Jessie to bring up the supper while I'm washing.
  I've got to make a business call to-night, and I want to get some things, so
  we won't make it a ceremonious meal. Not that I want to put you on short
  allowance, for I expect you are hungry after your Titanic labours. You
  mustn't take any notice of me."</p>

  <p>As he hurried away, I rang the bell, and, when I had given the necessary
  instructions, I went up to my bedroom to remove the traces of the evening's
  work and make myself presentable.</p>

  <p>At the supper table my father preserved the same quiet gaiety of
  manner&mdash;his usual manner, in fact; for he was always cheerful and
  companionable&mdash;though, on this occasion, the speed with which he
  disposed of his food gave little opportunity for conversation. After a very
  hurried meal, he rose, and, pushing back his chair, glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't mind my running away," said he. "Time, tide and the
  shopkeeper wait for no man."</p>

  <p>He moved away toward the door, but before he reached it he paused and then
  came back and stood beside my chair.</p>

  <p>"You need'nt sit up for me," he said. "I may possibly be rather late. So
  I'd better say 'good-night' now.'" He took my head in his hands, and, looking
  earnestly into my eyes, murmured: "Dear little Jim; best and most loyal of
  apprentices." Then he kissed me very tenderly and passed his hands over my
  hair.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, sweetheart," said he. "Don't sit up reading, but go to bed
  early like a sensible girlie&mdash;if you will pardon my thopping into
  Weggish poetry without notice."</p>

  <p>He turned away and walked quickly to the door, where he stood for a moment
  to wave his hand. I heard him go to the study, and sat stiffly in my chair
  listening. In a few moments he came out and stepped quietly across the hail;
  there was a brief pause, and then the outer door closed.</p>

  <p>He was gone.</p>

  <p>At the sound of the closing door, I sprang to my feet with all my terrors
  revived. Whither had he gone? It was unusual for him to leave his home at
  night. What was it that had taken him abroad on this night of all others? And
  what was it that he wanted to buy? And wanted so urgently that he could not
  wait until the morrow? And why had he wished me "good-night" with such tender
  earnestness? A foolish question, this, for he was a loving father, and never
  sought to veil his affection. But to-night I was unstrung; haunted by
  nameless fears that gave a dreadful significance to every passing incident.
  And as the chill of mortal terror crept round my heart, the resolution that
  had been growing&mdash;growing, came to its final completion.</p>

  <p>It had to be. Horrible, loathsome as, even then, I felt it to be, it was
  the only alternative to that other nameless and unthinkable. The sacrifice
  must be made by us both for both our sakes&mdash;if it were not too late
  already.</p>

  <p>Too late? Even as the dreadful thought smote like a hammer on my heart, I
  ran from the room and sped up the stairs on the wings of terror. With
  trembling fingers I took my hat and cloak from the wardrobe and hurried down
  stairs, putting them on as I went. At the dining-room door I called out a
  hasty message to the maid, and then, snatching up my gloves from the hall
  table, I opened the door and ran out into darkness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-03"
     id="ch-1-03"></a>III. &mdash; THE COVENANT</h2>

  <p class="first">As I sped swiftly along the quiet roads on the outskirts of
  the town the confusion and sense of helplessness began to subside under the
  influence of action and a definite purpose; by degrees my thoughts clarified,
  and I found myself shaping out, with surprising deliberation and judgment,
  the course that I intended to pursue. Mr. Otway's house was about a mile
  distant from ours, somewhat farther out of town, though on a frequented road;
  a short distance and quickly covered by my flying feet. Yet, short as it was,
  and traversed with a phantom of terror in close pursuit, it gave me time to
  collect my faculties, so that, when I opened the gate and walked up the
  little drive, I had already to a large extent recovered my self-possession,
  though I was still trembling with the fear of what might be happening else
  where at this very moment.</p>

  <p>The door was opened by a small frail-looking woman of about fifty, who did
  not look quite like an ordinary servant, and whose appearance instantly
  impressed me disagreeably. She stood with her face slightly averted, looking
  at me out of the corners of her eyes, and holding the door open as she asked,
  with a slight Scotch accent:</p>

  <p>"Who would you be wanting?"</p>

  <p>"I wish to see Mr. Otway, if he is at home?" I replied.</p>

  <p>"If ye'll come in and give me your name, I'll tell him," said she; and
  with this she showed me into a small room that opened out of the hall, where,
  when I had told her my name, she left me. In less than a minute Mr. Otway
  entered, and having carefully closed the door, shook hands gravely and
  offered me a chair.</p>

  <p>"This is quite an unexpected pleasure, Miss Vardon," said he. "Oddly
  enough, I was just thinking about you. I called on your father only this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"I know," said I. "It was about that that I came to see you."</p>

  <p>"Your father, then," said Mr. Otway, "has mentioned to you the subject of
  our not entirely pleasant interview?"</p>

  <p>"No, he has not," I replied. "Nothing has passed between us on the
  subject, and he is not aware that I have come here. The fact is, I overheard
  a part of your conversation and made it my business to hear as much of the
  rest as I could."</p>

  <p>"Ha! Indeed!" He gave me a quick glance, half enquiring, half suspicious,
  and added: "Perhaps, Miss Vardon, you had better tell me what you heard."</p>

  <p>"There is no need for me to repeat it in detail," said I; "but, from what
  I heard, I gathered that my father had rendered himself liable to a
  prosecution. Is that correct?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Otway, "that is unfortunately&mdash;most
  unfortunately&mdash;the case."</p>

  <p>"And that the proceedings will be taken by you, and that you have the
  power to stay them if you choose?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't put it that way, Miss Vardon. That hardly states the position
  fairly. Do you know nothing of the circumstances at all? Has your father not
  told you any thing about this unfortunate affair?"</p>

  <p>"He has not spoken a word to me on the subject, and he has no idea that I
  know anything about it."</p>

  <p>"H'm," Mr. Otway grunted, reflectively. "Yes. Well, Miss Vardon, if you
  wish to talk the matter over with me, perhaps I had better just let you know
  how the land lies, although, really, your father is the proper person to tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"I think you had better tell me, if you don't mind," said I.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Miss Vardon," he agreed. "Then the position is this: A sum of
  money&mdash;five thousand pounds, to be exact&mdash;was handed to your father
  by the trustees of a certain estate, to be invested by him on behalf of the
  trust; and the manner of its disposal&mdash;into which we need not
  enter&mdash;was quite clearly specified. But your father, instead of
  disposing of the money as directed, chose to make over the whole of it as a
  loan to a friend of his who was in temporary difficulties; a manufacturer, as
  I understand, who had suffered an unexpected loss and was on the verge of
  bankruptcy. There was no proper security, nor even, as I understand, any
  satisfactory arrangement as to the payment of interest. The whole affair was
  most improper; a gross violation of trust. In effect, your father converted
  this money and made use of it for his own purposes."</p>

  <p>"Is the money lost?" I enquired.</p>

  <p>Mr. Otway shrugged his shoulders. "Who can say? It may be recoverable some
  day, or it may not. But that is very little to the point. The position is
  that it is now demanded of your father and that he can't produce it."</p>

  <p>"And so you are going to prosecute him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, please don't put it that way, Miss Vardon. I am a quite involuntary
  agent. My position is that I am instructed to get this money from your father
  and dispose of it in a particular way. But I can't get it; and when I report
  that fact, I shall, of course, be urged&mdash;in fact, compelled&mdash;to
  take criminal proceedings. I shall have no choice. It isn't my money, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"But why criminal proceedings?" I asked. "It seems to me that a civil
  action to recover the money would be the natural course."</p>

  <p>Again Mr. Otway shrugged his shoulders. "I don't see that it makes much
  difference," said he. "The money has been made away with. Even if the
  trustees took no criminal action, there is the Public Prosecutor and there is
  the Incorporated Law Society. A prosecution is inevitable."</p>

  <p>"And supposing my father is convicted?"</p>

  <p>"It is hardly necessary to suppose," said Mr. Otway. "He will be. There is
  no defence. As to the sentence, I don't imagine that the maximum punishment
  of seven years penal servitude is likely to be inflicted. Still, your father
  is a solicitor, and the law is, quite properly, very severe in the case of
  solicitors who misappropriate their clients' property. He is almost certain
  to get a term of imprisonment."</p>

  <p>To this I made no reply. There was nothing to say. It was only too clear
  that every avenue of escape was closed&mdash;save one; and realizing more
  fully every moment where that one led, I could not bring myself to make the
  fateful move. So, for a while, we sat in a hideous silence through which the
  ticking of a clock penetrated noisily and seemed to keep pace with the
  thumping of my heart.</p>

  <p>As I sat, bracing myself for the effort that had to be made, my eyes
  travelled, half unconsciously, over the person of my companion. His
  appearance was not prepossessing. Huge, unwieldy and shapeless, although by
  no means grossly fat, his great size carried no dignity; nor did his very
  marked and prominent features impart to his face anything of distinction or
  nobility. He was of a distinctly oriental type, with black and rather curly
  hair, oiled and combed over a slightly bald head, a large aquiline nose, a
  wide mouth, rather full and fleshy, and very dark eyes, under which were
  baggy folds of skin creased by innumerable tiny wrinkles. As I looked at him
  with growing distaste, I found myself comparing him to a gigantic spider.
  Suddenly it was borne in on me&mdash;perhaps by the measured ticking of the
  clock&mdash;that time was passing: time which might be infinitely precious.
  To delay further were mere cowardice. Nevertheless, when I spoke, it was in a
  voice so husky that I had to stop and begin again.</p>

  <p>"You spoke, Mr. Otway&mdash;I heard you mention to my father
  that&mdash;that on certain conditions, you would&mdash;would be prepared to
  abandon your intention of prosecuting&mdash;Or, at least&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I could get no farther. Fear and shame and loathing of this thing that I
  was going to do, overpowered me utterly. It was only by the most strenuous
  effort that I choked down the sob that was rising in my throat. But I had
  said enough, for Mr. Otway now came to my assistance.</p>

  <p>"I told your father that I was prepared to take over his liabilities, for
  the time being, at least, on condition that you became my wife. He refused,
  as perhaps you know refused very definitely, I may say."</p>

  <p>"And rather rudely, I am afraid."</p>

  <p>"He was not at any great pains to wrap his refusal up delicately. But we
  may let that pass. Is it in respect of this proposal of mine that you have
  done me the very great honour of calling on me, Miss Vardon?"</p>

  <p>I felt myself turn scarlet, but nevertheless I answered, resolutely:</p>

  <p>"Yes. I came to ask if my father's very blunt refusal had closed the
  matter finally, or whether you were prepared to&mdash;to re-open it."</p>

  <p>"We won't talk about re-opening it. It was never closed, by me. The
  proposal that I made to your father I now make to you; and if you should see
  your way to accepting it, I believe you would never have occasion to regret
  your decision."</p>

  <p>He spoke in a dry, commercial tone, as if he were trying to sell me
  something at a rather high price; as, in fact, he was. And meanwhile I found
  myself wondering dimly why on earth he wanted to marry me.</p>

  <p>"May I ask," he continued, after a pause, "if you are disposed to
  entertain my proposal?</p>

  <p>"I would do anything to save my father," I replied.</p>

  <p>"That," said he, "is what I thought, judging from my previous knowledge of
  you; and it was the knowledge of your devotion to your father that encouraged
  me to make the proposal. For it seemed to me that a young lady of your
  attractions who could so completely devote herself to an elderly father might
  find it possible to devote herself to an elderly husband."</p>

  <p>His reasoning did not impress me as very sound, seeing that it took no
  account of the respective personalities of the father and the proposed
  husband. But I made no reply, and, after a further pause, he asked:</p>

  <p>"Am I to understand that you&mdash;that you regard my proposal
  favourably?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say that," I replied. "But I came here to-night prepared to
  accept your conditions, and I am ready to accept them now. But, of course,
  you understand that I do so under compulsion and not of my own free
  choice."</p>

  <p>"I quite realise that," said he; "but I take it that you will carry out
  fairly any covenant into which you may enter."</p>

  <p>"Certainly I shall," was my reply.</p>

  <p>"Then may I take it that you are willing to marry me, on the conditions
  that I named?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Otway. I consent to marry you on those conditions and on certain
  others that I will propose."</p>

  <p>"Let us hear the other conditions," said he.</p>

  <p>"The first is that you give me a promise in writing that, in consideration
  of my consent to marry you, you will do what is necessary to get my father
  out of his present difficulties."</p>

  <p>"That is quite fair, though it is rather unnecessary. I shouldn't want a
  convict for a father-in-law, you know. But, anyhow, I'll agree, as soon as
  the marriage is over, to pay into your father's bank a cheque for five
  thousand pounds, or, if he prefers it, to give him a full discharge for that
  amount. And I will give you an undertaking in writing to that effect before
  you leave here to-night. Will that do?"</p>

  <p>"It will do quite well," I answered. "But I wish you also to add to that
  undertaking a proviso to the effect that, if at any time before the marriage
  takes place, any circumstances shall arise by which your pecuniary help shall
  become unnecessary, then this agreement between you and me shall not take
  effect, and you shall have no claim of any kind on me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Otway looked at me in some surprise, and, indeed, I was somewhat
  surprised myself at the completeness with which my judgment and
  self-possession had revived as soon as it came to making terms; though I had
  considered the matter very carefully on my way to Mr. Otway's house.</p>

  <p>"You are a true lawyer's daughter, Miss Vardon," said he, with a somewhat
  wry smile. "You are not going to give yourself away gratis. No play, no pay,
  h'm? How ever, you are quite right. You agree to marry me for a certain
  consideration. If you don't receive the consideration, you don't marry me.
  Very well. That is a perfectly business-like proposition, and I agree to it.
  You think that perhaps your father may be able to meet his liabilities, after
  all?"</p>

  <p>"I do not think anything of the kind. The proviso was introduced by me in
  view of a very different contingency. I was making this sacrifice to save my
  father's life. If I failed in that, the sacrifice would be useless. But I did
  not think it necessary to mention this to Mr. Otway. I therefore replied
  that, as I knew very little about my father's affairs, I thought it wise to
  provide even against the improbable."</p>

  <p>"Quite so, Miss Vardon, quite so," he agreed. "One should always make
  provision for the unexpected. Well, I have said that I accept your first two
  conditions. What is the next one?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to write my father a letter which shall relieve him of all
  present anxieties, and I want you to give me that letter so that it may be
  delivered to-night."</p>

  <p>At this Mr. Otway's countenance fell somewhat. He pursed up his lips
  disapprovingly, and, after some moments of reflection, said gravely: "That,
  you know, Miss Vardon, really anticipates the fulfilment of the contract on
  my side. Such a letter would commit me to a withdrawal of my demand for
  immediate payment of this money."</p>

  <p>"But," said I, "you have my promise, which I am willing to give you in
  writing, if you wish me to."</p>

  <p>"Well," he replied, dubiously, "that would seem to meet the difficulty,
  not that I am suspecting you of trying to evade fufilment. But, you see, your
  father has refused his consent and will probably continue to refuse, so that
  one would rather not raise the question. By the way, I suppose you are over
  twenty-one?"</p>

  <p>"I was twenty-three last birthday."</p>

  <p>"Then, of course, his consent is not necessary. Still, one doesn't want a
  fuss; and if you delivered this letter to him, he would be in possession of
  the facts, and then there would be trouble."</p>

  <p>"I was not proposing to deliver it to him. I should drop it in the
  letter-box and let him think that you had sent or left it. He would know
  nothing of my visit to you or of the arrangement we have come to."</p>

  <p>"I see. That alters the position somewhat. But is it really necessary? I
  can understand your wish to relieve his anxiety; but still, it need be only a
  day or two. Do you really think it is essential?"</p>

  <p>"I do, Mr. Otway. I think it absolutely essential. If I had not, I should
  not have come here to-night. My father is in a desperate position, and one
  never knows what a desperate man may do."</p>

  <p>Mr. Otway gave me a quick glance, and I could see that he was considerably
  startled. The possibility at which I had hinted would have consequences for
  him as well as for me, and I saw that he fully realized this. But he did not
  answer hastily. Perhaps he saw more in my suggestion than I did myself. At
  any rate, he pondered for some seconds before he finally replied:</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right, Miss Vardon. I'm sure I shall be very glad to put
  an end to his suspense. Yes, I'll write the letter and give it to you. Are
  there any more conditions?"</p>

  <p>"No; that is all. So if you will write the letter and the agreement and
  draft out what you want me to say, we shall have done. And please make as
  much haste as you can. It is rather late, and I am anxious to get home before
  my father if possible."</p>

  <p>My anxiety apparently communicated itself to Mr. Otway, for he immediately
  swung his chair round to his desk, and, taking one or two sheets of paper
  from the rack, began to write rapidly. In two or three minutes he turned,
  and, handing me what he had written, together with a blank sheet of paper and
  a pen and ink-bottle, took a fresh sheet himself, and, without a word, began
  once more to write. The draft which he had handed me was simply and concisely
  worded as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I, Helen Vardon, of Stonebury, Maidstone, in the county of Kent,
  spinster, hereby promise to marry Lewis Otway, of the Beeches, Maidstone, in
  the county of Kent, attorney-at-law, within fourteen days from this present
  date, in consideration of his assuming the present liabilities of my father,
  William Henry Vardon, in respect of the estate of James Collis-Hardy
  deceased, this promise to be subject to the conditions set forth in a letter
  written to me by the said Lewis Otway and dated the 2 of April, 1908.</p>

  <p>"(Signed) HELEN VARDON. Maidstone, Kent. 21st April, 1908."</p>

  <p>I read the draft through carefully, noting that it was not only quite
  simple and lucid, but that it embodied the terms of our agreement with
  scrupulous fairness and took over my father's liabilities without any limit
  as to time; then I dipped the pen in the ink and made a fair copy on the
  blank sheet which I signed, and laid on the corner of the desk.</p>

  <p>By the time I had finished my copy, Mr. Otway had completed the first of
  the documents, which he now handed to me; and as I read it, he took up the
  paper that I had written, and, having glanced through it, placed it in a
  drawer and began once more to write. The paper that he had given to me was in
  the form of a letter, and read thus:</p>

  <p>"Dear Miss Vardon,</p>

  <p>"At your request I put on record the terms of the arrangement which has
  been made between us to-day, and which are:</p>

  <p>"1. That in consideration of my taking over your father's liabilities in
  respect of the Collis-Hardy Estate, you agree to marry me within fourteen
  days of this present date.</p>

  <p>"2. That on the completion of the marriage ceremony, or at such time
  thereafter as you may decide upon, I shall pay into your father's bank the
  sum of five thousand pounds, or, if he prefers it, give him a full discharge
  of all liabilities in respect of the Collis-Hardy Estate aforesaid.</p>

  <p>"3. Provided that if at any time prior to the said marriage your father
  shall discharge the said liabilities, or any circumstances shall arise by
  which the said payment or discharge by me shall become unnecessary, then the
  agreement between you and me which is herein recorded shall become void, and
  neither of us, the contracting parties, shall have any claim upon the
  other.</p>

  <p>"I am, dear Miss Vardon,</p>

  <p>"Your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>"LEWIS OTWAY.</p>

  <p>"Maidstone, Kent.</p>

  <p>"2 April, 1908."</p>

  <p>Mr Otway glanced up from his desk as I folded the paper and bestowed it in
  my purse, and asked: "Will that do? I think it covers the terms of our
  arrangement."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," I answered; "it will do quite well."</p>

  <p>He made no rejoinder, but went on with the letter that he was writing; and
  meanwhile I sat and watched him, with a strong distaste of his appearance,
  dimly wondering at this strange interview and at my own curious
  self-possession and mental alertness. But behind these hazy reflections was a
  background of haunting terror that had never quite faded even when I was
  putting the utmost strain upon my wits; terror lest all this bargaining
  should be useless after all; lest I should arrive home to find that my help
  had come too late.</p>

  <p>These disquieting thoughts were presently interrupted by Mr. Otway, who,
  laying down his pen and swinging round in his revolving chair, took up the
  letter that he had just written.</p>

  <p>"This is what I have said to your father, Miss Vardon. I think it will
  make his mind quite easy for the present, which is all we want.</p>

  <p>"'Dear Vardon,</p>

  <p>"'Since my talk with you this afternoon, I have been thinking over matters
  and considering whether it is not possible to give you more time. On looking
  into the affairs of the trust more closely, I think it can be done; in fact,
  I am sure it can, with some careful management on my part. So you may take it
  from me that the demand, which I felt compelled to make, is withdrawn for the
  time being. When you are in a position to surrender the money, you had better
  notify me; and in the meantime you have my assurance that no further demand
  will be made without reasonable notice.</p>

  <p>"'I hope this will relieve your natural anxiety, concerning which I have
  been a little uncomfortable since I left you.</p>

  <p>"'The Beeches.</p>

  <p>"'2 April, 1908.</p>

  <p>"'Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p>"'LEWIS OTWAY."</p>

  <p>He handed me the letter when he had finished reading, and I glanced
  through it quickly before returning it to him.</p>

  <p>"I think that ought to relieve him of all anxiety," said he.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered. "It will do admirably. And if you will kindly seal it
  and let me have it, I will go at once and drop it in the letter-box. It is
  most important that it should be in his hands as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," he agreed; "and I won't detain you further excepting to point
  out that, by giving you this letter, I am putting myself entirely in your
  hands. You will observe that this amounts to a surrender of my claim on your
  father for the time being. He will, of course, keep the letter, and could
  produce it in answer to any sudden demand for the restitution of the money.
  So I am really carrying out my part of the agreement in advance."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that," I replied, "and I thank you most sincerely; but," I
  added, rising and holding out my hand for the letter, "you have my solemn
  promise to carry out my part. If you were better acquainted with me, you
  would consider that enough."</p>

  <p>"But I do, Miss Vardon," he rejoined, hastily; "I do. If I did not trust
  you implicitly, I should not have written this letter. However, I mustn't
  delay you. I will make all the necessary arrangements and let you know when
  everything is ready. Will next Thursday be too soon?"</p>

  <p>At the mention of an actual date, and one so near, too, something like a
  complete realisation of what I was doing flashed into my mind and set my
  heart thumping painfully. But it had to be, so why haggle for terms? Nor,
  indeed, since it must be, was there any use in trying to put off the evil
  day. The urgent need of the moment was to get this letter into my father's
  hands, if it were not already too late.</p>

  <p>"I must leave the arrangement of the affair to you, Mr. Otway," I
  murmured, shakily. "Do as you think best. And now I must really go."</p>

  <p>He shook my hand in a drily courteous fashion and let me out, accompanying
  me down the drive to the outer gate, which he opened for me with a
  ceremonious bow. I wished him a hurried "good-night," and, as soon as I was
  outside the gate, ran off in the direction of home, holding the precious
  letter in the little pocket of my cloak.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-04"
     id="ch-1-04"></a>IV. &mdash; THE ELEVENTH HOUR</h2>

  <p class="first">As I drew near the neighbourhood of our house my fears grew
  so that I was compelled by sheer breathlessness and the trembling of my limbs
  to slacken my pace. I was sick with terror. In my mind, pictures, vague and
  nebulous but unspeakably dreadful, rose like the visions of a nightmare. I
  clutched the precious order of release in my pocket and set my teeth, trying
  not to think of what I might find at my journey's end.</p>

  <p>At last I came in sight of the house. It was all dark save two of the
  upper windows&mdash;those of the servants' bedrooms. The servants, then, were
  going to bed as usual, for ours was an early household. This seemed
  reassuring, but only to a slight degree; for even if&mdash;I opened the gate
  softly&mdash;I do not know why, but some how I instinctively avoided noise of
  any kind&mdash;and running up the garden path, let myself in quietly with my
  latch-key. With one quick and fearful glance around the darkened hall, I
  stole up to the hat-stand. Apparently my father had not yet come home, for
  his stick was not in the stand, and one of his hats was missing. I looked at
  the tall clock and noted that it was not yet half-past ten; I peered out
  through the open doorway, down the dark road, and listened awhile for the
  sound of footsteps; then, slipping the letter into the letter-box&mdash;which
  I could see contained no other missives&mdash;I lit one of the candles from
  the hall table, and, having peeped into the study, the book-room and the
  workshop, stole silently up the stairs.</p>

  <p>First, I went to my father's bedroom, and, by the glimmer of gas that the
  maid had left burning, and the light of my candle, inspected it narrowly. I
  looked over the trifles on the mantelpiece and on the dressing-table, and
  even opened the little medicine-cupboard to run my eye over the collection of
  bottles and boxes, pausing from time to time that I might listen for
  footsteps, strange or familiar, as Fate might decree. But pry as I would,
  there was nothing unusual, nothing on which the most eager suspicion might
  fasten. All the details of that room were familiar to me, for it had been my
  daily task since my girlhood to look them over and see that my father's
  orderly arrangements were not disturbed by the servants; and everything was
  in its place, and nothing new or strange or sinister had made its
  appearance.</p>

  <p>When I had finished my inspection, I stole softly along the corridor to my
  own bedroom, which was at the head of the stairs, and, turning up the gas,
  but leaving the door ajar, began slowly to undress, listening intently the
  while for any sounds that might confirm or dispel my fears. The house was
  very quiet and still; so quiet that the tinkle of the water, as I poured it
  out from the ewer, struck with disturbing harshness on my ear, and even the
  ticking of the little clock and my own slippered footfalls seemed an
  impertinent intrusion into that expectant silence.</p>

  <p>It was a few minutes past eleven when the sound of a latch-key and the
  gentle closing of the hall door sent the blood tingling to my very
  finger-tips. No footsteps had been audible on the garden path, but this, in
  itself, was characteristic; for my father and I were alike in that we both
  disliked noise and habitually moved about softly, avoiding the slamming of
  doors or the production in any way of jarring sounds.</p>

  <p>I crept on tip-toe to the door and listened. A stick was carefully put
  down in the hall-stand, and then I thought&mdash;but was not quite
  sure&mdash;that I heard my father unlock the letter-box. A few seconds later
  I caught a faint creak, which I recognised as proceeding from the study door,
  and, after a short interval, the creak was repeated and the door closed. Then
  the hall gas was turned out and soft footfalls began to ascend the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Pater, dear?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Is it I, indeed, O! wicked and disobedient child and likewise minx!" was
  the welcome answer. "Didn't I tell you to go to bed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you did; and I am going. But I thought I would like to see you
  safely home from your roysterings."</p>

  <p>"Mures rathi!" he exclaimed, as he came into the light from my open door.
  "It is poor old Queen Anne who has been keeping you out of your little nest.
  I know you."</p>

  <p>Here he gave a gentle tug at one of the tails into which I had plaited my
  hair, and, having kissed me on the tip of my nose, continued:</p>

  <p>"And you look as tired as the proverbial dog&mdash;which is the only kind
  of dog that ever does get tired. Now go to bed and sleep like a young
  dormouse. Good-night, Jimmy, dear."</p>

  <p>With the aid of the convenient tail, he drew my face to his and kissed me
  again; then he went off along the corridor singing very softly, but just
  audibly to me:</p>

  <p>"Her father he makes cabbage nets And in the streets does cry 'em; Her
  mother she sells laces long&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here a rapid diminuendo indicated the closing of the door, and the silence
  that had been so agreeably broken once again settled down upon the house.
  Still, I stood at the open door, looking out into the darkness. Had my father
  seen the letter? He had seemed very cheerful. But then, he would have seemed
  very cheerful if he had been walking to the scaffold or the stake. That was
  his nature. Yet his gaiety had appeared to me more genuine than that which he
  had exhibited earlier in the evening. However, there was no need to
  speculate; the question could easily be set at rest. Taking the match-box
  from my candlestick, I stole silently down the stairs, steadying myself by
  the hand-rail, and groped my way across the hall until I reached the door.
  Then I struck a match, and by its light, peered through the wire grating into
  the letter-box.</p>

  <p>It was empty. The letter had been taken out.</p>

  <p>I blew out the match, and, having dropped it into the salver on the table,
  crept back up the stairs to my room. Closing the door silently, I made my
  final preparations, turned out the light and crept into bed, feeling in the
  sudden ecstasy of relief that I could now shake off all care and bury the
  anxieties and alarms of this dreadful day in slumber.</p>

  <p>My father was saved! No haunting fear of imminent tragedy, no dread of
  impending ruin and disgrace, remained to murder sleep or mingle it with
  frightful visions. My father was saved. At the eleventh hour I had made my
  bid for his life and liberty; and the eleventh hour had not been too
  late.</p>

  <p>But it was long&mdash;very long before sleep came to shut out for a time
  the realities of life. The blessed feeling of escape from this appalling
  peril, the sense of restored security, was presently followed by the chill of
  reaction. For the end was not yet. I had bid for my father's life and had
  bought it in; but the price remained to be paid. And only now, when I could
  consider it undisturbed by terror for my father's safety, did I begin to
  realise fully how bitter a price it was. Not that I would have gone back on
  my bargain, for I had made it with my eyes open; and would have made it over
  again if the need had been. But it was a terrible price. I had sold my
  birth-right&mdash;my precious woman's birth-right to choose my own
  mate&mdash;for a mess of pottage. It was a price that I should have to pay,
  and go on paying as long as life lasted.</p>

  <p>Hour after hour did I lie, gazing wide-eyed into the darkness, letting my
  thoughts flit hither and thither, now into the quiet, untroubled past, now
  into the dim and desolate future, whence they would come hurrying back
  affrighted. But always, whithersoever they wandered, behind them rose, now
  vague and remote, now horribly distinct, that unwieldy figure with the
  impassive oriental face; even, as to the eyes of the fisherman in the Arabian
  tale, the smoke from the magic jar shaped itself into the menacing form of
  the gigantic Jinn.</p>

  <p>I tried to consider dispassionately the character of Mr. Otway. It was
  very difficult. For had he not come into our life like some malignant spirit,
  to dispel with a word and in the twinkling of an eye, all the peace and
  happiness of our quiet home? To snap off short my serene companionship with
  my father? To turn into dust and ashes all the vaguely-sweet dreams of
  maidenhood? To shut out the warm and hazy sunshine from my future and fill
  the firmament with unrelieved, leaden greyness? Still, I tried to consider
  him fairly. Callously, cynically, he had driven his Juggernaut car over my
  father and me, his eyes fixed upon his own desires and seeing nothing else.
  He was an absolute egoist. That was undeniable. For some reason, he wished to
  marry me; and to achieve that wish he had been willing to put us both on the
  rack, and, with passionless composure, to turn the screw until we yielded. It
  was not a pleasant thing to think of.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, he seemed, in his way, to be a just man. By no hair's
  breadth had he sought to modify the terms that he had first proposed; indeed,
  in his letter to me he had treated the loan to my father as an almost
  unconditional gift, and the other details of our agreement he had expressed
  in writing fully and fairly, with no attempt at evasion. Nor was he
  niggardly. Five thousand pounds is a large sum to pay for the privilege of
  marrying an unwilling bride. Under other circumstances I might have
  appreciated the implied compliment. Now, I could only admit that, according
  to his lights, he seemed not ungenerous.</p>

  <p>But when I considered him as the companion with whom I must share the
  remainder of my life&mdash;or, at least, that part of it which
  mattered&mdash;the thought was almost unendurable. To live, day after day and
  year after year, under the same roof with this huge, dull, uncomely man; to
  sit at table with him, to walk abroad by his side, to spend interminable
  evenings alone with him: it was appalling. I could hardly bear to think of
  it. And yet the horrible reality would be upon me in the course of a few
  swiftly-passing days.</p>

  <p>Nor was it a question of mere companionship&mdash;but from this aspect I
  hurriedly averted my thoughts in sheer cowardice. I dared not let myself
  think even for a moment of what marriage actually meant. Under normal
  conditions it may be permitted to the modesty of an unwedded girl to cast an
  occasional glance, half-shy and not wholly unpleasurable, at the more
  intimate relations of married life: but to me, if the thought would rise
  unbidden, it could call up nought but the quick flush of shame and loathing
  whereat I would bury my face in the pillow with a moan of shuddering
  disgust.</p>

  <p>It was a relief to turn from the distressful present and the unthinkable
  future to the past, or even to the future that might have been. For, like
  most other girls, I had had my day-dreams. The companionship with my father
  had been happy and full of interest; but it had never seemed final. I had
  looked on it as no more than the prologue to the real life, which lay, for
  the moment, hidden behind the near horizon of my maidenhood. And as to that
  reality, though it offered but a vague picture, yet it had a certain
  definiteness. To many modern girls, ambition seems to connect itself with the
  academy and the laboratory, with the platform and the forum. They appear to
  hanker after fame, or even mere notoriety, and would contend with
  men&mdash;who have nothing better to do&mdash;for the high places in
  politics, in science or in literature. I had read the impassioned demands of
  some of these women for political and economic equality with men, and had
  looked at them with a certain dim surprise to see them so eager to gather
  this Dead Sea fruit and turn their backs upon the Tree of Life, with its
  golden burden of love and blessed motherhood. Ambition of that kind had no
  message for me. So far my mind was perfectly clear. As to the terms in which
  I conceived the realities, the blossom and fructification of a woman's life,
  I am less clear. A home of my own like the pleasant, peaceful home that my
  father had made; a man of my own, in whom I could feel pride and by whom I
  could be linked to the greater world outside; and a sweet brood of little
  people in whom my youth could be renewed and for whom I could even cherish
  wider ambitions: this was probably what my rambling thoughts would have
  pictured if they could have been gathered up and brought to a definite focus.
  But they never had been. The necessary refracting medium had been absent. For
  what the burning-glass is to the sunbeam, the actual love of some particular
  man is to the opening mind of a young girl, bringing the scattered rays of
  thought to a single bright spot in which the wished-for future becomes sharp
  and distinct. And this influence, in its completeness, had never come into my
  life. The undoubted liking that I had for the society of men was due,
  chiefly, to their larger interests and wider knowledge. Of experiences
  sentimental or romantic there had been none.</p>

  <p>And yet the little god had not entirely forgotten me. Indeed, his winged
  shaft had missed me so narrowly that I could hardly yet be certain that I had
  passed quite unscathed. That little episode&mdash;tame enough in all
  conscience&mdash;had occurred two years ago, when a Mr. Davenant had come
  from Oxford with a small party of fellow undergraduates, to spend a more or
  less studious vacation in our neighbourhood. I had met him, in all, three
  times on the footing of a casual acquaintance, and we had talked "high
  philosophy" with the eager interest of the very young. That was all. He had
  been a bird of passage, alighting for a moment on the very outskirts of my
  life, only to soar away into the unknown and vanish for ever.</p>

  <p>It seemed an insignificant affair. A score of other men had come and gone
  in the same way. But there was a difference&mdash;to me. Those other men,
  too, had talked "high philosophy," but I had forgotten utterly what it was
  that they had said. Not so had it been in the case of Mr. Davenant. Again and
  again had I found myself thinking over his talks with me, not, I suspect, for
  the sake of the matter&mdash;which, to speak the truth, was neither weighty
  nor brilliantly original&mdash;but rather because I had enjoyed talking to
  him. And sometimes I had been surprised to notice how clearly I remembered
  those talks, even to the very words that he had used and the tones of his
  pleasant, manly voice. Two years had passed since then&mdash;a long time in a
  girl's life; but still Mr. Davenant&mdash;his name, by the way, was Jasper, a
  pleasant-sounding name I had thought it&mdash;remained the one figure that
  had separated itself from the nebulous mass of humanity that had peopled my
  short existence. And to-night&mdash;on this night of misery and despair, when
  all that was worth living for seemed to be passing away, as I lay staring up
  into the darkness, the memory of him came back to me again. Once more I heard
  his voice&mdash;how strangely familiar it sounded!&mdash;framing those
  quaintly-abstruse sentences, I recalled the look in his eyes&mdash;clear,
  hazel eyes, they were, that sparkled with vivacity and the fresh interest of
  youth&mdash;and his smile, as he uttered some mild joke&mdash;a queer,
  humorous smile that drew his mouth just a little to one side and seemed to
  give an added piquancy to the jest by its own trifling oddity. I remembered
  it all, clearly, vividly, with the freshness of yesterday; the words of
  wisdom, the humorous turn of speech, the earnest, almost eager tone, the easy
  manner, friendly yet deferential&mdash;all came back to me as it had done a
  hundred times before, though it was two years ago.</p>

  <p>He had been but a stranger&mdash;a mere passing stranger who had come and
  gone&mdash;who had sailed across the rim of my horizon and vanished. But even
  in that swift passage some virtue had exhaled from him by which it had been
  given to me to look beyond the present into a world hitherto in visible to
  me. He was my one little romance; a very little one, but all that I had; and,
  to me, he stood for all those things that might have been and now could never
  be. And so it happened that, on this night, when I seemed to be bidding
  farewell to my youth and all its dimly-cherished hopes, the memory of him
  lingered in my thoughts and was with me still when, at last, sleep&mdash;the
  sleep of utter weariness and exhaustion&mdash;closed my eyelids and shut out
  for a time the realities of that life on which I would have been well content
  never to look again.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-05"
     id="ch-1-05"></a>V.&mdash; ON THE BRINK</h2>

  <p class="first">Of the four days that followed, I do not, even now, like to
  think. The dreadful change that was coming into my life loomed up every
  moment more distinct, more threatening, more terrible. The hideous realities
  of what was about to happen to me refused to be ignored. They thrust
  themselves upon me and filled my thoughts every instant of the day and
  haunted my dreams at night. There were times when I turned a wistful eye upon
  that solution of the hopeless difficulties of life at which my father had
  hinted; but alas! even that was no solution as matters stood. Death which
  would have released me from this bondage into which I had sold myself, would
  have left my father unemancipated; and to attain it by my own act would have
  been a grossly dishonest evasion of the covenant into which I had entered
  with Mr. Otway. Expediency and honour both demanded that I should carry out
  the terms of my agreement.</p>

  <p>But it was a terrible burden that I bore during those four days, and bore,
  of necessity, with a cheerful face and as little change as might be from my
  usual manner. That was the most difficult part of all. To keep up the
  appearance of quiet gaiety, which was the tone of our house; to smile, to
  jest, to discuss projected work and to talk over the history which I was
  supposed still to be reading; and all the time to feel the day of doom
  creeping upon me, nearer and nearer with every beat of my aching heart. That
  was the hardest part. But it had to be done and done with thoroughness; for
  my father's watchful and sympathetic eye would have detected at once the
  smallest flutter of a signal of distress. And it was imperative that he
  should be kept in the dark.</p>

  <p>And that, perhaps, was the bitterest drop in this bitter potion. For the
  first time in my life I had a secret from my father. I was systematically
  deceiving him. And the secret that I withheld from him and shared with a mere
  stranger&mdash;with an enemy, in fact&mdash;was one that concerned him
  profoundly. And yet that, too, had to be. It was of the essence of the
  transaction. For, if he had suspected, for one instant, what I proposed to
  do, he would certainly have interfered; and I knew him well enough to feel
  sure that his interference would not have taken the form of mere persuasion.
  He was a quiet man, suave and gentle in manner; even-tempered, patient,
  forebearing&mdash;up to a certain point; but when that point was passed, a
  change occurred which was apt to surprise those who knew him but slightly.
  Like a heavy body, he was difficult to move and difficult to stop when moved.
  If he had suspected Mr. Otway of putting unfair pressure on me&mdash;which he
  would certainly have done&mdash;then I would not have answered for the
  consequences to Mr. Otway.</p>

  <p>But strive as I would to keep my secret, the intolerable strain of those
  days of misery must have made itself visible in some change in my appearance.
  Once or twice I caught my father looking at me narrowly with something of
  anxiety in his expression, and hastened to put on a little extra spurt of
  gaiety and to divert his attention from myself. Still, he was not entirely
  deceived by my assumed cheerfulness, though he made no remark until the very
  last evening, when, I suppose, my efforts to conceal the grief and
  wretchedness that were gnawing at my heart were less successful than usual.
  Then it was that he took me quite seriously to task.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what is the matter with my little girl," he said, looking at me
  reflectively as we sat at the supper table. "She has been getting a little
  pale of late, and looks tired and worn. Is it too much Queen Anne and not
  enough sleep, think you?"</p>

  <p>"I am feeling quite well," I replied.</p>

  <p>"That is an evasion, my dear, and a tarradiddle to boot, I suspect. You
  are looking quite well. What is it, Jimmy?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it is anything, Pater, dear," I answered, not without a
  qualm of conscience at the direct untruth. "I haven't been sleeping so very
  well lately, but that is not due to my sitting up reading. Perhaps it's the
  weather."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" he grunted; "perhaps it is&mdash;and perhaps it isn't. Are you sure
  there is nothing troubling you? No&mdash;what shall we say? Well, to put it
  bluntly, no young man, for instance, competing with the good Queen Anne for
  your attention?"</p>

  <p>I laughed a little, bitterly. If only there had been! But, alas! I was
  only too well secured against any troubles of that sort. So I was able to
  reply with a moderately clear conscience.</p>

  <p>"No, of course there isn't. You know that perfectly well. How could there
  be when you keep me so securely in my little hutch?"</p>

  <p>"That's true, Jimmy," he answered. "I certainly haven't noticed any buck
  rabbit sniffing around. But perhaps it is the hutch itself that is the
  trouble. It is a dull life for a girl, to be shut up with an old fellow like
  me. Coal-scuttles and such-like are all very well for an ancient fossil who
  has sucked all the juice out of life and must needs content himself with a
  modest nibble at the rind that's left. But it's not the sort of thing for a
  girl. Your orange is still unsucked, Jimmy, dear, and we mustn't leave it to
  get over-ripe."</p>

  <p>"I've always been very happy with you, dear old Pater," I said; and a lump
  rose in my throat as I spoke. How happy I had been! And oh, how thankfully
  would I have gone on with that serene, peaceful life and never asked for
  anything different, if only it might have been so!</p>

  <p>"I know you have, my dear," he rejoined; "always contented and cheerful
  and kind to your old father. But still&mdash;well, we mustn't get too groovy.
  We must have a little change now and again. I have been rather preoccupied
  these last few days, but I shall be more free now. What do you say to a few
  lays in London? It's quite a long time since we've been to town. Shall we
  take a week off and dissipate a little? Just spread a thin wash of
  carmine&mdash;quite a thin and delicate one&mdash;over the metropolis, and
  incidentally see for ourselves if the population of the great world doesn't
  still contain a few presentable human beings? What do you say?"</p>

  <p>I don't know what I said, or how I controlled the almost irresistible
  impulse to fling myself on his neck and sob my secret into his ear. It was
  terrible to listen to him making these plans for one of those blissful little
  holidays that we had enjoyed together from time to time, and to know that the
  morrow would see my own life spoiled irrevocably and his home made desolate.
  Some vague answer I murmured, and then managed to lead the conversation into
  a less distressing channel. But once or twice during the evening he reverted
  to the subject, and when, at a rather early hour, I wished him "good-night,"
  he said, as he held my hands and looked me over-critically:</p>

  <p>"Yes; the blossom is undoubtedly a little faded. We must see to it, Jimmy.
  Think over my proposal and consider whether there is any particular kind of
  jaunt that you would like; whether, for instance, you would rather go to the
  sea than to London."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Pater, dear," I replied; "I'll think about it," and with this
  only too easily fulfilled promise I turned away and went upstairs.</p>

  <p>It was my last night at home; the last night of my girlhood and of
  freedom. Virtually and to all intents, I had said farewell to my father for
  ever; for though, hereafter, we should meet, I should be his daughter, in the
  old sense&mdash;no more. I should be the chattel of another man, and that man
  no friend of his.</p>

  <p>For long after I went to my room I sat thinking these thoughts and gazing
  with scared, bewildered eyes into the dark future on whose threshold I
  already stood. What that future held for me, beyond the certainty of misery
  and degradation, who could tell? I dared not try to pierce that dread
  obscurity. From what might lie beyond that threshold my thoughts shrank back,
  appalled. The whole thing seemed like some hideous dream from which I should
  presently awaken, trembling, but with a sigh of relief. And yet it was not.
  Unbelievable as was this awful thing that had descended upon me in a moment,
  it was yet but too real for any hope of awakening.</p>

  <p>And what of my father? For him, too, the old pleasant life was at an end.
  The quiet gaiety, the serene happiness of his home was gone for ever.
  Henceforth he would be a lonely man, mourning the loss of his companion and
  cherishing a bitter resentment against the man who had stolen her away. But
  what would he feel about this ship wreck of my life&mdash;for so he would
  certainly regard it? What portion of the wretchedness and degradation into
  which I had sold myself would have to be borne by him? It was a question
  which I had hardly asked myself before; but now, when I thought of his
  devotion to me, of his sympathy with me and his self-forgetfulness, a sudden
  misgiving crept into my mind. Was it worth while, after all? If my father and
  I were both to be made wretched for life, what good had I done by this
  sacrifice?</p>

  <p>I thought of him as he had been this evening and for the last day or two.
  All his light-heartedness had come back. He was quite himself again. Since I
  had delivered Mr. Otway's letter, all signs of care had vanished. That letter
  had apparently put him entirely at his ease; naturally enough, since it had
  put an end to his immediate difficulties, and since he knew nothing of the
  price at which it had been purchased. And though I knew better, yet his ease
  and confidence were not without their effect on me. Under the clear sky and
  in the sunshine, it was hard to believe that the thunderbolt was still ready
  to fall. And so it was that, more than once on that night, I found myself
  asking if it were possible that I had done the wrong thing? Had I been too
  precipitate?</p>

  <p>But it was of no use to think of that now. The bargain had been made, and
  payment accepted in advance. Nor if it had been possible for me to go back on
  a promise voluntarily given&mdash;which it obviously was not&mdash;could Mr.
  Otway have been held to his. The original situation would have been created
  afresh.</p>

  <p>Before undressing, I sat down at my little bureau and wrote a letter to my
  father in case there should be no time on the morrow. For the
  arrangements&mdash;which Mr. Otway had communicated to me in a letter
  addressed in a feminine handwriting&mdash;were necessarily of a somewhat
  clandestine character. Mr. Otway had obtained a special license and had given
  notice to the clergyman of a small church on the outskirts of the town, and
  on the by-road leading to the church I was to meet him on Thursday morning as
  near as possible to eleven o'clock. There was not likely to be any difficulty
  in carrying out my part of the arrangement, but nevertheless, it was as well
  to leave nothing to be done on the morrow.</p>

  <p>The letter that I wrote to my father was quite short. There was no need
  for a long one, since the facts to be communicated were of the simplest and I
  should probably see him in the course of the day. What I wrote was as
  follows:</p>

  <p>"My dearest Father,</p>

  <p>"I am writing to tell you that I am about to do a thing of which I fear
  you will disapprove. I am going to marry Mr. Otway; and by the time you get
  this, the marriage will have taken place.</p>

  <p>"You will understand why I have done this when I tell you that I
  accidentally became aware of your difficulties and of the claim which he had
  on you and you will understand, too, why I have kept my intention secret from
  you. It was the only way out for us; and you are not to think that I have
  done it for you only. I was equally concerned, and have acted in my own
  interests as well as yours.</p>

  <p>"Please, dearest, try to forgive me for taking this step without your
  sanction. You would never have consented, and yet it had to be.</p>

  <p>"Your loving daughter,</p>

  <p>"HELEN."</p>

  <p>I sealed the letter, and, having addressed it, placed it in my bureau in
  readiness for the morning. Then I made various little arrangements of my
  possessions, tidying up my bureau and wardrobe, tearing up letters that had
  been answered and packing a small trunk with necessary articles of dress, to
  be sent for on the morrow; and all this I did with a curious stony calm and
  the sense of setting my affairs in order as if preparing to bid farewell to
  life. And this calm&mdash;a calm like that which persons of character often
  exhibit in the face of unavoidable death, or on the eve of a dangerous
  operation, continued even after I went to bed, so that, in contrast to the
  perturbed nights that I had passed since my interview with Mr. Otway, I
  presently fell into a sound sleep and slept late into the morning.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-06"
     id="ch-1-06"></a>VI. &mdash; A MEETING AND A PARTING</h2>

  <p class="first">IT turned out to be easier than I had expected to keep my
  appointment with Mr. Otway, for my father had business that took him abroad
  early, and, when I came down to breakfast, he had already left the house;
  which was a profound relief to me, since it saved me the added misery of a
  last farewell and the necessity of further deception.</p>

  <p>It was half-past ten when, after placing my letter in the salver on the
  hall table, I set forth from the house. The most direct way to the church was
  across the town, but the fear of meeting my father or any of my acquaintances
  led me to the roads that led out from the environs towards the country, and
  thus skirt the circumference of the town. I walked at a good pace,
  unconsciously threading my way through the rather complicated maze of
  by-roads, and still pervaded by the curious, half-dreamy calm that had
  possessed me on the preceding evening.</p>

  <p>As I approached the vicinity of the little church&mdash;which was a kind
  of mission-chapel, in charge of a supernumerary curate&mdash;I glanced at my
  watch and saw that it was five minutes to eleven; and almost at the same
  moment, on turning a corner, I came in sight of a figure the very first
  glance at which so completely shattered my self-possession that I felt ready
  to sink down upon the pavement. There was no mistaking it, though the back
  was towards me; a huge, ponderous figure that walked away from me with the
  peculiar gait of the heavy and unathletic man; a silent, deliberate gait that
  recalls the action of the hind legs of an elephant.</p>

  <p>I followed him breathlessly up the rather sordid-looking street, noting
  that, from time to time, a thin cloud of blue smoke floated over his
  shoulder. At length, at the corner of an intersecting road, he turned and saw
  me; upon which he flung away a cigar, and, retracing his steps towards me,
  saluted me with a flourish of his hat and held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"This is good of you, Miss Vardon," he said, "to be so punctual. I hardly
  hoped that you would be able to be here so&mdash;er&mdash;so punctually."</p>

  <p>I took his hand limply, but made no reply. The shock of the sudden
  encounter was slowly passing off and giving place to a sort of benumbed
  indifference mingled with vague curiosity. I felt as if I had been drugged or
  were walking abroad in a hypnotic trance, half conscious and waiting with
  dull expectancy to see what would happen next. I walked at Mr. Otway's side
  up the mean little street with a feeling somewhat like that with which one
  would walk in a dream beside some historical or mythical personage, accepting
  the incongruous situation from mere mental inertia.</p>

  <p>Mr. Otway, too, seemed subdued by the strangeness of the position, or
  perhaps he was embarrassed by my silence. At any rate, although he
  occasionally cleared his throat as if about to make a remark, he did not
  actually speak again until we turned a corner, when there appeared, embedded
  in a row of mean houses, a small brick building which, in general shape and
  design, resembled a large dog-kennel.</p>

  <p>"That," said he, "is the church, Miss Vardon&mdash;or perhaps I should
  say, Helen. It is a little difficult to&mdash;ah&mdash;get used to
  these&mdash;these intimacies, I may say, at so short a notice. No doubt you
  find it so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered.</p>

  <p>"I am sure you do. Naturally. My own name, you may remember, is Lewis. My
  Christian name, I mean," he added, shying slightly at the word
  "Christian."</p>

  <p>"I remember," said I.</p>

  <p>"Quite so. I had no doubt you would. Ahem." He cleared his throat once or
  twice in an embarrassed manner, and then, as we crossed over towards the
  church, he continued: "I think we shall find the doors open. The law, I
  believe, requires it. And we shall find my housekeeper, Mrs. Gregg, inside.
  She will be one of the witnesses, you know. The other will be the
  sexton."</p>

  <p>The outer door was on the latch, as he had said, and, when he had admitted
  me, he closed and relatched it. From the dark vestibule, I stepped into the
  bare, comfortless building, from the white-washed wall of which a great,
  emblazoned text grinned at me, as if in derision, with the words: "I was glad
  when they said unto me, 'Let us go into the House of the Lord.'"</p>

  <p>Near the door, on one of the deal benches, the little, frail-looking woman
  whom I had seen at Mr. Otway's house was seated, conversing with a very bald
  and rather seedy elderly man; but, as we entered, the man hurried away
  towards the vestry and the woman rose and came forward a few paces to meet
  us.</p>

  <p>"This is Miss Vardon, Mrs. Gregg," said Mr. Otway, introducing me in a
  heavy, embarrassed manner.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gregg stared at me with undisguised curiosity and something of
  hostility in her expression, as she replied: "Ah've seen her before."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Otway, "I believe you have. Yes. To be sure. Of course.
  And I&mdash;er&mdash;hope&mdash;in fact, I may say that
  I&mdash;ah&mdash;"</p>

  <p>What he was going to say I have no idea, and I suspect that he was not
  very clear himself; but at this moment the man&mdash;who was apparently the
  sexton&mdash;emerged from the vestry in company with a young clergyman,
  vested already in his surplice and carrying a book in his hand.</p>

  <p>Apparently everything had been explained and arranged beforehand by Mr.
  Otway, for, as we advanced up the nave, the curate took his place before the
  communion table and opened his book. I noticed that he gave me one quick and
  intense look, full of surprise and curiosity, and thereafter seemed, as far
  as possible, to avoid even glancing in my direction.</p>

  <p>The ceremony began abruptly and without preamble. With dim surprise, I
  became aware that the clergyman was speaking, or rather reading aloud, in a
  rapid and indistinct undertone. I listened with but slight attention, and
  failed, for the most part, to distinguish the words which, I think, was what
  the curate intended; his half-apologetic mumble being, I believe, designed to
  mitigate the effect of those coarsely-phrased impertinences with which the
  service is besprinkled, and which have survived so inappropriately into this
  age of decent and reticent speech. I tried to fix my thoughts on the ceremony
  in which I was taking part, but found them constantly wandering away to my
  father, busying themselves with his present whereabouts and occupation. Was
  he still at his office? Or had he perchance called in at our house, as he
  sometimes did, and already seen my letter?</p>

  <p>I was brought back to the happenings of the moment by a question addressed
  to me by name in more distinct tones, and followed by the murmured
  instruction: "Say I will." I obeyed the gently-spoken command, and then, with
  my right hand enveloped in a large and flabby grasp, I heard Mr. Otway repeat
  after the curate the solemn form of words that should mean so much and that
  was, as now spoken, so empty a mockery; of which the phrase "to have and to
  hold from this day forward" seemed to separate itself as the only part truly
  applicable.</p>

  <p>Still passive, and conscious only of a certain, dull discomfort and
  surprise at the incongruity of the whole affair, I permitted our hands to be
  separated and re-joined, and obediently repeated the form of words as the
  curate dictated.</p>

  <p>"I, Helen Vardon, take thee, Lewis Otway, to my wedded husband, to have
  and to hold from this day forward, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in
  health, to love, cherish, and to obey, till death us do part, according to
  God's holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth."</p>

  <p>It was amazing. These burning words, so charged with love, with utter
  devotion and self-abandonment I was actually addressing to a mere stranger,
  to a man who, even now, was but a name attached to an unfamiliar, ungracious
  personality; upon whose corpse, if he had fallen dead at my feet in the very
  moment of my speaking, I could have looked with no emotion but relief.</p>

  <p>It was an astounding situation. The wonder, the incredibility of it filled
  my mind to the exclusion of all else until, as Mr. Otway began once more to
  speak at the curate's dictation, and I became aware that a ring had been
  slipped on my finger, I realised dimly that the ceremony was complete and
  that the irrevocable change had occurred.</p>

  <p>But even then my thoughts quickly flitted away from this significant scene
  to others that seemed more deeply to concern me. As I knelt at Mr. Otway's
  side and the monotonous mumble recommenced, I began once more to wonder where
  my father was and what he was doing. Had he come in and seen my letter, or
  had the maid noticed it and taken it to the office? And would he be angry or
  only grieved? Would he think that I had acted rightly? Or would he condemn my
  action as ill-considered or even unnecessary? And lastly, was it just barely
  possible that I had done the wrong thing? Had I sacrificed myself&mdash;and
  him&mdash;without sufficient cause?</p>

  <p>Thus my thoughts wandered to and fro to the mumbled accompaniment of the
  interminable prayers and exhortations that rolled past me in an unheeded
  stream. At last the ceremony came to an end. Rising from our knees, we
  trooped after the curate to the vestry, where, as I signed the familiar name
  in the register, the first clear realization of my changed condition came
  upon me. But even then the vivid flash of perception was but transient.
  Hardly had I shaken hands with the clergyman and passed out into the street,
  when my thoughts sped away once more to my home&mdash;my real home&mdash;and
  my father.</p>

  <p>For some time after leaving the church Mr. Otway and I walked in silence.
  He hemmed once or twice and seemed on the point of speaking, but either he
  could find nothing appropriate to say or he found some difficulty in opening
  the subject of his thoughts. And meanwhile I pursued my own reflections. At
  length, however, after one or two preliminary hems, he managed to make a
  beginning.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, Helen, you may think that I have put rather unfair pressure
  on you to marry me."</p>

  <p>I roused myself to consider what he had said, and replied, after a slight
  pause:</p>

  <p>"Whatever I may think, I am not complaining. I don't forget that I
  accepted your proposal of my own free will; and I intend to try to carry out
  honestly my part of the bargain."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear you say that, Helen," he said eagerly. "I was afraid
  you might feel resentful&mdash;might think I had driven a rather hard
  bargain."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I do," I replied. "But that doesn't affect the terms of the
  bargain. My feelings towards you were no part of the agreement."</p>

  <p>"No; that's true," he agreed hastily; but he was visibly crestfallen, and
  walked by my side for some time without speaking. My thoughts began to wander
  again; and then, suddenly, there occurred to me a question that I had already
  asked myself over and over again without finding any answer. Now, moved by a
  fresh impulse of curiosity, I put it into words.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind telling me, Mr. Otway, why you wished to marry me?"</p>

  <p>He looked at me in some surprise and a little confusion.</p>

  <p>"Why, my dear Helen," he replied hesitatingly, "there is nothing
  remarkable about it, is there? I wished to marry you for the same reason that
  any other man would; because you are a handsome girl&mdash;a beautiful girl,
  I may say&mdash;and clever and bright, and, as far as I could judge from your
  manner to your father, a good, affectionate girl. I have admired you ever
  since I first met you, a year and a half ago."</p>

  <p>I suppose I looked surprised&mdash;I certainly felt so, seeing that he had
  made no effort to cultivate our acquaintance&mdash;for he continued:</p>

  <p>"Yes, Helen, I admired you; but as I had nothing to offer in the way of
  personal attractions, and I did not suppose that my means would be a
  sufficient set-off for my&mdash;ah&mdash;personal disadvantages, I kept my
  admiration to myself. In fact, I suppose, if it had not been for this lucky
  chance&mdash;lucky for me, I mean&mdash;a little unfortunate perhaps for
  you&mdash;though not so unfortunate as it might&mdash;er&mdash;at least I
  venture to hope that things may turn out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused awkwardly, as if expecting me to help him. But I made no
  comment. My momentary curiosity was satisfied. I had heard his explanation,
  and a very insufficient one it seemed to be. So the sentence remained
  unfinished, and, in the silence that ensued, my thoughts went back once more
  to my father.</p>

  <p>When would he get my letter? And what would be his feelings when he
  realized that his daughter&mdash;his companion and playmate, his beloved
  apprentice&mdash;was lost to him for ever? And what would be his attitude to
  Mr. Otway? Deeply resentful, beyond a doubt. His scornful rejection of the
  proposal had shown that clearly enough. Yes, he would be
  angry&mdash;furiously angry; for quiet and gentle as his manners were, he was
  a passionate man. He could even be violent, as I knew from one or two
  experiences. And our doctor, Dr. Sharpe, knew it, too, and had warned him to
  be careful, had cautioned him not only to avoid over-exertion, but excessive
  excitement of any kind. The doctor's words came back to me now with a qualm
  of uneasiness. I had not thought of that before. His distress, his grief, his
  anger against the man who had exacted this price from me&mdash;all that I had
  thought of and fretted over. But the actual physical shock that my letter
  would inflict on him, utterly unprepared as he was&mdash;that I had somehow
  overlooked. And yet it was palpable enough. He would come home expecting to
  find me waiting for him as usual; and then, without an instant's warning, in
  the very twinkling of an eye, he would learn that I had been spirited away
  out of his life for ever. It would be a terrible blow.</p>

  <p>The more I thought of it the more uneasy I became. Supposing he should
  become seriously ill on receiving my letter. It was quite possible; it was
  even very probable. And if he should have got my letter already! If he should
  be, at this very moment, lying, prostrated by the shock, with none but the
  servants to tend him! As I thought of this dreadful possibility, my anxiety
  grew, moment by moment; and I was beginning to consider how soon I could
  contrive to escape to him, to satisfy myself that all was well, when the
  voice of Mr. Otway broke in on my thoughts. I did not at first gather clearly
  what he was saying until, by an effort, I detached my attention from the
  agitating subject of my reflections.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he was saying as I endeavoured to catch up the thread of his
  remarks, "it answered my purpose as a solitary bachelor; but it won't do now.
  We shall have to get quite a different class of house. And we shall want some
  other servants. I shall keep Mrs. Gregg, if you don't object, as she has been
  with me so long and knows my ways, but we shall want a couple of maids in
  addition, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Is Mrs. Gregg your only servant?" I asked, rather absently.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied; "that is to say, the only resident servant. She has a
  girl to help her in the mornings with the housework and to mind the place
  when she goes out shopping. That is how she was able to attend at the church
  this morning."</p>

  <p>As he was speaking, we turned into the quiet, countrified road in which he
  lived, and a few more steps brought us to the house. Mrs. Gregg, who had
  apparently hurried on in advance by a different route, was standing at the
  open door talking to a girl of about sixteen, and, as we ascended the steps,
  she addressed Mr. Otway.</p>

  <p>"I've got to see to some things in the town. D'ye want Lizzie to stay or
  will ye open the door yourself if anyone comes?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, she needn't stay, Mrs. Gregg," was the reply. "I shan't be going out.
  But don't be any longer than you can help."</p>

  <p>On this Mrs. Gregg dismissed the girl, and followed her out, shutting the
  door after her. Mr. Otway hung his hat on a peg in the hall, and placing his
  umbrella in the stand, remarked apologetically:</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Gregg's manner is not all that might be desired in a servant; but
  she is a capable woman and absolutely trustworthy. She comes from the North,
  you know, where manners run a little more blunt than with us. Shall I show
  you your room?"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for a reply, he preceded me up the stairs to the first
  floor, where he ushered me into a bedroom and stood by the door with an
  embarrassed and rather deprecating air, casting a glance of obvious
  disparagement over its somewhat meagre appointments.</p>

  <p>"It's a poor place to bring you to, Helen," he remarked, "but that can be
  mended. It was good enough for a bachelor. You'll find the wardrobe and chest
  of drawers empty when you send for your things. Mine are in the
  dressing-room&mdash;that little room to the right. And now I'll leave you in
  possession for the present."</p>

  <p>With this he went out, closing the door behind him, and I heard his soft,
  heavy tread descending the stairs.</p>

  <p>For some time after he had gone I stood looking about me in absolute
  dismay. The room was mean almost to sordidness&mdash;surprisingly mean for
  the habitation of an admittedly wealthy man. But it was not that which filled
  me with consternation. Delicately as I had been brought up, the mere
  surroundings of life were of no great consideration to me. What appalled me
  utterly was the fact now brought home to me with overwhelming force; that I
  was no more my own; that I had surrendered myself to the possession of
  another person, a strange man, towards whom I felt a growing repugnance. This
  was not my room: it was our room. No longer had I any rights of privacy or of
  personal reticence. I was his, "to have and to hold from this day forward,"
  with no power of escape or protest against the most repulsive familiarities.
  I had voluntarily surrendered, not only my liberty, but even the appearance
  of security from the most outrageous intrusions.</p>

  <p>Of course I had known all this before. But in the hurry and rush, the
  alarms and agitations of the events that had forced me to my hasty decision,
  perception had been partly obscured. I had known what I was doing, but had
  only dimly realized. It had needed the sight of that mean room, with its
  significant contents and the presence of that man who stood at my side as
  joint occupier, to light up the vague perception into realization of the most
  horrid vividness.</p>

  <p>Presently I began, with the dull curiosity of a prisoner introduced to a
  new cell, to explore the room, opening the empty wardrobe and pulling out the
  ill-fitting drawers of the plain pine chest. Then I peeped into the
  dressing-room&mdash;a bare little closet, furnished with a wash-stand, a
  dressing-table and a chest of drawers&mdash;and even stepped in to glance
  over the half-blind down into the garden and street beyond. I was about to
  turn away when I noticed a man approaching the house at a rapid pace; and in
  an instant my heart leaped with mingled joy and alarm.</p>

  <p>It was my father.</p>

  <p>I watched him nervously as he strode towards the house, and my fears rose
  with each step that he took. Every movement was expressive of excitement and
  anger; the swift stride, the forward-thrust chin, the very set of the
  shoulders; the way in which he grasped his stick by the middle, as if aiming
  a blow, was full of menace. As he drew nearer I shrank behind the curtain,
  but still watched him; watched him with growing alarm, for now I could see
  that his eyes were wild under the frowning brows, his mouth was set and his
  face was of a strange, blotchy, purple colour. He looked as if he had been
  drinking, but I knew he had not.</p>

  <p>As he reached the gate, he wrenched it open violently, and, entering,
  slammed it behind him; a thing I had never before known him to do. He strode
  up the path, without a glance upwards, and disappeared from my sight, and a
  moment later there came a wild jangling of the bell, followed by a thundering
  knock at the door.</p>

  <p>I hesitated, undecided what I should do. Should I go down and meet him
  with appeasing words, or should I wait until the first explosion of his wrath
  had subsided? I crept out of the bedroom to the landing and stood with my
  hand on the baluster rail, listening. I heard Mr. Otway walk along the hall,
  softly and rather slowly. I heard him open the door, and then my father's
  voice rose, loud and fierce.</p>

  <p>"Where is my daughter, Otway? Is she here?</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mr. Otway replied; "she is upstairs. We have just returned from the
  church."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say," my father demanded, "that the marriage has actually
  taken place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mr. Otway answered. "We were married half an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"What!" roared my father. "After my letter! Did you tell her about that
  letter? You didn't, you damned scoundrel! You've tricked her! You've swindled
  her!</p>

  <p>"As to your letter, Mr. Vardon," I heard Mr. Otway reply, "I haven't seen
  it myself, yet. The morning's correspondence is still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here a door closed, and his voice became inaudible. They had gone into one
  of the rooms. I staggered back into the bedroom and sank on to a chair,
  trembling from head to foot. In the name of God, what did my father mean?
  Tricked! Swindled! Could it be true? Was it actually possible that I had been
  lured into the arms of this ungainly lout by a false pretence? It was
  incredible. And yet&mdash;As the first shock of this amazing statement began
  to pass off, a storm of anger and indignation arose in my breast; and I was
  on the point of rising to go down and confront Mr. Otway, when the house
  shook to a heavy concussion. I sprang from the chair, and flying on the wings
  of terror down the stairs, opened the first door that I came to.</p>

  <p>Years have rolled by since that unforgettable moment, but even now, as I
  write, the tableau that met my eyes as I opened the door rises before me
  vivid and distinct as the dreadful reality. I saw it even then but for a
  single instant, as I darted into the room; but it has remained with me and
  will remain till my dying day.</p>

  <p>My father lay motionless on the floor near the fire-place; his face an
  awful, livid grey, his eyes staring fixedly at the ceiling; and from a small
  wound on the right side of his forehead a few drops of dark blood trickled
  down his temple. Beside him, and stooping over him, stood Mr. Otway, with
  ashen face and dropped jaw, the very picture of horror and mortal fear; and
  in Mr. Otway's right hand was grasped my father's stick, a stout Malacca,
  with a heavily-loaded silver knob.</p>

  <p>I flew past him and sank on my knees by my father's side; and in that
  moment I knew that my father was dead. I had never seen a dead person before.
  But it was unmistakable. I spoke to him; I called to him in an agonised
  whisper; I patted his head and touched his face. But all the while I knew
  that he was dead; that he was gone from me for ever. Even as I looked at him,
  the livid grey of his face faded to a dead white; the staring eyes relaxed
  and seemed to sink into their sockets; and the mouth slowly fell open. It was
  death. I knew it. Dazed, stricken, almost bereft of consciousness and the
  power of thought, I knew it, with the dull certainty of despair.</p>

  <p>As I had entered the room, Mr. Otway had started up with a look of terror,
  and when I sank at my father's side, I had heard him move away softly towards
  the writing-table. He was now back and once more stooping over my father's
  body. I felt that he was there, although my eyes were fixed on that pallid
  face that gave back no answering glance. Presently he spoke, in a hushed,
  awe-stricken whisper.</p>

  <p>"This is terrible, Helen! Can't we do anything?"</p>

  <p>I looked up at him with a sudden flush of loathing and detestation; and as
  I looked, I noticed that he no longer held the stick. I rose slowly to my
  feet and faced him.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "He is dead. He is dead. Mr. Otway, you have killed my
  father."</p>

  <p>As I faced him, he shrank away from me, staring at me as if I had been
  some horrid apparition. His face, blanched to a horrible white and shiny with
  sweat, was dreadful to look upon; the face of abject, mortal terror.</p>

  <p>"Helen!" he gasped. "Helen! For God's sake don't look at me like that! It
  was not I who killed him. I swear to God it was not. He fainted. I was trying
  to take the stick from him&mdash;I had to, or he would have killed me
  &mdash;and his head struck the mantelpiece. Then he fainted and fell. I am
  telling you the truth, Helen. I am, before God!"</p>

  <p>To this I made no reply. Whether I believed him or not, I cannot say.
  Stunned as I was by this frightful thing that had befallen, I could only look
  at him with utter loathing as the cause of it all.</p>

  <p>"Helen!" he continued, imploringly, "say you believe me! I swear I never
  touched him. And don't look at me like that! Helen! Why do you look at me in
  that awful way?"</p>

  <p>He clasped his hands, and, casting a fearful glance at my poor father's
  corpse, moaned: "My God! my God! but this is horrible! Horrible! Do you think
  he is really dead? Don't you think&mdash;can't we do anything? If a doctor
  were here&mdash;if we only had someone to send&mdash;Shall I go and fetch a
  doctor, Helen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, "you had better."</p>

  <p>"I will," he said. "But you do believe me, don't you? I swear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You had better go at once, Mr. Otway," I interrupted.</p>

  <p>He gave me one pitiful glance of appeal, and then, with a despairing moan,
  turned and left the room. I heard him hurry along the hall and a moment later
  the outer door closed.</p>

  <p>Once more I sank on my knees beside my father, and, taking the passive
  hand in mine, looked into the pallid face, dimly surprised to find something
  new and unfamiliar creeping into it. I did not weep. The blow was too
  crushing, too overwhelming to call forth common emotion. Nor did I think
  coherently; but knelt, looking dumbly into the face that was my father's, and
  yet was not, wrapped in a sort of dreadful trance, conscious only of bitter
  pain and a sense of unutterable loss.</p>

  <p>After a time&mdash;I do not know how long&mdash;I became aware of sounds
  of movement in the house, and presently soft foot steps approached the room.
  The door, which Mr. Otway had left ajar, opened with a faint creak, and the
  voice of Mrs. Gregg ejaculated: "Sakes! What's this?"</p>

  <p>She stole on tip-toe into the room until she stood beside me, looking down
  with a scared expression as my father's corpse.</p>

  <p>"Why!" she exclaimed, "the man's dead! Who is he?</p>

  <p>"He is my father, Mrs. Gregg," I replied.</p>

  <p>She stood for some time in silence, apparently considering the import of
  my answer. Then she walked round and looked down curiously at the wound on
  the forehead.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. Otway?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He has gone to fetch a doctor," I answered.</p>

  <p>"A doctor!" she repeated. "And what might be the good of a doctor when the
  man is dead? D'ye know how it happened?"</p>

  <p>Before I had time to reply to her question, there came the sound of a
  latch-key inserted into the hall door. She turned quickly and made as if she
  would leave the room, but, as she reached the threshold, Mr. Otway entered,
  followed by the doctor, and she fell back to let them pass. I rose to my
  feet, and the doctor&mdash;a hard-faced, middle-aged man whom I knew by
  sight&mdash;knelt down in my place. He lifted the limp hand and laid his
  finger on the wrist; he raised the eyelid and touched the glazing eyeball;
  then drawing out his stethoscope he listened for some time at the chest over
  the region of the heart. And meanwhile we all stood watching him in a
  profound silence through which the ticking of the clock broke noisily, as it
  had done on that fateful night when I had sat in this very room unconsciously
  preparing the elements of this tragedy.</p>

  <p>At length the doctor rose, and, folding his stethoscope, deliberately
  slipped it into his pocket and turned to Mr. Otway.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say that it is as you feared," said he. "He is quite dead.
  From what you have told me, I should say it was a case of heart failure from
  over-excitement. Have there been any previous attacks?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "But I think Dr. Sharpe considered that his heart was
  weak."</p>

  <p>"Ah! He did, did he? Well, I had better call on Dr. Sharpe and hear what
  he knows about the case." He walked round, and, stooping down, examined the
  wound attentively. Then, without looking at Mr. Otway, he asked: "You say he
  struck his head against the corner of the mantelpiece? This corner, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>He touched the right hand corner of the marble shelf, and, as Mr. Otway
  assented, I saw him place his shoulder against it as if to measure its
  height.</p>

  <p>"Was that when he was in the act of falling?" he asked, with his eyes
  fixed on the wound.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Mr. Otway. "At least, I think so&mdash;I should say yes,
  certainly&mdash;that is, to the best of my belief. Of course, Dr. Bury, you
  will understand that I am a little confused in my recollection. The&mdash;ah
  &mdash;the circumstances were very agitating and&mdash;ah&mdash;confusing. Is
  the point of any importance?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see," the doctor replied a little drily, "when a man dies
  suddenly and only one person is present&mdash;as I understand was the case in
  this instance&mdash;every point is of importance."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. It would be, naturally."</p>

  <p>Mr. Otway spoke these words in a low, husky voice, and, as I looked at
  him, I saw that he had turned as pale as death and that his face had again
  broken out into a greasy sweat. Nor was I the only observer. Mrs. Gregg, who
  had been standing in the corner by the door, quietly attentive to all that
  passed, was now watching her employer narrowly and with a very curious
  expression. There was a brief interval of silence, and then Mr. Otway having
  cleared his throat once or twice, asked, in the same husky, unsteady
  voice:</p>

  <p>"I suppose, when you have talked the matter over with Dr. Sharpe, you will
  be able to certify the death in the usual way?"</p>

  <p>"In the usual way?" Dr. Bury repeated. "Yes: in the way that is usual in
  cases of sudden death. Of course, I shan't be able to give an ordinary
  certificate. I shall write to the coroner, giving him the facts, and he will
  decide whether an inquest is necessary or whether he can issue a certificate
  on my statement."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Mr. Otway. "You will report the facts&mdash;and, I suppose,
  you will state what your own views on the case are?"</p>

  <p>"I shall make any comments that seem to be called for, but, of course, the
  facts are what the coroner wants."</p>

  <p>"And would you consider that, in a case like this, an inquiry is
  necessary?</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I should," was the reply; "but it doesn't rest with me.
  Would you like me to help you to move him? You can't leave him lying here,
  and you can hardly have him carried to his own house by daylight."</p>

  <p>"No," Mr. Otway agreed, "we could not. If you will kindly help me to carry
  him to the drawing-room, we can lay him on the sofa."</p>

  <p>The two men raised my poor father, and, while I supported his head, they
  carried him to the drawing-room and laid him on the sofa, when Dr. Bury,
  having taken an embroidered cover from a table and spread it over him, drew
  down the blinds.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said he, "you had better leave him here until we know what the
  coroner intends to do. In case he should decide&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here he glanced a little uncomfortably at me, and I realised that he would
  rather speak of the grim details unembarrassed by my presence. Accordingly, I
  stole from the room and returned to the one from which we had just come. The
  door was open as we had left it, and, as I came opposite to it, treading
  softly, as was my habit, I saw Mrs. Gregg standing by the roll-top table with
  my father's stick in her hand, apparently testing the weight of the heavy
  lead loading that the silver knob concealed. She started as she suddenly
  became aware of my presence, but, quickly recovering her self-possession,
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Will this be your father's stick?"</p>

  <p>I answered that it was, whereupon she remarked, as she stood it in the
  corner behind the writing-table, whence, I suppose, she had taken it:</p>

  <p>"I thought 'twas a stranger to me. A fine stick it is, too, and a trusty
  companion 'twould be on a dark night and a lonely road."</p>

  <p>To this I made no reply; and when she had glanced at the clock and peered
  curiously into my father's hat, which stood on the table, she turned abruptly
  and left the room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-07"
     id="ch-1-07"></a>VII. &mdash; THE TERMS OF RELEASE</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Mrs. Gregg had gone, I shut the door, and, sinking on
  to the chair by the writing-table, tried to collect my thoughts. But though I
  was vaguely conscious that this dreadful disaster vitally affected my
  position, and must in some way affect my actions, overwhelming grief and a
  sense of irreparable loss rendered coherent thought impossible. My father was
  dead. That was all I could think of. My one perfect friend, who had absorbed
  all my affection and given me all of his, had gone out of my life.
  Henceforward I was alone in the world.</p>

  <p>Presently I heard Dr. Bury leave the house, and then the door opened, and
  Mr. Otway came into the room, looking like a man who had risen prematurely
  after a severe illness. He dropped limply on a chair, and sat, with his hands
  on his knees, looking at me with a pitiable expression of misery and
  consternation.</p>

  <p>"This is a terrible affair, Helen," he said in a broken voice. "Terrible!
  Terrible!"</p>

  <p>I made no reply, but looked at him, half-curiously and resentfully. In the
  extremity of my grief, I had no pity to spare for him who was the cause of
  this dreadful calamity.</p>

  <p>"Won't you speak to me, Helen?" he said, imploringly. "Won't you try to
  give me some comfort? Think of the awful position I am in."</p>

  <p>At his miserable egotism, my grief blazed up into sudden wrath.</p>

  <p>"You!" I exclaimed, scornfully. "And what of me? You have robbed me of my
  father&mdash;of all that matters to me in life&mdash;and now you ask me to
  comfort you!"</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hands to me with a gesture of entreaty.</p>

  <p>"Don't say that, Helen!" he implored. "Don't say I robbed you of him. It
  was an accident that no one could foresee. And after all, you know, Helen,"
  he added, persuasively, "if you have lost a father, you have gained a devoted
  husband."</p>

  <p>At these words I gazed at him in utter amazement; and quite suddenly the
  confusion of my thoughts began to clear up. I began to realise that some
  action was called for, though what that action was I could not clearly see at
  the moment. But what I did see quite clearly was that the thing he was
  suggesting was utterly unthinkable.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose, Mr. Otway," I demanded, "that I could possibly live with
  you as your wife after what has happened?"</p>

  <p>"But you are my wife, Helen," he protested.</p>

  <p>"I agreed to marry you, Mr. Otway, in order to save my father. My father
  has not been saved."</p>

  <p>"That was, no doubt, your motive, Helen," he answered. "I don't deny that.
  But, actually, you agreed to be my wife on certain specific conditions, which
  I carried out&mdash;or, at least, was prepared&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hesitated with sudden embarrassment; and the embarrassment, with the
  statement, in the midst of which he had broken off, gave me my cue.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Otway," I said, "you had a letter from my father. What was in that
  letter?"</p>

  <p>At this question his self-possession broke down completely.</p>

  <p>"I have had no letter," he stammered; "at least, that is to say, I haven't
  seen&mdash;he spoke of a letter, but&mdash;but the fact is, in my excitement
  this morning I forgot to look at my correspondence. If there was a letter, it
  must be in the box still."</p>

  <p>"Let us go and see if it is there," said I. My confusion of mind was fast
  clearing up, and as my wits returned, I found myself shaping a definite
  course of action. I rose and accompanied him to the hall door and stood by
  while he unlocked the letter-box. As he opened the trap, I perceived that the
  box contained a single letter; and even in that agitating moment, the
  significance of the fact struck me. It was strange, indeed, that the
  morning's delivery should bring to a man of business no more than a single
  letter.</p>

  <p>He picked the missive out, and, having glanced at it, handed it to me. I
  looked at it, and, perceiving that it was in my father's handwriting, tore
  open the envelope and drew out the letter, which I read aloud. It ran
  thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Stonebury, Maidstone.</p>

  <p>"25th April, 1908.</p>

  <p>"Dear Otway,</p>

  <p>"You will, no doubt, be glad to learn that our little difficulty is at an
  end. The unexpected has happened. My friend has been able to raise the
  wherewith to repay the loan that I made to him, and has sent a cheque for the
  full amount. I have paid it into my bank, but, as a measure of security, in
  view of the magnitude of the sum, I am waiting until the cheque is cleared
  before sending you mine. However, you may expect to receive payment in full
  in the course of three clear days from this date.</p>

  <p>"With many thanks for your forbearance,</p>

  <p>"I am, yours very truly,</p>

  <p>"W. H. VARDON."</p>

  <p>As I finished reading, I looked Mr. Otway sternly in the face.</p>

  <p>"You realize," I said, "that this letter makes our agreement void?"</p>

  <p>He did not reply immediately, but stood with his eyes averted from me and
  his fingers working nervously.</p>

  <p>"Do you realize that?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well, in a way, yes," he replied, hesitatingly. "If it had reached me
  sooner&mdash;that is to say, if I had seen it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you had seen it!" I interrupted, angrily. "What has that to do with
  the question? The letter was delivered to you, as the post-mark shows, before
  you left the house. It came by the first post. If you chose to leave it
  unopened, that is your affair. When you met me this morning, the agreement
  was already at an end."</p>

  <p>He glanced nervously along the hall towards the kitchen stairs.</p>

  <p>"We needn't stand here," he said. "Let us go into the study and talk this
  affair over quietly."</p>

  <p>He led the way back to the room we had left, and, having shut the door,
  turned to me deprecatingly.</p>

  <p>"It's an unfortunate business, Helen," he said. "Very unfortunate. Of
  course, I ought to have looked over the morning's post, but, in my natural
  excitement, I overlooked it; and now I don't see that there is anything for
  us to do but make the best of it."</p>

  <p>I looked at him in amazement. "But," I exclaimed, "you don't seem to
  realize that our agreement was at an end before the marriage took place."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," he replied. "You see this letter is only a
  notification&mdash;a conditional promise to pay. It doesn't discharge the
  debt."</p>

  <p>At this my patience gave out completely. "Let us have no evasions or
  quibbles, Mr. Otway," I said. "Our agreement was at an end before the
  marriage took place, and I have no doubt that you knew it. You obtained my
  consent by fraud."</p>

  <p>"I don't admit that," said he. "But even if it were so, what would you
  propose?"</p>

  <p>"I propose to have the marriage annulled," I replied.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "That is impossible, Helen," he said. "The marriage is
  not voidable. An action for nullity can be sustained only on certain
  conditions, none of which exist in our case."</p>

  <p>"But," I exclaimed, "my consent was obtained on a fraudulent pretence!
  Surely that is a sufficient ground for claiming to have the marriage
  annulled!"</p>

  <p>"I deny the fraud," he replied, doggedly. "But in any case it is not
  material. The marriage was perfectly regular, you are of full adult age, you
  gave your consent without compulsion, and there are none of those impediments
  which the law recognises. I assure you, Helen, that our marriage is not
  voidable&mdash;that it cannot be annulled by ordinary process."</p>

  <p>Little as I trusted to his truth or honour, I suspected that what he was
  now saying was true. But yet the position was unthinkable.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me," I demanded, "that the law would uphold a
  marriage between a woman and the murderer of her father?"</p>

  <p>He winced as if I had struck him a blow, and his face grew sensibly
  paler.</p>

  <p>"For the love of God, Helen," he entreated, "don't talk like that! You
  don't believe it. I can see you don't. You know I did not kill your
  father."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing," I replied, "but this&mdash;that when I came into the
  room my father was lying dead with a wound on his forehead and that you were
  standing over him with a formidable weapon in your hand."</p>

  <p>I thought he would have fainted. He sank into a chair with a gasp that was
  almost a sob, and the sweat streamed down his pallid face. He was a pitiable
  spectacle; but yet I felt no pity for him. I was bent only on escaping from
  the net in which he had caught me.</p>

  <p>"I swear I never touched him, Helen," he protested, breathlessly. "I swear
  it. But you know I did not. You are only saying this to torture me. You don't
  believe it. I know you don't."</p>

  <p>"It is of little importance what I believe, Mr. Otway." I replied, coldly.
  "The decision will not rest with me. You will be judged by others on the
  facts which I have stated."</p>

  <p>He made no immediate reply. He seemed absolutely paralysed by terror, and
  sat, breathing quickly and staring at me, as if he expected me to kill him
  then and there. At length he spoke in a husky, indistinct voice.</p>

  <p>"Helen. What is it you want of me?"</p>

  <p>"I want this marriage set aside," I answered.</p>

  <p>"But," he protested, "I have told you that is impossible. It cannot be
  annulled in the ordinary sense. Be reasonable, Helen. Let us talk the matter
  over and see if we can't come to terms."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, persuasively, "I should like to meet your wishes if I
  can. I am not unreasonable. I can see that, as things are, you would not wish
  to live with me as my wife. We can't get the marriage annulled, but we can
  arrange a separation&mdash;a temporary separation, say, without prejudice to
  any future arrangements&mdash;by mutual consent. What do you say to
  that?"</p>

  <p>"If the marriage cannot be set aside, I suppose a separation would be the
  next best thing. Do I understand that you are willing to agree to a
  separation?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied; "on certain conditions I am willing to agree to a
  separation&mdash;a temporary separation, you know."</p>

  <p>"What are your conditions?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He cleared his throat once or twice, as if in doubt how best to put the
  matter. Then, avoiding my eye, he began, hesitatingly, but with an
  obsequiously persuasive manner.</p>

  <p>"The exact circumstances of your father's most lamentable death, Helen,
  are known to you and to me and to no one else. As I have told you, and I am
  convinced that you believe, the heart attack which killed him came as we were
  struggling for possession of his stick. It was due to the excitement and the
  violent exertion. Perhaps the blow on the head from the corner of the
  mantelpiece may have had something to do with it, for the fainting attack
  came on almost directly afterwards. He relaxed his hold on the stick and
  fell, leaving it in my hands. There was no violence on my part. I never
  struck him or did anything that could in any way make me responsible for his
  death. That is the truth, Helen, and I am convinced that you believe it, in
  spite of what you have said."</p>

  <p>"I have only your word that it is the truth," said I.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he agreed. "But you believe me. You know what your father's
  state of health was, and you know that he was liable, on occasions, to be
  &mdash;er&mdash;somewhat violent. So you believe me. But others, who have not
  the knowledge that you have&mdash;ah&mdash;might&mdash;ah&mdash;might not
  believe me."</p>

  <p>"I haven't said that I do," I interposed. "However, we will let that pass.
  Go on, please."</p>

  <p>He paused to wipe his face with his handkerchief, and then proceeded:</p>

  <p>"You said just now that when you entered the room you saw me standing over
  your father with a weapon in my hand."</p>

  <p>"So I did."</p>

  <p>"I know you did, Helen. You saw me holding your father's loaded stick. It
  is quite true. But&mdash;it would&mdash;ah&mdash;greatly simplify matters
  if&mdash;well, if that circumstance were not communicated
  to&mdash;ah&mdash;to anyone else."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say," said I, "that you want me to suppress the fact that I
  saw you standing over my father's dead body holding a loaded stick?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't use the word 'suppress,' Helen," he replied, passing his
  handkerchief once more over his haggard face. "I only ask you to refrain
  &mdash;in the interests of justice and&mdash;ah&mdash;of common
  humanity&mdash;from mentioning a circumstance that&mdash;ah&mdash;mentioned,
  might mislead the hearers, and might, conceivably, lead them to quite
  erroneous conclusions. It is a reasonable thing to ask. No doubt you blame
  me; you look upon me as the cause of this dreadful trouble&mdash;which, in a
  certain sense, I admit I am. But you would not be vindictive, Helen, or
  unjust. You would not wish to see me placed in the dock&mdash;perhaps even
  convicted &mdash;think of that, Helen! Convicted and sentenced when I am
  absolutely innocent! My God! It would be an awful thing! You wouldn't wish to
  have such a frightful miscarriage of justice as that on your conscience, I am
  sure."</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be on my conscience," I replied, coldly. "The verdict would
  not be mine; and besides, I have only your word that you are innocent. You
  have made the statement to me, and you could make it to others, who would
  take it for what it is worth."</p>

  <p>He clasped his hands passionately and leaned forward towards me with an
  imploring gesture.</p>

  <p>"Helen!" he exclaimed. "Don't be so hard, so cold! Have you no pity for
  me? Think of my awful position&mdash;an innocent man, but yet with
  appearances so horribly against me. And the whole issue is in your hands. You
  were not present when&mdash;when it happened. You have only to say so and to
  refrain from making any unnecessary additions to that statement, and no
  miscarriage of justice can occur. I am not asking you to say anything that is
  not true; I am only asking you to keep irrelevant and misleading matter out
  of the inquiry. Do this, Helen, and I promise to execute a deed surrendering
  all claims on you&mdash;at least for a time."</p>

  <p>I made no immediate answer. Mr. Otway was perfectly right on one point. I
  did not believe that he had killed my father. I think I only half believed
  it, even, at the awful moment of the discovery; for the alarming appearance
  that my father had presented as he strode up the garden path, with his wild
  eyes and his strange, blotchy colour, had made me fear a catastrophe; and
  when the catastrophe had almost immediately followed, it was natural that my
  mind should refer it to a cause already considered rather than to one totally
  unexpected. Moreover, Mr. Otway's account of the tragedy was intrinsically
  probable; it fitted the facts that were known to me; whereas the supposition
  that he had killed my father was wildly improbable.</p>

  <p>It is not to be supposed, however, that, in my present agitated state, I
  reasoned the matter out consciously in this methodical fashion. But
  unconsciously, and perhaps vaguely, my mind had worked along these lines to a
  conclusion; and that conclusion was that Mr. Otway's account of what had
  happened was substantially correct. Nevertheless, I was not prepared to admit
  this at the moment; indeed, my whole desire was to be rid of the man's
  irksome presence&mdash;to be alone with my grief.</p>

  <p>"I can't give you an answer now, Mr. Otway," I said. "I am not in a
  condition to discuss anything. I want to go home and be quiet."</p>

  <p>He acquiesced with surprising readiness, no doubt encouraged by my tacit
  abandonment of the accusation.</p>

  <p>"Of course you do," he agreed. "It has been a fearful shock for you. Go
  home and keep yourself quiet. I shall hear from Dr. Bury, in the course of
  the day, what the coroner intends to do, and I will call and let you know.
  And I will bring a draft of the deed for you to look at. The sooner we arrive
  at a settlement, the better. And, Helen, let me beg you not to say anything
  to anyone about&mdash;anything that might complicate matters. You understand
  what I mean."</p>

  <p>I nodded wearily and moved towards the door. I was still wearing my
  outdoor clothes, so I had no preparations to make. Mr. Otway opened the door
  for me and I passed out into the hall; but before leaving the house, I turned
  back into the darkened drawing-room, and, raising the cover from my father's
  face, kissed his already cold cheek.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, dearest! Good-bye!" I whispered, passionately; and then,
  feeling the tears rushing to my eyes, I kissed him again, and, replacing the
  cover, hurried from the room. Mr Otway was standing at the hall door to let
  me out, and timidly offered his hand; but I walked quickly past him, and,
  running down the steps, made my way out through the gate that had admitted me
  to my ruin and my father to his death.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-08"
     id="ch-1-08"></a>VIII. &mdash; "WHOM GOD HATH JOINED&mdash;"</h2>

  <p class="first">OUR states of mind in certain unforeseen circumstances are
  sometimes surprising, even, to ourselves. As I walked away from Mr. Otway's
  house, I think I was dimly surprised at my own self-possession. The worst had
  happened. The calamity which I had feared, and which I had made such
  sacrifices to avert, had befallen; and yet I was comparatively calm. My heart
  ached, it is true, with a grief such as I had never known before; with a
  sense of irreparable loss and a feeling of utter loneliness and desolation;
  but yet, under it all was a certain indefinable peace.</p>

  <p>Looking back with more natural knowledge and experience, this state of
  mind is not difficult to understand. My father's sudden death was a crushing
  calamity; but, in the very moment of its happening, the incubus of my
  relation to Mr. Otway was lifted. For, though I was not at the time conscious
  of the fact, I now see clearly that, even as I passed out of the house of the
  man whom the law regarded as my husband, my mind was made up that I had done
  with Mr. Otway.</p>

  <p>Moreover, my new trouble was in other ways more easy to bear than the
  misery of the last few days. My marriage had seemed, in a manner, to put an
  end to my life. It had offered nothing but an unending vista of wretchedness,
  an unending submission to a state of things that was intolerable even to
  think of. But this new catastrophe was sudden and final. The blow had fallen,
  once for all; shattering, indeed, my present, but calling upon me instantly
  to make provision for the future. And in action, the necessity of which
  forced itself upon me even before I reached home, I found, if not relief from
  my sorrow, at least some temporary distraction.</p>

  <p>As I let myself in with my latch-key, our housemaid met me in the hall to
  announce that lunch had been waiting for some time, and to ask me if I knew
  at what time my father would come in.</p>

  <p>"My father is dead, Jessie," I replied. "He died suddenly at Mr. Otway's
  house about an hour ago. I can't tell you any more just now."</p>

  <p>I walked past her and ascended the stairs to my room, leaving her standing
  in the hall as if petrified; but, before I reached the landing, I heard her
  rush away towards the kitchen, making the house resound with her hysterical
  shrieks and lamentations. It was very dreadful and distressing, but yet it
  had a steadying effect on me, reminding me of my isolated position and of the
  need for firmness and self-control. In a few minutes I came down, and
  disregarding Jessie's sobs and tears, sat out the simple formalities of lunch
  as a matter of discipline and example, and even compelled myself to take a
  certain amount of food.</p>

  <p>As I sat at my silent and solitary meal, my thoughts were busy with the
  many things that had to be done. Not willingly, indeed; for I longed to be
  quiet and nurse my grief&mdash;to forget everything but my sorrow and my
  great bereavement. But that was impossible. I was practically alone in the
  world, for I had no near relatives, and all that had to be done must be done,
  or at least directed, by me. There was my father's funeral to be arranged,
  the business to be transferred or wound up, the property to be
  realised&mdash;and there was Mr. Otway.</p>

  <p>Naturally enough, my thoughts constantly came back to him. As to his moral
  claim on me, it was null and void. Whether he had, as I suspected, seen my
  father's letter and deliberately left it unopened, or whether he had simply
  neglected to look for it, made no difference. It had been delivered to him,
  and thereupon our agreement had ceased to exist. But if he had no moral
  claim, he had, apparently, a legal hold on me which would have to be
  considered. If he could be induced to surrender that, the position would be
  greatly simplified. And he was ready to surrender it on a certain
  condition.</p>

  <p>To Mr. Otway's proposal my thoughts came back again and again. The
  condition that he had made was not an unreasonable one, or, at least, it did
  not appear so to me. My father had died when they were alone together. They
  had admittedly been quarrelling; my father bore the mark of a heavy blow; and
  Mr. Otway had been found standing over the body with a loaded stick in his
  hand. The appearances suggested that he had killed my father. And yet I was
  convinced that he had not. Profoundly loathing him as the cause of all my
  misfortunes, I still felt that he was, in this respect, an innocent man; and
  common justice demanded that he should not be made to suffer for a crime that
  he had not committed.</p>

  <p>Now what was my position in the affair? Practically I held the scales of
  justice. The one absolutely damning fact was in my sole possession; and I
  alone, in all probability, would appreciate the misleading appearances which
  that fact created. That was my dilemma. I could make known the fact itself to
  those who should judge him, but could I make them understand how little it
  was worth? It seemed very doubtful. I had trembled for my father's safety and
  had seen him come in at the gate, already in a dangerous condition. They had
  not. They might easily fail to weigh his state of health against that one,
  apparently, sinister fact of the loaded stick. In short, it came to this:
  that if I mentioned what I had seen, Mr. Otway ran a serious risk of being
  punished for a crime which he had not committed, whereas if I refrained from
  mentioning it, justice would take its proper course.</p>

  <p>That, I think, is, in effect, how I argued. Neither the logician nor the
  jurist will commend me. But women have their own ways of looking at things,
  and one of those ways is somewhat to confuse conviction with knowledge. A
  thing firmly believed is apt to present itself as a thing known. I had come
  to the conclusion that Mr. Otway was innocent of my father's death, and
  having done so, had unconsciously treated his innocence as a fact that was
  within my knowledge.</p>

  <p>After lunch, I telephoned to the office, asking Mr. Jackson, my father's
  managing clerk, to come and see me; and while I was waiting for him, I took
  down from the study shelves a treatise of the Law of Husband and Wife, and
  turned over those of its unsavoury pages which dealt with suits for nullity.
  Apparently Mr. Otway was right. So far as I could make out, the circumstances
  of our marriage afforded no grounds for such a suit. I was married
  irrevocably. My complete freedom was gone beyond recall; I should have to be
  content with such incomplete freedom as is conferred by a deed of
  separation.</p>

  <p>I had just returned the book to the shelf when Mr. Jackson arrived and
  entered the room looking very flurried and uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"What a dreadful thing this is, Miss Vardon!" he exclaimed. "Shocking!
  Shocking! So unexpected! I need not say how much we all sympathize with
  you."</p>

  <p>"It is very kind of you," I said, offering him a chair.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he rejoined. "It is a terrible misfortune for all of us.
  Would it distress you very much to tell me how it happened?"</p>

  <p>"It was for that purpose that I sent for you, Mr. Jackson; to tell you
  exactly what has happened and to ask your advice," and here I gave him a
  brief account of the events of the morning.</p>

  <p>At the mention of my marriage he looked profoundly surprised, but also, I
  thought, distinctly relieved; but he did not make any comment until I had
  finished the whole tragic story, when he remarked:</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to hear that you are married, Miss Vardon&mdash;or rather,
  I should say, Mrs. Otway&mdash;to a man of such very substantial means, if I
  am rightly informed."</p>

  <p>"Why are you glad?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Because," he replied, "it disposes of rather a difficulty. Your father
  was a man of great abilities and an excellent lawyer, but he was somewhat
  inattentive to the financial side of his profession. I am afraid you would
  have been left rather badly provided for."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear that," said I, "because I am not proposing to live
  with Mr. Otway. I have asked him to agree to a separation."</p>

  <p>Mr Jackson raised his eyebrows. "May I ask why?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to go into details just now," I answered, "but I may say
  that the marriage was an affair of accommodation; I supposed my father to be
  in a position of embarrassment, and I made the arrangement with Mr. Otway
  without his knowledge. It turns out that I was mistaken. He was not
  embarrassed. When the marriage took place, I was under a misapprehension and
  I was misled by Mr. Otway. Accordingly, I have asked to have a separation
  deed drawn up."</p>

  <p>"Does he agree to the separation?"</p>

  <p>"He has not yet, but I think he will; so I shall have to consider my
  resources, after all."</p>

  <p>"But," Mr Jackson objected, "he will have to make you an allowance."</p>

  <p>"That," I said, "is impossible. If I repudiate the marriage, I could not,
  of course, allow him to support me."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" demanded Mr. Jackson. "He is legally bound to. You are his
  wife. While the marriage stands, you can't marry anybody else. Besides, he is
  not likely to raise any objection. He is a lawyer, you know."</p>

  <p>"I am not thinking of him: I am thinking of myself. I wish to be under no
  obligations to Mr. Otway, and I shall not accept any assistance from
  him."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear you say that," Mr. Jackson said, gloomily; "because I
  am afraid you will be rather badly off. The business is a very personal one,
  and is worth practically nothing to sell. If I were a qualified solicitor, I
  might be able to carry it on. But I'm not; and I doubt if anyone would care
  to buy the good-will at any price. Still, I'll see what can be done. As to
  your father's will, I happen to know that you are the residuary
  legatee&mdash;practically the sole legatee&mdash;but what that amounts to, I
  shouldn't like to say. Mighty little, I fear. However, it's of no use to
  worry you with these matters now. If you will authorize me to look into your
  father's affairs, I will let you know exactly how things stand; and if I
  could be of service to you in any way, I hope you'll let me know. There's the
  funeral, for instance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused suddenly, and ran an uncomfortable eye along the rows of law
  books on the shelves.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind, Mr. Jackson," I said, "and your help will be
  invaluable. As my father's friend, I should like you to take charge of the
  funeral arrangements, if you would be so good."</p>

  <p>The rest of our conversation was concerned with the various things which
  had to be done during the next day or two, and it left with a feeling of the
  warmest gratitude to this quiet and rather dry man of business, whose
  sympathy took such a practical and acceptable form.</p>

  <p>It was past six o'clock when the red-eyed Jessie came to the study to
  announce that Mr. Otway was waiting in the drawing-room; and there I found
  him wandering restlessly round by the walls and making a show of examining
  the pictures. He was still very pale and looked haggard and weary, but yet he
  held out his hand to me with a certain confidence.</p>

  <p>"I think, Helen," said he, "that you will be a little relieved at my news.
  I have seen Dr. Bury, and he tells me that the coroner will be satisfied with
  his evidence and Dr. Sharpe's."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that there is to be no inquest?" I demanded, with sudden
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>"No, no," he replied. "Of course, there will be an inquest. But the
  coroner thinks that the circumstances do not call for a post-mortem. I
  thought you would be glad to know that. The&mdash;er&mdash;body will remain
  where it is until the jury have viewed it, and then it can be brought here
  for the&mdash;ah&mdash;the funeral."</p>

  <p>I nodded but made no comment on this statement, and he continued after a
  brief pause:</p>

  <p>"I suppose, Helen, you would like me to act for you in regard to the
  funeral arrangements."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr. Otway," I replied, "but Mr. Jackson has very kindly
  undertaken that for me."</p>

  <p>He looked somewhat crestfallen at this, and said, deprecatingly:</p>

  <p>"I am sorry you did not leave the arrangements to me. It would have looked
  better." Which it undeniably would&mdash;from his point of view.</p>

  <p>As I made no rejoinder, there followed a slightly uncomfortable pause,
  during which he was evidently bracing himself up for what was the real object
  of his visit. At length he began nervously:</p>

  <p>"Have you been able to give any more consideration to my proposal,
  Helen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered; "I have thought about it a good deal. Perhaps we had
  better go into the study, which is more out of the way of the servants than
  this."</p>

  <p>We crossed the hall, and, when we had entered the study and closed the
  door, I resumed:</p>

  <p>"I may as well say, Mr. Otway, that I am prepared to accept your
  statement. On reflection, I believe that your account of what happened is
  true."</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that!" he ejaculated. "I felt sure you believed me, Helen;
  but it is an unspeakable relief to hear you say so. And I am sure you will
  agree with me that the&mdash;the apparently incriminating circumstance need
  not be mentioned."</p>

  <p>"I might even agree to that," I replied; "but there must be a clear
  understanding. I am not going to say anything that is not strictly true."</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly not!" he agreed. "All that I ask is that you refrain from
  volunteering a perfectly unnecessary and misleading statement. Will you
  promise to do that?"</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that I have any right to make such a promise, Mr. Otway;
  but still, on the conditions that you mentioned, I am prepared to do so."</p>

  <p>His relief was really pathetic. Its intensity made me understand what
  torments of terror he had been suffering. He flung out his hands as if he
  would have embraced me, but drew back, as I said, coldly:</p>

  <p>"You are prepared on your side, Mr. Otway, to carry out your part? You
  agree to execute a deed of separation, as I asked?</p>

  <p>"If you insist," he replied. "It's a hard bargain, but if you hold me to
  it, I have no choice. Would not a short, informal separation do?"</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Otway," I replied firmly, "it would not. I am acting somewhat
  against my conscience in agreeing to suppress this fact, and I want full
  compensation for doing so. I must have a legally valid deed of
  separation."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Helen," said he; "if it must be, it must. I hope that, later,
  you will take a kinder view of our relations, but meanwhile I will do exactly
  as you wish. I have drafted out a deed, in a simple form, with as little
  legal verbiage as possible. If its terms satisfy you, I will copy it out and
  sign it."</p>

  <p>He handed me a sheet of paper on which the deed was drafted, and I read it
  through carefully. Like the other documents that he had drawn up, it was
  lucid, simple and concise, and set forth quite fairly the conditions to which
  he had agreed, with one exception. It determined automatically at the end of
  three months.</p>

  <p>"I can't agree to that," I said. "There must be no specified time; it is
  to be just a separation."</p>

  <p>"But," he exclaimed, "you don't propose that the separation should last
  for ever, do you?"</p>

  <p>That was precisely what I did propose, but I thought it politic not to
  express myself too definitely.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible," I replied, "to say what may happen in the future; but
  if you make the separation determinable by mutual consent, that will provide
  for all eventualities."</p>

  <p>He agreed, with a somewhat wry smile, that this was so, and then asked how
  soon I should like to have the deed executed.</p>

  <p>"As it must be signed before I give my evidence," I replied, "it had
  better be done now. If you will make two copies, I will go and fetch the
  maids to witness the signatures."</p>

  <p>"Dear me, Helen!" he exclaimed. "What an extra ordinarily business-like
  young lady you are! But I suppose you are right; only I would suggest that
  you do not acquaint the witnesses with the nature of the document. We don't
  want to take the world into our confidence, especially just now."</p>

  <p>This was reasonable enough, though it would obviously be impossible to
  keep the world in the dark as to our position, particularly after what I had
  said to Mr. Jackson. However, I agreed to maintain a discreet reticence, and
  when he had made the two copies&mdash;which I carefully read through&mdash;I
  went out and called Jessie and the cook.</p>

  <p>"I want you," said I, "to witness my signature and Mr. Otway's to a couple
  of documents. You have just to see us sign our names and then sign your own
  underneath."</p>

  <p>The two women came into the study with an air of mystery and awe, gazing
  furtively from me to Mr. Otway. The two documents lay on the table, each with
  a sheet of blotting paper spread over it, exposing only the blank spaces
  which were to receive the signatures, on each of which a red wafer seal had
  been stuck. Mr. Otway signed first, and then, indicating to the cook the
  place where she was to write her name, placed the pen in her hand.</p>

  <p>"That's right," said he, when she had painfully and with protruded tongue,
  executed the signature of 'Ivy Stokes.' "Now you will do the same with the
  other paper as soon as Mrs. Otway has signed."</p>

  <p>The cook gazed curiously at me as I signed the second document, and then,
  in the same strained and laborious fashion, traced the scrawling characters
  over the name that I had lightly pencilled in for her guidance. Having
  watched with feverish interest while I marked the next space, she drew back
  and made way for Jessie, who, by watching her colleague, had learned what was
  required of her.</p>

  <p>When the formalities were completed and the two maids dismissed&mdash;to
  discuss these strange proceedings, doubtless, in the kitchen&mdash;Mr. Otway
  handed me the copy, bearing his signature, and, taking the other, rose to
  depart.</p>

  <p>"Before I go, Helen," he said, "there is one matter to settle. In the
  document I thought it best to say nothing about an allowance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You were quite right," I interrupted. "Of course, I should not ask for,
  or accept, any allowance under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>"You won't need one at present," said he. "We know there are five thousand
  pounds lying to your father's credit at his bank&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That money was not his," I said, "and it is not mine. As soon as the will
  is proved it will be paid to you on behalf of your clients."</p>

  <p>"But that is quite unnecessary, Helen," said he. "The use, for an
  unspecified time, of that sum of money was the consideration in respect of
  which you agreed to marry me. As the marriage has taken place, it is only
  fair and reasonable that you should receive the consideration. In effect,
  that five thousand is yours by the terms of our agreement."</p>

  <p>I was on the point of replying that our agreement was null and void, and
  that I had no intention of carrying out its conditions; but prudence
  whispered that I had better keep my intentions to myself, at least as to my
  ultimate conduct. Besides which, Mr. Otway's statement was not entirely
  correct, as I proceeded to point out.</p>

  <p>"The use of this money," I said, "was to relieve my father, who was
  assumed to be insolvent. But it appears that he was not insolvent; and it is
  my intention that all his debts shall be paid, in so far as there are funds
  to meet them. It is certainly what he would have wished."</p>

  <p>"But," Mr. Otway protested, "supposing the payment of these debts should
  consume all the available assets? How are you going to live?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I shall do as other women do when they have no independent
  means. I shall work for my living. But it is premature to discuss that until
  I have had Mr. Jackson's report. I don't suppose I shall be absolutely
  penniless."</p>

  <p>He shook his head gloomily. "You are Quixotic, Helen, and wrong-headed,
  too. There is no reason why you should work for your living. As a married
  woman, you are entitled to maintenance, and I am willing, and even anxious,
  to maintain you. But I won't press the matter now. If you want money, you
  know that you can have it, not as a favour but as a right, And now there is
  just one other matter that I want to speak about. In the deed of separation I
  said nothing about our relations other than was actually necessary. I made no
  stipulation as to your keeping me informed of your whereabouts; but I ask you
  now, if you should be leaving Maidstone, to let me have your address and to
  allow me to keep up communication with you. It is a reasonable request,
  Helen, and I am sure you will not hesitate to accede to it."</p>

  <p>I did hesitate, however, for some time. In truth, I was not at all willing
  to agree to this proposal. My wish was to sponge Mr. Otway, once and for all,
  out of my life and to make a fresh start. Still, the request was a reasonable
  one, and could, I suspected, have been enforced as a demand; and, in the end,
  though very reluctantly, I yielded.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Helen," said he, holding out his hand; "then I won't worry you
  any more just now. It is understood that I am not to lose sight of you, and
  that if you should want help, pecuniary or other, you will let me know. And I
  may rely on you to say no more at the inquest than is actually
  necessary?"</p>

  <p>I gave him the required assurance on this point, and, having somewhat
  frigidly shaken his hand, accompanied him to the hall door and let him
  out.</p>

  <p>As I stood in the open doorway, watching him walk away up the street in
  his heavy, elephantine fashion, a man entered at the gate, and, approaching
  with a deferential and rather uncomfortable air, took off his hat and offered
  me a small, blue envelope, which bore the superscription "Mrs. Lewis Otway."
  I took it from him, and, closing the door, went back to the study, where I
  opened the envelope and extracted the little slip of blue paper that it
  enclosed; which turned out, as I had expected, to be the subpoena to the
  Inquest. I glanced through the peremptory phrases of the summons, and, laying
  the slip of paper on the table, went up to my own room to be quiet and think
  upon all that lay before me.</p>

  <p>But thought&mdash;orderly, useful thought&mdash;was impossible. Everything
  around me spoke of the life that had been so tragically broken off, rather
  than of the future that loomed so vague and empty before me. The open book on
  the reading-stand, the hastily scribbled notes upon the writing-block, the
  unanswered letters and a little pile of rough drawings on the table, all
  seemed to call to me to take up afresh the thread that had been dropped;
  seemed to interpose the unfinished past before the uncommenced future.
  Restlessly I wandered down to the workshop&mdash;where the coal scuttle still
  stood on the bench, a mute but eloquent memorial of that tragic final
  evening&mdash;only to gather a fresh sense of loss and desolation. And so,
  for the rest of the day, I haunted the house like some unquiet spirit,
  watched with pity, not unmixed with fear, by the awe-stricken servants,
  tearless and outwardly calm, but inwardly torn by grief and a sense of
  bereavement that seemed to intensify moment by moment.</p>

  <p>And yet, when, in the silence of the night, the tears came at last, and my
  sorrow, no longer mute, voiced itself in sobs and moans of pain, still, under
  the feeling of utter bereavement and desolation, was a half-felt sense of
  peace, of respite, and reprieve.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-09"
     id="ch-1-09"></a>IX. &mdash; TESTIMONY AND COUNSEL</h2>

  <p class="first">THOSE who are apt to refer in contemptuous terms to the
  artificiality of the plots of the novelist must have failed to observe the
  orderly way in which events arrange themselves in real life; how the
  circumstances of the vital and essential happenings of our lives may, if
  attentively considered, be separated out in a coherent group of causes and
  effects as closely knit and inevitably connected as the parts of the
  story-teller's plot.</p>

  <p>The reflection is suggested to me by the distressing experiences of the
  inquest on my father's death. Clearly enough, indeed, did I realise at the
  time that this would never have been but for those fateful words so
  calamitously overheard by me, and for my ill-considered, though well-meant,
  efforts to avert the apparently impending catastrophe. But I realised not at
  all&mdash;as, indeed, how should I?&mdash;that this day of sorrow, of shame
  and humiliation, was not only the harvest of the irrevocable past but the
  seed-time of an even more momentous future.</p>

  <p>As I approached the school-house in which the inquest was to be held, I
  observed Mr. Otway pacing slowly up and down the little court-yard. He was
  pale and haggard, and though he preserved his usual ponderously reposeful
  manner, it was not difficult to see that he was in a state of intense,
  nervous excitement and suppressed anxiety.</p>

  <p>He was evidently waiting for me, and turned to meet me as I entered the
  gate.</p>

  <p>"I thought we had better go in together, Helen," he said, as we exchanged
  a formal greeting. "They know that we are married, and, of course, they don't
  know that our&mdash;ah&mdash;our arrangements are in&mdash;ah&mdash;in
  suspense. And it would perhaps be as well if no reference were made
  to&mdash;ah&mdash;to those&mdash;ahem&mdash;temporary modifications
  which&mdash;ah&mdash;in short, to our provisional agreement."</p>

  <p>He looked at me deprecatingly and I nodded. There would be quite enough
  painful detail to be dragged into the light of day without this sordid
  addition. Besides, any reference to the deed of separation would start
  enquiries which neither of us desired, as was plainly evident to Mr. Otway;
  for he continued in a husky undertone, as we approached the schoolroom
  door:</p>

  <p>"And you will fulfil your part of our covenant faithfully, Helen, I am
  sure."</p>

  <p>"Most undoubtedly I shall," I replied. "But you will remember that our
  covenant does not include false evidence. I shall say as little as is
  possible, but if I am asked a direct question I must answer it, and answer it
  truthfully."</p>

  <p>"Of course you must," he agreed: "but it is often possible to ward off an
  inconvenient, question which may lead to others still more inconvenient."</p>

  <p>"You make take it," I said, "that I shall carry out my part of our bargain
  in the spirit as well as in the letter."</p>

  <p>With this assurance he appeared to be satisfied, and we now moved slowly
  towards the door of the school-house. While we had been talking, a party of
  men&mdash;the coroner and his jury&mdash;had filed past us and entered; and
  when we followed a minute later, we found them already in their places and
  the proceedings about to begin. We seated ourselves on the two chairs placed
  for us, which were next to those of the two medical witnesses, and as I
  glanced round the Court, I observed Mr. Jackson sitting near the coroner, and
  by his side a gentleman whose face I seemed to recognise, but to whom I could
  not give a name. Some dim recollection connected the quiet, strong,
  intellectual face with my father and the happy past, but not until near the
  close of the inquiry was I able to bring my memory to a clear focus.</p>

  <p>The attitude of the coroner and jury alike&mdash;they were all local men
  and most of them known to me&mdash;made my difficult task as easy as was
  possible. They were all anxious to spare me to the utmost and to make the
  best of what the coroner described as "a grievous and terrible calamity."
  Moreover, they restrained in the most delicate manner their evident curiosity
  as to the relations of Mr. Otway and myself. But, of course, the facts had to
  be given, and very distressing and humiliating it was to me to have to
  confess to what must have looked like a mere sordid intrigue with the uncouth
  creature at my side.</p>

  <p>As the only person present when the death occurred, Mr. Otway was
  necessarily the first witness; and a very nervous, hesitating witness he was;
  and very fortunate was it for him that he had so sympathetic a court. As he
  stammered out his evidence I noted, again and again, the searching, grey eye
  of the strange gentleman fixed upon him, not indeed with any obvious
  distrust, but with the most concentrated attention.</p>

  <p>"Do we understand," asked the coroner, "that Mr. Vardon was angry and
  excited when he arrived at your house?</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;furiously angry."</p>

  <p>"Do you know why he was angry and excited?"</p>

  <p>Yes, the witness did know. And as he proceeded to relate, in husky,
  uncertain tones, the circumstances of the secret marriage, more than one of
  the jurymen glanced from him to me with hardly-concealed astonishment; and I
  felt my face burning and my eyes filling with humiliation.</p>

  <p>"Was there any reason for this secrecy?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The deceased had already refused his consent to the marriage."</p>

  <p>"But that is hardly a reason for secrecy in the case of an adult. Could he
  have prevented the marriage from taking place?"</p>

  <p>"No. But it seemed better to&mdash;ah&mdash;to avoid discussion and
  unpleasantness."</p>

  <p>The coroner looked dissatisfied. He considered a few moments, and then
  asked: "Do you know why the deceased objected to the marriage?</p>

  <p>"I think he considered that the&mdash;ah&mdash;the inequality of age was
  undesirable," Mr. Otway replied.</p>

  <p>Still the coroner looked dissatisfied, and as he paused to reflect, and
  the jurymen looked at him expectantly, Mr. Otway furtively wiped his forehead
  with his handkerchief. Evidently, he was profoundly disturbed, as well he
  might be; for if this line of inquiry were pursued much farther, it must
  inevitably lay bare the real nature of the transaction.</p>

  <p>At length the coroner turned to the jury. "Well, gentlemen," said he, "I
  suppose the question is not very material. It is clear that the deceased was
  extremely excited and angry. The ultimate cause of his anger is, perhaps, not
  very relevant to the subject of our inquiry."</p>

  <p>To this the foreman of the jury readily agreed, and I could almost see the
  sigh of relief with which Mr. Otway hailed the passing of this perilous
  incident&mdash;a relief in which I participated to no small extent.</p>

  <p>The narrative was now resumed, and as it proceeded, Mr. Otway's voice
  became more and more husky and his speech more hesitating. He had a difficult
  course to steer, and his nerves were at their utmost tension. He had to tell
  a consistent story without telling the whole truth, and he had to bear in
  mind that my evidence was yet to be given. It was a position that might have
  shattered the nerve of a much bolder man than Mr. Otway.</p>

  <p>"You tell us that the deceased was violent and threatening in his manner.
  Do you mean that he was physically violent?</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;at least he threatened to use physical violence."</p>

  <p>"He did not actually assault you?"</p>

  <p>"Not actually. The blow that he aimed&mdash;at least that he was about to
  aim &mdash;ah&mdash;did not&mdash;er&mdash;did not take effect."</p>

  <p>The coroner's brows puckered into a puzzled frown. "This is not quite
  clear," said he. "Did he or did he not aim a blow at you?"</p>

  <p>"He did&mdash;at least, that is to say, he appeared&mdash;" here Mr. Otway
  mopped his streaming forehead&mdash;"well, I think he actually raised
  his&mdash;ah&mdash;his &mdash;ah&mdash;his clenched fist."</p>

  <p>"Did you have to restrain him?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Mr. Otway, with rather unnecessary emphasis. "No, I did not.
  I stepped back, and&mdash;ah&mdash;the incident&mdash;ah&mdash;passed. In
  fact, it was at this moment that the fatal attack occurred."</p>

  <p>"Tell us exactly what happened then."</p>

  <p>"He suddenly turned very pale," said Mr. Otway, speaking now with more
  fluency as he got back to the narration of the actual events, "and seemed to
  stand unsteadily. Then he staggered backwards and fell, striking his head on
  the corner of the mantelpiece."</p>

  <p>"Did he appear to have fainted before he struck his head?</p>

  <p>"I should say, yes, but&mdash;ah&mdash;I would not&mdash;ah&mdash;I was
  very agitated and alarmed&mdash;and&mdash;ah&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. But you would say that the fainting attack preceded the blow
  on the head?"</p>

  <p>"There was no blow," Mr. Otway exclaimed quickly; and then, perceiving his
  mistake, he added, hastily, "that is to say, you are referring to his
  striking the corner of the mantelpiece?"</p>

  <p>"That is what you were telling us about."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I should say that he struck&mdash;or rather that he fainted and
  staggered and that he struck his head in falling."</p>

  <p>Once more the coroner paused and seemed to reflect; and in the intense
  silence and stillness that enveloped the court my eye travelled from the
  huge, ungainly figure of the witness to the face of the tall stranger by Mr.
  Jackson's side. And a very striking face it was: a handsome, symmetrical
  face, but strangely&mdash;almost unhumanly&mdash;reposeful and impassive.
  Yet, though it was as immobile as a mask of stone, it conveyed an impression
  of intense attention&mdash;almost of watchfulness; and the clear, grey eyes
  never moved from the face of the witness. To me there was something a little
  uncanny and disturbing in that immovable mask and that steady, unrelaxing
  gaze. I found myself hoping that those searching grey eyes would not be fixed
  on me in that relentless observation when my turn came to give my evidence.
  And even as this thought flitted through my mind, I remembered who this
  stranger was. He was a Dr. Thorndyke, an old, though not very intimate,
  friend of my father's, a famous criminal lawyer and a great authority on
  medical jurisprudence. I had met him only once, when he had dined, many years
  ago, at our house; but I had often heard my father speak of him in terms of
  the highest admiration.</p>

  <p>When the coroner resumed his interrogation, it seemed that the crisis was
  past, so far as Mr. Otway was concerned, for his first question was: "What
  did you do when the deceased fell down?</p>

  <p>"For a moment or two," was the reply, "I was too bewildered to do
  anything. Then his daughter&mdash;my wife&mdash;came into the room, and, as
  he appeared to be dying or dead, I went off to fetch a doctor."</p>

  <p>This virtually concluded his evidence, and the next name called was my
  own, which, in its new form&mdash;Helen Otway&mdash;I heard with a start of
  surprise and something like disgust. As I rose to approach the table, I
  caught an instantaneous glance&mdash;a terrified, imploring glance&mdash;from
  Mr. Otway; and as my eye lighted immediately afterwards on Dr. Thorndyke's
  face, I felt that this momentary look, too, had been noted by that inexorably
  attentive grey eye. But I was relieved to observe that he did not look at me,
  but, as I gave my evidence, fixed a steady, introspective gaze upon a spot
  upon the opposite wall.</p>

  <p>My task turned out to be easier than I had hoped, though perhaps it might
  have been less easy if I had had more time to reflect on the significance of
  the questions. The coroner began by expressing the sympathy of the court with
  my bereavement and apologizing for imposing on me the painful duty of
  attending the inquiry. Then he asked: "You have heard the evidence of Mr.
  Otway with reference to your marriage and your father's attitude in regard to
  it. Do you confirm what he has said?</p>

  <p>"I do," I replied.</p>

  <p>"You were not present at the interview of Mr. Otway with the
  deceased?"</p>

  <p>"No, I was not. When I entered the room my father was lying on the floor
  and appeared to be already dead."</p>

  <p>"Had you seen your father since the solemnization of the marriage?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him from the window as he entered Mr. Otway's garden."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice anything unusual in his appearance?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; his appearance alarmed me very much. He seemed excessively excited,
  and his face was deeply flushed and of a strange, purplish colour."</p>

  <p>"Had you any special reason to be alarmed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I knew that his doctor had warned him to avoid all excitement and
  exertion on account of the weak state of his heart."</p>

  <p>"You did not hear what passed between your father and Mr. Otway?"</p>

  <p>"I heard my father ask where I was, and I heard Mr. Otway tell him that
  the marriage had taken place."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear anything more?"</p>

  <p>"My father then called Mr. Otway a scoundrel, and was still speaking
  loudly and angrily when the study door closed and I heard no more."</p>

  <p>"What made you go to the study?"</p>

  <p>"I heard and felt the shock when my father fell."</p>

  <p>"Would you mind telling us again in what condition you found your
  father?"</p>

  <p>"He appeared to be dead. His face was at first a livid grey, but it faded
  to marble whiteness as I looked at him. There was a small wound on the right
  side of his forehead and a drop of blood had run down on to his cheek and on
  his temple."</p>

  <p>The coroner glanced at the jurymen. "I think, gentlemen," he said, "that
  is all we need ask Mrs. Otway?"</p>

  <p>And when the foreman had acquiesced, and he had thanked me for "the very
  clear and lucid manner" in which I had given my evidence, I was permitted to
  resume my seat.</p>

  <p>"I can never thank you enough, Helen," whispered Mr. Otway, as I sat down.
  "You managed admirably&mdash;admirably."</p>

  <p>To this I made no reply; for now that the ordeal was over I began to be
  assailed by certain doubts as to whether I had been quite candid. I had told
  all that was really material to the inquiry; but&mdash;however, at this point
  Dr. Sharpe approached the table and picked up the Testament.</p>

  <p>His evidence practically settled the verdict. He testified that my father
  had suffered for some years from a dilated heart and arterial degeneration.
  "I warned him frequently to avoid excitement and undue exertion, for he was
  inclined to be careless and take liberties with himself."</p>

  <p>"You considered his state of health precarious?"</p>

  <p>"I thought he might fall down dead at any moment."</p>

  <p>"You have heard the evidence of the two previous witnesses. Does that
  evidence contain any suggestion to you as to the cause of death?"</p>

  <p>"It suggests to me that the deceased hurried to Mr. Otway's house in a
  towering rage, and that, during the interview, he worked himself up into a
  fury. I should say that the combined exertion and excitement brought on a
  fatal attack of syncope."</p>

  <p>"You think that death was caused by heart failure?"</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt of it."</p>

  <p>Dr. Bury's evidence was much to the same effect, though less positive.</p>

  <p>"The deceased had apparently been dead about half an hour when I arrived.
  The cause of death was not obvious, but the appearances were consistent with
  the account given by Mr. Otway. There was a small, contused wound at the
  junction of the forehead and right temple, apparently caused by the violent
  impact of some hard and blunt body. Judging by the small amount of bleeding,
  the wound had been sustained immediately before death. A single drop of blood
  had trickled down on to the cheek, and one or two drops on to the
  temple."</p>

  <p>"You have heard Mr. Otway's account of the way in which that wound was
  occasioned. Do you consider that the appearances are in agreement with that
  account?"</p>

  <p>"There is no disagreement. The appearance of the wound was consistent with
  its production in the manner described."</p>

  <p>"Would you say that it was probably so produced?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied Dr. Bury, "is a question for the jury. It might have been.
  I can't go beyond the appearances."</p>

  <p>"No, of course you can't. And is that all that you have to tell us?"</p>

  <p>"That is all," was the reply; and this virtually brought the inquiry to an
  end. After a brief summing-up by the coroner, the jury held an equally brief
  consultation and then unanimously returned a verdict of "Death from natural
  causes."</p>

  <p>On the announcement of the verdict everyone rose, including myself and Mr.
  Otway, and the latter, turning to me, said in a low voice:</p>

  <p>"I think I won't wait. I want to get home and be quiet; but I shall call
  on you to-morrow, if I may, to
  make&mdash;ah&mdash;any&mdash;ah&mdash;arrangements that&mdash;ah&mdash;in
  fact, to speak to you about the&mdash;ah&mdash;the funeral."</p>

  <p>"Very well," I said, reluctantly&mdash;for, deeply as I loathed him, I
  could not exclude him even from that sacred ceremony without creating an open
  scandal. "You had better come early in the forenoon." and with this I
  dismissed him with a stiff bow, and made my way to where Mr. Jackson and Dr.
  Thorndyke were standing. As I held out my hand to the latter and recalled to
  him our meeting years ago, Mr. Jackson said: "Dr. Thorndyke happened to be in
  Maidstone to-day and to call at our office, so I prevailed on him to come
  here and watch the proceedings on our behalf in case any complications should
  arise. But everything has gone off quite smoothly."</p>

  <p>"Very smoothly indeed," Dr. Thorndyke agreed, with, as it seemed to me, a
  certain degree of emphasis.</p>

  <p>"Both the coroner and the jury were most considerate," pursued Mr.
  Jackson.</p>

  <p>"Most considerate," assented Dr. Thorndyke; and again I seemed to detect a
  note of emphasis, as also, I think, did Mr. Jackson, for he glanced quickly
  at our companion, though he made no remark.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said I, "if you two gentlemen would care to come and take a
  cup of tea with me?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Jackson had an engagement at the office, and as Dr. Thorndyke appeared
  to hesitate, I added quickly: "I should be very glad if you could, though I
  don't wish to take up your time if you are busy."</p>

  <p>"My time is my own for the next three hours," said Dr. Thorndyke, "and if
  I should really not be an inopportune visitor, I should like very much to
  have tea with you."</p>

  <p>"Let us go, then," said I. "Mr. Jackson will accompany us as far as
  Gabriel's Hill, won't you?" And as my old friend assented with a prim, little
  bow, we set forth.</p>

  <p>"I have offered no condolences, Mrs. Otway," said Dr. Thorndyke. "I knew
  your father, I saw you and him together, and I realize what this loss must
  mean to you. There is nothing to say except that you have my most real
  sympathy."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," I said, and for a time we walked on in silence. And as we
  walked I found myself recalling, with a strong, speculative interest, that
  curious, subtle emphasis which Dr. Thorndyke had conveyed into his agreement
  with Mr. Jackson. At length, when we had dropped the latter near the Town
  Hall, I summoned up courage to raise the question.</p>

  <p>"I have an impression, Dr. Thorndyke, which may be quite a mistaken one,
  that you were not completely satisfied with the way in which the inquest was
  conducted. Am I mistaken?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he replied, slowly, "the coroner's methods were not what one would
  call rigorous."</p>

  <p>"I suppose they were not. But in what respect are you disposed to find
  fault with them?"</p>

  <p>"Principally," he replied, "in his failure to elicit a really conclusive
  verdict. The verdict of the jury was based upon Dr. Sharpe's opinion as to
  the cause of death. That opinion was probably correct, but it was based upon
  reasoning which was not sound. His position was this: If certain
  circumstances&mdash;excitement or exertion&mdash;should arise, there would be
  a great probability of their causing sudden death. But those circumstances
  had actually arisen and sudden death had actually followed. Therefore the
  death was due to the factors of the said circumstances. But this conclusion
  is fallacious. It does not prove a fact: it merely indicates a
  probability."</p>

  <p>"But are not all verdicts statements of probability?"</p>

  <p>"Too often they are. But it is a coroner's business to bring the
  conclusions of his court, as far as possible, into the region of ascertained
  fact. The immediate cause of death can usually be demonstrated by scientific
  methods, and the inquiry can then be built up on a foundation of certainty.
  Opinion should never be accepted where knowledge is obtainable."</p>

  <p>"Do you think, then, that the verdict was not a proper one?"</p>

  <p>"I am not criticizing the verdict," he replied, "but the methods by which
  it was arrived at. I think that the cause of death should have been
  established beyond all doubt before any contributory circumstances were
  inquired into."</p>

  <p>"But otherwise; apart from that one point?"</p>

  <p>"I thought the examination of the witnesses rather easy going. No doubt it
  elicited all the relevant facts. But that is impossible to decide on. One
  cannot judge of the relevancy of a fact until one has got the fact. I think,
  for instance, that most counsel would have pressed your husband a good deal
  more closely. The coroner appeared to decide that the matter was not relevant
  without being quite clear as to what matter he was dealing with."</p>

  <p>This, I must confess, had been my own impression, but I had been so
  relieved at the manner in which the difficult passages had been allowed to
  pass that I had been little disposed to criticise the considerate and
  sympathetic coroner. Nor did it seem quite safe to pursue the present
  discussion much farther, for it was tending in a rather dangerous direction.
  My own reservations began to weigh on me somewhat&mdash;and Dr. Thorndyke was
  not quite the same type of listener as the coroner. Nevertheless, the
  conversation pleased me, though I could not but be struck by the oddity of
  this detached discussion of a matter which was of such vital moment to me.
  But that very oddity was itself an element of gratification; for a woman is
  naturally flattered when an intellectual man appears to credit her with the
  power of impartial judgment of her own conduct and affairs&mdash;that faculty
  not being one by which our sex is peculiarly distinguished.</p>

  <p>But at this point, our discussion was brought naturally to an end by our
  arrival at my house&mdash;as I must now call it; and here a quick glance of
  surprised recognition on my companion's part gave me a new note of warning
  and prepared me for the inevitable question.</p>

  <p>"You are living at your father's house, I see."</p>

  <p>"I am, for the present. Mr. Otway remains in his own house."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I suppose it will be more convenient to settle everything up here
  before joining your husband."</p>

  <p>I was on the point of temporising by a vague assent; but my lips refused
  to frame the implied falsehood. It may have been my natural dislike of
  secrecy and concealment, it may be that my womanly pride resented the very
  idea of association with that unwieldy human spider. At any rate, an
  irresistible impulse drove me to say:</p>

  <p>"I am not going to join my husband at all, Dr. Thorndyke. I am not going
  to live with Mr. Otway."</p>

  <p>I did not look at Dr. Thorndyke as I made this statement, and he made no
  comment beyond a matter-of-fact "Indeed." But I had the feeling that, in the
  silence that followed, he was fitting this new fact into its place in some
  ordered scheme; that he was docketting it as an appendix to Mr. Otway's
  evidence.</p>

  <p>Nothing more was said until we had entered the house and I had given
  instructions for tea to be brought to the study. But in that interval I was
  aware of a growing impulse to have done with this miserable
  secrecy&mdash;this sordid fencing and dodging, which must come, in the end,
  to downright lying&mdash;and tell this strong, wise man the whole wretched
  story. Besides, I wanted counsel and guidance: and who was so fit to give
  them as he?</p>

  <p>Accordingly, when the tray had been laid on the study table, I re-opened
  the subject.</p>

  <p>"I did not mention this matter in my evidence," I said. "It had no bearing
  on the inquiry."</p>

  <p>"I am not clear," he replied, "that you were entitled to make any
  reservations. A witness's duty is to state the whole truth. The question of
  relevancy is for the court to consider."</p>

  <p>"But unfortunately there were other reservations that had to be made. Dr.
  Thorndyke, I want to tell you the whole story&mdash;in confidence&mdash;and
  to ask your advice."</p>

  <p>"I counsel you to make no confidences," he said, gravely, "unless you
  really wish to consult me in my professional capacity."</p>

  <p>"That is what I wish to do," I said.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said he. "That places us in the secure relation of lawyer and
  client; and I need not say that your father's daughter is very welcome to any
  help or advice that I can give."</p>

  <p>With this encouragement, I poured forth the story that I have told in
  these pages and in almost as much detail. But still I held back one fact. I
  said nothing of my having found Mr. Otway grasping my father's loaded stick.
  That single reservation had to be. Not only was I bound by a solemn promise;
  my silence on that point was the price of my release. The letter of the
  covenant, indeed, had reference only to my evidence at the inquest; but its
  spirit sealed my lips even in this my most intimate confidence.</p>

  <p>And so, once again, a secret guarded from a friendly eye remained, like a
  seed dropped in a summer's drought, to germinate and bring forth its fruit in
  its season.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-1-10"
     id="ch-1-10"></a>X. &mdash; THE TURNING OF THE PAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">DR. THORNDYKE listened to my recital of the history of the
  tragedy, not only with patience, but with close attention and apparently keen
  interest, interrupting me only at rare intervals to ask a question or
  elucidate some point that was not quite clear. When I had come to an end I
  was disposed to be apologetic, for I had told the story in the fullest
  detail, with only the single reservation that I have noted.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," I said, "that I have been rather victimizing you and
  trespassing on your very great patience."</p>

  <p>"By no means," he replied. "Men and men's actions and motives are my
  merchandise. If I could listen to a story like yours without the deepest
  interest I should not be in my present profession. But, now that I have heard
  it, I think I can guess the subject on which you wish to consult me. You
  would like to annul your marriage with Mr. Otway."</p>

  <p>"Yes; if it is possible."</p>

  <p>"It is very natural that you should wish to recover your freedom. I
  sympathize with you entirely, and I wish I could give you some encouragement.
  But I fear that you have no remedy."</p>

  <p>"It seems rather hard," I said, "that I should be bound for life to this
  man whom I detest and who has done me such grievous injuries."</p>

  <p>"It is very hard," he agreed, "and, humanly speaking, there ought to be
  some remedy. But the law provides none; nor is it really possible for the law
  to make provision for every imaginable contingency. Yours is a very
  exceptional case."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that; but it seems unreasonable to compel two people to
  maintain a relationship which is not only unsuitable but quite unreal."</p>

  <p>"It does," he admitted. "But the law takes a very unsentimental view of
  these matters. It regards marriage as an institution concerned with the
  establishment of families and the orderly devolution of property, and its
  interference is, in the main, limited to circumstances connected with that
  assumed function. Of the human aspects of marriage it takes little account.
  In a purely legal sense&mdash;which is what we are considering&mdash;your
  position is this: You were competent to contract a marriage and you did
  contract one, of your own free will, without any compulsion or
  misrepresentation that the law would recognise. The circumstances that
  appeared to exist before the marriage still appear to exist. No new facts
  have come to light which would affect the competence of either party. It is a
  case in which one of the parties has disregarded the old legal maxim, Caveat
  emptor&mdash;buyer beware! You bought, at a high price, something which turns
  out to be of no value. You agreed to marry Mr. Otway for a
  consideration&mdash;the release of your father from his
  embarrassments&mdash;which seemed to be valuable enough to justify the great
  sacrifice that you contemplated. But it turned out that your father needed no
  release; and the consideration thereupon ceased to have any value. As far as
  the law is concerned, you have simply made a very bad bargain."</p>

  <p>"Does the law attach no importance to fraud?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"But has there been fraud?" he objected. "No representations, true or
  false, were made to you by Mr. Otway. You acted on knowledge which you
  assumed that you possessed. You laid down the conditions; he accepted them.
  You demanded a certain consideration; he furnished the consideration
  demanded. Even with regard to the letter from your father, we may&mdash;and
  do&mdash;suspect that he knew that it was in the box, and probably guessed at
  its contents. But we have no proof. Moreover, if he did know that it was
  there&mdash;even if he had opened it and read it, he was under no obligation
  to communicate its contents to you. Your agreement made no such provision. It
  laid down specific conditions, and with these Mr. Otway had fully complied.
  On the plea of fraud, I am afraid you would have no case."</p>

  <p>"Apparently not," I agreed. "You are most horribly convincing, Dr.
  Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"I am putting the case as a lawyer, and very much against my own feeling
  as a man. But my present office is rather like that of a Devil's Advocate in
  a theological council. I think that this marriage ought to be annulled, but I
  am sure that, in point of law, it is not voidable.</p>

  <p>"But there is yet another aspect of the case, and you must forgive me if I
  put it rather bluntly. There are not many women to whom I should have spoken
  in as downright a fashion as I have to you, and I shall continue to pay you
  this rather unpleasant compliment. Mrs. Otway, even if, legally speaking, you
  had a case, you could not take it into court."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" I asked, more than a little startled.</p>

  <p>"Because of the incidents of the inquest. You have spoken of certain
  reservations in your evidence. But in the case of Mr. Otway there was more
  than reservation. There was deliberate mis-statement, and that, too, in
  respect of a question that was highly material to the inquiry. He was asked
  the reason of your father's resentment of this marriage, and he stated it to
  be the disparity of age. But that was not the reason, and he knew it was not.
  Your father would have raised no obstacle if you had really wished to marry
  Mr. Otway. He resented the marriage because it had been brought about by
  means which he regarded as&mdash;morally speaking&mdash;fraudulent. Mr.
  Otway's evidence was false evidence, and it was deliberately given with the
  intention of misleading the jury."</p>

  <p>"But it was a small point and of no importance. Besides, Mr. Otway's
  evidence is no concern of mine."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," Dr. Thorndyke objected, gravely, "the point was of very great
  importance. It would have started a train of entirely new issues. And Mr.
  Otway's evidence is very much your concern. You heard it given, you were
  asked if you confirmed it, and you did confirm it. There upon, Mr. Otway's
  evidence became your evidence.</p>

  <p>"Now, if you were to embark on a suit for the annulment of your marriage,
  the plea of fraud, on which you would base your claim, would have to be
  supported by evidence which would conflict with that given by you at the
  inquest. Your position would be a very uncomfortable one, and it would be
  made more so by the fact that your evidence was in agreement with Mr.
  Otway's. When two witnesses agree in a departure from the actual facts known
  to them, a suspicion of collusion is apt to be raised; and collusion again
  suggests purpose and motive. I am afraid, Mrs. Otway, that the Devil's
  Advocate is making out a diabolically complete case. But that, you know, is
  his business. The conclusion is that a malignant fate has woven around you a
  mesh of circumstances from which there is no escape, and that the less you
  struggle the less irksome will be your bonds."</p>

  <p>To this conclusion, unsatisfactory as it was, I assented with a readiness
  born not only of conviction but of a certain amount of alarm. I had heard my
  father speak with admiration of Dr. Thorndyke's amazing power of analysing
  evidence and extracting its essentials, and I now began to wonder how much of
  the actual truth he had extracted from the evidence at the inquest,
  elucidated by my narrative. His warning as to a possible suspicion of
  collusion with "a purpose and a motive" in the back ground, set me
  speculating as to whether he, himself, entertained such a suspicion; and his
  next question was by no means reassuring on this point.</p>

  <p>"You spoke," said he, "of having decided not to live with Mr. Otway, and
  of having communicated your intention to him. Do I understand that he assents
  to a separation?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He sees that the position would be quite impossible."</p>

  <p>"Is your arrangement with him merely a verbal one or has it been placed on
  a regular footing by a document of some kind?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Otway has executed a deed of separation, which I think is quite
  regular. But I had better let you see it."</p>

  <p>With some trepidation, I produced the deed and nervously watched him as he
  read it through, which he did with an inscrutable expression, and&mdash;as it
  seemed to me&mdash;a horrible appearance of seeing through it to the rather
  questionable circumstances that had brought it into existence.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, as he handed it back to me; "it is quite regular. You may
  congratulate yourself on finding Mr. Otway so compliant. It is more than one
  would have expected of him."</p>

  <p>"He could hardly have done otherwise," I answered hastily. "We couldn't
  possibly have lived together after what had happened. Still, I am glad he
  took the reasonable view. It leaves me free to make my own arrangements for
  my future."</p>

  <p>"And what arrangements do you propose&mdash;if your legal adviser is not
  too inquisitive."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I was going to ask you to advise me. I don't think there will
  be enough to support me, and, of course, I can't accept any help from Mr.
  Otway. I shall have to earn my living in some way."</p>

  <p>"You could compel Mr. Otway to support you, but I appreciate your
  unwillingness to accept an allowance and thereby recognise the relationship.
  Have you any means of livelihood in your mind?"</p>

  <p>I hesitated a little shyly. For I had; but my plan might sound rather an
  odd one, at least to a stranger.</p>

  <p>"I thought," said I, at length, "of trying to get a living by doing what I
  have been accustomed to do as a hobby&mdash;by making simple jewellery and
  small, ornamental metal objects. I am afraid you will look on it as rather a
  wild scheme."</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "It is an unconventional scheme, but not in any way a
  wild one. I think we often appreciate insufficiently the wisdom of the
  artist's choice of his profession. In choosing a means of livelihood we are
  choosing the way in which we shall spend the greater part of our lives. We
  have something to sell&mdash;the bulk of our waking lives; and we are apt to
  think too much of its selling price&mdash;its value to the
  purchaser&mdash;and not enough of its value to ourselves. A man, such as a
  navvy, a miner, a bank-clerk or a factory hand, barters for the means of
  subsistence so many hours a day spent in doing something that he does not
  want to do. He sells the best part of his life. But the artist or craftsman
  makes a much better bargain, for he contrives to obtain a subsistence by
  doing what he enjoys doing and what he would elect to do for his own
  satisfaction. He sells only the by-products of his life; the whole of that
  life he retains for his own use, to be spent as he would, in any case, wish
  to spend it. But there is an inevitable proviso; his acceptable occupation
  must really yield a subsistence. His wares must be of value to the purchaser,
  and he must be able to find a market. Do you think you could satisfy those
  conditions?"</p>

  <p>"I think I could make the things pretty well, but, as to selling them,
  that is a different matter. I have to find that out. May I show you some of
  my work?"</p>

  <p>"I should like very much to see some of it," he replied.</p>

  <p>"I will fetch a few pieces. And meanwhile, that clock on the mantelpiece
  is partly my work. My father made the clock, itself; but I made the dial, the
  hands and the case."</p>

  <p>Dr. Thorndyke rose, and, stepping over to the mantel piece, looked at the
  work with keen interest. It was a little bracket-clock with a bronze dial, a
  silver circle for the figures, silver-gilt hands and a simple wooden case
  decorated with gesso. Leaving my visitor to inspect it, I went away and
  collected a few samples of my work in metal; a bronze candlestick, an
  enamelled silver belt-buckle, a gold pendant set with opals, and one or two
  silver spoons; all of which Dr. Thorndyke examined with that friendly
  interest&mdash;unmistakeable to the artist or craftsman&mdash;that evinces
  some knowledge of and liking for the thing examined.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, as he laid down the last of the spoons, "these things
  answer the first question. They are quite workmanlike, and they are
  attractive and tastefully designed. The next question is the economic one.
  Could you sell them? and if so, would they realize a price that would furnish
  a reasonable livelihood? You would have to compete with commercial products
  made in large numbers by cheap processes. Your hammered, embossed and chased
  work would compete with work stamped from steel dies or with comparatively
  rough castings. Of course, your work is infinitely better value; but this is
  a commercial age, and buyers are bad judges. And then you would have to sell
  to dealers who would demand not less than fifty per cent profit, which, I am
  afraid, would leave you a pitiable, small return for your labour and
  skill."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed. "That is all quite true. But still, I think I will try.
  The work would be interesting and pleasant, and, as you implied just now, an
  artist cannot expect to be paid as much for doing what he likes doing as
  another man receives for doing what he dislikes. Pleasant work is, to some
  extent at least, its own reward; and if my work doesn't yield enough to live
  on, I shall have to try something else. But I don't suppose I shall be
  absolutely without means when my father's estate has been wound up."</p>

  <p>"Do you think of continuing to live here?" Dr. Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"No. As soon as everything is settled, I propose to go to London. It will
  be much easier&mdash;or, at least, less difficult&mdash;to dispose of my work
  there."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly. And have you any definite arrangements in your
  mind&mdash;where and how you are going to live, for instance?</p>

  <p>"None whatever, at present."</p>

  <p>"I ask because I happen to know of a place where you could put up, at
  least temporarily; where you would be comfortably lodged, well fed and cared
  for, and where you could pursue your labours under good working conditions
  and at small expense. There is only one drawback, but you may consider that a
  fatal one. It is in the immediate neighbourhood of Ratcliff Highway&mdash;or,
  as it has been renamed, St. George's Street."</p>

  <p>"Is that a very dreadful place?"</p>

  <p>"It is far from being an aristocratic locality. But let me describe the
  establishment. It is conducted by a Miss Polton, who is the sister of my
  laboratory assistant&mdash;a most expert and talented mechanician. Miss
  Polton was at one time a nurse; but when her brother entered my employment,
  he was able to help her to set up in Wellclose Square, Ratcliff, a
  boarding-house for mercantile marine officers. At the same time, she, being
  like her brother, a highly-capable, ingenious person, got herself a hand-loom
  and took up weaving as a hobby. But since then times have changed. Sailing
  ships have to a great extent disappeared, and Miss Polton's clients with
  them, while the hobby of making excellent cloth has turned out quite a
  profitable one. So Miss Polton plies her shuttle industriously, and, in the
  place of the merchant seamen, has collected a little family of women who also
  work at handicrafts for their living. I believe they form quite a happy
  little community, and, of course, they are able to assist one another in
  disposing of their wares. So that is the position. I know that Miss Polton
  has room for another boarder, for it is quite a large house&mdash;Wellclose
  Square was once the abode of well-to-do shipowners and retired
  sea-captains&mdash;and I am sure she would welcome another novice to her
  community. The drawback, as I have said, is the neighbourhood, which
  is&mdash;to put it bluntly&mdash;just a trifle squalid."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that the neighbourhood matters," said I; "and in every other
  respect it sounds like the very thing I want."</p>

  <p>"I think you would be quite well-advised to give it a trial. You would be
  among friends and fellow-workers, and, if you found that the neighbourhood
  was too much for you, you would be in London and could seek a new residence
  at your leisure. I will write the address on one of my cards, and if on
  reflection you decide to give Ratcliff a trial, you can write to Miss Polton
  and me at the same time."</p>

  <p>He wrote the address, and, handing me the card, stood up and glanced at
  his watch.</p>

  <p>"How long will it take me to walk to the station?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Less than twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>"I have half an hour, so I can walk easily. Good-bye, Mrs. Otway. I wish I
  could have given you a better account of your position. But I can only advise
  you to make the best of a bad bargain and keep your own counsel."</p>

  <p>"You have been most kind, Dr. Thorndyke," I said, earnestly, "in giving me
  so much time and patient attention. I don't know how I can thank you."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," said he. "By keeping a good heart and letting me know
  how your affairs progress."</p>

  <p>He shook my hand heartily, and, when I had let him out, strode down the
  garden path, the very personification of manly dignity, alertness and vigour.
  At the gate he turned to raise his hat, with a smile of friendly farewell;
  and I closed the door and turned back into the house, feeling, for the first
  time since my father's death, that I was not alone in the world, but that, if
  the need should arise, the strength of this strong, commanding man was at my
  call.</p>

  <p>The short remainder of my life at Maidstone I shall pass over briefly. It
  comes back to me in scenes like those of a play, separate but related. I see
  the interior of the parish church, noble, spacious, cathedral-like; I hear
  the voice of the clergyman reciting reverently those flowers of ancient
  poetry rendered into perfect English speech that usher the departed into the
  realms of silence with so gracious a dignity; I see the flower-strewn coffin
  sink into the grave wherein sleeps my unremembered mother, while the
  russet-sailed barges glide past the churchyard on the placid river below
  towards the mills at Tovil. And so farewell for ever to the best of fathers
  and the kindest, most lovable of friends.</p>

  <p>These closing weeks, in which I wound up my old life and made ready for
  the new, were full of bustle and unrest. I had written to Miss Polton and Dr.
  Thorndyke, and from the former had received a kindly letter assuring me of
  the warmest welcome: and now I was busily collecting my tools and workshop
  appliances and packing them into travelling boxes to be dispatched with my
  heavier luggage. There was the furniture to be stored or set aside for sale,
  the servants to be placed in new situations, and various business to be
  transacted with Mr. Jackson, who, indeed, relieved me of all that lay within
  his powers.</p>

  <p>Then there was Mr. Otway, from whom I received an abject letter and with
  whom I must needs have a rather distressing interview. He was really
  horrified at my proposed mode of life (I suspect he had never done a stroke
  of manual work in his life), and even more so at my proposed place of
  residence; and was, I believe, sincerely distressed at my firm refusal to
  permit him to make me an allowance. Indeed, the devotion which he professed
  for me, little as I wanted it, seemed to be as real as was possible in the
  case of a man so self-centred and so callously egoistic. But the very sight
  of him hardened my heart and lighted up afresh my indignation at the havoc
  that he had wrought in my life. What I had agreed to do, I did; but I made no
  hair's breadth of concession. I gave him my future address, and agreed to his
  addressing letters there; but I refused resolutely to receive any visits from
  him, or even to enter into any correspondence other than that which
  circumstances might render necessary.</p>

  <p>And now the last day has come; the day of final parting. I see myself
  wandering through the empty house, stripped of all but the barest necessaries
  and filled with new and strange echoes; the van drawn up at the gate to take
  away the last of the furniture, and the tearful Jessie carrying my two little
  portmanteaux down the path to the porter's barrow. I see her return, wiping
  her eyes and gazing at me in dumb appeal, and, with a sudden impulse of
  tenderness, I kiss her and stroke her hair; whereupon she bursts into tears
  and throws herself sobbing on to my breast.</p>

  <p>It was hard to close the old life, which had been so sweet and peaceful,
  so full and satisfying; to bid farewell to the beautiful old town which was
  the only place I had known and which I had loved so well. As I took my way
  through the streets, attach-case in hand, all my old friends seemed to look
  on me reproachfully and call on me to stay. The quaint plaster-fronted house
  in Week Street, the venerable medieval pile at the corner of Gabriel's Hill,
  the grinning masks on the corbels of the old house-fronts of Middle Row; all
  the old familiar landmarks, had suddenly grown dear and precious, and each
  exacted its twinge of regret as I looked my last on it. On the bridge I
  halted to survey the upper river, with the church and the Old Palace, both
  embowered in trees and brooding over the quiet water. Often as I had looked
  upon that view, it had never seemed to me so pleasant and desirable as now.
  And with this last impression&mdash;to be recalled how often in the troubled
  future!&mdash;I turned away and headed resolutely for the station.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2"
     id="ch-2"></a>BOOK II. &mdash; ROMANCE</h2>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-11"
     id="ch-2-11"></a>XI. &mdash; A HARBOUR OF REFUGE</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was the cabman who first made it clear to me that my town
  address was somewhat out of the common. He had stowed my two portmanteaux on
  the roof (it was a four-wheeled cab), and, descending to hold the door open
  for me to enter, shut it after me with a bang and waited while I stated my
  destination.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, Miss," he said, incredulously; "did you say Wellclose
  Square?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Number sixty-nine."</p>

  <p>Again he regarded me with wrinkled brows. "That won't be Wellclose Square
  down by the Docks?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"I don't know if it's near the Docks," I replied, "but it isn't far from
  Ratcliff Highway."</p>

  <p>"That's the place, sure enough," said he. "Number sixty-nine, Well, I'm
  jiggered." With this he turned and slowly climbed to the box, looking in at
  me through the front window as he mounted; and even when he had taken his
  seat and gathered up the reins, he took yet another confirmatory glance over
  his shoulder before starting. These mysterious proceedings occasioned me some
  surprise, not entirely unmixed with anxiety. Dr. Thorndyke had admitted that
  the neighbourhood was squalid, and the question arose, How squalid was it?
  The first part of the journey, through Eastcheap and Great Tower Street, was
  rather reassuring; and as we crossed Tower Hill and the grey pile of ancient
  buildings loomed up above the trees, I was quite pleasantly impressed. But
  then came a change for the worse. Long streets of characterless houses, all
  of a dingy, grey colour&mdash;the colour of all-pervading dirt&mdash;and
  growing greyer and dingier as we proceeded; populated by men and women, and
  especially children, of the same cobwebby tint, with something foreign and
  unfamiliar in their aspect and manners&mdash;a deficiency of artificial head
  covering with a remarkable profusion of the natural, and a tendency to sit
  about on doorsteps; these, with a general outbreak on the shop signs of
  Wowskys, Minskys, Stems and Popoffs, were the features of the neighbourhood
  that chiefly attracted my attention as the cab rattled eastward. But there
  was not much time for extended observation, for I had barely noted these
  appearances when we turned into a short side-street and emerged into a
  square, the dingyness of which was somewhat relieved by a group of faded
  trees in the central enclosure.</p>

  <p>Round the square the cab trundled slowly until it drew up opposite a tall
  house of the Georgian type, with white window frames and a green door. As the
  cab stopped, the green door opened and a small elderly lady came forth, while
  three younger women lurked in the background. Escaping from the cab, I
  advanced to meet the elderly lady, who received me with a singularly pleasant
  smile and a few quietly-spoken words of welcome; a proceeding that was
  observed with furtive interest by the cabman as he transferred my
  portmanteaux from the cab-roof to the pavement and thence to the hall; nor
  did his curious observation of me cease until it was brought to an end by
  actual invisibility, for, as the cab moved out of the square, I saw his face
  still turned towards me over the roof, with the same I expression of puzzled
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"You would like to see your room, I expect," said the elderly lady whom I
  had correctly assumed to be Miss Polton; "then we will have tea and talk over
  your arrangements." She moved towards the stairs (up which I had just seen
  one of the young women hopping with surprising agility, with one of my
  portmanteaux in either hand), and conducted me to a room on the second floor,
  where the portmanteaux had been duly deposited, though the bearer had
  vanished.</p>

  <p>"It's rather bare," said Miss Polton, "but you can have some pictures and
  ornaments if you like. My young ladies usually prefer to have their own
  things and arrange them in their own way. Your workroom is downstairs. I
  consulted my brother about it, and he said he thought you would like a room
  with a stone floor if you were going to do hammered work and use a furnace.
  So, as I had one with quite a good light, I have kept it for you &mdash;that
  is, of course, if you like it."</p>

  <p>"I expect I shall," I replied. "A wooden floor is dreadfully noisy when
  one is hammering on a stake, and not very safe when there are red-hot
  crucibles about."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she agreed, "and you can have a mat for your feet when you are
  sitting at the bench. And now I will leave you and go and see about the
  tea."</p>

  <p>Left to myself, I looked around at my new home. The room, though spacious,
  was undeniably bare, but yet it gave me an impression of comfort. For its
  bareness was due merely to the absence of superfluities. The empty walls,
  distempered a pale cream colour, were severe to baldness; but how much better
  than the usual boarding house walls, covered with staring flowered paper and
  disfigured with horrible prints or illuminated texts. They, like the empty
  book-shelves, were ready to receive the personal touches and to become
  friendly and sympathetic. Of actual necessaries there were more than in many
  an over-furnished room; a small wardrobe, a good-sized, firm table, a chest
  of drawers with a looking-glass on it, a small writing chair, a comfortable
  folding arm-chair, a washing-stand and a sponge bath, besides the
  book-shelves aforesaid, and a daintily-furnished bed, gave me a foundation of
  material comfort and convenience on which it would be easy to build and make
  additions. As I concluded my survey and refreshed myself with a wash, I
  decided that, whatever the surroundings of the house might be like, its
  interior seemed to have the makings of a home.</p>

  <p>Nor was I less favourably impressed when I went down stairs. The
  dining-room, in which I found the ladies assembled, was pervaded by an air of
  spotless cleanliness with a severity approaching bareness. The absence of
  superfluous furniture and useless ornaments and bric-a-brac struck me,
  indeed, as rather odd in a household composed&mdash;so far as I
  knew&mdash;entirely of women.</p>

  <p>"I must introduce you to the family," said Miss Polton, with a pleasant
  wrinkly smile, "at least those who are at home. There are three more who will
  come in to dinner. This is Miss Blake, and these ladies are Miss Barnard and
  Miss Finch."</p>

  <p>I shook hands with my new comrades&mdash;the last being the little lady
  who had skipped up the stairs so actively with my luggage&mdash;and then we
  sat down to the table, at the head of which Miss Polton presided, and made
  the tea in a delightful Delft teapot from a brass kettle on which I cast an
  expert and somewhat disapproving eye, for it was of a blatantly commercial
  type and quite unworthy of the teapot. At first, conversation was spasmodic
  and punctuated by considerable pauses. Miss Polton was evidently a silent,
  self-contained woman, though genial in a quiet, restful way. Miss Finch, too,
  who sat by me, was quiet and a little shy, speaking rarely but silently
  plying me with food. Miss Blake, on the other hand, had a restless manner,
  and, though she spoke little at first, was undisguisedly interested in me,
  for whenever I looked at her I caught her wide-open, blue eyes fixed on me
  with an intensity that was almost embarrassing. She was a rather
  remarkable-looking girl, with a wealth of red-gold hair, a white and pink
  complexion, and a profile which, with its sharp, projecting chin and
  retrouss nose, might have been taken direct from one of Miss Burne-Jones's
  allegories; indeed, my first glance at her made me think of the "Briar Rose"
  and the "Golden Stairs."</p>

  <p>And now, as I caught her intense gaze again and again, I had the feeling
  that she was wanting to say something to me; and the more so since I thought
  I detected a certain expectancy in the expression of her neighbour, Miss
  Barnard. Nor was I mistaken; for, after one of the periodic pauses in the
  conversation, she leaned over the table towards me and said in low,
  portentous tones: "Mrs. Otway, I want to ask you a question, if you won't
  think me too inquisitive." Here she paused&mdash;and Miss Barnard also paused
  in the conveyance to her mouth of a large piece of bread and marmalade.</p>

  <p>Miss Polton explained that "Miss Blake was somewhat of a mystic."</p>

  <p>"Like her famous namesake," said I.</p>

  <p>"And ancestor," Miss Blake added, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Really!" I exclaimed, clutching at this straw; "you are actually a
  descendant of William Blake? And I dare say you are a great admirer of his
  works?"</p>

  <p>"I should think she is!" exclaimed Miss Barnard. "You should just see her
  fashion plates."</p>

  <p>Recalling Blake's usual rendering of the human figure and its
  unadaptability to the conditions of our climate, I secretly resolved to take
  an early opportunity of examining those fashion plates. Meanwhile, I
  remarked, "I was thinking of his poems rather than the drawings."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miss Blake; "though the drawings are very spiritual, too. But
  to return to my question. You see, I had been looking at your face. It is a
  face, you know, in which the workings of the subconscious appear, as it were.
  It's an extraordinary psychic face, do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Is it?" said I, noting that Miss Barnard had broken out into a slow
  smile, which she was trying to obliterate with the lump of bread and
  marmalade.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very. Intensely so."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose your question would be too inquisitive," I said,
  guardedly.</p>

  <p>"It isn't really," said she. "You know, I have been I have been looking at
  your face, watching it with deep interest, and I have been hoping that, at
  last, I had met with a kindred spirit. I do hope&mdash;I feel
  convinced&mdash;that I have. I've been wondering if you are, as I am, a
  dweller in the larger world beyond that inhabited by the conscious self,
  beyond the mere material universe. Is it not so, Mrs. Otway?"</p>

  <p>Now this was a "facer." As my dear father would have expressed it in his
  playful fashion, it "knocked me side-ways." I cast a bewildered glance round
  the table, and was aware of a very extensive outbreak of tact: Miss Polton
  was blandly indulgent, her face transformed into a network of amiable
  wrinkles; Miss Finch was engaged in an intense scrutiny of the bowl of a jam
  spoon; while Miss Barnard's feats, with the bread and marmalade, were
  becoming positively dangerous.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure I understand your question, Miss Blake," I managed to
  respond at length.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I did not put my question very clearly&mdash;it is difficult to
  be very definite when one is speaking of the psychic life; but I was
  wondering if you had ever had experiences that had made you aware of that
  larger world beyond the world of mere matter and sense-perception; if you had
  sometimes felt the thoughts of other minds stealing into your own without the
  aid of speech or bodily presence and even, perhaps, held converse with those
  dear to you who, while they have passed out of this little, material world,
  still share with you the greater world in which soul speaks to soul
  unhampered by the limitations&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The humorous wrinkles had suddenly faded from Miss Polton's face, leaving
  it grave and quiet; and now, in a quiet, grave voice, she interposed:</p>

  <p>"I think, Lilith, dear, that Mrs. Otway's griefs are too new and too
  real&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know!" Miss Blake exclaimed, impulsively. "I am an egotistical wretch.
  It was horrid of me to be so wrapped up in my own interests. I am so sorry;
  so very, very sorry. Please forgive me, dear Mrs. Otway! Let us talk of
  something else."</p>

  <p>"I don't think we must talk of anything much longer," said Miss Polton.
  "We have finished tea and we ought to get on with our work. Besides, Mrs.
  Otway will want to unpack her things and set her room in order."</p>

  <p>On this there was a general up-rising. Miss Finch immediately fell to work
  gathering up the debris and returning the cups and saucers to the tray, while
  Miss Blake renewed her apologies and expressions of sympathy. Then Miss
  Polton took possession of me, and, having shown me my workshop &mdash;a
  smallish, well-lighted room, with a paved floor and a large window looking on
  an unexpectedly pleasant garden&mdash;took me upstairs to a box-room in which
  my personal luggage had been deposited.</p>

  <p>"Supper is at eight o'clock," said she. "We have made it rather late so
  that everyone may have a good, long day's work and all the wanderers may have
  come home. It is the social event of the day. And now I will leave you to
  your unpacking."</p>

  <p>She tripped away up a narrow flight of stairs that opened from the
  landing, towards what I took to be the attics; from whence presently came a
  rhythmical "click-clack" that I associated with the loom of which Dr.
  Thorndyke had spoken. Meanwhile, I fell to work on my trunks, with a view to
  transferring their contents to my room; but I had hardly got them open when
  Miss Finch appeared at the open door.</p>

  <p>"Can I help you?" she asked. "If I carry some of the things down you won't
  have so many journeys."</p>

  <p>"But aren't you busy?" I asked in return.</p>

  <p>"Do I look like it? No, I'm lazy this afternoon, but I should like to help
  you, if you will let me."</p>

  <p>Of course I was only too glad, and forthwith loaded her with an armful of
  books, following her with a second consignment. For some time we continued
  our journeys up and down the stairs with very little said on either side, and
  gradually my room began to lose its emptiness and severity, and to take on
  the friendly aspect of an inhabited apartment.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't look so bad," said Miss Finch, surveying it critically. "Looks
  as if someone lived in it. Do you like the wash-stand?"</p>

  <p>"I've been admiring it. It's so simple and so tasteful and unusual."</p>

  <p>"Yes; and yet it is only stained deal, with a few touches of gesso.
  Phillibar made it&mdash;Phyllis Barton, you know. You'll meet her at
  supper."</p>

  <p>"Is she a carpenter?"</p>

  <p>"No; she makes frames for mirrors and pictures; wooden frames decorated
  with gesso, or compo, or else carved. But she's very thorough. Does it all
  herself. Makes up the frames from the plank, makes the compo and the moulds
  and does the gilding. And she is quite a good wood-worker and carves
  beautifully."</p>

  <p>"And does she make a pretty good living?" I asked, bearing Dr. Thorndyke's
  observations in mind.</p>

  <p>"She does quite well now, though she had a hard struggle at first. But now
  she works direct for the artists and gets as much as she can do. You will
  often see her frames in the exhibitions. The floor-cloth is rather nice, too,
  isn't it, though it is only stencilled sacking. You'd be surprised to see how
  durable it is. The more it is worn, the better it looks&mdash;if it is
  properly done. This is stencilled with a stain. Lilith did it."</p>

  <p>"Lilith? Is that Miss Blake?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Her name is really Winifred, but we call her Lilith because she
  looks as if she had come out of a stained-glass window. You might think that
  she was a little&mdash;well, a little barmy. But she's awfully clever."</p>

  <p>"She does fashion-plates, doesn't she?</p>

  <p>"Yes, poor Lilith! She hates them, but she does them rippingly all the
  same. She would rather paint pictures or mural decorations or design
  tapestries, but you've got to do what you can sell, you know, if you want to
  make a living; and Lilith has a little brother whom she keeps at
  school&mdash;an awfully nice little kiddie. She's a really good sort, you
  know, though frightfully spooky&mdash;planchette, crystal ball and all that
  sort of tosh; and she thinks she has found a fellow-spook, so you will have
  to look out."</p>

  <p>As Miss Finch paused to take another survey, her eye and mine fell upon
  the wash-stand, or rather on what it supported.</p>

  <p>"I think," I remarked, "that I shall have to treat myself to some new
  crockery. That jug and basin are hardly worthy of Miss Barton's
  masterpiece."</p>

  <p>"No; they're horrid, aren't they? Regular Whitechapel china-shop stuff.
  But I believe I've got some&mdash;I'll just run up and see."</p>

  <p>She tripped away up the stairs and presently returned, bearing a basin and
  pitcher of simple, reddish-buff earthen ware glazed internally with a fine
  green glaze.</p>

  <p>"They are frightfully crude and coarse," she said apologetically (and with
  cheeks several shades redder than the ware), "but they aren't vulgar. Would
  you like to have them until you can get something better?"</p>

  <p>"I shall have them a long time, then," said I. "They are
  charming&mdash;delightful, and they suit the wash-stand perfectly. What a
  house this is for pottery! I noticed the teapot and the beautiful cups and
  plates, all so interesting and uncommon. And now you produce these wonderful
  things like some benevolent enchantress. How do you do it? Do you keep a
  crystal ball, too?"</p>

  <p>Miss Finch laughed and blushed very prettily. "We all do our little bit
  towards making the home presentable and saving expense. Miss Polton
  distempered these walls, and Joan Allen painted the woodwork&mdash;you'll
  like Joan, I think; she paints portraits when she can get them, and fills in
  her time by doing magazine covers and book-wrappers. We shall expect a
  diploma work from you, too. You're a goldsmith, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>It was my turn to laugh and blush as this magnificent title was applied to
  me. "Not exactly a goldsmith," I protested. "Say, rather, a very elementary
  jeweller and metal-worker, or perhaps a coppersmith. And, as we have finished
  with this room for the present, I had better begin to get my workshop in
  going order."</p>

  <p>"And you'll let me help you with that, too, won't you?" said Miss Finch,
  with a wheedling air; and as I gladly accepted her help, she linked her arm
  in mine and we descended together to the scene of my future labours.</p>

  <p>My experience of various workers has led me to observe that manual skill
  is a much more generalized quality than is commonly realized. The old saw of
  the "Jack of all trades and master of none" is entirely misleading; for
  manual skill acquired in the practice of one art is largely transferable to
  others. The acquirement of a particular kind of skill results in the
  establishment of a generally increased manual faculty, so that a person who
  has completely learned one handicraft is already more than half-way towards
  the attainment of skill in any other. This fact was impressed upon me as I
  watched little Miss Finch and noted her extraordinary handiness with probably
  unfamiliar appliances and her instant comprehension of the uses of things
  that she had probably never seen before. My two benches&mdash;the jeweller's
  and the general bench&mdash;had fortunately been made in a portable form, and
  now had to be joined up with their screw-bolts. But my little assistant took
  this in at a glance, and, before I had half finished unpacking the tool
  cases, she had the bench-tops up-ended, had sorted out the legs, struts and
  the appropriate bolts, and was hard at work with the spanner. Yet, as she
  worked, she kept an alert and interested eye on the tools and appliances that
  came forth from the cases.</p>

  <p>"What a jolly little muffle!" she exclaimed, as I deposited the small
  enamel furnace on the floor, pending the erection of its stand; "but won't it
  eat up the gas. You'll have to have your own meter&mdash;watch it, too, to
  see that your earnings don't all go to the gas company. And what a little
  duck of an anvil! But what on earth are those things?" pointing to a bundle
  of body-tools and snarling irons.</p>

  <p>I explained the use of these mysterious appliances and of sundry others
  and so, with a good deal of gossip, partly personal and partly technical, we
  worked on until the sound of the first supper-bell sent us to our rooms to
  make ourselves presentable; by which time the fitting out of the workshop was
  so far advanced as to make it possible for me to begin work on the
  morrow.</p>

  <p>The great social function of supper introduced me to the rest of my
  comrades; Phyllis Barton, who turned out, to my surprise, to be a tiny,
  frail-looking middle-aged woman of meek aspect&mdash;I had pictured her as a
  large, muscular, boisterous young woman; Joan Allen, who really corresponded
  somewhat to this description, and whom I detected more than once in the act
  of inspecting me with one eye closed; and a tall, rather shy girl, by name
  Edith Palgrave, a scrivener and calligrapher, who, I learned from Miss Finch,
  wrote, by choice, Church service books and illuminated addresses, but, by
  necessity, gained her principal livelihood by writing shop-tickets.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant genial gathering: homely, informal, and yet quite
  regardful of the indispensable social amenities. What the social class of my
  companions might have been I could hardly guess. They were all educated
  women, of good intelligence and pleasant manners, all keenly interested in
  one another's doings, but each fully occupied with her own activities. The
  agreeable impression was conveyed that, in this little human hive, the
  companionship arising from the community of domestic life tended in no way to
  hinder a self-contained person like myself from living her own life and
  pursuing her own interests and satisfactions.</p>

  <p>And so, when, somewhat early, I retired to my room to spend an hour with
  my books before going to bed, my thoughts turned gratefully to Dr. Thorndyke,
  and I congratulated myself not a little on having found this quiet anchorage
  in which to rest after the stormy passages of my troubled life.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-12"
     id="ch-2-12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE HIDDEN HAND</h2>

  <p class="first">I HAD been settled in my new home about a month when I
  received a letter from Mr. Jackson. It was principally devoted to a report on
  business matters concerned with the disposal of my father's practice and the
  sale of the surplus furniture and effects, but it contained one passage that
  gave me considerable food for thought. The passage in question had been added
  as a postscript, and ran thus: "You have probably heard that Mr. Otway has
  left Maidstone. I fancy things had become rather uncomfortable for him. From
  what transpired at the inquest, an impression got abroad that he was, to a
  great extent responsible for your father's death, and there was consequently
  a rather strong feeling against him. I don't know where he has gone, but
  rumour has it that he has migrated to London."</p>

  <p>This was, in more than one respect, somewhat disquieting news. I turned it
  over again and again as I sat at my bench and tried to estimate its
  significance. The inquest had "gone off quite smoothly," as Mr. Jackson had
  expressed it, but it was clear that some, at least, of the persons present
  had read a meaning into the evidence which the coroner and his jury seemed to
  have missed. Dr. Thorndyke was one of these; but, as no rumour could be
  traceable to him, there were evidently others. What did this portend? To Mr.
  Jackson it meant no more than a local prejudice. To me, conscious of a secret
  covenant which I had not dared to confide even to Dr. Thorndyke, it conveyed
  an uneasy feeling that suspicion was abroad, that it might become cumulative,
  and that, even yet, that covenant might be dragged into the light of day
  which it would bear so ill.</p>

  <p>Ever since my talk with Dr. Thorndyke, my conscience had been somewhat ill
  at ease. I felt that, as a witness giving testimony on oath, I had been at
  least uncandid, if not positively untruthful; and the word "collusion" had
  acquired an unpleasantly personal quality.</p>

  <p>And then, what of Mr. Otway? Had he slipped away out of my life to hide
  himself where suspicion would not reach him? Or had he really migrated to
  London, and would his sinister shadow presently fall upon my new life as it
  had done upon the old? My hopes pictured him driven by his fears&mdash;for he
  was a timorous man&mdash;far afield, perhaps beyond the seas; but a
  presentiment whispered that I had not heard or seen the last of him.</p>

  <p>It was a few days later, in fact, that I returned from a walk to find a
  letter from Mr. Otway, requesting me to see him. I met him the following day
  at the Tower Wharf. He was more agitated even than usual, and rose to greet
  me with a audible explanation of relief. "Miss Vardon&mdash;that
  is&mdash;Mrs&mdash;ah&mdash;Helen. I have received a letter."</p>

  <p>"Your correspondence is of no interest to me." I told him coldly.</p>

  <p>"But the contents of this one are so extraordinary that I ventured to
  write to you about it. I hoped you would&mdash;er&mdash;respond to my appeal.
  It is strange," he added, "considering what our relations are and what your
  feelings are towards me, that I seem to look to you, and to you alone, for
  support and counsel in this&mdash;er&mdash;this unexpected trouble."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose," said I, "that any counsel of mine will be of much value
  to a man of your experience. But perhaps you had better tell me what the
  trouble is&mdash;Shall we sit down here? You spoke of having received a
  letter."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, as we sat down on a seat near the bridge. "It is an
  anonymous letter, and its purport is&mdash;ah&mdash;very singular, and
  is&mdash;ah&mdash;to the effect that&mdash;er&mdash;in fact&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is there any objection to your repeating the actual wording of the
  letter?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, no. Certainly not. Perhaps it would be better. You are really
  remarkably business-like and clear-headed. I suppose it is your upbringing
  and being so much with your father. No, there is no objection. In
  fact,"&mdash;here he produced from his pocket, with evident reluctance, a
  leather wallet, from which he extracted a folded paper&mdash;"in fact, you
  may as well see the letter for yourself."</p>

  <p>I took the paper from him, and opening it found it to be a quite short
  letter, typewritten upon ordinary typist's paper, without any address or
  other heading, and undated save for Mr. Otway's written and signed
  endorsement. There was no signature, but in place of one was written in typed
  characters, "A Well Wisher" and this is what it said:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lewis Otway,</p>

  <p>"The undersigned is writing to put you on your guard because Somebody
  knows something about how Mr. Vardon came by his death, and that somebody is
  not friend, so you had better keep a sharp look out for your enemy and see
  what they mean to do. I can't tell you any more at present.</p>

  <p>"A WELL WISHER."</p>

  <p>I read it through twice, noting, the second time, the peculiar
  construction, the faulty grammar and punctuation, and especially the
  confusion in the pronouns which is so characteristic of the writing of an
  uneducated person. Of course, these peculiarities might have been assumed as
  a disguise; but they established a probability that the writer was a person
  of indifferent education; to which class, indeed, the bulk of anonymous
  letter-writers belong. I handed the document back to Mr. Otway, and asked:
  "Does this letter convey anything to you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he replied. "Absolutely nothing. It speaks of somebody knowing
  something. But that is impossible. There was no one in the house but you and
  I and&mdash;er&mdash;your father. Besides, there is nothing to
  know&mdash;excepting what you know."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea or suspicion as to who the writer of this letter may
  be?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever. I have not the faintest clue. You see, there is nobody in
  the world who has any&mdash;er&mdash;any special knowledge of
  the&mdash;ah&mdash;the exact circumstances but yourself." He paused for a few
  moments, and then, in a lower tone, asked hesitatingly: "I suppose, Helen,
  you cannot&mdash;er&mdash;guess or&mdash;ah&mdash;surmise who might
  have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I looked up quickly and caught a furtive glance which was instantly
  averted; and in a moment it was borne in on me that he suspected me of either
  being the writer or concerned in writing of this letter.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Otway," said I, speaking slowly and quietly, the better to command my
  temper, "if you have any idea that I know anything of this wretched
  production, dismiss it. If you have any idea that there lurks in my mind any
  suspicion that your account of my father's death was untrue, dismiss that,
  too. If I had known, or even had the smallest grounds for suspecting, that my
  father met with foul play, you would not have had to wait till now to hear
  from me; nor would my communication have reached you in this form or through
  these channels."</p>

  <p>As I said this, looking at him, I do not doubt, sternly and forbiddingly
  enough, he turned horribly pale and seemed to shrink visibly. He was
  completely cowed; so much so that, cordially as I detested him, I felt really
  sorry for him.</p>

  <p>"You mistake me, Helen. You misjudge me," he protested, huskily; "you do,
  indeed. I had no intention&mdash;I never, for one moment, suspected&mdash;but
  why do I say this? Of course, you must know I did not. I merely thought it
  possible that you might be able to guess&mdash;you might know of some
  person&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do not, Mr. Otway," said I. "No one connected with me has any knowledge
  that is not public knowledge. Nor do I believe that anyone else has. I should
  say that this person&mdash;apparently a person of the lower class&mdash;is
  just a common blackmailer, who was present at, or has read the report of, the
  inquest, and is trying to make you believe that some suspicion attaches to
  you." I could not but admire the adroitness with which Mr. Otway made me a
  participator in his own difficulties and secured me as an ally against his
  unseen enemy. And the blackmailer is a rather formidable enemy to a man who
  is concealing an incriminating fact. We were partners in an unlawful act.
  That, I had already recognised; and the different significance of that act in
  our respective cases did not so very much affect our position in the present
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Probably you are right, Helen. But you notice that there is no
  threat&mdash;no, direct threat, at least&mdash;and that there is no
  suggestion of any attempt to obtain money from me."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that will come later," said I.</p>

  <p>Again he drew a long breath and cast a furtive glance at me. "Perhaps it
  will," he agreed. "This may be the preliminary move, the laying of
  ground-bait, so to speak. It's a harassing business, Helen. What do you think
  I had better do? You see, I rely on you for counsel, although I am so much
  older. But you have your father's gift of clear judgment and perfect coolness
  in emergencies."</p>

  <p>It was rather a tactless observation, for it recalled vividly my dear
  father's coolness in that last, fatal emergency; his composure and unruffled
  cheerfulness when the menace of ruin and disgrace&mdash;set up by Mr.
  Otway&mdash;had seemed poised over his head, ready to fall at any moment; and
  the recollection did not tend to increase my present sympathy.</p>

  <p>"For my part," I said, coldly, "I should do nothing at present. I should
  ignore this letter and wait for the writer to show his hand more clearly. If
  he should make any threats or demands for hush-money, I should at once put
  the matter in the hands of the police."</p>

  <p>I could see that this advice&mdash;particularly the latter part of
  it&mdash;did not greatly commend itself to Mr. Otway. Nor did it to me. But
  circumstances offered no choice. Any risk is better than that of life-long
  subjection to a blackmailer.</p>

  <p>"It would be very unsafe," said Mr. Otway, "to have&mdash;any dealings
  with the police. They are pretty severe on blackmailers, but they are
  naturally ready to listen to anyone who professes to have information to give
  them. And a blackmailer may be very dangerous if he is brought to bay. We
  couldn't afford to have any enquiries made that might seem to establish what
  they would call collusion to suppress evidence. We know that the facts that
  we withheld were not material. Other people would not."</p>

  <p>I had nothing further to say, but to repeat that I should ignore the
  letter; and for a time we sat silent, looking out on the river. Mr. Otway
  drew a deep breath and reflected gloomily. Perhaps my suggestion was not a
  very comforting one, for an uncomfortable aspect of the case was that he was
  right.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Otway, at length, "so be it. We will wait and see what
  happens. And now let us put this miserable affair away and talk about your
  future. I have seen some of your work, and I am sure that you could get good
  prices for it if it were placed in the proper quarter. But the ordinary shops
  would be of no use to you. The common retailer does not know or care anything
  about individual work. He just buys from the wholesaler or the manufacturer,
  and sells to the public. He would probably not look at your work, or if he
  were willing to buy it, he would pay no more than he pays to the manufacturer
  who rattles off his goods by the thousand, with the aid of cheap labour and
  machinery.</p>

  <p>"But there are people who know the difference between artists' works and
  manufactured goods, and are willing to pay for the better things. And there
  are dealers who supply them. Mr. Campbell is one. I have known him for many
  years, and I can assure you that he is an excellent judge of works of art and
  very anxious to get the best for his customers, who are mostly good judges,
  too. He is well known in artistic circles, and, as he is able to dispose of
  things of real value, he can afford to pay the artist a fair price. I
  strongly advise you to give him a trial. Of course, I would infinitely rather
  that you accepted an allowance from me, but, if you really&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you, Mr. Otway, but I assure you that it is out of the
  question."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. If you are quite resolved, I can only advise you to make
  the most profitable use of your talents. Go to Mr. Campbell, and I am sure
  that you will be treated fairly."</p>

  <p>I thanked him for his advice and promised to act on it; and very shortly
  after this I brought the interview to an end.</p>

  <p>As I took my way slowly back to Wellclose Square, I reflected on the new
  developments that my meeting with Mr. Otway had disclosed. That some mischief
  was brewing there could hardly be a doubt. The disguise of the "Well Wisher"
  was too thin to create any illusion. As to the somebody who knew something,
  he was an obvious myth, for, as Mr. Otway had said, the circumstances did not
  admit of anyone knowing even what was known to me. My own explanation was
  that some person, who had been present at the inquest, had observed Mr.
  Otway's excessive nervousness and had marked him as a likely subject for
  blackmailing operations. It was a chance shot and nothing more.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Otway's evident alarm was not difficult to account for. He was a
  naturally timorous man; he had been subjected to a great and prolonged
  strain, and he had an incriminating secret. His position was, in fact, one of
  appreciable danger, as he fully realized. If the details of my father's death
  had been fully disclosed at the inquest, Mr. Otway's statement and
  explanation would probably have been accepted without demur. But the
  suppression of certain material facts put a different complexion on the
  matter. If the inquiry were now revived, he would have to explain, not only
  the original circumstances, but his motives for suppressing them. He had very
  good reason for alarm.</p>

  <p>And yet his abject terror produced an uncomfortable impression on me. I
  could not disguise from myself that the whole tragedy of my father's death
  was due to an error of judgment on my part. The secret marriage was the out
  come of a mistake. Woman-like, I had acted on a strong conviction; and that
  conviction had been wrong. What if I had once again acted on an erroneous
  belief? I had assumed that Mr. Otway's account of my dear father's death was
  correct. There had seemed to be excellent reasons for the assumption. But
  what if I had been wrong, after all? If I had actually misled a Court of
  Justice to shield the murderer of my dearly loved father? It was undeniably
  possible. I had formed my opinion on mere probabilities, backed by a
  statement that, however plausible, was manifestly worthless as evidence. And
  that opinion might have been utterly wrong. It was a dreadful thought. So
  dreadful that, though I tried to put it away and remind myself that I did not
  entertain and never had entertained it, it haunted me during the whole of my
  walk home, even to the exclusion of the menace to myself that lurked in this
  blackmailer's letter.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-13"
     id="ch-2-13"></a>XIII. &mdash; A CRYSTAL-GAZER AND OTHER MATTERS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE cheerful atmosphere of the old house in Wellclose Square
  soon dissipated my gloomy thoughts. It was nearing supper-time when I
  arrived, and an agreeable clink of china proceeded from the dining-room,
  accompanied by a faint aroma suggestive of curry. On my landing I found
  Lilith and Miss Finch engaged in earnest discussion, and both greeted me as
  if I had returned after a long absence.</p>

  <p>"We have been wondering," said the former, "what had become of our Sibyl,"
  (she had bestowed this title on me, presumably, by reason of my peculiarly
  'psychic' cast of countenance). "As for the poor Titmouse," (this was Miss
  Finch's pet name), "she has been wandering about like a cat that has lost its
  kitten."</p>

  <p>"Or like a kitten that has lost its cat," I suggested, bestowing an
  affectionate pinch on my little comrade's ear. "Well, I haven't been far
  afield, but I have done quite an important stroke of business."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say you've sold something!" the Titmouse exclaimed,
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Not actually sold. But I have discovered a market. I have tidings of a
  benevolent person&mdash;of the Scottish persuasion, I believe&mdash;who
  traffics in works of art and other productions of the human hand."</p>

  <p>"A Scotchman!" exclaimed Miss Finch. "I thought all art dealers were Jews.
  When are you going to call on the Laird?</p>

  <p>"It is hardly worth while to call on him until I have a fair collection of
  work to show him," said I.</p>

  <p>"I don't agree with you, Sibyl," said Lilith. "The first thing to do is to
  catch your dealer. To do that, you must find out what he wants. He is sure to
  have his own personal fancies, and he knows what he can sell most easily.
  Take him all that you have ready. He will be able to see from that what you
  can do, and he will tell you what kind of work he will take from you. And
  don't lose any time. I should go to-morrow if I were you."</p>

  <p>"Does an artist have to work to order, then, like salaried journeymen?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Practically, yes," replied Lilith. "And why not? He makes things that he
  wants people to buy. Surely it is only reasonable that he should consider the
  needs and the wishes of the buyers. And all good craftsmen do. Chippendale's
  chairs were not only good to look at; they were comfortable to sit on and
  serviceable in use. The only difference between an artist craftsman and a
  commercial producer is that the artist always does his best, for his own
  satisfaction apart from the question of payment; whereas the commercial
  producer thinks of the profit only, and turns out the worst stuff that the
  buyer will put up with."</p>

  <p>"But surely an artist may choose what he will make," said I.</p>

  <p>"Of course he may," replied Lilith, "if he is willing to keep the thing
  when he has made it. Not if he is going to ask someone to pay him money for
  it."</p>

  <p>I was inwardly somewhat taken aback by this exhibition of hard-headed
  reasonableness on the part of the mystical Lilith; so much so that, when she
  had gone to her room, I remarked on it to Miss Finch.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she agreed; "Lilith is an extraordinary girl. In fact, there seem
  to be two Liliths; one is as cranky as a March hare, and the other is
  perfectly sane and really very shrewd. I sometimes wonder whether she really
  believes in all that crystal-gazing tosh and telepathic bunkum. But she
  practices what she has just been preaching. She does her fashion-plates
  according to orders&mdash;but ever so much better than she need&mdash;and
  does other work to please herself and is content to keep it. You should look
  in at her studio and see her at work; then you'd understand."</p>

  <p>"And you think I had better take her advice?"</p>

  <p>"I do. First catch your dealer; and if he wants to keep you turning out
  the same things over and over again, try to catch another dealer who wants
  something different. The great thing is to get a market. It's frightfully
  disheartening to keep on doing good work and having it all left on your
  hands."</p>

  <p>Impressed by this wise counsel, I betook myself after supper to my
  workshop and reviewed my stock. A month's work had produced no great
  accumulation, for I was still a slow worker, though the continuous practice
  was improving that. On the other hand, I had brought with me a certain number
  of unfinished pieces as well as some of my finished work; so that I had
  enough to give Mr. Campbell the means of judging my capabilities. When I had
  looked over the collection and withdrawn one or two pieces that were not up
  to my present standard, I packed the approved specimens in a hand-bag which I
  took up with me in readiness for the morrow. I was just opening the door of
  my room when Lilith came running up the stairs.</p>

  <p>"You see," I said, holding up the hand-bag. "I am acting on your advice. I
  have packed up a selection from my stock to take to the dealer to-morrow
  morning."</p>

  <p>"I am glad of that," said she. "The business side of art is tedious and
  disagreeable, but you have got to sell if you are to live by your work. Would
  you mind giving me a private view of your masterpieces?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be proud to show them to you," I replied, conducting her into my
  room and placing the arm-chair by the table, "Let us put out the whole
  collection."</p>

  <p>I emptied the bag of its contents, which I set out on the table to the
  best advantage, and she examined the pieces one by one.</p>

  <p>"They are charming," she exclaimed, enthusiastically. "I can't judge the
  work, though it looks most expert to my inexpert eye, but the design is
  delightful. They are all so individual and full of character, and so simple
  and restrained. You have a fine colour-sense, too. I think your use of enamel
  quite masterly, and I like your employment of bronze in place of the precious
  metals. It is fortunate that your dealer is a Scotchman, for the Jews, from
  Solomon downwards, have always had a leaning towards gold."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I; "bronze is my favourite material, even for personal
  ornaments. And it is capable of great variety in the patina, especially if
  one uses the Japanese methods of surface treatment. I wish it took the enamel
  better."</p>

  <p>"You seem to have overcome the difficulties pretty completely," said
  Lilith. "This pendant, for instance, is beautiful, and so is the belt-clasp.
  Do you know, Sibyl, I think we might collaborate. Some of my designs might
  very well include metal ornaments&mdash;clasps, buckles, and buttons forming
  part of the decorative scheme. We must talk it over. And now, my dear Sibyl,
  I want to say something to you&mdash;something quite serious&mdash;and I want
  you to listen without prejudice."</p>

  <p>I looked at her, and was instantly aware of a change that had come over
  her. The shrewd, business-like, capable Lilith had suddenly become
  transformed into the mystic&mdash;wide-eyed, dreamy, yet intense.</p>

  <p>"I have avoided talking to you about the things that are to me the great
  things of life," she said in low, earnest, tones. "I have wished to, but I
  have been fearful of intruding on your strongly individual, self-contained
  personality. But I have felt that you have great gifts&mdash;great psychic
  gifts. You are a woman of power. The common herd live their little lives
  locked up in the prison of the visible and the conscious. If they would
  convey their thoughts to other minds they must use the unwieldy means of
  speech and visible signs. What they know of their fellow-immortals reaches
  them crudely through the organs of sense; and through those primitive and
  inadequate media they must needs communicate with others, bound by the
  limitations of time and space and mere material contact&mdash;at least, so
  long as they are prisoned within a material body. But there are others for
  whom no such limitations exist; specially gifted souls who can see without
  mere material eyes, who can hear without ears, who can speak their thoughts
  across the gulfs of time and space; who can look into the remote past, and
  even into the future; who can make their will-power operate at limitless
  distances and without the aid of gross bodily action. And you are one of
  these, Sibyl. I am convinced that you are endowed with these powers. But they
  are latent, unsuspected, because you have never tried to exercise them;
  because you have never sought to bring the subconscious within the domain of
  the conscious, or rather to make a contact between the two."</p>

  <p>To this strange and rather wild harangue (which the matter-of-fact
  Titmouse would have called "barmy") I listened with grave attention, though
  with little enough conviction&mdash;for I could not but recall my ignorance
  and my mistaken judgment in the greatest crisis of my life&mdash;noting how
  like a prophetess the picturesque Lilith looked, with her golden aureole of
  auburn hair and her great, blue eyes and parted lips. But I made no
  reply&mdash;there was, indeed, nothing to say&mdash;and after a short pause
  she continued:</p>

  <p>"Don't think I am saying this with any impertinent intention of trying to
  force my own views on you. I have a definite practical purpose. You are going
  to-morrow to make your first essay in a vitally important branch of an
  artist's calling. On your success depends the possibility of your following
  art as a profession&mdash;that is, if you have not enough to live without
  work."</p>

  <p>"I have not," said I.</p>

  <p>"Then artistic success is not sufficient. You must achieve industrial
  success; you must get a livelihood out of your work. As far as the creation
  of beautiful things is concerned you are quite competent and will become more
  so with more practice. Now you have to learn how to dispose of those works
  profitably; how to make people buy them."</p>

  <p>"But surely that will be decided by the suitability of the things
  themselves."</p>

  <p>"Partly, no doubt. But you mustn't leave it at that. You must learn to
  exercise the power of silent willing combined with suggestion."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I quite understand," said I.</p>

  <p>"We must talk about this more fully some other time," said Lilith, "and go
  into the theory and the results of experiments. For the present you must try
  to take my word for the fact that silent willing and suggestion are real
  powers. I don't ask you to believe it without proof&mdash;I will give you the
  proof later&mdash;but I do beg you, dear Sibyl, to give the method a trial.
  If it fails in your hands you will be none the worse; but it won't fail if
  you make up your mind to succeed."</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do, Lilith?" I asked, not a little bit bewildered
  by her mysterious and rather vague expressions.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you what I do myself," she replied. "When I take a batch of
  drawings to a publisher, I stand outside the office for five minutes and
  silently will that he shall accept them. Sometimes I write on a piece of
  paper a command to the publisher to accept my work, and while I am waiting
  for the interview I keep my eyes fixed on the writing and mentally endorse
  the command. The writing, you see, helps me to concentrate my will-power.
  Then, at the interview, I use the method of suggestion. Whatever the editor
  or publisher may say, whatever objections he may make to my work, I continue
  steadily to impress on him that he is going to accept it, that, in fact, he
  has accepted it. If he refuses it, I ignore the refusal and go on talking as
  if he had accepted it&mdash;not rudely, of course; one must do these things
  tactfully&mdash;and all the time that he is talking, I continue silently to
  concentrate my will-power on him."</p>

  <p>"And what is the result?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The result, my dear Sibyl, is that I sell all the drawings that I offer
  for sale."</p>

  <p>This sounded convincing enough, and would have been more so if I had not
  happened to know that Lilith's drawings were of the very best of their kind,
  and that she submitted them to the most rigorous criticism before letting
  anyone see them. Still, the fact that she sold her work was undeniable, and
  it was impossible to say how many excellent drawings had failed to gain
  acceptance. Certainly every capable artist is not a successful one.</p>

  <p>"And what is it exactly that you want me to do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I want you," she replied, "to do just what I do myself. I want you to
  stand outside the shop for five minutes and silently will that this dealer
  shall buy your work. It would probably help you if you were to write down the
  command and keep your eyes fixed on the writing while you are willing; but if
  the dealer himself should happen to be visible, it would be well to fix your
  eyes on him so as to direct the will-force with more precision. And when you
  go into the shop, keep on willing with the greatest concentration that you
  can command, and when you are talking to the dealer, talk as if he had bought
  your work; keep on impressing on him that he has bought it, and don't take
  any notice of contrary statements on his part. If he seems to think that he
  has refused it, you must correct his mistake and guide his thoughts into the
  proper channels."</p>

  <p>I suppose I must have looked somewhat dismayed at this rather startling
  programme, for Lilith continued, eagerly: "Now, don't raise objections,
  Sibyl, dear. It will be quite easy if you will only make up your mind. You
  have abundant will-power, and I am certain that you have the gift of
  projecting your mental states into the minds of others. And I am so anxious
  that you should succeed and that your great gifts should not be wasted. Say
  you will try, Sibyl, if only to please your friend."</p>

  <p>What could I do? Utterly as my mind refused to accept the connection
  between the alleged cause and effect, I could not say that no such connection
  existed. I was completely unconvinced; but my unconviction might conceivably
  be less rational than Lilith's whole-hearted belief. For she declared herself
  able to support her belief with proof, whereas I had to admit that my
  scepticism was largely a matter of temperament. And she was so eager, and it
  was so sweet of her to be so full of anxiety on my behalf, that it would have
  seemed ungracious to make difficulties. The end of it was that I agreed to
  carry out her plan of conquest, on which she further inducted me into the
  arts of silent willing and suggestion and even supervised me while I wrote
  out, at her dictation, a peremptory command to the dealer, which I promised
  to use, as directed, for the reinforcement of my will-power at the
  appropriate time.</p>

  <p>On the following morning, after a careful study of my father's atlas of
  London, which I had brought with me from Maidstone, I set forth, hand-bag in
  hand and encouraged by the good wishes of my comrades and of Lilith in
  particular. Entering the Underground Railway at Mark Lane, I came to the
  surface at Charing Cross Station and bore away northwards across Leicester
  Square. During the journey, I had turned over in my mind the plan of attack
  to which I stood committed, with increasing distaste, I must admit, as the
  time for its execution drew nearer. And as my dislike grew, so also did my
  scepticism. I found myself recalling the fact that Lilith, successful as she
  claimed to be, was yet a fashion-plate artist very much against her own
  wishes, and reflecting that, if her silent willing were as efficacious as she
  believed it to be, she might surely compel the purchase of the kind of work
  that she enjoyed doing, instead of being herself compelled to follow a
  distasteful occupation. However, it was useless to think about it now. I had
  promised to give the method a trial and must carry out my promise.</p>

  <p>These reflections brought me to the bottom of Wardour Street, and my
  attention was now fully occupied by the search for Mr. Campbell's shop. Mr.
  Otway had omitted to give me the number of the house, but I remembered his
  saying that it was on the west side near the Oxford Street end; so I walked
  slowly up the east side and scanned the shop-fronts across the road. Near the
  top of the street my eye lighted on a smallish shop, above the window of
  which was inscribed in faded gold lettering "Donald Campbell," and I
  immediately crossed the road, becoming aware as I did so of a sudden access
  of nervousness. For this was a new experience to me. Hitherto all my
  transactions with shopkeepers had been in the character of a purchaser; and
  my transformation into a vendor was accompanied by a diffidence and shyness
  that I had not expected or foreseen. Indeed, in the course of that short
  journey across the road, my bashfulness increased so much that I had nearly
  forgotten my promise to Lilith and was on the point of entering the shop when
  it flashed into my mind.</p>

  <p>But even when I recalled Lilith's instructions, they were not easy to
  carry out. I swerved from the shop door to the side of the window and stood
  there trying to concentrate my will-power. But it would not be concentrated.
  In the window was displayed a fascinating array of base metal spoons which
  instantly riveted my attention; particularly a set of the late seventeenth
  century, wrought in a fine-coloured latten, and exhibiting in a most charming
  manner the combined effect of delicate workmanship, with the patina of age
  and the softening of outlines from use and wear.</p>

  <p>Unconsciously, I had begun to compare them with my own cruder productions
  before I realized that my will-power had escaped control. Then I jerked
  myself back from the spoons to my present task, and, hastily drawing the
  paper from my pocket, fixed my eyes on the written command and struggled to
  concentrate my thoughts on it and to suppress a growing consciousness of the
  absurdity of the whole proceeding. Presently I raised my eyes from the paper,
  and as they sought to dodge the spoons, they encountered another object
  equally disturbing. "It was only a face at the window," as the ridiculous
  song has it, but it instantly engrossed my attention and transported me in
  spirit, not to any Highland glen, but straight away to the banks of the
  Jordan; a fattish face, framed with glossy, black hair that broke out at the
  temples into rows of little crisp curls like a barrister's wig; a face with
  small, grey eyes, full under the lids, and surmounted by strong, black
  eyebrows, with full, red lips and a rather sketchy nose of the general form
  of a William pear with the stalk uppermost. It was clearly not Mr. Campbell's
  face, but it appertained to the establishment; and, recalling Lilith's
  instructions to direct my will power with more precision by fixing my eyes on
  the dealer, I directed a stony stare at the face and willed silently. But
  here I was countered again; for the owner of the face was also apparently
  possessed of psychic gifts, and fixed on me a gaze of such intensity that I
  was covered with confusion. On this I straightway forgot all about
  will-power, and, hastily pocketing the paper, walked nervously and guiltily
  into the shop.</p>

  <p>The proprietor of the face confronted me impassively across the counter;
  and such was my trepidation that, although he obviously was not Mr. Campbell,
  I could think of nothing better than to ask him if he was; whereupon he
  completed my discomfiture by replying in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>"I am Mrs. Otway," said I; at which he suddenly grew keenly attentive, and
  I continued: "I understand that Mr. Otway&mdash;Mr. Lewis Otway&mdash;has
  written to you about me. I had a letter from him to that effect."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Campbell, "he has; and, if I remember rightly, he
  suggested that I might be able to dispose of some of your work. I think he
  said you did some repouss or something of the kind."</p>

  <p>Apparently Mr. Campbell was preparing to treat me as an amateur, and my
  work as the product of a hobby. This would not do at all. Before saying
  anything further, I opened my bag and handed out the pieces one by one,
  setting them on the counter before him.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said he. "Yes; ha&mdash;hum; this isn't exactly what I expected." He
  picked up a teaspoon, turned it over between his fingers, closely examined
  the joining of the shank and bowl and the little bust that formed the knob,
  and then held it at arm's length with his head on one side. There was
  something in the action and the facial expression that accompanied it which
  encouraged me even before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Nithe thpoon that," was his comment as he laid it down (I observed that
  he tended to develop a lisp when preoccupied or off his guard); "well made,
  well designed; quite original, too. Spoons are my fancy&mdash;you saw that
  set in the window. If I could afford it, I would specialize in them more than
  I do. Not but what I'm fond of all goldsmith's work if it's good&mdash;or any
  other art work, for that matter; but I do love a good spoon."</p>

  <p>This was pleasant hearing, for I had a weakness for spoons myself. They
  are useful objects, they admit of infinite variety in design, and their small
  size adapted them peculiarly to my rather limited resources.</p>

  <p>"But there is one thing that you must bear in mind," continued Mr.
  Campbell. "Single spoons are not very saleable unless they are antique or
  collectors' pieces. Modern spoons are bought for use as well as ornament, and
  buyers like them in sets; not all alike, of course, but with a general design
  running through the set. Twelve spoons, all different, but all brothers;
  that's what they want."</p>

  <p>"Like the apostle sets," said I.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "but we don't want any more apostles. Too many on the
  market already. The apostles are done. They're a back number. Everybody does
  them because they can't think of anything else connected with the number
  twelve. But there is an opening for something original. If you can do me a
  set with a good striking design, I think I know where I can place them at a
  liberal price."</p>

  <p>I made a note of this proposal, and Mr. Campbell proceeded with his
  examination of my samples, accompanying the process with shrewd comments and
  useful hints. "Now, I'm rather doubtful about this," said he, picking up a
  bronze paper-weight on which was a little figure with an open book; "it's
  pretty and might take the fancy of a bookish man, but I question whether
  you'll get paid for the work that you've put into it. People don't always
  realize the value of a bronze casting. You must have done this by the cire
  perdue process."</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"Well, I should save that for more important pieces. Simple modelling and
  sand-casting is good enough for paper-weights. And you are too lavish with
  your silver. Just feel this candlestick. You could have done it with half the
  silver and got paid just as much. The extra cost of the unnecessary silver
  will have to come off the workmanship&mdash;at least, that is the tendency,
  although it is nominally sold by weight."</p>

  <p>As Mr. Campbell was speaking, a woman came out of an inner room and
  advanced to the counter. I glanced at her casually and then looked again more
  attentively, for I had instantly the feeling of having seen her before,
  though I could not recollect where. She was a Jewess of the dark and sallow
  type, about my own age, and of a sombre and rather forbidding aspect; and the
  glance that she cast on my samples, though impassive, was faintly
  disparaging.</p>

  <p>"This is Mrs. Otway, me dear," said Mr. Campbell. "You remember the letter
  I showed you about her. And these pretty things are her work."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Campbell&mdash;as I assumed her to be&mdash;raised her eyes and
  bestowed on me a quietly insolent stare, but made no remark. Then she cast
  another disparaging glance at my wares and said coldly: "They are all right
  of their kind; but you don't want to fill the place up with modern
  stuff."</p>

  <p>Disagreeable as the remark was, its matter impressed me less than its
  manner. For again I was sensible of a certain vague familiarity in the voice,
  the intonation and the accent. She gave me, however, no opportunity for
  studying either, for, with the curt observation that "she supposed he knew
  his own business," she retired to the inner room without taking any further
  notice of me.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Campbell, "there's some truth in what my wife says. I
  can't afford to lock up my capital in things that I can't sell. But I like
  your work. It is good work, and you'll improve. I am willing to buy this lot
  of pieces&mdash;at a price. But it will have to be a low price, because I
  don't know how they will go. If you take my advice, you'll leave them with me
  and let me try the market with them. When I have sold one or two I shall know
  what I can do with them, and then I can offer you a fair price based on what
  they fetch. How will that thoot you?"</p>

  <p>It seemed, on the whole, the most satisfactory arrangement, though I
  should have liked to have some definite idea as to the value of my work. I
  mentioned this, pointing out that I wanted to know if it would be worth my
  while to continue this kind of occupation.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Campbell, "you leave the things with me, and I will look
  them over carefully and weigh the silver. Then I will make you the best offer
  I can for the lot, and you can either accept it or refuse it, or wait and see
  what the things fetch. Give me your address and I will write you out a
  receipt for what you leave. Will that do?"</p>

  <p>I replied that it would do admirably, whereupon he supplied me with a slip
  of paper and pen and ink, and retired to the desk with my collection to write
  out the receipt. I had taken off my glove and was beginning to write when
  somebody entered the shop with a quick, light step, suggesting a young and
  active man. Just behind me the footsteps shopped short, and a pleasant,
  masculine voice addressed the dealer.</p>

  <p>"All right, Mr. Campbell; don't let me disturb you. I'm in no hurry."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid, sir, your things are not quite ready, but if you don't mind
  waiting a moment I'll make sure."</p>

  <p>"I suspected," the voice rejoined, "that I might be a little
  over-punctual. However, you finish what you are doing, while I browse round
  the museum."</p>

  <p>At the first sound of the voice my pen stopped short; and it seemed as if
  my heart stopped, too&mdash;though it soon began to make up for lost time. I
  was disconcerted and vaguely annoyed that a small surprise should set up such
  a disproportionate disturbance. Perhaps, too, I was a little startled to find
  a voice so long unheard elicit such instant and undoubting recognition. But I
  recovered immediately and resumed my writing, though, to be sure, the
  pen-point no longer traced the firm and steady lines of the first-written
  words. Meanwhile, Mr. Campbell had completed his receipt and we now exchanged
  our documents, I checking his list of my sample works, and he scanning my
  address with apparent surprise.</p>

  <p>"Wellclose Square," he read out. "There is a Wellclose Square somewhere
  down Wapping way. It won't be that one?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I think it is actually in Ratcliff. When shall I hear from
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I will write and post the letter this evening."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr. Campbell. Good morning."</p>

  <p>As we exchanged bows, I turned and met the newcomer approaching the
  counter. He glanced at me, at first without recognition; then he looked
  again.</p>

  <p>"Why, surely it is Miss Vardon!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Wrong, Mr. Davenant," said I. "It is Mrs. Otway. But that is a mere
  quibble. I am the person whom you knew as Miss Vardon."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," said he, "what a piece of luck to meet you&mdash;and here of
  all places!"</p>

  <p>"Is this a peculiarly unlikely place, then?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose it isn't, really; at any rate, I mustn't let Mr. Campbell
  hear me say that it is. Do you mind waiting a moment while I settle my little
  business with him? I want to hear all your news."</p>

  <p>His little business amounted to no more than an arrangement that he should
  call in about three days for his "things," whatever they were, and when this
  had been settled, we left the shop together.</p>

  <p>"Which way are you walking?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I really don't know," I answered. "I think I had some dim idea of seeing
  the town and taking a look at the shops."</p>

  <p>"Then," said he, "as you are a country mouse, whereas I am a town sparrow
  of the deepest dye, perhaps I may be permitted to act as conductor and
  expositor of the wonders of the Metropolis, while you give me the news from
  Maidstone."</p>

  <p>"There is little to tell you excepting that I have lost my father. He died
  quite suddenly, about two months ago, from heart failure."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Mr. Davenant, "I had a presentiment that it was so. Seeing you
  in mourning, I was afraid to ask after him; and I need not tell you how
  deeply I sympathise with you. I remember how much you were to one another.
  What a mercy it is that you were married!"</p>

  <p>To this I made no reply, and for a time we walked on slowly without
  speaking. But though nothing was said, much was thought, at least by me. For
  I had to make up my mind now, and once for all, on a point that I felt to be
  of vital importance. Should I tell him how things were with me? Or should I
  let him think that all was well, and that I was a normal married woman?
  Something&mdash;I did not ask myself what&mdash;urged me to tell him
  everything. But caution, prudence, whispered&mdash;and that none too
  softly&mdash;that it were better not. The sudden wave of emotion that had
  surged over me at the sound of his voice was still a vivid and startling
  memory; and it counselled reticence.</p>

  <p>Thus two opposing forces contended; on the one hand, an emotional impulse,
  on the other the admonitions of reason; and it is needless to say that reason
  played losing game. Swiftly I argued out the issues. Sooner or later, the
  inevitable question must come, and with it the choice of an evasion or a
  straightforward answer. If it was to be evasion, then I put Jasper Davenant
  out of my life at once and for ever, for the evasion could never be
  maintained; must shut out this gleam of sunshine that came to me from the
  old, happy days as if to light up my sombre, lonely life, and wend on my
  pilgrimage without a friend save the companions of my working days.</p>

  <p>And reason whispered again that it were better so.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-14"
     id="ch-2-14"></a>XIV.&mdash; JASPER DAVENANT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE silence that had fallen between me and my companion
  remained unbroken (with one exception, when he briefly drew my attention to
  the old stone name-tablet, inscribed "Wardour Streete 1686") until we came
  opposite a church, standing back from the road, and distinguished by a sort
  of tumour&mdash;containing a clock&mdash;on its spire. Here Mr. Davenant
  halted, and looking up at the tower, remarked:</p>

  <p>"A quaint-looking church, this; odd and ugly, but yet not without a
  certain character and picturesqueness. Quite an aristocratic church, too, for
  it is the burial place of a king."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said I. "Which of the kings is buried there?"</p>

  <p>"He was but a shabby little king&mdash;Theodore of Corsica&mdash;and he
  has the shabbiest little moralizing monument. But he was a somewhat original
  monarch in his way, for, being in acute financial difficulties, he conceived
  the brilliant idea of making over his kingdom to his creditors. Would you
  care to see the monument?"</p>

  <p>I assented, without enthusiasm, and we mounted the steps to the grimy
  churchyard, where presently, against the wall of the church, we found the
  monument. And still, as we deciphered the weathered inscription, I debated
  the question whether I should or should not tell him; and still I reached no
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>"By the way," my companion said, suddenly, "I am acting the showman on the
  assumption that you are the complete and perfect country bumpkin. But perhaps
  you are, by now, a fully acclimatized Londoner. How long have you been living
  in town?"</p>

  <p>"About a month."</p>

  <p>"Then the hay-seed is still in your hair, so to speak. I still address a
  country cousin, and have not presumed unduly; though, no doubt, you are
  beginning to learn the rudiments. I heard Mr. Campbell speak of Wellclose
  Square, for instance, as a region known to you."</p>

  <p>"Yes. That is where I live."</p>

  <p>As I caught his look of astonishment my heart began to race; for I knew
  that the inevitable question was coming.</p>

  <p>"I suppose your husband is connected with the docks?"</p>

  <p>"No," I replied. "And he doesn't live at Wellclose Square. I am not living
  with my husband, Mr. Davenant. I never have lived with him, and it is not my
  intention ever to live with him."</p>

  <p>The deed was done. The murder was out. And though I knew that I had taken
  the wrong course, I drew a deep breath of relief. As to Mr. Davenant, he was,
  for a few moments, too much taken aback to make any comment. At length he
  said, somewhat gloomily:</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear this, Mrs. Otway. Very sorry. It sounds as if your
  domestic affairs were not very comfortable."</p>

  <p>"They are not," I answered. "But, as I have told you so much, I should
  like to tell you what the position really is. Would you mind?"</p>

  <p>"Mind!" he exclaimed. "Of course I want to know, if you are willing to
  tell me. Aren't we old friends? I am most concerned about you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr. Davenant. I should like to tell you how this extraordinary
  position has come about. Shall we sit down? This place is quieter than the
  street."</p>

  <p>He dusted the wooden bench with his handkerchief, and we sat down just
  below the shabby monument of the poor, little, bankrupt king. And there I
  told once again that tragic story of cross-purposes and well-meant
  blundering. I had intended to give him but a bare outline of the catastrophe;
  but it could not be. For the bald fact was that I had sold myself to Mr.
  Otway for money; and my womanly pride and self-respect would not be satisfied
  with anything short of a complete justification such as might be accepted by
  a scrupulous, high-minded man. And as I poured out my miserable history,
  glancing at him from time to time, I was surprised and almost alarmed at the
  change that came over him. He was a sunny-natured man, buoyant,
  high-spirited, playful and humorous, though all in a quiet way. But now, as
  he listened to my story, the genial face grew rigid, the humorous mouth set
  hard and stern, and the short, sharp questions that he put from time to time,
  came in a voice that was strange to me.</p>

  <p>"So now," said I, when I had come to the end of my recital, "you will
  understand why I refuse to recognize this marriage; and why I elect to live
  the life of a spinster, though without a spinster's privileges."</p>

  <p>In a moment his face softened, and his clear, hazel eyes looked into mine
  with grave tenderness.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said; "I understand. I wish I could say more. I wish I could
  tell you adequately how I grieve for you&mdash;for all the sorrow that you
  have had to endure and for the maimed life that lies before you. But words
  are poor instruments." He laid his hand on mine for an instant, and added:
  "Yet I hope you will feel what I want to express in these threadbare
  phrases."</p>

  <p>I thanked him for the sympathy, which he had indeed made very clearly
  evident, and for a time neither of us spoke. Nevertheless, I could see that
  he was cogitating something. Once or twice he seemed about to speak, for he
  looked at me, but then again bent his gaze reflectively on the ground. At
  length, with some hesitation, he said:</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't think me inquisitive or impertinent, but I feel rather
  anxious as to&mdash;as to how you are placed. I gather that this man Otway
  does not&mdash;er&mdash;contribute&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He is quite willing to. But I can't allow him to maintain me if I
  repudiate the marriage."</p>

  <p>"No; at least I think you are quite wise not to. But&mdash;you don't mind
  my asking, do you? Are you properly provided for? I'm really not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course, you're not," I interrupted, smiling at his diffidence. "As to
  my means&mdash;well, I don't quite know what they will be eventually, but at
  present I am living in a reasonable state of comfort. I am not anxious about
  the future."</p>

  <p>My answer did not seem to satisfy him completely, for he continued to
  cogitate rather uneasily. But, now that I had the key, I could read pretty
  clearly, without the aid of any magic crystal, what was passing in his mind.
  He knew that I lived in a squalid east-end neighbourhood. He had seen me at
  the dealers, and evidently surmised that I was not there as a buyer; that I
  was in straitened circumstances&mdash;perhaps in a state of actual
  poverty&mdash;and that I was disposing of my jewellery and valuables to
  enable me to live. That, I had no doubt, was what he suspected; and the
  question that he was debating so earnestly was whether he could, without
  impertinence, extract any further information and whether our friendship was
  intimate enough to allow of his making any kind of offer of help.</p>

  <p>I should have liked to set his mind at rest, but, in truth, I was none too
  confident about my future. That depended largely on the nature of Mr.
  Campbell's offer; on my ability to earn a reasonable livelihood.</p>

  <p>"Well," Mr. Davenant said, at length, "I hope your confidence is
  justified. But in any case, I suppose you have friends?</p>

  <p>"There's no need for you to worry about me," I replied,
  evasively&mdash;for I had no near relatives from whom I could claim
  assistance. "I am in quite comfortable circumstances at present. And now let
  us put away my bothersome affairs and talk of something more pleasant."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said he. "Let us choose an agreeable topic and discuss it in
  all its bearings as we used to do." He drew his watch from his pocket, and,
  glancing at it, continued: "It is now nearly one o'clock. What do you say to
  the question of lunch as an agreeable topic for our debate?"</p>

  <p>I admitted that the subject was not without its attractions.</p>

  <p>"Then," said he, "I will suggest that a club is an appropriate place in
  which to consume it, and that a mixed club satisfies the most extreme
  proprieties."</p>

  <p>"I should hardly have suspected you of a mixed dub."</p>

  <p>"In strict confidence," he replied, "between you and me and our friend
  Theodore of insolvent memory, I have another&mdash;unmixed&mdash;for normal
  club purposes. This one is my lunch club. It is quite near to my chambers,
  and is quieter and more pleasant than a restaurant. And it has a special
  character of its own, as is indicated by its name. It is called the 'Magpies'
  Club."</p>

  <p>"That sounds rather ominous."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it? But it isn't a burglars' club. Its members are collectors and
  connoisseurs&mdash;furniture and china maniacs and so forth; and the main
  function of the club is to enable them to show their specimens to one another
  and to exchange or sell duplicate pieces. May I take it that you consent to
  honour the 'Magpies'?"</p>

  <p>I accepted the invitation gladly, for a month's residence in the East End
  had made me decidedly appreciative of the amenities of the more civilized
  regions. We decided to walk to Essex Street, in which the club had its
  premises, and to go by way of the side streets for greater quiet and ease of
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"You spoke just now of your chambers," said I. "Does that mean that you
  are in practice now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But not in the law. I finished my legal studies and got called, but
  then I decided to give up the Bench and the Woolsack, though they shouted for
  me never so loudly, and return to an old love. I am now an architect."</p>

  <p>"Is a barrister allowed to practice as an architect?"</p>

  <p>"On that I am not quite clear; but it really doesn't matter to me. It is a
  question for the benchers or other authorities."</p>

  <p>"Have you been in practice long?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly three weeks to-day. And when I tell you that I have already
  received a commission to design and erect a greenhouse no less than twelve
  feet by eight in plan, you will realize that I am mounting the ladder of
  professional success, with the speed of an eagle with a balloon attachment.
  My client, by the way, is a member of the club."</p>

  <p>Thus gossiping, we made our way by devious routes through the less
  frequented streets, by Garrick Street, Covent Garden and Drury Lane, until,
  by the Law Courts, we emerged into the Strand, crossed to Essex Street, and
  presently arrived at the roomy, old-fashioned house in which the Magpies had
  their meeting-place.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant, homely club, and certainly there could be no question
  as to its eminent respectability, for the aspect of the members&mdash;mostly
  middle-aged and many of them elderly&mdash;bordered on the frumpish. The room
  in which we selected our table was a large, oblong apartment, quietly
  furnished and decorated and provided with a glazed museum case, which
  occupied the centre; while a sort of dais at one end was devoted to the
  display of pieces of furniture exhibited by the members. I noticed, too, that
  the walls were occupied by pictures, each of which bore a written descriptive
  label.</p>

  <p>"Are you interested in ancient ivories?" Mr. Davenant asked, as we looked
  into the glass case, in which a collection of very brown and cracked
  specimens were exhibited by a Mr. Udimore-Jones. "For my part, I find it
  difficult to develop great enthusiasm over the dental arrangements of
  superannuated elephants, carved into funny shapes by piously-facetious
  middle-agers. Look out! Here comes my client. Let us sneak off to our table.
  Aha! Too late! She's seen us."</p>

  <p>"Which is your client?" I asked, looking round furtively.</p>

  <p>"The elderly damsel with the smile&mdash;a Miss Tallboy Smith. There! She
  has caught my eye now. Did you ever see such a set of teeth? She had better
  be careful or Udimore-Jones will have her."</p>

  <p>We were edging away towards our table, with a feeble hope of escape, when
  she caught us.</p>

  <p>"Now, I don't believe you've seen my cup," she exclaimed, with an engaging
  smile. "You must see it. It is not only genuine Nantgarw, but the roses on it
  are unquestionable Billingsleys."</p>

  <p>"Observe," said Mr. Davenant, "the pride of the inveterate collector.
  You'd think she had painted those roses herself."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, you wouldn't," retorted Miss Tallboy-Smith; "not if you had seen
  them and knew anything about ceramic painting. And as to pride, isn't it
  something to be proud of? Nantgarw porcelain is rare, and roses painted by
  Billingsley are rare; and when you have them both in a single piece, why
  then, you see, you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then," said Mr. Davenant, "you multiply the rarity of the one by the
  rarity of the other, and the product of the multiplication is the rarity of
  the piece as a whole."</p>

  <p>"Isn't he absurd?" she simpered, "treating me to a complete private view
  of the 'ancient ivories.'"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly incorrigible. Don't you agree with me,
  Miss&mdash;Mrs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Otway," said I.</p>

  <p>"Oh, really! Now I wonder&mdash;my brother knew a Mr. Otway&mdash;oh, but
  he was a money-lender. That wouldn't be&mdash;but won't you come and look at
  my cup?"</p>

  <p>We returned to the glass case, of which Miss Tallboy Smith opened a door
  and lifted from its shelf a dainty porcelain teacup.</p>

  <p>"Just feel how thin and light it is," she said, holding it out to me.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't if I were you," said Mr. Davenant. "This Nantgarw stuff
  crumbles like a baked egg-shell; and it's hideously valuable."</p>

  <p>"Don't take any notice of him," said Miss Tallboy Smith. "Just feel
  it&mdash;it's positively delicious to touch; and look at the lovely roses; no
  one but William Billingsley could have painted those roses. And, if there
  could be any doubt, you have only to turn the piece up and look at the
  bottom. There is Billingsley's personal mark&mdash;the number 7. That's
  infallible."</p>

  <p>I took from her hand the delicate, translucent cup, and was admiring the
  freedom and softness of the flower painting when she drew nearer and said in
  a warning whisper: "Here comes Major Dewham-Brown. If he tries to sell you
  anything, don't buy it. He only brings his bad bargains here."</p>

  <p>She had barely uttered her warning when a brassy voice behind me
  exclaimed: "How d'you do, Miss Tallboy Smith? and how are you, Davenant?" and
  a tall, smart, rather stupid-looking man with a large nose&mdash;which seemed
  to have been produced at the expense of his eyes and chin&mdash;sailed into
  my field of vision.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said he. "Pretty cup, that. Worth a pot of money, too, I expect,
  though I don't know much about 'em. And that reminds me that I've got rather
  an interesting thing that I picked up the other day; bit of old church plate;
  seventeenth century, if not earlier. Like to see it?"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for a reply, he fished out of a "poacher's" pocket a flat
  object wrapped in a silk handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Curious piece, this: interested me very much. The repouss-work on it is
  remarkably fine." He unfolded the handkerchief as he spoke, and at length
  extracted, with a sort of conjuror's flourish, a small, circular, silver
  platter&mdash;apparently a paten, to judge by its size. This he handed to
  Miss Tallboy-Smith, who grinned at it indulgently and passed it to Mr.
  Davenant, who, having looked it over without enthusiasm, handed it to me. A
  very brief inspection, with the piece in my hand, was enough to make Miss
  Tallboy-Smith's warning unnecessary; for, apart from the unsuitability of the
  ornament&mdash;if it was really meant for a paten&mdash;it was an obvious
  electrotype, which had, however, been pickled, polished and sulphured with
  intent to deceive. Having noted this fact, I returned the piece to its owner
  with a few words of polite and colourless commendation of the design; and the
  Major, chilled by the lack of enthusiasm, invested his treasure once more in
  its silken wrapping and went off in search of a more appreciative audience.
  Under cover of his parting courtesies to Miss Tallboy-Smith, Mr. Davenant and
  I retreated to our table.</p>

  <p>"That antique of the Major's looked to me rather like fake," said my
  companion, when we had ordered our lunch. "It was so very venerable."</p>

  <p>"It is an electrotype, sulphured to give an appearance of age," said
  I.</p>

  <p>"Is it, by Jove? Now, how did you spot it as an electrotype?"</p>

  <p>"It was the disagreement between the back and the face that first
  attracted my attention. The face was repouss&mdash;pretty coarse
  too&mdash;but there was not a vestige of a toolmark on the back, where, of
  course, most of the punch-marks would be; nothing but the smooth surface of
  the deposited metal."</p>

  <p>Mr. Davenant chuckled. "I seem to have imported an expert Magpie. Oh! But
  I remember now that you and your father used to do all sorts of wonderful
  works in metal. Ha, ha! Poor old Dewham-Brown! He little suspected that he
  was dealing with a practical artificer."</p>

  <p>Here the advent of food put a temporary stop to conversation, for we were
  both pretty sharp-set; but during the progress of the meal I looked about me
  and was vastly entertained by the proceedings of the Magpies. The glass case
  was the centre of interest, around which a small crowd of enthusiasts
  gathered, eagerly discussing the exhibits, which the proud owners expounded,
  with their noses flattened against the glass, or tenderly lifted out for
  closer inspection. And now and again a new exhibitor would arrive with a bag
  or attach case, from which fresh treasures were disgorged into the glazed
  sanctuary.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said I, "your members will have nothing to do with any but
  antique works?"</p>

  <p>"Not as a rule," Mr. Davenant replied. "The collector is usually a lover
  of old things. But there are exceptions. A good many of the pictures shown
  here are modern; some, I suspect, are shown by the artists themselves. Then
  we have one member who collects modern pottery exclusively&mdash;not
  commercial stuff, of course, but the work of modern artist-potters, like De
  Morgan, the Martin Brothers and other individual workers. Fine stuff it is,
  too. I have a few pieces myself. And, talk of the old gentleman&mdash;there
  he is. I'll fetch him over and make him show us what he has got in that
  bag."</p>

  <p>He rose from the table, and crossed the room, and I saw him accost a very
  tall, pleasant-looking young man who was bearing down on the glass case with
  a good-sized hand-bag, but readily allowed himself to be led over our
  table.</p>

  <p>"Now, Hawkesley," said Mr. Davenant, "my guest wants to see what really
  high-class modern pottery is like. What have you got?"</p>

  <p>"I have only three pieces with me," replied Mr. Hawkesley, "and they are
  all of the same type; what I call 'mystery-ware.'"</p>

  <p>"What is the mystery about it? Mr. Davenant asked.</p>

  <p>"The mystery is, who makes it? As far as I know, there is only one dealer
  who has it, and he absolutely refuses to say where he gets it. I have never
  seen any of it exhibited&mdash;excepting here&mdash;and nobody can tell me
  the name of the potter or anything about it beyond the fact that it seems to
  be the exclusive monopoly of this one dealer, and that he has very little of
  it, and charges accordingly. But it is wonderful stuff." He lifted out of his
  bag a couple of jars and a bowl&mdash;handling them with that curious
  delicacy that one often notices in persons with large, strong, supple
  hands&mdash;and placed them carefully on the table.</p>

  <p>"You see," he continued, "there are two methods of treatment, which are
  sometimes combined, as on this jar; and these two styles are based on two
  very different types of old work&mdash;the old English slip-ware, such as the
  Wrotham and Staffordshire and Toftware, and the old French Henri Deux, or
  Oiron ware. In the one, the ornament is produced by laying on pipes or
  threads of coloured slip&mdash;that is, clay in the semi-liquid state; in the
  other by inlaying coloured paste or enamel in cavities in the body, which
  seems to be made with tools like those used by book binders. This covered
  jar&mdash;which looks almost like a piece of fine Japanese
  cloisonn&mdash;and this bowl show the inlay method, and this other jar is an
  example of the slip decoration, but with one or two spots of enamel
  inlay."</p>

  <p>"I think I prefer the pure inlay," said Mr. Davenant.</p>

  <p>"So do I," said Mr. Hawkesley, "and so, I think, does the artist. All his
  finest work is done by the inlay method, though he uses the slip decoration
  with such skill and taste that it is virtually a new method. The old Wrotham
  and Toftware looks very primitive by the side of this scholarly, refined
  work."</p>

  <p>I turned the three pieces of pottery over in my hands and warmly commended
  the judgment of the collector. No modern work that I had ever seen approached
  it for perfection of finish or grace of design; while the colour-scheme
  combined richness, delicacy and restraint in a truly marvellous manner. It
  seemed to unite the brilliancy of enamel to the sober beauty of old tapestry.
  And even the little blue bird, inlaid on the bottom of each piece to form the
  potter's mark, was finished with care and taste.</p>

  <p>"May one inquire as to the local habitation and name of the dealer?" Mr.
  Davenant asked.</p>

  <p>"You may," was the reply. "His name is Maurice Goldstein, and he is to be
  found at Number 56, Hand Court, Holborn. And I should like to wring his
  neck."</p>

  <p>We both laughed at the vindictive tone in which this benevolent wish was
  uttered, and at the sudden ferocity of aspect that swept over the usually
  good-humoured, kindly face.</p>

  <p>"Why this homicidal craving?" Mr. Davenant asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see," the other demanded, indignantly, "that this infernal
  Goldswine&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You needn't," said I.</p>

  <p>"That this miserable huckster is grinding the face of some poor artist;
  that he is not only devouring the earnings of this industrious, painstaking
  worker, but&mdash;for his own paltry profit&mdash;he is robbing that artist
  of the credit&mdash;of the fame&mdash;to which his genius and his enthusiasm
  entitle him. Look at this lovely jar! I gave that mean worm ten guineas for
  it. How much do you suppose he gave the potter?"</p>

  <p>"Ten shillings, perhaps," suggested Mr. Davenant.</p>

  <p>"Probably not much more, though there is getting on for a week's work in
  it."</p>

  <p>"Still," I said, with a mischievous desire to stir up his indignation
  afresh, "the potter probably enjoys making these beautiful things. The work
  is its own reward."</p>

  <p>"I can't agree to that," Mr. Hawkesley rejoined, warmly. "He doesn't enjoy
  being hard up and having to work for a pittance. Besides, it isn't just. This
  man makes a jar that is going to give me a life-long pleasure. I want to pay
  him for that pleasure. I want to know who he is, to shake his hand and thank
  him and tell him that he is the salt of the earth. And this Shylock hides him
  away and just feeds on him like the beastly parasite that he is."</p>

  <p>He gathered up the treasured masterpieces, and having wished us adieu,
  with a sudden return to his customary geniality, crossed to the glass case to
  find a vacant niche for his samples of "mystery ware."</p>

  <p>"I like Jack Hawkesley," said my companion; as we watched him.</p>

  <p>"So do I," I agreed warmly. "He takes a human interest in the artist. I
  wish more collectors were like him."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Davenant. "He is a good type of rich man. Would that there
  were more Hawkesleys." He poured out the coffee which the waitress had just
  brought and then asked: "What do you think of this club&mdash;as a feeding
  and resting place, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"It seems a comfortable, homely place, and the members and their exhibits
  are quite interesting."</p>

  <p>"I find it so. You wouldn't care to join, I suppose? It is cheap, as clubs
  go: five guineas a year and no entrance fee. I should think you would find it
  a great convenience, living so far from the centre of town."</p>

  <p>"It would be a great convenience. But should I be eligible? I am not a
  collector, you know."</p>

  <p>"No, but you are something of an expert. At any rate, Hawkesley and I
  would manage the formalities. Think it over, and if you decide to honour us,
  drop me a line. This is my address&mdash;56, Clifford's Inn."</p>

  <p>He handed me his card, and when he had made a note of my address, I
  prepared to depart.</p>

  <p>"I have wasted a fearful amount of your time, Mr. Davenant," said I; "but
  it has been a very pleasant interlude for me."</p>

  <p>"Has it really? I hope it has. For my part, I have enjoyed myself just as
  I did in the old days when you used to let me wag a philosophic chin at you,
  and I am reluctant to let you go so soon. Mayn't I see you to the station, or
  wherever you are going?</p>

  <p>"I thought of walking back to get myself acquainted with London."</p>

  <p>"Then let me put you on the right road and show you some of the short
  cuts."</p>

  <p>"But what about your work?"</p>

  <p>He regarded me with that quaint, humorous smile that I had always found so
  attractive. "My work is, at present, of a somewhat intermittent type. This is
  one of the intermissions. Let us fare forth and study the architectural
  beauties of the Metropolis."</p>

  <p>And we fared forth accordingly.</p>

  <p>The short cuts discovered by my companion did not in the least conform to
  Euclid's definition of a straight line; and their brevity was relieved by
  sundry excursions into alleys and by-streets and incursions into churches and
  other ancient buildings. They led us by way of the Temple and its old round
  church, Mitre Court, Fetter Lane, Nevill's Court, Gough Square, and so to St.
  Paul's Churchyard and into the Cathedral; thence by Paul's Alley, Paternoster
  Row, Cheapside and Lombard Street, dropping into one or two churches on our
  way, until we came out on Great Tower Hill, and drifted slowly down Royal
  Mint Street. And all the while we gossiped pleasantly of this wonderful city
  and its wonderful, inexhaustible past; and my guide expounded, with all his
  old gaiety and brightness&mdash;and with astonishing knowledge of his
  subject&mdash;until I had almost forgotten Wellclose Square and the sinister
  shadow that hung over my life, and seemed to be back in the untroubled days
  of my girlhood.</p>

  <p>But not quite. For, even as I talked&mdash;or more often
  listened&mdash;with the liveliest interest and pleasure, a project was
  maturing in my mind. I had, in fact, conceived a brilliant idea. Mr.
  Davenant's suggestion that I should join the club had started a train of
  thought that ran as an under-current&mdash;in the subconscious mind, perhaps,
  as Lilith would have said. It had begun vaguely when I saw the modern
  pictures on the walls, and the modern works in the glass case and the Major
  hawking round his little platter. Here was a place in which the work of the
  unknown artist could be shown and perhaps sold; my own work, Lilith's work,
  the Titmouse's, Philibar's, even Miss Polton's. For five guineas a year I
  could open this emporium, not only to myself, but to my fellow-workers; could
  slip past the dealer and secure his profits for us all. I say it was a
  brilliant idea&mdash;at least, it appeared so to me; and throughout that long
  peregrination, made delightful by the sympathetic companionship of my
  newly-recovered friend it germinated and grew until, as we halted to say
  good-bye at the corner of Cable Street, it had grown to full maturity.</p>

  <p>"I have been thinking," said I, "of your suggestion&mdash;about joining
  the club, you know. It would be nice to have a place to go to for a rest or a
  meal, in the centre of town. And I shall often want such a place."</p>

  <p>His face brightened perceptibly&mdash;perhaps at the implied assurance
  that I could afford to spend five guineas.</p>

  <p>"Then, may I put your name up for election?"</p>

  <p>"Will you be so kind?"</p>

  <p>"Won't I? It will be jolly, and we shan't lose sight of one another again;
  though that was my fault for not writing. I was often on the point of sending
  you a letter, and then I felt a silly diffidence&mdash;thought that you might
  consider I was presuming on a mere acquaintanceship. However, I will propose
  you for membership at once, and in about a week's time you will be a
  full-blown Magpie. Then I will send you a line, though, of course, you will
  get the official notification."</p>

  <p>He handed me my bag, and with a hearty hand-shake, we said "Good-bye," and
  went our respective ways.</p>

  <p>It was but a few minutes' walk to Wellclose Square, and I took it slowly;
  for now that my companion was gone and I was bereft of his buoyancy and
  vitality, I was suddenly aware of intense bodily fatigue. Moreover, I felt a
  certain reluctance to bring to a definite close what had been an interval of
  quiet but perfect happiness. And so, in spite of my fatigue, I sauntered on,
  loitering awhile in St. George's churchyard and stopping to look up at the
  quaint stone name-tablet at the corner of Chigwell Lane, until weariness and
  growing hunger drove me homewards. And even then, it was not without regret
  that I pulled the brass bell-knob and, as it were, wrote "Finis" to this
  pleasant and eventful chapter.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-15"
     id="ch-2-15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE MAGIC PENDULUM</h2>

  <p class="first">THE weighty question whether my handicraft would yield me a
  livelihood was answered on the following morning by the arrival of a letter
  from Mr. Campbell; and it was answered, though not very emphatically, in the
  affirmative. The prices that he offered, provisionally&mdash;and advised me
  not to accept&mdash;were appallingly low; very little above those of mere
  commercial goods. But even so, it would be possible, by hard work and spare
  living, to eke out a bare subsistence. And it was fair to assume that Mr.
  Campbell's offer was, as indeed he explicitly stated, a minimum, on which an
  advance might be expected. Accordingly, I declined the offer and decided to
  await the results of actual sales to his customers.</p>

  <p>I was turning these matters over at the breakfast table, when Lilith came
  and took a vacant chair by my side.</p>

  <p>"Well, Sibyl," she said, in a low voice, "how did you fare yesterday? Did
  you have any success?</p>

  <p>"Yes. I came back with an empty bag."</p>

  <p>"And a full purse?</p>

  <p>"Ah! That is another matter. The tide of handicraft doesn't seem exactly
  to lead on to fortune."</p>

  <p>"I want to hear all about it," said Lilith. "But we can't discuss it here.
  Let us have a quiet talk up in my room after breakfast. If you will run up
  when you've finished, I will join you in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>I assented gladly, for Lilith, apart from what the irreverent Titmouse
  characterised as her "crystal-gazing tosh," was a sound adviser on business
  affairs; and a few minutes later I betook myself upstairs to her studio. I
  had scarcely seen this room before, for there was an unwritten law, sternly
  enforced by Miss Polton, forbidding the boarders to enter one another's
  workrooms except by invitation and on specific business, and I now looked
  about me with a good deal of curiosity.</p>

  <p>It was a queer room. The two sides of Lilith's personality, like two
  separate persons, seemed to have parcelled it out into two distinct
  territories. There was the working territory, neat, precise, business-like,
  strangely free from the usual muddle and disorder of a woman-artist's studio;
  the big water-colour easel, the orderly painting cabinet, the papier-mache
  lay figure, quaintly arrayed in a walking costume such as might have been
  seen in a Regent Street shop window (miraculously built up, as I observed, of
  draperies, pinned, tied or lightly stitched together), the charcoal studies
  from the figure, pinned up on the wall for reference, with careful pencil
  drawings of heads, hands and feet, and one or two casts of faces and hands.
  The working department was a model of matter-of-fact efficiency.</p>

  <p>In curious contrast to this was the domain of Lilith, the mystic. In a
  well-lighted corner stood a small table supporting a black velvet cushion on
  which reposed a crystal globe of the size of a cricket ball. Above the table
  a couple of book-shelves exhibited a collection of volumes treating of
  Spiritualism, Telepathy, Apparitions, Psychical Research and other occult
  subjects. On the upper shelf stood a box filled with the letters of a
  dissected alphabet; while, hanging on the wall, was a small heart-shaped
  object with tiny castors, which I assumed to be Planchette, and by its side a
  single Egyptian bead suspended at the end of a silken thread.</p>

  <p>Yet these two aspects of this strange girl's character were not without a
  connecting link. On the walls were several framed paintings signed "Winifred
  Blake," mystical figure subjects, recalling, but not imitating, the works of
  Burne Jones and Rosetti, exquisitely drawn and delicately painted in
  water-colour. The work on the easel was a similar drawing of a frieze-like
  character, the figures nude but with lightly indicated draperies; and one of
  the nude figures had been traced on to a fashion-plate board and was already
  partly clothed in the walking costume.</p>

  <p>My survey of the room and its contents was interrupted by the arrival of
  its occupant, who having seated me in the easy chair, perched herself on her
  painting-stool and opened the examination.</p>

  <p>"Now," said she, "I don't want to be inquisitive, but I do want to know
  just how you got on. Did you carry out the methods that I proposed?</p>

  <p>"I did&mdash;at least as far as the silent willing was
  concerned&mdash;though not very thoroughly. I don't think I did much in the
  way of suggestion."</p>

  <p>"And did you sell your work?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I may say I did," and here I gave her an account of Mr.
  Campbell's two alternative offers.</p>

  <p>"You have done admirably, Sibyl," she said enthusiastically. "Your first
  essay has been a perfect success. And now, tell me: are you convinced?"</p>

  <p>As I could not truthfully say that I was, I took refuge in polite evasion,
  which, however, Lilith brushed aside with some impatience.</p>

  <p>"I can never understand this kind of scepticism," said she. "You have the
  cause and effect before your eyes, but yet you refuse to recognise the
  connection. You take your work to this man. Outside the shop you will that he
  shall buy it. You go in and he does buy it. What more could you want?"</p>

  <p>"But he might have bought the things if I hadn't willed, you know."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she agreed; "he might. But that is not the way we reason about
  material things. I strike a match and apply it to a laid fire, and the fire
  burns. It might have burned if I had not applied the lighted match, but no
  one doubts the connection between the lighted match and the lighted fire.
  Physical causes and effects are accepted with unquestioning faith, but as
  soon as we come to spiritual or psychical phenomena, this extraordinary
  scepticism springs up&mdash;this curious refusal to admit and accept the
  obvious."</p>

  <p>"I am not asserting that there was no connection between the silent
  willing and the purchase of my work," said I. "All I say is that I don't
  regard the connection as proved. I can't decide for or against because there
  doesn't seem to be enough evidence either way."</p>

  <p>"Yes; I suppose you are right," she admitted, reluctantly. "But I should
  like to convince you, because I am sure you have very unusual powers."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a short space, and then, suddenly, she asked: "Have you
  ever been to a sance, Sibyl?"</p>

  <p>"Never," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Well," said she, "you ought to go to one&mdash;not to any of those silly
  public shows conducted by mere mountebanks, but to a private sance, carried
  out by really earnest people who are seeking to extend our knowledge. Would
  you care to come to one with me?"</p>

  <p>"It would be rather interesting," I replied, without much enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"It would," said she. "You were speaking of evidence just now. Well, at a
  genuine sance you would obtain evidence that I think would convince you of
  the reality of psychical phenomena. I have a friend&mdash;a Mr.
  Quecks&mdash;who has given me some most remarkable demonstrations, and I have
  no doubt that he would be very pleased for you to accompany me to one of
  them."</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Quecks a medium?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No; I shouldn't describe him as a medium, though he is very sensitive and
  has most extraordinary powers. But he is a profound student of super-normal
  phenomena and deeply interested in psychical research. May I ask him to show
  you some of his experiments?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Lilith; and I hope you will find me less disappointing than
  you have to-day. I am really quite curious about these things, although I
  admit a rather sceptical frame of mind. I was wondering, before you came up,
  what you do with that bead on the string."</p>

  <p>"That," replied Lilith, all agog at the question, "is the <i>pendule
  explorateur</i>&mdash;the magic pendulum. It is an instrument of the kind
  known in psychical science as an autoscope&mdash;an appliance for, as it
  were, bringing the subconscious into view."</p>

  <p>"But how does it work?"</p>

  <p>"It works by the influence of the subconscious mind upon the muscles. Let
  me show you&mdash;but you shall try it yourself because you are an
  unbeliever."</p>

  <p>She removed the crystal ball and its cushion from the table, and taking
  the bowl of loose letters, turned out its contents and rapidly arranged the
  letters in a circle, forming a clock-wise alphabet. Then she took the
  pendulum down from its hook.</p>

  <p>"Now," said she, "what you have to do is this: you rest your elbow on the
  table to steady your hand, and you hold the string with the thumb and finger,
  letting the bead hang just clear of the table in the centre of the circle;
  and you must keep your hand perfectly still and steady."</p>

  <p>"But if I do, the bead will remain still, too."</p>

  <p>"No, it won't, excepting just at first. Presently it will begin to swing,
  apparently of its own accord, but really in accordance with your mental
  state. For instance, if you let it hang inside a glass and you will that it
  shall strike the hour, it will strike the hour. If you will&mdash;or I hold
  your other hand and will&mdash;that it shall swing round in a circle to the
  right or left, it will swing round in the direction willed. But that is an
  exercise of the conscious will. In the experiment that we are making now we
  tap the subconscious. If there is any thing or person occupying your
  subconscious mind, the pendulum will spell out the name of that thing or
  person by swinging towards the letters. Let me put the chair comfortably for
  you, so that you can keep quite still."</p>

  <p>As I listened to Lilith's explanation I began to wish heartily that I had
  never embarked on this experiment. Of course, I did not believe for a moment
  that this absurd pendulum would develop the occult powers that Lilith claimed
  for it; but yet her confidence shook mine. And I had a very strong feeling
  that, on this day of all days, I should prefer to keep my subconscious mind
  to myself. However, there was no escape; so I seated myself and proceeded to
  carry out Lilith's directions.</p>

  <p>For nearly half a minute the bead hung quite motionless from my steady
  hand. Then it began almost imperceptibly to oscillate. My eye had already
  taken in the positions of the letters which might be incriminating, and now I
  observed with uneasy surprise that the faint oscillations of the pendulum
  were taking a direction towards the letter J. I could detect no movement in
  my hand, but, nevertheless, the oscillations grew wider and wider until the
  bead, as if possessed by a private demon, swung briskly half-way across the
  circle.</p>

  <p>"That is pretty definite," said Lilith. "It is swinging towards U&mdash;or
  is it J? The circle ought to have been bigger, so that the letters need not
  have been opposite to one another. But I'll write down both; U or J."</p>

  <p>The swing of the pendulum now began to shorten; and then, almost abruptly,
  it changed its direction to one at right angles, and I observed with
  astonishment that it was pointing direct to A.</p>

  <p>"It's either A or P," said Lilith. "I'll put them both down."</p>

  <p>Once again the pendulum changed the direction of its swing, and Lilith
  noted down E or S; and so, to my growing consternation, it continued to take
  up quite distinct changes of direction until six variations had occurred,
  when the pendulum became stationary and then began to swing round in a
  circle.</p>

  <p>"It has finished," said Lilith&mdash;whereupon I instantly dropped the
  pendulum. "It is a word of six letters: U or J, A or P, E or S, A or P, E or
  S, F or R. Let us see if we can make out what the word is. It is a pity the
  letters were opposite; it muddles it up so. They ought to be in a
  half-circle, but then they would be too close. But let us try a few
  combinations. U P E A S F; it can't be that. U P S A S F; it can't be that.
  We'll try it with J&mdash;J A E P E F; that isn't it. J A S B S F; that can't
  be the word. Do the letters suggest anything to you, Sibyl? Is there any name
  that might be lurking in your subconscious mind, beginning with U or J? Try
  to think. What did you do in town yesterday?</p>

  <p>"Oh, various things. I went to the dealer, of course; and then I went to a
  private show of pottery and antiques."</p>

  <p>"Pottery," mused Lilith, scanning the letters that she had written down.
  "Let me see: Upchurch? No, that won't do." She looked the letters through
  again and then asked eagerly: "There wasn't any Wedgwood there, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>Now it happened that while Mr. Hawkesley was talking to us I had noticed
  an old gentleman tenderly placing a very fine green Wedgwood cup and saucer
  in the show case. So I could, and did, answer truthfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there was; a beautiful green Jasper-ware cup and saucer."</p>

  <p>"There!" Lilith exclaimed triumphantly. "Jasper! That is the word! And yet
  I don't suppose you have given that cup and saucer a thought since you saw
  it."</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten its existence until you spoke of Wedgwood."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Lilith. "And that is the mysterious peculiarity of the
  subconscious. You see a thing or a person perhaps only for a moment, and
  straightway forget it. It seems to be gone for ever. But it is not. It has
  sunk into the subconscious, to remain there unnoticed possibly for years
  until some chance association, or perhaps a dream, brings it to the surface.
  But all the time it has been there. And at any moment it can be brought into
  view by the use of some kind of autoscope such as the pendulum or the
  crystal."</p>

  <p>"The crystal is an autoscope, too, is it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes; but of quite a different kind. The pendulum acts by the effects of
  the subconscious mind upon the muscles; the crystal by the effects of the
  subconscious mind on the centres of visual perception."</p>

  <p>"That sounds very learned; but tell me exactly what you do with the
  crystal."</p>

  <p>"As to me, personally," replied Lilith, "I do very little with it. Crystal
  vision&mdash;or 'scrying,' to use the technical term&mdash;is a rather rare
  faculty. I am a very poor scryer. But in the case of a really gifted
  observer, the most astonishing results are obtained. The method of using the
  instrument is this: The scryer sits in a restful position with the crystal
  before her (all the best scryers, I think, are women) and gazes steadily at
  the bright lights in it, keeping the conscious mind in a passive
  state&mdash;thinking of nothing, in fact. After a time the lights in the
  crystal grow dim; a kind of cloud or mist seems to float before it, and in
  this cloud, and gradually taking its place, the picture or vision appears;
  sometimes dim and vague, but often quite clear and bright, like the little
  pictures that you see in a convex mirror or a silver ball."</p>

  <p>"And what is this picture? I mean what is its subject?</p>

  <p>"That varies. It may be a scene from the past that had been forgotten by
  the conscious memory, or something that never happened at all&mdash;just a
  jumble of bits of memory like a dream. Or it may be the picture of some event
  that is going to take place in the near future."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "how can an event which has not yet occurred be in your
  subconscious mind?"</p>

  <p>"I know," said Lilith. "The whole subject of pre-recognition is a very
  difficult one. But there seems to be no doubt that prophetic visions do
  really occur. And then there is clairvoyance&mdash;seeing across space and
  through obstacles. A really gifted scryer, by concentrating her thought on a
  particular person or place as she looks into the crystal, can see that person
  or place, no matter how great the distance may be; can see exactly what the
  person is doing or what is happening at the place."</p>

  <p>"Really!" I exclaimed. "That sounds like rather an undesirable faculty.
  Doesn't it strike you, Lilith, as a very great intrusion on the privacy and
  liberty of the subject to scry a person without his or her consent? Supposing
  the scryer should happen to discover the scryed one in the act of taking
  her&mdash;or his&mdash;morning tub. Wouldn't it be rather a liberty?"</p>

  <p>Lilith laughed (but I could see that the idea was new to her): "You are
  dreadfully matter-of-fact, Sibyl. But, of course, you are quite right. We
  shouldn't misuse our powers. As for me, I have very little power of the kind
  to misuse, for I have never seen anything more than a sort of vague picture
  of unrecognisable figures in undistinguishable surroundings. But I think you
  might do better, for I am still convinced that you have special gifts. Would
  you like to try the crystal, Sibyl?</p>

  <p>"Not now, thank you, Lilith. We ought to get to work after all this
  gossip. And that reminds me that, before you came up, I was looking at your
  exquisite paintings and wondering if you are not, to some extent, wasting
  your great talents."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course," I said, "these designs would make magnificent tapestries or
  wall decorations. But if you can't get a wall, you might condescend to a
  smaller surface. Have you ever tried designing and painting a fan?"</p>

  <p>"No," she replied.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would," said I. "You would do it splendidly with your power of
  design and your delicate technique. And Phillibar could make the sticks and
  carve the guards, or I could do you a pair in silver repouss, and a jewelled
  pin and loop. Will you think over the proposal?"</p>

  <p>Lilith picked up the crystal on its cushion and, smiling at me, said:</p>

  <p>"I will make a bargain with you. If you will take the crystal to your room
  and give it a thorough trial whenever you have time, I will get out a design
  for a fan. Do you agree?"</p>

  <p>I held out my hand for the crystal. Primarily, my desire was to introduce
  Lilith to Fame and Fortune through the medium of the Magpies Club; but the
  startling success of the magic pendulum had aroused my curiosity in regard to
  the other "autoscope," though I have to confess that, when I had borne it to
  my room, I concealed it guiltily in a locked drawer, where it should be
  secure from the prying eyes of the servant-maid, and above all from the
  observation of the sarcastic and sceptical Titmouse.</p>

  <p>But there were other matters than crystals and magic pendulums to be
  thought of. There was, for instance, the set of twelve spoons which Mr.
  Campbell had asked me to make and to which he had again referred in his
  letter. I knew now that I should be paid for them at a reasonably
  remunerative rate, and this, and the congenial nature of the task, encouraged
  me to get to work. But before I could begin there was the motive of the
  design to be considered; and since the apostles were ruled out as obsolete, I
  had to find some other group of twelve related objects. After a whole day's
  anxious thought, I fixed upon the Signs of the Zodiac as furnishing a
  picturesque and manageable motive, and with this scheme in my mind, I fell to
  work in earnest, first with the pencil and then with the wax and metal.</p>

  <p>But busy as I was, and happy in the interest of my work, I was yet aware
  of a change, of a something new that had come into my life. From the little
  workshop which had been my world, I found my thoughts straying out into the
  larger world, and particularly that part of it which is adjacent to Temple
  Bar; and if at times I viewed this change with some misgivings, I was more
  often conscious of a sense of exhilaration such as one feels when embarking
  on some new adventure.</p>

  <p>In due course I received notice of my election as a member of the Magpies
  Club, and by the same post a letter from Mr. Davenant asking me to celebrate
  the event by lunching with him there; and, as I had occasion to go into town
  to replenish my silver and some other materials, I accepted his invitation,
  intending to return to Wellclose Square in the afternoon. But it appeared
  that a loan collection of antique silver was being exhibited at the South
  Kensington Museum, and that he had hoped to have the pleasure of inspecting
  it under my expert guidance. Now, to a craftsman (or crafts-woman) of small
  experience, there is no technical education to compare with the study of
  admitted masterpieces. I felt that strongly, and I felt that I needed that
  technical education; furthermore, I felt that the attempt to explain the
  merits of the old work to an attentive and sympathetic listener would help me
  to concentrate my own attention. And perhaps it did. At any rate, I spent a
  long and pleasant afternoon at the museum, and we subsequently discussed the
  exhibits (and various other matters) very companionably over the dinner table
  at the club.</p>

  <p>"It has been a jolly day for me, Mrs. Otway," said Mr. Davenant, as he
  wished me 'good-bye' at the Underground Station. "I've learned no end about
  silver&mdash;you are a perfect encyclopaedia of knowledge in regard to
  goldsmith's work. And the delightful thing to think of is that we've only
  scratched the surface of the museum. The place is inexhaustible. Do you think
  I may hope for the pleasure of another visit there with you before long?"</p>

  <p>I gave what I intended to be an ambiguous answer. But it was not ambiguous
  to me; and I suspect that Mr. Davenant went on his way with a feeling that a
  precedent had been created.</p>

  <p>When I arrived home, I found a letter awaiting me from Mr. Otway. It was
  not entirely unexpected, for I had felt pretty certain that he would
  presently hear further from his mysterious correspondent. It now appeared
  that he had received one or two short letters, ostensibly of the nature of
  warnings, but actually threatening, though in vague, indefinite terms, and
  one more recently of a more explicitly menacing character. These he wished me
  to see and discuss with him, and he asked me to make an appointment, at my
  convenience, to meet him for that purpose. I replied, suggesting, as before,
  the Tower Wharf; and there, a couple of evenings later, I met him.</p>

  <p>In appearance he had by no means improved. His pale face had a strained,
  wild expression, his eye-lids were puffy and covered with curious, minute
  wrinkles. His hands were markedly tremulous, and his fingers bore the deep
  stains that mark the inveterate cigarette smoker. His dress was noticeably
  less neat than it had used to be; indeed, he presented a distinctly shabby
  and neglected appearance. Oddly enough, too, he seemed to have grown somewhat
  stouter.</p>

  <p>I should have been less than human if these plain indications of sustained
  misery had awakened in me no feeling of pity. That his sufferings were the
  indirect result of his indifference to the happiness or misery of others,
  could not entirely stifle compassion, and I found myself speaking to him in a
  tone almost sympathetic.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, Mr. Otway," said I, "you are letting these nonsensical
  letters worry you quite unnecessarily. You are not looking at all well."</p>

  <p>"I am not at all well, Helen," he replied, dejectedly.</p>

  <p>"And I think you are smoking too much."</p>

  <p>"I am. And I am drinking too much&mdash;I, who have been a temperate man
  all my life. And I have to take drugs to get a decent night's rest. This
  worry is breaking me up."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come, Mr. Otway," I protested, "you mustn't give way in this manner.
  What is it all about, after all? Just a wretched blackmailer whom you know to
  be an impostor, whose threats you know to be mere empty vapourings."</p>

  <p>"That is not quite true, Helen. The man is an impostor, no doubt. He
  doesn't really know anything. There is nothing for him to know. But he could
  create a great deal of trouble. He could, in fact, cause
  the&mdash;ah&mdash;the inquiry to be re-opened and&mdash;ah&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And if it were re-opened? There would be unpleasant comment on
  the fact that a detail of the evidence had been withheld at the inquest. But
  that is the worst that could happen."</p>

  <p>Mr. Otway looked at me with a sort of dumb gratitude that was quite
  pathetic, but his gloom was in nowise dispelled by my optimism.</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you, Helen," said he, "to speak in this cheerful,
  confident tone. But I assure you, you minimize the danger. There is no saying
  what construction might be put upon the suppression of that detail; what
  considerations of motive might be read into it&mdash;especially as there was
  what they would call collusion between us to suppress it. But let me show you
  the last letter&mdash;the others are of no consequence."</p>

  <p>He produced his wallet, and, after some awkward fumbling, drew out the
  letter, which he held out to me with a hand that shook so that the paper
  rattled. Like the last, it was typewritten unskilfully, and characterized by
  the same semi-illiterate confusion in the wording, which ran thus:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lewis Otway,</p>

  <p>"The writer of this warns you once more to look out for trouble. The
  person that I spoke of knows that some thing was held back at the inquest at
  least they say so and that they know why your wife won't live with you and
  that she knows all about it too and that someone knows more than you think
  anybody knows. This is a friendly warning.</p>

  <p>"FROM A WELL WISHER."</p>

  <p>I returned the letter to Mr. Otway after reading it through twice, and I
  must confess that my confidence was somewhat shaken. If the writer was merely
  guessing, he seemed to have an uncanny aptitude for guessing right. As to his
  claim to possess some further knowledge, I did not see how that could be
  possible. When the fatal interview took place between my father and Mr.
  Otway, there were&mdash;to the best of my belief&mdash;only three persons in
  the house. Of those actually present at the interview there was only a single
  survivor&mdash;Mr. Otway himself&mdash;and he alone knew with certainty what
  occurred. The claim was therefore almost certainly false. And yet, even as I
  dismissed it, there crept into my mind once again a vague discomfort, a doubt
  whether there might not be something that I was unaware of, and that Mr.
  Otway knew; some dreadful secret that I, of all persons in the world, had
  been instrumental in guarding from discovery. And as I glanced at Mr.
  Otway&mdash;haggard, wild, trembling, and terrified out of all proportion to
  the danger, so far as it was known to me&mdash;the horrid doubts seemed to
  deepen into something like suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said he, when he had returned the letter to the wallet, "I
  realize that you are right; that there is nothing to be done but to wait for
  this person to show his hand more plainly. It would be madness to apply to
  the police. They would immediately ask if there had been any evidence
  withheld and why you were not living with me. And if they succeeded in
  getting hold of the writer of this letter, we should have more to fear from
  them than from the writer himself. He may be, as you believe, a mere
  blackmailer who is preparing to extort money, but if he were brought to bay
  he would try to justify his threats."</p>

  <p>With this I could not but agree. The implied allegations in this letter
  were, in point of fact, true; and any attempt to obtain help from the police
  would probably result in their truth being made manifest.</p>

  <p>"Have you no idea whatever," I asked, "who might be the writer of this
  letter? He can hardly be a complete stranger. Have you no suspicion? Can you
  think of no one who might have written it?"</p>

  <p>He looked at me furtively and cleared his throat once or twice before
  replying; and when he did answer, his manner was hesitating and even
  evasive.</p>

  <p>"Suspicions," he said, "are&mdash;er&mdash;not
  very&mdash;ah&mdash;helpful. I have no facts. The
  mere&mdash;ah&mdash;conjecture that this person or that might possibly be
  concerned&mdash;if a motive could be supplied&mdash;and&mdash;ah&mdash;if one
  can think of no motive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He left the sentence uncompleted, giving me the vague impression that he
  was reserving something that he did not wish to discuss.</p>

  <p>We were silent for some time, and I was beginning to consider bringing the
  interview to an end when he suddenly turned to me with a gesture of
  appeal.</p>

  <p>"Helen," he said earnestly, "is it not possible for me to prevail on you
  to&mdash;ah&mdash;to reconsider your decision
  and&mdash;ah&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;to terminate this&mdash;er&mdash;this
  unhappy separation. Consider my loneliness, Helen, my broken health and this
  trouble&mdash;which is our joint trouble&mdash;and&mdash;ah&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Otway," I answered, "it is not possible. I assure you it is not. I am
  deeply distressed to think of your unhappiness and to see you looking so ill,
  but I could not entertain what you suggest. You must remember that we are
  strangers. We have never been otherwise than separated. As we are, so we must
  continue."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that we must always remain apart?" he exclaimed. "It was
  only meant to be a temporary separation."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," I rejoined, "the time has not come to consider a change.
  But I shall be glad to hear how things go with you and to give you any help
  that I can."</p>

  <p>I rose and held out my hand, which he took reluctantly (though it was the
  first time that I had ever offered to shake hands with him).</p>

  <p>"I am driving you away, Helen," he said.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed," I replied. "I had to go. You will write to me if anything
  fresh happens?"</p>

  <p>He promised readily, and we turned and walked away in opposite directions.
  When I had gone a little way, I paused to look back at him; and as I noted
  his dejected droop and his air of something approaching physical decrepitude,
  I felt a pang&mdash;not of remorse, but of regret that I could not in some
  way lighten the burden of his evident misery. It is true that his unhappiness
  was of his own making, and that in wrecking his own life he had wrecked mine
  and my father's. But vindictiveness is a character alien to the civilized and
  developed mind. For what he had done I still loathed him; but it pained me to
  think of the haunting dread, the abiding fear that was his companion night
  and day.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-16"
     id="ch-2-16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE SWEATED ARTIST</h2>

  <p class="first">I HAD told Mr. Otway that I had to go; but I did not tell
  him why. If I had, he would probably have been considerably startled. For the
  fact is that while we were talking I had formed a resolution which had
  rapidly matured&mdash;the resolution to go to Dr. Thorndyke and make a clean
  breast of the whole affair. He had invited me to call on him and report from
  time to time, especially if I should be in need of advice or help, and I had
  been intending to write and propose a visit. Now, however, I decided to call
  on the chance of his being disengaged, and if he should be unable to see me,
  to make an appointment.</p>

  <p>From the Tower Wharf I made my way quickly to Mark Lane, noting as I
  entered the station that it was a quarter to six; and as the train rumbled
  westward I turned over the situation and decided on what I should say. That
  some trouble was brewing I had little doubt, and though I did not share Mr.
  Otway's alarm, I was more than a little uneasy. For, at the best, the
  re-opening of the inquiry into my father's death must entail a scandal and
  exhibit my conduct in a decidedly questionable light; and such a scandal
  would be a disaster. As a discredited witness, how could I face my comrades
  at Wellclose Square? And how should I stand with Jasper Davenant? These were
  unpleasant questions to reflect on. And underneath these reflections was the
  uneasy feeling that perhaps there was something more in Mr. Otway's fear than
  was known to me; something of which I had hardly dared to think.</p>

  <p>From the Temple Station I found my way without difficulty to Dr.
  Thorndyke's chambers at Number 5A, King's Bench Walk, and was relieved to
  find the outer oak door open and a small brass knocker on the inner one
  tacitly accepting the possibility of visitors. I plied it modestly, and was
  immediately confronted by Mr. Polton, whose countenance, at the sight of me,
  became covered with a net work of benevolent and amicable wrinkles.</p>

  <p>"The doctor is up in the laboratory looking over his apparatus, but I
  expect he has nearly finished. I'll go and tell him you are here. Have you
  had tea?"</p>

  <p>I had not and admitted the fact, whereupon Mr. Polton nodded meaningly,
  and having offered me an arm-chair, took his departure. In a minute or two
  Dr. Thorndyke entered the room and greeted me with a cordiality that put me
  at my ease instantly.</p>

  <p>"I have been wondering when you were coming to see me; in fact, I have
  seriously considered calling at Wellclose Square to see how you were getting
  on. Polton will bring you some tea in a moment, and then you must tell me all
  your news. I hope you are comfortable in your new home."</p>

  <p>"I am very happy, indeed, Dr. Thorndyke, and very grateful to you for
  finding me such a congenial home. And I have made quite a promising start in
  my new profession, too. But I have really come to ask your advice&mdash;and
  to make a confession."</p>

  <p>"A confession," said Dr. Thorndyke, looking at me gravely. "Is it
  necessary? and have you given it due consideration?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so. There is only one point. I should have told you this
  secret before, but as another person is involved in it, I felt that it would
  be a breach of confidence. But I now feel that my legal adviser should be
  told every thing."</p>

  <p>"That is so. Advice can only be based on known facts. And I may say that
  anything that you may tell me in my professional capacity is a privileged
  communication. A lawyer cannot be compelled to reveal anything that his
  client has told him, and is, in fact, forbidden to do so. You are, therefore,
  committing no breach of confidence in giving me any necessary
  information."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to know that, because, when I last spoke to you about my
  affairs, I held back something that you may consider important."</p>

  <p>"Something relating to the inquest?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Did you suspect that I had?"</p>

  <p>"I suspected that Mr. Otway was holding something back when he gave his
  evidence&mdash;but here is your tea, with all the little lady-like extras,
  just to show you what an old bachelor can do in the way of domestic miracles.
  I am ashamed of you, Polton. I call that embroidered tea-cloth sheer
  ostentation."</p>

  <p>Mr. Polton laid out the dainty service, beaming with satisfaction at the
  doctor's recognition of his efforts to maintain the credit of the
  establishment, and as he went out I heard him close the outer door.</p>

  <p>"Polton evidently smells a conference," commented Dr. Thorndyke. "The
  infallible way in which he always does the right thing without a word of
  instruction almost makes me believe in telepathy&mdash;which might be awkward
  if he were not as secret as an oyster. Now don't hurry, but tell me quietly
  what you want me to know."</p>

  <p>Thus encouraged, I gave him the suppressed facts relating to the loaded
  stick that I had seen in Mr. Otway's hand, and then told him about the
  mysterious letters. He listened very attentively, and seemed deeply
  interested, for he questioned me at some length about Mr. Otway's
  establishment at Maidstone, his mode of life and such of his antecedents as
  were known to me.</p>

  <p>"Is the stick in your possession or has Mr. Otway got it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I suppose he has it. At any rate, I have never seen it since that
  day."</p>

  <p>"And you know nothing of any of his associates, other than the
  housekeeper?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever."</p>

  <p>"Is Mrs. Gregg still with him?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so, but I am not sure."</p>

  <p>"And you know nothing of his present mode of life excepting that he lives
  in Lyon's Inn Chambers?"</p>

  <p>"No. I really know nothing about him."</p>

  <p>"It is very satisfactory for you," Dr. Thorndyke observed. "You are quite
  in the dark. These letters suggest an intention to extort money, but they may
  come from a personal enemy or from someone who has some design other than
  direct blackmail. And the question is, what cards does that person hold? Is
  he acting on a mere guess or has he any actual knowledge? The problem
  involves two questions: was there anyone in the house, that morning, besides
  you, your father and Mr. Otway? and did anything occur on that occasion
  beyond what Mr. Otway told you? The answer seems to be in the negative in
  both cases; but we cannot be certain on either point. Meanwhile, your
  position is very unpleasant, and Mr. Otway's still more so, for his
  apprehensions, though perhaps exaggerated, are not entirely groundless. He
  has behaved with consummate folly. Whether his account of the tragedy be true
  or false, if he had had the courage to give it in full at the inquest, it
  must have been accepted in the absence of contrary evidence. But that is by
  no means the case now. If the inquiry were re-opened, a jury would tend to
  regard his suppression of certain facts as evidence of the importance of
  those facts.</p>

  <p>"As to advice: there is nothing that you can do but try to forget these
  menacing letters. I will make a few cautious enquiries&mdash;though we have
  very little to go on; and you must let me know at once if there are any fresh
  developments."</p>

  <p>This ended the conference, but not the conversation, for Dr. Thorndyke
  insisted on a full account of my progress as a craftswoman, and even called
  down Mr. Polton to give an expert opinion on Mr. Campbell's prices; which
  opinion was to the effect that they were as good as could be expected.</p>

  <p>"So," said Dr. Thorndyke, as I rose to depart, "you have justified your
  rather bold choice of a profession. You have already made it an economic
  success, and with more experience on the commercial side, you will probably
  earn a very satisfactory livelihood."</p>

  <p>This was encouraging enough, backed as it was by Mr. Polton's practical
  experience. But with the other results of this conference I was much less
  satisfied. Indeed, my talk with Dr. Thorndyke, though it had relieved me of
  the burden of concealment, so far from setting my apprehensions at rest, had
  rather increased them. Not only was it evident that he regarded these
  mysterious letters as indications of a real danger, but he clearly
  entertained the possibility that Mr. Otway might have something more than I
  knew to conceal; in fact, I was by no means sure that he did not suspect Mr.
  Otway of having killed my father.</p>

  <p>Here, then, was abundant matter for reflection, and that none of the most
  pleasant; and during the next few days my mind was very full of these new
  complications, of this dark cloud which had arisen over my brightening
  horizon. Again and again I recalled in detail the incidents of that terrible
  morning when my dear father was snatched from me, but no new light, either on
  the tragedy itself or on these sinister echoes of it, came to me. I even
  tried Lilith's crystal&mdash;having first locked my door&mdash;but either my
  faith was weak or I lacked those special psychical gifts with which its owner
  credited me. I did, indeed, get as far as the cloud, or mist, of which Lilith
  had spoken; which gathered before my eyes and blotted out the crystal. But
  that was all. When the mist cleared away, no picture emerged from it, but
  only the crystal ball with the diminutive image of my own head reflected on
  its bright surface.</p>

  <p>But anxieties sit lightly on the young and healthy. As the days passed,
  the gloomy impressions faded and I became once more absorbed in my work. The
  Zodiac spoons were progressing apace, and were going to do me credit; and
  daily I became conscious of growing facility, of increasing skill, which not
  only lessened my labour but was itself a source of pleasure. To do a thing
  with ease is to do it with enjoyment; and, incidentally, added skill means
  added speed and greater earning power. Already I began to speculate on what
  Mr. Campbell's idea of "a good price" would turn out to be.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there were other distractions. Once or twice a week I looked in
  at the club, and these visits had a pleasant way of developing into impromptu
  jaunts&mdash;to picture galleries, exhibitions, museums, and even on one or
  two occasions a concert or a matine. Of the relations which were growing up
  between Jasper Davenant and me I did not care to think much. Perhaps the
  ostrich is a wiser bird than we are apt to imagine, for it does, at least,
  avoid the pains of anticipation. Sooner or later, no doubt, some
  understanding would have to be arrived at; but meanwhile Mr. Davenant was a
  delightful companion&mdash;gay, cheerful, buoyant, humorous, but withal a man
  of earnest purpose and a serious outlook on life. In all our junketings was
  little, real frivolity; the fun and gaiety were but the condiments to season
  the more solid and serious interests. In so far as a friendship between a
  young man and a young woman, which must necessarily stop at friendship, can
  be, our friendship was unexceptionable. But; of course, there was the
  qualification. However, as I have said, I let the future take care of itself
  and drifted pleasantly with the stream.</p>

  <p>About this time, I made quite a startling discovery. It happened that in
  one of my journeys to town I had seen in a bookseller's window a book on
  studio pottery, and, thinking that it might be useful to Miss Finch, I had
  bought it, but had forgotten to give it to her. In the middle of my morning's
  work I suddenly remembered the book, which I had put in a cupboard in the
  workshop, and got up from my bench to take it to her. Her "works" were at the
  bottom of the garden, in an outhouse which had once been a ship-smith's shop;
  but, close neighbours as we were, and close friends, too, I had only once
  been in her workshop, when, on an off day, she had shown me her wheel, her
  lathe and her small glass kiln. About her work she was extraordinarily
  secretive; but then, she was a reticent girl in general, so far as her own
  affairs were concerned, though she showed a warm interest in her friends, and
  was, indeed, very affectionate and lovable.</p>

  <p>As I came round the clump of bushes that hid her premises from the house,
  the silence and repose of the place gave me some qualms, and for a moment I
  hesitated to interrupt her work. However, I pocketed my scruples and rapped
  boldly on the door; whereupon the familiar voice at its highest
  pitch&mdash;several ledger lines above the stave&mdash;demanded who was
  there.</p>

  <p>"It is I, Peggy; Helen Otway," I replied apologetically. There was a pause
  of nearly half a minute, and then she unlocked and opened the door, looking
  rather embarrassed and very pink.</p>

  <p>"I always lock myself in when I am at work," she explained.</p>

  <p>"Well, Peggy, don't let me disturb you. I've only brought you a book that
  I got for you in town."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come in, Sibyl," said she. "Of course I don't mind you."</p>

  <p>She took the volume from me, and quickly turning over the pages and
  glancing at the illustrations, exclaimed, "What a ripping book! I shall enjoy
  reading it. And how sweet of you to think of getting it for me!" She linked
  her arm affectionately in mine and conducted me into her domain, passing
  through the outer room, which was devoted to plaster work &mdash;the making
  of moulds and "bats"&mdash;to the clay room, where the little gas engine and
  the mysterious wheel stood idle and a general tidying up appeared to have
  taken place. Here we stood chatting rather disjointedly, she still turning
  over the pages of the book with approving comments, and I looking about me
  with a craftsman's curiosity respecting the materials and appliances of an
  unfamiliar craft. And here I got my first surprise; for, on a side bench I
  noticed a collection of what were evidently bookbinder's tools. Was it
  possible that the secretive Titmouse was a bookbinder as well as a potter? I
  determined to inquire into this, but meanwhile my attention was attracted by
  the bench at which she had evidently been working, as suggested by the
  displaced stool. On this bench stood an object of some size&mdash;about
  twelve inches high&mdash;enveloped in a damp cloth. By its side were a
  spray-diffuser, a number of little spatulas and tiny modelling tools, and
  several little covered pots of a creamy, white earthenware delicately
  ornamented with floral decoration in a warm blue. Venturing to lift the cover
  of one, I found it to be filled with little rolls of brightly-tinted clay
  that looked like coloured crayons.</p>

  <p>"You are mighty fastidious about your apparatus," I remarked, picking up
  the dainty little pot and wiping some smears of clay from its surface.</p>

  <p>"And why not?" demanded Peggy. "Why shouldn't one have pretty things to
  work with? The old craftsmen did. I've seen some old planes and
  chisel-handles beautifully carved, and I am sure they did better work for
  having beautiful tools to work with. I would have pretty tools myself if I
  could make them."</p>

  <p>"You shall, Peggy," said I. "You shall show me what you want and I will
  make them for you."</p>

  <p>As I was speaking I absently turned the little pot upside down and glanced
  at the bottom. And then I really did get a shock. There was only a single
  spot of ornament on the base, but that spot was a revelation: for it was a
  little blue bird.</p>

  <p>I smothered the exclamation that rose to my lips and put the pot down on
  the bench. What could be the meaning of this? Had Peggy, like Mr. Hawkesley,
  been attracted by Mr. Goldstein's wares? Or was it possible&mdash;"Won't you
  show me what you were doing, Peggy?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She turned scarlet at the question, and looked so distressed that I felt
  it a cruelty to press her. But cruel or not, I meant to get to the bottom of
  the mystery.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather not, Sibyl, if you don't mind," she said, shyly.</p>

  <p>"But why? What an extraordinary little person you are."</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, doggedly, "if you must know, I am not allowed to show my
  work to anyone."</p>

  <p>"Not allowed by whom?"</p>

  <p>"By the dealer who takes all my work. For some reason, best known to
  himself, he makes a secret of it; won't allow anyone to know who makes
  it."</p>

  <p>"But apart from the dealer, Peggy, you wouldn't mind my seeing your
  work?</p>

  <p>"Of course I shouldn't. I should like you to see it. But a promise is a
  promise, you know."</p>

  <p>"Of course," I agreed; and then I stepped quickly up to the bench and very
  carefully picking up the damp cloth, lifted it clear of the object which it
  covered; which turned out to be a jar standing on a small turn-table. Peggy
  sprang forward with a gasp of consternation; but she was too late. The deed
  was done; moreover, the murder was out; for in the moment when my first
  glance fell on the jar, Mr. Hawkesley's "mystery ware" had ceased to be a
  mystery so far as I was concerned.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the jar was rather curious, but perfectly unmistakable.
  The clay, in its "green" state&mdash;unbaked and still somewhat
  plastic&mdash;was of a cool, grey colour, and the surface of the squat,
  octagonal body and the short neck and rim was covered with rich and intricate
  floral ornament, very minute, sharp and delicate. In the completed part this
  ornament was of dull blue and finished flush with the surface; in the
  unfinished part it was simply indented and had the appearance of what
  bookbinders call "blind tooling," but was somewhat deeper.</p>

  <p>From the work, my eyes turned with a sort of respectful wonder to the
  creator, who stood by my side with an air partly embarrassed, partly defiant.
  To me there was some thing very impressive in the thought that this
  unassuming, little lady was actually a master craftsman (I am compelled to
  use the masculine form, there being no feminine equivalent); the creator of
  masterpieces which would live in the great collections of the future for the
  admiration of generations yet unborn. And in the first shock of surprised
  admiration and pride in my friend's achievement I had nearly blurted out all
  that I knew. But reflection suggested a better plan.</p>

  <p>"My dear Peggy!" I exclaimed. "I never dreamed that you did work of this
  quality."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing very wonderful about it," she replied, regarding the jar
  with a kind of affectionate disparagement. "It is only a poor imitation of
  the beautiful Oiron ware. That pottery has always interested me; partly
  because it is so lovely, and partly because, according to tradition, it was
  made by a woman&mdash;Helene de Hangest-Gerilis. But my work isn't a patch of
  hers, and it isn't even as good as I could do."</p>

  <p>"How is that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, it ought to have more modelled ornament than I put on. It
  ought to be more important. Her pieces were most elaborately
  modelled&mdash;many of them had figures in the full round. But I can't afford
  to carry my work as far as that. It would take too long. Besides, I have to
  work to order, to some extent, and my orders are to keep to moderately,
  simple pieces."</p>

  <p>"Your orders! From the dealer, I suppose? Tell me about him, Peggy, and
  how it is that you are such a slave."</p>

  <p>"I'm not a slave," she retorted doggedly. "But I have a contract with a
  dealer. He takes the whole of my work, and he makes it a condition that I
  shan't sell anything to any one else or let anybody know what kind of work I
  do. I oughtn't to have let you in, but I know that I can trust you not to
  breathe a word to anyone of what you have seen here."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hawkesley was right, then; and I recalled with sympathetic
  vindictiveness his desire to wring the dealer's neck.</p>

  <p>"Concerning this contract, Peggy," said I. "You say the dealer has the
  right to the whole of your work. Did he pay you anything for this
  privilege?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He paid five pounds when the agreement was signed; but he deducted
  it from the payment for the first lot of pieces."</p>

  <p>"Then it was only payment on account, not payment for the exclusive right
  to all your work. And with regard to the prices, how are they fixed?</p>

  <p>"Oh, the dealer fixes the prices, of course. He knows more about it than I
  do."</p>

  <p>"Evidently. But what sort of prices does he fix?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, ordinary prices, I suppose. He will probably give me fifteen
  shillings for this jar."</p>

  <p>"And how long will it take you to make it?"</p>

  <p>"Let me see," she said, reflectively. "There is the throwing and turning;
  that doesn't take very long. Then this one had to be shaped after it was
  turned. Then there comes the decorating; of course that is what takes the
  time. Including the cover, I should say there is nearly a week's work in that
  jar. And then it has to be fired and glazed; but the firing and glazing are
  done in batches."</p>

  <p>"And all this for fifteen shillings a week!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Say a pound," said she. "That is about what I earn. It isn't much, is it?
  But I have a little money of my own, though I spent most of it on fitting up
  the workshop."</p>

  <p>"And what period does this precious contract cover? When does it
  expire?</p>

  <p>"Expire?" she repeated, a little sheepishly. "I don't know that it expires
  at all. No period is mentioned in it."</p>

  <p>"Peggy," I said, solemnly; "you should alter your potter's mark. Take out
  the little, blue finch and put in a little, green goose. But, seriously, we
  must see into this. I am a lawyer's daughter&mdash;not that I profess to have
  inherited a knowledge of law. But I am certain that this agreement is not
  binding. Will you let me show it to a friend of mine who is a lawyer? In
  strict confidence, of course."</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you like, Sibyl. But I don't see that it matters. I like doing
  the work and I do make a living by it. What more would you have?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you said you would like to do something more
  ambitious&mdash;the very best work of which you are capable. Wouldn't
  you?"</p>

  <p>She was silent for a while, and a far-away, wistful look stole into her
  face. Suddenly she said: "Sibyl, I'm going to show you something; but you
  mustn't tell anyone." She led me to a large cupboard, the door of which she
  unlocked and threw open. On the single shelf was a model in red wax of a tall
  candlestick or lamp-holder of the most elaborate design, the shaft and
  capital-like socket enriched&mdash;though sparingly&mdash;with fine relief
  decoration, and the base occupied by a spirited and graceful group of
  figures, beautifully modelled and full of life and expression.</p>

  <p>"That," she said, "is to be my chef d'art&mdash;though it doesn't look
  much in the wax. You must think of it in ivory-white, with a rich coloured
  inlay and perhaps some under-glaze painting. It has taken me months, doing a
  bit whenever I have had time, or when I couldn't resist the temptation to go
  on with it. Now it is finished, as far as the modelling goes, and the next
  thing will be to mould it. But I shan't actually make the piece at present,
  because I don't mean him to have it&mdash;the dealer, you know. If I finished
  it now, it would be his, of course."</p>

  <p>"Yes, by the contract it would. And it mustn't. This piece ought to give
  you a position in the front rank of artist potters. But I mustn't waste any
  more of your time. You will let me have that agreement, won't you?"</p>

  <p>She promised that I should have it at lunch-time, and with this I went
  back to my workshop to consider a plan that had come into my mind for her
  enlightenment and emancipation. But it turned out that there was no need for
  scheming on my part, for chance or Providence offered me the opportunity
  ready-made. That very evening I received a short note from Mr. Davenant
  informing me that Miss Tallboy-Smith had acquired a collection of English and
  French soft porcelain, and that she proposed to exhibit the whole of her new
  acquisition for a week at the club.</p>

  <p>"She rather wants," he said, "to make the opening day something of a
  function, and has asked Hawkesley and me to be there to lunch. Can you come,
  too? It would please her if you could&mdash;and you know how delighted
  Hawkesley and I would be. Besides, I think it will really be a very
  interesting show."</p>

  <p>Here was the very chance that I wanted. Forthwith, I swooped down on the
  unsuspecting Titmouse and secured her agreement to bear me company to a
  "pottery show," without giving too many particulars. Then I wrote to Mr.
  Davenant telling him that I was bringing a guest who was deeply interested in
  pottery and porcelain, and suggesting that we might form a party of four at a
  small table.</p>

  <p>By the same post I sent off Peggy's agreement to Dr. Thorndyke, with the
  request that he would tell me whether it was or was not legally binding. And,
  having thus laid the train, as I hoped, for the discomfiture of Mr.
  Goldstein, I felt at liberty to return to my own affairs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-17"
     id="ch-2-17"></a>XVII.&mdash; THE APOTHEOSIS OF THE TITMOUSE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE respective merits of hard and soft porcelain have been,
  from time to time, warmly debated by collectors and experts, but never,
  perhaps, have they been more earnestly discussed than on the occasion of the
  opening of Miss Tallboy-Smith's exhibition. During the half-hour which
  preceded lunch, the central glass case and the additional show-cases which
  had been set up for the occasion were surrounded by groups of eager
  connoisseurs, and the contrasting virtues of the pate tendre and the more
  durable, if less beautiful, true porcelain were once more considered and
  expounded.</p>

  <p>The attendance of the members and their friends must have been highly
  gratifying to Miss Tallboy-Smith, though it was no greater than was warranted
  by the importance of the exhibition; for the collection included
  representative pieces, not only of Chelsea, Bow, Nantgarw, Pinxton, and other
  English ware; but also of the old, French soft paste porcelain, including
  several early examples of Sevres. The preliminary glance at the collection
  had furnished material for conversation, as I could see by observing the
  occupants of the long central table, at the head of which sat the beaming
  hostess, supported by Major Dewham-Brown (who talked little, but consumed his
  food with intense concentration of purpose); and even our own small table,
  tucked away inconspicuously in a corner, was not immune from the influence of
  soft porcelain, for Mr. Hawkesley and my guest discussed the topic with a
  wealth of knowledge that reduced Mr. Davenant and me to respectful and
  attentive silence.</p>

  <p>Our two friends were evidently very pleased with one another; and not
  without reason. For Mr. Hawkesley was much more than a mere collector; he was
  an enthusiastic and learned student of all kinds of ceramic work; while, as
  to my friend Peggy, her conversation revealed a familiarity with all kinds of
  materials and processes that made me feel quite shy as I thought of the
  artless handbook with which I had presented her.</p>

  <p>But, indeed, Miss Peggy was quite transfigured. She had met with a kindred
  spirit. And under the influence of contagious enthusiasm, the usually silent
  and secretive Titmouse blossomed out in a manner that surprised me. As I
  listened to the animated duet of her chirping treble with Mr. Hawkesley's
  robust baritone, I found it difficult to identify her with the quiet little
  potter who was wont to work behind locked doors in the old shipsmith's shop
  at Wellclose Square.</p>

  <p>After lunch the siege of the showcases began again on a more portentous
  scale. Glass cases were opened for more complete inspection of their
  contents, and pieces were even handed out to be handled, stroked and smelled
  at by the more infatuated devotees. As neither Mr. Davenant nor I could be
  included among the latter, we were satisfied by a comparatively brief
  inspection of the treasures, after which we retired to a sheltered seat to
  look on and talk.</p>

  <p>"Just look at those two china-maniacs!" exclaimed Mr. Davenant. "They are
  as thick as thieves already. And what is Miss Finch going to do with that
  bleu de roi vase? Is she going to kiss it? No; she has given it back to the
  Tallboy-Smith. Well, well; enthusiasm is a fine thing. By the way, she is a
  nice little lady, this friend of yours; pretty and picturesque, too, and
  uncommonly well turned out. I'm beginning to have a new respect for Wellclose
  Square."</p>

  <p>I looked at the Titmouse with a sort of motherly pride (though she was
  about my own age). The word picturesque described her admirably with her warm
  colour, her graceful hair, and the trim, petite figure that was so well set
  off by the simple, artistic dress&mdash;in which I seemed to trace the hand
  of Lilith. She was my importation to the Magpies, and I felt that she was
  doing me credit.</p>

  <p>"I have often wondered," Mr. Davenant said, after a reflective pause,
  "what made you choose such an unlikely locality as Wellclose Square for a
  residence, and, indeed, how you came to know of its existence. Very few
  middle-class people do. I hope Miss Vardon will not consider me unduly
  inquisitive."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Otway will not," said I.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Otway is a myth&mdash;a legal fiction. I refuse to recognise her
  existence. She is a mere creature of documents, of church registers. The real
  person is Miss Helen Vardon."</p>

  <p>"That sounds rather like nonsense," said I, "but, of course, it can't be,
  because the speaker is Mr. Davenant. Perhaps there is some hidden meaning in
  these cryptic observations."</p>

  <p>"There isn't," he rejoined; "or, at any rate, it shan't remain hidden. I
  mean that I refuse to recognise your connection with this man, Otway, or to
  associate you with his beastly name."</p>

  <p>"But it is my beastly name, too, according to law and custom."</p>

  <p>"I don't care for law and custom," said he. "The name Otway is abhorrent
  to me, and it doesn't properly belong to you. I shall call you Miss Vardon,
  unless you let me call you Helen; and I don't see why you shouldn't,
  considering that we are old and intimate friends."</p>

  <p>"It would undoubtedly have the support of a well-established precedent.
  There was a certain bishop who was called Peter because that was his name.
  That precedent would apply to Helen, but it certainly would not to Miss
  Vardon."</p>

  <p>"Then," he rejoined, "let us follow this excellent precedent. Let it be
  Helen. Is that agreed?</p>

  <p>"I don't seem to have much choice; for if 'Mrs. Otway' is a legal fiction,
  'Miss Vardon' is an illegal one."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't let us have any fictions at all. Let us adhere to the actual
  baptismal facts."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mr. Davenant."</p>

  <p>"But why 'Mr. Davenant'? My baptismal designation is Jasper.'</p>

  <p>"And a very pretty name, too," said I. "But the precedent does not apply
  in your case. You have not married Mr. Otway."</p>

  <p>"No, thank Heaven! If I had, there would be a case of petty treason. But
  neither have you, for that matter. You have only gone through a ridiculous
  ceremony which means nothing and signed a document which sets forth what is
  not true."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," I said, "that we are not adhering to our agreement to
  avoid fictions. My marriage, unfortunately, is perfectly real and valid in
  the eyes of the law."</p>

  <p>"The law!" he exclaimed, contemptuously. "Who cares for the law? Have we
  not the pronouncement of that illustrious legal luminary, Bumble C.J., that
  the law is a ass and a idiot? And, mark you, he was specially referring to
  matrimonial law. Now, who would base his actions and beliefs on the opinions
  of an ass and a idiot?</p>

  <p>"And to think," said I, "that you have abandoned the law for mere
  architecture! With your gift for casuistry, you ought to have been a Chancery
  lawyer or else a Jesuit. But here is Miss Tallboy-Smith. She thinks we are
  neglecting her treasures."</p>

  <p>But our hostess had not come to utter reproaches. On the contrary, she was
  brimming over with pleasure and gratitude.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mrs. Otway," she exclaimed, beaming on me and grasping my hands
  affectionately, "I can't thank you enough for bringing that dear young lady,
  Miss Finch, to see my porcelain. She is a sweet girl, and she simply knows
  everything about china. It is perfectly wonderful. She might be a potter
  herself. And her love of the beautiful things and her enjoyment in looking at
  them has given me, I can't tell you how much, pleasure. You must really bring
  her to see my whole collection. Will you? I shall love showing it to
  her."</p>

  <p>I agreed joyfully, for this would mean another nail in the coffin of Mr.
  Goldstein; and as Peggy and Mr. Hawkesley joined us at this moment, I was
  able to complete the arrangement and fix a date.</p>

  <p>As Miss Tallboy-Smith bustled away, Mr. Hawkesley put in his claim.</p>

  <p>"I don't see," said he, "why I should be left out in the cold. I've got a
  collection, too; and I think it would really interest Miss Finch, for she
  tells me she has seen very little modern pottery. Won't you bring her to see
  it, Mrs. Otway?"</p>

  <p>Again I accepted gladly, with Peggy's consent. My scheme was working
  rapidly towards a successful conclusion, and I felt that I could push it
  forward energetically; for that very morning I had received a letter from Dr.
  Thorndyke returning the agreement and denouncing it as legally worthless and
  utterly opposed to public policy.</p>

  <p>"As to fixing a date," said Mr. Hawkesley, "I suggest that we all adjourn
  to my rooms now. Come and have a cup of tea with me and then we can look over
  the crockery. How will that do?"</p>

  <p>It suited Peggy and me quite well, and we said so.</p>

  <p>"And you, Davenant?" asked Mr. Hawkesley.</p>

  <p>"Well, I had one or two cathedrals to finish," was the reply; "but they
  must wait. Art is long&mdash;deuced long, in my case. Yes, let us adjourn and
  combine crockery and tea&mdash;which, as Pepys reminds us is a 'China drink,'
  and therefore appropriate to the occasion."</p>

  <p>On this, we sallied forth and made our way to the Strand, where we
  chartered a couple of hansoms to convey us to Dover Street, Piccadilly, where
  Mr. Hawkesley had his abode in one of those fine, spacious, dignified houses
  that one finds in the hinterland of the West End of London. His rooms were on
  the first floor, and when we arrived there by way of a staircase which would
  have allowed us to walk up four abreast, we were received by a sedate and
  impassive gentleman, whose appearance and manner suggested a Foreign Office
  official of superior rank.</p>

  <p>"Would you let us have some tea, please, Taplow?" said Mr. Hawkesley,
  addressing the official deferentially. Mr. Taplow opened a door for us, and
  having signified a disposition to accede to the request, departed
  stealthily.</p>

  <p>As we entered the large, lofty room, well lighted by its range of tall
  windows, I looked about me curiously, for I was instantly struck by the
  absence of pottery among its ornaments. The available wall-spaces were
  occupied by important pictures&mdash;all modern; the mantelpiece and other
  suitable surfaces supported statuettes of marble or bronze&mdash;again all
  modern. But of ceramic ware there was not a trace, with the single exception
  of a small framed cameo relief. Rather did the apartment suggest the abode of
  a furniture collector, for one side of the room, opposite the windows, was
  occupied by a range of armoires, or standing cupboards, mostly old French or
  Flemish.</p>

  <p>"You don't favour the glass case, I notice, Hawkesley," said Mr.
  Davenant.</p>

  <p>"No," was the reply. "They are well enough for public museums, but they
  are unlovely things. And one doesn't want to look at one's whole collection
  at once. I like to take the pieces out singly and enjoy them one at a time.
  You see, each piece is an individual work. It was the product of a separate
  creative effort, and ought to be enjoyed by a separate act of
  appreciation."</p>

  <p>"You seem, Mr. Hawkesley," said I, "to have a preference for modern work.
  Do you think it is as good as the old?"</p>

  <p>"I think," he replied, "that the best modern work is as good as any that
  was ever done. Of course, I am not speaking of commercial stuff. That is
  negligible in an artistic sense. I mean individual work, done under the same
  conditions and by the same class of men as the old craft work. That is quite
  good. The pity is that there is so little of it. But I am afraid the supply
  is equal to the demand."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think," said Mr. Davenant, "that that is partly the fault of
  the modern craftsman? Of his tendency to confine himself to fine and
  elaborate, and therefore costly, productions? Of course, the old work was not
  cheap in the modern factory sense of cheapness. The pottery and china that
  was made at the Etruria works or those of Bow or Chelsea was by no means
  given away. But the prices were practicable for every day purposes, whereas
  modern studio pottery is impossible for domestic use. And the same is true of
  other craftwork, such as book-binding, fine printing, textiles, metal work,
  and so on. If the modern craftsman caters only for the collector and ignores
  the utilitarian consumer, he can't complain at being ousted by commercial
  production."</p>

  <p>Here the arrival of Mr. Taplow with the tea arrested what threatened to
  prove a too-interesting discussion. I should have liked to continue
  it&mdash;on another occasion; at present, my desire was rather to "cut the
  cackle and get to the hosses." Accordingly, while the tea was being consumed,
  I rather studiously obstructed any revival of the debate by keeping up a
  conversation of a general and somewhat discursive character; and as soon as
  we appeared to have finished I introduced the subject of Ceramics.</p>

  <p>"Is that plaque on the wall a Wedgwood cameo?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," Mr. Hawkesley replied. "That is an example of Solon's wonderful
  pate-sur-pate work. It is done with white porcelain slip on a dark, coloured
  ground. Come and look at it."</p>

  <p>We all rose and gathered round the plaque while Mr. Hawkesley descanted on
  its beauties; which were, indeed, evident enough.</p>

  <p>"It is lovely work," said he; "so free and spontaneous. The Wedgwood
  reliefs look quite stiff and hard compared with these of Solon's. I have some
  of his vases with the same kind of decoration, and we may as well look at
  those first."</p>

  <p>He wheeled a travelling turn-table towards a fine Flemish armoire of
  carved oak, and opening the latter, displayed a range of pieces of this
  beautiful work, at the sight of which Peggy's eyes glistened. One after
  another they were carefully placed on the turn-table, viewed from all points,
  admired, discussed and replaced. The other contents of the armoire were less
  important works&mdash;mostly French&mdash;but all received respectful
  attention. The next receptacle, a French armoire of carved walnut, was
  devoted to modern stone-ware by the Martin Brothers, Wells and other
  individual workers, concerning which our host was specially enthusiastic.</p>

  <p>"There," said he, placing on the turn-table a wonderful Toby jug of brown
  Martin ware, "Show me any old salt-glaze ware that is equal to that! Look at
  the modelling! Look at the beautiful surface and the quality of the actual
  potting! And then go and look at the stuff in the shop windows. Just good
  enough for the slavey to smash."</p>

  <p>"Well," Mr. Davenant remarked, "you can't say that she doesn't appreciate
  its qualities and do justice to them. If former generations had been as
  energetic smashers as the present, collectors of old stuff would have had to
  seek their treasures in ancient rubbish-heaps."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is a fact," agreed Mr. Hawkesley, as we moved on to the next
  cupboard. "When domestic pottery was more valuable it got more respectful
  treatment. Now this cupboard is only partly filled. I keep it for the work of
  one artist whose name I don't know. I've shown you some of the ware, Mrs.
  Otway, but it may be new to Miss Finch."</p>

  <p>As he unlocked the door my heart began to thump, and I cast an anxious eye
  on Peggy. For I knew what was coming, but I didn't know how she would take
  it. At the moment she was looking at the closed door with pleased expectancy.
  Then the door swung open, and in a moment she turned pale as death. For one
  instant I thought she was going to faint, and so, apparently, did Mr.
  Davenant, for he made a quick movement towards her. But the deadly pallor
  passed, and was succeeded as rapidly by a crimson flush; but her quick
  breathing and the trembling of her hand showed how great the shock had
  been.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Hawkesley, all unconscious, was glancing over the row of
  vases, jars and bowls, and expatiating on the peculiar beauties of the
  "mystery ware." The pieces were separated into two groups; the works in pure
  inlay and those combining the inlay with slip decoration and embossed
  ornament; and one of the latter he presently lifted from its shelf and placed
  on the turn-table.</p>

  <p>"Now, isn't that a lovely jar, Miss Finch?" said he. "And doesn't it
  remind you of the beautiful St. Porchaire, or Oiron ware?"</p>

  <p>Peggy gazed at the jar with an inscrutable expression as she slowly
  rotated the turn-table. "It is somewhat like," she agreed; "at least, the
  method of work is similar."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't give my favourites the cold shoulder, Miss Finch," said Mr.
  Hawkesley. "I think I prize my pieces of this ware more than anything that I
  have. It is so very charming and so interesting. For, you see, it is real
  pottery; I mean that, beautiful and precious as it is, it is quite
  serviceable for domestic purposes, whereas much of the studio pottery is made
  for the gallery or the cabinet."</p>

  <p>"You haven't discovered yet where it is made, I suppose?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "Its origin is still a mystery and something of a
  romance&mdash;which may be one reason why I am so devoted to it. I often
  speculate about the potter, and invent all sorts of queer theories about
  him."</p>

  <p>"As for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sometimes I fancy that he may be in debt to this dealer&mdash;that
  he may have had advances or loans and be unable to pay them off and get free.
  It is quite possible, you know. Then, sometimes I have thought that he may be
  one of those poor creatures who drink or take drugs, and that the dealer may
  keep him slaving in some cellar for his bare maintenance and his miserable
  luxuries. But I've given that idea up. This work is too sane and reasonable
  and painstaking for a drunkard or drug-taker. But, who ever and whatever he
  is, I wish I could find him out, and thank him for all the pleasure that he
  has given me, and help him to get a proper reward for his labour, which I am
  sure he does not."</p>

  <p>"I don't know why you are so sure," said Mr. Davenant. "This ware is
  pretty expensive, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Not if you consider that each piece is an individual work on which a
  great deal of time and labour has been expended. The price that I paid
  Goldstein for this particular piece was seven guineas, which wouldn't
  represent very high remuneration if the artist had the whole of it."</p>

  <p>"Seven guineas, Mr. Hawkesley!" exclaimed Peggy, incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss Finch; and I should say very cheap at the price."</p>

  <p>I glanced at Peggy with malicious satisfaction, for her cheeks were aflame
  with anger and the light of battle was in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What a shame!" she protested. "How perfectly scandalous! The grasping,
  avaricious wretch! To charge seven guineas for a piece that he bought for
  fifteen shillings!"</p>

  <p>For a few seconds there was an awesome silence. Peggy's exclamation had
  fallen like a thunderbolt, and the two men gazed at her in speechless
  astonishment; while she, poor Titmouse, stood, covered with blushes and
  confusion, looking as if she had been convicted of pocketing the spoons.</p>

  <p>"You actually know," Mr. Hawkesley said, at length, "that Goldstein gave
  only fifteen shillings for that jar?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she stammered faintly, "I&mdash;I happen to have&mdash;to be
  aware&mdash;that &mdash;that was the amount paid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off with an appealing glance at me, and I proceeded to "put in
  my oar."</p>

  <p>"It's no use, Peggy. The cat is out of the bag&mdash;at least her head is,
  and we may as well let out the rest of her. The fact is, Mr. Hawkesley, that
  this ware is Miss Finch's own work."</p>

  <p>I now thought that Mr. Hawkesley was going to faint. Never have I seen a
  man look so astonished. He was thunderstruck.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean, Mrs. Otway," he exclaimed, "that Miss Finch actually makes
  this ware herself?"</p>

  <p>"I do. It is her work from beginning to end. She does the potting, the
  decorating, the firing and the glazing. And she does it without any
  assistance whatever."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hawkesley gazed at Peggy with such undissembled admiration and
  reverence that I was disposed to smile&mdash;though I liked him for his
  generous enthusiasm&mdash;and the unfortunate Titmouse was reduced to an
  agony of shyness.</p>

  <p>"This is a red letter day for me, Miss Finch," said he. "It has been my
  dearest wish to meet the creator of that pottery that I admire so intensely;
  and now that wish is gratified, it is an extra pleasure to find the artist so
  much beyond&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused to avoid the inevitable compliment, and Mr. Davenant held up a
  warning finger.</p>

  <p>"Now, Hawkesley," said he; "be careful."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Mr. Hawkesley. "It is difficult to steer clear of banal
  compliments and yet to say what one would like to say; but really the
  personality of the mysterious artist has furnished a very pleasant
  surprise."</p>

  <p>"I can believe that," said Mr. Davenant. "I can imagine, for instance,
  that you find Miss Finch a very agreeable substitute for the intoxicated
  gentleman in the cellar."</p>

  <p>At this we all laughed, which cleared the air and put us at our ease.</p>

  <p>"But," said Mr. Davenant, "proud as we are to have made the acquaintance
  of a distinguished potter, we are haunted by the spectre of that fifteen
  shillings. We get the impression that Miss Finch's business arrangements want
  looking into."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Mr. Hawkesley, "they do indeed. Why do you let this fellow
  have your work, at such ridiculous prices, too?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't so ridiculous as it looks," replied Peggy. "When I began, I
  couldn't sell any of my work at all. It was frightfully discouraging. No one
  would have any thing to do with it. My first work was simple earthenware, and
  even the cheap china shops wouldn't have it. Then I chanced upon Mr.
  Goldstein, and he bought one or two simple, red earthenware jars and bowls
  for a few pence each. It didn't pay me, but still it was a start. Then I
  experimented on this pipe-clay body with slip decoration and coloured inlay
  and showed the pieces to Mr. Goldstein; and he advised me to go on and
  offered to take the whole of my work, if I signed an agreement. So I signed
  the agreement, and he has had all my work ever since."</p>

  <p>"At his own prices?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I didn't know what the things were worth."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Davenant, "my law is a trifle rusty, but I should say
  that that agreement would not hold water."</p>

  <p>"It won't," said I. "We have just had counsel's opinion on it, and our
  adviser assures us that it is worthless, and that we can disregard it."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Mr. Davenant, "you had better formally denounce it at
  once."</p>

  <p>"Why trouble to denounce it?" demanded Mr. Hawkesley. "Much better let me
  call on Goldstein and make him tear up the duplicate. He has got a fine,
  handy warming-pan hanging up in his shop. I saw it only this morning."</p>

  <p>"The connection is not very clear to me," said I.</p>

  <p>"It would be clear enough to him," was the grim reply.</p>

  <p>Mr. Davenant chuckled. "Your methods, Hawkesley, appeal to me strongly, I
  must admit; but they are not politic. Legal process is better than a
  warming-pan, even if it were filled with hot coals. Let us hand the agreement
  to a reputable solicitor, and let him write to Goldstein stating the
  position. Miss Finch won't hear any more of her benefactor after that."</p>

  <p>After some discussion, in which I supported Mr. Hawkesley's proposal, the
  less picturesque method of procedure was adopted, and Mr. Davenant was
  commissioned to carry it out.</p>

  <p>"And we will have a one woman show of Blue Bird Ware at the club," said
  Mr. Hawkesley. "I will take my whole collection there and exhibit it with a
  big label giving the artist's name in block capitals. The pottery collectors
  will just tumble over one another to get specimens of the work when the
  artist is known."</p>

  <p>The rest of Mr. Hawkesley's collection received but a perfunctory
  consideration. Even the gorgeous De Morgan earthenware, glowing with the hues
  of the rainbow, came as something of an anti-climax; and we closed the last
  of the cabinets with almost an air of relief.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Mr. Hawkesley, as he pocketed his keys, "I suggest that we
  mark this joyful occasion by a modest festival&mdash;say, a homely little
  dinner at the club and an evening at the play. Who seconds my proposal?"</p>

  <p>"We shall have to go as we are then," said I, "as we can't change."</p>

  <p>"I think we can enjoy ourselves in morning dress," he rejoined; "and as we
  shall all be in the same shocking condition, we can keep one another in
  countenance."</p>

  <p>The proposal was accordingly adopted with acclamation and carried into
  effect with triumphant success, and some slight disturbance of the orderly
  routine of the establishment in Wellclose Square; for it was on the stroke of
  midnight when Miss Polton, blinking owlishly, opened the green door to admit
  the two roisterers who had just emerged from a hansom-cab.</p>

  <p>"It has been a jolly day!" Peggy exclaimed fervently as we said
  'good-night' on our landing. "And it will be a jolly to-morrow, too."</p>

  <p>"Yes; you will be able to get on with your masterpiece now; and when it is
  finished we can show it at the club and you will be able to sell it for a
  small fortune."</p>

  <p>"I shan't want to sell it," she said. "If it is good enough, and if it
  wouldn't seem too forward or improper, I should like to give it to Mr.
  Hawkesley&mdash;as a sort of thank-offering, you know."</p>

  <p>"Thank-offering for what?"</p>

  <p>"For his appreciation of my work. I really feel very grateful to him, as
  well as to you, Sibyl, dear. You see, he not only liked the things, but he
  thought of the worker who made them. All the time that I was working alone,
  with the door locked, from morning to night to fill that cormorant's pockets,
  Mr. Hawkesley was thinking of me, the unknown worker, looking for me and
  wanting to help me. I don't forget that it is you who have got me out of Mr.
  Goldstein's clutches. But I do feel very, very grateful to Mr. Hawkesley.
  Don't you think it is quite natural that I should, Sibyl?"</p>

  <p>"I think you are a little, green goose," said I, and kissed her; and so
  ended the day that saw the end of her servitude and the dawn of prosperity
  and success.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-18"
     id="ch-2-18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; AMONG THE BREAKERS</h2>

  <p class="first">My preoccupation with Peggy Finch's affairs had to some
  extent submerged my own, but now that my little friend had triumphantly
  emerged from the house of Bondage, I returned to my labours with a new zest.
  In spite of the various interruptions, the Zodiac spoons had made steady
  progress, and it was but a few days after our momentous visit to Mr.
  Hawkesley's rooms that, almost regretfully, I put the finishing touches to
  the Fishes spoon&mdash;the last of the set.</p>

  <p>It had been a pleasant labour, and as I laid out the completed set, I was
  not dissatisfied. True, there had been difficulties; but difficulties are the
  salt of craftsmanship. Some of the signs, such as Aries, Taurus, Leo, Virgo
  and Capricornus, had been quite simple, the head of the Ram, the Bull, or
  other symbolic creature furnishing an obvious and appropriate knop for the
  spoon. But others, such as Gemini, Pisces, and especially Libra, had been
  less easy to manage. Indeed, the last had involved a slight evasion; for,
  since it seemed quite impossible to work a pair of scales into a presentable
  knop, I had relegated them to the shoulder of the bowl and formed the knop of
  a more or less appropriate head of Justice blindfolded. So all the
  difficulties had been met by a pleasant and interesting exercise of thought
  and ingenuity, and the work&mdash;my magnum opus, for the present&mdash;was
  finished. And it was rounded off by a very agreeable little addition; for
  Phyllis Barton, who had seen and greatly admired the set, had made a
  delightful little case to contain it &mdash;just a pair of walnut slabs
  hinged together, the lower slab having twelve shaped recesses to hold the
  spoons and the lid ornamented with shallow carvings of a winged hour-glass
  and the phases of the moon.</p>

  <p>I made up the spoons into a parcel and the case into another, so that they
  should not be treated together in a single transaction; and having advised
  Mr. Campbell by a letter on the previous day, set forth one morning for
  Wardour Street. The silent willing which should have preceded my entry to the
  shop was inadvertently omitted, for as I crossed the street I observed Mr.
  Campbell exchanging blandishments with a large Persian cat of the "smoky"
  persuasion, and, as he saw me at the same moment, I had no choice but to
  enter straightway.</p>

  <p>He received me with the most encouraging affability&mdash;indeed, he even
  condescended to shake hands&mdash;and was evidently pleased to see me. And
  his reception of my work was still more encouraging. There was none of the
  buyer's proverbial disparagement. He was frankly enthusiastic. He held up
  each spoon separately at arm's length, wagging his head from side to side; he
  inspected it through a watchmaker's lens; he stroked it with a peculiarly
  flexible thumb, and finally laid it down with a grunt of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Then came the question of terms; and when he offered twenty-four guineas
  for the set, I was quite glad that the silent willing had been omitted. For I
  should probably have willed eighteen.</p>

  <p>Having settled the price of my own work, I produced the wooden case.
  Phyllis had priced it at half a guinea, which was ridiculous. I boldly
  demanded a guinea for it.</p>

  <p>"That's a long price," said Mr. Campbell, pulling a face; of proportionate
  length. But I watched his thumb travel ling over the clean-cut carving, I saw
  him delicately fitting the spoons, one by one, into their little niches, and
  I knew that that guinea was as good as in Phillibar's pocket.</p>

  <p>"It is a long price, Mrs. Otway," he repeated, cocking his head on one
  side at the case. "But it's a pretty bit of work; and it's the right
  thing&mdash;that's what I like about it. So suitable; it would be a sin to
  put those spoons into a velvet-lined case, as if they were common, stamped,
  trade-goods. Very well, Mrs. Otway, I'll spring a guinea for the case; and I
  should like to see some more work from the same hand."</p>

  <p>This was highly satisfactory (though it was not without a pang of
  bereavement that I saw the little case closed and hidden from my sight for
  ever in a locked drawer); and when I had received the two cheques&mdash;I
  asked for a separate one for Phyllis&mdash;I tripped away down Wardour Street
  as buoyantly as if I had not a care in the world.</p>

  <p>The association of ideas is a phenomenon that has received a good deal of
  attention. It was brought to my notice on this occasion when I found myself
  opposite St Anne's Church; for no sooner had my eye lighted on its quaint
  warty spire than my thoughts turned to Mr Davenant&mdash;or rather, I should
  say, to Jasper. Perhaps he was in my mind already; possibly in the
  subconscious, as Lilith would have said, and the church spire may have acted
  as an autoscope&mdash;it would not have had to be an exceptionally powerful
  one. At any rate, my thoughts turned to him and to the Magpies Club, and it
  was not unnatural that my steps should take a similar direction.</p>

  <p>As I followed the well-remembered route, I reflected on the changes that a
  few short months had brought. In that brief space a new life had opened. The
  solitary, friendless orphan who had sought sanctuary in Miss Polton's house,
  how changed was her condition! Happy in her work, in her home, in her
  friends; for had she not her Lilith, her Phyllis, her Peggy &mdash;and
  Jasper? And here a still, small voice asked softly but insistently a question
  that had of late intruded itself from time to time. Whither was I drifting?
  My friendship with Jasper was ripening apace. But ripening to what? There
  could be but one answer; and that answer only raised a further question. In
  normal circumstances the love of a man and a woman finds a permanent
  satisfaction in marriage. But where marriage is impossible love is a mere
  disaster; a voyage with nothing but rocks and breakers at the end.</p>

  <p>So whispered the still, small voice into ears but half attentive; and as I
  neared the bottom of Essex Street it became inaudible, for approaching the
  club-house from the opposite direction was Jasper himself.</p>

  <p>"Well!" he exclaimed, "this is a piece of luck! And yet I had hoped that
  you might be coming into town to-day. Is it business or pleasure?"</p>

  <p>"It has been business, and now I hope it is going to be pleasure. I am
  taking the rest of the day off."</p>

  <p>"Now, what a very singular coincidence! I am actually taking the rest of
  the day off myself."</p>

  <p>"Your coincidences," I remarked, "somehow remind me of the misadventures
  of the bread-and-butter fly; they always happen."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," he agreed. "But then, you see, if they didn't happen they
  wouldn't be coincidences. Do we begin by fortifying ourselves with
  nourishment?</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean by 'begin,' but I came here to get some
  lunch."</p>

  <p>"So did I&mdash;another coincidence, by the way. Shall we take our usual
  little table in the corner?"</p>

  <p>We seated ourselves at the table, and as we waited for our lunch to be
  brought, I ventured on a few inquiries into Jasper's professional
  affairs.</p>

  <p>"You seem to take a good many days off," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"I do. There is, so to speak, a distinctly marked 'off side' to my
  practice."</p>

  <p>"And when you are away, what happens? Do you keep a clerk?"</p>

  <p>Jasper grinned. "You over-estimate the magnitude of my practice. No; I
  have a simpler and more economical arrangement. I let my little front office
  to a law writer, at a peppercorn rent, subject to the condition that he shall
  interview my clients in my absence, furnish evasive answers to their
  questions, and supply ambiguous and confusing information."</p>

  <p>"But don't the clients get rather dissatisfied?"</p>

  <p>Again Jasper smiled. "That question," said he, "involves an important
  philosophic principle. A famous philosopher has proved his own existence by
  the formula 'cogito, ergo sum'&mdash;I think, therefore I am&mdash;implying
  that if he didn't exist he couldn't think. Now, that principle applies to my
  clients. Before they can be dissatisfied, they must exist. But they don't
  exist. Therefore they are not dissatisfied. Q.E.D."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you care whether they exist or not&mdash;but that is the
  worst of having an independent income."</p>

  <p>"It is a misfortune, isn't it? But I bear up under it surprisingly. Will
  you have some of this stuff? It is called a pelion. I heard the waitress
  describing it as a pea-lion, apparently misled by the analogy of the pea-cock
  and the pea-hen. Evidently she is no zoologist."</p>

  <p>At this moment Miss Tallboy-Smith entered the room and halted at our table
  to exchange greetings and remind me of my engagement.</p>

  <p>"Tell Miss Finch not to forget," said she. "It's next Wednesday. I shall
  have my things back from here by then, and I understand that Mr. Hawkesley
  has secured the cases for a special exhibition of studio pottery. You must
  bring Miss Finch to that, too."</p>

  <p>Like Jasper's proxy, I gave an evasive answer to this, for I knew that
  wild horses would not drag Peggy to an exhibition of her own work. But
  evidently Mr. Hawkesley had made no confidences so far.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen the Diploma Gallery at the R.A.?" Jasper asked when
  Miss Tallboy-Smith had flitted away. "If you haven't, we might look in there
  for an hour this afternoon."</p>

  <p>As I had never seen the diploma works, I fell in readily with the
  suggestion, and accordingly, when we had finished lunch, we strolled thither
  and spent a very pleasant hour examining and comparing the works of the
  different academicians, old and new. From Burlington House we drifted into
  the Green Park, and presently took possession of a couple of isolated and
  lonely-looking chairs. For some time we gossiped about the pictures at which
  we had been looking in the gallery; then our talk turned on to the affairs of
  my friend Peggy.</p>

  <p>"Hawkesley seems to have appointed himself Miss Finch's advertising
  agent," Jasper remarked. "And he'll do the job well. He is an energetic man,
  and he knows all the pottery connoisseurs. I met him yesterday, and had to
  listen to Blue Bird ware by the yard."</p>

  <p>"I like him for his enthusiasm," said I.</p>

  <p>"So do I," agreed Jasper. "And it is quite a little romance. His
  admiration of the pottery is perfectly genuine, as we know; but there is
  something in what he calls 'the personality of the artist.' I think he is
  distinctly 'taken' with your pretty little friend. How does she like
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I think she is decidedly prepossessed. At any rate, she is profoundly
  grateful to him for discovering her work, and especially for the interest
  that he took in the unknown worker."</p>

  <p>"There you are, then," said Jasper. "There are the ingredients of a
  life-size romance. Fervid admiration on the one side, gratitude on the other,
  and good looks and good nature on both. We shall see what we shall see,
  Helen; and I, for one, shall look on with the green eyes of envy."</p>

  <p>"Why will you? Do you want Peggy Finch for yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I want Hawkesley's good fortune. If he loves this little maid and thinks
  she cares for him, he can ask her to marry him. That is what makes me
  envious."</p>

  <p>I made no reply; indeed, there was nothing to say; and already the sound
  of the breakers was in my ears.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, Helen," he said, after a long pause, "you realize that I love
  you very dearly?"</p>

  <p>"I know that we are the best of friends, and very deeply attached to one
  another."</p>

  <p>"We are much more than friends, Helen," said he; "at least, there is much
  more than friendship on my side. You are my all&mdash;all that matters to me
  in the world. You live in my thoughts every moment of my life. When we are
  apart I yearn for the sight of you&mdash;I reckon the hours that must pass
  before I shall see you again, and when we are together the happy minutes slip
  away like grains of golden sand. But I need not tell you this. You must have
  seen that I love you."</p>

  <p>"I have feared it, Jasper&mdash;and that I might presently lose the
  dearest friend that I have in the world."</p>

  <p>"That you will never do, Helen, dearest, if I have the happiness to be
  that friend. Why should you?"</p>

  <p>"It seems that it has to be. Our friendship has been a sweet friendship to
  me&mdash;too sweet to last, as I feared; and if some might cavil at it, it
  was innocent and wronged no one. But if it has grown into&mdash;into what I
  had feared it might, then it has become impossible. More than friends we can
  never be, and yet we cannot remain friends."</p>

  <p>We were both silent for more than a minute, and both were very grave. Then
  Jasper asked, with a trace of hesitation: "Helen, if we were as those other
  two are&mdash;if you were free&mdash;would you be willing to marry me?"</p>

  <p>It was a difficult question to answer, in the circumstances and yet I felt
  it would be an unpardonable meanness to dissemble.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered; "of course I should."</p>

  <p>"Then," said he, "I don't see why we can never be more than friends."</p>

  <p>"But, Jasper, how can we? I am a married woman."</p>

  <p>"I don't admit that," said he. "Your marriage is a fiction. You are really
  a spinster with a technical impediment to the conventional form of marriage.
  Your so-called husband is a stranger to whom you have no ties. You don't
  like, or even respect him; and certainly you have no obligations of duty to
  him, seeing that he induced you by a mere fraudulent pretence to go through
  this form of marriage with him."</p>

  <p>"I am not thinking of Mr. Otway," said I. "He is nothing to me. I owe him
  no duty or consideration, and I would not sacrifice a single hair of my head
  for him. But the fact remains that I am, legally, his wife; and while he
  lives I can contract no other marriage."</p>

  <p>"But is that quite true, Helen?" he objected.</p>

  <p>"Certainly it is; unless you consider a bigamous marriage as an exception,
  which it is not."</p>

  <p>"Of course I do not. Bigamy is a futile and fraudulent attempt to secure
  the appearance of a legal sanction. No one but a fool entertains bigamy."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't see the meaning of your objection."</p>

  <p>"What I mean," said he, "is that a fictitious marriage does not exclude
  the possibility of a real marriage."</p>

  <p>"Still I do not quite follow you. What do you mean by a real
  marriage?"</p>

  <p>"A real marriage is a permanent, life-long partnership between a man and a
  woman. Ordinarily, such a partnership receives the formal endorsement of the
  State for certain reasons of public policy. But it is the partnership which
  is the marriage. The legal endorsement is an extrinsic and inessential
  addition. Now, in your case the State has accepted and endorsed a marriage
  which does not exist&mdash;which is a pure fiction. The result is that if you
  contract a real marriage, the State will withhold its endorsement. That is
  all. It cannot hinder the marriage."</p>

  <p>"This is all very ingenious, Jasper," said I, "and it does credit to your
  legal training. But it is mere sophistry. The position, as it would appear to
  a plain person of ordinary common sense, is that a woman who is legally
  married to one man and is living as the wife of another, is a married woman
  who is living with a man who is not her husband."</p>

  <p>"That is the conventional view, I admit," said he. "But it is a mistaken
  view. It confuses the legal sanction&mdash;which is not essential&mdash;with
  the covenant of life-long union, which is the essence of
  marriage&mdash;which, in fact, is the marriage."</p>

  <p>"But what is the bearing of this, Jasper?" I asked. "We seem to be
  discussing a rather abstract question of public morals. Has it any
  application to our own affairs?</p>

  <p>"Yes, it has. At least, I think so, though I feel a little nervous about
  saying just what I mean."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you need be. At any rate, there had better be a clear
  understanding between us. Tell me exactly what you do mean."</p>

  <p>He considered awhile, apparently somewhat at a loss how to begin. At
  length, with evident embarrassment, he put his proposal before me.</p>

  <p>"The position, Helen, is this: You and I have become deeply attached to
  one another; I may say&mdash;since you admit that you would be willing to
  marry me&mdash;that we love one another. It is no passing fancy, based on
  mere superficial attractions. We are both persons of character, and our love
  is founded on deep-seated sympathy. We have been friends for some years. We
  liked one another from the first, and as time has gone on we have liked one
  another better. Our friendship has grown. It has become more and more
  precious to both of us, and at last it has grow into love&mdash;on my side,
  into intense and passionate love.</p>

  <p>"We are not likely to change. People of our type are not given to change.
  We love one another and we shall go on loving one another until the end.</p>

  <p>"If our circumstances were normal, we should marry in the normal manner.
  That is to say, we should enter into contract publicly with certain
  formalities which would confer a definite legal status and render our
  contract enforceable in a court of law. But our circumstances are not normal.
  We are willing to comply with the formalities but we are not allowed to. We
  are not in the position of persons who, for their own purposes, lightly
  disregard the immemorial usages of society&mdash;who dispense with the
  formalities because they would avoid the responsibilities of formal marriage.
  We wish to enter into a lifelong partnership; we desire to undertake all
  responsibilities; we would welcome the formalities and the secure status. But
  the law refuses. There is a technical disability.</p>

  <p>"We have, therefore, two alternatives. We may give up the marriage which
  we both desire, or we may marry and dispense with the formalities and the
  legal status. Supposing we give up the marriage. Just consider, Helen what it
  is that we give up. It is the happiness of a whole life-time. The abiding joy
  of the sweetest, the most sympathetic, companionship that is possible to a
  man and a woman. For though we are lovers, we are still friends, and friends
  we shall remain until death parts us. Our tastes, our interests, our
  sympathies make us prefer one another as companions to all other human
  beings. Of how many married couples can this be said? To us has been given
  that perfect comradeship that makes married life an enduring delight, a state
  of happiness without a cloud or a blemish. And this is what we give up if we
  let this disability, this technical impediment, hinder us from marrying.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, supposing we marry and dispense with the formalities,
  what do we give up? Virtually nothing. The legal security is of no value to
  us, for each of us is secure in the constancy of the other. If we enter into
  a covenant, we shall abide by it, not by compulsion, but because we shall
  never wish to break it. As to the legal status and the social recognition, is
  it conceivable that two sane persons should give up a life's happiness for
  such trumpery? Surely it is not. No, Helen, let us boldly take our destiny
  into our own hands. Let us publicly denounce this sham marriage and cancel it
  for ever. I ask you, dearest, to give me the woman of my heart for my mate,
  my friend, my wife, for ever; to take me, unworthy as I am, for your husband,
  who will try, as long as he draws the breath of life, to make up to you by
  love and worship for what you have sacrificed to make him happy."</p>

  <p>As I listened to Jasper's appeal&mdash;delivered with quiet but impressive
  earnest&mdash;I think I was half disposed to yield. It was not only that I
  admired the skill with which he put his case and the virile, masterful way in
  which he trampled down the obstructing conventions; but deep down in my heart
  I felt that he was right&mdash;that his separation of the things that really
  mattered from those that were trivial and inessential was true and just. But
  there was this vital difference between us; that he was a man and I was a
  woman. Our estimates of the value of the conventions were not the same.
  Without the legal sanction I might be his wife in all that was real; but the
  world would call me his mistress.</p>

  <p>"Jasper, dear," I said, "it is impossible. I admit the truth of all that
  you have said, and I wish&mdash;Oh! Jasper, how I wish, that I could accept
  the happiness that you offer me! You need not tell me that our companionship
  would be a delight for ever. I know it. But it cannot be. Even if I could
  accept it for myself, I could not accept it for you; I could not bear to
  think that, through me, you had been put outside the pale of decent society.
  For that is what it would mean. You&mdash;a gentleman of honour and
  reputation&mdash;would become a social outcast, a man who was living with
  another man's wife; who, if he were admitted at all to the society of his own
  class, would have to be introduced with explanations and excuses."</p>

  <p>"I think you exaggerate the social consequences, Helen," said he. "I
  propose that we should write to Otway and formally repudiate the marriage.
  Then, if we were boldly, and openly to state our position and the exceptional
  circumstances that had driven us to it, I believe that we should receive
  sympathy rather than condemnation. I don't believe we should lose a friend;
  certainly not one whose loss would afflict us. And Otway could take his
  remedy, if he cared to."</p>

  <p>"You mean he could divorce me," I said, with something like a shudder.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I am afraid he wouldn't."</p>

  <p>"I don't think he would. But if he did, it would be an undefended suit,
  and the stigma of the Divorce Court would be on us for ever."</p>

  <p>"It would be unpleasant, I admit," he replied. "But think of the
  compensations. Think of the joy of being, together always, of having our own
  home, of going abroad and seeing the world together."</p>

  <p>"Don't, Jasper!" I entreated. "It is too tantalizing. And even all this
  would not compensate me for the knowledge that I had dragged you from your
  honourable estate to a condition of social infamy."</p>

  <p>"You need not consider me," he rejoined. "I have thought the matter out
  and am satisfied that I should gain infinitely more than I should lose; for I
  should have you, who are much more to me than all the rest of the world."</p>

  <p>"You haven't thought of everything, Jasper," said I. "You know of the
  folly I committed at the time of my father's death&mdash;in withholding facts
  at the inquest, I mean&mdash;and you have excused it and treated it lightly.
  But others would view it differently. And now there is this blackmailer of
  whom I have told you. At any moment, a serious scandal may arise; and in that
  scandal you would be implicated."</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't matter to me," said he. "Nothing would matter to me if only I
  had you."</p>

  <p>"So you think now. But, Jasper, think of the years to come. Think how it
  might be in those years when the social ostracism, the loss of position and
  reputation, had grown more and more irksome, if we should regret what we had
  done, if we should blame ourselves&mdash;even, perhaps, secretly blame one
  another&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We should never do that, Helen. We should always be loyal. And there
  wouldn't be any social ostracism. At any rate, I am quite clear as to my own
  position. I want you for my wife. To get you I would make any sacrifices and
  count them as nothing. But that is only my position. It isn't necessarily
  yours&mdash;or rather, I should say your sacrifices would be greater than
  mine. A woman's point of view is different from a man's."</p>

  <p>"It is, Jasper. I realise fully how essentially reasonable your proposal
  is, and I am proud of, and grateful for, the love that has impelled you to
  make it. But to me the thing is impossible. That is the only answer I can
  give. What it costs me to give that answer&mdash;to refuse the happiness that
  you offer me, and that I crave for&mdash;I cannot tell you. But even if it
  breaks my heart to say 'no,' still, that must be my answer."</p>

  <p>For a long time neither of us spoke. As I glanced furtively at Jasper, the
  dejection, the profound sadness that was written on his face wrung my heart
  and filled me with self-accusation. Why had I not foreseen this? Why had I,
  who had nothing to give in return, allowed his friendship to grow up into
  love under my eyes? Had I not acted towards this my dearest friend with the
  basest selfishness?</p>

  <p>Presently he turned to me, and, speaking in quiet, even tones, said:</p>

  <p>"It would not be fair for me to make an appeal on my own behalf. I may not
  urge you to accept a relation which your feeling and judgment reject. But one
  thing I will ask. I have told you what I want; and you are to remember that I
  shall always want you. I will ask you to reflect upon what we have said
  to-day, and if perchance you should come to think differently, remember that
  I am still wanting you, that I am still asking you, and tell me if you can
  give me a different answer. Will you promise me this, Helen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied, "I promise you, Jasper."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Helen. And meanwhile we remain friends as we have been?"</p>

  <p>"We can never be again as we have been," said I. "Friendship may turn to
  love, but love does not go back to friendship. That is as impossible as for
  the fruit to change back into blossom. No, dearest Jasper; this is the end of
  our friendship. When we part to-day it must be farewell."</p>

  <p>"Must it be, Helen? Must we part for ever? Could we not go back to the old
  ways and try to forget to-day?</p>

  <p>"I shall never forget to-day, nor will you. For our own peace of mind we
  must remain apart and try to avoid meeting one another. It is the only way,
  Jasper, hard as it will be."</p>

  <p>I think he agreed with me, for he made no further protest. "If you say it
  must be, Helen, then I suppose it must," he said, dejectedly. "But it is a
  hard saying. I don't dare to think of what life will be without you."</p>

  <p>"Nor I, Jasper. I know that when I say 'good-bye' to: you, the sun will go
  out of my life and that I can look for no other dawn."</p>

  <p>Again we fell silent for a while; and again I reproached myself for having
  let it come to this.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think, Helen," he said at length, "that we might meet
  sometimes, say at fixed intervals&mdash;even long, intervals, if it must be
  so&mdash;just that we might feel that we had not really lost one another
  completely?"</p>

  <p>"But that is what I should wish to avoid. For we have lost one another. As
  to me, it has no significance. I have nothing to give and nothing to lose. I
  am shackled for life to Mr. Otway. But you have your life before you, and it
  would only be fair that I should leave you free."</p>

  <p>"Free!" he exclaimed. "I am not free and never shall be. Nor do I wish to
  be free. I am yours now and for ever. And so I would wish it to be. We may
  not be married in any outward form, but we are married in the most real
  sense. Our hearts are married. We belong to one another for ever while we
  live, and neither of us will ever wish to change. You know it is so, dearest,
  don't you?"</p>

  <p>What could I say? He had spoken my own thoughts, had expressed the wish
  that I had not dared to acknowledge. Weak and unjust it may have been, but
  the thought that in the dark days of our coming separation we should still be
  linked, if only by an invisible thread, came as something like a reprieve. It
  left just a faint spark of light to relieve the gloom of the all too sombre
  future. In the end we agreed to a monthly letter and a meeting once a year.
  And so, having fixed the terms of our sentence, we tried to put our troubles
  away and make the best of the few hours that remained before the dreaded
  farewell.</p>

  <p>But despite our efforts to get back to our wonted cheerful companionship,
  the swiftly-passing hours were filled with sadness and heart-ache.
  Instinctively we went and looked at things and places that recalled the
  pleasant jaunts that were to be no more; but ever Black Care rode behind. It
  was like the journey of two lovers in a tumbril that rolled its relentless
  way towards the guillotine; for at the end of the day was the parting that
  would leave us desolate.</p>

  <p>And at last the parting was upon us. At the corner of Cable Street we
  halted and faced one another. For a few moments we stood in the gathering
  gloom, hand clasped in hand. I dared not speak, for my heart was bursting.
  Hardly did I dare to look at the man whom I loved so passionately. And Jasper
  could but press my hand and murmur huskily a few broken words of love. And so
  we parted. With a last pressure of the hand I turned away and hurried along
  Cable Street. I did not dare to look back, though I knew that he was gazing
  after me; for the street swam before my eyes and I could barely hold back my
  sobs.</p>

  <p>I did not go straight home. The tumult of emotion sent me hurrying
  forward&mdash;whither I have no recollection save that somewhere in Shadwell
  a pair of friendly policemen turned me back with the remark that it "was no
  place for the likes of me." At length, when the first storm of grief had
  passed, and I felt myself under control, I made my way to Wellclose Square,
  and pleading the conventional headache, retired at once to my room.</p>

  <p>And there, in quiet and seclusion, with tears that no longer need be
  restrained, with solemn rites of grief, I buried my newborn
  happiness&mdash;the happiness that had died almost in the moment of its
  birth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-19"
     id="ch-2-19"></a>XIX. &mdash; ILLUSIONS AND DISILLUSION</h2>

  <p class="first">IT is a generally accepted belief that of all the remedies
  for an aching heart, the most effective is distraction of the mind from the
  subject of its affliction. And probably the belief is well founded. But it
  usually happens that the sufferer is the last to recognize the virtues of the
  remedy, preferring to nurse in solitude a secret grief and to savour again
  and yet again the bitterness of the Dead Sea fruit of sorrow.</p>

  <p>So it was with me in these unhappy days. The seclusion of the workshop
  gave me the opportunity for long hours of meditation, in which I would trace
  and retrace the growth of my love for Jasper, would think with passionate
  regret of what might have been, and speculate vaguely upon the future. So far
  from seeking distraction in these first days of my trouble, I kept aloof from
  my comrades, so far as I could; shut myself in the workshop, or in my room,
  or wandered abroad alone, following the great eastern thoroughfares where I
  was secure from the chance of meeting a friend.</p>

  <p>But the distractions which I would have avoided came unsought. First,
  there was the visit with Peggy to Miss Tallboy. It was due but a day or two
  after my parting with Jasper, and I loathed the thought of it; but it had to
  be; for who could say how much it might mean to Peggy? And as it turned out,
  I should never have forgiven myself if I had failed her. I had looked for a
  rather dull, social call flavoured with porcelain. But it was quite
  otherwise. Miss Tallboy-Smith had at length heard of Peggy's genius and had
  invited a few specially choice connoisseurs to meet her, including Mr.
  Hawkesley&mdash;unless he had invited himself. At any rate, there he was,
  reverential and admiring, but yet with a certain air of proprietorship which
  I noted with interest and not without approval. It was quite a triumph for
  Peggy, and she took it very modestly, though with very natural satisfaction.
  To me, however, there was a fly in the ointment, though quite a small one;
  for Mr. Hawkesley proposed an exploration of the Wallace Collection, which
  Peggy had never seen, and which I felt bound, for her sake, to agree to. But
  I looked forward with prospective relief to the time&mdash;not far distant, I
  suspected&mdash;when these two pottery enthusiasts would be intimate enough
  to dispense with a chaperon.</p>

  <p>Then there came a distraction of another kind. One evening after tea,
  Lilith took me apart, and looking at me with some concern, said: "Our Sibyl
  has not been herself of late. I hope she is not being worried about
  anything."</p>

  <p>"We all have our little troubles, Lilith," I replied, "and sometimes we
  don't take them so resignedly as we should."</p>

  <p>"No," she rejoined. "Resignation is easier when the troubles are someone
  else's. But we are very concerned to see you looking so sad&mdash;not only
  Margaret and I, but all of us. We are all very fond of you, Sibyl, dear, and
  any of us would think it a privilege to be of help to you in any way. You
  know that, don't you?"'</p>

  <p>"I have good reason to. No woman could have found kinder or more helpful
  friends than I have in this house."</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "friends are for use as well as for companionship. Don't
  forget that, if there is any little service that any of us can render
  you."</p>

  <p>I thanked her very warmly, and she then opened a fresh topic.</p>

  <p>"Some time ago, Sibyl, we were speaking of psychical experiments, and I
  suggested that you might like to see some carried out by my friend, Mr.
  Quecks, who is an authority on these subjects. Mr. Quecks was away from home
  at the time, on a lecturing tour in Kent; but he is home again now. I wrote
  to him about you and have had one or two talks with him, and he has asked me
  to invite you to a little demonstration that he is giving to some friends
  next Friday evening. Would you care to come with me?"</p>

  <p>I would much rather not have gone, but I knew that a refusal would
  disappoint Lilith, who had set her heart on converting me. Accordingly, I
  accepted the invitation, and we were arranging details of the expedition when
  Peggy joined us. As soon as she heard what was afoot she was all agog.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what fun!" she exclaimed. "You'll let me come, too, won't you,
  Lilith? I did so enjoy it last time."</p>

  <p>Lilith, however, was by no means eager for her company, for the Titmouse
  was a rank unbeliever, and made no secret of it.</p>

  <p>"What is the use of your coming, Peggy?" said she. "You don't believe in
  the super-normal. You would only come to scoff."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I should remain to pray," rejoined Peggy. "It is no use preaching
  to people who are already convinced. And I should just love it. That Quecks
  man is so frightfully amusing. He is the funniest little guffin you ever saw,
  Sibyl. Won't you let me come, Lilith?"</p>

  <p>"Of course you can come if you really want to," Lilith replied with
  evident reluctance. "But you shouldn't speak of Mr. Quecks as if he were a
  mountebank or a buffoon. He may not be handsome, but he is a very learned man
  and very sincere."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, Lilith," said Peggy. "I won't call him a guffin any
  more. And thank you ever so much for letting me come."</p>

  <p>The arrangements being thus settled, it is only fair to Peggy to say that
  she endeavoured, as far as possible, to treat the demonstration quite
  seriously. Even in our private conversations she made no further disparaging
  references to Mr. Quecks, though I did gather that her anxiety to be present
  at the sance was not unconnected with a desire to keep an eye on him to see
  that he did not impose on me.</p>

  <p>Mr. Quecks' house was situated in a quiet street off Cromwell Road,
  Kensington, and the "demonstration" took place in a large room intermediate
  in character between a library and a drawing-room, lighted by three electric
  bulbs, all of which were encased in silk bags, so that the illumination was
  of a twilight dimness. The visitors were about a dozen in all, and while we
  were waiting for the late arrivals Mr. Quecks made a few observations on
  super normal phenomena in general.</p>

  <p>To me he required no disparagement from Peggy or anyone else, his own
  appearance doing all that was necessary in that respect. The first glance at
  him impressed me disagreeably; but then he was a manifestly uncomely man,
  with a large, bald face and long, greasy black hair, which was brushed
  straight back and accumulated in an untidy bush at the nape of his neck. He
  spoke unctuously, and his manner was confident, persuasive, didactic and
  authoritative, and he gave me the impression of a man who was accustomed to
  dealing chiefly with women&mdash;his present audience was composed of them
  exclusively.</p>

  <p>"In interpreting the results of the experiments which we are about to
  perform," he observed, "we have to bear in mind that psychical and
  super-normal phenomena, inasmuch as they are not concerned with material
  things, are not directly appreciable by the senses. We cannot see or touch
  the subliminal self, either our own or that of others. But neither can we see
  the electric current or the Hertzian waves. We know of their existence and
  properties indirectly, through their effects. Electricity can be transformed
  into heat, light or sound, and these can be perceived by means of the
  radiator, the electric lamp or the telephone, which act directly on our
  senses. So it is with the hidden subconscious self. Invisible itself, it can
  be made to produce effects which are perceptible to the conscious mind
  through the senses, and through those effects its own existence is
  revealed."</p>

  <p>This sounds reasonable enough; but the experiments themselves were rather
  disappointing on the whole. Perhaps I expected too much; or perhaps the
  preoccupied state of my mind did not allow me to bring to them sufficient
  interest or attention. Moreover, Mr. Quecks had an assistant (I had almost
  said "confederate") whose appearance pleased me no more than his own; a
  wall-eyed, taciturn woman of about thirty-five, of the name of Morgan, who
  acted as the "percipient"&mdash;the word "medium," I noticed, was not
  used&mdash;and helped to prejudice me against the experiments.</p>

  <p>We began with a demonstration of thought-transference, which I found dull,
  tiresome and unconvincing. Probably I was unreasonable; but the apparent
  triviality of the proceedings, which resembled a solemn and unspeakably dull
  drawing-room game, influenced my judgment. The percipient, Miss Morgan, being
  seated, blindfolded, in the middle of the room, a pack of playing cards and
  another pack of cards, each of which bore a single capital letter, were
  produced. A card was drawn out at random and held up behind the percipient
  and in view of everyone else, including Mr. Quecks, who held the percipient's
  hand. Miss Morgan then guessed the card or the letter. Sometimes she guessed
  correctly, sometimes nearly correctly, some times quite incorrectly. The
  proportion of correct guesses, Mr. Quecks informed us, was vastly greater
  than could be accounted for on the law of probabilities. And I dare say it
  was. But the exhibition left me cold, as did those of table-tilting and
  planchette writing which followed. Even the "pendule explorateur," which had
  so impressed me on a previous occasion, fell flat on this. For, since that
  rather startling experience, I had given some thought to the magic pendulum,
  and believed that I had found at least a partial explanation of its powers.
  Accordingly, when my turn came to try the "autoscope," I took the string in
  my fingers and shut my eyes; and when Mr. Quecks objected to this, I gazed
  fixedly at the opposite wall, seeing neither the pendulum nor the clockwise
  alphabet. Under these conditions the pendulum was a complete failure; it
  would spell nothing. But when I looked steadily at the pendulum and the
  letters, the swinging ball spelled out clearly the word that I
  chose&mdash;Lilith.</p>

  <p>I was thus in a decidedly sceptical frame of mind when the next set of
  experiments began; and even these produced, at first, no effect on me other
  than a slight tendency to yawn. Their object was to demonstrate the existence
  of a "psychometric" power or faculty; that is to say, a power to detect in
  certain material objects a permanent impression left by contact with some
  particular person. Such a faculty, Mr. Quecks explained to us, was possessed
  by certain exceptionally sensitive persons. He had it to some extent himself,
  but in Miss Morgan it was developed in a really remarkable degree, as the
  experiments which were to follow would convince us.</p>

  <p>Hereupon Miss Morgan was once more blindfolded, all the lights but one
  were switched off, so that the room was almost in darkness, and the
  demonstration began. One of the visitors, at Mr. Quecks' whispered request,
  slipped a ring from her finger and passed it to him. By him it was handed to
  Miss Morgan, who solemnly applied it to her forehead. Then followed an
  interval of expectant silence, in which I thought I heard a faint giggle from
  Peggy Finch, who sat in the row in front of me.</p>

  <p>At length Miss Morgan opened her mouth and spake. It seemed that she was
  seeing visions, and these she described in detail. Naturally I was unable to
  check them, nor could I judge whether they had any relation to the ring. The
  owner of that article stated, at the close of the experiment, that the
  visions, as described, corresponded closely to certain places and events
  which were known to her and to no one else. Which seemed conclusive enough;
  but yet it left me only with a feeling that the whole proceeding was
  ridiculous and trivial.</p>

  <p>The next experiment was performed with a glove from the hand of another
  visitor, and when this was concluded, Mr. Quecks whispered to a lady in the
  front row, who whispered to Peggy, who turned to me.</p>

  <p>"He wants your handkerchief, Sibyl," she said in a low whisper.</p>

  <p>I took my handkerchief from my pocket and gave it to Peggy, who squeezed
  it up into a ball and passed it to the lady in front, who passed it to Mr.
  Quecks, who handed it to Miss Morgan; who, in her turn, applied it to her
  forehead as if it had been an ice-bag, and assumed an attitude of intense
  mental concentration. And again the sound of a suppressed giggle came from
  the neighbourhood of the Titmouse.</p>

  <p>Then Miss Morgan began to speak.</p>

  <p>"I seem to be passing through the country&mdash;swiftly&mdash;very
  swiftly; past great, wide fields and woods. They are strange-looking woods.
  The trees are all in lines&mdash;in straight lines...But wait! Are they
  trees? No, they can't be; they are too small. No&mdash;they are plants
  growing up poles &mdash;they must be vines. It is a vineyard&mdash;and yet
  they don't look quite like vines. No, no! Of course, I see now; they are
  hops. It is a hop-garden. And now I am passing another. Now I have come out
  on to a road on the top of a hill. There are hills all round, and in the
  hollow there seems to be a town...and I seem to see water in the town...yes,
  it is water. It is a river...But I don't see any ships...only some red
  things...Oh, yes! I see; the red things are sails&mdash;red sails. I thought
  sails were always white."</p>

  <p>She paused; and in the intense silence I leaned forward, listening
  eagerly. All my indifference and boredom had vanished. This was quite a
  different affair from the card-guessing and planchette-reading. She had
  described Maidstone vividly, accurately&mdash;or at least so it seemed to me;
  Maidstone as it would appear to one approaching the bridge from the west. Of
  course it might be mere guessing; but&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I seem," Miss Morgan resumed, "to be descending a hill by a broad
  street...What is that in front of me? Is it&mdash;yes I see it is a bridge.
  Yes I see it plainly now. I am coming towards it. But what on earth is this
  thing on my left hand? It seems to be a mass of gold and yet...and yet it
  looks like an elephant. That's ridiculous, of course. It can't be...But it
  certainly looks like gold...and yet it...it really does look like an
  elephant! Well, I can make nothing of it. And now it is gone and I am on the
  bridge." Again she paused, and I sat gazing at her in blank astonishment.
  There could now be no question as to the reality of the visions, unless the
  whole exhibition was a fraud. The idea of skilful guessing could not be
  entertained for a moment. The description did not merely fit Maidstone; the
  detail of the golden elephant on the brewery by the bridge fixed the identity
  of the place I beyond the possibility of doubt. It was either a
  genuine&mdash;and most amazing&mdash;psychical phenomenon or an outrageous
  imposture. But an imposture, to which Lilith must have been a party, was more
  incredible than the super-normal itself.</p>

  <p>As these thoughts passed swiftly through my mind, Miss Morgan resumed her
  description.</p>

  <p>"I am standing on the bridge, but it is beginning to grow indistinct. By
  the riverside I can just see a great house, an old, old house, which seems to
  stand by the water's edge, and beyond it trees and a church tower. Now it is
  gone and I can see nothing. Is this all?...No; I see, very, very faintly, a
  small crowd of people. They seem to be in a field. And I make out a number of
  white objects in the field. They look rather like sheep, but they are very
  still. Oh! they are not sheep at all; they are tombstones. And I see now that
  the people are all in black and that they are standing round an open grave.
  It must be a funeral...Yes; there is the clergyman in his surplice...But it
  is beginning to fade.</p>

  <p>"Now I can only just see the dark shapes of the people and now they are
  gone too. This must be all, I think." She paused for a few moments and then
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"No it isn't! Something else is coming. It is very dim, but it looks like
  a man sitting at a table. Yes! But I can't see what he is doing. He is not
  writing. He has something in his right hand, and keeps moving it up and down.
  Oh, I see now: it is a hammer. He seems to be hammering some bright
  object&mdash;a piece of metal, I think...Yes, it is quite clear now. But it
  isn't a man at all; it is a woman. I saw her distinctly for a moment, but she
  has grown dim again...Now she has gone and I can see nothing...I think that
  is all...Yes, that is all. Nothing else seems to come."</p>

  <p>She removed the handkerchief from her forehead and held it out towards Mr.
  Quecks, who took it from her and tiptoed round to where I was sitting.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Otway," he whispered. "It seemed a very successful
  experiment; but you can judge better than I can."</p>

  <p>"It was, indeed, most successful," I replied, as he gave me back my
  handkerchief. "I am positively amazed at the detailed accuracy of the
  description."</p>

  <p>"You think the correspondence is closer than could be accounted for by
  coincidence or chance guessing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There can be no question of chance," I replied. "The descriptions were
  much too detailed and circumstantial."</p>

  <p>"That is most interesting," said he. "For there can be no other
  explanation but that of genuine psychometric faculty. Miss Morgan is a
  stranger to you, and, moreover, she did not know whose handkerchief it was.
  The remarkable success of this experiment seems to support Miss Blake's
  estimate of your unusual psychic gifts. You evidently have the power of
  imprinting your personality on inanimate objects in an exceptional degree. I
  should almost think it likely that you would be a successful scryer. Have you
  made any experiments with the crystal?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But they are all complete failures. I could see nothing."</p>

  <p>"That is not unusual in early experiments," said he. "There is a
  difficulty in concentrating. I wonder if you would care to make a trial now
  under my guidance. I think I could help you to visualize some simple scene.
  Will you try?"</p>

  <p>The astonishing success of Miss Morgan's experiment had revived all my
  former curiosity, and I assented readily, much to Mr. Quecks' satisfaction.
  The nature of the new experiment was explained to the company, and the
  necessary preparations made. An easy chair was placed for me in the middle of
  the room, and the chairs for the others arranged behind it, so that I should
  not have my attention distracted by seeing them. As I passed Lilith on my way
  to the chair, I greeted her with a smile, and was a little surprised at the
  lack of response on her part. I thought she would be gratified to see me
  taking so active a part in the proceedings; but apparently she was not;
  indeed, I had never seen her look so ungenial.</p>

  <p>When I had taken my seat, Mr. Quecks directed me to lean back and adopt a
  position of complete physical rest. A black, velvet cushion was then placed
  in my lap and on the cushion was laid the crystal globe, itself almost black
  in the dim twilight save for a single spark where it reflected the light of
  the one electric lamp.</p>

  <p>"You will look fixedly at the bright spot of light," said Mr. Quecks, who
  had seated himself beside me; "concentrate your attention on it and think of
  nothing else. Don't let your mind wander, and don't move your eyes. Think of
  the bright spot and look at it. Soon a mist will come before your eyes; then
  you will feel a sort of drowsiness. You will grow more and more drowsy, but
  your eyes will keep open and you will still see the mist. You are seeing it
  now&mdash;" (this was quite correct); "it grows denser; now you are beginning
  to feel drowsy&mdash;just a little drowsy&mdash;but your eyes are wide open;
  still you are getting drowsy&mdash;rather more drowsy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He seemed to repeat these words over and over and over again like a sort
  of chant; and his voice, which had been at first soft and confidential, took
  on a peculiar sing-song quality, and at the same time began to grow more and
  more distant until it came to me thin and small like the voices that are
  borne from far-away ships on a calm day across the water of a quiet
  anchorage. And, meanwhile, a strange somnolence fell upon me. I felt as if I
  were in a dream. Yet my eyes were wide open, and before them floated the
  mist, out of which shone the single spark of light. And the little, thin
  voice went on chanting far away, but I could no longer make out what it said.
  Nor was I attending to it. I was gazing into the mist at the tiny
  spark&mdash;gazing fixedly, unwinkingly, without effort.</p>

  <p>Presently the mist seemed to clear a little, and the spot of light began
  to grow larger. Now it looked like a hole in the shutter of a dark room; and
  now it was as though I were looking through an opera glass or a telescope;
  but I could make out nothing save a confused blur of light, in the middle of
  which was a vague, dark shape. But still the area of light grew larger, and
  now I could see that there were other shapes, all dim, vague and shadowy.
  Then in an instant it cleared up, as a magic-lantern picture sharpens when
  the lens is focussed. The dark shape was Mr. Otway. He stood, stooping
  forward, gazing at something on the floor&mdash;something that lay by the
  fireplace, motionless, with upturned waxen face. It was horribly distinct. I
  could see my father's face settling into the rigidity of death; I could see
  the crimson streak on his temple; I could even see the sparkle of the silver
  knob on the stick that Mr. Otway grasped.</p>

  <p>The vision lasted, as it seemed, but for a few seconds. Then it grew dim
  and confused and quickly faded away into blank darkness; and I found myself
  sitting up in the chair, wide awake, but bewildered and a little frightened.
  The lights were full on, and the visitors were all gathered around my chair
  gazing at me with a very odd intentness.</p>

  <p>"Did you see anything in the crystal?" Mr. Quecks asked, suavely.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, not quite so suavely. "How long have I been
  asleep?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Quecks looked at his watch. "Just five and twenty minutes," he
  replied.</p>

  <p>I got up from the chair, and, addressing Peggy, who was looking at me a
  little anxiously, asked: "What has been happening, Peggy? Have I been talking
  nonsense?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered. "You've been asleep, and you've been guessing cards
  and doing most extraordinary sums&mdash;multiplying and dividing fractions
  and all sorts of things. That's all. But," she added in a lower tone, "he'd
  no business to hypnotize you without your permission. You didn't give him
  permission, did you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't," I replied.</p>

  <p>At this moment Lilith came up to us and put the same question.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "I didn't understand that I was to be hypnotised."</p>

  <p>"I thought not," said she in a tone of evident vexation. "It doesn't
  happen to matter as things have turned out, but it was quite improper. I
  shall speak to Mr. Quecks about it when you are gone."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you coming with us, then?" asked Peggy.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Lilith. "I have some matters to talk over with him, so I
  must stay a little while; but I shall follow you in about half an hour."</p>

  <p>Shortly after this the meeting broke up, and Peggy and I took our
  departure. As we sat in the train, I tried to extract from my companion some
  details of what had happened, but I found her curiously unwilling to pursue
  the topic. I gathered, however, that, as soon as the hypnotic trance was
  completely established, Mr. Quecks suggested to me that I should have a
  distinct vision of some scene that I had witnessed "in the old town that Miss
  Morgan had seen and shortly before the funeral that she had described." Then,
  after an interval, he had put a number of problems in multiplication and
  division of large numbers and fractions, which I had solved with
  extraordinary ease and rapidity. As to the nature of my vision, Peggy
  displayed no interest, but turned the conversation on to subjects quite
  unconnected with Mr. Quecks or psychical science.</p>

  <p>When we arrived home she followed me to my room and suggested that we
  should wait there for Lilith, which was what I had intended to do. And here
  again she showed a marked tendency to avoid the subject of Mr. Quecks and his
  experiments. But, as she sat in my chair gossiping, I caught her eye, from
  time to time, travelling almost furtively towards the clock on the
  mantelpiece, and I wondered if she was feeling anxious about Lilith, who had
  to make her way alone through the rather unsavoury neighbourhood of Ratcliff.
  Whatever she was feeling, however, she kept up a flow of
  conversation&mdash;which was, itself, a rather unusual phenomenon&mdash;and
  presently grew quite confidential about herself&mdash;which was more unusual
  still. It was clear that her friendship with Mr. Hawkesley was now quite
  firmly established, and they evidently saw a good deal of one
  another&mdash;but this I knew already. And it was clear that their sympathy
  in tastes was running parallel to a very strong liking of a more personal
  kind.</p>

  <p>After a pause in this confidential gossip, Peggy suddenly looked down a
  little shyly, and, turning very pink, asked hesitatingly:</p>

  <p>"Sibyl, dear, you haven't quarrelled with Mr. Davenant, have you?"</p>

  <p>"Quarrelled, Peggy!" I exclaimed; "of course I haven't. Have we ever
  struck you as quarrelsome people?"</p>

  <p>"No, indeed," she replied. "But you don't seem to have seen much of one
  another lately."</p>

  <p>"No; I haven't seen Mr. Davenant for quite a long time," I said.</p>

  <p>She was silent for a while, and I noticed that her cheeks were growing
  more and more pink.</p>

  <p>"What is my little chameleon turning that colour for?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She looked up at me with a shy smile. "Sibyl," she said, "don't think me
  inquisitive or impertinent. I am your friend, you know, and we are fond of
  one another, aren't we?"</p>

  <p>"We are the very best of friends, Peggy, dear, so you needn't mind asking
  me anything that you want to know."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, Sibyl; why don't you and Mr. Davenant marry? Anyone can see
  how fond he is of you, and I'm sure you care for him an awful lot, don't you,
  now?"</p>

  <p>"My Titmouse is becoming an expert authority on these matters," said I,
  thereby converting poor Peggy to the semblance of a corn-poppy.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am," she admitted, defiantly. "But why don't you marry him,
  Sibyl?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Peggy," said I, "there is a very substantial reason. Its name is
  Mr. Otway."</p>

  <p>"Sibyl!" gasped Peggy. "I thought you were a widow!"</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "No, Peggy. I am a widow in effect, but a married woman
  by law. I have a husband who is no husband; whom I married in error, whom I
  have never lived with and could never think of living with, but whom I can
  never get rid of. That is the position."</p>

  <p>She flung her arms around my neck, and laid her cheek to mine.</p>

  <p>"My poor, dear Sibyl," she exclaimed. "How dreadful for you! I am so
  frightfully sorry, dear. And is there no end to this?"</p>

  <p>"There is death," said I. "That is all. And that is why I am not seeing
  much of Mr. Davenant nowadays."</p>

  <p>"It is an awful thing, Sibyl," said she. "You and Mr. Davenant could make
  one another so perfectly happy.' And I don't see why you shouldn't, for that
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Why, how could we, Peggy?"</p>

  <p>Again she blushed scarlet, and with a defiant glance at me, replied:</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have my whole life wrecked. I should just go off with him,
  husband or no husband."</p>

  <p>"You dreadful little reprobate. And what do you suppose the world would
  say about you?"</p>

  <p>"It could say what it liked so long as I'd got the man I wanted. But it
  wouldn't really say anything. No one with any sense would think a penny the
  worse of me. Nor would they of you. Everyone would say that you had done the
  right thing, seeing that you had no choice. You couldn't be expected to be
  bound for life to a dummy husband."</p>

  <p>At this moment I rose from my chair, and going over to the dressing-table,
  lit a candle. Then I put my hand in my pocket and drew out an unaddressed
  envelope and a piece of pencil. With the latter I wrote on the envelope my
  signature and the words "ten minutes to eleven." The whole proceeding seemed
  quite automatic. I did not know why I was doing it. I had not known that
  either the envelope or the pencil was in my pocket, for I had not put them
  there. But I carried out the train of action almost unconsciously and quite
  without surprise.</p>

  <p>When I had written on the envelope, I opened it and drew out a piece of
  paper. On the paper was some writing in an unfamiliar hand. I held the paper
  near the candle and read as follows:</p>

  <p>"At ten minutes to eleven you will light a candle, take this envelope and
  a pencil from your pocket; you will write on the envelope your signature and
  the time. Then you will open the envelope and read this message."</p>

  <p>I stood for some seconds gazing at the paper in utter amazement. Then I
  looked round quickly at the clock. It was ten minutes to eleven. From the
  clock my glance turned to Peggy, who was sitting watching me with a very
  uncomfortable expression.</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about this, Peggy?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied. "That Quecks man told you to do it. He wrote the
  message and put the envelope and pencil in your pocket when you were in a
  deep sleep. He spoke the message into your ear, and, after about a minute,
  told you to wake up, and you woke up immediately. It was like his impudence
  to perform his beastly experiments without getting your permission
  first."</p>

  <p>"It was. But the thing is rather uncanny. I don't like it at all."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing in it," said Peggy, though she, too, was evidently not
  pleasantly impressed. "It's what they call post-hypnotic suggestion. It isn't
  in any way super-natural. The doctors know all about it."</p>

  <p>"Still," said I, "it is a very strange affair. There is something
  extremely eerie in finding oneself turned into an unthinking automaton worked
  by somebody else's will. And some of the other experiments were rather
  startling: Miss Morgan's visions for instance."</p>

  <p>"Mightn't they have been just clever guesses?"</p>

  <p>"No, Peggy. That is quite impossible. Her descriptions applied to my case
  in detail and were correct every time. You heard her describe the view from
  Maidstone Bridge?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And I recognised it from that water-colour over your
  mantelpiece."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't you think it very wonderful and incomprehensible?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," said Peggy. "How do you suppose she did it?</p>

  <p>"I can only imagine that some influence that I don't understand passed to
  her from my handkerchief."</p>

  <p>"Then you imagine wrong," said the Titmouse. "Your handkerchief was in my
  pocket all the time. It was my handkerchief that she was smelling at. And her
  descriptions didn't fit me the least little bit. I don't hammer my pottery,
  you know."</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand. You passed her my handkerchief, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"No; I passed her mine. You see, I'd seen this handkerchief trick before
  and I had mine ready, rolled up into a ball in my hand. So it was quite easy
  to make the exchange. But we may as well change back now."</p>

  <p>She took a handkerchief from her pocket and handed it to me; and when I
  had identified it as my own, I produced hers and restored it to her.</p>

  <p>"You are a wicked little baggage, Peggy," said I, "though I must admit
  that the ruse was quite a fair one. But still, I don't quite see how it was
  done? It was evidently an imposture. But how was it worked? How did she get
  the information?"</p>

  <p>"Why, she got it from Mr. Quecks, and he got it from Lilith."</p>

  <p>"You surely don't suggest that Lilith was a party to this fraud?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I don't," she replied, indignantly. "Lilith is a lady to the
  tips of her fingers. That's just where it is. She would never suspect. But we
  know that she wrote to Quecks about you, and she has talked to him about you,
  and no doubt he has pumped out all that she knows about you. Then you will
  remember that he has just come back from a tour in Kent&mdash;he is almost
  certain to have been to Maidstone&mdash;and there are such things as picture
  postcards. There is no mystery as to how it was done; but I do wonder that he
  was such a fool as to do it before Lilith. I suspect she stayed behind to
  tell him what she thought of him."</p>

  <p>As we were speaking, Lilith came up the stairs, and I ran out to intercept
  her and bring her in.</p>

  <p>"You needn't have waited up for me," said she, "though I am glad you have,
  for I want to apologise for Mr. Quecks' very improper behaviour."</p>

  <p>"Don't think any more about it, Lilith," said I. "It didn't do any harm,
  and it has enabled Peggy and me to have a little private sance to
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Did the post-hypnotic experiment work correctly?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly&mdash;and most uncannily."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Lilith, "you have gained by that amount of experience. As to
  the rest of Mr. Quecks' experiments&mdash;well, Sibyl, I am afraid we must
  consider them on the plane of public entertainment rather than on that of
  genuine research. But it is getting late. We had better go to bed now and
  talk things over to-morrow."</p>

  <p>This advice was forthwith acted on, as to its first half; and if I owed
  Mr. Quecks a grudge for trying to impose on me, I should have been grateful
  to him for giving me something to think about other than my own griefs and
  entanglements.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-20"
     id="ch-2-20"></a>XX.&mdash; CLOUD AND SUNSHINE</h2>

  <p class="first">REVIEWING on the morrow my experiences at Mr. Quecks' house,
  I was conscious of a rather definite change of outlook. Those experiences had
  made a very deep impression. The vision that I had seen was something outside
  ordinary, normal experience, and it still haunted me. And then, even more
  uncanny, there was that strange automatic action which I had carried out with
  such perfect unconsciousness and yet so exactly and punctually. It was all
  very well for Peggy to put it aside with the easy explanation that it was
  merely post-hypnotic suggestion, and that the doctors knew all about it. That
  explanation explained nothing. The fact remained that I had suddenly become
  aware that things which I had been accustomed to dismiss as
  delusions&mdash;as the mere superstitions of credulous people&mdash;were
  actual realities. And this discovery created for me a new standard of
  possibility and truth. Even Miss Morgan's visions, though I knew them to be a
  rank imposture, had left an impression that was not to be completely effaced.
  The shock of amazement that they had produced at the time left a vague
  after-effect, due, no doubt, to the more real and equally mysterious
  experiences.</p>

  <p>Concerning these latter I was somewhat puzzled. It was not quite clear to
  me how I had come to be hypnotized at all, and I took an early opportunity of
  questioning Lilith on the subject.</p>

  <p>"There is no mystery about that," she replied. "The orthodox method of
  producing the hypnotic trance is to cause the 'subject' to gaze steadily at
  some bright object&mdash;a metal button, a crystal, or even a small piece of
  white paper. He is told to gaze fixedly at this object, to concentrate his
  attention on it, and to think of nothing else. The purpose of this is to get
  rid, as far as possible, of the conscious self and to allow the subconscious
  self to act without disturbance. When this state of mental abstraction has
  been established, the 'subject' is ready to receive suggestions. If the
  operator suggests to him that he is drowsy, he becomes somnolent; and at the
  same time he becomes much more susceptible to suggestion. Now, if the
  operator suggests to him that he feels certain sensations, he feels those
  sensations. If it is suggested that he performs certain actions, he performs
  them. This is what happened to you. Mr. Quecks induced you to gaze steadily
  at the crystal, and when you were in the proper state of mental abstraction,
  he suggested the hypnotic trance. Then he suggested that you would see a
  vision of some scene that you had looked on shortly before the funeral, and I
  understand that you did see such a vision."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did; and most astonishingly vivid it was. But, Lilith, when I lit
  that candle in my room I was not in the hypnotic trance."</p>

  <p>"No; that was a post-hypnotic phenomenon, and really a most interesting
  one. To understand it you must think of the two personalities, the conscious
  self and the subconscious, or subliminal self. Now the suggestions are made
  to the subconscious self, while the conscious is dormant or in abeyance. But
  when the conscious self returns or awakens, the subconscious mind continues
  to work, although unperceived by the conscious mind. If the suggestion
  refers, as in your case, to some action to be performed at an appointed time,
  the subconscious keeps account of the passing time and at the appointed
  moment sets the machinery in motion. The action itself is perceived by the
  conscious mind, but the train of subconscious thought has been unperceived,
  though it has really been quite continuous. It is very curious, though not
  particularly mysterious."</p>

  <p>"And it is only in the hypnotic trance that these suggestions take
  effect?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied Lilith, "is not quite clear. It seems that in ordinary
  sleep suggestions of the kind may sometimes take effect. And for the same
  reason. In sleep, the conscious self is in abeyance&mdash;is out of action;
  but the subconscious is active, as we see in the case of dreams and still
  more strikingly in the case of somnambulism. But the postponed effects of
  suggestions made during normal sleep need more investigation. I believe that
  sleep produced by drugs is much more like the hypnotic trance than natural
  sleep."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "it is all rather weird and uncanny," and so the subject
  dropped. But, as I have said, the influence of these strange experiences
  remained. My former scepticism of the occult and mystical gave place to a
  state of mind in which I was prepared to admit the possibility of things that
  I had once regarded as wildly incredible.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, I was but faintly interested in the wonders of psychical
  research. Indeed, I was not much interested in anything connected with my
  daily life. I had endeavoured to revive my enthusiasm for my work by setting
  myself an ambitious task&mdash;a silver candlestick of a semi-ecclesiastical
  design, worked in repouss with enrichments in enamel. But all the pleasure
  in the work was gone. The various processes &mdash;skilfully enough executed,
  as I noticed with tepid satisfaction&mdash;which should have been a joy, were
  but the routine of industry; and through them all the never-ending heartache,
  the sense of loss, of bereavement, the feeling that the light had gone out of
  my life for ever. The passing time seemed to bring no mitigation. Rather did
  it seem to me that every day I missed my dear companion more.</p>

  <p>Perhaps if my loss had been more final&mdash;if, for instance, Jasper had
  been taken from me by Death&mdash;I might have striven more determinedly to
  shape my life anew. But there was a certain inconclusiveness in our
  separation. Not that I ever, for a moment, considered the possibility of
  re-opening the question. But still I think there lurked in my mind the
  feeling that the door was not finally closed. Jasper's words, "Remember that
  I am still wanting you, that I am still asking you," would come to me
  unbidden, again and yet again, reminding me that the way was still open, that
  I could end the separation if and when I chose. And then Peggy's outspoken
  declaration was not without its effect. For the Titmouse was a very paragon
  of modesty and maidenly propriety; and when I recalled her robust contempt of
  conventional points of view I could not help asking myself sometimes if I had
  not been too prudish.</p>

  <p>All of which was very disturbing. It left me with my resolution unchanged,
  and yet without that sense of finality that would have set me reconstructing
  my scheme of life.</p>

  <p>So the weeks dragged by till the time for the first monthly letter drew
  nigh; and the passionate yearning with which I looked forward to it told me
  that that letter was a mistake. It ought never to have been. The chapter
  should have been ended and the volume shut irrevocably.</p>

  <p>As the time for the letter approached, my unrest took me abroad more than
  usual, and one day, forsaking the sordid east, I took the train to South
  Kensington and made my way to the Museum, though with no special object in my
  mind. I had ascended the steps to the main entrance, and was approaching the
  doorway, when I came face to face with Miss Tallboy-Smith, who was just
  emerging. At the sight of me she halted with a dramatic gesture of
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Well!" she exclaimed, "so you are really alive! I thought I was never
  going to see you again. Where have you been? It's
  ages&mdash;centuries&mdash;since I have seen you. And dear Miss Finch, too;
  whatever has become of her? Were you going into the Museum? I have just been
  wallowing in the Salting Collection. Delightful, isn't it? The very kernel of
  the Museum. Don't you think so?</p>

  <p>"I don't think I have ever seen the Salting Collection," said I.</p>

  <p>"Never seen the Salting Collection!" she gasped. "My dear Mrs. Otway! How
  dreadful! And you a connoisseur, too. Why, it's a Paradise; the collectors'
  Heaven. Do you believe that people come back after death and frequent their
  old haunts? I hope it's true. If it is, I shall come to the Salting
  Collection. I shall divide my ghosthood between that and the Wallace. It will
  really be very jolly. Unlimited leisure, with all eternity at one's disposal.
  And no stuffy restrictions; no closing hours or students' days. So
  convenient, too! You just pass in through the closed door or the wall and
  float up the stairs. Why, you could even get inside the glass cases! I'm
  afraid you'll think me an awful old heathen; but I'm not really. And how are
  you? And how is Miss Finch? And why haven't you been to the club for such an
  age. And isn't it dreadful about poor Mr. Davenant?"</p>

  <p>My heart seemed to stand still, and I think I must have turned pale, for
  Miss Tallboy-Smith said hastily: "I'm afraid I have startled you, Mrs. Otway;
  but surely&mdash;surely&mdash;do you mean to tell me that you haven't even
  heard about it?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard nothing," I said, faintly. "Is he&mdash;tell me what has
  happened."</p>

  <p>"I haven't had very full particulars," said she, "but it seems that a
  cart&mdash;or was it a wagon? No, I think it was a cart&mdash;and yet I'm not
  quite sure that it wasn't&mdash;but there! I'm not very dear as to the
  difference between a cart and a wagon. What is the difference?</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," I said impatiently. "Tell me what happened."</p>

  <p>"No," she agreed, "I suppose it doesn't matter. Well, it seems that this
  wagon&mdash;but I think it was really a cart&mdash;yes, I'm sure it
  was&mdash;at least, I think so&mdash;but at any rate it appears that the
  wagon had run away&mdash;that is, of course, it was the horse that had run
  away, but as he was tied to the cart, it comes to the same thing. And he got
  on to the pavement&mdash;it was in the Strand, somewhere near that shop where
  they sell those absurd&mdash;now what do they call those things? I am getting
  so silly about names, and it's quite a common name, too&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind what they are called," I entreated. "Do tell me what happened
  to Mr. Davenant."</p>

  <p>"Well, what happened was this. When the wagon got on the pavement all the
  people scattered to get out of the way&mdash;all except a messenger boy, and
  he fell down right in front of the cart. Then Mr. Davenant ran out and tried
  to drag the boy dear of the wagon; and, in fact, he did drag him out of the
  way, but he wasn't quick enough to save himself, for the horse swerved and
  knocked him down violently on to some stone steps. He fell with his side on
  the stone steps, and I understand that his ribs were simply smashed to
  matchwood."</p>

  <p>"And where is he now? Is he in a hospital?</p>

  <p>"He was. They took him to Charing Cross Hospital, but he wouldn't stay
  there. He insisted on going home directly they put on the splints or whatever
  the things were. And, will you believe me, Mrs. Otway, when I tell you that
  he has been living alone in those wretched chambers ever since! He wouldn't
  even have a nurse. Isn't that just like a man?"</p>

  <p>"But who looks after him?</p>

  <p>"Nobody. Of course there is the charwoman, or laundress as they call them
  &mdash;though why they should be called laundresses I can't imagine. They
  look more like dustwomen&mdash;and the man from the office downstairs looks
  in sometimes. It's a perfectly scandalous state of affairs. I wish, Mrs.
  Otway, you would go and see him and make him have a nurse."</p>

  <p>"I will certainly go and see him," said I. "I will go now," and I held out
  my hand to bring the interview to an end.</p>

  <p>"How sweet of you, dear Mrs. Otway!" she explained, keeping a firm hold of
  my hand, which I endeavoured unobtrusively to withdraw. "I felt sure you
  would go to the rescue. And you will insist on his having a nurse, won't you?
  He will listen to you, but you will have to be firm. Promise me you will,
  now."</p>

  <p>"I will see that he is properly looked after," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but he must have a nurse, you know&mdash;a properly trained and
  certificated nurse. You can get excellent nurses at that place&mdash;now,
  what is its name? Cavendish&mdash;Cavendish something. I am getting so silly
  about names. Let me see, I did have a card in my purse; perhaps it is there
  still&mdash;" Here she released my hand to open her wrist-bag, and I took the
  opportunity to retreat down the steps.</p>

  <p>"Don't trouble, please," I urged. "I shall manage quite well. Good-bye!"
  and with this I hurried away, somewhat unceremoniously, across the wide road,
  and, as soon as I had turned the corner, broke into a run. A couple of
  minutes later I arrived at the station, breathless, just in time to see a
  Circle train move out. I could have wept with vexation. It was but a few
  minutes before the next one would be due, but those minutes dragged like
  hours. With swift strides I paced up and down the platform in an agony of
  impatience, turning over and over again Miss Tallboy Smith's confused account
  of the accident and trying to construct by its aid some intelligible picture
  of Jasper's condition.</p>

  <p>Even when I was in the train its progress seemed intolerably slow and the
  succession of stations interminable. It was an agony to sit still and
  passively await the leisurely arrival at my destination, and an unspeakable
  relief when, at last, I reached the Temple Station, to spring from the train,
  dash up the stairs and hurry along the embankment. My progress on foot might
  be slower, but I had the physical sensation of speed.</p>

  <p>At the top of Middle Temple Lane I emerged into Fleet Street, and,
  crossing the road, entered Clifford's Inn Passage. I had never been there
  before, and, though I knew the number of Jasper's house, I thought it best to
  enquire as to its whereabouts. As I passed through the archway I saw a
  somewhat clerical-looking man standing at the door of the porter's lodge, and
  from him learned that No. 54 was in the inner court on the east side of the
  garden; with which direction I hurried on again. Clearly there came back to
  me the impressions that seemed so dim at the time: a sense of quiet and
  repose, of aloofness from the bustle of the city, an old-world, dignified
  shabbiness that was yet homely and pleasant withal. I crossed a little court,
  passed through a second archway, and came out into a second, larger court,
  where the gay foliage of plane trees found a foil in the dingy, red brick of
  the venerable houses. A glance showed me the narrow alley by the garden, and
  a dozen paces along its roughly-flagged pavement brought me to the entry of
  No. 54, on the side of which was painted "Mr. J. Davenant, Architect," and
  below, in smaller lettering, "Jonathan Weeble, Law Writer."</p>

  <p>I stepped into the entry, and tapping on a door which, by its painted
  description, appeared to appertain to Mr. Weeble's premises, was bidden to
  "come in." Accordingly, I entered and was confronted by a somewhat unkempt,
  young man who was apparently engaged in engrossing a large document which was
  secured to a sort of evergrown lectern by means of a band of tape.</p>

  <p>"I have called," I said, "to enquire about Mr. Davenant. Is he in a very
  serious condition?"</p>

  <p>"He wasn't when I saw him about an hour ago," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he would be well enough to see me?" The young man, whom I
  assumed to be Mr. Weeble, inspected me critically, and then replied:</p>

  <p>"I should say most emphatically that he would. But we needn't leave it at
  that. I can soon find out. Won't you sit down?"</p>

  <p>He rose briskly and hurried out of the office, and it was only when I
  heard him ascending the uncovered stairs, two or three at a time, that I
  remembered that I had given no name.</p>

  <p>Mr. Weeble's confident manner had lifted a load of anxiety from my mind,
  but my agitation was little abated. My fears were relieved, indeed, for
  evidently Jasper's condition was not such as to occasion alarm; but, as my
  anxiety subsided, other emotions made themselves felt. I was actually going
  to see him. Within a couple of minutes we should be together. The intolerable
  separation would be at an end. And the ecstasy of this thought&mdash;the
  almost painful joy of anticipation&mdash;brought home to me the intensity of
  my yearning to look on him again.</p>

  <p>The sound of Mr. Weeble's footsteps descending the stairs set my heart
  throbbing, and as he bustled into the office I stood up, trembling with
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," said he. "Mr. Davenant will see you, if you'll go up.
  First floor, right hand side of the landing. I've left the door open, and
  you'll see his name above it."</p>

  <p>I did not go up the stairs at Mr. Weeble's pace, but I went as rapidly as
  the trembling of my knees would let me. On the first floor I saw a
  forbidding, iron-bound door standing ajar, and above it the well-beloved
  name, painted in white letters. I drew back the heavy door, disclosing a
  lighter one, also ajar, which I pushed open as I closed the massive "oak"
  after me. For a moment I stood on the threshold looking into the quaint,
  old-world room, with its panelled walls and the soft green light from the
  plane trees shimmering through the windows. He was reclining by the fire on a
  low, wooden settle, and held a book in his hand; and even in that
  instantaneous glance I could see how changed he was&mdash;how pale and thin
  and weary-looking. But as I stepped out from the shadow, the worn face
  lighted up; the book fell to the floor, and he flung his arms out towards
  me.</p>

  <p>"Helen!"</p>

  <p>"Jasper!"</p>

  <p>In a moment I was on my knees by his side. His arms were around me and my
  cheek lay against his. And so for a while we rested with never a word spoken
  and no sound in the room but the ticking of the clock and the soft rustle of
  a swaying branch on the window panes. And so I could have rested for ever;
  for at last my heart was at peace.</p>

  <p>"Jasper, dear," I said, at length, "how is it with you? Are you badly
  hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," he replied. "It is just a matter of a cracked rib and a few
  bruises; and I've nearly recovered from those."</p>

  <p>"But why did you never send me a word? That wasn't friendly of you,
  Jasper."</p>

  <p>"How could I, dearest?" he protested. "A bargain is a bargain. The month
  wasn't up."</p>

  <p>"Jasper!" I exclaimed; "how could you be so silly? Of course you ought to
  have sent me a message, and I would have come to you instantly."</p>

  <p>"I am sure you would, Helen," said he, "which was an additional reason for
  my keeping to our covenant. It would have seemed a shabby thing to do; for,
  badly as I wanted you, I was never really in any danger. By the way, how did
  you hear of my little mishap?"</p>

  <p>I told him of my meeting with Miss Tallboy-Smith, and he chuckled softly.
  "She was an old goose to frighten you with those lurid stories, but I'm very
  grateful to her, all the same. I have wanted you, Helen."</p>

  <p>He drew me closer to him and stroked my hair fondly; and again we were
  silent for a while. The clock ticked on impassively, the plane tree rustled
  gently on the window, and I was filled with a quiet, restful happiness that I
  was unwilling to interrupt even by speaking.</p>

  <p>Presently Jasper bent down to my ear and whispered:</p>

  <p>"Helen, darling, you haven't anything to tell me, have you?"</p>

  <p>I knew what he meant, of course; and the strange thing is that, though the
  question came unexpectedly, and though I had not consciously given the
  subject a moment's, thought, I found my mind completely and finally made
  up.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied, "I have. Jasper, dear, I am your own. I can't live
  without you. The world must say what it will. I can do without the world, but
  I can't exist without you."</p>

  <p>He drew me yet closer to him and kissed me reverently. "Dear heart," he
  said softly, "sweet wife, I would try to thank you if words could tell you
  what your precious gift means to me. But life is before us, and mine shall be
  one long thanksgiving. You have given me my heart's desire; if love and
  worship and faithful service can in any degree repay you, they shall be yours
  as long as our lives endure."</p>

  <p>Thus in a few moments were the long weeks of misery and despair blotted
  out. We were reinstated, and, indeed, much more than reinstated; we were
  admitted and accepted lovers. And, just as my mind had, so to speak, made
  itself up without conscious thought on my part, so now that I had entered
  into this new covenant it seemed quite inevitable and satisfying. Its
  nonconformity with social conventions left me completely undisturbed.</p>

  <p>Presently Jasper made me draw up a low, rush-bottomed chair that I might
  sit comfortably by his side while we talked. But, in fact, we talked little;
  for there is a sort of telepathy born of perfect sympathy that makes speech
  superfluous. We were both very happy and very deeply moved; and it seemed
  more companionable to sit, hand clasped in hand, and let our thoughts run on
  undisturbed by speech, knowing that the thoughts of each were but a
  reflection of the other's.</p>

  <p>Anon came Mr. Weeble, stamping slowly up the stairs like an infirm
  coal-porter and making such a prolonged to-do about inserting the latch-key
  into the outer door that we both laughed. A very discreet man was Mr.
  Weeble.</p>

  <p>"I've just come to see if I can do anything," said he, when Jasper had
  introduced me. "I generally make his tea and straighten out his bandages.
  Shall I make the tea now or are you taking charge, Mrs. Otway?"</p>

  <p>"I will make the tea," said I, "but while you are tidying up the bandages
  I will run out and get some fresh cakes."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Weeble, "that would be a good idea. Our stock is rather
  low and a trifle old and fruity. And talking of cakes, that reminds me that
  an old rooster called a day or two ago and left one. I put it in a spare
  deed-box and forgot all about it. I'll go and fetch it up."</p>

  <p>"A rooster, you say, Weeble," said Jasper. "May we assume that you are
  speaking figuratively?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Mr. Weeble. "Elderly party with an automatic smile and the
  rummiest name I ever heard. Now what was her name? Something
  double-barrelled&mdash;Bigboy-Jones, was it?"</p>

  <p>"Tallboy-Smith, I expect," said Jasper.</p>

  <p>"That was it. I sent her a letter of thanks the same day in your
  handwriting and signed it with your name. Are you starting now, Mrs. Otway?
  You'll find a very good cake-shop in Fetter Lane near the top on the
  left-hand side."</p>

  <p>I took a brief bag of Jasper's and his latchkey and sallied forth into
  Fetter Lane by the postern gate; and as I walked up the quaint, old street I
  found myself looking into the homely shops and inspecting the ancient timber
  houses with a queer sort of proprietary air, as if I belonged to the
  neighbourhood. I found the cake-shop&mdash;-it was really an old-fashioned
  baker's shop, such as one might find in a country town&mdash;and as I made a
  selection of the wares, based on experience of Jasper's tastes, I found
  myself almost unconsciously considering the merits of the establishment as a
  source of supply for a family of two. If the change in my mental state was
  sudden, it was certainly complete; as I sauntered back down Fetter Lane with
  my bag of provisions, care-free and filled with a delightful sense of
  emancipation, loitering to look into shop windows or to peer up strange
  courts and alleys that I might not return prematurely; I could not but
  contrast my condition with that in which I had set forth in the morning,
  hopeless, heart-weary, despondent. When I arrived at Jasper's chambers, Mr.
  Weeble had already gone; but he had filled the kettle and set it to boil on
  the gas-stove in the kitchen, where I found it murmuring placidly and
  breathing out little clouds of steam. The kitchen was a delightful absurdity.
  About the magnitude of a good-sized china cupboard, it suggested, with its
  range of shelves and little chemical sink, a doctor's dispensary or a
  chemist's laboratory. Yet it was very orderly and quite convenient, and it
  had the advantage that, while I was engaged in the preparations for the meal,
  my heart singing in unison with the kettle's song, I could look out of a tiny
  window on the moss-grown garden, or through the open door see Jasper watching
  me with a smile of ecstasy, and receive his instructions as to where the
  various articles were to be found. It was all very pleasant and intimate, and
  every little, homely detail helped to bring home to me the reality of my
  happiness.</p>

  <p>During the very leisurely tea we gradually approached the subject of our
  future arrangements, which had evidently been very carefully thought out by
  Jasper.</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite such a graven image as I look," said he. "I don't believe
  it's necessary for me to keep so immovable. But that is the doctor's
  business. I just do as I'm told. However, my bandages are coming off in a few
  days, and I understand that I shall be practically well in a fortnight. Until
  I am well, we had better let things remain as they are; and I think it would
  be better for you not to come and see me again in the interval."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that I am to leave you, a helpless invalid all alone and no
  one to look after you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "Of course, I shall want you dreadfully, but as to my
  being alone and helpless, that is merely a sentimental view of the case. You
  can see for yourself that I am quite comfortable and well
  cared-for&mdash;Weeble never forgets me for an instant. And I think it most
  necessary that, until we are definitely married, we should have the most
  scrupulous regard for the conventions. We can't get the sanction either of
  the Law or the Church to our marriage; therefore, it is the more necessary
  for us to treat it ourselves with the utmost respect and seriousness. We are
  not going to enter into a casual and irresponsible relationship. We are going
  to contract a marriage; and I propose that we do so publicly and with proper
  formalities suited to the dignity and importance of the transaction."</p>

  <p>"But," I asked, "what formalities are possible?</p>

  <p>"My proposal," he replied, "is this: we shall appoint a day and a time to
  meet here, and have two witnesses in attendance. Weeble could be one and the
  Inn porter, Mr. Duskin, the other. In the presence of those witnesses we
  shall formally agree to take one another as husband and wife. Each of us
  shall make a written declaration to the same effect, reciting the
  circumstances which render the unusual procedure necessary, and, in your
  case, denouncing and repudiating your marriage with Otway. These declarations
  we shall respectively read to the witnesses&mdash;who will also read
  them&mdash;and we shall each sign our declaration in the presence of the
  witnesses. I am not quite clear whether it would be legal for them to
  counter-sign as witnesses. If not, we shall add a note stating that the
  signatures were made in their presence. Then we shall exchange declarations
  and we shall notify Mr. Otway and whosoever else may be concerned, or whom we
  wish to inform, of what has taken place. Does that meet with your approval,
  Helen?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely," I replied, "excepting the sentence of banishment. Don't you
  think I might just look in on you now and again to see if you want
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"It is only a fortnight, dearest," said he, "and we can write as often as
  we please. Until we are married we can't be too careful to avoid provoking
  criticism."</p>

  <p>I made no further objections, for I felt that he was right; and, moreover,
  I could not but perceive that this rather excessive primness, like the
  formalities which he had proposed, was simply an unconscious expression of
  chivalrous respect, a protest in advance against any unfavourable criticisms
  of me. And in accordance with what I felt he would consider prudent, I took
  leave of him comparatively early, so as to avoid a second meeting with Mr.
  Weeble, who, I learned, came in every night between eight and nine to help
  him to get to bed.</p>

  <p>"I shall write to you every day," I said, as I drew on my gloves, "and you
  must promise that, if there is anything that I can do for you, you will let
  me know and never mind about Mrs. Grundy. Is that agreed?"</p>

  <p>He gave the required promise, and when I had handed him back his
  latch-key, I stooped and kissed him; and as I looked back at him before
  closing the iron-bound door, I could not but contrast this parting with the
  miserable farewell of less than a month ago.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-21"
     id="ch-2-21"></a>XXI. &mdash; A DREADFUL INHERITANCE</h2>

  <p class="first">IT has always been, and still is, somewhat of a puzzle to me
  to account for the sudden and complete change in my point of view in regard
  to my union with Jasper. Lilith would doubtless have explained it as a case
  of subconscious reflection, and probably she would have been right. My
  impression is that Peggy's matter-of-fact attitude toward marriage
  unsanctioned by law had a more profound effect, than I was aware of; that her
  words&mdash;which I had certainly recalled from time to time&mdash;had
  remained in my mind subconsciously exercising a continuous influence. Or it
  may be that I had found a life of separation impossible, and had realised it
  consciously only when I found myself once more in Jasper's presence.</p>

  <p>But, however it may have happened, the fact remains that I accepted the
  new order without a qualm. The conditions that I had scouted as unthinkable
  now seemed entirely reasonable and acceptable. The only twinge of misgiving
  that I ever had, was produced by the draft of the declaration that Jasper
  sent for my approval and criticism. For that well-meant document, with its
  half-defiant, half-protesting phrases, did certainly bring home to me with
  uncomfortable vividness the fact that this marriage was not like any other
  marriage, and that I was not as other married women were. But I sent it back
  approved and tried to forget it, and quietly went on with my preparations for
  the new life.</p>

  <p>Outwardly, however, I made no change in my habits, and even tried to
  suppress the gaiety and buoyancy of spirit that I felt, lest the sudden
  change from my recent depressed condition should attract notice. I still
  lived my life apart, only too happy in my solitude, and spent most of my time
  in the workshop conning over Jasper's letters, or meditating on the happy
  days that were drawing so near. For a time the candlestick was sadly
  neglected, until I had the sudden inspiration of finishing it as a
  wedding-gift to Jasper. And then all the joy of work revived and blossomed
  into unsuspected skill. Tracer and punch seemed to travel along their
  appointed paths unguided; the spindle-shanked chasing hammer became a
  familiar demon and appeared to develop a volition of its own, and the little
  enamel furnace roared with glee.</p>

  <p>So the days sped by, each bringing me nearer to the golden gate of my
  enchanted garden, and each so filled with quiet happiness that I could not
  wish it shorter. About the end of the first week came a letter from Jasper
  saying that the bandages had been discarded, and that he had taken a walk and
  had appeared quite well and strong. A day or two later, came another fixing
  the date and time of our meeting. It was to be on the following
  Thursday&mdash;only five days ahead&mdash;at six o'clock in the evening. The
  formalities were to be carried out immediately on my arrival; we should then
  dine quietly at the club, spend the evening at a concert or the theatre, and
  take the boat train either to Flushing or Calais, which ever I preferred.</p>

  <p>The arrival of this letter, though I had been daily expecting it, came as
  quite a shock, and turned my tranquil happiness into feverish excitement
  which I had some difficulty in concealing. The fixing of an actual date and
  the selection of a definite region in which to spend the honeymoon (I chose
  the north of France) gave a reality to this Great Adventure and brought it
  out of the undefined future into the present. For now I had to carry out the
  final preparations. Lightly as I might travel, I must take some luggage, and
  this would entail a conveyance; and this in its turn involved something in
  the nature of a public departure, so that, if I had desired to disappear
  secretly&mdash;which I did not&mdash;the thing would have been impossible.
  Yet I was, naturally, loath to say much about my immediate intentions,
  preparing to make my explanations by letter after the event; and this the
  prevailing good manners of the little community made quite easy. I notified
  Miss Polton and my more intimate friends that I was going away on a visit of
  uncertain duration, and, whatever curiosity they may have felt, no further
  particulars were asked for as I went about my immediate
  preparations&mdash;the packing of those few things that I must needs take
  away with me&mdash;unnoticed, or at least uncommented on, and then began
  unobtrusively to arrange the rest of my possessions for the final
  removal.</p>

  <p>On Wednesday&mdash;the day before that of my departure&mdash;a letter
  arrived from Mr. Otway. It reached me just after lunch, and I glanced at it
  before rising from the table. The subject was the same as that of previous
  ones, but it was evident that something in the nature of a crisis was
  approaching. The extreme agitation of the writer was shown not only in the
  matter and the impassioned, rather incoherent manner, but even in the
  handwriting; which was ill-formed and slovenly, in great contrast to Mr.
  Otway's usual business-like neatness.</p>

  <p>"My dear Helen," it began "I have not troubled you for quite a long time
  with my miserable affairs&mdash;which are, to some extent your affairs too.
  But they are going from bad to worse, and now I feel that I am coming to the
  limits of endurance. I cannot bear this much longer. My health is shattered,
  my peace of mind is wrecked, and my brain threatens to give way. Death would
  be a boon, a relief, and I feel that it is not far off. I cannot go on like
  this. Those wretches leave me no peace. Hardly a week passes but I get some
  new menace; and now&mdash;but I can't tell you in a letter. It is too
  horrible. Come to me, Helen, for the love of God! I am in torment. Have pity
  on me, even though you have never forgiven me. I cannot come to you, for I am
  now unable to leave my bed. I am a wreck, a ruin. Come to me just this once,
  and if you cannot help me, at least give me the comfort of your sympathy. You
  will not be troubled by me much longer.</p>

  <p>"Your distracted husband,</p>

  <p>"LEWIS OTWAY."</p>

  <p>The emotions that this letter aroused were mixed and rather conflicting.
  Never had I felt a deeper loathing of Mr. Otway than now that I was being
  forced to accept what I knew in my heart to be but a counterfeit of marriage.
  I had been robbed of my birthright, and he had robbed me. Never was I less in
  a mood to offer him sympathy in the troubles that he had created for himself
  and me by his callous selfishness. And yet I decided to go to him. Whether
  the decision was due to some sort of compunction for the blow that I was
  going to strike on the morrow; or whether to curiosity, or to a desire to
  verify his foreboding of approaching death, I cannot say. Certainly the last
  consideration entered into the mixture of motives, and probably was the
  determining factor. At any rate, I decided to go. Dimly, I perceived that I
  ought to have consulted Jasper, though I was unaware of the possible legal
  significance that my visit might acquire. I formed my decision at once, and
  early in the afternoon set forth westward with the letter in my pocket.</p>

  <p>I did not go direct to Mr. Otway's chambers. Promptly as I had made up my
  mind, I felt the necessity of thinking over the circumstances and forecasting
  the possibilities. On my way westward I made a halt at a tea-shop, and while
  I awaited the leisurely service I drew out the letter and read it through
  again. Clearly the blackmailers were becoming more urgent and possibly more
  definite. It seemed as though they had adopted some new tactics. But it was
  not the blackmailers who interested me. I found my eye travelling again and
  again to those two sentences that hinted at the possibility of Mr. Otway's
  death.</p>

  <p>"I feel that it is not far off." And again, "You will not be troubled by
  me much longer." Had he any solid grounds for these forebodings? Or were they
  merely the offspring of abiding terror, or perchance simply rhetorical
  flourishes designed to arouse my sympathy? These were questions of no small
  moment to me, for Mr. Otway's death would set me free and in an instant
  unravel the tangled skein of my relations with Jasper.</p>

  <p>As I drank my tea with reflective deliberation I turned these questions
  over in my mind, not disguising from myself the cool, impassive, egoism of my
  attitude. My feeling in respect of Mr. Otway was devoid of any trace of
  sentimentalism. I viewed him as the insurance director views the generalised
  "proposer,"&mdash;but inversely; for I was interested in his decease, not in
  his survival. I loathed him, but I did not hate him. I did not wish him ill.
  If I could have saved him from suffering I would have done so, even at the
  cost of some considerable effort. But if he had stood in the face of instant
  death, and I could have averted that peril by moving a finger, I would not
  have moved a finger.</p>

  <p>That was my position. As I rose from the table and returned the letter to
  my pocket, what was in my mind was that Mr. Otway seemed to think that he was
  going to die, and I hoped that he was right.</p>

  <p>When I reached Lyon's Inn Chambers the sun was already low and the gloom
  of the evening was beginning to settle on the closed-in block of buildings. I
  ascended the ill-lit stone stairs to the second floor, where the light on the
  landing was so dim that I had difficulty in deciphering Mr. Otway's name
  above the door of his "set" and as I did so I noted with surprise that the
  inscription was faded and obscure, and had the appearance of having been in
  existence for many years, whereas Mr. Otway had, as I believed, but recently
  entered on his tenancy.</p>

  <p>The door was opened by Mrs. Gregg, who stood in the gloom of the entry
  confronting me without a word.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mrs. Gregg," I said. "Mr. Otway has asked me to call on
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ye need make no excuses," she interrupted, "for coming to see your lawful
  husband."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Gregg," I replied. "Is Mr. Otway disengaged?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered; "he is expecting a visitor."</p>

  <p>"How very unfortunate," said I. "He wanted particularly to see me, I
  know."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you could look in some time to-morrow?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>"No, I am afraid I can't. If Mr. Otway is unable to see me this evening I
  must write to him. I shall not have another opportunity to call for some
  considerable time."</p>

  <p>She reflected for a few moments, and I gathered that she was unwilling to
  take the responsibility of cancelling the interview.</p>

  <p>"Could you call again a little later?" she asked, at length. "He will have
  finished with his visitor by about half-past seven, or say a quarter to
  eight. Could you look in again at eight?"</p>

  <p>I had not wanted to be out as late as this would make me, but if I was to
  see Mr. Otway at all, it would have to be to-night. Eventually I accepted the
  arrangement, some what, I think, to Mrs. Gregg's relief.</p>

  <p>As I descended the stairs I heard the footsteps of two
  persons&mdash;apparently a man and a woman&mdash;ascending. On the
  first-floor landing I met the man, who turned out to be the lamplighter. Just
  as I had passed him he lit the landing lamp, and its light, which came from
  behind me, fell full on the woman who was coming up. It was only a momentary
  glimpse that I caught as she passed me on the stairs, but I recognised her
  instantly. She was Mrs. Campbell, the wife of the Ward Street dealer.</p>

  <p>It was an odd meeting, and it gave me the material for a good deal of
  thought and speculation. Mr. Otway's chambers were the only ones on the
  second floor; from which it seemed probable that Mrs. Campbell was the
  visitor whom he was expecting. This was a rather queer coincidence; but it
  was not the only one. That sudden recognition of the face, thrown into strong
  relief against the dark background by the bright lamplight, had set my memory
  working. I remembered how, when I had seen Mrs. Campbell in the shop and had
  heard her speak, her face had seemed to suggest something familiar, and her
  accent and the intonation of her voice had called up some accent and tone
  that I had heard before. It had been but a vague impression at the time; but
  now, in the new setting and aided by association, the impression became quite
  definite. The face that hers had suggested was Mr. Otway's face; but the
  really odd thing was that her voice and accent suggested not Mr. Otway's but
  Mrs. Gregg's. And this very queer resemblance was made yet more queer by a
  singular discrepancy. Mrs. Gregg spoke with a distinct Scottish accent. It
  was a peculiar one, different from that of any other Scots person whom I had
  ever heard speak; but it was quite pronounced. Mrs. Campbell, on the other
  hand, had no trace whatever of a Scottish accent; of that I was quite sure.
  But I was equally sure of the resemblance between the two, subtle and elusive
  as it was.</p>

  <p>Here, then, was a problem the consideration of which gave me quite a
  considerable amount of occupation, and, helped me to while away the hour and
  a half that I had to wait. The almost fantastic oddity of the coincidence
  might have made me reject my impressions as mere delusions; but, on the one
  hand, there was Mrs. Campbell evidently making for Mr. Otway's chambers, and,
  on the other, was the fact that it was Mr. Otway who had introduced me to the
  shop in Wardour Street. However, I could get no farther than speculation;
  and, as speculation tends rapidly to exhaust its limited material, I
  presently dismissed the problem and returned to the consideration of Mr.
  Otway's health and its bearing on my own future.</p>

  <p>The hour and a half I spent in a leisurely survey of Lincoln's Inn and the
  Temple. My perambulations with Jasper had brought home to me that London is
  an entertainment in itself; that no observant person need be dull who has
  access to its historic streets and picturesque backwaters. And now it was
  very pleasant to revisit the scenes of former rambles&mdash;to be repeated
  often in the future&mdash;and meanwhile to reflect on the happenings of the
  present and let my thoughts stray to the new life that was about to open; and
  the time slipped away so agreeably that when the three-quarter chime was
  struck in a polite undertone by the genteel clock in the Inner Temple, it
  came to me as quite a surprise.</p>

  <p>On the stroke of eight I rang the bell of Mr. Otway's chambers, and was
  forthwith admitted by the taciturn Mrs. Gregg. In silence she conducted me
  along a narrow corridor that led from the entrance lobby, across a largish
  room furnished partly as a library, partly as a dining-room and by a
  communicating door into the bedroom, when&mdash;still without uttering a word
  departed, shutting the door after her.</p>

  <p>Mr. Otway half rose in bed as I entered, and made a vague gesture of
  welcome, finally extending his hand, which I shook formally.</p>

  <p>"This is really good of you, Helen," said he, "to come and see me, and to
  come so promptly. I am sorry Mrs. Gregg sent you away. There was no need. My
  other visitor could have been put off."</p>

  <p>"It is of no consequence," said I. "My time was my own to-night. What is
  the new trouble&mdash;for I infer from your letter that there is some new
  development. Is there any definite threat?"</p>

  <p>Again he half rose in bed, and looking at me with anxious intensity said,
  in a low, suppressed tone "Helen, just see that the door is properly
  shut."</p>

  <p>I did so, and he then begged me to draw the chair, which had been placed
  for me, closer to him. This I also did, and, having seated myself, looked at
  him expectantly.</p>

  <p>Still half raised in bed, he bent his head as near to me as he could, and
  in a whisper said, "Helen, I want to ask you a question. What became of your
  father's stick?"</p>

  <p>The question, whispered with such strange secrecy, and accompanied by a
  singular look compounded of eagerness, fear and suspicion, somewhat startled
  me; for I remembered, even as he spoke, that the same question had been asked
  by Dr Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the least idea," I replied. "Haven't you got it?</p>

  <p>"No. I never had it. I have never seen it since the&mdash;ah&mdash;the
  occasion when&mdash;ah&mdash;you remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course I remember. I have good reason to."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;no doubt. Yes. But are you quite sure&mdash;I thought you might
  have taken it away with you."</p>

  <p>"But, Mr. Otway, you let me out of the house yourself. You saw me go, and
  you must have seen that I was not taking it. And you know that I never came
  to the house again."</p>

  <p>He sank back on his pillow with a gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he murmured, "that seems to be so. It must be so, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"It is so," I said. There is no question about it. When I went away that
  morning the stick was in your house. But why are you asking me about it? Is
  it of any importance?</p>

  <p>He turned towards a table that stood by the opposite side of the bed, and
  taking up a bunch of keys, unlocked a deed-box that was on the table, and
  took from it a sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>"Read that," said he, handing me the paper.</p>

  <p>The document was a type-written letter of a similar character to the
  previous ones, and of about the same length. It ran thus:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lewis Otway,</p>

  <p>"Some funny questions are being asked. What about Mr. Vardon's
  stick&mdash;the loaded stick with the silver, knob to hide the lead loading?
  Where is it? Somebody says they know where it is and who's got it. And they
  say there is a bruise on the silver top, and they say something about a smear
  of blood and a grey hair sticking to it. Do you know anything about it? If
  you don't, you'd better find out. Because I think you'll hear from that
  somebody before you are many weeks older or else from the police.</p>

  <p>"A WELL-WISHER."</p>

  <p>As I came to the end of this document I raised my eyes and met Mr. Otway's
  fixed on me with a very singular expression. But he quickly averted his gaze,
  possibly embarrassed by the steady intensity of my own. For this letter,
  together with Mr. Otway's agitated questionings, had revived the old doubts
  in my mind. Could there be any truth in this veiled accusation? Was it
  possible that I had really made a hideous mistake in shielding this man? As
  these doubts flashed through my mind, some reflection of them may have
  appeared in my expression as I steadily, looked Mr. Otway in the face. At any
  rate, he looked away as I have said; and when I handed him back the letter,
  he took it in a hand that shook like a dipsomaniac's, and replaced it in the
  deed-box without a word.</p>

  <p>For a space we were both silent, and I sat looking at him and his
  surroundings with profound distaste. The close, stuffy air of the room
  aroused a faint disgust; the objects on the bedside table&mdash;the cigarette
  box&mdash;the large spirit decanter and siphon and a bottle of veronal
  tablets&mdash;conveyed a disagreeable impression of drinking and drug-taking.
  And the man himself, with his pasty face, his baggy eyelids, creased with
  multitudinous wrinkles, his drooping, tremulous underlip, was distinctly
  repellent. The whole atmosphere of the place and its occupant was
  unwholesome, sordid and abnormal.</p>

  <p>Yet, unwholesome and unhealthy as he looked, there was no striking change
  in Mr. Otway's appearance; nothing new to justify, so far as I could judge,
  his alarming account of himself. His aspect supported the suggestions of the
  spirit-bottle, the cigarettes and the veronal; he looked distracted,
  terrified, nerve-shaken; but he did not, to my eye, look like a dying man. I
  inspected him critically during that interval of silence, and arrived, almost
  regretfully, I fear, at the conclusion that his forebodings were merely the
  result of a chronic state of fear&mdash;if they were real and not
  deliberately assumed to excite my sympathy.</p>

  <p>I think he must have had a feeling that I was regarding him with
  disfavour, for presently he turned towards me with a deprecating air and
  sighed wearily.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, Helen," said he, "that you are very tired of me and my
  troubles. But you must try to be patient. It may not be for long."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?" I asked. "Is your health really bad, apart from the
  worry of these letters?"</p>

  <p>"My health gets worse from week to week," he replied. "Not that I am
  suffering from any definite disease. But the constant alarm and anxiety, the
  shocks which keep coming one on top of another, are breaking me up. I get no
  interval of peace in which to recover. I am in a constant state of worry and
  depression by day, which leads to that," and he pointed to the
  spirit-decanter, "and it is even worse at night unless I secure a little rest
  by those things," pointing to the veronal bottle; "and cigarettes, whisky and
  veronal don't make for a long life or robust health."</p>

  <p>"Still," I said, "you mustn't exaggerate or alarm yourself unnecessarily.
  You are not in very good condition, I can see; but there is no reason to
  suppose that you are in a dangerous state. Couldn't you cut off these drugs
  and the whisky and go away for a change?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't go away," he said. "They would find me out and follow me. And
  as to cutting off the stimulants and the sedatives, that is impossible. Bad
  as they are, they are the last bulwark against something worse."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He did not answer immediately, but seemed to be considering my question
  and debating whether he should make any further confidences. At length he
  turned to me somewhat abruptly with an expression which I had never seen on
  his face before: a wild expression strangely unlike his usual, heavy
  stolidity, suggesting excitement and terror, with yet a curious dash of
  exultation.</p>

  <p>"Helen," he said with a singular intensity of voice and manner, "there are
  men who are born into this world under sentence of death. The black cap hangs
  over their cradles. Throughout their lives they have continually to
  watch&mdash;to evade the execution of the sentence if they can. But the time
  comes when they can escape no longer. They are tired of evasion, of the
  struggle to escape; and then they give themselves up; and that is the
  end.</p>

  <p>"I am one of those men, Helen. My mother put an end to her own life. My
  only brother put an end to his life. My mother's father made away with
  himself. It is in the blood. My mother was found hanging from a tree in an
  orchard. My brother disappeared and was found a month later hanging from a
  peg in a disused wardrobe. My grandfather hanged himself from a beam in the
  loft. Perhaps there were others. At any rate, there it is. The fathers have
  eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge."</p>

  <p>He paused, and I sat looking with uneasy surprise at the unwonted
  animation in his face: the faint flush, the awakening light in his eyes, the
  suppressed eagerness of his manner. There was something weirdly unpleasant
  about this new phase.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't allow these fancies to disturb you," I said feebly.</p>

  <p>"They are not fancies," he retorted. "They are weighty realities. I
  thought for a long time that the inheritance had passed me by. But when the
  first of those letters came, I knew that the legacy had fallen in. And every
  new menace sets the impulse working. Whenever one of those letters comes I
  feel it; I find myself thinking of my mother and my brother, and wondering if
  they felt the same. Then I take a stiff whisky, and the feeling goes off. But
  I don't care, nowadays, to go to bed until I have taken a dose of
  veronal."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He drew himself to the edge of the bed, and, thrusting his head out,
  peered into a shadowy corner of the room with a sort of half-terrified,
  half-exultant leer that seemed to stir the very marrow of my bones.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Mr. Otway?" I asked, staring into the corner but seeing
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"Do you see it, Helen?" he said, rolling his eyes at me and then looking
  back into the corner, which was in a line with the bed-head; "that great
  hook, or bent peg. I can't imagine what it was put there for; but there it
  is, like a great metal finger, beckoning, beckoning."</p>

  <p>I looked at the object that he indicated&mdash;a massive curved peg or
  hook fixed to the wall about seven feet from the floor&mdash;and shivered
  slightly. Its appearance was horribly suggestive.</p>

  <p>"When I used to lie awake," Mr. Otway continued, still gazing into the
  corner, "after the first letters came, I could lie on my left side, because
  then it was behind me and I seemed to feel it drawing me. I had to turn so
  that I could see it; and whenever I looked at it, it seemed to beckon. And so
  it does now."</p>

  <p>"I should have it unscrewed and taken away," said I.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, reflectively, "perhaps it might be&mdash;and yet I
  don't know. Perhaps I might be more restless if it were not there. It is; in
  a way, a satisfaction to know that&mdash;ah&mdash;that I hold a trump card
  that I can play if&mdash;ah&mdash;if all the other cards are against me."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he looked at me with that same curious half-frightened,
  half-exultant expression that made me wonder whether perhaps his inheritance
  included a dash of insanity. Then he rolled back to the middle of the bed and
  lay staring at the ceiling; and by degrees the excitement faded out of his
  face and he recovered his usual stolid gravity of expression.</p>

  <p>Presently he glanced at the little carriage clock that stood on the table,
  and, turning to me, said: "I usually take my veronal about this time. Would
  you mind giving me a glass of water and the tablets?"</p>

  <p>I rose from my chair, and as I did so my little wrist-bag, which had been
  reposing, forgotten, on my lap, slipped to the floor. I picked it up and hung
  it on the knob of the chair-back, and then fetched the water-bottle and
  tumbler from the wash-stand. Having filled the tumbler and handed it to Mr.
  Otway, I picked up the veronal bottle, and seeing that it was a new one,
  broke the seal, withdrew the cork and pulled out the cotton-wool packing.</p>

  <p>"Three tablets, please," said Mr. Otway.</p>

  <p>I handed him the bottle, and as he took it and shook out the three tablets
  he smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"You are the most cautious woman I have ever met," he remarked. "But you
  are quite right to make me responsible for my own poison."</p>

  <p>He took the tablets one at a time, crunching each between his teeth very
  thoroughly before washing it down, with water. Then he mixed what looked to
  me a very stiff allowance of whisky, with a very little soda water, and
  swallowed it at a draught.</p>

  <p>"I find that the stimulant makes the veronal act more rapidly," he
  explained. "I shall be asleep in about half-an-hour. Do you mind staying with
  me until I drop off?"</p>

  <p>I agreed to this, although it was getting late; but, conscious that it was
  probably the last service I should ever render him, I did not feel that I
  could refuse. So I sat down again in the chair and watched him, noting that
  already&mdash;probably as a result of the stimulant&mdash;he was quieter in
  manner and more peaceful in appearance. Even when he reverted to the subject
  that had occasioned my visit, his manner was quite calm.</p>

  <p>"There is something very mysterious about that stick," he remarked.
  "Recalling the circumstances, I remember putting it down in the corner by the
  writing-table. I never saw it again, and never gave its whereabouts a
  thought. I assumed that you had taken it, but I now realise that I was
  mistaken. Apparently it has got into undesirable hands and we haven't heard
  the last of it, I fear."</p>

  <p>"You had better not think any more about it, Mr. Otway," I said. "There is
  nothing to be done, and the less you worry the less harm these people will be
  able to do you."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed; "that is good advice, and I can follow it now. But if I
  should wake up in the small hours of the morning it will be very different.
  That is the worst time, Helen. Then this persecution seems beyond bearing.
  The horror of it makes me sweat with fear. I seem to hear the police on the
  stairs. I find myself listening for the sound of the bell. It is
  horrible&mdash;horrible! And then I think of that wardrobe, unnoticed all
  those weeks, and the figure inside in the dark. And then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He made a motion of his eyes towards the shadowy corner and involuntarily
  I glanced at the great peg high up on the wall.</p>

  <p>He did not speak again for some time, and I sat silently watching him and
  thinking&mdash;thinking of his dreadful heritage and all that it might mean.
  Was it a reality, this legacy of death that he saw coming to him? Was it true
  that even now the black cap hung over his bed? Supposing it were? Supposing
  that this very night, in the chilly middle watch, he should wake with all his
  terrors clutching at his heart! Should creep out of his bed and&mdash;Here my
  glance stole into the shadowy corner, and, as I looked, my mind seemed to
  picture a dim shape filling the wall space below the big, massive peg. There
  were no details and hardly any form; it was just a shape, vague and rather
  horrible. I shivered slightly, but I did not try to blot out the mental
  picture. It was a gruesome thing, that dim, elongated shape, but it did not
  disturb me much; for it set going other associated trains of thought. There
  was the ceremony to-morrow evening, the witnesses with their doubtful rights
  of attestation, protesting that all was in order&mdash;and protesting in
  vain. There were two Ishmaelites going forth hand-in-hand into the
  wilderness, ready to meet scorn with defiance&mdash;but still Ishmaelites.
  And at the thought, the shape upon the wall space below the peg seemed to
  grow less dim, to loom out more distinctly. That shape was Mr.
  Otway&mdash;dead. The late Mr. Otway. No longer a legal impediment, but just
  a fiction that had ceased to exist.</p>

  <p>From the dark corner I turned my eyes on to the living man as he lay
  motionless, breathing softly with an occasional faint snore, and now and
  again puffing out his cheeks. He was not asleep, for I could see his eyes
  open and close at intervals; but he was evidently growing somnolent. I
  watched him with deep interest, almost with fascination, as one might look on
  a condemned man making his last journey in the hangman's cart. This was a
  condemned man, too: a potential suicide. At any moment he might set forth on
  his last journey; and his arrival at his destination would set the
  Ishmaelites free. He was ready to go; but he awaited the determining
  influence that would start him on his journey. What form would that final
  cause take? Would it be some sudden shock of alarm? Or the cumulative effect
  of prolonged, abiding fear?</p>

  <p>I leaned forward and spoke softly to him.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Mr. Otway, what caused your brother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes and looked at me, dully. "What did you say, Helen?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I was wondering if you knew&mdash;if there was anything in particular
  that caused your brother to take his life."</p>

  <p>He cogitated sleepily for a while before replying. At length he answered,
  in a drowsy voice: "I am not very clear about it. He had had a good deal of
  worry of one kind and another, financial and domestic. I don't know that
  anything unusual had occurred; but he had been in a nervous, depressed state
  for some time."</p>

  <p>Having made this reply, Mr. Otway closed his eyes and took a deep breath;
  and I reflected on the significance of his answer. There had apparently been
  no specific cause of his brother's suicide, but just the accumulating effects
  of nervousness and depression, which exploded when they reached a certain
  degree of intensity. His condition, in fact, seemed to have been almost
  identical with Mr. Otway's present condition.</p>

  <p>Once more my eyes wandered away to the shadowy corner; and again the wall
  space below the great hook-like peg became occupied by that elongated shape.
  Now I seemed to visualise it more completely. It was no longer a mere shape.
  It had parts&mdash;recognisable members. There were the limp-dangling arms,
  the downward-pointing toes, the shadowy head lolling sideways. It was very
  horrible, yet I found myself viewing it without horror, but rather with a
  certain detached interest. I was getting used to it, and was disposed to
  consider it in terms of its significance.</p>

  <p>It was not a person. It was a thing which had replaced a person who had
  ceased to exist. That person had had a wife. But the wife had ceased to
  exist, too. In her place was a widow&mdash;a free, unattached woman in whom
  were vested all the rights and liberties of spinsterhood, including the power
  to contract a valid and regular marriage. The shape was an ugly and
  forbidding thing; but it held precious and desirable gifts.</p>

  <p>From the shape projected by my own imagination my eyes turned to the
  actual man&mdash;the man who was convertible into such a shape. He was fast
  asleep now; lying on his back, breathing a little stertorously and blowing
  out his cheeks at each breath. He was an unpleasant spectacle, and the sound
  of his breathing was disagreeable. He ought not to be lying on his back; for
  sleepers who lie on their backs are apt to dream, and dreams are not good for
  men with a tendency to suicide. And sleepers who breathe stertorously are apt
  to dream ugly dreams.</p>

  <p>This consideration set my thoughts working afresh. Supposing this man
  should have a dream presenting his waking terrors with all the added
  intensity and vividness of a nightmare; the heavy footfalls of the police
  upon the stairs, the hands groping in the darkness of the landing for the
  bell-pull! Or if his dream should show him that wardrobe with its dreadful
  occupant! What would happen? And even as I put the question to myself my
  imagination supplied with startling vividness the answering picture. I saw
  the affrighted sleeper suddenly awaken in uncontrollable panic, scramble from
  his bed and shuffle hurriedly towards the corner under the peg.</p>

  <p>The mental construction of the scene was singularly complete and orderly.
  I even found myself filling in the details of the means. There, indeed, was
  the peg. But a man cannot hang himself without some means of suspension. And
  these must be immediately available or the impulse might die away before they
  were found. I glanced around the room to see what means were to hand; and at
  once my eye lighted on an old-fashioned bell-rope that hung beside the head
  of the bed. Its perfect suitability was evident at a glance&mdash;provided
  that it could be detached without ringing the bell. But the necessity for
  cutting it rather than pulling it down would be obvious, even to a
  suicide.</p>

  <p>The means, then, were all ready to hand. And there was the man, charged
  with this self-destructive tendency, sleeping in the very posture calculated
  to start it into action.</p>

  <p>I sat still, watching him with absorbing interest, and as these thoughts
  shaped themselves with more and more distinctness, an impulse of which I was
  barely conscious formed itself and steadily grew in intensity. At length I
  leaned forward and spoke in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Otway, you should not lie in that position."</p>

  <p>There was no answer, and he made no sign. The heavy breathing went on with
  uninterrupted regularity, the eyes remained closed. Again I spoke, this time
  more loudly, clearly and distinctly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Otway, can you hear me? If you lie as you are lying, you will
  probably dream. You may have bad, dangerous dreams. You may dream of your
  mother and your brother. You may dream that the peg on the wall is beckoning
  to you. And then you may wake in a panic and think that the peg is still
  beckoning. And then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I stopped suddenly. What was this that I was doing? Was it a warning to
  avert disaster? So the words were framed. But I knew it was nothing of the
  kind. It was suggestion, pure and almost undisguised. The dreadful truth
  struck me like a blow and seemed to turn me into stone. I sat rigid as a
  statue, still leaning forward with my lips parted as if to complete that
  awful sentence, every moment more appalled by this frightful thing that I had
  done. There came to me in a flash a vision of my own automatism after the
  sance; I heard Lilith telling me how the sleep of the drugged resembles the
  hypnotic trance; and again it came to me how I had been sitting looking at
  that terrible peg on the wall and&mdash;without conscious
  intention&mdash;creating by my will the awful shape beneath it.</p>

  <p>How long I should have sat, bent forward as if frozen into rigid
  immobility by the horror of this hideous thing, it is impossible to say. The
  realization of what I had done, that had fallen on me like a thunderbolt, had
  petrified me in a posture of arrested action. It seemed to have deprived me
  of the power of movement.</p>

  <p>The place was intensely silent. The monotonous breathing of the sleeping
  man&mdash;the snoring intake alternating with the soft, blowing
  expiration&mdash;made no impression on the profound quiet, and the rapid
  ticking of the little carriage clock on the table seemed only to make it more
  intense.</p>

  <p>Suddenly something stirred in the outer room. I sprang to my feet with a
  gasp that had almost been a shriek. Probably it was only Mrs. Gregg, but in
  my overwrought state the sound was vaguely alarming. I stood for a few
  moments, my heart thumping and my breath coming short and fast; then I stole
  on tip-toe across the room and softly opening the door, peered into the outer
  room. It was in darkness except that a bright beam of moonlight poured in at
  the window; but this gave enough light to show that there was nobody in the
  room.</p>

  <p>Still fearful of I knew not what, I stepped softly through the doorway and
  looked about me suspiciously. The moonlight struck on a large cupboard or
  wardrobe, which instantly suggested the lurking-place of some eavesdropper
  and at the same time aroused horrible associations connected with Mr. Otway's
  brother; so that, in spite of my alarm, I was impelled to pluck at the handle
  to satisfy myself that no figure was hidden within. But the cupboard was
  locked, or, at any rate, would not open.</p>

  <p>Then I looked under the table and peered into the darker corners of the
  room, growing&mdash;naturally&mdash;more and more nervous every moment, and
  pausing from time to time to listen, or to look back through the doorway into
  the bedroom, where I could see Mr. Otway lying motionless like a sepulchral
  effigy.</p>

  <p>Suddenly something stirred softly quite near to me&mdash;the sound seemed
  to come from the cupboard. I could have screamed with terror. The last
  vestige of my self-possession was gone, and in sheer panic I fled across the
  room and down the corridor to the entrance lobby. This place was in utter
  darkness, and as I frantically groped for the latch, I felt my skin creep and
  break out into a chilly sweat. At last I found the latch, dragged the door
  open and darted out; and as the clang of the closing door filled the building
  with hollow echoes, I ran swiftly down the stairs.</p>

  <p>Once out in the inhabited streets, my alarm subsided somewhat; but still
  the image of that motionless figure in the bedroom, the sinister-looking peg
  on the wall and the recollection of those dreadful words that I had spoken
  into the sleeper's ears pursued me with an abiding horror. I walked quickly
  out into the Strand, and I was in the act of hailing a cab when I remembered
  that I had left my wrist-bag hanging on the chair-back by Mr. Otway's
  bedside. My purse was in that bag. But if it had contained my entire worldly
  possessions I could not have summoned up courage enough to go back for
  it.</p>

  <p>The cab drew up by the kerb. I hesitated a moment, but reflecting that it
  was yet hardly ten o'clock, and that someone would be waiting up from whom I
  could borrow the fare, I gave the cabman the address, with the necessary
  explanations, entered the cab and shut the door. But as the crazy
  vehicle&mdash;it was an ancient four-wheeler&mdash;rattled over the uneven
  roadways of the side streets, the scene in that warm and stuffy bedroom was
  re-enacted again and again. And yet again I looked on that ill omened
  cupboard in the ghostly moonlight; speculated on the mysterious sounds in the
  living-room; wondered uncomfortably if there had been a watcher or a
  listener, and if so, whether that eavesdropper knew the meaning of silent
  willing and suggestion.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2-22"
     id="ch-2-22"></a>XXII.&mdash; THE CATASTROPHE</h2>

  <p class="first">VIEWED by the cheerful light of the morning sun as it
  streamed in through my bedroom window, the phantoms of the previous night
  dwindled to mere scarecrows. On the panic-stricken state in which I had fled
  from Mr. Otway's chambers I was now disposed to look back with faint
  amusement. Even the words which I had spoken into Mr. Otway's ears as he
  slept had no longer any terrifying significance, though I had to admit that
  they were not susceptible of any satisfactory interpretation. They had been
  spoken under the influence of an impulse which I could not account for, and
  did not care to examine too closely, but which I vaguely connected with my
  excursions into psychical research&mdash;a subject which I decided to avoid
  as far as possible in the future.</p>

  <p>As to Mr. Otway, if his account of his family was correct, it seemed quite
  probable that, sooner or later, he would make away with himself, though,
  seeing that he was now well past middle life, the propensity could hardly be
  as strong as he had represented it. On the other hand, he was now being
  subjected to a very excessive nervous strain, and was undoubtedly letting his
  mind run on the subject of suicide. If the blackmailers continued to keep up
  an increasing pressure, as they seemed inclined to do, the breaking-point
  might be reached quite soon. And I could not disguise from myself that the
  catastrophe, if and when it occurred, would not present itself to me as a
  personal misfortune.</p>

  <p>With this I dismissed Mr. Otway and his affairs, and let my thoughts roam
  into more attractive regions. For this was the day of days. In a matter of a
  few hours my separation from Jasper would be at an end. We should be united,
  never again to part.</p>

  <p>As I rose and dressed, this was the burden of my thoughts. The weeks of
  separation and loneliness were gone, and the hours that lay between the
  present and that final meeting were running out apace like the grains of sand
  in an hour glass that is nearly spent. I hurried over breakfast that I might
  the sooner escape to be alone with my happiness; and most of the morning I
  spent in the workshop, arranging my apparatus so that it might easily be
  packed, in case I should not come back to superintend the removal myself. The
  candlestick, which was finished and successful beyond my expectations, I took
  upstairs to place in my trunk that I might give it to Jasper this very day.
  And then I paid a visit to my friend Peggy, whom I found in her workshop
  chirruping gaily and very busy making a complicated set of plaster moulds
  from the dissected wax model of her masterpiece. But I did not stay long with
  her, for the making of piece-moulds is an engrossing occupation and one
  better followed in solitude.</p>

  <p>As I entered the house from the garden I encountered our little housemaid
  with a telegram in her hand.</p>

  <p>"This has just come for you, ma'am," said she, holding it out towards me.
  "The boy is waiting to see if there is any answer."</p>

  <p>I suppose that to most persons unaccustomed to receiving telegrams, the
  appearance of the peremptory, orange-tinted envelope is a little portentous.
  Especially so was it to me at that moment, with the crisis of my life so near
  at hand; and my heart beat tumultuously as I tore open the envelope and
  unfolded the flimsy paper. It bore but a brief message; but when I had read
  that message, the joy of life, the half-timorous happiness that had come to
  me with the morning sunlight, went out in a moment, like a wind-blown taper,
  and left me desolate.</p>
  <br>

  <p class="telegram">
  "CANCEL APPOINTMENT FOR TO-DAY AND DO NOT COME TO THE CLUB. LETTER
  FOLLOWS. JASPER."</p>
  <br>

  <p>That was all. There was really nothing very alarming in it. But to me it
  came as a dreadful anti-climax, strung up, as I was, to the highest pitch of
  nervous tension. With a trembling hand I refolded the paper, and, having told
  the maid that there was no answer, ran up to my room and bolted myself
  in.</p>

  <p>It was a terrible blow. Only now, by the bitterness of the disappointment,
  did I realise the heart-hunger that I had endured, the intense yearning for
  the moment in which my beloved companion would be restored to me. And then,
  beyond this sudden collapse of my happiness, almost in the moment of its
  realisation, was the mystery, the suspense, the uncertainty. What could it be
  that had happened? Had Jasper's condition suddenly grown worse? That could
  hardly be, for he was practically well&mdash;at least, he had so regarded
  himself&mdash;and moreover there was that cryptic reference to the club. Why
  must I not go to the club?</p>

  <p>There was something very mysterious in that prohibition! The more I
  reflected on the matter the more puzzling did it appear. On the other hand,
  the very mystery in which the affair was shrouded was itself a relief. For,
  of course, I never for one moment had the faintest doubt of Jasper's loyalty,
  nor could I entertain the possibility of his having changed his views on the
  subject of our marriage. Some thing had occurred to hinder it; but Jasper was
  my own and I was his, and that being so, the hindrance, whatever it might be,
  could be but temporary.</p>

  <p>So I comforted myself and made believe that all was well, though when by
  chance my eye lighted on the trunk, packed and even provided with a blank
  label, I could hardly keep back the tears. At lunch I let Miss Polton know
  that my visit was postponed, and immediately after the meal I prepared to go
  out and seek relief in a long, sharp walk. By the time I returned, the letter
  from Jasper would probably have arrived and I should know how matters
  stood.</p>

  <p>I had put on my outdoor clothes and was just about to start, when, opening
  the drawer in which I kept my wrist-bag, I suddenly remembered my loss of the
  night before. The bag contained, not only my purse, but my card-case and one
  or two other things I could not conveniently do without. The prohibition to
  go to the club could hardly, I reflected, extend to Lyon's Inn Chambers,
  though they were in the same neighbourhood. At any rate, I wanted the bag,
  and in my restless state a journey with a defined purpose offered more relief
  than an aimless walk through the streets.</p>

  <p>During the short journey from Mark Lane to the Temple I turned over and
  over again the words of the telegram without obtaining any glimmer of
  enlightenment. If I had been less sure of Jasper, I should have been
  intensely wretched; but now, as the shock subsided, my optimism revived and I
  found myself looking forward to Jasper's letter with a confident expectation
  of reassuring news.</p>

  <p>Emerging from the Temple Station, I walked up Arundel Street, and,
  crossing the Strand, presently passed through Half-Moon Alley and cast a
  glance of friendly recognition at the old gilded sign, so pleasantly
  associated with the scarlet parasol that hung outside the umbrella-maker's
  shop in Bookseller's Row. The two signs recalled the old delightful
  explorations with Jasper, and put me in quite a cheerful frame of mind, which
  lasted until I found myself once more ascending the bare and rather sordid
  stone stairs of Lyon's Inn Chambers. Then there came a marked change. As I
  walked up the cold, gloomy staircase a feeling of depression settled on me. I
  passed the grimy lantern that had looked on my head-long, terror-stricken
  flight, and some of the forgotten qualms came back. I breathed again the
  close air of that unpleasant bedroom; I saw again the unwieldy figure in the
  bed, with its pasty face and puffy eyelids; and even the sinister-looking peg
  on the wall came forth with uncomfortable vividness from the recesses of
  memory. By the time I reached the landing, my distaste for the place had
  grown so strong that I was half inclined to turn back and complete the
  transaction by means of a letter.</p>

  <p>This weakness, however, I overcame by an effort of will and resolutely
  rang the bell. There was a short interval and then the door opened, revealing
  the figure of Mrs. Gregg, who, according to her custom, stood and stared
  stonily at me without uttering a word.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Mrs. Gregg," said I. "When I went away last night I left
  my wrist-bag behind."</p>

  <p>"Ye did," she answered; "and ye left the bedroom door open and the gas
  full on. I found it so this morning."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," I said.</p>

  <p>"'Tis no matter," she rejoined, impassively, and continued to stare at me
  in a most singular and embarrassing fashion.</p>

  <p>"Could I have my bag, please, Mrs. Gregg?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Ye could," she replied; but still she made no move nor any suggestion
  that I should enter; and still continued to look at me with the strangest,
  most enigmatic expression.</p>

  <p>"I hope," said I, by way of relieving the extraordinarily uncomfortable
  situation, "that Mr. Otway is better today."</p>

  <p>"Do ye?" said she; and then, after a pause, "Maybe ye'd wish to see
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think I will disturb him, thank you," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Ye need have no fear," said she. "Ye'll no wake him."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't think I have time to see him to-day. I just called to get
  my bag."</p>

  <p>"And is that all ye've come for?" she demanded, glowering at me in the
  most astonishing manner.</p>

  <p>"What else should I have come for?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She thrust her head forward and replied in a mysterious tone: "I thought
  maybe ye'd come to ask where your husband is."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you, Mrs. Gregg. Is Mr. Otway not at home?"</p>

  <p>"He is not," she replied; and as I made no answer she asked: "Shall I tell
  you where he is?"</p>

  <p>"It really isn't any business of mine, Mrs. Gregg," said I.</p>

  <p>"Is it not?" she demanded. "Will it no interest ye if I tell ye that your
  husband is in St. Clement's Mortuary?"</p>

  <p>"In the mortuary!" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"Aye, in the mortuary." She glared at me in silence for a few moments, and
  then, suddenly grasping my arm, exclaimed: "Woman! do ye ken yon peg on the
  bedroom wall? Aye, ye may well turn pale. Ye'd ha' turned paler if ye'd seen
  what I saw by the gaslight this morn hangin' from yon peg."</p>

  <p>I gazed at her for a few moments in speechless horror, until she seemed to
  sway and shimmer before my eyes. Then, for the first and only time in my
  life, I must have fainted, for I remember no more until I found myself lying
  on the floor of the lobby, with Mrs. Gregg kneeling beside me slapping my
  face with a wet towel.</p>

  <p>I rose with difficulty, feeling very weak and shaken. Mrs. Gregg silently
  handed me my bag and preceded me towards I he door, where, with her hand on
  the latch, she turned and faced me.</p>

  <p>"Weel, mistress," said she, "'tis a fit ending, seeing how it began. Ye've
  been a poor wife, but ye'll make a bonny widow, though I doubt it will stay
  long at that."</p>

  <p>To this insolent and brutal speech I made no reply. I was completely
  broken, physically and mentally. I tottered out on to the landing and slowly
  descended the stairs, holding on to the iron hand-rail, my horror of the
  place urging me to hasten away, my trembling limbs and lingering faintness
  bidding me go warily. As I walked unsteadily up Holywell Street, a newspaper
  boy, running down the narrow thoroughfare, halted and held out a paper.</p>

  <p>"Here y'are, Miss, sooicide in Lyon's Inn. The housekeeper's story."</p>

  <p>I hurried past him with averted face, but out in the Strand there were
  others, shouting aloud the dreadful tidings or displaying posters on which
  the hideous fact was set forth in enormous type. And it seemed as if each and
  all of them were specially addressing themselves to me. I returned down
  Arundel Street, instinctively making for the station, but as I approached it
  a fresh group of newsboys made me swerve to the left and pursue my way along
  the Embankment on foot.</p>

  <p>As I walked on, and the air and exercise helped me to recover physically
  from the shock, I began to collect my faculties. At first I had been utterly
  bewildered and overborne by a sense of horror and guilt. I had sent this
  wretched man to his death. I had ordained the means, the manner and the time
  of his death, and it had duly befallen according to my directions.
  Morally&mdash;and perhaps even legally&mdash;it amounted to murder. I had
  willed, I had suggested; and that which I had willed and suggested had come
  to pass. That was what had flashed into my mind in the very moment in which
  Mrs. Gregg had made her dreadful communication.</p>

  <p>But now, as I walked on, I began to argue the case in my own favour. In
  the first place, I told myself, it was not certain that the act of the dead
  man had any connection with the willing or the suggestion. It might have been
  a mere coincidence. I tried to dwell on this view; but it would not do. The
  coincidence was too complete to be explained away by any such casuistry. I
  could not in this way escape the responsibility for Mr. Otway's death.</p>

  <p>Then I considered the question of intention. I told
  myself&mdash;truthfully enough&mdash;that I had not consciously willed that
  Mr. Otway should kill himself. I had not even been conscious of any intention
  to suggest to him that he should kill himself. But though I did make some
  sort of point in my own defence, it was extremely unconvincing I had allowed
  my mind to dwell with hardly-disguised satisfaction on the possibility of his
  suicide (in a particular manner at a particular time), and between that and
  actual willing the distinction was not very obvious. And then there were
  those words, spoken to him in his sleep. It was not conscious, deliberate
  suggestion; but what was it? The impulse to speak those words was apparently
  evolved from the subconscious. But does no moral responsibility attach to
  subconscious intentions?</p>

  <p>So I argued, back and forth, round and about; but always came back to the
  same conclusion. Mr. Otway was dead; and it was my act that sent him to his
  death. Locked up in my own breast this dreadful secret might remain; but it
  was my companion for life. There was no escape from it.</p>

  <p>But would it remain locked up in my own breast? That was another question
  that began to loom up with a very real menace. How much did Mrs. Gregg know?
  She might easily have overheard our conversation and even those final, fatal
  words. And if she had, would she understand their significance? Now that I
  came to consider the circumstances, there was something rather alarming in
  the manner of this inscrutable woman; something threatening and accusatory
  which I had vaguely felt at the time. And as I reflected on this and the
  possibilities that it suggested, a fear of something more substantial than my
  own accusing conscience began to creep around my heart.</p>

  <p>When I arrived home, Jasper's letter was awaiting me. But it contained
  nothing new. He had seen the posters, had bought an early paper and had
  immediately sent off the telegram. His tone was that of matter-of-fact
  satisfaction. The legal impediment to our marriage had now been removed. No
  declarations were necessary now. We could marry like other people. We were
  free.</p>

  <p>That was the burden of the letter. All our troubles were at an end. Until
  everything was settled, we had better avoid meeting. But when the chapter was
  closed with all due formalities we could sing "Nunc dimittis," and
  thenceforth live only for one another.</p>

  <p>I laid the letter down. All that it said was true. The picture that my
  imagination had drawn under the guidance of desire as I had sat looking into
  the shadowy corner of the bedroom in Lyon's Inn had become a reality. The
  fetters that I had forged and put on that fatal morning in the little church
  at Maidstone, had fallen off and given me back my freedom.</p>

  <p>And even as I told myself this, some voice from within seemed to whisper a
  caveat, and my heart was sensible of a chill of fear.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-3"
     id="ch-3"></a>BOOK III. &mdash; CRIME</h2>

  <h2><a name="ch-3-23"
     id="ch-3-23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; THE DEAD HAND</h2>

  <p class="first">THE entry of Mr. Otway into my life inaugurated a long
  succession of disasters. The very first words that I heard him speak
  shattered the peace of a lifetime. Thence-forward, like the Ancient Mariner,
  I was haunted by a malign influence which seemed to exhale continuously from
  his ill-omened personality. And even now that he was dead that malignant
  spirit was not at rest. His very corpse, lying in the mortuary, was a centre
  whence radiated sinister influences that crept into my secret soul and
  enveloped me from without. During his life Mr. Otway had been my evil genius;
  and death had but transformed him into a malicious poltergeist.</p>

  <p>His first, tentative appearance in this character was made on the very
  evening of my second visit to Lyon's Inn Chambers, when the coroner's officer
  called at Wellclose Square to serve the subpoena for the inquest. The
  announcement of his arrival caused me some qualms of vague alarm, which I
  knew in my heart to be nothing but the stirring of my own conscience. For the
  purpose of this inquest was to find an answer to the question, "How did Lewis
  Otway come by his death?" And that question I could have answered in four
  words&mdash;Silent Willing and Suggestion. But I had no intention of
  answering that question; and hence, as I entered the room into which the
  officer had been shown, I was consciously on the defensive.</p>

  <p>I had, however, no occasion to be. The officer was a civil, fatherly man
  in a constable's uniform, sympathetic, deferential and not at all
  inquisitive.</p>

  <p>"I have called, ma'am," he began, "on a very sad errand. I don't know
  whether you have heard the dreadful news&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of Mr. Otway's death?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Ah! then you have heard. That is a relief. Well, I have called to let you
  know that the inquest is arranged for the day after to-morrow, at 3 p.m. in
  the room adjoining the mortuary." He gave me a few explicit directions as to
  how to find the latter and then added: "If there is any information that you
  could give us that would guide us in starting the inquiry, we should be glad.
  Or the names of any witnesses that we ought to subpoena."</p>

  <p>I reflected. The threatening letters must necessarily be referred to at
  the inquest. I should have to mention them myself, even if Mrs. Gregg knew
  nothing of them.</p>

  <p>"I happen to know," I replied, "that Mr. Otway had received a number of
  anonymous letters and that he was greatly worried about them."</p>

  <p>"Blackmailing letters?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't think any demands for money were made," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what was their nature? Were they threatening letters?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indirectly. The two or three that I saw had reference to the death
  of my father, who died very suddenly and who was alone with Mr. Otway at the
  time. They suggested a suspicion that Mr. Otway was responsible for my
  father's death."</p>

  <p>The officer looked at me quickly and then became deeply reflective.</p>

  <p>"Will it be possible to produce those letters at the inquest?" he asked,
  after a cogitative pause.</p>

  <p>"They are not in my possession," I answered; "but if the coroner will make
  an order for their production I will endeavour to have it carried out."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, ma'am," said he; and then, as an after-thought, added: "If you
  could make it convenient to call at the coroner's office to-morrow, say at
  about two o'clock, I could give you the order and perhaps help you to carry
  it out."</p>

  <p>The latter suggestion appealed to me strongly and I fell in with it at
  once. Thereupon the officer picked up his helmet with an air of satisfaction,
  and, having handed me the subpoena, moved towards the door. I accompanied him
  along the hall and let him out; and as I wished him good evening and launched
  him down the steps, another figure emerged from the darkness and passed him
  on the way up.</p>

  <p>"Does Mrs. Otway live here?" the newcomer enquired. I glanced at him with
  faint suspicion, for the exact incidence in time of his arrival with the
  officer's departure suggested a connection between the two events.</p>

  <p>"I am Mrs. Otway," said I.</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed! Could I have a few words with you on a matter of some
  importance? I will not detain you more than a few minutes."</p>

  <p>I hesitated, eyeing my new visitor dubiously. But there were no reasonable
  grounds for a refusal; and I eventually ushered him into the little parlour
  that the officer had just left, and indicated the vacant chair.</p>

  <p>"The matter concerning which I have taken the liberty of calling on you,
  Mrs. Otway," said he, "is connected with&mdash;er&mdash;with the painful
  occurrence&mdash;er&mdash;at Lyon's Inn Chambers. A most deplorable affair.
  Most distressing for you&mdash;most distressing! Pray accept my sincere
  sympathy."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hyams is my name&mdash;you may have heard your late husband speak of me.
  We have been acquainted a good many years."</p>

  <p>"He has never spoken of you to me, Mr. Hyams. But what can I do for
  you?</p>

  <p>"Well, I can put my business in a nut-shell. Your husband, at the time of
  his death, had certain valuable property of mine in his possession. I should
  like to get that property back without delay."</p>

  <p>He had certainly wasted no time. Unsentimental as was my own attitude I
  felt this haste to be almost indecent.</p>

  <p>"I should think you will have no difficulty," said I, "if you apply in the
  proper quarter."</p>

  <p>"That is what I am doing," he retorted. "You are is widow. His property is
  in your hands."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," I replied. "Pending probate of the will, the property is
  vested in his executors."</p>

  <p>He looked at me in not unnatural astonishment. I suppose the phraseology
  that I had acquired from my father was unusual for a woman.</p>

  <p>"Who are the executors?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I replied.</p>

  <p>"But," said he, "I suppose you have seen the will."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't know that there is a will. I am only assuming the existence
  of one from my knowledge of Mr. Otway's business-like habits."</p>

  <p>"But this is very unsatisfactory," said Mr. Hyams. "There is portable
  property of mine worth several thousand pounds lying in his chambers for
  anyone to pick up, and those chambers in charge of a woman who probably has
  access to his keys. It really isn't business, you know."</p>

  <p>"What is the nature of the property?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is a collection of very valuable stones, the who lot contained in a
  little box that anyone could carry away in his pocket."</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, "the probability is that he has deposited the box with his
  bankers."</p>

  <p>"Who are his bankers?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I really don't know."</p>

  <p>"You don't know!" he exclaimed. "But you must have seen his cheques. I
  presume he made you an allowance?"</p>

  <p>"I accepted no allowance from him and I have never seen one of his
  cheques."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hyams looked at me with undisguised incredulity, "A most extraordinary
  state of affairs," he commented. "Can you give me the address of his
  lawyers?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Mr. Hyams, that I cannot. I don't even know if he has a
  lawyer. I know nothing whatever about Mr. Otway's affairs."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hyams' countenance took on an expression that was very much the
  reverse of pleasant. "I suppose, Mrs Otway," said he, "you realise that you
  are talking to a man of business and that you are telling a rather unlikely
  story.</p>

  <p>"I realise it very clearly, Mr. Hyams," I replied, "and I realise also the
  difficulty of your position. What I recommend you to do is to go to Lyon's
  Inn and see the housekeeper, Mrs. Gregg. She has been with Mr. Otway many
  years and can probably tell you all that you want to know."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hyams shut his mouth tightly, rose deliberately and picked up his
  hat.</p>

  <p>"Then," said he, "the position, as I understand it, is this: You don't
  know whether there is or is not a will; you don't know the name of your
  husband's bankers; you don't know who his lawyer is; you don't know anything
  about his affairs; and you disclaim any responsibility in regard to property
  that was in his custody when he died."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "that is the position; a very unsatisfactory one for you,
  I must admit. Perhaps I may be able to help you later, when I know more about
  Mr. Otway's affairs. Will you leave me your address?"</p>

  <p>He was on the point of refusing, but prudence triumphed over anger and he
  laid on the table a card on which I read the name, "David Hyams, Dealer in
  precious stones," and the address, "501, Hatton Garden."</p>

  <p>"If I learn anything fresh I will write to you," I said; whereupon he
  thanked me curtly and gruffly and walked towards the door with pursed-up lips
  and a lowering, truculent expression and took his departure without another
  word.</p>

  <p>When he was gone I reflected at some length on the significance of his
  visit. The interview had brought home to me very vividly my anomalous
  position. Mr. Otway had been a total stranger to me. Of his past, of his
  recent habits and mode of life, his friends, his occupation&mdash;if he had
  any&mdash;his family and social status, I knew nothing. My father had
  referred to him as a retired solicitor and as a collector of, or dealer in,
  precious stones. Vaguely, I had conceived him as a man of some means
  &mdash;perhaps a rich man. But I knew nothing of him and had given him and
  his affairs barely a thought. He was a stranger who had come into my life for
  but a moment, and had straightway gone out again, leaving a trail of
  desolation to show where he had been.</p>

  <p>That was the real position. But to strangers to the world at large, it
  would seem incredible. I was Mr. Otway's widow. I had been his wife in law if
  not in fact. And the world would hold me to the legal relationship. The dead
  man, lying in the mortuary, seemed about to make good the claims that the
  living man had been forced to abandon. My status as a wife had been a mere
  fiction: my status as a widow was an undeniable reality.</p>

  <p>The clear perception of the extent to which I was involved in the dead
  man's affairs gave my visit to the coroner's office a new importance. For
  now, while seeking information for official use at the inquest, I must gather
  what knowledge I could for my own guidance under cover of the coroner's
  order. The address of the office&mdash;in Blackmoor Street, Drury
  Lane&mdash;was printed on the subpoena, and there, after a few enquiries, I
  made my appearance punctually on the following day.</p>

  <p>My friend of the previous evening&mdash;whose name I discovered to be
  Smallwood&mdash;was in the office, looking over some documents with the aid
  of a pair of spectacles, which gave him a curiously unconstabulary aspect. He
  rose when I entered, and, opening a drawer, took out a sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>"This is what you asked for, Mrs. Otway," said he (upon which a young man
  at a desk looked up quickly), "the coroner's request for the production of
  the letters that you told me about. Can I give you any other assistance?"</p>

  <p>"If you could accompany me to the chambers and be present during the
  search for the letters, I should be glad," I replied. "You see," I added,
  seeing that he looked somewhat surprised, "I am almost a stranger to the
  housekeeper, I know nothing about the household or Mr. Otway's arrangements,
  and I shall be accountable to the executors if there are any, for any
  interference with the papers or their removal. I should very much prefer to
  have a reliable witness."</p>

  <p>He saw the position at once, and, greatly to my relief, agreed to come
  with me, or rather to follow me in a few minutes. Thereupon I left the office
  and walking at a leisurely pace into Drury Lane presently made my way into
  the Strand by way of May-pole Alley and turned eastward towards Lyon's Inn
  Chambers.</p>

  <p>At the entrance I waited for a minute or two and then slowly ascended the
  stairs to Mr. Otway's landing, growing more and more uncomfortable with every
  step. For the bare stone staircase set my memory working very unpleasantly,
  recalling again my headlong flight and the terrible episode that had preceded
  it&mdash;that episode that would so gladly have sponged out of my
  recollection for ever.</p>

  <p>I stood at the door with my hand on the bell, listening for Mr.
  Smallwood's steps on the stair, and so might have remained until he arrived;
  but suddenly the door opened and Mrs. Gregg confronted me. Apparently she had
  some means of observing a visitor from within.</p>

  <p>"What are ye standing there for?" she demanded. "Why did ye not ring?"</p>

  <p>"I was just about to ring when you opened the door," I replied.</p>

  <p>She smiled sourly and looked at me in that strange, inscrutable fashion of
  hers that I found so disconcerting.</p>

  <p>"And what might your business be?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I have come about some letters of Mr. Otway's&mdash;some anonymous
  letters that he has received from time to time. Perhaps you know about
  them?</p>

  <p>"You mean, perhaps I have been in the habit of reading his letters. Weel,
  mistress, I have not. I know nothing about his letters."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you can show me where his letters were kept."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I'll do no such thing. What! Do you think I'll have you
  scratching up in his chambers and pawing over his letters and papers and him
  not under-ground yet?"</p>

  <p>At this moment I caught the welcome sound of footsteps on the stairs. Mrs.
  Gregg listened suspiciously, and as Mr. Smallwood came into sight there was a
  visible change in her demeanour.</p>

  <p>"What does he want, I wonder?" she said.</p>

  <p>"He has come to receive the letters and to be present at the search for
  them," I replied, producing the coroner's order. She glanced at the paper,
  and, as Mr. Smallwood stepped up to the door, she motioned us to enter.</p>

  <p>"Come in," she said, gruffly. "'Tis no affair of mine, but I'll no hinder
  ye."</p>

  <p>We were just about to enter when footsteps were again audible on the
  stairs, and we waited to see who this other visitor might be. Somewhat to my
  surprise it turned out to be Mr. Hyams, who certainly seemed to have a genius
  for coincidences.</p>

  <p>"Now this is quite a lucky chance," said he, doing himself, as I
  suspected, less than justice. "I didn't expect to find you here, Mrs. Otway.
  I presume you are just having a look round."</p>

  <p>"I have come to search for some documents that have to be put in
  evidence," said I. "The coroner has asked for them."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Hyams, "you might, at the same time, see if you can find
  any trace of my property."</p>

  <p>"What property is that?" demanded Mrs. Gregg.</p>

  <p>"A parcel of stones&mdash;a very valuable collection&mdash;that Mr. Otway
  had from me on approval."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gregg snorted. "Man," said she, "ye're talkin' like a fool. Do you
  suppose Lewis Otway would have left a valuable parcel of stones lying about
  in his rooms like a packet of snuff? Ye'll find no stones here."</p>

  <p>"That may or may not be," said Mr. Hyams. "At any rate, I'll stay and see
  if anything turns up."</p>

  <p>During this dialogue we had gradually moved from the lobby down the
  corridor and now entered the living-room. As we crossed it I looked curiously
  at the large cupboard and wondered idly what I could have found so alarming
  in its appearance on the night of my visit. But if the living-room had, by
  the light of day, lost its disturbing qualities, it was otherwise with the
  bedroom. I opened the door with trepidation, and as I did so and was
  confronted by the disordered bed, the horror of the place began to come back
  to me. Nevertheless, I entered the room with a firm step and with my eyes on
  the bedside table, which appeared to be in the same condition as when I had
  last seen it. I had just noted this when I felt my arm grasped, and turning
  quickly found Mrs. Gregg at my side. Her eyes were fixed on me and with her
  disengaged hand she was pointing towards the corner by the bed-head.
  Involuntarily my gaze followed the direction in which she was pointing and
  lighted on the fatal peg, which now bore a loop of the red bell-rope with two
  free ends. Of course I had known it was there, but yet the sight of it made
  me turn sick and faint, and I must have shown this in the sudden pallor of my
  face; for when, controlling myself by an intense effort, I turned to speak to
  her she was looking at me with a leer of triumph.</p>

  <p>"Can we have Mr. Otway's keys?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Ye'll find them in the right dressing-table drawer," she answered. "I'm
  no party to this, but I'll no hinder ye."</p>

  <p>Mr. Smallwood opened the drawer and produced a bunch of keys which he
  handed to me. I looked them over and selecting the most likely-looking ones,
  tried them, one after the other, on the deed-box. The fourth key fitted the
  lock, and when I had turned it and raised the lid of the box, the letter
  which Mr. Otway had shown me lay in full view. I took it out and laid it on
  the table and then proceeded to lift out the remaining contents of the box.
  There was not much to remove: a cheque-book, a pass-book, a small journal, a
  memorandum book, a bundle of share-certificates, a canvas bag containing
  money, and at the bottom of the box a foolscap envelope endorsed, "Anonymous
  Letters."</p>

  <p>I opened the unsealed envelope and drew out the letters which I glanced
  through one by one. There were seven in all, of which I had already seen
  three. When I had looked at them I returned them to the envelope, adding the
  last letter, and then began to replace the other things in the box.</p>

  <p>"I see a cheque-book there, Mrs. Otway," said Mr. Hyams, who had followed
  my proceedings with intense interest. "May I make a note of the banker's
  address?"</p>

  <p>I handed him the cheque-book and continued to replace the contents of the
  box. When I had finished I paused with the box open, waiting for him to
  return the cheque-book; and at this moment I became aware, with a start of
  surprise, that an addition had been made to our party.</p>

  <p>The new-comer was a short, stout, middle-aged man, obviously a Jew of the
  swarthy, aquiline type, with a very large nose and rather prominent dark
  eyes. He stood in the open doorway of the bedroom watching us with a slightly
  unpleasant smile. As he noted my surprised look his smile became broader and
  more unpleasant.</p>

  <p>"Make yourselves at home, ladies and gentlemen," said he. "These are
  public premises&mdash;at least I assume they are, as I found the door
  open."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hyams looked round with a start&mdash;as, indeed, did the others.</p>

  <p>"May I ask who you are, sir?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"You may," was the suave reply. "My name is Isaacs&mdash;of the firm of
  Isaacs and Cohen, solicitors. I am one of the executors of Mr. Lewis Otway's
  will. And having regard to my responsibilities in that capacity, I may,
  perhaps, venture to enquire as to the nature of these proceedings. You, sir,
  appear to be in possession of the testator's cheque-book. Did you happen to
  require the loan of a fountain pen?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hyams turned very red and hastily laid down the cheque-book.</p>

  <p>"That," he exclaimed angrily, "is perfectly unwarranted. I was simply
  making a note of the banker's address."</p>

  <p>"With what object?"</p>

  <p>"With the object of enquiring whether certain property of mine, which was
  in Mr. Otway's custody, had been deposited in the bank."</p>

  <p>"What is the nature and value of this property?" asked Mr. Isaacs.</p>

  <p>"It is a collection of precious stones of the approximate value of four
  thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Mr. Isaacs, "I can give you the information you want. No
  property, other than documents, has been deposited at the bank."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Mr. Hyams, "the stones must be in these rooms."</p>

  <p>"It is quite probable," Mr. Isaacs agreed.</p>

  <p>"Is there any objection to ascertaining, now, whether they are here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is," replied Mr. Isaacs. "The will has not been proved and no
  letters of administration have been issued. Pending probate of the will I
  propose to take possession of these premises and seal all receptacles that
  may contain valuable property. I shall interfere with nothing until I have
  letters of administration."</p>

  <p>"And how soon will that be?" asked Mr. Hyams.</p>

  <p>"Seven days must elapse before the will can be proved. Under the
  circumstances there may be some further delay. And now I should like to know
  what has been taking place. You, for instance, madam&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am Mrs. Lewis Otway," said I, "and I have come here by the coroner's
  direction, to look for some letters that are to be put in evidence."</p>

  <p>"Have you found them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, "they are here; and, as you are an executor, I had
  better hand them to you, and you can deliver them to the coroner's officer if
  you think fit."</p>

  <p>I handed him the envelope and the coroner's letter, which he read, and
  then asked: "Did you have to make a very extensive search?"</p>

  <p>"No, she didn't," said Mrs. Gregg. "She kenned fine where to look for them
  and she found them at the first cast."</p>

  <p>On this I noticed that Mr. Hyams cast a quick, suspicious glance at me and
  I thought it wise to explain.</p>

  <p>"I looked first in this box because I had seen Mr. Otway put one of these
  letters into it."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Mr. Isaacs. "Very natural." But obvious as the
  explanation was, I could see that it had left Mr. Hyams unconvinced.</p>

  <p>I now returned the cheque-book to the deed-box, locked the latter and
  handed the keys to Mr. Isaacs; who delivered the anonymous letters to the
  coroner's officer and took his receipt for them on a slip of paper. My
  business being now at an end, I offered my card to Mr. Isaacs, took his in
  return, and departed in company with Mr. Smallwood.</p>

  <p>"A queer business, this, ma'am," the officer remarked as we descended the
  stairs. "Regular mix up. Seem to be a lot of Sheenies in it."</p>

  <p>"Sheenies?" I repeated, interrogatively. "What are Sheenies?</p>

  <p>"Jews, ma'am," he replied, apparently a little surprised at my ignorance.
  "It's just a popular name, you know."</p>

  <p>I reflected on Mr. Smallwood's remark, which seemed hardly justified by
  the facts&mdash;two Jews only having appeared in the case, so far as I knew.
  And yet I seemed to be aware of a sort of Semitic atmosphere surrounding Mr.
  Otway. There were, for instance, the Campbells; and then Mrs. Gregg, although
  a Scotswoman, might easily, but for her strong Scottish accent, have passed
  for a Jewess; while Mr. Otway, himself, had been distinctly Semitic in
  appearance.</p>

  <p>At the entry, where we separated, Mr. Smallwood halted to give me a final
  injunction.</p>

  <p>"You had better be in good time to-morrow, ma'am," said he, "because it
  will be necessary for you to view the body so that you can give evidence as
  to the identity of the deceased."</p>

  <p>I thanked him for the reminder, but would much rather have been without
  it. For the prospect filled me with a vague alarm, and now the mental picture
  of the sleeping man, which had haunted me by night and by day, began to be
  replaced by one more dreadful, and one which I felt that my visit to the
  mortuary would attach to me for ever.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-3-24"
     id="ch-3-24"></a>XXIV.&mdash; THE GATHERING CLOUDS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE distaste which I felt for my errand did not prevent me
  from following Mr. Smallwood's advice on the subject of punctuality. It was
  some minutes short of half-past two when I turned into the mean little street
  off Drury Lane in which the mortuary was situated. I had found the place
  without much difficulty and had still less in finding the mortuary itself,
  for, as I entered the street I observed a procession of about a dozen men
  passing in through a narrow gateway, watched attentively by a small crowd of
  loiterers. Assuming the former to be the jury, I walked slowly past on the
  opposite side and continued for the length of the short street. I had just
  turned to retrace my steps when the men filed out of the gateway and
  proceeded to enter a building a few yards up the street, and immediately
  afterwards Mr. Smallwood appeared at the gate. He saw me at once and waited
  for me to approach.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you have come in good time, ma'am," said he. "The jury have
  just been in to view the body and the coroner will like to open the inquest
  punctually. This is the way."</p>

  <p>He preceded me down a narrow passage, at the end of which he pushed open a
  door. Following him I entered the mortuary, a bare, stone-floored hall
  containing two large slate-topped tables, one of which was occupied by a
  recumbent figure covered by a sheet. Mr. Smallwood removed his helmet and
  together we advanced slowly towards the awesome, shrouded form, lying so
  still and lonely in its grim surroundings. Very quietly, the officer picked
  up the two upper corners of the sheet and drew it back, retiring then a
  couple of paces as if to avoid intruding on my meeting with the dead.</p>

  <p>Strung up as I was, the first impression was less dreadful than I had
  anticipated. The face was pale and waxen, but it was placid in expression and
  more peaceful than I had ever seen it in life. The hunted, terrified look was
  gone and had given place to an air of repose, almost of dignity. For a few
  moments I was sensible of a feeling of relief; but then my glance fell upon a
  contorted length of crimson rope that lay on the slate table, and
  instinctively my eye turned to the uncovered throat. And as I noted the
  shallow groove under the chin, faintly marked with an impression of the
  strands of the rope, the shocking reality came home to me with overwhelming
  horror. Before my eyes arose that awful shape upon the bedroom wall and the
  hardly less dreadful image of the sleeping man unconsciously receiving the
  message of his doom.</p>

  <p>With a new horror&mdash;an incredulous horror of myself&mdash;I looked on
  the pale, placid face and seemed to read in it a gentle reproach. He had gone
  to his death at my bidding. He had stood unsteadily on the brink of the
  abyss, and I had pushed him over.</p>

  <p>It seemed incredible. There had been no conscious intention; no guilty
  premeditation. I would have told myself that there was no connection other
  than mere coincidence. But there the plain, undeniable facts were.
  Unconsciously&mdash;or subconsciously&mdash;my will had created that
  premonitory shape upon the wall; the terrible words had formed themselves and
  issued from my lips. And straightway the thing that my thoughts and words had
  foreshadowed had come to pass. This waxen-faced effigy that lay on the stone
  table, as its living counterpart had lain that night in the bed, was its
  fulfilment, its realisation.</p>

  <p>"Better not stay too long, ma'am," said Mr. Smallwood. And as he spoke I
  became suddenly aware that I had reached the limits of endurance. My knees
  began to tremble and I breathed the tainted air with difficulty.</p>

  <p>"Better come away now," continued Mr. Smallwood. "It's been rather too
  much for you. Good afternoon, Mrs. Gregg."</p>

  <p>I looked up quickly and perceived Mrs. Gregg, who must have come in
  without making a sound, standing at the foot of the table watching me
  intently. That penetrating stare and the singular, enigmatical expression
  would have been disturbing at any time. But now I was conscious of actual
  fear. As I tottered unsteadily along the passage to the street, the menace of
  that watchful, inscrutable gaze followed me. How much did this woman know?
  What had she heard? And if she had overheard those last words of mine, how
  much had she understood of their import? These were weighty questions, the
  answers to which I should doubtless hear within an hour or two.</p>

  <p>When I was ushered by Mr. Smallwood into the room in which the inquest was
  to be held, the court was already assembled and ready to begin. The jurymen
  sat along one side of a long table and one or two reporters occupied a part
  of the other, while a row of chairs accommodated the witnesses and persons
  interested in the case, including Mr. Isaacs, Mr. Hyams, Mr. and Mrs.
  Campbell, and a youngish man of a markedly Jewish type whom I did not
  recognise. I took my seat at the end of the row, and Mrs. Gregg, who had
  followed us in, seated herself near the middle.</p>

  <p>As I took my seat the coroner addressed one of the reporters:</p>

  <p>"Let me see, what paper do you represent?"</p>

  <p>"I am not a pressman, sir," was the reply. "I am commissioned to make a
  report for Dr. Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Thorndyke! But what is his connection with the case? I know nothing
  about him."</p>

  <p>"I only know that he has asked me to make a verbatim report of the
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"Hm," grunted the coroner. "I'm not sure that it is quite in order for
  private individuals to send their reporters to an inquest."</p>

  <p>"It is an open court, sir," the reporter observed.</p>

  <p>"I know. But still&mdash;however, I suppose it doesn't matter. Well,
  gentlemen, I think we are ready to begin. The witnesses are all present and
  it is on the stroke of three. I need not occupy your time with any
  preliminary statement. It seems quite a straightforward case and you will get
  the facts from the evidence of the witnesses. We are here, as you know, to
  inquire into the circumstances of the death of Lewis Otway, whose body you
  have just viewed, which occurred either on the night of the 18th instant or
  the morning of the 19th. The body was found hanging from a peg in his bedroom
  by his housekeeper, Mrs. Gregg, and it will be best to take her evidence
  first."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gregg was accordingly called, and having taken a position near the
  head of the table, was sworn and proceeded to give her evidence.</p>

  <p>"My name is Rachel Gregg, age 51. I was housekeeper to the deceased, Lewis
  Otway."</p>

  <p>"How long," asked the coroner, "had you known the deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Thirty-three years."</p>

  <p>"What was deceased's occupation?"</p>

  <p>"He was a retired solicitor; but he was a connoisseur in precious stones,
  and, I think, dealt in them to some extent."</p>

  <p>"Was he in financial difficulties of any kind, so far as you know?"</p>

  <p>"No. I believe he was quite a well-to-do man."</p>

  <p>"Had you any reason to suspect him of an intention to take his life?</p>

  <p>"Yes. He used to say that he expected, if ever he had any trouble, that he
  would hang himself. The tendency to suicide was in the family. His only
  brother hanged himself, his mother hanged herself and his mother's father
  hanged himself."</p>

  <p>"But that was only a tendency that might not have affected him. Had you
  any reason to expect that he actually might commit suicide? Was there
  anything in his manner, in the state of his mind or in his circumstances that
  led you to believe that he might take his life?</p>

  <p>"Not until recently. He always used to be quite cheerful in a quiet way
  until he got married. After that he was never the same. His marriage seemed
  to bring all sorts of trouble into his life."</p>

  <p>"Tell us exactly how this change came about."</p>

  <p>"His marriage took place about eight months ago&mdash;on the 25th of last
  April when he was living at Maidstone. It was quite sudden. I knew nothing of
  it until the day before, when he told me he was going to marry a Miss Helen
  Vardon, and that the marriage was to take place secretly because the lady's
  father had refused his consent. On the morning of the marriage I saw Mr.
  Otway go out, and soon afterwards I went out myself to do some shopping. When
  I came back I found the new Mrs. Otway in the study and her father, Mr.
  Vardon, lying dead on the floor. Mr. Otway had gone to fetch a doctor. It
  appeared that Mr. Vardon had called directly after the newly-married couple
  had arrived home from the church and that there had been a quarrel and Mr.
  Vardon had fallen down dead. I understand that Mr. Vardon was alone with Mr.
  Otway at the time.</p>

  <p>"Soon after I arrived, Mrs. Otway left the house and went back to her own
  home, and Mr. Otway told me that she refused to live with him. At any rate,
  she never did live with him, and she never came near him until the night of
  his death."</p>

  <p>"Do you know if the deceased agreed to this separation?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently she made him agree. But it was a great trouble to him, and I
  know that he tried more than once to get her to live with him."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what was the cause of the separation?"</p>

  <p>"No. Mr. Otway never mentioned it to me."</p>

  <p>"You say that the separation was a great trouble to the deceased. Did it
  obviously affect his spirits?</p>

  <p>"Yes; he was very depressed after his wife went away, and he never
  recovered. He seemed to get more and more low-spirited."</p>

  <p>"Do you know of any other reasons than the separation from his wife why he
  should have been depressed in spirits?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Mr. Vardon's sudden death was a great shock to him. He felt that he
  had been partly the cause of it, by quarrelling with Mr. Vardon. Then there
  was a great deal of talk in Maidstone about the affair and people blamed Mr.
  Otway for what had happened; and later rumours began to get about that there
  had been foul play&mdash;that Mr. Otway had actually killed Mr. Vardon. These
  rumours got on his nerves so badly that he gave up his house at Maidstone and
  moved to London."</p>

  <p>"You have spoken of a quarrel between deceased and Mr. Vardon. Do you know
  what the quarrel was about?"</p>

  <p>"I believe it was about the secret marriage, but I was not in the house at
  the time."</p>

  <p>"Were there any other causes for the mental depression which you say the
  deceased suffered from?"</p>

  <p>"I think so, but I can't say for certain. There were some letters that
  came about once a month which seemed to worry him a good deal. I used to see
  him reading them and looking very anxious and depressed; and after a time he
  began to get very nervous and fidgety and couldn't sleep at nights unless he
  took a dose of veronal. And I noticed that he was smoking much more than he
  used to, and taking much more whisky."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see any of the letters that you have spoken of?"</p>

  <p>"I never read one, but I saw the outsides and I noticed that they all bore
  the post-mark of East London."</p>

  <p>Here the coroner drew from the large envelope six of the letters which I
  had found in the deed-box, and handed them, in their envelopes, to Mrs.
  Gregg.</p>

  <p>"Do you recognise any of these letters?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gregg turned the envelopes over in her hand, looked closely at the
  post-marks and replied, as she returned them:</p>

  <p>"Yes; these look like the letters that I spoke of."</p>

  <p>The coroner laid the letters on the table, and after a few moments
  reflection said: "Now, Mrs. Gregg, we want you to tell us what you know of
  the circumstances of Mr. Otway's death. You spoke of a visit from Mrs.
  Otway."</p>

  <p>"Yes. She came to Lyon's Inn Chambers on Wednesday night, about half-past
  six and told me that Mr. Otway had written to her asking her to come. As Mr.
  Otway was then expecting another visitor, I asked her to call again about
  eight, which she agreed to do. Mr. Otway had been rather poorly for the last
  few days&mdash;very nervous and despondent, and had been sleeping
  badly&mdash;and for three days had kept to his bed. I told him that Mrs.
  Otway was coming at eight o'clock and he then said that he had some private
  business to talk over with her and that I need not sit up. I gave him his
  supper at half-past seven and just after I had cleared it away Mrs. Otway
  came. I showed her into the bedroom and went to the kitchen to finish up my
  work. At half-past nine I went to bed&mdash;a little earlier than usual
  because I thought they would like the place quiet for their talk. At a
  quarter to seven on Thursday morning I got up, and as soon as I was dressed,
  went into the living-room to tidy it up. Then, to my great surprise, I saw
  that the door of the bedroom, which opens out of the living-room, was wide
  open and that the gas in the bedroom was full on.</p>

  <p>"Thinking that Mr. Otway might be worse, I called out to him to ask if he
  wanted anything; but there was no answer. I could see the bed from where I
  was and could see that he was not in it; so I called to him again, and as
  there was still no answer, I went into the bedroom. At first I thought he was
  not there; but suddenly I saw him in a corner of the room that was in deep
  shadow. He seemed to be standing against the wall, with his arms hanging down
  straight and his head on one side; but when I went nearer I saw that he was
  hanging from a large peg and that his feet were three or four inches off the
  floor. He had hanged himself with a length of bell-rope that he had cut off
  with his razor&mdash;at least that was what it looked like, for the razor was
  lying open on the bed. I picked up the razor and ran to him and cut the loop
  of rope, and as he fell, I let him down on the floor as gently as I could. He
  seemed to be quite dead and his skin felt cold, so I ran out to fetch a
  doctor. Just outside the buildings I met a policeman and told him what had
  happened, and he told me to go back to the chambers and wait, which I did. A
  few minutes later he arrived at the chambers with a doctor, who examined the
  body and said that Mr. Otway had been dead some hours."</p>

  <p>"Did you see any means by which deceased could have raised himself to the
  peg from which he was hanging?</p>

  <p>"Yes. There was an overturned chair lying on the floor nearly underneath
  him. It looked as if he had stood on it to fix the loop of rope and then
  kicked it away. Mrs. Otway's bag was lying on the floor by the side of the
  chair."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Otway's bag! What bag was that?"</p>

  <p>"A little wrist-bag such as ladies use to carry their purses and
  handkerchiefs. She called for it the same day and I gave it to her. She had
  not heard what had happened, and when I told her she fell down in a dead
  faint."</p>

  <p>The coroner reflected for a while with wrinkled brows, and I caught the
  eyes of one or two of the jurymen regarding me furtively. After a somewhat
  lengthy pause, the coroner asked:</p>

  <p>"Do you know what time Mrs. Otway left the chambers?"</p>

  <p>"I heard the outer door slam about half an hour after I had gone to bed.
  That would be about ten o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Did you see Mrs. Otway or deceased after you let her in?"</p>

  <p>"No. I did not go into the bedroom again. I went into the living-room
  twice and could hear them talking."</p>

  <p>"Could you hear what they were talking about?"</p>

  <p>"I could hear a few words now and then. When I went into the living-room
  the first time they seemed to be talking about suicide. I heard Mr. Otway say
  something about a peg on the wall."</p>

  <p>"And when you went in the second time?"</p>

  <p>"They seemed still to be talking about suicide. I heard Mrs. Otway ask
  deceased what drove his brother to hang himself."</p>

  <p>"You heard nothing suggesting a quarrel or disagreement?"</p>

  <p>"No. They seemed to be talking in quite a friendly way."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what kind of terms they were on?"</p>

  <p>"No. I never saw them together before except for a few minutes on the
  wedding day."</p>

  <p>"You spoke of a visitor who came to deceased earlier in the evening. Who
  was that visitor?</p>

  <p>"A Mrs. Campbell. Her husband is a jeweller and curio-dealer whom deceased
  had known for a good many years, and used to have business dealings with. I
  understand she came on business and she only stayed about ten minutes."</p>

  <p>"Is that all you know about the case?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I have told you all I know about it."</p>

  <p>The coroner glanced at the jury. "Do any of you gentlemen, wish to ask the
  witness any questions?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Apparently none of them did, and when the coroner had complimented Mrs.
  Gregg on the clear manner in which she had given her evidence, she was
  dismissed.</p>

  <p>There was a short interval in which the coroner read over his notes and
  the jury conferred together in low under tones. Then the coroner observed:
  "We had better dispose of the police and medical evidence as they are merely
  formal and will not take much time. We will begin with the constable."</p>

  <p>The policeman was then called and briefly corroborated Mrs. Gregg's
  evidence. When he had finished, the doctor, whom he had brought to the
  chambers, took his place, and having been duly sworn deposed as follows:</p>

  <p>"My name is John Shelburn. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons
  and a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, and am acting as locum
  tenens for the police surgeon of Saint Clement Danes. At seven twenty-eight
  a.m., on Thursday, the 18th of October, I was summoned by the last witness to
  accompany him to Lyon's Inn Chambers, where a man was reported to have hanged
  himself. I went with the constable to a set of chambers, over the door of
  which was painted the name of Mr. Lewis Otway. I went into the bedroom where
  the gas was alight, the blinds down and the curtains drawn. There, lying on
  the floor near the wall, I found the dead body of a tall, heavily built man,
  about fifty or fifty-five years of age, dressed in a suit of pyjamas. The
  surface of the body was cold and rigor mortis was well established. I should
  say the man had been dead about eight hours. Around the neck was a double
  loop of red bell-rope and a portion of the same was hanging from a large peg
  on the wall about seven feet from the floor. The rope had apparently been cut
  down for the purpose as a portion was still attached to the bell-wire and the
  severed tassel lay on the bed, on which were impressions of feet, as if
  someone had stood on the bed to cut it off. The length of rope had been
  joined at the ends with the kind of knot known as a 'granny' and formed into
  what is known as a weaver's loop, which had been passed over the head and the
  standing part of the rope hitched over the peg. This would form a running
  loop, like this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here the witness produced a piece of thick string and demonstrated the
  arrangement on his thumb and the knob of a chair-back.</p>

  <p>"I released the double loop from the neck and found a shallow groove on
  the throat corresponding to the rope. The countenance of the deceased was
  calm&mdash;as it usually is in cases of hanging&mdash;and there were no signs
  of violence or anything remarkable about the body. A chair, on which the
  deceased had apparently stood to adjust the rope on the peg, was lying close
  by and near to it on the floor was a lady's hand-bag. The rope had been cut
  with some sharp instrument&mdash;probably a razor, as I was informed by the
  housekeeper. I looked round the room but saw nothing of any significance
  excepting a half-empty whisky decanter and a nearly-full bottle of veronal
  tablets on a table by the bed."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell us at what time death took place?"</p>

  <p>"Only approximately. I have said that the man appeared to have been dead
  about eight hours. That would give us eleven o'clock on the night of the 18th
  as the time at which death occurred. But I will not bind myself to that time
  exactly. It might have been an hour earlier or later."</p>

  <p>"After hearing your evidence and that of the other witnesses which you
  have also heard, it is a mere formality to ask your opinion as to the cause
  of death."</p>

  <p>"Yes. The cause of death was obviously suicidal hanging."</p>

  <p>This concluded the surgeon's evidence, and when he had been dismissed, the
  coroner turned to the jury.</p>

  <p>"We have now, gentlemen," said he, "established the fact of death and its
  immediate cause. Our next move is to seek to establish the contributory
  circumstances&mdash;the more remote causes. We have ascertained that this
  unfortunate man committed suicide. The question that we now have to consider
  is, Why did he commit suicide? Possibly the evidence of his widow may help us
  to answer that question. Helen Otway."</p>

  <p>As I rose to take my place at the table I was dimly aware of a certain
  ill-defined movement on the part of the jury and the spectators such as one
  may notice in a church at the conclusion of a sermon. But in the present case
  the cause was evidently a concentration rather than a relaxation of
  attention. Clearly, my evidence was anticipated with considerable
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Your name is&mdash;?</p>

  <p>"Helen Otway. My age is twenty-four and I live at 69, Wellclose
  Square."</p>

  <p>"Have you viewed and do you identify the body now lying in St. Clement's
  mortuary?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; it is the body of Lewis Otway, my late husband."</p>

  <p>"When did you last see the deceased alive?"</p>

  <p>"On the night of Wednesday, the 18th of October."</p>

  <p>"Tell us, please, what took place on that occasion."</p>

  <p>"I went to see deceased in consequence of a letter that I had received
  from him asking me to do so. I arrived at about half-past six and was
  informed by Mrs. Gregg that deceased was expecting another visitor."</p>

  <p>"Did you know who that other visitor was?"</p>

  <p>"No; but as I went down the stairs I met Mrs. Campbell coming up and
  assumed that she was the visitor."</p>

  <p>"You know Mrs. Campbell, then?"</p>

  <p>"Only by sight. I have seen her in her husband's shop. Mrs. Gregg asked me
  to call again at eight, and I agreed to do so, and did so. I was then
  admitted by Mrs. Gregg, who conducted me to the bedroom and left me there,
  shutting the door as she went out. I did not see her again that night.
  Deceased was in bed and had by his side a table on which were a spirit
  decanter, a siphon of soda water, a box of cigarettes, a bottle of veronal
  tablets and a deed-box."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice anything peculiar in his appearance?"</p>

  <p>"No. He was not looking well, but he seemed less ill than I had expected
  from his letter; which conveyed the impression that he was in a dangerous
  condition."</p>

  <p>"Have you got that letter?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied, "I have it here." As I spoke, I drew the letter from my
  pocket and handed it to the coroner who glanced through it and then laid it
  down with some other papers.</p>

  <p>"We will consider this letter," said he, "with the others that you have
  handed to me, later. Will you now tell us what passed between you and the
  deceased?"</p>

  <p>"At first we talked about an anonymous letter that he had received a day
  or two previously. He showed me the letter, and when I had read it, he locked
  it in the deed-box."</p>

  <p>"We will deal with the anonymous letters presently. What else did you talk
  about?"</p>

  <p>"Deceased repeated the statement that he had made in the letter, that he
  did not expect to live much longer. I asked him if he had any reason for
  saying this and he then told me that there was a strong family predisposition
  suicide; that his brother, his mother and his mother's father had all hanged
  themselves, and that since he had received the anonymous letters he had been
  conscious of an impulse to make away with himself in the same manner."</p>

  <p>"Had you not known previously of this family tendency?"</p>

  <p>"No. He had never mentioned it before, and I knew nothing of his
  family."</p>

  <p>"Did deceased speak as if he actually intended to make away with
  himself?"</p>

  <p>"No, but he spoke of an impulse which he found it difficult to resist; and
  he mentioned that a large peg on the bedroom wall seemed to fascinate him and
  to make the impulse stronger. I advised him to have it taken away."</p>

  <p>"Previous to this conversation, had you ever thought it possible that the
  deceased might commit suicide?</p>

  <p>"No; the possibility never entered my mind."</p>

  <p>The coroner considered these replies and made a few further notes; then he
  proceeded to open a fresh subject.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mrs. Otway, with regard to your relations with deceased. Were you on
  friendly terms with him?"</p>

  <p>"Not particularly. We were practically strangers."</p>

  <p>"A witness has stated that you refused to live with deceased and that you
  never had lived with him. Is that true?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is quite true."</p>

  <p>"Had you quarrelled with deceased?"</p>

  <p>"No, there was no quarrel. Our marriage was a business transaction and
  immediately after the ceremony I discovered that my consent had been
  obtained, as I considered, by misrepresentation."</p>

  <p>"We don't want to be inquisitive, Mrs. Otway, but we wish to understand
  the position. Could you give us a few more particulars?"</p>

  <p>"Do you wish me to describe the circumstances of my marriage and the
  separation from my husband?"</p>

  <p>"If you please."</p>

  <p>"My marriage with Mr. Lewis Otway took place under the following
  circumstances: I accidentally overheard a portion of a conversation between
  Mr. Otway and my father from which I gathered that Mr. Otway claimed the
  immediate payment of five thousand pounds held by my father&mdash; who was a
  solicitor&mdash;in trust. It appeared from the conversation that my father
  was unable immediately to produce the money, and Mr. Otway threatened to take
  criminal proceedings for misappropriation of trust funds. To this my father
  made no very definite reply. Then Mr. Otway offered to abstain from any
  proceedings and to allow the claim to remain in abeyance on condition that a
  marriage should take place between him and me. This my father refused very
  emphatically and angrily, and Mr. Otway left our house.</p>

  <p>"Being greatly alarmed on my father's account, I communicated with Mr.
  Otway and informed him that I was prepared to accept his offer on the terms
  stated&mdash;namely, that he should release my father from the immediate
  claim and secure him from any proceedings in connection with it. Mr. Otway
  accepted the conditions, and as it was certain that my father would strongly
  object, we agreed not to inform him until after the marriage had take
  place.</p>

  <p>"In accordance with this arrangement we were married privately on the 25th
  April of the present year and we went together from the church to Mr. Otway's
  house. I had left a letter for my father informing him of what had been done,
  and very shortly after our return from the church he came to the house. From
  an upper window I saw him enter the garden and I was very much alarmed at his
  appearance. I had heard that he suffered from complaint of the heart and had
  been warned against undue excitement and exertion, and I could see that he
  was extremely excited and was looking very ill. Mr. Otway let him in and, in
  answer to a question, admitted that the marriage had taken place. Then I
  heard my father ask Mr. Otway if he had told me about a letter that
  he&mdash;my father&mdash;had sent, and when Mr. Otway gave an evasive reply
  my father called him a scoundrel and accused him of having tricked and
  swindled me.</p>

  <p>"I heard no more of what was said, as the two men went into the study and
  shut the door; but a minute or two later I heard a heavy fall, and, running
  down to the study found my father lying on the floor and already dead. There
  was a small wound on his temple and Mr. Otway, who was stooping over the
  body, held my father's walking-stick&mdash;a thick Malacca cane with a loaded
  silver knob&mdash;in his hand. He stated that my father had threatened him
  with the stick and that he had taken it away from him and that during the
  struggle my father had fallen insensible, striking his head on the corner of
  the mantel-piece as he fell."</p>

  <p>"Did you believe him?</p>

  <p>"I think, at the moment, I did not. But on reflection, remembering how ill
  my father had looked, I had no doubt he was speaking the truth."</p>

  <p>"Was there an inquest on your father's death?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The jury found, in accordance with the medical evidence, that death
  was due to heart failure caused by excitement and anger."</p>

  <p>"And after this you refused to live with deceased?</p>

  <p>"Yes. I asked him about my father's letter and he said he had not seen it.
  I went with him to the letter-box and there we found it. The postmark showed
  that it had come by the first post and my father's address was on the outside
  of the envelope. There were no other letters in the box. I had no doubt that
  Mr. Otway had seen the letter and put it back in the box."</p>

  <p>"Was that why you refused to live with him?"</p>

  <p>"Partly. The letter stated that my father was able to meet his liabilities
  and gave a date on which payment would he made. Consequently the threatened
  proceedings against my father were impossible and Mr. Otway had obtained my
  consent by false pretences. But further, Mr. Otway's action had been the
  cause of my father's death, and this alone would have made it impossible for
  me to live with him as his wife."</p>

  <p>"Did deceased agree to the separation?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He saw that the position was impossible; but he hoped that the
  separation might be only temporary&mdash;that we might become reconciled at
  some future time."</p>

  <p>"Did you consider this possible?"</p>

  <p>"No. I held him accountable for my father's death and could never have
  overcome my repugnance to him."</p>

  <p>The coroner noted down this answer and having glanced over his notes
  reflectively, looked up at the jury.</p>

  <p>"Do any of you, gentlemen, wish to put any questions on this subject?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>The jurymen looked at one another and looked at me; and one of them
  remarked that, "This young lady seems to have rather easy-going ideas about
  the responsibilities of marriage."</p>

  <p>"That," said the Coroner, "is hardly our concern. The next matter that we
  have to consider is that of certain letters received by the deceased from
  some unknown person or persons. There are seven of them and they seem by the
  postmarks to have been sent at intervals of about three weeks and to have
  been posted somewhere in the East end of London. We will begin with the
  first." He handed a letter to me and asked: "Have you seen that letter
  before?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied. "Deceased showed it to me one day last June when I met
  him by appointment at his request. He seemed to be extremely worried about
  it."</p>

  <p>The coroner took the letter from me and read it aloud.</p>

  <p>"'Mr. Lewis Otway,</p>

  <p>"'The undersigned is writing to put you on your guard because Somebody
  knows something about how Mr Vardon came by his death and that somebody is
  not a friend, so you had better keep a sharp look-out for you enemy and see
  what they mean to do. I can't tell you any more at present.</p>

  <p>"A WELL WISHER."</p>

  <p>"Do you know," the coroner asked, "who wrote that letter?"</p>

  <p>"No, I do not."</p>

  <p>"Have you no idea at all? Is there no one whom you suspect?"</p>

  <p>"I have not the least idea who sent that letter."</p>

  <p>"You say that deceased was extremely worried about it. Do you know why he
  was worried?"</p>

  <p>"I understand that there had been rumours in Maidstone that Mr. Otway had
  killed my father. Those rumour seemed to have preyed upon his mind and made
  him unreasonably nervous."</p>

  <p>The coroner nodded gravely and opened another letter and as he read aloud
  the well-remembered phrases I realised that I should need all the courage and
  self-possession at my command.</p>

  <p>"'The writer of this warns you once more,'" the letter ran, "'to look for
  trouble. The person that I spoke of knows that something was held back at the
  inquest at least they say so and that they know why your wife won't live with
  you and that she knows all about it too and that someone knows more than you
  think anybody knows. This is a friendly warning.</p>

  <p>"'FROM A WELL WISHER.'"</p>

  <p>The coroner looked keenly at me as he finished reading.</p>

  <p>"Can you explain the meaning of this letter?" asked. "It refers to
  something that was held back at the inquest. Was anything held back, so far
  as you know?"</p>

  <p>"I remember that there was one omission in the evidence. Mr. Otway made no
  mention of my father's stick."</p>

  <p>"Was it not mentioned at the inquest at all?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did you not give evidence?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but I was merely asked if I confirmed Mr. Otway's evidence, which I
  did."</p>

  <p>"You confirmed Mr. Otway's evidence! But that evidence was not correct.
  The duty of a witness is to state the whole truth; whereas Mr. Otway had
  withheld a highly material fact. How was it that you did not supply this very
  important fact?"</p>

  <p>"It did not appear to me to be of any importance. The medical evidence
  showed that death was due to heart failure.''</p>

  <p>"Medical evidence!" the coroner exclaimed, testily. "There is too much of
  this medical evidence superstition in these courts. People speak as if
  doctors were infallible. It was your duty as a witness to state all that you
  knew, not to decide what was or was not of importance. And I cannot
  understand how you came to hold such an opinion. You found your father lying
  dead with a wound on his head and a man standing over him with a loaded
  stick, and you considered this fact of no consequence?"</p>

  <p>"I see now that I ought to have mentioned it."</p>

  <p>"What was the verdict?</p>

  <p>"The verdict was in accordance with the medical evidence&mdash;Death from
  natural causes."</p>

  <p>"Did the medical witness or witnesses know that Mr. Otway had had a loaded
  stick in his hand?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did anybody besides yourself and Mr. Otway know about the loaded
  stick?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Gregg came into the room when Mr. Otway had gone for a doctor. She
  saw the stick in a corner and picked it up to examine it. She asked whose it
  was and remarked on its weight."</p>

  <p>"Did she know it had been in Mr. Otway's hand at the time of your father's
  death?"</p>

  <p>"I have no reason to suppose that she knew."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the coroner, "it is a most extraordinary affair. You heard
  Mr. Otway give his evidence, you knew that that evidence was incomplete, and
  yet, though the dead man was your own father and you have declared an
  unconquerable repugnance to Mr. Otway, you allowed this garbled evidence to
  pass unchallenged. It is an amazing affair. However," he continued turning to
  the jury, "that is not our concern. But what is our concern, for the purposes
  of this inquiry, is that we now begin to see daylight. We can now understand
  the extraordinary effect these letters seem to have had on the man whose
  death we are investigating. Lewis Otway, when he gave his evidence at the
  inquest, suppressed a most important and damaging fact which he believed to
  be known only to himself and his wife. Thereby he obtained a verdict of Death
  from Natural Causes, which exonerated him from all blame. Had all the facts
  been known, the verdict might have been very different.</p>

  <p>"Now the receipt of these letters must have destroyed his sense of
  security. Apparently someone else&mdash;and that someone evidently an
  enemy&mdash;knew of this damaging fact and knew of the further damaging fact
  that it had been suppressed at the inquest. In effect, these letters held out
  a threat of a charge of murder, or at least, manslaughter. It is no wonder
  that they alarmed him. But we had better take the rest of the evidence. There
  is this letter deceased wrote to his wife, which I will read. It is dated the
  17th of October, and this is what it says:</p>

  <p>"'My dear Helen,</p>

  <p>"'I have not troubled you for quite a long time with my miserable
  affairs&mdash;which are to some extent your affairs too. But they are going
  from bad to worse, and now I feel that I am coming to the limits of
  endurance. I cannot bear this much longer. My health is shattered, my peace
  of mind is wrecked and my brain threatens to give way. Death would be a boon,
  a relief, and I feel that it is not far off. I cannot go on like this. Those
  wretches will not leave me in peace. Hardly a week passes but I get some new
  menace and now&mdash;but I can't tell you in a letter. It is too horrible,
  Come to me, Helen, for the love of God! I am in torment! Have pity on me,
  even though you have never forgiven me. I cannot come to you, for I am now
  unable to leave my bed. I am a wreck, a ruin. Come to me just this once, and
  if you cannot help me, at least give me the comfort of your sympathy. You
  will not be troubled by me much longer.</p>

  <p>"'Your distracted husband,</p>

  <p>"'LEWIS OTWAY.'"</p>

  <p>When the coroner finished reading the letter (which evidently made a deep
  impression on the jury) he looked at me gravely.</p>

  <p>"Before passing to the next letter, I must ask one or two questions about
  this one. What did you understand from the phrases 'I feel that it (death) is
  not far off. I cannot go on like this. You will not be troubled by me much
  longer.' Did they not suggest to you an intention to commit suicide?"</p>

  <p>"No. I understood them as referring to his state of health."</p>

  <p>"If you had known of the family tendency to suicide, how would you have
  understood these passages?"</p>

  <p>"I should have suspected that he contemplated suicide."</p>

  <p>"But you say you were not aware of this tendency?"</p>

  <p>"No, I was not."</p>

  <p>"He refers to his 'miserable affairs&mdash;which are to some extent your
  affairs too.' What did you understand him to mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"I understood him to refer to the fact that I was partly responsible for
  the omission of certain details in the evidence at the inquest."</p>

  <p>"When you received this pitiful letter, what did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I went to him the same day to find out what the trouble was. He then
  showed me an anonymous letter that he had received."</p>

  <p>"Is this the one?" the coroner asked, handing it to me; and when I had
  glanced at it and identified it, he proceeded to read it to the jury.</p>

  <p>"'Mr. Lewis Otway,</p>

  <p>"'Some funny questions are being asked. What about Mr. Vardon's
  stick?&mdash;the loaded stick with the silver knob to hide the lead loading?
  Where is it? Somebody says they know where it is and who's got it. And they
  say there is a bruise on the silver-top, and they say something about a smear
  of blood and a grey hair sticking to it, Do you know anything about that? If
  you don't you'd better find out. Because I think you will hear from that
  somebody before you are many weeks older or else from the police. A WELL
  WISHER.'"</p>

  <p>As he laid down the letter, the coroner looked at me curiously.</p>

  <p>"There are one or two important questions, Mrs. Otway," said he, "that
  arise out of this letter. The first is, What has become of this stick?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what has become of it. I saw Mrs. Gregg replace it in the
  corner by the writing table and never saw it again. The deceased asked me the
  same question when he showed me the letter; but I reminded him that I did not
  take the stick with me when I left his house and that I never went to the
  house again."</p>

  <p>"It never occurred to you to ask what had become of your father's
  stick?"</p>

  <p>"No. I always assumed that it was in Mr. Otway's possession."</p>

  <p>"You have told us that Mrs. Gregg had seen the stick in Mr. Otway's house.
  Had anyone else seen it there?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know of anyone else having seen it; but, of course, it may have
  been seen there by other persons. I know nothing of what went on in that
  house. I never entered it after my father's death."</p>

  <p>"With the exception of Mr. Otway and yourself, did anyone know that you
  had seen that stick in Mr. Otway's hand on the occasion of your father's
  death?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I am aware, no one else knew."</p>

  <p>"There is a statement in that letter referring to a bruise on the silver
  knob and a smear of blood with a grey hair sticking to it. Is it possible, so
  far as you know, that that statement might be true?</p>

  <p>"I cannot say that it is impossible."</p>

  <p>"After your father's death, did you examine the stick?"</p>

  <p>"No. I saw it in Mrs. Gregg's hands, but I did not look at it
  closely."</p>

  <p>At this point a police superintendent who had been sitting near to the
  coroner's table, rose, and, approaching the table, stooped over it and spoke
  to the coroner in a low voice. The latter listened attentively and nodded
  once or twice, and when the superintendent had returned to his seat he
  addressed me.</p>

  <p>"I think that will do, Mrs. Otway&mdash;for the present, at any rate. We
  may have to ask you one or two questions later. Do any of the jury wish to
  ask anything before the witness sits down?"</p>

  <p>As none of the jury responded, I returned to my seat, and the coroner then
  recalled Mrs. Gregg.</p>

  <p>"You have heard the last witness state that she saw you take up Mr.
  Vardon's stick. What made you examine that stick?"</p>

  <p>"I did not examine it. I noticed it standing in the corner and saw that it
  was a strange stick&mdash;that it was not Mr. Otway's. I took it out of the
  corner to look at it and then noticed that it was heavily loaded at the
  top."</p>

  <p>"Can you say whether there was or was not a bruise or a blood smear on the
  knob?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot. I did not look closely at the knob. I just picked the stick up,
  felt its weight and put it back in the corner."</p>

  <p>"Did you know that Mr. Otway had had that stick in his hand when Mr.
  Vardon fell dead?"</p>

  <p>"No. I never heard of that until to-day."</p>

  <p>"Could anyone other than Mrs. Otway have known, so far as you are able to
  say?</p>

  <p>"I can't say. I should think not. I did not get back to the house until it
  was all over. But I thought, and believe, that there was no one in the house
  but those three&mdash;Mrs. Otway and her husband and her father."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what became of that stick?"</p>

  <p>"I do not. I put it back in the corner and never saw it again. It was not
  in the corner when I tidied up the room the next day."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Gregg. That will do."</p>

  <p>Having dismissed the witness, the coroner turned to the jury.</p>

  <p>"I had hoped, gentlemen," said he, "to finish the case to-day, but, as you
  have seen, its apparent simplicity was rather illusory. Some rather curious
  issues have arisen which will have to be considered in detail. Moreover,
  there appears to be a suspicion that property of very great value has been
  removed from the premises&mdash;at least, it seems to be missing. Under these
  circumstances, the police authorities ask for an adjournment to enable them
  to make some enquiries; and I am sure you will agree with me that this, and
  certain other matters, should be cleared up before a verdict is returned. I
  therefore propose to adjourn the enquiry for fourteen days."</p>

  <p>The court rose, and I rose with it. As I stood up and turned towards the
  door I saw Jasper standing at the back of the hall. He made no sign, nor did
  I; and as soon as our eyes had met, he turned and walked out. I did not
  attempt to follow, for I understood at once that he did not consider it
  desirable that we should recognise one another in this place. Moreover, I was
  detained for a minute or two by the coroner, who informed me, with a curious
  dry civility, that he wished me to attend at the adjourned meeting of the
  court, as further evidence from me might be required and after him, by Mr.
  Isaacs, who, as executor, was responsible for the funeral arrangements and
  who promise to inform me when the date had been fixed.</p>

  <p>As I emerged from the gateway I glanced up the street with a wistfulness
  which I would hardly acknowledge to myself. But, of course, Jasper was
  already out of sight. Feeling very lonely, weary and exhausted, I walked
  slowly down Drury Lane considering what I should do next. And suddenly there
  came on me a longing for the quiet and comfort of the club. It was quite
  near; and once there I could wash, refresh and rest in peace, alone, or at
  least among civilised people. And it was even possible that Jasper might be
  there.</p>

  <p>At this thought I must have unconsciously quickened my pace, for a few
  minutes later found me passing through the entrance hall, telling myself
  that, of course, Jasper would not have come there. Nevertheless as I opened
  the door to the large room my eye instantly sought the familiar table in the
  corner; and when I saw Jasper sitting by it with a wishful gaze fixed on the
  door, my weariness and loneliness seemed to drop from me like a garment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-3-25"
     id="ch-3-25"></a>XXV. &mdash; SUSPENSE&mdash;AND A DISCOVERY</h2>

  <p class="first">"I HAD hoped," said Jasper, as we met by the table, "that
  you would come on here. I had to take the chance. You understood why I made
  myself scarce as soon as you had seen me?"</p>

  <p>"I assumed that you thought it better that we should not be seen together
  just at present."</p>

  <p>"It is more than unadvisable," said he. "It is vitally important. We will
  talk about that letter&mdash;but not here. There is a lot that I have to say
  to you, but we had better have our talk where we cannot be seen, or possibly
  overheard. I propose that I run off now&mdash;nobody has seen us here
  yet&mdash;and wait for you at my chambers. You just have a wash to freshen
  you up and come along at once. Don't stop for tea; I will have some ready for
  you. And you had better come by the least frequented way. Go down the
  Embankment, up Middle Temple Lane, along Crown Office Row, cross King's Bench
  Walk to Mitre Court, come out into Fleet Street by Mitre Court Passage, cross
  to Fetter Lane and into Clifford's Inn by the postern gate."</p>

  <p>"All this sounds very secret and mysterious," said I.</p>

  <p>"It is necessary," he replied. "We mustn't be seen together if we can help
  it. Remember the jury and other interested parties are local men, and might
  easily run against us in the public thoroughfares. So I will run off now and
  you will come along as soon as you can."</p>

  <p>To this arrangement I agreed, although the precautions seemed to me
  somewhat excessive, and he hurried away while I went in quest of hot water
  and the other means of ablution.</p>

  <p>The process of purification did not take long, for the temptation to
  linger luxuriously over the ceremonial of the toilet was combated by
  curiosity and anxiety to rejoin Jasper. In a few minutes I emerged, greatly
  refreshed and sensible of a very healthy appetite, and set forth by the
  prescribed route towards Clifford's Inn, reflecting earnestly as I went on
  Jasper's rather mysterious attitude. I did not have to ply the knocker, for
  as I reached the landing I found Jasper standing at his open door.</p>

  <p>"Now," said he, when I had entered and he had softly closed both the
  massive "oak" and the inner door, "we are secure from observers and
  eavesdroppers, and we can pow-wow at any length we please."</p>

  <p>"You are very secret and portentous," I remarked. "What is it all
  about?"</p>

  <p>"The secrecy and portentosity," he replied, "are possibly by-products of a
  legal training. We will discuss that presently. Meanwhile, the need of the
  moment is to provide nourishment for a starving angel."</p>

  <p>He placed an easy chair for me by the fire, and then retired to the little
  kitchen, from which issued a gentle din of crockery very grateful to my ear.
  Presently he emerged with a tray on which were a teapot and two covers, and
  having deposited it on a small table, placed the latter by my chair and
  removed the covers with a flourish.</p>

  <p>"There is only one cup and one plate," said I, noting that the
  "nourishment" had been provided on a scale of opulence appropriate to
  masculine conceptions of appetite.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Jasper. "How many cups and plates do you generally
  use?"</p>

  <p>"Go and get another plate and cup and saucer," I commanded, severely.</p>

  <p>When he had made the necessary addition to the table appointments, he drew
  up a second armchair, and, as he poured out the tea, he said, gravely:</p>

  <p>"We have had a long probation, Helen, dearest&mdash;at least, it seems so
  to me; and it is not over yet. But this little interlude should hearten us
  for what remains. To me it is a glimpse into a future of perfect happiness
  and comradeship. Do you realise, Helen, that we are now a normal, engaged
  couple, free to marry when we choose?"</p>

  <p>Of course I had realised that we were free; but as I thought of the
  shrouded figure that even now reposed under its sheet in the mortuary, I
  doubted whether the word "normal" was fully applicable.</p>

  <p>"It is perfect peace and happiness to be here with you, Jasper," I
  replied; "but I think I shall feel more normal when we can meet without all
  this secrecy. And even now I don't quite understand it. Why is it so
  important that we should not be seen together?"</p>

  <p>"That is fairly obvious, I think," he replied. "I am going to be very
  frank with you, Helen, because I have complete confidence in your courage and
  strength of character. There is no use in blinking the fact that you are in a
  difficult situation. That coroner man thinks you wrote those anonymous
  letters; and he suspects that you knew about Otway's suicidal
  tendencies."</p>

  <p>"But I distinctly said I did not."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but, you see, the person who wrote those letters is not a person
  whose statements would carry any weight; and he thinks you are that person.
  He thinks you have tried to drive Otway to suicide, and he will be looking
  for a motive. There is a fairly obvious motive already, as you were
  encumbered with a husband whom you didn't want; but if you add another
  husband whom you did and do want, the motive for getting rid of the unwanted
  one becomes much more definite. That is the kind of motive he will be on the
  look-out for. Hence the necessity for the utmost caution on our part. If a
  witness could be produced who could depose to having seen us together, it
  might be possible for him to put some inconvenient questions."</p>

  <p>"Could he not question me on the subject apart from any such witness?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it would be admissible for the coroner to suggest the
  existence of a lover if he had no facts. And that brings us to the point that
  I was going to raise. You ought to be represented either by counsel or by a
  solicitor; preferably by counsel, as a barrister is more agile&mdash;more
  accustomed to deal with the sudden exigencies that arise in court."</p>

  <p>"You seem to suggest that I am charged with having brought about Mr.
  Otway's death."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't use the word 'charged' as I don't know that there is any such
  offence recognised by law. Morally, to cause a man to commit suicide would be
  much the same as to murder him, but I can't say off-hand what the legal
  position would be. My impression is that it would not be an offence that
  could be dealt with by law unless the act of murder could be proven.
  Nonetheless, I would be happier to see you with some reliable counsel we
  could trust."</p>

  <p>It was then I thought of Dr Thorndyke. He had shown a kind interest in my
  affairs, even to the extent of having a shorthand reporter at the inquest.
  Surely he would be ideal, if I could persuade him to take up the role of my
  advocate. I broached the possibility to Jasper, explaining Dr. Thorndyke's
  interest in the case.</p>

  <p>"The very man!" Jasper said enthusiastically. "You must see him, Helen,
  and soon. He is a local resident, luckily, and lives only a few moments' walk
  from here."</p>

  <p>So fast did things seem to be moving that I was reluctant to take on
  another visit after my already busy day, but Jasper was insistent that I
  should seek out Dr. Thorndyke's help. "I wish I could accompany you," he
  said, "but it is best if we are not seen out together. Will you see him?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps." I temporised, still feeling that to take on the
  services&mdash;and the cost!&mdash;of such a distinguished advocate was an
  extreme reaction to my current situation.</p>

  <p>We talked a little longer, and then I took my leave, getting directions to
  Dr. Thorndyke's rooms from Jasper.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said he, as he bade me farewell, "we had better not meet
  again until this affair is over. It is only a fortnight, and after that we
  shall be free. Meanwhile, we can write as often as we please."</p>

  <p>I agreed to this the more readily as I saw that another meeting with
  Jasper would make it difficult for me to escape from his demand that I should
  invoke Dr. Thorndyke's help. Nevertheless, as I took my way through
  Clifford's Inn Passage into Fleet Street, I found myself looking forward
  somewhat gloomily to the lonely and anxious fortnight lay ahead.</p>

  <p>For several days nothing out of the ordinary occurred. My friends at
  Wellclose Square, who knew approximately what my position was, were quietly
  sympathetic, but never referred to the matter; excepting the incorrigible
  Peggy, who frankly congratulated me on my newly-acquired freedom.</p>

  <p>"It's horrid for you, Sibyl," said she, "but still it is for the best;
  though he might have managed it a little more decently&mdash;a level
  crossing, you know, or 'found drowned,' or something of that sort."</p>

  <p>"You are a callous little wretch, Peggy," said I.</p>

  <p>"I don't care," she replied, defiantly. "You know it is true. I am awfully
  sorry for you now. It must be perfectly beastly to have to answer all those
  impertinent questions, and have your answers printed in the news papers. But
  it will soon be over, and then you can forget it and have a good time. I
  shall dance at your wedding before I am six months older."</p>

  <p>I had to pretend to be shocked, but the Titmouse's optimism did me good.
  For there was a bright side to the picture, and it was just as well to gather
  encouragement from an occasional glance at it.</p>

  <p>About ten days after the first sitting of the inquest I received a letter
  from Mr. Isaacs. He had already written to me briefly to inform me that the
  funeral had been postponed by the coroner's direction until after the
  adjourned inquest, but had then said nothing about the will. The present
  letter supplied the omission, and its contents surprised me very much. It
  appeared that the will been proved and that I was the principal beneficiary.
  "The testator," said Mr. Isaacs, "has bequeathed to you the bulk of his
  personalty&mdash;upwards of eight thousand pounds&mdash;and the lease of the
  premises in Lyon's Inn Chambers, together with the furniture and effects
  contained therein. You are also constituted the residuary legatee. The
  chambers have now been evacuated by Mrs. Gregg, and are at your disposal.
  They are at present locked up, and the keys are in my possession pending your
  instructions and advice as to whether you intend to occupy the premises, to
  let them or to dispose of the lease. A copy of the will can be seen at my
  office, and, of course, the original can be examined at Somerset House."</p>

  <p>The provisions of this will caused me, as I have said, considerable
  surprise. I had regarded myself as having no pecuniary claim on Mr. Otway,
  and had not considered myself as concerned in his will at all. Now it was
  evident that, selfish as he had been during his life, he had been anxious at
  least to make some atonement after his death for the injury he had done me;
  and the fact did not tend to make my sense of guilt less acute.</p>

  <p>Before I had replied to Mr. Isaacs' letter I received two other
  communications. One was from Jasper; and though it was written in a tone of
  quiet cheerfulness, its contents filled me with alarm. It appeared that
  Jasper, becoming uneasy at my continued neglect to take any measures to
  secure a counsel to represent me, had called on Dr. Thorndyke with the object
  of retaining him. "We have had rather bad luck," he continued, "though I
  don't suppose it will matter. Dr. Thorndyke would have been pleased to
  represent you, but unfortunately he has been commissioned at the last moment
  by the Home Office to make an independent investigation of the case. He gave
  me the name of a suitable counsel&mdash;a rising junior named
  Cawley&mdash;with whom I have made the necessary arrangements. So your
  interests will be looked after, and we can trust Thorndyke to clear up the
  obscurities of the case."</p>

  <p>The other letter was from Dr. Thorndyke himself, and confirmed Jasper's
  account.</p>

  <p>"Your friend, Mr. Davenant," it said, "called on me to-day to ask me to
  watch the proceedings of the inquest on your behalf, which I would have done
  with great pleasure if I had been at liberty. But I had just received
  instructions from the Home Office to look into the case and give evidence at
  the adjourned inquest; so I referred your friend to Mr. Cawley, who is an
  excellent counsel and will be able to do all that is necessary."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Davenant expressed great disappointment that I should be, as he
  expressed it, 'retained by the other side.' But I pointed out to him that
  there is no 'other side.' I am not a 'witness advocate.' My evidence would be
  the same whichever side employed me. I never undertake to represent a
  particular interest, but merely to obtain what facts I can and give those
  facts impartially in my evidence and I always make it clear to clients that
  they employ me at their own risk&mdash;at the risk that the facts elicited
  may be unfavourable to them. So, although I am not retained by you, I shall
  act precisely as if I were. I shall find out all I can, and tell the court
  all I know. This will, presumably, be entirely in your interest.</p>

  <p>"And now I am going to ask a favour of you. I wish to examine and make a
  plan of the premises at Lyon's Inn Chambers, and I understand that the
  tenancy of the Chambers is now vested in you. Will you be so kind as to lend
  me the keys and authorise me to make this survey? If you will, I shall be
  able to make my evidence more complete."</p>

  <p>If Jasper's letter had alarmed me, Dr. Thorndyke's positively terrified
  me. The cool, relentless impartiality, the unhuman indifference to everything
  but the actual truth that the letter conveyed appalled me; and I even seemed
  to read a direct menace in its tone. If I had employed him, I should have
  done so at my own risk; so he seemed to hint. His intention was to "find out
  all he could and tell the court all he knew." How much would he find out? How
  much did he know already? He had a verbatim report of the evidence so far. He
  had Mrs. Gregg's statement that "they seemed to be talking about suicide." He
  would know all about suggestion and silent willing. Was it possible that he
  already knew that I had sent that wretched man on his last journey? When I
  recalled all that my father had said of his amazing powers of inference; when
  I remembered how unerringly he had detected the reservations in Mr. Otway's
  evidence and mine; I could not but feel that my chance of keeping my guilty
  secret was infinitesimal. The probability was that it was discovered
  already.</p>

  <p>As to his request, obviously I had no choice but to grant it, and I was on
  the point of writing to Mr. Isaacs to instruct him to hand the keys to Dr.
  Thorndyke when it occurred to me that it might be well to avoid unnecessarily
  taking the former gentleman into my confidence. I knew nothing about Mr.
  Isaacs, and was not particularly prepossessed by him; not did I know the
  object of the proposed survey of the premises, concerning which indeed I was
  somewhat mystified and rather uncomfortable. Eventually I decided to call at
  Mr. Isaacs' office for the keys and deliver them myself to Dr. Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>Accordingly I wrote a short a note to the latter informing him of my
  intentions, and on the following morning betook myself to Mr. Isaacs' office,
  which was situated in New Inn. I could see that my visit was somewhat
  unexpected, and evidently aroused the solicitor's curiosity.</p>

  <p>"You will see," said be, "that the keys are all labelled, and I have made
  a rough inventory of the furniture and effects. Perhaps you would like me to
  come with you and check it."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said I, "but I don't think I will check the inventory to-day.
  We will postpone that until I take formal possession. At present I am merely
  going to take a look at the premises."</p>

  <p>When I said this, I had, of course, no intention of going to the chambers
  at all, but as I walked down Wych Street with the keys in my bag, I reflected
  that, as I had said I was going, I had better go. Moreover, it was possible
  that the arrangement of the place had been disturbed and that some things
  might need to be replaced; for I assumed that Dr. Thorndyke would wish to see
  the premises as they were on the night of the tragedy. And then I was not
  without some curiosity concerning this place which had been the scene of
  events so momentous to me.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of Wych Street I turned round by the "Rising Sun" and walked
  along Holywell Street to the entrance of Lyon's Inn Chambers; and as I, once
  again, ascended the gloomy stone stairs, the sinister atmosphere of the place
  enveloped me as it had done on previous occasions, and induced a vague
  sensation of fear. When I reached the landing and stood at the ill portal,
  the feeling had grown so pronounced that I hesitated for a while to enter the
  chambers. At length I summoned up courage to insert the key, and as the
  massive door swung open I stepped into the lobby.</p>

  <p>But my nervousness by no means wore off. Leaving the outer door ajar, I
  walked quickly down the corridor, peered into the kitchen and the little,
  empty room that had presumably been occupied by Mrs. Gregg&mdash;apparently
  the furniture had belonged to her&mdash;crossed the living-room and entered
  the bedroom. Here nothing seemed to have been changed. Even the great peg
  &mdash;on which, of course, my eye lit instantly&mdash;still bore the end of
  crimson rope; the bed had been stripped, but the bedside table stood intact
  even to the bottle of veronal tablets. I looked about me quickly and
  nervously, noting the arrangement of the furniture and comparing it with my
  recollections of that unforgettable night; and when I had decided that it was
  unaltered, I turned to go.</p>

  <p>As I crossed the living-room, the large, wardrobe-like cupboard attracted
  my attention, and I recalled the mysterious sounds that had seemed to issue
  from it. Was it possible, I wondered, that Mrs. Gregg could have been
  concealed in it that night and have overheard those last incriminating words
  of mine. She had not referred to them in her evidence, but the inquiry was
  not finished yet. I resolved to settle the question whether it was physically
  possible for her to have been concealed in the cupboard, and having tried the
  door and found it locked, I turned the keys over one by one until I found one
  labelled "cupboard in living-room." It was a rather unusual type of key, with
  a solid stem instead of the more usual barrel, and when I had inserted it and
  opened the door, I noticed that the key-hole passed right through the lock,
  so that the door could be locked from the inside as well as the outside. The
  cupboard itself was fitted like a wardrobe with a single shelf just above my
  eye level, beneath which a short woman like Mrs. Gregg could have easily
  stood upright. Thus the construction of the cupboard and the peculiar form of
  the lock made it at least possible that an eavesdropper might have been
  concealed that night; and that was all that I could say.</p>

  <p>Before shutting the door I stood on tip-toe to see if there was anything
  on the shelf. In the semi-darkness of the interior I could see some kind of
  metallic object, and reaching in, took hold of it. As I drew it into the
  light of day I gave a gasp of astonishment. It was my father's stick. I took
  it down and turned it over curiously in my hands, marvelling how it should
  have got into this receptacle; and a turned it over, there came into view a
  flattened dent on the silver knob covered by a thick smear of blood to which
  two hairs had stuck. I looked at the hairs closely, but could come to no
  opinion as to whether or not they were my father's. One of these was white
  and the other a brownish grey. My father's hair had been iron grey as a
  whole, but I could not judge what the appearance of individual hairs might
  have been. If these were really his, then the man who had gone to his account
  was my father's murderer. It was a dreadful thought, but yet not without a
  certain compensation. As I looked at this relic of that day of wrath I felt
  my heart hardening. If the message that it bore was a true message, then I
  need have no more compunction for what I had done. If I had known with
  certainty that Mr. Otway had killed my father, those words which had slipped
  from me subconsciously would have been consciously uttered with full and
  deliberate intent and without a qualm.</p>

  <p>I stood for a while with the stick in my hand considering what I should do
  with it. That its mysterious reappearance would create a complication I
  plainly foresaw, but to take it away and conceal it would be not only
  dishonest but very unsafe; for it was almost certain that someone knew of its
  existence. It must have been seen when the inventory was taken. Eventually I
  replaced it on the shelf and locked the cupboard; and having put the keys
  back in my bag made my way to the door, which had been standing ajar all this
  time.</p>

  <p>As I walked slowly to the Temple, I turned over in my mind the
  significance of this strange discovery. Someone must have known of the
  presence of this stick in the chambers, and that someone was either Mr. Otway
  or Mrs. Gregg. But both had declared positively that they had never seen it;
  and it was difficult to imagine why either of them should have kept it hidden
  away and disclaimed all knowledge of it. I could make nothing of the problem.
  Only one thing was clear to me. I must let Dr. Thorndyke know of my
  discovery; for it did not incriminate me in any way and might give him a clue
  to some of the elements of the mystery, the unravelment of which would be to
  my advantage.</p>

  <p>The door of Dr. Thorndyke's chambers was opened by Mr. Polton, who greeted
  me with a friendly smile, all creases and wrinkles.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to say that the Doctor is not at home, ma'am," said he; "and he
  will be sorry, too. He would have liked to see you, I am sure."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter, Mr. Polton," said I. "I have only called to leave
  these keys. But I should like to leave a message. Will you ask him not to
  disturb things more than he can help, as the inventory has not been checked
  yet; and will you tell him that the stick is in the large cupboard in the
  living-room? You won't forget, will you?"</p>

  <p>"I shan't forget," he replied, with a slight emphasis on the last word,
  "but I never trust my memory in important matters. Would you mind writing the
  Doctor a little note?"</p>

  <p>He produced writing materials and placed a chair by the table, and I sat
  down and briefly put my message into writing. When I had given him the
  note&mdash;which he set in a conspicuous place on the mantel-piece&mdash;he
  looked at me as if he had something to say, and I waited to hear what it
  was.</p>

  <p>"I have got an old verge watch to pieces upstairs," he said at length. "I
  don't know whether you would care to have a look at the movement. It's worth
  looking at. If you want to know what workmanship is, you should look at the
  inside of a good, old watch."</p>

  <p>I was not, at the moment, much interested in watches or workmanship, but I
  could not resist his companionable enthusiasm&mdash;to say nothing of the
  implied compliment. So we went up together to the workshop, where he
  exhibited with a craftsman's delight the delicate wheels, the engraved plates
  and the little chased pillars, and even brought out a microscope that I might
  appreciate the finish bestowed on the links of a fusee-chain that was hardly
  thicker than a horse-hair.</p>

  <p>As the day of the adjourned inquest drew near, my
  anxiety&mdash;intensified by the consciousness of my guilty secret&mdash;grew
  more acute. My position was, as Jasper had said, a difficult one in any case.
  But the really alarming element in it was the introduction of Dr. Thorndyke
  into the case. The suggestion factor in the suicide would probably remain
  unsuspected by the coroner and the jury. But would it escape Dr. Thorndyke's
  almost superhuman penetration? I could not believe that it would, for the
  hint of it was plain in Mrs. Gregg's evidence. And if it were detected, it
  would be revealed. Of that I had not the shadow of a doubt. Dr. Thorndyke was
  a kindly, even a genial man; but he was Justice personified. He would
  investigate the case with relentless accuracy and completeness; and he would
  tell the truth to the last word. Of that I felt certain. If he held my fate
  in his hands I was lost.</p>

  <p>Of the view of the case taken by outsiders I had an unpleasant
  illustration the day before the adjourned sitting. It was furnished by an
  article in an evening paper that I had taken up to my room to read. Glancing
  over its pages, my eyes was caught by the words "Lyon's Inn," and I read as
  follows:</p>

  <p>"The new Lyon's Inn seems to be emulating the reputation of the old.
  Within that ancient precinct occurred the famous Weare murder, forgotten of
  the present generation, but immortalised in those rather brutal verses of Tom
  Hood's:</p>

  <p>"'They cut his throat from ear to ear, His brains they battered in. His
  name was Mr. William Weare, He lived in Lyon's Inn.'</p>

  <p>"The drama of Lyon's Inn Chambers, however, is not a murder&mdash;at least
  we hope not. It is at present regarded as a suicide. But there are some queer
  features in the case. There is, for instance, a handsome young wife, who, it
  seems, flatly refused to live with her elderly husband from the very wedding
  day; there is a series of unaccountable anonymous letters; and there is a
  rumour of a hoard of precious gems spirited away from the chambers,
  apparently on the very night when Mr. Lewis Otway hanged himself from a peg
  on his bedroom wall. So the adjourned inquest, which opens at 11 a.m.
  to-morrow, may elicit some curious revelations."</p>

  <p>As I laid the paper down, a cold hand seemed to settle on my heart. The
  writer had exaggerated nothing. He had not even stated all the accusing
  facts. But even so, put quite impartially, the article exhibited me as the
  central figure of the tragedy, as the visible agent of the sinister events
  that had befallen in those ill-omened chambers. And could I say that it
  misstated the case? Of the anonymous letters, indeed, and the stolen
  gems&mdash;if stolen they were&mdash;I knew nothing. But the central fact of
  the case was Mr. Otway's death. For that the coroner held me accountable.
  And, though he misjudged the evidence as to the means, I could not but admit
  that the coroner was right. The coming inquiry was, in effect, the trial of
  Helen Otway.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-3-26"
     id="ch-3-26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; THE ADJOURNED INQUIRY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE second sitting of the inquest was a much more portentous
  affair than the first. The large room, or hall, in which it was held was
  nearly full when I entered, and it was evident that a considerable proportion
  of the occupants were spectators, attracted hither, no doubt, by the
  picturesque comments of the newspapers. But besides these were a number of
  persons connected with the inquiry. Behind the coroner's chair sat a group of
  police officers. Mr. Isaacs and Mr. Hyams were again present; the witnesses
  now included Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and a youngish man of a pronouncedly
  Hebrew type, who sat next to them. The side of the long table allotted to the
  press was filled by reporters&mdash;among whom I noticed the gentleman
  employed by Dr. Thorndyke, and there was one or two men whom I judged to be
  lawyers representing the various parties interested.</p>

  <p>My own counsel, Mr. Cawley, a shrewd-looking man of about thirty-five,
  introduced himself to me as I took the seat reserved for me, and gave me a
  few words of advice.</p>

  <p>"I think," said he, "I have had all the necessary instructions from Mr.
  Davenant, who, I see, is here." (I had had an instantaneous glimpse of him as
  I entered the room.) "His impression is that the coroner is disposed to put a
  certain amount of blame on you for your husband's death. If that is so, you
  will have to be rather careful about answering questions, especially any
  questions that the jury may put. Don't be in a hurry to answer any doubtful
  questions. Give me time to object if they seem inclined to go beyond the
  evidence."</p>

  <p>I promised to bear his advice in mind, and then asked:</p>

  <p>"Do you know if Dr. Thorndyke is giving evidence to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I presume he is," was the reply; "but I notice that he is not present and
  that his reporter is."</p>

  <p>At this point the coroner laid down the papers which he had been looking
  over, and opened the proceedings with a short address to the jury.</p>

  <p>"The adjournment of this inquiry, gentlemen," said he, "which was decided
  upon a fortnight ago, is amply justified by the mass of new facts which are
  now available. These new facts bear chiefly on the property which, as you
  heard at the last sitting, was believed to be missing; but in other
  directions they throw a very curious light on the case. The first witness
  will be Superintendent Miller, of the Criminal Investigation Department."</p>

  <p>As his name was spoken, the officer rose and took his place by the table.
  He took the oath, and disposed of the preliminaries with professional
  facility, and then waited gravely for the coroner's next question.</p>

  <p>"You had some knowledge of the deceased, Lewis Otway, and his affairs, I
  understand?" said the coroner.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have known of his existence for more than twenty years."</p>

  <p>"Will you tell us what you know of him?"</p>

  <p>"I first made his acquaintance about twenty-three years ago. He was then
  practising as a solicitor&mdash;chiefly as a police-court advocate&mdash;and
  was known by his real name, Lewis Levy, which he subsequently changed to
  Otway. After a time, he began to engage in business as a money lender, and it
  was at this time that he took the name of Otway, Presently he began to
  combine with money-lending a certain amount of trafficking in precious
  stones, and it was then that the police began to keep a somewhat close watch
  on him, with the idea that he might be also acting as a receiver. We never
  really had anything against him, but we always had the impression that he did
  some business as a middleman, or disposer of stolen jewels.</p>

  <p>"When I first knew him, he had living with him a young woman, named Rachel
  Goldstein. She was nominally his housekeeper, but there were two
  children&mdash;a boy named Morris, and a girl named Judith&mdash;whom he
  admitted to be his. When he changed his name to Otway, Rachel Goldstein took
  the name of Gregg, and used to pass as a Scotch-woman. The children lived
  with their parents until they grew up, when Otway (or Levy) provided for them
  in a way that made the police watch still more closely. Judith married a
  David Samuels, who traded under the name of Campbell as a dealer in works of
  art, especially goldsmith's work and jewellery; and Morris Goldstein started
  as a dealer in antiques, with a shop in Hand Court, and some workshops in
  Mansell Street, Whitechapel, where most of the antiques were made.</p>

  <p>"Now both these men were practical working jewellers. It was believed that
  Otway financed them both, and it was known that he was the lessee of the
  premises that they occupied. Moreover, as soon as they were established in
  business, Otway gradually abandoned the money-lending, and occupied himself
  almost exclusively in dealing in gem stones. He was an exceedingly good judge
  of stones, and was quite successful as a legitimate dealer; but the police
  had an impression that he did a considerable amount of business that was not
  legitimate. I want it to be quite clear that I am not making any accusations;
  I am referring merely to an impression that the police had; it may have been
  quite a mistaken impression, but I mention it because the matter bears
  directly on this enquiry.</p>

  <p>"The idea of the police, then, was that Otway dealt to a considerable
  extent in stolen property. We supposed that he obtained this
  property&mdash;precious stones, without the mounts&mdash;not from the
  thieves, but from the receivers, and that he disposed of them with the aid of
  his son and son-in-law. Both those men did a fairly large trade in high-class
  jewellery. They did not touch commercial goods, but dealt exclusively in work
  produced individually by skilled goldsmiths and jewellers, some of whom they
  kept regularly employed. They also did a good deal of repairing and
  re-setting, and their transactions were always with private customers, not
  with the trade.</p>

  <p>"Our idea of the way it was worked was this: We thought that when Otway
  had got a collection of stolen stones he would pass on some of them to these
  two men. They would then commission their craftsmen to make some articles of
  jewellery, and would provide them with stones which had been bought from the
  regular dealers, and the purchase of which could be proved if necessary.
  Then, when the jewels were delivered&mdash;or even after they had been sold
  to a private buyer&mdash;Campbell or Goldstein would take the purchased
  stones out of their settings and replace them by stolen stones. And a similar
  method could have been employed when jewels were brought for alteration,
  repair or re-setting. This kind of substitution would be very difficult to
  trace, for it is not easy to identify particular stones and prove that they
  are not the ones referred to in the dealers' receipts. As a matter of fact we
  never did trace any stolen gems excepting on a single occasion; and then the
  evidence was not good enough for us to risk a prosecution.</p>

  <p>"And now we come to the case that concerns this enquiry. About a year ago
  there was a burglary at the premises of Messrs. Middleburg, of New Bond
  Street, the well-known jewellers, and, among other things, a collection of
  valuable stones, worth about five thousand pounds, was carried off. It was a
  small collection, but all the stones were individually of considerable value,
  and several of them were remarkable, either in respect of size or other
  peculiarities. The collection has never been traced, and none of the stones
  has reappeared either here or abroad; and the police have reason to believe
  that the whole collection is still in this country.</p>

  <p>"When these stones disappeared so completely, the police formed the
  opinion that they had passed into the possession of Otway, and that he was
  holding them up until an opportunity occurred to issue them one by one. At
  this time he was living at Maidstone&mdash;he had been there a year or two,
  but he had kept his old chambers at Lyon's Inn, and often stayed in them for
  a week or more at a time. Last May or June he left Maidstone and came back to
  his old chambers, and we then began to keep a closer watch on him.</p>

  <p>"About a couple of months ago he bought&mdash;or rather took on
  approval&mdash;from Mr. Hyams, of Hatton Garden, a collection of stones of
  which I have seen the list. These stones were carefully selected by Otway,
  and the remarkable thing about them is that, taken as a whole, they are
  singularly like the stolen collection. Among the stolen stones, for instance,
  there were two large tourmalines, one green and one deep blue, both table
  stones with step-cut backs; four emeralds, two step-cut and two cut <i>en
  cabochon</i>; two large chrysoberyls, one brilliant-cut, green and one en
  cabochon, yellow; one pale-blue diamond; and one pale-pink. Now, the
  collection taken from Mr. Hyams includes tourmalines, emeralds, chrysoberyls,
  and diamonds, of almost exactly the same size, colour and cutting; and there
  are many other passable duplicates of the stolen stones.</p>

  <p>"When I became aware of this I inferred that Otway was making arrangements
  to release the stolen stones, and I caused a still closer watch to be kept on
  him; but up to the present not one of the missing stones has been discovered.
  Now I understand that the Hyams collection has disappeared; and if that is
  so, it seems probable that the person who has taken it is also in possession
  of the stolen collection. But that, of course, is only a guess."</p>

  <p>"Quite so!" said the coroner, "and it is a matter that is more in your
  province than in ours. Is there anything more that you have to tell us that
  is relevant to the enquiry?'</p>

  <p>"No, I think that is all."</p>

  <p>"You will be remaining here, in case we want to refer to you again?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I want to hear Dr. Thorndyke's evidence, and, of course, I want to
  hear the verdict."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you may have a long time to wait, for I have had a telegram
  from Dr. Thorndyke saying that he has been detained at Maidstone, and has
  missed his train. It is a great nuisance for us all. However, we will go on
  with the evidence. The next witness will be Mr. Samuel Isaacs."</p>

  <p>As the superintendent retired to his seat and Mr. Isaacs approached the
  table, I reflected rapidly on what I had just heard. Dr. Thorndyke had
  apparently been down to Maidstone. Was his visit connected with the present
  enquiry? And if so, what was it that he had been investigating? The locality
  suggested some kind of research in which I was concerned, but at the nature
  of that research I could make no guess whatever. However, there was no time
  to speculate on the subject, for Mr. Isaacs had been sworn, and was ready to
  begin his evidence.</p>

  <p>"You were solicitor to the deceased, I understand, Mr. Isaacs?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I am one of the executors of his will."</p>

  <p>"In that capacity have you heard of any property said to be missing from
  the chambers which he occupied?</p>

  <p>"I have. Mr. Hyams has made a claim to have restored to him a parcel of
  precious stones, valued at about four thousand pounds, which, he states, was
  his property, and which he asserts the deceased had in his possession."</p>

  <p>"Have you examined the premises with a view to discovering that
  property?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have examined the premises very thoroughly, and have made a
  complete inventory of all the effects of the deceased. I have gone through
  the contents of the safe and all other receptacles, and have checked the
  property which he had deposited at his bank. I have made a most exhaustive
  search, but have failed to find any trace of the parcel referred to, or of
  any precious stones whatever."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that you may have overlooked the parcel?"</p>

  <p>"I should say it is impossible. My opinion is that the parcel is not on
  the premises, and it certainly is not at the bank."</p>

  <p>The coroner and a legal-looking gentleman at the table both noted down
  this reply. Then the former said: "You are, no doubt, in a position to tell
  us what was the state of the deceased man's affairs. Was there any kind of
  financial embarrassment?"</p>

  <p>"I should say, certainly not. The gross value of the estate&mdash;which is
  entirely personal&mdash;is a little over seventeen thousand pounds: and the
  liabilities, so far as they are known to me, are quite trivial."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell us roughly, what are the main provisions of the will, that
  is, if it has been proved?</p>

  <p>"It has been proved. The principal beneficiary is the widow, who receives
  eight thousand pounds, and the lease of the chambers in Lyon's Inn, with the
  furniture and effects, and is made residuary legatee. Rachel Gregg&mdash;or
  Goldstein&mdash;receives one thousand, and Morris and Judith, each two
  thousand pounds, and the lease of the premises in which they respectively
  carry on their business. There are a few small legacies&mdash;less than a
  thousand pounds in the aggregate; so that there will probably be a residue of
  about three thousand pounds, which will go to the widow."</p>

  <p>"What is the date of this will?"</p>

  <p>"It is dated the 10th June last."</p>

  <p>"Do you know whether the provisions of the will were known to the widow,
  or the other beneficiaries?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know. They were not disclosed by me until probate had been
  granted."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said the coroner. "I think we need not trouble you any
  further, unless the jury wish to ask any questions."</p>

  <p>The jury did not; but the legal-looking gentleman at the table did, and
  springing up like a Jack-in-the-box, he addressed the coroner.</p>

  <p>"As representing Mr. Hyams, sir," said he, "I should like to ask the
  witness whether, in the event of the missing gems not coming to light, their
  loss would be chargeable to the estate?"</p>

  <p>The countenance of Mr. Isaacs hereupon assumed that peculiar expression
  known to students of sculpture as "the archaic smile."</p>

  <p>"You are asking me to admit liability," he replied; "I can't do that, you
  know. There is a recognised procedure in these cases, with which I have no
  doubt you are acquainted."</p>

  <p>The questioner sat down with a jerk, and Mr. Cawley stood up.</p>

  <p>"May I ask the witness, sir, whether, in the event of this loss being
  adjudged to be chargeable to the estate, that loss would affect equally all
  the beneficiaries?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Mr. Isaacs, "it would not. It would fall, in the first
  place, on the residuary legatee. It would only affect the estate as a whole
  in so far as the amount of the charge exceeded that of the residue."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Mr. Cawley. "There is one other question that I should
  like to ask. The present will is dated the 10th of last June. Did the
  execution of that will involve the revocation of a previously-existing
  will?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it did. After his marriage deceased re-acknowledged the existing
  will by a fresh signature and attestation, but he revoked this will when he
  made the new one."</p>

  <p>"Could you tell us who were the beneficiaries under that will?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Isaacs fixed a thoughtful (and somewhat beady) eye on the coroner's
  pewter ink-pot, and cogitated for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary, sir, for me to answer that question?" he asked at
  length, looking up at the coroner.</p>

  <p>"Is the point material?" the latter asked, looking at Mr. Cawley.</p>

  <p>"I submit, sir, that it may become highly important," was the reply.</p>

  <p>The coroner reflected with his eyes fixed on Mr. Cawley. Then he nodded.
  "Yes," he said, "I think you are right. We must ask you to answer the
  question, Mr. Isaacs."</p>

  <p>Mr. Isaacs bowed. "The beneficiaries under that will were Rachel
  Goldstein, Morris Goldstein, and Judith Samuels."</p>

  <p>"In what proportions was the property devised?"</p>

  <p>"The bulk of the personalty was divided between Morris and Judith. Rachel
  Goldstein&mdash;or Gregg&mdash;received two thousand pounds, but she was also
  the residuary legatee."</p>

  <p>"And the value of the estate?</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you that. I only know what it is now."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cawley sat down, and Mr. Isaacs retired to his seat. Then the coroner
  pronounced the name of Mr. Hyams, and its owner took his place by the
  table.</p>

  <p>"We have heard, Mr. Hyams," said the coroner, "of certain property of
  yours which was in the deceased man's custody. Will you give us a few
  particulars of the transaction. When, for instance, did it come into the
  possession of the deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Two months ago&mdash;on the tenth of August, when the deceased called at
  my office, and asked me to let him have a selection of stones for a special
  purpose. He said that he had an opportunity of disposing of a number of
  pieces of jewellery to a wealthy American gentleman, and that he had
  discovered an extremely clever artist whom he proposed to commission to make
  them. They were to be important pieces, chiefly pendants, brooches, and
  bracelets. The stones were to be exceptional in size and quality, and he
  wanted an assortment for Mr. Campbell&mdash;who was conducting the
  transaction&mdash;to show the intending purchaser. He had a list in his
  pocket-book, which he referred to as he made his selection from my stock. The
  stones which he selected were rather unusual&mdash;the sort of stones that
  appeal to collectors and connoisseurs, rather than ordinary wearers of
  jewels. And some of them were very valuable; one ruby alone that he took was
  worth fifteen hundred pounds. The total value of the parcel that he carried
  away with him was four thousand two hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"I understand that he did not pay you for them?"</p>

  <p>"No; he was not proposing to keep them all. They were a selection to show
  to the customer. I made out a full list, and he signed a receipt at the foot
  of it. I had known deceased for many years, and had often had similar
  dealings with him."</p>

  <p>"And did he never return these stones, or any part of the collection?"</p>

  <p>"No. From the time that he left my office with the stones in his pocket I
  never saw him or heard from him again."</p>

  <p>This was the sum of Mr. Hyams' evidence; and when he had retired the name
  of Judith Samuels was called. The new witness took her place at the table,
  and, after the usual preliminaries, proceeded to give her evidence.</p>

  <p>"I am the wife of David Samuels who trades under the name of Donald
  Campbell. He is a dealer in works of art, principally goldsmith's work and
  jewellery. He is a practical jeweller himself, but most of the alterations
  and repairs are put out. The new work that he sells, or which is commissioned
  by customers, is executed for him by independent goldsmiths, not by workmen
  employed by him."</p>

  <p>"You visited the deceased on the night preceding his death, I understand,
  is that so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I came to his chambers about half-past six, and left about seven
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice anything unusual in his manner or appearance?"</p>

  <p>"He was not looking very well, and he seemed rather depressed but he
  brightened up as we talked. He was very much interested in the business which
  I had come to discuss."</p>

  <p>"What was the nature of that business?"</p>

  <p>"It was connected with a collection of stones that he had got on approval
  from Mr. Hyams to carry out a commission that he expected to get from a very
  wealthy American gentleman, to whom he had an introduction. He did not
  disclose the name of the gentleman, but it was understood that if he secured
  the commission, my husband should conduct the negotiations, and get the work
  executed."</p>

  <p>"Did you gather that he had the stones in his possession?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; he showed them to me. They were in a small wooden box, the different
  kinds of stones wrapped up separately in little paper packets. He took the
  box from a deed-box on the table by his bed-side, and put it back there when
  he had shown me the stones."</p>

  <p>"Did you make any arrangements as to the disposal of these stones?"</p>

  <p>"No final arrangements. He advised that we should get some of our artist
  goldsmiths to submit designs for the customer to see; and he suggested that
  my husband should ask Mrs. Otway to design and execute a pendant to take some
  of the finest stones."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Otway!" exclaimed the coroner. "What Mrs. Otway do you refer
  to?"</p>

  <p>"I mean Helen Otway, the wife of the deceased."</p>

  <p>"Are we to understand that Mrs. Otway is a designer of jewellery?"</p>

  <p>"She is not only a designer; she is a practical goldsmith, and a very
  clever one too. My husband admires her work exceedingly and has paid her some
  very high prices. He paid her, for instance, twenty-five guineas for a set of
  silver tea-spoons."</p>

  <p>The looks of astonishment that the coroner, the jury, and the press-men
  bestowed on me might, in other circumstances, have flattered my vanity. Now,
  I could see that Mrs. Campbell, without (so far as I knew) departing one
  single jot from the truth, was enveloping me in the most hideous
  entanglements.</p>

  <p>After a pause&mdash;filled in with strenuous note-taking&mdash;the coroner
  again addressed the witness. "It has been given in evidence that the deceased
  had received a number of anonymous letters. Do you know anything about these
  letters?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing beyond what I heard when the evidence was given."</p>

  <p>"Have you any means of judging who wrote these letters?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard the evidence, and I can make a pretty good guess who wrote
  them."</p>

  <p>"That is not quite what I mean. Have you any information about them other
  than what you gathered from the evidence?"</p>

  <p>"No; I never heard of them until then."</p>

  <p>This concluded Mrs. Campbell's evidence. When she had retired Mrs. Gregg
  was recalled and questioned concerning the missing stones.</p>

  <p>"Did you know that deceased had these stones in his possession?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He showed them to me on one occasion, and I often saw him looking at
  them. He was very fond of precious stones. He used to set them out on a small
  square of black velvet, and try them in different lights, and look at them
  through a magnifying glass."</p>

  <p>"When did you last see these stones?"</p>

  <p>"After Mrs. Campbell&mdash;that is the last witness&mdash;had left and
  just before Mrs. Otway arrived. Deceased was then sitting up in bed looking
  at a large green stone. I reminded him that Mrs. Otway was due at eight, and
  he then put the stones back in their box, and put the box away in the
  deed-box that was on the table."</p>

  <p>"When did you first learn that the stones were missing?"</p>

  <p>"The day after the discovery that the deceased had committed suicide, when
  Mrs. Otway came to the chambers with Mr. Hyams and the coroner's officer. She
  came to search for the anonymous letters, and she went straight to the
  deed-box, and there they were. But the stones were not there. I saw her take
  all the things out of the deed box for Mr. Hyams to see and there were no
  stones there."</p>

  <p>"Thank you." said the coroner "That will do. We must now, gentlemen, see
  if Mrs Otway can give us any further information."</p>

  <p>I once more took my place at the table and was again sensible of a
  generally heightened curiosity on the past of the jury and the
  spectators.</p>

  <p>"We may as well dispose of the question of the missing stones," said the
  coroner; "for though it does not affect our enquiry directly but is rather
  the business of the police, it seems to have an important, indirect bearing.
  You have heard, Mrs. Otway, the evidence of Judith Samuels, and Rachel
  Goldstein&mdash;or Gregg. Can you throw any light on the disappearance of
  these stones?"</p>

  <p>"No, I cannot."</p>

  <p>"Did you know that deceased had these valuable stones in his
  possession?"</p>

  <p>"No; I never heard of the stones until Mr. Hyams called on me on the
  evening of the day on which Mr. Otway's death was discovered."</p>

  <p>"Do you know, or have you any idea, where those stones are now?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know, and I have no idea where they are."</p>

  <p>"Did you know that deceased was a dealer in precious stones?"</p>

  <p>"No; my father told me that deceased collected gem-stones, and that he
  sometimes had dealings in them. But I supposed that he was merely a
  collector, not a professional dealer."</p>

  <p>"How long had you known deceased when you married him?"</p>

  <p>"I had known of his existence about a year, but I had hardly ever spoken
  to him. He was virtually a stranger to me."</p>

  <p>"Had you never heard of the suicidal tendency in his family?"</p>

  <p>"Never until the night preceding his death, when he told me."</p>

  <p>"It has been stated that you are a practical goldsmith, and that you have
  executed work for Mr. Samuels, or Campbell. Is that true?"</p>

  <p>"I work as a goldsmith and I have sold some of my productions to Mr.
  Campbell; but I have never been employed by him. I work as an independent
  artist."</p>

  <p>"Has he ever supplied you with precious stones?"</p>

  <p>"No. I purchase my own materials."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever done any alterations or resettings for him?"</p>

  <p>"No. I have done no work of any kind for him, or anyone else. I work on my
  own account, and sell what I make."</p>

  <p>The coroner nodded, and glanced over his notes. After a pause he asked:
  "At what time on the night of your visit to deceased did you leave his
  chambers?"</p>

  <p>"A little before ten o'clock."</p>

  <p>"What was the condition of deceased when you left? Did he seem
  particularly depressed or worried?"</p>

  <p>"He was asleep when I left."</p>

  <p>"Asleep!" exclaimed the coroner, "How long had he been asleep?"</p>

  <p>"Not very long; perhaps a quarter of an hour. When he took his usual dose
  of veronal he asked me to stay with him until he went to sleep, and I did
  so."</p>

  <p>"I see that the housekeeper states that when she entered the living-room
  in the morning, the bedroom door was wide open, and the gas full on. What was
  the condition of affairs when you left?"</p>

  <p>"The gas was full on, and I did not shut the bedroom door. I was not aware
  that the housekeeper had gone to bed and assumed that she would look in on
  deceased and make what arrangements were usual for the night."</p>

  <p>"But if you had turned down the gas, and shut the bedroom door, that would
  have prevented the house keeper from going to deceased."</p>

  <p>"No. It did not appear to matter either way."</p>

  <p>"When you went away, did you leave your hand-bag behind?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I had hung it on the back of my chair, and when I got up to go, I
  forgot about it."</p>

  <p>"When did you discover that you had left it behind?"</p>

  <p>"I first remembered it when I halled a cab at the corner of Holywell
  Street to take me home."</p>

  <p>"Why did you not then go back for it?"</p>

  <p>"I did not like to disturb Mrs. Gregg and deceased, as it was so
  late."</p>

  <p>"Was your purse in the bag?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but that was of no consequence. I knew there would be someone
  sitting up who could pay the cabman."</p>

  <p>"The housekeeper has told us that you came to fetch the bag on the
  following day."</p>

  <p>"Yes, in the afternoon, about three. It was then that I first heard of Mr.
  Otway's death."</p>

  <p>"The housekeeper states that, when she told you what had happened, you
  fell down in a dead faint. Is that so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It gave me a great shock, especially as Mrs. Gregg told me the bad
  news so very abruptly."</p>

  <p>"Were you expecting to hear that the deceased had committed suicide?"</p>

  <p>"No; the subject was not in my mind."</p>

  <p>"Is that not rather remarkable, having regard to your conversation with
  deceased on the previous night?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. That conversation had certainly given me the impression
  that there was a danger that deceased might be driven to suicide if this
  persecution were continued. But I had not supposed that the danger was
  immediate."</p>

  <p>"And that pitiful letter that you received from deceased? Did that convey
  no note of warning?"</p>

  <p>"At the time when I received it I was not aware of any predisposition to
  suicide on the part of deceased. What he told me caused me some alarm, but he
  became so much calmer after our talk that I thought the danger was past, so
  far as the immediate future was concerned."</p>

  <p>"And when you went to his chambers on the following day, you felt no
  uneasiness as to what might have happened?"</p>

  <p>"No, the possibility that anything unusual might have happened was not in
  my mind at all."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the coroner, "it seems to me rather remarkable that the
  possibility did not even occur to you. However, we are dealing with the
  facts, and if those are the facts, there is no more to be said. We will now
  pass on to the consideration of the will. When did you first learn that
  deceased had made a fresh will?"</p>

  <p>"Four days ago, when I received a letter from Mr. Isaacs informing me of
  the fact that I was one of the beneficiaries."</p>

  <p>"Had deceased never mentioned to you that he had made a will in your
  favour? Was there no stipulation on your part at the time of the marriage
  that he should make such a will?</p>

  <p>"No. Nothing ever passed between us on the subject."</p>

  <p>"And had you no knowledge or belief that a will affecting you had been
  executed?"</p>

  <p>"I had no knowledge or belief that such a will had been executed nor any
  expectation that it would be. I did not consider myself as having any
  pecuniary claim on the deceased."</p>

  <p>"Did you not receive an allowance from deceased?"</p>

  <p>"No. He wished to make me an allowance, but I declined to accept it."</p>

  <p>"But you were entitled to an allowance for maintenance. Why did you refuse
  to accept it?</p>

  <p>"I did not consider that I had any claim on the deceased so long as I
  insisted on living apart."</p>

  <p>"Then do we understand that you subsist entirely on your own means or
  earnings?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, entirely."</p>

  <p>"Would you kindly tell us what those means and earnings respectively
  amount to? And what are their sources?"</p>

  <p>"I have a small private income&mdash;about sixty pounds a
  year&mdash;derived from the realisation of my father's estate. I cannot
  estimate my earnings very exactly, as I have been working only a few months.
  Probably I shall be able to earn from a hundred and fifty to two hundred
  pounds a year, when I am established. Up to the present I have sold all my
  work to Mr. Campbell."</p>

  <p>"How did you first become acquainted with Mr Campbell&mdash;or Samuels, to
  give him his correct name?"</p>

  <p>"Deceased recommended him to me when I first came to London. He stated
  that he had known him for many years."</p>

  <p>"Did you know that Mr. Campbell was related to deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Not until I heard it here to-day."</p>

  <p>The coroner considered a while, turning over his notes reflectively. At
  length he said, "Before you sit down, Mrs. Otway, I should like to ask you
  again about those anonymous letters. You have stated that you have no idea
  who wrote them."</p>

  <p>"That is so," I replied.</p>

  <p>"When you discussed them with deceased, did neither of you arrive at any
  conclusion as to who might have written them?"</p>

  <p>"Deceased assured me that he could make no guess as to who had sent them.
  Naturally, I could not, since all his acquaintances, whether friends or
  enemies, were unknown to me."</p>

  <p>"And you adhere to your statement that you know nothing about these
  letters?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about them whatever, excepting that deceased received
  them; and that I have only known by his telling me."</p>

  <p>"And with regard to your father's stick? You have stated that you have no
  knowledge as to what became of it, or where it is now. Do you adhere to that
  statement too?</p>

  <p>"That statement was correct when I made it; but the stick has since come
  to light."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed the coroner. "When and how did that happen?"</p>

  <p>"It occurred three days ago, when I went to look over the chambers in
  Lyon's Inn. I chanced to open a large cupboard in the living room, and there,
  on the single shelf at the top, I saw the stick lying at the back, and hardly
  visible in the deep shadow."</p>

  <p>"In-deed!" said the coroner, with a strong emphasis on the second
  syllable. It was perfectly evident that he did not believe me, and he made no
  secret of it. Nor were the jury any better impressed. In the silence that
  followed my statement they whispered together eagerly, and disbelief was writ
  large on the faces of them all.</p>

  <p>"Had you any particular occasion to look over the chambers?" the coroner
  asked after an interval.</p>

  <p>"Yes; I had received a letter from Dr. Thorndyke saying that be wished to
  make a survey of the premises and asking me to give him permission and the
  necessary facilities to do so. I accordingly went, on the following day, and
  fetched the keys from Mr. Isaacs to leave them at Dr. Thorndyke's chambers.
  On the way, I called in at Lyon's Inn to see what condition the chambers were
  in."</p>

  <p>"And to plant the stick for Dr. Thorndyke to find, eh?" said one of the
  jurors, with a truculent leer.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cawley rose instantly to protest, but he was anticipated by the
  coroner, who said severely: "That, sir, is quite out of order. Members of the
  jury must not suggest motives or actions on the part of witnesses which are
  not given in evidence. They may have their opinion but those opinions must
  not be expressed until all the evidence has been heard and the verdict has to
  be considered." Having administered this reproof, he again turned to me.</p>

  <p>"When you looked over the chambers, did you examine the other furniture
  and receptacles. Did you, for instance look in the other cupboards and
  drawers?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Only this one cupboard? Now what made you look into this cupboard in
  particular?"</p>

  <p>I saw the awkwardness of the question; but I also saw that a complete
  explanation of my motives would land me on much more dangerous ground. My
  immediate motive had been to ascertain what the inside of the cupboard was
  like, and this was as much as I dared tell.</p>

  <p>"I wished to see what kind of a cupboard it was&mdash;whether it had
  shelves, drawers, or simply an open space."</p>

  <p>"Did you take the stick out of the cupboard?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I took it out to examine it and see if the statement in the letter
  as to the bruise, the blood-smear and the hairs was correct."</p>

  <p>"And was the statement correct?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; there was a bruise on the silver knob, and a thick smear of what
  looked like dried blood, to which two hairs had stuck."</p>

  <p>"Did those hairs look to you like hairs from your father's head?"</p>

  <p>"I could not say. They might have been. They were short and looked as if
  they had come from the head of a grey-haired man. My father's hair was
  grey."</p>

  <p>"What did you do with the stick?"</p>

  <p>"I put it back in the cupboard."</p>

  <p>"Why did you not bring it here?"</p>

  <p>"I thought it best to leave it where I found it."</p>

  <p>"Are the keys of the chambers in your possession now?"</p>

  <p>"No; I left them at Dr. Thorndyke's chambers, and he has not yet returned
  them. I left a note informing him that the stick was in the cupboard."</p>

  <p>"May I ask why you did that?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Thorndyke mentioned in his letter that he was investigating the case
  on instructions from the Home Office, and I wished to give him any assistance
  that I could."</p>

  <p>"But," the coroner exclaimed irritably, "don't you understand that this
  court is investigating the case? That a coroner's court is the proper
  authority to carry out such investigations? I don't know why this medical
  specialist has been brought into the case at all. I have not asked for his
  assistance. It is quite irregular and most unnecessary. And how did this
  gentleman come to write to you?"</p>

  <p>"He wanted to survey the premises, and someone&mdash;I don't know
  who&mdash;had told him that I was the present lessee."</p>

  <p>The coroner grunted in evident displeasure. The importation of Dr.
  Thorndyke into the case was clearly a sore point, for he rejoined: "The whole
  affair is highly unsatisfactory. I am not clear that you had any right to
  give permission to any unofficial person to survey these premises without
  obtaining my consent; or that he had any right to ask you. The jury have
  surveyed the premises, and that ought to be enough. However, we shall see
  what comes of these mysterious investigations. Meanwhile, I think that is all
  we have to ask you, Mrs. Otway, unless the jury have any questions to
  put."</p>

  <p>The jury, warned, perhaps, by the result of the last question put by a
  juryman, had no question to ask; and I returned to my seat by Mr. Cawley, in
  time to hear Mr. Isaacs recalled.</p>

  <p>"You have heard," said the coroner, "the very remarkable evidence given by
  the last witness concerning the finding of a stick in a large cupboard in the
  living-room of the chambers in Lyon's Inn?"</p>

  <p>"I have."</p>

  <p>"In your previous evidence you stated that you had made a minute search of
  those chambers, and drawn up an inventory of their contents. Do you remember
  whether, when you made that search, you examined that particular
  cupboard?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember quite clearly that I examined it, and found it empty. I
  have marked it 'empty' in the inventory."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that it was really empty? Is it not possible that this stick
  lying in the shade on the shelf might have been overlooked?"</p>

  <p>"It is quite impossible. I made a most exhaustive search, and I used an
  electric torch for examining cupboard interiors. Moreover, the object that I
  was looking for a little parcel of precious stones&mdash;was much smaller,
  and less conspicuous than a walking stick. I could not have missed a large
  object like that. And I have quite a clear recollection of looking on that
  shelf&mdash;it was the only shelf in the cupboard&mdash;and throwing the
  light of the torch along it. I had to stand on tip-toe to see in distinctly,
  and so I suppose, had Mrs. Otway."</p>

  <p>"Do you swear that the cupboard was empty when you examined it?"</p>

  <p>"I swear that it was absolutely empty."</p>

  <p>The coroner entered the reply in his notes, and then asked: "Did you
  receive any communication from Dr Thorndyke respecting his proposed survey of
  the chambers at Lyon's Inn?"</p>

  <p>"He called to enquire in whom the tenancy of the chambers was vested, but
  did not state why he wanted know. I told him that the widow was the lessee. I
  don't know how he got her address. I didn't give it to him. I may say that
  when I had finished the inventory I locked up the chambers, and kept the keys
  until I delivered them up to Mrs. Otway."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said the coroner. "That is all I wanted you to tell us. And
  that, gentlemen," he continued, turning to the jury, "appears to be the whole
  of the evidence, with the exception of Dr. Thorndyke's; and the question now
  arises, what are we to do? Let me explain the position, and then you can
  decide on our procedure.</p>

  <p>"This enquiry was adjourned to enable the police to make some
  investigations in connection with it. On their application, Dr. John
  Thorndyke, who, I may inform you is an eminent medico-legal expert, was
  instructed by the Home Office to proceed to Maidstone to conduct an
  exhumation of the body of the late John Vardon, the father of Mrs. Otway. He
  was to make an examination of the body, and ascertain if possible, whether
  the cause of the said John Vardon's death was as stated at the inquest, or
  whether, as is hinted in these anonymous letters, he died from the effects of
  violence. The question is an important one, but it is more important to the
  police than to us. Then, it seems that the Home Office further instructed
  this gentleman to carry out an independent investigation into the facts of
  this case which we, in our humble and inefficient way, are trying to
  investigate. It is an extraordinary proceeding, and one that I do not in the
  least understand; but then I am not a medico-legal specialist. I am only a
  mere coroner, and you are only a mere coroner's jury. It is just as well that
  we should know our place.</p>

  <p>"Well, I understand that Dr. Thorndyke has made an examination of the body
  of Lewis Otway, and, as you have heard, he has made a survey of the deceased
  man's chambers. We, also, have surveyed these chambers, but apparently our
  survey doesn't count; and Dr. Shelburn, whose evidence you have heard,
  examined the body within a few hours of death. It would seem as if medical
  evidence were the last thing we want. Meanwhile I have had a telegram from
  Dr. Thorndyke saying that he has been detained at Maidstone, and has missed
  his train. I don't know when he will arrive here. He may be here in a few
  minutes, or he may arrive in an hour or two. It is for you to decide what is
  to be done. We have a great deal of evidence to consider. We do not seem to
  need any more medical evidence, and the question of Mr. Vardon's death is not
  of vital importance to this enquiry.</p>

  <p>"The question is shall we wait to hear Dr. Thorndyke's evidence or shall
  we proceed to consider the great mass of evidence that we already have? It is
  for you to decide, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>The jury conferred for a couple of minutes, and then the foreman announced
  their decision. "The jury say, sir, that we are enquiring into the death of
  Lewis Otway, not John Vardon. They would like to proceed with the
  consideration of the evidence without waiting for Dr. Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"I am entirely with you, gentlemen," said the coroner. "I think that the
  evidence that we have heard will prove amply sufficient to guide us to our
  verdict; and we can still revise our opinions if the expert witness should
  have something fresh to tell us."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-3-27"
     id="ch-3-27"></a>XXVII.&mdash; THE INDICTMENT</h2>

  <p class="first">DURING the short interval, in which the coroner took a final
  glance over his notes, there was a general stirring among the occupants and a
  suggestion of preparation for the next act. Jurymen re-settled themselves in
  their seats, reporters straightened their backs, and looked about them, the
  police officers and the spectators conversed in low undertones. At length the
  coroner laid on the table before him a single sheet of paper&mdash;probably
  an abstract of the evidence&mdash;sat back in his chair, and looked towards
  they jury; whereupon a deep silence fell upon the court, and he began his
  address:</p>

  <p>"It is hardly necessary to remind you, gentlemen, that we are assembled
  for the purpose of ascertaining how, when, and by what means Lewis Otway came
  by his death; but it may be necessary to remark that our enquiry is not
  entirely concerned with the immediate causes of that death but is
  also&mdash;and in fact, principally&mdash;concerned with the more remote
  contributory circumstances. For in this case, the 'How, when, and by what
  means' are simple enough. We have the testimony of an eye-witness who saw the
  deceased hanging dead, from a peg on the wall, under conditions strongly
  suggestive&mdash;in fact characteristic&mdash;of suicide; and we have the
  testimony of the deputy-police surgeon that all the appearances were those of
  suicide; and we have his expert opinion that the cause of death was
  undoubtedly suicidal hanging. Indeed, we may say that the immediate cause of
  death is self-evident, and that the whole of our enquiry is concerned with
  the remote cause. We are not asking 'Did this man commit suicide?' for the
  evidence of the first two witnesses settled that question. We are asking
  ourselves, Why did he commit suicide? The questions that we have to answer
  are, Was that suicide the spontaneous act of the deceased, for which he alone
  is responsible? Or was deceased driven to suicide by the deliberate,
  purposive, and malicious acts of some other person, or persons? And if the
  latter appears to be the case, Who is, or are, that person or persons, and
  what degree of criminal responsibility attaches to such acts?</p>

  <p>"Now we have at our disposal a considerable mass of rather miscellaneous
  evidence, and, I think the best way to deal with it will be to sketch out
  lightly the general course of events, and fill in the details later. The
  deceased, Lewis Otway, is the central figure of our picture, and the history
  that we have to trace, is his history. As to what we may call his past, that
  does not much concern us. Among the Ancient Egyptians the deceased was
  conceived as being brought before the tribunal of Osiris to answer for his
  conduct during his earthly life. We are not a tribunal of that kind. We are
  not trying Lewis Otway. If, as the police suspect, he had feathered his nest
  with a certain amount of illicit plumage, that is not our concern. Our
  interest in him is mainly confined to his connection with a particular series
  of events which began with his marriage and ended with his death. Let us now
  trace that succession of events, at first in outline, and then in more
  detail.</p>

  <p>"Lewis Otway first comes into our view on the occasion of his marriage. As
  presented in the evidence of his widow, Helen Otway, that marriage offers us
  the spectacle of an act of the most amazing folly. We see an elderly
  man&mdash;and an unattractive one at that, as you must have observed
  &mdash;marrying by compulsion, under threats, and greatly against her wishes,
  a young woman, of very unusual physical attractions, of great talent, and of
  exceptional mental gifts, and strength of character. You have seen this lady,
  and have heard her give her evidence, and you can confirm my description of
  her.</p>

  <p>"It was, I repeat, an act of amazing folly. For she must, in any case,
  have detested him. His conduct towards her was cruel and unscrupulous to the
  last degree, and in marrying her he could not fail to introduce a bitter
  enemy into his household. But there were added causes for that repugnance to
  him which she has freely admitted. In the first place, she believed that her
  consent had been secured by actual fraud. And in the second place, Otway's
  action was the undoubted cause&mdash;whether directly or indirectly, we need
  not enquire at this stage&mdash;of John Vardon's death. So that our history
  opens with the tableau of an elderly man who has married a young, beautiful,
  and clever wife, who loathes him, and has abundant reason for loathing
  him.</p>

  <p>"And now we pass on to the second scene&mdash;a scene almost more amazing
  than the first. Within an hour or two of the marriage ceremony, the young
  wife has repudiated the marriage, and demanded a separation for an indefinite
  period&mdash;practically a permanent separation. But it is not the demand
  that is so astonishing. The really astounding thing is that the husband seems
  to have agreed to this demand without demur. Consider the extraordinary
  inconsistency of his conduct. On the one hand we see this man, in his
  eagerness to possess this beautiful girl, trampling without scruple on her
  happiness, and her father's, oblivious of everything but his own desires; on
  the other, we see him meekly submitting to a demand which&mdash;natural as it
  may have been&mdash;the law would not have supported.</p>

  <p>"Whence this sudden compliance? Why did he consent? He need not have
  consented. The marriage was quite regular. No suit for nullity could have
  been sustained, whereas he could have sued at once for restitution. Why did
  he agree in this incomprehensible manner to surrender his unquestionable
  rights?</p>

  <p>"But this is not the only inconsistency. The conduct of the wife is even
  more inexplicable. When Otway gave evidence at the inquest on Mr. Vardon he
  omitted all reference to the loaded stick; which is not unnatural, seeing
  that it was a highly incriminating circumstance. But that suppression of a
  material fact made his evidence in effect, false evidence. For the truth is,
  according to the terms of the witnesses oath, the whole truth. Yet Helen
  Otway, when she gave evidence, confirmed this virtually false testimony; and
  she also suppressed&mdash;or, at least, omitted&mdash;the facts relating to
  the loaded stick. Her explanation is that, feeling convinced that her father
  died from a heart attack, she did not consider the stick incident of any
  importance. In estimating the credibility of that explanation you will bear
  in mind that the verdict was 'Death from natural causes,' but that the jury
  were not in possession of the facts. You will also bear in mind that this
  woman had seen her father lying dead, with a wound on his head, and this man,
  whom she loathed, and detested, standing over the body, grasping a formidable
  weapon. But whatever view you take of the explanation, the fact remains that
  at the inquest she not only refrained from accusing him, but she withheld a
  material fact which, if it had been disclosed, might have put Otway in the
  dock on a charge of murder.</p>

  <p>"Here, then, are two cases of incomprehensible inconsistency of conduct.
  But they are only incomprehensible so long as they are considered separately.
  Consider them together and a perfectly intelligible suggestion emerges. The
  husband had the power to compel his wife to live with him&mdash;and he did
  not exercise it. The wife had the power to expose the husband to a suspicion
  of having committed a capital crime&mdash;and she did not exercise it. The
  appearance is that of a surrender by each of the power to injure the other;
  in short, of a bargain or agreement, involving collusion to suppress
  evidence.</p>

  <p>"But this suggestion of collusion raises another question, which we shall
  consider later, but which we may note in passing. What was really the cause
  of Mr. Vardon's death? Did he die from natural causes as the coroner's jury
  believed and affirmed? Or was his death due to violence inflicted by Otway?
  It is by no means clear that Otway did not kill him, either inadvertently or
  with malice. And supposing Otway to have killed Mr. Vardon, was the fact
  known to Helen Otway? If it was, Otway's easy compliance is the more readily
  understood; for he would be absolutely in his wife's power. But we shall
  consider these points at more length presently, and perhaps we may get
  further light on them from the evidence of Dr. Thorndyke&mdash;if he should
  arrive before the verdict is agreed on.</p>

  <p>"The next phase of this drama opens about two months after the marriage.
  On the 21st of June, the deceased received an anonymous letter, the first of
  a series of seven, which were sent thereafter at fairly regular intervals of
  about a fortnight. Now, let us consider those letters from various points of
  view in relation to their probable authorship. You have heard them read, and
  know their general purport. They all contain veiled threats to make certain
  exposures. Some are vague and some are more explicit, but there is a general
  crescendo note, culminating in the last letter, which pretty openly makes an
  accusation of murder and threatens criminal proceedings.</p>

  <p>"First, what is the purpose of these letters? It is clearly not to levy
  blackmail. They hold out menaces, but there is no suggestion of an attempt to
  extort money. Those menaces are incomprehensible until we supply an
  explanatory fact. The man to whom these letters were sent suffered from a
  strong inherited predisposition to suicide. The very obvious inference to
  which we are forced, in the absence of any other explanation, is that the
  purpose of these letters was to convert that latent tendency into
  action&mdash;to produce a state of mind in which the deceased would be likely
  to take his own life.</p>

  <p>"But that purpose implies knowledge on the part of the writer that this
  inherited tendency existed, and consequently limits the possible authorship
  to persons possessing such knowledge. The only persons known by us to possess
  such knowledge are deceased's own family. His widow has sworn that she had no
  knowledge of this tendency, and if you believe her statement to be true, you
  will tend to exclude her from the possible authorship of these letters.</p>

  <p>"Next we have to consider the characters of the letters themselves. They
  all bear the East-London postmark, but there is not much in that. Anonymous
  letter-writers commonly post their letters in districts remote from their own
  residences. Still, we must take it into consideration. The two persons known
  to us who occupy premises in East London are Morris Goldstein and Helen
  Otway.</p>

  <p>"Then as to the style of the letters. They are rather markedly uneducated
  in manner. The composition is ungrammatical and the phraseology vulgar. But
  that does not help us much; for, on the one hand, none of the persons known
  to us is grossly uneducated, and on the other it is usual for anonymous
  letter-writers to disguise their personality. Obviously, it is easy enough
  for an educated person to write an apparently illiterate letter.</p>

  <p>"The next point is a much more important one. We have decided that the
  purpose of these letters was to produce in the deceased a state of mind which
  would render his suicide probable. Now, what was the motive behind that
  purpose? Who could have wished deceased to commit suicide, and why should
  that person have wished it?</p>

  <p>"The possible motives in this case are, in effect, the usual motives of
  murder, with full premeditation, viz revenge, or hatred; direct profit; and
  indirect profit by the elimination of an undesired person. Let us consider
  each of these motives in relation to the known facts of this case.</p>

  <p>"First as to hatred or revenge. The only persons known to us are the
  family of deceased and his wife. His family certainly had a grievance against
  him, for the children were illegitimate, and the mother was unmarried. But it
  was an old grievance, and the family appeared to be on quite amicable terms.
  The children were quite well provided for, and their mother continued to live
  with deceased. There was, indeed, a new factor of possible discord. The
  deceased had married, and that marriage was manifestly to the disadvantage of
  his family; a fact of which it is necessary to take due account.</p>

  <p>"When, however, we turn to the consideration of the wife, the facts are
  much more striking. She had suffered grievous injuries from deceased. He had
  ruined her life. He had virtually condemned her to perpetual spinsterhood,
  since she would not live with him and she could not marry anyone else. He had
  caused the death of her father; and she has admitted that she had an
  unconquerable repugnance to him. That is actually known to us; and there is a
  further possibility that he was actually her father's murderer, though we
  must leave that out of consideration in the absence of positive evidence. But
  on the evidence which is before us, you will see that the motive of personal
  animosity is much more evident in the case of the wife than in that of the
  family.</p>

  <p>"We now come to the motive of direct profit, and the question that we ask
  ourselves is, Who stood to benefit by the death of Lewis Otway? And as soon
  as we ask that question, a very striking fact comes into view. The first
  letter is dated by the postmark, the 21st of June. But on the 10th of that
  month&mdash;only eleven days previously&mdash;deceased had made a new will.
  By the provisions of that will Helen Otway stood to gain from eight to twelve
  thousand pounds by the death of her husband.</p>

  <p>"But did anyone else stand to gain by Lewis Otway's death? Observe that we
  are still dealing with the same group of persons&mdash;the only persons known
  to us in connection with the case. Well, the family of deceased stood to gain
  by his death, though to a much smaller extent; but the fact that must
  instantly impress us is the opposite effects of the new will on the family
  and the wife respectively. The execution of the new will involved the
  revocation of a previous will, which had left the bulk of the estate to the
  family. The position of affairs is consequently this: up to the 10th of June,
  the family, jointly, stood to benefit by Lewis Otway's death to the extent of
  the bulk of his estate and the wife did not stand to benefit at all; after
  the 10th of June the wife stood to benefit by Otway's death to the extent of
  the bulk of his estate, and the family to a relatively small extent.</p>

  <p>"But the first of the anonymous letters was sent almost immediately after
  the 10th of June. That is to say, it was sent almost immediately after the
  family had ceased to be and the wife had become the principal
  beneficiary.</p>

  <p>"From the motive of direct profit we turn to that of indirect profit, by
  the elimination of a person whose existence was a hindrance, a danger, or an
  inconvenience, Is there anyone known to us who could have regarded deceased
  in that light? We cannot attribute any such view to his family, for, as I
  have said, they appear to have been on quite amicable terms, and deceased
  seems to have maintained an interest in his children's welfare to the last.
  But what are we to say with regard to the wife? She was married against her
  wishes to a man unsuitable in age, uncomely in appearance; a man whom she
  loathed&mdash;and had good reason to loathe&mdash;who, while she repudiated
  him as a husband yet held her chained to him for life; who stood inexorably
  between her, and any marriage which she might wish to contract; whose
  existence condemned her for life to the dubious position of a married woman
  who is not living with her husband. Think, gentlemen, of this
  woman&mdash;young, handsome, clever, accomplished, capable; think of what
  life might have been to her, and what it was with this millstone hung round
  her neck! And then ask yourselves whether&mdash;apart from all pecuniary
  considerations&mdash;she did not stand to gain incalculably by his death;
  whether his elimination from her life would not have opened to her the gates
  of a world of happiness and freedom.</p>

  <p>"And it is here that the importance of that further evidence, which we
  unfortunately have not yet heard, appears. For if it should now transpire
  that Otway did actually kill John Vardon and that Helen Otway was privy to
  the homicide, then there would be yet another powerful reason why she should
  desire to be rid of him. But this evidence is not in our possession and we
  must, therefore, leave this aspect of the case out of our consideration. Nor
  is it essential. The facts within our knowledge are amply sufficient to
  enable us to answer the question whether Helen Otway's position would or
  would not have been improved by the death of her husband.</p>

  <p>"And now we come to something much more definite. Hitherto we have been
  dealing with the question: 'Who might have written these letters?' We shall
  now consider the more specific question, 'Who could have written them?'</p>

  <p>"There seems to be only one possible answer. The writer of those letters
  had knowledge that was possessed by only two persons&mdash;the deceased and
  his wife. One letter refers to something that was held back at the inquest.
  But who knew that anything had been held back at the inquest? No one,
  according to the evidence, but those two persons. Of course, it is possible
  that there may have been some watcher secreted in that house at Maidstone who
  knew that Lewis Otway had stood over the body of John Vardon with a loaded
  stick in his hand. But the evidence before us is to the effect that there was
  no one in the house but John Vardon, Lewis Otway, and Helen Otway.
  Consequently, unless Lewis Otway wrote these letters to himself, there is
  nobody, so far as we know, who could have written them but Helen Otway.</p>

  <p>"The last letter refers explicitly to the loaded stick, and even describes
  its condition minutely and, as it appears, correctly. The writer had,
  therefore, presumably seen the stick and very probably had possession of it.
  But where was that stick? Deceased certainly did not know where it was; the
  housekeeper states that she had never seen it since that fatal morning, and
  Helen Otway has denied all knowledge of its whereabouts. No one knew what had
  become of it.</p>

  <p>"But if its disappearance was a mystery, its reappearance is a greater
  mystery still. The account given by Helen Otway is obviously unsatisfactory.
  She went to the chambers, for no very apparent reason. When there she did not
  examine the various cupboards, drawers, and other receptacles; but she went
  direct to this particular cupboard, unlocked it, stood on tiptoe and looked
  on the shelf. And behold! there was the missing stick. She took it out,
  examined it, and put it back. And she not only put it back, but she went out
  of her way to inform a person who is to give evidence on this enquiry that
  the stick was to be found in that cupboard.</p>

  <p>"Now, how did that stick get into that cupboard, and when was it put
  there? You have heard Mr. Isaacs swear that it was not there when he made out
  the inventory, and you will probably agree that he could hardly be mistaken.
  A stick is a fairly large and conspicuous object, whereas he was searching
  for a small and inconspicuous one. Clearly the stick was put into the
  cupboard after his search was made. But when he had finished, the chambers
  were locked up, and the keys remained in his possession until he delivered
  them up to Helen Otway. Bearing these facts in mind, you have to consider
  whether you can accept Mrs. Otway's statement, or whether it is more probable
  that she took the stick to the chambers, and put it into the cupboard
  herself.</p>

  <p>"We now come to the incidents of that terrible night. What really happened
  in those chambers on that occasion will probably never be known. But the
  accounts that we have are full of sinister suggestions. We cannot, for
  instance, but note the fact that after this, the first and only visit from
  his wife, Lewis Otway made away with himself. Why he did the dreadful deed on
  this particular: occasion, and at this particular time, is not clear.
  According to his wife's account he was much calmer, and more cheerful after
  their talk, and she left him peacefully asleep. That is what she has told us.
  But what are the facts? Within an hour or two hours after she had left, his
  dead body was hanging from that peg. Nay! There is even a more dreadful
  possibility. The medical witness has told us that death took place about
  eleven, 'But it might have been an hour later or earlier.' So that it is
  physically possible&mdash;since Mrs. Otway left the chambers about
  ten&mdash;that the suicide may have actually taken place before she left. It
  is a horrible suggestion, and I should not have made it but for the fact that
  there are certain appearances which seem to support it.</p>

  <p>"You must have been struck by the singular circumstance that when Mrs.
  Otway took her departure she left the gas full on, and the bedroom door open.
  You have heard her explanation, but we are not concerned with that for the
  moment. The remarkable thing is that in the morning, the gas was still full
  on, and the bedroom door still open. Now how could that have been? If
  deceased was asleep when his wife left, then he must have arisen, made his
  preparations, and finally hanged himself, not only with the gas full
  on&mdash;which might easily have been the case&mdash;but with the door open,
  which is improbable in the extreme. Men do not usually commit suicide coram
  publico. Commonly suicides lock themselves in their rooms or otherwise seek
  security from interruption. Yet this man, whose bedroom opened directly into
  the living-room and whose housekeeper might still have been about, cuts down
  the bell-rope, arranges the chair and hangs himself, all in a
  brightly-lighted room with the door open. It is certainly against common
  probabilities.</p>

  <p>"But there are other suggestions of a similar tendency. If the
  fully-lighted gas and the open door suggest a hurried and agitated departure,
  so does the forgotten hand-bag containing the purse. And you will have noted
  that Mrs. Otway remembered that she had left her purse behind when she hailed
  a cab at the corner of Holywell Street. Now why did she not go back for it?
  She was quite near Lyon's Inn. She could have left the cab waiting, or
  brought it to the gate. She says she did not like to disturb Mrs. Gregg. But
  she has also said that she thought that Mrs. Gregg was still up and about.
  The explanation is not convincing, but on the other hand there is a strong
  suggestion of dislike to the idea of going back&mdash;a dislike which we can
  understand well enough if we believe that the tragedy had already been
  enacted, and that the body was even then hanging on the wall.</p>

  <p>"Then, too, the disappearance of the precious stones points in the same
  direction. They might have been taken when the deceased was asleep; but the
  theft would have been far easier if he was dead. But, of course, we cannot
  say with certainty that Helen Otway took the stones. We can only consider the
  evidence. That evidence, however, is almost overwhelmingly strong. It goes to
  show that the stones were in the deed-box within half-an-hour of Helen
  Otway's arrival. There is no reason to suppose they were then removed. It is
  practically certain that they were there when she arrived, and they were
  never seen there or anywhere else after she left. And there is a further
  corroborative circumstance. To ordinary persons unmounted precious stones
  illicitly obtained are difficult to dispose of. But this woman is not an
  ordinary person; she is a working goldsmith and jeweller who buys her own
  materials and sells the finished works to individual buyers. She could easily
  dispose of stolen gems in a manner that would render them untraceable.</p>

  <p>"The theft of these stones is not directly our business. It is that of the
  police. But indirectly it is of great importance. For it furnishes strong
  support to the suggestion that deceased was already dead when Helen Otway
  took her hurried departure. But what is the importance of that suggestion?
  The answer to that question will be found in the consideration of certain
  further facts and certain points of criminal law.</p>

  <p>"First, we must notice that if deceased committed suicide while Helen
  Otway was in the chambers, he must have done so with her consent and
  connivance. But was it only a matter of consent? Is there not a suggestion
  that some direct means may have been employed to induce or compel him to
  commit suicide? On this point we have very little information. But we have
  the evidence of Rachel Goldstein or Gregg that she overheard the conversation
  between Helen Otway and deceased on two separate occasions; and that on both
  occasions they seemed to be talking about suicide. There seems to be a strong
  suggestion that some active, direct, means were employed: persuasion,
  threats, or perhaps the mysterious agency of suggestion. We cannot say that
  it was so; but it would be in close agreement with the known circumstances
  and quite consistent with the course of action exhibited by the anonymous
  letters.</p>

  <p>"Supposing such active, direct means to have been employed, what degree of
  criminal responsibility would their employment entail? With regard to the
  letters, though the moral responsibility for their effect is beyond question,
  I should hesitate to give an opinion as to the exact legal position. But in
  the case of direct means there is no doubt at all. The law on the subject is
  quite clear. Let us consider it for a moment.</p>

  <p>"First as to the legal nature of suicide. In law, suicide is murder. It
  has been expressly laid down that a person cannot commit manslaughter on
  himself. But since suicide is necessarily murder, it follows that any person
  who is accessory to suicide is accessory to murder. If such person aids or
  abets any other person in so killing himself, that person is an accessory
  before the fact, or a principal in the second degree in the murder so
  committed; an accessory before the fact being defined as one who directly or
  indirectly counsels, procures, or commands any person to commit any felony or
  piracy which is committed in consequence of such counselling, procuring, or
  commandment.</p>

  <p>"Here, then, is the importance of the matter. The criminal responsibility
  attaching to the anonymous letters may be involved in some obscurity; but if
  it can be proved that any person counselled, procured, or commanded the
  deceased to kill himself, that person can be dealt with as a principal in the
  second degree in the murder of deceased. It is for you to say whether, in
  your judgment, such action can be proved in the case of any person, and if
  so, who that person is.</p>

  <p>"There is only one more item of evidence that I shall refer to, and that I
  shall touch upon only lightly. You have heard the witness Rachel Goldstein
  state that when she informed Helen Otway that deceased had hanged himself,
  Mrs. Otway fell down in a dead faint. You have heard the explanation that
  Mrs. Otway gave, and you must decide what weight you attach to it; whether
  you can regard this fainting as due to the shock of an unexpected tragedy, or
  as the culminating effect of prolonged and extreme nervous tension. In any
  case, its evidential value is but small.</p>

  <p>"And now, as our expert witness has still not arrived, let us take a last
  look over the evidence to see what material we have for our verdict." Here
  the coroner paused, a laying a number of sheets of paper in a row before him
  glanced rapidly through them.</p>

  <p>I watched him with a dreadful fascination, even as a bird might watch the
  stealthy approach of a snake, terrified, but despairing of any hope of
  escape. So I had listened to this terrible summing-up&mdash;all false and
  erroneous in detail, but so horribly true in regard to the central fact.
  Through that dense fog of error and false appearances the coroner had seen
  the essential truth; that Lewis Otway had gone to his death at my bidding.
  Like some great spider he had wound around me a network of horrid
  entanglements; and now he was about to wind up the final turns.</p>

  <p>At length he looked up, and laid his hand on one of the papers. Then he
  turned once more towards the jury and began his summary of the evidence. And
  at that moment, unnoticed, apparently, by anyone save myself, Dr. Thorndyke
  entered silently by a side door, and seated himself on a vacant chair.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-3-28"
     id="ch-3-28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; THE VERDICT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE arrival of Dr. Thorndyke seemed to me to close the last
  avenue of escape. The coroner had guessed at my guilty secret, but he only
  offered his guess as a speculative possibility on which no decisive opinion
  could be founded. But Dr. Thorndyke was not a guesser. If he had penetrated
  to that secret he would offer no speculative probabilities, but definite
  evidence, which would reduce the matter to certainty.</p>

  <p>It was a terrible thought. Self-accusation&mdash;the denunciations of a
  guilty conscience&mdash;had been dreadful enough. But there is a world of
  difference between self-accusation in secret and a public criminal
  indictment; between calling oneself a murderess, and standing in the dock to
  answer the charge.</p>

  <p>During the coroner's address I furtively watched Dr. Thorndyke. But I
  could gather nothing from his face. As he sat motionless, with his eyes
  steadily bent on the coroner, his expression denoted nothing but a grave and
  concentrated attention. After the first quick glance round the court, he
  never looked at me. What was in his mind I could not guess, though I felt
  that he held my fate in the hollow of his hand.</p>

  <p>"There is no need, gentlemen," the coroner began, "for us to go through
  the mass of evidence again. We have looked over it as a whole, and we have
  seen that certain striking suggestions emerge from it. In our last glance we
  have to bring those suggestions to a definite focus. Our inquiry deals with a
  man who committed suicide, but the appearances suggest that that suicide was
  not a voluntary, spontaneous act, but was the effect of a compelling force
  exerted by some other person.</p>

  <p>"Who was that other person? The compelling force seems to have been
  exerted by means of certain menacing letters. The person who procured the
  suicide of deceased was therefore the writer of those letters. Now who was
  the writer of those letters? The question is best answered by asking certain
  other questions.</p>

  <p>"First: Had deceased any enemies? Well, we know of one, and one only. His
  wife, Helen Otway, has confessed to a deep repugnance to him. She had
  suffered grievous injuries at his hands, and she resented those injuries
  profoundly.</p>

  <p>"Second: Who gained most by his death? Again, the answer is his wife,
  Helen Otway.</p>

  <p>"Third: Did anyone stand to gain in any other way by his death? The answer
  again is yes; and the person who stood to gain&mdash;by liberation from an
  intolerable bondage&mdash;was Helen Otway.</p>

  <p>"Fourth: Who could have written those letters? who possessed the secret
  knowledge that those letters exhibit? Only one such person is known to us
  besides deceased himself. That person is Helen Otway.</p>

  <p>"Fifth: Who was the last person who was with him before his death? Again
  the answer is, Helen Otway.</p>

  <p>"Sixth: Is there any evidence of the use of more direct means to procure
  or compel this act of suicide? And if so, by whom do those means appear to
  have been employed? The answer is that there is such evidence, and that the
  person who appears to have used those means is Helen Otway. There is evidence
  suggesting that she was actually present when the suicide took place; there
  is evidence of a hurried flight and unwillingness to return for the purse
  that she had left behind; there is the open door, the lighted gas, and the
  missing jewels, which were in the chambers when she arrived, and which were
  never seen after she left. And then there is the mysterious stick which had
  vanished, and which reappeared so strangely after her unexplained visit to
  the chambers.</p>

  <p>"That, gentlemen, is in brief the whole of the evidence with the exception
  of that relating to John Vardon's death. That evidence is important to this
  enquiry; for if it should be proved that John Vardon was killed by Lewis
  Otway, and that Helen Otway was privy to the homicide, that would furnish a
  further motive for procuring the suicide of deceased&mdash;the motive of the
  removal of the sole accomplice in a serious crime. But that evidence is not
  vitally important, and it is for you to decide whether you will still await
  the arrival of Dr. Thorndyke, or whether you will proceed to consider your
  verdict on the evidence that you have heard."</p>

  <p>As the coroner concluded, Dr. Thorndyke rose and advanced to the table,
  placing on an empty chair a small green-covered suit-case. The coroner looked
  up at him sharply and with somewhat definitely unfriendly recognition.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been here, sir?" the former demanded.</p>

  <p>"About seven minutes," Dr Thorndyke replied glancing at his watch. "You
  were just beginning your summary when I entered."</p>

  <p>"You should have announced your arrival immediately," said the coroner.
  "However, as you are here, you had better take the oath, and give your
  evidence without further delay."</p>

  <p>The coroner's brusque, and even rude manner, did not appear to disturb Dr.
  Thorndyke in the smallest degree. With the same impassive expression and
  quiet, composed demeanour, he took the oath and disposed of the usual
  preliminaries.</p>

  <p>"We understand," said the coroner, "that you have made an examination of
  the body of the late John Vardon."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I proceeded to Maidstone on instructions from the Home Office and
  conducted an exhumation of the body of John Vardon, of which I then made an
  examination. The object of the proceeding was to ascertain whether the cause
  of death had been correctly stated at the inquest."</p>

  <p>"And what was the result of your examination&mdash;I don't think we want
  minute details."</p>

  <p>"I found that the cause of death was, as stated at the inquest by the
  medical witnesses, failure of an extremely dilated heart. There was a small
  wound on the right side of the forehead adjoining the temple, which I
  examined very thoroughly. It was a glancing wound caused by a very oblique
  impact, and was such a wound as might have been produced in the manner
  described&mdash;by striking the corner of the mantelpiece in falling. There
  was no injury to the bone nor to the brain or its membranes. It was quite a
  trivial wound, and was not either wholly or partially the cause of
  death."</p>

  <p>"Could that wound have been caused by a blow with a loaded stick?"</p>

  <p>"I should say not. It was an oblique tear in the scalp and was apparently
  produced by some object more angular than the knob of a stick."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the coroner, "that seems to dispose of the question of Mr.
  Vardon's death. It is a thousand pities that it was not cleared up more
  completely at the time. However, it is cleared up now; and that, really, is
  all, I think, that we want you to tell us, unless you have some other
  information. I understand that you had a sort of roving commission to
  investigate the matter of this enquiry?"</p>

  <p>"I received instructions to make certain investigations with a view to my
  giving evidence at this inquest, and I have made such investigations as
  seemed to me to be necessary."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you have, in fact, held a sort of one-man inquest on your own
  account. Well, the question is, do you suppose that you are in a position to
  tell us anything that we do not know already?"</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure that I am. If you will allow me to present a summary of
  the facts in my possession&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall allow nothing of the kind. You will be good enough to answer
  questions like any other witness."</p>

  <p>Dr. Thorndyke bowed with the same immovable serenity, and the coroner
  proceeded with his examination.</p>

  <p>"Have you had much experience of cases of suicide?"</p>

  <p>"I have."</p>

  <p>"Have you had personal experience of any cases in which the suicidal act
  was procured, or brought about, by acts of persons other than the suicide,
  performed by them with deliberate intent?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have had experience of several such cases."</p>

  <p>"In those cases, what methods were used to procure the other person to
  commit suicide?"</p>

  <p>"The majority were cases in which two persons agreed mutually to commit
  suicide together. In the less common cases in which the procurer did not
  propose to commit suicide, the method employed was usually some form of
  suggestion."</p>

  <p>"Can you give us an instance of the employment of suggestion?"</p>

  <p>"A very typical case occurred in my practice some years ago. A young man,
  who had a strong inherited predisposition to suicide, was caused by certain
  persons, who stood to benefit very considerably by his death, to make away
  with himself. The method adopted was this: The victim was made to believe
  that a certain Chinese jewel in his possession carried a curse; that all
  previous owners of it had hanged themselves, and that the appointed time for
  the suicide was made known by the apparition of a dead mandarin. When by
  frequent repetitions of this story the suitable state of mind had been
  produced, one of theses persons dressed himself in a mandarin's costume and
  presented himself to the victim, with the result that, within an hour or two,
  the latter hanged himself."</p>

  <p>"In that case," observed the coroner, "the suggestion seems to have been
  in two stages. Is that usual?"</p>

  <p>"One could hardly call it usual, as the cases are so rare. But it is the
  most obvious and effective method&mdash;to produce a suicidal state of mind
  by preparatory suggestion, and then, as it were, to explode the mine by a
  definite determining suggestion."</p>

  <p>"Are you acquainted with the evidence which has been given in this
  inquiry?"</p>

  <p>"I have read a verbatim report of the first proceedings, and I have heard
  your summary of the whole case."</p>

  <p>"You have, then, read the evidence relating to the anonymous letters. What
  opinion did you form as to the purpose of those letters?"</p>

  <p>"I formed the opinion that their purpose was to impel deceased to commit
  suicide."</p>

  <p>"Do you consider that, in the case of a person predisposed to suicide,
  they would be likely to produce that effect?"</p>

  <p>"I should say that they would have a tendency to induce a suicidal state
  of mind."</p>

  <p>"And suppose such a person, having received a series of such letters, and
  being greatly depressed by them, should be engaged&mdash;in his bedroom, the
  last thing at night&mdash;in a conversation on suicide, his own suicide, and
  that of relatives who had killed themselves, what would you expect to be the
  effect of such conversation?"</p>

  <p>"It would not be possible to predict the effect, but the tendency would be
  to reinforce the influence of the letters."</p>

  <p>"And what would be the condition of such a person in regard to his
  susceptibility to further suggestion?</p>

  <p>"His susceptibility to further suggestion would probably be
  increased."</p>

  <p>"Looking at this case as a whole, by the light of your experience of
  suicide, do you regard the death of deceased as the result of his own
  spontaneous act or as due in part to the acts of some other person or
  persons?</p>

  <p>"I regard his death as due entirely to the acts of some other person or
  persons."</p>

  <p>At these terrible words my heart seemed to stand still. There was a
  fearful certainty and confidence in Dr. Thorndyke's tone that chilled my very
  blood. He did not guess. He knew. In the short pause that followed, I set my
  teeth and waited for my condemnation.</p>

  <p>"You consider that the suggestion conveyed in the letters and in that
  conversation and by other possible means operated so as to convert deceased
  into an automaton? Is that what you mean?"</p>

  <p>"No. I do not consider that the letters or the conversation had any effect
  in causing his death."</p>

  <p>The coroner frowned, perplexedly. "I don't think I quite understand," said
  he. "There seems to be&mdash;if you will pardon me&mdash;some
  self-contradiction. You state that the letters and the conversation would
  tend to produce a suicidal state of mind; but yet, though the letters were
  actually received and the conversation occurred, neither had any effect in
  causing the death which followed them. Do I state the case correctly?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; quite correctly."</p>

  <p>"Then I do not understand you in the least. You appear to be flatly
  contradicting yourself. I think you will agree that we are not making much
  progress."</p>

  <p>"We are not making any progress at all. The examination has not elicited a
  single, relevant fact."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, sir!" exclaimed the coroner. "And, pray, whose fault is that?</p>

  <p>"I suggest," Dr. Thorndyke replied, suavely, "that it is due to the method
  of examination."</p>

  <p>The coroner turned purple. "This is insufferable!" he exclaimed; "that a
  witness should presume to instruct an experienced officer of justice in the
  duties of his office! But I suppose we must be humble in the presence of an
  expert. May I ask, sir, what you object to in my methods of examination?"</p>

  <p>"The lack of result," Dr. Thorndyke replied, "is due to the fact that your
  examination has been conducted to support a particular theory; and that
  theory happens to be the wrong theory."</p>

  <p>"Again, I don't understand you," the coroner said, angrily. "No theory has
  been advanced by me. Will you be good enough to explain what theory you are
  alluding to?"</p>

  <p>"I allude to the theory, which you seem to have adopted, that the deceased
  Lewis Otway committed suicide by hanging himself from a peg on the bedroom
  wall. That theory is erroneous. It is practically certain that Lewis Otway
  did not commit suicide; and it is quite certain that he never hung from that
  peg on the bedroom wall."</p>

  <p>"But," exclaimed the coroner, "we have the evidence of a witness who saw
  deceased hanging from that peg; and not only saw him, but cut him down and
  found him to be dead."</p>

  <p>"As a witness," said Dr. Thorndyke, "I am not concerned with the testimony
  of other witnesses, but only with the facts as ascertained by me."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," retorted the coroner. "But we are concerned with the testimony
  of all the witnesses; and the statement of this witness that she saw the body
  hanging from the peg, and that she cut it down from the peg, is a clear
  statement on a question of fact. If that statement is true, deceased hung
  from that peg. If he did not hang from that peg the statement is false. You
  say that he never hung from that peg. On what facts do you base that
  statement?</p>

  <p>"On the strength of the peg and the weight of the body of deceased. The
  strength of the peg&mdash;that is, the maximum weight it was capable of
  supporting&mdash;was under 175 pounds. But the body of deceased weighed 231
  pounds&mdash;that is half a hundredweight in excess of the greatest weight
  that the peg was capable of supporting."</p>

  <p>"What method did you employ to measure the strength of the peg?"</p>

  <p>"I used simple weights, which I thought preferable to a dynamometer for
  purposes of evidence. These weights I had conveyed to the chambers, and I
  carried out the experiment in the presence of Mr. Anstey, K.C., and my
  assistant, Francis Polton. I hung from the peg a wooden tray, slung by a
  chain, the total weight of which was ten pounds. On this tray I
  placed&mdash;with great care to avoid shocks&mdash;two half-hundredweights. I
  then added weights, five pounds at a time, until the total weight, including
  that of the tray and chain, reached 170 pounds. This was evidently very near
  the limit of what the peg would bear, for it was bending noticeably under the
  weight; and when I added another five pounds the peg doubled under, breaking
  half-way through. I have brought it with me for your inspection." He opened
  the green suit-case and produced the peg, which he handed to the coroner.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, "that, in spite of its massive appearance, it had very
  little strength. It is merely a piece of thinnish, brass tube."</p>

  <p>The coroner was impressed, but puzzled. "You consider," said he, as he
  handed the peg to the foreman of the jury, "that the test is conclusive?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," replied Dr. Thorndyke. "Clearly, a peg which breaks under a
  weight of 175 pounds could not have supported a body weighing 231
  pounds."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed the coroner, "that appears to be undeniable." He again
  reflected for a few moments, and then said: "I notice that you went to the
  chambers provided with this apparatus. The suggestion is that you had already
  a definite suspicion in your mind. Is that the case?</p>

  <p>"Yes; I had already come to the conclusion that deceased had never hung
  from that peg."</p>

  <p>"Will you tell us what led you to that conclusion?"</p>

  <p>"When I received instructions to investigate the case I proceeded to make
  an inspection of the body, and it struck me, at once, that the appearances
  were not quite in agreement with the alleged facts, which I had learned from
  a verbatim report of the evidence. The amount of injury to the structures of
  the neck was much less than I should have expected in the case of so heavy a
  man, and the characteristic signs of death by hanging were absent. It is my
  invariable rule, in all cases of suspicious death, no matter what the
  apparent cause of the death may be, to examine the contents of the stomach
  and the secretions. In this case the procedure appeared to be necessary, and
  I made a careful examination of the contents of the stomach. The examination
  disclosed the presence of small quantities of veronal and alcohol, but when I
  tested for alkaloids, I obtained from the stomach and its contents no less
  than twenty-three minims of nicotine, the alkaloid of tobacco.</p>

  <p>"Now nicotine&mdash;which differs from all other alkaloids but conein, the
  alkaloid of hemlock, in being a liquid&mdash;is an intensely poisonous
  substance. The fatal dose has not been exactly ascertained, but it may be
  stated at not more: than five minims; that is, roughly, five drops. So that
  the quantity of this virulent poison actually obtained from the stomach of
  deceased was about four times the fatal dose. But this was only a part of the
  quantity that had been swallowed, for the examination was made ten days after
  death, by which time an appreciable amount of the poison would have been lost
  by post-mortem diffusion. I also examined the liver and other organs and the
  secretions, and in these I detected minute quantities of nicotine. The
  evidence afforded by these minute quantities is very important. Nicotine is a
  poison that acts with great rapidity&mdash;in fact, with the exception of
  hydrocyanic acid (prussic acid) it is probably the most rapidly-acting poison
  known. The importance, therefore, of these minute traces of the poison in
  remote organs is this: their existence proves that the poison entered the
  stomach during life&mdash;while the blood was still circulating; and the
  minuteness of the quantity absorbed proves that death occurred very
  rapidly&mdash;practically instantaneously.</p>

  <p>"But the very large quantity of the poison and the evidence of its almost
  instantaneous effect created this dilemma: a witness had stated that she saw
  deceased hanging from the peg; but since death was practically instantaneous,
  he could not have hanged himself after taking the poison; and obviously he
  could not have taken the poison after he had hanged himself. This
  discrepancy, coupled with the absence of appreciable injury to the neck,
  raised a doubt as to whether deceased had ever hung from the peg at all. That
  doubt was increased by certain other circumstances. There were, for instance,
  post-mortem lacerations of the hamstring muscles and other muscles of the
  thighs, which could not be accounted for in the case of a body which had hung
  vertically, fully extended. There were faint impressions below the knees of
  some coarse-textured fabric, not part of his clothing, and there was the
  condition of a length of red, worsted rope by which deceased was said to have
  been suspended. Both ends of this rope&mdash;which had formed part of a
  loop&mdash;had been cut through with a very sharp instrument; and both ends
  were cut cleanly right through. But this could not possibly have happened in
  the alleged circumstances. If a body of this great weight had been suspended
  by two thicknesses of a flimsy, woollen rope, and an attempt had been made to
  cut that rope, the cutting instrument would not have passed right through,
  but would have divided the rope until the remaining portion was too weak to
  sustain the weight, and then that portion would have broken, leaving a ragged
  end. Having regard to the great evidential importance of the question, I
  decided to clear up the doubt, if possible, by examining the peg itself.
  There are not many pegs which could carry this great weight without either
  bending, breaking or pulling out of the woodwork, and I thought it probable
  that an actual test with weights would settle the question. I accordingly
  obtained the keys from Mrs. Otway, went to the chambers and applied the tests
  as I have stated."</p>

  <p>"If the deceased was not suspended at all," the coroner objected, "how do
  you account for the marks of the rope on his neck?"</p>

  <p>"He was suspended&mdash;or rather partially suspended. I looked about the
  chambers for the probable means of suspension, and decided that this was the
  knob of the bedpost at the right-hand side of the head of the bed. On this
  side of the bed was a hard jute matting, the texture of which corresponded
  exactly with the impressions on the knees, the faintness of which is
  accounted for by the partial protection furnished by the pyjamas. The
  procedure seems to have been this: the rope was secured to the neck of
  deceased immediately after death, while he was lying on the bed. It was then
  hitched over the knob of the bedpost and the body drawn off the bed so that
  it was supported against the bedpost in a kneeling position. This would
  account for the shallowness of the marks on the neck, the impressions of the
  matting on the knees, and the post-mortem lacerations of the muscles. With
  regard to these latter, it is evident that the body was left suspended in an
  approximately kneeling position for a good many hours&mdash;probably for the
  purpose of producing as deep an indentation as possible on the neck&mdash;and
  that during that time cadaveric rigidity became well established; so that
  when the rope was cut and the body allowed to fall to the floor, the legs
  were found to have stiffened and to be firmly set in the kneeling posture. As
  deceased was to be represented as having hanged himself from the peg, it
  would be necessary to straighten out the legs by force; but as the muscles
  were already rigid, the forcible extension would tend to produce such
  lacerations as were found. These lacerations were, of course, under the skin
  and would not be noticeable excepting on close examination."</p>

  <p>"Is that the whole of your evidence?" the coroner asked, as Dr. Thorndyke
  paused.</p>

  <p>"It is the whole of my evidence concerning the immediate circumstances of
  the death of Lewis Otway. I have certain other information, but you will
  probably not consider it of much importance to the enquiry. I have examined
  the two hairs that were found adhering to Mr. Vardon's stick. They were not
  his hairs. As a matter of fact, the wound on his head was on a part in which
  there was no hair; but in any case, these were not his hairs. One of these
  was apparently a hair of Lewis Otway's&mdash;probably taken from his hair
  brush. His hair was white, but was dyed with a stain containing sulphide of
  lead. This hair was of a similar character and stained with the same
  material. The other was white and appeared to be a woman's hair. It was cut
  at both ends, and was evidently part of a much longer hair. I have also made
  some enquiries concerning the anonymous letters. Mrs. Otway consulted me
  about them a month or two back, and I promised her to look into the matter,
  and did so. I collected very few facts, but if I may look at the letters, I
  can tell you at once whether those facts throw any light on the authorship of
  these letters."</p>

  <p>"It really is not of much importance to us," said the coroner, "though it
  may be important evidence in another place. Still, you may as well look at
  the letters."</p>

  <p>He handed the bundle of letters to Dr. Thorndyke, who examined each of
  them closely, holding them up to the light to inspect the watermark and
  comparing them with some other letters which he produced from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I think," said he, as he returned the letters to the coroner, "there is
  no doubt that all these letters were written by Morris Goldstein. I have
  several letters which were received from and signed by him, which are
  identically similar in character. All are typed on the same foreign paper
  &mdash;made in Sweden&mdash;with an old Calligraph machine which had three
  type-bars slightly bent&mdash;the lower-case 'g' and 's' and the capital 'O.'
  I have further evidence on the subject, if you care to hear it."</p>

  <p>The foreman of the jury interposed at this point. "We don't want to hear
  any more about those letters. If deceased did not commit suicide, the letters
  don't matter."</p>

  <p>"They will matter a good deal in another court," said, the coroner, "but I
  agree with you that they do not affect our probable verdict; but there is one
  question to which we may as well have a definite answer, and then we need not
  detain Dr. Thorndyke any longer. You have told us, sir, that the immediate
  cause of Lewis Otway's death was nicotine poisoning. Can you say whether the
  poison was taken by deceased himself, or whether it was administered by some
  other person?"</p>

  <p>"The medical evidence proper furnishes no answer to that question, but
  from the attendant circumstances I infer that the poison was administered by
  some other person&mdash;probably while deceased was asleep. But that is only
  an opinion, based on the circumstantial evidence."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. It is really a question for the jury. And now I don't think we
  need trouble you any further." The coroner bowed, a little stiffly, and as
  Dr. Thorndyke walked back to his chair, he once more faced the jury.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen," said he, "you have heard Dr. Thorndyke's very
  remarkable evidence, and you will see that it compels us completely to revise
  our views of the case. The suicide by hanging, which we have been considering
  at such length, is seen to be an illusion, carefully, elaborately and
  ingeniously prepared. The question now is, was there a suicide at all? The
  cause of death was poisoning by nicotine, and death was almost instantaneous.
  Is this, then, a case of suicidal poisoning or of homicide?</p>

  <p>"It is unnecessary for me to dwell on the suggested probabilities. You
  have heard a witness swear, in the most circumstantial manner, that she saw
  deceased hanging from a peg, and that she cut the body down. You now know
  that deceased could never have hung from that peg. That statement was false.
  But what was the object of that false statement? Its object must be
  considered in conjunction with the illusory appearances produced by an
  elaborate set of preparations&mdash;the cord-marks on the neck, the
  overturned chair, the end of the rope fastened to the peg&mdash;a set of
  preparations, the only intelligible object of which seems to be the
  concealment of the real cause of death. And then there is a further series of
  preparations revealed by the anonymous letters. These we now have reason to
  believe were written and sent by Morris Goldstein. Our reason for connecting
  Mrs. Otway with those letters was based on Rachel Goldstein's statement that
  no one was in the house at Maidstone but Mrs. Otway, and her husband and
  father. But we can no longer accept that statement. The suggested probability
  is that she was in the house, and that she either saw, or heard enough to
  gather what had taken place. In that case we seem to detect a carefully-laid
  plan to procure the suicide of the deceased, and throw suspicion on his wife;
  and when the suicide failed to occur, the alternative of poison would seem to
  have been adopted.</p>

  <p>"I must draw your attention to the circumstances existing at the time of
  the tragedy. In deceased's chambers were precious stones to the value of over
  four thousand pounds. Possibly there were stolen gems of a somewhat greater
  aggregate value. It is highly probable that Rachel Goldstein knew of the
  deceased's letter to his wife, for as he was bed-ridden at the time, the
  letter would have been posted by her, and could easily have been opened and
  read. The time of the interview was arranged by her so that Mrs. Otway should
  be the last visitor.</p>

  <p>"Here then is a group of circumstances furnishing a perfect opportunity
  for the carrying out of the plan. The gems were within reach, and a visitor
  was expected on whom could be thrown the suspicion of the theft, and the
  responsibility of the apparent suicide.</p>

  <p>"As to the motive, apart from the theft of the gems, we must remember that
  here was an illegitimate Jewish family into which had been introduced a
  legitimate Gentile wife. Her arrival had affected the interests of the family
  injuriously, and if a reconciliation between husband and wife should have
  occurred, those interests would have been still more unfavourably
  affected.</p>

  <p>"But we are not called on to go deeply into the question of motive. This
  is a coroner's inquest, and our business is to decide how and by what means
  deceased met with his death. That decision is with you, gentlemen. You have
  heard the evidence, and I shall now leave you to consider your verdict."</p>

  <p>As the coroner ceased speaking, and silence fell upon the court I allowed
  myself, for the first time, to think of my own position. Previously I had not
  dared; for when Dr. Thorndyke had made his dramatic statement, the revulsion
  of feeling had been so great that I had much ado to restrain myself from
  bursting into hysterical tears or laughter. But now I was more calm, and
  could think upon the change that a few magic words had wrought in my
  condition. I was free&mdash;free in body and soul. My imagined guilt had been
  a delusion; the silent willing and suggestion, a myth. I had never had any
  conscious intention to procure Lewis Otway's suicide; and no suicide had been
  procured. The death of that wretched man&mdash;my evil genius&mdash;had been
  brought about by no act of mine, conscious or unconscious. I was guiltless, I
  was free.</p>

  <p>The jury took but a short time to consider their verdict. In a few minutes
  the foreman intimated that they had come to a unanimous decision. The coroner
  then formally put the question.</p>

  <p>"Have you considered the evidence, gentlemen, and are you agreed upon your
  verdict?"</p>

  <p>"We are," replied the foreman. "Our verdict is that the deceased, Lewis
  Otway, met his death as the result of a poisonous dose of nicotine
  administered to him by Rachel Goldstein."</p>

  <p>"Do you say that the poison was administered inadvertently or with
  malice?"</p>

  <p>The foreman consulted his colleagues, and then replied; "With malice."</p>

  <p>"That," said the coroner, "amounts to a verdict of wilful murder against
  Rachel Goldstein; and I may say, that I am entirely in agreement with
  you."</p>

  <p>As the coroner concluded, I looked at Mrs. Gregg. Her face was set, and
  had turned a horrible, livid grey. Presently she rose slowly from her chair,
  and looked furtively over her shoulder; and as she did so she looked into the
  face of Superintendent Miller.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-4"
     id="ch-4"></a>EPILOGUE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE history that I have set forth in the foregoing pages is
  the history of an episode. That episode opened with instantaneous abruptness;
  and in an instant it came to an abrupt end. The fatal words that I had
  overheard in my father's house had been as an incantation that had cast over
  me a malign spell. In the moment in which they were spoken the sinister
  shadow of Lewis Otway had fallen upon my life: and in the long months that
  followed it had never lifted. Even the death of the unhappy wizard had left
  the spell still working, the shadow deepening from hour to hour, until Dr.
  Thorndyke, like a benevolent magician, had spoken the counter-charm. Then, in
  an instant, the spell was broken; the shadow lifted and lifted for ever.</p>

  <p>And with the breaking of the spell and the lifting of the shadow, the
  episode is at an end, and my tale is told. Yet I am loth to lay down my pen
  until the reader who has followed my pilgrimage through the valley of the
  shadow has been given at least one glimpse of me straying in the sunshine,
  "along the meads of asphodel." I would crave his attendance at the sombre,
  old church of St. Clement Danes, where, on a bright May morning, was spoken
  another incantation that opened to four faithful hearts the gates of a
  Paradise of life-long happiness and love. I would bid him admire sweet Peggy,
  tripping forth, all smiles and blushes, beside her stalwart husband to
  foregather with Jasper and me and our friends from Wellclose Square and the
  Temple in the ancient rooms in Clifford's Inn.</p>

  <p>But my tale is told. The curtain is rung down; and I may not linger before
  it, babbling over the extinguished footlights on an empty
  stage&mdash;perchance to an empty house.</p>
