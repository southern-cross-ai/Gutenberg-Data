        style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">IN the dusk of the evening the waterman brought his skiff
  under the overhanging hull of the Baltic steamer and rested on his oars, the
  little boat rising and falling gently in the swell of the river. A grimy,
  unshaven second officer looked down from the open porthole and spat
  thoughtfully into the water. Apparently he did not see the swarthy-faced
  waterman with the tuft of grey beard, and as apparently the waterman was
  oblivious of his appearance. Presently the unshaven man with the faded gold
  band on the wrist of his shabby jacket drew in his head and shoulders and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later a square wooden case was heaved through the porthole
  and fell with a splash in the water. For a moment one sharp corner was in
  sight, then it sank slowly beneath the yellow flood. A small black buoy
  bobbed up, and the waterman watched it with interest. To the buoy was
  attached a stout cord, and the cord was fastened to the case. He waited,
  moving his oars slowly, until the buoy was on the point of being sucked out
  of sight; then, with a turn of his wrist, he hooked an oar under the
  cord&mdash;literally hooked, for at the end of the short blade was a little
  steel crook.</p>

  <p><a id="pic2a"
     name="pic2a"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1401111h-images/JR4-Crook-06.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Pushing the boat forward, he reached for the buoy and drew this into the
  stern sheets, fastened the cord round a wooden pin, and, lifting his oars,
  allowed the tide to carry him under the steamer's stern. Anchored in
  midstream was a dingy-looking barge and towards this he guided the skiff.</p>

  <p>A heavily-built young man came from the aft deck of the barge, and,
  reaching down a boathook, drew the skiff alongside. The swarthy man held on
  to the side of the barge, whilst the boathook was transferred to the taut
  line astern. The younger man did no more than fasten the soaking cord to a
  small bight. By this time the occupant of the skiff was on board.</p>

  <p>'Nobody about, Ligsey?' he asked gruffly.</p>

  <p>'Nobody, cap'n,' said the younger man.</p>

  <p>The captain said nothing more, but walked to the deck-house astern and
  disappeared down the companion-way, pulling the hatch close after him. There
  he stayed till the estuary was a black void punctured with dim ships'
  lights.</p>

  <p>Ligsey went forward to where his youthful assistant sat on an overturned
  bucket, softly playing a mouth-organ. He stopped being musical long enough to
  remark that the tide was turning.</p>

  <p>'We going up to-night?' he asked.</p>

  <p>Ligsey nodded. He had already heard the chuff-chuff of the motor in the
  stern of the barge, where the skipper was starting it.</p>

  <p>'What we hangin' around here for?' asked the youth curiously. 'We've
  missed one tide&mdash;we could have been up to Greenwich by now. Why don't
  Captain Attymar&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Mind your own business!' growled the mate.</p>

  <p>He heard the swarthy man calling him and went aft.</p>

  <p>'We'll get that case in and stow it.' he said in a low voice. 'I left a
  place in the bricks.'</p>

  <p>Together they pulled gingerly at the cord and brought the square, soaked
  packing-case to sight. Ligsey leaned over and gripped it with an instrument
  like a pair of huge ice-tongs, and the dripping case was brought to the
  narrow deck and stowed expeditiously in the well of the barge.</p>

  <p>The <i>Alloluna</i> invariably carried bricks between a little yard on the
  Essex coast and Tenny's Wharf. Everybody on the river knew her for an erratic
  and a dangerous-steering craft. The loud chuffing of her engine was an
  offence. Even nippy tug-boats gave her yawing bows a wide berth.</p>

  <p>The boy was called aft to take charge of the engine, and Ligsey took the
  tiller. It was five o'clock on a spring morning when she came to Tenny's
  Wharf, which is at Rotherhithe.</p>

  <p>As a wharfage it had few qualities attractive to the least fastidious of
  bargees. It consisted of a confined space with room for two builders' lorries
  to be backed side by side (though it required some manoeuvring to bring them
  into position), and the shabby little house where Joe Attymar lived. Through
  the weather-beaten gate, which opened at intervals to admit the builders'
  carts, was Shadwick Lane. It had none of the picturesque character of the
  slum it used to be, when its houses were of wood and water-butts stood in
  every back-yard. Nowadays it consists of four walls, two on either side of
  the street. Bridging each pair is an inverted 'V' of slate, called a roof,
  and at frequent intervals there are four red chimney-pots set on a small,
  square, brick tower. These denote roughly where lateral walls divide one
  hutch from another. Each partition is called a 'house,' for which people pay
  rent when they can afford it. The walls which face the street have three
  windows and a doorway to each division.</p>

  <p>Joe Attymar's house did not properly stand in the lane at all, and
  Shadwick Lane was only remotely interested in the barge-master, for the
  curious reason that he could reach his house and yard by Shadwick Passage, a
  tortuous alley that threaded a way between innumerable back-yards, and under
  the shadow of a high warehouse, to Tooley Street. Year after year the swarthy
  man with the little iron-grey beard and the shaggy eyebrows brought his barge
  up the river, always with a cargo of bricks. And invariably the barge went
  down empty and without his presence; for, for some reason, there was neither
  passenger nor skipper on the down-river trip.</p>

  <p>This fact was unknown to the people of Shadwick Lane. They were even
  unaware that Joe Attymar did not sleep in his house more than one night every
  month. They knew, of course, from the muddy old motor-car that he drove
  through the wide gates occasionally, that he went abroad, but guessed that he
  was engaged in the legitimate business of lighterman.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THERE are certain minor problems, which from time to time
  cause the chiefs of Scotland Yard to move uneasily and impatiently in their
  padded chairs and say to their immediate subordinates "Do something." Mr.
  Attymar, though he was blissfully unaware of the fact, was one of those minor
  problems.</p>

  <p>There are gaming houses which harass the police, strange little clubs and
  other establishments less easy to write about, but Mr Attymar was not
  associated with one of these. Such problems are, in one shape or another,
  perennial! Occasionally they grow acute and just at that moment the question
  of systematic smuggling was worrying Scotland Yard considerably.</p>

  <p>Chief Constable Mason sent for Inspector Gaylor.</p>

  <p>'They've pulled in a fellow who was peddling dope in Lisle Street last
  night,' he said, 'You might see him after his remand. I have an idea he'll
  squeak.'</p>

  <p>But the man in question was no squeaker, though he had certainly given
  that impression when he was taken red-handed. He said enough, however, to the
  patient detective to suggest that he might say more.</p>

  <p>'All that I could find out,' said Gaylor, 'is that this selling
  organization is nearly foolproof. The gang that we rushed last year isn't
  handling the output, but I'm satisfied that it still has the same
  governor.'</p>

  <p>'Get him,' said the Chief, who was in the habit of asking for miracles in
  the same tone as he asked for his afternoon tea. And then a thought struck
  him. 'Go along and see Reeder. The Public Prosecutor was telling me today
  that Reeder is available for any extra work. He may be able to help,
  anyway.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder heard the request, sighed and shook his head. 'I'm afraid it is
  rather&mdash;um&mdash;outside my line of business. Dope? There used to be a
  man named Moodle. It may not have been his name, but he had associations with
  these wretched people&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Moodle, whose name was Sam Oschkilinski, has been dead nearly a year,'
  said Gaylor.</p>

  <p>'Dear me!' said Mr. Reeder, in a hushed voice appropriate to one who has
  lost a dear friend. 'Of what did he die?'</p>

  <p>'Loss of breath,' said Gaylor vulgarly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder knew nothing more that he could recall about dope
  merchants.</p>

  <p>'Haven't you some record on your files?' suggested Gaylor.</p>

  <p>'I never keep files, except&mdash;um&mdash;nail files,' said Mr
  Reeder.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' suggested Gaylor, 'one of your peculiar friends&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I have no friends,' said Mr. Reeder</p>

  <p>But here he did not speak the exact truth.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder was an authority on poultry and his acquaintance with Johnny
  Southers began in a fowl-house. Johnny lived three doors from Mr. Reeder. He
  was rather a nice young man, fair-haired and good-looking. He had in Mr
  Reeder's eyes the overwhelming advantage of being a very poor
  conversationalist.</p>

  <p>Anna Welford lived in the house opposite, so that it may be said that the
  scene was set, for the curious tragedy of Joe Attymar, on a very small
  stage.</p>

  <p>It was through the unromantic question of a disease which attacked Johnny
  Southers' prize hens that Mr. Reeder met Anna. She happened to be in the
  Southers' back garden when Mr. Reeder was engaged in his diagnosis. She was a
  slim girl, rather dark, with amazing brown eyes.</p>

  <p>Johnny did not fall in love with her at first sight. He had known her
  since she was so high: when he was a boy she was endurable to him. As a young
  man he thought her views on life were sound. He discovered he was in love
  with her as he discovered he was taller than his father. It was a subject for
  surprise.</p>

  <p>It was brought home to him when Clive Desboyne called in his new car to
  take Anna to a dinner-dance. He resented Mr. Desboyne's easy assurance, the
  proprietorial way he handed Anna into the car. Thereafter Johnny found
  himself opening and examining packing-cases and casks and barrels at the
  Customs House with a sense of inferiority and the hopelessness of his
  future.</p>

  <p>In such a mood he consulted his authority on poultry, and Mr. Reeder
  listened with all the interest of one who was hearing a perfectly new and
  original story which had never been told before by or to any human being.</p>

  <p>'I know so very little&mdash;um&mdash;about love,' said Mr. Reeder
  awkwardly. 'In fact&mdash;er&mdash;nothing. I would like to advise you
  to&mdash;um&mdash;let matters take their course.'</p>

  <p>Very excellent, if vague, advice. But matters took the wrong course, as it
  happened.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"

        style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">ON the following Saturday night, as Mr. Reeder was returning
  home, he saw two men fighting in Brockley Road. He had what is called in
  Portuguese a <i>repugnancio</i> to fighting men. When the hour was midnight
  and the day was Saturday, there was a considerable weight of supposition in
  favour of the combat being between two gentlemen who were the worse for
  intoxicating drink, and it was invariably Mr. Reeder's practice to cross,
  like the Philistine, to the other side of the road.</p>

  <p>But the two young men who were engaged in such a short silent and bitter
  contest were obviously no hooligans of lower Deptford. Nevertheless, Mr
  Reeder hardly felt it was the occasion to act either as mediator or
  timekeeper.</p>

  <p>He would have passed them by, and did in fact come level with them, when
  one walked across the road, leaving his companion&mdash;though that hardly
  seems the term to apply to one who had been so bruised and exhausted that he
  was hanging on to the railings&mdash;to recover as best he could. It was then
  that Mr. Reeder saw that one of the contestants was John Southers. He was
  husky and apologetic.</p>

  <p><a id="pic3a"
     name="pic3a"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1401111h-images/JR4-Crook-04.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>'I'm terribly sorry to have made a fuss like this,' he said. 'I hope my
  father didn't hear me. This fellow is intolerable.'</p>

  <p>The intolerable man on the other side of the street was moving slowly
  towards where a car was parked by the pavement. They watched him in silence
  as he got in and, turning the car violently, went off towards the Lewisham
  High Road and, from the direction he took, central London.</p>

  <p>'I've been to a dance,' said the young man, a little inconsequently.</p>

  <p>'I hope,' said Mr. Reeder with the greatest gentleness, 'that you enjoyed
  yourself.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Southers did not seem disposed at the moment to offer a fuller
  explanation. As they neared Reeder's gate he said:</p>

  <p>'Thank God, Anna was inside before it started! He's been insulting to me
  all the evening. As a matter of fact, she asked me to call and take her home,
  otherwise I shouldn't have met him.'</p>

  <p>There had been a dance somewhere in the City, at a livery hail. Anna had
  gone with Clive Desboyne, but the circumstances under which Johnny called for
  her were only vaguely detailed. Nor did Mr. Reeder hear what was the
  immediate cause of the quarrel which had set two respectable young men at
  fisticuffs in the reputable suburban thoroughfare.</p>

  <p>To say that he was uninterested would not be true. The matter, however,
  was hardly pressing. He hoped that both parties to the little fracas might
  have forgotten the cause of their quarrel by the following morning.</p>

  <p>He did not see Johnny again for the remainder of the week. Mr. Reeder went
  about his business, and it is doubtful whether Johnny occupied as much as
  five minutes of his thoughts, until the case of Joe Attymar came into his
  purview.</p>

  <p>He was again called to Scotland Yard on a consultation. He found Gaylor
  and the Chief Constable together, and they were examining a very
  dingy-looking letter which had come to the Yard in the course of the day.</p>

  <p>'Sit down, Reeder,' said the chief. 'Do you know a man called
  Attymar?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder shook his head. He had never heard of Joe Attymar.</p>

  <p>'This is a thing we could do ourselves without any bother at all,'
  interrupted the Chief, 'but there are all sorts of complications which I
  won't bother you with. We believe there's a member of the staff of one of the
  Legations in this business, and naturally we want this fact to come out
  accidentally, and not as the result of any direct investigation by the
  police.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder then learned about Joe Attymar, the barge-master, of the little
  wharf at the end of Shadwick Lane, of the small house nearby, and the barge
  Allanuna that went up and down the Thames year in and year out and brought
  bricks. He did not hear at that moment, or subsequently, what part the
  Legation played, or which Legation it was, or if there was any Legation at
  all. In justice to his acumen it must be said that he doubted this part of
  the story from the first, and the theory at which he eventually arrived, and
  which was probably correct, was that the part he was called upon to play was
  to stampede Attymar and his associates into betrayal of their iniquity. For
  this was at a period when Mr. Reeder's name and appearance were known from
  one end of the river to the other, when there was hardly a bargee or tug-hand
  who could not have drawn, and did not draw, a passable caricature of that
  worthy man who had been instrumental in breaking up one of the best-organized
  gangs of river thieves that had ever amalgamated for an improper purpose.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder scratched his nose and his lips drooped dolefully. 'I was
  hoping&mdash;um&mdash;that I should not see that interesting stream for a
  very long time.'</p>

  <p>He sat down and listened patiently to a string of uninteresting facts. Joe
  Attymar brought bricks up the river&mdash;had been bringing them for many
  years&mdash;at a price slightly lower than his competitors. He carried for
  four builders, and apparently did a steady, if not too prosperous, trade. He
  was believed locally to be rolling in money, but that is a reputation which
  Shadwick Lane applied to any man or woman who was not forced at frequent
  intervals to make a call at the local pawn shop. He kept himself to himself,
  was unmarried, and had no apparent interests outside of his brick
  lighterage.</p>

  <p>'Fascinating,' murmured Mr. Reeder. 'It sounds almost like a novel,
  doesn't it?'</p>

  <p>After he had gone...</p>

  <p>'I don't see what's fascinating about it,' said Mason, who did not know Mr
  Reeder very well.</p>

  <p>'That's his idea of being funny,' said Gaylor.</p>

  <p>It was a week later, and the Allanuna lay at anchor off Queensborough,
  when a small boat towed by a local boatman, carrying a solitary passenger,
  came slowly out, under the watchful and suspicious eye of Ligsey, the mate.
  The boat rowed alongside the barge, and Ligsey had a view of a man with a
  square hat and lopsided glasses, who sat in the stern of the boat, an
  umbrella between his legs, apparently making a meal of the big handle! And,
  seeing him, Ligsey, who knew a great deal about the river and its scandals,
  started up from his seat with an exclamation.</p>

  <p>He was blinking stupidly at the occupant of the boat when Mr. Reeder came
  up to him.</p>

  <p>'Good morning,' said Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>Ligsey said nothing.</p>

  <p>'I suppose I should say "afternoon,"' continued the punctilious Mr.
  Reeder. 'Is the captain aboard?'</p>

  <p>Ligsey cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>'No, sir, he ain't.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose you wouldn't object if I came aboard?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder did not wait for the answer, but, with surprising agility, drew
  himself up on to the narrow deck of the barge. He looked round with mild
  interest. The hatches were off, and he had a good view of the cargo.</p>

  <p>'Bricks are very interesting things,' he said pleasantly. 'Without bricks
  we should have no houses; without straw we should have no bricks. It seems
  therefore a very intelligent act to pack bricks in straw, to remind them, as
  it were, of what they owe to this humble&mdash;um&mdash;vegetable.'</p>

  <p>Ligsey did not speak, but he swallowed.</p>

  <p>'What I want to know,' Mr. Reeder went on, and his eyes were never still,
  'is this. Would it be possible to hire this barge?'</p>

  <p>'You'll have to ask the captain about that,' said Ligsey huskily.</p>

  <p>His none too clean face was a shade paler. The stories of Reeder that had
  come down the river had gained in the telling. He was credited with
  supernatural powers of divination; his knowledge and perspicuity were
  unbounded. For the first time in years Ligsey found himself confronted with
  slowly-moving machinery of the law; it was a little terrifying and his
  emotions were not at all what he had anticipated. He used to tell Joe
  Attymar: '... If they ever come to me I'll give 'em a saucy answer.' And here
  'they' had come to him, but no saucy answer hovered on his lips. He felt
  totally inadequate.</p>

  <p>'When are you expecting the captain?' asked Mr. Reeder, in his blandest
  manner.</p>

  <p>'Tonight or tomorrow&mdash;I don't know,' stammered Ligsey. 'He'll pick us
  up, I suppose.'</p>

  <p>'Gone ashore for dispatches?' asked Mr. Reeder pleasantly. 'Or possibly to
  wire to the owners? No, no, it couldn't be that: he is the owner. How
  interesting! He'll be coming off in a few moments with sealed orders under
  his arm. Will you tell me'&mdash;he pointed to the hold&mdash;' why you leave
  that square aperture in the bricks? Is that one of the secrets of packing, or
  shall I say stowage?'</p>

  <p>Ligsey went whiter.</p>

  <p>'We always leave it like that,' he said, and did not recognize the sound
  of his own voice.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder would have descended to the cabin, but the hatch was padlocked.
  He did invite himself down to the little cubby hole, in the bow of the boat,
  where Ligsey and the boy slept; and, strangely enough, Mr. Reeder carried in
  his pocket, although it was broad daylight, a very powerful torch which
  revealed every corner of Ligsey's living place as it had never been revealed
  before.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>'Rather squalid, isn't it?' asked Mr. Reeder, 'A terrible thing to have to
  live in these circumstances and conditions. But of course one can live in a
  much worse place.'</p>

  <p>He made this little speech after his return to the fresh air of the deck,
  and he was fanning himself with the brim of his high-crowned hat.</p>

  <p>'One can live for example,' he went on, surveying the picturesque shore of
  Queensborough vacantly, 'in a nice clean prison. I know plenty of men who
  would rather live in prison than at&mdash;um&mdash;Buckingham
  Palace&mdash;though, of course, I have no knowledge that they've ever been
  invited to Buckingham Palace. But not respectable men, men with wives and
  families.'</p>

  <p>Ligsey's face was a blank.</p>

  <p>'With girls and mothers.'</p>

  <p>Ligsey winced.</p>

  <p>'They would prefer to remain outside. And, of course, they can remain
  outside if they're only sufficiently sensible to make a statement to the
  police.'</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket-book a card and handed it almost timorously to
  Ligsey.</p>

  <p>'I live there,' said Mr. Reeder, 'and I'll be glad to see you any time
  you're passing&mdash;are you interested in poultry?'</p>

  <p>Ligsey was interested in nothing.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder signalled to the boatman, who pulled the skiff alongside, and
  he stepped down into the boat and was rowed back to the shore.</p>

  <p>There was one who had seen him come and who watched him leave by train.
  When night fell, Joe Attymar rowed out to the barge and found a very
  perturbed lieutenant.</p>

  <p>'Old Reeder's been here,' blurted Ligsey, but Joe stopped him with a
  gesture.</p>

  <p>'Want to tell the world about it?' he snarled. 'Come aft.'</p>

  <p>The thickset young man followed his commander.</p>

  <p>'I know Reeder's been here: I've seen him. What did he want?'</p>

  <p>Briefly Ligsey told him quite a number of unimportant details about the
  visit. It was not remarkable that he did not make any reference to the card
  or to Mr. Reeder's invitation.</p>

  <p>'That's done it,' said Ligsey when he had finished. 'Old Reeder's got a
  nose like a hawk. Asked me why we left that hole in the bricks. I've never
  had to deal with a detective before&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You haven't, eh?' sneered the other. 'Who was that water man who came
  aboard off Gravesend the other night? And why did I drop half-hundredweight
  of good stuff overboard, eh? You fool! We've had half a dozen of these
  fellows on board, all of 'em cleverer than Reeder. Did he ask you to tell him
  anything?'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Ligsey instantly.</p>

  <p>Joe Attymar thought for a little time, and then: 'We'll get up the anchor.
  I'm not waiting for the Dutch boat,' he said.</p>

  <p>Ligsey's sigh of relief was audible at the other end of the barge.</p>

        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">THIS visit of Reeder was the culmination of a series of
  inquiries he had conducted in the course of a few days. He turned in a short
  report to Scotland Yard, and went home to Brockley Road, overtaking Johnny
  Southers as he turned from Lewisham High Road. Johnny was not alone.</p>

  <p>'Anna and I were discussing you,' he said, as they slackened their steps
  to match the more leisurely pace of Mr. Reeder. 'Is it possible for us to see
  you for five minutes?'</p>

  <p>It was possible. Mr. Reeder ushered them up to his big, old fashioned
  sitting-room, inwardly hoping that the consultation would have no reference
  to the mysterious workings of the young and human heart.</p>

  <p>They were going to get married.</p>

  <p>'Anna's father knows, and he's been awfully decent about it,' said Johnny,
  'and I'd like you to know too, Mr. Reeder.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder murmured something congratulatory. That matter of love and
  loving was at any rate shelved.</p>

  <p>'And Desboyne has been awfully decent&mdash;I told Anna all about that
  rather unpleasant little scene you witnessed&mdash;he never told her a word.
  He wrote apologizing to Anna, and wrote an apology to me. He has offered me a
  very good position in Singapore if I care to take it&mdash;he's terribly
  rich, and it sounds very good.'</p>

  <p>'It doesn't sound good to me.' Anna's voice was decisive. 'I appreciate
  Clive's generosity, but I don't think Johnny ought to give up his Civil
  Service work except for something better in England. I want you to persuade
  him, Mr. Reeder.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder looked from one to the other dismally. The idea of persuading
  anybody to do anything in which he himself was not greatly absorbed filled
  him with dismay. As a mentor to the young he recognized his limitations. He
  liked Johnny Southers as he liked any decent young fellow. He thought Anna
  Welford was extraordinarily pretty; but even these two facts in conjunction
  could not arouse him to enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>'I don't want much persuading,' said Johnny, to his relief. 'I've got
  something else up my sleeve&mdash;a pretty big thing. I'm not at liberty to
  talk about it; in fact, I've been asked not to. If that comes off, the
  Singapore job will be refused. It isn't so very difficult now. The point is
  this, Mr. Reeder: if you were offered a partnership in a thriving concern,
  that could be made into something very big if one put one's heart and soul
  into it, would you accept?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder looked at the ceiling and sighed. 'Hypotheses always worry me,
  Mr. Southers. Perhaps, when the moment comes, if you could tell me all about
  the business, I may be able to advise you, although I confess I have never
  been regarded as a man whose advice was worth two&mdash;um&mdash;hoots.'</p>

  <p>'That's what I wanted to see you about, Mr. Reeder.' Anna nodded slowly.
  'I'm so terribly afraid of Johnny leaving the service for an uncertainty, and
  I do want him to talk the matter over with you. I don't want to know his
  secrets'&mdash;there was the ghost of a smile in her eyes&mdash;' I think I
  know most of the important ones.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder looked round miserably. He felt himself caught and entangled in
  a network of dull domesticity. He was, if the truth be told, immensely bored
  and, had he been more temperamental, he might have screamed. He wished he had
  not overtaken these loitering lovers, or that they would apply to one of
  those periodicals which maintain a department devoted to advising the young
  and the sentimental in the choice of their careers. It was with the greatest
  happiness that he closed the door on their small mystery and devoted himself
  to the serious business of high tea.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder had many anxieties to occupy his mind in the next few days, and
  the fact that he had added Joe Attymar to his list of his enemies, even if he
  were aware of the fact, was not one of these.</p>

  <p>In the gaols of a dozen countries were men who actively disliked him.
  Meister of Hamburg, who used to sell United States bills by the
  hundredweight, Lefere, the clever wholesale engraver of lire notes, Monsatta,
  who specialized in English flyers, Madame Pensa of Pisa, who for many years
  was the chief distributor of forged money in Eastern and Southern Europe, Al
  Selinski, the paper maker, Don Leishmer, who printed French milles by the
  thousand, they all knew Mr. Reeder, at least by name, and none of them had a
  good word for him, except Monsatta, who was large-minded and could detach
  himself from his personal misfortunes.</p>

  <p>Letters came to Mr. Reeder from many peculiar sources. It was a curious
  fact that a very large number of Mr. Reeder's correspondents were women. A
  sensible number of the letters which came to him were of a most embarrassing
  character.</p>

  <p>His name had been mentioned in many cases that had been heard at the Old
  Bailey. He himself had, from time to time, stood up in the witness stand, a
  lugubrious and unhappy figure, and had given evidence in his hesitant and
  deferential way against all manner of wrong-doers, but mostly forgers.</p>

  <p>He was variously described as 'an expert,' as 'a private detective,' as 'a
  bank official.' In a sense he was all these, yet none of them entirely.
  Judges and certain barristers knew that he was at the call of the Public
  Prosecutor's Department. It was said that privately he enjoyed a status
  equivalent in rank to a superintendent of police. He certainly had a handsome
  retaining fee from the Bankers' Association, and probably drew pay from the
  Government, but nobody knew his business. He banked at Torquay and the
  manager of the bank was his personal friend.</p>

  <p>But the net result of his fugitive appearances in court was that quite
  intelligent women were seized with the idea that he was the man who should be
  employed to watch their husbands and to procure the evidence necessary for
  their divorces. Business men wrote to him asking him to investigate the
  private lives of their partners; quite a few commissions were offered by
  important commercial concerns, but none of these appealed to Mr. Reeder, and
  with his own hand he would write long and carefully punctuated letters
  explaining that he was not a private detective in the real sense of the
  word.</p>

  <p>He was not surprised, therefore when, some four days after his talk with
  Johnny Southers, he received a letter addressed from a Park Lane flat,
  requesting his services. He turned first to the signature and with some
  difficulty deciphered it as 'Clive Desboyne.' For a moment the name, while it
  bad a certain familiarity, was difficult to attach, and then he remembered
  the quarrel he had witnessed, and realized that this was the other party to
  that unhappy conflict.</p>

  <p>The letter was typewritten and ran:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">'Dear Sir, I happen to know your private address
  because Miss Welford pointed it out to me one evening when I was visiting
  her. I am in rather a delicate position, and I am wondering whether I could
  employ your services professionally to extricate myself? Since the matter
  affects Southers, whom I think you know (I have learned since that you were a
  witness of a certain disgraceful episode, for which I was probably more to
  blame than he), I thought you might be willing to see me. I want you to
  undertake this task on a professional basis and charge me your usual fees. I
  shall be away until Friday night, but there is no immediate urgency. If I
  could call some time after ten on Friday I should be eternally grateful.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Yours, etc.'</p><br>

  <p>Mr. Reeder's first inclination was to take out a sheet of paper and write
  a firm but polite refusal to see Mr. Desboyne, how ever stringent might be
  his predicament. He had written the first three words when one of those
  curious impulses which came to him at times, and which so often urged him to
  the right course, stayed his hand. Instead he sent a laconic telegram
  agreeing to the young man's suggestion.</p>

  <p>The day of the appointment was a busy one for Mr. Reeder. Scotland Yard
  had made two important discoveries&mdash;a small garage in the north of
  London, which contained nearly 400 lbs. of marijuana, had been raided in the
  early hours of the morning, and this was followed up by a second raid in a
  West End mansion flat, where large quantities of heroin and cocaine were
  unearthed by the police.</p>

  <p>'It looks as though we've found one of the principal distributing agents,'
  said Gaylor. 'We've got the barge under observation, and we're taking the
  chance of arresting Attymar as soon as he steps on board.'</p>

  <p>'Where is it?'</p>

  <p>'Off Greenwich,' said Gaylor.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder dived down into his pocket and produced an envelope. The paper
  was grimy, the address was a scrawl. He took from this as dingy a letter and
  laid it on the table before Gaylor.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'Dear Sir, I can give you informacion. I will call at your
  howse on Sunnday morning. From a Friend.'</p><br>

  <p>Gaylor inspected the envelope. The date-stamp was 'Greenwich.'</p>

  <p>'He had some doubt about sending it at all: the flap has been opened and
  closed again&mdash;I presume this is Ligsey; his real name is William Liggs.
  He's had no convictions, but he hasn't been above suspicion. You'll see
  him?'</p>

  <p>'If he comes,' said Mr. Reeder. 'So many of these gentlemen who undertake
  to supply information think better of it at the last moment.'</p>

  <p>It may be too late,' said Gaylor.</p>

  <p>It was at the end of a very heavy and tiring day that Mr. Reeder went back
  to his house, forgetting the appointment he had so rashly made. He had hardly
  got into the house before the bell rang, and it was then that he realized,
  with bitter regret, that he had robbed himself of an hour's sleep which was
  badly needed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Desboyne explained that he had driven down from his club, where he had
  bathed and changed after his long journey from the West of England.</p>

  <p>'I feel very ashamed to bother you at this hour of the night, Mr. Reeder,'
  he said with an apologetic smile, 'but I feel rather like the villain of the
  piece, and my vanity has made me put matters right.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder looked round helplessly for a chair, found one and pointed to
  it, and Desboyne drew it up to the table where the detective was sitting.</p>

  <p>He was a man of thirty-three or thirty-five, good-looking, with a very
  pleasant, open face and a pair of grey eyes that twinkled
  good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>'You saw the fight?... Lord! that fellow could punch! I thoroughly
  deserved what I got, which certainly wasn't very much. I was very rude to
  him. But then, like a fool, I went to the other extreme, and I've got him a
  job in Singapore&mdash;of course he'll take it&mdash;and I'm most anxious to
  get out of my offer.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder looked at him in surprise, and the young man laughed
  ruefully.</p>

  <p>'I suppose you think that's odd? Well, I'm rather impetuous and I've got
  myself into a bit of a hole. And it's a bigger hole than I knew, because I'm
  terribly fond of Anna Welford, and she's terribly unfond of me! Southers is
  rather in the position of a successful rival, so that everything I say or do
  must be suspect. That's the awful thing about it!'</p>

  <p>'Why do you wish to cancel the appointment?' asked Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>He could have added that, so far as he could recall, the appointment had
  already been cancelled.</p>

  <p>Clive Desboyne hesitated.</p>

  <p>'Well, it's a difficult story to tell.'</p>

  <p>He rose from his seat and paced up and down the room, his hands thrust
  into his pockets, a frown on his face.</p>

  <p>'Do you remember the night of the fight? I don't suppose that's graven on
  your memory. It arose out of something I said to our friend as we left the
  City hall. Apparently&mdash;I only discovered this afterwards&mdash;there was
  a man out there waiting to see Southers, but in the excitement of our little
  fracas&mdash;which began in the City, by the way&mdash;Southers didn't see
  the man, who either followed him to Lewisham or came on ahead of him. He must
  have been present in the street when the fight took place. When I got home
  that night the hall-porter asked me if I would see a very seedy-looking
  individual and, as I wasn't in the mood to see anybody, I refused. A few days
  later I was stopped in Piccadilly by a man who I thought was a beggar&mdash;a
  healthy-looking beggar, but most beggars are that way. He started by telling
  me he'd seen the fight, and said he could tell me something about Southers. I
  wasn't feeling as savage then as I had been, and I'd have hoofed him off, but
  he was so insistent, and in the end I told him to call at my flat. He came
  that night and told me the most extraordinary story. He said his name
  was'&mdash;Clive Desboyne frowned&mdash;' the name's slipped me for the
  moment, but it will come back. He was a mate or assistant on a barge run by a
  man named Attymar&mdash;'</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>'Ligsey?' suggested Mr. Reeder, and the other nodded.</p>

  <p>'That's the name&mdash;Ligsey. I'm cutting the story short be cause it
  took a tremendous long time to tell, and I don't want it to bore you as it
  bored me. They've been running some kind of contraband up the river on the
  barge, for apparently Attymar is a smuggler on a large scale. That was a yarn
  I didn't believe at first, though, from the things he told me, it seemed very
  likely that he spoke the truth. Certain articles were smuggled up the river
  on the barge, and others were passed through the Customs by Southers.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder opened his mouth very wide.</p>

  <p>'Now I'll tell you the truth.' Clive Desboyne's voice was very earnest. 'I
  wanted to believe that story. In my heart of hearts I dislike John
  Southers&mdash;I'd be inhuman if I didn't. At the same time I wanted to play
  the game. I told this fellow he was a liar but he swore it was true. He
  thinks the police are going to arrest Attymar, and when they do, Attymar will
  spill the beans, to use his own expression. In the meantime I have
  recommended Southers to a very important and responsible job in Singapore,
  and naturally, if this story comes out, I'm going to look pretty foolish. I
  don't mind that,' he added quietly, 'but I do mind Anna Welford marrying this
  man.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder plucked at his lower lip. 'Do you know Attymar?'</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head.</p>

  <p>'I can't even say that I know Ligsey, but if he keeps his promise I shall
  know Attymar tomorrow morning.'</p>

  <p>'What was his promise?' asked Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>'He says Attymar has documentary proof&mdash;he didn't use that expression
  but that is what he meant&mdash;and that he was going to Attymar's house
  tonight to get it.'</p>

  <p>Again Mr. Reeder thought, staring into vacancy.</p>

  <p>'When did you see him last?'</p>

  <p>'The morning I wrote to you, or rather the morning you received the
  letter.' He made a little gesture of despair. 'Whatever happens, Anna's going
  to think I'm the most awful&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The telephone bell rang sharply. Mr. Reeder, with a murmured apology,
  picked up the receiver and listened with a face that did not move. He only
  asked 'What time?' and, after a long pause, said 'Yes.' As he was replacing
  the receiver, Desboyne went on:</p>

  <p>'What I should like to do is to see Attymar&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder shook his head. 'I'm afraid you won't see Attymar. He was
  murdered between nine and ten tonight.'</p>

        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">IT was half past twelve when Mr. Reeder's taxi brought him
  into Shadwick Lane, which was alive with people. A police cordon was drawn
  across the gate, but Gaylor, who was waiting for him, conducted him into the
  yard.</p>

  <p>'We're dragging the river for the body,' he explained.</p>

  <p>'Where was it committed?' asked Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>'Come inside,' said the other grimly, 'and then you will ask no
  questions.'</p>

  <p>It was not a pleasant sight that met Mr. Reeder's eyes, though he was a
  man not easily sickened. The little sitting-room was a confusion of smashed
  furniture, the walls splashed with red. A corner table, however, had been
  left untouched. Here were two glasses of whisky, one full, the other half
  empty. A hall-smoked cigar was carefully laid on a piece of paper by the side
  of these.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6a"
     name="pic6a"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  </div><br>

  <p>'The murder was committed here and the body was dragged to the edge of the
  wharf and thrown into the water,' said Gaylor. 'There's plenty of evidence of
  that.</p>

  <p>'We've taken possession of a lot of papers, and we found a letter on the
  mantelpiece from a man named Southers&mdash;John Southers. No address, but
  evidently from the handwriting a person of some education. At nine
  twenty-five tonight Attymar had a visitor, a young man who was admitted
  through the wicket gate, and who was seen to leave at twenty five minutes to
  ten, about ten minutes after he arrived.'</p>

  <p>Gaylor opened an attaché case and took out a battered, cheap silver watch;
  which had evidently been under somebody's heel. The glass was smashed, the
  case was bent out of shape. The hands stood at nine-thirty.</p>

  <p>'One of the people here recognized this as Ligsey's&mdash;a woman who
  lives in the street who had pawned it for him on one occasion. It's
  important, because it probably gives us the hour of the murder, if you allow
  the watch to be a little fast or slow. It's hardly likely to be accurate.
  We've sent a description round of Southers; although it isn't a very good
  one, it'll probably be sufficient. I'm having a facsimile of the
  writing&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I can save you the trouble; here is the young man's address.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder took a notebook from his pocket, scribbled a few lines and
  handed it to the detective. He looked glumly at the bloodstained room and the
  evidence of tragedy, followed the detective in silence, while Gaylor, with
  the aid of a powerful light, showed the telltale stains leading from the
  wharf, and...</p>

  <p>'Very interesting,' said Mr. Reeder. 'When you recover the bodies I should
  like to see them.'</p>

  <p>He stared out over the river, which was covered by a faint mist&mdash;not
  sufficient to impede navigation, but enough to shroud and make indistinct
  objects thirty or forty yards away.</p>

  <p>'The barge is at Greenwich, I think,' he said, after a long silence.
  'Could I borrow a police launch?'</p>

  <p>One of the launches was brought in to the crazy wharf and Mr. Reeder
  lowered himself gingerly, never losing grip of the umbrella which no man had
  seen unfurled. It was a chilly night, an easterly wind blowing up the river,
  but he sat in the bow of the launch motionless, sphinxlike, staring ahead as
  the boat streaked eastwards towards Greenwich.</p>

  <p>It drew up by the side of the barge, which was moored close to the Surrey
  shore, and a quavering voice hailed them.</p>

  <p>'That you, Ligsey?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder pulled himself on board before he replied. 'No, my boy,' he
  said gently, 'it is not Ligsey. Were you expecting him?'</p>

  <p>The youth held up his lantern, surveyed Mr. Reeder and visibly
  quailed.</p>

  <p>'You're a copper, ain't yer?' he asked tremulously. 'Have you pinched
  Ligsey?'</p>

  <p>'I have not pinched Ligsey,' said Mr. Reeder, patting the boy gently on
  the back. 'How long has he been gone?'</p>

  <p>'He went about eight, soon after it was dark; the guv'nor come down for
  him.'</p>

  <p>'The guv'nor come down for him,' repeated Mr. Reeder in a murmur. 'Did you
  see the governor?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir; he shouted for me to go below. Ligsey always makes me go below
  when him and the guv'nor have a talk.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder drew from his pocket a yellow carton of cigarettes and lit one
  before he pursued his inquiries.</p>

  <p>'Then what happened?'</p>

  <p>'Ligsey come down and packed his ditty box, and told me I was to hang on
  all night, but that I could go to sleep. I was frightened about being left
  alone on the barge&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder was already making his way down the companion to Ligsey's
  quarters. Evidently all the man's kit had been removed; even the sheets on
  his bed must have been folded and taken away, for the bunk was tumbled.</p>

  <p>On a little swing table, which was a four-foot plank suspended from the
  deck above, was a letter. It was not fastened, and Mr. Reeder made no secret
  in opening and reading its contents. It was in the handprint which, he had
  been informed, was the only kind of writing Attymar knew.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">'Dear Mr. Southers, If you come aboard the stuff is in the
  engine-room. I have got to be very careful because the police are
  watching.'</p><br>

  <p>When he questioned the boy, whose name was Hobbs, he learned that Ligsey
  had come down and left the letter. Mr. Reeder went aft and found the hatchway
  over the little engine-room unfastened, and descended into the
  strong-smelling depths where the engine was housed. It was here, evidently,
  that Attymar remained during his short voyages. There was a signal bell above
  his head, and a comfortable armchair had been fixed within reach of the
  levers.</p>

  <p>His search here was a short one. Inside an open locker he found a small,
  square package, wrapped in oiled paper, and a glance at the label told him
  its contents, even though he did not read Dutch.</p>

  <p>Returning to the boy, he questioned him closely. It was no unusual thing
  for Attymar to pick up his mate from the barge. The boy had once seen the
  launch, and described it as a very small tender. He knew nothing of Mr
  Southers, had never seen him on board the ship, though occasionally people
  did come, on which occasions he was sent below.</p>

  <p>At his request, Mr. Reeder was put ashore at Greenwich and got on the
  telephone to Gaylor. It was now two o'clock in the morning, and much had
  happened.</p>

  <p>'We arrested that man Southers; found his trousers covered with blood. He
  admits he was at Attymar's house tonight, and tells a cock-and-bull story of
  what he did subsequently. He didn't get home till nearly twelve.'</p>

  <p>'Extraordinary,' said Mr. Reeder, and the mildness of the comment
  evidently irritated Inspector Gaylor.</p>

  <p>'That's one way of putting it, but I think we've made a pretty good
  capture,' he said. 'We've got enough evidence to hang him. Attymar's left all
  sorts of notes on his invoices.'</p>

  <p>'Amazing,' said Mr. Reeder, and gathered from the abruptness with which he
  was cut off that, for some mysterious reason, he had annoyed the man at
  Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>He sent back a short report with the documents and the drugs to Scotland
  Yard, and drove home by taxi. It was three o'clock by the time he reached
  Brockley Road, and he was not surprised to find his housekeeper up and to
  hear that Anna Welford was waiting for him.</p>

  <p>She was very white and her manner was calm.</p>

  <p>'You've heard about Johnny being arrested&mdash;' she began. Mr. Reeder
  nodded.</p>

  <p>'Yes, I gave them the necessary information as to where he was to be
  found,' he said, and he saw the colour come and go in her face.</p>

  <p>'I&mdash;I suppose you&mdash;you had to do your duty?' she said haltingly.
  'But you know it's not true, Mr. Reeder. You know Johnny... he couldn't...'
  Her voice choked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder shook his head.</p>

  <p>'I don't know Johnny really,' he said apologetically. 'He
  is&mdash;um&mdash;the merest acquaintance, Miss Welford. I am not saying that
  in disparagement of him, because quite a number of people who aren't my
  friends are respectable citizens. Did you see him before he was
  arrested?'</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>'Immediately before?'</p>

  <p>'Half an hour before. He was terribly disappointed; he had gone to see
  about this partnership but he had a feeling that he'd been tricked, for
  nothing came of it. He'd arranged to see me, and I waited up for him... he
  was crossing the road to his own house when he was arrested.'</p>

  <p>'Did he wear a blue suit or a grey suit?'</p>

  <p>'A blue suit,' she said quickly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder looked at the ceiling.</p>

  <p>'Of course he wore a blue suit; otherwise&mdash;um...' He scratched his
  chin irritably. 'It was a cold night, too. I can't understand until I have
  seen his&mdash;um&mdash;trousers.'</p>

  <p>She looked at him in bewilderment, a little fearfully. And then suddenly
  Mr. Reeder gave one of his rare smiles and dropped a gentle hand on her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>'I shouldn't be too worried if I were you,' he said with a kindly look in
  his eyes. 'You've quite a number of good friends, and you will find Mr
  Desboyne will do a lot to help your Johnny.'</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>'Clive doesn't like Johnny,' she said.</p>

  <p>'That I can well believe,' said Mr. Reeder good-humouredly. 'Nevertheless,
  unless I'm a bad prophet, you will find Mr. Desboyne the one person who can
  clear up this&mdash;um&mdash;unpleasantness.'</p>

  <p>'But who was the man who was killed? It's all so terribly unreal to me.
  Attymar was his name, wasn't it? Johnny didn't know anybody named Attymar. At
  least, he didn't tell me so. I'm absolutely stunned by this news, Mr. Reeder.
  I can't realize its gravity. It seems just a stupid joke that somebody's
  played on us. Johnny couldn't do harm to any man.'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure he couldn't,' said Mr. Reeder soothingly, but that meant
  nothing.</p>

        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">MR REEDER's housekeeper had, since his arrival, behaved with
  a certain secretiveness which could only mean that she had something
  important to communicate. It was after he had seen the girl to her house that
  he learned what the mystery was all about.</p>

  <p>'The young gentleman who came to see you last night,' she said in a low
  voice. 'I've put him in the waiting-room.'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Desboyne?'</p>

  <p>'That's the name,' she nodded. 'He said he wouldn't go until he'd seen
  you.'</p>

  <p>In a few seconds Clive Desboyne was shown in.</p>

  <p>'I've only just heard about Southers' arrest&mdash;it's monstrous! And the
  things I said about him tonight. Mr. Reeder, I'll spend all the money you
  want to get this young man out of his trouble. My God, it's awful for
  Anna!'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder pulled at his long nose and said he thought it was rather
  unpleasant. 'And,' he added, 'for everybody.'</p>

  <p>'They say this man Ligsey is dead too. If I'd had any sense I'd have
  brought over the note I had of our conversation.'</p>

  <p>'I could call for it in the morning,' said Mr. Reeder, and his voice was
  surprisingly brisk.</p>

  <p>Mr. Desboyne gazed at him in startled astonishment. It was as though this
  weary man with the drooping lips and tired eyes had suddenly received a great
  mental tonic.</p>

  <p>'You made notes? Not one man in ten would have thought of that,' said Mr
  Reeder. 'I thought I was the only person who did it.'</p>

  <p>Clive Desboyne laughed.</p>

  <p>'I've given you the impression that I'm terribly methodical,' he said,
  'and that isn't quite exact.' He looked at the watch on his wrist. 'It's too
  late to ask you to breakfast.'</p>

  <p>'Breakfast is my favourite meal,' said Mr. Reeder gaily.</p>

  <p>Late as was the hour, he was standing in front of the polished mahogany
  door of 974, Memorial Mansions, Park Lane, at nine o'clock next morning. Mr
  Desboyne was not so early a riser, and indeed had doubted whether the
  detective would keep his promise. Mr. Reeder was left standing in the hall
  while the valet went to inquire exactly how this strangely appearing
  gentleman should be disposed of.</p>

  <p>There was plenty to occupy Mr. Reeder's attention during his absence, for
  the wide hall was hung with photographs which gave some indication of
  Desboyne's wide sporting and theatrical interests. There was one interesting
  photograph, evidently an enlargement of a snapshot showing the House of
  Commons in the background, which held Mr. Reeder's attention, the more so as
  the photograph also showed the corner of Westminster Bridge across which
  buses were moving. He was looking at this when Clive Desboyne joined him.</p>

  <p>'Here is a piece of detective work,' said Mr. Reeder triumphantly,
  pointing to the photograph. 'I can tell you almost to the week that picture
  was taken. Do you see those two omnibuses bearing the names of two plays? I
  happen to know there was only one week in the year when they were both
  running together.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed,' said Desboyne, apparently not as impressed by this piece of
  deduction as Mr. Reeder had expected.</p>

  <p>He led the way to the dining-room, and Reeder found by the side of his
  plate three foolscap sheets covered with writing.</p>

  <p>'I don't know whether you'll be able to read it,' said Desboyne, 'but
  you'll notice there are one or two things that I forgot to tell you at the
  interview. I think on the whole they favour Southers, and I'm glad I made a
  note of them. For example, he said he had never seen Southers and only knew
  him by name. That in itself is rather curious.'</p>

  <p>'Very,' said Mr. Reeder. 'Regarding that photograph in the hall&mdash;it
  must have been in May last year. I remember some years ago, by a lucky
  chance, I was able to establish the date on which a cheque was passed, as
  distinct from the date on which it was drawn, by the fact that the drawer had
  forgotten to sign one of his initials.'</p>

  <p>It was surprising how much Mr. Reeder, who was not as a rule a loquacious
  man, talked in the course of that meal. Mostly he talked about nothing. When
  Clive Desboyne led him to the murder Mr. Reeder skilfully edged away to less
  unpleasant topics.</p>

  <p>'It doesn't interest me very much, I confess,' he said. 'I am not a member
  of the&mdash;um&mdash;Criminal Investigation Department; I was merely called
  in to deal with this man's smuggling&mdash;and he seems to have smuggled
  pretty extensively. It is distressing that young Southers is implicated. He
  seems a nice lad, and has rather a sane view of the care of chickens. For
  example, he was telling me that he had an incubator...'</p>

  <p>At the end of the meal he asked permission to take away the notes for
  study, and this favour was granted.</p>

  <p>He was at the house in Shadwick Lane half an hour later. Gaylor, who had
  arranged to meet him there, had not arrived, and Mr. Reeder had two men who
  had had semi-permanent jobs on the wharf. It was the duty of one to open and
  close the gates and pilot the lorries to their positions. He had also, as had
  his companion, to assist at the loading.</p>

  <p>They had not seen much of Attymar all the years they had been there. He
  usually came in on one of the night or early morning tides. Ligsey paid them
  their wages.</p>

  <p>'There was never any change,' said one mournfully. 'We ain't had the gates
  painted since I've bin here&mdash;we've had the same little anvil to keep the
  gate open&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He looked round first one side and then the other. The same little anvil
  was not there.</p>

  <p>'Funny,' he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder agreed. Who would steal a rusty little anvil? He saw the place
  where it had lain; the impression of it still stood in the dusty earth.</p>

  <p>Later came Gaylor, in a hurry to show him over the other rooms of the
  house. There was a kitchen, a rather spacious cellar, which was closed by a
  heavy door, and one bedroom that had been divided into two unequal parts by a
  wooden partition. The bedroom was simply but cleanly furnished. There was a
  bed and bedstead, a dressing-table with a large mirror, and a chest of
  drawers, which was empty. Indeed, there was no article of Attymar's visible,
  except an old razor, a stubbly shaving brush and six worn shirts that had
  been washed until they were threadbare. From the centre of the ceiling hung
  an electric light with an opalescent shade; another light hung over a small
  oak desk, in which, Gaylor informed him, most of the documents in the case
  had been found. But Mr. Reeder's chief interest was in the mirror, and in the
  greasy smear which ran from the top left hand corner almost along the top of
  the mirror. The glass itself was supported by two little mahogany pillars,
  and to the top of each of these was attached a piece of string.</p>

  <p>'Most amusing,' said Reeder, speaking his thoughts aloud.</p>

  <p>'Remind me to laugh,' said Mr. Gaylor heavily. 'What is amusing?'</p>

  <p>For answer Mr. Reeder put up his hand and ran the tip of his finger along
  the smear. Then he began to prowl around the apartment obviously looking for
  something, and as obviously disappointed that it could not be found.</p>

  <p>'No, nothing has been taken out of here,' said Gaylor in answer to his
  question, 'except the papers. Here's something that may amuse you more.'</p>

  <p>He opened a door leading to the bedroom. Here was a cupboard&mdash;it was
  little bigger. The walls and floor were covered with white tiles, as also was
  the back of the door. From the ceiling projected a large nozzle, and in one
  of the walls were two taps.</p>

  <p>'How's that for luxury? Shower bath&mdash;hot and cold water. Doesn't that
  make you laugh?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing makes me laugh except the detectives in pictures,' said Mr.
  Reeder calmly. 'Do you ever go to the cinema, Gaylor?'</p>

  <p>The inspector admitted that occasionally he did.</p>

  <p>'I like to see detectives in funny films, because they always carry large
  magnifying glasses. Do they make you laugh?'</p>

  <p>'They do,' admitted Mr. Gaylor, with a contemptuous and reminiscent
  smile.</p>

  <p>'Then get ready to howl,' said Mr. Reeder, and from his pocket took the
  largest reading glass that Gaylor had ever seen.</p>

  <p>Under the astonished eyes of the detective Reeder went down on his knees
  in the approved fashion, and began carefully to scrutinize the floor. Inch by
  inch he covered, stopping now and again to pick up something invisible to the
  Scotland Yard man, and placed it in an envelope which he had also taken from
  his pocket.</p>

  <p><a id="pic8a"

         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>'Cigar ash?' asked Gaylor sardonically.</p>

  <p>'Almost,' said Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>He went on with his search, then suddenly he sat back on his heels, his
  eyes ablaze, and held up a tiny piece of silver paper, less than a quarter of
  an inch square. Gaylor looked down more closely.</p>

  <p>'Oh, it's a cigarette you're looking for?'</p>

  <p>But Mr. Reeder was oblivious to all sarcasm. Inside the silver paper was a
  scrap of transparent paper, so thin that it seemed part of the tinsel. Very
  carefully, however, he separated the one from the other, touched its surface
  and examined his finger-tips.</p>

  <p>'Where's the fireplace?' he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>'There's a fireplace in the kitchen&mdash;that's the only one.' Mr. Reeder
  hurried downstairs and examined this small apartment. There were ashes in the
  grate, but it was impossible to tell what had been burnt.</p>

  <p>'I should like to say,' said Gaylor, 'that your efforts are wasted, for
  we've got enough in the diary to hang Southers twice over. Only I suspect you
  when you do things unnecessarily.'</p>

  <p>'The diary?' Mr. Reeder looked up.</p>

  <p>'Yes, Attymar's.'</p>

  <p>'So he kept a diary, did he?' Mr. Reeder was quite amused. 'I should have
  thought he would, If I had thought about it at all.'</p>

  <p>Then he frowned.</p>

  <p>'Not an ordinary diary, of course? Just an exercise book. It
  begins&mdash;let me see&mdash;shall we say two weeks ago, or three
  weeks?'</p>

  <p>Gaylor gazed at him in amazement. 'Mason told you?'</p>

  <p>'No, he didn't tell me anything, partly because he hasn't spoken to me.
  But, of course, it would be in a sort of exercise book. An ordinary printed
  diary that began on the first of January would be unthinkable This case is
  getting so fascinating that I can hardly stop laughing!'</p>

  <p>He was not laughing; he was very serious indeed, as he stood in the untidy
  yard in front of the little house and looked across its littered surf
  ace.</p>

  <p>'There is no sign of the tender that brought Ligsey here? The little boy
  on the barge was much more informative than he imagined! I'll tell you what
  to look for, shall I? A black, canoe-shaped motor boat which might hold three
  people at a pinch. Remember that&mdash;a canoe-shaped boat, say ten feet
  long.'</p>

  <p>Where shall I find it?' asked the fascinated Gaylor.</p>

  <p>'At the bottom of the river,' said Mr. Reeder calmly, 'and in or near it
  you will find a little anvil which used to keep the gate open!'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder had a very large acquaintance with criminals, larger perhaps
  than the average police officer, whose opportunities are circumscribed by the
  area to which he is attached; and he knew that the business of detection
  would be at a standstill if there were such a thing in the world as a really
  clever criminal. By the just workings of providence, men who gain their
  living by the evasion of the law are deprived of the eighth sense which,
  properly functioning, would keep them out of the hands of the police.</p>

  <p>He made yet another survey of the house before he left, pointed out to
  Gaylor something which that officer had already noticed, namely, the
  bloodstains on the floor and the wall of a small lobby which connected the
  main living-room with the yard.</p>

  <p>'Naturally I saw it,' said Gaylor, who was inclined to be a little
  complacent. 'My theory is that the fight started in the sitting-room; they
  struggled out into the passage&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'That would be impossible,' murmured Mr. Reeder.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; MYSTERY</h2>

  <p class="first">JOHN SOUTHERS made a brief appearance at the Tower of London
  Police Court&mdash;a dazed, bewildered young man, so overwhelmed by his
  position that he could do no more than answer the questions put to him by the
  magistrate's clerk.</p>

  <p>Gaylor had seen him earlier in the morning.</p>

  <p>'He said nothing except that he went to Attymar's house&mdash;oh, yes, he
  admits that&mdash;by appointment. He says Attymar kept him waiting for some
  time before he opened the door, and then only allowed him to come into the
  lobby. He tells some rambling story about Attymar sending him to meet a man
  at Highgate. In fact, it's the usual man story.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder nodded. He was not unacquainted with that mysterious man who
  figures in the narratives of all arrested persons. Sometimes it was a man who
  gave the prisoner the stolen goods in the possession of which he had been
  found; sometimes it was the man who asked another to cash a forged cheque;
  but always it was a vague Somebody who could never be traced. Half the work
  of investigation which occupied the attention of the detective force
  consisted of a patient search for men who had no existence except in the
  imaginations of prisoners under remand.</p>

  <p>'Did he see him?' asked Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>Gaylor laughed. 'My dear chap, what a question!'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder fondled his bony chin. 'Is it possible to&mdash;um&mdash;have a
  little chat with our friend Southers?'</p>

  <p>Gaylor was dubious, and had reason for his doubt. Chief Constable Mason
  and the high men at Headquarters were at the moment writhing under a
  periodical wave of criticism which sweeps across Scotland Yard at regular
  intervals; and their latest delinquency was the cross-examination of a man
  under suspicion of a serious crime. There had been questions in Parliament,
  almost a Royal Commission.</p>

  <p>'I doubt it,' said Gaylor. 'The Chief is feeling rather sick about this
  Hanny business, and as the kick has come down from your department it isn't
  likely that they'll make an exception. I'll ask Mason and let you know.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder was home that afternoon when Anna Welford called. She was most
  amazingly calm. Mr. Reeder, who had shown some hesitation about receiving
  her, was visibly relieved.</p>

  <p>'Have you seen Johnny?' was the first question she asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder shook his head, and explained to her that in the strictest
  sense he was not in the case, and that the police were very jealous of
  interference.</p>

  <p>'Clive has been to see me,' she said when he had finished, 'and he has
  told me everything&mdash;he's terribly upset.'</p>

  <p>'Told you everything?' repeated Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>'About Ligsey, and the story that Clive told you. I understood&mdash;in a
  way. He is doing everything he can for Johnny; he has engaged a lawyer and
  briefed counsel.'</p>

  <p>For the second time Mr. Reeder motioned her to a chair and, when she was
  seated, continued his own restless pacing.</p>

  <p>'If there was any truth in that story, your Johnny should be rather well
  off,' he said. 'The wages of sin are rather&mdash;um&mdash;high. Yet his
  father told me this morning&mdash;I had a brief interview with him&mdash;that
  young Mr. Southers' bank balance is not an excessive one.'</p>

  <p>He saw her lower her eyes and heard the quick little sigh. 'They've found
  the money&mdash;I thought you knew that,' she said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder halted in his stride and peered down at her.</p>

  <p>'They've found the money?'</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>'The police came and made a search about an hour ago, and they found a box
  in the toolshed with hundreds of pounds in it, all in notes.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder did not often whistle, but he whistled now.</p>

  <p>'Does Mr. Desboyne know this?' he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>'Clive doesn't know. It happened after he'd left. He's been terribly
  nice&mdash;he's made one confession that isn't very flattering to me.'</p>

  <p>Reeder's eyes twinkled.</p>

  <p>'That he is&mdash;um&mdash;engaged to somebody else?' he suggested, and
  she stared at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>'Do you know?'</p>

  <p>'One has heard of such things,' said Mr. Reeder bravely. 'I was very
  glad,' she went on. 'It removed the'&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;' personal
  bias. He really is sorry for all he has said and done. Johnny's trouble has
  shaken him terribly. Clive thinks that the murder was committed by this man
  Ligsey,'</p>

  <p>'Oh!' said Mr. Reeder. 'That is interesting.'</p>

  <p>He stared down at her, pursing his lips thoughtfully.
  'The&mdash;um&mdash;police rather fancy that Mr. Ligsey is dead,' be said,
  and there was a note of irritation in his voice as though he resented the
  police holding any theory at all. 'Quite dead&mdash;um&mdash;murdered, in
  fact.'</p>

  <p>There was a long pause here. He knew instinctively that she had come to
  make some request, but it was not until she rose to go that she spoke her
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>'Clive wanted to see you himself to make a proposition. He said that he
  didn't think you were engaged on the&mdash;official side of the case. He's
  got a tremendous opinion of your cleverness, Mr. Reeder, and so of course
  have I. Is it humanly possible for you to take up this case... Johnny's side,
  I mean? Perhaps I'm being silly, but just now I'm clutching at straws.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder was looking out of the window, his head moving from side to
  side.</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid not,' he said. 'I really am afraid not! The people on
  your&mdash;um&mdash;friend's side are the police. If he is innocent, I am
  naturally on his side, with them. Don't you see, young lady, that when we
  prove a man's guilt we also prove every body else's innocence?'</p>

  <p>It was a long speech for Mr. Reeder, and he had not quite finished. He
  stood with his hands deep in his pocket, his eyes half closed, his body
  swaying to and fro.</p>

  <p>'Let me see now&mdash;if Ligsey were alive?&mdash;A very dense and stupid
  young man, quite incapable, I should have thought, of&mdash;um&mdash;so many
  things that have happened during the last twenty-four hours.'</p>

  <p>After Anna had left, he went to Southers' house and interviewed Johnny's
  father. The old man was bearing his sorrow remarkably well. Indeed, his
  principal emotion was a loud fury against the people who dared accuse his
  son.</p>

  <p>He led the way to the toolshed in the yard and showed the detective just
  where the box had been hidden.</p>

  <p>'Personally, I never go into the shed. It's Johnny's little cubby hutch,'
  she said. 'The boy's fond of gardening and, like you, Mr. Reeder, he has a
  fancy for poultry.'</p>

  <p>'Is the shed kept locked?'</p>

  <p>'No, I've never seen it locked,' said old Southers.</p>

  <p>The place from which the box had been extricated was at the far end of the
  shed. It had been concealed behind a bag of chicken seed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder took a brief survey of the garden: it was an oblong strip of
  ground, measuring about a hundred yards by twenty. At the further end of the
  garden was a wall which marked the boundary of the garden which backed on to
  it. The garden could be approached either from the door leading to a small
  glass conservatory, or along a narrow gravel strip which ran down one side of
  the house. Ingress, however, was barred by a small door stretched across the
  narrow path.</p>

  <p>'But it's seldom locked,' said Southers. 'We leave it open for the
  milkman; he goes round to the kitchen that way in the morning.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder went back to the garden and walked slowly along the gravel path
  which ran between two large flower-beds. At the farther end was a wired-in
  chicken run. Mr. Reeder surveyed the flower-beds meditatively.</p>

  <p>'Nobody has dug up the garden?' he asked, and, when the other replied in
  the negative: 'Then I should do a bit of digging myself if I were you, Mr
  Southers,' he said gently; 'and whether you tell the police what you find, or
  do not tell the police, is entirely a matter for your own conscience.'</p>

  <p>He looked up at the sky for a long time as though he were expecting to see
  something unusual, and then:</p>

  <p>'If it is consistent with your&mdash;um&mdash;conscience to say nothing
  about your discovery, and if you removed it or them to a safe place where it
  or they would not be found, it might be to the advantage of your son in the
  not too distant future.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Southers was a little agitated, more than a little bewildered, when Mr
  Reeder took his leave. He was to learn that the ban on his activities in
  regard to the Attymar murder had been strengthened rather than relaxed, and
  he experienced a gentle but malignant pleasure in the thought that in one
  respect he had made their task a little more difficult.</p>

  <p>It was Gaylor who brought the news.</p>

  <p>'I spoke to the Chief about your seeing Southers in Brixton, but he
  thought it was best if you kept out of the case until the witnesses are
  tested.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder's duties in the Public Prosecutor's Department were to examine
  witnesses prior to their appearance in court, to test the strength or the
  weakness of their testimony, and he had been employed in this capacity before
  his official connection with the department was made definite.</p>

  <p>'At the same time,' Gaylor went on, 'if you can pick up anything we'll be
  glad to have it.'</p>

  <p>'Naturally,' murmured Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>'I mean, you may by accident hear things&mdash;you know these people: they
  live in the same street: and I think you know the young lady Southers is
  engaged to?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder inclined his head.</p>

  <p>'There's another thing, Mr. Reeder,' Gaylor evidently felt he was treading
  on delicate ground, having summarily declined and rejected the assistance of
  his companion. 'If you should hear from Ligsey&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'A voice from the grave,' interrupted Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>'Well, there's a rumour about that he's not dead. In fact, the boy on the
  barge, Hobbs, says that Ligsey came alongside last night in a skiff and told
  him to keep his mouth shut about what he'd seen and heard. My own opinion is
  that the boy was dreaming, but one of Ligsey's pals said he'd also seen him
  or heard him&mdash;I don't know which. That's a line of investigation you
  might take on for your own amusement&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Investigation doesn't amuse me,' said Mr. Reeder calmly; 'it bores me. It
  wearies me. It brings me in a certain&mdash;um&mdash;income, but doesn't
  amuse me.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said the detective awkwardly, 'if it interests you, that's a line
  you might take up.'</p>

  <p>'I shall not dream of taking up any line at all. It means work, and I do
  not like work.'</p>

  <p>Here, however, he was permitting himself to romance.</p>

  <p>That afternoon he spent in the neighbourhood which Ligsey knew best. He
  talked with lorry drivers and van boys, little old women who kept tiny and
  unremunerative shops, and the consequence of all his oblique questionings was
  that he made a call in Little Calais Street, where lived an unprepossessing
  young lady who had gained certain social recognition&mdash;her portrait would
  appear in the next morning's newspapers&mdash;because she had been engaged to
  the missing man. She had, in fact, walked out with him, among others, for the
  greater part of a year.</p>

  <p>Miss Rosie Loop did not suggest romance; she was short, rather stout, had
  bad teeth and a red face; for the moment she was important, and might not
  have seen Mr. Reeder but for the mistaken belief that he was associated with
  the Press.</p>

  <p>'Who shall I say it is?' asked her blowsy mother, who answered the
  door.</p>

  <p>'The editor of <i>The Times</i>,' said Mr. Reeder without hesitation.</p>

  <p>In the stuffy little kitchen where the bereaved fiancée was eating bread
  and jam, Mr. Reeder was given a clean Windsor chair, and sat down to hear the
  exciting happening of the previous night.</p>

  <p>'I haven't told the Press yet,' said Rosie, who had a surprisingly shrill
  voice for one so equipped by nature for the deeper tones. 'He come last
  night. I sleep upstairs with mother, and whenever he used to anchor off the
  crik, he used to come ashore, no matter what time it was, and throw up a
  couple of stones to let me know he was here. About 'arf past two it was last
  night, and lord! it gave me a start.'</p>

  <p>'He threw up the stones to let you know he was there?' suggested Mr
  Reeder.</p>

  <p>She nodded violently.</p>

  <p>'And was it Mr. Ligsey?'</p>

  <p>'It was him!' she said dramatically. 'I wouldn't go to the window for a
  long time, but mother said "Don't be such a fool, a ghost carn't hurt yer,"
  and then I pulled up the sash and there he was in his old oilskin coat. I
  asked him where he'd bin, but he was in a 'urry. Told me not to get worried
  about him as he was all right.'</p>

  <p>'How did he look?' asked Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>She rolled her head impatiently.</p>

  <p>'Didn't I tell yer it was the middle of the night. But that's what he
  said&mdash;"Don't get worried about anything"&mdash;and then he popped
  off.'</p>

  <p>'And you popped in?' said Mr. Reeder pleasantly. 'He didn't have a cold or
  anything, did he?'</p>

  <p>Her mouth opened.</p>

  <p>'You've seen him? Where is he?'</p>

  <p>'I haven't seen him, but he had a cold?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, he had,' she admitted, 'and so would you 'ave if you 'ad to go up
  and down that river all day and night. It's a horrible life. I hope he's
  going to give it up. He's bound to get some money if he comes forward and
  tells the police the truth. It was very funny, me thinkin' he was dead. We'd
  bin to buy our black&mdash;hadn't we, mother?'</p>

  <p>Mother offered a hoarse confirmation.</p>

  <p>'And all the papers sayin' he was dead, an' dragging the river for him,
  an' that Captain Attymar. He used to treat Ligsey like a dog.'</p>

  <p>'He hasn't written to you?'</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>'He was never a one for writing.'</p>

  <p>'What time was this?'</p>

  <p>She could tell him exactly, because she had heard Greenwich church
  striking the half-hour.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder might be bored with investigation, but he found some
  satisfaction in boredom.</p>

  <p>The Allanuna still lay off Greenwich, and he hired a boat to take him to
  the barge. The disconsolate Master Hobbs was still on board, and even the
  fact that he was now commander did not compensate him for his loneliness,
  though apparently the police had supplied him with food and had arranged to
  relieve him that evening.</p>

  <p>He was very emphatic about the visitation of Ligsey. He had rowed
  alongside and whistled to the boy&mdash;the whistle had wakened him. From
  under the companion steps he had looked over and seen him sitting in the
  boat, a big white bandage round his head. Miss Rosie had said nothing about
  the white bandage but, calling there on his way home, Reeder had
  confirmation.</p>

  <p>'Yes, I forgot to tell you about that,' said Rosie. 'I see it under 'is
  'at. I said "What's that white round your head?" Fancy me forgettin' to tell
  you that!'</p>

  <p>As a matter of form, Mr. Reeder, when he got home that night, jotted down
  certain sequences.</p>

  <p>At some time after eight on the night of the murder, Attymar had come in a
  launch, had collected Ligsey and taken him towards London. At nine-thirty
  Johnny Southers had called at Attymar's house and, according to his story,
  had been sent on a fool's errand to Highgate. At some time about eleven
  o'clock the murder had been discovered&mdash;Mr. Reeder put down his pen and
  frowned.</p>

  <p>'I'm getting old and stupid,' he said, reached for the telephone and
  called a number to which he knew Gaylor would certainly be attached at that
  hour.</p>

  <p>It was Gaylor's clerk who answered him and, after about four minutes'
  wait, Gaylor himself spoke.</p>

  <p>'Have you found anything, Mr. Reeder?'</p>

  <p>'I find I am suffering from a slight softening of the brain,' said Mr
  Reeder pleasantly. 'Do you realize I never asked how the murder was
  discovered?'</p>

  <p>He heard Gaylor laugh.</p>

  <p>'Didn't I tell you? It was very simple. A policeman on his beat found the
  wicket door open, saw the lantern on the ground and the other lantern burning
  in the lobby of the house&mdash;what's the matter?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder was laughing.</p>

  <p>'Pardon me,' he said at last. 'Are you sure there wasn't an alarm bell
  ringing?'</p>

  <p>'I didn't hear of any alarm bell&mdash;in fact, I don't know that there is
  one.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder exchanged a few commonplaces, denied that he was making any
  inquiries about Ligsey and, replacing the receiver, sat back in his chair,
  his hands clasped about his middle and real amusement in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Later he had a call from the solicitor engaged to defend young Southers.
  He also suggested that Mr. Reeder should place his services at the call of
  the defence; but again he refused.</p>

  <p>Opening the telephone directory, he found the number of Mr. Clive
  Desboyne, and it was that gentleman who answered his call.</p>

  <p>'That's queer, I was just going to ring you up,' said Desboyne. 'Have you
  taken up the case?'</p>

  <p>'I am wavering,' replied Reeder. 'Before I reach a decision I'd like to
  have another talk with you. Could I call at your flat tonight
  about&mdash;nine?'</p>

  <p>There was a pause.</p>

  <p>'Certainly. I was going out, but I'll wait in for you.'</p>

  <p>At the conclusion of this call Mr. Reeder again leaned back in his chair,
  but this time he was not smiling; he was rather puzzled. Perhaps he was
  thinking of Ligsey; possibly he was impressed by the generosity of this man
  who was ready to spend a considerable part of his fortune to prove the
  innocence of a man he disliked.</p>

  <p>Whatever trains of thoughts started and slowed, switched into side tracks
  or ran off into tributary lines, they all arrived at one mysterious
  destination...</p>

  <p>'It will be spring-cleaning,' said Mr. Reeder, as he got up from his
  chair.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; THE REVOLVER CLUE</h2><img src=

        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">REEDER spent the rest of the afternoon in the West End of
  London, calling upon a succession of theatrical agents. Some were very
  important personages who received him in walnut-panelled salons; a few were
  in dingy offices on third floors; one, and the most important of these, he
  interviewed in the bar of a public-house in St. Martin's Lane&mdash;a fat and
  seedy man, with a fur collar and frayed cuffs, a half-stupid tippler with no
  business but many reminiscences; and, as he proudly claimed, the best
  collection of old theatrical programmes in London.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder, who was a good listener and very patient, heard all about the
  agent's former grandeur, the amount of commission out of which eminent
  artistes had swindled him, and at last he accompanied his bibulous companion
  to his lodgings off the Waterloo Road, and from seven till eight was
  engrossed in masses of dog-eared literature.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder had a meal in a Strand restaurant and drove to Park Lane. As
  the lift carried him to the floor on which Desboyne's flat was
  situated&mdash;</p>

  <p>'I'm sure it's spring cleaning,' murmured Mr. Reeder to himself.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell of the flat and waited. Presently he heard the sound of
  footsteps echoing hollowly in the hall. Clive Desboyne opened the door with
  an apologetic smile.</p>

  <p>'I hope you don't mind the place being in confusion?' he said. 'We've
  started our spring cleaning. The truth is, I'd arranged to go away today if
  this wretched business hadn't turned up.'</p>

  <p>The carpet had been taken up from the floor of the hall, the walls had
  been stripped, and the crystal pendant which lit the hall showed through a
  gauze covering. Clive Desboyne's own study had, however, been left untouched
  by the decorators. 'I'm going to clear out to an hotel tomorrow. It'll
  probably be the Ritz-Carlton, but if you want me urgently my solicitors will
  be able to put us in touch. Now, Mr. Reeder, you're going to do this for Anna
  and me?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder shook his head feebly.</p>

  <p>'You've got to do it,' insisted the other energetically. 'You're the only
  detective in London in whom I've any confidence. I know you're attached to
  the Public Prosecutor's Department, but I've been making a few inquiries
  too,' he said with a little smile, 'and I hear that you take outside
  commissions.'</p>

  <p>'Banks,' said Mr. Reeder reverently. 'Banks&mdash;not private work.'</p>

  <p>'I shall insist!' Clive was very earnest. 'I've told Anna
  everything&mdash;about the way I behaved over young Southers. Honestly, I
  still think that Ligsey's story was true and that Southers was making
  something on the side. A lot of decent people, otherwise perfectly honest, do
  that sort of thing, and I'm not condemning him. In fact, when I expressed
  my&mdash;what's the word for being shocked?'</p>

  <p>'Horror, amazement?' suggested Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>'Well, whatever it was&mdash;I was being a hypocrite. I myself haven't
  always been rich. I've known what it is to be devilishly poor. If I hadn't
  made good speculations when I was quite a kid, I should probably be worse off
  than Southers.'</p>

  <p>'You're rather fond of the young lady?' said Mr. Reeder after an
  interregnum of silence.</p>

  <p>Again Desboyne laughed.</p>

  <p>'Of course I am! The fact that a man is engaged to another girl&mdash;and
  the sweetest girl in the world&mdash;doesn't prevent him philandering. Of
  course, it's got me into quite a lot of trouble, but the fact remains, I'm
  terribly fond of Anna. I won't say I love her like a brother, because I'm
  tired of being a hypocrite. I'm going to try to get Southers out of the mess
  he's in; and that doesn't mean I love him like a brother, either! Now, Mr
  Reeder, what do you want to see me about, if it isn't to tell me that you're
  taking up this case?'</p>

  <p>All that Mr. Reeder wanted to see Clive Desboyne about was spring
  cleaning, but he could not say this. He had, however, a good excuse for
  calling: Ligsey was apparently alive, he explained. Clive Desboyne was not
  impressed.</p>

  <p>'I didn't worry whether he was alive or dead,' he said frankly.
  'Naturally, I don't know what theory the police have, but I understood from
  the newspapers that they were concentrating on the murder of
  Attymar&mdash;that is the charge against John Southers. If Ligsey is alive
  I'm hardly likely to meet him, unless, of course, he feels, as so many of
  these crooks do, that once one has given them money they're entitled to a
  pension! If I hear from him I'll let you know.'</p>

  <p>As they came out into the hall Mr. Reeder's eyes wandered up and down the
  bare walls.</p>

  <p>'You will have this repainted, Mr. Desboyne?' he asked. 'At present it is
  rather a delicate cream. If I were you I should have it painted green. Green
  is a very restful colour, but possibly my views
  are&mdash;um&mdash;suburban.'</p>

  <p>'I think they are,' said the other good-humouredly.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Mr. Reeder had made an appointment to see the bibulous agent
  at ten o'clock. The agent knew where certain photographs were to be obtained,
  and had promised to be waiting at the corner of St. Martin's Lane at that
  hour. Mr. Reeder arrived as St. Martin's Church clock was striking, but there
  was no sign of Billy Gurther. He had not appeared at half-past ten, and Mr.
  Reeder decided to go to his house, for he was very anxious to complete his
  dossier.</p>

  <p>The landlady at Mr. Gurther'a lodgings had a surprising and disconcerting
  story to tell. Mr. Reeder had hardly left (she had witnessed his departure)
  before a messenger came, and Billy had gone out. He had returned in half an
  hour, very voluble and excited. He had been given a commission to collect
  cabaret turns in Spain. He had to leave London some time after nine, travel
  all night, and catch the Sud Express in the morning. He was plentifully
  supplied with money.</p>

  <p>'He was so excited, he was nearly sober,' said the uncharitable landlady.
  The sudden departure of an obscure music-hall agent, of whose existence he
  had been unaware until that afternoon, did not at all distress Mr. Reeder. It
  was the circumstances which attended his leaving, its rapidity, and, most
  important of all, the knowledge that was behind the sudden move, which made
  him alert and watchful.</p>

  <p>He might not be <i>persona grata</i> at Scotland Yard, but little things
  like that did not trouble Mr. Reeder and later that night he drove to the big
  building on the Thames Embankment and sought, nay, demanded, an interview
  with the Chief Constable, who should have been at home and in bed, but was in
  fact in consultation with his five chiefs when the detective arrived.</p>

  <p>The first message sent to Mr. Reeder was cold and unpromising. Would he
  call in the morning? It was Gaylor who was detached from the conference to
  carry this message.</p>

  <p>'Go back to your chief, Mr. Gaylor,' said Reeder acidly, 'and tell him I
  wish to see him this evening, at once. If I see him tomorrow it will be at
  the Home Office.'</p>

  <p>This was a threat: nobody knew it better than Gaylor. The exact extent and
  volume of Reeder's power was not known. One thing was certain: he could be
  extremely unpleasant, and the consequences of his displeasure might even
  affect a man's career. Gaylor returned instantly and summoned him to the
  conference, and there Mr. Reeder sat down and, quite uninvited, expounded a
  theory, and supported his fantastic ideas with a considerable amount of grimy
  literature.</p>

  <p>'We can stop Gurther at Southampton,' suggested Gaylor, but Reeder shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>'I think not. Let him soak into the Continent, and then we may pick him up
  without any trouble. Send a man to Southampton, and let him shadow him to
  Paris. In Paris he can blanket him.'</p>

  <p>Mason nodded.</p>

  <p>'If your theory is correct, there must be a method of proving it,' he
  said; 'not a simple one perhaps&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'On the contrary, a very simple one,' said Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>He turned to Gaylor.</p>

  <p>'You remember the bedroom above the one where the murder took place, or
  where we think it was committed? You probably took a photograph.'</p>

  <p>'I'll get it right away,' said Gaylor, and left the room. He was back with
  a sheaf of photographic enlargements which he laid on the table.</p>

  <p>'There it is,' said Reeder, and pointed.</p>

  <p>'The clock? Yes, I noticed that.'</p>

  <p>'Naturally,' said Reeder.</p>

  <p>'But most people who go to sea, or even bargees, have it put there.'</p>

  <p>The little clock was fastened to the ceiling, immediately over the
  bedstead, so that anybody lying in bed could look up and tell the time. It
  had luminous hands, Reeder had noticed.</p>

  <p>'I want you to have that clock removed and the ceiling plastered. I want
  you to take away the bed and put a table and chair there. In two days I think
  I will make the further prosecution of young Southers unnecessary.'</p>

  <p>'You can do as you like,' said Mason. 'You're well in the case now, Mr
  Reeder. I've put out a special call to get Ligsey, and the river police are
  searching all the reaches.'</p>

  <p>'The river police are more likely to get Mr. Ligsey than any other section
  of the Metropolitan Police Force,' replied Reeder.</p>

  <p>Big Ben was striking eleven as he mounted a bus that carried him from
  Westminster Bridge to the end of his road. In the days, and particularly the
  nights, when Mr. Reeder was heavily engaged in his hazardous occupation his
  housekeeper remained on duty until he was ready to go to bed. She met him at
  the door now with a telephone message.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Gaylor called up, sir. He says he's sending you a lacquered box which
  he wishes you to examine, and will you be careful not to touch it with your
  fingers because of the prince? He didn't say which prince it was.'</p>

  <p>'I think I know His Highness,' said Mr. Reeder, who was a little ruffled
  that Gaylor should find it necessary to warn him against oversmearing
  fingerprints. 'Has the box arrived?'</p>

  <p>'Ten minutes ago, sir.'</p>

  <p>'When did Mr. Gaylor telephone?'</p>

  <p>She was rather vague as to this; thought it might have been half an hour
  before. In that case, thought Reeder, it must have been immediately after he
  left the Yard, and the box must have come on by cyclist messenger.</p>

  <p>He found it on his table in a service envelope, and took it out: a heavy,
  oblong box about six inches long and three inches square. Pen-printed on the
  lid, which was tacked down, were the words: 'Mr. Reeder to see and return.
  Room 75, New Scotland Yard.' Reeder weighed the package in his hand.</p>

  <p>Some people remember by smell, some trust to their eyesight, and the
  recollections of vision. Mr. Reeder had a remarkable sense of
  weight&mdash;and he remembered something that weighed just as heavy as this.
  He put the package carefully on the table and rang through to Scotland Yard.
  Gaylor had gone. He tried him at his house, but he had not arrived.</p>

  <p>'Tell him to phone the moment he comes in,' he said, and went to his desk
  to examine for the third time that day, the old music-hall programmes and
  playbills, photographs, cuttings from the <i>Era</i> and the <i>Stage</i>,
  the data which he had collected in the course of the day.</p>

  <p>At one o'clock his housekeeper came in and asked if any thing more would
  be required.</p>

  <p>'Nothing at all,' said Mr. Reeder. And then a thought struck him. 'Where
  do you sleep?'</p>

  <p>'In the room above, sir.'</p>

  <p>'Above this?' said Mr. Reeder hastily. 'No, no, I think you'd better stay
  in the kitchen until I hear from Mr. Gaylor. If you could make yourself
  comfortable there, in fact if you could sleep there, I should be very much
  obliged. There is nothing to be alarmed about,' he said, when he saw
  consternation dawning in her face. 'It is merely that I may want
  to&mdash;um&mdash;send a detective upstairs to&mdash;um&mdash;overhear a
  conversation.'</p>

  <p>It was a lame excuse. Mr. Reeder was a poor liar; but his housekeeper was
  a very simple soul and, except that she insisted on going up to make the room
  tidy, agreed to retire to the basement. She had hardly gone when Gaylor came
  through, and for five minutes he and Reeder spoke together. After this the
  detective settled down to await his coming, and Inspector Gaylor did not
  arrive alone, but brought with him two expert officials from the Explosives
  Department. One of them had a delicate spring-balance, and with this the
  package was weighed.</p>

  <p>'Allow an ounce and a quarter for the wood,' said the expert, 'and that's
  the exact weight of a Mills bomb. I'm sure you're right, Mr. Reeder.'</p>

  <p>He held the package to his ear and shook it gently.</p>

  <p>'No, nothing more complicated.'</p>

  <p>He took a case of instruments from his pocket and removed a slither of
  wood from the lid.</p>

  <p>'Yes, there's the lever, and the pin's out,' he said after examining it
  under a strong light.</p>

  <p>He cut away the side, and revealed a black, segmented egg shape, grinning
  as he recognized an old friend.</p>

  <p>'You see that?' He pointed to a little hole at the end of the box. 'The
  fellow who brought this was taking no risks: he kept an emergency pin through
  until it was delivered. I'll have this out in a jiff.'</p>

  <p>It was no idle promise. Mr. Reeder watched with interest as the skilful
  fingers of the man removed the lid, catching the lever at the same time and
  holding it firm against the swelling side. From his pocket he took a steel
  pin and thrust it home, and the bomb became innocuous.</p>

  <p>'You've kept every scrap of paper, of course?' said Gaylor. 'There was no
  other packing but this?'</p>

  <p>Every piece of paper was carefully folded and put in an envelope, and the
  two explosive experts went down to pack away Mr. Reeder's dangerous gift.</p>

  <p>'There was a lot you didn't tell the chief,' said Gaylor at parting.
  'That's the trouble with you, you old devil!'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder looked pained.</p>

  <p>'That is not a very pleasant expression,' he said.</p>

  <p>'But it is,' insisted Gaylor. 'You always keep back some juicy bit to
  spring on us at the last moment. It's either your sense of drama or your
  sense of humour.'</p>

  <p>For a moment Reeder's eyes twinkled, and then his face became a mask
  again.</p>

  <p>'I have no&mdash;um&mdash;sense of humour,' he said.</p>

  <p>He had at any rate a sense of vanity, and he was irritated that his little
  idiosyncrasy had been so cruelly exposed to description.</p>

  <p>He was up at six the next morning, and by half past seven was on his way
  to the Thames Valley. On the previous day he had telephoned to eight separate
  boathouses between Windsor and Henley, and he was satisfied that he had found
  what he wanted in the neighbourhood of Bourne End. He had telephoned to the
  boatbuilder on whom he was calling, and he found that industrious man at work
  in his yard.</p>

  <p>'You're the gentleman who wanted to know about the <i>Zaira</i>? I was
  going to send one of my boys up to see if she was still tied up, but I
  haven't been able to spare him this morning.'</p>

  <p>'I'm rather glad you haven't,' said Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>'It was a funny thing you telephoning to me when did,' said the builder.
  'She'd just gone past on her way to Marlow. No, I've never seen her before,
  but I caught the name; in fact, it was because she was new in this part of
  the river that I noticed her. She's a forty-foot cruiser, nearly new, and I
  should think she's got pretty powerful engines. As it was, she made a bit of
  a wash.'</p>

  <p>He explained that after Mr. Reeder's inquiry he had telephoned through to
  Marlow, had learned that the boat had not passed, and had sent one of his
  assistants up the towpath to locate her.</p>

  <p>'She's lying at a private quay that runs in from the river to a big red
  house which has been empty for years. There's nobody on board her, and I
  suppose the owner's had permission from the agents. Are you thinking of
  buying her?'</p>

  <p>That view had never presented itself to Mr. Reeder. He thought for a long
  time, and gave the boatbuilder the impression that it was only a question of
  price that prevented him from ownership.</p>

  <p>'Yes, it's quite usual for people to tie up and leave their boats for
  months at a time, especially at a private quay like that. It's not safe: you
  get a craft full of rats, especially in the winter months. These big boats
  cost a lot to keep up, and you couldn't afford to have a caretaker on
  board.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder made a very leisurely way along the towpath, stopping now and
  again to admire the lovely reach. Although he had explicit instructions, he
  might have passed the narrow canal which runs in from the river, in spite of
  the brick bridge across, for the stream was choked with weeds, and ran
  apparently into a tangle of trees and undergrowth. With some difficulty Mr.
  Reeder reached its bank. He then saw that the canal was brick-lined.
  Nevertheless, though he had this indication of its edge, he walked
  gingerly.</p>

  <p>It opened to a larger pool, a sort of backwater. Passing a clump of
  bushes, he came suddenly upon the boat. The bow lay almost within reach of
  his hand. It was tied up fore and aft and had a deserted appearance. Across
  the forepart of the boat was drawn a canvas cover, but he was prepared for
  this by the description of the boatbuilder. Mr. Reeder slipped his hand in
  his pocket and went cautiously along the length of the boat. He noted that
  all the portholes were not only closed but made opaque with brown paper.</p>

  <p>'Is anybody there?' he called loudly.</p>

  <p>There was no answer. In midstream a moorhen was paddling aimlessly; the
  sound of his voice sent it scurrying to cover.</p>

  <p>The foremost part of the ship was evidently the engine-room, and possibly
  accommodation for a small crew. The living saloon was aft. It was these that
  had their portholes covered. Both cabins were approached from the well deck
  amidships, and he saw here a canvas-covered wheel. The doors were padlocked
  on the outside.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder looked around, and stepped on to the boat down a short ladder
  to the well. He tried the padlock on the saloon door. It was fast; but it was
  a simple padlock, and if fortune favoured him, and the boat he sought was
  really discovered, he had prepared for such an emergency as this.</p>

  <p>He tried three of the keys which he took from his pocket before the lock
  snapped back. He unfastened the hasp, turned the handle and pulled open the
  door. He could see nothing for a moment, then he switched on a torch and sent
  its rays into the interior.</p>

  <p>The saloon was empty. The floor of it lay possibly eighteen inches below
  the level of the deck on which he was standing. And then&mdash;</p>

  <p>Lying in the middle of the floor, and glittering in the light of his lamp,
  was a white-handled, silver-plated revolver.</p>

  <p>'Very interesting,' said Mr. Reeder, and went down into the saloon.</p>

  <p>He reached the bottom of the steps and turned, walking backwards with his
  face to the door through which he had come, the muzzle of his Browning
  covering the opening. Presently his heel kicked the pistol. He took another
  step back and stooped to pick it up.</p>

        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">MR REEDER was conscious of a headache and that the light
  shining in his eyes was painful. It was a tiny globe which burned in the roof
  of the cabin. Somebody was talking very distressedly; the falsetto voices Mr.
  Reeder loathed. His senses came back gradually.</p>

  <p>He was shocked to find himself one of the figures in a most fantastical
  scene; something which did not belong to the great world of reality in which
  he lived and had his being. He was part of an episode, torn bodily from a
  most imaginative and impossible work of fiction.</p>

  <p>The man who sat in one corner of the lounge, clasping his knees,
  was&mdash; Mr. Reeder puzzled for a word. Theatrical, of course. That red
  silk robe, Mephistophelian cap, and a long black mask with a lace fringe that
  even hid the speaker's chin. His hands were covered with jewelled rings which
  scintillated in the feeble light overhead.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder could not very well move; he was handcuffed, his legs were
  strapped painfully together, and in his mouth was a piece of wood lightly
  tied behind his ears. It was not painful, but it could be, he realized. At
  any rate he was spared the necessity of replying to the exultant man who sat
  at the other end of the settee.</p>

  <p>'Did you hear what I said, my master of mystery?'</p>

  <p>He spoke with a slightly foreign accent, this man in the red robe.</p>

  <p>'You are so clever, and yet I am more clever, eh? All of it I planned out
  of my mind. The glittering silver pistol on the floor&mdash;that was the only
  way I could get you to stoop and bring your head into the gas. It was a very
  heavy gas which does not easily escape, but I was afraid you might have
  dropped a cigarette, and that would have betrayed everything. If you had
  waited a little time the gas would have rolled out of the open door; but no,
  you must have the pistol, so you stooped and picked it up, and
  <i>voilà!</i>'</p>

  <p>His hands glittered dazzlingly.</p>

  <p>'You are used to criminals of the stupid kind,' he went on. 'For the first
  time, my Reeder, you meet one who has planned everything step by step. Pardon
  me.'</p>

  <p>He stepped down to the floor, leaned forward and untied the gag.</p>

  <p>'I find it difficult if conversation is one-sided,' he said pleasantly.
  'If you make a fuss I shall shoot you and that will be the end. At present I
  desire that you should know everything. You know me?'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid I haven't that pleasure,' said Mr. Reeder, and the man
  chuckled.</p>

  <p>'If you had lived, I would have been your chief case, your <i>chef
  d'oeuvre</i>, the one man of your acquaintance who could plan murder
  and&mdash;what is the expression?&mdash;get away with it! Do you know where
  you are?'</p>

  <p>'I'm on the <i>Zaira</i>,' said Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>'Do you know who is her owner?'</p>

  <p>'She is owned by Mr. Clive Desboyne.'</p>

  <p>The man chuckled at this.</p>

  <p>'Poor fellow! The lovesick one, eh? For him this boat is&mdash;where do
  you think?&mdash;at Twickenham, for its spring repairs. He told you perhaps
  he had been mad enough to let it for two months? No, he did not tell you? Ah,
  that is interesting. Perhaps he forgot.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>'Now tell me, my friend&mdash;my time is very short and I cannot waste it
  here with you&mdash;do you know who killed Attymar?'</p>

  <p>'You are Attymar,' said Mr. Reeder, and was rewarded by a shrill chuckle
  of delighted laughter.</p>

  <p>'So clever, after all! It is a good thing I have you, eh?
  Otherwise'&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders lightly. 'That is the very best
  joke&mdash;I am Attymar! Do I speak like him, yes? Possibly&mdash;who
  knows?'</p>

  <p>He slipped from his seat and came stealthily towards Reeder and fixed the
  gag a little tighter.</p>

  <p>'Where shall you be this night, do you think, with a big, heavy chain
  fastened around you? I know all the deepest holes in this river, and years
  and years will pass before they find your body. To think that this great
  London shall lose its Mr. Reeder! So many people have tried to kill you, my
  friend, but they have failed because they are criminals&mdash;just stupid
  fellows who cannot plan like a general.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder said nothing; he could not raise his hand far enough to relieve
  the pressure on his mouth, for attached to the centre link of the handcuffs
  was a cord fastened to the strap about his ankles.</p>

  <p>The man in the red cloak bent over him, his eyes glaring through the holes
  in the mask.</p>

  <p>'Last night I tried you. I say to myself, "Is this man stupid or is he
  clever?"' He spoke quickly and in a low voice. 'So I send you the little
  bomb. I would have sent it also to Desboyne&mdash;he also will die tonight,
  and our friend Mr. Southers will be hanged, and there will be the end of you
  all! And I will go sailing to the southern seas, and no man will raise his
  hand against me, because I am clever.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder thought he was a little monotonous. In spite of his terrible
  position, he was intensely bored. The man in the red cloak must have heard
  something, for he went quickly to the door and listened more intently, then,
  mounting the stairs, slammed the door behind him and put on the padlock.</p>

  <p>Presently Mr. Reeder heard him mount the side of the boat and guessed he
  had stepped ashore to meet whatever interruption was threatened. It was, in
  truth, the boatbuilder, who had come to make inquiries, and the grey-haired
  man with the stoop and the white moustache and twisted face was able to
  assure him that Mr. Reeder had made an offer for the boat, but it had been
  rejected, and that the detective had gone on to Marlow.</p>

  <p>The prisoner had a quarter of an hour to consider his unfortunate position
  and to supply a remedy. Mr. Reeder satisfied himself that it was a simple
  matter to free his hands from the steel cuffs. He had peculiarly thin wrists
  and his large, bony hands were very deceptive. He freed one, adjusted the gag
  to a less uncomfortable tension, and brought himself to a sitting position.
  He swayed and would have fallen to the floor but for a stroke of luck. The
  effort showed him how dangerous it would be to make an attempt to escape
  before he recovered strength. His gun had been taken from him; the
  silver-handled revolver had also been removed. He resumed his handcuffs and
  had not apparently moved when his captor opened the door, only to look
  in.</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid you will have to do without food today&mdash;does it
  matter?'</p>

  <p>Now Mr. Reeder saw that on the inside of the saloon door was a steel door.
  It was painted the same colour as the woodwork, and it was on this discovery
  that he based his hope of life. For some reason, which he never understood,
  his enemy switched on two lights from the outside, and this afforded him an
  opportunity of taking stock of his surroundings.</p>

  <p>The portholes were impossible&mdash;he understood now why they had been
  made airtight with brown paper. It would be as much as he could do to get his
  arms through them. Having decided upon his plan of campaign, Mr. Reeder acted
  with his customary energy. He could not allow his life to depend on the
  caprice of this man. Evidently the intention was to take him out late at
  night, loaded with chains, and drop him overboard; but he might have cause to
  change his mind. And that, Mr. Reeder thought, would be very unfortunate.</p>

  <p>His worst forebodings were in a fair way to being realized, did he but
  know. The man who stood in his shirt sleeves, prodding at the centre of the
  backwater, had suddenly realized the danger which might follow the arrival of
  a curious-minded policeman. The boatbuilder would certainly gossip. Reeder
  had something of an international reputation, and the local police would be
  only too anxious to make his acquaintance.</p>

  <p>Gossip runs up and down a river with a peculiar facility. He went into the
  engine cabin, where he had stowed his fantastic robe and hat, and dragged out
  a little steel cylinder. Unfasten that nozzle, leave it on the floor near
  where the helpless man lay, and in a quarter of an hour perhaps...</p>

  <p>He cold-bloodedly pulled out two links of heavy chain and dropped them
  with a crash on the deck. Mr. Reeder heard the sound; he wrenched one hand
  free of the cuff, not without pain, broke the gag and, drawing himself up
  into a sitting position, unfastened the first of the two straps. His head was
  splitting from the effect of the gas. As his feet touched the floor he
  reeled. The second cuff he removed at his leisure. He was so close to the
  door now that he could drop the bar. It stuck for a little while, but
  presently he drew it down. It fell with a clatter into the pocket.</p>

  <p>The man on the deck heard, ran to the door and tugged, drew off the
  padlock and tried to force his way in.</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid you're rather late,' said Mr. Reeder politely.</p>

  <p>He could almost feel the vibration of the man's fury. His vanity had been
  hurt; he had been proved a bungler by the one man in the world he wished to
  impress, whilst life held any impressions for him.</p>

  <p>Then the man on the bridge heard a smash and saw some splinters of glass
  fly from one of the ports. There were five tiny airholes in one of the doors,
  but four of these had been plugged with clay. Taking the cylinder, he smashed
  the nozzle end through the obstruction. A wild, desperate idea came to the
  harassed man. Reeder heard the starting wheel turn, and presently the low hum
  of machinery. He heard the patter of feet across the deck and peered through
  the porthole, but it was below the level of the bank.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>He looked round for a weapon but could find none. Of one thing he was
  certain: Mr. Red Robe would not dare to run for the river. There was quite
  enough traffic there for him to attract attention. He could not afford to
  wait for darkness to fall; his position was as desperate as Reeder's own had
  been&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Bang!</i></p>

  <p>It was the sound of a shot, followed by another. Reeder heard somebody
  shout, then the sound of a man crashing through the bushes. Then he heard the
  deep voice of Clive Desboyne.</p>

  <p>'Reeder... are you there? How are you?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder, a slave to politeness, put his mouth up to the broken
  porthole.</p>

  <p>It was some time before Desboyne could knock off the padlock. Presently
  the door was opened and Mr. Reeder came out.</p>

  <p>'Thank God, you're safe!' said the other breathlessly. 'Who was the old
  bird who shot at me?'</p>

  <p>He pointed towards the place where the backwater turned.</p>

  <p>'Is there a house there or a road or something? That's the way he went.
  What's happened?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder was sitting on a deck chair, his throbbing head between his
  hands. After a while he raised his face.</p>

  <p>'I have met the greatest criminal in the world,' he said solemnly. 'He's
  so clever that he's alive. His name is Attymar!'</p>

  <p>Clive Desboyne opened his mouth in amazement.</p>

  <p>'Attymar? But he's dead!'</p>

  <p>'I hope so,' said Mr. Reeder viciously, 'but I have reason to know that he
  isn't. No, no, young man, I won't tell you what happened. I'm rather ashamed
  of myself. Anyway, I am not particularly proud of being caught by
  this'&mdash;he paused&mdash;'amateur. Why did you come?'</p>

  <p>'It was only by luck. I don't know why I came. I happened to phone through
  to Twickenham about some repairs to the boat&mdash;by the way, you must have
  seen a picture of it hanging in my hall. In fact, it was in that picture
  where you were clever enough to tell the date. I lend the <i>Zaira</i> at
  times; I lent it a few months ago to an Italian, but he so ill-used it that I
  sent a message that it was to be sent back to the yard. They telephoned along
  the river for news of it, and that's when I learnt you were down
  here&mdash;you look rotten.'</p>

  <p>'I feel rotten,' said Mr. Reeder. 'And you came&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I drove down. I had a sort of feeling in my mind that something was
  wrong. Then I met a man who'd seen the builder, and he told me about the
  little old fellow. Until then I didn't know that he was in the boat, and I
  came along to make inquiries. For some reason, which I can't understand, he
  no sooner saw me than he pulled a gun and let fly at me; then he turned and
  went like mad through those bushes.'</p>

  <p>'Have you a gun?' asked Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>Desboyne smiled.</p>

  <p>'No, I don't carry such things.'</p>

  <p>'In that case it would be foolish to pursue my ancient enemy. Let one of
  the Buckingham Constabulary carry on the good work. Is your car anywhere
  handy?'</p>

  <p>There was a road apparently within fifty yards.</p>

  <p>'Good Lord!' said Desboyne suddenly. 'I left it outside the gates of an
  empty house. I wonder whether that's the place where the old boy went&mdash;
  and whether my car is still there?'</p>

  <p>It was there, in the drive of a deserted house: the new car which had so
  excited the disgust of poor Johnny Southers. With some difficulty Clive
  started it up, and the action recalled something to him.</p>

  <p>'Did we leave the engines of the boat running?' he asked suddenly. 'If you
  don't mind I'll go back and turn them off; then I'll notify the police, and
  I'll send a man to bring the <i>Zaira</i> into Maidenhead.'</p>

  <p>He was gone ten minutes. Mr. Reeder had an opportunity of walking round
  the car and admiring it.</p>

  <p>Rain had fallen in the night: he made this interesting discovery before
  Desboyne returned.</p>

  <p>'We'll run up to Marlow and I'll get a man to go down and collect the
  boat,' he said as he climbed in. 'I've never heard anything more amazing.
  Tell me exactly what happened to you.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>'You will pardon me if I do not?' he asked gently. 'The truth is, I have
  been asked by a popular newspaper to write my reminiscences, and I want to
  save every personal experience for that important volume.'</p>

  <p>He would talk about other subjects, however; for example, of the fortunate
  circumstance that Desboyne's car was still there though it was within reach
  of the enemy.</p>

  <p>'I've never met him before. I hope I'll never meet him again,' said
  Desboyne. 'But I think he can be traced. Naturally, I don't want to go into
  court against him. I think it's the most ridiculous experience, to be shot at
  without replying.'</p>

  <p>'Why bother?' asked Mr. Reeder. 'I personally never go into court to
  gratify a private vendetta, though there is a possibility that in the
  immediate future I may break the habit of years!'</p>

  <p>He got down at the boathouse and was a silent listener while Clive
  Desboyne rang up a Twickenham number and described the exact location of the
  boat.</p>

  <p>'They'll collect it,' he said as he hung up. 'Now, Mr. Reeder, what am I
  to do about the police?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder shook his head.</p>

  <p>'I shouldn't report it,' he said. 'They'd never understand.' On the way
  back to London he grew more friendly to Clive Desboyne than he had ever been
  before, and certainly he was more communicative than he had been regarding
  the Attymar murder.</p>

  <p>'You've never seen a murder case at first hand&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And I'm not very anxious to,' interrupted the other.</p>

  <p>'I applaud that sentiment. Young people are much too morbid,' said Mr.
  Reeder. 'But this is a crime particularly interesting, because it was
  obviously planned by one who has studied the art of murder and the methods of
  the average criminal. He had studied it to such good purpose that he was
  satisfied that if a crime of this character were committed by a man of
  intelligence and acumen, he would&mdash;um&mdash;escape the consequence of
  his deed.'</p>

  <p>'And will he?' asked the other, interested.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Mr. Reeder, rubbing his nose. He thought for a long time. 'I
  don't think so. I think he will hang; I am pretty certain he will hang.'</p>

  <p>Another long pause.</p>

  <p>'And yet in a sense he was very clever. For example, he had to attract the
  attention of the policeman on the beat and establish the fact that a murder
  had been committed. He left open the wicket gate on the&mdash;um&mdash;wharf,
  and placed a lantern on the ground and another within the open door of his
  little house, so that the policeman, even if he had been entirely devoid of
  curiosity, could not fail to investigate.'</p>

  <p>Clive Desboyne frowned.</p>

  <p>'Upon my life I don't know who is murdered! It can't be Attymar, because
  you saw him today; and it can't possibly be Ligsey, because, according to
  your statement, he's alive. Why did Johnny Southers go there?'</p>

  <p>'Because he'd been offered a job, a partnership with Attymar. Attymar had
  two or three barges, and with vigorous management it looked as if his
  business might grow into a more important concern. Southers didn't even know
  that this man Attymar was the type of creature he was. An appointment was
  made on the telephone; Southers attended; he interviewed Attymar or somebody
  in the dark, during which time I gather he was sprinkled with
  blood&mdash;whose blood, we shall discover. There was a similar case in
  France in eighteen-forty-seven. Madame Puyères...'</p>

  <p>He gave the history of the Puyères case at length.</p>

  <p>'That was our friend's cleverness, the blood-sprinkling, and the
  lantern-placing: but he made one supreme error. You know the house&mdash;no,
  of course, you've never been there.'</p>

  <p>'Which house?' asked Clive curiously.</p>

  <p>'Attymar's house. It's little more than a weighing shed. You haven't been
  there? No, I see you haven't. If you would like a little lecture, or a little
  demonstration of criminal error, I would like to show you at first-hand.'</p>

  <p>'Will it save Johnny Southers&mdash;this mistake?' asked Desboyne
  curiously.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder nodded.</p>

  <p>'Nothing is more certain. How amazing are the&mdash;um&mdash;vagaries of
  the human mind! How peculiar are the paths into which&mdash;um&mdash;vanity
  leads us!'</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes and seemed to be communing with him self all the way
  through Shepherd's Bush. Desboyne put him down at Scotland Yard, and they
  arranged to meet at the end of Shadwick Lane that same afternoon.</p>

  <p>'There is no further news of Ligsey,' said Gaylor when Reeder came into
  his office.</p>

  <p>'I should have been surprised if there had been,' said Mr. Reeder
  cheerfully, 'partly because he's dead, and partly because&mdash;well, I
  didn't expect any communication from him.'</p>

  <p>'You know he telephoned the Chief last night?'</p>

  <p>'I shouldn't be surprised at that,' said Mr. Reeder, almost
  flippantly.</p>

  <p>They talked about Johnny Southers and the case against him, and of the
  disappointing results of a careful search of the garden. They had dug up
  every bed and had done incalculable damage to Mr. Southers' herbaceous
  borders.</p>

  <p>'Our information was that he had a couple of thousand pounds cached there
  in real money, but we found nothing.'</p>

  <p>'How much was there in the box you discovered in the tool shed?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, only a hundred pounds or so,' said Gaylor. 'The big money was hidden
  in the garden, according to what we were told. We didn't find a penny.'</p>

  <p>'Too bad,' said Mr. Reeder sympathetically. Then, remembering: 'Do you
  mind if I take a young&mdash;um&mdash;friend of mine over Attymar's house
  this afternoon? He's not exactly interested in the crime of wilful murder,
  but as he is providing for the defence of young Mr. Southers&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I don't mind,' said Gaylor, 'but you'd better ask the Chief.'</p>

  <p>The Chief Constable was out, and the opportunity of meeting him was
  rendered more remote when Clive Desboyne rang him up, as he said, on the
  off-chance of getting him at Scotland Yard, and invited him out to lunch.</p>

  <p>'Anna Welford is coming. I've told her you think that Johnny's innocence
  can be established, and she's most anxious to meet you.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder was in something of a predicament but, as usual, he rose to the
  occasion. He instantly cancelled two important engagements, and at lunchtime
  he sat between a delighted girl and a rather exhilarated benefactor. The one
  difficulty he had anticipated did not, however, arise. She had some shopping
  to do that afternoon, so he went alone with Clive Desboyne to what the latter
  described as 'the most gruesome after-lunch entertainment' he had ever
  experienced.</p>

  <p class="first">A CAR dropped them at the end of Shadwick Lane, which had
  already settled down to normality and had grown accustomed to the notoriety
  which the murder had brought to it.</p>

  <p>There was a constable on duty on the wharf, but he was inside the gate.
  Mr. Reeder opened the wicket and Clive Desboyne stepped in. He looked round
  the littered yard with disgust visible on his face.</p>

  <p>'How terribly sordid!' he said. 'I'm not too fastidious, but I can't
  imagine anything more grim and miserable than this.'</p>

  <p>'It was grimmer for the&mdash;um&mdash;gentleman who was killed,' said Mr.
  Reeder.</p>

  <p>He went into the house ahead of his companion, pointed out the room where
  the murder was committed, 'as I feel perfectly sure,' he added; and then led
  the way up the narrow stairs into what had been Captain Attymar's
  sitting-room. 'If you sit at that table you'll see the plan of the house, and
  I may show you one or two very interesting things.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder switched on a handlamp on the table and Clive Desboyne sat
  down, and followed, apparently entranced, the recital of J.G. Reeder's
  theory.</p>

  <p>'If you have time&mdash;what is the time?'</p>

  <p>Clive Desboyne looked up at the ceiling, stared at it for a while.</p>

  <p>'Let me guess,' he said slowly. 'Four o'clock.'</p>

  <p>'Marvellous,' murmured Mr. Reeder. 'It is within one minute. How curious
  you should look up at the ceiling! There used to be a clock there.'</p>

  <p>'In the ceiling?' asked the other incredulously.</p>

  <p>He rose, walked to the window and stared out on to the wharf. From where
  he stood he could see the policeman on duty at the gate. There was nobody
  watching at a little door in the ragged fence which led to Shadwick Passage.
  Suddenly Clive Desboyne pointed to the wharf.</p>

  <p>'That is where the murder was committed,' he said quietly. Mr. Reeder took
  a step towards the window and cautiously craned his neck forward. He did not
  feel the impact of the rubber truncheon that crashed against the base of his
  skull, but went down in a heap.</p>

  <p>Clive Desboyne looked round, walked to the door and listened, then stepped
  out, locked the door, came down the stairs and on to the wharf. The policeman
  eyed him suspiciously, but Mr. Desboyne turned and carried on a conversation
  with the invisible Reeder.</p>

  <p>He strolled round to the front of the house. Nobody saw him open the
  little gate into the passage. The end of Shadwick Lane was barred, but Gaylor
  did not remember the passage until too late. It was he who found Reeder and
  brought him back to consciousness.</p>

  <p>'I deserve that,' said Mr. Reeder when he became articulate. 'Twice in one
  day! I'm getting too old for this work.'</p>

  <p class="first">ONE of those amazing things which so rarely happen, that
  fifty-thousand-to-one-against chance, had materialized, and the high chiefs
  of Scotland Yard grew apoplectic as they asked the why and the wherefore. A
  man wanted by the police on a charge of murder had walked through a most
  elaborate cordon. River police had shut off the waterway; detectives and
  uniform men had formed a circle through which it was impossible to escape;
  yet the wanted man had, by the oddest chance, passed between two detectives
  who had mistaken him for somebody they knew.</p>

  <p>While Reeder was waiting at Scotland Yard he explained in greater detail
  the genesis of his suspicion.</p>

  <p>'The inquiries I made showed me that Attymar was never seen in daylight,
  except by his crew, and then only in the fading light. He had established
  buying agencies in a dozen continental cities, and for years he has been
  engaged in scientific smuggling. But he could only do that if he undertook
  the hardships incidental to a bargemaster's life. He certainly reduced those
  hardships to a minimum for, except to collect the contraband which was dumped
  near his barge, and bring it up to the wharf he had first hired and then
  bought in the early stages of his activity, he spent few nights out of his
  comfortable bed.</p>

  <p>'I was puzzled to account for many curious happenings. If Clive Desboyne
  had not taken the trouble to appear in Brockley at almost the hour at which
  the crime would be discovered&mdash;he knew the time the policeman came down
  Shadwick Lane&mdash;my suspicions might not have been aroused. It was a
  blunder on his part, even in his clever assumption of frankness, to come
  along and tell me the story of what Ligsey had told him; for as soon as the
  crime was discovered and I examined the place, I was absolutely certain that
  Ligsey was dead, or Clive would never have dared to invent the story.</p>

  <p>'Desboyne prides himself on being a clever criminal. Like all criminals
  who have that illusion, he made one or two stupid blunders. When I called at
  his flat I found the walls covered with photographs, some of which showed him
  in costume. It was the first intimation I had that he had been on the stage.
  There was also a photograph of the <i>Zaira</i> when it was going upstream,
  with the House of Commons in the background. Attached by the painter at the
  stern was a small canoe-shaped tender, which had been faithfully described to
  me that day by the boy Hobbs. Desboyne knew he had blundered, but hoped I saw
  no significance in those two photographs, especially the photograph of him
  dressed up as a coster, with the identical make-up that Attymar wore.</p>

  <p>'I started inquiries, and discovered that there was a Clive Desboyne who
  worked in music-halls, giving imitations of popular characters and making
  remarkably quick changes on the stage. I met people who remembered him, some
  who gave me the most intimate details about his beginnings. For ten years he
  had masqueraded as Attymar, sunk all his savings in a barge, rented the wharf
  and house, and eventually purchased it. He is an extraordinary organizer, and
  there is no doubt that in the ten years he's been working he's accumulated a
  pretty large fortune. Nobody, of course, associated the bargemaster with this
  elegant young man who lived in Park Lane.</p>

  <p>'What Ligsey knew about him I don't know. Personally, I believe that
  Ligsey knew very little, and could have told us very little. Attymar
  discovered that Ligsey was communicating with me. Do you remember the letter
  he sent to me? I told you the envelope had been opened&mdash;and so it had,
  probably by "Attymar." From that moment Ligsey was doomed. Clive's vanity was
  such that he thought he could plan a remarkable crime, throw the suspicion on
  the man he hated, and at the same time remove Ligsey, the one danger, from
  his path. I should think that he had been planning Johnny Southers' end for
  about three weeks before the murder. The money that was found in the tool
  house was planted there on the actual night of the murder, while the money in
  the garden&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Money in what garden?' asked Mason. 'The garden was searched but none was
  found.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Reeder coughed. 'At any rate, the money in the tool house was put
  there to support the suspicion. It was clumsily done. The message, the piece
  of paper, the old invoices, as well as the story that Desboyne told me with
  such charming effect were designed with two objects. One was to cover the
  disappearance of Attymar and the other to ruin Southers.</p>

  <p>'But perhaps his cleverest and most audacious trick was the one he
  performed this morning. He had me in his boat; he had been waiting for me;
  probably had watched me from the moment I arrived at Bourne End. Then,
  wearing his fantastic get-up, and jealous to the very last that I should
  suspect him, he planned his scheme for my&mdash;um&mdash;unpleasant exit. I
  give him credit for his resourcefulness. As a quick change artist he has
  probably few equals. He could go on to the bank and deceive the boatbuilder
  from Bourne End. Who could believe that he was a little old man with a humped
  shoulder? He could equally come to my rescue when there was no other way of
  throwing suspicion from himself. Unfortunately for him, I saw not only that
  the car had been in the grounds all night, and that his story of having
  driven down from town was a lie, but&mdash;um&mdash;certain other
  things.'</p>

  <p>The telephone rang, and Mason lifted the receiver.</p>

  <p>'She went out a quarter of an hour ago&mdash;you don't know where?... It
  was Desboyne, was it? She didn't say where she was meeting him?'</p>

  <p>Reeder sighed and rose wearily.</p>

  <p>'Do I understand that Miss Anna Welford has been allowed to leave her
  house?' There was a quality of exasperation in his tone, and Mason could not
  but agree that it was justified. For the first request that Reeder had made,
  and that by telephone from Rotherhithe, was that a special guard should be
  put over Anna Welford. Certain of Mason's local subordinates, however,
  thought that the least likely thing that could happen would be that Desboyne
  would come into the neighbourhood, and here they were right. Matters had been
  further complicated by the fact that the girl had gone out that day, and was
  still out when the police officers called. She had rung up, however, a moment
  before Desboyne had telephoned, and had given her number, which was
  transferred to him. Later, when she was called up at the address she had
  given, it was discovered that she had gone out to meet him; nobody knew
  where.</p>

  <p>'So really,' said Gaylor, 'nobody is to blame.'</p>

  <p>'Nobody ever is!' snapped Mr. Reeder.</p>

  <p>It was Clive Desboyne's conceit that he should arrange to meet the girl at
  the corner of the Thames Embankment, within fifty yards of Scotland Yard.
  When she arrived in some hurry, she saw nothing that would suggest that
  anything unusual had happened, except the good news he had passed to her over
  the telephone.</p>

  <p>'Where's Johnny?' she asked, almost before she was within talking
  distance, and he was amused.</p>

  <p>'I really ought to be very jealous.'</p>

  <p>He called a taxi as he spoke, and ordered the man to drive him to an
  address in Chiswick.</p>

  <p>'Reeder hasn't been on to you, of course? I'm glad&mdash;I wanted to be
  the first to tell you.'</p>

  <p>'Is he released?' she asked, a little impatiently.</p>

  <p>'He will be released this evening. I think that is best. The authorities
  are very chary of demonstrations, and Scotland Yard have particularly asked
  that he should give no newspaper interviews, but should spend the night, if
  possible, out of town. I've arranged with my cousin that he shall stay at his
  place till tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>It all seemed very feasible, and when of his own accord he stopped the cab
  and, getting out to telephone, returned to tell her that he had phoned her
  father that she would not be back before eight, the thought of his
  disinterestedness aroused a warm glow of friendship towards him.</p>

  <p>'I've been besieged by reporters myself, and I'm rather anxious to avoid
  them. These damned papers will do anything for a sensation.'</p>

  <p>The swift express van of one of these offending newspapers passed the taxi
  at that moment. On its back doors was pasted a placard.</p>

  <p class="sign">ALLEGED MURDERER'S DARING ESCAPE</p>

  <p>Later the girl saw another newspaper poster.</p>

  <p class="sign">POLICE OF METROPOLIS SEARCHING FOR MURDERER</p>

  <p>The taxi drove up a side street and, as he tapped on the window, stopped.
  There was a garage a little further along and, leaving Anna, he went inside
  and came out in a few moments with a small car.</p>

  <p>'I keep this here in case of emergency,' he explained to her. 'One never
  knows when one might need a spare car.'</p>

  <p>Exactly why he should need a spare car in Chiswick he did not attempt to
  explain.</p>

  <p>Avoiding the Great West Road, he took the longer route through Brentford.
  Rain was falling heavily by the time they reached Hounslow.</p>

  <p>She was so grateful to him for all he had done that she did not resist his
  suggestion that they should go on to Oxford. She wondered why until they were
  on the outskirts of the town, and then he explained with a smile that Johnny
  had been transferred to Oxford Gaol that morning.</p>

  <p>'I kept this as a surprise for you,' he said. 'Only about three people in
  London know, and I was most anxious that you shouldn't tell.'</p>

  <p>They went into a café on the other side of the city, and she was puzzled
  why he should prefer this rather poverty-stricken little place to an hotel,
  but thought it was an act of consideration on his part&mdash;part of the
  general scheme for avoiding reporters. They lingered over tea until she grew
  a little restless.</p>

  <p>'We'll go to the prison and make inquiries,' he told her.</p>

  <p>Actually they did go to the prison, and he descended and rang the bell.
  When he came back he was grinning ruefully.</p>

  <p>'He was released half an hour ago. My cousin's car picked him up. We can
  go on.'</p>

  <p>It was getting dark now and the rain continued to fail steadily. They took
  another route towards London, passed through a little town which she thought
  she recognized as Marlow, turned abruptly from the main road, and as abruptly
  again up a dark and neglected carriage drive. She had a glimpse of the sheen
  of a stagnant backwater on her left, and then the car drew up before a
  forbidding looking door and, stepping down, Clive Desboyne opened the door
  with his key.</p>

  <p>'Here we are,' he said pleasantly and, before she realized what had
  happened, she was in a gloomy hall smelling of damp and decay.</p>

  <p>The door thundered close behind her.</p>

  <p>'Where are we? This isn't the place,' she said tremulously, and at that
  moment all her old suspicions, all her old fears of the man returned.</p>

  <p>'It is quite the place,' he said.</p>

  <p>From the pocket of his raincoat he took a torch and switched it on. The
  house was furnished, if rotting carpets and dust-covered chairs meant
  anything. He held her firmly by the arm, walked her along the passage then,
  opening a door, pushed her inside. She thought there was no window, but found
  afterwards that it was shuttered.</p>

  <p>The room was fairly clean; there was a bed, a table and a small oil stove.
  On a sideboard were a number of packets of foodstuffs.</p>

  <p>'Keep quiet and don't make a fuss,' he said.</p>

  <p>Striking a match, he lit a paraffin lamp that stood on the table.</p>

  <p>What does this mean?' she asked. Her face was white and haggard.</p>

  <p>He did not answer immediately, and then: 'I'm very fond of
  you&mdash;that's what it means. I shall probably be hanged in about six
  weeks' time, and there's a wise old saying that you might as well be hanged
  for a sheep as for a lamb. You for the moment are the lamb.'</p>

  <p>The bright, shining eyes were fixed on hers. She almost fainted with
  horror.</p>

  <p>'That doesn't mean I'm going to murder you or cut your throat or do any of
  the things I tried to do to Mr. Reeder this morning&mdash;oh, yes, I was the
  fantastical gentleman on the <i>Zaira</i>. The whole thing happened a few
  yards away from where you're standing. Now, Anna, you're going to be very
  sensible, my sweet&mdash;there's nobody within five miles of here who is at
  all concerned&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The hinges of the door were rusty: they squeaked when it was moved. They
  squeaked now. Clive Desboyne turned in a flash, fumbling under mackintosh and
  coat.</p>

  <p>'Don't move,' said Mr. Reeder gently. It was his conventional admonition.
  'And put up your hands. I shall certainly shoot if you do not. You're a
  murderer&mdash;I could forgive you that. You're a liar&mdash;that, to a man
  of my high moral code, is unpardonable.' The dozen detectives who had been
  waiting for three hours in this dank house came crowding into the room, and
  snapped irons on the wrists of the white-faced man.</p><a id="pic11a"

  <h3>ABOUT THIS RED-ROBED VILLAIN</h3>

  <p class="first">PRESUMING you have already perused the long complete story
  in this issue of The <span class="smcap">thriller</span>, I venture to
  suggest you have never read anything more exciting from the pen at Edgar
  Wallace, the most popular author of mystery stories. True, you have had to
  wait a few weeks for this latest adventure of Mr. Reeder, but I feel sure you
  will agree that patience has brought its own reward.</p>

  <p>'The Crook in Crimson' is a typical Edgar Wallace yarn. It provides full
  measure of drama, thrill, mystery and humour of a kind unique to the
  ingenuity and personality of the Master of Mystery. Only Edgar Wallace could
  have produced the amazing adventures of J.G. Reeder in search of 'The Crook
  In Crimson,' just as only Leslie Charteris could have told 'The Story of a
  Dead Man', or Hugh Clevely produced 'Lynch Law.'</p>

  <p>So we must add this week's gripping story to the many successes of both
  its talented author and The <span class="smcap">thriller</span>. This is the
  third novel especially contributed to this paper by Mr. Wallace. There is no
  denying that to place in your hands a novel-length story by the premier
  thriller author of the day, at the cost of twopence, is an achievement never
  previously considered possible. We are proud of what we have done. Proud,
  too, of the gigantic circulation by which you have shown your
  appreciation.</p>

  <p>It will interest you to know that the manuscript of 'The Crook in Crimson'
  came to hand when No. 7 of The <span class="smcap">thriller</span> was about
  to be printed. Regardless of cost incurred by the re-arrangement,
  necessitating the holding up of printing machines and rush-work for all
  concerned, everything was put aside in order to put Edgar Wallace's latest
  story in your hands at the earliest possible date.</p>

  <p>We now await the word from Mr.. Wallace that another story for this paper
  is being prepared. You will understand that the preparation of a novel takes
  time, and requires much careful thought and construction, until it gives
  complete satisfaction. However, it is hoped that definite news will come
  along soon.</p>

  <p>In launching <i>The Thriller</i>, our project was highly ambitious, but I
  believe we have already proved to you that stories of the highest standard
  can be maintained week by week. An exceptionally large number of letters have
  come to hand asking for more stories like 'The Croucher' in last week's
  issue. I was so confident that the long complete novel by Gwyn Evans would be
  enthusiastically received, that I promptly commissioned further stories from
  him.</p>

  <p>Next week you will enjoy 'The Silent Six,' a splendid story by T. Arthur
  Plummer. This author is already recognised as a leader In the world of
  thriller fiction, and I have not the slightest hesitancy in presenting his
  work to you as first-rate thriller fiction. It is bound to please you, so
  make it the foremost thought of the week not to miss reading 'The Silent
  Six.'</p>

  <p>In the meantime, don't forget to keep a sharp look-out for announcements
  of future stories by Edgar Wallace and other star authors. Every effort has
  been made to keep <i>The Thriller</i> on the up note of quality, and you may
  rest assured that this standard will be maintained, because I have a stock of
  stories in hand, every one of which I can guarantee first-class
  thrillers.</p>

  <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
