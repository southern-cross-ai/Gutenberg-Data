  <h2><a id="story01"
     name="story01">1. "NIG-NOG!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">This story is about a matter which, in itself, is ancient
  history. It is only told now because Mr. Cymbeline Smith (his real name is
  something which is almost as outrageous) has placed himself under a
  fifty-thousand dollar bond that he will not "associate in any way whatsoever"
  his name or his preparation with those which occur in this story, "providing
  a genteel account of the aforesaid affair be put into writing by a newspaper
  man." This is that genteel account.</p>

  <p>Cymbeline Smith is an American citizen who made a deal of money in the
  traveling circus business before he took up the serious study of medicines.
  It had been an asset of his that he might have stood as a model for any
  artist who desired to draw Uncle Sam. He had a long, somewhat dissatisfied
  face, a fringe of amber and gray whisker at his chin, he always wore a top
  hat of antique shape and trousers which were strapped under Wellington boots.
  In the circus days he affected a blue cut-away swallowtail and a high stock,
  but these he abandoned when he gave his mind and money to medical science,
  and produced in conjunction with a drummer (who afterwards drank himself to
  death) the preparation which is known commercially as "Nig-Nog!" I have
  little space to dilate upon the pharmaceutical values of "Nig-Nog!" You have
  read the full page and the double page ads., and you know (or you disbelieve)
  that "Nig-Nog!" cures all nervous ailments, builds up nerve forces, clears
  the dazed and dopey brain, and restores to its vie&mdash;, to its grateful
  and delighted purchaser that roseate outlook upon life, that balance of
  reason, that clarity of vision which the brainworker, the cigarette-fiend,
  and the chronic pessimist cannot enjoy.</p>

  <p>It was described as being compounded from a prescription which had been in
  the family of a Royal House of Europe for five hundred years, but this may
  not have been true. Now it is a fact that an advertised patent medicine which
  does not produce most of the results it claims brings ruin to its proprietor,
  for it costs more money to put the first supplies on the market than it is
  humanly possible to get back even if every bottle is sold. But "Nig-Nog!" was
  a success from the beginning. It sold in the United States of America by the
  million. It did build up nerve forces and clear the dazed and dopey brain. It
  did restore the balance of reason and the clarity of vision. And its
  delighted patrons told other sufferers that "Nig-Nog!" was according to
  specification, and in consequence Cymbeline Smith grew rich and lived in a
  suite at Knickerbocker House and drove a machine which was something between
  Cinderella's Fancy Coach and a Band Wagon.</p>

  <p>And then he crossed the waters to conquer Europe. He flooded the London
  market with "Nig-Nog!"; he added a new tone to the English landscape; in car
  and train, on omnibus, on house-side, in druggist window, in printed page he
  spoke earnestly, violently, almost convincingly of "Nig-Nog!"&mdash;its
  virtues, its amazing qualities, and, still more, amazing cheapness.</p>

  <p>And then he did that which of all things was unpardonable. Overlooking the
  weald of Sussex was a long and wooded ridge, and at its highest point was
  Weald Lodge, the country home of the Rt. Hon. Gregory Thessiger, Minister of
  Ordnance, an irritable, intolerant man who had a mild dislike for most
  Americans and a violent dislike for that type of American which Cymbeline
  Smith represented. Because he was a great man and people trembled at his nod,
  and because he was almost godlike to the villagers of Adfriston, he had never
  seriously considered the building possibility of the nine-acre lot which lay
  on the slope of the hill between his estate and the village. He woke one
  morning to discover that Mr. Cymbeline Smith had purchased that "estate"
  through a soulless agent at Eastbourne.</p>

  <p>To say that Mr. Thessiger was annoyed, was to put the matter with amusing
  moderation. He endeavored to cancel the sale. He offered to buy the ground,
  but Cymbeline Smith was first and foremost a showman, and the thought that he
  was to be a neighbor of the powerful Minister of a most powerful British
  Cabinet was not wholly abhorrent to him. So he built a dwelling which was a
  tactful compromise between the White House and the Tower of London, thus
  reconciling in one spasm of architecture the ideals of the new and the old
  world. But the culminating point of his infamy came when he took possession
  and added his final improvement.</p>

  <p>The newspaper reporters who saw Mr. Thessiger step from his car at the
  door of the Treasury reported him as looking ill and worried, and drew
  conclusions which were wholly erroneous. The Prime Minister also noted the
  haggard face of his colleague, and his conclusions were almost as wide of the
  mark as the reporters'.</p>

  <p>He walked across to where the Minister sat, and dropped his hand upon his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I think you are worrying too much about this business, Thessiger," he
  said; "the outlook is not as bad this morning as it was. I think Baremia will
  climb down."</p>

  <p>Thessiger looked up.</p>

  <p>"It's not that, Prime Minister," he said irritably; "It's that infernal
  Yankee! Confound his impertinence!"</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister was secretly relieved. He had heard about the infernal
  Yankee before.</p>

  <p>"Is his castle finished!" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Finished!" spluttered the other. "Do you know what the rascal has done?
  On the roof of his house, sir, right under my nose so that I cannot miss it,
  he has had an electric sign put up: 'NIG-NOG FOR THE NERVES.' It is
  illuminated at night. He has made it impossible for me to live in my own
  house. By-heavens, I'll sue him!"</p>

  <p>"An electric sign?" said the Premier; "but surely he will take it down if
  you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Ask!" roared the other. "I have demanded, I have pleaded&mdash;I didn't
  go myself, of course, but I sent Grey, my man; but the scoundrel says it is
  good advertising, for it can be read from the trains six miles away.
  'Nig-Nog!' for the nerves," he repeated, grinding his teeth. "Good heavens,
  if I had only known that he was coming!"</p>

  <p>"Why not sue him in the court? He seems to be a nuisance within the
  meaning of the Act," said the Prime Minister soothingly.</p>

  <p>It was very necessary that he should calm his violent colleague, for
  certain matters were coming up for consideration which called for Thessiger's
  support on a measure to which, as the Prime Minister knew, the Minister of
  Ordnance was bitterly opposed. His worst fears were realized when that
  measure was brought forward. If Thessiger had been violent at previous
  sittings of the Cabinet, he was now wholly unmanageable; and the Prime
  Minister walked down to the House of Commons with the Minister of
  Finance.</p>

  <p>"Thessiger is going to make a split," he said moodily, "and at a time when
  we all ought to stand together and drop petty differences. I'd hate to lose
  him, but he has things all wrong. He doesn't seem to realize Baremia's
  object. I wish this infernal American had not come to bother him. He was
  unmanageable enough without that added cause of irritation. You are a suave
  sort of devil, Ralph," he said suddenly. "Why don't you go to this 'Nig-Nog!'
  man and see if you couldn't persuade him to drop his electric sign?"</p>

  <p>The other laughed.</p>

  <p>"One has to be a very suave kind of devil," he repeated, "to persuade a
  patent medicine advertiser to surrender a good position. My acquaintance with
  the press, which is fairly extensive, does not encourage me to believe that
  Mr. Smith is amenable to reason, but I will try if you like."</p>

  <p>So Cymbeline Smith, sitting on his broad verandah, with his red-slippered
  feet elevated to the rail and with a long cigar between his strong white
  teeth, had a visitor.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's very good of you," said Cymbeline, who had reached that point
  of prosperity where he accepted the unexpected visits of Cabinet Ministers as
  an ordinary event of life. "I would like to oblige Mr. Thessiger, Sir Ralph,
  but I am a business man. I am, sir," he went on in his finest oracular style,
  "not only a business man, but a humanitarian, a benefactor of the human race,
  a man to whom the sufferings of his fellow-creatures is a clarion call to
  duty.</p>

  <p>It is my opinion, sir, and it is the opinion shared by the faculty of the
  United States of America, that there is no more pernicious act that a man can
  permit than to deny to a suffering world a knowledge of this sovereign
  remedy. 'Nig-Nog!', sir, may be found in the medicine chests of royal and
  imperial personages. It may be seen, a bright and pleasant sight, on the
  shelves of the humblest cottages. Until that miraculous compound, which is at
  once a prophylactic, a refreshment, and a cure which secures the palingenesis
  of the atrophied nerve centers and the reintegration of the frazzled brain,
  is known to every man, woman, and child of your ancient country, I cannot,
  without reproaching myself with my treachery to humanity, relax in the
  slightest degree my effort to bring 'Nig-Nog!' to the notice of the
  world."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Mr. Smith," said Sir Ralph smoothly, "surely it would serve
  your purpose if the electric sign were placed at our expense nearer to the
  railway line."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cymbeline Smith shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," he said, "the very remoteness of these golden words twinkling
  against the dark and mysterious background of the immemorial hills produces
  in the mind of the sufferer the impression of hope&mdash;for hope, sir, is a
  distant prospect. Hope, sir, is the Uranus of the psychological sky."</p>

  <p>That night Mr. Thessiger was sitting at his desk in the big library of his
  house in Chepstowe Place. To be exact, he alternated between the table and
  the fireplace, for he had half written six letters of resignation which had
  been consigned to the flames, and the seventh had been begun when his butler
  came in, closing the door discreetly behind him.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Carter?" asked the Minister, looking up.</p>

  <p>"The Countess Castlavera. She wishes to see you on a very important
  matter."</p>

  <p>A look of surprise came to Mr. Thessiger's face and he pulled out his
  watch. It was nine o 'clock.</p>

  <p>"Ask the Countess to come in, please, Carter."</p>

  <p>He half crossed the room to meet the beautiful woman who was ushered in by
  the butler.</p>

  <p>"My dear Countess," he said, "this is a great surprise and a great
  pleasure."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you are fearfully busy," she said, with a quick glance at the
  table. "What curious blotting paper you use!"</p>

  <p>He smiled as he pulled forward a chair for his visitor.</p>

  <p>"A11 Ministers use black blotting paper," he said; "It tells no
  stories."</p>

  <p>"And you have so many secrets to hide&mdash;what a wonderful thing it is
  to be a Minister!"</p>

  <p>The envy and admiration in her tone was particularly flattering to this
  lonely man, and, indeed, his friendship with the Countess, which had begun in
  a small Algerian hotel where they had found themselves in the most
  unfashionable season of the year, the only people of consequence amongst the
  guests, had been a source of the greatest comfort to him.</p>

  <p>They had met in Paris once, and then the Countess, who was a widow, had
  come to London and had established her little salon in Curzon Street, and Mr.
  Thessiger had been an occasional visitor. That she was a fascinating woman is
  well enough known. Absurdly young for a widow, her eyes had that quality of
  blue which is found only in the eastern skies at sunset. They were that rich,
  cloudy blue that particularly appealed to him. Her hair he had likened in his
  one poetical indiscretion to "a mane of daffodils." Her mouth was small and
  delicately shaped&mdash;her chin, her poise, her air, were all adequately
  described in that "Memory of Algiers" published in the <i>Saturday Review</i>
  over the initial "T," the authorship of which was ascribed by none to the
  somewhat forbidding Minister of Ordnance.</p>

  <p>"I have come to see you on rather an important matter," she smiled, "and
  it is because I know I can trust you that I have come at all."</p>

  <p>He inclined his head, at once gratified and curious.</p>

  <p>For the moment all thought of the Cabinet crisis, of the grave issues
  which were pending in the country, even of the exasperating vendor of patent
  medicines vanished from his mind, and his attention was concentrated upon
  this fragrant, delicate thing who already occupied too large a portion of his
  thoughts for his comfort.</p>

  <p>"My late husband was, as you know, the agent for an armament firm. He had
  invented a wonderful howitzer&mdash;that is the word?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Thessiger nodded.</p>

  <p>"And most of the specifications were deposited in a Paris bank. The very
  secret parts of the gun he confided to me; they were never put on paper."</p>

  <p>Mr. Thessiger raised his eyebrows in surprise.</p>

  <p>"A somewhat complicated thing to remember, my dear Countess."</p>

  <p>She smiled a little sadly.</p>

  <p>"And yet by memorizing day after day I had the whole particulars here,"
  she tapped her forehead, "except one, and that has escaped me. I am anxious
  to sell the gun to a certain government&mdash;you need have no fear, it is a
  government very friendly to yours," she laughed, "and I have recalled
  everything except the exact mixture in the recoil cylinders."</p>

  <p>Mr. Thessiger shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot help you," he said.</p>

  <p>"You can," she said emphatically; "if I were to see another gun, I am sure
  it would all come back to me. I mean, if I saw it in the process of making;
  and I want you to help me to this extent, that you give me a permit to visit
  one of your great gun factories."</p>

  <p>The minister made no reply. It was rather a delicate position. The big gun
  factory, and particularly that section in which the recoils were made, was
  inaccessible to the general public.</p>

  <p>"I cannot answer you straight away," he said. "I do not know what
  objections there are."</p>

  <p>In this he did not speak the truth, for there were many objections. For
  example, the new 9:6 was in process of creation, and it would be impossible
  for a visitor with any knowledge of guns to overlook this fact. She seemed to
  divine what was going on in his mind, for she said quickly:</p>

  <p>"Please understand that I know nothing of guns, and that my technical
  knowledge is confined to just one tiny bit of their construction."</p>

  <p>"I cannot give you permission yet. I will let you know in the morning,"
  said Mr. Thessiger; and in a few minutes the conversation had drifted off
  into more conventional channels, and the Minister was listening with an
  inward purr of satisfaction to divers things which had been expressed about
  his genius, all of which views were conveyed to him in the most subtle
  fashion.</p>

  <p>She left him with a sense of longing and an additional feeling of
  irritation. He slept badly, and in the morning he decided upon his line of
  action. Incidentally he had decided that there was no valid objection to
  issuing the permit which the Countess had asked for. He would only be another
  few days in the Cabinet and he might at least utilize his power to grant her
  that favor.</p>

  <p>As for the other matter, he would oppose the breach with Baremia&mdash;for
  that was what the new Defense Bill would involve.</p>

  <p>On that he was determined. He knew that his opposition to the Government
  would split the Cabinet, for he had enjoyed something of a following in the
  House, sufficient at any rate to turn the scales against the Government. Once
  resolved, every hour brought a new argument, which justified to himself the
  attitude he had adopted. Baremia was bluffing. War was incredible, and being
  incredible was impossible. Before lunch he had worked himself up to a
  condition of smouldering anger against his colleagues. To make matters worse,
  a tactless member of the Cabinet called upon him before the House sat to urge
  a point of view which could only be described as crassly ignorant.</p>

  <p>As the day advanced he grew more and more irritable, more and more
  unbearable. He snapped and snarled at his secretaries, he declined
  point-blank to attend the extraordinary meeting of the Cabinet which was
  summoned for two o'clock, and refused with equal vehemence a luncheon party
  with the Prime Minister. He walked down to the House that afternoon, a raw
  man all on edge.</p>

  <p>To his alarm he found the hand he put up to return the salute of a passing
  acquaintance was shaking, and turned into a druggist's shop. The man behind
  the counter knew him.</p>

  <p>"I want something to steady me, Mr. Bolsover," said the Minister. "I am a
  little nervy."</p>

  <p>"I think I know the very thing," said the man. He went behind the little
  partition and presently came out with a glass containing a white mixture that
  fizzed and spluttered.</p>

  <p>"Drink this quickly," he said, and Mr. Thessiger, with a growl at doing
  anything he was told, drank the mixture.</p>

  <p>"It's not very unpleasant to take," he said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," smiled the chemist, "It is rather palatable. We have a great
  demand for that particular medicine. It has really a marvelous effect upon
  the jaded nerves."</p>

  <p>"Is it your own prescription?"</p>

  <p>The chemist shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I wish it were. I should be a rich man," he laughed. "As a rule I do not
  recommend proprietary drugs, but this is out of the ordinary. It is called
  'Nig- Nog'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is called what?" roared Mr. Thessiger.</p>

  <p>"'Nig-Nog,' sir."</p>

  <p>"If I had known that!" said the Minister between his teeth. "If I had only
  known that!"</p>

  <p>He turned quickly and walked from the store boiling with rage. This was
  the last straw.</p>

  <p>The House was crowded, but the Ministerial bench was empty. Ministers had
  gathered in the Premier's room, and they were not happy.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen," said the Prime Minister at last. He stood balancing
  himself upon the stone fireguard, his hands behind him and his big, harsh
  mouth curved in a little smile. "I think we must reconcile ourselves to going
  out&mdash; that doesn't matter so much. What does matter is the fact that we
  are likely to land this country in a pretty unholy mess."</p>

  <p>"Don't say 'we,' " said Ralph Yerne grimly; "say Thessiger."</p>

  <p>"He is wholly impossible," said the stout and florid Minister of the
  Interior. "I went to him, my dear Prime Minister, with arguments which were
  absolutely unanswerable, and he had the audacity to tell me to go to the
  devil, sir! I have never been so insulted in my life."</p>

  <p>"I don't think arguments are much good for Thessiger," said the Prime
  Minister, regarding the ceiling with minute interest. "He is determined to
  oppose our measures of National Defense, and there is an end to it."</p>

  <p>"What I can't understand," said Sir Ralph, "is that an intelligent man
  like Thessiger runs around with that infernal Castlavera woman. Everybody
  knows she is an agent of The Big Embassy, and I have tried in a delicate way
  to hint as much. She is a very dangerous woman, particularly when one knows
  that The Big Embassy have been trying to get some particulars of our new 9:6
  guns. Thessiger is in a position to supply the information."</p>

  <p>"Thessiger is not a fool," said the Prime Minister. "He is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At that moment the door opened and Thessiger came in. The Prime Minister
  looked at him and gasped. For the first time in his life, Thessiger's unhappy
  face was wreathed in smiles and he chuckled as he entered.</p>

  <p>He nodded round genially.</p>

  <p>"Had a most amusing experience," he said, and laughed again. "You remember
  that infernal American?"</p>

  <p>"The 'Nig-Nog' man?" said the Prime Minister, relieved to find that his
  colleague was capable of taking a cheerful view of anything.</p>

  <p>"The 'Nig-Nog' man," said Thessiger. "Do you know that ten minutes ago I
  was inveigled into drinking some of his noxious preparation. The joke is on
  me with a vengeance," he laughed this time with rare heartiness, and they
  stared at him. "I have been thinking things over on my way up. Prime
  Minister," he went on, "and I believe I have taken rather a narrow view of
  your proposal, in fact I do not think I have been very normal lately. How do
  you do. Coulter?" he waved a cheerful hand to the astounded Minister of the
  Interior. "No," he went on, "I am going to support that measure of yours. I
  think it is a very wise and very sound measure. One has to look at things
  clearly and drop the purely personal view."</p>

  <p>"I am delighted " began the Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit, sir," said the jovial Thessiger; "but the 'Nig-Nog' story is
  quite a good one, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>He strolled out of the room humming a tune and entered his own private
  bureau, crossed to the desk, and pressed a bell-push. His chief clerk entered
  a little apprehensively.</p>

  <p>"Oh, by the way," said Thessiger, "that pass I issued to the Countess
  Castlavera, has it been sent?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, not yet," said the clerk quickly; "but I will send it by special
  messenger. I am very sorry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"0h, don't bother about it," said Thessiger. "You can cancel it. Perhaps
  it was rather indiscreet to issue a pass of that character. And&mdash;wait,
  please," the clerk was at the door and turned back; "send down to the
  druggist and get me a dozen packages of&mdash;er&mdash;'Nig-Nog' I think they
  call it."</p>

  <p>"Which druggist, sir?"</p>

  <p>"They sell it everywhere," said Thessiger. "Surely you have heard of 'Nig-
  Nog'!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"The speech of the Minister of Ordnance," wrote the leader writer of
  <i>The Times</i>, "was a masterpiece of constructive eloquence, though it is
  not wholly clear what the Right Honorable gentleman meant when he referred to
  the Defensive Bill as being a dose of 'Nig-Nog' for nerve-shattered
  Europe..."</p>

  <p>If the readers of The Times did not understand, Mr. Cymbeline Smith
  grasped the allusion with remarkable rapidity, and was only prevented from
  adding this wonderful testimonial to the already inflated list by the
  eloquent persuasion of a combined Cabinet and a promise which I have
  endeavored to fulfill.</p>

  <h2><a id="story02"
     name="story02">2. JIMMY'S BROTHER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I feel I should like to know Jimmy's brother. I picture him
  not unlike Jimmy, though leaner and a thought more wiry, with an air of
  profound profundity and wisdom, and the softest of Scotch accents which need
  not be reproduced.</p>

  <p>I fancy, too, that the whole of his regiment must be wiry, solemn men,
  either possessed of a sense of humor and jealousy concerted or else void
  entirely of that virtue and most earnest in their several contemplations of
  things.</p>

  <p>Jimmy himself gives you the impression that he is forever on the verge of
  laughter, yet is repressing that natural and proper desire lest he waste
  valuable time which might be employed in telling you a good story.</p>

  <p>He has a flat in town, somewhere in the Temple I should imagine, for just
  as ballast is counter to buoyancy and even balloons are associated with
  sandbags, so does the joyous heart seek for bleakness of habitation.</p>

  <p>Jimmy's brother is, as I say, very serious, as all young Scotsmen are, and
  looks upon life with solemn eyes, conscious of the beauties of vision and at
  the same time apprehending all the wastage of its undeveloped natural
  resources.</p>

  <p>He is such a man as would stand speechless before the glories of Niagara
  Falls, frozen solid in a bitter winter, and would make rapid calculations as
  to the amount of ice that could be cut, the cost of its transportation, and
  its profit when delivered c.i.f. New York.</p>

  <p>He is like all earnest men, a soldier, paying fleeting visits to town,
  where he discusses the army in a way which would make the scant hair of the
  high command rise up like little anti-aircraft guns pointing menacingly to
  the heavens.</p>

  <p>Jimmy got a phone message the other day and recognized the voice of his
  brother.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to come round and see you on a very important matter," said the
  voice, and Jimmy said, "Come along," albeit cautiously, being prepared for
  the worst.</p>

  <p>Jimmy would never be surprised if his brother came to his flat leading an
  elephant that he had found wandering about, for he was notoriously fond of
  animals, and, indeed, the request which the brother had to make when he
  eventually arrived was startling enough.</p>

  <p>Jimmy's brother, burnt of face and wearing the soiled khaki of a blameless
  life, came into Jimmy's office.</p>

  <p>"And where the devil do you come from!" asked Jimmy in his most elderly
  brotherly tone.</p>

  <p>A man, a wicked soldier, had gone on leave and spent many days beyond
  those specified on Army Form B.260 in riotous and possibly licentious living,
  and he had been arrested by an unsympathetic constabulary in the act of
  giving a gratuitous display of bomb-throwing, the improvised grenade being a
  quart pot, and the entrenched enemy being a somewhat terrified landlord
  crouching behind the counter. Therefore, Jimmy's brother had been sent up
  "with a lance- corporal to bring the criminal back to judgment.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Jimmy, on guard.</p>

  <p>"Well," repeated Jimmy's brother, impressive to the last degree. "We have
  got him in London, but we were allowed three days to bring him from Liverpool
  to the camp, and we have done it in one."</p>

  <p>He paused as though expecting Jimmy to read into this bald and uninspiring
  statement all that was in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Well" said Jimmy again. "I suppose you are taking him back to camp?"</p>

  <p>"We were allowed three days, and we have done it in one," said Jimmy's
  brother deliberately, "which means we have two days to spare, and we don't
  get many spare days in Kitchener 's army; so we have decided to stay in
  town."</p>

  <p>"But," protested Jimmy, the horrible truth dawning upon him slowly, "what
  is going to happen to the prisoner!"</p>

  <p>"That's just it," said Jimmy's brother. "We have got to do something with
  him." He leant across the table and... "Do you mind looking after him for a
  couple of days?" he asked, with the nonchalance of one who was demanding a
  light for a cigar.</p>

  <p>Jimmy gasped and said many things which he probably regretted at a later
  stage, but he told his relative where he would see him before he took charge
  of this youthful delinquent.</p>

  <p>"He is quite a nice chap," protested Jimmy's brother, "when he's sober.
  Keep him away from the drink. He'll do little jobs around the house." He grew
  enthusiastic. "He cleans silver," he said suggestively.</p>

  <p>But Jimmy would have none of it, for he had no silver that required
  cleaning.</p>

  <p>"Where is your prisoner, now!" he said.</p>

  <p>"He's with the corporal," parried Jimmy's brother.</p>

  <p>"But where f" insisted Jimmy.</p>

  <p>"They're at a picture palace in Regent Street," pleaded this emissary of
  the crown. "Be a sport and lend us your coal cellar for a couple of
  days."</p>

  <p>But Jimmy was adamant, nor was another friend whom Jimmy's brother was
  able to beat up any more willing, though it was discovered, in the course of
  skillful cross-examination conducted by Jimmy's brother, that the friend had
  an available bathroom.</p>

  <p>"What do you want a bathroom for?" urged the young military gentleman
  passionately.</p>

  <p>"To keep my coals in," said the other sardonically.</p>

  <p>Eventually Jimmy's brother went down disconsolate, and spent the whole
  afternoon searching for his prisoner and his superior officer, the two having
  left the picture palace before he arrived. They were eventually run to earth
  in a music hall near Piccadilly Circus, and the imprisonment difficulty was
  got over by taking a couple of rooms in a small temperance hotel in
  Bloomsbury, the prisoner being locked in one, and his two comrades occupying
  the other.</p>

  <p>The next morning the prisoner protested.</p>

  <p>"A11 the time I am away from the regiment," he said truculently, "I am
  losing my pay. I want to go back to camp at once."</p>

  <p>"You shut up," said Jimmy's brother.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you any sense of decency?" demanded the corporal.</p>

  <p>"We are going round sight-seeing," explained Jimmy's brother, "and if you
  behave yourself you can come along, but you will have to pay your own bus
  fares."</p>

  <p>Whereupon the prisoner broke into such a wealth of vile and violent
  language that they compromised on the question of fares.</p>

  <p>Jimmy's brother is a sentimentalist. No less was the corporal, for I
  gather that they were both Scots.</p>

  <p>They found a great tenderness of mind in the vast spaces of St. Paul's
  Cathedral, though the prisoner, who was a southerner, could do no more than
  stand with a cynical sneer on his lips, passing remarks about statues and
  tombs, sarcastic and uncalled for.</p>

  <p>It was in the crypt that the man's baseness was finally revealed. Before
  the grave of Nelson stood Jimmy's brother and the lance-corporal,
  reverent&mdash;almost liquid in their emotions. Jimmy's brother stretched out
  his hand and laid it upon the tomb of the great admiral.</p>

  <p>"Nelson," he murmured, and repeated his oath of allegiance right down to
  "So help me!" and the corporal, quivering with emotion, followed suit.</p>

  <p>They turned to the prisoner. "This is Nelson's tomb," murmured Jimmy's
  brother urgently.</p>

  <p>"To hell with Nelson!" snarled the prisoner. "I'm losing a bob a day!"</p>

  <p>So they took him back to camp that very day.</p>

  <p>"You don't deserve a holiday," said Jimmy's brother severely.</p>

  <p>"An' I don't want one," said the prisoner, "not unless you make it worth
  me while."</p>

  <p>"Men like you ruin the army," said the lance-corporal.</p>

  <p>They were still wrangling when the train drew out of the station, leaving
  Jimmy with tears in his eyes. Yet he was not unhappy.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story03"
     name="story03">3. SENTIMENTAL SIMPSON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">According to certain signs, the Amateur Detective thought
  his French window had been forced by a left-handed man who wore square-toed
  boots, the muddy print of the latter against the enamel of the door seemed to
  prove this beyond doubt. The direction of the knife-cuts in the putty about
  the window- glass supported the left-handed view.</p>

  <p>Another point:</p>

  <p>Only a left-handed man would have thought of sawing through the left fold
  of the shutter.</p>

  <p>The occupier of Wisteria Lodge explained all this to the real detective,
  who sat stolidly on the other side of the table in the occupier's dining-room
  at three o'clock in the morning, listening to the interesting hypothesis.</p>

  <p>"I think if you look for a left-handed man with square-toed boots&mdash;or
  they may be shoes," said the householder quietly, even gently, "you will
  discover the robber."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said the real detective, and swallowed his whisky deliberately.</p>

  <p>"The curious thing about the burglary is this," the sufferer went on,
  "that although my cash-box was opened and contained over £400, the money was
  untouched. The little tray on top had not been even lifted out. My dear wife
  kept a lock of hair of her pet pom 'Chu Chin'&mdash;the poor little dear was
  poisoned last year by those horrible people at 'The Limes.' I'm sure they did
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What about this lock of hair?" asked the detective, suddenly
  interested.</p>

  <p>"It was damp, quite damp," explained the householder. "Now, as I say, my
  theory is that the man wore square-toed boots and a mackintosh. He was
  undoubtedly left-handed."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the real detective.</p>

  <p>Then he went forth and took Sentimental Simpson out of his bed, not
  because he wore square-toed shoes (nor was he left-handed), but because there
  were certain tell-tale indications which pointed unmistakably to one man.</p>

  <p>Mr. Simpson came blinking into the passage holding a paraffin lamp in his
  hand. He wore a shirt and an appearance of profound surprise.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Mr. Button," he said. "Lor' bless me, you gave me quite a start. I
  went to bed early tonight with the toothache, an' when I heard you knock I
  says to myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get your trousers on," said Detective-Sergeant Button.</p>

  <p>Simpson hesitated for just a fraction of a second and then retired to his
  sleeping apartment. Mr. Button bent his head and listened attentively for the
  sound of a stealthily opened window.</p>

  <p>But Simpson did not run.</p>

  <p>"And your coat and boots," said Button testily. "I'm surprised at you,
  Simpson&mdash;you never gave me this trouble before."</p>

  <p>Simpson accepted the reproach with amazement.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to tell me that you want me?" he said incredulously, and
  added that if heaven in its anger deprived him of his life at that very
  moment, and on the spot, which he indicated with a grimy forefinger, he had
  been in bed since a quarter to ten.</p>

  <p>"Don't let us have an argument," pleaded Mr. Button, and accompanied his
  guest to the police station.</p>

  <p>On the day of the trial, whilst he was waiting in the corridor to go up
  the flight of stairs that leads to the dock, Simpson saw his captor.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Button," he said, "I hope there is no ill-feeling between you and
  me?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever, Simpson."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you are going to get a conviction," said Simpson
  thoughtfully. He was a round-faced, small-eyed man with a gentle voice, and
  when he looked thoughtful his eyes had the appearance of having retreated a
  little farther into his head. "I bear no ill-will to you, Mr.
  Button&mdash;you've got your business and I've got mine. But who was the *
  snout'?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Button shook his head. Anyway, the informer is a sacred being, and in
  this case there was, unfortunately, no informer. Therefore, there was a
  double reason for his reticence.</p>

  <p>"Now what is the good of being unreasonable?" he said reprovingly. "You
  ought to know better than to ask me a question like that."</p>

  <p>"But what made you think it was meT' persisted Simpson, and the sergeant
  looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Who got upset over a lock of hair?" he asked significantly, and the eyes
  of his prisoner grew moist.</p>

  <p>"Hair was always a weakness of mine," he said, with a catch in his voice.
  " A relic of what you might call a loved one... somebody who has passed, Mr.
  Button, to... to the great beyond (if you'll forgive the expression). It sort
  of brings a... well, we've all got our feelings."</p>

  <p>"We have," admitted Button kindly; "and talking about feelings, Simpson,
  what are my feelings going to be if I get a ticking off from the judge for
  bringing you up without sufficient evidence? I don't think you'll escape,
  mind you, but you know what juries are! Now, what about making a nice little
  statement, Simpson? Just own up that you 'broke and entered' and I'll go into
  the box and say a good word for you. You don't want to make me look silly, do
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," confessed Simpson; "at the same time, I don't want to make
  myself look silly by owning up to a crime which, in a manner of speaking, is
  abhorrent to my nature."</p>

  <p>"You read too many books," said his captor unpleasantly; "that is where
  you get all those crack-jaw words from. Think of what my poor wife will say
  if I get it in the neck from the judge... it'll break her heart..."</p>

  <p>"Don't," gulped Mr. Simpson. "Don't do it... I can't stand it, Mr.
  Button."</p>

  <p>What he might have done had the conversation been protracted is a matter
  for speculation. At that instant the warders haled him up the steps that lead
  to the dock.</p>

  <p>And such was the weakness of the evidence against him that the jury found
  him Not Guilty without leaving the box.</p>

  <p>"I cannot congratulate the police on the conduct of this case," said the
  judge severely, and Simpson, looking upon the crestfallen face of Sergeant
  Button, thought of Mrs. Button's broken heart, and had to be assisted from
  the dock.</p>

  <p>So Mr. Simpson went back to his little room in Castel Street. He had an
  uncomfortable feeling that he had failed a friend in the hour of his need,
  and he strove vainly to banish from his mind the thought of the shattered
  harmony of Detective Button's household.</p>

  <p>It drew him just a little farther from contact with the world in which he
  lived, for he was not a popular partner and had few friends. One by one they
  had fallen away in consequence of his degrading weakness. Lew Saffron, who
  had openly and publicly stated at the "Nine Crowns" that Simpson was the
  greatest artist that had ever smashed a safe, and had as publicly challenged
  the American push to better Mr. Simpson's work in connection with the
  unauthorized opening of Epstein's Jewelry Emporium, even Lew eventually
  dropped him after a disastrous partnership.</p>

  <p>"It would have been a success and we'd have got away with the finest
  parcel of stones that ever was taken in one haul," he said, relative to a
  certain Hatton Garden job which he had worked with Simpson; "but what
  happened? He got the safe open and I was downstairs, watching the street for
  the copper, expecting him to come down with the stuff. I waited for ten
  minutes and then went up, and what did I see? This blank, blank Simpson
  sitting on the blank, blank floor, and crying his blank, blank eyes out over
  some old love-letters that Van Voss kept in his safe! Letters from a blank,
  blank typist that Van Voss had been in love with. He said they touched him to
  the core. He wanted to go and kill Van Voss, and by the time I'd got him
  quiet the street was full of bulls... we got away over the roof... no more
  Simpson for me, thank you!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Simpson sighed as he realized his lonely state. Nevertheless his
  afternoon was not unprofitably spent, for there were six more chapters of
  Christy's Old Organ to be read before, red-eyed, he returned the book to the
  free library which he patronized.</p>

  <p>He had an appointment that evening with Charles Valentino, the keeper of a
  bar at Kennington and a man of some standing in the world-beneath-the-
  world.</p>

  <p>He was a tall man with a drooping moustache (though his appearance is of
  no importance), and he was fattish of figure, heavy and deliberate of speech.
  He greeted Mr. Simpson reproachfully and in his heaviest manner.</p>

  <p>"What's this I hear about the job you did, Simpson? I couldn't believe my
  eyes when I read it in the newspaper. Got acquitted, too! You ought to have
  had ten years!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Simpson looked uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Left four hundred and thirty pounds in treasury notes in a box that you
  had opened, that wasn't even locked? What's the matter with you,
  Simpson?"</p>

  <p>Charles Valentino's tone was one of amazement, incredulity, and
  admonishment.</p>

  <p>"I can't help it, Mr. Valentino." Tears were in Sentimental Simpson's
  eyes. ""When I saw that lock of 'air on the tray and I thought perhaps that
  it was a lock of the 'air of his mother, treasured, so to speak&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Simpson's voice failed him, and he had to swallow before he
  continued:</p>

  <p>"It's me weakness, Mr. Valentino; I just couldn't go any farther."</p>

  <p>Mr. Valentino puffed thoughtfully at his cigar.</p>

  <p>"You owe me seventy pounds; I suppose you know that?" he asked
  unpleasantly. "Seventy pounds is seventy pounds."</p>

  <p>Simpson nodded.</p>

  <p>"It cost me thirty pounds for a mouthpiece," Valentino continued, and by
  "mouthpiece" he referred to the advocate who had pleaded Simpson's cause:
  "twenty-five pounds for that new lot of tools I got you, when you came out of
  'stir' last May; ten pounds I lent you to do that Manchester job, which you
  never paid me back&mdash;the so-called jewelry you brought down was all
  Birmingham stuff, nine carat, and not worth the freight charges&mdash;and
  here you had a chance of getting real money... well, I'm surprised at you,
  that^s all I can say, Simpson."</p>

  <p>Simpson shook his head unhappily.</p>

  <p>Mr. Valentino, thinking that perhaps he had gone as far as was necessary,
  beckoned the Italian waiter (the conference took place at a little brasserie
  in Soho) and invited his companion.</p>

  <p>"What will you have, Simpson?"</p>

  <p>"'Gin," said the wretched Simpson.</p>

  <p>"Gin goes with tears." Mr. Valentino was firm. "Have a more manly drink,
  Simpson."</p>

  <p>"Beer," corrected Simpson despondently.</p>

  <p>"Now I'll tell you what it is," said Mr. Valentino when their needs had
  been satisfied. "Things can't go on as they are going. I am a commercial man,
  and I've got to make money. I don't mind taking a risk when there's loot at
  the end of it, but I tell you, Simpson, straight, that I am going to chuck it
  up unless some of yon hooks pay more attention to business. "Why," went on
  Mr. Valentino indignantly, "in the old days I never had this kind of trouble
  with you boys! Willie Topple never gave me, what I might term, a moment's
  uneasiness."</p>

  <p>It was always serious when Mr. Valentino dragged Willie Topple from his
  grave in Exeter Gaol and set him up as a model of industry, and Sentimental
  Simpson moved uncomfortably in his velvet chair.</p>

  <p>"Willie was always on the spot, and if he did a job, there was the stuff
  all nicely packed up," said Mr. Valentino reminiscently. "He'd just step into
  the saloon bar, order a drink, and shove the stuff across the counter. 'You
  might keep this box of chocolates for me, Mr. Valentino,' that's what he'd
  say, and there it was, every article wrapped in tissue paper. I used to
  compare them with the list published in the Hue and Cry, and never once did
  Willie deliver short."</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>"Times have changed," he said bitterly. "Some of you boys have got so
  careless that me heart's in me mouth every time a * split' strolls into the
  bar. And what do I get out of it? Why, Willie Topple drew seventeen hundred
  pounds commission from me in one year&mdash;you owe me seventy!"</p>

  <p>"I admit it is a risk being a fence " began</p>

  <p>Mr. Simpson.</p>

  <p>"A what?" said the other sharply. "What was that word you used,
  Simpson?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Simpson was silent.</p>

  <p>"Never use that expression to me. A fence! Do you mean the receiver of
  stolen property? I mind things for people. I take a few articles, so to
  speak, in pawn for my customers. I'm surprised at you, Simpson."</p>

  <p>He did not wait for Mr. Simpson to express his contrition, but bending
  forward over the table, lowered his voice until it was little more than a
  rumble of subterranean sound.</p>

  <p>"There's a place in Park Crescent, No. 176," he said deliberately. "That's
  the very job for you, Simpson. Next Sunday night is the best time, because
  there will only be the kid in the house. There's lashings of jewelry, pearl
  necklaces, diamond plaques, and the father and mother are away at Brighton.
  They are going to a wedding. I have had a *nose' in the house, a window-
  cleaner, and says all the stuff is kept in a little safe under the mother's
  bed. The best time is after eleven. They go to bed early... and a pantry
  window that you can reach from the back of the house, only a wall to climb,
  and that's in a mews. Now, what do you say, Simpson?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Simpson scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"I'll have a look round," he said cautiously. "I don't take much notice of
  these window-cleaners. One put me on to the job at Purley&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let bygones be bygones," said Mr. Valentino. "I know all about that
  Purley business. You'd have made a profit if your dam' curiosity hadn't made
  you stop to read the funeral cards in the cook's bedroom. And after we'd got
  the cook called away to the north so that you should have no trouble and an
  empty house to work in! The question is, will you do this, or shall I put
  Harry Welting on to it? He is not as good a man as you, I admit, Simpson,
  though he hasn't your failings."</p>

  <p>"I'll do it," said Mr. Simpson, and the other nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"If a fiver is any good to you...?" he said.</p>

  <p>"It will be a lot of good to me," said Mr. Simpson fervently, and the
  money was passed.</p>

  <p>It was midnight on the 26th June, and it was raining&mdash;according to
  Mr. Simpson's extravagant description&mdash;cats and dogs, when he turned
  into Park Mews, a deserted and gloomy thoroughfare devoted to the storage of
  mechanical vehicles. He had marked the little gate in the wall by daylight.
  The wall itself was eight feet in height and surmounted by spikes. Mr.
  Simpson favored walls so guarded. The spikes, if they were not too old,
  served to attach the light rope he carried. In two minutes he was over the
  wall and was working scientifically at the pantry window. Ten minutes
  afterwards he was hanging up his wet mackintosh in the hall. He paused only
  to slip back the bolts in the door, unfasten the chain, and turn the key
  softly, before he mounted the thickly carpeted stairs.</p>

  <p>The house was in darkness. Only the slow ticK of the hall-clock broke the
  complete stillness, and Mr. Simpson walked up the stairs, keeping time to the
  clock, so that any accidental creak he might make might be confounded by a
  listener with the rhythmic noise of the timepiece.</p>

  <p>The first bedroom which he entered was without occupant. He gathered from
  the richness and disposition of the furniture, and the handsomeness of the
  appointments, that this was the room occupied by the father and mother now
  participating in the Brighton festivities.</p>

  <p>He made a thorough and professional examination of the dressing-table,
  found and pocketed a small diamond brooch of no enormous value, choked for a
  second at the silver-framed picture of a little girl that stood upon the
  dressing- table, but crushed down his emotions ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>The second bedroom was less ornate, and like the other, untenanted. Here
  he drew blank. It was evidently a room reserved for visitors; the dressing-
  table was empty as also was the wardrobe. Then he remembered and went back to
  the room he had searched and flashed his lamp under the bed. There was no
  sign of a safe. It may be in the third room, thought Mr. Simpson, and turned
  the handle of the door softly. He knew, the moment he stepped inside, that
  the big four- poster bed he could dimly see was occupied. He could hear the
  regular breathing of the sleeper and for a second hesitated, then stepping
  forward carefully, he moved to the side of the bed, listening again.</p>

  <p>Yes, the breathing was regular. He dare not put his lamp upon the sleeper.
  This must be the child's room, he guessed, and contented himself with
  stooping and showing a beam of light beneath the bed. He gasped. There was
  the "safe". A squat, steel box. He put out the light and laid the torch
  gently upon the floor, then groping beneath the bed, he gripped the box and
  slid it toward him. It was very heavy, but not too heavy to carry.</p>

  <p>Drawing the treasure clear of the bed, he slipped his torch in his pocket
  and lifted the box. If it had been the safe he had expected, his success
  would have been impossible of achievement. As it was, the weight of this
  repository taxed his strength. Presently he had it well gripped and began a
  slow retreat. He was half-way across the room when there was a click, and
  instantly the room was flooded with light. In his natural agitation the box
  slipped from his fingers; he made a wild grab to recover his hold, and did
  succeed in putting it down without noise, but no more. And then he turned,
  open-mouthed, to the child who was watching him curiously from the bed.</p>

  <p>Never in his life had Sentimental Simpson seen a child so fairylike, so
  ethereal in her loveliness. A mass of golden hair was tied back by a blue
  ribbon, and the big eyes that were fixed on him showed neither fear nor
  alarm. She sat up in bed, her thin white hands clasping the knees doubled
  beneath the coverlet, an interested and not unamused spectator of Mr.
  Simpson's embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Burglar," she said softly, and smiled.</p>

  <p>Simpson swallowed something.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, miss," he said huskily. "I hope I haven't come into the
  wrong house. A friend of mine told me to call and get a box he had
  forgotten&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're a burglar," she said, nodding wisely; "of course you're a burglar.
  I am awfully glad to see you. I have always wanted to meet a burglar."</p>

  <p>Mr. Simpson, a prey to various emotions, could think of no suitable reply.
  He looked down at the box and he looked at the child, and then he blinked
  furiously.</p>

  <p>"Come and sit here," she pointed to a chair by the side of the bed.</p>

  <p>The dazed burglar obeyed.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been a burglar?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite a long time, miss," said Mr. Simpson weakly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"You should not have said that&mdash;you should have said that this was
  your first crime," she said. "When you were a little boy, were you a
  burglar?"</p>

  <p>"No, miss," said the miserable Simpson.</p>

  <p>"Didn't your mother ever tell you that you mustn't be a burglar?" asked
  the child, and Simpson broke down.</p>

  <p>"My poor old mother!" he sobbed.</p>

  <p>It is true to say that in her lifetime the late Mrs. Simpson had evoked no
  extravagant expressions of affection from her children, who had been rescued
  from her tender care at an early age, and had been educated at the rate-
  payers' expense at the local workhouse. But the word "mother" always affected
  Mr. Simpson that way.</p>

  <p>"Poor man," said the child tenderly. She reached out her hand and laid it
  upon Mr. Simpson's bowed head. "Do your little children know that you are a
  burglar?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, miss," sobbed Simpson.</p>

  <p>He had no little children. He had never been married, but any reference to
  his children always brought a lump into his throat. By spiritual adoption he
  had secured quite a large family. Sometimes, in periods of temporary
  retirement from the activities and competition of life, he had brooded in his
  cell, his head in his hands, on how his darling little Doris would miss her
  daddy, and had in consequence enjoyed the most exquisite of mental
  tortures.</p>

  <p>"Are you a burglar because you are hungry?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Simpson nodded. He could not trust himself to speak.</p>

  <p>"You should say&mdash;'I'm starving, miss!'" she said gently. "Are you
  starving?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Simpson nodded again.</p>

  <p>"Poor burglar!"</p>

  <p>Again her hand caressed his head, and now he could not restrain himself
  any more. He fell on his knees by the side of the bed and, burying his head
  in his arms, his shoulders heaved.</p>

  <p>He heard her slip out of bed on the other side and the shuffle of her
  slippered feet as she crossed the room.</p>

  <p>"I am going to get you some food, Mr. Burglar," she said softly.</p>

  <p>All Mr. Simpson's ill-spent life passed before his anguished eyes as he
  waited. He would reform, he swore. He would Live an honest life. The
  influence of this sweet, innocent child should bear its fruit. Dear little
  soul, he thought, as he mopped his tear-stained face, she was down there in
  that dark, cold kitchen, getting him food. How brave she was! It was a long
  time before she came back bearing a tray that was all too heavy for her frail
  figure to support. He took it from her hands reverently and laid it on the
  table.</p>

  <p>She was wearing a blue silk kimono that emphasized the purity of her
  delicate skin. He could only look at her in awe and wonder.</p>

  <p>"You must eat, Mr. Burglar," she said gently.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't eat a mouthful, miss," he protested tearfully. "What you said
  to me has so upset me, miss, that if I eat a crumb, it will choke me."</p>

  <p>He did not mention, perhaps he had forgotten, that an hour previous he had
  supped to repletion. She seemed to understand, and sat down on the edge of
  the bed, her grave eyes watching him.</p>

  <p>"You must tell me about yourself," she said. "I should like to know about
  you, so that I can pray for you, Mr. Burglar."</p>

  <p>"Don't, miss!" blubbered Mr. Simpson.</p>

  <p>"Don't do it! I can't stand it! I have been a terrible man. I used to be a
  lob- crawler once. You don't know what a lob-crawler is? I used to pinch
  tills. And then I used to do ladder work. You know, miss, I put ladders up
  against the windows whilst the family was in the dining-room and and got away
  with the stuff. And then I did that job at Hoxton, the fur burglary. There
  was a lot about it in the papers&mdash;me and a fellow named Moses. He was a
  Hebrew gentleman," he added unnecessarily.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"But I am going to give it up, though, miss," said Simpson huskily. "I am
  going to chuck Valentino, and if I owe him seventy pounds, why, I'll pay him
  out of the money I earn honestly."</p>

  <p>"Who is Valentino?"</p>

  <p>"He's a fence, miss; you wouldn't know what a fence is. He keeps the *
  Bottle and Glass' public-house down Atherby Road, Kennington."</p>

  <p>"Poor man," she said, shaking her head. "Poor burglar, I am so sorry for
  you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Simpson choked. "I think I'll go, miss, if you don't mind." She nodded
  and held out her hand.</p>

  <p>He took it in his and kissed it. He had seen such things done in the
  pictures. Yet it was with a lightened heart, and with a knowledge of a great
  burden of crime and sin rolled away from his conscience that he walked down
  the stairs, his head erect, charged with a high purpose. He opened the door
  and walked out, literally and figuratively into the arms of Inspector John
  Coleman, X. Division; Sergeant Arthur John Welby of X. Division; and
  Detective Sergeant Charles John Smith, also of X. Division.</p>

  <p>"Bless my heart and soul," said the Inspector, "if it isn't Simpson!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Simpson said nothing for a moment, then:</p>

  <p>"I have been visiting a friend."</p>

  <p>"And now you are coming to stay with us. What a week-end you are having I"
  said Sergeant Smith.</p>

  <p>At four o'clock in the morning, Mr. Simpson stirred uneasily on his wooden
  bed. A voice had disturbed him; it was a loud and an aggressive voice, and it
  came from the corridor outside his cell. He heard the click and clash of a
  turning lock.</p>

  <p>"So far as I am concerned," said the voice, "I am a perfectly innocent
  man, and if any person has made a statement derogatory to my good name I will
  have the law on him, if there is a law."</p>

  <p>"Oh, there's a law all right," said the voice of Detective Smith. "In you
  go, Valentino," and then the door was slammed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Simpson sat up and took notice.</p>

  <p>Valentino!</p>

  <p>The next morning, when he was conducted by the assistant gaoler to perform
  his ablutions, he caught a glimpse of that respectable licensed victualler.
  It was the merest glimpse, for the grating in the cell-door is not a large
  one, but he heard Mr. Valentino's exclamation of annoyance, and when he
  returned, that worthy man hissed at him:</p>

  <p>"So you're the nose, are you, Simpson, you dirty dog!"</p>

  <p>"Don't say it, Mr. Valentino," said Simpson brokenly, for it hurt him that
  any man should think him guilty of so despicable an action.</p>

  <p>That their crime was associated was proved when they stepped into the dock
  together, with policemen between them, the constabulary having been inserted
  for the sake of peace and quietness. Yet, despite his position, Mr. Simpson
  was by no means depressed. His heart sang a song of joy at his reformation.
  Perhaps he would see the girl, that angel child, again; that was all he
  hoped.</p>

  <p>Looking round the court eagerly, a wave of joy swept through his being,
  for he had seen her. That was enough. He would serve whatever sentence was
  passed, and tears of happiness fell from his eyes and splashed on the steel
  rail of the dock. The assistant gaoler thoughtfully wiped them off. Rust
  spots are very difficult to eradicate, unless they are dealt with
  immediately.</p>

  <p>And then to his delight she came forward. A sweet figure of childhood, she
  seemed, as she stood in the witness stand. Her eyes rested on him for a
  second and she smiled...</p>

  <p>"If you want to cry, cry on the floor!" hissed the assistant gaoler, and
  rubbed the rail savagely with his handkerchief.</p>

  <p>A lawyer rose in the body of the court.</p>

  <p>"Your name is Marie Wilson?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," she replied in a voice of such pure harmony that a thrill ran
  through Simpson's system.</p>

  <p>"You are professionally known as "Baby Bellingham?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the child.</p>

  <p>"And you are at present engaged at the Hilarity Theatre in a play called
  The Child and the Burglar?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," she answered, with a proud glance at the dazzled Simpson.</p>

  <p>"And I thinly I am stating the fact," said the lawyer, "that your
  experience last night was practically a repetition of the action of your
  play?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the child, "except that he wouldn't say his lines. I did
  try hard to make him."</p>

  <p>The magistrate was looking at a paper on his desk.</p>

  <p>"I see there is a report of this occurrence in this morning's newspaper,"
  he said, and read the headline:</p>

  <p class="headline">"CHILD ACTRESS REDUCES HARDENED BURGLAR<br>
  TO TEARS BY HER ARTISTRY"</p>

  <p>Miss Wilson nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"After I had gone downstairs to get him his supper and had rung up the
  police on the telephone," she said, "I also rang up my press agent. My papa
  says that I must always ring up my press agent. Papa says that two lines on
  the news page is worth two columns amongst the advertisements. Papa
  says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was ten months after this when Mr. Simpson and Mr. Valentino met. They
  were loading coke into a large cart drawn by a famous old blind horse which
  is the pride of Dartmoor GaoL The warder in charge of the party was at
  sufficient distance away to allow a free interchange of courtesies.</p>

  <p>"And when I get out," said Mr. Valentino, tremulous with wrath, "I am
  going to make Kennington too hot to hold you, Simpson. A chicken-hearted
  fellow like you oughtn't to be in the business. To think that a respectable
  tradesman should be herded with common felons because a babbling, bat-eyed
  hook gets sloppy over a kid and gives away his friends&mdash;an actress
  too... stringing you along, you poor turnip! Doin' her play with you as the
  'ero! My God, you 're a disgrace to the profession!"</p>

  <p>But Simpson was standing erect, leaning on. his shovel and staring across
  the yard.</p>

  <p>In the angle of two high walls was a mound of loose earth which had been
  brought in to treat the governor's garden, and on the face of the dun-colored
  heap were vivid green shoots tipped with blue; they had come, it seemed, in a
  night, for this was the month of early spring.</p>

  <p>"Bluebells!" quavered Mr. Simpson. His lip trembled and he wiped his eyes
  with the cuff of his yellow coat.</p>

  <p>Bluebells always made Mr. Simpson cry.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story04"
     name="story04">4. CHUBB OF THE "SLIPPER"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">No doubt about Chubb's gift of oratory. When he was a sprat
  of twelve, a chubby midget filling his neat cadet uniform, he had orated to
  the Commander of H.M.S. <i>Britannia</i> to such purpose (it was on the
  subject of messing) that, recovering from his trance, the outraged officer
  had stopped his shore leave and threatened him with expulsion.</p>

  <p>People thought it was cheek, but really it was a natural gift for oratory.
  The <i>Britannia</i> boys called him Demosthenes Junior, but that was too
  long and it was "Chubb" that stuck, and rightly so, for "Chubb" fitted him as
  well as he fitted his clothes.</p>

  <p>He orated his way from Hong-Kong to Chatham, from Benin to Sydney. He
  addressed Admirals, Captains, Commanders, Navigators, and&mdash;at rare
  intervals&mdash;the Lords of the Admiralty themselves.</p>

  <p>He talked of himself soberly and gravely, as though he held the wheel of
  Destiny, and those who met him for the first time began by sniggering openly
  or secretly (according to their rank), and ended in a condition of
  awe-stricken reverence.</p>

  <p>If Chubb hadn't been a good fellow, a splendid seaman, one of the best
  torpedo officers of his day, he would have been a bore. As it was, men sought
  him out to learn of his wisdom, and even Admirals, called up to respond at
  local functions for the Navy, came to Chubb to pick up the wrinkles of
  rhetoric.</p>

  <p>On a day in July, Chubb Church came down to the quay, driving his little
  yellow two-seater. His suit was aggressively brown, and perched above his
  round, red, cherubic face was a gray top hat. He had a long cigar between his
  teeth and a look of settled melancholy in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He drew the car up with a jerk by the edge of the landing-stage and slowly
  descended.</p>

  <p>A waiting petty officer touched his cap.</p>

  <p>"Flagship's made a signal. Get up steam, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"The Flagship's made a signal. Get up steam," repeated Chubb absently.
  "0h, it has, has it?"</p>

  <p>He inspected his small car with a bleak stare and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Never again, O car of fate," he said.</p>

  <p>The chief petty officer twiddled his bare toes in embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, sir?" he said.</p>

  <p>Chubb brought his eyes to his subordinate.</p>

  <p>"Is your name Carr, my lad?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;Samson, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then you are not the car I was addressing, Samson."</p>

  <p>He returned to his contemplation of the machine.</p>

  <p>His chauffeur had climbed out of the little well at the back of the car,
  and was regarding its mechanism anxiously and not a little resent-fully.</p>

  <p>Chubb twirled his cane, and pushed his gray hat further on the back of his
  head and sighed.</p>

  <p>"Son," he said, "take the car to Plymouth&mdash;I may be there, who knows
  the strange and beneficent workings of Providence? If I do not come, you will
  call every morning at Drake's Lodge and tell Miss Gillander that the car is
  entirely at her disposal mornin', afternoon, and evenin'&mdash;at any hour of
  the day or night. Tell her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here he stopped. Even Chubb felt the delicacy of delivering tragic
  messages by a chauffeur, and moreover in the presence of a hard-footed and
  eager-eared sailor who would repeat the conversation for the benefit of his
  favored members of the Petty Officers' Mess.</p>

  <p>Also there was a chance of the battleship going into Devonport, where he
  might deliver the message himself.</p>

  <p>"Recall signal flying, sir," said the petty officer.</p>

  <p>"Blow the recall signal!" replied Chubb mutinously.</p>

  <p>He turned and walked slowly down the steps and stepped nimbly into the
  bobbing pinnace.</p>

  <p>"Cast off," he said and settled himself in the tiny cabin as the pinnace
  danced over the sunlit waters of Falmouth to the Ironside.</p>

  <p>"What the devil were you waiting for, Chubb?" asked a justly annoyed
  Captain, who had been watching the scene ashore with his telescope; "I jolly
  nearly recalled the pinnace without you."</p>

  <p>Chubb took off his hat.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he said, " there are moments in life when the premonition trembles
  upon one edge of sordid actuality."</p>

  <p>"Hurry up and get out of that kit," interrupted the skipper briefly. "Come
  on to the bridge, I want to speak to you."</p>

  <p>"We are going into Devonport," said Captain Benson ten minutes later, when
  they stood side by side on the bridge of the battleship; "I suppose you've
  heard the news?"</p>

  <p>Chubb bowed his head.</p>

  <p>"She sails on Wednesday next," he said, with splendid resignation. "You
  may think, sir, that I'm a sentimental ass&mdash;well, sir, as dear old
  Socrates or Plato or one of those officers said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who sails?" asked his astounded superior. "I'm not talking about anybody
  sailing."</p>

  <p>"I thought you referred to Miss Gillander, sir," replied Chubb, redder
  than ever.</p>

  <p>The Captain's lips twitched.</p>

  <p>"Nothing so important," he said gravely, "merely a question of European
  complications, and you're gazetted to the <i>Slipper</i> for special
  service."</p>

  <p>And so it came about that Chubb saw Jo Gillander again.</p>

  <p>He saw her in the big and fragrant drawing-room that overlooks the Head,
  and there was pleasure unmistakable in her eyes.</p>

  <p>She was the tiniest of girls, so perfectly and beautifully proportioned
  that you forgot she was under the height of the average woman. Her face was
  delicately modeled and delicately colored. There was a dancing imp of
  laughter in her eyes, yet so tender a laughter that tears seemed near at
  hand.</p>

  <p>"I saw your big fat ship come in," she said, and patted the settee by her
  side most invitingly.</p>

  <p>No doubt but that Chubb prepared a rapid survey in language of
  overpowering vividness. From the world to this little lady was a natural
  transposition.</p>

  <p>"It is not for me," he finished gravely, "to forecast the enormous and
  cataclysmic consequence to a situation already workin' to its ordained and
  fearful end. What spark of rhetoric, what brand of eloquence will eventually
  fire the magazine, changin' the destinies of men, and casting into the
  melting- pot the fortunes of nations&mdash;but, Miss Gillander, I can say
  with great earnestness and sincerity that I love you."</p>

  <p>She raised her hand gently to stop him, but there was kindness in her eyes
  and the laughter had gone.</p>

  <p>"For you," he went on, "I am prepared at any given moment&mdash;so far as
  the exigencies of the Service admit&mdash;to throw down the gage of war to
  all the world; refuse me, as you have done not once, but many times, and let
  the world grow apprehensive in the face of a heartbroken and reckless
  man."</p>

  <p>Of course it was absurd. She explained the absurdity in a very few words.
  It wasn't the disparity in their fortunes, because, although the American
  heiress was credited with millions, yet Chubb was very well off indeed. It
  wasn't that her parents objected, because she had no parents. It wasn't even
  that she disliked Chubb&mdash;but (here was the truth, and she could not tell
  it) Chubb was without the heroic qualities. He was less like the hero of
  tradition than anybody she had met. He was fat&mdash;there was no getting
  away from his girth; he was plump, he was babylike.</p>

  <p>She was a worshipper of tall men, with sad, clean-cut features, powdered
  gray at the temples. Chubb threatened to go bald on the slightest
  provocation.</p>

  <p>She explained, getting round the subject as best she could, why it was
  impossible for her to marry him.</p>

  <p>Chubb went back to the dockyard to superintend the revictualling of H.M.S.
  <i>Slipper</i> with a heavy heart.</p>

  <p>It was his first important command, but it gave him no pleasure. It was a
  dream of a ship, could pull out twenty-eight knots; a lightly armed,
  unprotected cruiser designed for the protection of shipping&mdash;a sleek,
  swift, deadly little ship, such as Chubb could handle better than any man in
  the Service.</p>

  <p>But his heart was at Drake's Lodge, with a girl whose packing he
  interrupted from day to day.</p>

  <p>She was very definite at last, being humanly annoyed, not so much at his
  persistence as from his having called at 11 a. m. and caught her immersed in
  the prosaic task of making a cubic yard of wearing apparel fit half a cubic
  yard of box.</p>

  <p>The Steamship Company had sent her a frantic warning that she must reduce
  her baggage to its smallest limit, for war was in the air, and the holds of
  S.S. <i>Germanie</i> were needed for passenger accommodation.</p>

  <p>"Understand finally. Captain Church," said she, still kind, but this time
  unpleasantly so, "I cannot marry; you are not the kind of man I
  want&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There&mdash;she had said it!</p>

  <p>Chubb stood comically, tragically bewildered.</p>

  <p>What kind of man could she want?</p>

  <p>"The hot weather has perhaps affected you, Miss Gillander," he said
  gently; "the psychology of weather in its relation to human affairs has
  often&mdash;in short, what's wrong with me?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want you," she said, biting her lips.</p>

  <p>There was a long and painful silence.</p>

  <p>"0h," said Chubb, and groped for his cap; "all right." He walked to the
  door and turned upon her a face charged with portent. "For all that happens
  hereafter," said he, "you are responsible."</p>

  <p>She ignored the unfairness of the threat.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to&mdash;" she began in agitation.</p>

  <p>"You will see the map of Europe changed," said Chubb and walked out.</p>

  <p>From that moment, in Chubb's mind, war was inevitable.</p>

  <p>The <i>Slipper</i> came slowly through the darkening seas, all her lights
  out, a blur of gray on a gray ocean. Behind her, scarcely visible, was the
  coast of Ireland.</p>

  <p>Chubb stood on the bridge, and by his side was his First Lieutenant. The
  telegraph marked "Slow ahead." Chubb looked at his watch, snapped the case
  cover, and took from his pocket an envelope heavily sealed. He handed it
  without a word to his Number One, who examined the seal and passed it back to
  his superior.</p>

  <p>Chubb tore the envelope of his sealed orders and read the contents.</p>

  <p>"Convey the <i>Germanie</i> to latitude..." he read aloud;..."wireless me
  when you have opened this... keep an eye open for the enemy's torpedo boats;
  there are four in your area..."</p>

  <p>There were other instructions concerning a certain collier which would be
  found waiting at a rendezvous&mdash;of other ships suspected of acting as
  colliers to the enemy. Chubb knew all about the <i>Germanie</i>, Its immense
  speed, its crowded accommodation, and, most important item of all, the fact
  that it carried two million pounds of gold had been set forth in the columns
  of the Press.</p>

  <p>"What the deuce are they sending gold to America for!" he asked fretfully.
  "It seems to me that this is the time of all times when the auriferous metal
  is most needed at the seat of war."</p>

  <p>"Shipment purchased months ago by the U.S. Treasury, sir," said his Number
  One. "Dash it all&mdash;we can't pinch the gold of neutrals!"</p>

  <p>"But why not send this damned stuff on an American ship!" protested Chubb.
  "Are you aware that the <i>Studtgardt</i> and the <i>Altona</i> are in these
  waters&mdash;two of the fastest cruisers the Dutchmen have? Are you aware
  that on the <i>Germanie</i> are delicately nurtured ladies to whom the very
  thought of war is abhorrent? By Heavens!"&mdash;he raised a dramatic fist to
  the sky&mdash;" rather would I see the vexed boundaries of Europe twist in
  serpentine convulsions than that one spasm of fear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wireless from the Flagship, sir."</p>

  <p>The operator came on board with a bit of paper.</p>

  <p>Chubb looked at the paper.</p>

  <p>"Candour, devoted, Portsmouth, tempted," it ran.</p>

  <p>"Decode that," he said, and in three minutes the message was in his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Destroyers covering <i>Studtgardt</i> are crossing you."</p>

  <p>Chubb nodded.</p>

  <p>He was dressed in gray flannel trousers and gray sweater, a grim,
  workmanlike suit for the task in hand.</p>

  <p>He was the seaman now, cautious, alert, and tense.</p>

  <p>The engine telegraph went over to "Full ahead," and the swift
  <i>Slipper</i> gathering speed tore through the water, cutting the heavy seas
  with her knife- like bows. The day was failing but there was no mist.
  Officers searched the seas ahead through their binoculars, but there was no
  sign of craft. Darkness fell, and then far away on the starboard bow Chubb
  saw something.</p>

  <p>It was no more than a patch of foam on the water, but it was moving.</p>

  <p>It was for all the world as though a big white feather was being trailed
  on the sea at the end of an invisible swing.</p>

  <p>"Submarine on the starboard bow," he shouted, and the <i>Slipper</i>
  heeled over as though she was turning turtle as she came bow on to the
  danger.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>From the starboard gun of the forrard battery flicked a straight rod of
  flame. Instantly the white beams of two searchlights played upon the
  feather.</p>

  <p>Chubb's finger touched a button and two seconds later a long fish-like
  shape leapt from the bow to the water&mdash;a shape that seemed alive as it
  swam straight and swift to its prey.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The shell from the second gun threw up a column of water to the rear of
  the feather, now moving in a circle preparatory to launching her
  death-dealing messenger.</p>

  <p>She was half turned when the British torpedo struck her. Up into the air
  jumped a great column of water sprinkled with black wreckage. A deafening
  explosion and then silence.</p>

  <p>"A-way cutter!" roared Chubb, and the boat went over the side to pick up
  what was left of the luckless crew.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" said Chubb and wiped his forehead as the boat came back from its
  fruitless search.</p>

  <p>The boat was hardly inboard when the second attack came. The two
  destroyers came into the white beams of the searchlights as the
  <i>Slipper</i> was gathering way. The four starboard guns of the
  <i>Slipper</i> spoke together, and there,came across the waters a sound like
  the emptying of a sack of old iron.</p>

  <p>"That's got her," began Chubb, when the bridge on which he stood was raked
  by a mad twirling shell, which carried away rail and port telegraph, and
  almost carried Chubb with it. It was the last shot the destroyer fired. Again
  the fish- like shape leapt joyfully to its work from the torpedo tube in the
  bow.</p>

  <p>It met and passed another, which just missed the swinging stem of the
  <i>Slipper</i>... the torpedo boat went down by the head in a swirl of
  water.</p>

  <p>But the second was intact though lamed.</p>

  <p>The aft guns of the <i>Slipper</i> pumped shell into her, but at an ever-
  increasing distance.</p>

  <p>"Wireless the Flagship," said Chubb; "they can send a couple of T.B.D.'s
  to pick her up."</p>

  <p>He was bothered. He was working blindly. Somewhere beyond the rim of the
  sea men were playing a game with the <i>Slipper</i> as a pawn. Somewhere in a
  big building in the very heart of London the players watched him
  dispassionately&mdash;condemning him, perhaps, that from his sacrifice they
  might gain some advantage of which he knew nothing.</p>

  <p>He searched the seas again through his night-glasses. It was not a hostile
  cruiser he sought; the <i>Studtgardt</i> was a thousand miles away. It was
  <i>Germanie</i> he was looking for. The fact was the panic-stricken
  <i>Germanie</i> was running at top speed to the New England coast with her
  precious cargo.</p>

  <p>He parted from the cruiser fleet at Brow Head and had taken his
  instructions from the gray-haired young Admiral.</p>

  <p>"Here are your orders," he said, handing the sealed package; "you won't
  have much trouble, I fancy&mdash;keep to the south of the <i>Germanie</i>'s
  course. Coal at Halifax, and report to the C.I.C, North Atlantic."</p>

  <p>"Far be it from me, sir," said Chubb, "to discuss or question the high
  strategists of war, but a great passenger steamer carrying huge quantities of
  gold demands much greater protection than I can give her."</p>

  <p>"Don't make speeches at me, you insubordinate devil," said the
  Admiral.</p>

  <p>"You're not likely to be bothered, and if you are you can run up to the
  <i>Germanie</i>, take off Miss Gillander, and set a course for a desert
  island."</p>

  <p>Chubb blushed and went down the ladder, cursing all high officers who
  gossiped about his private affairs.</p>

  <p>So the fleet sailed eastward, and a man who had been lying out of sight of
  the coastguards on the Irish coast carefully noted the direction it took, and
  making his way to the nearest post office telegraphed to London a tender
  inquiry after his mother's health.</p>

  <p>An hour later the German North Atlantic Squadron received news via
  Togoland that the rich prize <i>Germanie</i> was on her way to America
  escorted by one insignificant, unprotected cruiser.</p>

  <p>Wireless messages went left and right, and while two destroyers and a
  submarine moved from their secret base to cut off the <i>Slipper</i>, the
  cruiser squadron made its preparations for the rapid transference of
  gold.</p>

  <p>There was on board the <i>Germanie</i> a certain air of tension which
  communicated itself by some remarkable method from the ships' officers, who
  knew the peril, to the passengers, who knew nothing.</p>

  <p>Jo Gillander, stretched in a big deck chair her grave eyes on the horizon,
  found a certain melancholy pleasure in the nervousness of he] fellow-
  passengers. For she needed diversion There lingered in her mind the unheroic
  figure of a stout young naval officer and in her ears his sombre eloquence.
  She smiled faintly, but the smile soon passed.</p>

  <p>She had not realized how big a place he held in her heart and in her
  thoughts. She looked up with half a frown as the dapper figure of the middle-
  aged von Sedligtz dropped into the chair by her side. She had known him for
  some years He was attached to the Embassy at Washington an automatically
  smiling man, with a clean skin and a carefully brushed moustache.</p>

  <p>"Now you shall soon be back in your free land," he smiled, "away from
  horrid war, hein. Soon we shall make wars impossible and police all
  Europe&mdash;Europe in peace under our High Kaiser!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think you will win?" She looked a him curiously, and he
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"Cer-tain-ly&mdash;why not? First to crush France, then to crush Russia,
  and all the time we weary the English fleet&mdash;picking off one ship here
  and one ship there."</p>

  <p>He stopped and hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Already," he said impressively, and his hand swept to the sea, "In this
  circle of water there has been one such ship&mdash; pouf!&mdash;gone! I
  know."</p>

  <p>He nodded wisely.</p>

  <p>She looked at him with resentment in her eyes. That he could smile amidst
  such horrors! That he could be so complacent in the face of tragedy! And she
  remembered that stout man of hers&mdash;yes, of hers, she told herself
  defiantly, and enveloped him in that second of time in the heroic qualities
  which had never been his. At this moment the Captain of the <i>Slipper</i>
  was very precious to this dainty little lady.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it went out," von Sedligtz went on, unconscious of the storm that
  was gathering; "one moment a proud ship&mdash;the next moment our friend the
  <i>Slipper</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The <i>Slipper</i>!"</p>

  <p>She was on her feet, white and shaking.</p>

  <p>"Jawohl!" he said jocularly&mdash;he was a dense man and saw only the
  sensation he had made. "Such is my knowledge. You saw a fishing-boat pass
  yesterday&mdash;you saw a man waving little flags&mdash;he told me
  everything."</p>

  <p>She confronted him, pale as death, that rosebud mouth set in a straight
  line.</p>

  <p>"If the <i>Slipper</i> is sunk," she said in a low Voice, "I hope this
  ship sinks, and you and I wath it."</p>

  <p>He stared at her, but he was never destined to utter what was in his
  mind... they felt the ship slow down, without realizing what was happening,
  then&mdash; "Gott!" cried the exultant von Sedligtz; "Look!"</p>

  <p>Right ahead, barring the way, were four great ships painted gray, and from
  their main fluttered the white-and-black flag.</p>

  <p>"For the gold, you understand," he cried, beside himself with
  joy&mdash;"for twenty million marks on this ship. Hoch!"</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer they came, then the <i>Germanie</i>'s engines reversed
  and stopped, and a little steamboat came rocking from the Flagship of the
  squadron. It got half-way when under its bows came a fountain of water, and
  dully across the sea came the shock of the explosion.</p>

  <p>Jo Gillander turned her head and gasped. Coming at full speed, the water,
  creamy white at her sharp nose, raced the <i>Slipper</i>,</p>

  <p>It was madness&mdash;she realized that. She saw the German picket-boat
  turn, then of a sudden it flew to splinters before her eyes.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously the squadron ahead moved left and right and came into
  action.</p>

  <p>"Crash! Crash! Crash!"</p>

  <p>The guns were thunder; the whizzing, shrieking shells indescribably
  terrifying.</p>

  <p>With clasped hands and gray face she saw the <i>Slipper</i> turn almost on
  her side as she changed her course, saw a black cavity yawn in her upper
  works.</p>

  <p>The <i>Slipper</i> was showing her teeth now. Her four-point-two guns were
  not to be despised, and she hit back, spitting fire, fore, aft, and
  amidships.</p>

  <p>Worse than this, the lean gray devils were being loosened from their
  forward tubes.</p>

  <p>The <i>Studtgardt</i> was suddenly enveloped in flame and smoke and listed
  heavily to port.</p>

  <p>Then a shell carried away mast and fore-funnel of the <i>Slipper</i>, and
  she went over again, to recover almost immediately.</p>

  <p>But the cruiser squadron was showing unusual activity. Smoke belched from
  their stacks and there was a flurry of water astern...</p>

  <p>They saw the British fleet long before the hysterical folk on the
  <i>Germanie</i> had seen her.</p>

  <p>They came up in two divisions, marvelously appearing over the rim of the
  sea&mdash;eighty mighty vessels of war, throwing steel farther and heavier
  than any cruiser that was ever built.</p>

  <p>The end came in a horrible whirlpool of water that marked a vanished
  cruiser.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"It was a ruse, of course," said von Sedligtz, his mouth working
  pathetically; "they sent the <i>Slipper</i>, and followed her up."</p>

  <p>She said nothing, waiting at the end of the gangway, up which there ran a
  beautiful man in a gray sweater, his red face grimy with powder, a most
  unlovely cut across his cheek&mdash;he got that from a splinter of shell
  which all but missed him.</p>

  <p>"The Admiral's compliments to you, and can you go ahead, sir?" said Chubb.
  "I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then he saw the girl.</p>

  <p>"I told you what would happen," he said reproachfully, and indicated a
  battered cruiser; "all this might have been avoided."</p>

  <p>And as he saddled her with the full responsibility for a European war, she
  came laughing and crying to his arms.</p>

  <h2><a id="story05"
     name="story05">5. INDIAN MAGIC</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When love comes barging into a man's business there's
  generally trouble for everybody. That is the opinion of people with knowledge
  and education.</p>

  <p>There was a schoolmaster&mdash;and a real gentleman&mdash;who used to work
  next to me in the shoe-making shop at Dartmoor, who told me that love is
  responsible for more crime than drink. He gave me the figures, and with a bit
  of chalk he drew what he called a "grarf" on the sole of Wigman's
  boots&mdash;Wigman, that shot the policeman in the Harrow Road. A very nice
  fellow&mdash;Wigman, I mean. I never met the policeman.</p>

  <p>There used to be a warder at Dartmoor whose wife ran away with a soldier.
  You ought to hear him talk about women!</p>

  <p>There's another thing I despise&mdash;foreigners. It stands to reason that
  foreigners are different to us Christians. There's no sense of, what I might
  term, honor amongst them. They keep things back like Dhobi, the Indian, kept
  things from young Sam Baring. Love and foreigners was Sam's ruin, and deny it
  who can.</p>

  <p>Sam is as smart a fellow as you would find between here and... well,
  anywhere. Quite the gentleman, and well educated. He can read and write, and
  you can't ask him anything about geography that he couldn't tell you.</p>

  <p>He is always well dressed&mdash;why, I've seen him mixing with the swells
  at Ascot like one of themselves. High collar, spotted tie, long-tailed coat,
  and a handsome brown bowler with a Beatty tilt&mdash;he was my idea of what a
  lord should look like.</p>

  <p>Sam and me and an American, named Bisher, made a lot of money out of the
  electric racing saddle. You put it on a horse and touched a button&mdash;and
  he moves! I've seen experienced trainers watching the effect of the saddle
  with their mouths wide open. There was a coil inside and a small battery.
  "When you touched the button, the horse got a shock, and naturally went a bit
  faster. It cost about £150 to make, and we took orders for ninety at £50
  apiece. I needn't tell you that when we didn't deliver the goods, some
  unpleasant letters came to the office, but, as Sam said, they were out to
  defraud the Jockey Club by artificial stimulants, and he was doing a good
  turn to the sport by besting them. Anyway, they couldn't squeal, and that was
  something.</p>

  <p>Sam had high notions about racing, and we'd hardly packed our parcel
  before he saw an advertisement of a farm for sale, and he got the idea of
  training a horse or two. He bought a couple out of selling races at Gatwick
  and Lingfield: Early Worm was one, and the other was called String of Beans.
  Sam got a license to train without much trouble. He had never been before the
  Stewards, and he hadn't tried to sell electric saddles to the swell trainers
  at Newmarket, so, as the song says, the breath of scandal ne'er sullied his
  fair name. And he hadn't been in the hands of the police either.</p>

  <p>Luck is a funny thing. Both those horses he bought were pretty good. We
  used to run 'em down the course for a bit. They wouldn't be trying a yard.
  Then, when the money was down, we let loose the head of String of Beans, and
  the way he won was both exciting and cheerful.</p>

  <p>We might have gone on, and packed enough money to live like princes, if it
  hadn't been for this girl I've been referring to.</p>

  <p>Her name was Virginia, the same as the country in America, but she was
  English. Personally, I never saw anything in her, and when one day I heard
  her say to her father, "Who is that funny little man with the big red nose?"
  referring to me, she passed out of my life, and I lost all respect for her.
  Her father's name was Major Rice, and he had a stable near ours. He trained a
  few horses, mostly his own, but he had a couple belonging to a young
  gentleman named Tarbot, Captain Harold Tarbot.</p>

  <p>Sam got quite friendly with them, and used to go over to late dinner all
  dressed up in evening clothing, which was swank.</p>

  <p>Well, to cut a long story short, he fell in love with this girl, and
  meeting her out one day on the Downs, he up and told her that she was the
  only girl in the world, and that all he had, including the house and
  furniture, Early Worm, and String of Beans, was hers, which wasn't right,
  because me and Bisher had a share in the horses, and all the chairs in the
  dining-room I bought with my own money.</p>

  <p>I don't exactly know what happened, but Sam came home with bits of Sussex
  sticking to his clothes and a black eye. Sam was wrong, but he was always a
  bit rough with women, and I gather that this captain happened to be
  handy.</p>

  <p>"This comes of lowering yourself to the level of common people," said Sam,
  when he told us all about it. "I thought I was doing her a favor, which,
  considering her father is in debt, and this captain hasn't got two shillings
  to rub together, I certainly was. I'll give him Blue Rat!"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't give him anything if I were you, Sam," I said, and Bisher
  agreed with me. "If the young woman won't let you walk out with her, she's
  got bad taste. As to a blue rat&mdash;well, I've never heard of it, but I've
  seen pink ones in my time, especially in the United States, where good
  alcohol and lives are cheap."</p>

  <p>"Blue Rat is his horse," said Sam, who was putting a bit of sticking-
  plaster on his cheek in front of the looking-glass. "He has been saving it
  all the year to win a selling plate at Newmarket. And to think," he said
  bitterly, "that I have been giving him advice and helping, so to speak, to
  get the horse together!"</p>

  <p>Knowing how he felt, I was a bit astonished the next day when he went over
  to Major Rice's, saw the young lady and the captain, and apologized. He
  didn't tell us what his object was, and my own opinion then was that it was
  sheer gentlemanliness, for Sam Baring is as polite a fellow as ever drew the
  breath of life.</p>

  <p>Anyway, everything must have been all right, for Major Rice came over to
  look at String of Beans. It was the first time he had ever been in our house,
  and Sam made a great fuss of him. The young lady didn't come, but I saw her,
  that same week, strolling across the Downs with the captain, and I must say
  that they looked on affectionate terms, so far as it is possible for a man of
  the world to judge.</p>

  <p>One night Sam came in to where me and Bisher were playing a quiet game of
  bezique and he said:</p>

  <p>"I have entered String of Beans for a mile selling plate at Newmarket. It
  is the same race that Blue Rat is entered for, and I want to warn you fellows
  that if the major asks you if String of Beans is any good, you've got to say
  no. I am going to give that captain the shock of his life."</p>

  <p>We had a couple of lads that Sam had picked up, to look after the horses,
  and he gave these boys instructions that String of Beans was only to be
  exercised at full strength when Major Rice wasn't on the Downs. Therefore, it
  was more remarkable still when Sam told us one day at lunch that Major Rice
  was bringing Blue Rat across the following morning, to give him a trial spin
  with String of Beans.</p>

  <p>"0h, boy!" said Bisher, who, being an American, used strange
  expressions.</p>

  <p>"There's going to be nothing funny about it," said Sam seriously. "I am
  putting a bit of extra weight on String of Beans, my idea being to know just
  how I stand with this Blue Rat. I've told the lad to ride him out."</p>

  <p>The next morning the trial came off, and, to Sam's astonishment. Blue Rat
  made rings round String of Beans. Led him all the way, and won the trial in a
  hack canter; and the time was good, as I know, because I had my watch on the
  spin from start to finish.</p>

  <p>Sam looked down his nose when he came back to the house.</p>

  <p>"That Blue Rat horse is going to win," he said.</p>

  <p>"What about the weight you gave String of Beans?"</p>

  <p>Sam shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," he said; *4f String of Beans had a stone less, he
  couldn't have won that trial. This is horrible. Nosey." (I might remark that
  that was the name by which my intimate friends called me.)</p>

  <p>Anyhow, Sam wasn't quite satisfied, and he persuaded the major to give the
  horses another trial, and this time they carried the weights they were set to
  carry in the race, and Blue Rat did just what he liked with String of Beans -
  -waited on him to the distance, and then came away and won his race,
  dancing.</p>

  <p>"A11 my best laid plans are dissolving in smoke," groaned Sam, who was a
  very high-class talker when he liked to give his mind to literary
  conversation. "I have been kidding Rice all along that his horse was the
  best, and quite unexpectedly I have been telling the truth."</p>

  <p>"If you don't want Blue Rat to win, why not get at the other horse!" said
  Bisher. "It is dead easy to give him a pill a couple of days before the
  race."</p>

  <p>"Not so easy," said Sam. "You don't suppose," he asked contemptuous, "that
  I have been going in and out of that house without knowing the lay of the
  stables? Besides, if you gave him poison he wouldn't run, and if he wouldn't
  run, that way the captain wouldn't lose his money, would he?" which is common
  sense and logic, as we all agreed.</p>

  <p>It was a week before the race when we met Mr. Dhobi. He was an Indian
  person&mdash;I will not call him a gentleman&mdash;a little fellow, very
  thin, with a high forehead and gold spectacles. Sam had met him somewhere in
  town, where he used to run a fortune-telling business, in a little turning
  off Regent Street.</p>

  <p>I never saw a man wear a frock-coat and a top-hat on a hot day so
  elegantly.</p>

  <p>Nobody expected him.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, gentlemen," he said in his foreign way, "I happened to know
  that Mr. Baring was down at Luscombe, and as Mr. Baring has been a very good
  friend of mine, I couldn't very well avoid giving him a chance of securing
  the golden harvest, which the brave and the fortunate alike deserve,"</p>

  <p>I've got a good memory for words, even if I don't know the meaning of
  them, and that was what he said.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to see you, Dhobi; how is the crystal fake going?"</p>

  <p>Dhobi shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The constabulary of London have interfered, tyrannously and arbitrarily,"
  he said. "Because I am a stranger to your land, being an Indian, as you will
  notice by the pigmentation of my countenance, I have been victimized by a
  trick of brutality. But knowing that Mr. Baring was in the racecourse
  business, I have brought to him the discovery of a fellow-countryman of mine,
  hoping that a suitable honorarium will reward me for trouble taken and
  traveling expenses incurred."</p>

  <p>And then he told us the most wonderful story. Personally, I didn't believe
  it, being by nature suspicious, and by profession a teller of the tale. But
  this Dhobi had a drug which was called Indian Magic. He brought out a big
  packet and showed us. It looked like dried tea leaves, but it was the dried
  leaf of a certain Indian bush which only grew on the high mountains, and it
  had the effect of increasing the stamina of any human being or horse that ate
  it. Whether or not there are high mountains in India, I don't know. Sam said
  there were certain hills called the Emma Layers or Hindoo Push, and geography
  was his passion.</p>

  <p>Naturally, being experienced tale-pitchers, and having behind us a record
  of ninety electric saddles sold and paid for, we didn't exactly fall upon his
  neck.</p>

  <p>"It sounds all right, Dhobi," said Sam.</p>

  <p>"The proof of the pudding is in the eating," said Dhobi, highly
  enthusiastic. "I do not ask you to buy a pig in a poke, or make a leap in the
  dark. Give one handful to any horse you have before he goes out to exercise,
  and then tell me if I am indulging in fairy stories or fantastic
  exaggerations."</p>

  <p>That seemed fair.</p>

  <p>We put Dhobi up for the night and brought him into a game of Solo with the
  idea of testing his intelligence. He was more intelligent by three pounds ten
  and sixpence than Sam and me when we got up to go to bed.</p>

  <p>"We will try it on String of Beans," said Sam. "He has always struck me as
  being a horse liable to take kindly to intoxication."</p>

  <p>So, before the sun was up, we all went to String of Beans's stall, and
  Dhobi mixed with the horse's corn a handful of the Indian Magic.</p>

  <p>String of Beans ate off all right. He'd eat anything. He had a special
  partiality for mutton bones and cabbage stalks, which is strange, considering
  that most of his ancestors were vegetarians.</p>

  <p>The only thing we had to try him with was Early Worm, who wasn't a bad
  horse by any means; moreover, he had been in the trial spin with Blue Rat,
  and he had been up sides with String of Beans all the way, and had only been
  beaten a neck.</p>

  <p>So we went out to the Downs, and String of Beans was the liveliest member
  of the party. The way he tiptoed and pranced and walked sideways and backways
  was both alarming and instructive. I've never seen a horse get jovial before,
  but String of Beans was all that; he did everything except laugh. I don't
  know whether people will believe what I'm going to tell them.</p>

  <p>String of Beans jumped off at the start, made all the running, and beat
  Early "Worm by the length of the street. There was nothing wrong about the
  gallop, because three of us put the clock on him and he did the mile in one-
  forty dead.</p>

  <p>Sam drew a long sigh, and his eyes shone with a soft light.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Dhobi," he said, "you are indeed a welcome guest."</p>

  <p>But he wasn't parting with any money until we had seen how String of Beans
  got over his jag. The wonderful thing about Indian Magic was that it showed
  no sign on the horse's coat. He didn't break out in a sweat or go mad, and
  when the race was over he was just as lively as he was before it started. In
  fact, Indian Magic had no effect at all upon him, except when we galloped him
  a few days after the trial he didn't go any faster than Early Worm. To make
  absolutely sure, we tried a handful of Indian Magic on Early Worm, and then
  put the two horses together in a fast mile spin. Early Worm went ahead and
  stayed there, and when it was over, and we clicked down our watches, Sam
  said:</p>

  <p>"Boys, this Captain What's-his-name is going to get a jar."</p>

  <p>He had quite recovered his position with the Rices: he used to go over
  there regular, and the captain couldn't do enough for him. Especially when
  Sam gave him advice about Blue Rat. I heard him one day when we were up on
  the Downs exercising our two animals. The captain and the young lady rode up
  to us just before we left.</p>

  <p>"Are you running yours at Newmarket, Mr. Baring?" says the captain.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I shall run him," says Sam, shaking his head mournfully. "But what's
  the use? Your Blue Rat is going to put it all over us."</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether I shall get a good price?" says the captain
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"If you don't advertise it, and nobody knows anything about the trial,
  you'll get six to one for your money," says Sam. "I shall back mine," he went
  on, "for old association's sake. String of Beans has been a good friend of
  mine, and I don't think he'd like to know that I let him run without having
  fifty on him. In fact," he says, "I shouldn't be surprised if my horse wasn't
  favorite, but don't you take any notice of that, Captain. The public always
  dash in and back the wrong horse."</p>

  <p>"I have been looking at the entries," says the captain, pulling a paper
  out of his pocket. "Do you see anything there that is likely to beat mine,
  Mr. Baring?"</p>

  <p>He handed down the paper and Sam took it.</p>

  <p>"No," he says, "there is nothing there to beat yours. String of Beans will
  head most of them; but, of course, the poor old String won't see the way your
  horse is going."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," says Miss Virginia, in an absent-minded kind of way, and she
  looks at the captain with a kind of scared look. "It is an awful lot of money
  to risk on a selling plater, Harold," she says. "Daddy doesn't like the idea
  at all."</p>

  <p>"Believe me," says Sam, very earnest, "and I speak as a sportsman of
  experience and a man of the world, backing Blue Rat is like picking up money.
  It is like taking pennies from a child," he says. "If I wasn't an honest
  man&mdash; which, thank God, I am," says Sam, "and not a word has ever been
  spoken against my character, and no stain of dishonor has blotted my
  coat-of-arms, which is a lamb crouching before a lion ramping, if I
  wasn't&mdash;well, anyway, I'm not going to back your horse, not for a
  penny," he says. "I wouldn't spoil your market. It would be almost caddish,"
  he says.</p>

  <p>"Do you think the trial was right?" says the captain.</p>

  <p>"Right?" says Sam scoffingly, "why, of course it was right; you took the
  time, the clock cannot lie. No, poor old String of Beans can't win, and if
  you would rather I didn't run him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," says the captain hastily, "especially if he is likely to
  become a public favorite. That will make the price of Blue Rat a better
  one."</p>

  <p>Walking home to the farm, Sam was a bit remorseless.</p>

  <p>"When that dud goes broke, I am going along to the sale of his goods to
  buy some of his heirlooms," he says. "I won't half tell him what I think of
  him, either! As to the girl, I wouldn't marry her if she threw herself at me.
  I'm finished with women. Nosey. They are just vampires and bloodsuckers.
  Besides," he says, " what's beauty I If I was the Prime Minister I would have
  a law passed stopping women from showing their faces. It would give the plain
  ones a chance. The only difference between the plainest woman in the world
  and the ugliest woman, is her face. Has that ever struck you. Nosey?"</p>

  <p>I told him it had. It was curious how Sam was able to put into words
  thoughts that had been in your mind for years without your being able to
  express them.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose I shall ever be Prime Minister, " said Sam. "Politics I
  have never understood, and never shall."</p>

  <p>"You won't miss much," says I.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose I shall," says Sam, "but it must be rather wonderful
  being a Prime Minister and having all the swells tell you when their horses
  are going to win, and when they're not trying."</p>

  <p>He got String of Beans to Newmarket, or rather at a little place between
  Royston and Newmarket, and on the day of the race we walked him over to the
  course.</p>

  <p>Sam had made his plans. He was going into Tattersalls' ring, wait for the
  market to be formed, and then sail in and back String of Beans with all the
  money we had. Bisher was going to look after the horse in the paddock and
  give him his feed, whilst the previous race was being run and nobody was
  about; and I was going into the " silver ring" to put on as much money as I
  could bet before the price came tumbling down.</p>

  <p>We were walking across the Heath when we overtook the captain and Miss
  Virginia; I thought she was looking very worried. Sam took off his hat like a
  gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Baring," she said; "perhaps you will help me to try and
  persuade Captain Tarbot&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The captain was a bit annoyed, I think, but she went on.</p>

  <p>"Captain Tarbot is going to put a thousand pounds on his horse; I think
  that is madness, don't you, Mr. Baring?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Sam, very firm. "If he had two thousand pounds he ought
  to put it on that horse; it is one of the finest horses that I have ever seen
  in a selling plate. The only danger is, that he may not be able to afford to
  bid up at the auction to buy it in. That horse," he says, "will fetch at
  least a thousand pounds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If it wins," says the girl. "But suppose it doesn't win&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sam sort of smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is humanly impossible for that horse not to win, Miss Virginia," he
  says. "I speak as a sportsman and a man of the world, and I tell you that
  though funny things happen in racing, I never expect to see anything so comic
  as that horse not winning. I have been looking up his pedigree, and I say
  that it is a sin and a shame that a horse of that class and character should
  be running in a selling plate. But be that as it may, miss," he says, "you
  couldn't stop him winning unless you built a wall across the course, and even
  then he'd jump it."</p>

  <p>"You hear, my dear?" says the captain. "Mr. Baring understands these
  things."</p>

  <p>"So does father," she says obstinately, "and he says that Blue Rat is only
  a moderate horse, and if there is anything in the race that can gallop, your
  horse will be beaten."</p>

  <p>"With all due respect to the major," says Sam, "and a nicer man and more
  perfect gentleman I have never met, and highly educated too&mdash;he is not
  up to date if he says that this horse, Blue Rat, isn't the best performer he
  has ever trained. I'll tell you what I'll do&mdash;I'll give you a thousand
  pounds for that horse as he stands, if you will let me run him and give me
  the market for myself."</p>

  <p>It was very handsome of Sam, but he knew that the captain wouldn't accept.
  Even the young lady was impressed.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she says; "I suppose you know best," and that was the end of
  the conversation, for soon after we left them.</p>

  <p>At the last minute Sam changed his plans and sent Bisher into the ring to
  back the horse, whilst he went into the paddock to give String of Beans his
  final preparation. I was in the "silver ring" when String of Beans went down
  to the post. He went down, first on his hind legs, then on his front legs,
  then all his legs together, and I could see by the way he was doing circles
  in the middle of the course that the Indian Magic was worth all the fifty
  pounds that Sam had given to Mr. Dhobi.</p>

  <p>String of Beans was a good favorite; by the time I had finished backing
  him, he was at five to two; I had the curiosity to inquire the price of Blue
  Rat before I went into Tattersalls and joined Bisher and Sam. Blue Rat was at
  six to one, and was still six to one when I climbed the stand to where Sam
  and Bisher were standing.</p>

  <p>"How did he go down?" says Sam.</p>

  <p>"Fine," I says. "Look at him, he's still waltzing."</p>

  <p>"I gave him a double dose," says Sam in a low voice. "We can't afford to
  take any risks."</p>

  <p>"He certainly went down like a high-spirited thoroughbred," says
  Bisher.</p>

  <p>"Have you got the money on?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Sam nodded.</p>

  <p>"This is money from home, Nosey," he says. "You have never in your life
  had a chance of collecting wealth so easily. "When I look down at those
  bookmakers," he says, "I have a sort of feeling of sorrow for them. Little do
  they know as they stand there, howling their blinking heads off, that in a
  few minutes their vast and capacious pockets will be emptied into my hat. I
  think we'll go to London tonight to celebrate," he says. "There's a new show
  on at the Palladium, and I have engaged the Royal box."</p>

  <p>It was a very long time before the race started. String of Beans, being
  slightly the worse for Indian Magic, thought the winning-post was in the
  other direction, and wouldn't turn his head to the tape. And when he did, he
  started teaching the other horses a new classy step he 'd learnt, and they
  began imitating him. Then he tried to walk about on his hind legs, like one
  of those horses you see in the British Museum, but at last they got his head
  right and up went the tape.</p>

  <p>You could see Sam's blue-and-pink jacket very plainly, for the sun was
  shining, and before the field had gone a furlong. String of Beans was lobbing
  along in front, about ten lengths ahead of anything.</p>

  <p>"There ought to be a statue put up to the man who found this Indian
  Magic," says Sam, and we both agreed with him.</p>

  <p>Before they got to Bushes Hill, String of Beans was twenty lengths in
  front, with Blue Rat about five lengths in front of anything else.</p>

  <p>I looked round the stand, not expecting to find the captain, because he,
  being a swell, should have been in the members' enclosure; but there he was,
  and the young lady, and her face was the color of chalk.</p>

  <p>Coming down Bushes Hill, String of Beans, striding out like a lion, was a
  half a furlong in front, and even if he dropped dead, the speed he was going
  would have carried him past the winning-post. But he didn't drop dead. He
  sailed past the winning-post at forty miles an hour, and the smile on Sam's
  face was a pleasure to see.</p>

  <p>We waited, and we had to wait a long time, for the second, which was Blue
  Rat, to get past the judge's box, and then Sam says:</p>

  <p>"Come on, boys, let's lead him in."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," says Bisher; "he hasn't stopped yet."</p>

  <p>String of Beans ought to have turned off to the left and gone into the
  paddock, and we could see the jockey pulling his head off, but the reins
  weren't made that could hold String of Beans that day. He went over the
  heath, and we watched him on the skyline as he sud-deny swerved to the right,
  and went galloping across the heath in the direction of Cambridge. Then he
  swerved again, and came back toward Newmarket town. After that we didn't see
  him. By all accounts he went through Newmarket town, turned down a side
  street, dashed through a kitchen garden on to a tennis lawn, taking the net
  like a steeple- chaser, through a field, back to the Royston Road, and about
  half an hour later was stopped by two policemen in Cambridge.</p>

  <p>I must say the Stewards were very decent. They waited twenty minutes for
  String of Beans to come back, and it was only after somebody had telephoned
  that he had been seen racing a Ford car on the Cambridge Road, that they
  disqualified him and gave the race to Blue Rat.</p>

  <p>It was the double handful of Indian Magic that had done it. "We reckoned
  afterwards that with one handful the jockey would have pulled him up within a
  mile of Newmarket, and he'd have got back in time for the jockey to have
  weighed in.</p>

  <p>Dhobi promised to meet Sam after the race, but he didn't turn up. Sam
  spent all the evening looking for him.</p>

  <h2><a id="story06"
     name="story06">6. ESTABLISHING CHARLES BULLIVANT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"There's a new doctor at "Willough Lodge," said Sir James
  Colebroke, Lord of the Manor of Kingsbeach and acknowledged sovereign of the
  town of Saxmonleigh.</p>

  <p>"Poor devil!" said his son. "Is he anybody I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sir James, an arbiter in such matters, shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He has bought Tillingworth's practice," he said ominously&mdash;and
  really little more need be said.</p>

  <p>For Tillingworth had been an eccentric man who had no practice.
  Tillingworth, with his long, untidy beard and his long, untidy hair, had
  occupied the dilapidated Willough Lodge, a stuccoed edifice at the
  unfashionable end of the High Street, for fourteen years, during which period
  he may have seen a few casual patients of the lower or agricultural orders,
  but certainly he had never been called in by the aristocracy and the no less
  exclusive bourgeoisie of Saxmonleigh.</p>

  <p>Neither Dr. Walford-Sole, that prince of county physicians, nor Dr. Green-
  Sanders, a profound and learned man who was a justice of the peace and
  reputedly wealthy, nor yet Mr. Salicon, the surgeon (who was also a
  consultant in Harley Street), had ever called Dr. Tillingworth in
  consultation.</p>

  <p>They had been called by him on two occasions when the disease requiring
  diagnosis was delirium tremens, and the patient was the unfortunate
  Tillingworth himself. One of these, Walford-Sole, had signed the death
  certificate of the late Tillingworth and had only refrained from certifying
  the cause as "chronic alcoholism" for the honor and the dignity of the
  profession.</p>

  <p>Tillingworth had a sister and a brother, the latter a sober but
  unscrupulous man who offered "an old-established practice which needs working
  up" at a sacrificial price.</p>

  <p>It was purchased by a young man who was content to pay cash down and was
  loftily contemptuous of such mundane matters as "books." He had supreme
  confidence in himself&mdash;a confidence which survived his arrival in
  Saxmonleigh by exactly forty-eight hours.</p>

  <p>A tall, good-looking young man, tanned brown with tropical suns&mdash;he
  had served for three years as surgeon in the Oriental mail-boat
  fleet&mdash;he gazed approvingly upon the picturesque but insanitary cottages
  which flank the station road. They appealed at once to the artistic side of
  him and to his proper professional instincts.</p>

  <p>Willough Lodge was a shock. The furniture of the house (at valuation) left
  him gasping, and the disorder of the weed-grown garden and the ragged lawns
  had brought him to the edge of despair. But he was very young and possessed
  immense reserves of enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>There was a girl in London for whom these lawns must be mowed, these rank
  beds of dandelion cultivated, these damp walls made sound and beautiful.</p>

  <p>For three weeks, aided by discouraging plumbers, tragic paper-hangers of
  uncertain quality, and a most pessimistic collection of jobbing gardeners, he
  labored at Willough Lodge. He hoped nobody would call until his work was
  finished; he prayed that the distraction of consultation and minor operations
  would not intervene between him and his task, and his prayer was
  answered.</p>

  <p>It never left off being answered.</p>

  <p>Two months passed, and the garden was a riot of flowers and sweet-scented
  herbs; the windows blazed red and yellow with geranium and calceolaria; but
  the imported brass knocker never trembled to the touch of the wealthy
  invalids of Saxmonleigh, and there came to him no greater sustenance than a
  few precarious shillings drawn at rare intervals from fustian pockets.</p>

  <p>The aristocracy did not call, though the tradespeople did&mdash;but chose
  the servants^ entrance, conducting their business in their proper sphere. And
  although they sold or endeavored to sell their wares, varying between corn
  for the horse he did not possess and printing which he did not require, they
  never invited him to sell them any portion of his seven years' experience at
  University College Hospital.</p>

  <p>"It is absolutely hopeless&mdash;hopeless!"</p>

  <p>His hands were thrust into his trousers pockets, his feet were stuck
  stiffly in the direction of Gould Mortimer's flower-filled fireplace.</p>

  <p>His brother-in-law-to-be looked down on him with an unsympathetic
  grin.</p>

  <p>Gould Mortimer was a tall, brown, healthy-colored young man, who was
  remembered at Harvard as Big Mort, and, since a thrifty and ingenious parent
  had provided for his future, he was apt to underrate the tragedy of
  failure.</p>

  <p>"Why, Charles," he laughed, "you go on as if it mattered to Maisie or me
  whether you made a two hundred a month or whether you lived on your two
  hundred a year. See here: you sit down in the old town and just wait for the
  other medicine men to die. Gosh! they can't live for ever!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Charles Bullivant shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You don't grub-stake me, Gould," he said quietly. "I want to marry Maisie
  just as much as any man can want anything and still live to tell the tale,
  but I marry on an assured income earned by myself and not on
  charity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Haw!" ejaculated the disgusted Gould, "cut it right out!"</p>

  <p>"Charity," persisted the other firmly. "Why, you old philanthropist, you
  found the money for the practice. You were swindled, and so was I&mdash;but
  you found it. No; I've got to break into Saxmonleigh society in some way
  other."</p>

  <p>The door opened and a girl burst in.</p>

  <p>She was, to Charles Bullivant's prejudiced eyes, the one girl in the world
  by whom Nature might set its standard for all time. Tall, slender, with a
  perfect figure and the loveliest face that ever captivated a none too
  susceptible ship's doctor.</p>

  <p>"Come and play tennis." She tapped the young doctor's head with the net of
  her racket. "What is wrong?" she asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"It's the practice," said her brother, who had suddenly assumed the face
  of doom. "Nothin' doing down Saxmonleigh way; shocking state of health
  amongst the dud does of the village, shocking state of apathy amongst the
  gouty dowagers up town&mdash;everything on the shady side."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to grouse," said the young doctor, taking the fingers
  surreptitiously extended in his direction, "but nobody seems to want me
  there&mdash;you see, I'm nobody&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"0h, nonsense!" said the girl indignantly. ""Why, everybody knows you're
  splendid! You cured my headache in a minute&mdash;in the Red Sea, too."</p>

  <p>Charles caught the smothered smile of Gould Mortimer, and smiled
  sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"None of my patients have headaches," he said ruefully. "They are the
  exclusive County&mdash;and I am a London nobody. That is all there is to
  it."</p>

  <p>The girl laid her hand upon the curly head now bowed in dejection. Then
  she suddenly clapped her hands gleefully.</p>

  <p>"I've got it!" she said, and her pretty face was pink with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Got&mdash;?" began her puzzled brother.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" she said, and ran to his desk. They watched her as her swift pen
  covered sheet after sheet of paper in the big, sprawling hand which had been
  the despair of her Boston teachers.</p>

  <p>"There!" she said, blotting the last sheet, and handed to Gould the
  effort.</p>

  <p>He read it in silence and passed it to the young medico, and the girl,
  with her hands behind her back, waited.</p>

  <p>Charles Bullivant read:</p>

  <p class="letter">Are you ill?</p>

  <p class="letter">Do you want to be treated in the old-fashioned way, which
  is fifty years behind the times?</p>

  <p class="letter">Or do you wish to be cured by the methods of modern science
  as exemplified by</p>

  <p class="letter">CHARLES BULLIVANT,</p>

  <p class="letter">the up-to-date doctor of medicine, the experienced
  surgeon.</p>

  <p class="letter">Don't take a chance! Take Charles!</p>

  <p class="letter">Watch Yourself Grow Better!</p>

  <p class="letter">Call on me any hour of the day or night&mdash;I shall be
  waiting for you.</p>

  <p class="letter">Note the address: Willough Lodge, (Look for the house with
  the pink curtains.)</p>

  <p>"You see," she said eagerly, "we can put that in all the local papers. I
  learned advertisement-writing by correspondence," she explained proudly. "It
  was awful good fun&mdash;and that's just how " She stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>There was a pained look on the faces of the two young men&mdash;the
  exquisite pain of men who are trying not to laugh.</p>

  <p>"It won't do, sister," gasped Gould Mortimer. "It's fine&mdash;it's grand,
  but it's&mdash;it's verboten! It's&mdash;oh, heavens!"</p>

  <p>She looked from one to the other, disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I think you're both horrid!" she flared, and marched out of the room.</p>

  <p>A roar of laughter, too loud for the door to muffle, brought her back with
  a flaming face and eyes that glittered ominously.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why are you laughing?" she demanded coldly.</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;he tickled me," lied her brother.</p>

  <p>It was a lame excuse as the slamming door testified.</p>

  <p>"Something has to be done," said Gould, limp and exhausted. "I'm coming
  down to stay a day or two in Saxmonleigh."</p>

  <p>"It's no use, Mort," groaned the depressed young man. "They won't let me
  in. You see, I've got a wrong impression of my own value. Yes&mdash;yes, I
  have." He silenced the other's protest fiercely. "It comes of having been a
  popular ship doctor and having hobnobbed with royalties on board ship. If I
  were to go round Saxmonleigh," he said bitterly, "with the signed photograph
  of a viceroy in one hand and an autographed letter from a crown prince in the
  other, and my chest covered with the little decorations that royal travelers
  chuck about instead of tips, I might have a chance."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you?" asked the innocent Mortimer. "I should."</p>

  <p>"Don't rot," pleaded the other.</p>

  <p>But Gould Mortimer was really serious.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Sir James Colebroke had a suspicious twinge in his left toe and telephoned
  to Green- Sanders, and that great man motored over to Highhouse to see his
  distinguished patient and tell him, as he had told him some forty times in
  the past twenty years, to avoid old brandy and to take more exercise.</p>

  <p>"How's that youngster doing?" asked Sir James, after complaint and remedy
  had been punctiliously exchanged.</p>

  <p>"Which youngster?"</p>

  <p>"What's his name&mdash;the doctor?"</p>

  <p>Green-Sanders shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Poor man, I'm afraid he's doing nothing. He has a house-party this
  week&mdash;rather a pretty girl and her brother."</p>

  <p>Sir James grunted.</p>

  <p>People did not have house-parties outside the charmed circle of the County
  society&mdash;they merely had folk to stay with them.</p>

  <p>"He's an outsider&mdash;knows nobody in the County. Why the devil he
  doesn't chuck up the sponge and go back to London, I don't know," he said
  irritably. He had caused it to be conveyed to Dr. Charles Bullivant that he
  might expect from Highhouse no encouragement to extend his visit to
  Saxmonleigh. The fact that Dr. Charles Bullivant had, in a fit of
  exasperation, not only ignored the hint, but had expressed his opinion of the
  County society in coarse terms, was sufficient to establish him in the County
  Index.</p>

  <p>"I met the young man who is staying with him," remarked Green-Sanders
  casually. "Came down in the same smoker&mdash;pleasant person, but
  American."</p>

  <p>A look of understanding came to Sir James' face.</p>

  <p>"American!" he said significantly. "0f course, if he's one of those Anglo-
  American people, he'll never do."</p>

  <p>It was one of those vague but portentous nothings which the Lord of the
  Manor indulged in occasionally.</p>

  <p>"If you see his friend&mdash;as you might&mdash;you would be rendering Dr.
  What 's-his- name a service if you suggested that he goes back to London. He
  is not wanted here, and that's the end of it."</p>

  <p>Dr. Green-Sanders shared with his fellow-practitioners a resentment for
  what he regarded as an unwarrantable intrusion on the part of Charles
  Bullivant. That same afternoon he met a very elated Gould Mortimer emerging
  from the printer's shop in the High Street. Gould would have passed on with a
  nod, but Green-Sanders detained him with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to speak to you, Mr. Mortimer," he said. "I think we introduced
  one another in the train the other day."</p>

  <p>Gould was all attention. His big, homely face beamed down benevolence on
  the withered little doctor.</p>

  <p>"Sure," he said, with a vigorous nod.</p>

  <p>"You're a friend of Bullivant's, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Mortimer again.</p>

  <p>The doctor smiled tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"Well, you know, Mr. Mortimer," he said, "our friend is up against
  it&mdash;that is the expression, isnt it?"</p>

  <p>"It's one I've heard," agreed Big Mort cautiously.</p>

  <p>"He's up against a very disappointing combination of circumstances," said
  Green-Sanders soothingly. "Why doesn't a young man like that try his luck
  somewhere else?"</p>

  <p>Gould Mortimer smiled largely and amusedly.</p>

  <p>"Why should he!" he asked.</p>

  <p>"What chance has he here?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>"A mighty good chance," said Big Mort earnestly. "Why, see here, Dr.
  Green- Sanders, somebody has got to get your practice when you're dead."</p>

  <p>"When I'm dead?" gasped the shocked medico.</p>

  <p>"Sure," responded the visitor, "you can't go living round here for ever,
  can you? You've got to die sometime, I guess, and that's just where old man
  Charles Bullivant gets his chance."</p>

  <p>Dr. Green-Sanders drew himself up.</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you, Mr. Mortimer," he said stiffly, "that Saxmonleigh has
  failed to take your friend to its bosom: he has no more chance of getting
  along here than&mdash;than&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was at a loss for a simile, so he contented himself with shrugging his
  shoulders. This he did with such vigor that his top hat fell off, was neatly
  fielded by Mortimer, and restored with some loss of dignity to the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to hear you say all that stuff about Charles," said the
  resourceful American, with elaborate regret. "I guess he'll have to go back
  to Spain."</p>

  <p>"Spain?"</p>

  <p>Mortimer nodded.</p>

  <p>"He's some doctor in Spain," he said mysteriously.</p>

  <p>That afternoon Dr. Charles Bullivant departed for London at Mortimer's
  urgent request.</p>

  <p>"Stay in my house for a week," said Big Mort, "and don't read the
  newspapers."</p>

  <p>"But why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why me no whys, but be wise," quoted Gould Mortimer musically. "Get a
  wiggle on you&mdash;you'll lose that train."</p>

  <p>"But suppose I'm called in," protested the reluctant young doctor.</p>

  <p>"I'll go," said the other promptly. "Under the present circumstances you
  aren't likely to be called in an^n^here&mdash;except for a bet."</p>

  <p>Still the young man was not satisfied, and Mortimer eyed him sternly.</p>

  <p>"You're mighty unwilling to get away from here," he said. "This two-
  cylinder village is surely attractive&mdash;but you can't take her with you
  because I want her help."</p>

  <p>The "she" referred to stood behind her brother and out of the range of his
  vision, so she was safe in making the little grimace with which she favored
  the back of his head.</p>

  <p>Dr. Bullivant blushed and went off to London, horribly perturbed, for he
  knew his Gould Mortimer.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had his train disappeared out of sight when Mr. Tagge, the local
  bill- poster, proceeded with his commission. "Wherever it was possible to
  fly- post a bill upon a fence or tree trunk, that bill was posted. Wherever a
  shop expressed its willingness to display the notice, that shop was liberally
  supplied.</p>

  <p>The tiny placard appeared at frequent intervals along the High Street, in
  every shop in Church Street and Cathedral Row. It was tacked to the uprights
  of the stalls in Market Square; it was (crowning infamy) even displayed
  blandly upon the notice-boards of St. Helen's and St. Asaph's&mdash;by
  permission of the Vicar.</p>

  <p>People stopped in the street to read it. Farmers reined up their carts to
  gather its import. Sir James Colebroke descended from his car, in full view
  of the town, to read the announcement in Suggett's window.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" said Sir James in perplexity, and went home to lunch, very
  thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"Wherever men met in the Borough Town of Saxmonleigh, they prefaced their
  comments on the Government or the crops or the weather with:</p>

  <p>"Have you read that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In the morning of the following day, the Vicar of St. Asaph's called and
  asked whether Dr. Bullivant would call and see his wife's throat.</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry," said the genial Mr. Mortimer, "but my friend has been
  called in to an important case in London."</p>

  <p>""When he comes back&mdash;ah," said the Vicar.</p>

  <p>"When he comes back," agreed Big Mort gravely.</p>

  <p>Whilst the Vicar was walking down the drive to the road, Big Mort was
  dancing uncouthly on the mat, to the scandal of his sister.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later Colonel "Westinghouse's victoria drove up the drive,
  and the Colonel, an irascible man, swore gently at the door till it
  opened.</p>

  <p>"Doctor in?" he demanded explosively.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Big Mort.</p>

  <p>"When'll he be in!" rapped the Colonel.</p>

  <p>"How the devil do I know!" replied Mortimer, who spoke the language very
  well.</p>

  <p>"Woof, woof!" said the Colonel, or something of the sort. "Where's
  he!"</p>

  <p>"He's in town," said Mortimer deliberately; "at this moment he is removing
  the appendix of an ambassador."</p>

  <p>"Then come and see me&mdash;Green-Sanders&mdash;an ass&mdash;old Tingumy-
  jig's ass too&mdash; Colonel Wes'nlane, Merrut Lodge&mdash;'morning."</p>

  <p>"M'n'g," responded Big Mort, not to be outdone in the matter of
  contraction.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Grayling called about her daughter's earache at two o 'clock. At
  half- past, came Lady Visey-Fane, the relict&mdash;she always called herself
  "relict," being an earnest student of regal phraseology&mdash;of the late Sir
  William Visey- Fane (born Visey, and Fane adopted by deed poll). Lady Visey-
  Fane wanted somebody to try her heart.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Bullivant is in London," explained Mortimer. "You have probably read
  in the papers that a Certain Personage is in Town!"</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," said Lady Visey-Fane graciously. "Will you ask him,
  on his return, to call! I have no regular medical attendant."</p>

  <p>Dr. Green-Sanders went uninvited to Sir James Colebroke.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that that infernal man has already taken four of my best
  patients," he said bitterly. "Never, my dear Sir James, have I seen anything
  so drivelling, so sycophantic, so horribly contemptible as the attitude of
  these people."</p>

  <p>But his wrath awoke no enthusiasm in the breast of his host, and something
  like a cold chill struck at the heart of the little doctor.</p>

  <p>"Well, you know," said Sir James tolerantly, " there must be something in
  him &mdash;I mean, there's no sense in blinding oneself to facts; people like
  to be associated with&mdash;er&mdash;the great ones of the earth&mdash;even
  remotely associated. For myself," he spread out his hands in
  self-depreciation, "I am human; what is good enough
  for&mdash;er&mdash;Certain Exalted Personage is good enough for me."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean?" began the horror-stricken doctor.</p>

  <p>"I mean," said Sir James stoutly, "I mean I should like you to call him in
  over this question of my&mdash;er&mdash;gout."</p>

  <p>Had an anarchist dropped a cartload of petro-glycerine on the bald head of
  Dr. Green-Sanders, he could not have been more astounded.</p>

  <p>"Phoo!" he snorted, "your gout!"</p>

  <p>He said no more, but stalked from the drawing-room of Highhouse, never to
  return. That night he declined an invitation to dine with the relict&mdash;a
  fatal blunder, since it was an olive branch extended by a lady who had broken
  through convention and was scared to death at her own temerity.</p>

  <p>For three days Charles Bullivant chafed and fretted in the big house in
  Onslow Gardens, which Gould Mortimer called "home," reading nothing more
  amusing than <i>Tackitt on Fracture</i>, which light reading he had brought
  for his entertainment.</p>

  <p>He arrived at Saxmonleigh late at night, and thought that the solitary
  porter who carried his bag to the station fly was unusually deferential.</p>

  <p>He paused in the hall of his house to look at his letters, and was
  astounded to discover that he had quite a budget&mdash;mostly local.</p>

  <p>Maisie flew down the stairs to greet him.</p>

  <p>"Everything is splendid!" she cried, as she hugged him gleefully; "you're
  going to be a great practitioner. Oh, Charles, I'm just delighted!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Charles Bullivant looked at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"What has happened? Is old Green-Sanders dead!" he asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>"He's out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gould, from the landing above, an unheroic figure in a smoking-jacket and
  slippers, conveyed the information through a large cigar.
  "Out&mdash;Green&mdash;out the other two guys. You're It&mdash;you're the
  first medicine man that the tribe of Saxmonleigh... Come up and paint the
  wigwam red."</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it. What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>The young doctor was blundering through his correspondence as well as a
  man could whose one arm was occupied by a girl. "A11 these blight&mdash;all
  these good people want me to call. Here's an invitation from Sir James
  himself!"</p>

  <p>He stared up at the calm figure in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"What devil's work have you been up to?" he demanded suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Come up and smoke," responded the diplomatic Gould.</p>

  <p>He left the two alone together, and after an unconscionable time he heard
  the flying feet of Bullivant ascending the stairs to his bedroom. Maisie came
  up to the drawing-room more leisurely.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing gained by your doctor dashing upstairs at fifty miles
  per," grumbled Gould as the girl came in. "He can't make up the time he's
  lost in the hall. What the dickens you find to talk about, I don't know."</p>

  <p>"I hope you will one of these days," said the flushed girl, and rumpled
  his hair in passing.</p>

  <p>They waited with an exchange of glances till they heard the footsteps
  descending the stairs again&mdash;no less hurriedly. Charles Bullivant was
  really agitated as he came into the room.</p>

  <p>"Mort," he said, "I've been robbed!"</p>

  <p>"Robbed?" cried the shocked pair together.</p>

  <p>"Somebody has been in my room," said young Dr. Bullivant rapidly, "and
  cleared out all the things I value most&mdash;except your portrait, darling.
  The brutes had the grace to leave that."</p>

  <p>"What have you lost?" asked Big Mort. He was disgracefully calm in face of
  the catastrophe.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell for the moment," said Charles, with a worried frown, "but a
  little case with the Order of Isabella la Catholica is gone&mdash;the young
  King gave me that when we carried him from Vigo to Malaga; a portrait of the
  Crown Prince, signed; the Order of St. Stephanie, that the Grand Duke Basil
  gave me when we were taking him to India&mdash;oh, Lord, lots of things!"</p>

  <p>Gould Mortimer removed his cigar.</p>

  <p>"I was the first to discover the robbery," he said solemnly. "You did not
  imagine that anybody could rob this house and me not know it? Sir, I have
  been on the track of those robbers; I have moved my artillery against the
  brigands."</p>

  <p>He rose and went to a desk, opened a drawer, and took out a printed sheet.
  Dr. Charles Bullivant was the only soul in Saxmonleigh who had not seen it.
  It ran:</p>

  <p class="note">£50 REWARD</p>

  <p class="note">LOST OR STOLEN</p>

  <p class="note">The undermentioned articles were either left in the train
  between London and Saxmonleigh or removed from the residence of Dr. Charles
  Bullivant, Willough Lodge, Saxmonleigh.</p>

  <p class="note">1. The medallion and ribbon of the Order of Isabella la
  Catholica: engraved "From Alfonso to Charles Bullivant, in Memory of a
  Pleasant Association."</p>

  <p class="note">2. A signed photograph of the Crown Prince of Mid-Europe,
  signed "Wilhelm Kron-Prinz."</p>

  <p class="note">3. The Order of St. Stephanie in brilliants, and framed
  portrait of the Grand Duke Basil, inscribed "Mille remerciments, Basil."</p>

  <p class="note">4. Photographic group (signed) in gold frame of Dr.
  Bullivant, the Prince of the Asturias, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the
  Crown Prince of Mid-Europe, and the Grand Duchess Maria.</p>

  <p class="note">5. The freehold deeds of Willough Lodge.</p>

  <p class="note">Information leading to the recovery of these should be lodged
  at the County Police Station, or to Dr. Charles Bullivant, by whom the above
  reward will be paid.</p>

  <p>The doctor read it again, his hand to his brow.</p>

  <p>"It is all right," said Gould, and patted the shoulder of the other. "The
  bag containing these sacred goods was returned anonymously tonight."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but I don't understand," said the doctor. "0f course, those
  things were mine, and I'm jolly glad to get them&mdash;but the deeds of this
  house; I only rent this place."</p>

  <p>Big Mort smiled at his sister.</p>

  <p>"That's all right&mdash;all right," he said easily. "The freehold is my
  wedding gift."</p>

  <p>Dr. Charles Bullivant looked first at the notice in his hand, then at the
  pile of correspondence which lay on the table, and a slow light dawned upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"Which of you two was the burglar?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The girl laughed. "That's a secret," she said. "I only drew up the
  advertisement."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story07"
     name="story07">7. THE CAT BURGLAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Old Tom Burkes used to say to Elsah, his daughter: "Easy
  grabbing is good grabbing. Nobody was ever ruined by taking small
  profits."</p>

  <p>After his eighth whisky old Tom was rather oracular. He would sit before
  the fire in the shabby little dining-room at Elscombe Crescent (Mayfair by
  telephone, Bayswater by bus), and pass across such cultured pearls of
  wisdom.</p>

  <p>"You can't expect millionaires to marry&mdash;especially if they've been
  married before. This Poynting's got money and a family. Families are always a
  just cause an' impediment. If he wants to make you happy by givin' me a
  directorship&mdash;let him."</p>

  <p>So that when, in a moment of mental aberration, Colonel J. C. Poynting
  pressed upon her for acceptance the emerald bar which caused all the trouble,
  Elsah accepted. She made some faint protest... One shouldn't (she murmured)
  accept such a present even from so dear a friend unless... unless...</p>

  <p>Colonel Poynting did not fill the gap. He was an infatuated old gentleman,
  but for the moment infatuation was held in check by an uneasy-sense of
  family.</p>

  <p>"You'd better insure that," said Elsah's wise father. "It's worth three
  thousand if it is worth a cent."</p>

  <p>Prudently, Elsah followed his advice&mdash;which was also unfortunate.</p>

  <p>Most unfortunate of all, a few weeks later Colonel Poynting very nervously
  requested her to return the bar&mdash;his daughter had asked to see it... he
  would return it to Elsah.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said her cynical parent.</p>

  <p>That night the bar was stolen. It was taken from her dressing-table by
  some person or persons unknown. This information she conveyed to the Colonel
  by express letter. The Colonel replied in person, arriving in a taxi and a
  state of nervous perspiration. Accompanying him was a detective.</p>

  <p>And that was where the real trouble started. For the detective asked
  horrid questions, and Elsah wept pitifully, and the Colonel not only
  comforted her but proposed marriage. On the whole, it would have been better
  if he had been content with the loss of the emeralds.</p>

  <p>Now, here is a point for all mystery-mongers to note. Up to the moment the
  loss of the emerald bar was reported. Miss Dorothy Poynting had never
  considered Elsah as anything more than a safe dancing partner for fathers,
  and knew nothing whatever about the bar having been given to that
  enterprising lady.</p>

  <p>The two shocks came almost simultaneously. Dorothy Poynting's reactions to
  the announcement were rather inhuman and wholly at variance with Colonel
  Poynting's ideas of what a daughter's attitude should be when he
  condescends&mdash;there is no other word for it, or at any rate the Colonel
  could find no other word&mdash;to inform her that he contemplated marrying
  again.</p>

  <p>He told her this at dinner, stammering and coughing and talking quite
  fiercely at moments, though at other moments he was pleading.</p>

  <p>"She's rather young, but she's a real good sort. If you feel... um...that
  you'd be happier away... elsewhere... living somewhere else, you can have the
  flat in Portland Place, and of course Sonningstead is yours..."</p>

  <p>Dorothy surveyed her father thoughtfully. He was good-looking, in a
  way&mdash;pink of skin, white-haired, slim, invariably tailor-right. She
  wished he was fat; there is nothing quite as effective as a noticeable
  rotundity for reducing the conscious ego.</p>

  <p>He was very vain about his waist and his small feet and nicely modeled
  hands. They were twiddling now with the spotless gardenia in his
  buttonhole.</p>

  <p>"Elsah Burkes is a dear girl," defiantly. "You may not like her: I hardly
  expected that you would. It is a tremendous compliment to me that she should,
  so to speak, sacrifice her&mdash;um&mdash;youth..."</p>

  <p>"It may also be a tremendous compliment to the Poynting Traction Company,"
  said Dorothy gently.</p>

  <p>He was infuriated. He told her so. He was so mild a man that she had no
  other means of knowing.</p>

  <p>"I'm simply furious with you! Because a gel's poor... I'm sorry I
  consulted you..."</p>

  <p>She smiled at this. How annoyingly she could smile! And she dusted her
  white georgette lap before she rose, took a cigarette from the table and lit
  it.</p>

  <p>"Dear old darling," she said, waving the smoking thing airily, "would you
  have told me if you had not to explain how dear Elsah came to be robbed of a
  large emerald bar&mdash;mother's bar? You had to explain that
  away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no need whatever " he began, with well-modulated violence.</p>

  <p>She waved him to comparative quiet.</p>

  <p>"It was in all the newspapers. The moment I saw that Elsah had lost an
  emerald bar I was suspicious. When I saw the photographs, I knew. With all
  your money, daddy, you might have bought her a bushel of emeralds. It was
  intensely heartless and vulgar to give away a jewel that was my mother's.
  That is all." She flicked ash into the fireplace. "Also&mdash;don't get vexed
  with me&mdash;it was singularly prudent of Elsah to insure the bar the moment
  it came into her possession."</p>

  <p>"You are going too far," said her father in his awful voice.</p>

  <p>"As far as Portland Place, if you go on with this absurd marriage. Or
  perhaps I'll go out into the world and do something romantic, such as work
  for my living."</p>

  <p>John Venner came in at that moment. Elsah and he arrived together.</p>

  <p>She was rather tall and Junoesque&mdash;which means on the way to
  plumpness&mdash;red- haired, white-skinned, flashing-eyed.</p>

  <p>"That woman," said Dorothy, in a critical mood, "has made radiance a
  public nuisance."</p>

  <p>She said this to John Venner: he was rather charitable. Nothing quite
  exasperates a woman so much as misapplied charity. And it is invariably
  misapplied when employed in the defense of another woman.</p>

  <p>John was a Guardsman, a nicely mannered young man who had so much money
  that he could never marry well.</p>

  <p>"I think you're deuced unkind to old Elsah," he said.</p>

  <p>With difficulty Dorothy remembered that she was a lady.</p>

  <p>Elsah had similar views. She asked her future step-daughter whether they
  might go to Dorothy's bedroom and have a real heart-to-heart talk. Dorothy
  checked an inclination to suggest the meat pantry.</p>

  <p>"Because you see, darling"&mdash;Elsah sat picturesquely on the bed and
  exhibited her nice legs&mdash;"I must get right with you! I know you loathe
  me, and I told Clarence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who's Clarence?" asked the dazed Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"Your dear daddy," cooed Elsah.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Dorothy, shocked. "I never realized that! Well, you told
  Clarence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elsah swallowed something.</p>

  <p>"I told your dear father that he mustn't expect you to... well..."</p>

  <p>"Hang out the flags?" suggested Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"That's rather vulgar, isn't it!" Elsah would not have been human if she
  had failed to protest. "I do hope you and I are going to be great friends.
  Won't you come round and dine one night with father and me? He's such a
  dear..."</p>

  <p>All that sort of stuff.</p>

  <p>Dorothy listened and wondered, as Elsah told her of the terrible shock it
  had been to her when she found the bar had vanished, and of what perfect
  dears the insurance people had been. She had no intention then of calling on
  Elsah or her father. Two days later, without rhyme or reason, she made her
  appearance at Elscombe Crescent. Elsah was out, but her plump father was
  in.</p>

  <p>"Cer'n'ly," murmured Mr. Burke drowsily. "Show'rin... who d'ye say
  'twas!"</p>

  <p>He had been celebrating at luncheon the forthcoming prosperity to his
  family. Conscious that somebody had come into the room, he jerked himself
  into semi- wakefulness.</p>

  <p>"Elsah, old girl," he droned, "as I've off'n said, grab whils' the
  grabbin's good."</p>

  <p>He said other things, and Dorothy stood stock-still and listened until Mr.
  Burkes began to snore.</p>

  <p>Not in dark cellars with blanketed windows and secret exits do great
  robber gangs hold their meetings; behind no tiled doors with guards within
  and without do they confer across a greasy table, with loaded revolvers and
  bright knives at hand to deal with intruders.</p>

  <p>Old Tom Burkes had never possessed a pistol in his life, and he regarded
  the employment of knives, bright or otherwise, as "foreign." He had, in his
  unregenerate youth, employed a length of lead piping on the helmeted head of
  a policeman, but he was not proud of the exploit.</p>

  <p>The robbers' cave for the moment was the rather ornate restaurant of
  Emilio, which is near to the Strand. It was a place of bright lights, in the
  rays of which silver and glass glittered on snowy napery; there were flowers
  set in rather florid German-silver cornucopias on every table, and behind the
  red plush seats that ran along the wall, large mirrors on which landscapes
  and things were painted so extensively that a lady could not see herself
  powdering her nose except by dodging between obese swans and glittering
  minarets.</p>

  <p>The robber fare was <i>crème duchesse</i>, <i>sole au bonne femme</i>, and
  <i>poulet curry au casserole</i>.</p>

  <p>Tom had black coffee to follow; Morgan, being younger and less opulent,
  seized the opportunity to order <i>pêche melba</i> at another man's
  expense.</p>

  <p>Tom fetched a plethoric sigh, tapped off the ash of his cigar into the
  coffee saucer, and made another regretful reference to "Lou."</p>

  <p>"What a woman!" he said.</p>

  <p>There was both admiration and awe in his tone. He was stout and bald. His
  red face was rather furrowed; in his prominent blue eyes at the moment was a
  hint of tragedy. Morgan, being younger, was less easily harrowed by the
  misfortune of his fellows. He was a mean-faced man of thirty, painfully thin,
  with large red hands that were mostly knuckle.</p>

  <p>"If she'd stuck by her friends," he said, "them that was her real friends,
  she'd have been out and about, havin' dinner with us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lunch," murmured Mr. Burkes. "And at the Carlton. Lou believed in the
  best. Ah!"</p>

  <p>He sighed again.</p>

  <p>There was more than a hint of sycophancy in "Slip" Morgan's attitude and
  speech. They called him "Slip" because he was slippery, and because he was so
  thin that legend had it he had once slipped through the most closely set
  steel bars that ever protected a bank vault.</p>

  <p>"Lou was thoughtless," said Tom, himself very thoughtful. "She was too
  confident. She was inclined, if I might say so, to forget her jewties. I said
  to her only a month ago: 'Lou, I want you for a big job, so keep yourself
  free- -round about New Year's Day. There's grand money in it, and I can't
  work without you.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Morgan uttered impatient sounds.</p>

  <p>"I'd have thought " he began.</p>

  <p>Tom did not want to know what he thought.</p>

  <p>"She told me she'd got a job to do for Rinsey, and I told her he was a
  careless worker, an' warned her. I gave her fifty on account&mdash;the
  money's lost, but I don't mind that, Slip&mdash;and I got to work to make the
  job sweet." He groaned, deliberately it seemed, for he took his cigar from
  his mouth. "And now, with this footman feller givin' me all I wanted, where
  the devil is Lou?"</p>

  <p>Slip hastened to supply the information.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a pie-can," said Mr. Burkes testily. "I know she's in Holloway.
  Six months ain't much, and she ought to have got a laggin'. But where'm I
  goin' to find The Gel!"</p>

  <p>Slip smiled.</p>

  <p>"It's nothin' to laugh about," said Tom. His sourness was justified.</p>

  <p>"I got her," said Slip simply.</p>

  <p>Tom removed his cigar again.</p>

  <p>"You got her?" skeptically. "Maggie Swarty or Gay Joyler or one of them
  lot! Is anybody goin' to think they're ladies? You want your head
  shaved!"</p>

  <p>"T got her," said Slip again, and added: "A lady."</p>

  <p>Tom's nose wrinkled.</p>

  <p>"What you think's a lady an' what is a lady is about the differentest
  thing that ever happened," he said.</p>

  <p>But Slip was not offended.</p>

  <p>"This one's a real lady. She's pretty and young and plays the pianner," he
  said impressively. "And she's on the crook, and is ready for anything except
  funny business."</p>

  <p>"Except what?"</p>

  <p>"Funny business&mdash;love-makin', hand-holdin', cuddlin'," said Mr.
  Morgan comprehensively.</p>

  <p>Tom looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I ain't tried," Slip was in haste to assure his superior. "One of the
  other lodgers asked her to go to the pictures. She told him to go to
  hell!"</p>

  <p>"A lady!" murmured Mr. Burkes, closing his eyes like one in pain.</p>

  <p>"She's a lady. I got sweet with the maid who looks after her room, and
  what do you think I found out?"</p>

  <p>Tom shook his head, and Slip searched in his pocket and produced
  fantastically shaped pieces of paper which he maneuvered so that they formed
  the torn half of a note-sheet.</p>

  <p>Mr. Burkes laboriously extracted his pince-nez, fixed them to his nose,
  opened his mouth (as he did when he was thus engaged), and read:</p>

  <p>"Send back the brooch, and no further action will be taken..."</p>

  <p>"Written on good paper," said Mr. Burkes, an authority on such matters,
  "by a woman&mdash;she's a maid or something. That's why you thought she was a
  lady."</p>

  <p>Slip argued with great earnestness, and in the end Tom was half convinced.
  There was an admitted difficulty as regards the approach, but Slip, a man of
  tact and resource, was confident that all obstacles would be overcome.</p>

  <p>Miss Mary Smith was not an easy proposition. Since she had taken a certain
  jewel from Elsah Burkes' dressing-table, she had been living in retirement,
  with three thousand pounds' worth of emeralds pinned, if not in the vacuity
  of her heart, on the garment which enfolded it.</p>

  <p>She had changed her lodgings as often as she had changed her name, once
  with great rapidity, when Elsah had located her and had come later, bearing
  an offer of forgiveness in exchange for the big green bar. Unfortunately, she
  did not bear the message which Mary required.</p>

  <p>It would be rather awkward, mused Mary Smith, as she sat on the edge of
  her bed in a Bloomsbury lodging, if Miss Burkes really did put the police on
  her track; but, on the other hand, how could Elsah explain certain matters...
  ?</p>

  <p>To her cogitations intruded the deferential knocking of the parlor-
  maid.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" asked Mary Smith imperiously.</p>

  <p>The maid entered.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman says could he have a few words with you?"</p>

  <p>She slid a card across the table. Mary read, and was unimpressed:</p>

  <p class="cp">Mr. Featherlow-Morgan. New Amsterdam Board of Control.</p>

  <p>There was a vagueness about Mr. Morgan's exact status which she
  overlooked. She went down to a hole in the wall of the entrance lobby [which
  was known as the lounge.</p>

  <p>Mr. Morgan understood women: shilly-shallying was a mistake that led to
  failure. He believed in the direct or knock-out method.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, miss," he said respectfully. "I'd like to have a few words
  with you."</p>

  <p>She waited.</p>

  <p>"I never beat about the bush"&mdash;Slip could not afford to lose time.
  "Heard about Miss Burkes? I'll bet you haven't! I'll bet you don't know
  her!"</p>

  <p>"You've won your bet," said Mary Smith calmly. "Aren't you awfully
  excited?"</p>

  <p>Such a response was naturally disconcerting. Happily he could cover his
  momentary confusion. He groped wildly in an inside pocket, brought out a red
  morocco case, and flicked it open. Between visiting-cards, of which he
  carried a variety, was a newspaper cutting. This he drew out and flourished
  at her.</p>

  <p>"Read that," he commanded.</p>

  <p>Mary Smith took the slip. He saw her brows gathered in a puzzled frown.
  Then she started to read aloud:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"...with every suit we present an extra pair of pants
  warranted wear-resisting..."</p>

  <p>"You're reading the wrong side of the paper," said Slip testily. She
  turned the cutting over.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The police are searching for an emerald bar, which was
  stolen from Miss Elsah Burkes' dressing-table, possibly by cat burglars, last
  week, and have circulated the following description of the missing jewelry...
  The bar is worth £3000, and the insurance underwriters are offering a reward
  of £200 for its recovery. Miss Burkes, who is engaged to be married to
  Colonel Poynting, the shipping magnate, says that although the property is
  insured, it has a sentimental value which is beyond calculation."</p>

  <p>She handed the cutting back.</p>

  <p>"Sentiment is the ruin of the leisured classes," she said, and he laughed
  admiringly. It was not a pleasant laugh, being a succession of "huh-huhs"
  that ended in a violent cough.</p>

  <p>"That's the way to look at it. Do you know Colonel Poynting?"</p>

  <p>She first hesitated, then nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you know his house in Park Lane&mdash;ever been there?"</p>

  <p>"I know the house very well," she said. Her eyes were asking
  questions.</p>

  <p>"I am a plain man " he began, and she nodded, he thought a little
  offensively, and for a moment was thrown out of his stride. "What I mean to
  say is, that there's no sense in beating about the bush."</p>

  <p>"You did say it, some time ago," she said.</p>

  <p>Very few women could rattle Slip Morgan. She did.</p>

  <p>"You're on the hook and so am I," he said firmly. "I know all about that
  emerald bar that you've got pinned on your&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't let us be indelicate," said Mary Smith. "Yes, you know all about
  it? Well?"</p>

  <p>"If you want a hundred pounds for an hour's work, the job's waiting for
  you. All you've got to do is to go to Colonel Poynting's house. We'll fake a
  card of invitation. Just walk about amongst the swells, and give a certain
  friend of mine the office when he can come in. Do you see what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said, shaking her head. "The only thing that's pretty clear is
  that you want me to go to Mr. Poynting's house, and that of course I shan't
  do. In the first place " She paused, and shook her head again. "No, I can't
  do it."</p>

  <p>Slip smiled. They still had the ^lounge" to themselves, but the chances
  were that they would not enjoy this privacy for long.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what," he said confidentially. You think you'll be
  recognized?" And, when she agreed, he patted her lightly on the arm. She
  brushed her sleeve so ostentatiously, so deliberately, that he did not repeat
  this gesture of friendliness and comradeship.</p>

  <p>"It's the fancy-dress ball " he began.</p>

  <p>"0h!"</p>

  <p>Evidently she knew all about the fancy-dress ball, for he saw her mouth
  open a little.</p>

  <p>"0f course, masks! How amusing!" She looked at Slip with a new interest.
  "Your friend is on the hook, you said? Does that mean he's hanged or he's
  going to be hanged! Or do I understand that your friend is not exactly
  honest?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be comic," said the inelegant Mr. Morgan, "and don't play the
  dairymaid on me. Innocence is all very well in its place. The question is,
  will you do it&mdash;there's a hundred pounds for you&mdash;fifty down and
  fifty after the job?"</p>

  <p>She was pinching her lower lip, looking at, and slightly through, Slip
  Morgan.</p>

  <p>"Do I understand that your friend is going to?" She waited for him to
  suggest the proper phrase, which he did.</p>

  <p>"He's going to do a job at Colonel Poynting's house in Park Lane."</p>

  <p>"And that I'm to go inside and signal&mdash;how?"</p>

  <p>"Through the winder," said Slip. "It's easy.</p>

  <p>You just stroll up to the winder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>""Window," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"'Winder's' good enough for me," he snarled. "Pull out a handkerchief and
  sort of rub your nose with it. But you mustn't do that till Colonel Poynting
  gives away the prizes for the first fancy dress, because everybody will be
  down in the drawing-room then. Now do you get me?"</p>

  <p>She had got him. And once she was interested, she became almost
  enthusiastic. She arranged to meet Mr. Thompson that night (Tom Burkes'
  temporary <i>nom de guerre</i>). She would go, she thought, as a pierrot or a
  pierrette.</p>

  <p>"It isn't exactly original," she said.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't matter," replied Slip, "so long as it's clean."</p>

  <p>So were arranged the preliminaries of one of the neatest cat burglaries
  that had ever been engineered. Upstairs in Mr. Poynting's study was a safe,
  and in that safe he kept a considerable sum of money.</p>

  <p>Park Lane is not, as some people imagine, a center of wild and hectic
  gaiety. It is a thoroughfare mainly inhabited by people who are rich enough
  to live somewhere else. Year in and year out their white blinds are drawn,
  their furniture is shrouded in holland sheeting. A vulgar few live in their
  houses, but as a rule they do not give parties. Colonel Poynting's
  fancy-dress ball was, therefore, so unusual an event that the police hardly
  knew where to park the cars.</p>

  <p>The Colonel received his guests at the head of the big staircase, and he
  was arrayed, spiritually and materially, in the toga of a Roman father, as he
  explained to the worried young Guardsman, who wore nothing more symbolical
  than a dress suit. The Colonel explained between speeches of welcome
  addressed to his arriving guests.</p>

  <p>"I neither know nor care where Dorothy has gone," he said firmly. "You saw
  the letter she wrote to Elsah&mdash;or rather, started to write?&mdash;&bull;
  How d'ye do! How d'ye do!&mdash;Happily, I came into the library when she had
  been called away to the telephone, and read it.&mdash;Glad to see you, Lady
  Carl... how d'ye do!&mdash;No daughter of mine can tell my
  fiancee&mdash;order her, in fact&mdash;to give up her father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's an awful old bounder," said Mr. Venner mistakenly.</p>

  <p>"I'm referring to myself," said the Colonel. "I mean Dorothy's
  father&mdash;not Elsah's father... how d'ye do! I'm glad to see you... No,
  Venner; I will not have it... how d'ye do. Miss... um... ?"</p>

  <p>The newcomer was a masked lady, who flashed a smile and waved a hand
  before she disappeared.</p>

  <p>"What good legs that girl's got!" said the Colonel. "Terribly good
  legs!... As I was saying, she left my house, and I've reason to believe that
  she is persecuting poor Elsah&mdash;the dear girl says nothing, but I can
  guess. If I could only get at Dorothy... ah, darling!"</p>

  <p>Darling looked rather worried, and this in spite of the assurance of her
  parent that she had nothing to worry about. So far as he was concerned, he
  would keep sober until after the ceremony. Not that this troubled her. She
  drew the Roman father to a convenient alcove, and a host of clowns and devils
  and Venetian ladies arrived unwelcomed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear"&mdash;the Colonel patted her hand&mdash; * everything is in
  order. I had the license from the Bishop's office this afternoon. Have your
  baggage at Victoria... Simplon Express&mdash;you know Italy? A glorious
  place!"</p>

  <p>For the moment Italy meant less to Elsah than a pint of pure mud.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy hasn't... written?" She was rather breathless, showed appropriate
  symptoms of nervous apprehension (she was honoring Ophelia in the matter of
  costume) and a tenseness which he understood.</p>

  <p>"You need not trouble your pretty head about my foolish child," he said.
  "She has neither written nor called."</p>

  <p>And here a gathering of Mephistopheles, pierrots, Henry the Eighths, and a
  Gentleman of the Regency at the head of the stairs sent him to perform the
  host's duties.</p>

  <p>The masked girl sought no friend. She found malicious pleasure in the
  sight of a disconsolate young Guardsman equally unattached. She danced with a
  Romeo, a pre-historic man, and a Lord Nelson, and was depressed by the
  spectacle of an Ophelia in the arms of a Roman father.</p>

  <p>Colonel Poynting's fancy-dress ball was an annual affair; the prize-
  giving for the best costume had developed into a ritual. At half-past eleven
  the three sycophantic friends who made the choice led the modest Ophelia to
  the cleared center of the ballroom.</p>

  <p>"My friends!"</p>

  <p>The Roman father cleared his voice and stroked the moustache which had
  come into fashion since the days of Augustus.</p>

  <p>"My friends, on this joyous occasion&mdash;er&mdash;and on the eve of what
  may be the turning-point of my life, I have great pleasure in awarding as a
  prize a replica of that jewel which was so unhappily lost by the fair choice
  of the judges."</p>

  <p>A disinterested observer might have demanded (and many who were not
  disinterested did ask <i>sotto voce</i>) whether Colonel Poynting had
  foreknowledge of how the judging would go.</p>

  <p>"This replica&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why not have the original, daddy?"</p>

  <p>The Colonel turned with a jump. The masked lady was unmasked.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy!" he squeaked. "Really...!"</p>

  <p>Slowly she held something to view. It was the emerald bar.</p>

  <p>"If the insurance has been paid to your lady friend," she said, "This
  belongs to the underwriters."</p>

  <p>"Where... where did you find it?" stammered the Colonel.</p>

  <p>Dorothy looked at the crowd of revellers, stepped nearer to her father,
  and lowered her voice.</p>

  <p>"It was never lost," she said&mdash;only the Colonel and the pallid Elsah
  heard; "I found it in her bedroom&mdash;between mattress and
  overlay&mdash;and Mr. Burkes was foolish enough to tell me how useful the
  insurance money would be!"</p>

  <p>"That's a lie!" gasped Elsah. "You're&mdash;you're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Colonel stopped her. He was as dignified as a toga and a wreath of
  roses would allow him to be.</p>

  <p>"I will hear no word against Elsah," he said. "We are to be married
  tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Dorothy stared at him.</p>

  <p>"But, daddy, not until you make inquiries... you must wait..."</p>

  <p>Colonel Poynting smiled.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, almost playfully, "in my safe upstairs, and in my
  cash- box, is a little piece of paper signed by the Bishop of London. Come,
  come, my dear; tell Elsah you're sorry that you made such a ridiculous
  charge."</p>

  <p>"In your cash-box?" she said slowly.</p>

  <p>Turning, she walked to the window, drew aside the heavy curtains, and
  waved her hand.</p>

  <p>"My dear!" said her father, in alarm. He thought for a moment that she
  contemplated suicide and was taking farewell of the world.</p>

  <p>"Now let everybody sit down and talk," said Dorothy, coming back to the
  group. "Tommy Venner&mdash;do something for me! Call everybody
  in&mdash;servants, everybody."</p>

  <p>The Colonel moved uneasily. "You're not going to make a scene .. J"
  Dorothy laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to drink the health of my friend Tom," she said
  mysteriously.</p>

  <p>Just off Park Lane a taxi was waiting. Tom Burkes strolled negligently
  towards and entered the vehicle. As the cab drove off, Slip Morgan, who had
  been waiting nervously in the dark interior, asked a question.</p>

  <p>"There it is," said Tom, and dropped the heavy cash-box on the floor.
  "That gel's a good worker. I'll hand it to her."</p>

  <p>"Gels'll do anything for me," said Slip complacently.</p>

  <h2><a id="story08"
     name="story08">8. VIA MADEIRA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">This story concerns four people: Larry Vanne, who understood
  men and lived on his knowledge; Eli Soburn, who both understood and liked
  diamonds, and never traveled without a hundred thousand pounds' worth in a
  little leather wallet attached to his undergarments; Mary Perella, who
  understood most of the things that a ladies' school could teach, and, in
  addition, had that working knowledge which comes to a girl who has been left
  penniless and must shift for herself; and fourthly, Jeremiah Fallowby, who
  had a knowledge of the world geographically, and who was suspicious of all
  women who might love him for his wealth alone.</p>

  <p>Of these four, only one had a definite objective. Larry Vanne, pacing up
  and down his hired flat in Jermyn Street, a long cigar between his strong
  white teeth, his thumbs in the arm-holes of his waist coat, confided to his
  slightly bored wife that the North Atlantic trade had dwindled to
  vanishing-point.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what's coming over New York, Lou," he said despairingly. "We
  hadn't been tied up ten minutes to the river end of Twenty-third Street when
  along came McCarthy with a couple of bulls, and it was 'The Captain wants to
  see you, Larry.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They had nothing on you," said Mrs. Vanne; "not if I'm to judge from the
  presents you brought home!"</p>

  <p>"Sure they had nothing on me!" said Larry. "But it shows the tendency of
  the age, Lou. Suspicion, suspicion, suspicion! And I did no more than to sit
  in a game with that Boston crowd to trim a half-witted cinema boy&mdash;my
  share was less than a thousand dollars. I haven't worked the North Atlantic
  for years, and things have gone from bad to worse, Lou. There wasn't a dame
  on board that didn't park her jewelry in the purser's safe."</p>

  <p>Lou yawned.</p>

  <p>"Any man who works one-handed is asking for trouble," was her dictum.
  "That's where you're all wrong, Larry. Now suppose you and me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You and I," said Larry gently. "Let's keep the conversation out of the
  steerage."</p>

  <p>It was true that Larry had never worked the North Atlantic. He had
  confined himself mainly to the Pacific trade, and had made bigger pickings
  between Shanghai and Vancouver, B.C., than any man in his line. He had worked
  scientifically, allowing certain routes to lie fallow for years, had watched
  and noted changes in personnel, so that he could tell you off-hand who was
  the captain of the <i>Trianic</i> and just whereabouts in the world you might
  find that red-nosed purser who nearly gaoled him in '19.</p>

  <p>He made no or few mistakes; his patience was remorseless. On one occasion
  he took two journeys to Australia and back, and caught his man for £8000
  worth of real money when the ship was in sight of port.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying a new trade, anyway, and this time you 11 work for your
  living," he said, but gave no further information.</p>

  <p>It was his practice to be frank in general and reticent in particular, and
  he told his companion nothing of Mr. Soburn and his wallet of diamonds. He
  could have told quite a lot. He could have traced Mr. Soburn *s family
  history from the day he started peddling buttons in New York; of his
  legitimate deals in furs, of his questionable transactions in the world of
  low and high finance. He carried these wonderful cut diamonds of his for the
  same reason as a girl carries a doll or a boy a clockwork motorcar. They were
  his toys and his comforts, and he had frequent satisfaction in displaying
  these behind locked doors to his cronies with all the hushed pride that a
  Japanese virtuoso would display a carved jade box of the Ming period.</p>

  <p>Larry knew his movements, past, present, and prospective; but, mostly, he
  knew Mr. Soburn's chiefest weakness, which was for a pretty face.</p>

  <p>Larry's wife was beautiful enough in her hard-cut way, but it was not the
  kind of beauty that would appeal to Mr. Soburn.</p>

  <p>"What I want," he told her frankly, "is something that hasn't lost the
  bloom; the sort of big-eyed girl who would faint at the sight of a
  sparkler."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Larry nodded her head slowly.</p>

  <p>"That sounds so much like me that you might be painting my portrait," she
  said; "but I gather you want a different type."</p>

  <p>That day she sent in an advertisement to two newspapers. On the third day
  came Mary Perella. Mary walked from Bayswater because she had reached the
  stage where pennies counted. She had had three jobs in six months. Her three
  employers suffered from a common misfortune, which they confessed at an early
  stage of her engagement&mdash;they were unhappily married. Unhappily married
  employers who absent-mindedly paw their secretaries' hands are not so
  infrequent a phenomenon as many people would imagine. Mary descended the
  secretariat scale from rich city merchants to a musical composer who lived in
  a world of writs, and she had broken her last pound sterling and was owing
  one week's rent when she set forth to Jermyn Street, never dreaming that the
  lady who required a secretary-companion to travel abroad, at a wildly
  exorbitant salary, would be likely to choose her from the thousands of
  applicants.</p>

  <p>"She's made for the part," said Larry, who, unobserved, had made a very
  complete scrutiny of the new secretary. * * Orphan and everything; no
  relations in London..." He scratched his chin thoughtfully. "Fix her
  tomorrow. Get her passage booked and our own at the same time.</p>

  <p>"We'll travel on the Frimley passports."</p>

  <p>He was very practical now.</p>

  <p>"She '11 want some money for clothing&mdash;give her twenty-five on
  account. You told her that she was my secretary and not yours!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Larry nodded.</p>

  <p>"She bore the blow very well," she said. "I suppose you 're sure that
  Soburn is traveling on that ship?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I'm sure!" he said scornfully. "He's got the royal suite, two
  bathrooms&mdash;God knows why&mdash;and two of his best pals are traveling.
  Besides, the next packet is booked up. And, Lou, you can tell that kid to
  report on board. I don't want to see her till we get to Southampton. Somehow
  I don't make a good impression on girls."</p>

  <p>Mary Perella came the next morning and nearly dropped when the gracious
  lady confirmed her in the engagement.</p>

  <p>"I'm quite sure you will do, my dear," said Mrs. Larry Vanne sweetly, "and
  you will find my husband a very generous employer. He is writing a book on
  rare jewels, but nobody must know this, because..."</p>

  <p>The excuse, flimsy as it was, convinced Mary.</p>

  <p>"What about Dennis?" asked Mrs. Larry suddenly, when she saw her husband
  after the interview.</p>

  <p>Though he was a man who did not usually display his emotion, Larry Vanne
  was surprised into a grimace. Detective-Inspector Dennis, of Scotland Yard,
  was an atom in the molecule of uneasiness which never quite ceased to perturb
  him. And Dennis had met him on his arrival in England, and in his suave, nice
  way had said "Don't," He hadn't been quite as terse as that, and had added a
  sermon, the text of which was "Watch out," that had left Mr. Vanne distinctly
  uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Detective-Inspector Dennis does not really come into the story at all, so
  it would be superfluous to describe that very wise man, who read the minds of
  jewel thieves and confidence-men with such devastating accuracy.</p>

  <p>At ten o 'clock on the Thursday morning Mrs. Larry Vanne booked stateroom
  No. 15, the last available accommodation on the London Castle. A quarter of
  an hour later, Mr. Jeremiah Fallowby also rang up the Castle office, and was
  answered by a junior who was deputising for the booking-clerk, who had just
  gone out to lunch.</p>

  <p>People often said that Jeremiah Fallowby was good-looking. They qualified
  the statement in various ways: some said that he would be really handsome if
  he had a little more expression; some thought that his features were
  irregular, but he had nice eyes; others were inclined to the belief that it
  was his mouth which spoiled him. On one point they were all agreed: he could
  be very dull. He seldom went anywhere&mdash;you never met him, for example,
  dining at the Ambassadors' on the night of the Grand Prix. He certainly went
  to Deauville&mdash;but ways in the off-season. The month he spent in Venice
  was the very month that the Lido was a wilderness. He was in town when
  everybody else was out of town, and Ascot usually coincided with the period
  that he chose for his stay at Aix.</p>

  <p>At the height of the London season he was pretty sure to be somewhere in
  the country and when the north-bound trains were overloaded with guns bound
  for the moors, Jeremiah would be writing excuses from Madeira.</p>

  <p>"Jerry, you're absolutely impossible!" rasped his aunt. "You never meet a
  gel worth knowing, and you'll end up by marrying a waitress in a
  tea-shop!"</p>

  <p>"Which tea-shop?" asked Jerry^ momentarily interested.</p>

  <p>"You're coming to us for Christmas," said his aunt. ^ ^ I am not going to
  allow you to wander alone. If you go away, I '11 come with you&mdash;I warn
  you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Jeremiah gratefully.</p>

  <p>"You would like me to come!" asked the astonished lady.</p>

  <p>"No," said Jeremiah truthfully. "I'm thanking you for the warning."</p>

  <p>None of his many relatives were really very rude to his face, because he
  was worth a quarter of a million sterling. But the uncles and aunts and
  cousins who planned to marry him off, and who arranged the most cunningly
  devised house- parties, only to receive a letter which began:</p>

  <p>"...most terribly sorry, but I shall be in Venice on the 10th..."</p>

  <p>had no scruples in speaking of him in the plainest possible manner.</p>

  <p>"It is his damned romanticism," fumed Uncle Brebbury, who had five
  eligible daughters. "He's got a fairy prince complex... thinks he'll find a
  (naughty word) Cinderella. Tea-shop gel! He 11 be bringing home
  a&mdash;a!"</p>

  <p>"Bertie!" murmured his shocked wife. "Please... The gels!"</p>

  <p>But "the gels" were in complete sympathy.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah wrote a little, read much, thought even more. He was modest
  enough to believe that he was entirely without attraction, sophisticated to
  the extent of suspecting that most mothers were prepared to sacrifice their
  daughters on the altar of his fortune.</p>

  <p>One gloomy morning Jeremiah, having sworn to be a member of Mrs. Leslie
  Fallowby's Christmas house-party, was contemplating the dismal prospect. The
  glory of autumn is at best the wan beauty of decay; and since healthy men do
  not love caducity in any expression, Jeremiah had met the early frosts and
  the mists which lie in the tawny hollows of Burnham Beeches with an uneasy
  yearning for the moorland when spring was coming in, with arum lilies growing
  on the seashore and gladiolas budding on verdant slopes. He would rise from
  his writing-table and pace restlessly the worn carpet of his study. And
  inevitably he would be drawn to the drawer where, with the supreme
  indifference which summer brought to him, he had thrown the early sailing
  lists.</p>

  <p>For hours this morning he had sat turning them over. He could go to the
  east coast, stop off at Naples or Port Said... He could spend a week in
  Nairobi... he knew a man who was trying to grow cotton somewhere in
  Kenya&mdash;or was it tobacco?</p>

  <p>It would be rather fun to end the sea journey at Beira&mdash;push off up
  country to Salisbury, and work down through Bulawayo and Kimberley to the
  Cape.</p>

  <p>There was a delightful boarding-house at Rondebosch, kept by an ex-civil
  servant, with great hedges of blue plumbago. Behind, like the backcloth of a
  theatrical scene, the ranges of Constantia.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah Fallowby made a little face and, walking to the casement window,
  stared out over the darkening lawn. Rain was falling steadily. Every tree
  dripped dismally. Near at hand was a bed of bedraggled
  chrysanthemums&mdash;white they had been, and their soiled petals littered
  the ground.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch mechanically. Really, he intended looking at the
  date block. One o'clock. 27th October... November in four days&mdash;fogs and
  drizzle and colds in the head.</p>

  <p>He sat at his table again and reached for the telephone, gave a London
  number, and waited indecisively till the bell rang.</p>

  <p>"Is that the Castle Line? Good... have you anything on the London
  Castle&mdash;deck cabin if possible?"</p>

  <p>He waited, the receiver at his ear, his pen drawing uncouthly arabesques
  on his blotting-pad.</p>

  <p>A voice at the other end of the wire awakened him to realities.</p>

  <p>"Good... my name is Fallowby... yes, Jeremiah Fallowby. I'll arrange to
  collect the ticket right away."</p>

  <p>He rang off, and immediately connected with a London agent in Threadneedle
  Street, and gave him instructions. The tickets arrived by the first post in
  the morning, and Jeremiah went joyously to the task of packing.</p>

  <p>If he had only been content to stay at Burn-ham Beeches he might have been
  saved a great deal of inconvenience. Within two hours of the receipt of his
  letter he had left his house with instructions that neither letters nor
  telegrams should be sent on to him, and had deposited himself in his club in
  St. James's Street, so that he did not receive the frantic wire addressed to
  him by the Steamship Company, nor yet interview a penitent junior clerk who
  had booked a stateroom that was already engaged. In complete ignorance, he
  motored to Southampton, had a breakdown on the way, and arrived only just in
  time to hurl his baggage on board.</p>

  <p>The cabin was a large-sized one. He was annoyed to discover that there
  were two beds, and directed the steward to remove one.</p>

  <p>"Traveling alone, sir," said the steward phlegmatically. (Nothing
  surprises stewards.) And then, "There was some trouble about your ticket.
  Another gent was booked."</p>

  <p>He glanced at the initials on the suitcase, took the counterfoil of the
  steamship ticket, made a few inquiries about Jeremiah's taste in the
  direction of early-morning coffee and baths, and vanished.</p>

  <p>To the purser, as he handed in the counterfoil:</p>

  <p>"Seventeen's aboard. The other fellow hasn't come."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said the assistant purser, and spiked the paper.</p>

  <p>¦ The ship had cleared Southampton waters and was nosing its way to the
  Channel when Jerry, writing letters at the little desk in the cabin (the
  usual and untruthful excuses to Mrs. Leslie Fallowby), became aware that
  somebody was standing in the open doorway.</p>

  <p>He looked up and saw a girl.</p>

  <p>"Um... er... do you want anything!" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mary Perella came into the stateroom a little boisterously. She had that
  excited pinkness which adventure gives to young skins&mdash;the day was
  unexpectedly mild; there was a blue, cloud-flecked sky above, and the white
  cloisters of the Needles on the port quarter.</p>

  <p>Ahead a summery land, and the immense possibilities of new lands.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah glared up at her from his writing-table.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr.&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>He got to his feet slowly.</p>

  <p>"Fallowby," he said, and she looked relieved.</p>

  <p>"I've been worrying terribly about the name," she said. "You know when
  Mrs. Fallowby told me I didn't really catch it, but I hadn't the courage to
  ask."</p>

  <p>Jeremiah frowned.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Fallowby? "Which of his innumerable aunts was this? Mrs. Hector
  Fallowby, or Mrs. Richard&mdash;or was it that terrible little Mrs. Merstham-
  Fallowby with the impossible daughters?... He uttered an exclamation, but
  swallowed its violent end.</p>

  <p>"Not Mrs. Le&mdash;" he said.</p>

  <p>Even in his agitation he thought she was extraordinarily pretty: she, at
  any rate, was no Fallowby. Gray eyes, rather big; there was the faintest film
  of powder on her face, but young girls did that sort of thing nowadays.</p>

  <p>She nodded smilingly. He was, she thought, being a little facetious.
  Husbands and wives spoke about one another in such queer ways.</p>

  <p>"It will be rather fun spending Christmas Day on board ship," she went on.
  "We are going to South Africa, aren't we?"</p>

  <p>"Unless the captain changes his mind," said Jeremiah, and they both
  laughed.</p>

  <p>Then he became conscious of his remissness.</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit down?"</p>

  <p>She sat on a sofa under the square window that looks on to the promenade
  deck.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have a letter from Mrs. Fallowby?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't like any of the Fallowbys to give letters of introduction to
  pretty girl outsiders.</p>

  <p>He saw a look of consternation come to the girl's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Isn't she here!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah blinked at her.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;Mrs. Fallowby? I hope not!"</p>

  <p>Mary Perella went pale.</p>

  <p>"But... I suppose it is all right... but... she said she was coming."</p>

  <p>Jeremiah frowned. If there was one experience in the world he didn't want,
  and which he intended to avoid, it was a tete-a-tete with a female Fallowby.
  Mrs. Leslie had evidently kept her promise.</p>

  <p>"I suppose she's here, then," he said unhappily.</p>

  <p>There was an awkward pause. Into Mary's mind crept a doubt.</p>

  <p>"She engaged me as traveling secretary, and she said I was to see you as
  soon as I got on board. Fortunately, I remembered the number of your
  cabin."</p>

  <p>"Really!"</p>

  <p>He could think of no comment more illuminating.</p>

  <p>"So you're going to South Africa? Do you know the country?"</p>

  <p>She had never been abroad. Her father had served in Africa: he was so
  interested a listener that she found herself telling him about the tragedy of
  two years before.</p>

  <p>"I stayed with an aunt for six months, but it was rather&mdash;well,
  impossible."</p>

  <p>"I never knew an aunt that wasn't," he sympathized. "You seem to have had
  a pretty unhappy time, Miss Perella&mdash;that is an Italian name, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>She thought it had been Maltese two hundred years before, and he seemed to
  remember a General Sir Gregory Perella who had done tremendous things in the
  Abyssinian War&mdash;or was it the Mutiny?</p>

  <p>Suddenly:</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do! I have a portable typewriter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said hastily. "The best thing you can do is to go along and
  find Mrs. Fallowby&mdash;no, I don't think I should do that. If I remember
  rightly, she is a terribly bad sailor, and won't be on deck for a week. Just
  loaf around. If there is anything I can do for you, let me know... got a nice
  cabin! Fine! If you see Mrs. Fallowby, tell her I'm... er... awfully busy. In
  fact, I thought of writing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She nodded wisely.</p>

  <p>"A book&mdash;I know."</p>

  <p>She left him a little dazed.</p>

  <p>He saw her that night at dinner, sitting at a little table by herself, and
  they exchanged smiles as he passed. There was no sign of Mrs. Leslie
  Fallowby, but the ship had a slight roll on, and that would explain her
  absence. After dinner he saw the girl leaning over the rail, and went up to
  her.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen your&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't," he interrupted her. "Poor dear, she thinks this is rough
  weather."</p>

  <p>He commandeered a chair for her, and they sat down and talked till nearly
  ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>"You're going to let me help you with your book!" she said, as they stood
  at the head of the companion-way before she went below for the night.</p>

  <p>"My book?" He started guiltily. "Oh, of course! Did I say I was writing a
  book? Naturally, I will be happy for you to help me, but I haven't got very
  far."</p>

  <p>He found himself awaiting her arrival on deck the next morning with some
  impatience. They were in the dreaded Bay, but the sea was as smooth as a
  pond, and, save for the chill in the air, the weather was delightful. Pacing
  round and round the deck, they discovered mutual interests&mdash;she also
  would one day write a book, which was to be a tremendous affair about life
  and people. He did not even smile. Jeremiah was rather diffident: possibly he
  credited her with as extensive an acquaintance with the subject as he himself
  possessed.</p>

  <p>"I can't find Mrs. Fallowby's cabin anywhere," she said. "My conscience
  has been pricking me. Couldn't I do something for her?"</p>

  <p>"She's quite all right," said Jeremiah hastily.</p>

  <p>It was time enough to brace himself for an interview with Mrs. Fallowby
  when she made her appearance. The letter of excuse he had written was already
  torn up. How like that enterprising lady to discover that he was sailing!</p>

  <p>And yet he was puzzled a little. Why should Mrs. Fallowby have taken this
  voyage without her unprepossessing daughters? He resolved at the earliest
  convenient moment to discover from Mary Perella a solution to this private
  mystery.</p>

  <p>"We shall be in Funchal Harbor on Christmas Eve, by which time it ought to
  be fairly warm," he told her in the course of the afternoon walk. "It will be
  rather jolly doing one's Christmas shopping."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Fallowby will be well enough to come ashore by then?" she
  suggested.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah prayed not, but refrained from giving expression to the hope.</p>

  <p>The next night they leaned over the rail together and watched the faint
  star of light which stood for Cape Finisterre sink down behind the horizon;
  and he told her what a bore life was, and how he hated crowds and people who
  were terribly resolved to be gay to order. And she reviewed some of her
  landladies, and told him of a restaurant where one could get a wonderful
  lunch for 3d., or 6d.; and once he squeezed her arm to attract her attention
  to a passing sailing ship, its white sails looking ghostly in the faint light
  of the crescent moon, and she did not seem to resent that method. Yet,
  curiously enough, when he took her arm again to lead her to the
  companion-way, she very gently disengaged herself.</p>

  <p>"I hope Mrs. Fallowby will be better in the morning," she said, "and I do
  hope you will do some work&mdash;I feel a great impostor: I haven't done a
  stroke since I've come on to this ship!"</p>

  <p>He went to bed and dreamed of gray eyes and very soft arms that gave under
  his grip.</p>

  <p>The night before the ship came into Funchal Bay, and whilst he was
  dressing for dinner, the purser came to see him, and the tone of that officer
  was rather short, and his manner strangely hostile.</p>

  <p>"In what name did you book this cabin, Mr. Fallowby?"</p>

  <p>"In my own name," said Jeremiah in surprise.</p>

  <p>The purser looked at him with suspicion.</p>

  <p>"The name I have on the list is Frimley&mdash;the same initials, J. F.,
  'John Frimley.' Are you sure that isn't the name in which the cabin is
  booked?"</p>

  <p>"You've seen my ticket&mdash;and really, does it matter?" asked Jeremiah,
  a little impatiently.</p>

  <p>"It does and it doesn't," said the purser. "Who is this young lady you're
  with, Mr. Fallowby?"</p>

  <p>"I am with no young lady," said Jeremiah, with pardonable asperity. "If
  you mean Miss Perella, she is my aunt's secretary. Nobody knows better than
  you that my aunt is somewhere on this ship. I suggest that you should
  interview Mrs. Leslie Fallowby, who I have no doubt will give you the fullest
  information."</p>

  <p>"There is no person named Mrs. Leslie Fallowby on the ship," said the
  purser, and Jeremiah stared at him. "The young lady," went on the officer, "
  states that she is your secretary, and that she is traveling in that
  capacity."</p>

  <p>"My secretary!" said Jeremiah incredulously.</p>

  <p>"She says she is your secretary, engaged by your wife."</p>

  <p>Jeremiah sat down with a thump.</p>

  <p>"Say that again," he said.</p>

  <p>The obliging purser repeated his tremendous tidings.</p>

  <p>"Now I don't want any trouble with you, Mr. Fallowby," he said, not
  unkindly, "or with your wife. I'm going to show you a copy of the wireless we
  have received from London, and you'll understand that the game is up."</p>

  <p>"Which game?" asked Jeremiah faintly.</p>

  <p>The purser took a sheet of paper from his pocket, evidently a typewritten
  copy of a radio that had been received that day. It ran:</p>

  <p>"To Captain, London Castle. Believe passenger named John Frimley and his
  wife are traveling under assumed name on your ship. They booked Suite No. 17,
  but they may be traveling separately to avoid detection. Frimley escaped our
  officers sent to arrest him at Waterloo, and has not been traced. He is a
  tall, good-looking man, clean-shaven, may wear horn-rimmed
  spectacles&mdash;"</p>

  <p>(At this point Jeremiah quickly removed the reading-glasses he had been
  wearing when the purser came into the stateroom.)</p>

  <p>"His wife is pretty, looks younger than she is. If any persons answering
  this description or occupying Suite 17, hand them to Portuguese Police,
  Funchal, to await extradition."</p>

  <p>Jeremiah read the document twice.</p>

  <p>"Your wife is already under guard in her cabin," said the purser, "and
  there'll be a master-of-arms on duty outside your stateroom to see that you
  do not attempt to leave until the Portuguese authorities arrive."</p>

  <p>Jeremiah gaped at him.</p>

  <p>"My wife is what?"</p>

  <p>The purser waved a majestic hand and left the cabin before Mr. Jeremiah
  Fallowby began the exercise of the colorful vocabulary which he had acquired
  in his travels.</p>

  <p>It was in the bare and whitewashed office of a Portuguese police office
  that he saw again Miss Mary Perella. He expected her to be carried in, a
  pallid and wilting wreck, whose nights had been made sleepless by the thought
  of her tragic sorrow; but it was a very healthy and indignant girl who came
  across the uncovered floor towards him.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this, Mr. Frimley!" she asked. Reproach was rather
  in her eyes than in her voice. "It isn't true that you are a jewel
  thief?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Fallowby," protested Jeremiah.</p>

  <p>"You told me your wife was on board, and she isn't."</p>

  <p>He guessed that this was his real offense.</p>

  <p>"I never said my wife was anywhere," said Jeremiah loudly. "I was talking
  about my aunt, Mrs, Leslie Fallowby. You told me you were her secretary."</p>

  <p>"I did nothing of the kind," she stormed. "I told you I was your
  secretary&mdash;that your wife had engaged me."</p>

  <p>"But I've never had a wife!" he wailed.</p>

  <p>"Attention!" The fat man behind the desk boomed the word. "I know English
  too well! Now you spik my questions when I ask them!"</p>

  <p>"Fire ahead," said Jeremiah recklessly.</p>

  <p>He slept that Christmas Eve in a stone cell which was very dark and very
  unpleasant in other respects. He had no acquaintance with the Portuguese
  language, but he spoke Spanish rather fluently, and he learned that the girl
  had been taken to a convent. The British Vice-Consul had been requisitioned,
  but that worthy was not in Funchal. So Jeremiah despatched long and vehement
  cables to London... and might have saved himself the trouble.</p>

  <p>In the early hours of the morning came a wire to the Chief of Police,
  announcing the arrest of "Mr. and Mrs. Frimley," whose other name was Vanne,
  and an apologetic police dignitary of the first class came personally, and in
  uniform, to offer apologies.</p>

  <p>It was from him that Jerry learned of Mr. Vanne's little plot (revealed to
  the London police by his wife); of the engagement of a secretary who was to
  charm from a susceptible millionaire a view of his diamonds and such
  information about their safeguarding as she could secure.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Miss Mary Perella had been similarly informed: he met her
  half-way up the steep slope which led to the convent, and she came running
  down with her hands outstretched.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, and a merry Christmas, fellow-convict!" she said, with a gaiety
  that was immensely infectious.</p>

  <p>He took her arm as they walked down the cobbled hill lane together, and
  came to a bench that overlooked the bay.</p>

  <p>She was beautifully sympathetic&mdash;apparently saw nothing in her own
  experience but a thrilling adventure.</p>

  <p>"I knew, of course, that something must be wrong. I couldn't imagine you
  were a burglar, or whatever this Mr. Frimley was." She sighed. "I've lost a
  very good job," she said ruefully.</p>

  <p>"Let me find you another," said Jeremiah eagerly. "I really am going to
  write a book&mdash;I have threatened to do it for years, and you can come
  along and correct my spelling."</p>

  <p>She half shook her head. Yet apparently she accepted the position, for
  they went on to the Cape by the next mail steamer, and the English chaplain
  who had married them on the morning they sailed came down to see them
  off.</p>

  <h2><a id="story09"
     name="story09">9. JAKE'S BROTHER BILL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The effect of wine upon temperament is a subject for study
  which the psychologists have neglected.</p>

  <p>Jake's brother Bill was the only man who ever tackled the question in an
  earnest spirit of research, and although his studies were frequently
  interrupted by circumstances over which he had no control, he never forsook
  his course of study. On one point he was emphatic, and it was that champagne
  produced an overwhelming sense of patriotism. He reached this conclusion in
  the week he was expelled from college for painting a pacifist professor's
  motorcar red, white and blue.</p>

  <p>He had to break into the garage to do it, and he spent the whole of one
  night at his task, but neither his enterprise nor his nobility of purpose
  saved him from being expelled.</p>

  <p>When he was in prison for violently assaulting the police in the execution
  of their duty, he developed his theory to the extent of marking rum as a
  "revolutionary stimulant which arouses the basest resentment against
  established law."</p>

  <p>He used to write long letters to Jake, setting forth his views.</p>

  <p>It is to his credit that he never drank rum again. Jake insists that he
  did one memorable evening at Funchal, but the truth is not yet known, for
  Bill is somewhere in China, having escaped from Funchal on a fruit boat which
  "he did unlawfully seize by piracy, and did cast away by neglect upon the
  foreshores of Algiers "&mdash;to quote the indictment on which, in his
  absence, he was tried and sentenced to death by the Government of Lisboa.</p>

  <p>All the trouble came about over a girl who was also a ward of
  Government.</p>

  <p>Wards in Chancery are frequent phenomena, but a ward whose guardians
  changed with the fluctuating fortune of political parties was a surprising
  circumstance even to Jake Harrison.</p>

  <p>And the only thing that ever surprised Jake was Q.Z.H., who lived at the
  Vigo end of the cable. Q.Z.H. had a name and an identity, but nobody at
  Funchal ever knew him, except by the initials which preceded the messages he
  relayed. And he was certainly a poor operator.</p>

  <p>"It is surprising to me that that fellow holds down his job," said Jake at
  odd intervals.</p>

  <p>Jake came to the South-Eastern from the Western Union. He left the Western
  Union from sheer ennui.</p>

  <p>Wall Street prices were his specialty, and after five weary years of
  fraction tapping, he threw up the work and came to the South-Eastern, which
  carries a line of romance and unexpectedness. For the South-Eastern drains
  China and India, Africa and Australia of their surplus news, and there is
  generally a little war near one sensitive, trembling antenna of the service,
  and Funchal got all the news that was going.</p>

  <p>Jake was a Canadian, a brilliant operator and a misogynist. Or he was
  until one day, strolling up the long hill road that skirts the Grand Canyon,
  he met a girl who had no other duenna than a half-bred terrier pup.</p>

  <p>At the sight of her Jake stood still and stared. Women did not usually
  take him that way, but this girl was amazingly different. Her father had
  been, in his lifetime, a native of Funchal, which meant that the blood of two
  proud Latin races had flowed in his veins. In his native land he had been a
  marquis, or something of the sort, but Jake never troubled to inquire. In
  Funchal he had owned banana lands of vast size.</p>

  <p>The girl's mother was a Miss Macverney, and pretty.</p>

  <p>In the person of Inez Savalla the warm south and the austere north fought,
  gigantically, for expression, and neither side lost. Her hair should have
  been black or flaxen. Instead, it was of swarthy gold. South won in the
  creamy complexion, but the north triumphed in her blue eyes. The pride of the
  Clan Macverney (who are really Brodies) compromised with the <i>hauteur</i>
  of a race that once lived on the borderline of Castile. The carriage of her,
  the swing of hip and shoulder, the tilt of her head, and the long black
  eyelashes through which the blue eyes flashed sideways as she passed him,
  these were pleasantly southern.</p>

  <p>Jake stared after her as she strode down the hill, and he blinked
  twice.</p>

  <p>"That is a pretty nice girl," he admitted.</p>

  <p>He observed that she was very simply dressed, and this puzzled him.
  Simplicity is very uninformative. She might have been a tradesman's daughter,
  and therefore within the possibilities of his acquaintance. On the other
  hand, she might be one of those grand ladies of the Island who live on so
  exalted a plane that nothing meaner than the officers of a visiting man o'
  war, or a consul- general, or a distinguished man of affairs breaking his
  journey to Cape Town, might meet on terms of equality.</p>

  <p>"That is an extraordinarily nice girl," said Jake with a sigh, and
  followed her with his eye until she was out of sight.</p>

  <p>Society on the island of Funchal is notoriously exclusive, but is neither
  as exclusive nor as outspoken as the mess of the South-Eastern Cable Company.
  Here reputations go cheap, as is only natural, for if the officials of the
  S.E.C.C. are punctilious in the matter of secrecy, and it is considered bad
  form even to discuss the contents of cables outside the instrument-room, the
  knowledge of private affairs gained professionally has very naturally an
  influence on the attitude of the individual mind. To the mess-room the folks
  high and low of Funchal were just Funchalese, with or without endearing
  adjectives.</p>

  <p>The mess had few friends outside, and depended upon Fanelly to supply all
  that was requisite of local gossip. Fanelly, who spoke the language like a
  native, was an inveterate collector of news. To him Jake went.</p>

  <p>"A girl with gold-black hair!" Fanelly knitted his youthful brows. "It
  sounds like Inez Savalla: do you know Colonel Pinto Muello, the fat man with
  the mole on his chin f"</p>

  <p>"I have seen the swine," said Jake inelegantly. "Don't tell me she is his
  daughter!"</p>

  <p>Fanelly sneered.</p>

  <p>"Her name is Savalla, I tell you&mdash;how can she be his daughter,
  eh!"</p>

  <p>"Well, what about him!" asked the impatient Jake.</p>

  <p>"She is going to marry him, that's all," said Fanelly, with an air of
  finality.</p>

  <p>Jake fingered his lean brown cheek and a light shone in eyes that at least
  were as blue as Inez Savalla's.</p>

  <p>"She isn't," he said.</p>

  <p>The young man resented this refutation of news which was practically
  official.</p>

  <p>"I tell you the marriage has been fixed by the governor, who is her
  guardian. Old Savalla was an eccentric old devil, and he left his daughter a
  ward of the governor."</p>

  <p>"But this governor is a new man&mdash;Almedez only came to the island six
  months ago."</p>

  <p>Fanelly smiled.</p>

  <p>"That's the joke: whoever is governor is her guardian. Almedez is a great
  friend of Muello's, they went to the same chiropodist in Lisboa&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cease your facetious commentaries," said Jake, laying his big hand on the
  young man's shoulder, "and when you go calling on your dago friends, pass the
  word around that the engagement has been dissolved."</p>

  <p>"Who by?" asked the startled youth.</p>

  <p>"By whom, is better English," said Jake gently, "but if you are asked that
  question, hand 'em my card... does she speak English?"</p>

  <p>Fanelly nodded.</p>

  <p>"With a strong Aberdeen accent," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good!" nodded Jake in all seriousness. "Then the last obstacle to our
  happy union has been removed."</p>

  <p>She spoke English very prettily, when she came upon Jake bandaging his
  ankle on the mountain road.</p>

  <p>It was a sprained ankle for the time being.</p>

  <p>"Are you English?" she asked, as she helped him to a convenient bank.</p>

  <p>"Scottish," said Jake somberly. "Aberdeen&mdash;maybe you have heard of
  the place?"</p>

  <p>He was a liar and a scoundrel, and was prepared to admit it. For the
  moment there was no necessity. She sat by his side whilst the half-bred
  terrier pup gnawed and pulled at loose ends of the bandage. And there was
  such beauty in the world and in his heart, that Jake Harrison was prepared to
  find excuses for the deception he was practising.</p>

  <p>Funchal is a jewel of an island. Above them, as they sat, the scarp of the
  Sierra was a gray-banner flung against the blue. Beneath, the land lay in
  irregular squares of brown and emerald and gold. Funchal was a dainty toy-
  town, perched on a ledge of rock that jutted into the blue Atlantic. And the
  air was sweet with the aromatic fragrance of fruit and flowers.</p>

  <p>"It is a wonderful island: I was born here," she said simply, "and I
  suppose I shall die here."</p>

  <p>"God forbid," said Jake fervently.</p>

  <p>He met her again the next day, and then every day, and learnt more than
  Fanelly could have told him. She certainly was engaged to Colonel Pinto
  Muello. She spoke of the fact without enthusiasm. And Jake discovered why she
  had not been married off before. Her successive guardians had successively
  administered her estate. Each governor stole a little on one pretext or
  another. Now there was nothing left to steal. She did not state the case as
  crudely. She spoke of "expenses of administration," but Jake was an impartial
  student of graft in all its forms, and supplied his own interpretation.</p>

  <p>The last governor to arrive had discovered to his intense annoyance that
  the Savalla estate, which was and had been for years regarded as a perquisite
  of office, was no longer there to be "administered." Having nothing else to
  sell, he sold the girl. Pinto Muello was a rich man.</p>

  <p>On the ninth day of meeting, Jake met the colonel. He was a stout, tightly
  uniformed man, with a heavy black moustache, which he twisted with a quick
  "wiping" gesture, the result of many years of practice, and Jake gazed in
  fascination at the large mole on the side of his chin and wondered how often
  the colonel shaved.</p>

  <p>In manner he was fiery and made gurgling noises in his throat. This, Jake
  gathered, was an expression of his fierceness.</p>

  <p>"You are the operator in charge?" he demanded insolently.</p>

  <p>"I admit it," said Jake.</p>

  <p>"There has not come a cable for me, yes, no!"</p>

  <p>Jake Harrison shook his head with exasperating slowness. Moles were
  supposed to be lucky, he thought, yet he would not have changed places with
  the colonel. And Jake had no moles.</p>

  <p>"Twice, four times, seven, I have come to this bureau," thundered Colonel
  Pinto Muello, thumping the counter, "and always it is no! You are certain?
  Have you messages I may look through to be sure none has escaped the
  observer! I have authority, eh! I am in command of military mens on the
  island."</p>

  <p>"So I'm told," said Jake wearily, "but if a cable comes through for you,
  it goes through to you."</p>

  <p>"If it comes through, it goes through?" repeated the colonel frowningly.
  His knowledge of idiomatic English was slight. "Remember!" he thumped the
  table again. "I have all authorities for search! I command military mens on
  the island&mdash;all of them!"</p>

  <p>"I know 'em both," said Jake.</p>

  <p>He related the conversation at tiffin to Jack Boynes; the senior operator
  grinned.</p>

  <p>"Pinto is in a devil of a state of mind," he said. "He's been to the
  office twenty or thirty times the past two days."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he's expecting a remittance," suggested Jake.</p>

  <p>It was Fanelly who supplied the explanation.</p>

  <p>"There is a whole lot of political trouble in the dear land that owns this
  island," he said. "Some people think there will be a revolution, and that
  Pinto is in it. Anyway, his police are pinching all sort of people on the
  island&mdash;why, they even shadowed me last night!"</p>

  <p>"This is fearful news," said Jake.</p>

  <p>"You can laugh, Harrison." Fanelly was very serious. "But it isn't a joke.
  Every new arrival on the island is being trailed."</p>

  <p>"That's certainly tough luck on Bonson's baby," said Jake, and big Bill
  Bonson, whose wife had augmented the population that morning, howled his
  delight.</p>

  <p>That afternoon the humorous aspect of the situation carried no appeal to
  Jake Harrison.</p>

  <p>Neither the blue of the bay nor the scarlet of wild geraniums, nor the
  sun- blazed glories of the wispy clouds that trail from peak to peak of the
  Sierra Funchal, had form or color or beauty for him as he stood stricken dumb
  on the canyon road and listened to the halting words of Inez Savalla. He knew
  the worst when he met her, and saw the ravage the all-night tears had
  made.</p>

  <p>"In three days..." she sobbed. "Oh, Jake... can't you do something,
  dear?"</p>

  <p>So far had their friendship developed from the pleasantries, the
  sympathies, the shameless deceptions, and the other correlatives of a
  sprained ankle.</p>

  <p>Jake thought powerfully. There was no ship leaving for three days, and
  though he might speak slightingly of Muello's army and his ragged
  gendarmerie, they were unpleasant facts. So, too, was the untidy prison on
  Tower Hill.</p>

  <p>A fruit boat was entering the bay as he looked, a squat tub of a boat out
  of Cadiz&mdash;there was no help from there. She was under the command of
  Pietro Manzana y Manzana. Jake had once smitten Pietro and had been fined a
  hundred milreis for his brutality.</p>

  <p>"You just trust to old Jake," was all he could say: the basis for such a
  trust was his faith in Jake.</p>

  <p>He had hardly got back to his quarters before he received a letter. It was
  written on the yellow edge of Funchal's one newspaper, the Diaro del
  Funchal,</p>

  <p>"I am a prisoner in the house; Muello has sent his aunt to stay with me,
  and there are soldiers on guard at the door. Do not expect me, dear; good-
  bye."</p>

  <p>Jake read the penciled words and rubbed his head. Fanelly, coming into the
  reading-room where Jake was sitting, asked in his aimless way if he wanted
  anything.</p>

  <p>"A red-hot miracle, my son," said Jake.</p>

  <p>The headquarters of the South-Eastern in Funchal is as near to the shore
  end of the cable as is convenient. It had the disadvantage of accessibility,
  a considerable disadvantage, remembering that Funchal is essentially a relay
  station, for the business done on the island would not pay the board of the
  most junior operator.</p>

  <p>The evening meal had finished, and all but Jake had gone their several
  ways. He alone sat at the table, his head on his hands, thinking wonderfully
  but ineffectively.</p>

  <p>He had no more thought of his brother than he had of the Grand Khan of
  Muscovy. He had not thought of the erratic Bill for years, and yet into his
  solitary meditations came this last considerable factor.</p>

  <p>The man who stood in the doorway was tall, dark, and untidy. He had a
  week's growth of beard on his cheek and his linen was even older. He came in
  softly, seeming to wriggle through a two-inch opening of the door, and he
  stood surveying the room and its rough comfort with an approving eye.</p>

  <p>Between the tramp who shuffles the countryside and the tramp who stalks
  the world, there is a great difference.</p>

  <p>The world tramp brings with him an air of self-confidence, and meets the
  most exalted personages on terms of equality. He is never abashed, never
  cringes, and is equally at home in the musty hold of a steamer or the
  gorgeous club-rooms of the colonial aristocracy.</p>

  <p>With his hands thrust deep into the pockets of his stained and ragged
  trousers, he regarded the gloomy and unconscious figure of Jake with a smile
  of amusement.</p>

  <p>Presently Jake looked round, took a good look at the newcomer, and rose
  slowly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Where in hell have you been, Bill!" he demanded, and a wise observer
  would have known immediately that Jake Harrison was talking to his brother,
  and by his attitude of domination, his younger brother.</p>

  <p>Bill Harrison came forward to the table, seated himself, and viewed the
  scraps of food which were left with the eye of a connoisseur.</p>

  <p>"I've just blown in," he said.</p>

  <p>"0n the <i>Onzona</i>?"</p>

  <p>Bill Harrison selected a piece of bread, buttered it calmly from a remnant
  left on the edge of a plate, and nodded.</p>

  <p>"I knew you were here: I thought I'd come along and look you up. Let me
  see, it's nearly eight years since we met, isn't it, Jake?"</p>

  <p>"Nine," said Jake. "Where have you come from?"</p>

  <p>"Cadiz," replied the other. "Do you mind passing that loaf along? Thank
  you. Have you got a drink?"</p>

  <p>Jake shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A glass of Marsala?" suggested his guest. "Except for its melancholic
  reaction, Marsala is as innocuous as grape fruit."</p>

  <p>"You'll get no drink here," said Jake. "Haven't you been drinking
  already?"</p>

  <p>"I have drunk and eaten bananas for eight days," said his brother. "There
  should be a law passed making the growing of bananas a penal offense."</p>

  <p>Jake made no comment, and the other went on. He cut a slice of bread, and
  Jake pushed toward him a plate of butter.</p>

  <p>"I got to Cadiz," said the wanderer, "from Malta, on a C. and I. boat that
  was short of a steward. Before then I was in Alexandria: a pretty mean kind
  of place, but not so mean as Colombo. I tossed up whether I'd go across to
  Rio, or whether I 'd look in here, and you won."</p>

  <p>"You won, you mean," said Jake.</p>

  <p>"Very likely," said the visitor carelessly, and then: "what is wrong here?
  Has Funchal gone dry or is there an election in progress?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There are so many things wrong on this damned island that I couldn't
  start telling you," said Jake testily. "Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>The other shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said, "except that I've been followed around by a cop
  ever since I landed."</p>

  <p>"You don't tell me," said Jake sarcastically. "Why they should shadow a
  well- set-up young fellow like you is beyond my understanding. I will send a
  note to the governor." He winced at the word "governor," and his grimace did
  not escape the attention of his brother, who was a student of humanity.</p>

  <p>Jake walked to the door and beckoned his relative with a jerk of his
  head.</p>

  <p>"Come along, I'll find you a bed," he said. "! suppose I shall have to
  keep you for a day or two."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later Mr. Bill Harrison was sucking luxuriously at a long
  black cigar in his brother's room.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to sleep here tonight. Tomorrow I'll get you a place in the
  town," said Jake.</p>

  <p>"A glass of Madeira," murmured Bill, "and I should be in paradise= Madeira
  is a sedative, and excellent for the tired business man. Its pathological
  effects are exaggerated. And it is cheap."</p>

  <p>"You'll drink ice-water," snarled Jake.</p>

  <p>Bill Harrison nodded calmly.</p>

  <p>"Ice-water is poison, but is not as deadly as the fruit of the <i>musa
  sapientium</i>, or as the vulgar describe it, the banana."</p>

  <p>Later Jake had to vouch for his identity to a suspicious chief of
  police.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't know who he is," said Jake icily. "He has come out with
  excellent credentials, and he is the guest of the mess for a week or two." He
  did not admit the relationship in which the visitor stood to him, for obvious
  reasons. It was just like Bill to come barging in at this moment of crisis,
  he thought bitterly as he went on duty that night. Only a fraction of his
  mind was on the instrument he manipulated; the best of his thoughts were with
  a girl and a stout colonel of infantry in a tight- fitting uniform.</p>

  <p>At three o'clock in the morning came an urgent Government message. Jake
  was the only man on duty at the moment, Fanelly, his second in command,
  having been dispatched to make coffee. Jake wrote the words mechanically, and
  sat for a long time staring at the written message whilst Cape Town called
  frantically on his right, and Vigo chattered impatiently on his left.</p>

  <p>Although he was a poor linguist, he could both read and write the
  language, and the message ran:</p>

  <p>"To Colonel Pinto Muello, very urgent. By order of the Government you will
  arrest Almedez and assume the functions of governor. The Diaz Government has
  fallen. Long live the Revolution."</p>

  <p>There followed a code-word which Jake knew terminated all Government
  messages, and guaranteed their <i>bona fides</i>. He sat for ten minutes, and
  then hearing the footsteps of Fanelly, thrust the message into his pocket. An
  hour later he was relieved, and went back to his quarters carrying with him a
  blank message form.</p>

  <p>He switched on the light and kicked his brother awake. Bill Harrison sat
  up blinking.</p>

  <p>"Bill, do you speak this lingo very well?"</p>

  <p>"It is my native language," said Bill modestly, and then Jake outlined the
  wildest scheme that the mind of a cable operator ever evolved.</p>

  <p>"It is not a job I like," said Bill, "and it is certainly not a dry job.
  This palace, I presume, will be well stocked?"</p>

  <p>Jake swore at him for fully three minutes.</p>

  <p>"It is all very well for you to cuss," said Bill, hurt. "You ask me to
  masquerade as a new governor appointed by the Central Government. You ask me
  to bestow a wife upon you, and yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can have anything you like when it is all over," said Jake. "I'll
  borrow Bane's motor-boat, and the day after I'm married we'll get away."</p>

  <p>Bill thought for a long time, then:</p>

  <p>"Cut my hair, Jake, and lend me a suit of your society clothes. I have
  views about governing."</p>

  <p>"The only thing I ask you&mdash;in fact. Bill, I implore you&mdash;is to
  cut out the champagne," pleaded Jake, and his brother eyed him coldly.</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten that such a wine is made," he said.</p>

  <p>At half-past five, when the dawn was coming up over the eastern seas, a
  Major Corelli was wakened from his profound slumbers, and into the hands of
  this dazed man was thrust a telegram.</p>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>YOU WILL TAKE CONTROL OF THE TROOPS; ARREST COLONEL
  MUELLO AND GOVERNOR ALMEDEZ. YOU WILL CO-OPERATE WITH SEÑOR DUSA, WHO HAS
  ARRIVED SECRETLY FROM LISBOA, AND WHO IS APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF FUNCHAL. YOU
  ARE PROMOTED COLONEL AND ARE DECORATED WITH THE SECOND CLASS ORDER OF ST.
  XAVIER.</tt></p>

  <p>Probably Jake's most artistic effort was the decoration of the new
  commander of troops. By eight o'clock in the morning the evolution was
  accomplished. At seven o'clock that evening, Jake Harrison was united in the
  holy bonds of matrimony to the Senhora Inez Savalla. And he was married in
  style by the Archbishop of Funchal. The new governor had insisted upon this,
  and when Jake heard the news he quaked, for when Bill Harrison was grandiose,
  he was usually drunk.</p>

  <p>Furthermore one of the first acts of the new governor was to issue a
  decree prohibiting the consumption of bananas.</p>

  <p>Here was proof positive.</p>

  <p>"He's got as far as the sparkling wines," groaned Jake when he heard the
  news, and hurried his preparations for departure.</p>

  <p>The next morning he chartered a fiacre and drove up to the governor's
  palace. The decree against the consumption of bananas was being pasted upon
  the brick gateway as he drove in, and almost the first person he met in the
  large stone hall was the newly decorated commander of troops. He was looking
  a little wistful.</p>

  <p>"You have brought a message?" he asked eagerly, recognizing Jake, but the
  operator shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand it," said the major. "It is inexplicable! No other
  instructions have come to me, and I simply await the orders of my
  Government."</p>

  <p>Jake could have explained why no other messages came through. Some evil
  person had waded out at low tide, and had affixed an explosive charge to the
  cable connecting Funchal with Lisboa. He thought it wise not to mention this
  fact.</p>

  <p>"I want to see the governor," said Jake, and the major's face lit up.</p>

  <p>"What a man!" he said. "Only for two days has he been at the palace, and
  everything is reorganized! And what a voice!"</p>

  <p>Jake's heart sank.</p>

  <p>"Has he been singing?" he asked faintly.</p>

  <p>"In every language," said the enthusiastic major. "To me alone, you
  understand: we are as brothers." He threw out his arms expansively.</p>

  <p>"You can have him," said Jake in English.</p>

  <p>He found Governor Bill Harrison in the governor's library, and there was
  in Bill's eye a gentle sadness which confirmed Jake's worst suspicions.</p>

  <p>"Now, Bill," he said violently, when the door had closed, "you've got to
  cut this drink out. I've heard stories in the town that have kept me awake at
  night. I have the boat ready and we can leave tonight."</p>

  <p>"You leave alone," said Bill grandly. "I have a duty to perform; a duty to
  a downtrodden people, crushed under the burdens imposed by successive
  tyrants. Every democratic fibre in my body vibrates to the call of their
  necessity. Will you have a drink?"</p>

  <p>"No, I won't have a drink," shouted Jake. "You're a madman. Bill; you
  can't stay here. The Lisboa Government will send a warship, and I daresay
  there's one on its way already. And then where will you be!"</p>

  <p>"I shall defy them," said Bill dreamily, as he sat easily in his chair,
  his legs crossed, his finger tips together. "I've already summoned a meeting
  of the Cabinet, and we have decided to resist any attack upon our
  sovereignty."</p>

  <p>Jake drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Is this the effect of Marsala!" he asked bitterly.</p>

  <p>"It is a light German wine which I found in the cellar&mdash;pre-war
  stuff, Jake. You're losing the experience of a lifetime if you refuse my
  hospitality."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do!" asked Jake again.</p>

  <p>Bill shrugged his shoulders and smiled serenely.</p>

  <p>He had enlisted the services of a hairdresser. His little beard was
  trimmed to a point, his linen was faultless. Happily the late governor, now
  languishing in Tower Hill prison, had been almost Bill's size and shape.</p>

  <p>"I have given instructions to the batteries to fire upon any warship that
  attempts to enter the harbor," he said briskly. "Tomorrow morning we're
  having a meeting of the Education Board. Funchal shall be educated into an
  appreciation of our democratic ins&mdash;institutions."</p>

  <p>Jake could only stare at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Do you imagine that you're going to be allowed to remain here in peace?"
  he asked, awe-stricken.</p>

  <p>Bill nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"I think so," he said. "If those old guns don't bust!"</p>

  <p>Jake walked out of the room like a man in a dream; it couldn't be
  champagne, he thought. Champagne did not induce in Bill's hard heart a love
  for the new people he had acquired. And it couldn't be rum, because he was so
  gentle and reasonable. Besides:</p>

  <p>Bill's last words rang in his ears.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about the champagne, because there isn't any in the
  palace," he said. "There's a legend about a dozen cases having been bricked
  up by the last governor, in the hope that he would be able to come back and
  enjoy them, and I'm having a search made, but I have no great hopes,
  Jake."</p>

  <p>Jake had a very considerable sum in the bank, and this he drew before he
  went to the hotel where he had taken his wife.</p>

  <p>"Inez, my dear, we're going to have a pretty bad time," he said, "and I
  don't exactly know where the first few years of our married life will be
  spent. But of all the troubles that are likely to come along, there is one
  which we shall be spared."</p>

  <p>"What is that, Jake?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"We shan't see much of Bill," said Jake grimly.</p>

  <p>He spent the remainder of the night provisioning the motor-boat which he
  had hired on the excuse of taking a honeymoon trip to the Lesser Canaries. He
  had long since ceased to be an efficient member of the South-Eastern staff,
  but it may be said of them that knowing little, but guessing a lot, he
  carried with him a whole cargo of their good wishes when he slipped out of
  the tiny harbor in the early morning, and set the nose of the motor-boat for
  the nearest Canary island.</p>

  <p>He was three miles out when ahead of him he saw a boat on the horizon, and
  fixed his glasses upon the tiny ship that was coming over the edge of the
  world.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," he said. "It is a warship; poor old Bill!"</p>

  <p>The words were hardly spoken before there came the sound of a deep boom
  from the island, and he looked round. They could not have opened fire on the
  incoming man o' war; that was beyond the range of their antiquated pieces.
  Again the gun crashed, and after an interval, it boomed once more. They were
  firing a salute, he realized, and wondered to whom this salutation was
  offered.</p>

  <p>And then, above the governor's palace he saw a ball creep to the masthead
  and break. In the morning breezes fluttered the Union Jack, and Jake's jaw
  dropped.</p>

  <p>"He's annexed the island to England!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>Jake's brother Bill had found the champagne.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="story10"
     name="story10">10. THE JEWEL BOX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There were very few moments when Alys Southey could find
  sufficient placidity of mind to interest herself in the news of the day.</p>

  <p>Fragmentary scraps of gossip came to her in the hurried luncheon hour,
  when girls, between their semi-confidential narratives of what "he said" and
  what "she" had replied, spoke of the world outside their own large universe.
  And she knew in a dim way that the houses of the great had been robbed, that
  the Duchess of Monfort had lost her family emeralds, and that William
  Sollette, the rich American, had lost a pearl necklace of fabulous value; she
  even knew that a society man, Henry Melville, had been arrested as a result
  of a detective having found Mrs. Callagan's diamond sunburst in his overcoat
  pocket.</p>

  <p>Her drama was nearer at hand, and the complications of society were as
  nothing compared with the complex of her domestic situation. She possessed a
  stepfather and a stepmother. The stepfather had been tolerable during the
  lifetime of her mother, but when he had married again, and had imposed a new
  relationship upon her, the outlook became blacker and more hopeless than ever
  it had been. To leave the house was a simple solution&mdash;so simple that it
  was freely tendered by the few who knew the circumstances; but there was
  Olga, her sister, and Olga was fourteen, easily scared, terrified of being
  left to the mercy of her new mother, and Alys barely earned sufficient to
  keep one. So Alys stayed; and staying, prayed for a miracle.</p>

  <p>"And it may happen," said Olga wisely. "Perhaps Pots will get tired of us
  and give you the money to keep me." (Her stepfather's name was Potter.) "Or
  you may have a lot of money, Alys darling."</p>

  <p>"Brown and Helder never pay more than thirty shillings a week, even for
  their best assistants," sighed Alys wearily, "and I'm not their best
  assistant!"</p>

  <p>The child's forehead puckered in a frown.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that handsome man who buys gloves every day&mdash;" she began,
  but Alys stopped her.</p>

  <p>"01ga, don't be a goop!" she said, with a little smile. "Fairy princes
  avoid Oxford Street."</p>

  <p>"I saw him yesterday," said Olga, after a moment's thought. "He was
  talking to the milkman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Alys stared at her.</p>

  <p>"You saw him!&mdash;my darling, you don't know him. And is he likely to
  come to Kilburn? I don't suppose he knows the place."</p>

  <p>But the child was emphatic.</p>

  <p>"I know it was him&mdash;he," she insisted. "You've described him so that
  I'm sure I recognized him. And he had a beautiful big car waiting at the end
  of the street. I'm sure he was making inquiries about you."</p>

  <p>Alys gasped.</p>

  <p>"You shall have no more detective stories from the library," she warned.
  "You're dreaming."</p>

  <p>The mysterious and good-looking stranger who had piqued the curiosity of
  the staff by buying a new pair of gloves every day had become almost part of
  her daily life. Sometimes he amused, sometimes irritated her. She had woven
  many stories about him, but never once did she associate him with romance,
  for romance played no part in her day-dreams.</p>

  <p>It was at ten that night that the bolt she had feared was launched.</p>

  <p>Mr. Potter, a stout, bald man, entirely dominated by his shrewish young
  wife, cleared his throat before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Alys, don't you think yon could get a better job?... It is a great
  expense to me, keeping two big girls like you and Olga... you ought to be
  able to support your sister... When I was your age&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He rambled off into reminiscences, but his wife brought him up with a
  jerk.</p>

  <p>"I'm tired of people asking me if I'm your sister, and if Mr. Potter is my
  father. It makes things so very, very awkward, my dear. It sort
  of&mdash;well, it emphasizes the May and December-ness of my marriage, and
  I'm getting fed up!"</p>

  <p>"But I can't possibly earn enough to keep us," protested Alys. "If father
  would give me an allowance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Potter bridled.</p>

  <p>"An allowance! If he would give me an allowance, I should be glad! What
  nonsense! Of course you could earn enough&mdash;or you could marry. Young
  Phillips has asked you, and his father is well off."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Phillips is out of the question," said Alys, rising. "Just give me a
  day or so to think it over."</p>

  <p>It was lightly said, but not a day or two, or even a year or two, could
  solve her problem, thought Alys, as she went up the stairs with a heavy
  heart.</p>

  <p>Yet, in twenty-four hours, the solution came...</p>

  <p>The girl at the glove counter recognized the tall young man who was moving
  slowly through the store in her direction, and hardened her pretty face into
  a frown.</p>

  <p>Any other girl in the store would have been flattered by the marked and,
  so far, respectful attention of this man about town.</p>

  <p>Some of them knew his name&mdash;knew, through the porters' department,
  that he occupied one of the best suites at the Ritz-Carlton; knew that he
  used, even if he did not own, two speedy cars&mdash;a very desirable friend
  for a shop-girl scornful of the conventions and immensely satisfied that she
  could look after herself."</p>

  <p>His name was Stenton. He was, according to reliable accounts, a rich man,
  and he had come on successive days to the Universal Store, had walked
  straight to the glove counter, and had bought one pair of reindeer gloves,
  size eight.</p>

  <p>Alys Southey, watching his approach, recalled none of his desirable
  qualities. She only knew that for weeks she had been the target for dubious
  witticisms addressed to her by her fellow-workers; that she had been jollied
  and ragged at every meal! that she had gone red and white under crude
  raillery; and that this young man was the conscious or unconscious cause of
  it all.</p>

  <p>He walked up to the counter, settled his gold-headed cane against a chair,
  and slowly stripped his gloves. Alys waited, neither embarrassed nor unhappy
  in the consciousness that a dozen pairs of eyes watched the meeting; her own
  private embarrassment was so much more real.</p>

  <p>"I want a pair of reindeer gloves, size eight," he drawled.</p>

  <p>He was something more than ordinarily good-looking. There was a strength
  and a character in the mouth and jaw, a grave knowledge in the gray eyes that
  looked at her, a hint of purpose in his every action which did not accord
  with the mess-room's conception.</p>

  <p>"Size eight&mdash;brown or gray!" asked the girl mechanically.</p>

  <p>"Gray&mdash;you're having a pretty bad time at home."</p>

  <p>There was no pause between the words, and for a second the girl did not
  comprehend his meaning. She had half opened a drawer when she realized that
  he had put into words the disquiet of her own mind.</p>

  <p>"Why " she began. "You mustn't&mdash;you haven't any right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He could admire dispassionately the characteristic beauty of the girl, the
  slim line of her figure, the regularity of feature, the curve of lip and
  chin, the dusky blue of eyes now opened wide in pained astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Life is becoming insupportable at home," he said, examining the gloves
  and continuing in an even, conversational tone. "There's a way out."</p>

  <p>She faced him, calm and outwardly self-possessed.</p>

  <p>"Not for me," she said quietly. "I am afraid you do not understand&mdash;I
  suppose you mean no great insult to me, but it is not fair for a man of your
  position&mdash;oh, I think you are horrible!" she burst out, and he saw the
  quick rise and fall of her bosom and heard the indignant tears in her
  voice.</p>

  <p>"There is a way out," he repeated, "for you and for me. I've been watching
  you for weeks&mdash;I've had you photographed from every angle&mdash;an
  impertinence which you must forgive. And I want your services. I will give
  you two thousand pounds, and I will ask nothing that a good woman cannot
  give."</p>

  <p>She stared at him, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but I don't know you&mdash;I've never met you before you came
  here&mdash;I've not spoken to you until today&mdash;it is absurd to pretend
  you love me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't," he said.</p>

  <p>He was turning over the gloves that lay in the drawer she had put before
  him, and he seemed to the watchers behind the ribbon counter to be wholly
  absorbed in his inspection.</p>

  <p>"0h no, I don't love you, and I don't expect you to love me. I like you as
  a man might like a Botticelli statuette or a Corot landscape or da Vinci's
  portrait of Beatrice d'Este. One does not love those things, unless one is
  quite crazy, any more than one loves a woman for the satisfaction she brings
  to the eye. One can only love minds and characters and the intangibility
  which is called Soul&mdash;and I am not only ignorant of these factors in
  your make-up, but I am sincerely incurious."</p>

  <p>She listened, dumbfounded, perhaps a little piqued, since she was human.
  He made his selection, and she wrapped his purchase and scribbled his bill
  automatically.</p>

  <p>"I am not coming here again," he said as he took the pa&lt;2ket and the
  bill. "I repeat that I want you to undertake a piece of delicate work on my
  behalf, and I will pay you two thousand pounds for your services."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cyrus Stenton raised his glossy hat, and turned and walked to the
  cashier's desk.</p>

  <p>Alys looked after him; then a glimpse of something white on the counter
  brought her eyes down. It was a visiting card, and underneath the name was
  written:</p>

  <p class="letter">"My 'phone number is Regent 1764, Extension 9. Meet me at 7
  o'clock at Fozolli's restaurant. Private Room No. 4."</p>

  <p>For the remainder of the day Alys moved like one in a dream. It was so
  fantastical, so unreal, so like all the stories she had ever read. All her
  reason told her that men did not offer girls £2000 for any service that they
  could honestly perform, and yet her instinct told her that there was no
  danger from this tall, good-looking stranger.</p>

  <p>It was early closing day, and she left the store soon after two o'clock
  and made her way home. Olga was at school&mdash;at the cheap little school
  which Mr. Potter had chosen for her.</p>

  <p>£2000! What would it mean to Olga? An end to this life of fret and strain,
  a good school for Olga, and an opportunity for herself to take up the Art
  course she longed for.</p>

  <p>Again the doubt came to her mind with overwhelming force. Why should a man
  pay her £2000 for a simple duty which any girl might perform? But was it?</p>

  <p>Throughout that afternoon, in the privacy of her little attic bedroom, she
  wrestled with this grotesque problem. At half-past six she was hovering in
  the region of Fozolli's, with neither the courage to take the bold step or to
  withdraw. Seven o 'clock struck, and, summoning all her courage, she crossed
  the road quickly and passed into the broad vestibule of the famous
  restaurant. The liveried attendant seemed to be expecting her.</p>

  <p>"You're come for Mr. Stenton?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered breathlessly. "I&mdash;I want to speak to him."</p>

  <p>She knew how feeble was the reply, and hated herself for the weakness she
  was showing. Before she could order her thoughts, the elevator had taken her
  up two floors, and she was conducted along a broad, heavily carpeted
  corridor. The attendant stopped before a rosewood door and tapped gently;
  then, as a voice bade him come in, he opened the door and, stepping aside to
  allow her to pass, closed it behind the girl.</p>

  <p>She was in a room quietly but luxuriously furnished. A table was laid for
  two, and, most grateful sight of all, a woman of middle age in the uniform of
  a serving-maid was standing near a second door. Mr. Stenton was in evening
  dress, and was even better-looking than she had imagined. She was
  sufficiently human to notice this fact before he came toward her.</p>

  <p>"This is indeed very good of you. Miss Southey," he said, taking her hand
  for a moment. "You would like to take your coat off? Mary, will you please
  attend to Miss Southey?"</p>

  <p>Scarcely knowing what she did, Alys followed the woman into the second
  room. It was a dressing-room, for on the settee was spread a beautiful gown.
  The table held a variety of articles, including a diamond and platinum chain,
  a double row of pearls, and an open case in which glittered a beautiful bar
  brooch.</p>

  <p>She looked around for the owner, and Mary, the maid, smiled as if she
  guessed the girl's thoughts, which, however, Alys did not put into
  [words.</p>

  <p>She returned to the man, and found him, his hands clasped behind him,
  looking out of the window, evidently absorbed in his thoughts, for he started
  when she spoke to him. Throughout the meal no reference was made to the
  object of her visit or to the £2000. It was not until the maid had withdrawn
  that he came directly to the subject.</p>

  <p>"Miss Southey," he said, "I am going to asK you to do something for me
  which you may well hesitate to agree to, since behind a very simple service
  you may imagine there lurk all manner of sinister meanings. I must start
  right off by telling you that my name is not Stenton&mdash;though I am not
  prepared at the moment to tell you what it really is. How late can you remain
  out tonight?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him quickly, suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Until midnight," she said, "or even till later. There is a dance at the
  Art School, and I had half made up my mind to go."</p>

  <p>"An Art student?" He raised his eyebrows. "Really I I was hoping that you
  had some such interest. You are not a typical shop lady," he smiled.</p>

  <p>"There isn't such a thing as a typical shop girl," she replied quietly.
  "There are typical girls and typical men, and the fact that they are engaged
  in one or another profession or business doesn't alter the type."</p>

  <p>He seemed surprised at her answer, and looked at her again a little oddly.
  And then he put his hand in the pocket of his evening coat and took out a
  flat leather case. This he opened. She did not look at him during the
  process, but it required all her control to keep her eyes averted. She heard
  the rustle of banknotes, and his hand came across the table.</p>

  <p>"Here are ten notes for a hundred pounds^ each," he said. "I will give you
  this in advance as an earnest of my sincerity. The other thousand you will
  receive when your work is completed."</p>

  <p>"How long will it take!" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It may take a week&mdash;a month. It may be finished tonight. I hope it
  will be finished tonight," he said gravely. And then: * * I may want you
  tomorrow. What will happen supposing you do not go back to the store!"</p>

  <p>"I shall get the sack," she said, with a faint smile, * * and I shall
  forfeit exactly sixteen shillings of my pay."</p>

  <p>"I think that can be remedied." His voice was grave. He was considering
  this little problem of hers as profoundly as though it were the fate of an
  empire. "That, of course, can be remedied, and the sixteen shillings can be
  made good."</p>

  <p>She laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that the sixteen shillings matters much in relation to a
  thousand pounds," she said, looking down at the notes, yet afraid to touch
  them. "Mr. Stenton, what am I to do? You know so much about me that you may
  be able to advise; and though my child-like faith may sound absurd, I am
  almost willing to abide by the advice you give. Should I do this work? Is it
  work that you would ask anybody who was related to you, or whom you
  were"&mdash;she flushed&mdash;"fond of, to perform?"</p>

  <p>He considered a moment, then nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is. If you were my sister, I should ask you to help me in the
  same way," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>She took the money up, folded the notes, and put them into her bag.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me what I must do," she said, almost briskly.</p>

  <p>He looked at her for a long time before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"In the next room there are some clothes. I haven't attended to all the
  details, but Mary, who was in my mother's employ, has, I think, procured all
  the necessary articles and will assist you to dress."</p>

  <p>"Me?" she said in amazement. "You want me to wear that wonderful
  dress?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"And the pearls? Oh no!"</p>

  <p>"I want you to dress exactly as Mary suggests to you, because Mary
  knows."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him, her lips parted in amazement, her eyes bright with
  eagerness, for now the spirit of the adventure was upon her.</p>

  <p>"And then I propose taking you to a party. You will be there for exactly
  half an hour, possibly three-quarters of an hour&mdash;not longer, I should
  imagine. You will speak to nobody unless it is absolutely necessary, and I
  will give you a partner who will save you from that embarrassment. At the end
  of three-quarters of an hour you will come away; but during the time I
  imagine you will learn something."</p>

  <p>He got up from the table and, going to a sideboard, pulled open a drawer
  and took out a black portfolio. This he opened, extracting what was evidently
  a page from an illustrated weekly. It was obviously a portrait&mdash;she saw
  that at a distance&mdash;and it had been cut carefully round, so that the
  inscription below did not appear. Without a word he handed her the picture,
  and she stared and gasped. She was looking upon her own portrait.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;I don't understand," she said, bewildered. "You said
  you had had me photographed, but not in those clothes... they are not mine...
  I have never worn them."</p>

  <p>The picture that looked up to her was singularly beautiful&mdash;she had
  to admit that, in spite of the likeness to herself. About the fair throat
  were row upon row of pearls; a big diamond butterfly caught up the dress at
  the shoulder; and the hand that was held to the face was encrusted with
  rings.</p>

  <p>"Little too many, don't you think?" said Mr. Stenton. "But that is the
  fashion nowadays."</p>

  <p>She turned the page over, and saw it was from the <i>Bystander</i>.</p>

  <p>"This is not me," she said, "but the likeness is perfect."</p>

  <p>He smiled slowly.</p>

  <p>"Now don't ask any more questions. That is the one promise I want to
  extract from you, that you will not ask me, at inconvenient moments, any
  question which I might be embarrassed to answer. You will carry out all my
  instructions to the letter. You will not interfere in any scene which you may
  witness, however remarkable and sinister it may seem to you. Do you
  promise?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. Looking at his watch, he stood up.</p>

  <p>"I think we will go," he said, with a smile. "I don't know how long it
  takes a lady to dress, but I am going to give you twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>It was half an hour before she came out of the room, and at the sight of
  her he was stricken dumb. She flushed red at the admiration in his eyes, and
  for a second felt foolish.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" he breathed. "Wonderful!"</p>

  <p>The night had fallen when they came through the vestibule, a great green
  chiffon cloak about her shoulders. At the door was a big Rolls, and a footman
  was standing with the open door in his hand. Blindly, dumbly, she stepped in,
  still in a dream. She felt ridiculously like Cinderella, and expected to wake
  up any moment in the garret bedroom. These things did not happen in real
  life, she told herself again and again as the car sped through the crowded
  West End and went swiftly down Piccadilly. They only happened in story-books.
  She was dreaming.</p>

  <p>Where was the party to be? They had passed Hammersmith and were crossing
  the bridge, when she asked the question.</p>

  <p>"It is in the country," he said. "We have an hour and a half's drive,
  though we are not due for another two hours."</p>

  <p>Through Barnes and Kingston, past San-down, into Cobham. She recognized
  the places up to there; beyond that, she was in a strange land. The bright
  headlamps of the car illuminated the road, and she sat, staring through the
  window, wondering... wondering.</p>

  <p>They had been an hour on the journey when the car slowed and stopped.
  There was no house in sight, and, looking out, she saw the boles of trees on
  either side. They had come to a forest road, and for a moment her courage
  failed her.</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Now please don't be alarmed. I want you to step out, because the car is
  going to make a rather uncomfortable journey into the shelter of the trees,"
  he said kindly. "You must trust me. Miss Southey."</p>

  <p>Trembling, she stepped down upon the hard road, and he wrapped the cloak
  around her.</p>

  <p>They stood watching whilst the chauffeur put the bonnet of the car toward
  the wood, and drew it into the cover of some laurel bushes. Then the lights
  were extinguished.</p>

  <p>"You can go back now. I shall be close at hand, and you will not be
  waiting for longer than a quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>Then she saw another man. He was in evening dress; she caught the flash of
  his white shirt-front as he lit a cigarette. A man of more than middle age,
  with a gray moustache and dark, forbidding eyes. Stenton and he talked
  together in a low tone for some time. Where had he come from? He must have
  been waiting on the road for them, and that red lamp he carried in his hand
  had signalled the car to stop.</p>

  <p>She went back to the limousine, and, letting down the big plate window,
  looked out. Her eyes were now growing accustomed to the darkness, and she
  could see the two men in the road clearly. Then suddenly the red lamp began
  to wave. From the distance came the dull whine of a motor-car. The red lamp
  waved more furiously, and the man with the gray moustache was suddenly
  illuminated by the glaring headlamps of the oncoming car, which stopped
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>Stenton walked to the door and jerked it open.</p>

  <p>"I want you, Jane," he said. There was a note of harshness in his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? What do you want?"</p>

  <p>She saw a woman bend forward and heard a cry.</p>

  <p>"Philip! What is the meaning of this!"</p>

  <p>"Step out," said Stenton curtly.</p>

  <p>"I'll do no such thing; I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Step out. I don't want to use force on you. You know why I am here. Your
  scheme has been discovered."</p>

  <p>"You're a fool!" cried the woman shrilly. "And a blackguard! How dare you
  stop me, Philip!"</p>

  <p>He had whispered something to her, and the shrill quality went out of her
  voice, and she spoke now in a low tone, which did not reach the astounded
  ears of Alys Southey.</p>

  <p>She was wondering what was happening, when she saw Stenton coming toward
  her.</p>

  <p>"Now, Miss Southey," he said, "I want you to get into that car."</p>

  <p>"But why " she began.</p>

  <p>"You must ask no questions," he said almost roughly. "You promised!"</p>

  <p>His arm guiding her, she walked back to the road and, looking round, she
  saw the figure of a woman talking to the man with the gray moustache,
  vehemently, tearfully.</p>

  <p>"Get in," said Stenton, and she obeyed.</p>

  <p>The interior of the car was heavy with the aroma of an Eastern scent. She
  was about to let down the window when he stopped her.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I should do that," he said gently. "I forgot the
  scent."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what it all means, but I'll do as you tell me," she
  said.</p>

  <p>She felt that, if she gave way now, she would get hysterical. And then, to
  her surprise, he patted her hand.</p>

  <p>"The Colonel is going along with you&mdash;Colonel Dayler. I shall follow
  later."</p>

  <p>He called the man with the gray moustache, and that gentleman hurried
  toward him, and, without a word, climbed into the car, and, before she
  realized what was happening, it was moving on.</p>

  <p>"My name's Dayler. I don't know whether&mdash;Philip told you. I am a
  Colonel of the 195th "Wessex."</p>

  <p>"Who is Jane?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The extraordinary was becoming the normal. She had ceased to worry, ceased
  almost to thinK independently.</p>

  <p>The Colonel chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;Jane? Jane's a nice gel," he said and chuckled again.</p>

  <p>"I didn't promise I wouldn't ask you questions," she said presently.
  "Where are we going now?"</p>

  <p>"We're going to Lord Ilcombe's country house," said Dayler. "And you've
  got to stick tight to me, and I'll fend off all inconvenient inquiries. Until
  you feel me squeeze your arm, you're to take no notice of anybody. They'll
  certainly try to talk to you, but you trust me."</p>

  <p>She could only sit helplessly and wait. Presently the car turned from the
  road, and passed up a lordly avenue of elms, stopping before the brightly
  illuminated facade of a big house. As the footman assisted her down, she
  heard the sound of music, and, clinging tightly to the Colonel's arm, she
  passed, bewildered and puzzled, into the big hall. As she did so a butler
  opened a door. She was in a big banqueting-hall. In one gallery a band was
  playing, and the floor was crowded with dancers.</p>

  <p>Somebody nodded to her. A girl who swept past said something which she
  could not catch. And then a young man checked himself to lift his eyebrows
  and say:</p>

  <p>"You're late, Jane."</p>

  <p>"Jane!" The significance of the name came upon her with a rush. Jane was
  the woman whose portrait she had seen in the paper. She was impersonating
  her. At the thought of all that might signify, she hung heavily on the
  Colonel's arm; and realizing that she had discovered the role she was
  playing, he hurried her into an alcove and sat her in a big armchair.</p>

  <p>"Now let me assure you, Miss Southey," he said earnestly, "that you will
  have no cause to reproach yourself for this night's work. You are
  impersonating Lady Jane Dinford. That is why Philip has chosen you."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but " she began.</p>

  <p>"I swear to you, on my honor, that you will come to no harm, and that we
  are asking you to do nothing that is dishonorable," said the Colonel
  emphatically. "Your big test is to come, my dear, but I'm sure that I'll be
  able to see you through with it."</p>

  <p>It was when the dance had stopped that the test really came, for two men
  and a girl came to the alcove and greeted her.</p>

  <p>"You're not to bother Jane," said the Colonel. "She's got a fearful
  headache. Her car met with a little accident coming down, and she's shaken.
  Smile," he hissed under his breath, and Alys forced something which, she felt
  sure, looked more like a death's-head grin than the amiable smile of a pretty
  woman.</p>

  <p>The Colonel was watching. She sensed, in that quick left and right glance
  of his that swept the hall, an expectancy out of the ordinary. Presently she
  saw a woman&mdash;tall, graceful, and a little passee, crossing the room with
  slow, leisurely steps.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" whispered the Colonel. "When she speaks, you call her Edith."</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" she asked in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Lady Carleigh."</p>

  <p>As the woman came up, the Colonel rose.</p>

  <p>"You know Jane Dinford?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I think we have met," said Lady Carleigh languidly, and put out her cool
  hand.</p>

  <p>To the girl's amazement, she left behind a little wad of paper, which Alys
  had the presence of mind to conceal. Lady Carleigh did not wait, but went on
  to the next alcove as though that had been her objective.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" asked Alys fearfully.</p>

  <p>"Did she give you anything I" asked the Colonel quickly, and she passed
  him the slip of paper that the woman had left in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Let's go out," said the Colonel. His voice was husky.</p>

  <p>They crossed the floor into the hall, and, as though expecting them, a
  servant stood outside the front door with the girl's cloak on his arm. The
  car was waiting, and before she realized what had happened, she was speeding
  down the drive again. They had left the house well behind before the Colonel
  switched on the light and unrolled the ball of paper that Lady Carleigh had
  given her.</p>

  <p class="letter">"10.45 to London. Bonton Tunnel 11.17. Be on the down road
  near entrance, dressed in white so that I can see you. I will drop the box.
  It will be well wrapped."</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" asked Alys.</p>

  <p>"It means that your work will be at an end tomorrow," said the
  Colonel.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. Stenton!"</p>

  <p>"I think he has gone back to town with his cousin."</p>

  <p>"Lady Jane?"</p>

  <p>The Colonel nodded.</p>

  <p>It was nearly midnight when the car turned into a quiet London square and
  stopped before the sedate portals of a big house. The door was opened to them
  at once, and, conducted by the Colonel, she passed into a gorgeous drawing-
  room, lit by softly shaded wall- brackets. Stenton, his back to the empty
  grate, was waiting, and at the sight of the girl he came forward eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Well... do you know&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I know I was supposed to impersonate Lady Jane Dinford," she said.</p>

  <p>"We've got it, my boy," said the Colonel's voice exultantly, and he
  produced the slip of paper.</p>

  <p>Stenton read. When he had finished, he nodded.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Colonel," he said. "And now, will you go along and arrange for
  supper for Miss Southey, while I tell her the truth?"</p>

  <p>He closed the door upon his companion and turned again to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit down. Miss Southey I" he said gently. "The story I have to
  tell you is not a very long one, but I think you have had sufficient shocks
  for one evening. Nevertheless, I am going to give you another.</p>

  <p>"You have heard of the jewel robberies which have been occurring in
  various country houses?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"To those of which you know, I will add another. A few weeks ago Lord
  Ilcombe's best friend was arrested, charged with stealing a diamond ornament,
  and he is now waiting his trial. Lord Ilcombe was satisfied that his friend
  was innocent, and that the real culprits were two ladies, who apparently were
  not very great friends, but who, working in conjunction, had carried out a
  series of most audacious thefts. The reason for their conduct I will not go
  into. They are both more or less poor women, and certainly both more or less
  unscrupulous. There have been incidents at cards which it is unnecessary to
  recall.</p>

  <p>"Lord Ilcombe fixed upon these two women as the culprits, but he found it
  impossible to prove that they were acquainted with one another. The two were
  invited to the house-party, of which you were momentarily an uncomfortable
  guest. Last night Lord Ilcombe showed his guests six very valuable rubies
  that had come down to him from an ancestor of the eighteenth century. They
  were in a jewel case, and he knew that, if these women were guilty, they
  could not resist the temptation of adding yet another to their long list of
  thefts. Only one saw the casket; the other&mdash;who, I need hardly tell you,
  is Lady Jane Dinford&mdash;has been ill in London. But this morning an urgent
  wire was sent to her, asking her to come down for the evening.</p>

  <p>"Tonight his jewel case will be stolen. The loss will not be discovered
  until after the departure of the guests. Lady Carleigh will, of course, be
  the culprit. But she is clever. She was nearly caught at the Earl of
  Pinkerton's house, but managed to secrete the stolen property in the overcoat
  pocket of Lord Ilcombe's friend."</p>

  <p>"You are Lord Ilcombe?" said Alys quietly, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am Lord Ilcombe," he said.</p>

  <p>"Where is Lady Jane now?"</p>

  <p>He looked up to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"I have taken the liberty of holding he: prisoner until I have proved
  beyond doubt that my suspicions are correct. That proof has already been
  given to me by the paper which her confederate slipped into your hand."</p>

  <p>"But what is she going to do?"</p>

  <p>"She will throw the box from the window as she passes through the tunnel,
  and you will be there to take it."</p>

  <p>"But why?" interrupted Alys. "Why could she not take it to London!"</p>

  <p>"Her job is to get rid of it as quickly as she can," said Lord Ilcombe
  quietly. "The only fear I have is, that in the daylight she may recognize
  you. You must go to Bonton Tunnel to take that box from her. I know what
  you're going to say." He smiled faintly. "You are going to ask me why I do
  not have her arrested the moment I know that the box is in her possession.
  There are many reasons, not the least being that she is my mother's sister,
  and I do not want a scandal. What I want to do is to be able to furnish
  proof, without the assistance of the police, that she is the robber. And you,
  my dear young lady, are going to assist me."</p>

  <p>The girl scarcely slept that night, and long before Mr. Potter was down
  she had left the house. Lord Ilcombe's car was waiting for her, and that
  young man himself was standing talking to the chauffeur when she came up.</p>

  <p>"You have an hour's drive, and I've ordered breakfast at an inn en route,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>He was not a good conversationalist that morning. Apparently some trouble
  clouded his mind, and presently it came out.</p>

  <p>"I'm worrying about you, young lady. I think that I have scared you
  unnecessarily. I should have told you the truth at first. You see," he
  confessed, "I was rather chary of taking anybody into my confidence. Both
  these women are relatives of mine&mdash;yes, Lady Jane is my first cousin,
  and I did not want the fact to be generally known. And"&mdash;he
  hesitated&mdash;"I was very fond of Jane, and would have helped her if I'd
  known&mdash;though I doubt if I could ever have reformed her."</p>

  <p>She shot a swift glance at him, and in that moment felt a pang of sorrow
  for the woman who had sacrificed so much.</p>

  <p>It was a silent meal, that breakfast, but one which ever remained in the
  memory of the girl. Lord Ilcombe was so immersed in his thoughts that he
  scarcely answered when she spoke to him.</p>

  <p>A few minutes before eleven the car stopped near a railway line, and the
  two got out and walked along.</p>

  <p>"There is a pathway down the embankment for the use of plate-layers," said
  Ilcombe, leading the way through the hedge.</p>

  <p>Following him, the girl saw the black month of the tunnel.</p>

  <p>"I hate asking yon to go into that unpleasant-looking place, but I am
  afraid I must," smiled Ilcombe, and with a gaiety in her heart which was
  unusual, and wholly foreign to the seriousness of the business, she laughed,
  and ran down the path.</p>

  <p>The tunnel was short but dark. It was filled with the suffocating,
  sulphurous odor peculiar to tunnels, and, with a glance backward at the
  watching man, she sat down on the bank and waited. She heard the rumbling of
  the train long before it reached the far end of the tunnel, and, rising,
  walked quickly to the entrance.</p>

  <p>Would she be recognized? Would there be time for Lady Carleigh to see that
  her plot had failed! Alys moved further into the shadow of the tunnel and
  waited. With a shriek and a roar, the train thundered past, deafening her.
  Then, from a window, something big and round was thrown, striking the metals
  and rebounding almost to her feet. Stooping, she picked up the ball of paper
  and cardboard, the train vanishing in the distance.</p>

  <p>With knees that trembled, she ran up the path breathlessly and put the
  parcel in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven, that's over!" he said, and with a knife cut the string.</p>

  <p>Under the paper, wrapped in fine shavings, was a cardboard box, and within
  was yet another box, padded tightly with cotton wool.</p>

  <p>He opened this, only to reveal a third box. The girl watched eagerly. At
  last the case was revealed, and with a jerk of his finger the lid snapped
  up.</p>

  <p>As it did so, he uttered a cry of amazement. The jewels were not there.
  Instead, was a letter, which he opened.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Philip," it ran, "I recognized Jane's double the
  moment I put the paper in her hand. Even if I had not, Jane's telephone
  message this morning would have told me all I wanted to know. We are leaving
  for the Continent by the afternoon train. If you want a scandal, you can have
  us arrested.&mdash;Your loving Aunt."</p>

  <p>There was a P.S.</p>

  <p class="letter">"As you have so completely compromised your very pretty
  girl, the least you can do is to marry her."</p>

  <p>Without a word, he handed the letter to the girl.</p>

  <p>"For the first time in my life," he said, and his voice was very gentle,
  "I agree with my aunt. Let's lunch."</p>

  <p>"You've lost your rubies," she said in dismay, and he looked at her with a
  strange light in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"There's a Biblical proverb somewhere about rubies, if I remember
  rightly&mdash;the thirty-first chapter of Proverbs and the tenth verse. Look
  it up, Alys."</p>

  <h2><a id="story11"
     name="story11">11. WHITE STOCKING</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>John Trevor was not a jealous man. He told himself this a dozen times; he
  told Marjorie Banning only once.</p>

  <p>"Jealous!" she flamed, and then gaining control of her anger; "I don't
  quite understand you. What do you mean by jealous?"</p>

  <p>Jack felt and looked uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Jealous, of course, is a silly word to use, but," he blundered, "what I
  mean is suspi&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He checked himself again.</p>

  <p>They were sitting in the Park under an expansive elm, and though not far
  from the madding crowd, the crowd was sufficiently removed from its madding
  qualities to be minimized to a negligible quantity. There were within sight
  exactly three courting couples, a nurse with a perambulator, a policeman, and
  a few playing children.</p>

  <p>""What I mean to say is," said Jack desperately, "I trust you, dear,
  and&mdash;well, I don't want to know your secrets, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But?" she repeated coldly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I merely remark that I have seen you three times driving in a
  swagger motorcar&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A client's car," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"But surely the dressing of people's hair does not occupy all the
  afternoon and evening," he persisted. "Really, I'm awfully sorry if I'm
  bothering you, but it is a fact that whenever I've seen you it has been on
  the days when you have told me you could not come to me in the evening."</p>

  <p>She did not answer immediately.</p>

  <p>He was making it very hard for her, and she resented, bitterly resented,
  not only his doubt and the knowledge that in his eyes her movements were
  suspicious, but that she could offer no explanation. She resented most of all
  the justification which her silence gave to him.</p>

  <p>""Who has been putting these ideas in your head?" she asked. "Lennox
  Mayne?"</p>

  <p>"Lennox!" he snorted. "How ridiculous you are, Marjorie! Lennox would not
  dream of saying anything against you, to me or anybody else. Lennox is very
  fond of you&mdash;why, Lennox introduced me to you."</p>

  <p>She bit her lips thoughtfully. She had excellent reasons for knowing that
  Lennox was very fond of her, fond in the way that Lennox had been of so many
  chance-met shop-girls, and that she also was a shop-girl brought that young
  man's admiration into a too familiar category.</p>

  <p>She was employed at a great West-End hairdresser's, and hated the work;
  indeed, hated the work more than the necessity for working. Her father, a
  small provincial doctor, had died a few years before, leaving her and her
  mother penniless. A friend of the family had known the proprietor of
  Fennett's, and old Fennett was in need of a secretary. She had come to what
  Lennox Mayne crudely described as the "woman's barbers" in that capacity.
  From secretary she had passed to a more practical side of the business, for
  the old man, a master of his craft, had initiated her into the mysteries of
  "color culture"&mdash;an artless euphonism.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry that I've annoyed you," she said primly as she got up,
  "but we shop-girls have our duties, Jack."</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake don't call yourself a shop-girl," he snapped. "Of
  course, dear, I quite accept your explanation, only why make a mystery of
  it?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly she slipped her arm in his.</p>

  <p>"Because I am paid to make a mystery of it," she said, with a smile. "Now
  take me to Fragiana's, for I'm starving."</p>

  <p>Over the meal they returned to the subject of Lennox.</p>

  <p>"I know you don't like him," said Jack. "He really is a good fellow, and
  what is more, he is very useful to me, and I cannot afford to lose useful
  friends. We were at Ruby together, but, of course, he was always a smarter
  chap than I. He has made a fortune, while I am struggling to get together the
  necessary thousand that will enable me to introduce you to the dinkiest
  little suburban home&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She put her hand under the table and squeezed his.</p>

  <p>"You're a darling," she said, "but I hope you will never make your money
  as Lennox has made his."</p>

  <p>He protested indignantly, but she went on, with a shake of her head:</p>

  <p>"We hear queer stories, we dyers of ladies' faded locks," she said, * *
  and Lennox is awfully well known in London as a man who lives by his
  wits."</p>

  <p>"But his uncle " he began.</p>

  <p>"His uncle is very rich, but hates Lennox. Everybody says so."</p>

  <p>"That is where you're wrong," said Jack triumphantly. "They have been bad
  friends, but now they are reconciled. I was dining with Lennox last night,
  when you were gadding around in your expensive motor-car&mdash;I didn't mean
  that unpleasantly, dear&mdash;anyway I was dining with him, and he told me
  that the old man was most friendly now. And what is more," he lowered his
  voice confidentially, "he is putting me in the way of making a fortune."</p>

  <p>"Lennox?" said the girl incredulously and shook her head. "I can imagine
  Lennox making a fortune for himself, or even dazzling unsophisticated maidens
  with golden prospects, but I cannot imagine him making a fortune for
  you."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Has he ever tried to dazzle you with golden prospects?" he bantered, but
  she avoided the question.</p>

  <p>She and Lennox Mayne had met at the house of a mutual friend, and then
  they had met again in the Park, as she and Jack were meeting, and Lennox had
  discovered a future for her which had certain material advantages and
  definite spiritual drawbacks. And then one Sunday, when he had taken her on
  the river, they had met Jack Trevor, and she had found it increasingly easy
  to hold at bay the philanthropist.</p>

  <p>They strolled back to the Park as the dusk was falling, and entering the
  Marble Arch gate they passed an untidy, horsey little man, who touched his
  hat to Jack and grinned broadly.</p>

  <p>"That is Willie Jeans," said Jack, with a smile. "His father was our groom
  in the old Royston days. I wonder what he is doing in London?"</p>

  <p>"What is he?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"He is a tout."</p>

  <p>"A tout?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; a tout is a man who watches racehorses. Willie is a very clever
  watcher. He works for one of the sporting papers, and I believe makes quite a
  lot of money."</p>

  <p>"How queer!" she said and laughed.</p>

  <p>"What amuses you?" he asked in surprise, but she did not tell him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>The man who sprawled motionless along the top of the wall had certain
  strange, chameleonlike characteristics. His mottled green coat and his dingy
  yellow breeches and gaiters so completely harmonized with the ancient wall
  and its overhanging trees, that nine passers-by out of ten would have failed
  to notice him. Happily for his peace of mind, there were no passers-by, the
  hour being seven o'clock on a sunny May morning. His elbows were propped on a
  patch of crumbling mortar, a pair of prismatic glasses were glued to his
  eyes, and on his face was a painful grimace of concentrated attention.</p>

  <p>For twenty minutes he had waited in this attitude, and the stout man who
  sat in the car drawn up some distance along the road sighed patiently. He
  turned his head as he heard the descent of the watcher.</p>

  <p>"Finished?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Huh," replied the other.</p>

  <p>The stout man sighed again and set the rattling machine running toward the
  village.</p>

  <p>Not until they were on the outskirts of Baldock did the dingy watcher
  regain his speech.</p>

  <p>"Yamen's lame," he said.</p>

  <p>The stout man, in his agitation, nearly drove the car on to the
  sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"Lame?" he repeated incredulously.</p>

  <p>Willie nodded.</p>

  <p>"He went lame when the gallop was half-way through," he said. "He'll win
  no Derby."</p>

  <p>The fat man breathed heavily.</p>

  <p>They were brothers, Willie the younger, and Paul the elder, though there
  was no greater family resemblance between the pair than there is between a
  rat and a comfortable hen.</p>

  <p>The car jerked to a stop before the Baldock Post Office, and Willie got
  out thoughtfully. He stood for some time meditating upon the broad pavement,
  scratching his chin and exhibiting unexpected signs of indecision. Presently
  he climbed back into the car.</p>

  <p>"Let's go down to the garage and get some juice on board," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the astounded brother. "I thought you were going to
  wire&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind what you thought," said the other impatiently; "go and load up
  with petrol. You can take me to London. The post office won't be open for
  half an hour."</p>

  <p>His stout relation uttered gurgling noises intended to convey his
  astonishment and annoyance.</p>

  <p>As the rattling car came back to the Stevenage Road, Willie condescended
  to explain.</p>

  <p>"If I send a wire from here, it will be all over the town in a few
  minutes," he said libellously. "You know what these little places are, and
  Mr. Mayne would never forgive me."</p>

  <p>Lennox Mayne was the principal source of the tout's income. Though he had
  a few other clients, Willie Jeans depended chiefly upon the honorarium which
  he received from his opulent patron.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jeans' profession was a curious one. He was what is described in the
  sporting press as a "man of observation," and he had his headquarters at
  Newmarket. But there are great racing establishments outside of the
  headquarters of the turf, and when his chief patron required information
  which could not be otherwise secured, Mr. Jeans traveled afar to the
  Wiltshire Downs, to Epsom, and elsewhere, in order to gain at first-hand
  knowledge of certain horses' well-being.</p>

  <p>"It was a bit of luck," he mused as he went along. "I don't suppose there
  is another man in England who could have touted old Greyman's horses. He
  usually has half a dozen men patrolling along the road to see that nobody
  sneaks over the wall."</p>

  <p>Stuart Greyman owned a large estate on the Royston Road, which was
  peculiarly adapted for so furtive and secretive a man, for a high wall
  surrounded the big park wherein his horses were trained, and his staff was
  loyalty itself.</p>

  <p>From other stables it is possible to secure valuable information through
  the judicious acquaintance of a stable-lad, but Greyman either paid his staff
  too well to allow of that kind of leakage, or he showed a remarkable
  discrimination in employing his servants. And in consequence the old man was
  something of a terror to the ring. He produced unexpected winners, and so
  well kept was his secret that until the race was over, and the money began to
  roll back from the starting-price offices, there was not the slightest hint
  that the victor was "expected." In consequence, he enjoyed the luxury of long
  prices, and every attempt that had been made to tout his horses had hitherto
  been unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>Willie's gratification was, therefore, natural and his success a little
  short of miraculous.</p>

  <p>The dust-stained car came to a stop in a decorous London square, and an
  outraged butler who answered the door hesitated for some considerable time
  before he announced the visitors.</p>

  <p>Lennox Mayne was at breakfast, a sleek-looking young man, who was less
  disconcerted than his butler at the spectacle of the untidy Mr. Jeans.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he said curtly, and when the visitors obeyed and the butler
  had closed the door&mdash;"Well?"</p>

  <p>Willie poured forth his story, and Lennox Mayne listened with a thoughtful
  frown.</p>

  <p>"The old devil!" he said softly, and not without admiration; ^ * the
  wicked old devil!"</p>

  <p>Willie agreed on principle that Stuart Grey-man was all and more than his
  loving nephew had described him, but was puzzled to know why Mr. Greyman was
  more particularly devilish that morning than any other.</p>

  <p>Lennox sat for a moment deep in thought, and then</p>

  <p>"Now, Jeans, you understand that this is a secret. Not a whisper of
  Yamen's lameness must leak out. I might tell you that ten minutes ago my
  uncle rang me up from Baldock to say that he had galloped Yamen and he had
  pulled up fit."</p>

  <p>"What!" said the indignant "Willie. "Why, that horse is as
  lame&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't doubt it," interrupted his employer, "but Mr. Greyman has a good
  reason for putting it about that Yamen is sound. He has heavily backed the
  horse to win the Derby, and he wants time to save his money. What other
  horses were in the gallop!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know his horses very well," explained Willie, "but the colt that
  made all the running was a smasher, if ever there was one. He simply carried
  the rest of the horses off their feet. I couldn't put the clock on him, but I
  know they were going a racing gallop."</p>

  <p>"You're sure it was Yamen that pulled up lame?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, sir," said the other emphatically. "I saw him run at Ascot and at
  Newmarket last year, and there is no mistaking his white legs. You don't
  often see a brown horse with four white stockings."</p>

  <p>The other meditated.</p>

  <p>"What kind of a horse was it that won the gallop?"</p>

  <p>"He was brown all over, not a speck of white on him."</p>

  <p>"H'm," mused Mr. Mayne; "that must be Fairyland. I must remember him.
  Thank you for coming," he said, as he dismissed his visitors with a nod, "and
  remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mum's the word," said Willie as he folded up the two banknotes which his
  employer had pushed across the table.</p>

  <p>Left alone, Mr. Lennox Mayne did some quick, intensive thinking. He had in
  his mind no thought of blaming his uncle. Lennox Mayne could not afford to
  condemn trickery or treachery in others, for he had not amassed a comfortable
  fortune by paying too strict an attention to the niceties of any known code
  of conduct. He was a gambler, and a successful gambler. He gambled on stocks,
  on horses, but in the main his success was due to backing and laying against
  human beings. In this latter respect he had made two <i>faux pas</i>. He had
  gambled not only upon the tolerance but upon the inferior intelligence of his
  maternal uncle, Stuart Grey-man.- He had used information given to him in
  secret by that reticent man, and to his consternation had been detected, and
  there had been an estrangement which had lasted five years, and had
  apparently ended when old Greyman met him one day at lunch at the Carlton
  Grill and had gruffly notified his forgiveness.</p>

  <p>"The old devil!" he murmured admiringly; "he nearly sold me."</p>

  <p>For old Greyman had told him, again in confidence to back Yamen for the
  Derby.</p>

  <p>Lennox Mayne trusted no man, least of all the uncle whom he suspected of
  harboring a grudge against him. Therefore had he sent his tout to confirm the
  exalted story of the lame Yamen's amazing speed. Yamen had only run twice as
  a two-year-old. He had been carefully nursed for his classic engagements, and
  at least the story which the old man had told him was plausible.</p>

  <p>So the old man was trying to catch him! Luckily, Lennox had not wagered a
  penny on the information which his uncle had brought him.</p>

  <p>If Greyman had been one of his failures, no less had Marjorie Banning.
  There were times when Lennox Mayne irritably admitted that she had been the
  greatest failure of all. She had seemed so easy. She was just so
  circumstanced that the way seemed simple.</p>

  <p>It was a coincidence that, as his mind dwelt upon her, the telephone bell
  rang shrilly and the voice of John Trevor greeted him.</p>

  <p>He heard the name and made a wry face, but his voice was pleasant
  enough.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Jack! Certainly come round. Aren't you working today? Good."</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver and returned to his table. Jack Trevor! His eyes
  narrowed. He had not forgiven this innocent friend of his, and for ten
  minutes his mind was very busy.</p>

  <p>Jack had a fairly good post in a city office, and just at that time the
  rubber trade was one of England's decaying industries, and his time was very
  much his own.</p>

  <p>Lennox received him in his study, and pushed a silver box of cigarettes
  toward his visitor.</p>

  <p>"What brings you west at this hour?" he asked. "You'll stay to lunch?"</p>

  <p>Jack shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," he blurted, "I'm a bit worried, Lennox. It is about
  Marjorie."</p>

  <p>Lennox raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"What has Marjorie been doing?" he asked. "Does she want to turn your hair
  a flaming gold?"</p>

  <p>Jack smiled.</p>

  <p>"Not so bad as that," he said; "but I know you are very fond of Marjorie.
  Lennox, you're a man of the world, whose advice is worth having,
  and&mdash;the fact is, I am worried like the devil about her." He was silent
  for a long time, and Lennox watched him curiously. "Either she has a
  mysterious friend or she has a mysterious job," said Jack at last. "Four
  times she has passed me in the street, in a most swagger car."</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she was going to see a client," suggested the other carelessly.
  "You know, even women who own luxurious motor-cars need the service of a
  trained perruquier."</p>

  <p>"Even females who own luxurious motor-cars do not require the services of
  a perruquier from three in the afternoon until eleven at night," said Jack
  grimly; "and that is the time Marjorie has returned to her diggings. I know
  it was hateful to spy on her, but that is just what I've done. She is getting
  a lot of money. I had a chat with her landlady. I called in on the pretense
  that I had called in to see Marjorie, and got her to talk about her, and she
  told me that she changed a hundred-pound check for her."</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Lennox. He was as puzzled as his friend. His agile brain was
  busy, and presently he said:</p>

  <p>"There is certain to be a simple explanation, my dear chap, so don't
  worry. Marjorie is not flighty, whatever else she is. When are you going to
  get married?"</p>

  <p>Jack shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows," he said. "It is all very well for you to talk about
  marriage, because you're a rich man, but for me it means another twelve
  months of saving."</p>

  <p>"Have you fixed the sum on which you can get married?" asked Lennox, with
  a smile.</p>

  <p>"A thousand pounds," replied Jack, "and I've got about six hundred towards
  it."</p>

  <p>"Then, my dear chap, I'll put you in the way of getting not a thousand,
  but ten thousand."</p>

  <p>Jack stared at him.</p>

  <p>"What the dickens are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"I'm talking about the dark Yamen," said Lennox, "my uncle's horse. I told
  you the other day that I would make your fortune&mdash;I am going to do
  it."</p>

  <p>He got up, went to a table, and took up the morning paper, turning its
  pages.</p>

  <p>"Here is the betting," he said. "One hundred to six Yamen&mdash;and Yamen
  is as certain to win the Derby as you are to marry your nice little girl. I
  can get you ten thousand to six hundred today&mdash;tomorrow the price may be
  shorter."</p>

  <p>"Good lord! I couldn't lose six hundred pounds," gasped Jack, and the
  other laughed.</p>

  <p>"If you knew how small a risk it was you wouldn't yammer like a sheep. I
  tell you this is money for nothing."</p>

  <p>"Suppose I had sixty pounds on it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sixty pounds?" sneered the other. "My dear chap, what is the use of
  making money in pennies? Here is the chance of your lifetime, and, unless you
  are a lunatic, you will not miss it. Tomorrow the horse will be nearer six to
  one than sixteen, and you can lay out your money and stand to win a fortune
  at practically no risk to yourself."</p>

  <p>He spoke for half an hour on horses&mdash;of Yamen, its speed, its
  breeding&mdash;and Jack listened fascinated.</p>

  <p>"I'll ring up a bookmaker and put it on for you."</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait," said Jack hoarsely as the other reached for the telephone;
  "it is a fearful lot of money to risk, Lennox."</p>

  <p>"And a fearful lot of money to win," said the tempter. If he had had more
  time, he would have arranged the bet so that the six hundred pounds fell into
  his pocket, but that was impossible. Jack Trevor must be caught immediately
  or not at all&mdash;must be given no time to reflect or to seek advice, and
  certainly no time to discover that Yamen was a cripple. The secret might leak
  out at any moment; a disgruntled stable-boy, a chance spy, a too-talkative
  veterinary surgeon&mdash;any of these might talk and the stable's secret
  would be revealed. The loss of six hundred might not prevent a contemptuous
  little hairdressing girl from marrying&mdash;it would certainly postpone the
  event.</p>

  <p>"I'll do it," said Jack, with a gasp, and listened as in a dream to his
  placid companion's voice.</p>

  <p>"Put it to the account of Mr. John Trevor, Castlemaine Gardens... Yes,
  I'll be responsible. Thank you."</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver, and looked round at the other with a queer
  smile.</p>

  <p>"I congratulate you," he said softly, and Jack went back to the city, his
  head in a whirl, even the mystery of his fiancee's movements obscured by the
  tremendous realization of his own recklessness.</p>

  <p>Marjorie Banning heard the news and dropped into a twopenny park chair.
  Happily, the chair was there.</p>

  <p>"You've put all the money on a horse?" she said hollowly. "Oh, Jack!"</p>

  <p>"But, my dear," said Jack stoutly, "the money is as good as mine, and all
  that Lennox said is true. The horse was sixteen to one yesterday and it is
  only eight to one today."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jack!" was all she could say.</p>

  <p>He had to find conviction for himself. He was miserably conscious of his
  own folly, and had cursed himself that he had ever listened to the voice of
  temptation.</p>

  <p>"It is all right, Marjorie," he said, with poorly simulated cheerfulness;
  "the horse belongs to Lennox Mayne's uncle. He told Lennox that it is certain
  to win. Think what ten thousand pounds means, Marjorie dear..."</p>

  <p>She listened, unconvinced. She who knew with what labor and sacrifice his
  little nest-egg had been gathered, who understood even more clearly than he
  what its loss would entail, could only sit with a blank sense of despair at
  her heart.</p>

  <p>At that moment Mr. Lennox Mayne was experiencing something of her dismay,
  though the cause was a little different. Summoned by telegram, he who had
  been described as the "Prince of Touts"&mdash;though a more untidy, unshaven,
  and uncomfortable prince had never borne such a title&mdash;had come
  post-haste to Manchester Square, and whilst the grimy Ford, with its stout,
  hen-like driver, stood at the door, Mr. Willie Jeans fidgeted uneasily and
  endured -with such patience as he could command the flow of his employer's
  abuse.</p>

  <p>"You're a blundering jackass, and I was a fool to hire you," stormed
  Lennox Mayne. "What is the use of touting a horse if you're seen touting? I
  told you that you were not to let anybody know that you were connected with
  me, you drivelling fool, and you've been talking."</p>

  <p>"No, I ain't," said the other indignantly. "I never talk. Do you think I
  should be able to earn a living if I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've been talking. Listen to this." Lennox snatched up a letter from
  the table.</p>

  <p>"This is from my uncle. Listen to this, you damned fool:</p>

  <p class="letter">"You are not satisfied with my information, it seems, but
  employ your tout to spy on my training. You can tell Mr. Willie Jeans from me
  that if ever he is again seen in or near my estate, he will get the biggest
  flogging he has ever had in his life..."</p>

  <p>The following paragraph, which gave Stuart Greyman's opinion of his
  nephew, Lennox did not read.</p>

  <p>"I never knew anybody saw me; there was nobody about when I was on the
  wall," grumbled Mr. Jeans. "I've earned my fifty, if ever a man has earned
  it."</p>

  <p>"You'll get no fifty from me," said Lennox. "I've given you as much money
  as you're entitled to, and don't come near me again."</p>

  <p>When Mr. Willie Jeans joined his brother, he was in no amiable frame of
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going now?" asked that placid man.</p>

  <p>Willie suggested a place which has the easiest and most varied of routes,
  and his brother, who was not unused to these temperamental outbursts, held on
  his way, for their original destination had been Epsom. A policeman at Hyde
  Park raised a warning hand at the sight of the ramshackle machine, but Mr.
  Willie Jeans' flivver was a "private car" within the meaning of the Act, and
  they joined the resplendent procession of machines that were moving slowly
  through the Park.</p>

  <p>It was Fate that made the oil lubrication choke within a dozen paces of
  where two disconsolate lovers were sitting.</p>

  <p>"What a queer car!" said the girl; "and isn't that the man you saw the
  other day&mdash;the tout, did you call him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Jack gloomily; "that's the tout," and then suddenly, "I wonder
  if he knows?"</p>

  <p>He rose and walked across to the man, and Willie touched his cap.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Trevor."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going!" asked Jack.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to Epsom, to watch the Derby gallops. Most of the horses are
  there now, but," he grinned unpleasantly, "not Yamen."</p>

  <p>"Why isn't he there?" asked Jack, with a sickening of heart, for he
  instinctively recognized the hostility which the little man displayed toward
  the horse on whose well-being so much depended.</p>

  <p>"Because he'll never see a racecourse&mdash;that's why," said the other
  savagely.</p>

  <p>"He'll never see a racecourse? What do you mean?" asked Jack slowly.</p>

  <p>"He is lame," said the little man. "I hope you haven't backed him?" he
  asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>Jack nodded.</p>

  <p>"Come over here," he said. "This is pretty bad news I've heard, Marjorie,"
  he said. "Jeans says that Yamen is lame."</p>

  <p>"That's right," nodded the tout, "as lame as old Junket. That is another
  one of Mr. Greyman's. You remember him, sir; he always looked as if he was
  winning in a canter and then went lame in the last hundred yards."</p>

  <p>"I don't know much about horses," said Jack. "I want you to tell me about
  Yamen. How long has it been lame?"</p>

  <p>"Three days," said the little man. "I have been touting it for a week. It
  broke down in the winding-up gallop."</p>

  <p>"But does Mr. Greyman know!"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Greyman!" said the little man scornfully; "why, of course he knows.
  He didn't let on to Lennox Mayne, but I told Lennox Mayne, and a fat lot of
  thanks I got for it."</p>

  <p>"When did you tell him?" asked Jack, going white.</p>

  <p>"The day before yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Then Lennox Mayne knew!"</p>

  <p>Jack was bewildered, shocked beyond expression.</p>

  <p>"It can't be true," he said. "Lennox would never&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lennox Mayne would give away his own aunt," said Willie Jeans
  contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Was it Lennox Mayne who persuaded you to back this horse?" asked the
  girl.</p>

  <p>Jack nodded.</p>

  <p>"You are sure Yamen is lame!"</p>

  <p>"I swear to it. I know Yamen as I know the back of my hand," said the
  little man emphatically. "The only horse with four white stockings in the
  Baldock stables&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Baldock!" The girl was on her feet, staring. "Baldock, did you say?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, miss."</p>

  <p>"Who lives there?" she asked quickly. "What is his name?"</p>

  <p>"Greyman."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a man is he?"</p>

  <p>"He is an old man about sixty, gray-haired, and as hard as a nail. A
  cunning old devil he is, too; I'll bet he's too cunning for Lennox
  Mayne."</p>

  <p>She was silent a long time after the little man had gone on his shaky way,
  and then most unexpectedly, most surprisingly, she asked:</p>

  <p>"Will you take me to see the Derby, Jack?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! I didn't expect you'd be interested," he said, "and it will be
  an awful crush."</p>

  <p>"Will you take me? You can hire a car for the day, and we could see the
  race from the roof. Will you take me?"</p>

  <p>He nodded, too dumbfounded to speak. She had never before evinced the
  slightest interest in a horse race.</p>

  <p>Some rumor of the dark Yamen's infirmity must have crept out, for on the
  morning of the race the horse was quoted amongst the twenty-five to one
  brigade, and hints of a mishap appeared in the morning Press.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"We hear," said the <i>Sporting Post</i>, "that all is
  not well with Mr. Greyman's dark candidate, Yamen. Perhaps it is wrong to
  describe him as 'dark,' since he has already run twice in public, but until
  his name appeared prominently in the betting-list, very few had the slightest
  idea that the colt by Mandarin-Ettabell had any pretensions to classic
  events. We hope, for the sake of that good sportsman, Mr. Stuart Greyman,
  that rumor was exaggerated."</p>

  <p>Marjorie had never been to a race-meeting before, and possibly even the
  more sedate meetings would have astonished her, but Epsom was a revelation.
  It was not so much a race-meeting as a great festival and fair. The people
  frightened her. She tried, as she stood on the roof of the car, to calculate
  their number. They blackened the hills, they formed a deep phalanx from one
  end of the course to the other, they packed the stands and crowded the rings,
  and between races filled the course. The thunderous noise of them, their
  ceaseless movement, the kaleidoscopic color, the booths and placards even
  more than the horses held her interest.</p>

  <p>"There are all sorts of rumors about," said Jack, returning from his tour
  of discovery. "They say that Yamen doesn't run. The papers prepared us for
  that. I am horribly afraid, dear, I've been a fool."</p>

  <p>She bent down over the edge of the roof and took his hand, and to his
  amazement he discovered she had left a paper in it.</p>

  <p>"What's this&mdash;a banknote? Are you going to have a bet?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I want you to make a bet for me," she said.</p>

  <p>"What are you backing!"</p>

  <p>"Yamen," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Yamen!" he repeated incredulously, and then looked at the note. It was
  for a hundred pounds. He could only stare helplessly at her.</p>

  <p>"But you mustn't do this, you really mustn't."</p>

  <p>"Please," she insisted firmly.</p>

  <p>He made his way to Tattersalls' ring, and after the race preliminary to
  the Derby had been run, he approached a bookmaker whose name he knew. The
  numbers were going up when he got back to her.</p>

  <p>"I got two thousand to a hundred for you," he said&mdash;"and I nearly
  didn't."</p>

  <p>"I should have been very angry with you if you hadn't," said Marjorie.</p>

  <p>"But why " he began, and then broke off as the frame of the number board
  went up. "Yamen is running," he said.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew better than the girl that Yamen was running. She watched the
  powder-blue jacket in the preliminary parade, and caught a glimpse of the
  famous white stockings of Mandarin's son as he cantered down to the post. Her
  arm was aching with the labor of holding the glasses, but she never took them
  off the powder-blue jacket until the white tape flew upward and the roar of
  two hundred thousand voices cried in unison:</p>

  <p>"They're off!"</p>

  <p>The blue jacket was third as the horses climbed the hill, fourth on the
  level by the railway turn, third again as the huge field ran round Tattenham
  Corner into the straight, and then a strident voice from a near-by bookmaker
  shouted:</p>

  <p>"Yamen wins for a pony!" as the dark Yamen took the lead and won hard-
  held by three lengths.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"I don't know how to begin the story," she said that night. They were
  dining together, but Marjorie was hostess.</p>

  <p>"It really began about a month ago, when an old gentleman came into the
  shop and saw Mr. Fennett, the proprietor. They were together about ten
  minutes, and then I was sent for to the private office. Mr. Fennett told me
  that the gentleman had a special commission, and he wanted an expert to
  undertake some dyeing work. I thought at first it was for himself, and I was
  rather sorry that a nice-looking old gentleman should want to interfere with
  his beautiful white hair. I didn't actually really know for what purpose I
  was required until the next week, when his car came for me and I was driven
  to Baldock. And then he told me. He asked me if I had brought the bleaching
  and dyeing material with me, and when I told him that I had, he let me into
  the secret. He said he was very fussy about the color of horses, and he had a
  wonderful horse with white legs, and that he objected to white legs. He
  wanted me to dye the legs a beautiful brown. Of course I laughed at first, it
  was so amusing, but he was very serious, and then I was introduced to this
  beautiful horse&mdash;who was the most docile client I have ever treated,"
  she smiled.</p>

  <p>"And you dyed his legs brown?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"But that was not all. There was another horse whose legs had to be
  bleached. Poor dear, they will be bleached permanently, unless he dyes them
  again. I know now, but I didn't know then, that it was a horse called Junket.
  Every few days I had to go to Baldock and renew the dye and the bleach. Mr.
  Greyman made it a condition with Mr. Fennett that my commission should be
  kept a secret even from the firm, and of course I never spoke about it, not
  even to you."</p>

  <p>"Then when I saw you in the car&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was on my way to Baldock to dye and bleach my two beautiful clients,"
  she laughed. "I know nothing about racehorses, and I hadn't the slightest
  idea that the horse I had dyed was Yamen. In fact, until Willie Jeans
  mentioned the word 'Baldock' I had not connected the stable with the
  Derby.</p>

  <p>"The morning after I left you I had an engagement to go to Baldock to
  remove the dye&mdash;Mr. Greyman had told me that he had changed his mind,
  and that he wanted the horse to have white legs again. And then I determined
  to speak to him and tell him just how you were situated. He told me the
  truth, and he swore me to secrecy. He was reconciled to Lennox and told him
  all about Yamen. And then he discovered that Lennox did not believe him and
  was having the horses watched. He was so angry that, in order to deceive his
  nephew's watcher, he had the horse's legs dyed, and gave the&mdash;the tout a
  chance of seeing poor Junket with his bleached legs break down&mdash;as he
  knew he would. He told me he had backed Yamen to win him a great
  fortune."</p>

  <p>"So you, of all people, on Epsom Downs knew that Yamen would win."</p>

  <p>"Didn't I back him?" asked the dyer of legs.</p>

  <p class="poem">"Who knows where I may sleep to-night.<br>
  On what dark moor or what wild shore?<br>
  With starry robes of Heaven for gown,<br>
  I'll lay my bruisèd body down.<br>
  My bed the em'rald bracken bright&mdash;<br>
  Who knows where I shall sleep to-night?"</p>

  <p>If it were not for the fact that this was Poggy's favorite ballad, Ferdie
  would have said nothing. But whenever Letty sat down and twiddled the keys
  and turned over the music and said, "I don't like that," or "That's a
  beautiful song, but I can't sing it properly," or strummed and hummed
  another, and finally ran her white hand down the crease of "The Song of the
  Zingari," Ferdie used to sit back and recite the multiplication table to
  himself until she struck the final chord. Poggy, of course, wrote the song.
  His name, E. Poglan Bannett, was stamped all over the cover, and he drew
  unbelievable sums in the shape of royalties. Amongst the unbelievers was
  Ferdie.</p>

  <p>"I think it is a perfectly asinine song," said Ferdie. "Where the deuce do
  you expect to sleep?"</p>

  <p>Letty dropped her hand on her lap. She would, with the slightest
  encouragement, have dropped one on his ear.</p>

  <p>Picking up her fan, she walked across to the library table, which Mr.
  Revel insisted upon keeping in the drawing-room, and sat down. And they
  talked. And at the end of ten minutes...</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know," said Ferdie, choking, "that you've simply blighted
  my whole life!"</p>

  <p>Lettice Revel considered the matter, knit brows and pursed lips
  advertising her study.</p>

  <p>"Like the Spaniard?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>Ferdie had no acquaintance with vaudeville songs, being somewhat serious
  minded, but he did know that the Spanish were a romantic and melancholy
  people, and took the illustration in good part.</p>

  <p>"I daresay the Spaniard is blighted under similar circumstances, and, for
  the matter of that, the Czecho-Slovakian. And the Transylvanian. You've made
  an absolute mess of my existence, Letty. You've simply hashed me!"</p>

  <p>"Hash is Irish Stew, isn't it?"&mdash;really interested. "We had the
  funniest cookery mistress at school. We called her Doughnut Dora, because she
  simply specialized&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A man has a right to believe that, when a woman accepts a man's ring and
  says 'Certainly,' or whatever she says when the man says 'Will you, old

  man has principles and refuses to go to a party where you've invited a
  shocking little bounder, who simply makes a fearful ass of himself all the
  time, and thinks he's being funny because a lot of fearful asses laugh at his
  apish tricks&mdash;and as to his being a composer... he couldn't compose a
  rice pudding!&mdash;I say, if a man says, 'No, I won't go and I don't want
  you to have him,' if a man&mdash;well, dash it, Letty, can't you see...?"</p>

  <p>She ran her fingers through her hair&mdash;it was a mass of golden
  floss&mdash;and leant back, resigned.</p>

  <p>"Who is this man you're talking about&mdash;the fearful ass?"</p>

  <p>"Me, of course," he said indignantly. "No, not that one, that's Poggy. I
  mean I'm the man you're talking about&mdash;I'm talking about!"</p>

  <p>"0h!" said Letty quietly.</p>

  <p>The wonderful eyes she turned upon Ferdie were grave, every contour that
  made up expression showed how much she realized the exceeding seriousness of
  the situation. Her diamond engagement-ring lay on the table by her side (she
  happened to be sitting on the table), well within reach of the wretched young
  man, who blinked alternately from the ring to the girl.</p>

  <p>"No useful purpose can be served by prolonging an interview already too
  painful," she said primly. "We are experiencing the clash of
  ideals&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come down off the table if you want to be dignified," said the young man
  miserably. "And all that clashing of ideals stuff sounds like the
  introduction to a cinema drama of love and sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"Let us part without a scene," she said gently, and held out her hand. "I
  shall never forget you, Reggie."</p>

  <p>He writhed.</p>

  <p>"I won't even trouble to tell you that my name is Ferdinand. It would only
  make you more comic."</p>

  <p>The ring he gathered up with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"Don't you dare throw it in the fire!" she warned him as he lifted the
  trinket to the level of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It cost a hundred and twenty-five pounds," said the disconsolate young
  man. "They gave me a ten per cent discount because I knew the managing
  director. Am I likely to throw it away? I was looking to see if you'd damaged
  it. You've been very careful. Good-bye, Letty."</p>

  <p>Her speculative gaze held him.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to shoot lions?" she asked. He appealed to her mutely. "0r
  build a house in some fever-stricken swamp in Central Africa? Once I believed
  in you, Ferdie, and ordered black. Once I put an advertisement in the
  newspapers asking Central African newspapers to copy. And the same night I
  saw you in Chiro's, teaching Molly Fetinhough the new tango step. Ferdie, you
  are speaking to a woman who has suffered!"</p>

  <p>"I lost the boat," he said lamely.</p>

  <p>"Did you find it looking down that bony creature's back? You will not go
  away. Tomorrow night you will be here."</p>

  <p>She pointed to the exact spot on the carpet where he would grovel. Ferdie
  examined it curiously.</p>

  <p>Through the open window came the soft harmonies of church bells and the
  hushed music of a band playing carols. It was the Salvation Army band. Ferdie
  recognized the flat E of the cornet.</p>

  <p>"And is this Christmas Eve!" he said bitterly.</p>

  <p>"It is&mdash;the twenty-fourth," she said informatively. "Didn't you
  know?"</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow, when you're entertaining your beastly bounder friend, Poggy, or
  singing his 'Who Knows?' and splitting your sides over his fatuous, infantile
  jokes that he cuts from <i>Life</i> and keeps in a scrapbook&mdash;I've seen
  it," he added treacherously. "There isn't a boat for Asia Minor tonight, but
  perhaps you'll think of me in my lonely apartment drinking beer all
  alone&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"Surely you don't want assistance to drink beer!" she said coldly. "I've
  always understood that it wasn't strong enough to necessitate the calling in
  of help. Ferdie, I wish you a happy Christmas. There is no reason in the
  world why we shouldn't be good friends. I've realized for a long time that,
  temperamentally, we were unfitted for one another. A woman has the right to
  choose her friends."</p>

  <p>"A woman!" he scoffed. "And the year before last I was coaching you
  through the holidays for your school certificate! Who sat up half the night
  trying to knock the first idea of the integral calculus into your nut?"</p>

  <p>"The past is dead," she said, with dignity, and switched her fan.</p>

  <p>"Do that again," he said, fascinated.</p>

  <p>"Do what? The fan? It is an old trick I learnt years ago."</p>

  <p>"In the kindergarten? Go on, do it. That's cute. Ill bet Poggy taught you
  that. What a lady!"</p>

  <p>She was on her feet now, delicate trace of eyebrows arched. She might,
  with profit to her reputation as a well-bred lady, have maintained the pose.
  Instead of which:</p>

  <p>"Now, Ferdie, are you going? Or shall I call Arthurs to chuck you through
  the window?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie bowed. In the presence of vibrant maidenhood he was dumb&mdash;
  temporarily.</p>

  <p>"I only want to say&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>She walked to the fireplace and put her finger on the bell, and there was
  a look of sinister curiosity in her eyes. So might Caesar's wife, above
  suspicion and well out of reach, have looked when she saw her first Christian
  martyrs introduced to the lions.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ferdinand Stevington stepped out into Portland Place and turned up the
  collar of his overcoat. It was a rainy night, a warm westerly breeze was
  blowing&mdash;typical Christmas weather.</p>

  <p>Standing by the iron railings that separated the street from the cavernous
  area, he gazed, dim eyed, at the yellow blind which hid from his view all
  that had been desirable in life. He had an immeasurable sense of poverty, and
  his heart blazed resentfully against those who, rich in her respect and
  affection, refused him the crumbs which had so sparsely fallen from the feast
  her bounty provided.</p>

  <p>The watchful Nobbins brought the Rolls from the center of the road, where
  it had been parked, and guided it noiselessly and cunningly to the edge of
  the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, Nobbins; I will walk," said Ferdie quietly.</p>

  <p>"It's raining, sir."</p>

  <p>Nobbins invariably told him the news. Many a murder would have passed
  unscanned but for Nobbins.</p>

  <p>Ferdie glanced up at the copper-hued sky and laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't noticed it," he said.</p>

  <p>A raindrop fell straight into his eye and he cursed.</p>

  <p>"No, I will walk," he said.</p>

  <p>He was wearing the thinnest of shoes, and the pavement was wet and muddy.
  Wet feet had turned many a robust man into a wan and listless invalid about
  whose cot red-eyed women hung breathlessly, praying that the past could be
  wiped out and cruel words recalled. Ferdie walked in the gutter.</p>

  <p>The Salvation Army band at the corner of Duke Street was inviting
  Christians to awake. Most of the Christians in Duke Street had been awake for
  hours, and were only just beginning to take an interest in the overcrowded
  state of the dancing-floor. Those Christians who were asleep were in the
  smoke- rooms of respectable clubs, where only the head waiter or the house
  steward is allowed to waken members.</p>

  <p>And at this blessed time, when the servants' Christmas-box list is hanging
  in the hall and only three tables are laid in the dining-room, even head
  waiters hesitated to assist the carollers in their mission.</p>

  <p>Ferdie strode on, shrugged at the collecting-box that was pushed timidly
  toward him by a bonneted adjutant, repenting, to return and donate
  handsomely. And then there occurred in his brain one of those seismic
  disturbances that send tidal waves of brilliant inspiration across the
  commonplace surfaces of his mind.</p>

  <p>"Will you be good enough to take your band to No. 743 and play 'Where is
  my Wandering Boy Tonight?'" he asked.</p>

  <p>She consulted the man with the silver cornet&mdash;he of the flat
  E&mdash;and it was arranged.</p>

  <p>Ferdie went onward with a lighter heart. His flat in Devonshire Street
  seemed strangely lonely and empty. On the table lay a little package wrapped
  in thin silver paper and tied with blue ribbons, and at the sight of it, his
  spirits sank again. On the mantlepiece was a photograph of a girl. He averted
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Nobbins is here, sir."</p>

  <p>His valet made the announcement in his quiet way.</p>

  <p>"Here, is he? Let him go home to his wife and family, Stephen; it is
  Christmas-tide. Go home to your wife and family!"</p>

  <p>"I am not married, sir."</p>

  <p>Ferdie turned upon the man.</p>

  <p>"Have you a family?"</p>

  <p>Stephen, a man with a beautiful mind, whose dream it was that some day he
  would be appointed a lay reader or a court missionary, gazed at his master
  with eyes that in dumb suffering were like unto a wounded beast.</p>

  <p>"No, sir; it follows," he said gently.</p>

  <p>Ferdie hunched himself round in his chair.</p>

  <p>"What would you like to do tomorrow, Stephen?"</p>

  <p>Stephen coughed.</p>

  <p>"I should like to attend the morning service at the Foundling Hospital,
  sir," he said. "In the afternoon I and some friends are giving a little
  musical entertainment at the Marylebone Workhouse. I play a little."</p>

  <p>"The harp, one thinks!" said Ferdie.</p>

  <p>"No, sir: the saxophone," replied Stephen modestly. "It is somewhat
  difficult to play."</p>

  <p>"Go somewhere&mdash;and play it. Bring joy into suffering hearts,
  Stephen." He sat up quickly. "Can you play 'Where is my Wandering Boy
  Tonight'?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>Ferdie pointed to the door. Stephen bowed slightly and went out.</p>

  <p>Tomorrow was Christmas Day. He had rejected every invitation but one. And
  that one...</p>

  <p>...His maniacal laughter reached the butler's pantry, where Stephen and
  Nobbins were exchanging cigarette cards.</p>

  <p>"One can excuse much on Christmas Eve, Nobbins," said Stephen charitably.
  They were both members of a Brotherhood, but Stephen was the more brotherly.
  "You wouldn't like to drop in at the Marylebone Workhouse tomorrow
  afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"Am I drunk, too?" asked the chauffeur reproachfully.</p>

  <p>But Ferdie was not drunk. He was not even intoxicated. He was just broken-
  hearted and crushed and baffled. He wanted to do something that was
  exceedingly reckless, such as rescuing a child from a fire. The fire, for
  preference, to be in Portland Place, immediately opposite No. 743. He wanted
  to grow a beard and go away to sea before the mast. Or, if necessary, he was
  willing to give the mast a start. And then he wanted to come back bronzed and
  bearded, and be knocked down by a motor-car, preferably Letty's two-seater,
  and be picked up and carried into 743 Portland Place and hear Letty cry,
  "Why, it's Ferdie! What have I done?"</p>

  <p>He wanted to sink lower and lower in the social scale (without necessarily
  surrendering his large holdings in Conifers Corporation, which yielded a
  steady 8 per cent) until he was the inmate of a common lodging-house. He
  wanted Stephen also to sink lower and lower in the social scale until he was
  the inmate of a common lodging-house too. Stephen could sleep in the next
  cubicle and bring his tea in the morning.</p>

  <p>And by day he would sell things in the gutter, such as shoe-laces,
  matches, and pitiable little toys. And Letty would come along and buy
  something. Then, looking down at him, she would pale and say, "Ferdie! Have I
  brought you to this?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie rang the bell at this point.</p>

  <p>"Bring me a glass of milk," he said.</p>

  <p>"Hot or cold, sir?" asked Stephen.</p>

  <p>Ferdie shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I am indifferent," he said. He was in his most dangerous mood.</p>

  <p>Christmas! He remembered a story he had read, one of Dickens', or it may
  have been some other Johnny. After consideration he decided that it was
  Dickens. He had a wonderful memory for names. The story was about a
  curmudgeon of a fellow who hated Christmas. Sneered at the serried ranks of
  deceased turkeys that hung in the poulterer's shop, snarled at the rosy-faced
  apples, at the grocer's, loathed plum-pudding, and despised holly and
  mistletoe. Ferdie's heart warmed toward... Snoop, was it? Or Gooch, or
  Groodge... Scrooge! That was the chap's name. Scrooge! He remembered
  perfectly. His memory was uncanny where names were concerned.</p>

  <p>Ferdie hated Christmas too. He hated everything that was bright and
  cheery. He turned down the gas fire to make the atmosphere of the room attune
  with his sentiments. Stephen came in to say good-night.</p>

  <p>"And a merry Christmas to you, sir."</p>

  <p>"A merry Christmas!" said Ferdie through his nose. He had never snarled in
  his life; but Scrooge snarled.</p>

  <p>"Have you a cold, sir?"</p>

  <p>Stephen could be fatherly.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't! Christmas! Put out that fire! Have you locked up the bread
  and butter? Do it, Stephen, in case some of the poor break in. Your wages are
  reduced. I'll do without you next week. Did I promise you a Christmas-
  box?"</p>

  <p>"You are good enough, as a rule..."</p>

  <p>It hurt Ferdie to laugh through his nose; it was like champagne that went
  the wrong way. Nevertheless he laughed.</p>

  <p>Stephen went back to the Butler's pantry.</p>

  <p>"Nobbins," he asked earnestly, "will you join me in a short prayer for our
  master?"</p>

  <p>"If it is short," said Nobbins.</p>

  <p>It was toward twelve o'clock when Ferdie put out his hand and clawed
  toward him the little flat package in silver paper. He untied the blue
  ribbons thoughtfully, carefully removed and smoothed the paper, and pressed
  the spring which held together the two sides of a small jewel case. Gleaming
  and glittering in its blue velvet bed was a diamond and platinum pendant. It
  had cost a lot of money. Letty would have given him in exchange a
  cigarette-holder or a walking-stick or a manicure set. Poggy would get it
  now. He ground his teeth at the thought. And Letty would be disappointed and
  hurt. He must send it on and then go away. Whither, he knew not; to some
  obscure foreign town where nobody would dream of looking for him. But who
  would look for him! He asked the question of himself, and his lips curled.
  Stephen would miss him, but he would soon find a new master. The income- tax
  collector would miss him and write to his lawyer. Letty!... She would go,
  uncaring, through life, holding her slim sides and rocking with laughter,
  with Poggy twittering like an ape at her side and asking if she'd heard the
  story about the plumber and the Colonel's knee?</p>

  <p>Stephen came in with a knock.</p>

  <p>"What time would you like your tea in the morning, sir?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie bit his lip deliberately.</p>

  <p>"I may not want tea in the morning, Stephen. My plans are unsettled. At
  any moment I may have to go away. Don't look for me. Dewberry, Hokey,
  Middleton, Parker and Sutton will pay you your wages."</p>

  <p>"Would you like your letters forwarded, sir?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie sighed his impatience.</p>

  <p>"I may be dead," he said simply.</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. Good-night and a merry&mdash;good-night, sir."</p>

  <p>The fellow was impressed, Ferdie could see that. And other people would be
  impresesd. He looked up the first train to Bournemouth.</p>

  <p>But the package must go. A letter should be enclosed, just a brief,
  courteous, and yet not too courteous greeting. "Yours sincerely, Ferdinand
  Stevington." Or, " Wishing you the Christmas you deserve "? No, Ferdie could
  never wish her the least harm.</p>

  <p>"Dear Letty," he began, altered it to "My dear Letty," and began
  again.</p>

  <p>"My dear friend,&mdash;This trifle" (he originally wrote 'inexpensive
  trifle' but cut out the adjective) "comes to you with all my best
  wishes..."</p>

  <p>He ought to make her feel that all the blame was not hers. It was only
  fair.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I have been rather a bear. Forgive me!! I am going a long
  journey, and we may not meet again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused here to consider whether he ought to add "for a day or two," but
  decided to let it go without qualification. It was cruel to raise false
  hopes.</p>

  <p>"I have left your ring in an envelope. It will be found with other little
  intimate relics of a life that has not altogether been wasted. Who knows
  where I may sleep tonight?"</p>

  <p>This he blotted smugly, read every line, picturing her distress when she
  read it. Reluctantly he folded the note inside the silver paper, tied again
  the blue ribbons, and dropped the whole into a long envelope. At twelve
  forty-five he stole up to the door of 743 Portland Place, opened the flap of
  the letter- box and dropped the letter in; it was addressed, with rugged
  simplicity, "Letty, from F.S."</p>

  <p>On three points he was satisfied. It was a big, a magnanimous thing to
  have done. There was something innately fine in the act. The deed was worthy
  of the man. The three statements passed unchallenged. Ferdie knew that he had
  not judged himself unfairly. There was no sterner critic of his actions than
  himself. This he also admitted as an incontrovertible truth.</p>

  <p>And yet...?</p>

  <p>Ferdie wriggled in his chair and looked hard at the shoes he had taken
  off.</p>

  <p>And yet...?</p>

  <p>Had he not lowered himself in her eyes? Was it not an abject surrender on
  the part of one who was, and had been all the time, entirely in the right?
  Was it not a fulfilment of all her scornful predictions? He remembered the
  identical spot on the carpet where he must abase himself!</p>

  <p>Would it not have been better to send a Christmas card? There was one on
  his mantlepiece. It had come from his old nurse and was a picture of a blue
  cottage and white moon. The ground and roof were covered with Epsom salts
  that glittered in the light and was a fair representation of hoar-frost.</p>

  <p class="poem">"May Christmas cheer this day be yours,<br>
  Of sorrow may you ne'er have cause"&mdash;</p>

  <p>was appropriate&mdash;singularly so.</p>

  <p>This time he bit his upper lip, and when a man bites his upper lip he is
  in doubt. She would laugh at him. Poor fool! How quickly he had come to
  heel!</p>

  <p>Ferdie rose, kicked off his slippers so that when he did make up his mind,
  he could instantly dash into the kind of footwear that his decision called
  for. Whilst he was thinking, he might as well put on his street shoes.</p>

  <p>She would tell Poggy, of course...</p>

  <p>He took down the Christmas card, underlined the pious hope in the second
  line of the stanza, and, scribbling a line, "Merry Xmas, F.," put it into an
  envelope.</p>

  <p>There was a pair of ice tongs somewhere about&mdash;curved silver ice
  tongs, with handles like scissors. He had thought everything out.</p>

  <p>"I would have made a wonderful criminal," said Ferdie regretfully.</p>

  <p>With the tongs in his coat pocket, he drove in a taxi to Langham Place,
  dismissed the machine, and walked up Portland Place. A thin fog assisted the
  drizzle to make England what it is at Christmas-time. A new and livelier herd
  of carol players were jazzing "Good King Wenceslas" brightly. Ferdie found
  himself stepping unconsciously. And the clock struck two.</p>

  <p>No. 743 was in darkness when he stepped up to the door. In a second the
  ice tongs were in the letter-box and had gripped. He drew out a package of a
  familiar shape and dropped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?"</p>

  <p>In his agitation Ferdie released his ice tongs, and they fell with a
  clatter.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon?" he said, and added seasonably, "A merry
  Christmas!"</p>

  <p>"And a happy New Year!" said the big man who had come noiselessly behind
  him. "You're coming to Marylebone Lane with me."</p>

  <p>"If you imagine I'm going to take a country stroll at this hour and in
  this beastly weather, you're mistaken. Give me the lanes of England by all
  means&mdash;but on a summer day with the meadow-sweet and the may-weed and
  the dog- roses on the hedges..."</p>

  <p>"Are you coming quietly!"</p>

  <p>There was something very tremendous in the question. Ferdie reeled and
  gripped the railings, tight.</p>

  <p>"That sort of thing went out with the suffragettes," said the detective
  testily.</p>

  <p>"You're a policeman!"</p>

  <p>"Sergeant&mdash;M'Neill. Now come on, my lad, I've been watching you for
  an hour."</p>

  <p>He took Ferdie's arm unaffectionately, and they walked on.</p>

  <p>"Where's your pal. Lew?" asked the officer.</p>

  <p>"Loo&mdash;do you mean Waterloo?" Dazed but brave, Ferdie endeavored to be
  intelligent.</p>

  <p>At the station, a bright steel dock and a very stout and annoyed station
  sergeant who put down his pen and surveyed the prisoner with disfavor:</p>

  <p>"Name?"</p>

  <p>"My name... Smith."</p>

  <p>"Very original&mdash;John or William?"</p>

  <p>Ferdie thought.</p>

  <p>"Caractacus," he said.</p>

  <p>The sergeant at the desk lifted his upper lip cynically.</p>

  <p>"Address?"</p>

  <p>"Buckingham Palace, ha, ha!" said Ferdie dismally.</p>

  <p>Such jests had been made before.</p>

  <p>"Refuses address&mdash;yes, sergeant, what's the charge?"</p>

  <p>"Letter-box stealing. I found him extracting letters from 743 Portland
  Place with the aid of an instrument or tool."</p>

  <p>The instrument or tool was laid on the desk.</p>

  <p>"Did he get anything?"</p>

  <p>The detective laid a package on the table, and Ferdie scratched his chin.
  His little present had been in a long envelope. This was not in any kind of
  envelope. Moreover, it was tied with lavender ribbon.</p>

  <p>"'From Poggy to Lettice,'" read the detective.</p>

  <p>Ferdie staggered out of the pen, but the detective pushed him back.</p>

  <p>"A diamond and emerald ornament in the shape of a grand piano," announced
  the desk-officer.</p>

  <p>"What execrable taste, and may I add how singularly vulgar!" said
  Ferdie.</p>

  <p>"Have you anybody you wish to notify of your arrest? You will be in
  custody for three days," said the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"A word from a woman could save me," said Ferdie brokenly. "I am too proud
  to ask: we Smiths are not without our proper pride."</p>

  <p>A weary gaoler appeared; Ferdie was searched. A pocket-book containing a
  fabulous sum of money, a gold cigarette-case, divers articles of gold and
  silver.</p>

  <p>"You've had a good day, son," said the sergeant respectfully. "Put him in
  No. 6, Wilkins..."</p>

  <p>The cell door did not clang, Ferdie noticed; it "ooshed"!</p>

  <p>The Revels never opened their Christmas presents until the dinner-hour,
  when all kind donors were on hand to be thanked, enthusiastically,
  ecstatically, or just thanked. "You really ought not to have got such a
  beautiful handbag. It is just the thing I wanted! I'm getting so used to the
  other twelve."</p>

  <p>There was a master to the house, one George Palliter Revel, P.O., M.P. He
  paid for everything and approved of everything. Lettice Gionvanna Revel was
  another master. She merely gave orders, and said who might come to dinner and
  who might not. Everybody loved Lettice. People wrote poems about her, even
  people who could not write poetry. She had a speed-car, a bull-terrier, and a
  signed photograph of Douglas Fairbanks framed in gold. She liked men to be
  strong and manly and silent. Purposeful men who picked girls up in their arms
  and strode through the dim aisles of the primeval woods. Ferdie had never
  picked her up, except in a figurative sense. She loved him as a mother loves
  a helpless babe.</p>

  <p>She mentioned this fact at dinner, being entirely without reticence.</p>

  <p>"Ferdie isn't here, papa, because I told him not to come."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Revel mildly. "I thought that you and he...?"</p>

  <p>She smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"It was merely a boy-and-girl courtship," she said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Revel rubbed his left ear.</p>

  <p>"How old are you now, Letty?"</p>

  <p>"Nineteen and a bit," she said. "I'm a woman, daddy&mdash;you sometimes
  forget that. My love for Ferdie is purely maternal."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Revel, more mildly than ever.</p>

  <p>He was by nature mild, being one of those large-faced men with pannier
  cheeks and a bald and wrinkled forehead. He owed his eminence to his
  mildness, for, when his party was in power, he was so mild that the
  opposition thought he was sympathetic, and when they came in they offered him
  a seat in the Cabinet, only to discover that he was mildness itself to his
  former colleagues, and by them was confirmed in his office when they, in
  their turn, came back to power. To any Government, mild opposition is more
  acceptable than violent support.</p>

  <p>"Now for the presents!" said Mr. Revel.</p>

  <p>Poggy Bannett grew melancholy.</p>

  <p>"You quite understand why mine isn't here, Letty? The wretched burglar
  took it. I've been half the day at the police station, identifying the thing.
  They wouldn't let me bring it away."</p>

  <p>She smiled with her eyes. It is awfully difficult, but if you practise
  before a mirror for an hour a day it can be mastered.</p>

  <p>"It was too good of you, Poggy, my dear. I'd much rather have had a signed
  copy of your lovely song. Honestly, I dislike Christmas presents. They are so
  unreal&mdash;so... you know."</p>

  <p>Poggy nodded. He was a thin-faced young man with a sharp, out-thrust nose.
  Even amateur artists found him easy to draw.</p>

  <p>"And, of course, I don't expect anything from Ferdie. He wouldn't
  dare&mdash; "</p>

  <p>She looked at the envelope and frowned.</p>

  <p>"If he has returned the pipe I gave him last Christmas, I shall be very
  angry," she said. The envelope torn: "0h! How perfectly wonderful! Oh, but he
  shouldn't! Isn't that just like Ferdie, papa? He really has the most
  exquisite taste!"</p>

  <p>He looked at the little price ticket that Ferdie had left on, and rapidly
  calculated what 10 per cent, discount on £95 might be.</p>

  <p>The letter she read slowly, her lips moving.</p>

  <p>"Heavens!"</p>

  <p>Poggy saw her pale... She passed the letter to him without a word.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense!" said Poggy. "Twiff! Skittles! He's all right! You don't
  imagine...pooh! He's done it before!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes shone like twin stars.</p>

  <p>"If Ferdie says he will do a thing, he will do it," she said.</p>

  <p>"What is it, my dear!"</p>

  <p>When Mr. Revel asked a question, he signified his intention by fixing his
  pince-nez.</p>

  <p>"Ferdie may have committed suicide," breathed Lettice.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Revel, and took off his glasses. He had no further
  questions to ask. All day long he had had a feeling that it would be an
  interesting evening.</p>

  <p>"Stuff!" said Poggy hotly. "I like his nerve quoting my verses: 'Where
  will I sleep tonight?'&mdash;that's practically plagiarism."</p>

  <p>She drew a long, long breath that swelled her all up momentarily.</p>

  <p>"Where do you think he is?"</p>

  <p>The author of "Where Will I Sleep Tonight" smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you a story," he said. "A South American once asked an
  Irishman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you reserve your quotations from Life until a more appropriate
  occasion?"&mdash;icily. "I asked you what do you think he has done?"</p>

  <p>"You asked me where he was," responded the aggrieved composer. "He's in
  his own rooms; that's where he is&mdash;sulking and causing everybody
  trouble! I'll bet a thousand!"</p>

  <p>He got up from the table excitedly.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and bring him!" he said. "With my bare bands I will drag him from
  his hiding-place. He can't fool me. My friend Cruthers has a flat on the same
  floor. Wait for us!"</p>

  <p>He dashed from the room. Mr. Revel, who had dozed, looked up.</p>

  <p>"There will be an inquest, of course," he said, addressing the ceiling.
  "Happily I shall not be called."</p>

  <p>She looked at her progenitor, pain in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Father!" she said, and he winced at the word. "How can you! Ferdie isn't
  the kind of man who would allow you to be called."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cruthers, the good friend and former schoolmate of Poggy Bannett, was
  dressing for dinner when Poggy was announced. He was as a rule an early
  riser, and seldom missed his luncheon, but today, there being no racing and
  no daily newspapers and consequently no sin in the world, he had slept on
  until seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't seen Ferdie; his man told my man he was going away; in
  fact, he hasn't been visible since last night."</p>

  <p>"Skulking and sulking," said Poggy. "I've knocked at his door. No answer.
  Naturally! I'm going to get out of your window and walk along the fire
  parapet and have an independent investigation."</p>

  <p>"Do you mind waiting until I've changed my undies?" pleaded his friend.
  "It's so unpleasant with the window open."</p>

  <p>Poggy seated himself with folded arms.</p>

  <p>"I can wait," he said.</p>

  <p>Not until his friend was nearly dressed did he raise the sash and find his
  way along a narrow iron gang-way. Ferdie's bedroom window was open at the
  top; therefore it was openable at the bottom; <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>.
  He lifted the sash and stepped in.</p>

  <p>"Ferdie, my boy," he called, "the game's up. Come, come! Don't be
  naughty!"</p>

  <p>Silence answered him. He switched on the light. The bedroom was in order.
  The cupboards and wardrobes held no more than made life supportable to a
  gentleman of fashion.</p>

  <p>The dining-saloon had the tidiness of an empty room. Ferdie's slippers
  were before the fire. On the table was a stack of letters of a seasonable
  character. The spare bedroom, the study where Ferdie studied the sporting
  press, the bathroom, box-room, valet's room, pantry, and kitchen were
  empty.</p>

  <p>On the mantlepiece in the dining-room was the framed portrait of a woman,
  a woman of nineteen and a bit. Across the foot was written a message that was
  in no sense maternal. Poggy's brows met. They had not far to go. He felt that
  in a sense he had been deceived. A woman who signs herself " Yours for
  eternity, darling" wasn't being matronly at all. He seized the photograph
  viciously. This he would produce to her embarrassment or relief. At any rate
  it was hardly a fit possession for one who had outlived Letty Revel's
  eternity.</p>

  <p>The lights he extinguished, opened the window, and stepped out. Mr.
  Cruthers's light was also extinguished when he reached the window; the sash
  was fastened also. Mr. Cruthers had probably thought that Poggy would make
  his exit via Ferdie's front door. It seemed the simplest method.</p>

  <p>Poggy considered the matter for a moment. What was wrong with the fire
  escape? He went down the narrow iron staircase, dropped the last few feet
  into the yard, and then an interested spectator came from the shadows.</p>

  <p>"A merry Christmas!" said the stranger. "Coming a little walk along with
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" said Poggy. "I don't know you; and I don't want to know
  you. Good evening.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The stranger caught his arm.</p>

  <p>"My name is Sergeant M'Neill, C.I.D., and I shall take you into custody
  for breaking and entering."</p>

  <p>With rare presence of mind, Poggy took the photograph from his pocket and
  dropped it on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said the officer of the law, and picked it up. "Been
  collecting art treasures? I've watched you for two hours. Where's your friend
  Ike? I haven't seen him for years."</p>

  <p>At the station:</p>

  <p>"Smith," said Poggy, pale but inventive. The photograph episode was
  damning. And Sergeant M'Neill, who all morning had been pestering him to
  identify the diamond piano, had not recognized him, and the station sergeant
  of the morning was away on leave.</p>

  <p>"John or William?"</p>

  <p>"Haydn," said Poggy musically.</p>

  <p>The gaoler went over him and enumerated his finds. Then, in a state of
  exaltation, Poggy said:</p>

  <p>"I think it is only fair that you should know that my name is Bannett, and
  I am the composer and author of `'Where Shall I Sleep Tonight?'..."</p>

  <p>"The answer is, No. 6!" said the station sergeant.</p>

  <p>Ferdie heard the key turn and the cell door swing open. He sat up,
  interested, and Poggy recoiled at the sight of him.</p>

  <p>"Ferdie!... You here!"</p>

  <p>Ferdie was not surprised.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and make me laugh," he said. "What are you in
  for&mdash;murder?"</p>

  <p>"This is the second case today," said the magistrate awfully, "where a
  prosecutor who should have come forward and identified stolen property has
  failed to realize his responsibilities to the public. The cases have been
  remanded for a fortnight, yet neither Mr. Stevington nor Mr. Bannett have
  appeared to aid the police. I have sent the other man to prison for a month
  as a suspected person; you also will go to prison with hard labor for a
  month, and I warn you..."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A month later they left Pentonville Model Prison together. Ferdie bagged
  the only taxi in sight, and when Poggy reached Portland Place, Letty was
  engaged. He waited an hour. She was still engaged. The footman thought she
  would be engaged for some time.</p>

  <p>Her head of gold floss was on Ferdie's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Go on!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Two nights later I arrived in Constantinople, despair in my heart. I knew
  I had lost you; there was nothing to live for. Should I dash madly into the
  desert, perhaps never to return!"</p>

  <p>"If you had only cabled!" she breathed. "When Poggy didn't return I knew
  that he dared not face me. Oh, my dearest darling, I didn't dream that you
  would take such awful risks. You will never run away again! I can't bear it!
  Where have you come from now!"</p>

  <p>"Penton Villia&mdash;a suburb of Rome," said Ferdie. "As I was saying, I
  might have joined the dervishes..."</p>

  <p>"Do you think it is any use my waiting!" asked Poggy.</p>

  <p>The footman, an honest man, shook his head. The back of the drawing-room
  settee was exactly opposite the keyhole.</p>
