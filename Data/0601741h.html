<p class="note">"The Fire of Asshurbanipal" was originally
written early in the 1930's as a straight adventure story. Howard
later revised it, giving it a supernatural ending. After Howard's
death his father submitted this version to <i>Weird Tales</i>,
which published it in December, 1936.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

<p class="first">YAR ALI squinted carefully down the blue barrel
of his Lee-Enfield, called devoutly on Allah and sent a bullet
through the brain of a flying rider.</p>

<p><i>"Allaho akbar!"</i></p>

<p>The big Afghan shouted in glee, waving his weapon above his
head, "God is great! By Allah, <i>sahib</i>, I have sent another
one of the dogs to Hell!"</p>

<p>His companion peered cautiously over the rim of the sand-pit
they had scooped with their hands. He was a lean and wiry
American, Steve Clarney by name.</p>

<p>"Good work, old horse," said this person. "Four left.
Look&mdash;they're drawing off."</p>

<p>The white-robed horsemen were indeed reining away, clustering
together just out of accurate rifle-range, as if in council.
There had been seven when they had first swooped down on the
comrades, but the fire from the two rifles in the sand-pit had
been deadly.</p>

<p>"Look, <i>sahib</i>&mdash;they abandon the fray!"</p>

<p>Yar Ali stood up boldly and shouted taunts at the departing
riders, one of whom whirled and sent a bullet that kicked up sand
thirty feet in front of the pit.</p>

<p>"They shoot like the sons of dogs," said Yar Ali in complacent
self-esteem. "By Allah, did you see that rogue plunge from his
saddle as my lead went home? Up, <i>sahib</i>; let us run after them and
cut them down!"</p>

<p>Paying no attention to this outrageous proposal&mdash;for he
knew it was but one of the gestures Afghan nature continually
demands&mdash;Steve rose, dusted off his breeches and gazing
after the riders, now white specks far out on the desert, said
musingly: "Those fellows ride as if they had some set purpose in
mind&mdash;not a bit like men running from a licking."</p>

<p>"Aye," agreed Yar Ali promptly and seeing nothing inconsistent
with his present attitude and recent bloodthirsty suggestion,
"they ride after more of their kind&mdash;they are hawks who give
up their prey not quickly. We had best move our position quickly,
Steve <i>sahib</i>. They will come back&mdash;maybe in a few hours,
maybe in a few days&mdash;it all depends on how far away lies the
oasis of their tribe. But they will be back. We have guns and
lives&mdash;they want both. And behold."</p>

<p>The Afghan levered out the empty shell and slipped a single
cartridge into the breech of his rifle.</p>

<p>"My last bullet, <i>sahib</i>."</p>

<p>Steve nodded. "I've got three left."</p>

<p>The raiders whom their bullets had knocked from the saddle had
been looted by their own comrades. No use searching the bodies
which lay in the sand for ammunition. Steve lifted his canteen
and shook it. Not much water remained. He knew that Yar Ali had
only a little more than he, though the big Afridi, bred in a
barren land, had used and needed less water than did the
American; although the latter, judged from a white man's
standards, was hard and tough as a wolf. As Steve unscrewed the
canteen cap and drank very sparingly, he mentally reviewed the
chain of events that had led them to their present position.</p>

<p>Wanderers, soldiers of fortune, thrown together by chance and
attracted to each other by mutual admiration, he and Yar Ali had
wandered from India up through Turkistan and down through Persia,
an oddly assorted but highly capable pair. Driven by the restless
urge of inherent wanderlust, their avowed purpose&mdash;which
they swore to and sometimes believed themselves&mdash;was the
accumulation of some vague and undiscovered treasure, some pot of
gold at the foot of some yet unborn rainbow.</p>

<p>Then in ancient Shiraz they had heard of the Fire of
Asshurbanipal. From the lips of an ancient Persian trader, who
only half believed what he repeated to them, they heard the tale
that he in turn had heard from the babbling lips of delirium, in
his distant youth. He had been a member of a caravan, fifty years
before, which, wandering far on the southern shore of the Persian
Gulf trading for pearls, had followed the tale of a rare pearl
far into the desert.</p>

<p>The pearl, rumored found by a diver and stolen by a shaykh of
the interior, they did not find, but they did pick up a Turk who
was dying of starvation, thirst and a bullet wound in the thigh.
As, he died in delirium, he babbled a wild tale of a silent dead
city of black stone set in the drifting sands of the desert far
to the westward, and of a flaming gem clutched in the bony
fingers of a skeleton on an ancient throne.</p>

<p>He had not dared bring it away with him, because of an
overpowering brooding horror that haunted the place, and thirst
had driven him into the desert again, where Bedouins had pursued
and wounded him. Yet he had escaped, riding hard until his horse
fell under him. He died without telling how he had reached the
mythical city in the first place, but the old trader thought he
must have come from the northwest&mdash;a deserter from the
Turkish army, making a desperate attempt to reach the Gulf.</p>

<p>The men of the caravan had made no attempt to plunge still
further into the desert in search of the city; for, said the old
trader, they believed it to be the ancient, ancient City of Evil
spoken of in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Alhazred&mdash;the
city of the dead on which an ancient curse rested. Legends named
it vaguely: the Arabs called it <i>Beled-el-Djinn</i>, the City
of Devils, and the Turks, <i>Kara-Shehr</i>, the Black City. And
the gem was that ancient and accursed jewel belonging to a king
of long ago, whom the Grecians called Sardanapalus and the
Semitic peoples Asshurbanipal.</p>

<p>Steve had been fascinated by the tale. Admitting to himself
that it was doubtless one of the ten thousand cock-and-bull myths
booted about the East, still there was a possibility that he and
Yar Ali had stumbled onto a trace of that pot, of rainbow gold
for which they searched. And Yar Ali had heard hints before of a
silent city of the sands; tales had followed the eastbound
caravans over the high Persian uplands and across the sands of
Turkistan, into the mountain country and beyond&mdash;vague
tales; whispers of a black city of the djinn, deep in the hazes
of a haunted desert.</p>

<p>So, following the trail of the legend, the companions had come
from Shiraz to a village on the Arabian shore of the Persian
Gulf, and there had heard more from an old man who had been a
pearl-driver in his youth. The loquacity of age was on him and he
told tales repeated to him by wandering tribesmen who had them in
turn from the wild nomads of the deep interior; and again Steve
and Yar Ali heard of the still black city with giant beasts carved
of stone, and the skeleton sultan who held the blazing gem.</p>

<p>And so, mentally swearing at himself for a fool, Steve had
made the plunge, and Yar Ali, secure in the knowledge that all
things lay on the lap of Allah, had come with him. Their scanty
supply of money had been just sufficient to provide riding-camels
and provisions for a bold flying invasion of the unknown. Their
only chart had been the vague rumors that placed the supposed
location of Kara-Shehr.</p>

<p>There had been days of hard travel, pushing the beasts and
conserving water and food. Then, deep in the desert they invaded,
they had encountered a blinding sand-wind in which they had lost
the camels. After that came long miles of staggering through the
sands, battered by a flaming sun, subsisting on rapidly dwindling
water from their canteens, and food Yar Ali had in a pouch. No
thought of finding the mythical city now. They pushed on blindly,
in hope of stumbling upon a spring; they knew that behind them no
oases lay within a distance they could hope to cover on foot. It
was a desperate chance, but their only one.</p>

<p>Then white-clad hawks had swooped down on them, out of the
haze of the skyline, and from a shallow and hastily scooped
trench the adventurers had exchanged shots with the wild riders
who circled them at top speed. The bullets of the Bedouins had
skipped through their makeshift fortifications, knocking dust
into their eyes and flicking bits of cloth from their garments,
but by good chance neither had been hit.</p>

<p>Their one bit of luck, reflected Clarney, as he cursed himself
for a fool. What a mad venture it had been, anyway! To think that
two men could so dare the desert and live, much less wrest from
its abysmal bosom the secrets of the ages! And that crazy tale of
a skeleton hand gripping a flaming jewel in a dead city&mdash;bosh!
What utter rot! He must have been crazy himself to credit it, the
American decided with the clarity of view that suffering and
danger bring.</p>

<p>"Well, old horse," said Steve, lifting his rifle, "let's get
going. It's a toss-up if we die of thirst or get sniped off by
the desert-brothers. Anyway, we're doin' no good here."</p>

<p>"God gives," agreed Yar Ali cheerfully. "The sun sinks
westward. Soon the coolness of night will be upon us. Perhaps we
shall find water yet, <i>sahib</i>. Look, the terrain changes to the
south."</p>

<p>Clarney shaded his eyes against the dying sun. Beyond a level,
barren expanse of several miles width, the land did indeed become
more broken; aborted hills were in evidence. The American slung
his rifle over his arm and sighed.</p>

<p>"Heave ahead; we're food for the buzzards anyhow."</p>

<p>The sun sank and the moon rose, flooding the desert with weird
silver light. Drifted sand glimmered in long ripples, as if a sea
had suddenly been frozen into immobility. Steve, parched fiercely
by a thirst he dared not fully quench, cursed beneath his breath.
The desert was beautiful beneath the moon, with the beauty of a
cold marble lorelei to lure men to destruction. What a mad quest!
his weary brain reiterated; the Fire of Asshurbanipal retreated
into the mazes of unreality with each dragging step. The desert
became not merely a material wasteland, but the gray mists of the
lost eons, in whose depths dreamed sunken things.</p>

<p>Clarney stumbled and swore; was he failing already? Yar Ali
swung along with the easy, tireless stride of the mountain man,
and Steve set his teeth, nerving himself to greater effort. They
were entering the broken country at last, and the going became
harder. Shallow gullies and narrow ravines knifed the earth with
wavering patterns. Most of them were nearly filled with sand, and
there was no trace of water.</p>

<p>"This country was once oasis country," commented Yar Ali.
"Allah knows how many centuries ago the sand took it, as the sand
has taken so many cities in Turkistan."</p>

<p>They swung on like dead men in a gray land of death.
The moon grew red and sinister as she sank, and shadowy
darkness settled over the desert before they had reached a point
where they could see what lay beyond the broken belt. Even the
big Afghan's feet began to drag, and Steve kept himself erect
only by a savage effort of will. At last they toiled up a sort of
ridge, on the southern side of which the land sloped
downward.</p>

<p>"We rest," declared Steve. "There's no water in this hellish
country. No use in goin' on for ever. My legs are stiff as gun-
barrels. I couldn't take another step to save my neck. Here's a
kind of stunted cliff, about as high as a man's shoulder, facing
south. We'll sleep in the lee of it."</p>

<p>"And shall we not keep watch, Steve <i>sahib</i>?"</p>

<p>"We don't," answered Steve. "If the Arabs cut our throats
while we're asleep, so much the better. We're goners anyhow."</p>

<p>With which optimistic observation Clarney lay down stiffly in
the deep sand. But Yar Ali stood, leaning forward, straining his
eyes into the elusive darkness that turned the star-flecked
horizons to murky wells of shadow.</p>

<p>"Something lies on the skyline to the south," he muttered
uneasily. "A hill? I cannot tell, or even be sure that I see
anything at all."</p>

<p>"You're seeing mirages already," said Steve irritably. "Lie
down and sleep."</p>

<p>And so saying Steve slumbered.</p>

<p>The sun in his eyes awoke him. He sat up, yawning, and his
first sensation was that of thirst. He lifted his canteen and wet
his lips. One drink left. Yar Ali still slept. Steve's eyes
wandered over the southern horizon and he started. He kicked the
recumbent Afghan.</p>

<p>"Hey, wake up, Ali. I reckon you weren't seeing things after
all. There's your hill&mdash;and a queer-lookin' one, too."</p>

<p>The Afridi woke as a wild thing wakes, instantly and
completely, his hand leaping to his long knife as he glared about
for enemies. His gaze followed Steve's pointing fingers and his
eves widened.</p>

<p>"By Allah and by Allah!" he swore. "We have come into a land
of djinn! That is no hill&mdash;it is a city of stone in the
midst of the sands!"</p>

<p>Steve bounded to his feet like a steel spring released. As he
gazed with bated breath, a fierce shout escaped his lips. At his
feet the slope of the ridge ran down into a wide and level
expanse of sand that stretched away southward. And far away,
across those sands, to his straining sight the 'hill' slowly took
shape, like a mirage growing from the drifting sands.</p>

<p>He saw great uneven walls, massive battlements; all about
crawled the sands like a living, sensate thing, drifted high
about the walls, softening the rugged outlines. No wonder that at
first glance the whole had appeared like a hill.</p>

<p>"Kara-Shehr!" Clarney exclaimed fiercely. "Beled-el-Djinn! The
city of the dead! It wasn't a pipe-dream after all! We've found
it&mdash;by Heaven, we've found it! Come on! Let's go!"</p>

<p>Yar Ali shook his head uncertainly and muttered something
about evil djinn under his breath, but he followed. The sight of
the ruins had swept from Steve his thirst and hunger, and the
fatigue that a few hours' sleep had not fully overcome. He
trudged on swiftly, oblivious to the rising heat, his eyes
gleaming with the lust of the explorer. It was not altogether
greed for the fabled gem that had prompted Steve Clarney to risk
his life in that grim wilderness; deep in his soul lurked the
age-old heritage of the white man, the urge to seek out the
hidden places of the world, and that urge had been stirred to the
depths by the ancient tales.</p>

<p>Now as they crossed the level wastes that separated the broken
land from the city, they saw&mdash;the shattered walls take
clearer form and shape, as if they grew out of the morning sky.
The city seemed built of huge blocks of black stone, but how high
the walls had been there was no telling because of the sand that
drifted high about their base; in many places they had fallen
away and the sand hid the fragments entirely.</p>

<p>The sun reached her zenith and thirst intruded itself in spite
of zeal and enthusiasm, but Steve fiercely mastered his
suffering. His lips were parched and swollen, but he would not
take that last drink until he had reached the ruined city. Yar
Ali wet his lips from his own canteen and tried to share the
remainder with his friend. Steve shook his head and plodded
on.</p>

<p>In the ferocious heat of the desert afternoon they reached the
ruin, and passing through a wide breach in the crumbling wall,
gazed on the dead city. Sand choked the ancient streets and lent
fantastic form to huge, fallen and half-hidden columns. So
crumbled into decay and so covered with sand was the whole that
the explorers could make out little of the original plan of the
city; now it was but a waste of drifted sand and crumbling stone
over which brooded, like an invisible cloud, an aura of
unspeakable antiquity.</p>

<p>But directly in front of them ran a broad avenue, the outline
of which not even the ravaging sands and winds of time had been
able to efface. On either side of the wide way were ranged huge
columns, not unusually tall, even allowing for the sand that hid
their bases, but incredibly massive. On the top of each column
stood a figure carved from solid stone&mdash;great, somber
images, half human, half bestial, partaking of the brooding
brutishness of the whole city. Steve cried out in amazement.</p>

<p>"The winged bulls of Nineveh. The bulls with men's heads! By
the saints, Ali, the old tales are true! The Assyrians did build
this city! The whole tale's true! They must have come here when
the Babylonians destroyed Assyria&mdash;why, this scene's a dead
ringer for pictures I've seen&mdash;reconstructed scenes of old
Nineveh! And look!"</p>

<p>He pointed down the broad street to the great building which
reared at the other end, a colossal, brooding edifice whose
columns and walls of solid black stone blocks defied the winds
and sands of time. The drifting, obliterating sea washed about
its foundations, overflowing into its doorways, but it would
require a thousand years to inundate the whole structure.</p>

<p>"An abode of devils!" muttered Yar Ali, uneasily.</p>

<p>"The temple of Baal!" exclaimed Steve. "Come on!&mdash;I was
afraid we'd find all the palaces and temples hidden by the sand
and have to dig for the gem."</p>

<p>"Little good it will do us," muttered Yar Ali. "Here we
die."</p>

<p>"I reckon so." Steve unscrewed the cap of his canteen. "Let's
take our last drink. Anyway, we're safe from the Arabs. They'd
never dare come here, with their superstitions. We'll drink and
then we'll die, I reckon, but first we'll find the jewel. When I
pass out, I want to have it in my hand. Maybe a few centuries
later some lucky son-of-a-gun will find our skeletons&mdash;and
the gem. Here's to him, whoever he is!"</p>

<p>With which grim jest Clarney drained his canteen and Yar Ali
followed suit. They had played their last ace; the rest lay on
the lap of Allah.</p>

<p>They strode up the broad way, and Yar Ali, utterly fearless in
the face of human foci, glanced nervously to right and left, half
expecting to see a horned and fantastic face leering at him from
behind a column. Steve himself felt the somber antiquity of the
place, and almost found himself fearing a rush of bronze war
chariots down the forgotten streets, or to hear the sudden
menacing flare of bronze trumpets. The silence in dead cities
was so much more intense, he reflected, than that on the open
desert.</p>

<p>They came to the portals of the great temple. Rows of immense
columns flanked the wide doorway, which was ankle-deep in sand,
and from which sagged massive bronze frameworks that had once
braced mighty doors, whose polished woodwork had rotted away
centuries ago. They passed into a mighty hall of misty twilight
whose shadowy stone roof was upheld by columns like the trunks of
forest trees. The whole effect of the architecture was one of
awesome magnitude and sullen, breathtaking splendor, like a
temple built by somber giants for the abode of dark gods.</p>

<p>Yar Ali walked fearfully, as if he expected to awake sleeping
gods, and Steve, without the Afridi's superstitions, yet felt the
gloomy majesty of the place lay somber hands on his soul.</p>

<p>No trace of a footprint showed in the deep dust on the floor;
half a century had passed since the affrighted and devil-ridden
Turk had fled these silent halls. As for the Bedouins, it was
easy to see why those superstitious sons of the desert shunned
this haunted city&mdash;and haunted it was, not by actual ghosts,
perhaps, but by the shadows of lost splendors.</p>

<p>As they trod the sands of the hall, which seemed endless,
Steve pondered many questions: How did these fugitives from the
wrath of frenzied rebels build this city? How did they pass
through the country of their foes&mdash;for Babylonia lay between
Assyria and the Arabian desert. Yet there had been no other place
for them to go; westward lay Syria and the sea, and north and
east swarmed the 'dangerous Medes', those fierce Aryans whose aid
had stiffened the arm of Babylon to smite her foe to the
dust.</p>

<p>Possibly, thought Steve, Kara-Shehr&mdash;whatever its name
had been in those dim days&mdash;had been built as an outpost
border city before the fall of the Assyrian empire, whither
survivals of that overthrow fled. At any rate it was possible
that Kara-Shehr had outlasted Nineveh by some centuries&mdash;a
strange, hermit city, no doubt, cut off from the rest of the
world.</p>

<p>Surely, as Yar Ali had said, this was once fertile country,
watered by oases; and doubtless in the broken country they had
passed over the night before, there had been quarries that
furnished the stone for the building of the city.</p>

<p>Then what caused its downfall? Did the encroachment of the
sands and the filling up of the springs cause the people to
abandon it, or was Kara-Shehr a city of silence before the sands
crept over the walls? Did the downfall come from within or
without? Did civil war blot out the inhabitants, or were they
slaughtered by some powerful foe from the desert? Clarney shook
his head in baffled chagrin. The answers to those questions were
lost in the maze of forgotten ages.</p>

<p><i>"Allaho akbar!"</i> They had traversed the great shadowy
hall and at its further end they came upon a hideous black stone
altar, behind which loomed an ancient god, bestial and horrific.
Steve shrugged his shoulders as he recognized the monstrous
aspect of the image&mdash;aye, that was Baal, on which black
altar in other ages many a screaming, writhing, naked victim had
offered up its naked soul. The idol embodied in its utter,
abysmal and sullen bestiality the whole soul of this demoniac
city. Surely, thought Steve, the builders of Nineveh and Kara-
Shehr were cast in another mold from the people of today. Their
art and culture were too ponderous, too grimly barren of the
lighter aspects of humanity, to be wholly human, as modern man
understands humanity. Their architecture was repellent; of high
skill, yet so massive, sullen and brutish in effect as to be
almost beyond the comprehension of moderns.</p>

<p>The adventurers passed through a narrow door which opened in
the end of the hall close to the idol, and came into a series of
wide, dim, dusty chambers connected by column-flanked corridors.
Along these they strode in the gray ghostly light, and came at
last to a wide stair, whose massive stone steps led upward and
vanished in the gloom. Here Yar Ali halted.</p>

<p>"We have dared much, <i>sahib</i>," he muttered. "Is it wise to dare
more?"</p>

<p>Steve, aquiver with eagerness, yet understood the Afghan's
mind. "You mean we shouldn't go up those stairs?"</p>

<p>"They have an evil look. To what chambers of silence and
horror may they lead? When djinn haunt deserted buildings, they
lurk in the upper chambers. At any moment a demon may bite off
our heads."</p>

<p>"We're dead men anyhow," grunted Steve. "But I tell
you&mdash;you go on back through the hall and watch for the Arabs
while I go upstairs."</p>

<p>"Watch for a wind on the horizon," responded the Afghan
gloomily, shifting his rifle and loosening his long knife in its
scabbard. "No Bedouin comes here. Lead on, <i>sahib</i>. Thou'rt mad
after the manner of all Franks,&mdash;but I would not leave thee
to face the djinn alone."</p>

<p>So the companions mounted the massive stairs, their feet
sinking deep into the accumulated dust of centuries at each step.
Up and up they went, to an incredible height until the depths
below merged into a vague gloom.</p>

<p>"We walk blind to our doom, <i>sahib</i>," muttered Yar Ali.
"<i>Allah il allah</i>&mdash;and Muhammad is his Prophet!
Nevertheless, I feel the presence of slumbering Evil and never
again shall I hear the wind blowing up the Khyber Pass."</p>

<p>Steve made no reply. He did not like the breathless silence
that brooded over the ancient temple, nor the grisly gray light
that filtered from some hidden source.</p>

<p>Now above them the gloom lightened somewhat and they emerged
into a vast circular chamber, grayly illumined by light that
filtered in through the high, pierced ceiling. But another
radiance lent itself to the illumination. A cry burst from
Steve's lips, echoed by Yar Ali.</p>

<p>Standing on the top step of the broad stone stair, they looked
directly across the broad chamber, with its dustcovered heavy
tile floor and bare black stone walls. From about the center of
the chamber, massive steps led up to a stone dais, and on this
dais stood a marble throne. About this throne glowed and
shimmered an uncanny light, and the awestruck adventurers gasped
as they saw its source. On the throne slumped a human skeleton,
an almost shapeless mass of moldering bones. A fleshless hand
sagged outstretched upon the broad marble throne-arm, and in its
grisly clasp there pulsed and throbbed like a living thing, a
great crimson stone.</p>

<p>The Fire of Asshurbanipal! Even after they had found the lost
city Steve had not really allowed himself to believe that they
would find the gem, or that it even existed in reality. Yet he
could not doubt the evidence of his eyes, dazzled by that evil,
incredible glow. With a fierce shout he sprang across the chamber
and up the steps. Yar Ali was at his heels, but when Steve would
have seized the gem, the Afghan laid a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Wait!" exclaimed the big Muhammadan. "Touch it not yet,
<i>sahib</i>! A curse lies on ancient things&mdash;and surely this is a
thing triply accursed! Else why has it lain here untouched in a
country of thieves for so many centuries? It is not well to
disturb the possessions of the dead."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" snorted the American. "Superstitions! The Bedouins
were scared by the tales that have come down to 'em from their
ancestors. Being desert-dwellers they mistrust cities anyway, and
no doubt this one had an evil reputation in its lifetime. And
nobody except Bedouins have seen this place before, except that
Turk, who was probably half demented with suffering.</p>

<p>"These bones may be those of the king mentioned in the
legend&mdash;the dry desert air preserves such things
indefinitely&mdash;but I doubt it. May be Assyrian&mdash;most likely
Arab&mdash;some beggar that got the gem and then died on that
throne for some reason or other."</p>

<p>The Afghan scarcely heard him. He was gazing in fearful
fascination at the great stone, as a hypnotized bird stares into
a serpent's eye.</p>

<p>"Look at it, <i>sahib</i>!" he whispered. "What is it? No such gem as
this was ever cut by mortal hands! Look how it throbs and pulses
like the heart of a cobra!"</p>

<p>Steve was looking, and he was aware of a strange undefined
feeling of uneasiness. Well versed in the knowledge of precious
stones, he had never seen a stone like this. At first glance he
had supposed it to be a monster ruby, as told in the legends. Now
he was not sure, and he had a nervous feeling that Yar Ali was
right, that this was no natural, normal gem: He could not
classify the style in which it was cut, and such was the power of
its lurid radiance that he found it difficult to gaze at it
closely for any length of time. The whole setting was not one
calculated to soothe restless nerves. The deep dust on the floor
suggested an unwholesome antiquity; the gray light evoked a sense
of unreality, and the heavy black walls towered grimly, hinting
at hidden things.</p>

<p>"Let's take the stone, and go!" muttered Steve, an
unaccustomed panicky dread rising in his bosom.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Yar Ali's eyes were blazing, and he gazed, not at the
gem, but at the sullen stone walls. "We are flies in the lair of
the spider! Sahib, as Allah lives, it is more than the ghosts of
old fears that lurk over this city of horror! I feel the presence
of peril, as I have felt it before&mdash;as I felt it in a jungle
cavern where a python lurked unseen in the darkness
&mdash;as I felt it in the temple of Thuggee where the hidden
stranglers of Siva crouched to spring upon us&mdash;as I feel it
now, tenfold!"</p>

<p>Steve's hair prickled. He knew that Yar Ali was a grim
veteran, not to be stampeded by silly fear or senseless panic; he
well remembered the incidents referred to by the Afghan, as he
remembered other occasions upon which Yar Ali's Oriental
telepathic instinct had warned him of danger before that danger
was seen or heard.</p>

<p>"What is it, Yar Ali?" he whispered.</p>

<p>The Afghan shook his head, his eyes filled with a weird
mysterious light as he listened to the dim occult promptings of
his subconsciousness.</p>

<p>"I know not; I know it is close to us, and that it is very
ancient and very evil. I think&mdash;" Suddenly he halted and
wheeled, the eery light vanishing from his eyes to be replaced by
a glare of wolf-like fear and suspicion.</p>

<p>"Hark, <i>sahib</i>!" he snapped. "Ghosts or dead men mount the
stair!"</p>

<p>Steve stiffened as the stealthy pad of soft sandals on stone
reached his ear.</p>

<p>"By Judas, Ali!" he rapped; "something's out there&mdash;"</p>

<p>The ancient walls re-echoed to a chorus of wild yells as a
horde of savage figures flooded the chamber. For one dazed insane
instant Steve believed wildly that they were being attacked by
re-embodied warriors of a vanished age; then the spiteful crack
of a bullet past his ear and the acrid smell of powder told him
that their foes were material enough. Clarney cursed; in their
fancied security&mdash;they had been caught like rats in a trap
by the pursuing Arabs.</p>

<p>Even as the American threw up his rifle, Yar Ali fired point-
blank from the hip with deadly effect, hurled his empty rifle
into the horde and went down the steps like a hurricane, his
three-foot Khyber knife shimmering in his hairy hand. Into his
gusto for battle went real relief that his foes were human. A
bullet ripped the turban from his head, but an Arab went down
with a split skull beneath the hillman's first, shearing
stroke.</p>

<p>A tall Bedouin clapped his gun-muzzle to the Afghan's side,
but before he could pull the trigger, Clarney's bullet scattered
his brains. The very number of the attackers hindered their
onslaught on the big Afridi, whose tigerish quickness made
shooting as dangerous to themselves as to him. The bulk of them
swarmed about him, striking with scimitar and rifle-stock while
others charged up the steps after Steve. At that range there was
no missing; the American simply thrust his rifle muzzle into a
bearded face and blasted it into a ghastly ruin. The others came
on, screaming like panthers.</p>

<p>And now as he prepared to expend his last cartridge, Clarney
saw two things in one flashing instant&mdash;a wild warrior who,
with froth on his beard and a heavy scimitar uplifted, was almost
upon him, and another who knelt on the floor drawing a careful
bead on the plunging Yar Ali. Steve made an instant choice and
fired over the shoulder of the charging swordsman, killing the
rifleman&mdash;and voluntarily offering his own life for his
friend's; for the scimitar was swinging at his own head. But even
as the Arab swung, grunting with the force of the blow, his
sandaled foot slipped on the marble steps and the curved blade,
veering erratically from its arc, clashed on Steve's rifle-
barrel. In an instant the American clubbed his rifle, and as the
Bedouin recovered his balance and again heaved up the scimitar,
Clarney struck with all his rangy power, and stock and skull
shattered together.</p>

<p>Then a heavy ball smacked into his shoulder, sickening him
with the shock.</p>

<p>As he staggered dizzily, a Bedouin whipped a turban-cloth about
his feet and jerked viciously. Clarney pitched headlong down the
steps, to strike with stunning force. A gun-stock in a brown hand
went up to dash out his brains, but an imperious command halted
the blow.</p>

<p>"Slay him not, but bind him hand and foot."</p>

<p>As Steve struggled dazedly against many gripping hands, it
seemed to him that somewhere he had heard that imperious voice
before.</p>

<p>The American's downfall had occurred in a matter of seconds.
Even as Steve's second shot had cracked, Yar Ali had half severed
a raider's arm and himself received a numbing blow from a rifle-
stock on his left shoulder. His sheepskin coat, worn despite the
desert heat, saved his hide from half a dozen slashing knives. A
rifle was discharged so close to his face that the powder burnt
him fiercely, bringing a bloodthirsty yell from the maddened
Afghan. As Yar Ali swung up his dripping blade the rifleman,
ashy-faced, lifted his rifle above his head in both hands to
parry the downward blow, whereat the Afridi, with a yelp of
ferocious exultation, shifted as a jungle cat strikes and plunged
his long knife into the Arab's belly. But at that instant a
rifle-stock, swung with all the hearty ill-will its wielder could
evoke, crashed against the giant's head, laying open the scalp
and dashing him to his knees.</p>

<p>With the dogged and silent ferocity of his breed, Yar Ali
staggered blindly up again, slashing at foes he could scarcely
see, but a storm of blows battered him down again, nor did his
attackers cease beating him until he lay still. They would have
finished him in short order then, but for another peremptory
order from their chief; whereupon they bound the senseless knife-
man and flung him down alongside Steve, who was fully conscious
and aware of the savage hurt of the bullet in his shoulder.</p>

<p>He glared up at the tall Arab who stood looking down at
him.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>sahib</i>," said this one&mdash;and Steve saw he was no
Bedouin&mdash;"do you not remember me?"</p>

<p>Steve scowled; a bullet-wound is no aid to concentration.</p>

<p>"You look familiar&mdash;by Judas!&mdash;you are! Nureddin El
Mekru!"</p>

<p>"I am honored! The <i>sahib</i> remembers!" Nureddin salaamed
mockingly. "And you remember, no doubt, the occasion on which you
made me a present of&mdash;this!"</p>

<p>The dark eyes shadowed with bitter menace and the shaykh
indicated a thin white scar on the angle of his jaw.</p>

<p>"I remember," snarled Clarney, whom pain and anger did not
tend to make docile. "It was in Somaliland, years ago. You were
in the slave-trade then. A wretch of a nigger escaped from you
and took refuge with me. You walked into my camp one night in
your high-handed way, started a row and in the ensuing scrap you
got a butcher-knife across your face. I wish I'd cut your lousy
throat."</p>

<p>"You had your chance," answered the Arab. "Now the tables are
turned."</p>

<p>"I thought your stamping-ground lay west," growled Clarney;
"Yemen and the Somali country."</p>

<p>"I quit the slave-trade long ago," answered the shaykh. "It is
an outworn game. I led a band of thieves in Yemen for a time;
then again I was forced to change my location. I came here with a
few faithful followers, and by Allah, those wild men nearly slit
my throat at first. But I overcame their suspicions, and now I
lead more men than have followed me in years.</p>

<p>"They whom you fought off yesterday were my men&mdash;scouts I
had sent out ahead. My oasis lies far to the west. We have ridden
for many days, for I was on my way to this very city. When my
scouts rode in and told me of two wanderers, I did not alter my
course, for I had business first in Beled-el-Djinn. We rode into
the city from the west and saw your tracks in the sand. We
followed them, and you were blind buffalo who heard not our
coming."</p>

<p>Steve snarled. "You wouldn't have caught us so easy, only we
thought no Bedouin would dare come into Kara-Shehr."</p>

<p>Nureddin nodded. "But I am no Bedouin. I have traveled far and
seen many lands and many races, and I have read many books. I
know that fear is smoke, that the dead are dead, and that djinn
and ghosts and curses are mists that the wind blows away. It was
because of the tales of the red stone that I came into this
forsaken desert. But it has taken months to persuade my men to
ride with me here.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I am here! And your presence is a delightful
surprise. Doubtless you have guessed why I had you taken alive; I
have more elaborate entertainment planned for you and that Pathan
swine. Now&mdash;I take the Fire of Asshurbanipal and we will
go."</p>

<p>He turned toward the dais, and one of his men, a bearded one-
eyed giant, exclaimed, "Hold, my lord! Ancient evil reigned here
before the days of Muhammad! The djinn howl through these halls
when the winds blow, and men have seen ghosts dancing on the
walls beneath the moon. No man of mortals has dared this black
city for a thousand years&mdash;save one, half a century ago, who
fled shrieking.</p>

<p>"You have come here from Yemen; you do not know the ancient
curse on this foul city, and this evil stone, which pulses like
the red heart of Satan! We have followed you here against our
judgment, because you have proven yourself a strong man, and have
said you hold a charm against all evil beings. You said you but
wished to look on this mysterious gem, but now we see it is your
intention to take it for yourself. Do not offend the djinn!"</p>

<p>"Nay, Nureddin, do not offend the djinn!" chorused the other
Bedouins. The shaykh's own hard-bitten ruffians, standing in a
compact group somewhat apart from the Bedouins, said nothing;
hardened to crimes and deeds of impiety, they were less affected
by the superstitions of the desert men, to whom the dread tale of
the accursed city had been repeated for centuries. Steve, even
while hating Nureddin with concentrated venom, realized the
magnetic power of the man, the innate leadership that had enabled
him to overcome thus far the fears and traditions of ages.</p>

<p>"The curse is laid on infidels who invade the city," answered
Nureddin, "not on the Faithful. See, in this chamber have we
overcome our <i>kafir</i> foes!"</p>

<p>A white-bearded desert hawk shook his head.</p>

<p>"The curse is more ancient than Muhammad, and recks not of
race or creed. Evil men reared this black city in the dawn of the
Beginnings of Days. They oppressed our ancestors of the black
tents, and warred among themselves; aye, the black walls of this
foul city were stained with blood, and echoed to the shouts of
unholy revel and the whispers of dark intrigues.</p>

<p>"Thus came the stone to the city: there dwelt a magician at
the court of Asshurbanipal, and the black wisdom of ages was not
denied to him. To gain honor and power for himself, he dared the
horrors of a nameless vast cavern in a dark, untraveled land, and
from those fiend-haunted depths he brought that blazing gem, which
is carved of the frozen flames of Hell! By reason of his fearful
power in black magic, he put a spell on the demon which guarded
the ancient gem, and so stole away the stone. And the demon slept
in the cavern unknowing.</p>

<p>"So this magician&mdash;Xuthltan by name&mdash;dwelt in the
court of the sultan Asshurbanipal and did magic and forecast
events by scanning the lurid deeps of the stone, into which no
eyes but his could look unblinded. And men called the stone the
Fire of Asshurbanipal, in honor of the king.</p>

<p>"But evil came upon the kingdom and men cried out that it was
the curse of the djinn, and the sultan in great fear bade
Xuthltan take the gem and cast it into the cavern from which he
had taken it, lest worse ill befall them.</p>

<p>"Yet it was not the magician's will to give up the gem wherein
he read strange secrets of pre-Adamite days, and he fled to the
rebel city of Kara-Shehr, where soon civil war broke out and men
strove with one another to possess the gem. Then the king who
ruled the city, coveting the stone, seized the magician and put
him to death by torture, and in this very room he watched him
die; with the gem in his hand the king sat upon the
throne&mdash;even as he has sat upon the throne&mdash;even as he
has sat throughout the centuries&mdash;even as now he sits!"</p>

<p>The Arab's finger stabbed at the moldering bones on the marble
throne, and the wild desert men blenched; even Nureddin's own
scoundrels recoiled, catching their breath, but the shaykh showed
no sign of perturbation.</p>

<p>"As Xuthltan died," continued the old Bedouin, "he cursed the
stone whose magic had not saved him, and he shrieked aloud the
fearful words which undid the spell he had put upon the demon in
the cavern, and set the monster free. And crying out on the
forgotten gods, Cthulhu and Koth and Yog-Sothoth, and all the
pre-Adamite Dwellers in the black cities under the sea and the
caverns of the earth, he called upon them&mdash;to take back that
which was theirs, and with his dying breath pronounced doom on
the false king, and that doom was that the king should sit on his
throne holding in his hand the Fire of Asshurbanipal until the
thunder of judgment Day.</p>

<p>"Thereat the great stone cried out as a live thing cries, and
the king and his soldiers saw a black cloud spinning up from the
floor, and out of the cloud blew a fetid wind, and out of the
wind came a grisly shape which stretched forth fearsome paws and
laid them on the king, who shriveled and died at their touch. And
the soldiers fled screaming, and all the people of the city ran
forth wailing into the desert, where they perished or gained
through the wastes to the far oasis towns. Kara-Shehr lay silent
and deserted, the haunt of the lizard and the jackal. And when
some of the desert-people ventured into the city they found the
king dead on his throne, clutching the blazing gem, but they
dared not lay hand upon it, for they knew the demon lurked near
to guard it through all the ages&mdash;as he lurks near even as
we stand here."</p>

<p>The warriors shuddered involuntarily and glanced about, and
Nureddin said, "Why did he not come forth when the Franks entered
the chamber? Is he deaf, that the sound of the combat has not
awakened him?"</p>

<p>"We have not touched the gem," answered the old Bedouin, "nor
had the Franks molested it. Men have looked on it and lived; but
no mortal may touch it and survive."</p>

<p>Nureddin started to speak, gazed at the stubborn, uneasy faces
and realized the futility of argument. His attitude changed
abruptly.</p>

<p>"I am master here," he snapped, dropping a hand to his
holster. "I have not sweat and bled for this gem to be balked at
the last by groundless fears! Stand back, all! Let any man cross
me at the peril of his head!"</p>

<p>He faced them, his eyes blazing, and they fell back, cowed by
the force of his ruthless personality. He strode boldly up the
marble steps, and the Arabs caught their breath, recoiling toward
the door; Yar Ali, conscious at last, groaned dismally. God!
thought Steve, what a barbaric scene!&mdash;bound captives on the
dust-heaped floor, wild warriors clustered about, gripping their
weapons, the raw acrid scent of blood and burnt powder still
fouling the air, corpses strewn in a horrid welter of blood,
brains and entrails&mdash;and on the dais, the hawk-faced shaykh,
oblivious to all except the evil crimson glow in the skeleton
fingers that rested on the marble throne.</p>

<p>A tense silence gripped all as Nureddin stretched forth his
hand slowly, as if hypnotized by the throbbing crimson light. And
in Steve's subconsciousness there shuddered a dim echo, as of
something vast and loathsome waking suddenly from an age-long
slumber. The American's eyes moved instinctively toward the grim
cyclopean walls. The jewel's glow had altered strangely; it
burned a deeper, darker red, angry and menacing.</p>

<p>"Heart of all evil," murmured the shaykh, "how many princes
died for thee in the Beginnings of Happenings? Surely the blood
of kings throbs in thee. The sultans and the princesses and the
generals who wore thee, they are dust and are forgotten, but thou
blazest with majesty undimmed, fire of the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nureddin seized the stone. A shuddery wail broke from the
Arabs, cut through by a sharp inhuman cry. To Steve it seemed,
horribly, that the great jewel had cried out like a living thing!
The stone slipped from the shaykh's hand. Nureddin might have
dropped it; to Steve it looked as though it leaped convulsively,
as a live thing might leap. It rolled from the dais, bounding
from step to step, with Nureddin springing after it, cursing as
his clutching hand missed it. It struck the floor, veered
sharply, and despite the deep dust, rolled like a revolving ball
of fire toward the back wall. Nureddin was close upon it&mdash;it
struck the wall&mdash;the shaykh's hand reached for it.</p>

<p>A scream of mortal fear ripped the tense silence. Without
warning the solid wall had opened. Out of the black wall that
gaped there, a tentacle shot and gripped the shaykh's body as a
python girdles its victim, and jerked him headlong into the
darkness. And then the wall showed blank and solid once more;
only from within sounded a hideous, high-pitched, muffled
screaming that chilled the blood of the listeners. Howling
wordlessly, the Arabs stampeded, jammed in a battling, screeching
mass in the doorway, tore through and raced madly down the wide
stairs.</p>

<p>Steve and Yar Ali, lying helplessly, heard the frenzied clamor
of their flight fade away into the distance, and gazed in dumb
horror at the grim wall. The shrieks had faded into a more
horrific silence. Holding their breath, they heard suddenly a
sound that froze the blood in their veins&mdash;the soft sliding
of metal or stone in a groove. At the same time the hidden door
began to open, and Steve caught a glimmer in the blackness that
might have been the glitter of monstrous eyes. He closed his own
eyes; he dared not look upon whatever horror slunk from that
hideous black well. He knew that there are strains the human
brain cannot stand, and every primitive instinct in his soul
cried out to him that this thing was nightmare and lunacy. He
sensed that Yar Ali likewise closed his eyes, and the two lay
like dead men.</p>

<p>Clarney heard no sound, but he sensed the presence of a
horrific evil too grisly for human comprehension&mdash;of an
Invader from Outer Gulfs and far black reaches of cosmic being. A
deadly cold pervaded the chamber, and Steve felt the glare of
inhuman eyes sear through his closed lids and freeze his
consciousness. If he looked, if he opened his eyes, he knew stark
black madness would be his instant lot.</p>

<p>He felt a soul-shakingly foul breath against his face and knew
that the monster was bending close above him, but he lay like a
man frozen in a nightmare. He clung to one thought: neither he
nor Yar Ali had touched the jewel this horror guarded.</p>

<p>Then he no longer smelled the foul odor, the coldness in the
air grew appreciably less, and he heard again the secret door
slide in its groove. The fiend was returning to its hiding-place.
Not all the legions of Hell could have prevented Steve's eyes,
from opening a trifle. He had only a glimpse as the hidden door
slid to&mdash;and that one glimpse was enough to drive all
consciousness from his brain. Steve Clarney, iron-nerved
adventurer, fainted for the only time in his checkered life.</p>

<p>How long he lay there Steve never knew, but it could not have
been long, for he was roused by Yar Ali's whisper, "Lie still,
<i>sahib</i>, a little shifting of my body and I can reach thy cords
with my teeth."</p>

<p>Steve felt the Afghan's powerful teeth at work on his bonds,
and as he lay with his face jammed into the thick dust, and his
wounded shoulder began to throb agonizingly&mdash;he had
forgotten it until now&mdash;he began to gather the wandering
threads of his consciousness, and it all came back to him. How
much, he wondered dazedly, had been the nightmares of delirium,
born from suffering and the thirst that caked his throat? The
fight with the Arabs had been real&mdash;the bonds and the
wounds showed that&mdash;but the grisly doom of the
shaykh&mdash;the thing that had crept out of the black entrance
in the wall&mdash;surely that had been a figment of delirium.
Nureddin had fallen into a well or pit of some sort&mdash;Steve
felt his hands were free and he rose to a sitting posture,
fumbling for a pocket-knife the Arabs had overlooked. He did not
look up or about the chamber as he slashed, the cords that bound
his ankles, and then freed Yar Ali, working awkwardly because
his left arm was stiff and useless.</p>

<p>"Where are the Bedouins?" he asked, as the Afghan rose,
lifting him to his feet.</p>

<p>"Allah, <i>sahib</i>," whispered Yar Ali, "are you mad? Have you
forgotten? Let us go quickly before the djinn returns!"</p>

<p>"It was a nightmare," muttered Steve. "Look&mdash;the jewel is
back on the throne&mdash;" His voice died out. Again that red
glow throbbed about the ancient throne, reflecting from the
moldering skull; again in the outstretched finger-bones pulsed
the Fire of Asshurbanipal. But at the foot of the throne lay
another object that had not been there before&mdash;the severed
head of Nureddin el Mekru stared sightlessly up at the gray light
filtering through the stone ceiling. The bloodless lips were
drawn back from the teeth in a ghastly grin, the staring eyes
mirrored an intolerable horror. In the thick dust of the floor
three spoors showed&mdash;one of the shaykh's where he had
followed the red jewel as it rolled to the wall, and above it two
other sets of tracks, coming to the throne and returning to the
wall&mdash;vast, shapeless tracks, as of splayed feet, taloned
and gigantic, neither human nor animal.</p>

<p>"My God!" choked Steve. "It was true&mdash;and the
Thing&mdash;the Thing I saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>Steve remembered the flight from that chamber as a rushing
nightmare, in which he and his companion hurtled headlong down an
endless stair that was a gray well of fear, raced blindly through
dusty silent chambers, past the glowering idol in the mighty hall
and into the blazing light of the desert sun, where they fell
slavering, fighting for breath.</p>

<p>Again Steve was roused by the Afridi's voice: "<i>Sahib, sahib</i>,
in the Name of Allah the Compassionate, our luck has turned!"</p>

<p>Steve looked at his companion as a man might look in a trance:
The big Afghan's garments were in tatters, and blood-soaked. He
was stained with dust and caked with blood, and his voice was a
croak. But his eyes were alight with hope and he pointed with a
trembling finger.</p>

<p>"In the shade of yon ruined wall!" he croaked, striving to
moisten his blackened lips. "<i>Allah il allah!</i> The horses of the
men we killed! With canteens and food-pouches at the saddle-
horns! Those dogs fled without halting for the steeds of their
comrades!"</p>

<p>New life surged up into Steve's bosom and he rose,
staggering.</p>

<p>"Out of here," he mumbled. "Out of here, quick!"</p>

<p>Like dying men they stumbled to the horses, tore them loose
and climbed fumblingly into the saddles.</p>

<p>"We'll lead the spare mounts," croaked Steve, and Yar Ali
nodded emphatic agreement.</p>

<p>"Belike we shall need them ere we sight the coast."</p>

<p>Though their tortured nerves screamed for the water that swung
in canteens at the saddle-horns, they turned the mounts aside
and, swaying in the saddle, rode like flying corpses down the
long sandy street of Kara-Shehr, between the ruined palaces and
the crumbling columns, crossed the fallen wall and swept out into
the desert. Not once did either glance back toward that black
pile of ancient horror, nor did either speak until the ruins
faded into the hazy distance. Then and only then did they draw
rein and ease their thirst.</p>

<p><i>"Allah il allah!"</i> said Yar Ali piously. "Those dogs have
beaten me until it is as though every bone in my body were
broken. Dismount, I beg thee, <i>sahib</i>, and let me probe for that
accursed bullet, and dress thy shoulder to the best of my meager
ability."</p>

<p>While this was going on, Yar Ali spoke, avoiding his friend's
eye, "You said, <i>sahib</i>, you said something about&mdash;about
seeing? What saw ye, in Allah's name?"</p>

<p>A strong shudder shook the American's steely frame.</p>

<p>"You didn't look when&mdash;when the&mdash;the Thing put back
the jewel in the skeleton's hand and left Nureddin's head on the
dais?"</p>

<p>"By Allah, not I!" swore Yar Ali. "My eyes were as closed as
if they had been welded together by the molten irons of
Satan!"</p>

<p>Steve made no reply until the comrades had once more swung
into the saddle and started on their long trek for the coast,
which, with spare horses, food, water and weapons, they had a
good chance to reach.</p>

<p>"I looked," the American said somberly. "I wish I had not; I
know I'll dream about it for the rest of my life. I had only a
glance; I couldn't describe it as a man describes an earthly
thing. God help me, it wasn't earthly or sane either. Mankind
isn't the first owner of the earth; there were Beings here before
his coming&mdash;and now, survivals of hideously ancient epochs.
Maybe spheres of alien dimensions press unseen on this material
universe today. Sorcerers have called up sleeping devils before
now and controlled them with magic. It is not unreasonable to
suppose an Assyrian magician could invoke an elemental demon out
of the earth to avenge him and guard something that must have
come out of Hell in the first place."</p>

<p>"I'll try to tell you what I glimpsed; then we'll never speak
of it again. It was gigantic and black and shadowy; it was a
hulking monstrosity that walked upright like a man, but it was
like a toad, too, and it was winged and tentacled. I saw only its
back; if I'd seen the front of it&mdash;its face&mdash;I'd have
undoubtedly lost my mind. The old Arab was right; God help us, it
was the monster that Xuthltan called up out of the dark blind
caverns of the earth to guard the Fire of Asshurbanipal!"</p>
