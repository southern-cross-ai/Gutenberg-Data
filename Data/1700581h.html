The Woman With The Diamond</b></h2>
  <p>I  was, perhaps, the plainest girl in the room that night. I was also the  happiest&mdash;up to one o&rsquo;clock. Then my whole world crumbled, or, at least,  suffered an eclipse. Why and how, I am about to relate. </p>
  <p>I  was not made for love. This I had often said to myself; very often of late. In  figure I am too diminutive, in face far too unbeautiful, for me to cherish  expectations of this nature. Indeed, love had never entered into my plan of  life, as was evinced by the nurse&rsquo;s diploma I had just gained after three years  of hard study and severe training. </p>
  <p>I  was not made for love. But if I had been; had I been gifted with height,  regularity of feature, or even with that eloquence of expression which redeems  all defects save those which savor of deformity, I knew well whose eye I should  have chosen to please, whose heart I should have felt proud to win. </p>
  <p>This  knowledge came with a rush to my heart&mdash;(did I say heart? I should have said  understanding, which is something very different)&mdash;when, at the end of the first  dance, I looked up from the midst of the bevy of girls by whom I was surrounded  and saw Anson Durand&rsquo;s fine figure emerging from that quarter of the hall where  our host and hostess stood to receive their guests. His eye was roaming hither  and thither and his manner was both eager and expectant. Whom was he seeking?  Some one of the many bright and vivacious girls about me, for he turned almost  instantly our way. But which one? </p>
  <p>I  thought I knew. I remembered at whose house I had met him first, at whose house  I had seen him many times since. She was a lovely girl, witty and vivacious,  and she stood at this very moment at my elbow. In her beauty lay the lure, the  natural lure for a man of his gifts and striking personality. If I continued to  watch, I should soon see his countenance light up under the recognition she  could not fail to give him. And I was right; in another instant it did, and  with a brightness there was no mistaking. But one feeling common to the human  heart lends such warmth, such expressiveness to the features. How handsome it  made him look, how distinguished, how everything I was not except&mdash; </p>
  <p>But  what does this mean? He has passed Miss Sperry&mdash;passed her with a smile and a  friendly word&mdash;and is speaking to me, singling me out, offering me his arm! He  is smiling, too, not as he smiled on Miss Sperry, but more warmly, with more  that is personal in it. I took his arm in a daze. The lights were dimmer than I  thought; nothing was really bright except his smile. It seemed to change the  world for me. I forgot that I was plain, forgot that I was small, with nothing  to recommend me to the eye or heart, and let myself be drawn away, asking  nothing, anticipating nothing, till I found myself alone with him in the  fragrant recesses of the conservatory, with only the throb of music in our ears  to link us to the scene we had left. </p>
  <p>Why  had he brought me here, into this fairyland of opalescent lights and  intoxicating perfumes? What could he have to say&mdash;to show? Ah in another moment  I knew. He had seized my hands, and love, ardent love, came pouring from his  lips. </p>
  <p>Could  it be real? Was I the object of all this feeling, <i>I?</i> If so, then life had  changed for me indeed. </p>
  <p>Silent  from rush of emotion, I searched his face to see if this Paradise, whose gates  I was thus passionately bidden to enter, was indeed a verity or only a dream  born of the excitement of the dance and the charm of a scene exceptional in its  splendor and picturesqueness even for so luxurious a city as New York. </p>
  <p>But  it was no mere dream. Truth and earnestness were in his manner, and his words  were neither feverish nor forced. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love you I! I need you!&rdquo; So I heard, and so he soon made me believe. &ldquo;You have  charmed me from the first. Your tantalizing, trusting, loyal self, like no  other, sweeter than any other, has drawn the heart from my breast. I have seen  many women, admired many women, but you only have I loved. Will you be my  wife?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  was dazzled; moved beyond anything I could have conceived. I forgot all that I  had hitherto said to myself&mdash;all that I had endeavored to impress upon my heart  when I beheld him approaching, intent, as I believed, in his search for another  woman; and, confiding in his honesty, trusting entirely to his faith, I allowed  the plans and purposes of years to vanish in the glamour of this new joy, and  spoke the word which linked us together in a bond which half an hour before I  had never dreamed would unite me to any man. </p>
  <p>His  impassioned &ldquo;Mine! mine!&rdquo; filled my cup to overflowing. Something of the  ecstasy of living entered my soul; which, in spite of all I have suffered  since, recreated the world for me and made all that went before but the prelude  to the new life, the new joy. </p>
  <p>Oh,  I was happy, happy, perhaps too happy! As the conservatory filled and we passed  back into the adjoining room, the glimpse I caught of myself in one of the  mirrors startled me into thinking so. For had it not been for the odd color of  my dress and the unique way in which I wore my hair that night, I should not  have recognized the beaming girl who faced me so naively from the depths of the  responsive glass. </p>
  <p>Can  one be too happy? I do not know. I know that one can be too perplexed, too  burdened and too sad. </p>
  <p>Thus  far I have spoken only of myself in connection with the evening&rsquo;s elaborate  function. But though entitled by my old Dutch blood to a certain social  consideration which I am happy to say never failed me, I, even in this hour of  supreme satisfaction, attracted very little attention and awoke small comment.  There was another woman present better calculated to do this. A fair woman,  large and of a bountiful presence, accustomed to conquest, and gifted with the  power of carrying off her victories with a certain lazy grace irresistibly  fascinating to the ordinary man; a gorgeously appareled woman, with a diamond  on her breast too vivid for most women, almost too vivid for her. I noticed  this diamond early in the evening, and then I noticed her. She was not as fine  as the diamond, but she was very fine, and, had I been in a less ecstatic frame  of mind, I might have envied the homage she received from all the men, not  excepting him upon whose arm I leaned. Later, there was no one in the world I  envied less. </p>
  <p>The  ball was a private and very elegant one. There were some notable guests. One  gentleman in particular was pointed out to me as an Englishman of great  distinction and political importance. I thought him a very interesting man for  his years, but odd and a trifle self-centered. Though greatly courted, he  seemed strangely restless under the fire of eyes to which he was constantly  subjected, and only happy when free to use his own in contemplation of the  scene about him. Had I been less absorbed in my own happiness I might have  noted sooner than I did that this contemplation was confined to such groups as  gathered about the lady with the diamond. But this I failed to observe at the  time, and consequently was much surprised to come upon him, at the end of one  of the dances, talking with this lady in an animated and courtly manner totally  opposed to the apathy, amounting to boredom, with which he had hitherto met all  advances. </p>
  <p>Yet  it was not admiration for her person which he openly displayed. During the  whole time he stood there his eyes seldom rose to her face; they lingered  mainly&mdash;and this was what aroused my curiosity&mdash;on the great fan of ostrich  plumes which this opulent beauty held against her breast. Was he desirous of  seeing the great diamond she thus unconsciously (or was it consciously)  shielded from his gaze? It was possible, for, as I continued to note him, he  suddenly bent toward her and as quickly raised himself again with a look which  was quite inexplicable to me. The lady had shifted her fan a moment and his  eyes had fallen on the gem. </p>
  <p>The  next thing I recall with any definiteness was a <i>tete-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> conversation which  I held with my lover on a certain yellow divan at the end of one of the halls. </p>
  <p>To  the right of this divan rose a curtained recess, highly suggestive of romance,  called &ldquo;the alcove.&rdquo; As this alcove figures prominently in my story, I will pause  here to describe it. </p>
  <p>It  was originally intended to contain a large group of statuary which our host,  Mr. Ramsdell, had ordered from Italy to adorn his new house. He is a man of  original ideas in regard to such matters, and in this instance had gone so far  as to have this end of the house constructed with a special view to an  advantageous display of this promised work of art. Fearing the ponderous effect  of a pedestal large enough to hold such a considerable group, he had planned to  raise it to the level of the eye by having the alcove floor built a few feet  higher than the main one. A flight of low, wide steps connected the two, which,  following the curve of the wall, added much to the beauty of this portion of  the hall. </p>
  <p>The  group was a failure and was never shipped; but the alcove remained, and,  possessing as it did all the advantages of a room in the way of heat and light,  had been turned into a miniature retreat of exceptional beauty. </p>
  <p>The  seclusion it offered extended, or so we were happy to think, to the solitary  divan at its base on which Mr. Durand and I were seated. With possibly an undue  confidence in the advantage of our position, we were discussing a subject  interesting only to ourselves, when Mr. Durand interrupted himself to declare:  &ldquo;You are the woman I want, you and you only. And I want you soon. When do you  think you can marry me? Within a week&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Did  my look stop him? I was startled. I had heard no incoherent phrase from him  before. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  week!&rdquo; I remonstrated. &ldquo;We take more time than that to fit ourselves for a  journey or some transient pleasure. I hardly realize my engagement yet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not been thinking of it for these last two months as I have.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I replied demurely, forgetting everything else in my delight at this admission. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  are you a nomad among clubs and restaurants.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I have a home.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  do you love me as deeply as I do you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  I thought open to argument. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  home you speak of is a luxurious one,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I can not offer you its  equal Do you expect me to?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  was indignant. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know that I do not. Shall I, who deliberately chose a nurse&rsquo;s life when an  indulgent uncle&rsquo;s heart and home were open to me, shrink from braving poverty  with the man I love? We will begin as simply as you please&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he peremptorily put in, yet with a certain hesitancy which seemed to speak of  doubts he hardly acknowledged to himself, &ldquo;I will not marry you if I must  expose you to privation or to the genteel poverty I hate. I love you more than  you realize, and wish to make your life a happy one. I can not give you all you  have been accustomed to in your rich uncle&rsquo;s house, but if matters prosper with  me, if the chance I have built on succeeds&mdash;and it will fail or succeed  tonight&mdash;you will have those comforts which love will heighten into luxuries  and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  was becoming incoherent again, and this time with his eyes fixed elsewhere than  on my face. Following his gaze, I discovered what had distracted his attention.  The lady with the diamond was approaching us on her way to the alcove. She was  accompanied by two gentlemen, both strangers to me, and her head, sparkling  with brilliants, was turning from one to the other with an indolent grace. I  was not surprised that the man at my side quivered and made a start as if to rise.  She was a gorgeous image. In comparison with her imposing figure in its  trailing robe of rich pink velvet, my diminutive frame in its sea-green gown  must have looked as faded and colorless as a half-obliterated pastel. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  striking woman,&rdquo; I remarked as I saw he was not likely to resume the  conversation which her presence had interrupted. &ldquo;And what a diamond!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  glance he cast me was peculiar. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you notice it particularly?&rdquo; he asked. </p>
  <p>Astonished,  for there was something very uneasy in his manner so that I half expected to  see him rise and join the group he was so eagerly watching without waiting for  my lips to frame a response, I quickly replied: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would be difficult not to notice what one would naturally expect to see only on  the breast of a queen. But perhaps she is a queen. I should judge so from the  homage which follows her.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>His  eyes sought mine. There was inquiry in them, but it was an inquiry I did not  understand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can you know about diamonds?&rdquo; he presently demanded. &ldquo;Nothing but their  glitter, and glitter is not all,&mdash;the gem she wears may be a very tawdry one.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  flushed with humiliation. He was a dealer in gems&mdash;that was his business&mdash;and the  check which he had put upon my enthusiasm certainly made me conscious of my own  presumption. Yet I was not disposed to take back my words. I had had a better  opportunity than himself for seeing this remarkable jewel, and, with the  perversity of a somewhat ruffled mood, I burst forth, as soon as the color had  subsided from my cheeks: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! It is glorious, magnificent. I never saw its like. I doubt if you ever  have, for all your daily acquaintance with jewels. Its value must be enormous.  Who is she? You seem to know her.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was a direct question, but I received no reply. Mr. Durand&rsquo;s eyes had followed  the lady, who had lingered somewhat ostentatiously on the top step and they did  not return to me till she had vanished with her companions behind the long  plush curtain which partly veiled the entrance. By this time he had forgotten  my words, if he had ever heard them and it was with the forced animation of one  whose thoughts are elsewhere that he finally returned to the old plea: </p>
  <p>When  would I marry him? If he could offer me a home in a month&mdash;and he would know by  to-morrow if he could do so&mdash;would I come to him then? He would not say in a  week; that was perhaps to soon; but in a month? Would I not promise to be his  in a month? </p>
  <p>What  I answered I scarcely recall. His eyes had stolen back to the alcove and mine  had followed them. The gentlemen who had accompanied the lady inside were  coming out again, but others were advancing to take their places, and soon she  was engaged in holding a regular court in this favored retreat. </p>
  <p>Why  should this interest me? Why should I notice her or look that way at all?  Because Mr. Durand did? Possibly. I remember that for all his ardent  love-making, I felt a little piqued that he should divide his attentions in  this way. Perhaps I thought that for this evening, at least, he might have been  blind to a mere coquette&rsquo;s fascinations. </p>
  <p>I  was thus doubly engaged in listening to my lover&rsquo;s words and in watching the  various gentlemen who went up and down the steps, when a former partner  advanced and reminded me that I had promised him a waltz. Loath to leave Mr.  Durand, yet seeing no way of excusing myself to Mr. Fox, I cast an appealing  glance at the former and was greatly chagrined to find him already on his feet. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enjoy  your dance,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I have a word to say to Mrs. Fairbrother,&rdquo; and was gone  before my new partner had taken me on his arm. </p>
  <p>Was  Mrs. Fairbrother the lady with the diamond? Yes; as I turned to enter the  parlor with my partner, I caught a glimpse of Mr. Durand&rsquo;s tall figure just  disappearing from the step behind the sage-green curtains. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Mrs. Fairbrother?&rdquo; I inquired of Mr. Fox at the end of the dance. </p>
  <p>Mr.  Fox, who is one of society&rsquo;s perennial beaux, knows everybody. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is&mdash;well, she <i>was</i> Abner Fairbrother&rsquo;s wife. You know Fairbrother, the  millionaire who built that curious structure on Eighty-sixth Street. At present  they are living apart&mdash;an amicable understanding, I believe. Her diamond makes  her conspicuous. It is one of the most remarkable stones in New York, perhaps  in the United States. Have you observed it?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that  is, at a distance. Do you think her very handsome?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Fairbrother? She&rsquo;s called so, but she&rsquo;s not my style.&rdquo; Here he gave me a  killing glance. &ldquo;I admire women of mind and heart. They do not need to wear  jewels worth an ordinary man&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  looked about for an excuse to leave this none too desirable partner. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us go back into the long hall,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;The ceaseless whirl of these dancers  is making me dizzy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>With  the ease of a gallant man he took me on his arm and soon we were promenading  again in the direction of the alcove. A passing glimpse of its interior was  afforded me as we turned to retrace our steps in front of the yellow divan. The  lady with the diamond was still there. A fold of the superb pink velvet she  wore protruded across the gap made by the half-drawn curtains, just as it had  done a half-hour before. But it was impossible to see her face or who was with  her. What I could see, however, and did, was the figure of a man leaning  against the wall at the foot of the steps. At first I thought this person unknown  to me, then I perceived that he was no other than the chief guest of the  evening, the Englishman of whom I have previously spoken. </p>
  <p>His  expression had altered. He looked now both anxious and absorbed, particularly  anxious and particularly absorbed; so much so that I was not surprised that no  one ventured to approach him. Again I wondered and again I asked myself for  whom or for what he was waiting. For Mr. Durand to leave this lady&rsquo;s presence?  No, no, I would not believe that. Mr. Durand could not be there still; yet some  women make it difficult for a man to leave them and, realizing this, I could  not forbear casting a parting glance behind me as, yielding to Mr. Fox&rsquo;s  importunities, I turned toward the supper-room. It showed me the Englishman in  the act of lifting two cups of coffee from a small table standing near the  reception-room door. As his manner plainly betokened whither he was bound with  this refreshment, I felt all my uneasiness vanish, and was able to take my seat  at one of the small tables with which the supper-room was filled, and for a few  minutes, at least, lend an ear to Mr. Fox&rsquo;s vapid compliments and trite  opinions. Then my attention wandered. </p>
  <p>I  had not moved nor had I shifted my gaze from the scene before me&mdash;the ordinary  scene of a gay and well-filled supper-room, yet I found myself looking, as if  through a mist I had not even seen develop, at something as strange, unusual  and remote as any phantasm, yet distinct enough in its outlines for me to get a  decided impression of a square of light surrounding the figure of a man in a  peculiar pose not easily imagined and not easily described. It all passed in an  instant, and I sat staring at the window opposite me with the feeling of one  who has just seen a vision. Yet almost immediately I forgot the whole  occurrence in my anxiety as to Mr. Durand&rsquo;s whereabouts. Certainly he was  amusing himself very much elsewhere or he would have found an opportunity of  joining me long before this. He was not even in sight, and I grew weary of the  endless menu and the senseless chit chat of my companion, and, finding him  amenable to my whims, rose from my seat at table and made my way to a group of  acquaintances standing just outside the supper-room door. As I listened to  their greetings some impulse led me to cast another glance down the hall toward  the alcove. A man&mdash;a waiter&mdash;was issuing from it in a rush. Bad news was in his  face, and as his eyes encountered those of Mr. Ramsdell, who was advancing  hurriedly to meet him, he plunged down the steps with a cry which drew a crowd  about the two in an instant. </p>
  <p>What  was it? What had happened? </p>
  <p>Mad  with an anxiety I did not stop to define, I rushed toward this group now  swaying from side to side in irrepressible excitement, when suddenly everything  swam before me and I fell in a swoon to the floor. </p>
  <p>Some  one had shouted aloud </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Fairbrother has been murdered and her diamond stolen! Lock the doors!&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2"></a>Chapter 2 <br>
The Gloves</b></h2>
  <p>I  must have remained insensible for many minutes, for when I returned to full  consciousness the supper-room was empty and the two hundred guests I had left  seated at table were gathered in agitated groups about the hall. This was what  I first noted; not till afterward did I realize my own situation. I was lying  on a couch in a remote corner of this same hall and beside me, but not looking  at me, stood my lover, Mr. Durand. </p>
  <p>How  he came to know my state and find me in the general disturbance I did not stop  to inquire. It was enough for me at that moment to look up and see him so near.  Indeed, the relief was so great, the sense of his protection so comforting that  I involuntarily stretched out my hand in gratitude toward him, but, failing to  attract his attention, slipped to the floor and took my stand at his side. This  roused him and he gave me a look which steadied me, in spite of the thrill of  surprise with which I recognized his extreme pallor and a certain peculiar  hesitation in his manner not at all natural to it. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  some words uttered near us were slowly making their way into my benumbed brain.  The waiter who had raised the first alarm was endeavoring to describe to an  importunate group in advance of us what he had come upon in that murderous  alcove. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was carrying about a tray of ices,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;and seeing the lady sitting  there, went up. I had expected to find the place full of gentlemen, but she was  all alone, and did not move as I picked my way over her long train. The next  moment I had dropped ices, tray and all. I had come face to face with her and  seen that she was dead. She had been stabbed and robbed. There was no diamond  on her breast, but there <i>was</i> blood.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A  hubbub of disordered sentences seasoned with horrified cries followed this  simple description. Then a general movement took place in the direction of the  alcove, during which Mr. Durand stooped to my ear and whispered: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must get out of this. You are not strong enough to stand such excitement. Don&rsquo;t  you think we can escape by the window over there?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  without wraps and in such a snowstorm?&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;Besides, uncle will be  looking for me. He came with me, you know.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>An  expression of annoyance, or was it perplexity, crossed Mr. Durand&rsquo;s face, and  he made a movement as if to leave me. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must go,&rdquo; he began, but stopped at my glance of surprise and assumed a  different air&mdash;one which became him very much better. &ldquo;Pardon me, dear, I will  take you to your uncle. This&mdash;this dreadful tragedy, interrupting so gay a  scene, has quite upset me. I was always sensitive to the sight, the smell, even  to the very mention of the word <i>blood</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>So  was I, but not to the point of cowardice. But then I had not just come from an  interview with the murdered woman. Her glances, her smiles, the lift of her  eyebrows were not fresh memories to me. Some consideration was certainly due him  for the shock he must be laboring under. Yet I did not know how to keep back  the vital question. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  did it? You must have heard some one say.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard nothing,&rdquo; was his somewhat fierce rejoinder. Then, as I made a move,  &ldquo;What you do not wish to follow the crowd <i>there?</i>&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to find my uncle, and he is in that crowd.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Mr.  Durand said nothing further, and together we passed down the hall. A strange  mood pervaded my mind. Instead of wishing to fly a scene which under ordinary  conditions would have filled me with utter repugnance, I felt a desire to see  and hear everything. Not from curiosity, such as moved most of the people about  me, but because of some strong instinctive feeling I could not understand; as  if it were <i>my</i> heart which had been struck, and <i>my</i> fate which was trembling in  the balance. </p>
  <p>We  were consequently among the first to hear such further details as were allowed  to circulate among the now well-nigh frenzied guests. No one knew the  perpetrator of the deed nor did there appear to be any direct evidence  calculated to fix his identity. Indeed, the sudden death of this beautiful  woman in the midst of festivity might have been looked upon as suicide, if the  jewel had not been missing from her breast and the instrument of death removed  from the wound. So far, the casual search which had been instituted had failed  to produce this weapon; but the police would be here soon and then something  would be done. As to the means of entrance employed by the assassin, there  seemed to be but one opinion. The alcove contained a window opening upon a  small balcony. By this he had doubtless entered and escaped. The long plush  curtains which, during the early part of the evening, had remained looped back  on either side of the casement, were found at the moment of the crime&rsquo;s  discovery closely drawn together. Certainly a suspicious circumstance. However,  the question was one easily settled. If any one had approached by the balcony  there would be marks in the snow to show it. Mr. Ramsdell had gone out to see.  He would be coming back soon. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think this a probable explanation of the crime?&rdquo; I demanded of Mr. Durand  at this juncture. &ldquo;If I remember rightly this window overlooks the carriage  drive; it must, therefore, be within plain sight of the door through which some  three hundred guests have passed to-night. How could any one climb to such a  height, lift the window and step in without being seen?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget the awning.&rdquo; He spoke quickly and with unexpected vivacity. &ldquo;The awning  runs up very near this window and quite shuts it off from the sight of arriving  guests. The drivers of departing carriages could see it if they chanced to  glance back. But their eyes are usually on their horses in such a crowd. The  probabilities are against any of them having looked up.&rdquo; His brow had cleared;  a weight seemed removed from his mind. &ldquo;When I went into the alcove to see Mrs.  Fairbrother, she was sitting in a chair near this window looking out. I  remember the effect of her splendor against the snow sifting down in a steady  stream behind her. The pink velvet&mdash;the soft green of the curtains on either  side&mdash;her brilliants&mdash;and the snow for a background! Yes, the murderer came in  that way. Her figure would be plain to any one outside, and if she moved and  the diamond shone&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you see what a probable theory it is? There must be  ways by which a desperate man might reach that balcony. I believe&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>How  eager he was and with what a look he turned when the word came filtering  through the crowd that, though footsteps had been found in the snow pointing  directly toward the balcony, there was none on the balcony itself, proving, as  any one could see, that the attack had not come from without, since no one  could enter the alcove by the window without stepping on the balcony. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Durand has suspicions of his own,&rdquo; I explained determinedly to myself. &ldquo;He met  some one going in as he stepped out. Shall I ask him to name this person?&rdquo; No,  I did not have the courage; not while his face wore so stern a look and was so  resolutely turned away. </p>
  <p>The  next excitement was a request from Mr. Ramsdell for us all to go into the  drawing-room. This led to various cries from hysterical lips, such as, &ldquo;We are  going to be searched!&rdquo; &ldquo;He believes the thief and murderer to be still in the  house!&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you see the diamond on me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they confine their  suspicions to the favored few who were admitted to the alcove?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  will,&rdquo; remarked some one close to my ear. </p>
  <p>But  quickly as I turned I could not guess from whom the comment came. Possibly from  a much beflowered, bejeweled, elderly dame, whose eyes were fixed on Mr.  Durand&rsquo;s averted face. If so, she received a defiant look from mine, which I do  not believe she forgot in a hurry. </p>
  <p>Alas!  it was not the only curious, I might say searching glance I surprised directed  against him as we made our way to where I could see my uncle struggling to  reach us from a short side hall. The whisper seemed to have gone about that Mr.  Durand had been the last one to converse with Mrs. Fairbrother prior to the  tragedy. </p>
  <p>In  time I had the satisfaction of joining my uncle. He betrayed great relief at  the sight of me, and, encouraged by his kindly smile, I introduced Mr. Durand.  My conscious air must have produced its impression, for he turned a startled  and inquiring look upon my companion, then took me resolutely on his own arm,  saying: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is likely to be some unpleasantness ahead for all of us. I do not think the  police will allow any one to go till that diamond has been looked for. This is  a very serious matter, dear. So many think the murderer was one of the guests.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so, too,&rdquo; said I. But why I thought so or why I should say so with such  vehemence, I do not know even now. </p>
  <p>My  uncle looked surprised. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had better not advance any opinions,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;A lady like yourself should  have none on a subject so gruesome. I shall never cease regretting bringing you  here tonight. I shall seize on the first opportunity to take you home. At  present we are supposed to await the action of our host.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  can not keep all these people here long,&rdquo; I ventured. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  most of us will be relieved soon. Had you not better get your wraps so as to be  ready to go as soon as he gives the word?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should prefer to have a peep at the people in the drawing-room first,&rdquo; was my  perverse reply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I want to see them, but I do; and, uncle, I  might as well tell you now that I engaged myself to Mr. Durand this evening&mdash;the  gentleman with me when you first came up.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have engaged yourself to&mdash;to this man&mdash;to marry him, do you mean?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  nodded, with a sly look behind to see if Mr. Durand were near enough to hear.  He was not, and I allowed my enthusiasm to escape in a few quick words. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has chosen <i>me</i>,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the plainest, most uninteresting puss in the whole  city.&rdquo; My uncle smiled. &ldquo;And I believe he loves me; at all events, I know that  I love him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>My  uncle sighed, while giving me the most affectionate of glances. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a pity you should have come to this understanding <i>to-night,</i>&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an  acquaintance of the murdered woman, and it is only right for you to know that  you will have to leave him behind when you start for home. All who have been  seen entering that alcove this evening will necessarily be detained here till  the coroner arrives.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>My  uncle and I strolled toward the drawing-room and as we did so we passed the  library. It held but one occupant, the Englishman. He was seated before a  table, and his appearance was such as precluded any attempt at intrusion, even  if one had been so disposed. There was a fixity in his gaze and a frown on his  powerful forehead which bespoke a mind greatly agitated. It was not for me to  read that mind, much as it interested me, and I passed on, chatting, as if I  had not the least desire to stop. </p>
  <p>I  can not say how much time elapsed before my uncle touched me on the arm with  the remark: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police are here in full force. I saw a detective in plain clothes look in here  a minute ago. He seemed to have his eye on you. There he is again! What can he  want? No, don&rsquo;t turn; he&rsquo;s gone away now.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Frightened  as I had never been in all my life, I managed to keep my head up and maintain  an indifferent aspect. What, as my uncle said, could a detective want of me? I  had nothing to do with the crime; not in the remotest way could I be said to be  connected with it; why, then, had I caught the attention of the police? Looking  about, I sought Mr. Durand. He had left me on my uncle&rsquo;s coming up, but had  remained, as I supposed, within sight. But at this moment he was nowhere to be  seen. Was I afraid on his account? Impossible; yet&mdash; </p>
  <p>Happily  just then the word was passed about that the police had given orders that, with  the exception of such as had been requested to remain to answer questions, the  guests generally should feel themselves at liberty to depart. </p>
  <p>The  time had now come to take a stand and I informed my uncle, to his evident  chagrin, that I should not leave as long as any excuse could be found for  staying. </p>
  <p>He  said nothing at the time, but as the noise of departing carriages gradually  lessened and the great hall and drawing-rooms began to wear a look of desertion  he at last ventured on this gentle protest: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have more pluck, Rita, than I supposed. Do you think it wise to stay on here?  Will not people imagine that you have been requested to do so? Look at those  waiters hanging about in the different doorways. Run up and put on your wraps.  Mr. Durand will come to the house fast enough as soon as he is released. I give  you leave to sit up for him if you will; only let us leave this place&mdash;before  that impertinent little man dares to come around again,&rdquo; he artfully added. </p>
  <p>But  I stood firm, though somewhat moved by his final suggestion; and, being a small  tyrant in my way, at least with him, I carried my point. </p>
  <p>Suddenly  my anxiety became poignant. A party of men, among whom I saw Mr. Durand,  appeared at the end of the hall, led by a very small but self-important  personage whom my uncle immediately pointed out as the detective who had twice  come to the door near which I stood. As this man looked up and saw me still  there, a look of relief crossed his face, and, after a word or two with another  stranger of seeming authority, he detached himself from the group he had  ushered upon the scene, and, approaching me respectfully enough, said with a  deprecatory glance at my uncle whose frown he doubtless understood: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Van Arsdale, I believe?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  nodded, too choked to speak. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry, Madam, if you were expecting to go. Inspector Dalzell has arrived and  would like to speak to you. Will you step into one of these rooms? Not the  library, but any other. He will come to you as quickly as he can.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  tried to carry it off bravely and as if I saw nothing in this summons which was  unique or alarming. But I succeeded only in dividing a wavering glance between  him and the group of men of which he had just formed a part. In the latter were  several gentlemen whom I had noted in Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s train early in the  evening and a few strangers, two of whom were officials. Mr. Durand was with  the former, and his expression did not encourage me. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  affair is very serious,&rdquo; commented the detective on leaving me. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our  excuse for any trouble we may be putting you to.&rdquo; I clutched my uncle&rsquo;s arm. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  shall we go?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;The drawing-room is too large. In this hall my eyes are  for ever traveling in the direction of the alcove. Don&rsquo;t you know some little  room? Oh, what, what can he want of me?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  serious, nothing important,&rdquo; blustered my good uncle. &ldquo;Some triviality such as  you can answer in a moment. A little room? Yes, I know one, there, under the  stairs. Come, I will find the door for you. Why did we ever come to this  wretched ball?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  had no answer for this. Why, indeed! </p>
  <p>My  uncle, who is a very patient man, guided me to the place he had picked out,  without adding a word to the ejaculation in which he had just allowed his  impatience to expend itself. But once seated within, and out of the range of  peering eyes and listening ears, he allowed a sigh to escape him which  expressed the fullness of his agitation. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear,&rdquo; he began, and stopped. &ldquo;I feel&mdash;&rdquo; here he again came to a pause&mdash;&ldquo;that you  should know&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  I managed to ask. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I do not like Mr. Durand and&mdash;that others do not like him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it because of something you knew about him before to-night?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  made no answer. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  because he was seen, like many other gentlemen, talking with that woman some  time before&mdash;a long time before&mdash;she was attacked for her diamond and murdered?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, my dear, <i>he</i> was the last one seen talking to her. Some one may yet be found  who went in after he came out, but as yet he is considered the last. Mr.  Ramsdell himself told me so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  makes no difference,&rdquo; I exclaimed, in all the heat of my long-suppressed  agitation. &ldquo;I am willing to stake my life on his integrity and honor. No man  could talk to me as he did early this evening with any vile intentions at  heart. He was interested, no doubt, like many others, in one who had the name  of being a captivating woman, but&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  paused in sudden alarm. A look had crossed my uncle&rsquo;s face which assured me  that we were no longer alone. Who could have entered so silently? In some  trepidation I turned to see. A gentleman was standing in the doorway, who  smiled as I met his eye. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this Miss Van Arsdale?&rdquo; he asked. </p>
  <p>Instantly  my courage, which had threatened to leave me, returned and I smiled. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Are you the inspector?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inspector  Dalzell,&rdquo; he explained with a bow, which included my uncle. </p>
  <p>Then  he closed the door. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope I have not frightened you,&rdquo; he went on, approaching me with a gentlemanly  air. &ldquo;A little matter has come up concerning which I mean to be perfectly frank  with you. It may prove to be of trivial importance; if so, you will pardon my  disturbing you. Mr. Durand&mdash;you know him?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am engaged to him,&rdquo; I declared before poor uncle could raise his hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are engaged to him. Well, that makes it difficult, and yet, in some respects,  easier for me to ask a certain question.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  must have made it more difficult than easy, for he did not proceed to put this  question immediately, but went on: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know that Mr. Durand visited Mrs. Fairbrother in the alcove a little while  before her death?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been told so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was seen to go in, but I have not yet found any one who saw him come out; consequently  we have been unable to fix the exact minute when he did so. What is the matter,  Miss Van Arsdale? You want to say something?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; I protested, reconsidering my first impulse. Then, as I met his look, &ldquo;He  can probably tell you that himself. I am sure he would not hesitate.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  shall ask him later,&rdquo; was the inspector&rsquo;s response. &ldquo;Meanwhile, are you ready  to assure me that since that time he has not intrusted you with a little  article to keep&mdash;No, no, I do not mean the diamond,&rdquo; he broke in, in very  evident dismay, as I fell back from him in irrepressible indignation and alarm.  &ldquo;The diamond&mdash;well, we shall look for that later; it is another article we are  in search of now, one which Mr. Durand might very well have taken in his hand  without realizing just what he was doing. As it is important for us to find  this article, and as it is one he might very naturally have passed over to you  when he found himself in the hall with it in his hand, I have ventured to ask  you if this surmise is correct.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not,&rdquo; I retorted fiercely, glad that I could speak from my very heart. &ldquo;He  has given me nothing to keep for him. He would not&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Why  that peculiar look in the inspector&rsquo;s eye? Why did he reach out for a chair and  seat me in it before he took up my interrupted sentence and finished it? </p>
  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;would  not give you anything to hold which had belonged to another woman? Miss Van  Arsdale, you do not know men. They do many things which a young, trusting girl  like yourself would hardly expect from them.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  Mr. Durand,&rdquo; I maintained stoutly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  not; let us hope not.&rdquo; Then, with a quick change of manner, he bent toward me,  with a sidelong look at uncle, and, pointing to my gloves, remarked: &ldquo;You wear  gloves. Did you feel the need of two pairs, that you carry another in that  pretty bag hanging from your arm?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  started, looked down, and then slowly drew up into my hand the bag he had  mentioned. The white finger of a glove was protruding from the top. Any one  could see it; many probably had. What did it mean? I had brought no extra pair  with me. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is not mine,&rdquo; I began, faltering into silence as I perceived my uncle turn and  walk a step or two away. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  article we are looking for,&rdquo; pursued the inspector, &ldquo;is a pair of long, white  gloves, supposed to have been worn by Mrs. Fairbrother when she entered the  alcove. Do you mind showing me those, a finger of which I see?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  dropped the bag into his hand. The room and everything in it was whirling  around me. But when I noted what trouble it was to his clumsy fingers to open  it, my senses returned and, reaching for the bag, I pulled it open and snatched  out the gloves. They had been hastily rolled up and some of the fingers were  showing. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me have them,&rdquo; he said. </p>
  <p>With  quaking heart and shaking fingers I handed over the gloves. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Fairbrother&rsquo;s hand was not a small one,&rdquo; he observed as he slowly unrolled  them. &ldquo;Yours is. We can soon tell&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>But  that sentence was never finished. As the gloves fell open in his grasp he  uttered a sudden, sharp ejaculation and I a smothered shriek. An object of  superlative brilliancy had rolled out from them. <i>The</i> diamond! the gem which men  said was worth a king&rsquo;s ransom, and which we all knew had just cost a life. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3"></a>Chapter 3 <br>
Anson Durand</b></h2>
  <p>With  benumbed senses and a dismayed heart, I stared at the fallen jewel as at some  hateful thing menacing both my life and honor. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have had nothing to do with it,&rdquo; I vehemently declared. &ldquo;I did not put the  gloves in my bag, nor did I know the diamond was in them. I fainted at the  first alarm, and&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There!  there! I know,&rdquo; interposed the inspector kindly. &ldquo;I do not doubt you in the  least; not when there is a man to doubt. Miss Van Arsdale, you had better let  your uncle take you home. I will see that the hall is cleared for you. Tomorrow  I may wish to talk to you again, but I will spare you all further importunity  tonight.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  shook my head. It would require more courage to leave at that moment than to  stay. Meeting the inspector&rsquo;s eye firmly, I quietly declared, </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Mr. Durand&rsquo;s good name is to suffer in any way, I will not forsake him. I have  confidence in his integrity, if you have not. It was not his hand, but one much  more guilty, which dropped this jewel into the bag.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!  so! do not be too sure of that, little woman. You had better take your lesson  at once. It will be easier for you, and more wholesome for him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Here  he picked up the jewel. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  they said it was a wonder!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in sudden admiration. &ldquo;I am not  surprised, now that I have seen a great gem, at the famous stories I have read  of men risking life and honor for their possession. If only no blood had been  shed!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle!  uncle!&rdquo; I wailed aloud in my agony. </p>
  <p>It  was all my lips could utter, but to uncle it was enough. Speaking for the first  time, he asked to have a passage made for us, and when the inspector moved  forward to comply, he threw his arm about me, and was endeavoring to find  fitting words with which to fill up the delay, when a short altercation was  heard from the doorway, and Mr. Durand came rushing in, followed immediately by  the inspector. </p>
  <p>His  first look was not at myself, but at the bag, which still hung from my arm. As  I noted this action, my whole inner self seemed to collapse, dragging my  happiness down with it. But my countenance remained unchanged, too much so, it  seems; for when his eye finally rose to my face, he found there what made him  recoil and turn with something like fierceness on his companion. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have been talking to her,&rdquo; he vehemently protested. &ldquo;Perhaps you have gone  further than that. What has happened here? I think I ought to know. She is so  guileless, Inspector Dalzell; so perfectly free from all connection with this  crime. Why have you shut her up here, and plied her with questions, and made  her look at me with such an expression, when all you have against me is just  what you have against some half-dozen others,&mdash;that I was weak enough, or  unfortunate enough, to spend a few minutes with that unhappy woman in the  alcove before she died?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be well if Miss Van Arsdale herself would answer you,&rdquo; was the  inspector&rsquo;s quiet retort. &ldquo;What you have said may constitute all that we have  against <i>you</i>, but it is not all we have against <i>her</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  gasped, not so much at this seeming accusation, the motive of which I believed  myself to understand, but at the burning blush with which it was received by  Mr. Durand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; he demanded, with certain odd breaks in his voice. &ldquo;What can you  have against <i>her?</i>&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  triviality,&rdquo; returned the inspector, with a look in my direction that was, I  felt, not to be mistaken. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not call it a triviality,&rdquo; I burst out. &ldquo;It seems that Mrs. Fairbrother, for  all her elaborate toilet, was found without gloves on her arms. As she  certainly wore them on entering the alcove, the police have naturally been  looking for them. And where do you think they have found them? Not in the  alcove with her, not in the possession of the man who undoubtedly carried them  away with him, but&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, I know,&rdquo; Mr. Durand hoarsely put in. &ldquo;You need not say any more. Oh, my  poor Rita! what have I brought upon you by my weakness?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Weakness!</i>&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  started; I started; my voice was totally unrecognizable. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should give it another name,&rdquo; I added coldly. </p>
  <p>For  a moment he seemed to lose heart, then he lifted his head again, and looked as  handsome as when he pleaded for my hand in the little conservatory. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have that right,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;besides, weakness at such a time, and under such an  exigency, is little short of wrong. It was unmanly in me to endeavor to secrete  these gloves; more than unmanly for me to choose for their hiding-place the  recesses of an article belonging exclusively to yourself. I acknowledge it,  Rita, and shall meet only my just punishment if you deny me in the future both  your sympathy and regard. But you must let me assure you and these gentlemen  also, one of whom can make it very unpleasant for me, that consideration for  you, much more than any miserable anxiety about myself, lay at the bottom of  what must strike you all as an act of unpardonable cowardice. From the moment I  learned of this woman&rsquo;s murder in the alcove, where I had visited her, I  realized that every one who had been seen to approach her within a half-hour of  her death would be subjected to a more or less rigid investigation, and I feared,  if her gloves were found in my possession, some special attention might be  directed my way which would cause you unmerited distress. So, yielding to an  impulse which I now recognize as a most unwise, as well as unworthy one, I took  advantage of the bustle about us, and of the insensibility into which you had  fallen, to tuck these miserable gloves into the bag I saw lying on the floor at  your side. I do not ask your pardon. My whole future life shall be devoted to  winning that; I simply wish to state a fact.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good!&rdquo; It was the inspector who spoke; I could not have uttered a word to save  my life. &ldquo;Perhaps you will now feel that you owe it to this young lady to add  how you came to have these gloves in your possession?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Fairbrother handed them to me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Handed  them to you?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I hardly know why myself. She asked me to take care of them for her. I know  that this must strike you as a very peculiar statement. It was my realization  of the unfavorable effect it could not fail to produce upon those who heard it,  which made me dread any interrogation on the subject. But I assure you it was  as I say. She put the gloves into my hand while I was talking to her, saying  they incommoded her.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I held them for a few minutes, then I put them in my pocket, but quite  automatically, and without thinking very much about it. She was a woman  accustomed to have her own way. People seldom questioned it, I judge.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Here  the tension about my throat relaxed, and I opened my lips to speak. But the  inspector, with a glance of some authority, forestalled me. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  the gloves open or rolled up when she offered them to you?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were rolled up.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see her take them off?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  roll them up?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  which she passed them over to you?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  immediately. She let them lie in her lap for a while.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;While  you talked?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Mr.  Durand bowed. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  looked at the diamond?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Mr.  Durand bowed for the second time. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  you ever seen so fine a diamond before?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you deal in precious stones?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is my business.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  are regarded as a judge of them?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have that reputation.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Durand, would you know this diamond if you saw it?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly should.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  setting was an uncommon one, I hear.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  an unusual one.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  inspector opened his hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this the article?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  God! Where&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you know?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  inspector eyed him gravely. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I have a bit of news for you. It was hidden in the gloves you took from Mrs.  Fairbrother. Miss Van Arsdale was present at their unrolling.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Do  we live, move, breathe at certain moments? It hardly seems so. I know that I  was conscious of but one sense, that of seeing; and of but one faculty, that of  judgment. Would he flinch, break down, betray guilt, or simply show  astonishment? I chose to believe it was the latter feeling only which informed  his slowly whitening and disturbed features. Certainly it was all his words  expressed, as his glances flew from the stone to the gloves, and back again to  the inspector&rsquo;s face. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not believe it. I can not believe it.&rdquo; And his hand flew wildly to his  forehead. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  it is the truth, Mr. Durand, and one you have now to face. How will you do  this? By any further explanations, or by what you may consider a discreet silence?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have nothing to explain,&mdash;the facts are as I have stated.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  inspector regarded him with an earnestness which made my heart sink. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can fix the time of this visit, I hope; tell us, I mean, just when you left the  alcove. You must have seen some one who can speak for you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear not.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Why  did he look so disturbed and uncertain? </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  were but few persons in the hall just then,&rdquo; he went on to explain. &ldquo;No one was  sitting on the yellow divan.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know where you went, though? Whom you saw and what you did before the alarm  spread?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inspector,  I am quite confused. I did go somewhere; I did not remain in that part of the  hall. But I can tell you nothing definite, save that I walked about, mostly  among strangers, till the cry rose which sent us all in one direction and me to  the side of my fainting sweetheart.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you pick out any stranger you talked to, or any one who might have noted you  during this interval? You see, for the sake of this little woman, I wish to  give you every chance.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inspector,  I am obliged to throw myself on your mercy. I have no such witness to my  innocence as you call for. Innocent people seldom have. It is only the guilty  who take the trouble to provide for such contingencies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  was all very well, if it had been uttered with a straightforward air and in a  clear tone. But it was not. I who loved him felt that it was not, and  consequently was more or less prepared for the change which now took place in  the inspector&rsquo;s manner. Yet it pierced me to the heart to observe this change,  and I instinctively dropped my face into my hands when I saw him move toward  Mr. Durand with some final order or word of caution. </p>
  <p>Instantly  (and who can account for such phenomena?) there floated into view before my  retina a reproduction of the picture I had seen, or imagined myself to have  seen, in the supper-room; and as at that time it opened before me an unknown  vista quite removed from the surrounding scene, so it did now, and I beheld  again in faint outlines, and yet with the effect of complete distinctness, a  square of light through which appeared an open passage partly shut off from  view by a half-lifted curtain and the tall figure of a man holding back this  curtain and gazing, or seeming to gaze, at his own breast, on which he had  already laid one quivering finger. </p>
  <p>What  did it mean? In the excitement of the horrible occurrence which had engrossed  us all, I had forgotten this curious experience; but on feeling anew the vague  sensation of shock and expectation which seemed its natural accompaniment, I  became conscious of a sudden conviction that the picture which had opened  before me in the supper-room was the result of a reflection in a glass or  mirror of something then going on in a place not otherwise within the reach of  my vision; a reflection, the importance of which I suddenly realized when I  recalled at what a critical moment it had occurred. A man in a state of dread  looking at his breast, within five minutes of the stir and rush of the dreadful  event which had marked this evening! </p>
  <p>A  hope, great as the despair in which I had just been sunk, gave me courage to  drop my hands and advance impetuously toward the inspector. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  speak, I pray; don&rsquo;t judge any of us further till you have heard what I have to  say.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>In  great astonishment and with an aspect of some severity, he asked me what I had  to say now which I had not had the opportunity of saying before. I replied with  all the passion of a forlorn hope that it was only at this present moment I  remembered a fact which might have a very decided bearing on this case; and,  detecting evidences, as I thought, of relenting on his part, I backed up this  statement by an entreaty for a few words with him apart, as the matter I had to  tell was private and possibly too fanciful for any ear but his own. </p>
  <p>He  looked as if he apprehended some loss of valuable time, but, touched by the  involuntary gesture of appeal with which I supplemented my request, he led me  into a corner, where, with just an encouraging glance toward Mr. Durand, who seemed  struck dumb by my action, I told the inspector of that momentary picture which  I had seen reflected in what I was now sure was some window-pane or mirror. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was at a time coincident, or very nearly coincident, with the perpetration of  the crime you are now investigating,&rdquo; I concluded. &ldquo;Within five minutes  afterward came the shout which roused us all to what had happened in the  alcove. I do not know what passage I saw or what door or even what figure; but  the latter, I am sure, was that of the guilty man. Something in the outline  (and it was the outline only I could catch) expressed an emotion  incomprehensible to me at the moment, but which, in my remembrance, impresses  me as that of fear and dread. It was not the entrance to the alcove I beheld&mdash;that  would have struck me at once&mdash;but some other opening which I might recognize if  I saw it. Can not that opening be found, and may it not give a clue to the man  I saw skulking through it with terror and remorse in his heart?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  this figure, when you saw it, turned toward you or away?&rdquo; the inspector  inquired with unexpected interest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Turned  partly away. He was going from me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you sat&mdash;where?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I show you?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  inspector bowed, then with a low word of caution turned to my uncle. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to take this young lady into the hall for a moment, at her own  request. May I ask you and Mr. Durand to await me here?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Without  pausing for reply, he threw open the door and presently we were pacing the  deserted supper-room, seeking the place where I had sat. I found it almost by a  miracle,&mdash;everything being in great disorder. Guided by my bouquet, which I had  left behind me in my escape from the table, I laid hold of the chair before  which it lay, and declared quite confidently to the inspector: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is where I sat.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Naturally  his glance and mine both flew to the opposite wall. A window was before us of  an unusual size and make. Unlike any which had ever before come under my  observation, it swung on a pivot, and, though shut at the present moment, might  very easily, when opened, present its huge pane at an angle capable of catching  reflections from some of the many mirrors decorating the reception-room  situated diagonally across the hall. As all the doorways on this lower floor  were of unusual width, an open path was offered, as it were, for these  reflections to pass, making it possible for scenes to be imaged here which, to  the persons involved, would seem as safe from any one&rsquo;s scrutiny as if they  were taking place in the adjoining house. </p>
  <p>As  we realized this, a look passed between us of more than ordinary significance.  Pointing to the window, the inspector turned to a group of waiters watching us  from the other side of the room and asked if it had been opened that evening. </p>
  <p>The  answer came quickly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&mdash;just before the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand,&rdquo; broke in the inspector; and, leaning over me, he whispered: &ldquo;Tell  me again exactly what you thought you saw.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>But  I could add little to my former description. &ldquo;Perhaps you can tell me this,&rdquo; he  kindly persisted. &ldquo;Was the picture, when you saw it, on a level with your eye,  or did you have to lift your head in order to see it?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was high up,&mdash;in the air, as it were. That seemed its oddest feature.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  inspector&rsquo;s mouth took a satisfied curve. &ldquo;Possibly I might identify the door  and passage, if I saw them,&rdquo; I suggested. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  certainly,&rdquo; was his cheerful rejoinder; and, summoning one of his men, he was  about to give some order, when his impulse changed, and he asked if I could  draw. </p>
  <p>I  assured him, in some surprise, that I was far from being an adept in that  direction, but that possibly I might manage a rough sketch; whereupon he pulled  a pad and pencil from his pocket and requested me to make some sort of attempt  to reproduce, on paper, my memory of this passage and the door. </p>
  <p>My  heart was beating violently, and the pencil shook in my hand, but I knew that  it would not do for me to show any hesitation in fixing for all eyes what,  unaccountably to myself, continued to be perfectly plain to my own. So I endeavored  to do as he bade me, and succeeded, to some extent, for he uttered a slight  ejaculation at one of its features, and, while duly expressing his thanks,  honored me with a very sharp look. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this your first visit to this house?&rdquo; he asked. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I have been here before.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the evening, or in the afternoon?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the afternoon.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am told that the main entrance is not in use to-night.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  A side door is provided for occasions like the present. Guests entering there  find a special hall and staircase, by which they can reach the upstairs  dressing-rooms, without crossing the main hall. Is that what you mean?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that is what I mean.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  stared at him in wonder. What lay back of such questions as these? </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  came in, as others did, by this side entrance,&rdquo; he now proceeded. &ldquo;Did you  notice, as you turned to go up stairs, an arch opening into a small passageway  at your left?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not,&rdquo; I began, flushing, for I thought I understood him now. &ldquo;I was too  eager to reach the dressing-room to look about me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I may want to show you that arch.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  outline of an arch, backing the figure we were endeavoring to identify, was a  marked feature in the sketch I had shown him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you take a seat near by while I make a study of this matter?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  turned with alacrity to obey. There was something in his air and manner which  made me almost buoyant. Had my fanciful interpretation of what I had seen  reached him with the conviction it had me? If so, there was hope,&mdash;hope for the  man I loved, who had gone in and out between curtains, and not through any arch  such as he had mentioned or I had described. Providence was working for me. I  saw it in the way the men now moved about, swinging the window to and fro,  under the instruction of the inspector, manipulating the lights, opening doors  and drawing back curtains. Providence was working for me, and when, a few  minutes later, I was asked to reseat myself in my old place at the supper-table  and take another look in that slightly deflected glass, I knew that my effort  had met with its reward, and that for the second time I was to receive the  impression of a place now indelibly imprinted on my consciousness. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  not that it?&rdquo; asked the inspector, pointing at the glass with a last look at  the imperfect sketch I had made him, and which he still held in his hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I eagerly responded. &ldquo;All but the man. He whose figure I see there is another  person entirely; I see no remorse, or even fear, in his looks.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not. You are looking at the reflection of one of my men. Miss Van  Arsdale, do you recognize the place now under your eye?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not. You spoke of an arch in the hall, at the left of the carriage entrance,  and I see an arch in the window-pane before me, but&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are looking straight through the alcove,&mdash;perhaps you did not know that another  door opened at its back,&mdash;into the passage which runs behind it. Farther on is  the arch, and beyond that arch the side hall and staircase leading to the  dressing-rooms. This door, the one in the rear of the alcove, I mean, is hidden  from those entering from the main hall by draperies which have been hung over  it for this occasion, but it is quite visible from the back passageway, and  there can be no doubt that it was by its means the man, whose reflected image  you saw, both entered and left the alcove. It is an important fact to  establish, and we feel very much obliged to you for the aid you have given us  in this matter.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Then,  as I continued to stare at him in my elation and surprise, he added, in quick  explanation: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  lights in the alcove, and in the several parlors, are all hung with shades, as  you must perceive, but the one in the hall, beyond the arch, is very bright,  which accounts for the distinctness of this double reflection. Another thing,&mdash;and  it is a very interesting point,&mdash;it would have been impossible for this  reflection to be noticeable from where you sit, if the level of the alcove  flooring had not been considerably higher than that of the main floor. But for  this freak of the architect, the continual passing to and fro of people would  have prevented the reflection in its passage from surface to surface. Miss Van  Arsdale, it would seem that by one of those chances which happen but once or  twice in a lifetime, every condition was propitious at the moment to make this  reflection a possible occurrence,&mdash;even the location and width of the several  doorways and the exact point at which the portiere was drawn aside from the  entrance to the alcove.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is wonderful,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;wonderful!&rdquo; Then, to his astonishment, perhaps, I  asked if there was not a small door of communication between the passageway  back of the alcove and the large central hall. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he replied. &ldquo;It opens just beyond the fireplace. Three small steps lead to it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought so,&rdquo; I murmured, but more to myself than to him. In my mind I was  thinking how a man, if he so wished, could pass from the very heart of this  assemblage into the quiet passageway, and so on into the alcove, without  attracting very much attention from his fellow guests. I forgot that there was  another way of approach even less noticeable&mdash;that by the small staircase  running up beyond the arch directly to the dressing-rooms. </p>
  <p>That  no confusion may arise in any one&rsquo;s mind in regard to these curious approaches,  I subjoin a plan of this portion of the lower floor as it afterward appeared in  the leading dailies. </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700581h-images/page066.png" width="800" height="627"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mr. Durand?&rdquo; I stammered, as I followed the inspector back to the room where we  had left that gentleman. &ldquo;You will believe his statement now and look for this  second intruder with the guiltily-hanging head and frightened mien?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he replied, stopping me on the threshold of the door and taking my hand kindly  in his, &ldquo;if&mdash;(don&rsquo;t start, my dear; life is full of trouble for young and old,  and youth is the best time to face a sad experience) if he is not himself the  man you saw staring in frightened horror at his breast. Have you not noticed  that he is not dressed in all respects like the other gentlemen present? That,  though he has not donned his overcoat, he has put on, somewhat prematurely, one  might say, the large silk handkerchief he presumably wears under it? Have you  not noticed this, and asked yourself why?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  had noticed it. I had noticed it from the moment I recovered from my fainting  fit, but I had not thought it a matter of sufficient interest to ask, even of  myself, his reason for thus hiding his shirt-front. <i>Now</i> I could not. My  faculties were too confused, my heart too deeply shaken by the suggestion which  the inspector&rsquo;s words conveyed, for me to be conscious of anything but the  devouring question as to what I should do if, by my own mistaken zeal, I had  succeeded in plunging the man I loved yet deeper into the toils in which he had  become enmeshed. </p>
  <p>The  inspector left me no time for the settlement of this question. Ushering me back  into the room where Mr. Durand and my uncle awaited our return in apparently  unrelieved silence, he closed the door upon the curious eyes of the various  persons still lingering in the hall, and abruptly said to Mr. Durand: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  explanations you have been pleased to give of the manner in which this diamond  came into your possession are not too fanciful for credence, if you can satisfy  us on another point which has awakened some doubt in the mind of one of my men.  Mr. Durand, you appear to have prepared yourself for departure somewhat  prematurely. Do you mind removing that handkerchief for a moment? My reason for  so peculiar a request will presently appear.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Alas,  for my last fond hope! Mr. Durand, with a face as white as the background of  snow framed by the uncurtained window against which he leaned, lifted his hand  as if to comply with the inspector&rsquo;s request, then let it fall again with a  grating laugh. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see that I am not likely to escape any of the results of my imprudence,&rdquo; he  cried, and with a quick jerk bared his shirt-front. </p>
  <p>A  splash of red defiled its otherwise uniform whiteness! That it was the red of  heart&rsquo;s blood was proved by the shrinking look he unconsciously cast at it. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter 4 <br>
Explanations</b></h2>
  <p>My  love for Anson Durand died at sight of that crimson splash or I thought it did.  In this spot of blood on the breast of him to whom I had given my heart I could  read but one word&mdash;<i>guilt</i>&mdash;heinous guilt, guilt denied and now brought to light in  language that could be seen and read by all men. Why should I stay in such a  presence? Had not the inspector himself advised me to go? </p>
  <p>Yes,  but another voice bade me remain. Just as I reached the door, Anson Durand  found his voice and I heard, in the full, sweet tones I loved so well: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  I am not to be judged like this. I will explain!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>But  here the inspector interposed. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think it wise to make any such attempt without the advice of counsel, Mr.  Durand?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  indignation with which Mr. Durand wheeled toward him raised in me a faint hope. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  God, yes!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Would you have me leave Miss Van Arsdale one minute  longer than is necessary to such dreadful doubts? Rita&mdash;Miss Van  Arsdale&mdash;weakness, and weakness only, has brought me into my present position. I  did not kill Mrs. Fairbrother, nor did I knowingly take her diamond, though  appearances look that way, as I am very ready to acknowledge. I did go to her  in the alcove, not once, but twice, and these are my reasons for doing so:  About three months ago a certain well-known man of enormous wealth came to me  with the request that I should procure for him a diamond of superior beauty. He  wished to give it to his wife, and he wished it to outshine any which could now  be found in New York. This meant sending abroad&mdash;an expense he was quite willing  to incur on the sole condition that the stone should not disappoint him when he  saw it, and that it was to be in his hands on the eighteenth of March, his  wife&rsquo;s birthday. Never before had I had such an opportunity for a large stroke  of business. Naturally elated, I entered at once into correspondence with the  best known dealers on the other side, and last week a diamond was delivered to  me which seemed to fill all the necessary requirements. I had never seen a finer  stone, and was consequently rejoicing in my success, when some one, I do not  remember who now, chanced to speak in my hearing of the wonderful stone  possessed by a certain Mrs. Fairbrother&mdash;a stone so large, so brilliant and so  precious altogether that she seldom wore it, though it was known to  connoisseurs and had a great reputation at Tiffany&rsquo;s, where it had once been  sent for some alteration in the setting. Was this stone larger and finer than  the one I had procured with so much trouble? If so, my labor had all been in  vain, for my patron must have known of this diamond and would expect to see it  surpassed. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was so upset by this possibility that I resolved to see the jewel and make  comparisons for myself. I found a friend who agreed to introduce me to the  lady. She received me very graciously and was amiable enough until the subject  of diamonds was broached, when she immediately stiffened and left me without an  opportunity of proffering my request. However, on every other subject she was  affable, and I found it easy enough to pursue the acquaintance till we were  almost on friendly terms. But I never saw the diamond, nor would she talk about  it, though I caused her some surprise when one day I drew out before her eyes  the one I had procured for my patron and made her look at it. &lsquo;Fine,&rsquo; she  cried, &lsquo;fine!&rsquo; But I failed to detect any envy in her manner, and so knew that  I had not achieved the object set me by my wealthy customer. This was a woeful  disappointment; yet, as Mrs. Fairbrother never wore her diamond, it was among  the possibilities that he might be satisfied with the very fine gem I had  obtained for him, and, influenced by this hope, I sent him this morning a  request to come and see it tomorrow. Tonight I attended this ball, and almost  as soon as I enter the drawing-room I hear that Mrs. Fairbrother is present and  is wearing her famous jewel. What could you expect of me? Why, that I would  make an effort to see it and so be ready with a reply to my exacting customer  when he should ask me to-morrow if the stone I showed him had its peer in the  city. But she was not in the drawing-room then, and later I became interested  elsewhere&rdquo;&mdash;here he cast a look at me&mdash;&ldquo;so that half the evening passed before I  had an opportunity to join her in the so-called alcove, where I had seen her  set up her miniature court. What passed between us in the short interview we  held together you will find me prepared to state, if necessary. It was chiefly  marked by the one short view I succeeded in obtaining of her marvelous diamond,  in spite of the pains she took to hide it from me by some natural movement  whenever she caught my eyes leaving her face. But in that one short look I had  seen enough. This was a gem for a collector, not to be worn save in a royal  presence. How had she come by it? And could Mr. Smythe expect me to procure him  a stone like that? In my confusion I arose to depart, but the lady showed a  disposition to keep me, and began chatting so vivaciously that I scarcely  noticed that she was all the time engaged in drawing off her gloves. Indeed, I  almost forgot the jewel, possibly because her movements hid it so completely,  and only remembered it when, with a sudden turn from the window where she had  drawn me to watch the falling flakes, she pressed the gloves into my hand with  the coquettish request that I should take care of them for her. I remember, as  I took them, of striving to catch another glimpse of the stone, whose  brilliancy had dazzled me, but she had opened her fan between us. A moment  after, thinking I heard approaching steps, I quitted the room. This was my  first visit.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>As  he stopped, possibly for breath, possibly to judge to what extent I was  impressed by his account, the inspector seized the opportunity to ask if Mrs.  Fairbrother had been standing any of this time with her back to him. To which  he answered yes, while they were in the window. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Long  enough for her to pluck off the jewel and thrust it into the gloves, if she had  so wished?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  long enough.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you did not see her do this?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so took the gloves without suspicion?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Entirely  so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  carried them away?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,  yes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  thinking that she might want them the next minute?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt if I was thinking seriously of her at all. My thoughts were on my own  disappointment.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you carry these gloves out in your hand?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  in my pocket.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. And you met&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one. The sound I heard must have come from the rear hall.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  there was nobody on the steps?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  A gentleman was standing at their foot&mdash;Mr. Grey, the Englishman&mdash;but his face  was turned another way, and he looked as if he had been in that same position  for several minutes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  this gentleman&mdash;Mr. Grey&mdash;see you?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not say, but I doubt it. He appeared to be in a sort of dream. There were  other people about, but nobody with whom I was acquainted.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. Now for the second visit you acknowledge having paid this unfortunate  lady.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  inspector&rsquo;s voice was hard. I clung a little more tightly to my uncle, and Mr.  Durand, after one agonizing glance my way, drew himself up as if quite  conscious that he had entered upon the most serious part of the struggle. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had forgotten the gloves in my hurried departure; but presently I remembered  them, and grew very uneasy. I did not like carrying this woman&rsquo;s property about  with me. I had engaged myself, an hour before, to Miss Van Arsdale, and was  very anxious to rejoin her. The gloves worried me, and finally, after a little  aimless wandering through the various rooms, I determined to go back and restore  them to their owner. The doors of the supper-room had just been flung open, and  the end of the hall near the alcove was comparatively empty, save for a certain  quizzical friend of mine, whom I saw sitting with his partner on the yellow  divan. I did not want to encounter him just then, for he had already joked me  about my admiration for the lady with the diamond, and so I conceived the idea  of approaching her by means of a second entrance to the alcove, unsuspected by  most of those present, but perfectly well-known to me, who have been a frequent  guest in this house. A door, covered by temporary draperies, connects, as you  may know, this alcove with a passageway communicating directly with the hall of  entrance and the up-stairs dressing-rooms. To go up the main stairs and come  down by the side one, and so on, through a small archway, was a very simple  matter for me. If no early-departing or late arriving guests were in that hall,  I need fear but one encounter, and that was with the servant stationed at the  carriage entrance. But even he was absent at this propitious instant, and I  reached the door I sought without any unpleasantness. This door opened out  instead of in,&mdash;this I also knew when planning this surreptitious intrusion,  but, after pulling it open and reaching for the curtain, which hung completely  across it, I found it not so easy to proceed as I had imagined. The  stealthiness of my action held back my hand; then the faint sounds I heard  within advised me that she was not alone, and that she might very readily  regard with displeasure my unexpected entrance by a door of which she was  possibly ignorant. I tell you all this because, if by any chance I was seen  hesitating in face of that curtain, doubts might have been raised which I am  anxious to dispel.&rdquo; Here his eyes left my face for that of the inspector. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  certainly had a bad look,&mdash;that I don&rsquo;t deny; but I did not think of appearances  then. I was too anxious to complete a task which had suddenly presented  unexpected difficulties. That I listened before entering was very natural, and  when I heard no voice, only something like a great sigh, I ventured to lift the  curtain and step in. She was sitting, not where I had left her, but on a couch  at the left of the usual entrance, her face toward me, and&mdash;you know how,  Inspector. It was her last sigh I had heard. Horrified, for I had never looked  on death before, much less crime, I reeled forward, meaning, I presume, to rush  down the steps shouting for help, when, suddenly, something fell splashing on  my shirt-front, and I saw myself marked with a stain of blood. This both  frightened and bewildered me, and it was a minute or two before I had the  courage to look up. When I did do so, I saw whence this drop had come. Not from  her, though the red stream was pouring down the rich folds of her dress, but  from a sharp needle-like instrument which had been thrust, point downward, in  the open work of an antique lantern hanging near the doorway. What had happened  to me might have happened to any one who chanced to be in that spot at that  special moment, but I did not realize this then. Covering the splash with my  hands, I edged myself back to the door by which I had entered, watching those  deathful eyes and crushing under my feet the remnants of some broken china with  which the carpet was bestrewn. I had no thought of her, hardly any of myself.  To cross the room was all; to escape as secretly as I came, before the portiere  so nearly drawn between me and the main hall should stir under the hand of some  curious person entering. It was my first sight of blood; my first contact with  crime, and that was what I did,&mdash;I fled.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  last word was uttered with a gasp. Evidently he was greatly affected by this  horrible experience. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am ashamed of myself,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;but nothing can now undo the fact. I slid  from the presence of this murdered woman as though she had been the victim of  my own rage or cupidity; and, being fortunate enough to reach the dressing-room  before the alarm had spread beyond the immediate vicinity of the alcove, found  and put on the handkerchief, which made it possible for me to rush down and  find Miss Van Arsdale, who, somebody told me, had fainted. Not till I stood  over her in that remote corner beyond the supper-room did I again think of the  gloves. What I did when I happened to think of them, you already know. I could  have shown no greater cowardice if I had known that the murdered woman&rsquo;s  diamond was hidden inside them. Yet, I did not know this, or even suspect it.  Nor do I understand, now, her reason for placing it there. Why should Mrs.  Fairbrother risk such an invaluable gem to the custody of one she knew so  little? An unconscious custody, too? Was she afraid of being murdered if she  retained this jewel?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  inspector thought a moment, and then said: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mention your dread of some one entering by the one door before you could escape  by the other. Do you refer to the friend you left sitting on the divan  opposite?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  my friend had left that seat. The portiere was sufficiently drawn for me to detect  that. If I had waited a minute longer,&rdquo; he bitterly added, &ldquo;I should have found  my way open to the regular entrance, and so escaped all this.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Durand, you are not obliged to answer any of my questions; but, if you wish,  you may tell me whether, at this moment of apprehension, you thought of the  danger you ran of being seen from outside by some one of the many coachmen  passing by on the driveway?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;I  did not even think of the window,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why; but, if any one passing by  did see me, I hope they saw enough to substantiate my story.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  inspector made no reply. He seemed to be thinking. I heard afterward that the  curtains, looped back in the early evening, had been found hanging at full  length over this window by those who first rushed in upon the scene of death.  Had he hoped to entrap Mr. Durand into some damaging admission? Or was he  merely testing his truth? His expression afforded no clue to his thoughts, and  Mr. Durand, noting this, remarked with some dignity: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not expect strangers to accept these explanations, which must sound strange  and inadequate in face of the proof I carry of having been with that woman  after the fatal weapon struck her heart. But, to one who knows me, and knows me  well, I can surely appeal for credence to a tale which I here declare to be as  true as if I had sworn to it in a court of justice.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anson!&rdquo;  I passionately cried out, loosening my clutch upon my uncle&rsquo;s arm. My  confidence in him had returned. </p>
  <p>And  then, as I noted the inspector&rsquo;s businesslike air, and my uncle&rsquo;s wavering look  and unconvinced manner, I felt my heart swell, and, flinging all discretion to  the wind, I bounded eagerly forward. Laying my hands in those of Mr. Durand, I  cried fervently: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>I</i>  believe in you. Nothing but your own words shall ever shake my confidence in  your innocence.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  sweet, glad look I received was my best reply. I could leave the room, after  that. </p>
  <p>But  not the house. Another experience awaited me, awaited us all, before this full,  eventful evening came to a close. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5"></a>Chapter 5 <br>
Superstition</b></h2>
  <p>I  had gone up stairs for my wraps&mdash;my uncle having insisted on my withdrawing from  a scene where my very presence seemed in some degree to compromise me. </p>
  <p>Soon  prepared for my departure, I was crossing the hall to the small door communicating  with the side staircase where my uncle had promised to await me, when I felt  myself seized by a desire to have another look below before leaving the place  in which were centered all my deepest interests. </p>
  <p>A  wide landing, breaking up the main flight of stairs some few feet from the top,  offered me an admirable point of view. With but little thought of possible  consequences, and no thought at all of my poor, patient uncle, I slipped down  to this landing, and, protected by the unusual height of its balustrade,  allowed myself a parting glance at the scene with which my most poignant  memories were henceforth to be connected. </p>
  <p>Before  me lay the large square of the central hall. Opening out from this was the  corridor leading to the front door, and incidentally to the library. As my  glance ran down this corridor, I beheld, approaching from the room just  mentioned, the tall figure of the Englishman. </p>
  <p>He  halted as he reached the main hall and stood gazing eagerly at a group of men  and women clustered near the fireplace&mdash;a group on which I no sooner cast my own  eye than my attention also became fixed. </p>
  <p>The  inspector had come from the room where I had left him with Mr. Durand and was  showing to these people the extraordinary diamond, which he had just recovered under  such remarkable if not suspicious circumstances. Young heads and old were  meeting over it, and I was straining my ears to hear such comments as were  audible above the general hubbub, when Mr. Grey made a quick move and I looked  his way again in time to mark his air of concern and the uncertainty he showed  whether to advance or retreat. </p>
  <p>Unconscious  of my watchful eye, and noting, no doubt, that most of the persons in the group  on which his own eye was leveled stood with their backs toward him, he made no  effort to disguise his profound interest in the stone. His eye followed its  passage from hand to hand with a covetous eagerness of which he may not have  been aware, and I was not at all surprised when, after a short interval of  troubled indecision, he impulsively stepped forward and begged the privilege of  handling the gem himself. </p>
  <p>Our  host, who stood not far from the inspector, said something to that gentleman  which led to this request being complied with. The stone was passed over to Mr.  Grey, and I saw, possibly because my heart was in my eyes, that the great man&rsquo;s  hand trembled as it touched his palm. Indeed, his whole frame trembled, and I  was looking eagerly for the result of his inspection when, on his turning to  hold the jewel up to the light, something happened so abnormal and so strange  that no one who was fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to be present in the  house at that instant will ever forget it. </p>
  <p>This  something was a cry, coming from no one knew where, which, unearthly in its  shrillness and the power it had on the imagination, reverberated through the  house and died away in a wail so weird, so thrilling and so prolonged that it  gripped not only my own nerveless and weakened heart, but those of the ten  strong men congregated below me. The diamond dropped from Mr. Grey&rsquo;s hand, and  neither he nor any one else moved to pick it up. Not till silence had come  again&mdash;a silence almost as unendurable to the sensitive ear as the cry which had  preceded it&mdash;did any one stir or think of the gem. Then one gentleman after  another bent to look for it, but with no success, till one of the waiters, who  possibly had followed it with his eye or caught sight of its sparkle on the  edge of the rug, whither it had rolled, sprang and picked it up and handed it  back to Mr. Grey. </p>
  <p>Instinctively  the Englishman&rsquo;s hand closed on it, but it was very evident to me, and I think  to all, that his interest in it was gone. If he looked at it he did not see it,  for he stood like one stunned all the time that agitated men and women were  running hither and thither in unavailing efforts to locate the sound yet  ringing in their ears. Not till these various searchers had all come together  again, in terror of a mystery they could not solve, did he let his hand fall  and himself awake to the scene about him. </p>
  <p>The  words he at once gave utterance to were as remarkable as all the rest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;you must pardon my agitation. This cry&mdash;you need not seek its  source&mdash;is one to which I am only too well accustomed. I have been the happy father  of six children. Five I have buried, and, before the death of each, this same  cry has echoed in my ears. I have but one child left, a daughter,&mdash;she is ill at  the hotel. Do you wonder that I shrink from this note of warning, and show  myself something less than a man under its influence? I am going home; but,  first, one word about this stone.&rdquo; Here he lifted it and bestowed, or appeared  to bestow on it, an anxious scrutiny, putting on his glasses and examining it  carefully before passing it back to the inspector. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard,&rdquo; said he, with a change of tone which must have been noticeable to  every one, &ldquo;that this stone was a very superior one, and quite worthy of the  fame it bore here in America. But, gentlemen, you have all been greatly  deceived in it; no one more than he who was willing to commit murder for its  possession. The stone, which you have just been good enough to allow me to  inspect, is no diamond, but a carefully manufactured bit of paste not worth the  rich and elaborate setting which has been given to it. I am sorry to be the one  to say this, but I have made a study of precious stones, and I can not let this  bare-faced imitation pass through my hands without a protest. Mr. Ramsdell,&rdquo;  this to our host, &ldquo;I beg you will allow me to utter my excuses, and depart at  once. My daughter is worse,&mdash;this I know, as certainly as that I am standing  here. The cry you have heard is the one superstition of our family. Pray God  that I find her alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700581h-images/page090.jpg" width="800" height="613"> </p>
  <p>After  this, what could be said? Though no one who had heard him, not even my own  romantic self, showed any belief in this interpretation of the remarkable sound  that had just gone thrilling through the house, yet, in face of his declared  acceptance of it as a warning, and the fact that all efforts had failed to  locate the sound, or even to determine its source, no other course seemed open  but to let this distinguished man depart with the suddenness his superstitious  fears demanded. </p>
  <p>That  this was in opposition to the inspector&rsquo;s wishes was evident enough. Naturally,  he would have preferred Mr. Grey to remain, if only to make clear his  surprising conclusions in regard to a diamond which had passed through the  hands of some of the best judges in the country, without a doubt having been  raised as to its genuineness. </p>
  <p>With  his departure the inspector&rsquo;s manner changed. He glanced at the stone in his  hand, and slowly shook his head. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt if Mr. Grey&rsquo;s judgment can be depended on, to-night,&rdquo; said he, and  pocketed the gem as carefully as if his belief in its real value had been but  little disturbed by the assertions of this renowned foreigner. </p>
  <p>I  have no distinct remembrance of how I finally left the house, or of what passed  between my uncle and myself on our way home. I was numb with the shock, and  neither my intelligence nor my feelings were any longer active. I recall but  one impression, and that was the effect made on me by my old home on our  arrival there, as of something new and strange; so much had happened, and such  changes had taken place in myself since leaving it five hours before. But  nothing else is vivid in my remembrance till that early hour of the dreary  morning, when, on waking to the world with a cry, I beheld my uncle&rsquo;s anxious  figure, bending over me from the foot-board. </p>
  <p>Instantly  I found tongue, and question after question leaped from my lips. He did not  answer them; he could not; but when I grew feverish and insistent, he drew the  morning paper from behind his back, and laid it quietly down within my reach. I  felt calmed in an instant, and when, after a few affectionate words, he left me  to myself, I seized on the sheet and read what so many others were reading at  that moment throughout the city. </p>
  <p>I  spare you the account so far as it coincides with what I had myself seen and  heard the night before. A few particulars which had not reached my ears will  interest you. The instrument of death found in the place designated by Mr.  Durand was one of note to such as had any taste or knowledge of curios. It was  a stiletto of the most delicate type, long, keen and slender. Not an American  product, not even of this century&rsquo;s manufacture, but a relic of the days when  deadly thrusts were given in the corners and by-ways of medieval streets. </p>
  <p>This  made the first mystery. </p>
  <p>The  second was the as yet unexplainable presence, on the alcove floor, of two  broken coffee-cups, which no waiter nor any other person, in fact, admitted  having carried there. The tray, which had fallen from Peter Mooney&rsquo;s hand,&mdash;the  waiter who had been the first to give the alarm of murder,&mdash;had held no cups,  only ices. This was a fact, proved. But the handles of two cups had been found  among the debris,&mdash;cups which must have been full, from the size of the coffee  stain left on the rug where they had fallen. </p>
  <p>In  reading this I remembered that Mr. Durand had mentioned stepping on some broken  pieces of china in his escape from the fatal scene, and, struck with this  confirmation of a theory which was slowly taking form in my own mind, I passed  on to the next paragraph, with a sense of expectation. </p>
  <p>The  result was a surprise. Others may have been told, I was not, that Mrs.  Fairbrother had received a communication from outside only a few minutes  previous to her death. A Mr. Fullerton, who had preceded Mr. Durand in his  visit to the alcove, owned to having opened the window for her at some call or  signal from outside, and taken in a small piece of paper which he saw lifted up  from below on the end of a whip handle. He could not see who held the whip, but  at Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s entreaty he unpinned the note and gave it to her. While  she was puzzling over it, for it was apparently far from legible, he took  another look out in time to mark a figure rush from below toward the carriage  drive. He did not recognize the figure nor would he know it again. As to the  nature of the communication itself he could say nothing, save that Mrs.  Fairbrother did not seem to be affected favorably by it. She frowned and was  looking very gloomy when he left the alcove. Asked if he had pulled the  curtains together after closing the window, he said that he had not; that she  had not requested him to do so. </p>
  <p>This  story, which was certainly a strange one, had been confirmed by the testimony  of the coachman who had lent his whip for the purpose. This coachman, who was  known to be a man of extreme good nature, had seen no harm in lending his whip  to a poor devil who wished to give a telegram or some such hasty message to the  lady sitting just above them in a lighted window. The wind was fierce and the  snow blinding, and it was natural that the man should duck his head, but he  remembered his appearance well enough to say that he was either very cold or  very much done up and that he wore a greatcoat with the collar pulled up about  his ears. When he came back with the whip he seemed more cheerful than when he  asked for it, but had no &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for the favor done him, or if he had, it  was lost in his throat and the piercing gale. </p>
  <p>The  communication, which was regarded by the police as a matter of the highest  importance, had been found in her hand by the coroner. It was a mere scrawl  written in pencil on a small scrap of paper. The following facsimile of the  scrawl was given to the public in the hope that some one would recognize the  handwriting. </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700581h-images/page096.png" width="800" height="272"></p>
  <p>The  first two lines overlapped and were confused, but the last one was clear  enough. <i>Expect trouble if</i>&mdash;If what? Hundreds were asking the question and at  this very moment. I should soon be asking it, too, but first, I must make an  effort to understand the situation,&mdash;a situation which up to now appeared to involve  Mr. Durand, and Mr. Durand only, as the suspected party. </p>
  <p>This  was no more than I expected, yet it came with a shock under the broad glare of  this wintry morning; so impossible did it seem in the light of every-day life  that guilt could be associated in any one&rsquo;s mind with a man of such unblemished  record and excellent standing. But the evidence adduced against him was of a  kind to appeal to the common mind&mdash;we all know that evidence&mdash;nor could I say,  after reading the full account, that I was myself unaffected by its seeming  weight. Not that my faith in his innocence was shaken. I had met his look of  love and tender gratitude and my confidence in him had been restored, but I  saw, with all the clearness of a mind trained by continuous study, how difficult  it was going to be to counteract the prejudice induced, first, by his own  inconsiderate acts, especially by that unfortunate attempt of his to secrete  Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s gloves in another woman&rsquo;s bag, and secondly, by his peculiar  explanations&mdash;explanations which to many must seem forced and unnatural. </p>
  <p>I  saw and felt nerved to a superhuman task. I believed him innocent, and if  others failed to prove him so, I would undertake to clear him myself,&mdash;I, the  little Rita, with no experience of law or courts or crime, but with simply an  unbounded faith in the man suspected and in the keenness of my own insight,&mdash;an  insight which had already served me so well and would serve me yet better, once  I had mastered the details which must be the prelude to all intelligent action. </p>
  <p>The  morning&rsquo;s report stopped with the explanations given by Mr. Durand of the  appearances against him. Consequently no word appeared of the after events  which had made such an impression at the time on all the persons present. Mr.  Grey was mentioned, but simply as one of the guests, and to no one reading this  early morning issue would any doubt come as to the genuineness of the diamond  which, to all appearance, had been the leading motive in the commission of this  great crime. </p>
  <p>The  effect on my own mind of this suppression was a curious one. I began to wonder  if the whole event had not been a chimera of my disturbed brain&mdash;a nightmare  which had visited me, and me alone, and not a fact to be reckoned with. But a  moment&rsquo;s further thought served to clear my mind of all such doubts, and I  perceived that the police had only exercised common prudence in withholding Mr.  Grey&rsquo;s sensational opinion of the stone till it could be verified by experts. </p>
  <p>The  two columns of gossip devoted to the family differences which had led to the  separation of Mr. and Mrs. Fairbrother, I shall compress into a few lines. They  had been married three years before in the city of Baltimore. He was a rich man  then, but not the multimillionaire he is to-day. Plain-featured and without manner,  he was no mate for this sparkling coquette, whose charm was of the kind which  grows with exercise. Though no actual scandal was ever associated with her  name, he grew tired of her caprices, and the conquests which she made no  endeavor to hide either from him or from the world at large; and at some time  during the previous year they had come to a friendly understanding which led to  their living apart, each in grand style and with a certain deference to the  proprieties which retained them their friends and an enviable place in society.  He was not often invited where she was, and she never appeared in any  assemblage where he was expected; but with this exception, little feeling was  shown; matters progressed smoothly, and to their credit, let it be said, no one  ever heard either of them speak otherwise than considerately of the other. He  was at present out or town, having started some three weeks before for the  southwest, but would probably return on receipt of the telegram which had been  sent him. </p>
  <p>The  comments made on the murder were necessarily hurried. It was called a mystery,  but it was evident enough that Mr. Durand&rsquo;s detention was looked on as the  almost certain prelude to his arrest on the charge of murder. </p>
  <p>I  had had some discipline in life. Although a favorite of my wealthy uncle, I had  given up very early the prospects he held out to me of a continued enjoyment of  his bounty, and entered on duties which required self-denial and hard work. I  did this because I enjoy having both my mind and heart occupied. To be  necessary to some one, as a nurse is to a patient, seemed to me an enviable  fate till I came under the influence of Anson Durand. Then the craving of all  women for the common lot of their sex became my craving also; a craving,  however, to which I failed at first to yield, for I felt that it was unshared,  and thus a token of weakness. Fighting my battle, I succeeded in winning it, as  I thought, just as the nurse&rsquo;s diploma was put in my hands. Then came the great  surprise of my life. Anson Durand expressed his love for me and I awoke to the  fact that all my preparation had been for home joys and a woman&rsquo;s true  existence. One hour of ecstasy in the light of this new hope, then tragedy and  something approaching chaos! Truly I had been through a schooling. But was it  one to make me useful in the only way I could be useful now? I did not know; I  did not care; I was determined on my course, fit or unfit, and, in the relief  brought by this appeal to my energy, I rose and dressed and went about the duties  of the day. </p>
  <p>One  of these was to determine whether Mr. Grey, on his return to his hotel, had  found his daughter as ill as his fears had foreboded. A telephone message or  two satisfied me on this point. Miss Grey was very ill, but not considered  dangerously so; indeed, if anything, her condition was improved, and if nothing  happened in the way of fresh complications, the prospects were that she would  be out in a fortnight. </p>
  <p>I  was not surprised. It was more than I had expected. The cry of the banshee in  an American house was past belief, even in an atmosphere surcharged with fear  and all the horror surrounding a great crime; and in the secret reckoning I was  making against a person I will not even name at this juncture, I added it as  another suspicious circumstance. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_6"></a>Chapter 6 <br>
Suspense</b></h2>
  <p>To  relate the full experiences of the next few days would be to encumber my  narrative with unnecessary detail. </p>
  <p>I  did not see Mr. Durand again. My uncle, so amenable in most matters, proved  inexorable on this point. Till Mr. Durand&rsquo;s good name should be restored by the  coroner&rsquo;s verdict, or such evidence brought to light as should effectually  place him beyond all suspicion, I was to hold no communication with him of any  sort whatever. I remember the very words with which my uncle ended the one  exhaustive conversation we had on the subject. They were these: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have fully expressed to Mr. Durand your entire confidence in his innocence.  That must suffice him for the present. If he is the honest gentleman you think  him, it will.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>As  uncle seldom asserted himself, and as he is very much in earnest when he does,  I made no attempt to combat this resolution, especially as it met the approval  of my better judgment. But though my power to convey sympathy fell thus under a  yoke, my thoughts and feelings remained free, and these were all consecrated to  the man struggling under an imputation, the disgrace and humiliation of which  he was but poorly prepared, by his former easy life of social and business  prosperity, to meet. </p>
  <p>For  Mr. Durand, in spite of the few facts which came up from time to time in  confirmation of his story, continued to be almost universally regarded as a  suspect. </p>
  <p>This  seemed to me very unjust. What if no other clue offered&mdash;no other clue, I mean,  recognized as such by police or public! Was he not to have the benefit of  whatever threw a doubt on his own culpability? For instance, that splash of  blood on his shirt-front, which I had seen, and the shape of which I knew! Why  did not the fact that it was a splash and not a spatter (and spatter it would  have been had it spurted there, instead of falling from above, as he stated),  count for more in the minds of those whose business it was to probe into the  very heart of this crime? To me, it told such a tale of innocence that I  wondered how a man like the inspector could pass over it. But later I  understood. A single word enlightened me. The stain, it was true, was in the  form of a splash and not a spurt, but a splash would have been the result of a  drop falling from the reeking end of the stiletto, whether it dislodged itself  early or late. And what was there to prove that this drop had not fallen at the  instant the stiletto was being thrust into the lantern, instead of after the  escape of the criminal, and the entrance of another man? </p>
  <p>But  the mystery of the broken coffee-cups! For that no explanation seemed to be  forthcoming. </p>
  <p>And  the still unsolved one of the written warning found in the murdered woman&rsquo;s  hand&mdash;a warning which had been deciphered to read: &ldquo;<i>Be warned! He means to be at  the ball! Expect trouble if</i>&mdash;&rdquo; Was that to be looked upon as directed against a  man who, from the nature of his projected attempt, would take no one into his  confidence? </p>
  <p>Then  the stiletto&mdash;a photographic reproduction of which was in all the papers&mdash;was  that the kind of instrument which a plain New York gentleman would be likely to  use in a crime of this nature? It was a marked and unique article, capable, as  one would think, of being easily traced to its owner. Had it been claimed by  Mr. Ramsdell, had it been recognized as one of the many works of art scattered  about the highly-decorated alcove, its employment as a means of death would  have gone only to prove the possibly unpremeditated nature of the crime, and so  been valueless as the basis of an argument in favor of Mr. Durand&rsquo;s innocence.  But Mr. Ramsdell had disclaimed from the first all knowledge of it,  consequently one could but feel justified in asking whether a man of Mr.  Durand&rsquo;s judgment would choose such an extraordinary weapon in meditating so  startling a crime&mdash;a crime which from its nature and circumstance could not fail to  attract the attention of the whole civilized world. </p>
  <p>Another  argument, advanced by himself and subscribed to by all his friends, was this:  That a dealer in precious stones would be the last man to seek by any unlawful  means to possess so conspicuous a jewel. For he, better than any one else,  would know the impossibility of disposing of a gem of this distinction in any  market short of the Orient. To which the unanswerable reply was made that no  one attributed to him any such folly; that if he had planned to possess himself  of this great diamond, it was for the purpose of eliminating it from  competition with the one he had procured for Mr. Smythe; an argument,  certainly, which drove us back on the only plea we had at our command&mdash;his  hitherto unblemished reputation and the confidence which was felt in him by  those who knew him. </p>
  <p>But  the one circumstance which affected me most at the time, and which undoubtedly  was the source of the greatest confusion to all minds, whether official or  otherwise, was the unexpected confirmation by experts of Mr. Grey&rsquo;s opinion in  regard to the diamond. His name was not used, indeed it had been kept out of  the papers with the greatest unanimity, but the hint he had given the inspector  at Mr. Ramsdell&rsquo;s ball had been acted upon and, the proper tests having been  made, the stone, for which so many believed a life to have been risked and  another taken, was declared to be an imitation, fine and successful beyond all  parallel, but still an imitation, of the great and renowned gem which had  passed through Tiffany&rsquo;s hands a twelve-month before: a decision which fell  like a thunderbolt on all such as had seen the diamond blazing in  unapproachable brilliancy on the breast of the unhappy Mrs. Fairbrother only an  hour or two before her death. </p>
  <p>On  me the effect was such that for days I lived in a dream, a condition that,  nevertheless, did not prevent me from starting a certain little inquiry of my  own, of which more hereafter. </p>
  <p>Here  let me say that I did not share the general confusion on this topic. I had my  own theory, both as to the cause of this substitution and the moment when it  was made. But the time had not yet come for me to advance it. I could only  stand back and listen to the suppositions aired by the press, suppositions  which fomented so much private discussion that ere long the one question most  frequently heard in this connection was not who struck the blow which killed  Mrs. Fairbrother (this was a question which some seemed to think settled), but  whose juggling hand had palmed off the paste for the diamond, and how and when  and where had the jugglery taken place? </p>
  <p>Opinions  on this point were, as I have said, many and various. Some fixed upon the  moment of exchange as that very critical and hardly appreciable one elapsing  between the murder and Mr. Durand&rsquo;s appearance upon the scene. This theory, I  need not say, was advanced by such as believed that while he was not guilty of  Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s murder, he had been guilty of taking advantage of the same  to rob the body of what, in the terror and excitement of the moment, he  evidently took to be her great gem. To others, among whom were many  eyewitnesses of the event, it appeared to be a conceded fact that this substitution  had been made prior to the ball and with Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s full cognizance.  The effectual way in which she had wielded her fan between the glittering  ornament on her breast and the inquisitive glances constantly leveled upon it  might at the time have been due to coquetry, but to them it looked much more  like an expression of fear lest the deception in which she was indulging should  be discovered. No one fixed the time where I did; but then, no one but myself  had watched the scene with the eyes of love; besides, and this must be  remembered, most people, among whom I ventured to count the police officials,  were mainly interested in proving Mr. Durand guilty, while I, with contrary  mind, was bent on establishing such facts as confirmed the explanations he had  been pleased to give us, explanations which necessitated a conviction, on Mrs.  Fairbrother&rsquo;s part, of the great value of the jewel she wore, and the  consequent advisability of ridding herself of it temporarily, if, as so many  believed, the full letter of the warning should read: &ldquo;Be warned, he means to  be at the ball. Expect trouble if you are found wearing the great diamond.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>True,  she may herself have been deceived concerning it. Unconsciously to herself, she  may have been the victim of a daring fraud on the part of some hanger-on who  had access to her jewels, but, as no such evidence had yet come to life, as she  had no recognized, or, so far as could be learned, secret lover or dishonest  dependent; and, moreover, as no gem of such unusual value was known to have  been offered within the year, here or abroad, in public or private market, I  could not bring myself to credit this assumption; possibly because I was so  ignorant as to credit another, and a different one,&mdash;one which you have already  seen growing in my mind, and which, presumptuous as it was, kept my courage  from failing through all those dreadful days of enforced waiting and suspense.  For I was determined not to intrude my suggestions, valuable as I considered  them, till all hope was gone of his being righted by the judgment of those who  would not lightly endure the interference of such an insignificant mote in the  great scheme of justice as myself. </p>
  <p>The  inquest, which might be trusted to bring out all these doubtful points, had  been delayed in anticipation of Mr. Fairbrother&rsquo;s return. His testimony could  not but prove valuable, if not in fixing the criminal, at least in settling the  moot point as to whether the stone, which the estranged wife had carried away  with her on leaving the house, had been the genuine one returned to him from  Tiffany&rsquo;s or the well-known imitation now in the hands of the police. He had  been located somewhere in the mountains of lower Colorado, but, strange to say,  it had been found impossible to enter into direct communication with him; nor  was it known whether he was aware as yet of his wife&rsquo;s tragic death. So affairs  went slowly in New York and the case seemed to come to a standstill, when  public opinion was suddenly reawakened and a more definite turn given to the whole  matter by a despatch from Santa Fe to the Associated Press. This despatch was  to the effect that Abner Fairbrother had passed through that city some three  days before on his way to his new mining camp, the Placide; that he then showed  symptoms of pneumonia, and from advices since received might be regarded as a  very sick man. </p>
  <p>Ill,&mdash;well,  that explained matters. His silence, which many had taken for indifference, was  that of a man physically disabled and unfit for exertion of any kind. Ill,&mdash;a  tragic circumstance which roused endless conjecture. Was he aware, or was he  not aware, of his wife&rsquo;s death? Had he been taken ill before or after he left  Colorado for New Mexico? Was he suffering mainly from shock, or, as would  appear from his complaint, from a too rapid change of climate? </p>
  <p>The  whole country seethed with excitement, and my poor little unthought-of,  insignificant self burned with impatience, which only those who have been  subjected to a like suspense can properly estimate. Would the proceedings which  were awaited with so much anxiety be further delayed? Would Mr. Durand remain  indefinitely in durance and under such a cloud of disgrace as would kill some  men and might kill him? Should I be called upon to endure still longer the  suffering which this entailed upon me, when I thought I knew&mdash; </p>
  <p>But  fortune was less obdurate than I feared. Next morning a telegraphic statement  from Santa Fe settled one of the points of this great dispute, a statement  which you will find detailed at more length in the following communication,  which appeared a few days later in one of our most enterprising journals. </p>
  <p>It  was from a resident correspondent in New Mexico, and was written, as the editor  was careful to say, for his own eyes and not for the public. He had ventured,  however, to give it in full, knowing the great interest which this whole  subject had for his readers. </p>

Night And A Voice</b></h2>
  <p>Not  to be outdone by the editor, I insert the article here with all its details,  the importance of which I trust I have anticipated. </p>
  <p>SANTA  FE, N.M., April&mdash;. </p>
  <p>Arrived  in Santa Fe, I inquired where Abner Fairbrother could be found. I was told that  he was at his mine, sick. </p>
  <p>Upon  inquiring as to the location of the Placide, I was informed that it was fifteen  miles or so distant in the mountains, and upon my expressing an intention of  going there immediately, I was given what I thought very unnecessary advice and  then directed to a certain livery stable, where I was told I could get the  right kind of a horse and such equipment as I stood in need of. </p>
  <p>I  thought I was equipped all right as it was, but I said nothing and went on to  the livery stable. Here I was shown a horse which I took to at once and was  about to mount, when a pair of leggings was brought to me. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will need these for your journey,&rdquo; said the man. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Journey!&rdquo;  I repeated. &ldquo;Fifteen miles!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  livery stable keeper&mdash;a half-breed with a peculiarly pleasant smile&mdash;cocked up  his shoulders with the remark: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  men as willing but as inexperienced as yourself have attempted the same journey  during the last week and they all came back before they reached the divide. You  will probably come back, too; but I shall give you as fair a start as if I knew  you were going straight through.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  a woman has done it,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;a nurse from the hospital went up that very road  last week.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  women! they can do anything&mdash;women who are nurses. But they don&rsquo;t start off  alone. You are going alone.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I remarked grimly. &ldquo;Newspaper correspondents make their journeys singly when  they can.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  you are a newspaper correspondent! Why do so many men from the papers want to  see that sick old man? Because he&rsquo;s so rich?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you know?&rdquo; I asked. </p>
  <p>He  did not seem to. </p>
  <p>I  wondered at his ignorance but did not enlighten him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Follow  the trail and ask your way from time to time. All the goatherds know where the  Placide mine is.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Such  were his simple instructions as he headed my horse toward the canyon. But as I  drew off, he shouted out: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you get stuck, leave it to the horse. He knows more about it than you do.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>With  a vague gesture toward the northwest, he turned away, leaving me in  contemplation of the grandest scenery I had yet come upon in all my travels. </p>
  <p>Fifteen  miles! but those miles lay through the very heart of the mountains, ranging  anywhere from six to seven thousand feet high. In ten minutes the city and all  signs of city life were out of sight. In five more I was seemingly as far  removed from all civilization as if I had gone a hundred miles into the  wilderness. </p>
  <p>As  my horse settled down to work, picking his way, now here and now there,  sometimes over the brown earth, hard and baked as in a thousand furnaces, and  sometimes over the stunted grass whose needle-like stalks seemed never to have  known moisture, I let my eyes roam to such peaks as were not cut off from view  by the nearer hillsides, and wondered whether the snow which capped them was  whiter than any other or the blue of the sky bluer, that the two together had  the effect upon me of cameo work on a huge and unapproachable scale. </p>
  <p>Certainly  the effect of these grand mountains, into which you leap without any  preparation from the streets and market-places of America&rsquo;s oldest city, is  such as is not easily described. </p>
  <p>We  struck water now and then,&mdash;narrow water-courses which my horse followed in mid  stream, and, more interesting yet, goatherds with their flocks, Mexicans all,  who seemed to understand no English, but were picturesque enough to look at and  a welcome break in the extreme lonesomeness of the way. </p>
  <p>I  had been told that they would serve me as guides if I felt at all doubtful of  the trail, and in one or two instances they proved to be of decided help. They  could gesticulate, if they could not speak English, and when I tried them with  the one word Placide they would nod and point out which of the many side  canyons I was to follow. But they always looked up as they did so, up, up, till  I took to looking up, too, and when, after miles multiplied indefinitely by the  winding of the trail, I came out upon a ledge from which a full view of the  opposite range could be had, and saw fronting me, from the side of one of its  tremendous peaks, the gap of a vast hole not two hundred feet from the  snowline, I knew that, inaccessible as it looked, I was gazing up at the  opening of Abner Fairbrother&rsquo;s new mine, the Placide. </p>
  <p>The  experience was a strange one. The two ranges approached so nearly that it  seemed as if a ball might be tossed from one to the other. But the chasm  between was stupendous. I grew dizzy as I looked downward and saw the endless  zigzags yet to be traversed step by step before the bottom of the canyon could  be reached, and then the equally interminable zigzags up the acclivity beyond,  all of which I must trace, still step by step, before I could hope to arrive at  the camp which, from where I stood, looked to be almost within hail of my  voice. </p>
  <p>I  have described the mine as a hole. That was all I saw at first&mdash;a great black  hole in the dark brown earth of the mountain-side, from which ran down a still  darker streak into the waste places far below it. But as I looked longer I saw  that it was faced by a ledge cut out of the friable soil, on which I was now  able to descry the pronounced white of two or three tent-tops and some other  signs of life, encouraging enough to the eye of one whose lot it was to crawl  like a fly up that tremendous mountain-side. </p>
  <p>Truly  I could understand why those three men, probably newspaper correspondents like  myself, had turned back to Santa Fe, after a glance from my present outlook.  But though I understood I did not mean to duplicate their retreat. </p>
  <p>The  sight of those tents, the thought of what one of them contained, inspired me  with new courage, and, releasing my grip upon the rein, I allowed my patient  horse to proceed. Shortly after this I passed the divide&mdash;that is where the  water sheds both ways&mdash;then the descent began. It was zigzag, just as the climb  had been, but I preferred the climb. I did not have the unfathomable spaces so  constantly before me, nor was my imagination so active. It was fixed on heights  to be attained rather than on valleys to roll into. However, I did not roll. </p>
  <p>The  Mexican saddle held me securely at whatever angle I was poised, and once the  bottom was reached I found that I could face, with considerable equanimity, the  corresponding ascent. Only, as I saw how steep the climb bade fair to be, I did  not see how I was ever to come down again. Going up was possible, but the  descent&mdash; </p>
  <p>However,  as what goes up must in the course of nature come down, I put this question  aside and gave my horse his head, after encouraging him with a few blades of  grass, which he seemed to find edible enough, though they had the look and  something of the feel of spun glass. </p>
  <p>How  we got there you must ask this good animal, who took all the responsibility and  did all the work. I merely clung and balanced, and at times, when he rounded  the end of a zigzag, for instance, I even shut my eyes, though the prospect was  magnificent. At last even his patience seemed to give out, and he stopped and  trembled. But before I could open my eyes on the abyss beneath he made another  effort. I felt the brush of tree branches across my face, and, looking up, saw  before me the ledge or platform dotted with tents, at which I had looked with  such longing from the opposite hillsides. </p>
  <p>Simultaneously  I heard voices, and saw approaching a bronzed and bearded man with  strongly-marked Scotch features and a determined air. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  doctor!&rdquo; I involuntarily exclaimed, with a glance at the small and curious tent  before which he stood guard. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the doctor,&rdquo; he answered in unexpectedly good English. &ldquo;And who are you? Have  you brought the mail and those medicines I sent for?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I replied with as propitiatory a smile as I could muster up in face of his  brusk forbidding expression. &ldquo;I came on my own errand. I am a representative of  the New York&mdash;and I hope you will not deny me a word with Mr. Fairbrother.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>With  a gesture I hardly knew how to interpret he took my horse by the rein and led  us on a few steps toward another large tent, where he motioned me to descend.  Then he laid his hand on my shoulder and, forcing me to meet his eye, said: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have made this journey&mdash;I believe you said from New York&mdash;to see Mr. Fairbrother.  Why?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Mr. Fairbrother is at present the most sought-for man in America,&rdquo; I returned  boldly. &ldquo;His wife&mdash;you know about his wife&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  How should I know about his wife? I know what his temperature is and what his  respiration is&mdash;but his wife? What about his wife? He don&rsquo;t know anything about  her now himself; he is not allowed to read letters.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you read the papers. You must have known, before you left Santa Fe, of Mrs.  Fairbrother&rsquo;s foul and most mysterious murder in New York. It has been the  theme of two continents for the last ten days.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  shrugged his shoulders, which might mean anything, and confined his reply to a  repetition of my own words. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Fairbrother murdered!&rdquo; he exclaimed, but in a suppressed voice, to which point  was given by the cautious look he cast behind him at the tent which had drawn  my attention. &ldquo;He must not know it, man. I could not answer for his life if he  received the least shock in his present critical condition. Murdered? When?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten  days ago, at a ball in New York. It was after Mr. Fairbrother left the city. He  was expected to return, after hearing the news, but he seems to have kept  straight on to his destination. He was not very fond of his wife,&mdash;that is, they  have not been living together for the last year. But he could not help feeling  the shock of her death which he must have heard of somewhere along the route.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has said nothing in his delirium to show that he knew it. It is possible, just  possible, that he didn&rsquo;t read the papers. He could not have been well for days  before he reached Santa Fe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  were you called in to attend him?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  very night after he reached this place. It was thought he wouldn&rsquo;t live to  reach the camp. But he is a man of great pluck. He held up till his foot  touched this platform. Then he succumbed.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he was as sick as that,&rdquo; I muttered, &ldquo;why did he leave Santa Fe? He must have  known what it would mean to be sick here.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think he did. This is his first visit to the mine. He evidently knew  nothing of the difficulties of the road. But he would not stop. He was  determined to reach the camp, even after he had been given a sight of it from  the opposite mountain. He told them that he had once crossed the Sierras in  midwinter. But he wasn&rsquo;t a sick man then.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor,  they don&rsquo;t know who killed his wife.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, but under such circumstances every fact bearing on the event is of  immense importance. There is one which Mr. Fairbrother only can make clear. It  can be said in a word&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  grim doctor&rsquo;s eye flashed angrily and I stopped. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  you a detective from the district attorney&rsquo;s office in New York, sent on with  special powers to examine him, I should still say what I am going to say now.  While Mr. Fairbrother&rsquo;s temperature and pulse remain where they now are, no one  shall see him and no one shall talk to him save myself and his nurse.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  turned with a sick look of disappointment toward the road up which I had so  lately come. &ldquo;Have I panted, sweltered, trembled, for three mortal hours on the  worst trail a man ever traversed to go back with nothing for my journey? That  seems to me hard lines. Where is the manager of this mine?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  doctor pointed toward a man bending over the edge of the great hole from which,  at that moment, a line of Mexicans was issuing, each with a sack on his back  which he flung down before what looked like a furnace built of clay. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  he. Mr. Haines, of Philadelphia. What do you want of him?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Permission  to stay the night. Mr. Fairbrother may be better to-morrow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t allow it and I am master here, so far as my patient is concerned. You  couldn&rsquo;t stay here without talking, and talking makes excitement, and  excitement is just what he can not stand. A week from now I will see about  it&mdash;that is, if my patient continues to improve. I am not sure that he will.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me spend that week here. I&rsquo;ll not talk any more than the dead. Maybe the  manager will let me carry sacks.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here,&rdquo; said the doctor, edging me farther and farther away from the tent he  hardly let out of his sight for a moment. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a canny lad, and shall have  your bite and something to drink before you take your way back. But back you go  before sunset and with this message: No man from any paper north or south will  be received here till I hang out a blue flag. I say blue, for that is the color  of my bandana. When my patient is in a condition to discuss <i>murder</i> I&rsquo;ll hoist  it from his tent-top. It can be seen from the divide, and if you want to camp  there on the lookout, well and good. As for the police, that&rsquo;s another matter.  I will see them if they come, but they need not expect to talk to my patient.  You may say so down there. It will save scrambling up this trail to no  purpose.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may count on me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;trust a New York correspondent to do the right thing  at the right time to head off the boys. But I doubt if they will believe me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I shall have a barricade thrown up fifty feet down the  mountain-side,&rdquo; said he. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the mail and your supplies?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the burros can make their way up. We shan&rsquo;t suffer.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are certainly master,&rdquo; I remarked. </p>
  <p>All  this time I had been using my eyes. There was not much to see, but what there  was was romantically interesting. Aside from the furnace and what was going on  there, there was little else but a sleeping-tent, a cooking-tent, and the small  one I had come on first, which, without the least doubt, contained the sick  man. This last tent was of a peculiar construction and showed the primitive  nature of everything at this height. It consisted simply of a cloth thrown over  a thing like a trapeze. This cloth did not even come to the ground on either  side, but stopped short a foot or so from the flat mound of adobe which serves  as a base or floor for hut or tent in New Mexico. The rear of the simple tent  abutted on the mountain-side; the opening was toward the valley. I felt an  intense desire to look into this opening,&mdash;so intense that I thought I would  venture on an attempt to gratify it. Scrutinizing the resolute face of the man  before me and flattering myself that I detected signs of humor underlying his  professional bruskness, I asked, somewhat mournfully, if he would let me go  away without so much as a glance at the man I had come so far to see. A glimpse  would satisfy me I assured him, as the hint of a twinkle flashed in his eye.  &ldquo;Surely there will be no harm in that. I&rsquo;ll take it instead of supper.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  smiled, but not encouragingly, and I was feeling very despondent, indeed, when  the canvas on which our eyes were fixed suddenly shook and the calm figure of a  woman stepped out before us, clad in the simplest garb, but showing in every  line of face and form a character of mingled kindness and shrewdness. She was  evidently on the lookout for the doctor, for she made a sign as she saw him and  returned instantly into the tent. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Fairbrother has just fallen asleep,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t discipline and I  shall have to apologize to Miss Serra, but if you will promise not to speak nor  make the least disturbance I will let you take the one peep you prefer to  supper.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  promise,&rdquo; said I. </p>
  <p>Leading  the way to the opening, he whispered a word to the nurse, then motioned me to  look in. The sight was a simple one, but to me very impressive. The owner of  palaces, a man to whom millions were as thousands to such poor devils as  myself, lay on an improvised bed of evergreens, wrapped in a horse blanket and  with nothing better than another of these rolled up under his head. At his side  sat his nurse on what looked like the uneven stump of a tree. Close to her hand  was a tolerably flat stone, on which I saw arranged a number of bottles and  such other comforts as were absolutely necessary to a proper care of the  sufferer. </p>
  <p>That  was all. In these few words I have told the whole story. To be sure, this  simple tent, perched seven thousand feet and more above sea-level, had one  advantage which even his great house in New York could not offer This was the  out look. Lying as he did facing the valley, he had only to open his eyes to  catch a full view of the panorama of sky and mountain stretched out before him.  It was glorious; whether seen at morning, noon or night, glorious. But I doubt  if he would not gladly have exchanged it for a sight of his home walls. </p>
  <p>As  I started to go, a stir took place in the blanket wrapped about his chin, and I  caught a glimpse of the iron-gray head and hollow cheeks of the great  financier. He was a very sick man. Even I could see that. Had I obtained the  permission I sought and been allowed to ask him one of the many questions  burning on my tongue, I should have received only delirium for reply. There was  no reaching that clouded intelligence now, and I felt grateful to the doctor  for convincing me of it. </p>
  <p>I  told him so and thanked him quite warmly when we were well away from the tent,  and his answer was almost kindly, though he made no effort to hide his  impatience and anxiety to see me go. The looks he cast at the sun were  significant, and, having no wish to antagonize him and every wish to visit the  spot again, I moved toward my horse with the intention of untying him. </p>
  <p>To  my surprise the doctor held me back. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t go to-night,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your horse has hurt himself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was true. There was something the matter with the animal&rsquo;s left forefoot. As  the doctor lifted it, the manager came up. He agreed with the doctor. I could  not make the descent to Santa Fe on that horse that night. Did I feel elated?  Rather. I had no wish to descend. Yet I was far from foreseeing what the night  was to bring me. </p>
  <p>I  was turned over to the manager, but not without a final injunction from the  doctor. &ldquo;Not a word to any one about your errand! Not a word about the New York  tragedy, as you value Mr. Fairbrother&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a word,&rdquo; said I. </p>
  <p>Then  he left me. </p>
  <p>To  see the sun go down and the moon come up from a ledge hung, as it were, in mid  air! The experience was novel&mdash;but I refrain. I have more important matters to  relate. </p>
  <p>I  was given a bunk at the extreme end of the long sleeping-tent, and turned in  with the rest. I expected to sleep, but on finding that I could catch a sight  of the sick tent from under the canvas, I experienced such fascination in  watching this forbidden spot that midnight came before I had closed my eyes.  Then all desire to sleep left me, for the patient began to moan and presently  to talk, and, the stillness of the solitary height being something abnormal, I  could sometimes catch the very words. Devoid as they were of all rational  meaning, they excited my curiosity to the burning point; for who could tell if  he might not say something bearing on the mystery? </p>
  <p>But  that fevered mind had recurred to early scenes and the babble which came to my  ears was all of mining camps in the Rockies and the dicker of horses. Perhaps  the uneasy movement of my horse pulling at the end of his tether had disturbed  him. Perhaps&mdash; </p>
  <p>But  at the inner utterance of the second &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; I found myself up on my elbow  listening with all my ears, and staring with wide-stretched eyes at the thicket  of stunted trees where the road debouched on the platform. Something was astir  there besides my horse. I could catch sounds of an unmistakable nature. A rider  was coming up the trail. </p>
  <p>Slipping  back into my place, I turned toward the doctor, who lay some two or three bunks  nearer the opening. He had started up, too, and in a moment was out of the  tent. I do not think he had observed my action, for it was very dark where I  lay and his back had been turned toward me. As for the others, they slept like  the dead, only they made more noise. </p>
  <p>Interested&mdash;everything  is interesting at such a height&mdash;I brought my eye to bear on the ledge, and soon  saw by the limpid light of a full moon the stiff, short branches of the trees,  on which my gaze was fixed, give way to an advancing horse and rider. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo;  saluted the doctor in a whisper, which was in itself a warning. &ldquo;Easy there! We  have sickness in this camp and it&rsquo;s a late hour for visitors.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  answer was subdued, but earnest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  the magistrate of this district. I&rsquo;ve a question to ask this sick man, on  behalf of the New York Chief of Police, who is a personal friend of mine. It is  connected with&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  doctor had seized him by the arm and turned his face away from the sick tent.  Then the two heads came together and an argument began. </p>
  <p>I  could not hear a word of it, but their motions were eloquent. My sympathy was  with the magistrate, of course, and I watched eagerly while he passed a letter  over to the doctor, who vainly strove to read it by the light of the moon.  Finding this impossible, he was about to return it, when the other struck a  match and lit a lantern hanging from the horn of his saddle. The two heads came  together again, but as quickly separated with every appearance of  irreconcilement, and I was settling back with sensations of great  disappointment, when a sound fell on the night so unexpected to all concerned  that with a common impulse each eye sought the sick tent. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Water!  will some one give me water?&rdquo; a voice had cried, quietly and with none of the  delirium which had hitherto rendered it unnatural. </p>
  <p>The  doctor started for the tent. There was the quickness of surprise in his movement  and the gesture he made to the magistrate, as he passed in, reawakened an  expectation in my breast which made me doubly watchful. </p>
  <p>Providence  was intervening in our favor, and I was not surprised to see him presently  reissue with the nurse, whom he drew into the shadow of the trees, where they  had a short conference. If she returned alone into the tent after this  conference I should know that the matter was at an end and that the doctor had  decided to maintain his authority against that of the magistrate. But she  remained outside and the magistrate was invited to join their council; when  they again left the shadow of the trees it was to approach the tent. </p>
  <p>The  magistrate, who was in the rear, could not have more than passed the opening,  but I thought him far enough inside not to detect any movement on my part, so I  took advantage of the situation to worm myself out of my corner and across the  ledge to where the tent made a shadow in the moonlight. </p>
  <p>Crouching  close, and laying my ear against the canvas, I listened. </p>
  <p>The  nurse was speaking in a gently persuasive tone. I imagined her kneeling by the  head of the patient and breathing words into his ear. These were what I heard: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  love diamonds. I have often noticed that; you look so long at the ring on your  hand. That is why I have let it stay there, though at times I have feared it  would drop off and roll away over the adobe down the mountain-side. Was I  right?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes.&rdquo; The words came with difficulty, but they were clear enough. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s of  small value. I like it because&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  appeared to be too weak to finish. </p>
  <p>A  pause, during which she seemed to edge nearer to him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  all have some pet keepsake,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But I should never have supposed this  stone of yours an inexpensive one. But I forget that you are the owner of a  very large and remarkable diamond, a diamond that is spoken of sometimes in the  papers. Of course, if you have a gem like that, this one must appear very small  and valueless to you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  this is nothing, nothing.&rdquo; And he appeared to turn away his head. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Fairbrother! Pardon me, but I want to tell you something about that big diamond  of yours. You have been in and have not been able to read your letters, so do  not know that your wife has had some trouble with that diamond. People have  said that it is not a real stone, but a well-executed imitation. May I write to  her that this is a mistake, that it is all you have ever claimed for it&mdash;that  is, an unusually large diamond of the first water?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  listened in amazement. Surely, this was an insidious way to get at the truth,&mdash;a  woman&rsquo;s way, but who would say it was not a wise one, the wisest, perhaps,  which could be taken under the circumstances? What would his reply be? Would it  show that he was as ignorant of his wife&rsquo;s death as was generally believed,  both by those about him here and those who knew him well in New York? Or would  the question convey nothing further to him than the doubt&mdash;in itself an insult  of the genuineness of that great stone which had been his pride? </p>
  <p>A  murmur&mdash;that was all it could be called&mdash;broke from his fever-dried lips and died  away in an inarticulate gasp. Then, suddenly, sharply, a cry broke from him, an  intelligible cry, and we heard him say: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  imitation! no imitation! It was a sun! a glory! No other like it! It lit the  air! it blazed, it burned! I see it now! I see&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>There  the passion succumbed, the strength failed; another murmur, another, and the  great void of night which stretched over&mdash;I might almost say under us&mdash;was no  more quiet or seemingly impenetrable than the silence of that moon-enveloped  tent. </p>
  <p>Would  he speak again? I did not think so. Would she even try to make him? I did not  think this, either. But I did not know the woman. </p>
  <p>Softly  her voice rose again. There was a dominating insistence in her tones, gentle as  they were; the insistence of a healthy mind which seeks to control a weakened  one. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not know of any imitation, then? It was the real stone you gave her. You are  sure of it; you would be ready to swear to it if&mdash;say just yes or no,&rdquo; she finished  in gentle urgency. </p>
  <p>Evidently  he was sinking again into unconsciousness, and she was just holding him back  long enough for the necessary word. </p>
  <p>It  came slowly and with a dragging intonation, but there was no mistaking the ring  of truth with which he spoke. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said he. </p>
  <p>When  I heard the doctor&rsquo;s voice and felt a movement in the canvas against which I  leaned, I took the warning and stole back hurriedly to my quarters. </p>
  <p>I  was scarcely settled, when the same group of three I had before watched silhouetted  itself again against the moonlight. There was some talk, a mingling and  separating of shadows; then the nurse glided back to her duties and the two men  went toward the clump of trees where the horse had been tethered. </p>
  <p>Ten  minutes and the doctor was back in his bunk. Was it imagination, or did I feel  his hand on my shoulder before he finally lay down and composed himself to  sleep? I can not say; I only know that I gave no sign, and that soon all stir  ceased in his direction and I was left to enjoy my triumph and to listen with  anxious interest to the strange and unintelligible sounds which accompanied the  descent of the horseman down the face of the cliff, and finally to watch with a  fascination, which drew me to my knees, the passage of that sparkling star of  light hanging from his saddle. It crept to and fro across the side of the  opposite mountain as he threaded its endless zigzags and finally disappeared  over the brow into the invisible canyons beyond. </p>
  <p>With  the disappearance of this beacon came lassitude and sleep, through whose hazy  atmosphere floated wild sentences from the sick tent, which showed that the  patient was back again in Nevada, quarreling over the price of a horse which  was to carry him beyond the reach of some threatening avalanche. </p>
  <p>When  next morning I came to depart, the doctor took me by both hands and looked me  straight in the eyes. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard,&rdquo; he said. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo; I asked. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can tell a satisfied man when I see him,&rdquo; he growled, throwing down my hands  with that same humorous twinkle in his eyes which had encouraged me from the  first. </p>
  <p>I  made no answer, but I shall remember the lesson. </p>
  <p>One  detail more. When I started on my own descent I found why the leggings, with  which I had been provided, were so indispensable. I was not allowed to ride;  indeed, riding down those steep declivities was impossible. No horse could  preserve his balance with a rider on his back. I slid, so did my horse, and  only in the valley beneath did we come together again. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_8"></a>Chapter 8 <br>
Arrest</b></h2>
  <p>The  success of this interview provoked other attempts on the part of the reporters  who now flocked into the Southwest. Ere long particulars began to pour in of  Mr. Fairbrother&rsquo;s painful journey south, after his illness set in. The clerk of  the hotel in El Moro, where the great mine-owner&rsquo;s name was found registered at  the time of the murder, told a story which made very good reading for those who  were more interested in the sufferings and experiences of the millionaire  husband of the murdered lady than in those of the unhappy but comparatively  insignificant man upon whom public opinion had cast the odium of her death. </p>
  <p>It  seems that when the first news came of the great crime which had taken place in  New York, Mr. Fairbrother was absent from the hotel on a prospecting tour  through the adjacent mountains. Couriers had been sent after him, and it was  one of these who finally brought him into town. He had been found wandering  alone on horseback among the defiles of an untraveled region, sick and almost  incoherent from fever. Indeed, his condition was such that neither the courier  nor such others as saw him had the heart to tell him the dreadful news from New  York, or even to show him the papers. To their great relief, he betrayed no  curiosity in them. All he wanted was a berth in the first train going south,  and this was an easy way for them out of a great responsibility. They listened  to his wishes and saw him safely aboard, with such alacrity and with so many  precautions against his being disturbed that they have never doubted that he  left El Moro in total ignorance, not only of the circumstances of his great  bereavement, but of the bereavement itself. </p>
  <p>This  ignorance, which he appeared to have carried with him to the Placide, was  regarded by those who knew him best as proving the truth of the affirmation  elicited from him in the pauses of his delirium of the genuineness of the stone  which had passed from his hands to those of his wife at the time of their  separation; and, further despatches coming in, some private and some official,  but all insisting upon the fact that it would be weeks before he would be in a  condition to submit to any sort of examination on a subject so painful, the  authorities in New York decided to wait no longer for his testimony, but to  proceed at once with the inquest. </p>
  <p>Great  as is the temptation to give a detailed account of proceedings which were of  such moment to myself, and to every word of which I listened with the eagerness  of a novice and the anguish of a woman who sees her lover&rsquo;s reputation at the  mercy of a verdict which may stigmatize him as a possible criminal, I see no  reason for encumbering my narrative with what, for the most part, would be a  mere repetition of facts already known to you. </p>
  <p>Mr.  Durand&rsquo;s intimate and suggestive connection with this crime, the explanations  he had to give of this connection, frequently bizarre and, I must acknowledge,  not always convincing,&mdash;nothing could alter these nor change the fact of the  undoubted cowardice he displayed in hiding Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s gloves in my  unfortunate little bag. </p>
  <p>As  for the mystery of the warning, it remained as much of a mystery as ever. Nor  did any better success follow an attempt to fix the ownership of the stiletto,  though a half-day was exhausted in an endeavor to show that the latter might  have come into Mr. Durand&rsquo;s possession in some of the many visits he was shown  to have made of late to various curio-shops in and out of New York City.* </p>
  <p class="footnote">* Mr. Durand&rsquo;s visits to the curio-shops, as explained  by him, were made with a view of finding a casket in which to place his  diamond. This explanation was looked upon with as much doubt as the others he  had offered where the situation seemed to be of a compromising character.</p>
  <p>I  had expected all this, just as I had expected Mr. Grey to be absent from the  proceedings and his testimony ignored. But this expectation did not make the  ordeal any easier, and when I noticed the effect of witness after witness  leaving the stand without having improved Mr. Durand&rsquo;s position by a jot or  offering any new clue capable of turning suspicion into other directions, I  felt my spirit harden and my purpose strengthen till I hardly knew myself. I  must have frightened my uncle, for his hand was always on my arm and his  chiding voice in my ear, bidding me beware, not only for my own sake and his,  but for that of Mr. Durand, whose eye was seldom away from my face. </p>
  <p>The  verdict, however, was not the one I had so deeply dreaded. While it did not  exonerate Mr. Durand, it did not openly accuse him, and I was on the point of  giving him a smile of congratulation and renewed hope when I saw my little  detective&mdash;the one who had spied the gloves in my bag at the ball&mdash;advance and  place his hand upon his arm. </p>
  <p>The  police had gone a step further than the coroner&rsquo;s jury, and Mr. Durand was  arrested, before my eyes, on a charge of murder. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_9"></a>Chapter 9 <br>
The Mouse Nibbles At The Net</b></h2>
  <p>The  next day saw me at police headquarters begging an interview from the inspector,  with the intention of confiding to him a theory which must either cost me his  sympathy or open the way to a new inquiry, which I felt sure would lead to Mr.  Durand&rsquo;s complete exoneration. </p>
  <p>I  chose this gentleman for my confidant, from among all those with whom I had  been brought in contact by my position as witness in a case of this magnitude,  first, because he had been present at the most tragic moment of my life, and  secondly, because I was conscious of a sympathetic bond between us which would  insure me a kind hearing. However ridiculous my idea might appear to him, I was  assured that he would treat me with consideration and not visit whatever folly  I might be guilty of on the head of him for whom I risked my reputation for  good sense. </p>
  <p>Nor  was I disappointed in this. Inspector Dalzell&rsquo;s air was fatherly and his tone  altogether gentle as, in reply to my excuses for troubling him with my  opinions, he told me that in a case of such importance he was glad to receive  the impressions even of such a prejudiced little partizan as myself. The word  fired me, and I spoke. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  consider Mr. Durand guilty, and so do many others, I fear, in spite of his long  record for honesty and uprightness. And why? Because you will not admit the  possibility of another person&rsquo;s guilt,&mdash;a person standing so high in private and  public estimation that the very idea seems preposterous and little short of  insulting to the country of which he is an acknowledged ornament.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  inspector had actually risen. His expression and whole attitude showed shock.  But I did not quail; I only subdued my manner and spoke with quieter  conviction. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am aware,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how words so daring must impress you. But listen, sir;  listen to what I have to say before you utterly condemn me. I acknowledge that  it is the frightful position into which I threw Mr. Durand by my officious  attempt to right him which has driven me to make this second effort to fix the  crime on the only other man who had possible access to Mrs. Fairbrother at the  fatal moment. How could I live in inaction? How could you expect me to weigh  for a moment this foreigner&rsquo;s reputation against that of my own lover? If I  have reasons&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reasons!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;reasons  which would appeal to all; if instead of this person&rsquo;s having an international  reputation at his back he had been a simple gentleman like Mr. Durand,&mdash;would  you not consider me entitled to speak?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  but&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no confidence in my reasons, Inspector; they may not weigh against that  splash of blood on Mr. Durand&rsquo;s shirt-front, but such as they are I must give  them. But first, it will be necessary for you to accept for the nonce Mr.  Durand&rsquo;s statements as true. Are you willing to do this?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will try.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  a harder thing yet,&mdash;to put some confidence in my judgment. I saw the man and  did not like him long before any intimation of the evening&rsquo;s tragedy had turned  suspicion on any one. I watched him as I watched others. I saw that he had not  come to the ball to please Mr. Ramsdell or for any pleasure he himself hoped to  reap from social intercourse, but for some purpose much more important, and  that this purpose was connected with Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s diamond. Indifferent,  almost morose before she came upon the scene, he brightened to a surprising  extent the moment he found himself in her presence. Not because she was a  beautiful woman, for he scarcely honored her face or even her superb figure  with a look. All his glances were centered on her large fan, which, in swaying  to and fro, alternately hid and revealed the splendor on her breast; and when  by chance it hung suspended for a moment in her forgetful hand and he caught a  full glimpse of the great gem, I perceived such a change in his face that, if  nothing more had occurred that night to give prominence to this woman and her  diamond, I should have carried home the conviction that interests of no common  import lay behind a feeling so extraordinarily displayed.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fanciful,  my dear Miss Van Arsdale! Interesting, but fanciful.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. I have not yet touched on fact. But facts are coming, Inspector.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  stared. Evidently he was not accustomed to hear the law laid down in this  fashion by a midget of my proportions. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;happily, I have no clerk here to listen.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would not speak if you had. These are words for but one ear as yet. Not even my  uncle suspects the direction of my thoughts.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo;  he again enjoined. </p>
  <p>Upon  which I plunged into my subject. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Fairbrother wore the real diamond, and no imitation, to the ball. Of this I  feel sure. The bit of glass or paste displayed to the coroner&rsquo;s jury was bright  enough, but it was not the star of light I saw burning on her breast as she  passed me on her way to the alcove.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Van Arsdale!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  interest which Mr. Durand displayed in it, the marked excitement into which he  was thrown by his first view of its size and splendor, confirm in my mind the  evidence which he gave on oath (and he is a well-known diamond expert, you  know, and must have been very well aware that he would injure rather than help  his cause by this admission) that at that time he believed the stone to be real  and of immense value. Wearing such a gem, then, she entered the fatal alcove,  and, with a smile on her face, prepared to employ her fascinations on whoever  chanced to come within their reach. But now something happened. Please let me  tell it my own way. A shout from the driveway, or a bit of snow thrown against  the window, drew her attention to a man standing below, holding up a note  fastened to the end of a whip-handle. I do not know whether or not you have  found that man. If you have&mdash;&rdquo; The inspector made no sign. &ldquo;I judge that you  have not, so I may go on with my suppositions. Mrs. Fairbrother took in this  note. She may have expected it and for this reason chose the alcove to sit in,  or it may have been a surprise to her. Probably we shall never know the whole  truth about it; but what we can know and do, if you are still holding to our  compact and viewing this crime in the light of Mr. Durand&rsquo;s explanations, is  that it made a change in her and made her anxious to rid herself of the  diamond. It has been decided that the hurried scrawl should read, &lsquo;Take  warning. He means to be at the ball. Expect trouble <i>if you do not give him the  diamond</i>,&rsquo; or something to that effect. But why was it passed up to her  unfinished? Was the haste too great? I hardly think so. I believe in another  explanation, which points with startling directness to the possibility that the  person referred to in this broken communication was not Mr. Durand, but one  whom I need not name; and that the reason you have failed to find the messenger,  of whose appearance you have received definite information, is that you have  not looked among the servants of a certain distinguished visitor in town. Oh,&rdquo;  I burst forth with feverish volubility, as I saw the inspector&rsquo;s lips open in  what could not fail to be a sarcastic utterance, &ldquo;I know what you feel tempted  to reply. Why should a servant deliver a warning against his own master? If you  will be patient with me you will soon see; but first I wish to make it clear  that Mrs. Fairbrother, having received this warning just before Mr. Durand  appeared in the alcove,&mdash;reckless, scheming woman that she was!&mdash;sought to rid  herself of the object against which it was directed in the way we have  temporarily accepted as true. Relying on her arts, and possibly misconceiving  the nature of Mr. Durand&rsquo;s interest in her, she hands over the diamond hidden  in her rolled-up gloves, which he, without suspicion, carries away with him,  thus linking himself indissolubly to a great crime of which another was the  perpetrator. That other, or so I believe from my very heart of hearts, was the  man I saw leaning against the wall at the foot of the alcove a few minutes  before I passed into the supper-room.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  stopped with a gasp, hardly able to meet the stern and forbidding look with which  the inspector sought to restrain what he evidently considered the senseless  ravings of a child. But I had come there to speak, and I hastily proceeded  before the rebuke thus expressed could formulate itself into words. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have some excuse for a declaration so monstrous. Perhaps I am the only person  who can satisfy you in regard to a certain fact about which you have expressed  some curiosity. Inspector, have you ever solved the mystery of the two broken  coffee-cups found amongst the debris at Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s feet? It did not  come out in the inquest, I noticed.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but&mdash;you can not tell me anything about them!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly  not. But I can tell you this: When I reached the supper-room door that evening  I looked back and, providentially or otherwise&mdash;only the future can determine  that&mdash;detected Mr. Grey in the act of lifting two cups from a tray left by some  waiter on a table standing just outside the reception-room door. I did not see  where he carried them; I only saw his face turned toward the alcove; and as  there was no other lady there, or anywhere near there, I have dared to think&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Here  the inspector found speech. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw Mr. Grey lift two cups and turn toward the alcove at a moment we all know  to have been critical? You should have told me this before. He may be a  possible witness.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  scarcely listened. I was too full of my own argument. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  were other people in the hall, especially at my end of it. A perfect throng was  coming from the billiard-room, where the dancing had been, and it might easily  be that he could both enter and leave that secluded spot without attracting  attention. He had shown too early and much too unmistakably his lack of  interest in the general company for his every movement to be watched as at his  first arrival. But this is simple conjecture; what I have to say next is  evidence. The stiletto&mdash;have you studied it, sir? I have, from the pictures. It  is very quaint; and among the devices on the handle is one that especially  attracted my attention. See! This is what I mean.&rdquo; And I handed him a drawing  which I had made with some care in expectation of this very interview. </p>
  <p>He  surveyed it with some astonishment. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand,&rdquo; I pursued in trembling tones, for I was much affected by my own  daring, &ldquo;that no one has so far succeeded in tracing this weapon to its owner.  Why didn&rsquo;t your experts study heraldry and the devices of great houses? They  would have found that this one is not unknown in England. I can tell you on  whose blazon it can often be seen, and so could&mdash;Mr. Grey.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_10"></a>Chapter 10 <br>
I Astonish The Inspector</b></h2>
  <p>I  was not the only one to tremble now. This man of infinite experience and daily  contact with crime had turned as pale as ever I myself had done in face of a  threatening calamity. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall see about this,&rdquo; he muttered, crumpling the paper in his hand. &ldquo;But this  is a very terrible business you are plunging me into. I sincerely hope that you  are not heedlessly misleading me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am correct in my facts, if that is what you mean,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The stiletto is an  English heirloom, and bears on its blade, among other devices, that of Mr.  Grey&rsquo;s family on the female side. But that is not all I want to say. If the  blow was struck to obtain the diamond, the shock of not finding it on his  victim must have been terrible. Now Mr. Grey&rsquo;s heart, if my whole theory is not  utterly false, was set upon obtaining this stone. Your eye was not on him as  mine was when you made your appearance in the hall with the recovered jewel. He  showed astonishment, eagerness, and a determination which finally led him  forward, as you know, with the request to take the diamond in his hand. Why did  he want to take it in his hand? And why, having taken it, did he drop it&mdash;a  diamond supposed to be worth an ordinary man&rsquo;s fortune? Because he was startled  by a cry he chose to consider the traditional one of his family proclaiming  death? Is it likely, sir? Is it conceivable even that any such cry as we heard  could, in this day and generation, ring through such an assemblage, unless it  came with ventriloquial power from his own lips? You observed that he turned  his back; that his face was hidden from us. Discreet and reticent as we have  all been, and careful in our criticisms of so bizarre an event, there still  must be many to question the reality of such superstitious fears, and some to  ask if such a sound could be without human agency, and a very guilty agency,  too. Inspector, I am but a child in your estimation, and I feel my position in  this matter much more keenly than you do, but I would not be true to the man  whom I have unwittingly helped to place in his present unenviable position if I  did not tell you that, in my judgment, this cry was a spurious one, employed by  the gentleman himself as an excuse for dropping the stone.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why should he wish to drop the stone?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  of the fraud he meditated. Because it offered him an opportunity for  substituting a false stone for the real. Did you not notice a change in the  aspect of this jewel dating from this very moment? Did it shine with as much  brilliancy in your hand when you received it back as when you passed it over?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  I do not know; it is all too absurd for argument.&rdquo; Yet he did stop to argue,  saying in the next breath: &ldquo;You forget that the stone has a setting. Would you  claim that this gentleman of family, place and political distinction had  planned this hideous crime with sufficient premeditation to have provided  himself with the exact counterpart of a brooch which it is highly improbable he  ever saw? You would make him out a Cagliostro or something worse. Miss Van  Arsdale, I fear your theory will topple over of its own weight.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  was very patient with me; he did not show me the door. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  such a substitution took place, and took place that evening,&rdquo; I insisted. &ldquo;The  bit of paste shown us at the inquest was never the gem Mrs. Fairbrother wore on  entering the alcove. Besides, where all is sensation, why cavil at one more  improbability? Mr. Grey may have come over to America for no other reason. He  is known as a collector, and when a man has a passion for diamond-getting&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is known as a collector?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  his own country.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was not told that.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  I. But I found it out.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How,  my dear child, how?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  a cablegram or so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>You&mdash;cabled&mdash;his  name&mdash;to England?</i>&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Inspector; uncle has a code, and I made use of it to ask a friend in London for  a list of the most noted diamond fanciers in the country. Mr. Grey&rsquo;s name was  third on the list.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  gave me a look in which admiration was strangely blended with doubt and  apprehension. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are making a brave struggle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but it is a hopeless one.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have one more confidence to repose in you. The nurse who has charge of Miss  Grey was in my class in the hospital. We love each other, and to her I dared  appeal on one point. Inspector&mdash;&rdquo; here my voice unconsciously fell as he  impetuously drew nearer&mdash;&ldquo;a note was sent from that sick chamber on the night of  the ball,&mdash;a note surreptitiously written by Miss Grey, while the nurse was in  an adjoining room. The messenger was Mr. Grey&rsquo;s valet, and its destination the  house in which her father was enjoying his position as chief guest. She says  that it was meant for him, but I have dared to think that the valet would tell  a different story. My friend did not see what her patient wrote, but she acknowledged  that if her patient wrote more than two words the result must have been an  unintelligible scrawl, since she was too weak to hold a pencil firmly, and so  nearly blind that she would have had to feel her way over the paper.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  inspector started, and, rising hastily, went to his desk, from which he  presently brought the scrap of paper which had already figured in the inquest  as the mysterious communication taken from Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s hand by the  coroner. Pressing it out flat, he took another look at it, then glanced up in  visible discomposure. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has always looked to us as if written in the dark, by an agitated hand; but&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  said nothing; the broken and unfinished scrawl was sufficiently eloquent. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  your friend declare Miss Grey to have written with a pencil and on a small  piece of unruled paper?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the pencil was at her bedside; the paper was torn from a book which lay there.  She did not put the note when written in an envelope, but gave it to the valet  just as it was. He is an old man and had come to her room for some final  orders.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  nurse saw all this? Has she that book?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it went out next morning, with the scraps. It was some pamphlet, I believe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  inspector turned the morsel of paper over and over in his hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is this nurse&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Henrietta  Pierson.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  she share your doubts?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not say.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have seen her often?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  only the one time.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she discreet?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very.  On this subject she will be like the grave unless forced by you to speak.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Miss Grey?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is still ill, too ill to be disturbed by questions, especially on so delicate a  topic. But she is getting well fast. Her father&rsquo;s fears as we heard them  expressed on one memorable occasion were ill founded, sir.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Slowly  the inspector inserted this scrap of paper between the folds of his pocketbook.  He did not give me another look, though I stood trembling before him. Was he in  any way convinced or was he simply seeking for the most considerate way in  which to dismiss me and my abominable theory? I could not gather his intentions  from his expression, and was feeling very faint and heart-sick when he suddenly  turned upon me with the remark: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  girl as ill as you say Miss Grey was must have had some very pressing matter on  her mind to attempt to write and send a message under such difficulties.  According to your idea, she had some notion of her father&rsquo;s designs and wished  to warn Mrs. Fairbrother against them. But don&rsquo;t you see that such conduct as  this would be preposterous, nay, unparalleled in persons of their distinction?  You must find some other explanation for Miss Grey&rsquo;s seemingly mysterious  action, and I an agent of crime other than one of England&rsquo;s most reputable  statesmen.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that Mr. Durand is shown the same consideration, I am content,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It is  the truth and the truth only I desire. I am willing to trust my cause with  you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  looked none too grateful for this confidence. Indeed, now that I look back on  this scene, I do not wonder that he shrank from the responsibility thus foisted  upon him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want me to do?&rdquo; he asked. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prove  something. Prove that I am altogether wrong or altogether right. Or if proof is  not possible, pray allow me the privilege of doing what I can myself to clear  up the matter.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>There  was apprehension, disapprobation, almost menace in his tone. I bore it with as  steady and modest a glance as possible, saying, when I thought he was about to  speak again: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will do nothing without your sanction. I realize the dangers of this inquiry and  the disgrace that would follow if our attempt was suspected before proof  reached a point sufficient to justify it. It is not an open attack I meditate,  but one&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Here  I whispered in his ear for several minutes, when I had finished he gave me a  prolonged stare, then he laid his hand on my head. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a little wonder,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;But your ideas are very quixotic, very.  However,&rdquo; he added, suddenly growing grave, &ldquo;something, I must admit, may be  excused a young girl who finds herself forced to choose between the guilt of  her lover and that of a man esteemed great by the world, but altogether removed  from her and her natural sympathies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  acknowledge, then, that it lies between these two?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see no third,&rdquo; said he. </p>
  <p>I  drew a breath of relief. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  deceive yourself, Miss Van Arsdale; it is not among the possibilities that Mr.  Grey has had any connection with this crime. He is an eccentric man, that&rsquo;s  all.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall do my duty. I shall satisfy you and myself on certain points, and if&mdash;&rdquo; I  hardly breathed &ldquo;&mdash;there is the least doubt, I will see you again and&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  change he saw in me frightened away the end of his sentence. Turning upon me  with some severity, he declared: &ldquo;There are nine hundred and ninety-nine  chances in a thousand that my next word to you will be to prepare yourself for  Mr. Durand&rsquo;s arraignment and trial. But an infinitesimal chance remains to the  contrary. If you choose to trust to it, I can only admire your pluck and the  great confidence you show in your unfortunate lover.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>And  with this half-hearted encouragement I was forced to be content, not only for  that day, but for many days, when&mdash; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_11"></a>Chapter 11 <br>
The Inspector Astonishes Me</b></h2>
  <p>But  before I proceed to relate what happened at the end of those two weeks, I must  say a word or two in regard to what happened during them. </p>
  <p>Nothing  happened to improve Mr. Durand&rsquo;s position, and nothing openly to compromise Mr.  Grey&rsquo;s. Mr. Fairbrother, from whose testimony many of us hoped something would  yet be gleaned calculated to give a turn to the suspicion now centered on one  man, continued ill in New Mexico; and all that could be learned from him of any  importance was contained in a short letter dictated from his bed, in which he  affirmed that the diamond, when it left him, was in a unique setting procured  by himself in France; that he knew of no other jewel similarly mounted, and  that if the false gem was set according to his own description, the  probabilities were that the imitation stone had been put in place of the real  one under his wife&rsquo;s direction and in some workshop in New York, as she was not  the woman to take the trouble to send abroad for anything she could get done in  this country. The description followed. It coincided with the one we all knew. </p>
  <p>This  was something of a blow to me. Public opinion would naturally reflect that of  the husband, and it would require very strong evidence indeed to combat a  logical supposition of this kind with one so forced and seemingly extravagant  as that upon which my own theory was based. Yet truth often transcends  imagination, and, having confidence in the inspector&rsquo;s integrity, I subdued my  impatience for a week, almost for two, when my suspense and rapidly culminating  dread of some action being taken against Mr. Durand were suddenly cut short by  a message from the inspector, followed by his speedy presence in my uncle&rsquo;s  house. </p>
  <p>We  have a little room on our parlor floor, very snug and secluded, and in this  room I received him. Seldom have I dreaded a meeting more and seldom have I  been met with greater kindness and consideration. He was so kind that I feared  he had only disappointing news to communicate, but his first words reassured  me. He said: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have come to you on a matter of importance. We have found enough truth in the  suppositions you advanced at our last interview to warrant us in the attempt  you yourself proposed for the elucidation of this mystery. That this is the  most risky and altogether the most unpleasant duty which I have encountered  during my several years of service, I am willing to acknowledge to one so  sensible and at the same time of so much modesty as yourself. This English  gentleman has a reputation which lifts him far above any unworthy suspicion,  and were it not for the favorable impression made upon us by Mr. Durand in a  long talk we had with him last night, I would sooner resign my place than  pursue this matter against him. Success would create a horror on both sides the  water unprecedented during my career, while failure would bring down ridicule  on us which would destroy the prestige of the whole force. Do you see my  difficulty, Miss Van Arsdale? We can not even approach this haughty and highly  reputable Englishman with questions without calling down on us the wrath of the  whole English nation. We must be sure before we make a move, and for us to be  sure where the evidence is all circumstantial, I know of no better plan than  the one you were pleased to suggest, which, at the time, I was pleased to call  quixotic.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Drawing  a long breath I surveyed him timidly. Never had I so realized my presumption or  experienced such a thrill of joy in my frightened yet elated heart. They  believed in Anson&rsquo;s innocence and they trusted me. Insignificant as I was, it  was to my exertions this great result was due. As I realized this, I felt my  heart swell and my throat close. In despair of speaking I held out my hands. He  took them kindly and seemed to be quite satisfied. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  a little, trembling, tear-filled Amazon!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Shall you have courage to  undertake the task before you? If not&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but I have,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It is your goodness and the surprise of it all which  unnerves me. I can go through what we have planned if you think the secret of  my personality and interest in Mr. Durand can be kept from the people I go  among.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can if you will follow our advice implicitly. You say that you know the doctor  and that he stands ready to recommend you in case Miss Pierson withdraws her  services.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he is eager to give me a chance. He was a college mate of my father&rsquo;s.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  will you explain to him your wish to enter upon your duties under another  name?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  simply. I have already told him that the publicity given my name in the late  proceedings has made me very uncomfortable; that my first case of nursing would  require all my self-possession and that if he did not think it wrong I should  like to go to it under my mother&rsquo;s name. He made no dissent and I think I can  persuade him that I would do much better work as Miss Ayers than as the too  well-known Miss Van Arsdale.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have great powers of persuasion. But may you not meet people at the hotel who  know you?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall try to avoid people; and, if my identity is discovered, its effect or  non-effect upon one we find it difficult to mention will give us our clue. If  he has no guilty interest in the crime, my connection with it as a witness will  not disturb him. Besides, two days of unsuspicious acceptance of me as Miss  Grey&rsquo;s nurse are all I want. I shall take immediate opportunity, I assure you,  to make the test I mentioned. But how much confidence you will have to repose  in me! I comprehend all the importance of my undertaking, and shall work as if  my honor, as well as yours, were at stake.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure you will.&rdquo; Then for the first time in my life I was glad that I was  small and plain rather than tall and fascinating like so many of my friends,  for he said: &ldquo;If you had been a triumphant beauty, depending on your charms as  a woman to win people to your will, we should never have listened to your  proposition or risked our reputation in your hands. It is your wit, your  earnestness and your quiet determination which have impressed us. You see I  speak plainly. I do so because I respect you. And now to business.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Details  followed. After these were well understood between us, I ventured to say: &ldquo;Do  you object&mdash;would it be asking too much&mdash;if I requested some enlightenment as to  what facts you have discovered about Mr. Grey which go to substantiate my  theory? I might work more intelligently.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Miss Van Arsdale, you would not work more intelligently, and you know it. But  you have the natural curiosity of one whose very heart is bound up in this  business. I could deny you what you ask but I won&rsquo;t, for I want you to work  with quiet confidence, which you would not do if your mind were taken up with  doubts and questions. Miss Van Arsdale, one surmise of yours was correct. A man  was sent that night to the Ramsdell house with a note from Miss Grey. We know  this because he boasted of it to one of the bell-boys before he went out,  saying that he was going to have a glimpse of one of the swellest parties of  the season. It is also true that this man was Mr. Grey&rsquo;s valet, an old servant  who came over with him from England. But what adds weight to all this and makes  us regard the whole affair with suspicion, is the additional fact that this man  received his dismissal the following morning and has not been seen since by any  one we could reach. This looks bad to begin with, like the suppression of  evidence, you know. Then Mr. Grey has not been the same man since that night.  He is full of care and this care is not entirely in connection with his  daughter, who is doing very well and bids fair to be up in a few days. But all  this would be nothing if we had not received advices from England which prove  that Mr. Grey&rsquo;s visit here has an element of mystery in it. There was every  reason for his remaining in his own country, where a political crisis is  approaching, yet he crossed the water, bringing his sickly daughter with him.  The explanation as volunteered by one who knew him well was this: That only his  desire to see or acquire some precious object for his collection could have  taken him across the ocean at this time, nothing else rivaling his interest in  governmental affairs. Still this would be nothing if a stiletto similar to the  one employed in this crime had not once formed part of a collection of curios  belonging to a cousin of his whom he often visited. This stiletto has been  missing for some time, stolen, as the owner declared, by some unknown person. All  this looks bad enough, but when I tell you that a week before the fatal ball at  Mr. Ramsdell&rsquo;s, Mr. Grey made a tour of the jewelers on Broadway and, with the  pretext of buying a diamond for his daughter, entered into a talk about famous  stones, ending always with some question about the Fairbrother gem, you will  see that his interest in that stone is established and that it only remains for  us to discover if that interest is a guilty one. I can not believe this  possible, but you have our leave to make your experiment and see. Only do not  count too much on his superstition. If he is the deep-dyed criminal you  imagine, the cry which startled us all at a certain critical instant was raised  by himself and for the purpose you suggested. None of the sensitiveness often  shown by a man who has been surprised into crime will be his. Relying on his  reputation and the prestige of his great name, he will, if he thinks himself  under fire, face every shock unmoved.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see; I understand. He must believe himself all alone; then, the natural man may  appear. I thank you, Inspector. That idea is of inestimable value to me, and I  shall act on it. I do not say immediately; not on the first day, and possibly  not on the second, but as soon as opportunity offers for my doing what I have  planned with any chance of success. And now, advise me how to circumvent my  uncle and aunt, who must never know to what an undertaking I have committed  myself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Inspector  Dalzell spared me another fifteen minutes, and this last detail was arranged.  Then he rose to go. As he turned from me he said: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>And  I answered with a full heart, but a voice clear as my purpose: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12"></a>Chapter 12 <br>
Almost</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is your patient. Your new nurse, my dear. What did you say your name is? Miss  Ayers?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Grey, Alice Ayers.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  what a sweet name!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  expressive greeting, from the patient herself, was the first heart-sting I  received,&mdash;a sting which brought a flush into my cheek which I would fain have  kept down. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  a change of nurses was necessary, I am glad they sent me one like you,&rdquo; the  feeble, but musical voice went on, and I saw a wasted but eager hand stretched  out. </p>
  <p>In  a whirl of strong feeling I advanced to take it. I had not counted on such a  reception. I had not expected any bond of congeniality to spring up between  this high-feeling English girl and myself to make my purpose hateful to me.  Yet, as I stood there looking down at her bright if wasted face, I felt that it  would be very easy to love so gentle and cordial a being, and dreaded raising  my eyes to the gentleman at my side lest I should see something in him to  hamper me, and make this attempt, which I had undertaken in such loyalty of  spirit, a misery to myself and ineffectual to the man I had hoped to save by  it. When I did look up and catch the first beams of Mr. Grey&rsquo;s keen blue eyes  fixed inquiringly on me, I neither knew what to think nor how to act. He was  tall and firmly knit, and had an intellectual aspect altogether. I was  conscious of regarding him with a decided feeling of awe, and found myself  forgetting why I had come there, and what my suspicions were,&mdash;suspicions which  had carried hope with them, hope for myself and hope for my lover, who would  never escape the opprobrium, even if he did the punishment, of this great  crime, were this, the only other person who could possibly be associated with  it, found to be the fine, clear-souled man he appeared to be in this my first  interview with him. </p>
  <p>Perceiving  very soon that his apprehensions in my regard were limited to a fear lest I  should not feel at ease in my new home under the restraint of a presence more  accustomed to intimidate than attract strangers, I threw aside all doubts of  myself and met the advances of both father and daughter with that quiet confidence  which my position there demanded. </p>
  <p>The  result both gratified and grieved me. As a nurse entering on her first case I  was happy; as a woman with an ulterior object in view verging on the audacious  and unspeakable, I was wretched and regretful and just a little shaken in the  conviction which had hitherto upheld me. </p>
  <p>I  was therefore but poorly prepared to meet the ordeal which awaited me, when, a  little later in the day, Mr. Grey called me into the adjoining room, and, after  saying that it would afford him great relief to go out for an hour or so, asked  if I were afraid to be left alone with my patient. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  no, sir&mdash;&rdquo; I began, but stopped in secret dismay. I was afraid, but not on  account of her condition; rather on account of my own. What if I should be led  into betraying my feelings on finding myself under no other eye than her own!  What if the temptation to probe her poor sick mind should prove stronger than  my duty toward her as a nurse! </p>
  <p>My  tones were hesitating but Mr. Grey paid little heed; his mind was too fixed on  what he wished to say himself. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  I go,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have a request to make&mdash;I may as well say a caution to give  you. Do not, I pray, either now or at any future time, carry or allow any one  else to carry newspapers into Miss Grey&rsquo;s room. They are just now too alarming.  There has been, as you know, a dreadful murder in this city. If she caught one  glimpse of the headlines, or saw so much as the name of Fairbrother&mdash;which&mdash;which  is a name she knows, the result might be very hurtful to her. She is not only  extremely sensitive from illness but from temperament. Will you be careful?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be careful.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was such an effort for me to say these words, to say anything in the state of  mind into which I had been thrown by his unexpected allusion to this subject,  that I unfortunately drew his attention to myself and it was with what I felt  to be a glance of doubt that he added with decided emphasis: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must consider this whole subject as a forbidden one in this family. Only  cheerful topics are suitable for the sick-room. If Miss Grey attempts to  introduce any other, stop her. Do not let her talk about anything which will  not be conducive to her speedy recovery. These are the only instructions I have  to give you; all others must come from her physician.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  made some reply with as little show of emotion as possible. It seemed to  satisfy him, for his face cleared as he kindly observed: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have a very trustworthy look for one so young. I shall rest easy while you are  with her, and I shall expect you to be always with her when I am not. Every  moment, mind. She is never to be left alone with gossiping servants. If a word  is mentioned in her hearing about this crime which seems to be in everybody&rsquo;s  mouth, I shall feel forced, greatly as I should regret the fad, to blame you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  was a heart-stroke, but I kept up bravely, changing color perhaps, but not to  such a marked degree as to arouse any deeper suspicion in his mind than that I  had been wounded in my <i>amour propre</i>. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  shall be well guarded,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You may trust me to keep from her all  avoidable knowledge of this crime.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  bowed and I was about to leave his presence, when he detained me by remarking  with the air of one who felt that some explanation was necessary: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was at the ball where this crime took place. Naturally it has made a deep  impression on me and would on her if she heard of it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo;  I murmured, wondering if he would say more and how I should have the courage to  stand there and listen if he did. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the first time I have ever come in contact with crime,&rdquo; he went on with  what, in one of his reserved nature, seemed a hardly natural insistence. &ldquo;I  could well have been spared the experience. A tragedy with which one has been  even thus remotely connected produces a lasting effect upon the mind.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, oh yes!&rdquo; I murmured, edging involuntarily toward the door. Did I not know?  Had I not been there, too; I, little I, whom he stood gazing down upon from  such a height, little realizing the fatality which united us and, what was even  a more overwhelming thought to me at the moment, the fact that of all persons  in the world the shrinking little being, into whose eyes he was then looking,  was, perhaps, his greatest enemy and the one person, great or small, from whom  he had the most to fear. </p>
  <p>But  I was no enemy to his gentle daughter and the relief I felt at finding myself  thus cut off by my own promise from even the remotest communication with her on  this forbidden subject was genuine and sincere. </p>
  <p>But  the father! What was I to think of the father? Alas! I could have but one  thought, admirable as he appeared in all lights save the one in which his too  evident connection with this crime had placed him. I spent the hours of the  afternoon in alternately watching the sleeping face of my patient, too sweetly  calm in its repose, or so it seemed, for the mind beneath to harbor such doubts  as were shown in the warning I had ascribed to her, and vain efforts to explain  by any other hypothesis than that of guilt, the extraordinary evidence which  linked this man of great affairs and the loftiest repute to a crime involving  both theft and murder. </p>
  <p>Nor  did the struggle end that night. It was renewed with still greater positiveness  the next day, as I witnessed the glances which from time to time passed between  this father and daughter,&mdash;glances full of doubt and question on both sides, but  not exactly such doubt or such question as my suspicions called for. Or so I  thought, and spent another day or two hesitating very much over my duty, when,  coming unexpectedly upon Mr. Grey one evening, I felt all my doubts revive in  view of the extraordinary expression of dread&mdash;I might with still greater truth  say fear&mdash;which informed his features and made them, to my unaccustomed eyes,  almost unrecognizable. </p>
  <p>He  was sitting at his desk in reverie over some papers which he seemed not to have  touched for hours, and when, at some movement I made, he started up and met my  eye, I could swear that his cheek was pale, the firm carriage of his body  shaken, and the whole man a victim to some strong and secret apprehension he  vainly sought to hide, when I ventured to tell him what I wanted, he made an  effort and pulled himself together, but I had seen him with his mask off, and  his usually calm visage and self-possessed mien could not again deceive me. </p>
  <p>My  duties kept me mainly at Miss Grey&rsquo;s bedside, but I had been provided with a  little room across the hall, and to this room I retired very soon after this,  for rest and a necessary understanding with myself. </p>
  <p>For,  in spite of this experience and my now settled convictions, my purpose required  whetting. The indescribable charm, the extreme refinement and nobility of  manner observable in both Mr. Grey and his daughter were producing their  effect. I felt guilty; constrained, whatever my convictions, the impetus to act  was leaving me. How could I recover it? By thinking of Anson Durand and his  present disgraceful position. </p>
  <p>Anson  Durand! Oh, how the feeling surged up in my breast as that name slipped from my  lips on crossing the threshold of my little room! Anson Durand, whom I believed  innocent, whom I loved, but whom I was betraying with every moment of  hesitation in which I allowed myself to indulge! what if the Honorable Mr. Grey  is an eminent statesman, a dignified, scholarly, and to all appearance,  high-minded man? what if my patient is sweet, dove-eyed and affectionate? Had  not Anson qualities as excellent in their way, rights as certain, and a hold  upon myself superior to any claims which another might advance? Drawing a  much-crumpled little note from my pocket, I eagerly read it. It was the only  one I had of his writing, the only letter he had ever written me. I had already  re-read it a hundred times, but as I once more repeated to myself its  well-known lines, I felt my heart grow strong and fixed in the determination  which had brought me into this family. </p>
  <p>Restoring  the letter to its place, I opened my gripsack and from its inmost recesses drew  forth an object which I had no sooner in hand than a natural sense of disquietude  led me to glance apprehensively, first at the door, then at the window, though  I had locked the one and shaded the other. It seemed as if some other eye  besides my own must be gazing at what I held so gingerly in hand; that the  walls were watching me, if nothing else, and the sensation this produced was so  exactly like that of guilt (or what I imagined to be guilt), that I was forced  to repeat once more to myself that it was not a good man&rsquo;s overthrow I sought,  or even a bad man&rsquo;s immunity from punishment, but the truth, the absolute  truth. No shame could equal that which I should feel if, by any over-delicacy  now, I failed to save the man who trusted me. </p>
  <p>The  article which I held&mdash;have you guessed it?&mdash;was the stiletto with which Mrs.  Fairbrother had been killed. It had been intrusted to me by the police for a  definite purpose. The time for testing that purpose had come, or so nearly  come, that I felt I must be thinking about the necessary ways and means. </p>
  <p>Unwinding  the folds of tissue paper in which the stiletto was wrapped, I scrutinized the  weapon very carefully. Hitherto, I had seen only pictures of it, now, I had the  article itself in my hand. It was not a natural one for a young woman to hold,  a woman whose taste ran more toward healing than inflicting wounds, but I  forced myself to forget why the end of its blade was rusty, and looked mainly  at the devices which ornamented the handle. I had not been mistaken in them.  They belonged to the house of Grey, and to none other. It was a legitimate  inquiry I had undertaken. However the matter ended, I should always have these  historic devices for my excuse. </p>
  <p>My  plan was to lay this dagger on Mr. Grey&rsquo;s desk at a moment when he would be  sure to see it and I to see him. If he betrayed a guilty knowledge of this  fatal steel; if, unconscious of my presence, he showed surprise and  apprehension,&mdash;then we should know how to proceed; justice would be loosed from  constraint and the police feel at liberty to approach him. It was a delicate  task, this. I realized how delicate, when I had thrust the stiletto out of  sight under my nurse&rsquo;s apron and started to cross the hall. Should I find the  library clear? Would the opportunity be given me to approach his desk, or  should I have to carry this guilty witness of a world-famous crime on into Miss  Grey&rsquo;s room, and with its unholy outline pressing a semblance of itself upon my  breast, sit at that innocent pillow, meet those innocent eyes, and answer the  gentle inquiries which now and then fell from the sweetest lips I have ever seen  smile into the face of a lonely, preoccupied stranger? </p>
  <p>The  arrangement of the rooms was such as made it necessary for me to pass through  this sitting-room in order to reach my patient&rsquo;s bedroom. </p>
  <p>With  careful tread, so timed as not to appear stealthy, I accordingly advanced and  pushed open the door. The room was empty. Mr. Grey was still with his daughter  and I could cross the floor without fear. But never had I entered upon a task  requiring more courage or one more obnoxious to my natural instincts. I hated  each step I took, but I loved the man for whom I took those steps, and moved  resolutely on. Only, as I reached the chair in which Mr. Grey was accustomed to  sit, I found that it was easier to plan an action than to carry it out. Home  life and the domestic virtues had always appealed to me more than a man&rsquo;s  greatness. The position which this man held in his own country, his usefulness  there, even his prestige as statesman and scholar, were facts, but very dreamy  facts, to me, while his feelings as a father, the place he held in his  daughter&rsquo;s heart&mdash;these were real to me, these I could understand; and it was of  these and not of his place as a man, that this his favorite seat spoke to me.  How often had I beheld him sit by the hour with his eye on the door behind  which his one darling lay ill! Even now, it was easy for me to recall his face  as I had sometimes caught a glimpse of it through the crack of the suddenly  opened door, and I felt my breast heave and my hand falter as I drew forth the  stiletto and moved to place it where his eye would fall upon it on his leaving  his daughter&rsquo;s bedside. </p>
  <p>But  my hand returned quickly to my breast and fell back again empty. A pile of  letters lay before me on the open lid of the desk. The top one was addressed to  me with the word &ldquo;Important&rdquo; written in the corner. I did not know the writing,  but I felt that I should open and read this letter before committing myself or  those who stood back of me to this desperate undertaking. </p>
  <p>Glancing  behind me and seeing that the door into Miss Grey&rsquo;s room was ajar, I caught up  this letter and rushed with it back into my own room. As I surmised, it was  from the inspector, and as I read it I realized that I had received it not one  moment too soon. In language purposely non-committal, but of a meaning not to  be mistaken, it advised me that some unforeseen facts had come to light which  altered all former suspicions and made the little surprise I had planned no  longer necessary. </p>
  <p>There  was no allusion to Mr. Durand but the final sentence ran: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drop  all care and give your undivided attention to your patient.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_13"></a>Chapter 13 <br>
The Missing Recommendation</b></h2>
  <p>My  patient slept that night, but I did not. The shock given by this sudden cry of  Halt! at the very moment I was about to make my great move, the uncertainty as  to what it meant and my doubt of its effect upon Mr. Durand&rsquo;s position, put me  on the anxious seat and kept my thoughts fully occupied till morning. </p>
  <p>I  was very tired and must have shown it, when, with the first rays of a very  meager sun, Miss Grey softly unclosed her eyes and found me looking at her, for  her smile had a sweet compassion in it, and she said as she pressed my hand: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must have watched me all night. I never saw any one look so tired,&mdash;or so good,&rdquo;  she softly finished. </p>
  <p>I  had rather she had not uttered that last phrase. It did not fit me at the  moment,&mdash;did not fit me, perhaps, at any time. Good! I! when my thoughts had not  been with her, but with Mr. Durand; when the dominating feeling in my breast  was not that of relief, but a vague regret that I had not been allowed to make  my great test and so establish, to my own satisfaction, at least, the perfect  innocence of my lover even at the cost of untold anguish to this confiding girl  upon whose gentle spirit the very thought of crime would cast a deadly blight. </p>
  <p>I  must have flushed; certainly I showed some embarrassment, for her eyes  brightened with shy laughter as she whispered: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not like to be praised,&mdash;another of your virtues. You have too many. I have  only one&mdash;I love my friends.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>She  did. One could see that love was life to her. </p>
  <p>For  an instant I trembled. How near I had been to wrecking this gentle soul! Was  she safe yet? I was not sure. My own doubts were not satisfied. I awaited the  papers with feverish impatience. They should contain news. News of what? Ah,  that was the question! </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will let me see my mail this morning, will you not?&rdquo; she asked, as I busied  myself about her. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is for the doctor to say,&rdquo; I smiled. &ldquo;You are certainly better this morning.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is so hard for me not to be able to read his letters, or to write a word to  relieve his anxiety.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Thus  she told me her heart&rsquo;s secret, and unconsciously added another burden to my  already too heavy load. </p>
  <p>I  was on my way to give some orders about my patient&rsquo;s breakfast, when Mr. Grey  came into the sitting-room and met me face to face. He had a newspaper in his  hand and my heart stood still as I noted his altered looks and disturbed  manner. Were these due to anything he had found in those columns? It was with  difficulty that I kept my eyes from the paper which he held in such a manner as  to disclose its glaring head-lines. These I dared not read with his eyes fixed  on mine. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  is Miss Grey? How is my daughter?&rdquo; he asked in great haste and uneasiness. &ldquo;Is she  better this morning, or&mdash;worse?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better,&rdquo;  I assured him, and was greatly astonished to see his brow instantly clear. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;  he asked. &ldquo;You really consider her better? The doctors say so but I have not  very much faith in doctors in a case like this,&rdquo; he added. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have seen no reason to distrust them,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;Miss Grey&rsquo;s illness, while  severe, does not appear to be of an alarming nature. But then I have had very  little experience out of the hospital. I am young yet, Mr. Grey.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  looked as if he quite agreed with me in this estimate of myself, and, with a  brow still clouded, passed into his daughter&rsquo;s room, the paper in his hand.  Before I joined them I found and scanned another journal. Expecting great  things, I was both surprised and disappointed to find only a small paragraph  devoted to the Fairbrother case. In this it was stated that the authorities  hoped for new light on this mystery as soon as they had located a certain  witness, whose connection with the crime they had just discovered. No more, no  less than was contained in Inspector Dalzell&rsquo;s letter. How could I bear it,&mdash;the  suspense, the doubt,&mdash;and do my duty to my patient! Happily, I had no choice. I  had been adjudged equal to this business and I must prove myself to be so.  Perhaps my courage would revive after I had had my breakfast; perhaps then I  should be able to fix upon the identity of the new witness,&mdash;something which I  found myself incapable of at this moment. </p>
  <p>These  thoughts were on my mind as I crossed the rooms on my way back to Miss Grey&rsquo;s  bedside. By the time I reached her door I was outwardly calm, as her first  words showed: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the cheerful smile! It makes me feel better in spite of myself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>If  she could have seen into my heart! </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey, who was leaning over the foot of the bed, cast me a quick glance which  was not without its suspicion. Had he detected me playing a part, or were such  doubts as he displayed the product simply of his own uneasiness? I was not able  to decide, and, with this unanswered question added to the number already  troubling me, I was forced to face the day which, for aught I knew, might be  the precursor of many others equally trying and unsatisfactory. </p>
  <p>But  help was near. Before noon I received a message from my uncle to the effect  that if I could be spared he would be glad to see me at his home as near three  o&rsquo;clock as possible. What could he want of me? I could not guess, and it was  with great inner perturbation that, having won Mr. Grey&rsquo;s permission, I  responded to his summons. </p>
  <p>I  found my uncle awaiting me in a carriage before his own door, and I took my  seat at his side without the least idea of his purpose. I supposed that he had  planned this ride that he might talk to me unreservedly and without fear of  interruption. But I soon saw that he had some very different object in view,  for not only did he start down town instead of up, but his conversation, such  as it was, confined itself to generalities and studiously avoided the one topic  of supreme interest to us both. </p>
  <p>At  last, as we turned into Bleecker Street, I let my astonishment and perplexity  appear. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are we bound?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;It can not be that you are taking me to see Mr.  Durand?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said he, and said no more. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Police Headquarters!&rdquo; I faltered as the carriage made another turn and drew up  before a building I had reason to remember. &ldquo;Uncle, what am I to do here?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  a friend,&rdquo; he answered, as he helped me to alight. Then as I followed him in  some bewilderment, he whispered in my ear: &ldquo;Inspector Dalzell. He wants a few  minutes conversation with you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Oh,  the weight which fell from my shoulders at these words! I was to hear, then,  what had intervened between me and my purpose. The wearing night I had  anticipated was to be lightened with some small spark of knowledge. I had confidence  enough in the kind-hearted inspector to be sure of that. I caught at my uncle&rsquo;s  arm and squeezed it delightedly, quite oblivious of the curious glances I must  have received from the various officials we passed on our way to the  inspector&rsquo;s office. </p>
  <p>We  found him waiting for us, and I experienced such pleasure at sight of his kind  and earnest face that I hardly noticed uncle&rsquo;s sly retreat till the door closed  behind him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Inspector, what has happened?&rdquo; I impetuously exclaimed in answer to his greeting.  &ldquo;Something that will help Mr. Durand without disturbing Mr. Grey&mdash;have you as  good news for me as that?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo;  he answered, moving up a chair and seating me in it with a fatherly air which,  under the circumstances, was more discouraging than consolatory. &ldquo;We have  simply heard of a new witness, or rather a fact has come to light which has  turned our inquiries into a new direction.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;you  can not tell me what this fact is?&rdquo; I faltered as he showed no intention of  adding anything to this very unsatisfactory explanation. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should not, but you were willing to do so much for us I must set aside my  principles a little and do something for you. After all, it is only  forestalling the reporters by a day. Miss Van Arsdale, this is the story:  Yesterday morning a man was shown into this room, and said that he had  information to give which might possibly prove to have some bearing on the  Fairbrother case. I had seen the man before and recognized him at the first  glance as one of the witnesses who made the inquest unnecessarily tedious. Do  you remember Jones, the caterer, who had only two or three facts to give and  yet who used up the whole afternoon in trying to state those facts?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, indeed,&rdquo; I answered. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he was the man, and I own that I was none too delighted to see him. But he was  more at his ease with me than I expected, and I soon learned what he had to  tell. It was this: One of his men had suddenly left him, one of his very best  men, one of those who had been with him in the capacity of waiter at the  Ramsdell ball. It was not uncommon for his men to leave him, but they usually  gave notice. This man gave no notice; he simply did not show up at the usual  hour. This was a week or two ago. Jones, having a liking for the man, who was  an excellent waiter, sent a messenger to his lodging-house to see if he were  ill. But he had left his lodgings with as little ceremony as he had left the  caterer. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,  under ordinary circumstances, would have ended the business, but there being  some great function in prospect, Jones did not feel like losing so good a man  without making an effort to recover him, so he looked up his references in the  hope of obtaining some clue to his present whereabouts. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  kept all such matters in a special book and expected to have no trouble in  finding the man&rsquo;s name, James Wellgood, or that of his former employer But when  he came to consult this book, he was astonished to find that nothing was  recorded against this man&rsquo;s name but the date of his first employment&mdash;March 15. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  he hired him without a recommendation? He would not be likely to, yet the page  was clear of all reference; only the name and the date. But the date! You have  already noted its significance, and later he did, too. The day of the Ramsdell  ball! The day of the great murder! As he recalled the incidents of that day he  understood why the record of Wellgood&rsquo;s name was unaccompanied by the usual  reference. It had been a difficult day all round. The function was an important  one, and the weather bad. There was, besides, an unusual shortage in his number  of assistants. Two men had that very morning been laid up with sickness, and  when this able-looking, self-confident Wellgood presented himself for immediate  employment, he took him out of hand with the merest glance at what looked like  a very satisfactory reference. Later, he had intended to look up this  reference, which he had been careful to preserve by sticking it, along with  other papers, on his spike-file. But in the distractions following the untoward  events of the evening, he had neglected to do so, feeling perfectly satisfied  with the man&rsquo;s work and general behavior. Now it was a different thing. The man  had left him summarily, and he felt impelled to hunt up the person who had  recommended him and see whether this was the first time that Wellgood had  repaid good treatment with bad. Running through the papers with which his file  was now full, he found that the one he sought was not there. This roused him in  good earnest, for he was certain that he had not removed it himself and there  was no one else who had the right to do so. He suspected the culprit,&mdash;a young  lad who occasionally had access to his desk. But this boy was no longer in the  office. He had dismissed him for some petty fault the previous week, and it  took him several days to find him again. Meantime his anger grew and when he  finally came face to face with the lad, he accused him of the suspected trick  with so much vehemence that the inevitable happened, and the boy confessed.  This is what he acknowledged. He had taken the reference off the file, but only  to give it to Wellgood himself, who had offered him money for it. When asked  how much money, the boy admitted that the sum was ten dollars,&mdash;an extraordinary  amount from a poor man for so simple a service, if the man merely wished to  secure his reference for future use; so extraordinary that Mr. Jones grew more  and more pertinent in his inquiries, eliciting finally what he surely could not  have hoped for in the beginning,&mdash;the exact address of the party referred to in  the paper he had stolen, and which, for some reason, the boy remembered. It was  an uptown address, and, as soon as the caterer could leave his business, he  took the elevated and proceeded to the specified street and number. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Van Arsdale, a surprise awaited him, and awaited us when he told the result of  his search. The name attached to the recommendation had been&mdash;&lsquo;Hiram Sears,  Steward.&rsquo; He did not know of any such man&mdash;perhaps you do&mdash;but when he reached  the house from which the recommendation was dated, he saw that it was one of  the great houses of New York, though he could not at the instant remember who  lived there. But he soon found out. The first passer-by told him. Miss Van  Arsdale, perhaps you can do the same. The number was&mdash;Eighty-sixth Street.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;!&rdquo;  I repeated, quite aghast. &ldquo;Why, Mr. Fairbrother himself! The husband of&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly  so, and Hiram Sears, whose name you may have heard mentioned at the inquest,  though for a very good reason he was not there in person, is his steward and  general factotum.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  and it was he who recommended Wellgood?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did Mr. Jones see him?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  The house, you remember, is closed. Mr. Fairbrother, on leaving town, gave his  servants a vacation. His steward he took with him,&mdash;that is, they started  together. But we hear no mention made of him in our telegrams from Santa Fe. He  does not seem to have followed Mr. Fairbrother into the mountains.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say that in a peculiar way,&rdquo; I remarked. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  it has struck us peculiarly. Where is Sears now? And why did he not go on with  Mr. Fairbrother when he left home with every apparent intention of accompanying  him to the Placide mine? Miss Van Arsdale, we were impressed with this fact  when we heard of Mr. Fairbrother&rsquo;s lonely trip from where he was taken ill to  his mine outside of Santa Fe; but we have only given it its due importance  since hearing what has come to us to-day. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Van Arsdale,&rdquo; continued the inspector, as I looked up quickly, &ldquo;I am going to  show great confidence in you. I am going to tell you what our men have learned  about this Sears. As I have said before, it is but forestalling the reporters  by a day, and it may help you to understand why I sent you such peremptory  orders to stop, when your whole heart was fixed on an attempt by which you  hoped to right Mr. Durand. We can not afford to disturb so distinguished a  person as the one you have under your eye, while the least hope remains of  fixing this crime elsewhere. And we have such hope. This man, this Sears, is by  no means the simple character one would expect from his position. Considering  the short time we have had (it was only yesterday that Jones found his way into  this office), we have unearthed some very interesting facts in his regard. His  devotion to Mr. Fairbrother was never any secret, and we knew as much about  that the day after the murder as we do now. But the feelings with which he  regarded Mrs. Fairbrother&mdash;well, that is another thing&mdash;and it was not till last  night we heard that the attachment which bound him to her was of the sort which  takes no account of youth or age, fitness or unfitness. He was no Adonis, and  old enough, we are told, to be her father; but for all that we have already  found several persons who can tell strange stories of the persistence with which  his eager old eyes would follow her whenever chance threw them together during  the time she remained under her husband&rsquo;s roof; and others who relate, with  even more avidity, how, after her removal to apartments of her own, he used to  spend hours in the adjoining park just to catch a glimpse of her figure as she  crossed the sidewalk on her way to and from her carriage. Indeed, his  senseless, almost senile passion for this magnificent beauty became a by-word  in some mouths, and it only escaped being mentioned at the inquest from respect  to Mr. Fairbrother, who had never recognized this weakness in his steward, and  from its lack of visible connection with her horrible death and the stealing of  her great jewel. Nevertheless, we have a witness now&mdash;it is astonishing how many  witnesses we can scare up by a little effort, who never thought of coming  forward themselves&mdash;who can swear to having seen him one night shaking his fist  at her retreating figure as she stepped haughtily by him into her apartment  house. This witness is sure that the man he saw thus gesticulating was Sears,  and he is sure the woman was Mrs. Fairbrother. The only thing he is not sure of  is how his own wife will feel when she hears that he was in that particular  neighborhood on that particular evening, when he was evidently supposed to be  somewhere else.&rdquo; And the inspector laughed. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  the steward&rsquo;s disposition a bad one.&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;that this display of feeling  should impress you so much?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what to say about that yet. Opinions differ on this point. His  friends speak of him as the mildest kind of a man who, without native executive  skill, could not manage the great household he has in charge. His enemies, and  we have unearthed a few, say, on the contrary, that they have never had any confidence  in his quiet ways; that these were not in keeping with the fact or his having  been a California miner in the early fifties. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can see I am putting you very nearly where we are ourselves. Nor do I see why I  should not add that this passion of the seemingly subdued but really hot-headed  steward for a woman, who never showed him anything but what he might call an  insulting indifference, struck us as a clue to be worked up, especially after  we received this answer to a telegram we sent late last night to the nurse who  is caring for Mr. Fairbrother in New Mexico.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  handed me a small yellow slip and I read: </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;The  steward left Mr. Fairbrother at El Moro. He has not heard from him since. <br>
  &ldquo;ANNETTA  LA SERRA <br>
  &ldquo;For  Abner Fairbrother.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  El Moro?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Why, that was long enough ago&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  him to have reached New York before the murder. Exactly so, if he took  advantage of every close connection.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_14"></a>Chapter 14 <br>
Trapped</b></h2>
  <p>I  caught my breath sharply. I did not say anything. I felt that I did not  understand the inspector sufficiently yet to speak. He seemed to be pleased  with my reticence. At all events, his manner grew even kinder as he said: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  Sears is a witness we must have. He is being looked for now, high and low, and  we hope to get some clue to his whereabouts before night. That is, if he is in  this city. Meanwhile, we are all glad&mdash;I am sure you are also&mdash;to spare so  distinguished a gentleman as Mr. Grey the slightest annoyance.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mr. Durand? What of him in this interim?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will have to await developments. I see no other way, my dear.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was kindly said, but my head drooped. This waiting was what was killing him and  killing me. The inspector saw and gently patted my hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;you have head enough to see that it is never wise to force matters.&rdquo;  Then, possibly with an intention of rousing me, he remarked: &ldquo;There is another  small fact which may interest you. It concerns the waiter, Wellgood,  recommended, as you will remember, by this Sears. In my talk with Jones it  leaked out as a matter of small moment, and so it was to him, that this  Wellgood was the waiter who ran and picked up the diamond after it fell from  Mr. Grey&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  may mean nothing&mdash;it meant nothing to Jones&mdash;but I inform you of it because there  is a question I want to put to you in this connection. You smile.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I?&rdquo; I meekly answered. &ldquo;I do not know why.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  was not true. I had been waiting to see why the inspector had so honored me  with all these disclosures, almost with his thoughts. Now I saw. He desired  something in return. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were on the scene at this very moment,&rdquo; he proceeded, after a brief  contemplation of my face, &ldquo;and you must have seen this man when he lifted the  jewel and handed it back to Mr. Grey. Did you remark his features?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir; I was too far off; besides, my eyes were on Mr. Grey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is a pity. I  was in hopes you could satisfy me on a very important point.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  point is that, Inspector Dalzell?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whether  he answered the following description.&rdquo; And, taking up another paper, he was  about to read it aloud to me, when an interruption occurred. A man showed  himself at the door, whom the inspector no sooner recognized than he seemed to  forget me in his eagerness to interrogate him. Perhaps the appearance of the  latter had something to do with it; he looked as if he had been running, or had  been the victim of some extraordinary adventure. At all events, the inspector  arose as he entered, and was about to question him when he remembered me, and,  casting about for some means of ridding himself of my presence without injury  to my feelings, he suddenly pushed open the door of an adjoining room and  requested me to step inside while he talked a moment with this man. </p>
  <p>Of  course I went, but I cast him an appealing look as I did so. It evidently had  its effect, for his expression changed as his hand fell on the doorknob. Would  he snap the lock tight, and so shut me out from what concerned me as much as it  did any one in the whole world? Or would he recognize my anxiety&mdash;the necessity I  was under of knowing just the ground I was standing on&mdash;and let me hear what  this man had to report? </p>
  <p>I  watched the door. It closed slowly, too slowly to latch. Would he catch it anew  by the knob? No; he left it thus, and, while the crack was hardly perceptible,  I felt confident that the least shake of the floor would widen it and give me  the opportunity I sought. But I did not have to wait for this. The two men in  the office I had just left began to speak, and to my unbounded relief were  sufficiently intelligible, even now, to warrant me in giving them my fullest  attention. </p>
  <p>After  some expressions of astonishment on the part of the inspector as to the plight  in which the other presented himself, the latter broke out: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  just escaped death! I&rsquo;ll tell you about that later. What I want to tell you now  is that the man we want is in town. I saw him last night, or his shadow, which  is the same thing. It was in the house in Eighty-sixth Street,&mdash;the house they  all think closed. He came in with a key and&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!  You have him?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  It&rsquo;s a long story, sir&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  it!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  tone was dry. The inspector was evidently disappointed. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  blame me till you hear,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;He is no common crook. This is how it  was: You wanted the suspect&rsquo;s photograph and a specimen of his writing. I knew  no better place to look for them than in his own room in Mr. Fairbrother&rsquo;s  house. I accordingly got the necessary warrant and late last evening undertook  the job. I went alone&mdash;I was always an egotistical chap, more&rsquo;s the pity&mdash;and  with no further precaution than a passing explanation to the officer I met at  the corner, I hastened up the block to the rear entrance on Eighty-seventh  Street. There are three doors to the Fairbrother house, as you probably know.  Two on Eighty-sixth Street (the large front one and a small one connecting  directly with the turret stairs), and one on Eighty-seventh Street. It was to  the latter I had a key. I do not think any one saw me go in. It was raining,  and such people as went by were more concerned in keeping their umbrellas  properly over their heads than in watching men skulking about in doorways. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  got in, then, all right, and, being careful to close the door behind me, went  up the first short flight of steps to what I knew must be the main hall. I had  been given a plan of the interior, and I had studied it more or less before  starting out, but I knew that I should get lost if I did not keep to the rear  staircase, at the top of which I expected to find the steward&rsquo;s room. There was  a faint light in the house, in spite of its closed shutters and tightly-drawn  shades; and, having a certain dread of using my torch, knowing my weakness for  pretty things and how hard it would be for me to pass so many fine rooms  without looking in, I made my way up stairs, with no other guide than the  hand-rail. When I had reached what I took to be the third floor I stopped.  Finding it very dark, I first listened&mdash;a natural instinct with us&mdash;then I lit up  and looked about me. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was in a large hall, empty as a vault and almost as desolate. Blank doors met  my eyes in all directions, with here and there an open passageway. I felt  myself in a maze. I had no idea which was the door I sought, and it is not  pleasant to turn unaccustomed knobs in a shut-up house at midnight, with the  rain pouring in torrents and the wind making pandemonium in a half-dozen great  chimneys. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it had to be done, and I went at it in regular order till I came to a little  narrow one opening on the turret-stair. This gave me my bearings. Sears&rsquo; room  adjoined the staircase. There was no difficulty in spotting the exact door now  and, merely stopping to close the opening I had made to this little staircase,  I crossed to this door and flung it open. I had been right in my calculations.  It was the steward&rsquo;s room, and I made at once for the desk.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you found&mdash;?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mostly  locked drawers. But a key on my bunch opened some of these and my knife the  rest. Here are the specimens of his handwriting which I collected. I doubt if  you will get much out of them. I saw nothing compromising in the whole room,  but then I hadn&rsquo;t time to go through his trunks, and one of them looked very  interesting,&mdash;old as the hills and&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  hadn&rsquo;t time? Why hadn&rsquo;t you time? What happened to cut it short?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  sir, I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo; The tone in which this was said roused me if it did not  the inspector. &ldquo;I had just come from the desk which had disappointed me, and  was casting a look about the room, which was as bare as my hand of everything  like ornament&mdash;I might almost say comfort&mdash;when I heard a noise which was not  that of swishing rain or even gusty wind&mdash;these had not been absent from my ears  for a moment. I didn&rsquo;t like that noise; it had a sneakish sound, and I shut my  light off in a hurry. After that I crept hastily out of the room, for I don&rsquo;t  like a set-to in a trap. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was darker than ever now in the hall, or so it seemed, and as I backed away I  came upon a jog in the wall, behind which I crept. For the sound I had heard  was no fancy. Some one besides myself was in the house, and that some one was  coming up the little turret-stair, striking matches as he approached. Who could  it be? A detective from the district attorney&rsquo;s office? I hardly thought so. He  would have been provided with something better than matches to light his way. A  burglar? No, not on the third floor of a house as rich as this. Some fellow on  the force, then, who had seen me come in and, by some trick of his own, had  managed to follow me? I would see. Meantime I kept my place behind the jog and  watched, not knowing which way the intruder would go. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whoever  he was, he was evidently astonished to see the turret door ajar, for he lit  another match as he threw it open and, though I failed to get a glimpse of his  figure, I succeeded in getting a very good one of his shadow. It was one to  arouse a detective&rsquo;s instinct at once. I did not say to myself, this is the man  I want, but I did say, this is nobody from headquarters, and I steadied myself  for whatever might turn up. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  first thing that happened was the sudden going out of the match which had made  this shadow visible. The intruder did not light another. I heard him move  across the floor with the rapid step of one who knows his way well, and the  next minute a gas-jet flared up in the steward&rsquo;s room, and I knew that the man  the whole force was looking for had trapped himself. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will agree that it was not my duty to take him then and there without seeing  what he was after. He was thought to be in the eastern states, or south or  west, and he was here; but why here? That is what I knew you would want to  know, and it was just what I wanted to know myself. So I kept my place, which  was good enough, and just listened, for I could not see. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was his errand? What did he want in this empty house at midnight? Papers first,  and then clothes. I heard him at his desk, I heard him in the closet, and  afterward pottering in the old trunk I had been so anxious to look into myself.  He must have brought the key with him, for it was no time before I heard him  throwing out the contents in a wild search for something he wanted in a great  hurry. He found it sooner than you would believe, and began throwing the things  back, when something happened. Expectedly or unexpectedly, his eye fell on some  object which roused all his passions, and he broke into loud exclamations  ending in groans. Finally he fell to kissing this object with a fervor  suggesting rage, and a rage suggesting tenderness carried to the point of  agony. I have never heard the like; my curiosity was so aroused that I was on  the point of risking everything for a look, when he gave a sudden snarl and  cried out, loud enough for me to hear: &lsquo;<i>Kiss what I&rsquo;ve hated? That is as bad as  to kill what I&rsquo;ve loved</i>.&rsquo; Those were the words. I am sure he said <i>kiss</i> and I am  sure he said<i> kill</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is very interesting. Go on with your story. Why didn&rsquo;t you collar him while he  was in this mood? You would have won by the surprise. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had no pistol, sir, and he had. I heard him cock it. I thought he was going to  take his own life, and held my breath for the report. But nothing like that was  in his mind. Instead, he laid the pistol down and deliberately tore in two the  object of his anger. Then with a smothered curse he made for the door and  turret staircase. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was for following, but not till I had seen what he had destroyed in such an  excess of feeling. I thought I knew, but I wanted to feel sure. So, before  risking myself in the turret, I crept to the room he had left and felt about on  the floor till I came upon these.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  torn photograph! Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Have you not heard how he loved her? A foolish passion, but evidently sincere  and&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind comments, Sweetwater. Stick to facts.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will, sir. They are interesting enough. After I had picked up these scraps I  stole back to the turret staircase. And here I made my first break. I stumbled  in the darkness, and the man below heard me, for the pistol clicked again. I  did not like this, and had some thoughts of backing out of my job. But I  didn&rsquo;t. I merely waited till I heard his step again; then I followed. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  very warily this time. It was not an agreeable venture. It was like descending  into a well with possible death at the bottom. I could see nothing and  presently could hear nothing but the almost imperceptible sliding of my own  fingers down the curve of the wall, which was all I had to guide me. Had he  stopped midway, and would my first intimation of his presence be the touch of  cold steel or the flinging around me of two murderous arms? I had met with no  break in the smooth surface of the wall, so could not have reached the second  story. When I should get there the question would be whether to leave the  staircase and seek him in the mazes of its great rooms, or to keep on down to  the parlor floor and so to the street, whither he was possibly bound. I own  that I was almost tempted to turn on my light and have done with it, but I  remembered of how little use I should be to you lying in this well of a  stairway with a bullet in me, and so I managed to compose myself and go on as I  had begun. Next instant my fingers slipped round the edge of an opening, and I  knew that the moment of decision had come. Realizing that no one can move so  softly that he will not give away his presence in some way, I paused for the  sound which I knew must come, and when a click rose from the depths of the hall  before me I plunged into that hall and thus into the house proper. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  it was not so dark; yet I could make out none of the objects I now and then ran  against. I passed a mirror (I hardly know how I knew it to be such), and in  that mirror I seemed to see the ghost of a ghost flit by and vanish. It was too  much. I muttered a suppressed oath and plunged forward, when I struck against a  closing door. It flew open again and I rushed in, turning on my light in my  extreme desperation, when, instead of hearing the sharp report of a pistol, as  I expected, I saw a second door fall to before me, this time with a sound like  the snap of a spring lock. Finding that this was so, and that all advance was  barred that way, I wheeled hurriedly back toward the door by which I had  entered the place, to find that that had fallen to simultaneously with the  other, a single spring acting for both. I was trapped&mdash;a prisoner in the  strangest sort of passageway or closet; and, as a speedy look about presently  assured me, a prisoner with very little hope of immediate escape, for the doors  were not only immovable, without even locks to pick or panels to break in, but  the place was bare of windows, and the only communication which it could be  said to have with the outside world at all was a shaft rising from the ceiling  almost to the top of the house. Whether this served as a ventilator, or a means  of lighting up the hole when both doors were shut, it was much too inaccessible  to offer any apparent way of escape. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  was a man more thoroughly boxed in. As I realized how little chance there was  of any outside interference, how my captor, even if he was seen leaving the  house by the officer on duty, would be taken for myself and so allowed to  escape, I own that I felt my position a hopeless one. But anger is a powerful  stimulant, and I was mortally angry, not only with Sears, but with myself. So  when I was done swearing I took another look around, and, finding that there was  no getting through the walls, turned my attention wholly to the shaft, which  would certainly lead me out of the place if I could only find means to mount  it. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how do you think I managed to do this at last? A look at my bedraggled,  lime-covered clothes may give you some idea. I cut a passage for myself up  those perpendicular walls as the boy did up the face of the natural bridge in  Virginia. Do you remember that old story in the <i>Reader?</i> It came to me like an  inspiration as I stood looking up from below, and though I knew that I should  have to work most of the way in perfect darkness, I decided that a man&rsquo;s life  was worth some risk, and that I had rather fall and break my neck while doing  something than to spend hours in maddening inactivity, only to face death at  last from slow starvation. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had a knife, an exceedingly good knife, in my pocket&mdash;and for the first few  steps I should have the light of my electric torch. The difficulty (that is,  the first difficulty) was to reach the shaft from the floor where I stood.  There was but one article of furniture in the room, and that was something  between a table and a desk. No chairs, and the desk was not high enough to  enable me to reach the mouth of the shaft. If I could turn it on end there  might be some hope. But this did not look feasible. However, I threw off my  coat and went at the thing with a vengeance, and whether I was given superhuman  power or whether the clumsy thing was not as heavy as it looked, I did finally  succeed in turning it on its end close under the opening from which the shaft  rose. The next thing was to get on its top. That seemed about as impossible as  climbing the bare wall itself, but presently I bethought me of the drawers,  and, though they were locked, I did succeed by the aid of my keys to get enough  of them open to make for myself a very good pair of stairs. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could now see my way to the mouth of the shaft, but after that! Taking out my  knife, I felt the edge. It was a good one, so was the point, but was it good  enough to work holes in plaster? It depended somewhat upon the plaster. Had the  masons, in finishing that shaft, any thought of the poor wretch who one day  would have to pit his life against the hardness of the final covering? My first  dig at it would tell. I own I trembled violently at the prospect of what that  first test would mean to me, and wondered if the perspiration which I felt  starting at every pore was the result of the effort I had been engaged in or  just plain fear. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inspector,  I do not intend to have you live with me through the five mortal hours which  followed. I was enabled to pierce that plaster with my knife, and even to  penetrate deep enough to afford a place for the tips of my fingers and  afterward for the point of my toes, digging, prying, sweating, panting,  listening, first for a sudden opening of the doors beneath, then for some shout  or wicked interference from above as I worked my way up inch by inch, foot by  foot, to what might not be safety after it was attained. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  hours&mdash;six. Then I struck something which proved to be a window; and when I  realized this and knew that with but one more effort I should breathe freely  again, I came as near falling as I had at any time before I began this terrible  climb. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Happily,  I had some premonition of my danger, and threw myself into a position which  held me till the dizzy minute passed. Then I went calmly on with my work, and  in another half-hour had reached the window, which, fortunately for me, not  only opened inward, but was off the latch. It was with a sense of inexpressible  relief that I clambered through this window and for a brief moment breathed in  the pungent odor of cedar. But it could have been only for a moment. It was  three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon before I found myself again in the outer air.  The only way I can account for the lapse of time is that the strain to which  both body and nerve had been subjected was too much for even my hardy body and  that I fell to the floor of the cedar closet and from a faint went into a sleep  that lasted until two. I can easily account for the last hour because it took  me that long to cut the thick paneling from the door of the closet. However, I  am here now, sir, and in very much the same condition in which I left that  house. I thought my first duty was to tell you that I had seen Hiram Sears in  that house last night and put you on his track.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  drew a long breath,&mdash;I think the inspector did. I had been almost rigid from  excitement, and I don&rsquo;t believe he was quite free from it either. But his voice  was calmer than I expected when he finally said: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  remember this. It was a good night&rsquo;s work.&rdquo; Then the inspector put to him some  questions, which seemed to fix the fact that Sears had left the house before  Sweetwater did, after which he bade him send certain men to him and then go and  fix himself up. </p>
  <p>I  believe he had forgotten me. I had almost forgotten myself. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_15"></a>Chapter 15 <br>
    Sears Or Wellgood</b></h2>
  <p>Not  till the inspector had given several orders was I again summoned into his  presence. He smiled as our eyes met, but did not allude, any more than I did,  to what had just passed. Nevertheless, we understood each other. </p>
  <p>When  I was again seated, he took up the conversation where we had left it. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  description I was just about to read to you,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;will you listen to  it now?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo;  said I; &ldquo;it is Wellgood&rsquo;s, I believe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  did not answer save by a curious glance from under his brows, but, taking the  paper again from his desk, went on reading: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man of fifty-five looking like one of sixty. Medium height, insignificant  features, head bald save for a ring of scanty dark hair. No beard, a heavy  nose, long mouth and sleepy half-shut eyes capable of shooting strange glances.  Nothing distinctive in face or figure save the depth of his wrinkles and a  scarcely observable stoop in his right shoulder. Do you see Wellgood in that?&rdquo;  he suddenly asked. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have only the faintest recollection of his appearance,&rdquo; was my doubtful reply.  &ldquo;But the impression I get from this description is not exactly the one I  received of that waiter in the momentary glimpse I got of him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  others have told me before;&rdquo; he remarked, looking very disappointed. &ldquo;The  description is of Sears given me by a man who knew him well, and if we could  fit the description of the one to that of the other, we should have it easy.  But the few persons who have seen Wellgood differ greatly in their remembrance  of his features, and even of his coloring. It is astonishing how superficially  most people see a man, even when they are thrown into daily contact with him.  Mr. Jones says the man&rsquo;s eyes are gray, his hair a wig and dark, his nose  pudgy, and his face without much expression. His land-lady, that his eyes are  blue, his hair, whether wig or not, a dusty auburn, and his look quick and  piercing,&mdash;a look which always made her afraid. His nose she don&rsquo;t remember.  Both agree, or rather all agree, that he wore no beard&mdash;Sears did, but a beard  can be easily taken off&mdash;and all of them declare that they would know him  instantly if they saw him. And so the matter stands. Even you can give me no  definite description,&mdash;one, I mean, as satisfactory or unsatisfactory as this of  Sears.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  shook my head. Like the others, I felt that I should know him if I saw him, but  I could go no further than that. There seemed to be so little that was  distinctive about the man. </p>
  <p>The  inspector, hoping, perhaps, that all this would serve to rouse my memory,  shrugged his shoulders and put the best face he could on the matter. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we shall have to be patient. A day may make all the difference  possible in our outlook. If we can lay hands on either of these men&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  seemed to realize he had said a word too much, for he instantly changed the  subject by asking if I had succeeded in getting a sample of Miss Grey&rsquo;s  writing. I was forced to say no; that everything had been very carefully put  away. &ldquo;But I do not know what moment I may come upon it,&rdquo; I added. &ldquo;I do not  forget its importance in this investigation.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. Those lines handed up to Mrs. Fairbrother from the walk outside are the  second most valuable clue we possess.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  did not ask him what the first was. I knew. It was the stiletto. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strange  that no one has testified to that handwriting,&rdquo; I remarked. </p>
  <p>He  looked at me in surprise. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty  persons have sent in samples of writing which they think like it,&rdquo; he observed.  &ldquo;Often of persons who never heard of the Fairbrothers. We have been bothered  greatly with the business. You know little of the difficulties the police labor  under.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know too much,&rdquo; I sighed. </p>
  <p>He  smiled and patted me on the hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  back to your patient,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Forget every other duty but that of your  calling until you get some definite word from me. I shall not keep you in  suspense one minute longer than is absolutely necessary.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  had risen. I rose too. But I was not satisfied. I could not leave the room with  my ideas (I might say with my convictions) in such a turmoil. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inspector,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;you will think me very obstinate, but all you have told me about  Sears, all I have heard about him, in fact,&rdquo;&mdash;this I emphasized,&mdash;&ldquo;does not  convince me of the entire folly of my own suspicions. Indeed, I am afraid that,  if anything, they are strengthened. This steward, who is a doubtful character,  I acknowledge, may have had his reasons for wishing Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s death,  may even have had a hand in the matter; but what evidence have you to show that  he, himself, entered the alcove, struck the blow or stole the diamond? I have  listened eagerly for some such evidence, but I have listened in vain.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I know. But it will come; at least I think so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  should have reassured me, no doubt, and sent me away quiet and happy. But  something&mdash;the tenacity of a deep conviction, possibly&mdash;kept me lingering before  the inspector and finally gave me the courage to say: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know I ought not to speak another word; that I am putting myself at a  disadvantage in doing so; but I can not help it, Inspector; I can not help it  when I see you laying such stress upon the few indirect clues connecting the  suspicious Sears with this crime, and ignoring the direct clues we have against  one whom we need not name.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Had  I gone too far? Had my presumption transgressed all bounds and would he show a  very natural anger? No, he smiled instead, an enigmatical smile, no doubt,  which I found it difficult to understand, but yet a smile. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;that Sears&rsquo; possible connection with the crime can not  eliminate Mr. Grey&rsquo;s very positive one; nor can the fact that Wellgood&rsquo;s hand  came in contact with Mr. Grey&rsquo;s, at or near the time of the exchange of the  false stone with the real, make it any less evident who was the guilty author  of this exchange?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  inspector&rsquo;s hand was on the door-knob, but he dropped it at this, and surveying  me very quietly said: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought that a few days spent at the bedside of Miss Grey in the society of so  renowned and cultured a gentleman as her father would disabuse you of these  damaging suspicions.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t wonder that you thought so,&rdquo; I burst out. &ldquo;You would think so all the  more, if you knew how kind he can be and what solicitude he shows for all about  him. But I can not get over the facts. They all point, it seems to me, straight  in one direction.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;All?  You heard what was said in this room&mdash;I saw it in your eye&mdash;how the man, who  surprised the steward in his own room last night, heard him talking of love and  death in connection with Mrs. Fairbrother. &lsquo;To kiss what I hate! It is almost  as bad as to kill what I love&rsquo;&mdash;he said something like that.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I heard that. But did he mean that he had been her actual slayer? Could you  convict him on those words?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we shall find out. Then, as to Wellgood&rsquo;s part in the little business, you  choose to consider that it took place at the time the stone fell from Mr.  Grey&rsquo;s hand. What proof have you that the substitution you believe in was not  made by him? He could easily have done it while crossing the room to Mr. Grey&rsquo;s  side.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inspector!&rdquo;  Then hotly, as the absurdity of the suggestion struck me with full force: &ldquo;<i>He</i>  do this! A waiter, or as you think, Mr. Fairbrother&rsquo;s steward, to be provided  with so hard-to-come-by an article as this counterpart of a great stone? Isn&rsquo;t  that almost as incredible a supposition as any I have myself presumed to  advance?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly,  but the affair is full of incredibilities, the greatest of which, to my mind,  is the persistence with which you, a kind-hearted enough little woman,  persevere in ascribing the deepest guilt to one you profess to admire and  certainly would be glad to find innocent of any complicity with a great crime.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  felt that I must justify myself. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Durand has had no such consideration shown him,&rdquo; said I. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, my child, I know; but the cases differ. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be well for you to  see this and be satisfied with the turn which things have taken, without  continuing to insist upon involving Mr. Grey in your suspicions?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A  smile took off the edge of this rebuke, yet I felt it keenly; and only the  confidence I had in his fairness as a man and public official enabled me to  say: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I am talking quite confidentially. And you have been so good to me, so willing  to listen to all I had to say, that I can not help but speak my whole mind. It  is my only safety valve. Remember how I have to sit in the presence of this man  with my thoughts all choked up. It is killing me. But I think I should go back  content if you will listen to one more suggestion I have to make. It is my  last.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  it I am nothing if not indulgent.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  had spoken the word. Indulgent, that was it. He let me speak, probably had let  me speak from the first, from pure kindness. He did not believe one little bit  in my good sense or logic. But I was not to be deterred. I would empty my mind  of the ugly thing that lay there. I would leave there no miserable dregs of  doubt to ferment and work their evil way with me in the dead watches of the  night, which I had yet to face. So I took him at his word. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only want to ask this. In case Sears is innocent of the crime, who wrote the  warning and where did the assassin get the stiletto with the Grey arms chased  into its handle? And the diamond? Still the diamond! You hint that he stole  that, too. That with some idea of its proving useful to him on this gala  occasion, he had provided himself with an imitation stone, setting and all,&mdash;he  who has never shown, so far as we have heard, any interest in Mrs.  Fairbrother&rsquo;s diamond, only in Mrs. Fairbrother herself. If Wellgood is Sears  and Sears the medium by which the false stone was exchanged for the real, then  he made this exchange in Mr. Grey&rsquo;s interests and not his own. But I don&rsquo;t  believe he had anything to do with it. I think everything goes to show that the  exchange was made by Mr. Grey himself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  second Daniel,&rdquo; muttered the inspector lightly. &ldquo;Go on, little lawyer!&rdquo; But for  all this attempt at banter on his part, I imagined that I saw the beginning of  a very natural anxiety to close the conversation. I therefore hastened with  what I had yet to say, cutting my words short and almost stammering in my  eagerness. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember  the perfection of that imitation stone, a copy so exact that it extends to the  setting. That shows plan&mdash;forgive me if I repeat myself&mdash;preparation, a knowledge  of stones, a particular knowledge of this one. Mr. Fairbrother&rsquo;s steward may  have had the knowledge, but he would have been a fool to have used his  knowledge to secure for himself a valuable he could never have found a  purchaser for in any market. But a fancier&mdash;one who has his pleasure in the mere  possession of a unique and invaluable gem&mdash;ah! that is different! <i>He</i> might risk  a crime&mdash;history tells us of several.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Here  I paused to take breath, which gave the inspector chance to say: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  other words, this is what you think. The Englishman, desirous of covering up  his tracks, conceived the idea of having this imitation on hand, in case it  might be of use in the daring and disgraceful undertaking you ascribe to him.  Recognizing his own inability to do this himself, he delegated the task to one  who in some way, he had been led to think, cherished a secret grudge against  its present possessor&mdash;a man who had had some opportunity for seeing the stone  and studying the setting. The copy thus procured, Mr. Grey went to the ball,  and, relying on his own seemingly unassailable position, attacked Mrs.  Fairbrother in the alcove and would have carried off the diamond, if he had  found it where he had seen it earlier blazing on her breast. But it was not  there. The warning received by her&mdash;a warning you ascribe to his daughter, a  fact which is yet to be proved&mdash;had led her to rid herself of the jewel in the  way Mr. Durand describes, and he found himself burdened with a dastardly crime  and with nothing to show for it. Later, however, to his intense surprise and  possible satisfaction, he saw that diamond in my hands, and, recognizing an  opportunity, as he thought, of yet securing it, he asked to see it, held it for  an instant, and then, making use of an almost incredible expedient for  distracting attention, dropped, not the real stone but the false one, retaining  the real one in his hand. This, in plain English, as I take it, is your present  idea of the situation.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Astonished  at the clearness with which he read my mind, I answered: &ldquo;Yes, Inspector, that  is what was in my mind.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  then it is just as well that it is out. Your mind is now free and you can give  it entirely to your duties.&rdquo; Then, as he laid his hand on the door-knob, he  added: &ldquo;In studying so intently your own point of view, you seem to have  forgotten that the last thing which Mr. Grey would be likely to do, under those  circumstances, would be to call attention to the falsity of the gem upon whose  similarity to the real stone he was depending. Not even his confidence in his  own position, as an honored and highly-esteemed guest, would lead him to do  that.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if he were a well-known connoisseur,&rdquo; I faltered, &ldquo;with the pride of one who  has handled the best gems? He would know that the deception would be soon  discovered and that it would not do for him to fail to recognize it for what it  was, when the make-believe was in his hands.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forced,  my dear child, forced; and as chimerical as all the rest. It can not stand  putting into words. I will go further,&mdash;you are a good girl and can bear to hear  the truth from me. I don&rsquo;t believe in your theory; I can&rsquo;t. I have not been  able to from the first, nor have any of my men; but if your ideas are true and  Mr. Grey is involved in this matter, you will find that there has been more of  a hitch about that diamond than you, in your simplicity, believe. If Mr. Grey  were in actual possession of this valuable, he would show less care than you  say he does. So would he if it were in Wellgood&rsquo;s hands with his consent and a  good prospect of its coming to him in the near future. But if it is in  Wellgood&rsquo;s hands without his consent, or any near prospect of his regaining it,  then we can easily understand his present apprehensions and the growing  uneasiness he betrays.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo;  I murmured. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If,  then,&rdquo; the inspector pursued, giving me a parting glance not without its humor,  probably not without something really serious underlying its humor, &ldquo;we should  find, in following up our present clue, that Mr. Grey has had dealings with  this Wellgood or this Sears; or if you, with your advantages for learning the  fact, should discover that he shows any extraordinary interest in either of  them, the matter will take on a different aspect. But we have not got that far  yet. At present our task is to find one or the other of these men. If we are  lucky, we shall discover that the waiter and the steward are identical, in  spite of their seemingly different appearance. A rogue, such as this Sears has  shown himself to be, would be an adept at disguise.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right,&rdquo; I acknowledged. &ldquo;He has certainly the heart of a criminal. If he  had no hand in Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s murder, he came near having one in that of  your detective. You know what I mean. I could not help hearing, Inspector.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  smiled, looked me steadfastly in the face for a moment, and then bowed me out. </p>
  <p>The  inspector told me afterward that, in spite of the cavalier manner with which he  had treated my suggestions, he spent a very serious half-hour, head to head  with the district attorney. The result was the following order to Sweetwater,  the detective. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are to go to the St. Regis; make yourself solid there, and gradually, as you can  manage it, work yourself into a position for knowing all that goes on in Room &mdash;.  If the gentleman (mind you, the gentleman; we care nothing about the women)  should go out, you are to follow him if it takes you to&mdash;. We want to know his  secret; but he must never know our interest in it and you are to be as silent  in this matter as if possessed of neither ear nor tongue. I will add memory,  for if you find this secret to be one in which we have no lawful interest, you  are to forget it absolutely and for ever. You will understand why when you  consult the St Regis register.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>But  they expected nothing from it; absolutely nothing. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_16"></a>Chapter 16 <br>
    Doubt</b></h2>
  <p>I  prayed uncle that we might be driven home by the way of Eighty-sixth Street. I  wanted to look at the Fairbrother house. I had seen it many times, but I felt  that I should see it with new eyes after the story I had just heard in the  inspector&rsquo;s office. That an adventure of this nature could take place in a New  York house taxed my credulity. I might have believed it of Paris, wicked,  mysterious Paris, the home of intrigue and every redoubtable crime, but of our  own homely, commonplace metropolis&mdash;the house must be seen for me to be  convinced of the fact related. </p>
  <p>Many  of you know the building. It is usually spoken of with a shrug, the sole reason  for which seems to be that there is no other just like it in the city. I myself  have always considered it imposing and majestic; but to the average man it is  too suggestive of Old-World feudal life to be pleasing. On this afternoon&mdash;a  dull, depressing one&mdash;it looked undeniably heavy as we approached it; but  interesting in a very new way to me, because of the great turret at one angle,  the scene of that midnight descent of two men, each in deadly fear of the  other, yet quailing not in their purpose,&mdash;the one of flight, the other of  pursuit. </p>
  <p>There  was no railing in front of the house. It may have seemed an unnecessary  safeguard to the audacious owner. Consequently, the small door in the turret  opened directly upon the street, making entrance and exit easy enough for any  one who had the key. But the shaft and the small room at the bottom&mdash;where were  they? Naturally in the center of the great mass, the room being without  windows. </p>
  <p>It  was, therefore, useless to look for it, and yet my eye ran along the peaks and  pinnacles of the roof, searching for the skylight in which it undoubtedly  ended. At last I espied it, and, my curiosity satisfied on this score, I let my  eyes run over the side and face of the building for an open window or a lifted  shade. But all were tightly closed and gave no more sign of life than did the  boarded-up door. But I was not deceived by this. As we drove away, I thought  how on the morrow there would be a regular procession passing through this  street to see just the little I had seen to-day. The detective&rsquo;s adventure was  like to make the house notorious. For several minutes after I had left its  neighborhood my imagination pictured room after room shut up from the light of  day, but bearing within them the impalpable aura of those two shadows flitting  through them like the ghosts of ghosts, as the detective had tellingly put it. </p>
  <p>The  heart has its strange surprises. Through my whole ride and the indulgence in  these thoughts I was conscious of a great inner revulsion against all I had  intimated and even honestly felt while talking with the inspector. Perhaps this  is what this wise old official expected. He had let me talk, and the inevitable  reaction followed. I could now see only Mr. Grey&rsquo;s goodness and claims to  respect, and began to hate myself that I had not been immediately impressed by  the inspector&rsquo;s views, and shown myself more willing to drop every suspicion  against the august personage I had presumed to associate with crime. What had  given me the strength to persist? Loyalty to my lover? His innocence had not  been involved. Indeed, every word uttered in the inspector&rsquo;s office had gone to  prove that he no longer occupied a leading place in police calculations: that  their eyes were turned elsewhere, and that I had only to be patient to see Mr.  Durand quite cleared in their minds. </p>
  <p>But  was this really so? Was he as safe as that? What if this new clue failed? What  if they failed to find Sears or lay hands on the doubtful Wellgood? Would Mr.  Durand be released without a trial? Should we hear nothing more of the strange  and to many the suspicious circumstances which linked him to this crime? It  would be expecting too much from either police or official discrimination. </p>
  <p>No;  Mr. Durand would never be completely exonerated till the true culprit was found  and all explanations made. I had therefore been simply fighting his battles  when I pointed out what I thought to be the weak place in their present theory,  and, sore as I felt in contemplation of my seemingly heartless action, I was  not the unimpressionable, addle-pated nonentity I must have seemed to the  inspector. </p>
  <p>Yet  my comfort was small and the effort it took to face Mr. Grey and my young  patient was much greater than I had anticipated. I blushed as I approached to  take my place at Miss Grey&rsquo;s bedside, and, had her father been as suspicious of  me at that moment as I was of him, I am sure that I should have fared badly in  his thoughts. </p>
  <p>But  he was not on the watch for my emotions. He was simply relieved to see me back.  I noticed this immediately, also that something had occurred during my absence  which absorbed his thought and filled him with anxiety. </p>
  <p>A  Western Union envelope lay at his feet,&mdash;proof that he had just received a  telegram. This, under ordinary circumstances, would not have occasioned me a  second thought, such a man being naturally the recipient of all sorts of  communications from all parts of the world; but at this crisis, with the worm  of a half-stifled doubt still gnawing at my heart, everything that occurred to  him took on importance and roused questions. </p>
  <p>When  he had left the room, Miss Grey nestled up to me with the seemingly ingenuous  remark: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  papa! something disturbs him. He will not tell me what. I suppose he thinks I  am not strong enough to share his troubles. But I shall be soon. Don&rsquo;t you see  I am gaining every day?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  I do,&rdquo; was my hearty response. In face of such a sweet confidence and open  affection doubt vanished and I was able to give all my thoughts to her. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish papa felt as sure of this as you do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For some reason he does  not seem to take any comfort from my improvement. When Doctor Freligh says,  &lsquo;Well, well! we are getting on finely to-day,&rsquo; I notice that he does not look  less anxious, nor does he even meet these encouraging words with a smile.  Haven&rsquo;t you noticed it? He looks as care-worn and troubled about me now as he  did the first day I was taken sick. Why should he? Is it because he has lost so  many children he can not believe in his good fortune at having the most insignificant  of all left to him?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know your father very well,&rdquo; I protested; &ldquo;and can not judge what is  going on in his mind. But he must see that you are quite a different girl from  what you were a week ago, and that, if nothing unforeseen happens, your  recovery will only be a matter of a week or two longer.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  how I love to hear you say that! To be well again! To read letters!&rdquo; she  murmured, &ldquo;and to write them!&rdquo; And I saw the delicate hand falter up to pinch  the precious packet awaiting that happy hour. I did not like to discuss her  father with her, so took this opportunity to turn the conversation aside into  safer channels. But we had not proceeded far before Mr. Grey returned and,  taking his stand at the foot of the bed, remarked, after a moment&rsquo;s gloomy  contemplation of his daughter&rsquo;s face: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are better today, the doctor says,&mdash;I have just been telephoning to him. But do  you feel well enough for me to leave you for a few days? There is a man I must  see&mdash;must go to, if you have no dread of being left alone with your good nurse  and the doctor&rsquo;s constant attendance.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Miss  Grey looked startled. Doubtless she found it difficult to understand what man  in this strange country could interest her father enough to induce him to leave  her while he was yet laboring under such solicitude. But a smile speedily took  the place of her look of surprised inquiry and she affectionately exclaimed: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I haven&rsquo;t the least dread in the world, not now. See, I can hold up my arms.  Go, papa, go; it will give me a chance to surprise you with my good looks when  you come back.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  turned abruptly away. He was suffering from an emotion deeper than he cared to  acknowledge. But he gained control over himself speedily and, coming back,  announced with forced decision: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall have to go to-night. I have no choice. Promise me that you will not go  back in my absence; that you will strive to get well; that you will put all  your mind into striving to get well.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  I will,&rdquo; she answered, a little frightened by the feeling he showed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  worry so much. I have more than one reason for living, papa.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  shook his head and went immediately to make his preparations for departure. His  daughter gave one sob, then caught me by the hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look dumfounded,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But never mind, we shall get on very well  together. I have the most perfect confidence in you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Was  it my duty to let the inspector know that Mr. Grey anticipated absenting  himself from the city for a few days? I decided that I would only be impressing  my own doubts upon him after a rebuke which should have allayed them. </p>
  <p>Yet,  when Mr. Grey came to take his departure I wished that the inspector might have  been a witness to his emotion, if only to give me one of his very excellent  explanations. The parting was more like that of one who sees no immediate  promise of return than of a traveler who intends to limit his stay to a few  days. He looked her in the eyes and kissed her a dozen times, each time with an  air of heartbreak which was good neither for her nor for himself, and when he  finally tore himself away it was to look back at her from the door with an  expression I was glad she did not see, or it would certainly have interfered  with the promise she had made to concentrate all her energies on getting well. </p>
  <p>What  was at the root of his extreme grief at leaving her? Did he fear the person he  was going to meet, or were his plans such as involved a much longer stay than  he had mentioned? Did he even mean to return at all? </p>
  <p>Ah,  that was the question! Did he intend to return, or had I been the unconscious  witness of a flight? </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_17"></a>Chapter 17 <br>
    Sweetwater In A New Role</b></h2>
  <p>A  few days later three men were closeted in the district attorney&rsquo;s office. Two  of them were officials&mdash;the district attorney himself, and our old friend, the  inspector. The third was the detective, Sweetwater, chosen by them to keep  watch on Mr. Grey. </p>
  <p>Sweetwater  had just come to town,&mdash;this was evident from the gripsack he had set down in a  corner on entering, also from a certain tousled appearance which bespoke hasty  rising and but few facilities for proper attention to his person. These details  counted little, however, in the astonishment created by his manner. For a hardy  chap he looked strangely nervous and indisposed, so much so that, after the  first short greeting, the inspector asked him what was up, and if he had had  another Fairbrother-house experience. </p>
  <p>He  replied with a decided no; that it was not his adventure which had upset him,  but the news he had to bring. </p>
  <p>Here  he glanced at every door and window; and then, leaning forward over the table  at which the two officials sat, he brought his head as nearly to them as  possible and whispered five words. </p>
  <p>They  produced a most unhappy sensation. Both the men, hardened as they were by  duties which soon sap the sensibilities, started and turned as pale as the  speaker himself. Then the district attorney, with one glance at the inspector,  rose and locked the door. </p>
  <p>It  was a prelude to this tale which I give, not as it came from his mouth, but as  it was afterward related to me. The language, I fear, is mostly my own. </p>
  <p>The  detective had just been with Mr. Grey to the coast of Maine. Why there, will  presently appear. His task had been to follow this gentleman, and follow him he  did. </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey was a very stately man, difficult of approach, and was absorbed, besides,  by some overwhelming care. But this fellow was one in a thousand and somehow,  during the trip, he managed to do him some little service, which drew the  attention of the great man to himself. This done, he so improved his  opportunity that the two were soon on the best of terms, and he learned that  the Englishman was without a valet, and, being unaccustomed to move about  without one, felt the awkwardness of his position very much. This gave  Sweetwater his cue, and when he found that the services of such a man were  wanted only during the present trip and for the handling of affairs quite apart  from personal tendance upon the gentleman himself, he showed such an honest  desire to fill the place, and made out to give such a good account of himself,  that he found himself engaged for the work before reaching C&mdash;. </p>
  <p>This  was a great stroke of luck, he thought, but he little knew how big a stroke or  into what a series of adventures it was going to lead him. </p>
  <p>Once  on the platform of the small station at which Mr. Grey had bidden him to stop,  he noticed two things: the utter helplessness of the man in all practical  matters, and his extreme anxiety to see all that was going on about him without  being himself seen. There was method in this curiosity, too much method. Women  did not interest him in the least. They could pass and repass without arousing  his attention, but the moment a man stepped his way, he shrank from him only to  betray the greatest curiosity concerning him the moment he felt it safe to turn  and observe him. All of which convinced Sweetwater that the Englishman&rsquo;s errand  was in connection with a man whom he equally dreaded and desired to meet. </p>
  <p>Of  this he was made absolutely certain a little later. As they were leaving the  depot with the rest of the arrivals, Mr. Grey said: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want you to get me a room at a very quiet hotel. This done, you are to hunt up  the man whose name you will find written in this paper, and when you have found  him, make up your mind how it will be possible for me to get a good look at him  without his getting any sort of a look at me. Do this and you will earn a  week&rsquo;s salary in one day.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  with his head in air and his heart on fire&mdash;for matters were looking very  promising indeed&mdash;took the paper and put it in his pocket; then he began to hunt  for a hotel. Not till he had found what he wished, and installed the Englishman  in his room, did he venture to open the precious memorandum and read the name  he had been speculating over for an hour. It was not the one he had  anticipated, but it came near to it. It was that of James Wellgood. </p>
  <p>Satisfied  now that he had a ticklish matter to handle, he prepared for it, with his usual  enthusiasm and circumspection. </p>
  <p>Sauntering  out into the street, he strolled first toward the post-office. The train on  which he had just come had been a mail-train, and he calculated that he would  find half the town there. </p>
  <p>His  calculation was a correct one. The store was crowded with people. Taking his  place in the line drawn up before the post-office window, he awaited his turn,  and when it came shouted out the name which was his one talisman&mdash;James  Wellgood. </p>
  <p>The  man behind the boxes was used to the name and reached out a hand toward a box  unusually well stacked, but stopped half-way there and gave Sweetwater a sharp  look. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are you?&rdquo; he asked. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  stranger,&rdquo; that young man put in volubly, &ldquo;looking for James Wellgood. I  thought, perhaps, you could tell me where to find him. I see that his letters  pass through this office.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  taking up another man&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; complained the postmaster. He probably alluded  to the man whose elbow Sweetwater felt boring into his back. &ldquo;Ask Dick over  there; he knows him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  detective was glad enough to escape and ask Dick. But he was better pleased yet  when Dick&mdash;a fellow with a squint whose hand was always in the sugar&mdash;told him  that Mr. Wellgood would probably be in for his mail in a few moments. &ldquo;That is  his buggy standing before the drug-store on the opposite side of the way.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>So!  he had netted Jones&rsquo; quondam waiter at the first cast! &ldquo;Lucky!&rdquo; was what he  said to himself, &ldquo;still lucky!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Sauntering  to the door, he watched for the owner of that buggy. He had learned, as such  fellows do, that there was a secret hue and cry after this very man by the New  York police; that he was supposed by some to be Sears himself. In this way he  would soon be looking upon the very man whose steps he had followed through the  Fairbrother house a few nights before, and through whose resolute action he had  very nearly run the risk of a lingering death from starvation. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  dangerous customer,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;I wonder if my instinct will go so far as to  make me recognize his presence. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. It has served me almost as  well as that many times before.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  appeared to serve him now, for when the man finally showed himself on the  cross-walk separating the two buildings he experienced a sudden indecision not  unlike that of dread, and there being nothing in the man&rsquo;s appearance to  warrant apprehension, he took it for the instinctive recognition it undoubtedly  was. </p>
  <p>He  therefore watched him narrowly and succeeded in getting one glance from his  eye. It was enough. The man was commonplace,&mdash;commonplace in feature, dress and  manner, but his eye gave him away. There was nothing commonplace in that. It  was an eye to beware of. </p>
  <p>He  had taken in Sweetwater as he passed, but Sweetwater was of a commonplace type,  too, and woke no corresponding dread in the other&rsquo;s mind; for he went whistling  into the store, from which he presently reissued with a bundle of mail in his  hand. The detective&rsquo;s first instinct was to take him into custody as a suspect  much wanted by the New York police; but reason assured him that he not only had  no warrant for this, but that he would better serve the ends of justice by  following out his present task of bringing this man and the Englishman together  and watching the result. But how, with the conditions laid on him by Mr. Grey,  was this to be done? He knew nothing of the man&rsquo;s circumstances or of his  position in the town. How, then, go to work to secure his cooperation in a  scheme possibly as mysterious to him as it was to himself? He could stop this  stranger in mid-street, with some plausible excuse, but it did not follow that  he would succeed in luring him to the hotel where Mr. Grey could see him.  Wellgood, or, as he believed, Sears, knew too much of life to be beguiled by  any open clap-trap, and Sweetwater was obliged to see him drive off without  having made the least advance in the purpose engrossing him. </p>
  <p>But  that was nothing. He had all the evening before him, and reentering the store,  he took up his stand near the sugar barrel. He had perceived that in the pauses  of weighing and tasting, Dick talked; if he were guided with suitable discretion,  why should he not talk of Wellgood? </p>
  <p>He  was guided, and he did talk and to some effect. That is, he gave information of  the man which surprised Sweetwater. If in the past and in New York he had been  known as a waiter, or should I say steward, he was known here as a manufacturer  of patent medicine designed to rejuvenate the human race. He had not been long  in town and was somewhat of a stranger yet, but he wouldn&rsquo;t be so long. He was  going to make things hum, he was. Money for this, money for that, a horse where  another man would walk, and mail&mdash;well, that alone would make this post-office  worth while. Then the drugs&mdash;ordered by wholesale. Those boxes over there were  his, ready to be carted out to his manufactory. Count them, some one, and think  of the bottles and bottles of stuff they stand for. If it sells as he says it  will&mdash;then he will soon be rich: and so on, till Sweetwater brought the  garrulous Dick to a standstill by asking whether Wellgood had been away for any  purpose since he first came to town. He received the reply that he had just  come home from New York, where he had been for some articles needed in his  manufactory. Sweetwater felt all his convictions confirmed, and ended the  colloquy with the final question: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  where is his manufactory? Might be worth visiting, perhaps.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  other made a gesture, said something about northwest and rushed to help a  customer. Sweetwater took the opportunity to slide away. More explicit  directions could easily be got elsewhere, and he felt anxious to return to Mr.  Grey and discover, if possible, whether it would prove as much a matter of  surprise to him as to Sweetwater himself that the man who answered to the name  of Wellgood was the owner of a manufactory and a barrel or two of drugs, out of  which he proposed to make a compound that would rob the doctors of their  business and make himself and this little village rich. </p>
  <p>Sweetwater  made only one stop on his way to Mr. Grey&rsquo;s hotel rooms, and that was at the  stables. Here he learned whatever else there was to know, and, armed with  definite information, he appeared before Mr. Grey, who, to his astonishment,  was dining in his own room. </p>
  <p>He  had dismissed the waiter and was rather brooding than eating. He looked up  eagerly, however, when Sweetwater entered, and asked what news. </p>
  <p>The  detective, with some semblance of respect, answered that he had seen Wellgood,  but that he had been unable to detain him or bring him within his employer&rsquo;s  observation. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a patent-medicine man,&rdquo; he then explained, &ldquo;and manufactures his own  concoctions in a house he has rented here on a lonely road some half-mile out  of town.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wellgood  does? the man named Wellgood?&rdquo; Mr. Grey exclaimed with all the astonishment the  other secretly expected. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  Wellgood,&mdash;James Wellgood. There is no other in town.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long has this man been here?&rdquo; the statesman inquired, after a moment of  apparently great discomfiture. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  twenty-four hours, this time. He was here once before, when he rented the house  and made all his plans.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey rose precipitately. His manner had changed. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must see him. What you tell me makes it all the more necessary for me to see  him. How can you bring it about?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  his seeing you?&rdquo; Sweetwater asked. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; certainly without his seeing me. Couldn&rsquo;t you rap him up at his own door,  and hold him in talk a minute, while I looked on from the carriage or whatever  vehicle we can get to carry us there? The least glimpse of his face would  satisfy me. That is, to-night.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  try,&rdquo; said Sweetwater, not very sanguine as to the probable result of this  effort. </p>
  <p>Returning  to the stables, he ordered the team. With the last ray of the sun they set out,  the reins in Sweetwater&rsquo;s hands. </p>
  <p>They  headed for the coast-road. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_18"></a>Chapter 18 <br>
    The Closed Door</b></h2>
  <p>The  road was once the highway, but the tide having played so many tricks with its  numberless bridges a new one had been built farther up the cliff, carrying with  it the life and business of the small town. Many old landmarks still  remained&mdash;shops, warehouses and even a few scattered dwellings. But most of  these were deserted, and those that were still in use showed such neglect that  it was very evident the whole region would soon be given up to the encroaching  sea and such interests as are inseparable from it. </p>
  <p>The  hour was that mysterious one of late twilight, when outlines lose their  distinctness and sea and shore melt into one mass of uniform gray. There was no  wind and the waves came in with a soft plash, but so near to the level of the  road that it was evident, even to these strangers, that the tide was at its  height and would presently begin to ebb. </p>
  <p>Soon  they had passed the last forsaken dwelling, and the town proper lay behind  them. Sand and a few rocks were all that lay between them now and the open  stretch of the ocean, which, at this point, approached the land in a small bay,  well-guarded on either side by embracing rocky heads. This was what made the  harbor at C&mdash;. </p>
  <p>It  was very still. They passed one team and only one. Sweetwater looked very  sharply at this team and at its driver, but saw nothing to arouse suspicion.  They were now a half-mile from C&mdash;, and, seemingly, in a perfectly desolate  region. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  manufactory here!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Grey. It was the first word he had uttered  since starting. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  far from here,&rdquo; was Sweetwater&rsquo;s equally laconic reply; and, the road taking a  turn almost at the moment of his speaking, he leaned forward and pointed out a  building standing on the right-hand side of the road, with its feet in the  water. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They described it well enough for me to know it  when I see it. Looks like a robber&rsquo;s hole at this time of night,&rdquo; he laughed;  &ldquo;but what can you expect from a manufactory of patent medicine?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey was silent. He was looking very earnestly at the building. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is larger than I expected,&rdquo; he remarked at last. </p>
  <p>Sweetwater  himself was surprised, but as they advanced and their point of view changed  they found it to be really an insignificant structure, and Mr. Wellgood&rsquo;s  portion of it more insignificant still. </p>
  <p>In  reality it was a collection of three stores under one roof: two of them were  shut up and evidently unoccupied, the third showed a lighted window. This was  the manufactory. It occupied the middle place and presented a tolerably decent  appearance. It showed, besides the lighted lamp I have mentioned, such signs of  life as a few packing-boxes tumbled out on the small platform in front, and a  whinnying horse attached to an empty buggy, tied to a post on the opposite side  of the road. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad to see the lamp,&rdquo; muttered Sweetwater. &ldquo;Now, what shall we do? Is it light  enough for you to see his face, if I can manage to bring him to the door?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey seemed startled. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  darker than I thought,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But call the man and if I can not see him  plainly, I&rsquo;ll shout to the horse to stand, which you will take as a signal to  bring this Wellgood nearer. But do not be surprised if I ride off before he  reaches the buggy. I&rsquo;ll come back again and take you up farther down the road.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, sir,&rdquo; answered Sweetwater, with a side glance at the speaker&rsquo;s  inscrutable features. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a go!&rdquo; And leaping to the ground he advanced to the  manufactory door and knocked loudly. </p>
  <p>No  one appeared. </p>
  <p>He  tried the latch; it lifted, but the door did not open; it was fastened from within. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo;  he muttered, casting a glance at the waiting horse and buggy, then at the  lighted window, which was on the second floor directly over his head. &ldquo;Guess  I&rsquo;ll sing out.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Here  he shouted the man&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;Wellgood! I say, Wellgood!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>No  response to this either. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looks  bad!&rdquo; he acknowledged to himself; and, taking a step back, he looked up at the  window. </p>
  <p>It  was closed, but there was neither shade nor curtain to obstruct the view. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you see anything?&rdquo; he inquired of Mr. Grey, who sat with his eye at the small  window in the buggy top. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  movement in the room above? No shadow at the window?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it&rsquo;s confounded strange!&rdquo; And he went back, still calling Wellgood. </p>
  <p>The  tied-up horse whinnied, and the waves gave a soft splash and that was all,&mdash;if I  except Sweetwater&rsquo;s muttered oath. </p>
  <p>Coming  back, he looked again at the window, then, with a gesture toward Mr. Grey,  turned the corner of the building and began to edge himself along its side in  an endeavor to reach the rear and see what it offered. But he came to a sudden  standstill. He found himself on the edge of the bank before he had taken twenty  steps. Yet the building projected on, and he saw why it had looked so large  from a certain point of the approach. Its rear was built out on piles, making  its depth even greater than the united width of the three stores. At low tide  this might be accessible from below, but just now the water was almost on a  level with the top of the piles, making all approach impossible save by boat. </p>
  <p>Disgusted  with his failure, Sweetwater returned to the front, and, finding the situation  unchanged, took a new resolve. After measuring with his eye the height of the  first story, he coolly walked over to the strange horse, and, slipping his  bridle, brought it back and cast it over a projection of the door; by its aid  he succeeded in climbing up to the window, which was the sole eye to the  interior. </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey sat far back in his buggy, watching every movement. </p>
  <p>There  were no shades at the window, as I have before said, and, once Sweetwater&rsquo;s eye  had reached the level of the sill, he could see the interior without the least  difficulty. There was nobody there. The lamp burned on a great table littered  with papers, but the rude cane-chair before it was empty, and so was the room.  He could see into every corner of it and there was not even a hiding-place  where anybody could remain concealed. Sweetwater was still looking, when the  lamp, which had been burning with considerable smoke, flared up and went out.  Sweetwater uttered an ejaculation, and, finding himself face to face with utter  darkness, slid from his perch to the ground. </p>
  <p>Approaching  Mr. Grey for the second time, he said: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can not understand it. The fellow is either lying low, or he&rsquo;s gone out,  leaving his lamp to go out, too. But whose is the horse&mdash;just excuse me while I  tie him up again. It looks like the one he was driving to-day. It is the one.  Well, he won&rsquo;t leave him here all night. Shall we lie low and wait for him to  come and unhitch this animal? Or do you prefer to return to the hotel?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey was slow in answering. Finally he said: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man may suspect our intention. You can never tell anything about such fellows  as he. He may have caught some unexpected glimpse of me or simply heard that I  was in town. If he&rsquo;s the man I think him, he has reasons for avoiding me which  I can very well understand. Let us go back,&mdash;not to the hotel, I must see this  adventure through tonight,&mdash;but far enough for him to think we have given up all  idea of routing him out to-night. Perhaps that is all he is waiting for. You  can steal back&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me,&rdquo; said Sweetwater, &ldquo;but I know a better dodge than that. We&rsquo;ll circumvent  him. We passed a boat-house on our way down here. I&rsquo;ll just drive you up,  procure a boat, and bring you back here by water. I don&rsquo;t believe that he will  expect that, and if he is in the house we shall see him or his light.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile  he can escape by the road.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Escape?  Do you think he is planning to escape?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  detective spoke with becoming surprise and Mr. Grey answered without apparent  suspicion. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is possible if he suspects my presence in the neighborhood.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you want to stop him?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to <i>see</i> him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I remember. Well, sir, we will drive on,&mdash;that is, after a moment.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to do?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  nothing. You said you wanted to see the man before he escaped.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that he might escape by the road.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I was just making that a little bit impracticable. A small pebble in the  keyhole and&mdash;why, see now, his horse is walking off! Gee! I must have fastened  him badly. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he trotted all the way to town. But it can&rsquo;t  be helped. I can not be supposed to race after him. Are you ready now, sir?  I&rsquo;ll give another shout, then I&rsquo;ll get in.&rdquo; And once more the lonely region  about echoed with the cry: &ldquo;Wellgood! I say, Wellgood!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>There  was no answer, and the young detective, masking for the nonce as Mr. Grey&rsquo;s  confidential servant, jumped into the buggy, and turned the horse&rsquo;s head toward  C&mdash;. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_19"></a>Chapter 19 <br>
    The Face</b></h2>
  <p>The  moon was well up when the small boat in which our young detective was seated  with Mr. Grey appeared in the bay approaching the so-called manufactory of  Wellgood. The looked-for light on the waterside was not there. All was dark  except where the windows reflected the light of the moon. </p>
  <p>This  was a decided disappointment to Sweetwater, if not to Mr. Grey. He had expected  to detect signs of life in this quarter, and this additional proof of  Wellgood&rsquo;s absence from home made it look as if they had come out on a fool&rsquo;s  errand and might much better have stuck to the road. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  promise there,&rdquo; came in a mutter from his lips. &ldquo;Shall I row in, sir, and try  to make a landing?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may row nearer. I should like a closer view. I don&rsquo;t think we shall attract any  attention. There are more boats than ours on the water.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Sweetwater  was startled. Looking round, he saw a launch, or some such small steamer,  riding at anchor not far from the mouth of the bay. But that was not all.  Between it and them was a rowboat like their own, resting quietly in the wake  of the moon. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like so much company,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s brewing; something in  which we may not want to take a part.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely,&rdquo; answered Mr. Grey grimly. &ldquo;But we must not be deterred&mdash;not till I have  seen&mdash;&rdquo; the rest Sweetwater did not hear. Mr. Grey seemed to remember himself.  &ldquo;Row nearer,&rdquo; he now bade. &ldquo;Get under the shadow of the rocks if you can. If  the boat is for him, he will show himself. Yet I hardly see how he can board  from that bank.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  did not look feasible. Nevertheless, they waited and watched with much patience  for several long minutes. The boat behind them did not advance, nor was any  movement discernible in the direction of the manufactory. Another short period,  then suddenly a light flashed from a window high up in the central gable,  sparkled for an instant and was gone. Sweetwater took it for a signal and, with  a slight motion of the wrist, began to work his way in toward shore till they  lay almost at the edge of the piles. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was Sweetwater who spoke. </p>
  <p>Both  listened, Mr. Grey with his head turned toward the launch and Sweetwater with  his eye on the cavernous space, sharply outlined by the piles, which the  falling tide now disclosed under each contiguous building. Goods had been  directly shipped from these stores in the old days. This he had learned in the  village. How shipped he had not been able to understand from his previous  survey of the building. But he thought he could see now. At low tide, or  better, at half-tide, access could be got to the floor of the extension and, if  this floor held a trap, the mystery would be explainable. So would be the  hovering boat&mdash;the signal-light and&mdash;yes! this sound overheard of steps on a  rattling planking. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hear nothing,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Grey from the other end. &ldquo;The boat is still there,  but not a man has dipped an oar.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  will soon,&rdquo; returned Sweetwater as a smothered sound of clanking iron reached  his ears from the hollow spaces before him. &ldquo;Duck your head, sir; I&rsquo;m going to  row in under this portion of the house.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey would have protested and with very good reason. There was scarcely a space  of three feet between them and the boards overhead. But Sweetwater had so  immediately suited action to word that he had no choice. </p>
  <p>They  were now in utter darkness, and Mr. Grey&rsquo;s thoughts must have been peculiar as  he crouched over the stern, hardly knowing what to expect or whether this  sudden launch into darkness was for the purpose of flight or pursuit. But enlightenment  came soon. The sound of a man&rsquo;s tread in the building above was every moment  becoming more perceptible, and while wondering, possibly, at his position, Mr.  Grey naturally turned his head as nearly as he could in the direction of these  sounds, and was staring with blank eyes into the darkness, when Sweetwater,  leaning toward him, whispered: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  up! There&rsquo;s a trap. In a minute he&rsquo;ll open it. Mark him, but don&rsquo;t breathe a  word, and I&rsquo;ll get you out of this all right.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey attempted some answer, but it was lost in the prolonged creak of  slowly-moving hinges somewhere over their heads. Spaces, which had looked dark,  suddenly looked darker; hearing was satisfied, but not the eye. A man&rsquo;s breath  panting with exertion testified to a near-by presence; but that man was working  without a light in a room with shuttered windows, and Mr. Grey probably felt  that he knew very little more than before, when suddenly, most unexpectedly, to  him at least, a face started out of that overhead darkness; a face so white,  with every feature made so startlingly distinct by the strong light Sweetwater  had thrown upon it, that it seemed the only thing in the world to the two men  beneath. In another moment it had vanished, or rather the light which had  revealed it. </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700581h-images/page292.jpg" width="552" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that? Are you there?&rdquo; came down from above in hoarse and none too encouraging  tones. </p>
  <p>There  was none to answer; Sweetwater, with a quick pull on the oars, had already shot  the boat out of its dangerous harbor. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_20"></a>Chapter 20 <br>
    Moonlight&mdash;And A Clue</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you satisfied? Have you got what you wanted?&rdquo; asked Sweetwater, when they were  well away from the shore and the voice they had heard calling at intervals from  the chasm they had left. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  You&rsquo;re a good fellow. It could not have been better managed.&rdquo; Then, after a  pause too prolonged and thoughtful to please Sweetwater, who was burning with  curiosity if not with some deeper feeling: &ldquo;What was that light you burned? A  match?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Sweetwater  did not answer. He dared not. How speak of the electric torch he as a detective  carried in his pocket? That would be to give himself away. He therefore let  this question slip by and put in one of his own. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you ready to go back now, sir? Are we all done here?&rdquo; This with his ear turned  and his eye bent forward; for the adventure they had interrupted was not at an  end, whether their part in it was or not. </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey hesitated, his glances following those of Sweetwater. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us wait,&rdquo; said he, in a tone which surprised Sweetwater. &ldquo;If he is meditating  an escape, I must speak to him before he reaches the launch. At all hazards,&rdquo;  he added after another moment&rsquo;s thought. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, sir. How do you propose&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>His  words were interrupted by a shrill whistle from the direction of the bank.  Promptly, and as if awaiting this signal, the two men in the rowboat before  them dipped their oars and pulled for the shore, taking the direction of the  manufactory. </p>
  <p>Sweetwater  said nothing, but held himself in readiness. </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey was equally silent, but the lines of his face seemed to deepen in the  moonlight as the boat, gliding rapidly through the water, passed them within a  dozen boat-lengths and slipped into the opening under the manufactory building. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  row!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Make for the launch. We&rsquo;ll intercept them on their return.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  glowing with anticipation, bent to his work. The boat beneath them gave a bound  and in a few minutes they were far out on the waters of the bay. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re  coming!&rdquo; he whispered eagerly, as he saw Mr. Grey looking anxiously back. &ldquo;How  much farther shall I go?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  within hailing distance of the launch,&rdquo; was Mr. Grey&rsquo;s reply. </p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  gaging the distance with a glance, stopped at the proper point and rested on  his oars. But his thoughts did not rest. He realized that he was about to  witness an interview whose importance he easily recognized. How much of it  would he hear? What would be the upshot and what was his full duty in the case?  He knew that this man Wellgood was wanted by the New York police, but he was  possessed with no authority to arrest him, even if he had the power. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  more than I bargained for,&rdquo; he inwardly commented. &ldquo;But I wanted excitement,  and now I have got it. If only I can keep my head level, I may get something  out of this, if not all I could wish.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Meantime  the second boat was very nearly on them. He could mark the three figures and  pick out Wellgood&rsquo;s head from among the rest. It had a resolute air; the face  on which, to his evident discomfiture, the moon shone, wore a look which  convinced the detective that this was no patent-medicine manufacturer, nor even  a caterer&rsquo;s assistant, but a man of nerve and resources, the same, indeed, whom  he had encountered in Mr. Fairbrother&rsquo;s house, with such disastrous, almost  fatal, results to himself. </p>
  <p>The  discovery, though an unexpected one, did not lessen his sense of the extreme  helplessness of his own position. He could witness, but he could not act;  follow Mr. Grey&rsquo;s orders, but indulge in none of his own. The detective must  continue to be lost in the valet, though it came hard and woke a sense of shame  in his ambitious breast. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Wellgood had seen them and ordered his men to cease rowing. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  way, there,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re for the launch and in a hurry.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  some one here who wants to speak to you, Mr. Wellgood,&rdquo; Sweetwater called out,  as respectfully as he could. &ldquo;Shall I mention your name?&rdquo; he asked of Mr. Grey. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I will do that myself.&rdquo; And raising his voice, he accosted the other with these  words: &ldquo;I am the man, Percival Grey, of Darlington Manor, England. I should  like to say a word to you before you embark.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A  change, quick as lightning and almost as dangerous, passed over the face  Sweetwater was watching with such painful anxiety; but as the other added  nothing to his words and seemed to be merely waiting, he shrugged his shoulders  and muttered an order to his rowers to proceed. </p>
  <p>In  another moment the sterns of the two small craft swung together, but in such a  way that, by dint of a little skilful manipulation on the part of Wellgood&rsquo;s  men, the latter&rsquo;s back was toward the moon. </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey leaned toward Wellgood, and his face fell into shadow also. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;  thought the detective, &ldquo;I should have managed that myself. But if I can not see  I shall at least hear.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>But  he deceived himself in this. The two men spoke in such low whispers that only  their intensity was manifest. Not a word came to Sweetwater&rsquo;s ears. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;  he thought again, &ldquo;this is bad.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>But  he had to swallow his disappointment, and more. For presently the two men, so  different in culture, station and appearance, came, as it seemed, to an  understanding, and Wellgood, taking his hand from his breast, fumbled in one of  his pockets and drew out something which he handed to Mr. Grey. </p>
  <p>This  made Sweetwater start and peer with still greater anxiety at every movement,  when to his surprise both bent forward, each over his own knee, doing something  so mysterious he could get no clue to its nature till they again stretched  forth their hands to each other and he caught the gleam of paper and realized  that they were exchanging memoranda or notes. </p>
  <p>These  must have been important, for each made an immediate endeavor to read his slip  by turning it toward the moon&rsquo;s rays. That both were satisfied was shown by  their after movements. Wellgood put his slip into his pocket, and without  further word to Mr. Grey motioned his men to row away. They did so with a will,  leaving a line of silver in their wake. Mr. Grey, on the contrary, gave no  orders. He still held his slip and seemed to be dreaming. But his eye was on  the shore, and he did not even turn when sounds from the launch denoted that  she was under way. </p>
  <p>Sweetwater;  looking at this morsel of paper with greedy eyes, dipped his oars and began  pulling softly toward that portion of the beach where a small and twinkling light  defined the boat-house. He hoped Mr. Grey would speak, hoped that in some way,  by some means, he might obtain a clue to his patron&rsquo;s thoughts. But the English  gentleman sat like an image and did not move till a slight but sudden breeze,  blowing in-shore, seized the paper in his hand and carried it away, past  Sweetwater, who vainly sought to catch it as it went fluttering by, into the  water ahead, where it shone for a moment, then softly disappeared. </p>
  <p>Sweetwater  uttered a cry, so did Mr. Grey. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it anything you wanted?&rdquo; called out the former, leaning over the bow of the  boat and making a dive at the paper with his oar. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but if it&rsquo;s gone, it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; returned the other with some feeling. &ldquo;Careless  of me, very careless,&mdash;but I was thinking of&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He stopped;  he was greatly agitated, but he did not encourage Sweetwater in any further  attempts to recover the lost memorandum. Indeed, such an effort would have been  fruitless; the paper was gone, and there was nothing left for them but to  continue their way. As they did so it would have been hard to tell in which  breast chagrin mounted higher. Sweetwater had lost a clue in a thousand, and  Mr. Grey&mdash;well, no one knew what he had lost. He said nothing and plainly showed  by his changed manner that he was in haste to land now and be done with this  doubtful adventure. </p>
  <p>When  they reached the boat-house Mr. Grey left Sweetwater to pay for the boat and  started at once for the hotel. </p>
  <p>The  man in charge had the bow of the boat in hand, preparatory to pulling it up on  the boards. As Sweetwater turned toward him he caught sight of the side of the  boat, shining brightly in the moonlight. He gave a start and, with a muttered  ejaculation, darted forward and picked off a small piece of paper from the  dripping keel. It separated in his hand and a part of it escaped him, but the  rest he managed to keep by secreting it in his palm, where it still clung, wet  and possibly illegible, when he came upon Mr. Grey again in the hotel office. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  your pay,&rdquo; said that gentleman, giving him a bill. &ldquo;I am very glad I met you.  You have served me remarkably well.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>There  was an anxiety in his face and a hurry in his movements which struck  Sweetwater. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  this mean that you are through with me?&rdquo; asked Sweetwater. &ldquo;That you have no  further call for my services?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take the train to-night. I find that I  still have time.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Sweetwater  began to look alive. </p>
  <p>Uttering  hasty thanks, he rushed away to his own room and, turning on the gas, peeled  off the morsel of paper which had begun to dry on his hand. If it should prove  to be the blank end! If the written part were the one which had floated off!  Such disappointments had fallen to his lot! He was not unused to them. </p>
  <p>But  he was destined to better luck this time. The written end had indeed  disappeared, but there was one word left, which he had no sooner read than he  gave a low cry and prepared to leave for New York on the same train as Mr.  Grey. </p>
  <p>The  word was&mdash;<i>diamond</i>. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_21"></a>Chapter 21 <br>
    Grizel! Grizel!</b></h2>
  <p>I  indulged in some very serious thoughts after Mr. Grey&rsquo;s departure. A fact was  borne in upon me to which I had hitherto closed my prejudiced eyes, but which I  could no longer ignore, whatever confusion it brought or however it caused me  to change my mind on a subject which had formed one of the strongest bases to  the argument by which I had sought to save Mr. Durand. Miss Grey cherished no  such distrust of her father as I, in my ignorance of their relations, had  imputed to her in the early hours of my ministrations. This you have already  seen in my account of their parting. Whatever his dread, fear or remorse, there  was no evidence that she felt toward him anything but love and confidence: but  love and confidence from her to him were in direct contradiction to the doubts  I had believed her to have expressed in the half-written note handed to Mrs.  Fairbrother in the alcove. Had I been wrong, then, in attributing this scrawl  to her? It began to look so. Though forbidden to allow her to speak on the one  tabooed subject, I had wit enough to know that nothing would keep her from it,  if the fate of Mrs. Fairbrother occupied any real place in her thoughts. </p>
  <p>Yet  when the opportunity was given me one morning of settling this fact beyond all  doubt, I own that my main feeling was one of dread. I feared to see this  article in my creed destroyed, lest I should lose confidence in the whole. Yet  conscience bade me face the matter boldly, for had I not boasted to myself that  my one desire was the truth? </p>
  <p>I  allude to the disposition which Miss Grey showed on the morning of the third  day to do a little surreptitious writing. You remember that a specimen of her  handwriting had been asked for by the inspector, and once had been earnestly  desired by myself. Now I seemed likely to have it, if I did not open my eyes  too widely to the meaning of her seemingly chance requests. A little pencil  dangled at the end of my watch-chain. Would I let her see it, let her hold it  in her hand for a minute? it was so like one she used to have. Of course I took  it off, of course I let her retain it a little while in her hand. But the  pencil was not enough. A few minutes later she asked for a book to look at&mdash;I  sometimes let her look at pictures. But the book bothered her&mdash;she would look at  it later; would I give her something to mark the place&mdash;that postal over there.  I gave her the postal. She put it in the book and I, who understood her  thoroughly, wondered what excuse she would now find for sending me into the  other room. She found one very soon, and with a heavily-beating heart I left  her with that pencil and postal. A soft laugh from her lips drew me back. She  was holding up the postal. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;See!  I have written a line to <i>him!</i> Oh, you good, good nurse, to let me! You needn&rsquo;t  look so alarmed. It hasn&rsquo;t hurt me one bit.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  knew that it had not; knew that such an exertion was likely to be more  beneficial than hurtful to her, or I should have found some excuse for  deterring her. I endeavored to make my face more natural. As she seemed to want  me to take the postal in my hand I drew near and took it. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  address looks very shaky,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I think you will have to put it in an  envelope.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  looked at it,&mdash;I could not help it,&mdash;her eye was on me, and I could not even  prepare my mind for the shock of seeing it like or totally unlike the writing  of the warning. It was totally unlike; so distinctly unlike that it was no  longer possible to attribute those lines to her which, according to Mr.  Durand&rsquo;s story, had caused Mrs. Fairbrother to take off her diamond. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  why!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You actually look pale. Are you afraid the doctor will scold  us? It hasn&rsquo;t hurt me nearly so much as lying here and knowing what he would  give for one word from me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right, and I am foolish,&rdquo; I answered with all the spirit left in me. &ldquo;I  should be glad&mdash;I am glad that you have written these words. I will copy the  address on an envelope and send it out in the first mail.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; she murmured, giving me back my pencil with a sly smile. &ldquo;Now I can  sleep. I must have roses in my cheeks when papa comes home.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>And  she bade fair to have ruddier roses than myself, for conscience was working  havoc in my breast. The theory I had built up with such care, the theory I had  persisted in urging upon the inspector in spite of his rebuke, was slowly  crumbling to pieces in my mind with the falling of one of its main pillars.  With the warning unaccounted for in the manner I have stated, there was a  weakness in my argument which nothing could make good. How could I tell the  inspector, if ever I should be so happy or so miserable as to meet his eye  again? Humiliated to the dust, I could see no worth now in any of the arguments  I had advanced. I flew from one extreme to the other, and was imputing perfect  probity to Mr. Grey and an honorable if mysterious reason for all his acts,  when the door opened and he came in. Instantly my last doubt vanished. I had  not expected him to return so soon. </p>
  <p>He  was glad to be back; that I could see, but there was no other gladness in him.  I had looked for some change in his manner and appearance,&mdash;that is, if he  returned at all,&mdash;but the one I saw was not a cheerful one, even after he had  approached his daughter&rsquo;s bedside and found her greatly improved. She noticed  this and scrutinized him strangely. He dropped his eyes and turned to leave the  room, but was stopped by her loving cry; he came back and leaned over her. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it, father? You are fatigued, worried&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, quite well,&rdquo; he hastily assured her. &ldquo;But <i>you!</i> are you as well as you  seem?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  yes. I am gaining every day. See! see! I shall soon be able to sit up.  Yesterday I read a few words.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  started, with a side glance at me which took in a table near by on which a  little book was lying. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  a book?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and&mdash;and Arthur&rsquo;s letters.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  father flushed, lifted himself, patted her arm tenderly and hastened into  another room. </p>
  <p>Miss  Grey&rsquo;s eyes followed him longingly, and I heard her give utterance to a soft  sigh. A few hours before, this would have conveyed to my suspicious mind deep  and mysterious meanings; but I was seeing everything now in a different light,  and I found myself no longer inclined either to exaggerate or to misinterpret  these little marks of filial solicitude. Trying to rejoice over the present  condition of my mind, I was searching in the hidden depths of my nature for the  patience of which I stood in such need, when every thought and feeling were  again thrown into confusion by the receipt of another communication from the  inspector, in which he stated that something had occurred to bring the  authorities round to my way of thinking and that the test with the stiletto was  to be made at once. </p>
  <p>Could  the irony of fate go further! I dropped the letter half read, querying if it  were my duty to let the inspector know of the flaw I had discovered in my own  theory, before I proceeded with the attempt I had suggested when I believed in  its complete soundness. I had not settled the question when I took the letter  up again. Re-reading its opening sentence, I was caught by the word  &ldquo;something.&rdquo; It was a very indefinite one, yet was capable of covering a large  field. It must cover a large field, or it could not have produced such a change  in the minds of these men, conservative from principle and in this instance  from discretion. I would be satisfied with that word <i>something</i> and quit further  thinking. I was weary of it. The inspector was now taking the initiative, and I  was satisfied to be his simple instrument and no more. Arrived at this  conclusion, however, I read the rest of the letter. The test was to go on, but  under different conditions. It was no longer to be made at my own discretion  and in the up-stairs room; it was to be made at luncheon hour and in Mr. Grey&rsquo;s  private dining-room, where, if by any chance Mr. Grey found himself outraged by  the placing of this notorious weapon beside his plate, the blame could be laid  on the waiter, who, mistaking his directions, had placed it on Mr. Grey&rsquo;s table  when it was meant for Inspector Dalzell&rsquo;s, who was lunching in the adjoining  room. It was I, however, who was to do the placing. With what precautions and  under what circumstances will presently appear. </p>
  <p>Fortunately,  the hour set was very near. Otherwise I do not know how I could have endured  the continued strain of gazing on my patient&rsquo;s sweet face, looking up at me  from her pillow, with a shadow over its beauty which had not been there before  her father&rsquo;s return. </p>
  <p>And  that father! I could hear him pacing the library floor with a restlessness that  struck me as being strangely akin to my own inward anguish of impatience and  doubt. What was he dreading? What was it I had seen darkening his face and  disturbing his manner, when from time to time he pushed open the communicating  door and cast an anxious glance our way, only to withdraw again without uttering  a word. Did he realize that a crisis was approaching, that danger menaced him,  and from <i>me?</i> No, not the latter, for his glance never strayed to me, but rested  solely on his daughter. I was, therefore, not connected with the disturbance in  his thoughts. As far as that was concerned I could proceed fearlessly; I had  not him to dread, only the event. That I did dread, as any one must who saw  Miss Grey&rsquo;s face during these painful moments and heard that restless tramp in  the room beyond. </p>
  <p>At  last the hour struck,&mdash;the hour at which Mr. Grey always descended to lunch. He  was punctuality itself, and under ordinary circumstances I could depend upon  his leaving the room within five minutes of the stroke of one. But would he be  as prompt to-day? Was he in the mood for luncheon? Would he go down stairs at  all? Yes, for the tramp, tramp stopped; I heard him approaching his daughter&rsquo;s  door for a last look in and managed to escape just in time to procure what I  wanted and reach the room below before he came. </p>
  <p>My  opportunity was short, but I had time to see two things: first, that the  location of his seat had been changed so that his back was to the door leading  into the adjoining room; secondly, that this door was ajar. The usual waiter  was in the room and showed no surprise at my appearance, I having been careful  to have it understood that hereafter Miss Grey&rsquo;s appetite was to be encouraged  by having her soup served from her father&rsquo;s table by her father&rsquo;s own hands,  and that I should be there to receive it. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Grey is coming,&rdquo; said I, approaching the waiter and handing him the stiletto  loosely wrapped in tissue paper. &ldquo;Will you be kind enough to place this at his  plate, just as it is? A man gave it to me for Mr. Grey; said we were to place  it there.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  waiter, suspecting nothing, did as he was bidden, and I had hardly time to  catch up the tray laden with dishes, which I saw awaiting me on a side-table,  when Mr. Grey came in and was ushered to his seat. </p>
  <p>The  soup was not there, but I advanced with my tray and stood waiting; not too  near, lest the violent beating of my heart should betray me. As I did so the  waiter disappeared and the door behind us opened. Though Mr. Grey&rsquo;s eye had  fallen on the package, and I saw him start, I darted one glance at the room  thus disclosed, and saw that it held two tables. At one, the inspector and some  one I did not know sat eating; at the other a man alone, whose back was to us  all, and who seemingly was entirely disconnected with the interests of this  tragic moment. All this I saw in an instant,&mdash;the next my eyes were fixed on Mr.  Grey&rsquo;s face. </p>
  <p>He  had reached out his hand to the package and his features showed an emotion I  hardly understood. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  this?&rdquo; he murmured, feeling it with wonder, I should almost say anger. Suddenly  he pulled off the wrapper, and my heart stood still in expectancy. If he  quailed&mdash;and how could he help doing so if guilty&mdash;what a doubt would be removed  from my own breast, what an impediment from police action! But he did not  quail; he simply uttered an exclamation of intense anger, and laid the weapon  back on the table without even taking the precaution of covering it up. I think  he muttered an oath, but there was no fear in it, not a particle. </p>
  <p>My  disappointment was so great, my humiliation so unbounded, that, forgetting  myself in my dismay, I staggered back and let the tray with all its contents  slip from my hands. The crash that followed stopped Mr. Grey in the act of  rising. But it did something more. It awoke a cry from the adjoining room which  I shall never forget. While we both started and turned to see from whom this  grievous sound had sprung, a man came stumbling toward us with his hands before  his eyes and this name wild on his lips: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grizel!  Grizel!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Mrs.  Fairbrother&rsquo;s name! and the man&mdash; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_22"></a>Chapter 22 <br>
    Guilt</b></h2>
  <p>Was  he Wellgood? Sears? Who? A lover of the woman certainly; that was borne in on  us by the passion of his cry: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grizel!  Grizel!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>But  how here? and why such fury in Mr. Grey&rsquo;s face and such amazement in that of  the inspector? </p>
  <p>This  question was not to be answered offhand. Mr. Grey, advancing, laid a finger on  the man&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we will have our conversation in another  room.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  man, who, in dress and appearance looked oddly out of place in those gorgeous  rooms, shook off the stupor into which he had fallen and started to follow the  Englishman. A waiter crossed their track with the soup for our table. Mr. Grey  motioned him aside. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  that back,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have some business to transact with this gentleman  before I eat. I&rsquo;ll ring when I want you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Then  they entered where I was. As the door closed I caught sight of the inspector&rsquo;s  face turned earnestly toward me. In his eyes I read my duty, and girded up my  heart, as it were, to meet&mdash;what? In that moment it was impossible to tell. </p>
  <p>The  next enlightened me. With a total ignoring of my presence, due probably to his  great excitement, Mr. Grey turned on his companion the moment he had closed the  door and, seizing him by the collar, cried: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fairbrother,  you villain, why have you called on your wife like this? Are you murderer as  well as thief?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Fairbrother!  this man? Then who was he who was being nursed back to life on the mountains  beyond Santa Fe? Sears? Anything seemed possible in that moment. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  dropping his hand from the other&rsquo;s throat as suddenly as he had seized it, Mr.  Grey caught up the stiletto from the table where he had flung it, crying: &ldquo;Do  you recognize this?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Ah,  then I saw guilt! </p>
  <p>In  a silence worse than any cry, this so-called husband of the murdered woman, the  man on whom no suspicion had fallen, the man whom all had thought a thousand  miles away at the time of the deed, stared at the weapon thrust under his eyes,  while over his face passed all those expressions of fear, abhorrence and  detected guilt which, fool that I was, I had expected to see reflected in  response to the same test in Mr. Grey&rsquo;s equable countenance. </p>
  <p>The  surprise and wonder of it held me chained to the spot. I was in a state of  stupefaction, so that I scarcely noted the broken fragments at my feet. But the  intruder noticed them. Wrenching his gaze from the stiletto which Mr. Grey  continued to hold out, he pointed to the broken cup and saucer, muttering: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what startled me into this betrayal&mdash;the noise of breaking china. I can not  bear it since&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  stopped, bit his lip and looked around him with an air of sudden bravado. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  you dropped the cups at your wife&rsquo;s feet in Mr. Ramsdell&rsquo;s alcove,&rdquo; finished  Mr. Grey with admirable self-possession. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see that explanations from myself are not in order,&rdquo; was the grim retort,  launched with the bitterest sarcasm. Then as the full weight of his position  crushed in on him, his face assumed an aspect startling to my unaccustomed  eyes, and, thrusting his hand into his pocket he drew forth a small box which  he placed in Mr. Grey&rsquo;s hands. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Great Mogul,&rdquo; he declared simply. </p>
  <p>It  was the first time I had heard this diamond so named. </p>
  <p>Without  a word that gentleman opened the box, took one look at the contents, assumed a  satisfied air, and carefully deposited the recovered gem in his own pocket. As  his eyes returned to the man before him, all the passion of the latter burst  forth. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was not for that I killed her!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;It was because she defied me and  flaunted her disobedience in my very face. I would do it again, yet&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Here  his voice broke and it was in a different tone and with a total change of  manner he added: &ldquo;You stand appalled at my depravity. You have not lived my  life.&rdquo; Then quickly and with a touch of sullenness: &ldquo;You suspected me because  of the stiletto. It was a mistake, using that stiletto. Otherwise, the plan was  good. I doubt if you know now how I found my way into the alcove, possibly  under your very eyes; certainly, under the eyes of many who knew me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not. It is enough that you entered it; that you confess your guilt.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Here  Mr. Grey stretched his hand toward the electric button. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it is not enough.&rdquo; The tone was fierce, authoritative. &ldquo;Do not ring the bell,  not yet. I have a fancy to tell you how I managed that little affair.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Glancing  about, he caught up from a near-by table a small brass tray. Emptying it of its  contents, he turned on us with drawn-down features and an obsequious air so  opposed to his natural manner that it was as if another man stood before us. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  my black tie,&rdquo; he muttered, holding out the tray toward Mr. Grey. </p>
  <p>Wellgood! </p>
  <p>The  room turned with me. It was he, then, the great financier, the  multimillionaire, the husband of the magnificent Grizel, who had entered Mr.  Ramsdell&rsquo;s house as a waiter! </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey did not show surprise, but he made a gesture, when instantly the tray was  thrown aside and the man resumed his ordinary aspect. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see you understand me,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I who have played host at many a ball,  passed myself off that night as one of the waiters. I came and went and no one  noticed me. It is such a natural sight to see a waiter passing ices that my  going in and out of the alcove did not attract the least attention. I never  look at waiters when I attend balls. I never look higher than their trays. No  one looked at me higher than my tray. I held the stiletto under the tray and  when I struck her she threw up her hands and they hit the tray and the cups  fell. I have never been able to bear the sound of breaking china since. I loved  her&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700581h-images/page322.jpg" width="564" height="750"></p>
  <p>A  gasp and he recovered himself. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is neither here nor there,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You summoned me under threat to  present myself at your door to-day. I have done so. I meant to restore you your  diamond, simply. It has become worthless to me. But fate exacted more. Surprise  forced my secret from me. That young lady with her damnable awkwardness has put  my head in a noose. But do not think to hold it there. I did not risk this  interview without precautions, I assure you, and when I leave this hotel it  will be as a free man.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>With  one of his rapid changes, wonderful and inexplicable to me at the moment, he  turned toward me with a bow, saying courteously enough: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will excuse the young lady.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Next  moment the barrel of a pistol gleamed in his hand. </p>
  <p>The  moment was critical. Mr. Grey stood directly in the line of fire, and the  audacious man who thus held him at his mercy was scarcely a foot from the door  leading into the hall. Marking the desperation of his look and the steadiness  of his finger on the trigger, I expected to see Mr. Grey recoil and the man  escape. But Mr. Grey held his own, though he made no move, and did not venture  to speak. Nerved by his courage, I summoned up all my own. This man must not  escape, nor must Mr. Grey suffer. The pistol directed against him must be  diverted to myself. Such amends were due one whose good name I had so deeply if  secretly insulted. I had but to scream, to call out for the inspector, but a  remembrance of the necessity we were now under of preserving our secret, of keeping  from Mr. Grey the fact that he had been under surveillance, was even at that  moment surrounded by the police, deterred me, and I threw myself toward the  bell instead, crying out that I would raise the house if he moved, and laid my  finger on the button. </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700581h-images/page725.jpg" width="548" height="750"></p>
  <p>The  pistol swerved my way. The face above it smiled. I watched that smile. Before  it broadened to its full extent, I pressed the button. </p>
  <p>Fairbrother  stared, dropped his pistol, and burst forth with these two words: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brave  girl!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  tone I can never convey. </p>
  <p>Then  he made for the door. </p>
  <p>As  he laid his hand on the knob, he called back: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been in worse straits than this!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>But  he never had; when he opened the door, he found himself face to face with the  inspector. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_23"></a>Chapter 23 <br>
    The Great Mogul</b></h2>
  <p>Later,  it was all explained. Mr. Grey, looking like another man, came into the room  where I was endeavoring to soothe his startled daughter and devour in secret my  own joy. Taking the sweet girl in his arms, he said, with a calm ignoring of my  presence, at which I secretly smiled: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is the happiest moment of my existence, Helen. I feel as if I had recovered you  from the brink of the grave.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me?  Why, I have never been so ill as that.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know; but I have felt as if you were doomed ever since I heard, or thought I  heard, in this city, and under no ordinary circumstances, the peculiar cry  which haunts our house on the eve of any great misfortune. I shall not  apologize for my fears; you know that I have good cause for them, but to-day,  only to-day, I have heard from the lips of the most arrant knave I have ever  known, that this cry sprang from himself with intent to deceive me. He knew my  weakness; knew the cry; he was in Darlington Manor when Cecilia died; and,  wishing to startle me into dropping something which I held, made use of his  ventriloquial powers (he had been a mountebank once, poor wretch!) and with  such effect, that I have not been a happy man since, in spite of your daily  improvement and continued promise of recovery. But I am happy now, relieved and  joyful; and this miserable being,&mdash;would you like to hear his story? Are you  strong enough for anything so tragic? He is a thief and a murderer, but he has  feelings, and his life has been a curious one, and strangely interwoven with  ours. Do you care to hear about it? He is the man who stole our diamond.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>My  patient uttered a little cry. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  tell me,&rdquo; she entreated, excited, but not unhealthfully; while I was in an  anguish of curiosity I could with difficulty conceal. </p>
  <p>Mr.  Grey turned with courtesy toward me and asked if a few family details would  bore me. I smiled and assured him to the contrary. At which he settled himself  in the chair he liked best and began a tale which I will permit myself to  present to you complete and from other points of view than his own. </p>
  <p>Some  five years before, one of the great diamonds of the world was offered for sale  in an Eastern market. Mr. Grey, who stopped at no expense in the gratification  of his taste in this direction, immediately sent his agent to Egypt to examine  this stone. If the agent discovered it to be all that was claimed for it, and  within the reach of a wealthy commoner&rsquo;s purse, he was to buy it. Upon  inspection, it was found to be all that was claimed, with one exception. In the  center of one of the facets was a flaw, but, as this was considered to mark the  diamond, and rather add to than detract from its value as a traditional stone  with many historical associations, it was finally purchased by Mr. Grey and  placed among his treasures in his manor-house in Kent. Never a suspicious man,  he took delight in exhibiting this acquisition to such of his friends and  acquaintances as were likely to feel any interest in it, and it was not an  uncommon thing for him to allow it to pass from hand to hand while he pottered  over his other treasures and displayed this and that to such as had no eyes for  the diamond. </p>
  <p>It  was after one such occasion that he found, on taking the stone in his hand to  replace it in the safe he had had built for it in one of his cabinets, that it  did not strike his eye with its usual force and brilliancy, and, on examining  it closely, he discovered the absence of the telltale flaw. Struck with dismay,  he submitted it to a still more rigid inspection, when he found that what he  held was not even a diamond, but a worthless bit of glass, which had been  substituted by some cunning knave for his invaluable gem. </p>
  <p>For  the moment his humiliation almost equaled his sense of loss; he had been so  often warned of the danger he ran in letting so priceless an object pass around  under all eyes but his own. His wife and friends had prophesied some such loss  as this, not once, but many times, and he had always laughed at their fears,  saying that he knew his friends, and there was not a scamp amongst them. But now  he saw it proved that even the intuition of a man well-versed in human nature  is not always infallible, and, ashamed of his past laxness and more ashamed yet  of the doubts which this experience called up in regard to all his friends, he  shut up the false stone with his usual care and buried his loss in his own  bosom, till he could sift his impressions and recall with some degree of  probability the circumstances under which this exchange could have been made. </p>
  <p>It  had not been made that evening. Of this he was positive. The only persons  present on this occasion were friends of such standing and repute that  suspicion in their regard was simply monstrous. When and to whom, then, had he  shown the diamond last? Alas, it had been a long month since he had shown the  jewel. Cecilia, his youngest daughter, had died in the interim; therefore his  mind had not been on jewels. A month! time for his precious diamond to have  been carried back to the East! Time for it to have been recut! Surely it was  lost to him for ever, unless he could immediately locate the person who had  robbed him of it. </p>
  <p>But  this promised difficulties. He could not remember just what persons he had  entertained on that especial day in his little hall of cabinets, and, when he  did succeed in getting a list of them from his butler, he was by no means sure  that it included the full number of his guests. His own memory was execrable,  and, in short, he had but few facts to offer to the discreet agent sent up from  Scotland Yard one morning to hear his complaint and act secretly in his  interests. He could give him <i>carte blanche</i> to carry on his inquiries in the  diamond market, but little else. And while this seemed to satisfy the agent, it  did not lead to any gratifying result to himself, and he had thoroughly made up  his mind to swallow his loss and say nothing about it, when one day a young  cousin of his, living in great style in an adjoining county, informed him that  in some mysterious way he had lost from his collection of arms a unique and  highly-prized stiletto of Italian workmanship. </p>
  <p>Startled  by this coincidence, Mr. Grey ventured upon a question or two, which led to his  cousin&rsquo;s confiding to him the fact that this article had disappeared after a  large supper given by him to a number of friends and gentlemen from London.  This piece of knowledge, still further coinciding with his own experience,  caused Mr. Grey to ask for a list of his guests, in the hope of finding among  them one who had been in his own house. </p>
  <p>His  cousin, quite unsuspicious of the motives underlying this request, hastened to  write out this list, and together they pored over the names, crossing out such  as were absolutely above suspicion. When they had reached the end of the list,  but two names remained uncrossed. One was that of a rattle-pated youth who had  come in the wake of a highly reputed connection of theirs, and the other that  of an American tourist who gave all the evidences of great wealth and had  presented letters to leading men in London which had insured him attentions not  usually accorded to foreigners. This man&rsquo;s name was Fairbrother, and, the  moment Mr. Grey heard it, he recalled the fact that an American with a peculiar  name, but with a reputation for wealth, had been among his guests on the  suspected evening. </p>
  <p>Hiding  the effect produced upon him by this discovery, he placed his finger on this  name and begged his cousin to look up its owner&rsquo;s antecedents and present  reputation in America; but, not content with this, he sent his own agent over  to New York&mdash;whither, as he soon learned, this gentleman had returned. The  result was an apparent vindication of the suspected American. He was found to  be a well-known citizen of the great metropolis, moving in the highest circles  and with a reputation for wealth won by an extraordinary business instinct. </p>
  <p>To  be sure, he had not always enjoyed these distinctions. Like many another  self-made man, he had risen from a menial position in a Western mining camp, to  be the owner of a mine himself, and so up through the various gradations of a  successful life to a position among the foremost business men of New York. In  all these changes he had maintained a name for honest, if not generous,  dealing. He lived in great style, had married and was known to have but one  extravagant fancy. This was for the unique and curious in art,&mdash;a taste which,  if report spoke true, cost him many thousands each year. </p>
  <p>This  last was the only clause in the report which pointed in any way toward this man  being the possible abstractor of the Great Mogul, as Mr. Grey&rsquo;s famous diamond  was called, and the latter was too just a man and too much of a fancier in this  line himself to let a fact of this kind weigh against the favorable nature of  the rest. So he recalled his agent, double-locked his cabinets and continued to  confine his display of valuables to articles which did not suggest jewels. Thus  three years passed, when one day he heard mention made of a wonderful diamond  which had been seen in New York. From its description he gathered that it must  be the one surreptitiously abstracted from his cabinet, and when, after some  careful inquiries, he learned that the name of its possessor was Fairbrother,  he awoke to his old suspicions and determined to probe this matter to the  bottom. But secretly. He still had too much consideration to attack a man in  high position without full proof. </p>
  <p>Knowing  of no one he could trust with so delicate an inquiry as this had now become, he  decided to undertake it himself, and for this purpose embraced the first  opportunity to cross the water. He took his daughter with him because he had  resolved never to let his one remaining child out of his sight. But she knew  nothing of his plans or reason for travel. No one did. Indeed, only his lawyer  and the police were aware of the loss of his diamond. </p>
  <p>His  first surprise on landing was to learn that Mr. Fairbrother, of whose marriage  he had heard, had quarreled with his wife and that, in the separation which had  occurred, the diamond had fallen to her share and was consequently in her  possession at the present moment. </p>
  <p>This  changed matters, and Mr. Grey&rsquo;s only thought now was to surprise her with the  diamond on her person and by one glance assure himself that it was indeed the  Great Mogul. Since Mrs. Fairbrother was reported to be a beautiful woman and a  great society belle, he saw no reason why he should not meet her publicly, and  that very soon. He therefore accepted invitations and attended theaters and  balls, though his daughter had suffered from her voyage and was not able to  accompany him. But alas! he soon learned that Mrs. Fairbrother was never seen  with her diamond and, one evening after an introduction at the opera, that she  never talked about it. So there he was, balked on the very threshold of his  enterprise, and, recognizing the fact, was preparing to take his now seriously  ailing daughter south, when he received an invitation to a ball of such a  select character that he decided to remain for it, in the hope that Mrs.  Fairbrother would be tempted to put on all her splendor for so magnificent a  function and thus gratify him with a sight of his own diamond. During the days  that intervened he saw her several times and very soon decided that, in spite  of her reticence in regard to this gem, she was not sufficiently in her  husband&rsquo;s confidence to know the secret of its real ownership. This encouraged  him to attempt piquing her into wearing the diamond on this occasion. He talked  of precious stones and finally of his own, declaring that he had a  connoisseur&rsquo;s eye for a fine diamond, but had seen none as yet in America to  compete with a specimen or two he had in his own cabinets. Her eye flashed at  this and, though she said nothing, he felt sure that her presence at Mr.  Ramsdell&rsquo;s house would be enlivened by her great jewel. </p>
  <p>So  much for Mr. Grey&rsquo;s attitude in this matter up to the night of the ball. It is  interesting enough, but that of Abner Fairbrother is more interesting still and  much more serious. </p>
  <p>His  was indeed the hand which had abstracted the diamond from Mr. Grey&rsquo;s  collection. Under ordinary conditions he was an honest man. He prized his good  name and would not willingly risk it, but he had little real conscience, and  once his passions were aroused nothing short of the object desired would  content him. At once forceful and subtle, he had at his command infinite  resources which his wandering and eventful life had heightened almost to the  point of genius. He saw this stone, and at once felt an inordinate desire to  possess it. He had coveted other men&rsquo;s treasures before, but not as he coveted  this. What had been longing in other cases was mania in this. There was a woman  in America whom he loved. She was beautiful and she was splendor-loving. To see  her with this glory on her breast would be worth almost any risk which his  imagination could picture at the moment. Before the diamond had left his hand  he had made up his mind to have it for his own. He knew that it could not be  bought, so he set about obtaining it by an act he did not hesitate to  acknowledge to himself as criminal. But he did not act without precautions.  Having a keen eye and a proper sense or size and color, he carried away from  his first view of it a true image of the stone, and when he was next admitted  to Mr. Grey&rsquo;s cabinet room he had provided the means for deceiving the owner  whose character he had sounded. </p>
  <p>He  might have failed in his daring attempt if he had not been favored by a  circumstance no one could have foreseen. A daughter of the house, Cecilia by  name, lay critically ill at the time, and Mr. Grey&rsquo;s attention was more or less  distracted. Still the probabilities are that he would have noticed something  amiss with the stone when he came to restore it to its place, if, just as he  took it in his hand, there had not risen in the air outside a weird and wailing  cry which at once seized upon the imagination of the dozen gentlemen present,  and so nearly prostrated their host that he thrust the box he held unopened  into the safe and fell upon his knees, a totally unnerved man, crying: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  banshee! the banshee! My daughter will die!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Another  hand than his locked the safe and dropped the key into the distracted father&rsquo;s  pocket. </p>
  <p>Thus  a superhuman daring conjoined with a special intervention of fate had made the  enterprise a successful one; and Fairbrother, believing more than ever in his  star, carried this invaluable jewel back with him to New York. The  stiletto&mdash;well, the taking of that was a folly, for which he had never ceased to  blush. He had not stolen it; he would not steal so inconsiderable an object. He  had merely put it in his pocket when he saw it forgotten, passed over, given to  him, as it were. That the risk, contrary to that involved in the taking of the  diamond, was far in excess of the gratification obtained, he realized almost  immediately, but, having made the break, and acquired the curio, he spared  himself all further thought or the consequences, and presently resumed his old  life in New York, none the worse, to all appearances, for these escapades from  virtue and his usual course of fair and open dealing. </p>
  <p>But  he was soon the worse from jealousy of the wife which his new possession had  possibly won for him. She had answered all his expectations as mistress of his  home and the exponent of his wealth; and for a year, nay, for two, he had been  perfectly happy. Indeed, he had been more than that; he had been triumphant,  especially on that memorable evening when, after a cautious delay of months, he  had dared to pin that unapproachable sparkler to her breast and present her  thus bedecked to the smart set&mdash;her whom his talents, and especially his  far-reaching business talents, had made his own. </p>
  <p>Recalling  the old days of barter and sale across the pine counter in Colorado, he felt  that his star rode high, and for a time was satisfied with his wife&rsquo;s  magnificence and the prestige she gave his establishment. But pride is not all,  even to a man of his daring ambition. Gradually he began to realize, first,  that she was indifferent to him, next, that she despised him, and, lastly, that  she hated him. She had dozens at her feet, any of whom was more agreeable to  her than her own husband; and, though he could not put his finger on any  definite fault, he soon wearied of a beauty that only glowed for others, and  made up his mind to part with her rather than let his heart be eaten out by  unappeasable longing for what his own good sense told him would never be his. </p>
  <p>Yet,  being naturally generous, he was satisfied with a separation, and, finding it  impossible to think of her as other than extravagantly fed, waited on and  clothed, he allowed her a good share of his fortune with the one proviso, that  she should not disgrace him. But the diamond she stole, or rather carried off  in her naturally high-handed manner with the rest of her jewels. He had never  given it to her. She knew the value he set on it, but not how he came by it, and  would have worn it quite freely if he had not very soon given her to understand  that the pleasure of doing so ceased when she left his house. As she could not  be seen with it without occasioning public remark, she was forced, though much  against her will, to heed his wishes, and enjoy its brilliancy in private. But  once, when he was out of town, she dared to appear with this fortune on her  breast, and again while on a visit West,&mdash;and her husband heard of it. </p>
  <p>Mr.  Fairbrother had had the jewel set to suit him, not in Florence, as Sears had  said, but by a skilful workman he had picked up in great poverty in a remote  corner of Williamsburg. Always in dread of some complication, he had provided  himself with a second facsimile in paste, this time of an astonishing  brightness, and this facsimile he had had set precisely like the true stone.  Then he gave the workman a thousand dollars and sent him back to Switzerland.  This imitation in paste he showed nobody, but he kept it always in his pocket;  why, he hardly knew. Meantime, he had one confidant, not of his crime, but of  his sentiments toward his wife, and the determination he had secretly made to  proceed to extremities if she continued to disobey him. </p>
  <p>This  was a man of his own age or older, who had known him in his early days, and had  followed all his fortunes. He had been the master of Fairbrother then, but he  was his servant now, and as devoted to his interests as if they were his  own,&mdash;which, in a way, they were. For eighteen years he had stood at the  latter&rsquo;s right hand, satisfied to look no further, but, for the last three, his  glances had strayed a foot or two beyond his master, and taken in his master&rsquo;s  wife. </p>
  <p>The  feelings which this man had for Mrs. Fairbrother were peculiar. She was a mere  adjunct to her great lord, but she was a very gorgeous one, and, while he could  not imagine himself doing anything to thwart him whose bread he ate, and to  whose rise he had himself contributed, yet if he could remain true to him  without injuring he; he would account himself happy. The day came when he had  to decide between them, and, against all chances, against his own preconceived  notion of what he would do under these circumstances, he chose to consider her. </p>
  <p>This  day came when, in the midst of growing complacency and an intense interest in  some new scheme which demanded all his powers, Abner Fairbrother learned from  the papers that Mr. Grey, of English Parliamentary fame, had arrived in New  York on an indefinite visit. As no cause was assigned for the visit beyond a  natural desire on the part of this eminent statesman to see this great country,  Mr. Fairbrother&rsquo;s fears reached a sudden climax, and he saw himself ruined and  for ever disgraced if the diamond now so unhappily out of his hands should fall  under the eyes of its owner, whose seeming quiet under its loss had not for a  moment deceived him. Waiting only long enough to make sure that the  distinguished foreigner was likely to accept social attentions, and so in all  probability would be brought in contact with Mrs. Fairbrother, he sent her by  his devoted servant a peremptory message, in which he demanded back his  diamond; and, upon her refusing to heed this, followed it up by another, in  which he expressly stated that if she took it out of the safe deposit in which  he had been told she was wise enough to keep it, or wore it so much as once  during the next three months, she would pay for her presumption with her life. </p>
  <p>This  was no idle threat, though she chose to regard it as such, laughing in the old  servant&rsquo;s face and declaring that she would run the risk if the notion seized  her. But the notion did not seem to seize her at once, and her husband was  beginning to take heart, when he heard of the great ball about to be given by  the Ramsdells and realized that if she were going to be tempted to wear the  diamond at all, it would be at this brilliant function given in honor of the  one man he had most cause to fear in the whole world. </p>
  <p>Sears,  seeing the emotion he was under, watched him closely. They had both been on the  point of starting for New Mexico to visit a mine in which Mr. Fairbrother was  interested, and he waited with inconceivable anxiety to see if his master would  change his plans. It was while he was in this condition of mind that he was seen  to shake his fist at Mrs. Fairbrother&rsquo;s passing figure; a menace naturally  interpreted as directed against her, but which, if we know the man, was rather  the expression of his anger against the husband who could rebuke and threaten  so beautiful a creature. Meanwhile, Mr. Fairbrother&rsquo;s preparations went on and,  three weeks before the ball, they started. Mr. Fairbrother had business in  Chicago and business in Denver. It was two weeks and more before he reached La  Junta. Sears counted the days. At La Junta they had a long conversation; or  rather Mr. Fairbrother talked and Sears listened. The sum of what he said was  this: He had made up his mind to have back his diamond. He was going to New  York to get it. He was going alone, and as he wished no one to know that he had  gone or that his plans had been in any way interrupted, the other was to  continue on to El Moro, and, passing himself off as Fairbrother, hire a room at  the hotel and shut himself up in it for ten days on any plea his ingenuity  might suggest. If at the end of that time Fairbrother should rejoin him, well  and good. They would go on together to Santa Fe. But if for any reason the  former should delay his return, then Sears was to exercise his own judgment as  to the length of time he should retain his borrowed personality; also as to the  advisability of pushing on to the mine and entering on the work there, as had  been planned between them. </p>
  <p>Sears  knew what all this meant. He understood what was in his master&rsquo;s mind, as well  as if he had been taken into his full confidence, and openly accepted his part  of the business with seeming alacrity, even to the point of supplying  Fairbrother with suitable references as to the ability of one James Wellgood to  fill a waiter&rsquo;s place at fashionable functions. It was not the first he had  given him. Seventeen years before he had written the same, minus the last  phrase. That was when he was the master and Fairbrother the man. But he did not  mean to play the part laid out for him, for all his apparent acquiescence. He began  by following the other&rsquo;s instructions. He exchanged clothes with him and other  necessaries, and took the train for La Junta at or near the time that  Fairbrother started east. But once at El Moro&mdash;once registered there as Abner  Fairbrother from New York&mdash;he took a different course from the one laid out for  him,&mdash;a course which finally brought him into his master&rsquo;s wake and landed him  at the same hour in New York. </p>
  <p>This  is what he did. Instead of shutting himself up in his room he expressed an  immediate desire to visit some neighboring mines, and, procuring a good horse,  started off at the first available moment. He rode north, lost himself in the  mountains, and wandered till he found a guide intelligent enough to lend  himself to his plans. To this guide he confided his horse for the few days he  intended to be gone, paying him well and promising him additional money if,  during his absence, he succeeded in circulating the report that he, Abner  Fairbrother, had gone deep into the mountains, bound for such and such a camp. </p>
  <p>Having  thus provided an alibi, not only for himself, but for his master, too, in case  he should need it, he took the direct road to the nearest railway station, and  started on his long ride east. He did not expect to overtake the man he had been  personating, but fortune was kinder than is usual in such cases, and, owing to  a delay caused by some accident to a freight train, he arrived in Chicago  within a couple of hours of Mr. Fairbrother, and started out of that city on  the same train. But not on the same car. Sears had caught a glimpse of  Fairbrother on the platform, and was careful to keep out of his sight. This was  easy enough. He bought a compartment in the sleeper and stayed in it till they  arrived at the Grand Central Station. Then he hastened out and, fortune  favoring him with another glimpse of the man in whose movements he was so  interested, followed him into the streets. </p>
  <p>Fairbrother  had shaved off his beard before leaving El Moro. Sears had shaved his off on  the train. Both were changed, the former the more, owing to a peculiarity of  his mouth which up till now he had always thought best to cover. Sears,  therefore, walked behind him without fear, and was almost at his heels when  this owner of one of New York&rsquo;s most notable mansions, entered, with a spruce  air, the doors of a prominent caterer. </p>
  <p>Understanding  the plot now, and having everything to fear for his mistress, he walked the  streets for some hours in a state of great indecision. Then he went up to her  apartment. But he had no sooner come within sight of it than a sense of  disloyalty struck him and he slunk away, only to come sidling back when it was  too late and she had started for the ball. </p>
  <p>Trembling  with apprehension, but still strangely divided in his impulses, wishing to serve  master and mistress both, without disloyalty to the one or injury to the other,  he hesitated and argued with himself, till his fears for the latter drove him  to Mr. Ramsdell&rsquo;s house. </p>
  <p>The  night was a stormy one. The heaviest snow of the season was falling with a high  gale blowing down the Sound. As he approached the house, which, as we know, is  one of the modern ones in the Riverside district, he felt his heart fail him.  But as he came nearer and got the full effect of glancing lights, seductive  music, and the cheery bustle of crowding carriages, he saw in his mind&rsquo;s eye  such a picture of his beautiful mistress, threatened, unknown to herself, in a  quarter she little realized, that he lost all sense of what had hitherto  deterred him. Making then and there his great choice, he looked about for the  entrance, with the full intention of seeing and warning her. </p>
  <p>But  this, he presently perceived, was totally impracticable. He could neither go to  her nor expect her to come to him; meanwhile, time was passing, and if his  master was there&mdash;The thought made his head dizzy, and, situated as he was,  among the carriages, he might have been run over in his confusion if his eyes  had not suddenly fallen on a lighted window, the shade of which had been  inadvertently left up. </p>
  <p>Within  this window, which was only a few feet above his head, stood the glowing image  of a woman clad in pink and sparkling with jewels. Her face was turned from  him, but he recognized her splendor as that of the one woman who could never be  too gorgeous for his taste; and, alive to this unexpected opportunity, he made  for this window with the intention of shouting up to her and so attracting her  attention. </p>
  <p>But  this proved futile, and, driven at last to the end of his resources, he tore  out a slip of paper from his note-book and, in the dark and with the blinding  snow in his eyes, wrote the few broken sentences which he thought would best  warn her, without compromising his master. The means he took to reach her with  this note I have already related. As soon as he saw it in her hands he fled the  place and took the first train west. He was in a pitiable condition, when,  three days later, he reached the small station from which he had originally set  out. The haste, the exposure, the horror of the crime he had failed to avert,  had undermined his hitherto excellent constitution, and the symptoms of a  serious illness were beginning to make themselves manifest. But he, like his  indomitable master, possessed a great fund of energy and willpower. He saw that  if he was to save Abner Fairbrother (and now that Mrs. Fairbrother was dead,  his old master was all the world to him) he must make Fairbrother&rsquo;s alibi good  by carrying on the deception as planned by the latter, and getting as soon as  possible to his camp in the New Mexico mountains. He knew that he would have  strength to do this and he went about it without sparing himself. </p>
  <p>Making  his way into the mountains, he found the guide and his horse at the place  agreed upon and, paying the guide enough for his services to insure a quiet  tongue, rode back toward El Moro where he was met and sent on to Santa Fe as  already related. </p>
  <p>Such  is the real explanation of the well-nigh unintelligible scrawl found in Mrs.  Fairbrother&rsquo;s hand after her death. As to the one which left Miss Grey&rsquo;s  bedside for this same house, it was, alike in the writing and sending, the  loving freak of a very sick but tender-hearted girl. She had noted the look  with which Mr. Grey had left her, and, in her delirious state, thought that a  line in her own hand would convince him of her good condition and make it  possible for him to enjoy the evening. She was, however, too much afraid of her  nurse to write it openly, and though we never found that scrawl, it was  doubtless not very different in appearance from the one with which I had  confounded it. The man to whom it was intrusted stopped for too many warming  drinks on his way for it ever to reach Mr. Ramsdell&rsquo;s house. He did not even  return home that night, and when he did put in an appearance the next morning,  he was dismissed. </p>
  <p>This  takes me back to the ball and Mrs. Fairbrother. She had never had much fear of  her husband till she received his old servant&rsquo;s note in the peculiar manner  already mentioned. This, coming through the night and the wet and with all the  marks of hurry upon it, did impress her greatly and led her to take the first  means which offered of ridding herself of her dangerous ornament. The story of  this we know. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  a burning heart and a scheming brain were keeping up their deadly work a few  paces off under the impassive aspect and active movements of the caterer&rsquo;s  newly-hired waiter. Abner Fairbrother, whose real character no one had ever  been able to sound, unless it was the man who had known him in his days of  struggle, was one of those dangerous men who can conceal under a still brow and  a noiseless manner the most violent passions and the most desperate resolves.  He was angry with his wife, who was deliberately jeopardizing his good name,  and he had come there to kill her if he found her flaunting the diamond in Mr.  Grey&rsquo;s eyes; and though no one could have detected any change in his look and  manner as he passed through the room where these two were standing, the doom of  that fair woman was struck when he saw the eager scrutiny and indescribable air  of recognition with which this long-defrauded gentleman eyed his own diamond. </p>
  <p>He  had meant to attack her openly, seize the diamond, fling it at Mr. Grey&rsquo;s feet,  and then kill himself. That had been his plan. But when he found, after a round  or two among the guests, that nobody looked at him, and nobody recognized the  well-known millionaire in the automaton-like figure with the formally-arranged  whiskers and sleekly-combed hair, colder purposes intervened, and he asked  himself if it would not be possible to come upon her alone, strike his blow,  possess himself of the diamond, and make for parts unknown before his identity  could be discovered. He loved life even without the charm cast over it by this  woman. Its struggles and its hard-bought luxuries fascinated him. If Mr. Grey  suspected him, why, Mr. Grey was English, and he a resourceful American. If it  came to an issue, the subtle American would win if Mr. Grey were not able to  point to the flaw which marked this diamond as his own. And this, Fairbrother  had provided against, and would succeed in if he could hold his passions in  check and be ready with all his wit when matters reached a climax. </p>
  <p>Such  were the thoughts and such the plans of the quiet, attentive man who, with his  tray laden with coffee and ices, came and went an unnoticed unit among twenty  other units similarly quiet and similarly attentive. He waited on lady after  lady, and when, on the reissuing of Mr. Durand from the alcove, he passed in  there with his tray and his two cups of coffee, nobody heeded and nobody  remembered. </p>
  <p>It  was all over in a minute, and he came out, still unnoted, and went to the  supper-room for more cups of coffee. But that minute had set its seal on his  heart for ever. She was sitting there alone with her side to the entrance, so  that he had to pass around in order to face her. Her elegance and a certain air  she had of remoteness from the scene of which she was the glowing center when  she smiled, awed him and made his hand loosen a little on the slender stiletto  he held close against the bottom of the tray. But such resolution does not  easily yield, and his fingers soon tightened again, this time with a deadly  grip. </p>
  <p>He  had expected to meet the flash of the diamond as he bent over her, and dreaded  doing so for fear it would attract his eye from her face and so cost him the  sight of that startled recognition which would give the desired point to his  revenge. But the tray, as he held it, shielded her breast from view, and when  he lowered it to strike his blow, he thought of nothing but aiming so truly as  to need no second blow. He had had his experience in those old years in a  mining camp, and he did not fear failure in this. What he did fear was her  utterance of some cry,&mdash;possibly his name. But she was stunned with horror, and  did not shriek,&mdash;horror of him whose eyes she met with her glassy and staring  ones as he slowly drew forth the weapon. </p>
  <p>Why  he drew it forth instead of leaving it in her breast he could not say. Possibly  because it gave him his moment of gloating revenge. When in another instant,  her hands flew up, and the tray tipped, and the china fell, the revulsion came,  and his eyes opened to two facts: the instrument of death was still in his  grasp, and the diamond, on whose possession he counted, was gone from his  wife&rsquo;s breast. </p>
  <p>It  was a horrible moment. Voices could be heard approaching the alcove,&mdash;laughing  voices that in an instant would take on the note of horror. And the music,&mdash;ah!  how low it had sunk, as if to give place to the dying murmur he now heard  issuing from her lips. But he was a man of iron. Thrusting the stiletto into  the first place that offered, he drew the curtains over the staring windows,  then slid out with his tray, calm, speckless and attentive as ever, dead to  thought, dead to feeling, but aware, quite aware in the secret depths of his  being that something besides his wife had been killed that night, and that  sleep and peace of mind and all pleasure in the past were gone for ever. </p>
  <p>It  was not he I saw enter the alcove and come out with news of the crime. He left  this role to one whose antecedents could better bear investigation. His part  was to play, with just the proper display of horror and curiosity, the ordinary  menial brought face to face with a crime in high life. He could do this. He  could even sustain his share in the gossip, and for this purpose kept near the  other waiters. The absence of the diamond was all that troubled him. That  brought him at times to the point of vertigo. Had Mr. Grey recognized and  claimed it? If so, he, Abner Fairbrother, must remain James Wellgood, the  waiter, indefinitely. This would require more belief in his star than ever he  had had yet. But as the moments passed, and no contradiction was given to the  universally-received impression that the same hand which had struck the blow  had taken the diamond, even this cause of anxiety left his breast and he faced  people with more and more courage till the moment when he suddenly heard that  the diamond had been found in the possession of a man perfectly strange to him,  and saw the inspector pass it over into the hands of Mr. Grey. </p>
  <p>Instantly  he realized that the crisis of his fate was on him. If Mr. Grey were given time  to identify this stone, he, Abner Fairbrother, was lost and the diamond as  well. Could he prevent this? There was but one way, and that way he took.  Making use of his ventriloquial powers&mdash;he had spent a year on the public stage  in those early days, playing just such tricks as these&mdash;he raised the one cry  which he knew would startle Mr. Grey more than any other in the world, and when  the diamond fell from his hand, as he knew it would, he rushed forward and, in  the act of picking it up, made that exchange which not only baffled the  suspicions of the statesman, but restored to him the diamond, for whose  possession he was now ready to barter half his remaining days. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Mr. Grey had had his own anxieties. During this whole long evening, he had been  sustained by the conviction that the diamond of which he had caught but one  passing glimpse was the Great Mogul of his once famous collection. So sure was  he of this, that at one moment he found himself tempted to enter the alcove,  demand a closer sight of the diamond and settle the question then and there. He  even went so far as to take in his hands the two cups of coffee which should  serve as his excuse for this intrusion, but his naturally chivalrous instincts  again intervened, and he set the cups down again&mdash;this I did not see&mdash;and turned  his steps toward the library with the intention of writing her a note instead.  But though he found paper and pen to hand, he could find no words for so daring  a request, and he came back into the hall, only to hear that the woman he had  contemplated addressing had just been murdered and her great jewel stolen. </p>
  <p>The  shock was too much, and as there was no leaving the house then, he retreated  again to the library where he devoured his anxieties in silence till hope  revived again at sight of the diamond in the inspector&rsquo;s hand, only to vanish  under the machinations of one he did not even recognize when he took the false  jewel from his hand. </p>
  <p>The  American had outwitted the Englishman and the triumph of evil was complete. </p>
  <p>Or  so it seemed. But if the Englishman is slow, he is sure. Thrown off the track  for the time being, Mr. Grey had only to see a picture of the stiletto in the  papers, to feel again that, despite all appearances, Fairbrother was really not  only at the bottom of the thefts from which his cousin and himself had  suffered, but of this frightful murder as well. He made no open move&mdash;he was a  stranger in a strange land and much disturbed, besides, by his fears for his  daughter&mdash;but he started a secret inquiry through his old valet, whom he ran  across in the street, and whose peculiar adaptability for this kind of work he  well knew. </p>
  <p>The  aim of these inquiries was to determine if the person, whom two physicians and  three assistants were endeavoring to nurse back to health on the top of a wild  plateau in a remote district of New Mexico, was the man he had once entertained  at his own board in England, and the adventures thus incurred would make a  story in itself. But the result seemed to justify them. Word came after  innumerable delays, very trying to Mr. Grey, that he was not the same, though  he bore the name of Fairbrother, and was considered by every one around there  to be Fairbrother. Mr. Grey, ignorant of the relations between the millionaire  master and his man which sometimes led to the latter&rsquo;s personifying the former,  was confident of his own mistake and bitterly ashamed of his own suspicions. </p>
  <p>But  a second message set him right. A deception was being practised down in New  Mexico, and this was how his spy had found it out. Certain letters which went  into the sick tent were sent away again, and always to one address. He had  learned the address. It was that of James Wellgood, C&mdash;, Maine. If Mr. Grey  would look up this Wellgood he would doubtless learn something of the man he  was so interested in. </p>
  <p>This  gave Mr. Grey personally something to do, for he would trust no second party  with a message involving the honor of a possibly innocent man. As the place was  accessible by railroad and his duty clear, he took the journey involved and  succeeded in getting a glimpse in the manner we know of the man James Wellgood.  This time he recognized Fairbrother and, satisfied from the circumstances of  the moment that he would be making no mistake in accusing him of having taken  the Great Mogul, he intercepted him in his flight, as you have already read,  and demanded the immediate return of his great diamond. </p>
  <p>And  Fairbrother? We shall have to go back a little to bring his history up to this  critical instant. </p>
  <p>When  he realized the trend of public opinion; when he saw a perfectly innocent man  committed to the Tombs for his crime, he was first astonished and then amused  at what he continued to regard as the triumph of his star. But he did not start  for El Moro, wise as he felt it would be to do so. Something of the fascination  usual with criminals kept him near the scene of his crime,&mdash;that, and an anxiety  to see how Sears would conduct himself in the Southwest. That Sears had  followed him to New York, knew his crime, and was the strongest witness against  him, was as far from his thoughts as that he owed him the warning which had all  but balked him of his revenge. When therefore he read in the papers that &ldquo;Abner  Fairbrother&rdquo; had been found sick in his camp at Santa Fe, he felt that nothing  now stood in the way of his entering on the plans he had framed for ultimate  escape. On his departure from El Moro he had taken the precaution of giving  Sears the name of a certain small town on the coast of Maine where his mail was  to be sent in case of a great emergency. He had chosen this town for two  reasons. First, because he knew all about it, having had a young man from there  in his employ; secondly, because of its neighborhood to the inlet where an old  launch of his had been docked for the winter. Always astute, always  precautionary, he had given orders to have this launch floated and provisioned,  so that now he had only to send word to the captain, to have at his command the  best possible means of escape. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  he must make good his position in C&mdash;. He did it in the way we know. Satisfied  that the only danger he need fear was the discovery of the fraud practised in  New Mexico, he had confidence enough in Sears, even in his present disabled  state, to take his time and make himself solid with the people of C&mdash;while  waiting for the ice to disappear from the harbor. This accomplished and  cruising made possible, he took a flying trip to New York to secure such papers  and valuables as he wished to carry out of the country with him. They were in  safe deposit, but that safe deposit was in his strong room in the center of his  house in Eighty-sixth Street (a room which you will remember in connection with  Sweetwater&rsquo;s adventure). To enter his own door with his own latch-key, in the  security and darkness of a stormy night, seemed to this self-confident man a  matter of no great risk. Nor did he find it so. He reached his strong room,  procured his securities and was leaving the house, without having suffered an  alarm, when some instinct of self-preservation suggested to him the  advisability of arming himself with a pistol. His own was in Maine, but he  remembered where Sears kept his; he had seen it often enough in that old trunk  he had brought with him from the Sierras. He accordingly went up stairs to the  steward&rsquo;s room, found the pistol and became from that instant invincible. But  in restoring the articles he had pulled out he came across a photograph of his  wife and lost himself over it and went mad, as we have heard the detective  tell. That later, he should succeed in trapping this detective and should leave  the house without a qualm as to his fate shows what sort of man he was in  moments of extreme danger. I doubt, from what I have heard of him since, if he  ever gave two thoughts to the man after he had sprung the double lock on him;  which, considering his extreme ignorance of who his victim was or what relation  he bore to his own fate, was certainly remarkable. </p>
  <p>Back  again in C&mdash;, he made his final preparations for departure. He had already  communicated with the captain of the launch, who may or may not have known his  passenger&rsquo;s real name. He says that he supposed him to be some agent of Mr.  Fairbrother&rsquo;s; that among the first orders he received from that gentleman was  one to the effect that he was to follow the instructions of one Wellgood as if  they came from himself; that he had done so, and not till he had Mr.  Fairbrother on board had he known whom he was expected to carry into other  waters. However, there are many who do not believe the captain. Fairbrother had  a genius for rousing devotion in the men who worked for him, and probably this  man was another Sears. </p>
  <p>To  leave speculation, all was in train, then, and freedom but a quarter of a mile  away, when the boat he was in was stopped by another and he heard Mr. Grey&rsquo;s  voice demanding the jewel. </p>
  <p>The  shock was severe and he had need of all the nerve which had hitherto made his  career so prosperous, to sustain the encounter with the calmness which alone  could carry off the situation. Declaring that the diamond was in New York, he  promised to restore it if the other would make the sacrifice worth while by  continuing to preserve his hitherto admirable silence concerning him: Mr. Grey  responded by granting him just twenty-four hours; and when Fairbrother said the  time was not long enough and allowed his hand to steal ominously to his breast,  he repeated still more decisively, &ldquo;Twenty-four hours.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  ex-miner honored bravery. Withdrawing his hand from his breast, he brought out  a note-book instead of a pistol and, in a tone fully as determined, replied:  &ldquo;The diamond is in a place inaccessible to any one but myself. If you will put  your name to a promise not to betray me for the thirty-six hours I ask, I will  sign one to restore you the diamond before one-thirty o&rsquo;clock on Friday.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will,&rdquo; said Mr. Grey. </p>
  <p>So  the promises were written and duly exchanged. Mr. Grey returned to New York and  Fairbrother boarded his launch. </p>
  <p>The  diamond really was in New York, and to him it seemed more politic to use it as  a means of securing Mr. Grey&rsquo;s permanent silence than to fly the country,  leaving a man behind him who knew his secret and could precipitate his doom  with a word. He would, therefore, go to New York, play his last great card and,  if he lost, be no worse off than he was now. He did not mean to lose. </p>
  <p>But  he had not calculated on any inherent weakness in himself,&mdash;had not calculated  on Providence. A dish tumbled and with it fell into chaos the fair structure of  his dreams. With the cry of &ldquo;Grizel! Grizel!&rdquo; he gave up his secret, his hopes  and his life. There was no retrieval possible after that. The star of Abner  Fairbrother had set. </p>

  <p>Mr.  Grey and his daughter learned very soon of my relations to Mr. Durand, but  through the precautions of the inspector and my own powers of self-control, no  suspicion has ever crossed their minds of the part I once played in the matter  of the stiletto. </p>
  <p>This  was amply proved by the invitation Mr. Durand and I have just received to spend  our honeymoon at Darlington Manor. </p>
