  <h2><a name="story01"
     id="story01">I .&mdash; THE REBUS</a></h2>

  <h3>Published as "The Four Just Men" in <i>Detective Story Magazine</i>, Jul
  2, 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">AS <i>The Megaphone</i> once said, in its most pessimistic
  and wondering mood, recording rather than condemning the strangeness of the
  time:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Even The Four Just Men have become a respectable
  institution. Not more than fifteen years ago we spoke of them as 'a criminal
  organization'; rewards were offered for their arrest... today you may turn
  into Curzon Street and find a silver triangle affixed to the sedate door
  which marks their professional headquarters... The hunted and reviled have
  become a most exclusive detective agency... We can only hope that their
  somewhat drastic methods of other times have been considerably modified."</p>

  <p>It is sometimes a dangerous thing to watch a possible watcher.</p>

  <p>'What is Mr. Lewis Lethersohn afraid of?' asked Manfred, as he cracked an
  egg at breakfast. His handsome, clean-shaven face was tanned a teak-brown,
  for he was newly back from the sun and snows of Switzerland.</p>

  <p>Leon Gonsalez sat opposite, absorbed in The Times; at the end of the table
  was Raymond Poiccart, heavy-featured and saturnine. Other pens than mine have
  described his qualities and his passion for growing vegetables.</p>

  <p>He raised his eyes to Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>'Is he the gentleman who has had this house watched for the past month?'
  he asked.</p>

  <p>A smile quivered on Leon's lips as he folded the newspaper neatly.</p>

  <p>'He is the gentleman&mdash;I'm interviewing him this morning,' he said.
  'In the meantime, the sleuth hounds have been withdrawn&mdash;they were
  employed by the Ottis Detective Agency.'</p>

  <p>'If he is watching us, he has a bad conscience,' said Poiccart, nodding
  slowly. 'I shall be interested to hear all about this.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Lewis Lethersohn lived in Lower Berkeley Street&mdash;a very large and
  expensive house. The footman who opened the door to Leon was arrayed in a
  uniform common enough in historical films but rather out of the picture in
  Lower Berkeley Street. Mulberry and gold and knee breeches... Leon gazed at
  him with awe.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Lethersohn will see you in the library,' said the man&mdash;he
  seemed; thought Leon, rather conscious of his own magnificence.</p>

  <p>A gorgeous house this, with costly furnishings and lavish decorations. As
  he mounted the wide stairs he had a glimpse of a beautiful woman passing
  across the landing. One disdainful glance she threw in his direction and
  passed, leaving behind her the faint fragrance of some exotic perfume.</p>

  <p>The room into which he was shown might have been mistaken for a bedroom,
  with its bric-a-brac and its beauty of appointments.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lethersohn rose from behind the Empire writing table and offered a
  white hand. He was thin, rather bald, and there was a suggestion of the
  scholar in his lined face.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Gonsalez?' His voice was thin and not particularly pleasant. 'Won't
  you sit down? I had your inquiry&mdash;there seems to be some mistake.'</p>

  <p>He had resumed his own seat. Though he might endeavour, to cover up his
  uneasiness by this cold attitude of his, he could not quite hide his
  perturbation.</p>

  <p>'I know you, of course&mdash;but it is ridiculous that I should set men to
  watch your house. Why?'</p>

  <p>Gonsalez was watching him intently.</p>

  <p>'That is what I have come to learn,' he said, 'and I think it would be
  fairest to tell you that there is no doubt that you are watching us. We know
  the agency you employed&mdash;we know the fees you have paid and the
  instructions you have given. The only question is, why?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Lethersohn moved uncomfortably and smiled. 'Really... I suppose there
  is no wisdom in denying that I did employ detectives. The truth is, the Four
  Just Men is rather a formidable organization&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;Well, I
  am a rich man...'</p>

  <p>He was at a loss how to go on.</p>

  <p>The interview ended lamely with polite assurances on either side. Leon
  Gonsalez went back to Curzon Street a very thoughtful man.</p>

  <p>'He's afraid of somebody consulting us, and the detective people have been
  employed to head off that somebody. Now who?'</p>

  <p>The next evening brought the answer.</p>

  <p>It was a grey April night, chill and moist. The woman who walked slowly
  down Curzon Street, examining the numbers on the doors, was an object of
  suspicion to the policeman standing on Claridge's corner. She was in the
  region of thirty, rather slim, under the worn and soddened coat. Her face was
  faded and a little pinched. 'Pretty once,' mused Leon Gonsalez, observing her
  from behind the net curtain that covered the window. 'A working woman without
  a thought beyond keeping her body and soul together.'</p>

  <p>He had time enough to observe her, since she stood for a long time by the
  kerb, looking up and down the street hopelessly.</p>

  <p>'Notice the absence of any kind of luring finery&mdash;and this is the
  hour when even the poorest find a scarf or a pair of gloves.'</p>

  <p>Manfred rose from the table where he had been taking his frugal meal and
  joined the keen-faced observer.</p>

  <p>'Provincial, I think,' said Leon thoughtfully. 'Obviously a stranger to
  the West End&mdash;she's coming here!'</p>

  <p>As he was speaking, the woman had turned, made a brief scrutiny of the
  front door... They heard the bell ring.</p>

  <p>'I was mistaken&mdash;she hadn't lost her way; she was plucking up courage
  to ring&mdash;and if she isn't Lethersohn's bete noire I'm a Dutchman!'</p>

  <p>He heard Poiccart's heavy tread in the passage&mdash;Poiccart played
  butler quite naturally. Presently he came in and closed the door behind
  him.</p>

  <p>'You will be surprised,' he said in his grave way. That was peculiarly
  Poiccart&mdash;to say mysterious things gravely.</p>

  <p>'About the lady? I refuse to be surprised.' Leon was vehement. 'She has
  lost something&mdash;a husband, a watch, something. She has the "lost"
  look&mdash;an atmosphere of vague helplessness surrounds her. The symptoms
  are unmistakable!'</p>

  <p>'Ask her to come in,' said Manfred, and Poiccart retired.</p>

  <p>A second later Alma Stamford was ushered into the room.</p>

  <p>That was her name. She came from Edgware and she was a widow... Long
  before she came to the end of preliminaries Poiccart's promised surprise had
  been sprung, for this woman, wearing clothes that a charwoman would have
  despised, had a voice which was soft and educated. Her vocabulary was
  extensive and she spoke of conditions which could only be familiar to one who
  had lived in surroundings of wealth.</p>

  <p>She was the widow of a man who&mdash;they gathered&mdash;had not been in
  his lifetime the best of husbands. Rich beyond the ordinary meaning of the
  term, with estates in Yorkshire and Somerset, a fearless rider to hounds, he
  had met his death in the hunting field.</p>

  <p>'My husband had a peculiar upbringing,' she said. 'His parents died at an
  early age and he was brought up by his uncle. He was a terrible old man who
  drank heavily, was coarse to the last degree, and was jealous of outside
  interference. Mark saw practically nobody until, in the last year or the old
  man's life, he brought in a Mr. Lethersohn, a young man a little older than
  Mark, to act as tutor&mdash;for Mark's education was terribly backward. My
  husband was twenty-one when his uncle died, but he retained a gentleman to
  act for him as companion and secretary.'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Lewis Lethersohn,' said Leon promptly, and she gasped.</p>

  <p>'I can't guess how you know, but that is the name. Although we weren't
  particularly happy,' she went on, 'my husband's death was a terrible shock.
  But almost as great a shock was his will. In this he left one half of his
  fortune to Lethersohn, the other half to me at the expiration of five years
  from his death, provided that I carried out the conditions of the will. I was
  not to marry during that period, I was to live at a house in Harlow and never
  to leave the Harlow district. Mr. Lethersohn was given absolute power as sole
  executor to dispose of property for my benefit. I have lived in Harlow until
  this morning.'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Lethersohn is of course married?' said Leon, his bright eyes fixed on
  the lady.</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;you know him?'</p>

  <p>Leon shook his head.</p>

  <p>'I only know that he is married and very much in love with his wife.'</p>

  <p>She was astounded at this.</p>

  <p>'You must know him. Yes, he married just before Mark was killed. A very
  beautiful Hungarian girl&mdash;he is half Hungarian and I believe he adores
  her. I heard that she was very extravagant&mdash;I only saw her once.'</p>

  <p>'What has happened at Harlow?' It was the silent, watchful Poiccart who
  asked the question.</p>

  <p>He saw the woman's lips tremble.</p>

  <p>'It has been a nightmare,' she said with a break in her voice. 'The house
  was a beautiful little place&mdash;miles from Harlow really, and off the main
  road. There I have been for two years practically a prisoner. My letters have
  been opened, I have been locked in my room every night by one of the two
  women Mr. Lethersohn sent to look after me, and men have been patrolling the
  grounds day and night.'</p>

  <p>'The suggestion is that you are not quite right in your head?' asked
  Manfred.</p>

  <p>She looked startled at this.</p>

  <p>'You don't think so?' she asked quickly, and, when he shook his head:
  'Thank God for that! Yes, that was the story they told. I wasn't supposed to
  see newspapers, though I had all the books I wanted. One day I found a scrap
  of paper with the account of a bank fraud which you gentlemen had detected,
  and there was a brief account of your past. I treasured that because it had
  your address in the paragraph. To escape seemed impossible&mdash;I had no
  money, it was impossible to leave the grounds. But they had a woman who came
  to do the rough work twice a week. I think she came from the village. I
  managed to enlist her sympathy, and yesterday she brought me these clothes.
  Early this morning I changed, dropped out of my bedroom window and passed the
  guard. Now I come to my real mystery.'</p>

  <p>She put her hand into the pocket of her wet coat and took out a small
  package. This she unwrapped.</p>

  <p>'My husband was taken to the cottage hospital after his accident; he died
  early the next morning. He must have recovered consciousness unknown to the
  nurses, for the top of the sheet was covered with little drawings. He had
  made them with an indelible pencil attached to his temperature chart and
  hanging above his head&mdash;he must have reached up for it and broken it
  off.'</p>

  <p>She spread out the square of soiled linen on the table.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0800211h-images/JM6-Drawing.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>'Poor Mark was very fond of drawing the figures that children and idle
  people who have no real knowledge of art love to scribble.'</p>

  <p>'How did you get this?' asked Leon.</p>

  <p>'The matron cut it off for me.'</p>

  <p>Manfred frowned. 'The sort of things a man might draw in his delirium,' he
  said.</p>

  <p>'On the contrary,' said Leon coolly, 'it is as clear as daylight to me.
  Where were you married?'</p>

  <p>'At the Westminster Registry Office.'</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>'Take your mind back: was there anything remarkable about the
  marriage&mdash;did your husband have a private interview with the
  registrar?'</p>

  <p>She opened her big blue eyes at this.</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;Mr. Lethersohn and my husband interviewed him in his private
  office.'</p>

  <p>Leon chuckled, but was serious again instantly.</p>

  <p>'One more question. Who drew up the will? A lawyer?'</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>'My husband&mdash;it was written in his own hand from start to finish. He
  wrote rather a nice hand, very easily distinguishable from any other.'</p>

  <p>'Were there any other conditions imposed upon you in your husband's
  will?'</p>

  <p>She hesitated, and the watchers saw a dark flush pass over her face.</p>

  <p>'Yes... it was so insulting that I did not tell you. It was this&mdash;and
  this was the main condition&mdash;that I should not at any time attempt to
  establish the fact that I was legally married to Mark. That was to me
  inexplicable&mdash;I can't believe that he was ever married before, but his
  early life was so remarkable that anything may have happened.'</p>

  <p>Leon was smiling delightedly. In such moments he was as a child who had
  received a new and entrancing toy.</p>

  <p>'I can relieve your mind,' he said, to her amazement. 'Your husband was
  never married before!'</p>

  <p>Poiccart was studying the drawings.</p>

  <p>'Can you get the plans of your husband's estates?' he asked, and Leon
  chuckled again.</p>

  <p>'That man knows everything, George!' he exclaimed. 'Poiccart, mon vieux,
  you are superb!' He turned quickly to Mrs. Stamford. 'Madam, you need rest, a
  change of clothing, and&mdash;protection. The first and the last are in this
  house, if you dare be our guest. The second I will procure for you in an
  hour&mdash;together with a temporary maid.'</p>

  <p>She looked at him, a little bewildered... Five minutes later, an
  embarrassed Poiccart was showing her to her room, and a nurse of Leon's
  acquaintance was hurrying to Curzon Street with a bulging suitcase&mdash;Leon
  had a weakness for nurses, and knew at least a hundred by name.</p>

  <p>Late as was the hour, he made several calls&mdash;one as far as Strawberry
  Hill, where a certain assistant registrar of marriages lived.</p>

  <p>It was eleven o'clock that night when he rang the bell at the handsome
  house in Upper Berkeley Street. Another footman admitted him.</p>

  <p>'Are you Mr. Gonsalez? Mr. Lethersohn has not returned from the theatre,
  but he telephoned asking you to wait in the library.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' said Leon gratefully, though there was no need for gratitude,
  for he it was who had telephoned.</p>

  <p>He was bowed into the ornate sanctum and left alone.</p>

  <p>The footman had hardly left the room before Leon was at the Empire desk,
  turning over the papers rapidly. But he found what he sought on the
  blotting-pad, face downwards.</p>

  <p>A letter addressed to a firm of wine merchants complaining of some
  deficiency in a consignment of champagne. He read this through
  rapidly&mdash;it was only half finished&mdash;folded the paper and put it
  into his pocket.</p>

  <p>Carefully and rapidly he examined the drawers of the table: two were
  locked&mdash;the middle drawer was, however, without fastening. What he found
  interested him and gave him some little occupation. He had hardly finished
  before he heard a car stop before the house and, looking through the
  curtains, saw a man and woman alight.</p>

  <p>Dark as it was, he recognized his unconscious host, and he was sitting
  demurely on the edge of a chair when Lethersohn burst into the room, his face
  white with fury.</p>

  <p>'What the hell is the meaning of this?' he demanded as he slammed the door
  behind him. 'By God, I'll have you arrested for impersonating me&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You guessed that I had telephoned&mdash;that was almost intelligent,'
  smiled Leon Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>The man swallowed.</p>

  <p>'Why are you here&mdash;I suppose it concerns the poor woman who escaped
  from a mental hospital today&mdash;I only just heard before I went
  out...'</p>

  <p>'So we gathered from the fact that your watchers have been on duty again
  tonight,' said Leon, 'but they were a little too late.'</p>

  <p>The man's face went a shade paler.</p>

  <p>'You've seen her?' he asked jerkily. 'And I suppose she told you a cock
  and bull story about me?'</p>

  <p>Leon took from his pocket a piece of discoloured linen and held it up.</p>

  <p>'You've not seen this?' he asked. 'When Mark Stamford died, this drawing
  was found on his sheet. He could draw these strange little things, you know
  that?'</p>

  <p>Lewis Lethersohn did not answer.</p>

  <p>'Shall I tell you what this is&mdash;it is his last will.</p>

  <p>'That's a lie!' croaked the other.</p>

  <p>'His last will,' nodded Leon sternly. 'Those three queer rhomboids are
  rough plans of his three estates. That house is a pretty fair picture of the
  Southern Bank premises and the little circles are money.'</p>

  <p>Lethersohn was staring at the drawing.</p>

  <p>'No court would accept that foolery,' he managed to say.</p>

  <p>Leon showed his teeth in a mirthless grin..</p>

  <p>'Nor the "awl" which means "all," nor the four strokes which stand as
  "for," nor the "Margaret," nor the final "Mark"? be asked.</p>

  <p>With an effort Lethersohn recovered his composure. 'My dear man, the idea
  is fantastical&mdash;he wrote a will with his own hand&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Leon stood with his head thrust forward. So far Lethersohn got, when:</p>

  <p>'He couldn't write!' he said softly, and Lethersohn turned pale. 'He could
  draw these pictures but he couldn't write his own name. If Mrs. Stamford had
  seen the registrar's certificate she would have seen that it was signed with
  a cross&mdash;that is why you put in the little bit about her not attempting
  to prove her marriage&mdash;why you kept her prisoner at Harlow in case she
  made independent inquiries.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly Lethersohn flew to his desk and jerked open a drawer. In a second
  an automatic appeared in his hand. Running back to the door, he flung it
  open.</p>

  <p>'Help... murder!' he shouted.</p>

  <p>He swung round on the motionless Gonsalez and, levelling his gun, pulled
  the trigger. A click&mdash;and no more.</p>

  <p>'I emptied the magazine,' said Leon coolly, 'so the little tragedy you so
  carefully staged has become a farce. Shall I telephone to the police or will
  you?'</p>

  <p>Scotland Yard men arrested Lewis Lethersohn as he was stepping on to the
  boat at Dover.</p>

  <p>'There may be some difficulty in proving the will,' said Manfred, reading
  the account in the evening newspapers; 'but the jury will not take long to
  put friend Lewis in his proper place...'</p>

  <p>Later, when they questioned Leon&mdash;Poiccart was all for pinning down
  his psychology&mdash;he condescended to explain.</p>

  <p>'The rebus told me he could not write&mdash;the fact that the will did not
  instruct Mrs. Stamford to marry Lewis showed me that he was married and loved
  his wife. The rest was ridiculously easy.'</p>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found<br>
  Reprinted in <i>The Saint Magazine</i>, UK edition, April 1959</h3>

  <p class="first">OF the three men who had their headquarters in Curzon
  Street, George Manfred was by far the best looking. His were the features and
  poise of an aristocrat. In a crowd he stood out by himself, not alone because
  of his height, but the imponderable something which distinguishes
  breeding.</p>

  <p>'George looks like a racehorse in a herd of Shetland ponies!' said the
  enthusiastic Leon Gonsalez on one occasion. Which was very nearly true.</p>

  <p>Yet it was Leon who attracted the average woman, and even women above the
  average. It was fatal to send him to deal with a case in which women were
  concerned, not because he himself was given to philandering, but because it
  was as certain as anything could be that he would come back leaving at least
  one sighing maiden to bombard him with letters ten pages long.</p>

  <p>Which really made him rather unhappy.</p>

  <p>'I'm old enough to be their father,' he wailed on one occasion, 'and as I
  live I said no more than "Good morning" to the wench. Had I held her hand or
  chanted a canto or two into her pink ear, I would stand condemned. But,
  George, I swear&mdash;'</p>

  <p>But George was helpless with laughter.</p>

  <p>Yet Leon could act the perfect lover. Once in Cordova he paid court to a
  certain senorita&mdash;three knife scars on his right breast testify to the
  success of his wooing. As to the two men who attacked him, they are dead, for
  by his courting he lured into the open the man for whom the police of Spain
  and France were searching.</p>

  <p>And he was especially effusive one spring morning to a slim and beautiful
  dark-eyed lady whom he met in Hyde Park. He was on foot, when he saw her
  walking past slowly and unattended. A graceful woman of thirty with a
  faultless skin and grey eyes that were almost black.</p>

  <p>It was by no accident that they met, for Leon had been studying her
  movements for weeks.</p>

  <p>'This is an answer to prayer, beautiful lady,' he said, and his
  extravagance was the more facile since he spoke in Italian.</p>

  <p>She laughed softly, gave him one swift, quizzical glance from under the
  long lashes, and signalled him to replace the hat that was now in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>'Good morning, Signor Carrelli,' she smiled, and gave him a small gloved
  hand. She was simply but expensively dressed. The only jewels she wore were
  the string of pearls about her white throat.</p>

  <p>'I see you everywhere,' she said. 'You were dining at the Carlton on
  Monday night, and before that I saw you in a box at a theatre, and yesterday
  afternoon I met you!'</p>

  <p>Leon showed his white teeth in a delighted smile.</p>

  <p>'That is true, illustrious lady,' he said, 'but you make no reference to
  my searching London to find somebody who would introduce me. Nor do you pity
  my despair as I followed you, feasting my eyes upon your beauty, or my
  sleepless nights&mdash;'</p>

  <p>All this he said with the fervour of a love-sick youth, and she listened
  without giving evidence of disapproval.</p>

  <p>'You shall walk with me,' she said, in the manner of a queen conveying an
  immense privilege.</p>

  <p>They strolled away from the crowd towards the open spaces of the park, and
  they talked of Rome and the hunting season, of runs on Campagna and the
  parties of Princess Leipnitz-Savalo&mdash;Leon read the society columns of
  the Roman press with great assiduity and remembered all that he read.</p>

  <p>They came at last to a place of trees and comfortable garden chairs. Leon
  paid the watchful attendant, and, after he had strolled away:</p>

  <p>'How beautiful it is to sit alone with divinity!' he began ecstatically.
  'For I tell you this, signorita... '</p>

  <p>'Tell me something else, Mr. Leon Gonsalez,' said the lady, and this time
  she spoke in English and her voice had the qualities of steel and ice. 'Why
  are you shadowing me?'</p>

  <p>If she expected to confound him it was because she did not know her
  Leon.</p>

  <p>'Because you are an extremely dangerous lady, Madame Koskina,' he said
  coolly, 'and all the more dangerous because the Lord has given you kissable
  lips and a graceful body. How many impressionable young attachés of embassies
  have discovered these charms in you!'</p>

  <p>She laughed at this and was seemingly well pleased.</p>

  <p>'You have been reading,' she said. 'No, my dear Mr. Gonsalez, I am out of
  politics&mdash;they bore me. Poor Ivan is in Russia struggling with the work
  of the Economic Commission and living in dread because of his well-known
  Liberal views, and I am in London, which is delightfully capitalistic and
  comfortable! Believe me, Leningrad is no place for a lady!'</p>

  <p>Isola Koskina had been Isola Caprevetti before she married a dashing young
  Russian attache. She had been a revolutionary from birth; and now she had
  developed a zeal for revolution that amounted to fanaticism.</p>

  <p>Leon smiled.</p>

  <p>'There are worse places for a lady even than Leningrad. I should be
  grieved indeed, my dear Isola, to see you making coarse shirts in Aylesbury
  convict establishment.'</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily, insolently.</p>

  <p>'That is a threat, and threats bore me. In Italy I have been threatened
  with... all sorts of dreadful things if I ever showed myself on the wrong
  side of the Simplon Pass. And really I am the most inoffensive person in the
  world, Monsieur Gonsalez. You are, or course, employed by the
  Government&mdash;how eminently respectable! Which Government?'</p>

  <p>Leon grinned, but was serious again in a second.</p>

  <p>'The Italian frontiers are practically closed since the last attempt,' he
  said. 'You and your friends are causing everybody an immense amount of
  trouble. Naturally the Government are concerned. They do not wish to wake up
  one morning and find that they are implicated, and that some successful
  assassin made a jump from&mdash;England, shall we say?'</p>

  <p>The lady shrugged her pretty shoulders. 'How very dramatic! And therefore
  poor Isola Koskina must be watched by detectives and reformed
  murderers&mdash;I suppose you and your precious comrades are reformed?'</p>

  <p>The smile on the thin face of Leon Gonsalez widened. 'If we were not,
  signorita, what would happen? Should I be sitting here talking pretty-pretty
  talk with you? Would you not be picked out of the Thames at Limehouse all
  cold and clammy some morning, and lie on the slab till a coroner's jury
  returned a verdict of "Found drowned"?'</p>

  <p>He saw the colour leave her face: fear came to her eyes. 'You had better
  threaten Ivan&mdash;' she began.</p>

  <p>'I will cable him: he is not in Leningrad but living in Berlin under the
  name of Petersohn&mdash;Martin Lutherstrasse 904. How easy it would be if we
  were not reformed! A dead man in a gutter and a policeman searching his
  pockets for a card of identity&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She rose hurriedly; her very lips were bloodless.</p>

  <p>'You do not amuse me,' she said and, turning from him, walked quickly
  away.</p>

  <p>Leon made no attempt to follow her. It was two days after this encounter
  that the letter came. Many people wrote to the Just Men, a few abusively,
  quite a number fatuously. But now and again there could be extracted from the
  morning correspondence quite a pretty little problem. And the dingy letter
  with its finger-marks and creases was quite worth the amount that the postman
  charged them&mdash;for it came unstamped. The address was:</p>

  <p class="quote">Four Just Men, Curzon Street, May Fair,<br>
  West End, London.</p>

  <p>The writing was that of an illiterate, and the letter went:</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR SIR,</p>

  <p class="letter">You are surposed to go in for misteries well hear is a
  mistery. I was a boiler makers mate in Hollingses but now out of work and one
  Sunday I was photoed by a foren lady she come in front of me with a camra and
  took me. There was a lot of chaps in the park but she only took me. Then she
  ast me my name and address and ast me if I knew a clergyman. And when I said
  yes she wrote down the name of the Rev J. Crewe, and then she said shed send
  me a picture dear sir she didn't send me a pictur but ast me to joyne the
  Happy Travlers to go to Swizzleland Rome, etc. and nothing to pay all
  expences payed also loss of time (Ten £) and soots of close everything done
  in stile. Well dear sir I got ready and she did everything close ten £
  &amp;c. also she got tickets &amp;c. But now the lady says I got to go to
  Devonshire not that I mind. Now dear sir thats a mistery because I just met a
  gentleman from Leeds and has had his photo took and joyned the Happy Travlers
  and hes going to Cornwall and this lady who took the picture of him ast him
  if he knew a clergyman and wrote it down. Now what is the mistery is it
  something to do with religion? Yours Sincerely, T. B A R G E R.</p><br>

  <p>George Manfred read the ill-spelt scrawl and threw the letter across the
  breakfast table to Leon Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>'Read me that riddle, Leon,' he said.</p>

  <p>Leon read and frowned.</p>

  <p>'"Happy Travellers," eh? That's odd.'</p>

  <p>The letter went to Raymond, who studied it with an expressionless
  face.</p>

  <p>'Eh, Raymond?' Leon asked, his eyes alight.</p>

  <p>'I think so,' said Raymond, nodding slowly.</p>

  <p>'Will you let me into your "mistery"?' asked Manfred.</p>

  <p>Leon chuckled.</p>

  <p>'No mystery at all, my dear George. I will see this T. Barger, whose name
  is surely "Thomas" and will learn certain particulars as, for example, the
  colour of his eyes and the testimonial he has received from the Foreign
  Secretary.'</p>

  <p>'Mistery on mistery,' murmured George Manfred as he sipped his
  coffee&mdash;though in truth the matter was no longer a mystery to him. The
  reference to the Foreign Secretary was very illuminating.</p>

  <p>'As to the lady&mdash;' said Leon, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>His big Bentley created a mild sensation in the street where T. Barger
  lived. It was situated near the East India Dock, and T. Barger&mdash;whose
  front name was surprisingly Theophilus&mdash;proved to be a tall, dark man of
  thirty with a small black moustache and rather heavy black eyebrows. He was
  obviously wearing his new 'soot' and had expended at least a portion of his
  'ten £' on alcoholic refreshment, for he was in a loud and confident
  mood.</p>

  <p>'I'm leavin' tomorrow,' he said thickly, 'for Torquay&mdash;everything
  paid. Travellin' like a swell... first class. You one of them Justers!'</p>

  <p>Leon induced him to go into the house.</p>

  <p>'It's a myst'ry to me,' said Mr. Barger, 'why she done it. Happy
  Trav'ler&mdash;that's what I am. She might have took me abroad&mdash;I'd like
  to have seen them mountains, but she says if I don't speak the Swiss language
  I'd be out of it. Anyway, what's the matter with Torquay?'</p>

  <p>'The other man is going to Cornwall?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Barger nodded solemnly. 'An' his mate's goin' to Somerset&mdash;funny
  meetin' him at all...' He explained the coincidence, which had to do with a
  public-house where Mr. Barger had called for a drink.</p>

  <p>'What was his name?'</p>

  <p>'Rigson&mdash;Harry Rigson. I told him mine, he told me his. The other
  man? Harry's pal? I call him Harry&mdash;we're like pals&mdash;now let me
  think, mister...'</p>

  <p>Leon let him think.</p>

  <p>Tunny name... Coke... no, Soke... Lokely! That's it&mdash;Joe Lokely.'</p>

  <p>Leon asked a few more questions which were seemingly irrelevant but were
  not.</p>

  <p>'Of course I had to be passed by the committee,' said the communicative
  Theophilus. 'Accordin' to Harry, this lady photoed a friend of his but he
  didn't pass.'</p>

  <p>'I see,' said Leon. 'What time do you leave for Devonshire?'</p>

  <p>'Tomorrow mornin'&mdash;seven o'clock. Bit early, ain't it? But this lady
  says that Happy Travellers must be early risers. Harry's goin' by the same
  train but in another coach...'</p>

  <p>Leon went back to Curzon Street well satisfied. The question he had to
  decide was: was Isola an early riser too?</p>

  <p>'I hardly think so,' said Raymond Poiccart. 'She would not take the
  risk&mdash;especially if she knows that she is watched.'</p>

  <p>That night Scotland Yard was a very hive of industry, and Leon Gonsalez
  did without sleep. Fortunately Isola had been under police observation, and
  the Yard knew every district in England she had visited for the past month.
  By midnight two thousand ministers of religion had been awakened from their
  sleep by local police and asked to furnish certain particulars.</p>

  <p>Isola went to a dinner and dance that night and her partner was a very
  nice young man, tall and dark of face. She chose the L'Orient, which is the
  most exclusive and plutocratic of night clubs. Men and women turned to admire
  or criticize her beauty as she entered, a radiant figure in a scarlet dress
  with a dull gold stole. The colours set off the glories of her lovely face,
  and there was sinuous grace in every movement.</p>

  <p>They had reached the dessert when suddenly she laid two fingers on the
  table-cloth.</p>

  <p>'Who is it?' asked her companion carelessly as he saw the danger
  signal.</p>

  <p>'The man I told you about&mdash;he is at the table immediately
  opposite.'</p>

  <p>Presently the dark young man looked.</p>

  <p>'So that is the famous Gonsalez! A wisp of a man that I could
  break&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'A wisp of a man who has broken giants, Emilo,' she interrupted. 'Have you
  heard of Saccoriva&mdash;was he not a giant? That man killed him&mdash;shot
  him down in his own headquarters when there was a guard of revolutionary
  brethren within call&mdash;and escaped!'</p>

  <p>'He is anti-revolutionary?' Emilo was impressed.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. 'Comrade Saccoriva was very foolish&mdash;with women.
  It was over some girl he had taken&mdash;and left. He is looking this way: I
  will call him over.'</p>

  <p>Leon rose lazily at the signal and came across the crowded dance
  floor.</p>

  <p>'Signorita, you will never forgive me!' he said in despair. 'Here am I
  watching you again! And yet I only came here because I was bored.'</p>

  <p>'Bore me also,' she said with her sweetest smile, and then, remembering
  her companion: 'This is Herr Halz from Leipzig.'</p>

  <p>Leon's eyes twinkled.</p>

  <p>'Your friends change their nationalities as often as they change their
  names,' he said. 'I remember Herr Halz of Leipzig when he was Emilo Cassini
  of Turin!'</p>

  <p>Emilo shifted uncomfortably, but Isola was amused.</p>

  <p>'This man is omniscient! Dance with me, Senor Gonsalez, and promise that
  you will not murder me!'</p>

  <p>They went twice round the dance floor before Leon spoke. 'If I had your
  face and figure and youth, I should have a good time and not bother with
  politics,' he said.</p>

  <p>'And if I had your wisdom and cunning I should remove tyrants from their
  high positions,' she retorted, her voice quivering.</p>

  <p>That was all that was said. Going out into the vestibule, Leon discovered
  the girl and her escort waiting. It was raining heavily and Isola's car could
  not be found.</p>

  <p>'May I drop you, gracious lady?' Leon's smile was most entrancing. 'I have
  a poor car but it is at your disposition.'</p>

  <p>Isola hesitated.</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' she said.</p>

  <p>Leon, ever the soul of politeness, insisted on taking one of the seats
  that put his back to the driver. It was not his own car. Usually he was very
  nervous about other drivers, but tonight he did not mind.</p>

  <p>They crossed Trafalgar Square.</p>

  <p>'The man is taking the wrong turning,' said Isola with quick
  vehemence.</p>

  <p>'This is the right road to Scotland Yard,' said Leon. 'We call this the
  Way of the Happy Traveller&mdash;keep your hand away from your pocket, Emilo.
  I have killed men on less provocation, and I have been covering you ever
  since we left the club!'</p>

  <p>In the early hours of the morning telegrams were despatched to police
  headquarters at Folkestone and Dover:</p>

  <p>'Arrest and detain Theophilus Barger, Joseph Lokely, Harry
  Rigson'&mdash;here followed five other names&mdash;'travelling to the
  Continent by boat either today or tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>There was no need to give instructions about Isola. For a perfect lady,
  her behaviour was indefensible.</p>

  <p>'She blotted her copybook,' said Leon sadly. 'I've never seen a Happy
  Traveller less happy when we got her to Scotland Yard.'</p>

  <p>Considering the matter at the morning conference which was part of the
  daily routine in Curzon Street, Manfred was inclined to regard the plot as
  elementary.</p>

  <p>'If you speak disparagingly of my genius and power of deduction I shall
  burst into tears,' said Leon. 'Raymond thinks I was clever&mdash;I will not
  have that verdict challenged. George, you're getting old and grouchy.'</p>

  <p>'The detection was clever,' Manfred hastened to placate his smiling
  friend.</p>

  <p>'And the scheme was clever,' insisted Leon, 'and terribly like Isola. One
  of these days she'll do something awfully original and be shot. Obviously,
  what she set out to do was to collect seven men who bore some resemblance to
  the members of her murder gang. When she had found them, she made them get
  passports&mdash;that of course is why she asked if they knew a clergyman, for
  a padre's signature on the photograph and application form is as good as a
  lawyer's. Seven poor innocent men with passports which she handed over to her
  friends while the happy travellers were sent into out-of-the-way places. She
  was heading the gang into Italy&mdash;all the passports were visaed for that
  country.'</p>

  <p>'Tell me,' said Manfred, 'did they arrest the spurious T. Barger at
  Dover?'</p>

  <p>Leon shook his head.</p>

  <p>'The man who was to have travelled with T. Barger's passport was one Emilo
  Casbini&mdash;I spotted the likeness immediately. Isola was very
  abusive&mdash;but I quietened her by suggesting that her husband might like
  to know something about her friendship with Emilo... I have been watching
  Isola for a long time and I have seen things.'</p>

  <h2><a name="story03"
     id="story03">III .&mdash; THE ABDUCTOR</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was a year since Lord Geydrew invoked the aid of the Just
  Men who lived at the sign of the Triangle in Curzon Street. He was a
  narrow-headed man; the first time they met with him, Poiccart hazarded the
  opinion that he was constitutionally mean. The last time they met it was not
  so much an opinion as stark knowledge, for his lordship had most boldly
  repudiated the bill of expenses that Poiccart had rendered&mdash;even though
  Manfred and Gonsalez had risked their lives to recover the lost Geydrew
  diamond.</p>

  <p>The Three did not take him to court. Not one of them had need of money.
  Manfred was satisfied with the experience; Poiccart was cock-a-hoop because a
  theory of his had worked home; Gonsalez found his consolation in the shape of
  the client's head.</p>

  <p>'The most interesting recession of the parietal and malformation of the
  occiput I have ever seen,' he said enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>The Just Men shared one extraordinary gift&mdash;a prodigious memory for
  faces and an extraordinary facility for attaching those faces to disreputable
  names. There was, however, no credit due for remembering the head of his
  lordship.</p>

  <p>Manfred was sitting in his small room overlooking Curzon Street one night
  in spring, and he was in his most thoughtful mood when Poiccart&mdash;who
  invariably undertook the job of butler&mdash;came hobbling in to announce
  Lord Geydrew.</p>

  <p>'Not the Geydrew of Gallat Towers?' Manfred could be massively ironical.
  'Has he come to pay his bill?'</p>

  <p>'God knows,' said Poiccart piously. 'Do peers of the realm pay their
  bills? For the moment I am less concerned about the peerage than I am about
  my ankle&mdash;really, Leon is a careless devil. I had to take a taxi...
  .'</p>

  <p>Manfred chuckled. 'He will be penitent and interesting,' he said, 'as for
  his lordship. Show him up.'</p>

  <p>Lord Geydrew came in a little nervously, blinking at the bright light that
  burnt on Manfred's table. Evidently he was unusually agitated. The weak mouth
  was tremulous, he opened and closed his eyes with a rapidity for which the
  bright light was not wholly responsible. His long, lined face was twitching
  spasmodically; from time to time he thrust his fingers through the scanty,
  reddish-grey hair.</p>

  <p>'I hope, Mr. Manfred, there is no&mdash;um&mdash;er&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He fumbled in his pocket, produced an oblong slip of paper and pushed it
  across the desk. Manfred looked and wondered. Poiccart, forgetful of his role
  as butler, watched interestedly. Besides, there was no need to pretend that
  he was anything but what he was.</p>

  <p>Lord Geydrew looked from one to the other.</p>

  <p>'I was hoping your friend&mdash;um&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Gonsalez is out: he will be back later in the evening,' said Manfred,
  wondering what was coming.</p>

  <p>Then his lordship collapsed with a groan, and let his head fall upon the
  arms that lay on the desk.</p>

  <p>'Oh, my God!' he wailed... 'The most terrible thing... It doesn't bear
  thinking about.'</p>

  <p>Manfred waited patiently. Presently the older man looked up.</p>

  <p>'I must tell you the story from the beginning, Mr. Manfred,' he said. 'My
  daughter Angela&mdash;you may have met her?'</p>

  <p>Manfred shook his head.</p>

  <p>'She was married this morning. To Mr. Guntheimer, a very wealthy
  Australian banker and an immensely nice fellow.' He shook his head and dabbed
  his eyes with a handkerchief.</p>

  <p>Light was beginning to dawn on Manfred.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Guntheimer is considerably older than my daughter,' his lordship went
  on, 'and I will not conceal from you the fact that Angela has certain
  objections to the match. In fact, she had very stupidly arrived at some sort
  of understanding with young Sidworth&mdash;good family and all that, but not
  a penny in the world... It would have been madness.'</p>

  <p>Manfred now understood quite clearly.</p>

  <p>'We had to hurry the marriage, since Guntheimer is leaving for Australia
  much earlier than he expected. Happily my daughter gave way to my legitimate
  wishes and they were married this morning at a registrar's office and were
  due to leave for the Isle of Wight by the three o'clock train.</p>

  <p>'We did not go to see her off, and the only account I have of the
  occurrence was from the mouth of my son-in-law. He said that he was walking
  up to his reserved compartment, when suddenly he missed my daughter from his
  side. He looked round, retraced his steps, but could see nothing of her.
  Thinking that she might have gone ahead, he returned to the compartment, but
  it was empty. He then went back beyond the barrier: she was not in sight, but
  a porter whom he had engaged to carry his luggage and who followed him, said
  that he had seen her in earnest conversation with an elderly man and that
  they walked into the booking hall together and disappeared. Another porter on
  duty in the courtyard of the station saw them get into a car and drive
  off.'</p>

  <p>Manfred was jotting down his notes on his blotting-pad. Poiccart never
  lifted his eyes from the visitor.</p>

  <p>'The story the porter tells&mdash;the outside porter, I mean, went on his
  lordship, 'is that my daughter seemed reluctant to go, and that she was
  almost thrust into the car, which had to pass him. As the car came abreast,
  the man was pulling down the blinds, and the porter says that he has no doubt
  that my daughter was struggling with him.'</p>

  <p>'With the elderly man?' said Manfred.</p>

  <p>Lord Geydrew nodded.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Manfred'&mdash;his voice was a wail&mdash;'I am not a rich man, and
  perhaps I would be wise to leave this matter in the hands of the police. But
  I have such extraordinary faith in your intelligence and acumen&mdash;I think
  you will find that cheque right&mdash;and in spite of your exorbitant charges
  I wish to engage you. She is my only daughter...' His voice broke.</p>

  <p>'Did the porter take the number of the car?'</p>

  <p>Lord Geydrew shook his head. 'No,' he said. 'Naturally I wish to keep this
  out of the press&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid you've failed,' said Manfred, and took a paper from a basket
  that was at his side, pointing out a paragraph in the stop press.</p>

  <p>"REPORTED ABDUCTION OF BRIDE</p>

  <p>"It is reported that a bride, just before leaving Waterloo on her
  honeymoon trip, was forcibly abducted by an elderly man. Scotland Yard have
  been notified."</p>

  <p>'Porters will talk,' said Manfred, leaning back in his chair. 'Have the
  police a theory?'</p>

  <p>'None,' snapped his lordship.</p>

  <p>'Has Mr. Sidworth been interviewed?'</p>

  <p>Lord Geydrew shook his head vigorously.</p>

  <p>'Naturally that was the first thought I had. Sidworth, I thought, has
  persuaded this unfortunate girl&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Is he an elderly man?' asked Manfred, with a twinkle in his eye which
  only Poiccart understood.</p>

  <p>'Of course he isn't,' snapped his lordship. 'I told you he was young. At
  the present moment he's staying with some very dear friends of mine at
  Newbury&mdash;I think he took the marriage rather badly. At any rate, my
  friend says that he has not left Kingshott Manor all day, and that he has not
  once used the telephone.'</p>

  <p>Manfred rubbed his shapely nose thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'And Mr. Guntheimer&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'Naturally he's distracted. I have never known a man so upset. He's almost
  mad with grief. Can you gentlemen give me any hope?'</p>

  <p>He looked from one to the other, and his lean face brightened at Manfred's
  nod.</p>

  <p>'Where is Mr. Guntheimer staying?' asked Poiccart, breaking his
  silence.</p>

  <p>'At the Gayborough Hotel,' said Lord Geydrew.</p>

  <p>'Another point&mdash;what was his present to the bride?' asked
  Manfred.</p>

  <p>His visitor looked surprised, and then: 'A hundred thousand pounds,' he
  said impressively. 'Mr. Guntheimer doesn't believe in our old method of
  settlement. I may say that his cheque for that amount is in my pocket
  now.'</p>

  <p>'And your present to the bride?' asked Manfred.</p>

  <p>Lord Geydrew showed some signs of impatience.</p>

  <p>'My dear fellow, you're on the wrong track. Angela was not spirited away
  for purposes of property. The jewel case containing her diamonds was carried
  by Guntheimer. She had nothing of value in her possession except for a few
  odd pounds in her handbag.'</p>

  <p>Manfred rose.</p>

  <p>'I think that is all I want to ask you, Lord Geydrew. Unless I'm greatly
  mistaken, your daughter will come back to you in twenty-four hours.'</p>

  <p>Poiccart showed the comforted man to his car, and returned to find Manfred
  reading the sporting column in an evening newspaper.</p>

  <p>'Well?' asked Poiccart.</p>

  <p>'A curious case and one in which my soul revels.' He put down the paper
  and stretched himself. 'If Leon comes in, will you ask him to wait my return
  unless there is something urgent takes him elsewhere?' He lifted his head. 'I
  think that is him,' he said, at the sound of squealing brakes.</p>

  <p>Poiccart shook his head.</p>

  <p>'Leon is more noiseless,' he said, and went down to admit an agitated
  young man.</p>

  <p>Mr. Harry Sidworth was that type of youth for which Manfred had a very
  soft spot. Lank of body, healthy of face, he had all the incoherence of his
  age.</p>

  <p>'I say, are you Mr. Manfred?' he began, almost before he got into the
  room. 'I've been to that old devil's house and his secretary told me to come
  here, though for the Lord's sake don't tell anybody he said so!'</p>

  <p>'You're Mr. Sidworth, of course?'</p>

  <p>The young man nodded vigorously. His face was anxious, his air wild; he
  was too young to hide his evident distress.</p>

  <p>'Isn't it too terrible for words&mdash;' he began.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Sidworth'&mdash;Manfred fixed him with a kindly eye&mdash;'you've
  come to ask me about your Angela, and I'm telling you, as I told Lord
  Geydrew, that I'm perfectly certain that she will come back to you unharmed.
  There's one thing I might ask&mdash;how long has she known her husband?'</p>

  <p>The young man made a wry face.</p>

  <p>'That's a hateful word to me,' he groaned. 'Guntheimer? About three
  months. He isn't a bad fellow. I've nothing against him, except that he got
  Angela. Old Geydrew thought I'd taken her away. He rang up the people I was
  staying with, and that was the first news I had that she'd disappeared. It's
  the most ghastly thing that's ever happened to me.'</p>

  <p>'Have you heard from her lately?' asked Manfred.</p>

  <p>Sidworth nodded.</p>

  <p>'Yes, this morning,' he said dolefully. 'Just a little note thanking me
  for my wedding present. I gave her a jewel case&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'A what?' asked Manfred sharply, and the young man, surprised at his
  vehemence, stared at him.</p>

  <p>'A jewel case&mdash;my sister bought one about a month ago, and Angela was
  so taken with it that I had an exact copy made.'</p>

  <p>Manfred was looking at him absently.</p>

  <p>'Your sister?' he said slowly. 'Where does your sister live?'</p>

  <p>'Why, she's at Maidenhead,' said the young man, surprised.</p>

  <p>Manfred looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>'Eight o'clock,' he said. 'This is going to be rather an amusing
  evening.'</p>

  <p>The clocks were striking the half-hour after ten when the telephone in Mr.
  Guntheimer's private suite buzzed softly. Guntheimer ceased his restless
  pacing and went to the instrument.</p>

  <p>'I can't see anybody,' he said. 'Who?' He frowned. 'All right, I'll see
  him.'</p>

  <p>It had been raining heavily and Manfred apologized for his wet raincoat
  and waited for an invitation to remove it. But apparently Mr. Guntheimer was
  too preoccupied with his unhappy thoughts to be greatly concerned about his
  duties as host.</p>

  <p>He was a tall, good-looking man, rather haggard of face now, and the hand
  that stroked the iron-grey moustache trembled a little.</p>

  <p>'Geydrew told me he was going to see you&mdash;what is your explanation of
  this extraordinary happening, Mr. Manfred?'</p>

  <p>Manfred smiled.</p>

  <p>'The solution is a very simple one, Mr. Guntheimer,' he said. 'It is to be
  found in the pink diamond.'</p>

  <p>'In the what?' asked the other, startled.</p>

  <p>'Your wife has a rather nice diamond brooch,' said Manfred. 'Unless I am
  misinformed, the third from the end of the bar is of a distinctly pinkish
  hue. It is, or was, the property of the Rajah of Komitar, and on its topmost
  facet you will find an Arabic word, meaning "Happiness."'</p>

  <p>Guntheimer was gazing at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>'What has that to do with it?'</p>

  <p>Again Manfred smiled.</p>

  <p>'If there is a pink diamond and it is inscribed as I say, I can find your
  wife, not in twenty-four but in six hours.'</p>

  <p>Guntheimer fingered his chin thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'That matter's easily settled,' he said. 'My wife's jewels are in the
  hotel safe. Just wait.'</p>

  <p>He was gone five minutes and returned carrying a small scarlet box. He put
  this on the table and opened it with a key which he took from his pocket.
  Lifting the lid, he took out a pad of wash-leather and revealed a trayful of
  glittering jewels.</p>

  <p>'There's no brooch there,' he said after a search; he pulled out the tray
  and examined the padded bottom of the box.</p>

  <p>There were brooches and bars of all kinds. Manfred pointed to one, and
  this was inspected&mdash;but there was no pink diamond; nor was there in any
  other brooch.</p>

  <p>'Is that the best you can do in the way of detective work?' demanded Mr.
  Guntheimer as he closed and locked the box. 'I thought that tale was a little
  fantastic... '</p>

  <p>Crash! A stone came hurtling through the window, smashing the glass, and
  fell on the carpet. With an oath Guntheimer spun round.</p>

  <p>'What was that?'</p>

  <p>He grabbed the jewel box that was on the table and ran to the window.
  Outside the window was a small balcony which ran the length of the
  building.</p>

  <p>'Somebody standing on the balcony must have thrown that,' said
  Guntheimer.</p>

  <p>The sound of smashing glass had been heard in the Corridor, and two hotel
  servants came in and examined the damage without, however, offering a
  solution to the mystery.</p>

  <p>Manfred waited until the distracted bridegroom had locked away the jewel
  box in a strong trunk, and by this time Guntheimer was in a better
  humour.</p>

  <p>'I've heard about you fellows,' he said, 'and I know you're pretty clever;
  otherwise, I should have thought that story of the pink diamond was all
  bunkum. Perhaps you will tell me what the Rajah of Who-was-it has to do with
  Angela's disappearance?'</p>

  <p>Manfred was biting his lip thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'I don't wish to alarm you,' he said slowly. 'But has it occurred to you,
  Mr. Guntheimer, that you may share her fate?'</p>

  <p>Again that quick turn and look of apprehension.</p>

  <p>'I don't quite understand you.'</p>

  <p>'I wondered if you would,' said Manfred and, holding out his hand, he left
  his astonished host staring after him.</p>

  <p>When he got to Curzon Street he found Gonsalez, his head in one deep
  armchair, his feet on another. Apparently Poiccart, who had reached home
  first, had told him of the callers, for he was holding forth on women.</p>

  <p>'They are wilful, they are unreasonable,' he said bitterly. 'You remember,
  George, that woman at Cordova, how we saved her life from her lover and how
  we barely saved our own at her infuriated hands&mdash;there should be a law
  prohibiting women from possessing firearms. Here is a case in point. Tomorrow
  the newspapers will tell you the harrowing story of a bride torn from the
  arms of her handsome bridegroom. The old ladies of Bayswater will shed tears
  over the tragedy, knowing nothing of the aching heart of Mr. Harry Sidworth
  or the great inconvenience to which this strange and tragic happening has put
  George Manfred, Raymond Poiccart, and Leon Gonsalez.'</p>

  <p>Manfred opened the safe in a corner of the room and put into it something
  he had taken from his pocket. Characteristically, Gonsalez asked no
  questions, and it was remarkable and significant that nobody discussed the
  pink diamond.</p>

  <p>The following morning passed uneventfully, save that Leon had much to say
  about the hardness of the drawing-room sofa, where he had spent the night,
  and the three men had finished lunch and were sitting smoking over their
  coffee, when a ring of the bell took Poiccart into the hall.</p>

  <p>'Geydrew, full of bad tidings,' said George Manfred, as the sound of a
  voice came to them.</p>

  <p>Lord Geydrew it was, shrill with his tremendous information.</p>

  <p>'Have you heard the news?... Guntheimer has disappeared! The waiter went
  to his room this morning, could get no answer, opened the door with his key
  and walked in. The bed had not been slept in... all his luggage was there,
  and on the floor&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Let me guess,' said Manfred, and held his forehead. 'The jewel case was
  smashed to smithereens, without a single jewel in it! Or was it&mdash;'</p>

  <p>But Lord Geydrew's face told him that his first guess was accurate.</p>

  <p>'How did you know?' he gasped. 'It wasn't in the papers&mdash;my God, this
  is awful!'</p>

  <p>In his agitation, he did not notice that Leon Gonsalez had slipped from
  the room, and only missed him when he turned to find the one man in whom, for
  some extraordinary reason, he had faith.</p>

  <p>('Geydrew never did trust you or me,' said George afterwards.)</p>

  <p>'I'm ashamed to confess it,' smiled Manfred. 'That was sheer guesswork.
  The jewel case had the appearance of being jumped on&mdash;I don't
  wonder!'</p>

  <p>'But&mdash;but&mdash;' stammered the nobleman, and at that minute the door
  opened and he stood amazed.</p>

  <p>A smiling girl was there, and in another instant was in his arms.</p>

  <p>'Here's your Angela,' said Leon, with great coolness, 'and with all due
  respect to everybody, I shan't be sorry to sleep in my own bed tonight.
  George, that sofa must be sent back to the brigands who supplied it.'</p>

  <p>But George was at the safe, lifting out a red leather jewel case.</p>

  <p>It was a long time before Geydrew was calm enough to hear the story.</p>

  <p>'My friend Leon Gonsalez,' said Manfred, 'has a wonderful memory for
  faces&mdash;so have we all, for the matter of that. But Leon is specially
  gifted. He was waiting at Waterloo to drive friend Poiccart home. Raymond had
  been to Winchester to see a surgeon friend of ours over a matter of a
  sprained leg. Whilst Leon was waiting he saw Guntheimer and your daughter and
  instantly recognized Guntheimer whose other name is Lanstry, or Smith, or
  Malikin. Guntheimer's graft is bigamy, and Leon happens to know him rather
  well. A few inquiries made of the porter, and he discovered, not the identity
  of your daughter, but that this man had married that day. He approached
  Angela with a cock and bull story that some mysterious body was waiting to
  see her outside the station. I will not say that she imagined that mysterious
  body was Harry Sidworth, but at any rate she went very willingly. She showed
  some little fight when friend Leon pushed her into the car and drove away
  with her&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Anybody who has tried to drive a car and control an infuriated and
  terrified lady will sympathize with me,' broke in Leon.</p>

  <p>'By the time Miss Angela Geydrew reached Curzon Street she was in full
  possession of the facts as Leon knew them,' Manfred went on. 'Leon's one
  object was to postpone the honeymoon until he could get somebody to identify
  Guntheimer. The young lady told us nothing about her jewel case, but we all
  guessed the hundred-thousand-pound cheque, presented too late to be banked;
  before it could be cleared, Guntheimer would be well out of the country with
  any loot he was able to gather&mdash;in this case the family
  diamonds&mdash;and of course it would have been pretty easy to arrest him
  last night. When your lordship called yesterday Leon was out finishing his
  investigations. Before he returned, I learnt where I could get a duplicate
  jewel box, and with Poiccart made a call on friend bigamist. Poiccart was on
  the balcony, listening, and at an agreed word signal he smashed the window,
  which gave me just the opportunity I wanted to change the jewel boxes. Later,
  I presume, Mr. Guntheimer opened the box, found it was empty, realized the
  game was up and fled.'</p>

  <p>'But how did you induce him to show you the jewel box?' asked Lord
  Geydrew.</p>

  <p>Manfred smiled cryptically. The tale of the pink diamond was too crude to
  be repeated.</p>

  <h2><a name="story04"
     id="story04">IV .&mdash; THE THIRD COINCIDENCE</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">LEON GONSALEZ, like the famous scientist, had an unholy
  knack of collecting coincidences. He had, too, strange faiths, and believed
  that if a man saw a pink cow with one horn in the morning, he must, by the
  common workings of a certain esoteric law, meet another pink cow with one
  horn later in the day.</p>

  <p>'Coincidences, my dear George,' he said, 'are inevitabilities&mdash;not
  accidents.'</p>

  <p>Manfred murmured something in reply&mdash;he was studying the dossier of
  one William Yape, of whom something may be told at a later period.</p>

  <p>'Now here is a coincidence.' Leon was in no sense abashed, for it was
  after dinner, the hour of the day when he was most confident. 'This morning I
  took the car for a run to Windsor&mdash;she was a trifle sticky
  yesterday&mdash;and at Langley what did I find? A gentleman sitting before an
  inn, very drunk. He was, I imagined, an agricultural labourer in his best
  Sunday suit, and it was remarkable that he wore a diamond ring worth five
  hundred pounds. He had, he told me, been to Canada, and had stayed at the
  Chateau Fronteuse&mdash;which is an expensive hotel.'</p>

  <p>Poiccart was interested.</p>

  <p>'And the coincidence?'</p>

  <p>'If George will listen.' Manfred looked up with a groan. 'Thank you.
  Hardly had I begun questioning this inebriated son of the soil when a Rolls
  drove up, and there stepped down a rather nice-looking gentleman who also
  wore a diamond ring on his little finger.'</p>

  <p>'Sensation,' said George Manfred, and went back to his dossier.</p>

  <p>'I shall be offended if you do not listen. Imagine the agriculturist
  suddenly jumping to his feet as if he had seen a ghost. "Ambrose!" he gasped.
  I tell you his face was the colour of milk. Ambrose&mdash;if he will pardon
  the liberty&mdash;could not have heard him, and passed into the inn. The
  labourer went stumbling away&mdash;it is remarkable that one's head sobers so
  much more quickly than one's legs&mdash;as though the devil was after
  him.</p>

  <p>'I went into the inn and found Ambrose drinking tea&mdash;a man who drinks
  tea at eleven o'clock in the morning has lived either in South Africa or
  Australia. It proved to be South Africa. An alluvial diamond digger, an
  ex-soldier and a most gentlemanly person, though not very communicative.
  After he had gone I went in search of the labourer&mdash;overtook him as he
  entered a most flamboyant villa.'</p>

  <p>'Which, with your peculiar disregard for the sacredness of the
  Englishman's home, you entered.'</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>'Truth is in you,' he said. 'Imagine, my dear George, a suburban villa so
  filled with useless furniture that you could hardly find a place to sit.
  Satin-covered settees, pseudo-Chinese cabinets, whatnots and wherefores
  crowding space. Ridiculous oil paintings, painted by the yard, in heavy gold
  frames, simpering enlargements of photographs covering hideous
  wallpaper&mdash;and two ladies, expensively dressed, bediamonded but without
  an "h" between them; common as the dirt on my shoes, shrill, ugly,
  coarse.</p>

  <p>'As I entered the hall on the trail of the labourer I heard him say: "He
  wasn't killed&mdash;he's back," and a woman say:</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" And then the second woman said: "He must be killed&mdash;it
  was in the list on New Year's Day!"&mdash;after which I was so busy
  explaining my presence that further enlightenment was out of the
  question.'</p>

  <p>George Manfred had tied his dossier neatly with a strip of red tape, and
  now he leaned back in his chair.</p>

  <p>'You took the number of the Ambrose car, of course?'</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>'And he wore a diamond ring?'</p>

  <p>'A lady's&mdash;it was on his little finger. A not very magnificent
  affair. It was the sort of dress ring that a girl would wear.'</p>

  <p>Poiccart chuckled.</p>

  <p>'Now we sit down and wait for the third coincidence,' he said. 'It is
  inevitable.'</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Leon was on his way to Fleet Street, for he was a man
  whose curiosity was insatiable. For two hours, in the office of a friendly
  newspaper, he pored over the casualty lists that were published on four New
  Year's Days, looking for a soldier whose first name was 'Ambrose'.</p>

  <p>'The Three Just Men,' said the Assistant Commissioner cheerfully, 'are now
  so eminently respectable that we give them police protection.'</p>

  <p>You must allow for the fact that this was after dinner, when even an
  Assistant Commissioner grows a little expansive, especially when he is host
  in his nice house in Belgravia. You must also allow for the more interesting
  fact that one of the famous organization had been seen outside Colonel
  Yenford's house that very night.</p>

  <p>'They are strange devils&mdash;why they should be watching this place
  beats me; if I'd known I should have asked the fellow in!'</p>

  <p>Lady Irene Belvinne looked at one of the portraits on the wall: she seemed
  scarcely interested in the Three Just Men. Yet every word Colonel Yenford
  spoke was eagerly stored in her memory.</p>

  <p>A beautiful woman of thirty-five, the widow of a man who had held Cabinet
  rank, she might claim to be especially favoured. She had been the wife of a
  many-times millionaire who had left her his entire fortune; she had the
  lineless face and serene poise of one who had never known care...</p>

  <p>'I don't exactly know what they do?' Her voice was a soft drawl. 'Are they
  detectives? Of course, I know what they were.'</p>

  <p>Who did not know what that ruthless trio were in the days when every hand
  was against them? When swift death followed their threat, when a whole world
  of secret lawbreakers trembled at their names.</p>

  <p>'They're tame enough now,' said somebody. 'They wouldn't have played their
  monkey tricks today, eh, Yenford?'</p>

  <p>Colonel Yenford was not so confident.</p>

  <p>'It's strange,' mused Irene. 'I didn't think of them.'</p>

  <p>She was so wholly absorbed in her thoughts that she did not realize she
  was speaking aloud.</p>

  <p>'Why on earth should you think about them?' demanded Yenford, a little
  astonished.</p>

  <p>She started at this and changed the subject.</p>

  <p>It was past midnight when she reached her beautiful flat in Piccadilly,
  and all the staff except her maid had gone to bed. At the sound of a key
  turning in the lock the maid came flying into the hall, and with a sinking of
  heart Irene Belvinne knew that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>'She's been waiting since nine, m'lady,' said the girl in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Irene nodded.</p>

  <p>'Where is she?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'I put her in the study, madam.'</p>

  <p>Handing her coat to the maid, the woman walked up the broad passage,
  opened a door and entered the library. The woman who had been sitting on the
  hide-covered settee rose awkwardly at the sight of the radiant woman who
  entered. The visitor was poorly dressed, had a long, not too clean face, and
  a mouth that drooped pathetically. She looked up slyly from under her lowered
  lids, and though her tone was humble it also held a suggestion of menace.</p>

  <p>'He's terribly bad again tonight, m'lady,' she said. 'We had all our work
  cut out to keep him in bed. He wanted to come here, he said, him being
  delirious. The doctor says that we ought to get him away to&mdash;' her eyes
  rose quickly and fell again '&mdash;South Africa.'</p>

  <p>'It was Canada last time,' said Irene steadily. 'That was rather an
  expensive trip, Mrs. Dennis.'</p>

  <p>The woman mumbled something, rubbing her hands still more nervously.</p>

  <p>'I'm sure I'm worried to death about the whole business, me being his
  aunt, and I'm sure I can't afford no five thousand pounds to take him to
  South Africa&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Five thousand pounds! Irene was aghast at the demand. The Canadian trip
  had cost three thousand, but the original request was for one.</p>

  <p>'I should like to see him myself,' she said with sudden determination.</p>

  <p>Again that swift, sly look.</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't let you come and see him, me lady, unless you brought a
  gentleman. I'd say your 'usband, but I know he's no more. I wouldn't take the
  responsibility, I wouldn't indeed. That's why I never tell you where we're
  living, in case you was tempted, me lady. He'd think no more of cutting your
  throat than he would of looking at you!'</p>

  <p>A smile of contempt hardened the beautiful face.</p>

  <p>'I am not so sure that really terrifies me,' said Irene quietly. 'You want
  five thousand pounds&mdash;when do you sail?'</p>

  <p>'Next Saturday, me lady,' said the woman eagerly. 'And Jim say you was to
  pay the money in notes.'</p>

  <p>Irene nodded.</p>

  <p>'Very well,' she said. 'But you mustn't come here again unless I send for
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Where shall I get the money, me lady?'</p>

  <p>'Here at twelve o'clock tomorrow. And won't you please make yourself a
  little more presentable when you call?'</p>

  <p>The woman grinned.</p>

  <p>'I ain't got your looks or your clothes, me lady,' she sneered. 'Every
  penny piece I earn goes on poor Jim, a-trying to save his life, when if he
  had his rights he'd have millions.'</p>

  <p>Irene walked to the door and opened it, waited in the passage until the
  maid had shut out the unprepossessing visitor.</p>

  <p>'Open the windows and air the room,' said Irene.</p>

  <p>She went upstairs and sat down before her dressing table, eyeing her
  reflection thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>Then, of a sudden, she got up and crossed the room to the telephone. She
  lifted the receiver and then realized that she did not know the number. A
  search of the book gave her the information she wanted. The Triangle
  Detective Agency had their headquarters in Curzon Street. But they would be
  in bed by now, she thought; and even if the members of this extraordinary
  confederation were not, would they be likely to interest themselves at this
  late hour?</p>

  <p>She had hardly given the number before she was through. She heard the
  rattle of the receiver as it was raised, and the distinctive tinkle of a
  guitar; then an eager voice asked her who she was.</p>

  <p>'Lady Irene Belvinne,' she said. 'You don't know me, but&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I know you very well. Lady Irene.' She could almost detect the unknown
  smiling as he answered. 'You dined at Colonel Yenford's tonight and left the
  house at twelve minutes to twelve. You told your chauffeur to go back by way
  of Hyde Park...'</p>

  <p>The guitar had ceased. She heard a distant voice say: 'Listen to Leon:
  he's being all Sherlock Holmes.' And then a laugh. She smiled in
  sympathy.</p>

  <p>'Do you want to see me?' This was Leon Gonsalez speaking, then.</p>

  <p>'When can I?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Now. I'll come right away, if you're in any serious trouble&mdash;I have
  an idea that you are.'</p>

  <p>She hesitated. An immediate decision was called for and she set her
  teeth.</p>

  <p>'Very well. Will you come? I'll wait up for you.'</p>

  <p>In her nervousness she dropped the receiver down while he was answering
  her.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later the maid admitted a slim, good-looking man. He wore a
  dark suit, and was strangely like a Chancery barrister she knew. On her part
  the greeting was awkward, for the interval had been too short for her to make
  up her mind what she should tell him, and how she should begin.</p>

  <p>It was in the library tainted, to her sensitive nostrils, with her late
  frowsy visitor, that she made her confession, and he listened with an
  expressionless face.</p>

  <p>'... I was very young&mdash;that is my only excuse; and he was a very
  handsome, very attractive young man... and a chauffeur isn't a servant... I
  mean, one can be quite good friends with him, as one couldn't be
  with&mdash;well, with other servants.'</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>'It was an act of lunacy, and nasty, and everything you can say. When my
  father sent him away I thought my heart would break.'</p>

  <p>'Your father knew?' asked Gonsalez gravely.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>'No. Father was rather quick-tempered, and he bullied Jim for some fault
  that was not his&mdash;that was the end of it. I had one letter and then I
  heard no more until two or three years after I was married, when I got a
  letter from this woman, saying that her nephew was consumptive and she knew
  what&mdash;good friends we'd been.'</p>

  <p>To her surprise her visitor was smiling, and at first she was hurt.</p>

  <p>'You have told me only what I've guessed,' he said to her amazement.</p>

  <p>'You guessed... but you didn't know&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He interrupted her brusquely.</p>

  <p>'Was your second marriage happy, Lady Irene? I am not being
  impertinent.'</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>'It was quite happy. My husband was nearly thirty years older than
  I&mdash;why do you ask?'</p>

  <p>Leon smiled again.</p>

  <p>'I am a sentimentalist&mdash;which is a shocking confession for one who
  boasts of his scientific mind. I am a devourer of love stories, both in
  fiction and in life. This Jim was not unpleasant?'</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>'No,' she said, and then added simply: 'I loved him&mdash;I love him
  still. That is the ghastly part of it. It is dreadful to think of him lying
  ill with this dreadful aunt looking after him&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Landlady,' broke in Leon calmly. 'He had no relations.'</p>

  <p>She was on her feet now, staring at him.</p>

  <p>'What do you know?'</p>

  <p>He had a gesture which was almost mesmeric in its calming effect.</p>

  <p>'I went to Colonel Yenford's house tonight&mdash;I happened to learn that
  you were his guest and I wanted to see your mouth. I'm sorry if I am being
  mysterious, but I judge women by their mouths&mdash;the test is infallible.
  That is why I knew the hour you left.'</p>

  <p>Irene Belvinne was frowning at him.</p>

  <p>'I don't understand, Mr. Gonsalez,' she began. 'What has my mouth to do
  with the matter?'</p>

  <p>He nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>'If you had a certain type of mouth I should not have been
  interested&mdash;as it is... '</p>

  <p>She waited, and presently he spoke.</p>

  <p>'You will find James Ambrose Clynes in his suite at the Piccadilly Hotel.
  The dress ring you gave him is on his little finger, and your photograph is
  the only one in his room.'</p>

  <p>He put out his hand and steadied her as, white and shaking, she sank into
  a chair.</p>

  <p>'He's a very rich man and a very nice man... and a very stupid man, or he
  would have come to see you.'</p>

  <p>A car drew up before an ornate villa in the village of Langley and a
  poorly-dressed woman got down. The door was opened by a thickset man and the
  two passed into the over-furnished parlour. On the face of Mrs. Dennis was a
  smile of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>'It's all right&mdash;she'll part,' she said, throwing off her old
  coat.</p>

  <p>The coarse-looking man with the diamond ring turned to his other
  sister.</p>

  <p>'As soon as we get the money it's Canada for us,' he said ominously. 'I
  won't have another fright like I had on Tuesday&mdash;why were you so late,
  Maria?'</p>

  <p>'A tyre burst on the Great West Road,' she said, rubbing her hands at the
  fire. 'What are you worrying about, Saul? We've done nothing. It ain't as
  though we ever threatened her. That'd be crime. Just askin' her to help a
  poor feller who's ill, that ain't crime.'</p>

  <p>They discussed the pros and cons of this for nearly an hour. Then came the
  knock at the door.</p>

  <p>It was the man who went out to interview the visitor...</p>

  <p>'If I don't come in,' said Leon Gonsalez pleasantly, 'the police will.
  There will be a warrant issued tomorrow morning and you will be held on a
  charge of conspiring to defraud.'</p>

  <p>A few seconds later he was questioning a trembling audience...</p>

  <p>Poiccart and George Manfred were waiting up for him when he returned in
  the early hours of the morning.</p>

  <p>'Rather a unique case,' said Leon, glancing through his notes. 'Our
  Ambrose, a well-educated man, had a love affair with the Earl of Carslake's
  daughter. He loses his job&mdash;because he loves the girl he decides not to
  communicate with her. He goes into the Army and, before he is sent overseas,
  he writes to his landlady, asks her to take out a sealed envelope, full of
  letters from Irene and burn them. By the time she gets these instructions,
  Ambrose is reported killed. The landlady, Mrs. Dennis, with the
  inquisitiveness of her class, opens the envelope and learns enough to be able
  to blackmail this unfortunate girl. But Ambrose isn't dead&mdash;he is
  discharged from the army on account of wounds and, accepting the invitation
  of a South African soldier, goes to the Cape, where he makes good.</p>

  <p>'In the meantime the Dennises wax rich. They pretend that "Jim", as they
  called him, is desperately ill, trusting that Irene has not heard of his
  death. By this means, and on the threat of telling her husband, they extract
  nearly twenty thousand pounds.'</p>

  <p>'What shall we do to them?' asked Poiccart.</p>

  <p>Leon took something from his pocket&mdash;a glittering diamond ring. 'I
  took this as payment for my advice,' he said.</p>

  <p>George smiled.</p>

  <p>'And your advice, Leon?'</p>

  <p>'Was to get out of the country before Ambrose found them,' said Leon.</p>

  <p class="first">THE killing of Bernard Slane was one of those mysteries
  which delight the Press and worry the police. Mr. Slane was a rich
  stockbroker, a bachelor and a good fellow. He had dined at a Pall Mall club
  and, his car being in the garage for repairs, he took a taxi and ordered the
  driver to take him to his flat in Albert Palace Mansions. The porter of the
  mansions had taken the elevator to the fifth floor at the time Mr. Slane
  arrived.</p>

  <p>The first intimation that there was anything wrong was when the porter
  came down to find the taxi-driver standing in the hall, and asked him what he
  wanted.</p>

  <p>'I've just brought a gentleman here&mdash;Mr. Slane, who lives at Number
  Seven,' said the driver. 'He hadn't got any change so he's gone in to get
  it.'</p>

  <p>This was quite likely, because Slane lived on the first floor and
  invariably used the stairs. They chatted together, the porter and the driver,
  for some five minutes, and then the porter undertook to go up and collect the
  money for the fare.</p>

  <p>Albert Palace Mansions differed from every other apartment-house of its
  kind in that, on the first and the most expensive floor, there was one small
  flat consisting of four rooms, which was occupied by Slane.</p>

  <p>A light showed through the transom, but then it had been burning all the
  evening. The porter rang the bell and waited, rang it again,
  knocked&mdash;without, however, getting an answer. He returned to the
  driver.</p>

  <p>'He must have gone to sleep&mdash;how was he?' he asked.</p>

  <p>By his question he meant to inquire whether the stockbroker was quite
  sober. It is a fact that Slane drank rather heavily, and had come home more
  than once in a condition which necessitated the help of the night porter to
  get him to bed.</p>

  <p>The driver, whose name was Reynolds, admitted his passenger had had as
  much as, and probably more than, was good for him. Again the porter attempted
  to get a reply from the flat and, when this failed, he paid the driver out of
  his own pocket, four shillings and sixpence.</p>

  <p>The porter was on duty all night, and made several journeys up and down
  his shaft. Through the open grille on the first floor he commanded a view of
  No 7. His statement was that he saw nothing of Mr. Slane that night, that it
  was impossible for the stockbroker to have left the building without his
  seeing him.</p>

  <p>At half past five the next morning a policeman patrolling Green Park saw a
  man sitting huddled up on a garden chair. He wore a dinner jacket and, his
  attitude was so suspicious that the policeman stepped over the rails and
  crossed the stretch of grass which intervened between the pathway and the
  chair which was placed near a clump of rhododendrons. He came up to the man,
  to find his fears justified. The man was dead; he had been terribly battered
  with some blunt instrument, and a search of the pockets revealed his identity
  as Bernard Slane.</p>

  <p>Near the spot was an iron gateway set in the rails leading to the Mall,
  and the lock of this was discovered to be smashed. Detectives from Scotland
  Yard were at once on the spot; the porter of Albert Palace Mansions was
  questioned; and a call was sent round, asking the driver Reynolds to call at
  the Yard. He was there by twelve o'clock, but could throw no light on the
  mystery.</p>

  <p>Reynolds was a respectable man without any record against him, and was a
  widower who lived over a garage near Dorset Square, Baker Street.</p>

  <p>'A most amusing crime,' said Leon Gonsalez, his elbows on the breakfast
  table, his head between his hands.</p>

  <p>'Why amusing?' asked George.</p>

  <p>Leon read on, his lips moving, a trick of his, as he devoured every
  printed line. After a while he leaned back in his chair and rubbed his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>'It is amusing,' he said, 'because of the hotel bill that was found in the
  dead man's pocket.'</p>

  <p>He put his finger on a paragraph and Manfred drew the paper towards him
  and read:</p>

  <p>'The police discovered in the right hand pocket of the murdered man's
  overcoat a bloodstained paper which proved to be an hotel bill, issued by the
  Plage Hotel, Ostend, five years ago. The bill was made out in the name of Mr.
  and Mrs. Wilbraham and was for 7,500 francs.'</p>

  <p>Manfred pushed the paper back.</p>

  <p>'Isn't the mystery why this half-drunken man left his flat and went back
  to Green Park, some considerable distance from Albert Palace Mansions?' he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Leon, who was staring blankly at the farther wall, shook his head slowly;
  and then, in his characteristic way, went off at a tangent:</p>

  <p>'There's a lot to be said for the law which prohibited the publication of
  certain details in divorce cases,' he said, 'but I believe that the
  circumstances which surrounded the visit of Mr. and Mrs. Wilbraham to the
  Plage would have been given the fullest publicity if the case had come into
  court.'</p>

  <p>'Do you suspect a murder of revenge?' Leon shrugged his shoulders and
  changed the subject. George Manfred used to say that Leon had the most
  amazing pigeon-hole of a mind that it had been his fortune to meet with. Very
  seldom indeed did he have to consult the voluminous notes and data he had
  collected during his life, and which made one room in that little house
  uninhabitable.</p>

  <p>There was a man at Scotland Yard, Inspector Meadows, who was on the
  friendliest terms with the Three. It was his practice to smoke a pipe, indeed
  many pipes, of evenings in the little Curzon Street house. He came that
  night, rather full of the Slane mystery.</p>

  <p>'Slane was a pretty rapid sort,' he said. 'From the evidence that was
  found in his house, it is clear that he was the one man in London who ought
  not to be a bachelor if about two dozen women had their rights! By the way,
  we've traced Mr. and Mrs. Wilbraham. Wilbraham was of course Slane. The lady
  isn't so easy to find; one of his pick-ups, I suppose&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And yet the only girl he was willing to marry,' said Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>'How did you know that?' asked the startled detective.</p>

  <p>Leon chuckled.</p>

  <p>'The bill was obviously sent to give the husband evidence. The husband,
  either because he was willing to give his wife another chance or because he
  was a Roman Catholic, did not divorce her. Now tell me'&mdash;he leaned
  forward over the table and beamed on the detective&mdash;'when the taxi drew
  up before the door of Albert Palace Mansions, did Slane immediately
  alight?&mdash;I can tell you he didn't.'</p>

  <p>'You've been making inquiries,' said the other suspiciously. 'No, he
  waited there. The driver, being a tactful individual, thought it best to keep
  him inside until the people who were in the hall had gone up in the
  lift&mdash;which is visible from the door.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. Was it the driver's idea or Slane's'?</p>

  <p>'The driver's,' said Meadows. 'Slane was half asleep when the man pulled
  him out.'</p>

  <p>'One more question: when the elevator man took this party to the fifth
  floor, did he come down immediately?'</p>

  <p>The Inspector shook his head.</p>

  <p>'No, he stayed up there talking to the tenants. He heard Slane's door
  slam, and that was the first intimation he had that somebody had come
  in.'</p>

  <p>Leon jerked back into his chair, a delighted smile on his face.</p>

  <p>'What do you think, Raymond?' He addressed the saturnine Poiccart.</p>

  <p>'What do you think?' said the other.</p>

  <p>Meadows looked from Poiccart to Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>'Have you any theory as to why Slane went out again?'</p>

  <p>'He didn't go out again,' said the two men in unison.</p>

  <p>Meadows caught George Manfred's smiling eyes.</p>

  <p>'They're trying to mystify you. Meadows, but what they say is true.
  Obviously he didn't go out again.'</p>

  <p>He rose and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>'I'm going to bed; and I'd like to bet you fifty pounds that Leon finds
  the murderer tomorrow, though I won't swear that he will hand him over to
  Scotland Yard.'</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock next morning, when, with a cigarette in his mouth,
  Reynolds, the taxi-driver, was making a final inspection of his cab before
  taking it out for the day, Leon Gonsalez walked into the mews.</p>

  <p>Reynolds was a man of forty, a quiet, good-looking fellow. He had a soft
  voice and was courteous in a particularly pleasing way.</p>

  <p>'You're not another detective, are you?' he asked, smiling ruefully. 'I've
  answered as many foolish questions as I care to answer.'</p>

  <p>'Is this your own cab?' Leon nodded to the shining vehicle.</p>

  <p>'Yes, that's mine,' said the driver. 'Cab-owning is not the gold mine some
  people think it is. And if you happen to get mixed up in a case like this,
  your takings fall fifty per cent.'</p>

  <p>Very briefly Leon explained his position.</p>

  <p>'The Triangle Agency&mdash;oh, yes, I remember: you're the Four Just Men,
  aren't you? Good Lord! Scotland Yard haven't put you on the job?'</p>

  <p>'I'm on the job for my own amusement,' said Leon, giving smile for smile.
  'There are one or two matters which weren't quite clear to me, and I wondered
  if you would mind telling me something that the police don't seem to
  know.'</p>

  <p>The man hesitated, and then: 'Come up to my room,' he said, and led the
  way up the narrow stairs.</p>

  <p>The room was surprisingly well furnished. There were one or two old
  pieces, Leon noticed, which must have been worth a lot of money. On a
  gate-legged table in the centre of the room was a suitcase and near the table
  a trunk. The driver must have noticed his eyes rest on these, for he said
  quickly: 'They belong to a customer of mine. I'm taking them to the
  station.'</p>

  <p>From where he stood, Leon could see they were addressed to the Tetley
  cloak room to be called for; he made no comment on this, but his observation
  evidently disconcerted his host for his manner changed.</p>

  <p>'Now, Mr. Gonsalez, I'm a working man, so I'm afraid I can't give you very
  much time. What is it you want to know?'</p>

  <p>'I particularly wish to know,' said Leon, 'whether the day you brought
  Slane to his house had been a very busy one for you?'</p>

  <p>'It was fairly profitable,' said the other. 'I've already given the police
  an account of my fares, including the hospital case&mdash;but I suppose you
  know that.'</p>

  <p>'Which hospital case was this?'</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>'I don't want you to think I'm boasting about doing a thing like
  that&mdash;it was just humanity. A woman was knocked down by a bus in Baker
  Street: I picked her up and took her to the hospital.'</p>

  <p>'Was she badly hurt?'</p>

  <p>'She died.' His voice was curt.</p>

  <p>Leon looked at him thoughtfully. Again his eyes roved to the trunk.</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' he said. 'Will you come to Curzon Street tonight at nine
  o'clock? Here's my address.' He took a card from his pocket.</p>

  <p>'Why?' There was a note of defiance in the voice.</p>

  <p>'Because I want to ask you something that I think you'll be glad to
  answer,' said Leon.</p>

  <p>His big car was waiting at the end of the mews, and he set it flying in
  the direction of the Walmer Street hospital. He learnt there no more than he
  expected, and returned to Curzon Street, a very silent and uninformative
  man.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock that night came Reynolds, and for an hour he and Leon
  Gonsalez were closeted together in the little room downstairs. Happily,
  Meadows did not consider it necessary to call. It was not until a week
  afterwards that he came with a piece of information that surprised only
  himself.</p>

  <p>'It was rather a rum thing&mdash;that driver who took Slane back to his
  flat has disappeared&mdash;sold his taxi and cleared out. There's nothing to
  associate him with the murder or I should get a warrant for him. He has been
  straightforward from the very first.'</p>

  <p>Manfred politely agreed. Poiccart was staringly vacant. Leon Gonsalez
  yawned and was frankly bored with all mysteries.</p>

  <p>'It's very curious,' said Gonsalez, when he condescended to tell the full
  story, 'that the police never troubled to investigate Slane's life at Tetley.
  He had a big house there for some years. If they had, they couldn't have
  failed to hear the story of young Doctor Grain and his beautiful wife, who
  ran away from him. She and Slane disappeared together; and of course he was
  passionately fond of her and was ready to marry her. But then, Slane was the
  type who was passionately fond of people for about three months, and unless
  the marriage could be arranged instantly the unfortunate girl had very little
  chance of becoming his wife.</p>

  <p>'The doctor offered to take his wife back, but she refused, and
  disappeared out of his life. He gave up the practice of medicine, came to
  London, invested his savings in a small garage, went broke, as all garage
  proprietors do unless they're backed with good capital, and having to decide
  whether he'd go back to the practice of medicine and pick up all that he'd
  lost in the years he'd been trying to forget his wife, he chose what to him
  was the less strenuous profession of cab-driver. I know another man who did
  exactly the same thing: I will tell you about him one of these days.</p>

  <p>'He never saw his wife again, though he frequently saw Slane. Reynolds, or
  Grain, as I will call him, had shaved off his moustache and generally altered
  his appearance, and Slane never recognized him. It became an obsession of
  Grain's to follow his enemy about, to learn of his movements, his habits. The
  one habit he did discover, and which proved to be Slane's undoing, was his
  practice of dining at the Real Club in Pall Mall every Wednesday evening and
  of leaving the club at eleven-thirty on those occasions.</p>

  <p>'He put his discovery to no use, nor did he expect he would, until the
  night of the murder. He was driving somewhere in the north-west district when
  he saw a woman knocked down by a bus and he himself nearly ran over the
  prostrate figure. Stopping his cab, he jumped down and, to his horror, as he
  picked her up, he found himself gazing into the emaciated face of his wife.
  He lifted her into the cab, drove full pelt to the nearest hospital. It was
  while they were in the waiting-room, before the house surgeon's arrival, that
  the dying woman told him, in a few broken, half-delirious words, the story of
  her downward progress... She was dead before they got her on to the operating
  table&mdash;mercifully, as it proved.</p>

  <p>'I knew all this before I went to the hospital and found that some unknown
  person had decided that she should be buried at Tetley and had made the most
  lavish arrangements for her removal. I guessed it before I saw Grain's
  suitcase packed ready for that tragedy. He left the hospital, a man mad with
  hate. It was raining heavily. He crawled down Pall Mall, and luck was with
  him, for just as the porter came out to find an empty taxi, Grain pulled up
  before the door.</p>

  <p>'On the pretext of a tyre burst he stopped in the Mall, forced open one of
  the gates that led to the park, and waited until no pedestrian was in sight
  before he dragged the half-drunken man into the gardens... He was sober
  enough before Grain finished his story. Grain swears that he gave him the
  chance of his life, but Slane pulled a gun on him, and he had to kill him in
  self-defence. That may or may not be true.</p>

  <p>'He never lost his nerve. Reaching his cab without observation, he drove
  to Albert Palace Mansions, waited until the lift had risen, and then ran up
  the stairs. He had taken Slane's bunch of keys, and on the way had selected
  that which he knew would open the door. His first intention was to search the
  flat for everything that betrayed the man's association with his wife; but he
  heard the porter up above saying good night and, slamming the door, raced
  downstairs in time to be there when the man reached the ground floor.'</p>

  <p>'We're not telling the police of this, of course?' said Manfred
  gravely.</p>

  <p>Poiccart at the other end of the table burst into a loud guffaw.</p>

  <p>'It's so good a story that the police would never believe it,' he
  said.</p>

     id="story06">VI .&mdash; THE MARKED CHEQUE</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">THE man who called at the little house in Curzon Street was
  in a rage, and anxious to say something that would hurt his late
  employer.</p>

  <p>He had also a personal grievance against Mr. Jens, the butler.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Storn took me on as a second footman, and it looked like being a good
  job, but I couldn't hit it off with the rest of the staff. But was it fair to
  chuck me out without a minute's warning because I happened to let drop a word
  in Arabic&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'Arabic?' asked Leon Gonsalez in surprise. 'Do you speak Arabic?'</p>

  <p>Tenley, the dismissed footman, grinned.</p>

  <p>'About a dozen words: I was with the Army in Egypt after the war, and I
  picked up a few phrases. I was polishing the silver salver in the hall, and I
  happened to say "That's good" in Arabic; and I heard Mr. Storn's voice behind
  me.</p>

  <p>'"You clear out," he said, and before I knew what had happened, I was
  walking away from the house with a month's salary.'</p>

  <p>Gonsalez nodded.</p>

  <p>'Very interesting,' he said, 'but why have you come to us?'</p>

  <p>He had asked the same question many times of inconsequential people who
  had come to the House of the Silver Triangle, with their trifling
  grievances.</p>

  <p>'Because there's a mystery there,' said the man vaguely. Perhaps he had
  cooled down a little by now, and was feeling rather uncomfortable. 'Why was I
  fired for my Arabic? What's the meaning of the picture in Storn's private
  room&mdash;the men being hung?'</p>

  <p>Leon sat upright. 'Men being hanged? What is that?'</p>

  <p>'It's a photograph. You can't get it, because it's in the panelling and
  you have to open one of the panels. But I went in one day and he'd left the
  panel ajar... Three men hanging from a sort of gibbet an' a lot of Turks
  looking on. That's a funny thing for a gentleman to have in his house.'</p>

  <p>Leon was silent for a while.</p>

  <p>'I don't know that that is an offence. It is certainly odd. Is there
  anything I can do for you?'</p>

  <p>Apparently nothing. The man left a little sheepishly, and Leon carried the
  news to his partner. He remembered afterwards that he had heard nothing of
  the grievance against the butler.</p>

  <p>'The only thing I learnt about Storn is that he is extraordinarily mean,
  that he runs his house in Park Lane with a minimum number of staff, that he
  pays those the smallest wages possible. He is of Armenian origin and made his
  money out of oilfields which he acquired by very dubious means.</p>

  <p>'As to the three hanged men, that is rather gruesome, but it might be
  worse. I have seen photographs in the house of the idle rich that would make
  your hair stand on end, my dear Poiccart. At any rate, the morbid interest of
  a millionaire in a Turkish execution is not extraordinary.'</p>

  <p>'If I were an Armenian,' said Manfred, 'they would be my chief hobby; I
  should have a whole gallery of 'em!'</p>

  <p>And there ended the matter of the morbid millionaire who lived meanly and
  underpaid his servants.</p>

  <p>Early in April, Leon read in the newspaper that Mr. Storn had gone to
  Egypt for a short holiday.</p>

  <p>By every test, Ferdinand Storn was a desirable acquaintance. He was
  immensely rich; he was personally attractive in a dark, long-nosed way; and
  to such people as met him intimately&mdash;and they were few&mdash;he could
  talk Art and Finance with equal facility. So far as was known, he had no
  enemies. He lived at Burson House, Park Lane, a small, handsome residence
  which he had purchased from the owner, Lord Burson, for £150,000. He spent
  most of his time either there or at Felfry Park, his beautiful country house
  in Sussex. The Persian and Oriental Oil Trust, of which he was the head, had
  its offices in a magnificent building in Moorgate Street, and here he was
  usually to be found between ten o'clock in the morning and three o'clock in
  the afternoon.</p>

  <p>This Trust, despite its titled board, was a one-man affair, and conducted,
  amongst other things, the business of bankers. Storn held most of the shares,
  and was popularly supposed to derive an income of something like a quarter of
  a million a year. He had few personal friends, and was a bachelor.</p>

  <p>It was just short of a month after Leon had read the news that a big car
  drew up at the door of the Triangle, and a stout, prosperous-looking man got
  out and rang the bell. He was a stranger to Leon, who interviewed him, and
  was apparently loth to state his business, for he hummed and hawed and
  questioned until Leon, a little impatiently, asked him point-blank who he was
  and what was his object.</p>

  <p>'Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Gonsalez,' said the stout man. 'I am the General
  Manager of the Persian and Oriental Oil&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Storn's company?' asked Leon, his interest awakened.</p>

  <p>'Storn's company. I suppose I really ought to go to the police with my
  suspicions, but a friend of mine has such faith in you and what he calls the
  Three Just Men, that I thought I had better see you first.'</p>

  <p>'Is it about Mr. Storn?' asked Leon.</p>

  <p>The gentleman, who proved to be Mr. Hubert Grey, the Managing Director of
  the Trust, nodded.</p>

  <p>'You see, Mr. Gonsalez, I am in rather a peculiar position. Mr. Storn is a
  very difficult man, and I should lose my job if I made him look
  ridiculous.'</p>

  <p>'He's abroad, isn't he?' asked Leon.</p>

  <p>'He's abroad,' agreed the other soberly. 'He went abroad, as a matter of
  fact, quite unexpectedly; that is to say, it was unexpected by the office. In
  fact he had an important Board meeting the day he left, which he should have
  attended, but on that morning I got a letter from him saying that he had to
  go to Egypt on a matter which affected his personal honour. He asked me not
  to communicate with him, or even to announce the fact that he had left
  London. Unfortunately, one of my clerks very foolishly told a reporter who
  had called that day that Mr. Storn had left,</p>

  <p>'A week after he had gone, he sent us a letter from an hotel in Rome,
  enclosing a cheque for eighty-three thousand pounds, and arranging that this
  cheque should be honoured when a gentleman called, which he did the next
  day.'</p>

  <p>'An Englishman?' asked Leon.</p>

  <p>Mr. Grey shook his head. 'No, he was a foreigner of some kind; a rather
  dark-looking man. The money was paid over to him.</p>

  <p>'A few days later we had another letter from Mr. Storn, written from the
  Hotel de Russie, Rome. This letter told us that a further cheque had been
  sent to Mr. Kraman, which was to be honoured. This was for one hundred and
  seven thousand pounds and a few odd shillings. He gave us instructions as to
  how the money was to be paid, and asked us to telegraph to him at an hotel in
  Alexandria the moment the cheque was honoured. This I did. The very next day
  there came a second letter written from the Hotel Mediterraneo in
  Naples&mdash;I will let you have copies of all these&mdash;telling us that a
  third cheque was to be paid without fail, but to a different man, a Mr.
  Rezzio, who would call at the office. This was for one hundred and twelve
  thousand pounds, which very nearly exhausted Mr. Storn's cash balance,
  although of course he has large reserves at the bank. I might say that Mr.
  Storn is a man who is rather eccentric in the matter of large deposit
  reserves. Very little of his money is locked up in shares. Look
  here'&mdash;he took a note-case from his pocket and produced a cheque
  form&mdash;'this money has been paid, but I've brought you along the cheque
  to see.'</p>

  <p>Leon took it in his hand. It was written in characteristic writing, and he
  examined the signature.</p>

  <p>'There is no question of this being a forgery?'</p>

  <p>'None whatever,' said Grey emphatically. 'The letter, too, was in his own
  handwriting. But what puzzled me about the cheque were the queer marks on the
  back.'</p>

  <p>They were indistinguishable to Leon until he took them to the window, and
  then saw a line of faint pencil marks which ran along the bottom of the
  cheque.</p>

  <p>'I suppose I can't keep this cheque for a day or two?' asked Leon.</p>

  <p>'Certainly. The signature, as you see, has been cancelled out, and the
  money has been paid.'</p>

  <p>Leon examined the cheque again. It was drawn on the Ottoman Oil Bank,
  which was apparently a private concern of Storn's.</p>

  <p>'What do you imagine has happened?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'I don't know, but I'm worried.'</p>

  <p>Grey's troubled frown showed the extent of that worry.</p>

  <p>'I don't know why I should be, but I've got an uncomfortable feeling at
  the back of my mind that there is a swindle somewhere.'</p>

  <p>'Have you cabled to Alexandria?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Grey smiled. 'Naturally; and I have had a reply. It struck me that you
  might have agents in Egypt, in which case it might be a simple matter for you
  to discover whether there is anything wrong. The main point is that I don't
  wish Mr. Storn to know that I've been making inquiries. I'll pay any
  reasonable expenditure you incur, and I'm quite sure that Mr. Storn will
  agree that I have done the right thing.'</p>

  <p>After the departure of his visitor, Leon interviewed Manfred.</p>

  <p>'It may, of course, be a case of blackmail,' said George softly. 'But you
  will have to start at Storn's beginnings if you want to get under whatever
  mystery there is.'</p>

  <p>'So I think,' said Gonsalez; and a few minutes afterwards went out of the
  house.</p>

  <p>He did not return till midnight. He brought back an amazing amount of
  information about Mr. Storn.</p>

  <p>'About twelve years ago he was an operator in the service of the Turco
  Telegraph Company. He speaks eight Oriental languages, and was well-known in
  Istanbul. Does that tell you anything, George?'</p>

  <p>Manfred shook his head.</p>

  <p>'It tells me nothing yet, but I am waiting to be thrilled.'</p>

  <p>'He was mixed up with the revolutionary crowd, the under-strappers who
  pulled the strings in the days of Abdul Ahmid, and there is no doubt that he
  got his Concession through these fellows.'</p>

  <p>'What Concession?' asked Manfred.</p>

  <p>'Oil land, large tracts of it. When the new Government came into power,
  the Concession was formed, though I suspect our friend paid heavily for the
  privilege. His five partners, however, were less fortunate. Three of them
  were accused of treason against the Government, and were hanged.'</p>

  <p>'The photograph,' nodded Manfred. 'What happened to the other two?'</p>

  <p>'The other two were Italians, and they were sent to prison in Asia Minor
  for the rest of their lives. When Storn came to London, it was as sole
  proprietor of the Concession, which he floated with a profit of three million
  pounds.'</p>

  <p>The next morning Leon left the house early, and at ten o'clock was ringing
  the bell at Burson House.</p>

  <p>The heavy-jowled butler who opened the door regarded him with suspicion,
  but was otherwise deferential.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Storn is abroad, and won't be back for some weeks, sir.'</p>

  <p>'May I see Mr. Storn's secretary?' asked Leon in his blandest manner.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Storn never has a secretary at his house; you will find the young
  lady at the offices of the Persian Oil Trust.'</p>

  <p>Leon felt in his pocket and produced a card.</p>

  <p>'I am one of the Bursons,' he said, 'and as a matter of fact my father was
  born here. Some months ago when I was in London I asked Mr. Storn if he would
  give me permission to look over the house.'</p>

  <p>The card contained a scribbled line, signed 'Ferdinand Storn,' giving
  permission to the bearer to see the house at any hour 'when I am out of
  town.' It had taken Leon the greater part of an hour to forge that
  permit.</p>

  <p>'I am afraid I cannot let you in, sir,' said the butler, barring the
  passage. 'Mr. Storn told me before he went that I was to admit no
  strangers.'</p>

  <p>'What is today?' asked Leon suddenly.</p>

  <p>'Thursday, sir,' said the man.</p>

  <p>Leon nodded. 'Cheese day,' he said.</p>

  <p>Only for the fraction of a second was the man confused.</p>

  <p>'I don't know what you mean, sir,' he said gruffly, and almost shut the
  door in the face of the caller.</p>

  <p>Gonsalez made a circuit of the house. It stood with another upon an island
  site.</p>

  <p>When he had finished, he went home, an amused and almost excited man, to
  give instructions to Raymond Poiccart who, amongst his other qualifications,
  had a very wide circle of criminal friends. There was not a big gangster in
  London that he did not know. He was acquainted with the public house in
  London where the confidence men and the safe smashers met: he could at any
  moment gather the gossip of the prisons, and was probably better acquainted
  with the secret news of the underworld than any man at Scotland Yard. Him
  Leon sent on a news-gathering mission, and in a small public house off
  Lambeth Walk, Poiccart learned of the dark philanthropist who had found
  employment for at least three ex-convicts.</p>

  <p>Leon was sitting alone when he returned, examining with a powerful lens
  the odd marks on the back of the cheque.</p>

  <p>Before Poiccart could retail his news, Leon reached for a telephone
  directory.</p>

  <p>'Grey, of course, has left his office, but unless I am mistaken this is
  his private address,' he said, as his fingers stopped on one of the pages. A
  maid answered his call. Yes, Mr. Grey was at home. Presently the Managing
  Director's voice came through.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Grey&mdash;who would handle the cheques which you have received from
  Storn; I mean who is the official?'</p>

  <p>'The accountant,' was the reply.</p>

  <p>'Who gave the accountant his job&mdash;you?'</p>

  <p>A pause.</p>

  <p>'No&mdash;Mr. Storn. He used to be in the Eastern Telegraph
  Company&mdash;Mr. Storn met him abroad.'</p>

  <p>'And where is the accountant to be found?' asked Leon eagerly.</p>

  <p>'He's on his holidays. He left before the last cheque came. But I can get
  him.'</p>

  <p>Leon's laugh was one of sheer delight.</p>

  <p>'You needn't worry&mdash;I knew he wasn't at the office,' he said, and
  hung up on the astonished manager.</p>

  <p>'Now, my dear Poiccart, what did you find?'</p>

  <p>He listened intently till his friend had finished, and then: 'Let us go to
  Park Lane&mdash;and bring a gun with you,' he said. 'We will call at Scotland
  Yard en route.'</p>

  <p>It was ten o'clock when the butler opened the door. Before he could frame
  a question, a big detective gripped him and pulled him into the street.</p>

  <p>The four plain-clothes officers who accompanied Leon flocked into the
  hall. A surly-faced footman was arrested before he could shout a warning. At
  the very top of the house, in a small windowless apartment that had once been
  used as a box-room, they found an emaciated man whom even his Managing
  Director, hastily summoned to the scene, failed to identify as the
  millionaire. The two Italians who kept guard on him and watched him through a
  hole broken through the wall from an adjoining room gave no trouble.</p>

  <p>One of them, he who had carefully planted Burson House full of ex-convict
  servants, was very explicit.</p>

  <p>'This man betrayed us, and we should have hanged like Hatim Effendi and Al
  Shiri and Maropulos the Greek, only we bribed witnesses,' he said. 'We were
  partners in the oilfields, and to rob us he manufactured evidence that we
  were conspiring against the Government. My friend and I broke prison and came
  back to London. I was determined he should pay us the money he owed us, and I
  knew that we could never get it from a Court of Law.'</p>

  <p>'It was a very simple matter, and I really am ashamed of myself that I did
  not understand those marks at the back of the cheque at first glance,'
  explained Leon over the supper-table that night. 'Our Italian friend was one
  of the crowd that got the Concession: he had lived for years in London, and
  possibly it will be proved that he had criminal associates. At any rate, he
  had no difficulty in collecting a houseful of servants, playing as he did on
  his knowledge of Storn's character. All these men offered to serve Storn for
  sums at which the average servant would have turned up his nose. It has taken
  the better part of a year to fill our friend's establishment with these
  ex-convicts. You remember that the footman who came to us a few months ago
  said that he had been employed, not by the butler but by Storn himself. They
  would have taken the first opportunity of getting rid of him, only
  inadvertently he used an Arabic expression, and Storn, who was suspicious of
  spies and probably expected the men whom he had betrayed to return, sent him
  packing.</p>

  <p>'On the day Storn was supposed to leave for Egypt, he was seized by the
  two Italians, locked up in a room and compelled to write such letters and
  sign such cheques as they dictated. But he remembered, rather late in the
  day, that the accountant was an old telegraphist, and so he put on the back
  of the cheque, in pencil marks, a Morse message in the old symbols which were
  employed when the needle machine was most commonly used.'</p>

  <p>He produced the cheque and laid it on the table, running his finger along
  the pencil mark:</p>

  <p>SOSPRSNRPRKLN</p>

  <p>'In other words, "Prisoner in Park Lane." The accountant was on his
  holiday, so he did not read the message.'</p>

  <p>Manfred took up the cheque, turned it and examined it.</p>

  <p>'What handsome fee will this millionaire send you?' he asked
  ironically.</p>

  <p>The answer did not come till a few days after the Old Bailey trial. It
  took the form of a cheque&mdash;for five guineas.</p>

  <p>'Game to the last!' murmured Leon admiringly.</p>

     id="story07">VII .&mdash; MR LEVINGROU'S DAUGHTER</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found<br>
  Reprinted in <i>The Scotland Yard Book of Edgar Wallace</i>, 1932</h3>

  <p class="first">MR LEVINGROU took his long cigar from his mouth and shook
  his head sorrowfully. He was a fat man, thick-necked and heavy-cheeked, and
  he could not afford to spoil a good cigar.</p>

  <p>'That is awful... that is brutal! Tch! It makes me seek... poor Jose!'</p>

  <p>His companion snorted in sympathy.</p>

  <p>For Jose Silva had fallen. An unemotional judge, who spoke rather
  precociously, had told Jose that certain crimes were very heinous in the eyes
  of the law. For example, women were held in special esteem, and to trade on
  their follies was regarded as being so dreadful that nothing but a very long
  term of imprisonment could vindicate the law's outraged majesty.</p>

  <p>And Jose had offended beyond forgiveness. He ran the Latin-American
  Artists Agency to give young and pretty aspirants to the stage a quick and
  profitable engagement on South American stages. They went away full of joy
  and they never came back. Letters came from them to their relations, very
  correctly worded, nicely spelt. They were, they said, happy. They all wrote
  the same in almost identical language. You might imagine that they wrote to
  dictation, as indeed they did.</p>

  <p>But the vice squad had got on Jose's tail. A pretty girl applied for a job
  and went to Buenos Aires, accompanied by her father and brother&mdash;they
  were both Scotland Yard men, and when they learnt all that they had to learn
  they came back with the girl, a rather shrewd detective herself, and Jose was
  arrested. And then they learnt more things about him, and the prison sentence
  was inevitable.</p>

  <p>Nobody arrested Jules Levingrou and haled him from his beautiful little
  bijou house in Knightsbridge and sent him to a cold bleak prison. And nobody
  arrested Heinrich Luss, who was his partner. They had financed Jose and many
  other Joses, but they were clever.</p>

  <p>'Jose was careless,' sighed Jules as he sucked at his cigar.</p>

  <p>Heinrich sighed, too. He was as fat as, but looked fatter than, his
  companion, because he was a shorter man.</p>

  <p>Jules looked round the pretty saloon with its cream and gold decorations,
  and presently his eyes stopped roving and fixed on a framed photograph that
  was on the mantelpiece. His big face creased in a smile as he rose with a
  grunt and, waddling across to the fireplace, took the frame in his hand. The
  picture was of an extremely pretty girl.</p>

  <p>'You see?'</p>

  <p>Heinrich took the picture and mumbled ecstatic praise.</p>

  <p>'Not goot enough,' he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Levingrou agreed. He had never yet seen a picture that quite did
  justice to the delicate beauty of this only daughter of his. He was a
  widower; his wife had died when Valerie was a baby. She would never know how
  many hearts were broken, how many souls destroyed, that she might be brought
  up in the luxury which surrounded her. This aspect of her upbringing never
  occurred to Mr. Levingrou. He prided himself that he had no sentiment.</p>

  <p>He was part proprietor of twenty-three cabarets and dance halls scattered
  up and down the Argentine and Brazil, and drew large profits from what he
  regarded as a perfectly legitimate business.</p>

  <p>He put down the photograph and came back to the deep arm-chair.</p>

  <p>'It is unfortunate about Jose; but these men come and go. This new man may
  or may not be good.'</p>

  <p>'What is his name?' asked Heinrich.</p>

  <p>Jules searched breathlessly in his pockets, found a letter and opened it,
  his thick fingers glittering in the light from the crystal chandelier, for he
  was a lover of rings.</p>

  <p>'Leon Gonsalez&mdash;herr Gott!'</p>

  <p>Heinrich was sitting upright in his chair, white as a sheet.</p>

  <p>'Name of a pipe! What is the matter with you, Heinrich?'</p>

  <p>'Leon Gonsalez!' repeated the other huskily. 'You think he is an applicant
  for the post... you do not know him?'</p>

  <p>Jules shook his huge head.</p>

  <p>'Why in God's name should I know him&mdash;he is a Spaniard, that is good
  enough for me. This is always the way, Heinrich. No sooner does one of our
  men make a fool of himself and get caught than another arises. Tomorrow I
  shall have twenty, thirty, fifty applicants&mdash;not to me but through the
  usual channel.'</p>

  <p>Heinrich was looking at him hollow-eyed, and now in his agitation he spoke
  in German&mdash;that brand of German which is heard more frequently in
  Poland.</p>

  <p>'Let me see the letter.' He took it in his hand and read it carefully.</p>

  <p>'He asks for an appointment, that is all.'</p>

  <p>'Have you ever heard of the Four Just Men?'</p>

  <p>Jules frowned.</p>

  <p>'They are dead, eh? I read something years ago.'</p>

  <p>'They are alive,' said the other grimly; 'pardoned by the English
  Government. They have a bureau in Curzon Street.'</p>

  <p>Rapidly he sketched the history of that strange organization which for
  years had terrorized the evil-doers who by their natural cunning had evaded
  the just processes of the law; and, as he spoke, the face of Jules Levingrou
  lengthened.</p>

  <p>'But that&mdash;is preposterous!' he spluttered at last. 'How could these
  men know of me and of you... Besides, they dare not.'</p>

  <p>Before Heinrich could reply there was a gentle knock at the door and a
  footman came in. There was a card on the salver he carried in his hand. Jules
  took it, adjusted his glasses and read, meditated a second, and then:</p>

  <p>'Show him up,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Leon Gonsalez,' almost whispered Heinrich as the door closed on the
  servant. 'Do you see a little silver triangle at the corner of the card? That
  is on the door of their house. It is he!'</p>

  <p>'Pshaw!' scoffed his companion. 'He has come&mdash;why? To offer his
  services. You shall see!'</p>

  <p>Leon Gonsalez, grey-haired and dapper, swung into the room, his keen,
  ascetic face tense, his fine eyes alive. A ready smiler was Leon. He was
  smiling now as he looked from one man to the other.</p>

  <p>'You!' he said, and pointed to Jules.</p>

  <p>Monsieur Levingrou started. There was almost an accusation in that finger
  thrust.</p>

  <p>'You wish to see me?' He tried to recover some of his lost dignity.</p>

  <p>'I did,' said Leon calmly. 'It is my misfortune that I have never seen you
  before. My friend Manfred, of whom you have heard, knows you very well by
  sight, and my very dear comrade Poiccart is so well acquainted with you that
  he could draw you feature by feature&mdash;and indeed did upon the
  table-cloth at dinner last night, much to the annoyance of our thrifty
  housekeeper!'</p>

  <p>Levingrou was on his guard; there was something of the cold devil in those
  smiling eyes.</p>

  <p>'To what am I indebted&mdash;' he began.</p>

  <p>'I come in a perfectly friendly spirit,' Leon's smile broadened, his eyes
  were twinkling, as with suppressed laughter. 'You will forgive that lie.
  Monsieur Levingrou, for lie it is. I have come to warn you that your wicked
  little business must be destroyed, or you will be made very unhappy. The
  police do not know of the Cafe Espagnol and its peculiar attractions.'</p>

  <p>He dived into his overcoat pocket and, with the quick, jerky motion which
  was characteristic of him, produced a sheet of notepaper and unfolded it.</p>

  <p>'I have here a list of thirty-two girls who have gone to one or another of
  your establishments during the past two years,' he said. 'You may read
  it'&mdash;and thrust the paper into Jules' hand&mdash;'for I have a copy. You
  will be interested to know that that sheet of paper represents six months'
  inquiries.'</p>

  <p>Jules did not so much as read a name. Instead, he shrugged, pushed the
  paper back to his visitor and, when Leon did not take it, dropped it on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>'I am entirely in the dark,' he said. 'If you have no business with me you
  had better go&mdash;goodnight.'</p>

  <p>'My friend'&mdash;Leon's voice was a little lower, and those eyes of his
  were piercing the very soul of the man who squatted like an ill-shaped toad
  in the luxurious deeps of silk and down&mdash;'you will send cables to your
  managers, ordering the release of those girls, the payment of adequate
  compensation, and first-class return ticket to London.'</p>

  <p>Levingrou shrugged.</p>

  <p>'I really don't know what you mean, my friend. It seems to me you've come
  upon a cock and bull story, that you have been deceived.'</p>

  <p>M. Jules Levingrou reached out deliberately and pressed an ivory
  bell-push.</p>

  <p>'I think you are mad, therefore I will take a very charitable view of what
  you say. Now, my friend, we have no more time to give to you.'</p>

  <p>But Leon Gonsalez was unperturbed.</p>

  <p>'I can only imagine that you have no imagination. Monsieur Levingrou,' he
  said, a little curtly. 'That you do not realize the torture, the sorrow, the
  ghastly degradation into which you throw these sisters of ours.'</p>

  <p>A gentle tap at the door and the footman entered. Mr. Levingrou indicated
  his visitor with a wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>'Show this gentleman to the door.'</p>

  <p>If he expected an outburst he was pleasantly disappointed. Leon looked
  from one man to the other, that mocking smile of his still playing about the
  corners of his sensitive mouth then, without a word, turned, and the door
  closed on him.</p>

  <p>'You heard&mdash;you heard?' Heinrich's voice was quivering with terror,
  his face the colour of dirty chalk. 'Herr Gott! you don't understand, Jules!
  I know of these men. A friend of mine... '</p>

  <p>He told a story that would have impressed most men; but Levingrou
  smiled.</p>

  <p>'You are scared, my poor friend. You have not my experience of threats.
  Let him prove what he can and go to the police.'</p>

  <p>'You fool!' Heinrich almost howled the words. 'The police! Do I not tell
  you they want no proof? They punished&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Hush!' growled Jules.</p>

  <p>He had heard the girl's step in the hall. She was going to the theatre,
  she said&mdash;her explanation stopped short at the sight of Heinrich's white
  face.</p>

  <p>'Daddy,' she said reproachfully, 'you've been quarrelling with Uncle
  Heinrich.'</p>

  <p>She stooped and kissed the forehead of her father and pulled his ear
  gently. The stout man imprisoned her in both his arms and chuckled.</p>

  <p>'No quarrel, my darling. Heinrich is scared of a business deal. You
  wouldn't imagine he could be such a baby.'</p>

  <p>A minute later she stood in front of the fireplace, using a lipstick
  skilfully. She paused in the operation to tell him an item of news.</p>

  <p>'I met such a nice man today, Daddy, at Lady Athery's, a Mr.
  Gordon&mdash;do you know him?'</p>

  <p>'I know many Mr. Gordons,' smiled Jules. And then, in sudden alarm: 'He
  didn't make love to you, did he?'</p>

  <p>She laughed at this.</p>

  <p>'My dear, he's almost as old as you. And he's a great artist and very
  amusing.'</p>

  <p>Jules walked with her to the door and saw her go down the steps, cross the
  little flagged garden, and stood there until her Rolls had passed out of
  sight. Then he came back to his pretty saloon to argue out this matter of the
  Four Just Men.</p>

  <p>It was a gay party of young people about her own age that Valerie joined.
  The box was crowded, and was hot and thick, for the theatre was one where
  smoking was allowed. She was relieved when an attendant tapped her on the
  shoulder and beckoned her out.</p>

  <p>'A gentleman to see you, miss.'</p>

  <p>'To see me?' she said in wonder, and came into the vestibule to find a
  handsome, middle-aged man in evening dress.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Gordon!' she exclaimed. 'I had no idea you were here!'</p>

  <p>He seemed unusually grave.</p>

  <p>'I have some rather bad news for you, Miss Levingrou,' he said, and she
  went pale.</p>

  <p>'Not about Father?'</p>

  <p>'In a sense it is. I am afraid that he is in rather bad trouble.'</p>

  <p>She frowned at this.</p>

  <p>'Trouble? What kind of trouble?'</p>

  <p>'I can't explain here. Will you come with me to the police station?'</p>

  <p>She stared at him incredulously, her mouth open.</p>

  <p>'The police station?'</p>

  <p>Gordon summoned a waiting attendant.</p>

  <p>'Get Miss Levingrou's coat from the box,' he said authoritatively.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later they passed out of the theatre together and into a
  waiting car.</p>

  <p>Twelve o'clock was striking when Mr. Levingrou rose from his chair stiffly
  and stretched himself. Heinrich had been gone nearly three hours. He had,
  indeed, left the house in time to catch the last train for the Continent,
  whither he fled without even packing so much as a pocket-handkerchief.
  Unaware of this desertion, Mr. Levingrou was on the point of mounting the
  stairs to bed when a thundering rat-tat shook the house. He turned to the
  footman.</p>

  <p>'See who that is,' he growled, and waited curiously.</p>

  <p>When the door was opened he saw the stocky figure of a police
  inspector.</p>

  <p>'Levingrou?' asked the visitor.</p>

  <p>Mr. Levingrou came forward.</p>

  <p>'That is my name,' he said.</p>

  <p>The inspector strolled into the hall.</p>

  <p>'I want you to come with me to the police station.' His manner was
  brusque, indeed rude, and Levingrou felt for the first time in his life a
  qualm of fear.</p>

  <p>'The police station? Why?'</p>

  <p>'I'll explain that to you when you get there.'</p>

  <p>'But this is monstrous!' exploded the stout man. I will telephone to my
  lawyers&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Are you going quietly?'</p>

  <p>There was such a threat in the tone that Jules became instantly
  tractable.</p>

  <p>'Very good, inspector, I will come. I think you have made a very great
  mistake and... '</p>

  <p>He was hustled out of the hall, down the steps and into the waiting
  car.</p>

  <p>It was not an ordinary taxi. The blinds were pulled down. Moreover, he
  discovered as soon as he entered the interior that it was well occupied. Two
  men sat on seats facing him, the inspector took his place by the prisoner's
  side.</p>

  <p>He could not see where the car was going. Five minutes, ten minutes
  passed... there should be a police station somewhere nearer than that. He put
  a question.</p>

  <p>'I can relieve your mind,' said a calm voice. 'You're not going to a
  police station.'</p>

  <p>'Then where am I being taken?'</p>

  <p>'That you will discover,' was the unsatisfactory answer.</p>

  <p>Nearly an hour passed before the car drew up before a dark house and the
  authoritative 'inspector' ordered him curtly to alight. The house had the
  appearance of being untenanted; the hall was littered with refuse and dust.
  They led him down a flight of stone stairs to the cellar, unlocked a steel
  door and pushed him inside.</p>

  <p>He had hardly entered before an electric light in the wall glowed dimly,
  and he saw that he was in what looked to be a concrete chamber, furnished
  with a bed. At the farther end was a small open doorway, innocent of door,
  which he was informed led to a washing place. But the revelation which came
  to Mr. Levingrou, and which struck terror to his soul, was the fact that the
  two men who had brought him were heavily masked&mdash;the inspector had
  disappeared and, try as he did, Jules could not remember what he looked
  like.</p>

  <p>'You will stay here and keep quiet, and you need not be afraid that
  anybody will be alarmed by your disappearance.'</p>

  <p>'But... my daughter!' stammered Levingrou in terror.</p>

  <p>'Your daughter? Your daughter leaves for the Argentine with a Mr. Gordon
  tomorrow morning&mdash;as other men's daughters have left.'</p>

  <p>Levingrou stared, took one step forward and fell fainting to the
  floor.</p>

  <p>Sixteen days passed; sixteen days of unadulterated hell for the shrieking,
  half-demented man who paced the length of his cell for hours on end till,
  exhausted, he dropped almost lifeless on his bed. And every morning came a
  masked man to tell him of plans that had been made, to describe in detail the
  establishment in Antofagasta which was to be the destination of Valerie
  Levingrou; of a certain piestro... they showed him his photograph... who was
  the master of that hell broth.</p>

  <p>'You devils! You devils!' shrieked Levingrou, striking wildly out, but the
  other caught him and flung him back on the bed.</p>

  <p>'You mustn't blame Gordon,' he mocked. 'He has his living to earn... he is
  merely the agent of the man who owns the cabaret.'</p>

  <p>Then one morning, the eighteenth, they came and told him, three masked
  men, that Valerie had arrived and was being initiated into her duties as a
  dancing girl...</p>

  <p>Jules Levingrou spent the night shivering in a corner of his cell. They
  came to him at three in the morning and pricked him with a hypodermic needle.
  When he woke, he thought he was dreaming, for he was sitting in his own
  saloon, where these masked men had carried him in the dead of night.</p>

  <p>A footman came in, and dropped the tray at the sight of him.</p>

  <p>'Good God, sir!' he gasped. 'Where did you come from?'</p>

  <p>Levingrou could not speak: he could only shake his head.</p>

  <p>'We thought you was in Germany, sir.'</p>

  <p>And then, clearing his dry throat, Jules asked harshly:</p>

  <p>'Is there any news... Miss Valerie... ?'</p>

  <p>'Miss Valerie, sir?' The footman was astonished. 'Why, yes sir, she's
  upstairs asleep. She was a bit worried the night she came back and found you
  weren't here, and then of course she got your letter saying you'd been called
  abroad.'</p>

  <p>The footman was staring at him, an uncomfortable wonder in his gaze.
  Something peculiar had happened. Jules rose unsteadily to his feet and caught
  a glance of his face in the mirror. His hair and his beard were white.</p>

  <p>He staggered rather than walked to his writing-table, jerked open a drawer
  and took out an overseas cable form. 'Ring for a messenger.' His voice was
  hoarse and quavering. 'I want to send fourteen cablegrams to South
  America.'</p>

     id="story08">VIII .&mdash; THE SHARE PUSHER</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>John Bull's Christmas Annual</i>, 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">THE man whom Raymond Poiccart ushered into the presence of
  Manfred was to all appearances a smart, military looking gentleman
  approaching the sixties. He was faultlessly dressed and had the carriage and
  presence of a soldier. A retired general, thought Manfred; but he saw
  something more than the outward personation of manner revealed. This man was
  broken. There was a certain imponderable expression in his face, a tense
  anguish which this, the shrewdest of the Three Just Men, instantly
  interpreted.</p>

  <p>'My name is Pole&mdash;Major-General Sir Charles Pole,' said the visitor,
  as Poiccart placed a chair for him and discreetly withdrew.</p>

  <p>'And you have come to see me about Mr. Bonsor True,' said Manfred
  instantly, and when the other started nervously he laughed. 'No, I am not
  being very clever,' said Manfred gently. 'So many people have seen me about
  Mr. Bonsor True. And I think I can anticipate your story. You have been
  investing in one of his oil concerns and you have lost a considerable sum of
  money. Was it oil?'</p>

  <p>'Tin,' said the other. 'Inter-Nigerian Tin. You have heard about my
  misfortune?'</p>

  <p>Manfred shook his head.</p>

  <p>'I have heard about the misfortunes of so many people who have trusted Mr.
  True. How much have you lost?'</p>

  <p>The old man drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>'Twenty-five thousand pounds,' he said, 'every penny I possess. I have
  consulted the police, but they say there is nothing they can do. The tin mine
  actually existed, and no misrepresentation was made by True in any letter he
  sent to me.'</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>'Yours is a typical case, General,' he said. 'True never brings himself
  within the reach of the law. All his misrepresentations are made over a
  luncheon table, when there is no other witness, and I presume that in his
  letters to you he pointed out the speculative nature of your investment and
  warned you that you were not putting your money into gilt-edged
  securities.'</p>

  <p>'It was at dinner,' said the General. 'I had some doubt on the matter and
  he asked me to dine with him at the Walkley Hotel. He told me that immense
  quantities of tin were in sight, and that while he could not, in justice to
  his partners, broadcast the exact amount of profit the company would make, he
  assured me that my money would be doubled in six months. I wouldn't mind so
  much,' the old man went on, as he raised his trembling hand to his lips,
  'but, Mr. Manfred, I have a daughter, a brilliant young girl who has, in my
  opinion, a wonderful future. If she had been a man she would have been a
  strategist. I hoped to have left her amply provided for, but this means
  ruin&mdash;ruin! Can nothing be done to bring this criminal to justice?'</p>

  <p>Manfred did not reply immediately.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if you realize. General, that you are the twelfth person who has
  come to us in the past three months. Mr. True is so well protected by the law
  and by his letters that it is almost impossible to catch him. There was a
  time'&mdash;he smiled faintly&mdash;'when my friends and I would have taken
  the most dramatic steps to deal with the gentleman, and I think our method
  would have been effective; but now'&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;'we
  are a little restricted. Who introduced you to this gentleman?'</p>

  <p>'Mrs. Calford Creen. I met the lady at a dinner of a mutual friend, and
  she asked me to dine with her at her flat in Hanover Mansions.'</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded again. He was not at all surprised by this
  intelligence.</p>

  <p>'I am afraid I can promise you very little,' he said. 'The only thing I
  would ask is that you should keep in touch with me. Where are you
  living?'</p>

  <p>His visitor was at the moment living in a little house near Truro. Manfred
  noted the address, and a few minutes later was standing by the window
  watching the weary old man walking slowly down Curzon Street.</p>

  <p>Poiccart came in.</p>

  <p>'I know nothing of this gentleman's business,' he said, 'but I have a
  feeling that it concerns our friend True. George, we ought to be able to
  catch that man. Leon was saying at breakfast this morning that there is a
  deep pond in the New Forest, where a man suitably anchored by chains and
  weights might lie without discovery for a hundred years. Personally, I am
  never in favour of drowning&mdash;'</p>

  <p>George Manfred laughed.</p>

  <p>''Ware the law, my good friend,' he said. 'There will be no killing,
  though a man who has systematically robbed the new poor deserves something
  with boiling lead in it.'</p>

  <p>Nor could Leon Gonsalez offer any solution when he was consulted that
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>'The curious thing is that True has no monies in this country. He runs two
  bank accounts and is generally overdrawn on both. I should not be surprised
  if he had a cache somewhere, in which case the matter would be
  simple&mdash;I've been watching him for the greater part of a year, and he
  never goes abroad, and I have searched his modest Westminster flat so often
  that I could go blindfolded to the place where he keeps his dress ties.'</p>

  <p>All this had occurred in the previous year and no further complaints came
  about this fraudulent share pusher. The Three were no nearer to a solution of
  their problem when came the rather remarkable disappearance of Margaret
  Lein.</p>

  <p>Margaret Lein was not a very important person: she was by all social
  standards as unimportant a person as one would be likely to meet in a stroll
  through the West End of London. She occupied the position of maid to the Hon
  Mrs. Calford Creen, and she had gone out one evening to the chemist to buy a
  bottle of smelling salts for her mistress, and had never come back.</p>

  <p>She was pretty; her age was nineteen; she had no friends in London,
  being&mdash;so she said&mdash;an orphan; and, so far as was known, she had no
  attachments in the accepted sense of the word. But, as the police pointed
  out, it was extremely unlikely that a rather pretty maid, well spoken and
  with charming manners, in addition to her physical perfections, could spend a
  year in London without having acquired something in the shape of a
  'follower.'</p>

  <p>Mrs. Calford Creen, not satisfied with the police inquiries, had called
  the Three Just Men to her aid. It was a week after the disappearance of
  Margaret Lein that a well-known lawyer crossed the polished dancing floor of
  the Leiter Club to greet the man who sat aloof and alone at a very small
  table near the floor's edge.</p>

  <p>'Why, Mr. Gonsalez!' he beamed. 'This is the last place in the world I
  should have expected to find you! In Limehouse, yes, prowling in the haunts
  of the underworld, yes, but at Letter's Club... Really, I have mistaken your
  character.'</p>

  <p>Leon smiled faintly, poured a little more Rhine wine into his long-stemmed
  glass and sipped it.</p>

  <p>'My dear Mr. Thurles,' he drawled, 'this is my underworld. That fat
  gentleman puffing gallantly with that stout lady is Bill Sikes. It is true he
  does not break into houses nor carry a life-preserver, but he sells dud
  shares to thrifty and gullible widows, and has grown fat on the proceeds.
  Some day I shall take that gentleman and break his heart.'</p>

  <p>The red-faced Thurles chuckled as he sat down by the other's side.</p>

  <p>'That will be difficult. Mr. Bonsor True is too rich a man to pull down,
  however much a blackguard he may be.'</p>

  <p>Leon fixed a cigarette in a long amber tube and seemed wholly absorbed in
  the operation, which he performed with great care.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps I oughtn't to have made that horrific threat,' he said. 'True is
  a friend of your client's, isn't he?'</p>

  <p>'Mrs. Creen?' Thurles was genuinely surprised. 'I wasn't aware of the
  fact.'</p>

  <p>'I must have been mistaken,' said Leon, and changed the subject.</p>

  <p>He knew right well that he was not mistaken. That stout share plugger had
  been the <i>tête-à-tête</i> guest of Mrs. Creen on the night Margaret Lein
  had disappeared from human ken; and the curious circumstance was that neither
  to the police nor to the Triangle had Mrs. Creen mentioned this interesting
  fact.</p>

  <p>She lived in a modest flat near Hanover Court: a rather pretty, hard-faced
  young widow, whose source of income was believed to be a legacy left by her
  late husband. Leon, a very inquisitive man, had made the most careful
  inquiries without discovering either that she had had a husband or that he
  had died. All he knew of her was that she took frequent trips abroad,
  sometimes to out-of-the-way places like Roumania; that she was invariably
  accompanied by the missing Margaret; that she spent money, not freely but
  lavishly, gave magnificent entertainments in Paris, Rome, and once in
  Brussels, and seemed quite content to return from a life which must have cost
  her at least seven hundred and fifty pounds a week to the modest
  establishment near Hanover Court where her rent was seven hundred and fifty
  pounds per annum and her household bills did not exceed twenty pounds a
  week.</p>

  <p>Leon watched the dancing for a little longer, beckoned a waiter and paid
  his bill. The lawyer had gone back to his party. He saw Mr. Bonsor True, the
  centre of a gay table, and smiled to himself, and wondered whether the share
  plugger would be as cheerful if he knew that in the right hand inside pocket
  of Leon Gonsalez' coat was a copy of a marriage certificate that he had dug
  out that morning.</p>

  <p>It had been an inspiration that had led Leon Gonsalez to Somerset
  House.</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch: late as the hour was, there was still a hope of
  finding Mrs. Creen. His car was waiting in the park in Wellington Place, and
  ten minutes later he had stopped before the doors of Hanover Mansions. A lift
  carried him to the third floor. He pressed the bell of No 109. A light showed
  in the fanlight, and it was Mrs. Creen herself who opened the door to him.
  Evidently she expected somebody else, for she was momentarily taken back.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Mr. Gonsalez!' And then, quickly: 'Have you had news of
  Margaret?'</p>

  <p>'I am not quite sure whether I have or not,' said Leon. 'May I see you for
  a few minutes?'</p>

  <p>Something in his tone must have warned her.</p>

  <p>'It's rather late, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'It will save me a journey in the morning,' he almost pleaded and with
  some reluctance she admitted him.</p>

  <p>It was not the first visit he had paid to her flat, and he had duly noted
  that, although her method of living was fairly humble, the flat itself was
  furnished regardless of expense.</p>

  <p>She offered him a whisky and soda, which he accepted but did not
  drink.</p>

  <p>'I want to ask you,' he said, when she had settled down, 'how long you
  have had Margaret in your employ?'</p>

  <p>'Over a year,' she replied.</p>

  <p>'A nice girl?'</p>

  <p>'Very. But I told you about her. It has been a great shock to me.'</p>

  <p>'Would you call her accomplished? Did she speak any foreign
  languages?'</p>

  <p>Mrs. Creen nodded.</p>

  <p>'French and German perfectly&mdash;that was why she was such a treasure.
  She had been brought up with a family in Alsace, and was, I believe, half
  French.'</p>

  <p>'Why did you send her out to the chemist for smelling salts?'</p>

  <p>The woman moved impatiently.</p>

  <p>'I have already told you, as I told the police, that I had a very bad
  headache, and Margaret herself suggested she should go to the chemist.'</p>

  <p>'For no other reason? Couldn't Mr. True have gone?'</p>

  <p>She nearly jumped at this.</p>

  <p>'Mr. True? I don't know what you mean.'</p>

  <p>'True was with you that night; you had been dining <i>tête-à-tête</i>. In
  fact, you were dining as one would expect a husband and wife to dine.'</p>

  <p>The woman went white, was momentarily bereft of speech.</p>

  <p>'I don't know why you're making such a mystery of your marriage, Mrs.
  Creen, but I know that for five years past you have not only been married to
  True, but you have been his partner, in the sense that you have assisted him
  in his&mdash;er&mdash;financial operations. Now, Mrs. True, I want you to put
  your cards on the table. When you went abroad you took this girl with
  you?'</p>

  <p>She nodded dumbly.</p>

  <p>'What was your object in going to Paris, Rome and Brussels? Had you any
  other object than to enjoy yourself? Was there any business reason for your
  move?'</p>

  <p>He saw her lick her dry lips, but she did not reply.</p>

  <p>'Let me put it more plainly. Have you in any of those cities a private
  safe at any of the banking corporations or safe deposits?'</p>

  <p>She sprang to her feet, her mouth open in surprise.</p>

  <p>'Who told you?' she asked quickly. 'What business is that of yours,
  anyway?'</p>

  <p>As she spoke, came the gentle tinkle of a bell, and she half turned.</p>

  <p>'Let me open it for you,' said Leon, and before she could move he was down
  the passage and had flung open the door.</p>

  <p>An astonished financier was standing on the doormat. At the sight of Leon
  he gaped.</p>

  <p>'Come inside, Mr. True,' said Leon gently. 'I think I have some
  interesting news for you.'</p>

  <p>'Who&mdash;who are you?' stammered the older man, peering at the visitor,
  and then of a sudden he recognized him. 'My God! One of the Four Just Men,
  eh? Well, have you found that girl?'</p>

  <p>He realized at that moment that the question in itself was a blunder. He
  was not supposed to be interested in the missing maid.</p>

  <p>'I haven't found her, and I think she's going to be rather difficult for
  any of us to find,' said Leon.</p>

  <p>By this time Mrs. Creen had recovered her self-possession.</p>

  <p>'I'm awfully glad you came, Mr. True. This gentleman has been making the
  most extraordinary statements about us. He is under the impression we are
  married. Did you ever hear anything so ridiculous?'</p>

  <p>Leon did not attempt to refute the absurdity of his suggestion until they
  were back in the little drawing-room.</p>

  <p>'Now, sir,' said Mr. Bonsor True, his pompous self, 'whatever do you mean
  by making&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Leon cut him short.</p>

  <p>'I will tell you briefly what I have already told your wife,' he said;
  'and as to your marriage, that is so indisputable a fact that I will not
  attempt to show you the marriage certificate which is in my pocket. I'm not
  here to reproach you, True, or this lady. The question of your treatment of
  the unfortunate people who have invested money with you is a matter for your
  own conscience. What I do wish to know is, whether it is a fact that in
  certain continental cities you have safes or deposits where you keep your
  wealth?'</p>

  <p>The significance of the question was not lost upon the stout Mr. True.</p>

  <p>'There are certain deposits of mine on the Continent,' he said, 'but I
  don't quite understand&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Will you be perfectly frank with me, Mr. True?' There was a hint of
  impatience in Leon's tone. 'Are there in Paris, Rome or Brussels safes of
  yours, and are you in the habit of carrying the keys of those safes?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Bonsor True smiled.</p>

  <p>'No, sir; I have places of deposit, and they are in fact safes. But they
  have combinations&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Ah ha!' Leon's face lit. 'And do you by any chance carry the combination
  words in your pocket?'</p>

  <p>For a second True hesitated, and then he took from his waistcoat pocket,
  fastened to a platinum chain, a small golden book about the size of a postage
  stamp.</p>

  <p>'Yes, I carry them here&mdash;and why on earth I should be discussing my
  private business&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'That's all I wanted to know.'</p>

  <p>He stared at the visitor. Leon was laughing softly but heartily, rubbing
  his hands as at the best joke in the world.</p>

  <p>'Now I think I understand,' he said. 'I also know why you sent Miss
  Margaret Lein to the chemist to get a little smelling salts. It was you they
  were for!'&mdash;his accusing finger pointed at the financier.</p>

  <p>True's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>'That's true: I was taken suddenly ill.'</p>

  <p>'Mr. True fainted,' Mrs.. Creen broke in. 'I sent Margaret up to my room
  to get some smelling salts, but they weren't there. It was she who
  volunteered to buy them from the chemist.'</p>

  <p>Leon wiped his eyes.</p>

  <p>'That's a great joke,' he said; 'and now I can reconstruct the whole
  story. What time did you call on Mrs. Creen that evening?'</p>

  <p>True thought.</p>

  <p>'About seven.'</p>

  <p>'Are you in the habit of drinking cocktails, and are they usually waiting
  for you in the dining-room?'</p>

  <p>'In the drawing-room,' corrected Mrs. Creen.</p>

  <p>'You took a cocktail,' Leon went on, 'and then you suddenly went out. In
  other words, somebody had doctored your drink with a knock-out drop. Mrs.
  Creen was not, of course, in the room. When you fell, Margaret Lein examined
  your book and got the combination words she wanted. She had been abroad with
  Mrs. Creen, so she knew this playful little method of yours of caching your
  ill-gotten gains.'</p>

  <p>True's face went from livid red to ashy white.</p>

  <p>'The combination word?' he said huskily. 'She got the combination word?
  Oh, my God!'</p>

  <p>Without another word he flew from the room and they heard the front door
  thunder as he slammed it.</p>

  <p>Leon went at greater leisure, but he arrived, in Curzon Street in time for
  supper.</p>

  <p>'I'm not going to investigate any further,' he said, 'but it's any odds
  that those safes in Paris and Rome are empty by now, and that a very clever
  girl, who is certainly the daughter of one of Mr. True's deluded clients, is
  now in a position to help her parents.'</p>

  <p>'How do you know that she has parents?' asked Manfred.</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' replied Leon frankly. 'But I am certain she had a
  father&mdash;I wired to General Pole last week to discover if his clever
  daughter was staying with him, and he wired back that "Margaret had been
  abroad finishing her education for the past year." And I suppose that acting
  as maid to the partner of a share crook is an education.'</p>

  <h2><a name="story09"
     id="story09">IX .&mdash; THE MAN WHO SANG IN CHURCH</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>20 Story Magazine</i>, September 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">TO Leon Gonsalez went most of the cases of blackmail which
  came the way of the Three Just Men.</p>

  <p>And yet, from the views he had so consistently expressed, he was the last
  man in the world to whom such problems should have gone, for in that famous
  article of his entitled 'Justification,' which put up the sales of a
  quarterly magazine by some thousand per cent, he offered the following
  opinion:</p>

  <p>'... as to blackmail, I see no adequate punishment but death in the case
  of habitual offenders. You cannot parley with the type of criminal who
  specialises in this loathsome form of livelihood. Obviously there can be no
  side of him to which appeal can be made: no system of reformation can effect
  him. He is dehumanised, and may be classified with the secret poisoner, the
  drug pusher and... '</p>

  <p>He mentioned a trade as degrading.</p>

  <p>Leon found less drastic means of dealing with these pests; yet we may
  suppose that the more violent means which distinguished the case of Miss
  Brown and the man who sang in church had his heartiest approval.</p>

  <p>There are so many types of beauty that even Leon Gonsalez, who had a
  passion for classification, gave up at the eighteenth sub-division of the
  thirty-third category of brunettes. By which time he had filled two large
  quarto notebooks.</p>

  <p>If he had not wearied of his task before he met Miss Brown, he would
  assuredly have recognized its hopelessness, for she fell into no category,
  nor had he her peculiar attractions catalogued in any of his sub-sections.
  She was dark and slim and elegant. Leon hated the word, but he was compelled
  to admit this characteristic. The impression she left was one of delicate
  fragrance. Leon called her the Lavender Girl. She called herself Brown, which
  was obviously not her name; also, in the matter of simulations, she wore a
  closely-fitting hat which came down over her eyes and would make subsequent
  identification extremely difficult.</p>

  <p>She timed her visit for the half-light of dusk&mdash;the cigarette hour
  that follows a good dinner, when men are inclined rather to think than to
  talk, and to doze than either.</p>

  <p>Others had come at this hour to the little house in Curzon Street, where
  the silver triangle on the door marked the habitation of the Three Just Men,
  and when the bell rang George Manfred looked up at the clock.</p>

  <p>'See who it is, Raymond: and before you go, I will tell you. It is a young
  lady in black, rather graceful of carriage, very nervous and in bad
  trouble.'</p>

  <p>Leon grinned as Poiccart rose heavily from his chair and went out.</p>

  <p>'Clairvoyance rather than deduction,' he said, 'and observation rather
  than either: from where you sit you can see the street. Why mystify our dear
  friend?'</p>

  <p>George Manfred sent a ring of smoke to the ceiling. 'He is not mystified,'
  he said lazily. 'He has seen her also. If you hadn't been so absorbed in your
  newspaper you would have seen her, too. She has passed up and down the street
  three times on the other side. And on each occasion she has glanced toward
  this door. She is rather typical, and I have been wondering exactly what
  variety of blackmail has been practised on her.'</p>

  <p>Here Raymond Poiccart came back.</p>

  <p>'She wishes to see one of you,' he said. 'Her name is Miss Brown&mdash;but
  she doesn't look like a Miss Brown!'</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded to Leon. 'It had better be you,' he said.</p>

  <p>Gonsalez went to the little front drawing-room, and found the girl
  standing with her back to the window, her face in shadow. 'I would rather you
  didn't put on the light, please,' she said, in a calm, steady voice. 'I don't
  want to be recognized if you meet me again.'</p>

  <p>Leon smiled.</p>

  <p>I had no intention of touching the switch,' he said. 'You see,
  Miss&mdash;' He waited expectantly.</p>

  <p>'Brown,' she replied, so definitely that he would have known she desired
  anonymity even if she had not made her request in regard to the light. 'I
  told your friend my name.'</p>

  <p>'You see, Miss Brown,' he went on, 'we have quite a number of callers who
  are particularly anxious not to be recognized when we meet them again. Will
  you sit down? I know that you have not much time, and that you are anxious to
  catch a train out of town.'</p>

  <p>She was puzzled.</p>

  <p>'How did you know that?' she asked.</p>

  <p>Leon made one of his superb gestures.</p>

  <p>'Otherwise you would have waited until it was quite dark before you made
  your appointment. You have, in point of fact, left it just as late as you
  could.'</p>

  <p>She pulled a chair to the table and sat down slowly, turning her back to
  the window.</p>

  <p>'Of course that is so,' she nodded. 'Yes, I have to leave in time, and I
  have cut it fine. Are you Mr. Manfred?'</p>

  <p>'Gonsalez,' he corrected her.</p>

  <p>'I want your advice,' she said.</p>

  <p>She spoke in an even, unemotional voice, her hands lightly clasped before
  her on the table. Even in the dark, and unfavourably placed as she was for
  observation, he could see that she was beautiful. He guessed from the
  maturity of her voice that she was in the region of twenty-four.</p>

  <p>'I am being blackmailed. I suppose you will tell me I should go to the
  police, but I am afraid the police would be of no assistance, even if I were
  willing to risk an appearance in Court, which I am not. My father'&mdash;she
  hesitated&mdash;'is a Government official. It would break his heart if he
  knew. What a fool I've been!'</p>

  <p>'Letters?' asked Leon, sympathetically.</p>

  <p>'Letters and other things,' she said. 'About six years ago I was a medical
  student at St John's Hospital. I didn't take my final exam for reasons which
  you will understand. My surgical knowledge has not been of very much use to
  me, except... well, I once saved a man's life, though I doubt if it was worth
  saving. He seems to think it was, but that has nothing to do with the case.
  When I was at St John's I got to know a fellow-student, a man whose name will
  not interest you and, as girls of my age sometimes do, I fell desperately in
  love with him. I didn't know that he was married, although he told me this
  before our friendship reached a climax.</p>

  <p>'For all that followed I was to blame. There were the usual
  letters&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And these are the basis of the blackmail?' asked Leon.</p>

  <p>She nodded. 'I was worried ill about the... affair. I gave up my work and
  returned home; but that doesn't interest you, either.'</p>

  <p>'Who is blackmailing you?' asked Leon.</p>

  <p>She hesitated. 'The man. It's horrible isn't it? But he has gone down and
  down. I have money of my own&mdash;my mother left me two thousand pounds a
  year&mdash;and of course I've paid.'</p>

  <p>'When did you see this man last?'</p>

  <p>She was thinking of something else, and she did not answer him. As he
  repeated the question, she looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>'Last Christmas Day&mdash;only for a moment. He wasn't staying with
  us&mdash;I mean it was at the end of... '</p>

  <p>She had become suddenly panic-stricken, confused, and was almost
  breathless as she went on:</p>

  <p>'I saw him by accident. Of course he didn't see me, but it was a great
  shock... It was his voice. He always had a wonderful tenor voice.'</p>

  <p>'He was singing?' suggested Leon, when she paused, as he guessed, in an
  effort to recover her self-possession.</p>

  <p>'Yes, in church,' she said desperately. 'That is where I saw him.'</p>

  <p>She went on speaking with great rapidity, as though she were anxious not
  only to dismiss from her mind that chance encounter, but to make Leon also
  forget.</p>

  <p>'It was two months after this that he wrote to me&mdash;he wrote to our
  old address in London. He said he was in desperate need of money, and wanted
  five hundred pounds. I'd already given him more than one thousand pounds, but
  I was sane enough to write and tell him I intended to do no more. It was then
  that he horrified me by sending a photograph of the letter&mdash;one of the
  letters&mdash;I had sent him. Mr. Gonsalez, I have met another man, and...
  well, John had read the news of my engagement.'</p>

  <p>'Your fiance knows nothing about this earlier affair?'</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>'No, nothing, and he mustn't know. Otherwise everything would be simple.
  Do you imagine I would allow myself to be blackmailed any further but for
  that?'</p>

  <p>Leon took a slip of paper from one pocket and a pencil from another.</p>

  <p>'Will you tell me the name of this man? John&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'John Letheritt, 27, Lion Row, Whitechurch Street. It's a little room that
  he has rented, as an office, and a sleeping-place. I've already had inquiries
  made.'</p>

  <p>Leon waited.</p>

  <p>'What is the crisis&mdash;why have you come now?' he asked.</p>

  <p>She took from her bag a letter, and he noted that it was in a clean
  envelope; evidently she had no intention that her real name and address
  should be known.</p>

  <p>He read it, and found it a typical communication. The letter demanded
  £3,000 by the third of the month, failing which the writer intended putting
  'papers' in 'certain hands.' There was just that little touch of melodrama
  which for some curious reason the average blackmailer adopts in his
  communiques.</p>

  <p>'I'll see what I can do&mdash;how am I to get in touch with you?' asked
  Leon. 'I presume that you don't wish that either your real name or your
  address should be known even to me.'</p>

  <p>She did not answer until she had taken from her bag a number of banknotes,
  which she laid on the table.</p>

  <p>Leon smiled. 'I think we'll discuss the question of payment when we have
  succeeded. What is it you want me to do?'</p>

  <p>'I want you to get the letters and, if it is possible, I want you so to
  frighten this man that he won't trouble me again. As to the money, I shall
  feel so much happier if you will let me pay you now!'</p>

  <p>'It is against the rules of the firm!' said Leon cheerfully.</p>

  <p>She gave him a street and a number which he guessed was an accommodation
  address.</p>

  <p>'Please don't see me to the door,' she said, with a half-glance at the
  watch on her wrist.</p>

  <p>He waited till the door closed behind her, and then went upstairs to his
  companions.</p>

  <p>'I know so much about this lady that I could write a monograph on the
  subject,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Tell us a little,' suggested Manfred. But Leon shook his head.</p>

  <p>That evening he called at Whitechurch Street. Lion Row was a tiny,
  miserable thoroughfare, more like an alley than anything, and hardly deserved
  its grand designation. In one of those ancient houses which must have seen
  the decline of Alsatia, at the top of three rickety flights of stairs, he
  found a door, on which had been recently painted: 'J. LETHERITT,
  EXPORTER.'</p>

  <p>His knock produced no response.</p>

  <p>He knocked again more heavily, and heard the creaking of a bed, and a
  harsh voice on the other side asking who was there. It took some time before
  he could persuade the man to open the door, and then Leon found himself in a
  very long, narrow room, lighted by a shadeless electric table-lamp. The
  furniture consisted of a bed, an old washstand and a dingy desk piled high
  with unopened circulars.</p>

  <p>He guessed the man who confronted him, dressed in a soiled shirt and
  trousers, to be somewhere in the region of thirty-five; he certainly looked
  older. His face was unshaven and there was in the room an acrid stink of
  opium.</p>

  <p>'What do you want?' growled John Letheritt, glaring suspiciously at the
  visitor.</p>

  <p>With one glance Leon had taken in the man&mdash;a weakling, he
  guessed&mdash;one who had found and would always take the easiest way. The
  little pipe on the table by the bed was a direction post not to be
  mistaken.</p>

  <p>Before he could answer, Letheritt went on: 'If you have come for letters
  you won't find them here, my friend.' He shook a trembling hand in Leon's
  face. 'You can go back to dear Gwenda and tell her that you are no more
  successful than the last gentleman she sent!'</p>

  <p>'A blackmailer, eh? You are the dirtiest little blackmailer I ever met,'
  mused Leon. 'I suppose you know the young lady intends to prosecute you?'</p>

  <p>'Let her prosecute. Let her get a warrant and have me pinched! It won't be
  the first time I've been inside! Maybe she can get a search warrant, then
  she'll be able to have her letters read in Court. I'm saving you a lot of
  trouble. I'll save Gwenda trouble, too! Engaged, eh? You're not the
  prospective bridegroom?' he sneered.</p>

  <p>'If I were, I should be wringing your neck,' said Leon calmly. 'If you are
  a wise man&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I'm not wise,' snarled the other. 'Do you think I'd be living in this
  pigsty if I were? Me... a man with a medical degree?'</p>

  <p>Then, with a sudden rage, he pushed his visitor towards the door.</p>

  <p>'Get out and stay out!'</p>

  <p>Leon was so surprised by this onslaught that he was listening to the door
  being locked and bolted against him before he had realized what had
  happened.</p>

  <p>From the man's manner, he was certain that the letters were in that
  room&mdash;there were a dozen places where they might be hidden: he could
  have overcome the degenerate with the greatest ease, bound him to the bed and
  searched the room, but in these days the Three Just Men were very law-abiding
  people.</p>

  <p>Instead he came back to his friends late that night with the story of his
  partial failure.</p>

  <p>'If he left the house occasionally, it would be easy&mdash;but he never
  goes out. I even think that Raymond and I could, without the slightest
  trouble, make a very thorough search of the place. Letheritt has a bottle of
  milk left every morning, and it shouldn't be difficult to put him to sleep if
  we reached the house a little after the milkman.'</p>

  <p>Manfred shook his head.</p>

  <p>'You'll have to find another way; it's hardly worth while antagonizing the
  police,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Which is putting it mildly,' murmured Poiccart. 'Who's the lady?'</p>

  <p>Leon repeated almost word for word the conversation he had had with Miss
  Brown.</p>

  <p>'There are certain remarkable facts in her statement, and I am pretty sure
  they were facts, and that she was not trying to deceive me,' he said.
  'Curious item Number One is that the lady heard this man singing in church
  last Christmas Day. Is Mr. Letheritt the kind of person one would expect to
  hear exercising his vocal organs on Christmas carols? My brief acquaintance
  with him leads me to suppose that he isn't. Curious item Number Two was the
  words: "He wasn't staying with us," or something of that sort; and he was
  "nearing the end"&mdash;of what? Those three items are really
  remarkable!'</p>

  <p>'Not particularly remarkable to me,' growled Poiccart. 'He was obviously a
  member of a house-party somewhere, and she didn't know he was staying in the
  neighbourhood, until she saw him in church. It was near the end of his
  visit.'</p>

  <p>Leon shook his head.</p>

  <p>'Letheritt has been falling for years. He hasn't reached his present state
  since Christmas; therefore he must have been as bad&mdash;or nearly as
  bad&mdash;nine months ago. I really have taken a violent dislike to him, and
  I must get those letters.'</p>

  <p>Manfred looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'They would hardly be at his bankers, because he wouldn't have a banker;
  or at his lawyers, because I should imagine that he is the kind of person
  whose acquaintance with law begins and ends in the Criminal Courts. I think
  you are right, Leon; the papers are in his room.'</p>

  <p>Leon lost no time. Early the next morning he was in Whitechurch Street,
  and watched the milkman ascend to the garret where Letheritt had his foul
  habitation. He waited till the milkman had come out and disappeared but,
  sharp as he was, he was hardly quick enough. By the time he had reached the
  top floor, the milk had been taken in, and the little phial of colourless
  fluid which might have acted as a preservative to the milk was unused.</p>

  <p>The next morning he tried again, and again he failed.</p>

  <p>On the fourth night, between the hours of one and two, he managed to gain
  an entry into the house, and crept noiselessly up the stairs. The door was
  locked from the inside, but he could reach the end of the key with a pair of
  narrow pliers he carried.</p>

  <p>There was no sound from within, when he snapped back the lock and turned
  the handle softly. He had forgotten the bolts.</p>

  <p>The next day he came again, and surveyed the house from the outside. It
  was possible to reach the window of the room, but he would need a very long
  ladder, and after a brief consultation with Manfred, he decided against the
  method.</p>

  <p>Manfred made a suggestion.</p>

  <p>'Why not send him a wire, asking him to meet your Miss Brown at Liverpool
  Street Station? You know her Christian name?'</p>

  <p>Leon sighed wearily.</p>

  <p>'I tried that on the second day, my dear chap, and had little Lew Leveson
  on hand to "whizz" him the moment he came into the street in case he was
  carrying the letters on him.'</p>

  <p>'By "whizz" you mean to pick his pocket? I can't keep track of modern
  thief slang,' said Manfred. 'In the days when I was actively interested, we
  used to call it "dip".'</p>

  <p>'You are out of date, George; "whizz" is the word. But of course the
  beggar didn't come out. If he owed rent I could get the brokers put in; but
  he does not owe rent. He is breaking no laws, and is living a fairly
  blameless life&mdash;except, of course, one could catch him for being in
  possession of opium. But that wouldn't be much use, because the police are
  rather chary of allowing us to work with them.' He shook his head. 'I'm
  afraid I shall have to give Miss Brown a very bad report.'</p>

  <p>It was not until a few days later that he actually wrote to the agreed
  address, having first discovered that it was, as he suspected, a small
  stationer's shop where letters could be called for.</p>

  <p>A week later Superintendent Meadows, who was friendly with the Three, came
  down to consult Manfred on a matter of a forged Spanish passport, and since
  Manfred was an authority on passport forgeries and had a fund of stories
  about Spanish criminals, it was long after midnight when the conference broke
  up.</p>

  <p>Leon, who needed exercise, walked to Regent Street with Meadows, and the
  conversation turned to Mr. John Letheritt.</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes, I know him well. I took him two years ago on a false pretence
  charge, and got him eighteen months at the London Assizes. A real bad egg,
  that fellow, and a bit of a squeaker, too. He's the man who put away Joe
  Benthall, the cleverest cat burglar we've had for a generation. Joe got ten
  years, and I shouldn't like to be this fellow when he comes out!'</p>

  <p>Suddenly Leon asked a question about Letheritt's imprisonment, and when
  the other had answered, his companion stood stock-still in the middle of the
  deserted Hanover Square and doubled up with silent laughter.</p>

  <p>'I don't see the joke.'</p>

  <p>'But I do,' chuckled Leon. 'What a fool I've been! And I thought I
  understood the case!'</p>

  <p>'Do you want Letheritt for anything? I know where he lives,' said
  Meadows.</p>

  <p>Leon shook his head.</p>

  <p>'No, I don't want him: but I should very much like to have ten minutes in
  his room!'</p>

  <p>Meadows looked serious.</p>

  <p>'He's blackmailing, eh? I wondered where he was getting his money
  from.'</p>

  <p>But Leon did not enlighten him. He went back to Curzon Street and began
  searching certain works of reference, and followed this by an inspection of a
  large scale map of the Home Counties. He was the last to go to bed, and the
  first to waken, for he slept in the front of the house and heard the knocking
  at the door.</p>

  <p>It was raining heavily as he pulled up the window and looked out; and in
  the dim light of dawn he thought he recognized Superintendent Meadows. A
  second later he was sure of his visitor's identity.</p>

  <p>'Will you come down? I want to see you.'</p>

  <p>Gonsalez slipped into his dressing-gown, ran downstairs and opened the
  door to the Superintendent.</p>

  <p>'You remember we were talking about Letheritt last night?' said Meadows as
  Leon ushered him into the little waiting-room.</p>

  <p>The superintendent's voice was distinctly unfriendly, and he was eyeing
  Leon keenly.</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;I remember.'</p>

  <p>'You didn't by any chance go out again last night?'</p>

  <p>'No. Why?'</p>

  <p>Again that look of suspicion.</p>

  <p>'Only Letheritt was murdered at half past one this morning, and his room
  ransacked.'</p>

  <p>Leon stared at him.</p>

  <p>'Murdered? Have you got the murderer?' he asked at last.</p>

  <p>'No, but we shall get him all right. He was seen coming down the rainpipe
  by a City policeman. Evidently he had got into Letheritt's room through the
  window, and it was this discovery by the constable which led to a search of
  the house. The City Police had to break in the door, and they found Letheritt
  dead on the bed. He had evidently been hit on the head with a jemmy, and
  ordinarily that injury would not have killed him, according to the police
  doctor; but in his state of health it was quite enough to put him out. A
  policeman went round the house to intercept the burglar, but somehow he must
  have escaped into one of the little alleys that abound in this part of the
  city, and he was next seen by a constable in Fleet Street, driving a small
  car, the number-plate of which had been covered with mud.'</p>

  <p>'Was the man recognized?'</p>

  <p>'He hasn't been&mdash;yet. What he did was to leave three fingerprints on
  the window, and as he was obviously an old hand at the game, that is as good
  as a direct identification. The City Detective Force called us in, but we
  haven't been able to help them except to give them particulars of Letheritt's
  past life. Incidentally, I supplied them with a copy of your fingerprints. I
  hope you don't mind.'</p>

  <p>Leon grinned.</p>

  <p>'Delighted!' he said.</p>

  <p>After the officer had left, Leon went upstairs to give the news to his two
  friends.</p>

  <p>But the most startling intelligence was to come when they were sitting at
  breakfast. Meadows arrived. They saw his car draw up and Poiccart went out to
  open the door to him. He strode into the little room, his eyes bulging with
  excitement.</p>

  <p>'Here's a mystery which even you fellows will never be able to solve,' he
  said. 'Do you know that this is a day of great tragedy for Scotland Yard and
  for the identification system? It means the destruction of a method that has
  been laboriously built up... '</p>

  <p>'What are you talking about?' asked Manfred quickly.</p>

  <p>'The fingerprint system,' said Meadows, and Poiccart, to whom the
  fingerprint method was something God-like, gaped at him. 'We've found a
  duplicate,' said Meadows. 'The prints on the glass were undoubtedly the
  prints of Joe Benthall&mdash;and Joe Benthall is in Wilford County Gaol
  serving the first part of a ten years' sentence!'</p>

  <p>Something made Manfred turn his head toward his friend. Leon's eyes were
  blazing, his thin face wreathed in one joyous smile.</p>

  <p>'The man who sang in church!' he said softly. 'This is the prettiest case
  that I have ever dealt with. Now sit down, my dear Meadows, and eat! No, no:
  sit down. I want to hear about Benthall&mdash;is it possible for me to see
  him?'</p>

  <p>Meadows stared at him.</p>

  <p>'What use would that be? I tell you this is the biggest blow we've ever
  had. And what is more, when we showed the City policeman a photograph of
  Benthall, he recognized him as the man he had seen coming down the rainpipe!
  I thought Benthall had escaped, and phoned the prison. But he's there all
  right.'</p>

  <p>'Can I see Benthall?'</p>

  <p>Meadows hesitated.</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;I think it could be managed. The Home Office is rather friendly
  with you, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>Friendly enough, apparently. By noon, Leon Gonsalez was on his way to
  Wilford Prison and, to his satisfaction, he went alone.</p>

  <p>Wilford Gaol is one of the smaller convict establishments, and was brought
  into use to house long-time convicts of good character who were acquainted
  with the bookbinding and printing trade. There are several 'trade' prisons in
  England&mdash;Maidstone is the 'printing' prison, Shepton Mallet the 'dyeing'
  prison&mdash;where prisoners may exercise their trades.</p>

  <p>The chief warder, whom Leon interviewed, told him that Wilford was to be
  closed soon, and its inmates transferred to Maidstone. He spoke regretfully
  of this change.</p>

  <p>'We've got a good lot of men here&mdash;they give us no trouble, and they
  have an easy time. We've had no cases of indiscipline for years. We only have
  one officer on night-duty&mdash;that will give you an idea how quiet we
  are.'</p>

  <p>'Who was the officer last night?' asked Leon, and the unexpectedness of
  the question took the chief warder by surprise.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Bennett,' he said, 'he's gone sick today by the way&mdash;a bilious
  attack. Curious thing you should ask the question: I've just been to see him.
  We had an inquiry about the man you've come to visit. Poor old Bennett is in
  bed with a terrible headache.'</p>

  <p>'Can I see the Governor?' asked Leon.</p>

  <p>The chief warder shook his head.</p>

  <p>'He's gone to Dover with Miss Folian&mdash;his daughter. She's gone off to
  the Continent.'</p>

  <p>'Miss Gwenda Folian?' and when the chief warder nodded: 'Is she the lady
  who was training to be a doctor?'</p>

  <p>'She is a doctor,' said the other emphatically. 'Why, when Benthall nearly
  died from a heart attack, she saved his life&mdash;he works in the Governor's
  house, and I believe he'd cut off his right hand to serve the young lady.
  There's a lot of good in some of these fellows!'</p>

  <p>They were standing in the main prison hall. Leon gazed along the grim
  vista of steel balconies and little doors.</p>

  <p>'This is where the night-warder sits, I suppose?' he asked, as he laid his
  hand on the high desk near where they were standing: 'and the door
  leads&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'To the Governor's quarters.'</p>

  <p>'And Miss Gwenda often slips through there with a cup of coffee and a
  sandwich for the night man, I suppose?' he added carelessly.</p>

  <p>The chief warder was evasive.</p>

  <p>'It would be against regulations if she did,' he said. 'Now you want to
  see Benthall?'</p>

  <p>Leon shook his head.</p>

  <p>'I don't think so,' he said quietly.</p>

  <p>'Where could a blackguard like Letheritt be singing in church on Christmas
  Day?' asked Leon when he was giving the intimate history of the case to his
  companions. 'In only one place&mdash;a prison. Obviously our Miss Brown was
  in that prison: the Governor and his family invariably attend church.
  Letheritt was "not staying"&mdash;it was the end of his sentence, and he had
  been sent to Wilford for discharge. Poor Meadows! With all his faith in
  fingerprints gone astray because a released convict was true to his word and
  went out to get the letters that I missed, whilst the doped Mr. Bennett slept
  at his desk and Miss Gwenda Folian took his place!'</p>

  <h2><a name="story10"
     id="story10">X .&mdash; THE LADY FROM BRAZIL</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>20 Story Magazine</i>, October 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">THE journey had begun in a storm of rain and had continued
  in mist. There was a bumpiness over the land which was rather trying to
  airsick passengers. The pilot struck the Channel and dropped to less than two
  hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Then came the steward with news that he bawled above the thunder of
  engines.</p>

  <p>'We're landin' at Lympne... thick fog in London... coaches will take you
  to London...'</p>

  <p>Manfred leaned forward to the lady who was sitting on the other side of
  the narrow gangway.</p>

  <p>'Fortunate for you,' he said, tuning his voice so that it reached no other
  ear.</p>

  <p>The Honourable Mrs. Peversey raised her glasses and surveyed him
  cold-bloodedly.</p>

  <p>'I beg your pardon?'</p>

  <p>They made a perfect landing soon after, and as Manfred descended the steps
  leading from the Paris plane he offered his hand to assist the charming lady
  to alight.</p>

  <p>'You were saying&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>The slim, pretty woman regarded him with cold and open-eyed insolence.</p>

  <p>'I was saying that it was rather fortunate for you that we landed here,'
  said Manfred. 'Your name is Kathleen Zieling, but you are known better as
  "Claro" May, and there are two detectives waiting for you in London to
  question you on the matter of a pearl necklace that was lost in London three
  months ago. I happen to understand French very well and I heard two gentlemen
  of the Surete discussing your future just before we left Le Bourget.'</p>

  <p>The stare was no longer insolent, but it was not concerned. Apparently her
  scrutiny of the man who offered such alarming information satisfied her in
  the matter of his sincerity.</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' she said easily, 'but I am not at all worried. Fenniker and
  Edmonds are the two men. I'll wire them to meet me at my hotel. You don't
  look like a "bull" but I suppose you are?'</p>

  <p>'Not exactly,' smiled Manfred.</p>

  <p>She looked at him oddly.</p>

  <p>'You certainly look too honest for a copper. I'm OK, but thank you all the
  same.'</p>

  <p>This was a dismissal, but Manfred stood his ground.</p>

  <p>'If you get into any kind of trouble I'd be glad if you'd call me up.' He
  handed the woman a card, at which she did not even glance. 'And if you wonder
  why I am interested, I only want to tell you that a year ago a very dear
  friend of mine would have been killed by the Fouret gang which caught him
  unprepared on Montmartre, only you very kindly helped him.'</p>

  <p>Now, with a start of surprise, she read the card and, reading, changed
  colour.</p>

  <p>'Oh!' she said awkwardly. 'I didn't know that you were one of that
  bunch&mdash;Four Just Men? You folks give me the creeps! Leon
  something&mdash;a dago name...'</p>

  <p>'Gonsalez,' suggested Manfred, and she nodded.</p>

  <p>That's right!'</p>

  <p>She was looking at him now with a new interest.</p>

  <p>'Honest there's no trouble coming about the pearls. And as to your friend,
  he saved me. He wouldn't have got into the gang fight, only he came out of
  the cabaret to help me.'</p>

  <p>'Where are you staying in London?'</p>

  <p>She told him her address, and at that moment came a Customs officer to
  break the conversation. Manfred did not see her again&mdash;she was not in
  the closed coach that carried him to London.</p>

  <p>In truth he had no great wish to meet her again. Curiosity and a desire to
  assist one who had given great help to Leon Gonsalez&mdash;it was the
  occasion of Leon's spectacular unravelling of the Lyons forgeries&mdash;were
  behind his action.</p>

  <p>Manfred neither sympathized with nor detested criminals. He knew May to be
  an international swindler on the grand scale, and was fairly well satisfied
  that she would be well looked after by the English police.</p>

  <p>It was on the journey to London that he regretted that he had not asked
  her for information about Garry, though in all probability they had never
  met.</p>

  <p>George Manfred, by common understanding the leading spirit of the Four
  Just Men, had in the course of his life removed three-and-twenty social
  excrescences from all human activities.</p>

  <p>The war brought him and his companions a pardon for offences known and
  offences suspected. But in return the pardoning authorities had exacted from
  him a promise that he should keep the law in letter and in spirit, and this
  he had made, not only on his own behalf but on behalf of his companions. Only
  once did he express regret for having made this covenant, and that was when
  Garry Lexfield came under his observation.</p>

  <p>Garry lived on the outer edge of the law. He was a man of thirty, tall,
  frank of face, rather good looking. Women found him fascinating, to their
  cost, for he was of the ruthless kind; quite nice people invited him to their
  homes&mdash;he even reached the board of a well-known West End Company.</p>

  <p>Manfred's first encounter with Garry was over a stupidly insignificant
  matter. Mr. Lexfield was engaged in an argument at the corner of Curzon
  Street, where he had his flat. Manfred, returning late, saw a man and a woman
  talking, the man violently, the woman a little timidly. He passed them,
  thinking that it was one of those quarrels in which wise men are not
  interested, and then he heard the sound of a blow and a faint scream. He
  turned to see the woman crouching by the area railings of the house. Quickly
  he came back.</p>

  <p>'Did you hit that woman?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'It's none of your dam' business&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Manfred swung him from his feet and dropped him over the area railings.
  When he looked round the woman had vanished.</p>

  <p>'I might have killed him,' said Manfred penitently, and the spectacle of a
  penitent Manfred was too much for Leon Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>'But you didn't&mdash;what happened?'</p>

  <p>'When I saw him get up on his feet and knew nothing was broken I bolted,'
  confessed Manfred. 'I really must guard against these impulses. It must be my
  advancing years that has spoilt my judgment.'</p>

  <p>If Poiccart had a very complete knowledge of the sordid underworld,
  Manfred was a living encyclopaedia on the swell mob; but for some reason Mr.
  Lexfield was outside his knowledge. Leon made investigations and
  reported.</p>

  <p>'He has been thrown out of India and Australia. He is only "wanted" in New
  Zealand if he attempts to go back there. His speciality is bigamous marriages
  into families which are too important to risk a scandal. The swell mob in
  London only know of him by hearsay. He has a real wife who has followed him
  to London and was probably the lady who was responsible for his visit to the
  area.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Garry Lexfield had 'touched' royally, and luck had been with him,
  since, unostentatiously and in an assumed name, he had stepped on to the
  Monrovia at Sydney. He had the charm and the attraction which are
  three-quarters of the good thief's assets. Certainly he charmed the greater
  part of three thousand pounds out of the pockets of two wealthy Australian
  land-owners, and attracted to himself the daughter of one who at any rate had
  the appearance of being another.</p>

  <p>When he landed he was an engaged man: happily and mercifully, his
  bride-to-be was taken ill on the day of her arrival with a prosaic attack of
  appendicitis. Before she had left her nursing home, he learned that that
  bluff squatter, her father, so far from being a millionaire, was in very
  considerable financial difficulties.</p>

  <p>But the luck held: a visit to Monte Carlo produced yet another small
  fortune&mdash;which was not gained at the public tables. Here he met and
  wooed Elsa Monarty, convent-trained and easily fascinated. A sister, her one
  relative, had sent her to San Remo&mdash;oddly enough, she also was
  convalescing from an illness&mdash;and, straying across the frontier, she met
  the handsome Mr. Lexfield&mdash;which was not his name&mdash;in the big
  vestibule of the rooms. She wanted a ticket of admission&mdash;the gallant
  Garry was most obliging. She told him about her sister, who was the manager
  and part owner of a big dress-making establishment in the Rue de la Paix.
  Giving confidence for confidence, Garry told her of his rich and titled
  parents, and described a life which was equally mythical.</p>

  <p>He came back to London alone and found himself most inconveniently dogged
  by the one woman in the world who was entitled to bear his name, which was
  Jackson&mdash;a pertinacious if handsome woman who had no particular
  affection for him, but was anxious to recover for the benefit of his two
  neglected children a little of the fortune he had dissipated.</p>

  <p>And most pertinacious at a moment when, but for his inherent meanness, he
  would have gladly paid good money to be rid of her.</p>

  <p>It was a week after he had had the shocking experience of finding himself
  hurled across fairly high railings into a providentially shallow area, and he
  was still inclined to limp, when Leon Gonsalez, who was investigating his
  case, came with the full story of the man's misdeeds.</p>

  <p>'I would have dropped him a little more heavily if I had known,' said
  Manfred regretfully. 'The strange thing is that the moment I lifted
  him&mdash;it's a trick you have never quite succeeded in acquiring,
  Leon&mdash;I knew he was something pestilential. We shall have to keep an
  unfriendly eye on Mr. Garry Lexfield. Where does he stay?'</p>

  <p>'He has a sumptuous flat in Jermyn Street,' said Leon. 'Before you tell me
  that there are no sumptuous flats in Jermyn Street, I would like to say that
  it has the appearance of sumptuousness. I was so interested in this gentleman
  that I went round to the Yard and had a chat with Meadows. Meadows knows all
  about him, but he has no evidence to convict. The man's got plenty of
  money&mdash;has an account at the London and Southern, and bought a car this
  afternoon.'</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'A pretty bad man,' he said. 'Is there any chance of finding his wife? I
  suppose the unfortunate lady who was with him&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'She lives in Little Titchfield Street&mdash;calls herself Mrs. Jackson,
  which is probably our friend's name. Meadows is certain that it is.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Garry Lexfield was too wise a man not to be aware of the fact that he
  was under observation; but his was the type of crime which almost defies
  detection. His pleasant manner and his car, plus a well-organized accident to
  his punt on one of the upper reaches of the Thames, secured him introductions
  and honorary membership of a very exclusive river club; and from there was
  but a step to homes which ordinarily would have been barred to him.</p>

  <p>He spent a profitable month initiating two wealthy stockbrokers into the
  mysteries of bushman poker, at which he was consistently unlucky for five
  successive nights, losing some £600 to his apologetic hosts. There was no
  necessity for their apologies as it turned out: on the sixth and seventh
  days, incredible as it may seem, he cleared the greater part of £5,000 and
  left his hosts with the impression of his regret that he had been the medium
  of their loss.</p>

  <p>'Very interesting,' said Manfred when this was reported to him.</p>

  <p>Then, one night when he was dining at the Ritz-Carlton with a young man to
  whom he had gained one of his quick introductions, he saw his supreme
  fortune.</p>

  <p>'Do you know her?' he asked in an undertone of his companion.</p>

  <p>'That lady? Oh, Lord, yes! I've known her for years. She used to stay with
  my people in Somerset&mdash;Madame Velasquez. She's the widow of a terribly
  rich chap, a Brazilian.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Lexfield looked again at the dark, beautiful woman at the next table.
  She was perhaps a little over-jewelled to please the fastidious. Swathes of
  diamond bracelets encircled her arm from the wrist up; an immense emerald
  glittered in a diamond setting on her breast. She was exquisitely dressed and
  her poise was regal.</p>

  <p>'She's terribly rich,' prattled on his informant. 'My colonel, who knows
  her much better than I, told me her husband had left her six million
  pounds&mdash;it's wicked that people should have so much money.'</p>

  <p>It was wicked, thought Garry Lexfield, that anybody should have so much
  money if he could not 'cut' his share.</p>

  <p>'I'd like to meet her,' he said, and a minute later the introduction was
  made and Garry forgot his arrangement to trim the young guardsman that night
  in the thrill of confronting a bigger quarry.</p>

  <p>He found her a remarkably attractive woman. Her English, though slightly
  broken, was good. She was obviously pleased to meet him. He danced with her a
  dozen times and asked to be allowed to call in the morning. But she was
  leaving for her country place in Seaton Deverel.</p>

  <p>'That's rather strange,' he said, with his most dazzling smile. 'I'm
  driving through Seaton Deverel next Saturday.'</p>

  <p>To his joy she bit the bait. At noon on the Saturday his car shot up the
  long drive to Hanford House.</p>

  <p>A week later came Leon with startling news.</p>

  <p>'This fellow's got himself engaged to a rich South American widow, George.
  We can't allow that to go any further. Let us have an orgy of
  lawlessness&mdash;kidnap the brigand and put him on a cattle boat. There's a
  man in the East India Dock Road who would do it for fifty pounds.'</p>

  <p>Manfred shook his head.</p>

  <p>'I'll see Meadows,' he said. 'I have an idea that we may catch this
  fellow.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Garry Lexfield was not in that seventh heaven of delight to which
  accepted lovers are supposed to ascend; but he was eminently satisfied with
  himself as he watched the final touches being made to the dinner table in his
  flat.</p>

  <p>Madame Velasquez had taken a great deal of persuading, had shown an
  extraordinary suspicion, and asked him to introduce her to those parents of
  his who were at the moment conveniently attending to their large estates in
  Canada.</p>

  <p>'It is a very serious step I take, Garry dear,' she said, shaking her
  pretty head dubiously. 'I love you very dearly, of course, but I am so
  fearful of men who desire only money and not love.'</p>

  <p>'Darling, I don't want money,' he said vehemently. 'I have shown you my
  passbook: I have nine thousand pounds in the bank, apart from my
  estates.'</p>

  <p>She shrugged this off. Madame was a lady of peculiar temperament, never in
  the same mood for longer than an hour.</p>

  <p>She came to dinner and, to his annoyance, brought a chaperon&mdash;a girl
  who spoke no word of English. Mr. Lexfield was a very patient man and
  concealed his anger.</p>

  <p>She brought news that made him forget the inconvenience of a chaperon. It
  was while they were sipping coffee in his over-decorated little drawing-room
  that she told him:</p>

  <p>'Such a nice man I meet today. He came to my house in the country.'</p>

  <p>'He was not only nice, but lucky,' smiled Garry, who was really not
  feeling terribly happy.</p>

  <p>'And he spoke about you,' she smiled.</p>

  <p>Garry Lexfield became instantly attentive. Nobody in England knew him well
  enough to make him the subject of conversation. If they did, then the
  discussion had not been greatly to his advantage.</p>

  <p>'Who was this?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'He spoke such perfect Spanish, and he has a smile the most delightful!
  And he said so many funny things that I laughed.'</p>

  <p>'A Brazilian?' he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>'In Brazil we speak Portuguese,' she said. 'No, Senor Gonsalez&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Gonsalez?' he said quickly. 'Not Leon Gonsalez? One of those
  swi&mdash;men... the Three Just Men?'</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>'Do you know them?'</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>I have heard about them. Blackguards that should have been hanged years
  ago. They are murderers and thieves. They've got a nerve to come and see you.
  I suppose he said something pretty bad about me? The truth is, I've been an
  enemy of theirs for years... '</p>

  <p>He went on to tell an imaginary story of an earlier encounter he had had
  with the Three, and she listened intently.</p>

  <p>'How interesting!' she said at last. 'No, they simply said of you that you
  were a bad man, and that you wanted my money; that you had a bad&mdash;what
  is the word?&mdash;record. I was very angry really, especially when they told
  me that you had a wife, which I know is not true, because you would not
  deceive me. Tomorrow he comes again, this Senor Gonsalez&mdash;he really did
  amuse me when I was not angry. Shall I lunch with you and tell you what he
  said?'</p>

  <p>Garry was annoyed: he was thoroughly alarmed. It had not been difficult to
  locate and identify the man who had taken such summary action with him; and,
  once located, he had decided to give a wide berth to the men who lived behind
  the Silver Triangle. He had sense enough to know they were not to be
  antagonized, and he had hoped most sincerely that they had been less acute in
  tracing him than he had been in identifying them.</p>

  <p>He changed the conversation and became, in spite of the witness, the most
  ardent and tender of lovers. All his art and experience was called into play;
  for here was a prize which had been beyond his dreams.</p>

  <p>His immediate objective was some £20,000 which had come to the lady in the
  shape of dividends. She had displayed a pretty helplessness in the matter of
  money, though he suspected her of being shrewd enough. Garry Lexfield could
  talk very glibly and fluently on the subject of the market. It was his pet
  study; it was likewise his continuous undoing. There never was a thief who
  did not pride himself on his shrewdness in money matters, and Garry had come
  in and out of the market from time to time in his short and discreditable
  life with disastrous results to himself.</p>

  <p>He saw her and her silent companion to the car and went back, and in the
  solitude of his flat turned over the new and alarming threat represented by
  the interest which the Three Just Men were showing in his activities.</p>

  <p>He rose late, as was his practice, and was in his pyjamas when the
  telephone-bell rang. The voice of the porter informed him that there was a
  trunk call for him and trunk calls these days meant the lovely Velasquez.</p>

  <p>'I have seen Gonsalez,' said her urgent voice. 'He came when I was at
  breakfast. Tomorrow, he says, they will arrest you because of something you
  did in Australia. Also today he applies to stop your money coming from the
  bank.'</p>

  <p>'Holding up my account?' said Garry quickly. 'Are you sure?'</p>

  <p>'Certain I am sure! They will go to a judge in his rooms and get a paper.
  Shall I come to lunch?'</p>

  <p>'Of course&mdash;one o'clock,' he said quickly. He glanced at the little
  clock on the mantelshelf: it was half-past eleven.</p>

  <p>'And about your investments: I think I can fix everything today. Bring
  your cheque-book.'</p>

  <p>He was impatient for her to finish the conversation, and at last rather
  abruptly he brought it to a termination, dashed down the receiver, and,
  flying into his bedroom, began to dress.</p>

  <p>His bank was in Fleet Street, and the journey seemed interminable. Fleet
  Street was much too close to the Law Courts for his liking. The judge's order
  might already be effective.</p>

  <p>He pushed his cheque under the brass grille of the tellers' counter and
  held his breath while the slip of paper was handed to the accountant for
  verification. And then, to his overwhelming relief, the teller opened his
  drawer, took out a pad of notes and counted out the amount written on the
  cheque.</p>

  <p>'This leaves only a few pounds to your credit, Mr. Lexfield,' he said.</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Garry. 'I'm bringing in rather a big cheque after lunch,
  and I want you to get a special clearance.'</p>

  <p>It was then he realized that by that time the judge's order would be in
  operation. He must find another way of dealing with Madame Velasquez's
  cheque.</p>

  <p>The relief was so great that he could hardly speak calmly. With something
  short of £9,000 he hurried back to Jermyn Street and arrived simultaneously
  with Madame Velasquez.</p>

  <p>'How funny that caballero was, to be sure!' she said in her staccato way.
  'I thought I should have laughed in his face. He told me you would not be
  here tomorrow, which is so absurd!'</p>

  <p>'It's blackmail,' said Garry easily. 'Don't you worry about Gonsalez. I
  have just been to Scotland Yard to report him. Now about these
  shares&mdash;'</p>

  <p>They had ten minutes to wait before lunch was ready, and those ten minutes
  were occupied with many arguments. She had brought her cheque-book, but she
  was a little fearful. Perhaps, he thought, the visit of Gonsalez had really
  aroused her suspicions. She was not prepared to invest the whole of her
  £20,000. He produced the papers and balance sheets that he had intended
  showing her on the previous night and explained, as he could very readily
  explain, the sound financial position of the company&mdash;one of the most
  solid on the Rand&mdash;in which he wished her to invest.</p>

  <p>'These shares,' he said impressively, 'will rise in the next twenty-four
  hours by at least ten per cent. in value. I've got a block held for you, but
  I must get them this afternoon. My idea is that immediately after lunch you
  should bring me an open cheque; I'll buy the shares and bring them back to
  you.'</p>

  <p>'But why could not I go?' she asked innocently.</p>

  <p>'This is a personal matter,' said Garry with great gravity. 'Sir John is
  allowing me to buy this stock as a great personal favour.'</p>

  <p>To his joy she accepted this assurance&mdash;she actually wrote a cheque
  for £12,500 at the luncheon table, and he could scarcely summon patience to
  sit through the meal.</p>

  <p>The proprietors of the flats in which he had his brief habitation did not
  cater on a generous scale, but the short time which elapsed before the
  dessert stage of the lunch arrived was a period of agony. She returned once
  to the question of her investment, seemed in doubt, referred again to
  Gonsalez and his warning.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps I had better wait for a day&mdash;yes?'</p>

  <p>'My dear girl, how absurd!' said Garry. 'I really believe you are being
  frightened by this fellow who called on you this morning! I'll make him
  sorry!'</p>

  <p>He half rose from the table, but she put her hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>'Please don't hurry,' she begged, and reluctantly he agreed. The bank did
  not close until three; there would be time to reach Dover by car and catch
  the five o'clock boat.</p>

  <p>But the bank was situated in the City, and he must not cut his time too
  fine. He excused himself for a moment, went out in search of the valet he had
  acquired and gave him a few simple but urgent instructions. When he returned
  she was reading the balance sheet.</p>

  <p>'I am so foolish about these matters,' she said, and suddenly lifted her
  head. 'What was that?' she asked, as the door slammed.</p>

  <p>'My valet&mdash;I have sent him out on a little errand.</p>

  <p>She laughed nervously.</p>

  <p>'I am what you call on the jump,' she said, as she pushed his coffee
  towards him. 'Now tell me again, Garry, dear, what does ex-dividend
  mean?'</p>

  <p>He explained at length, and she listened attentively. She was still
  listening when, with a sudden little choke of alarm, he half rose from his
  feet, only to fall back on the chair and thence to roll helplessly to the
  floor. Madame Velasquez took his half-empty cup of coffee, carried it at her
  leisure into the kitchen and emptied the contents into the sink. When he sent
  his valet out, Mr. Garry Lexfield had saved her a great deal of trouble.</p>

  <p>She rolled the unconscious man on to his back, and searched quickly and
  with a dexterous hand pocket after pocket until she found the fat envelope
  wherein Garry had placed his banknotes.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the outer door. Without hesitation she went out and
  opened it to the young guardsman who had so kindly introduced Mr. Lexfield to
  her.</p>

  <p>'It's all right, the servant's gone,' she said. 'Here's your two hundred,
  Tony, and thank you very much.'</p>

  <p>Tony grinned.</p>

  <p>'The grudge I've got against him is that he took me for a sucker. These
  Australian crooks&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Don't talk&mdash;get,' she said tersely.</p>

  <p>She went back to the dining-room, removed Carry's collar and tie and,
  putting a pillow under his head, opened the window. In twenty minutes he
  would be more or less conscious, by which time his valet would have
  returned.</p>

  <p>She found the cheque she had given to him, burnt it in the empty grate,
  and with a last look round took her departure.</p>

  <p>Outside the airport a tall man was waiting. She saw him signal to the
  driver of the car to pull up.</p>

  <p>'I got your message,' said Manfred sardonically. 'I trust you've had a
  good killing? I owe you five hundred pounds.'</p>

  <p>She shook her head with a laugh. She was still the brown, beautiful
  Brazilian&mdash;it would take weeks before the stain would be removed.</p>

  <p>'No, thank you, Mr. Manfred. It was a labour of love, and I have been
  pretty well paid. And the furnished house I took in the country was really
  not a very expensive proposition&mdash;oh, very well, then.' She took the
  notes he handed to her and put them in her bag, one eye on the waiting plane.
  'You see, Mr. Manfred, Garry is an old acquaintance of mine&mdash;by hearsay.
  I sent my sister down to Monte Carlo for her health. She also found
  Garry.'</p>

  <p>Manfred understood. He waited till the plane had passed through the haze
  out of sight, and then he went back to Curzon Street, well satisfied.</p>

  <p>The evening newspapers had no account of the Jermyn Street robbery, which
  was easily understood. Mr. Garry Lexfield had a sense of pride.</p>

  <h2><a name="story11"
     id="story11">XI .&mdash; THE TYPIST WHO SAW THINGS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>20 Story Magazine</i>, November 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">ABOUT every six months Raymond Poiccart grew restless, and
  began prodding about in strange corners, opening deed boxes and trunks, and
  sorting over old documents. It was a few days before the incident of the
  Curzon Street 'murder' that he appeared in the dining room with an armful of
  old papers, and placed them on that portion of the table which had not been
  laid for dinner.</p>

  <p>Leon Gonsalez looked and groaned.</p>

  <p>George Manfred did not even smile, though he was laughing internally.</p>

  <p>'I am indeed sorry to distress you, my dear friends,' said Poiccart
  apologetically; 'but these papers must be put in order. I have found a bundle
  of letters that go back five years, to the time when the agency was a
  child.'</p>

  <p>'Burn 'em,' suggested Leon, returning to his book. 'You never do anything
  with them, anyway!'</p>

  <p>Poiccart said nothing. He went religiously from paper to paper, read them
  in his short-sighted way, and put them aside so that as one pile diminished
  another pile grew.</p>

  <p>'And I suppose when you've finished you'll put them back where you found
  them?' said Leon.</p>

  <p>Poiccart did not answer. He was reading a letter.</p>

  <p>'A strange communication, I don't remember reading this before,' he
  said.</p>

  <p>'What is it, Raymond?' asked George Manfred. Raymond read:</p>

  <p>'To the Silver Triangle. Private.</p>

  <p>'Gentlemen:</p>

  <p>'I have seen your names mentioned in a case as being reliable agents who
  can be trusted to work of a confidential character. I would be glad if you
  would make inquiries and find out for me the prospects of the Persian Oil
  Fields; also if you could negociate the sale of 967 shares held by me. The
  reason I do not approach an ordinary share-broker is because there are so
  many sharks in this profeccion. Also could you tell me whether there is a
  sale for Okama Biscuit shares (American)? Please let me know this.</p>

  <p>'Yours faithfully,</p>

  <p>'J Rock.'</p>

  <p>'I recall that letter,' said Leon promptly. '"Negotiate" and "profession"
  were spelt with c's. Don't you remember, George, I suggested this fellow had
  stolen some shares and was anxious to make us the means by which he disposed
  of his stolen property?'</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>'Rock,' said Leon softly. "No, I have never met Mr. Rock. He wrote from
  Melbourne, didn't he, and gave a box number and a telegraphic address? Did we
  hear again from him? I think not.'</p>

  <p>None of the three could recollect any further communication: the letter
  passed with the others and might have remained eternally buried, but for
  Leon's uncanny memory for numbers and spelling errors.</p>

  <p>And then one night:</p>

  <p>A police whistle squealed in Curzon Street. Gonsalez, who slept in the
  front of the house, heard the sound in his dreams, and was standing by the
  open window before he was awake. Again the whistle sounded, and then Gonsalez
  heard the sound of flying feet. A girl was racing along the sidewalk. She
  passed the house, stopped, and ran back, and again came to a standstill.</p>

  <p>Leon went down the narrow stairs two at a time, unlocked the front door
  and flung it open. The fugitive stood immediately before him.</p>

  <p>'In here&mdash;quickly!' said Leon.</p>

  <p>She hesitated only a second; stepping backward through the doorway, she
  waited. Leon gripped her by the arm and pulled her into the passage.</p>

  <p>'You needn't be frightened of me or my friends,' he said.</p>

  <p>But he felt the arm in his hand strain for release. 'Let me go,
  please&mdash;I don't want to stay here!'</p>

  <p>Leon pushed her into the back room and switched on the light.</p>

  <p>'You saw a policeman running up toward you, that's why you came back,' he
  said, in his quiet, conversational way. 'Sit down and rest&mdash;you look all
  in!'</p>

  <p>'I'm innocent... !' she began, in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>He patted her shoulder.</p>

  <p>'Of course you are. I, on the contrary, am guilty, for whether you're
  innocent or not, I am undoubtedly helping a fugitive from justice.'</p>

  <p>She was very young&mdash;scarcely more than a child. The pale, drawn face
  was pretty. She was well, but not expensively, dressed, and it struck Leon as
  a significant circumstance that on one finger was an emerald ring, which, if
  the stone were real, must have been worth hundreds of pounds. He glanced at
  the clock. A few minutes after two. There came to them the sound of heavy,
  hurrying feet.</p>

  <p>'Did anybody see me come in?' she asked, fearfully.</p>

  <p>'Nobody was in sight. Now what is the trouble?' Danger and fear had held
  her tense, almost capable. The reaction had come now: she was shaking.
  Shoulders, hands, body quivered pitiably. She was crying noiselessly, her
  lips trembled; for the time being she was inarticulate. Leon poured water
  into a glass and held it to her chattering teeth. If the others had heard
  him, they had no intention of coming down to investigate. The curiosity of
  Leon Gonsalez was a household proverb. Any midnight brawl would bring him out
  of bed and into the street.</p>

  <p>After a while, she was calm enough to tell her story, and it was not the
  story he expected.</p>

  <p>'My name is Farrer&mdash;Eileen Farrer. I am a typist attached to Miss
  Lewley's All-Night Typing Agenda. Usually there are two girls on duty, one a
  senior; but Miss Leah went home early. We call ourselves an all-night agency,
  but really we close down about one o'clock. Most of our work is theatrical.
  Often, after a first-night performance, certain changes have to be made in a
  script&mdash;and sometimes new contracts are arranged over supper, and we
  prepare the rough drafts. At other times it is just letter-work. I know all
  the big managers, and I've often gone to their offices quite late to do work
  for them. We never, of course, go to strange people and at the offices we
  have a porter who is also a messenger, to see that we are not annoyed. At
  twelve o'clock I had a phone message from Mr. Grasleigh, of the Orpheum,
  asking me if I would do two letters for him. He sent his car for me, and I
  went to his flat in Curzon Street. We're not allowed to go to the private
  houses of our clients, but I knew Mr. Grasleigh was a client, though I had
  never met him before.'</p>

  <p>Leon Gonsalez had often seen Mr. Jesse Grasleigh's bright yellow car. That
  eminent theatrical manager lived in some exclusive flats in Curzon Street,
  occupying the first floor, and paying&mdash;as Leon, who was insatiably
  curious, discovered&mdash;£3,000 a year. He had dawned on London three years
  before, had acquired the lease of the Orpheum, and had been interested in
  half a dozen productions, most of which had been failures.</p>

  <p>'What time was this?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'A quarter to one,' said the girl. 'I reached Curzon Street at about a
  quarter after. I had several things to do at the office before I left,
  besides which he told me there was no immediate hurry. I knocked at the door
  and Mr. Grasleigh admitted me. He was in evening dress, and looked as if he
  had come from a party. He had a big white flower in the buttonhole of his
  tail coat. I saw no servants, and I know now there were none in the flat. He
  showed me into his study, which was a large room, and pulled up a chair to a
  little table by his desk. I don't know exactly what happened. I remember
  sitting down and taking my notebook out of my attache case and opening it,
  and I was stooping to find a pencil in the case when I heard a groan, and,
  looking up, I saw Mr. Grasleigh lying back in his chair with a red mark on
  his white shirt-front&mdash;it was horrible!'</p>

  <p>'You heard no other sound, no shot?' asked Leon.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>'I was so horrified I couldn't move. And then I heard somebody scream and,
  looking round, I saw a lady, very beautifully dressed, standing in the
  doorway. "What have you done to him?" she said. "You horrible woman, you've
  killed him!" I was so terrified that I couldn't speak, and then I must have
  got into a panic, for I ran past her and out of the front door&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It was open?' suggested Leon.</p>

  <p>She frowned.</p>

  <p>'Yes, it was open. I think the lady must have left it open. I heard
  somebody blow a police whistle, but I can't remember how I got down the
  stairs or into the street. You're not going to give me up, are you?' she
  asked wildly.</p>

  <p>He leaned over and patted her hand.</p>

  <p>'My young friend,' he said, gently, 'you have nothing whatever to fear.
  Stay down here while I dress, and then you and I will go down, to Scotland
  Yard and you will tell them all you know.'</p>

  <p>'But I can't. They'll arrest me!'</p>

  <p>She was on the verge of hysteria, and it was perhaps a mistake to attempt
  to argue with her.</p>

  <p>'Oh, it's horrible. I hate London... I wish I'd never left Australia...
  First the dogs and then the black man and now this...'</p>

  <p>Leon was startled, but this was not a moment to question her. The thing to
  do was to bring her to a calm understanding of the situation.</p>

  <p>'Don't you realize that they won't blame you, and that your story is such
  that no police officer in the world would dream of suspecting it?'</p>

  <p>'But I ran away&mdash;' she began.</p>

  <p>'Of course you ran away,' he said soothingly. 'I should probably have run
  away too. Just wait here.'</p>

  <p>He was half-way through dressing when he heard the front door slam and,
  running down the stairs, found that the girl had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Manfred was awake when he went into his room and told him the story.</p>

  <p>'No, I don't think it's a pity that you didn't call me earlier,' he
  interrupted Leon's apology. 'We couldn't very well have detained her in any
  circumstances. You know where she is employed. See if you can get Lewley's
  Agency on the telephone.'</p>

  <p>Leon found the number in the book, but had no answer from his call.</p>

  <p>When he was dressed he went into the street and made his way to Curzon
  House. To his surprise he found no policeman on guard at the door, though he
  saw one at the corner of the street, nor was there any evidence that there
  had been a tragedy. The front door of the flat was fastened, but inserted in
  the wall were a number of small bell-pushes, each evidently communicating
  with one of the flats, and after a while he discovered that which bore the
  name Grasleigh and was on the point of ringing when the policeman he had seen
  came silently across from the other side of the road. He evidently knew
  Leon.</p>

  <p>'Good evening, Mr. Gonsalez,' he said. 'It wasn't you blowing that police
  whistle, was it?'</p>

  <p>'No&mdash;I heard it, though.'</p>

  <p>'So did I and three or four of my mates,' said the policeman. 'We've been
  flying round these streets for a quarter of an hour, but we haven't found the
  man who blew it.'</p>

  <p>'Probably I'll be able to help you.'</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that he heard the door unlocked, and nearly dropped,
  for the man who opened the door to him he recognized as Grasleigh himself. He
  was in a dressing-gown; the half of a cigar was in the corner of his
  mouth.</p>

  <p>'Hullo!' he said in surprise. 'What's the trouble?'</p>

  <p>'Can I see you for a few minutes?' said Leon when he had recovered from
  his surprise.</p>

  <p>'Certainly,' said the 'dead man', 'though it's hardly the time I like to
  receive callers. Come up.'</p>

  <p>Wonderingly Leon followed him up the stairs to the first floor. He saw no
  servants, but there was not the slightest evidence to associate this place
  with the dramatic scene which the girl had described. Once they were in the
  big study, Leon told his story. When he had finished, Grasleigh shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>'The girl's mad! It's perfectly true that I did telephone for her, and as
  a matter of fact I thought it was her when you rang the bell. I assure you
  she hasn't been here tonight... Yes, I heard the police whistle blow, but I
  never mix myself up in these midnight troubles.' He was looking at Leon
  keenly. 'You're one of the Triangle people, aren't you, Mr. Gonsalez? What
  was this girl like?'</p>

  <p>Leon described her, and again the theatrical manager shook his head.</p>

  <p>'I've never heard of her,' he said. 'I'm afraid you've been the victim of
  a hoax, Mr. Gonsalez.'</p>

  <p>Leon went back to join his two friends, a very bewildered man.</p>

  <p>The next morning he called at Lewles Agency, which he knew by repute as a
  well-conducted establishment of its kind, and interviewed its good-natured
  spinster-proprietress. He had to exercise a certain amount of caution: he was
  most anxious not to get the girl into trouble. Fortunately, he knew an
  important client of Miss Lewley's and he was able to use this unconscious man
  as a lever to extract the information he required.</p>

  <p>'Miss Farrer is doing night duty this week, and she will not be in until
  this evening,' she explained. 'She has been with us about a month.'</p>

  <p>'How long has Mr. Grasleigh been a client of yours?'</p>

  <p>'Exactly the same time,' she said with a smile. 'I rather think he likes
  Miss Farrer's work, because previous to that he sent all his work to Danton's
  Agency, where she was employed, and the moment she came to us he changed his
  agency.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know anything about her?'</p>

  <p>The woman hesitated.</p>

  <p>'She is an Australian. I believe at one time her family were very wealthy.
  She's never told me anything about her troubles, but I have an idea that she
  will be entitled to a lot of money some day. One of the partners of
  Colgate's, the lawyers, came to see her once.'</p>

  <p>Leon managed to get the girl's address, and then went on to the City to
  find Messrs. Colgate. Luck was with him, for Colgate's had employed the Three
  on several occasions, and at least one of their commissions had been of a
  most delicate character.</p>

  <p>It was one of those old-fashioned firms that had its offices in the region
  of Bedford Row, and though it was generally known as 'Colgate's,' it
  consisted of seven partners, the names of all of whom were inscribed on the
  brass plate before the office.</p>

  <p>Mr. Colgate himself was a man of sixty, and at first rather
  uncommunicative. It was an inspiration for Leon to tell him of what had
  happened the night before. To his amazement, he saw the lawyer's face
  drop.</p>

  <p>'That's very bad,' he said, 'very bad indeed. But I'm afraid I can tell
  you nothing more than you know.'</p>

  <p>'Why is it so very bad?' asked Leon.</p>

  <p>The lawyer pursed his lips thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'You understand that she is not our client, although we represent a firm
  of Melbourne solicitors who are acting for this young lady. Her father died
  in a mental home and left his affairs rather involved. During the past three
  years, however, some of his property has become very valuable, and there is
  no reason why this young lady should work at all, except, as I suspect, that
  she wishes to get away from the scene of this family trouble and has to work
  to occupy her mind. I happen to know that the taint of madness is a cause of
  real distress to the girl, and I believe it was on the advice of her only
  relative that she came to England, in the hope that the change of scene would
  put out of her mind this misfortune which has overshadowed her.'</p>

  <p>'But she has been to see you?'</p>

  <p>The lawyer shook his head.</p>

  <p>'One of my clients called on her. Some property in Sydney which was
  overlooked in the settlement of her father's estate came into the market. He
  had a tenth share, it seems. We tried to get in touch with the executor, Mr.
  Flane, but we were unsuccessful&mdash;he's travelling in the East&mdash;so we
  got the girl's signature to the transfer.'</p>

  <p>'Flane?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Colgate was a busy man; he had intimated as much. He was now a little
  impatient.</p>

  <p>'A cousin of the late Joseph Farrer&mdash;the only other relative. As a
  matter of fact, Farrer was staying in Western Australia on his cousin's
  station just before he went mad.'</p>

  <p>Leon was blessed with an imagination, but even this, vivid as it was,
  could not quite bridge the gaps in what he suspected was an unusual
  story.</p>

  <p>'My own impression,' said the lawyer, 'and I tell you this in the
  strictest confidence, is that the girl is not quite... ' He tapped his
  forehead. 'She told my clerk, a man who is skilled in gaining the confidence
  of young people, that she had been followed about for weeks by a black man,
  on another occasion had been followed about by a black retriever. Apparently,
  whenever she takes her Saturday stroll, this retriever has appeared and never
  leaves her. So far as I can discover, nobody else has seen either the black
  man or the dog. You don't need to be a doctor to know that this delusion of
  being followed is one of the commonest signs of an unbalanced mind.'</p>

  <p>Leon knew something more than the average about police work. He knew that
  discovery is not a thing of a dramatic moment, but patiently accrued
  evidence, and he followed the same line of inquiry that a detective from
  Scotland Yard would follow.</p>

  <p>Eileen Farrer lived in Landsbury Road, Clapham, and No 209 proved to be a
  house in a respectable terrace. The motherly-looking landlady who interviewed
  him in the hall was palpably relieved to see him when he stated the object of
  his visit.</p>

  <p>'I'm so glad you've come,' she said. 'Are you a relation?'</p>

  <p>Leon disclaimed that association.</p>

  <p>'She's a very peculiar young lady,' the landlady went on, 'and I don't
  know what to make of her. She's been up all night walking about her
  room&mdash;she sleeps in the room above me&mdash;and this morning she's taken
  no breakfast. I can't help feeling that there's something wrong&mdash;she's
  so strange.'</p>

  <p>'You mean that she's not quite right in her head?' asked Leon
  brutally.</p>

  <p>'Yes, that's what I mean. I thought of sending for my doctor, but she
  wouldn't hear of it. She told me she'd had a great shock. Do you know
  her?'</p>

  <p>'I've met her,' said Leon. 'May I go upstairs?'</p>

  <p>The landlady hesitated.</p>

  <p>'I think I'd better tell her you're here. What name?'</p>

  <p>'I think it would be better if I saw her without being announced,' said
  Leon, 'if you will show me the door. Where is she?'</p>

  <p>Eileen Farrer was, he learnt, in her sitting-room&mdash;she could afford
  the luxury of an extra apartment Leon tapped at the door and a startled voice
  asked: 'Who is it?'</p>

  <p>He did not answer but, turning the knob, entered the room. The girl was
  standing by the window, staring out; apparently the taxi that brought Leon
  had excited her apprehension.</p>

  <p>'Oh!' she said in dismay, as she saw her visitor. 'You're the man... you
  haven't come to arrest me?'</p>

  <p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw that the floor was strewn with papers.
  Evidently she had bought every available newspaper to discover tidings of the
  crime.</p>

  <p>'No, I haven't come to arrest you,' said Leon in an even tone. 'I don't
  exactly know what you could be arrested for&mdash;Mr. Grasleigh is not dead.
  He's not even hurt.'</p>

  <p>She stared at him, wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>'Not even hurt?' she repeated slowly.</p>

  <p>'He was quite well when I saw him last night.'</p>

  <p>She passed her hand over her eyes.</p>

  <p>'I don't understand. I saw him&mdash;oh, it's terrible!'</p>

  <p>'You saw him, as you thought, very badly hurt. I had the pleasure of
  meeting him a few minutes afterwards and he was quite uninjured; and, what is
  more'&mdash;he was watching her as he spoke&mdash;'he said that he had never
  seen you.'</p>

  <p>Wonder, incredulity, terror were in her eyes.</p>

  <p>'Now won't you sit down, Miss Farrer, and tell me all about yourself. You
  see, I know quite a lot. I know, for example, that your father died in an
  institution.'</p>

  <p>She was staring at him as though unable to grasp his words. Leon became
  instantly practical.</p>

  <p>'Now I want you to tell me. Miss Farrer, why your father went mad. Was
  there any other history of insanity in the family?'</p>

  <p>Leon's calmness was of the dominant kind: under its influence she had
  recovered something of her self-possession.</p>

  <p>'No, the cause was a fall from a horse; the full effect of it wasn't known
  for years afterwards.'</p>

  <p>He nodded and smiled.</p>

  <p>'I thought not. Where were you when he was taken away?'</p>

  <p>'I was at school in Melbourne,' she said, 'or rather, just outside of
  Melbourne. I never saw my father from the time I was seven. He was a long
  time in that horrible place, and they wouldn't let me see him.'</p>

  <p>'Now tell me this: who is Mr. Flane? Do you know him?'</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>'He was my father's cousin. The only thing I know about him is that Daddy
  used to lend him money, and he was staying on the farm when he became ill.
  I've had several letters from him about money. He paid my fare to England. It
  was he who suggested I should go home and try to forget all the troubles I'd
  had.'</p>

  <p>'You never saw him?'</p>

  <p>'Never,' she said. 'He came once to school, but I was away on a
  picnic.'</p>

  <p>'You don't know what money your father left?'</p>

  <p>She shook her head again.</p>

  <p>'No, I've no idea.'</p>

  <p>'Now tell me, Miss Farrer, about the Negro you have seen following you,
  and the dog.'</p>

  <p>She had very little to tell except the bare fact. The persecution had
  begun two years before, and her doctor had once called to inquire the cause.
  Here Leon stopped her quickly.</p>

  <p>'Did you send for the doctor?'</p>

  <p>'No,' she said in surprise, 'but he must have heard from somebody, though
  who I can't think, because I told very few people.'</p>

  <p>'Can you show me any of the letters that Mr. Flane sent you?'</p>

  <p>These she had in a drawer, and Leon examined them carefully. Their tone
  was rather unusual, not the tone one would have expected from a guardian or
  from one who had control of her destinies. In the main they were
  protestations of the difficulties the writer found in providing for her
  schooling, for her clothes, and eventually for the trip to England, and each
  letter insisted on the fact that her father had left very little money.</p>

  <p>'And that was true,' she said. 'Poor Daddy was rather eccentric about
  money. He never kept his stocks at the bank but always carried them about
  with him in a big iron box. In fact, he was terribly secretive, and nobody
  knew exactly what money he had. I thought he was very rich, because he was a
  little'&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;' "near" is the word. I hate saying
  anything disparaging about the poor darling, but he was never generous with
  money, and when I found that he had only left a few hundred pounds and a very
  few shares, and those not of any particular value, I was astonished. And so,
  of course, was everybody in Melbourne&mdash;everybody who knew us, I mean. In
  fact, I always regarded myself as poor until a few months ago. We then
  discovered that father had a large interest in the West Australian Gold Mine,
  which nobody knew anything about. It came to light by accident. If all they
  say is true, I shall be very rich. The lawyers have been trying to get into
  touch with Mr. Flane, but they have only had a letter or two, one posted from
  China addressed to me, and another posted I think in Japan.'</p>

  <p>'Have you got the letter addressed to you?'</p>

  <p>She produced it. It was written on thick paper. Leon held it up to the
  light and saw the watermark.</p>

  <p>'What shares did your father leave? I mean, what shares was he known to
  leave?'</p>

  <p>She puzzled over this question.</p>

  <p>'There were some absolutely valueless, I know. I remember them because of
  the number&mdash;967. What's the matter?'</p>

  <p>Leon was laughing.</p>

  <p>'I think I can promise you freedom from any further persecution, Miss
  Farrer, and my advice to you is that you get immediately in touch with the
  best firm of lawyers in London. I think I can give you their address. There's
  one thing I want to tell you'&mdash;there was a very kindly smile in Leon
  Gonsalez's eyes&mdash;'and it is that you are not mad, that you haven't
  imagined you were followed by Negroes and by black dogs and that you didn't
  imagine you saw Mr. Grasleigh murdered. There's one more question I want to
  ask you, and it's about Mr. Flane. Do you know what he did for a living?'</p>

  <p>'He had a small station&mdash;farm, you would call it,' she said. 'I think
  Daddy bought it for him and his wife. Before that I think he had the lease of
  a theatre in Adelaide, and he lost a lot of money.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' said Leon. That is all I want to know.'</p>

  <p>He drove straight back to the flats in Curzon Street, and met Mr.
  Grasleigh as he was leaving his flat.</p>

  <p>'Hullo! You've not come to tell me about another murder?' said that jovial
  man with a loud laugh.</p>

  <p>'Worse than murder,' said Leon, and something in his tone struck the smile
  from Mr. Grasleigh's lips.</p>

  <p>Leon followed him into the study and himself closed the door.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Flane, I understand?' he said, and saw the colour fade from the man's
  face.</p>

  <p>'I don't know what you mean,' blustered Grasleigh. 'My name is&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Your name is Flane,' said Leon very gently. 'A few years ago you got an
  inkling that the man you had robbed&mdash;Eileen Farrer's father&mdash;was
  richer than you thought, and you evolved a rather clumsy, and certainly a
  diabolical scheme to retain possession of Eileen Farrer's property. A
  shallow-brained man as you are, I have no doubt, would imagine that because
  the father was mad the daughter could also be driven into a mental asylum. I
  don't know where you got your Negro from or where you found your trained dog,
  but I know where you got the money to take the lease of the Orpheum. And, Mr.
  Flane, I want to tell you something more, and you might pass the information
  on to your wife, who is, I gather, a fellow conspirator. "Negotiate" is spelt
  with a "t" and "profession" with an "s". Both words occur in the letters you
  wrote to Miss Farrer.'</p>

  <p>The man was breathing loudly through his nose, and the hand that went up
  to take out the dead stump of his cigar was shaking.</p>

  <p>'You've got to prove all this,' he blustered.</p>

  <p>'Unfortunately I have,' said Leon sadly. 'In the old days when the Four
  Just Men were not quite so legally minded as they are today, you would not
  have been taken into a court of law: I rather imagine that my friends and I
  would have opened a manhole in Curzon Street and dropped you through.'</p>

  <h2><a name="story12"
     id="story12">XII .&mdash; THE MYSTERY OF MR DRAKE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>20 Story Magazine</i>, December 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">ALL events go in threes&mdash;that was the considered
  opinion of Leon Gonsalez. This, for example, was his second meeting with
  Cornelius Malan. The last time Mr. Roos Malan, the bearded brother of
  Cornelius, had been a third party, but now Roos was dead&mdash;though of this
  fact Leon was at the moment unaware.</p>

  <p>This alert and bright-eyed man had never had a driving accident. The fact
  that he was alive proved this, for he was never quite happy if the needle of
  the speedometer on his big sports car fell below the seventy mark. By an odd
  chance it was well below thirty when he skidded on the slush and snow of a
  lonely Oxford road and slithered a back wheel into a four-foot ditch. That
  the car did not overturn was a miracle.</p>

  <p>Leon climbed out and looked round. The squat farmstead beyond the stone
  wall which flanked the road had a familiar appearance. He grinned as he leapt
  the wall and made his way across the rough surface of an uncultivated field
  towards the building. A dog barked gruffly, but he saw no human creature. And
  when he knocked at the door there was no answer. Leon was not surprised.
  Cornelius kept few servants, even in the summer&mdash;he was unlikely to have
  his house well staffed in the unprofitable days of late autumn.</p>

  <p>He made a tour of the house, passed through an untidy and weed-grown
  garden, and still could find no sign of life. And then from the ground, not a
  dozen yards away, arose a big, broad-shouldered giant of a man. He came
  veritably from the ground. For a moment the observer was staggered, and then
  he realized that the man had come out of a well. The back of Cornelius Malan
  was turned to his uninvited guest. Leon saw him stoop, heard the clang of
  steel and the click of a lock fastened. Presently the big man dusted his
  knees and stretched himself and, turning, came straight towards where Leon
  was standing. At the sight of a stranger, the broad, red face of Cornelius
  went a shade redder.</p>

  <p>'Hi, you!' he began wrathfully, and then recognized his visitor. 'Ah!' he
  said. 'The detective!'</p>

  <p>He spoke with scarcely a trace of accent, unlike his dead brother, who
  could hardly speak English.</p>

  <p>'What do you want, eh? Do more people think that poor Roos has swindled
  them? Well, he is dead, so you get nothing out of him.'</p>

  <p>Leon was looking past him, and the man must have divined what was in his
  mind, for he said quickly: 'There is a bad well here, full of gas. I must
  have it filled up&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'In the meantime you've had it sensibly fastened,' smiled Leon. 'I'm sorry
  to barge in upon your Arcadian pursuits, Mr. Malan, but the fact is my car
  has ditched itself, and I wanted help to get it up.'</p>

  <p>There had been a strange look of apprehension on the man's face, and this
  cleared away as Leon explained the object of his visit.</p>

  <p>'I myself could pick a car out of any ditch,' he boasted. 'You shall
  see.'</p>

  <p>As he walked across the field with Leon he was almost affable.</p>

  <p>'I do not like you people from London, and you especially, Mr.
  What's-your-name. You are like the lawyer who swindled me and my poor brother
  by Potchefstroom, so many years ago that I forget his name. Poor Roos! You
  and such people as you have hounded him into his grave! Inspectors of taxes
  and God knows what. And we are both poor men and have nothing to say to
  them.'</p>

  <p>When they got to the car, he found that his strength was hardly
  sufficient, and they returned to the farm and from some mysterious place
  gathered two hungry-looking labourers, who, with planks and ropes, succeeded
  in hauling the Bentley to road level. By this time, Cornelius Malan was his
  old self.</p>

  <p>'That will cost you one pound, my friend,' he said. 'I cannot afford to
  pay these men for extra work. I am poor, and now that Roos is dead, who knows
  that I may not have to take that lazy wench of our sister's...'</p>

  <p>Very solemnly Leon produced a pound note, and handed it to the old
  miser.</p>

  <p>When he got back to Curzon Street he related his experience.</p>

  <p>'I'll bet you we're going to meet for the third time,' he said. 'It is
  odd, but it's a fact. One of these days I am going to write a book on the Law
  of Coincidence&mdash;I've any amount of data.'</p>

  <p>'Add this,' said Poiccart briefly, as he tossed a letter across the
  table.</p>

  <p>Leon smoothed it out: the first thing he read was an Oxfordshire address.
  He turned quickly to the end of the letter, and saw it was signed, 'Leonora
  Malan.'</p>

  <p>Manfred was watching him with a smile in his eyes.</p>

  <p>'There's a job after your own heart, Leon,' he said.</p>

  <p>Leon read the letter.</p>

  <p>'DEAR SIRS,</p>

  <p>'Some time ago you came into town to see my uncle, who has now, I am sorry
  to say, passed over. Will you please grant me an interview on Wednesday
  morning in regard to my late uncle's money? I don't suppose you can help me,
  but there is just a chance.'</p>

  <p>It was signed 'Leonora Malan,' and there was a postscript.</p>

  <p>'Please do not let my Uncle Cornelius know I have written.'</p>

  <p>Leon scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>'Leon and Leonora,' murmured Manfred. 'That alone is sufficient basis for
  a chapter on coincidences.'</p>

  <p>On Wednesday morning, rainy and gusty, Miss Malan called, and with her was
  the young man who was to be the fourth and the greatest coincidence of
  all.</p>

  <p>A scrawny man of thirty, with irregular features and eyes that were never
  still, she introduced him as Mr. Jones, the late manager of her dead
  uncle.</p>

  <p>Leonora Malan was astonishingly pretty. That was the first impression Leon
  had of his visitor. He had expected something dumpy and plain&mdash;Leonora
  was a name to shy at. Malan was obviously Cape Dutch. He would have known
  this even if he had not been aware, from personal experience, of the
  nationality of her two uncles. He had had an encounter with the notorious
  Jappy, and the no less objectionable Roos&mdash;less objectionable now, since
  he had been gathered to his fathers. And he was agreeably surprised, for this
  slim, bright-eyed girl with the peach and rose complexion was a very happy
  upsetting of preconceived ideas.</p>

  <p>She came with him into the bright little drawing-room which was also the
  office of the Three, and sat down in the chair which Poiccart pushed forward
  for her before, in his role of butler, he glided out, closing the door
  respectfully and noiselessly behind him.</p>

  <p>She looked up at Leon, her eyes twinkling, and smiled.</p>

  <p>'You can do nothing for me, Mr. Gonsalez, but Mr. Jones thought I ought to
  see you,' she said, with a trustful glance at her ill-favoured companion
  which appalled Gonsalez. 'That isn't a very promising beginning, is it? I
  suppose you'll wonder why I'm wasting your time if I believe that? But just
  now I'm clutching at straws, and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I am a very substantial straw,' laughed Leon.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jones spoke. His voice was harsh and coarse.</p>

  <p>'It's like this. Leonora is entitled to about eighty thousand pounds. I
  know it was there before the old boy died. Got the will, Leonora?'</p>

  <p>She nodded quickly and sighed, half-opened her little hand-bag, reached
  mechanically for a battered silver case, but quickly withdrew her hand and
  snapped the bag tight. Leon reached for the cigarette box and passed it to
  her.</p>

  <p>'You know my uncle?' she said, as she took a cigarette. 'Poor Uncle Roos
  often spoke about you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Very uncomplimentarily, I am sure,' said Leon.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>'Yes, he didn't like you. He was rather afraid of you, and you cost him
  money.'</p>

  <p>Roos Malan had figured in one of Leon's more humdrum cases. Roos and his
  brother Cornelius had been prosperous farmers in South Africa. And then gold
  was discovered on their farm, and they became, of a sudden, very rich men;
  both came to England and settled on two desolate farms in Oxfordshire. It was
  Roos who had adopted his dead sister's baby with much grumbling and
  complaining for, like his brother, he was that rarest of misers who grudges
  every farthing spent even on himself. Yet both brothers were shrewd
  speculators; too shrewd sometimes. It was a case in which their cupidity had
  overrun their discretion, that had brought Leon into their orbit.</p>

  <p>'Uncle Roos,' said the girl, 'was not so bad as you think. Of course, he
  was terribly mean about money, and even about the food that was eaten on the
  farm; and life was a little difficult with him. Sometimes he was kindness
  itself, and I feel a pig that I am bothering about his wretched money.'</p>

  <p>'Don't worry about him,' began Jones impatiently.</p>

  <p>'You find that there is no wretched money?' interrupted Leon, glancing
  again at the letter she had sent him.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>'I can't understand it,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Show him the will,' Jones snapped.</p>

  <p>She opened her bag again and took out a folded paper.</p>

  <p>'Here is a copy.'</p>

  <p>Leon took the paper and opened it. It was a short, hand-written document
  in Dutch. Beneath was the English translation. In a few lines the late Roos
  Malan had left 'all the property I possess to my niece Leonora Mary
  Malan.'</p>

  <p>'Every penny,' said Jones, with satisfaction that he did not attempt to
  conceal. 'Leonora and I were going into business in London. Her money, my
  brains. See what I mean?'</p>

  <p>Leon saw very clearly.</p>

  <p>'When did he die?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Six months ago.' Leonora frowned as at an unpleasant memory. 'You'll
  think I am heartless, but really I had no love for him, though at times I was
  very fond of him.'</p>

  <p>'And the property?' said Leon.</p>

  <p>She frowned.</p>

  <p>'All that is left seems to be the farm and the furniture. The valuers say
  that it's worth five thousand pounds, and it's mortgaged for four thousand.
  Uncle Cornelius holds the mortgage. Yet Roos Malan must have been very rich;
  he drew royalties from his property in South Africa, and I've seen the money
  in the house; it came every quarter and was always paid in banknotes.'</p>

  <p>'I could explain the mortgage,' said Jones. 'Those two mean old skunks
  exchanged mortgages to protect one another in case the authorities ever tried
  to play tricks on 'em! The money's gone, mister&mdash;I've searched the house
  from top to bottom. There's a strongroom built in a corner of the
  cellar&mdash;we've had that door opened, but there's not a penny to be found.
  They're great for strongrooms, the Malans. I know where Cornelius keeps his
  too. He doesn't know it, but by God, if he doesn't play fair with this kid...
  !'</p>

  <p>The girl seemed a little embarrassed by the championship of the man. The
  friendship was a little one-sided, he thought, and had the impression that
  Mr. Jones' glib plans for 'going into business' were particularly his
  own.</p>

  <p>Jones gave him one piece of news. Neither of the brothers had banking
  accounts. Though they speculated heavily and wisely in South African stocks,
  their dividends were paid or their stock was bought with ready money, and
  invariably cash payments were made in the same medium.</p>

  <p>'Both these old blighters objected to paying taxation, and they used all
  sorts of dirty tricks to avoid payment. They suspected all banks, because
  they believed that banks tell the Government their clients' business.'</p>

  <p>Leonora shook her head again despairingly.</p>

  <p>'I don't think you can do anything, Mr. Gonsalez, and I almost wish I
  hadn't written. The money isn't there; there's no record that it ever was
  there. I really don't mind very much, because I can work. Happily I took
  typing lessons and improved my speed at the farm. I did most of Uncle's
  correspondence.'</p>

  <p>'During the last illness was Cornelius at the farm?'</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>'All the time?'</p>

  <p>She nodded again.</p>

  <p>'And he left&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'Immediately after poor Roos' death. I haven't seen him again, and the
  only communication I've had from him was a letter in which he told me that I
  ought to earn my living and that I couldn't depend on him. Now what can I
  do?'</p>

  <p>Leon considered this problem for a long time.</p>

  <p>'I'll be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Gonsalez,' she went on. 'I am sure
  Uncle Cornelius collected what money there was in the house before he left.
  Mr. Jones thinks that too.'</p>

  <p>'Think it&mdash;I know it!' The hatchet-faced man was very emphatic. 'I
  saw him coming out of the cellar with a big Gladstone bag. Old Roos was in
  the habit of keeping his key of the strongroom under his pillow; when he died
  it wasn't there&mdash;I found it on the kitchen mantelpiece!'</p>

  <p>When the man and the girl were leaving, Leon so manoeuvred the departure
  that she was the last to go.</p>

  <p>'Who is Jones?' he asked, dropping his voice.</p>

  <p>She was a little uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>'He was Uncle's farm manager&mdash;he's been very nice... a little too
  nice.'</p>

  <p>Leon nodded, and as he heard Mr. Jones returning, asked her immediate
  plans. She was, she said, staying the week in London, making preparations to
  earn her own livelihood. After he had taken down her address and seen the
  party to the door, he walked thoughtfully back to the common room where his
  two companions were playing chess&mdash;an immoral occupation for eleven
  o'clock in the forenoon.</p>

  <p>'She is very pretty,' said Poiccart, not looking up from the piece he was
  fingering, 'and she has come about her inheritance. And the man with her is
  no good.'</p>

  <p>'You were listening at the door,' accused Leon.</p>

  <p>'I have read the local newspapers and I know that Mr. Roos Malan died
  penniless&mdash;not sufficient to meet the demands of the Inspector of
  Taxes,' said Poiccart as he checked Manfred's king. 'Both men were terrible
  misers, both are enormously rich, and both men have got Somerset House
  tearing their hair.'</p>

  <p>'And naturally,' George Manfred went on, 'she came to you to recover her
  property. What did the man want?'</p>

  <p>He sat back in his chair and sighed.</p>

  <p>'We're fearfully respectable, aren't we? It was so easy ten, fifteen years
  ago. I know so many ways of making Cornelius disgorge.'</p>

  <p>'And I know one,' interrupted Leon promptly. 'And if all my theories and
  views are correct&mdash;and I cannot imagine them being anything
  else&mdash;Mr. Drake will make the recovery.'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Who?' Poiccart looked up with a heavy frown.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Drake,' said Leon glibly; 'an old enemy of mine. We have been at
  daggers drawn for ten years. He knows one of my most precious secrets, and I
  have lived in mortal terror of him, so much so that I contemplate removing
  him from his present sphere of activity.'</p>

  <p>George looked at him thoughtfully; then a light dawned in his face.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I think I know your mysterious Mr. Drake. We used him before, didn't
  we?'</p>

  <p>'We used him before,' agreed Leon gravely. 'But this time he dies the
  death of a dog!'</p>

  <p>'Who is this Jones?' asked Poiccart. 'I've seen him at the Old
  Bailey&mdash;and he has a Dartmoor manner. You remember, George&mdash;an
  unpleasant case, eight-ten years ago. Not a fit companion for the pretty
  Leonora.'</p>

  <p>Leon's car took him the next morning to a famous market town, ten miles
  from Mr. Malan's farm. Here he sought and had an interview with the local
  inspector of taxes, producing the brief authorization which he had suggested
  Leonora should sign. The harassed official was both willing and anxious to
  give Leon all the information he required.</p>

  <p>'I have the devil of a job with these people. We know their main income,
  which arrives from South Africa every quarter, but they've got a score of
  other South African interests which we're unable to trace. We knew that they
  are in the habit of receiving their money in cash. Both men have obviously
  been cheating the Revenue for years, but we could get no evidence against
  them. If Mr. Malan keeps books, he also keeps them well out of sight! A few
  months ago we put a detective on to watch Cornelius, and we found his hiding
  place. It lies about twenty feet down a half-filled-in well in his
  garden.'</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>'And it's a solid rock chamber approached by a steel door. It sound like a
  fairy tale, doesn't it? It's one of the many in which Charles II was
  reputedly hidden, and the existence of the rock chamber has been known for
  centuries. Cornelius had the steel door fitted, and as the well is right
  under his window and is fastened by an iron trapdoor and is, moreover,
  visible from the road, it's much more secure than any safe he could have in
  his house.'</p>

  <p>'Then why not search the strong-room?' asked Leon.</p>

  <p>The inspector shook his head.</p>

  <p>'We've no authority to do that&mdash;the most difficult thing in the world
  to secure is a search warrant, and our department, unless it institutes
  criminal proceedings, has never applied for such an authority.'</p>

  <p>Leon smiled broadly.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Drake will have to get it for you,' he said cryptically.</p>

  <p>The puzzled official frowned.</p>

  <p>'I don't quite get that.'</p>

  <p>'You will get more than that,' said the mysterious Leon.</p>

  <p>As Leon walked up the muddy cart-track, he became aware of the sound of
  voices, one deep and bellowing, one high and shrill. Their words, incoherent
  in themselves, were indistinguishable. He turned the corner of an untidy
  clump of bushes, and saw the two: Cornelius the giant, and the rat-faced Mr.
  Jones, who was white with passion.</p>

  <p>'I'm going to get you, you damned Dutch thief!' he cried shrilly. 'Robbing
  the orphan&mdash;that's what you're doing. You haven't heard the last of
  me.'</p>

  <p>What Cornelius said was impossible to understand, for in his rage he had
  relapsed into Cape Dutch, which is one of the most expressive mediums of
  vituperation. He caught sight of Leon, and came striding towards him.</p>

  <p>'You're a detective: take that man from here. He's a thief, a gaolbird. My
  brother gave him a job because he could get no other.'</p>

  <p>The thin lips of Mr. Jones curled in a sneer.</p>

  <p>'A hell of a job! A stable to sleep in and stuff to eat that Dartmoor
  would turn up its nose at&mdash;not that I know anything about Dartmoor,' he
  added hastily. 'All that this man says is lies. He's a thief; he took the
  money from old Roos' safe&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And you come and say "Give me ten thousand and I'll tell Leonora not to
  trouble about the rest," eh?' snarled Cornelius.</p>

  <p>Leon knew it was not the moment to tell the story of Mr. Drake. That must
  come later. He made an excuse for his calling and then accompanied the man
  Jones back to the road.</p>

  <p>'Don't you take any notice of what he said, mister, I mean about my trying
  to doublecross Leonora. She's a good girl; she trusts me, she does, and I'm
  going to do the right thing by her... Old Roos led her the life of a
  dog.'</p>

  <p>Leon wondered what kind of life this ex-convict would lead Leonora Malan
  and was quite satisfied that, whatever happened, the girl should be saved
  from such an association.</p>

  <p>'And when he says I was a convict&mdash;' began Jones again.</p>

  <p>'I can save you a lot of trouble,' said Leon. 'I saw you sentenced.'</p>

  <p>He mentioned the offence, and the man went red and then white.</p>

  <p>'Now you can go back to London, and I'm warning you not to go near Miss
  Leonora Malan. If you do, there is going to be trouble.'</p>

  <p>Jones opened his mouth as if to say something, changed his mind and
  lurched up the road. It was later in the evening when Leon returned to tell
  the story of Mr. Drake.</p>

  <p>He reached the farm of Mr. Cornelius Malan at nine o'clock. It was pitch
  dark; rain and sleet were falling, and the house offered no promise that his
  discomfort would be relieved, for not so much as a candle gleam illuminated
  the dark windows. He knocked for some time, but had no reply. Then he heard
  the sound of laboured breathing: somebody was walking towards him in the
  darkness, and he spun round.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Cornelius Malan?' he asked, and heard the man grunt, and then: 'Who
  is it?'</p>

  <p>'An old friend,' said Leon coolly, and though Cornelius could not see his
  face, he must have recognized him.</p>

  <p>'What do you want?' His voice was shrill with anxiety.</p>

  <p>'I want to see you. It's rather an important matter,' said Leon.</p>

  <p>The man pushed past him, unlocked the door and led the way into the
  darkness. Leon waited in the doorway until he saw the yellow flame of a match
  and heard the tinkle of a lamp chimney being lifted.</p>

  <p>The room was big and bare. Only the glow of a wood fire burnt in the
  hearth, yet this apparently was the farmer's livings and sleeping room, for
  his untidy bed was in one corner of the room. In the centre was a bare deal
  table, and on this Leon sat uninvited. The man stood at the far end of the
  table, scowling down at him; his face was pale and haggard. 'What do you
  want?' he asked again.</p>

  <p>'It's about John Drake,' said Leon deliberately. 'He's an old enemy of
  mine; we have chased one another across three continents before now, and
  tonight, for the first time in ten years, we met.'</p>

  <p>The man was puzzled, bewildered. 'What's this to do with me?'</p>

  <p>Leon shrugged. 'Only tonight I killed him.'</p>

  <p>He saw the man's jaw drop. 'Killed him?'&mdash;incredulously.</p>

  <p>Leon nodded. 'I stabbed him with a long knife,' he said, with some relish.
  'You've probably heard about the Three Just Men: they do such things. And
  I've concealed the body on your farm. For the first time in my life I am
  conscious that I have acted unfairly, and it is my intention to give myself
  up to the police.'</p>

  <p>Cornelius looked down at him.</p>

  <p>'On my farm?' he said dully. 'Where did you put the body?'</p>

  <p>Not a muscle of Leon's face moved.</p>

  <p>'I dropped it down the well.'</p>

  <p>'That's a lie!' stormed the other. 'It is impossible that it was you who
  opened the cover!... '</p>

  <p>Leon shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>'That you must tell the police. They at any rate will learn from me that I
  dropped him down that well. At the bottom I found a door which I succeeded in
  opening with a skeleton key, and inside that door is my unhappy victim.'</p>

  <p>Malan's lips were quivering.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he turned and rushed from the room.</p>

  <p>Leon heard the shot and ran through the door into the night... the next
  second he sprawled over the dead body of Cornelius Roos.</p>

  <p>Later, when the police came and forced the cover of the well, they found
  another dead man huddled at the bottom of the well, where Cornelius had
  thrown him.</p>

  <p>'Jones must have been detected in the act of forcing the well, and been
  shot,' said Leon. 'Weird, isn't it... after my yam about having buried a man
  there? I expected no more than that Cornelius would pay up rather than have
  the well searched.'</p>

  <p>'Very weird,' said Manfred drily, 'and the weirdest thing is Jones' real
  name.'</p>

  <p>'What is it?'</p>

  <p>'Drake,' said Manfred. 'The police phoned it through half-an-hour before
  you came in.'</p>

     id="story13">XIII .&mdash; "THE ENGLISHMAN KONNOR"</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>20 Story Magazine</i>, January 1928</h3>

  <p class="first">THE Three Just Men sat longer over dinner than usual.
  Poiccart had been unusually talkative&mdash;and serious.</p>

  <p>'The truth is, my dear George,' he appealed to the silent Manfred, 'we are
  fiddling with things. There are still offences for which the law does not
  touch a man; for which death is the only and logical punishment. We do a
  certain amount of good&mdash;yes. We right certain wrongs&mdash;yes. But
  could not any honest detective agency do as much?'</p>

  <p>'Poiccart is a lawless man,' murmured Leon Gonsalez; 'he is going
  Fantee*&mdash;there is a murderous light in his eyes!'</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* To go native. Cf. 'He was perpetually going Fantee
  among natives...'&mdash;Rudyard Kipling, 'Miss Youghal's Sais', <i>Plain
  Tales from the Hills</i>, 1888.]</p>

  <p>Poiccart smiled good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>'We know this is true, all of us. There are three men I know, every one of
  them worthy of destruction. They have wrecked lives, and are within the pale
  of the law... Now, my view is... '</p>

  <p>They let him talk and talk, and to the eyes of Manfred came a vision of
  Merrell, the Fourth of the Four Just Men&mdash;he who died in Bordeaux and,
  in dying completed his purpose. Some day the story of Merrell the Fourth may
  be told. Manfred remembered a warm, still night, when Poiccart had spoken in
  just this strain. They were younger then: eager for justice, terribly swift
  to strike...</p>

  <p>'We are respectable citizens,' said Leon, getting up, 'and you are trying
  to corrupt us, my friend. I refuse to be corrupted!'</p>

  <p>Poiccart looked up at him from under his heavy eyelids.</p>

  <p>'Who shall be the first to break back to the old way?' he asked
  significantly.</p>

  <p>Leon did not answer.</p>

  <p>This was a month before the appearance of the tablet. It came into the
  possession of the Four in a peculiar way. Poiccart was in Berlin, looking for
  a man who called himself Lefevre. One sunny afternoon, when he was lounging
  through Charlonenburg, he called in at an antique shop to buy some old
  Turkish pottery that was exhibited for sale. Two large blue vases were his
  purchase, and these he had packed and sent to the House with the Silver
  Triangle, in Curzon Street.</p>

  <p>It was Manfred who found the gold badge. He had odd moments of
  domesticity, and one day decided to wash the pottery. There were all sorts of
  oddments at the bottom of the vases: one was stuffed with old pieces of
  Syrian newspaper for half its depth, and it needed a great deal of patience
  and groping with pieces of wire to bring these to light. Nearing the end of
  his task, he heard a metallic tinkle and, as he turned the jar upside down,
  there dropped into the kitchen sink a gold chain bracelet that held an oblong
  gold tablet, inscribed on both sides with minute Arabic writing.</p>

  <p>Now it so happened that Mr. Dorian of the Evening Herald was in the
  kitchen when this interesting find was made, and Mr. Dorian, as everybody
  knows, is the greatest gossip-writer that ever went into Fleet Street. He is
  a youngish man of forty-something who looks twenty-something. You meet him at
  first nights and very select functions, at the unveiling of war
  memorials&mdash;he was a very good artilleryman during the war. Sometimes he
  called and stayed to dinner to talk over the old days on the
  <i>Megaphone</i>, but never before had he made professional profit out of his
  visits. 'Poiccart will be indifferent&mdash;but Leon will be delighted,' said
  Manfred as he examined the bracelet link by link. 'Gold, of course. Leon
  loves mysteries and usually makes his own. This will go into his little story
  box.'</p>

  <p>The little story box was Leon's especial eccentricity. Disdaining safes
  and strong rooms, that battered steel deed-box reposed beneath his bed. It is
  true that it contained nothing of great value intrinsically: a jumble of odds
  and ends, from the torn tickets of bookmakers to two inches of the rope that
  should have hanged Manfred, each inconsiderable object had its attachment in
  the shape of a story.</p>

  <p>The imagination of the journalist was fired. He took the bracelet in his
  hand and examined it.</p>

  <p>'What is it?' he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Manfred was examining the inscription.</p>

  <p>'Leon understands Arabic better than I&mdash;it rather looks like the
  identification disc of a Turkish officer. He must be, or must have been,
  rather an exquisite.'</p>

  <p>'Curious,' mused Dorian aloud. Here in smoky London a jar or vase bought
  in Berlin, and out of it tumbles something of Eastern romance. He asked if he
  might muse in print to the same purpose, and George Manfred had no
  objection.</p>

  <p>Leon came back that evening: he had been asked by the American Government
  to secure exact information about a certain general cargo which was being
  shipped from lighters in the port of London.</p>

  <p>'Certain raw materials,' he reported, 'which could have caused a great
  deal of trouble for our friends in America.'</p>

  <p>Manfred told him of his find.</p>

  <p>'Dorian was here&mdash;I told him he could write about this if he
  liked.'</p>

  <p>'H'm!' said Leon, reading the inscription. 'Did you tell him what this
  writing stood for? But you're not a whale at Arabic, are you? There's one
  word in Roman characters "Konnor"&mdash;did you see that? "Konnor?" Now what
  is "Konnor"?' He looked up at the ceiling. '"The Englishman
  Konnor"&mdash;that was the owner of this interesting exhibit. Konnor? I've
  got it&mdash;"Connor"!'</p>

  <p>The next evening, under 'The Man in Town,' Mr. Dorian's daily column, Leon
  read of the find, and was just a little irritated to discover that the
  thorough Mr. Dorian had referred to the story box. If the truth be told, Leon
  was not proud of this little box of his; it stood for romance and sentiment,
  two qualities which he was pleased to believe were absent from his spiritual
  make-up.</p>

  <p>'George, you're becoming a vulgar publicity agent,' he complained. 'The
  next thing that will happen will be that I shall receive fabulous offers from
  a Sunday newspaper for a series of ten articles on "Stories from my Story
  Box," and if I do I shall sulk for three days.'</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, into the black box went the bracelet. What the writing was
  all about, and where 'the Englishman Konnor' came into it, Leon refused to
  say.</p>

  <p>Yet it was clear to his two companions that Leon was pursuing some new
  inquiry in the days that followed. He haunted Fleet Street and Whitehall, and
  even paid a visit to Dublin. Once Manfred questioned him and Leon smiled
  amiably.</p>

  <p>'The whole thing is rather amusing. Connor isn't even Irish. Probably
  isn't Connor, though it is certain that he bore that name. I found it on the
  roll of a very fine Irish regiment. He is most likely a Levantine. Stewarts,
  the Dublin photographers, have a picture of him in a regimental group. That
  is what I went to Ireland to see. There's a big bookmaker in Dublin who was
  an officer in the same regiment, and he says "Connor" spoke with a foreign
  accent.'</p>

  <p>'But who is Connor?' asked Manfred.</p>

  <p>Leon showed his even white teeth in a grin of delight.</p>

  <p>'He is my story,' was all that he would say.</p>

  <p>Three weeks later Leon Gonsalez found adventure.</p>

  <p>He had something of the qualities of a cat; he slept noiselessly; the
  keenest ear must strain to hear him breathing; he woke noiselessly. He could
  pass from complete oblivion to complete wakefulness in a flash. As a cat
  opens her eyes and is instantly and cold-bloodedly alert, so was Leon.</p>

  <p>He had the rare power of looking back into sleep and rediscovering causes,
  and he knew without remembering that what had wakened him was not the tap-tap
  of the blind cords for, the night being windy, this had been a normal
  accompaniment to sleep, but rather the sound of human movement.</p>

  <p>His room was a large one for so small a house, but there could never be
  enough ventilation for Leon, so that, in addition to windows, the door was
  wedged open... He snuffled picturesquely, like a man in heavy sleep, grumbled
  drowsily, and turned in the bed; but when he had finished turning, his feet
  were on the floor and he was standing upright, tightening the cord of his
  pyjamas.</p>

  <p>Manfred and Poiccart were away for the weekend, and he was alone in the
  house&mdash;a satisfactory state of affairs, since Leon preferred to deal
  with such situations as these single-handed.</p>

  <p>Waiting, his head bent, he heard the sound again. It came at the end of a
  whining gust of wind that should have drowned the noise&mdash;a distinct
  creak. Now the stairs gave seven distinct creakings. This one came from the
  second tread. He lifted his dressing-gown and drew it on as his bare feet
  groped for his slippers. Then he slipped out on to the landing, and switched
  on the light.</p>

  <p>There was a man on the landing; his yellow, uncleanly face was upraised to
  Leon's. Fear, surprise, hateful resentment were there.</p>

  <p>'Keep your hand out of your pocket, or I'll shoot you through the
  stomach,' said Leon calmly. 'It will take you four days to die, and you'll
  regret every minute of it.'</p>

  <p>The second man, half-way up the stairs, stood stock-still, paralysed with
  fright. He was small and slim. Leon waved the barrel of his Browning in his
  direction, and the smaller figure shrank against the wall and screamed.</p>

  <p>Leon smiled. He had not met a lady burglar for years.</p>

  <p>'Turn about, both of you, and walk downstairs,' he ordered; 'don't try to
  run&mdash;that would be fatal.'</p>

  <p>They obeyed him, the man sullenly, the girl, he guessed, rather weak in
  the knees.</p>

  <p>Presently they came to the ground floor.</p>

  <p>'To the left,' said Leon.</p>

  <p>He stepped swiftly up to the man, dropped the Browning against his spine,
  and put his hand into the jacket pocket. He took out a short-barrelled
  revolver, and slipped it into the pocket of his dressing-gown.</p>

  <p>'Through the doorway&mdash;the light switch is on the left, turn it.'
  Following them into the little dining-room, he closed the door behind him.
  'Now sit down&mdash;both of you.'</p>

  <p>The man he could place: a typical prison man; irregular features,
  bad-complexioned: a creature of low mentality, who spent his short periods of
  liberty qualifying for further imprisonment.</p>

  <p>His companion had not spoken, and until she spoke Leon could not place her
  into a category.</p>

  <p>'I'm very sorry&mdash;I am entirely to blame.'</p>

  <p>So she spoke, and Leon was enlightened.</p>

  <p>It was an educated voice&mdash;the voice you might hear in Bond Street
  ordering the chauffeur to drive to the Ritz.</p>

  <p>She was pretty, but then, most women were pretty to Leon; he had that
  amount of charity in his soul. Dark eyes, fine arches of eyebrows, rather
  full, red lips. The nervous fingers that twined in and out of one another
  were white, shapely, rather over-manicured. There was a small purple spot on
  the back of one finger, where a big ring had been.</p>

  <p>'This man is not responsible,' she said, in a low voice. 'I hired him.
  A&mdash;a friend of mine used to help him, and he came to the house one night
  last week; and I asked him to do this for me. That's really true.'</p>

  <p>'Asked him to burgle my house?'</p>

  <p>She nodded. 'I wish you'd let him go&mdash;I could talk to you then... and
  feel more comfortable. It really isn't his fault. I'm entirely to blame.'</p>

  <p>Leon pulled open the drawer of a small writing-table, and took out a sheet
  of paper and an inkpad. He put them on the table before the girl's unshaven
  companion.</p>

  <p>'Put your finger and thumb on the pad&mdash;press 'em.'</p>

  <p>'Whaffor?' The man was husky and suspicious.</p>

  <p>'I want your finger-prints in case I have to come after you. Be
  slippy!'</p>

  <p>Reluctantly, the burglar obeyed&mdash;first one hand and then the other.
  Leon examined the prints on the paper, and was satisfied.</p>

  <p>'Step this way.'</p>

  <p>He pushed his visitor to the street door, opened it, and walked out after
  him.</p>

  <p>'You must not carry a gun,' he said. As he spoke his fist shot up and
  caught the man under the jaw, and the man went sprawling to the ground.</p>

  <p>He got up whimpering.</p>

  <p>'She made me carry it,' he whined.</p>

  <p>'Then she earned you a punch on the jaw,' said Leon brightly, and closed
  the door on one who called himself, rather unimaginatively, 'John Smith.'</p>

  <p>When he returned to the dining-room, the girl had loosened the heavy coat
  she wore, and was sitting back in her chair, rather white of face but
  perfectly calm.</p>

  <p>'Has he gone? I'm so glad! You hit him, didn't you? I thought I heard you.
  What do you think of me?'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't have missed tonight for a thousand pounds!' said Leon, and he
  was telling the truth.</p>

  <p>Only for a fraction of a second did she smile.</p>

  <p>'Why do you think I did this mad, stupid thing?' she asked quietly. Leon
  shook his head.</p>

  <p>'That is exactly what I can't think: we've no very important case on hand;
  the mysterious documents which figure in all sensation stories are entirely
  missing. I can only suppose that we've been rather unkind to some friend of
  yours&mdash;a lover, a father, a brother&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He saw the ghost of a smile appear and disappear.</p>

  <p>'No; it isn't revenge. You've done me no harm, directly or indirectly. And
  there are no secret documents.'</p>

  <p>'Then it's not revenge and it's not robbery; I confess that I am
  beaten!'</p>

  <p>Leon's smile was dazzling, and this time she responded without
  reservation.</p>

  <p>'I suppose I'd better tell you everything,' she said, 'and I'd best start
  by telling you that my name is Lois Martin, my father is Sir Charles Martin,
  the surgeon, and I shall be married in three weeks' time to Major John
  Rutland, of the Cape Police. And that is why I burgled your house.'</p>

  <p>Leon was amused.</p>

  <p>'You were&mdash;er&mdash;looking for a wedding&mdash;present?' he asked,
  mildly sarcastic.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, she nodded.</p>

  <p>'That is just what I came for,' she said. 'I've been very silly. If I'd
  known you better, I should have come to you and asked for it.'</p>

  <p>Her steady eyes were fixed upon Leon.</p>

  <p>'Well?' he asked. 'What is this interesting object?'</p>

  <p>She spoke very slowly.</p>

  <p>'A gold chain bangle, with an identification disc...'</p>

  <p>Leon was not surprised, except that she was speaking the truth. He jotted
  down the names she had given him. A gold bracelet,' he repeated, 'the
  property of&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>'I suppose you've got to know the whole story&mdash;I'm rather in your
  hands.'</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>'Very much in my hands,' he said pleasantly. 'It seems to me that you will
  get less discomfort in telling me now than in explaining the matter to a
  police magistrate.'</p>

  <p>He was geniality itself yet she, womanlike, could detect a hardness in his
  tone that made her shiver a little.</p>

  <p>'Major Rutland knows nothing about my coming here&mdash;he would be
  horrified if he knew I had taken this risk,' she began.</p>

  <p>She told him, haltingly at first, how her older brother had been killed in
  Africa during the War.</p>

  <p>'That's how I come to know Jack,' she said. 'He was in the desert, too. He
  wrote to me two years ago from Paris&mdash;said he had some papers belonging
  to poor Frank. He had taken them from his&mdash;from his body, after he was
  killed. Naturally, Daddy asked him to come over, and we became good friends,
  although Daddy isn't very keen on&mdash;our marriage.'</p>

  <p>She was silent for a little while, and then went on quickly:</p>

  <p>'Father doesn't like the marriage at all, and really the fact that we are
  getting married is a secret. You see, Mr. Gonsalez, I am a comparatively rich
  woman: my mother left me a large sum of money. And John will be rich, too.
  During the War, when he was a prisoner, he located a big gold mine in Syria,
  and that is what the inscription is all about. John saved the life of an
  Arab, and in his gratitude he revealed to him where the mine was located, and
  had it all inscribed on a little gold tablet, in Arabic. John lost it at the
  end of the War, and he'd heard nothing more of it until he read in the
  Evening Herald about your discovery. Poor John was naturally terribly upset
  at the thought that he might be forestalled by somebody who could decipher
  the tablet, so I suggested he should call and see you and ask for the
  bracelet back; but he wouldn't hear of this. Instead, he's been getting more
  and more worried and upset and nervous, and at last I thought of this mad
  scheme. Jack has quite a number of acquaintances amongst the criminal
  classes&mdash;being a police officer he very naturally can deal with them;
  and he's done a lot to help them to keep straight. This man who came tonight
  was one of them. It was I who saw him, and suggested this idea of getting
  into the house and taking the bracelet. We knew that you kept it under your
  bed&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Are you sure it was you and not Major John Rutland who thought out this
  burglary?'</p>

  <p>Again she hesitated.</p>

  <p>'I think he did in fun suggest that the house should be burgled.'</p>

  <p>'And that you should do the burgling?' asked Leon blandly.</p>

  <p>She avoided his eyes.</p>

  <p>'In fun... yes. He said nobody would hurt me, and I could always pretend
  it was a practical joke. It was very stupid, I know, Mr. Gonsalez; if my
  father knew... '</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' said Leon brusquely. 'You needn't tell me any more&mdash;about
  the burglary. How much money have you at the bank?'</p>

  <p>She looked at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>'Nearly forty thousand pounds,' she said. 'I've sold a lot of securities
  lately&mdash;they were not very productive&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Leon smiled.</p>

  <p>'And you've heard of a better investment?'</p>

  <p>She was quick to see what he meant.</p>

  <p>'You're altogether wrong, Mr. Gonsalez,' she said coldly. 'John is only
  allowing me to put a thousand pounds into his exploration syndicate&mdash;he
  isn't quite sure whether it is a thousand or eight hundred he will require.
  He won't let me invest a penny more. He's going to Paris tomorrow night, to
  start these people on their way; and then he is coming back, and we are to be
  married and follow them.'</p>

  <p>Leon looked at her thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'Tomorrow night&mdash;do you mean tonight?'</p>

  <p>She glanced quickly at the clock, and laughed.</p>

  <p>'Of course, tonight.'</p>

  <p>Then she leaned across the table and spoke earnestly.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Gonsalez, I've heard so much about you and your friends, and I'm sure
  you wouldn't betray our secret. If I'd any sense I should have come to you
  yesterday and asked you for the tablet&mdash;I would even pay a good sum to
  relieve John's anxiety. Is it too late now?'</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>'Much too late. I am keeping that as a memento. The enterprising gentleman
  who wrote the paragraph told you that it is part of my story
  collection&mdash;and I never part with stories. By the way, when do you give
  your cheque?'</p>

  <p>Her lips twitched at this.</p>

  <p>'You still think John is a wicked swindler? I gave him the cheque
  yesterday.'</p>

  <p>'A thousand or eight hundred?'</p>

  <p>'That is for him to decide,' she said.</p>

  <p>Leon nodded, and rose.</p>

  <p>'I will not trouble you any further. Burglary, Miss Martin, is evidently
  not your speciality, and I should advise you to avoid that profession in the
  future.'</p>

  <p>'You're not giving me in charge?' she smiled.</p>

  <p>'Not yet,' said Leon.</p>

  <p>He opened the door for her, and stood in his dressing-gown, watching her.
  He saw her cross the road to the taxi rank, and take the last vehicle
  available. Then he bolted the door and went back to bed.</p>

  <p>His alarm clock called him at seven, and he arose cheerfully, having
  before him work which was after his own heart. In the morning he called at a
  tourist agency and bought a ticket to Paris&mdash;it seemed a waste of time
  to go to the office of the High Commissioner for South Africa and examine the
  available records of the Cape Police; but he was a conscientious man. The
  afternoon he spent idling near the Northern and Southern Bank in Threadneedle
  Street, and at a quarter to three his vigil was rewarded, for he saw Major
  John Rutland descend from a cab, go into the bank, and emerge a few minutes
  before the big doors closed. The Major looked very pleased with
  himself&mdash;a handsome fellow, rather slim, with a short-cropped military
  moustache.</p>

  <p>Manfred came back in the afternoon, but Leon told him nothing of the
  burglary. After dinner he went up to his own room, took from a drawer an
  automatic, laid a few spots of oil in the sliding jacket, and loaded it
  carefully. From a small box he took a silencer, which he fixed to the muzzle.
  He put the apparatus into his overcoat pocket, found his suitcase, and came
  downstairs. George was standing in the hallway.</p>

  <p>'Going out, Leon?'</p>

  <p>'I shall be away a couple of days,' said Leon, and Manfred, who never
  asked questions, opened the door for him.</p>

  <p>Leon was hunched up in a corner of a first-class carriage when he saw
  Major Rutland and the girl pass. Behind them, an unwanted third, was a tall,
  thin-faced man with grey hair, obviously the surgeon. Leon saw them from the
  corner of his eye, and as the train pulled out had another glimpse of the
  girl waving her hand to her departing lover.</p>

  <p>It was a dark, gusty night; the weather conditions chalked on a board at
  the railway station promised an unpleasant crossing, and when he stepped on
  to the boat at midnight he found it rolling uneasily, even in the
  comparatively calm waters of the harbour.</p>

  <p>He made a quick scrutiny of the purser's list. Major Rutland had taken a
  cabin and this, after the boat began to move out of harbour, he located. It
  was the aft cabin <i>de luxe</i>&mdash;not a beautiful apartment, for the
  ship was an old one.</p>

  <p>He waited till the assistant purser came along to collect his ticket, and
  then: 'I'm afraid I've lost my ticket,' he said, and paid.</p>

  <p>His ticket from Dover to Calais was in his pocket, but Major Rutland had
  not taken the Calais but the Ostend boat. He watched the assistant purser go
  into the cabin de luxe, and peered through the window. The Major was lying on
  a sofa, his cap pulled down over his eyes.</p>

  <p>After the assistant purser had taken his ticket and departed, Leon waited
  for another half-hour; then he saw the cabin go dark. He wandered round the
  ship: the last light of England showed glitteringly on the south-western
  horizon. There were no passengers on deck: the few that the ship carried had
  gone below, for she was tossing and rolling diabolically. Another quarter of
  an hour passed, and then Leon turned the handle of the stateroom door,
  stepped into the cabin and sent the light of his small torch round the room.
  Evidently the Major was travelling without a great deal of luggage: there
  were two small suitcases and nothing more.</p>

  <p>These Leon took out on to the deck and, walking to the rail, dropped them
  into the water. The man's hat went the same way. He put the torch back into
  his pocket and, returning for the second time to the cabin, gently shook the
  sleeper.</p>

  <p>'I want to speak to you, Konnor,' he said, in a voice little above a
  whisper.</p>

  <p>The man was instantly awake. 'Who are you?'</p>

  <p>'Come outside: I want to talk to you.'</p>

  <p>'Major Rutland' followed on to the dim deck.</p>

  <p>'Where are you going?' he asked.</p>

  <p>The aft of the ship was reserved for second-class passengers, and this,
  too, was deserted. They made their way to the rail above the stern. They were
  in complete darkness.</p>

  <p>'You know who I am?'</p>

  <p>'Haven't the slightest idea,' was the cool reply.</p>

  <p>'My name is Gonsalez. Yours, of course, is Eugene Konnor&mdash;or
  Bergstoft,' said Leon. 'You were at one time an officer in the&mdash;' He
  mentioned the regiment. 'In the desert you went over to the enemy by
  arrangements made through an agency in Cairo. You were reported killed, but
  in reality you were employed by the enemy as a spy. You were responsible for
  the disaster at El Masjid&mdash;don't try to draw that gun or your life will
  be shorter.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said the man, a little breathlessly, 'what do you want?'</p>

  <p>'I want first of all the money you drew from the bank this afternoon. I've
  an idea that Miss Martin gave you a blank cheque, and I've a stronger idea
  that you filled that almost to the limit of her balance, as she will discover
  tomorrow morning.'</p>

  <p>'A hold-up, eh?' Konnor laughed harshly.</p>

  <p>'That money, and quick!' said Leon, between his teeth.</p>

  <p>Konnor felt the point of the gun against his stomach, and obeyed. Leon
  took the thick pad of notes from the man, and slipped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>'I suppose you realize, Mr. Leon Gonsalez, that you're going to get into
  very serious trouble?' began Konnor. 'I thought you'd probably decipher the
  pass&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I deciphered the pass without any trouble at all, if you're referring to
  the gold tablet,' said Leon. 'It said that "the Englishman Konnor is
  permitted to enter our lines at any moment of the day or night and is to be
  afforded every assistance," and it was signed by the Commander of the Third
  Army. Yes, I know all about that.'</p>

  <p>'When I get back to England&mdash;' began the man.</p>

  <p>'You've no intention of going back to England. You're married. You were
  married in Dublin&mdash;and that was probably not your first bigamy. How much
  money is there here?'</p>

  <p>'Thirty or forty thousand&mdash;you needn't think that Miss Martin will
  prosecute me.'</p>

  <p>'Nobody is going to prosecute you,' said Leon, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>He took one quick glance around: the decks were empty.</p>

  <p>'You're a traitor to your country&mdash;if you have a country; a man who
  has sent thousands of the men who were his comrades to their death. That is
  all.'</p>

  <p>There was a flash of fire from his hand, a guttural 'plop!' Konnor's knees
  went under him, but before he reached the ground Leon Gonsalez caught him
  under the arms, threw the pistol into the water, lifted the man without an
  effort and heaved him into the dark sea...</p>

  <p>When Ostend harbour came into sight, and the steward went to collect Major
  Rutland's luggage, he found it had gone, and with it the owner. Passengers
  are very often mean, and carry their own luggage on to the deck in order to
  save porterage. The steward shrugged his shoulders and thought no more of the
  matter.</p>

  <p>As for Leon Gonsalez, he stayed in Brussels one day, posted without
  comment the £34,000 in notes to Miss Lois Martin, caught the train to Calais
  and was back in London that night. Manfred glanced up as his friend strode
  into the dining-room.</p>

  <p>'Had a good time, Leon?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Most interesting,' said Leon.</p>
