The Americanization of Edward Bok
The Autobiography of a Dutch Boy Fifty Years After

<pre class="poem">
To the American woman I owe much, but to two women I owe more,
  My mother and my wife.
And to them I dedicate this account of the boy to whom one gave
birth and brought to manhood and the other blessed with all a
home and family may mean.

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_2">An Explanation</a></h3>
<p>This book was to have been written in 1914, when I foresaw some leisure to
write it, for I then intended to retire from active editorship. But the war
came, an entirely new set of duties commanded, and the project was laid
aside.</p>
<p>Its title and the form, however, were then chosen. By the form I refer
particularly to the use of the third person. I had always felt the most
effective method of writing an autobiography, for the sake of a better
perspective, was mentally to separate the writer from his subject by this
device.</p>
<p>Moreover, this method came to me very naturally in dealing with the Edward
Bok, editor and publicist, whom I have tried to describe in this book, because,
in many respects, he has had and has been a personality apart from my private
self. I have again and again found myself watching with intense amusement and
interest the Edward Bok of this book at work. I have, in turn, applauded him
and criticised him, as I do in this book. Not that I ever considered myself
bigger or broader than this Edward Bok: simply that he was different. His
tastes, his outlook, his manner of looking at things were totally at variance
with my own. In fact, my chief difficulty during Edward Bok's directorship of
The Ladies' Home Journal was to abstain from breaking through the editor and
revealing my real self. Several times I did so, and each time I saw how
different was the effect from that when the editorial Edward Bok had been
allowed sway. Little by little I learned to subordinate myself and to let him
have full rein.</p>
<p>But no relief of my life was so great to me personally as his decision to
retire from his editorship. My family and friends were surprised and amused by
my intense and obvious relief when he did so. Only to those closest to me could
I explain the reason for the sense of absolute freedom and gratitude that I
felt.</p>
<p>Since that time my feelings have been an interesting study to myself. There
are no longer two personalities. The Edward Bok of whom I have written has
passed out of my being as completely as if he had never been there, save for
the records and files on my library shelves. It is easy, therefore, for me to
write of him as a personality apart: in fact, I could not depict him from any
other point of view. To write of him in the first person, as if he were myself,
is impossible, for he is not.</p>
<p>The title suggests my principal reason for writing the book. Every life has
some interest and significance; mine, perhaps, a special one. Here was a little
Dutch boy unceremoniously set down in America unable to make himself understood
or even to know what persons were saying; his education was extremely limited,
practically negligible; and yet, by some curious decree of fate, he was
destined to write, for a period of years, to the largest body of readers ever
addressed by an American editor--the circulation of the magazine he edited
running into figures previously unheard of in periodical literature. He made no
pretense to style or even to composition: his grammar was faulty, as it was
natural it should be, in a language not his own. His roots never went deep, for
the intellectual soil had not been favorable to their growth;--yet, it must be
confessed, he achieved.</p>
<p>But how all this came about, how such a boy, with every disadvantage to
overcome, was able, apparently, to "make good"--this possesses an interest and
for some, perhaps, a value which, after all, is the only reason for any
book.</p>
<p>EDWARD W. BOK<br>
MERION, PENNSYLVANIA, 1920</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_3">An Introduction of Two
Persons</a></h3>
<p>IN WHOSE LIVES ARE FOUND THE SOURCE AND MAINSPRING OF SOME OF THE EFFORTS OF
THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK IN HIS LATER YEARS</p>
<p>Along an island in the North Sea, five miles from the Dutch Coast, stretches
a dangerous ledge of rocks that has proved the graveyard of many a vessel
sailing that turbulent sea. On this island once lived a group of men who, as
each vessel was wrecked, looted the vessel and murdered those of the crew who
reached shore. The government of the Netherlands decided to exterminate the
island pirates, and for the job King William selected a young lawyer at The
Hague.</p>
<p>"I want you to clean up that island," was the royal order. It was a
formidable job for a young man of twenty-odd years. By royal proclamation he
was made mayor of the island, and within a year, a court of law being
established, the young attorney was appointed judge; and in that dual capacity
he "cleaned up" the island.</p>
<p>The young man now decided to settle on the island, and began to look around
for a home. It was a grim place, barren of tree or living green of any kind; it
was as if a man had been exiled to Siberia. Still, argued the young mayor, an
ugly place is ugly only because it is not beautiful. And beautiful he
determined this island should be.</p>
<p>One day the young mayor-judge called together his council. "We must have
trees," he said; "we can make this island a spot of beauty if we will!" But the
practical seafaring men demurred; the little money they had was needed for
matters far more urgent than trees.</p>
<p>"Very well," was the mayor's decision--and little they guessed what the
words were destined to mean--"I will do it myself." And that year he planted
one hundred trees, the first the island had ever seen.</p>
<p>"Too cold," said the islanders; "the severe north winds and storms will kill
them all."</p>
<p>"Then I will plant more," said the unperturbed mayor. And for the fifty
years that he lived on the island he did so. He planted trees each year; and,
moreover, he had deeded to the island government land which he turned into
public squares and parks, and where each spring he set out shrubs and
plants.</p>
<p>Moistened by the salt mist the trees did not wither, but grew prodigiously.
In all that expanse of turbulent sea--and only those who have seen the North
Sea in a storm know how turbulent it can be--there was not a foot of ground on
which the birds, storm-driven across the water-waste, could rest in their
flight. Hundreds of dead birds often covered the surface of the sea. Then one
day the trees had grown tall enough to look over the sea, and, spent and
driven, the first birds came and rested in their leafy shelter. And others came
and found protection, and gave their gratitude vent in song. Within a few years
so many birds had discovered the trees in this new island home that they
attracted the attention not only of the native islanders but also of the people
on the shore five miles distant, and the island became famous as the home of
the rarest and most beautiful birds. So grateful were the birds for their
resting-place that they chose one end of the island as a special spot for the
laying of their eggs and the raising of their young, and they fairly peopled
it. It was not long before ornithologists from various parts of the world came
to "Eggland," as the farthermost point of the island came to be known, to see
the marvellous sight, not of thousands but of hundreds of thousands of
bird-eggs.</p>
<p>A pair of storm-driven nightingales had now found the island and mated
there; their wonderful notes thrilled even the souls of the natives; and as
dusk fell upon the seabound strip of land the women and children would come to
"the square" and listen to the evening notes of the birds of golden song. The
two nightingales soon grew into a colony, and within a few years so rich was
the island in its nightingales that over to the Dutch coast and throughout the
land and into other countries spread the fame of "The Island of
Nightingales."</p>
<p>Meantime, the young mayor-judge, grown to manhood, had kept on planting
trees each year, setting out his shrubbery and plants, until their verdure now
beautifully shaded the quaint, narrow lanes, and transformed into cool wooded
roads what once had been only barren sun-baked wastes. Artists began to hear of
the place and brought their canvases, and on the walls of hundreds of homes
throughout the world hang to-day bits of the beautiful lanes and wooded spots
of "The Island of Nightingales." The American artist William M. Chase took his
pupils there almost annually. "In all the world to-day," he declared to his
students, as they exclaimed at the natural cool restfulness of the island,
"there is no more beautiful place."</p>
<p>The trees are now majestic in their height of forty or more feet, for it is
nearly a hundred years since the young attorney went to the island and planted
the first tree; today the churchyard where he lies is a bower of cool green,
with the trees that he planted dropping their moisture on the lichen-covered
stone on his grave.</p>
<p>This much did one man do. But he did more.</p>
<p>After he had been on the barren island two years he went to the mainland one
day, and brought back with him a bride. It was a bleak place for a bridal home,
but the young wife had the qualities of the husband. "While you raise your
trees," she said, "I will raise our children." And within a score of years the
young bride sent thirteen happy-faced, well-brought-up children over that
island, and there was reared a home such as is given to few. Said a man who
subsequently married a daughter of that home: "It was such a home that once you
had been in it you felt you must be of it, and that if you couldn't marry one
of the daughters you would have been glad to have married the cook."</p>
<p>One day when the children had grown to man's and woman's estate the mother
called them all together and said to them, "I want to tell you the story of
your father and of this island," and she told them the simple story that is
written here.</p>
<p>"And now," she said, "as you go out into the world I want each of you to
take with you the spirit of your father's work, and each in your own way and
place, to do as he has done: make you the world a bit more beautiful and better
because you have been in it. That is your mother's message to you."</p>
<p>The first son to leave the island home went with a band of hardy men to
South Africa, where they settled and became known as "the Boers." Tirelessly
they worked at the colony until towns and cities sprang up and a new nation
came into being: The Transvaal Republic. The son became secretary of state of
the new country, and to-day the United States of South Africa bears tribute, in
part, to the mother's message to "make the world a bit more beautiful and
better."</p>
<p>The second son left home for the Dutch mainland, where he took charge of a
small parish; and when he had finished his work he was mourned by king and
peasant as one of the leading clergymen of his time and people.</p>
<p>A third son, scorning his own safety, plunged into the boiling surf on one
of those nights of terror so common to that coast, rescued a half-dead sailor,
carried him to his father's house, and brought him back to a life of usefulness
that gave the world a record of imperishable value. For the half-drowned sailor
was Heinrich Schliemann, the famous explorer of the dead cities of Troy.</p>
<p>The first daughter now left the island nest; to her inspiration her husband
owed, at his life's close, a shelf of works in philosophy which to-day are
among the standard books of their class.</p>
<p>The second daughter worked beside her husband until she brought him to be
regarded as one of the ablest preachers of his land, speaking for more than
forty years the message of man's betterment.</p>
<p>To another son it was given to sit wisely in the councils of his land;
another followed the footsteps of his father. Another daughter, refusing
marriage for duty, ministered unto and made a home for one whose eyes could see
not.</p>
<p>So they went out into the world, the girls and boys of that island home,
each carrying the story of their father's simple but beautiful work and the
remembrance of their mother's message. Not one from that home but did well his
or her work in the world; some greater, some smaller, but each left behind the
traces of a life well spent.</p>
<p>And, as all good work is immortal, so to-day all over the world goes on the
influence of this one man and one woman, whose life on that little Dutch island
changed its barren rocks to a bower of verdure, a home for the birds and the
song of the nightingale. The grandchildren have gone to the four corners of the
globe, and are now the generation of workers-some in the far East Indies;
others in Africa; still others in our own land of America. But each has tried,
according to the talents given, to carry out the message of that day, to tell
the story of the grandfather's work; just as it is told here by the author of
this book, who, in the efforts of his later years, has tried to carry out, so
far as opportunity has come to him, the message of his grandmother:</p>
<p>"Make you the world a bit more beautiful and better because you have been in
it."</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_4">I. The First Days in
America</a></h3>
<p>The Leviathan of the Atlantic Ocean, in 1870, was The Queen, and when she
was warped into her dock on September 20 of that year, she discharged, among
her passengers, a family of four from the Netherlands who were to make an
experiment of Americanization.</p>
<p>The father, a man bearing one of the most respected names in the
Netherlands, had acquired wealth and position for himself; unwise investments,
however, had swept away his fortune, and in preference to a new start in his
own land, he had decided to make the new beginning in the United States, where
a favorite brother-in-law had gone several years before. But that, never a
simple matter for a man who has reached forty-two, is particularly difficult
for a foreigner in a strange land. This fact he and his wife were to find out.
The wife, also carefully reared, had been accustomed to a scale of living which
she had now to abandon. Her Americanization experiment was to compel her, for
the first time in her life, to become a housekeeper without domestic help.
There were two boys: the elder, William, was eight and a half years of age; the
younger, in nineteen days from his landing-date, was to celebrate his seventh
birthday.</p>
<p>This younger boy was Edward William Bok. He had, according to the Dutch
custom, two other names, but he had decided to leave those in the Netherlands.
And the American public was, in later years, to omit for him the "William."</p>
<p>Edward's first six days in the United States were spent in New York, and
then he was taken to Brooklyn, where he was destined to live for nearly twenty
years.</p>
<p>Thanks to the linguistic sense inherent in the Dutch, and to an educational
system that compels the study of languages, English was already familiar to the
father and mother. But to the two sons, who had barely learned the beginnings
of their native tongue, the English language was as a closed book. It seemed a
cruel decision of the father to put his two boys into a public school in
Brooklyn, but he argued that if they were to become Americans, the sooner they
became part of the life of the country and learned its language for themselves,
the better. And so, without the ability to make known the slightest want or to
understand a single word, the morning after their removal to Brooklyn, the two
boys were taken by their father to a public school.</p>
<p>The American public-school teacher was perhaps even less well equipped in
those days than she is to-day to meet the needs of two Dutch boys who could not
understand a word she said, and who could only wonder what it was all about.
The brothers did not even have the comfort of each other's company, for, graded
by age, they were placed in separate classes.</p>
<p>Nor was the American boy of 1870 a whit less cruel than is the American boy
of 1920; and he was none the less loath to show that cruelty. This trait was
evident at the first recess of the first day at school. At the dismissal, the
brothers naturally sought each other, only to find themselves surrounded by a
group of tormentors who were delighted to have such promising objects for their
fun. And of this opportunity they made the most. There was no form of petty
cruelty boys' minds could devise that was not inflicted upon the two helpless
strangers. Edward seemed to look particularly inviting, and nicknaming him
"Dutchy" they devoted themselves at each noon recess and after school to
inflicting their cruelties upon him.</p>
<p>Louis XIV may have been right when he said that "every new language requires
a new soul," but Edward Bok knew that while spoken languages might differ,
there is one language understood by boys the world over. And with this language
Edward decided to do some experimenting. After a few days at school, he cast
his eyes over the group of his tormentors, picked out one who seemed to him the
ringleader, and before the boy was aware of what had happened, Edward Bok was
in the full swing of his first real experiment with Americanization. Of course
the American boy retaliated. But the boy from the Netherlands had not been born
and brought up in the muscle-building air of the Dutch dikes for nothing, and
after a few moments he found himself looking down on his tormentor and into the
eyes of a crowd of very respectful boys and giggling girls who readily made a
passageway for his brother and himself when they indicated a desire to leave
the schoolyard and go home.</p>
<p>Edward now felt that his Americanization had begun; but, always believing
that a thing begun must be carried to a finish, he took, or gave--it depends
upon the point of view--two or three more lessons in this particular phase of
Americanization before he convinced these American schoolboys that it might be
best for them to call a halt upon further excursions in torment.</p>
<p>At the best, they were difficult days at school for a boy of six without the
language. But the national linguistic gift inherent in the Dutch race came to
the boy's rescue, and as the roots of the Anglo-Saxon lie in the Frisian
tongue, and thus in the language of his native country, Edward soon found that
with a change of vowel here and there the English language was not so difficult
of conquest. At all events, he set out to master it.</p>
<p>But his fatal gift of editing, although its possession was unknown to him,
began to assert itself when, just as he seemed to be getting along fairly well,
he balked at following the Spencerian style of writing in his copybooks.
Instinctively he rebelled at the flourishes which embellished that form of
handwriting. He seemed to divine somehow that such penmanship could not be
useful or practicable for after life, and so, with that Dutch stolidity that,
once fixed, knows no altering, he refused to copy his writing lessons. Of
course trouble immediately ensued between Edward and his teacher. Finding
herself against a literal blank wall--for Edward simply refused, but had not
the gift of English with which to explain his refusal--the teacher decided to
take the matter to the male principal of the school. She explained that she had
kept Edward after school for as long as two hours to compel him to copy his
Spencerian lesson, but that the boy simply sat quiet. He was perfectly
well-behaved, she explained, but as to his lesson, he would attempt absolutely
nothing.</p>
<p>It was the prevailing custom in the public schools of 1870 to punish boys by
making them hold out the palms of their hands, upon which the principal would
inflict blows with a rattan. The first time Edward was punished in this way,
his hand became so swollen he wondered at a system of punishment which rendered
him incapable of writing, particularly as the discerning principal had chosen
the boy's right hand upon which to rain the blows. Edward was told to sit down
at the principal's own desk and copy the lesson. He sat, but he did not write.
He would not for one thing, and he could not if he would. After half an hour of
purposeless sitting, the principal ordered Edward again to stand up and hold
out his hand; and once more the rattan fell in repeated blows. Of course it did
no good, and as it was then five o'clock, and the principal had inflicted all
the punishment that the law allowed, and as he probably wanted to go home as
much as Edward did, he dismissed the sore-handed but more-than-ever-determined
Dutch boy.</p>
<p>Edward went home to his father, exhibited his swollen hand, explained the
reason, and showed the penmanship lesson which he had refused to copy. It is a
singular fact that even at that age he already understood Americanization
enough to realize that to cope successfully with any American institution, one
must be constructive as well as destructive. He went to his room, brought out a
specimen of Italian handwriting which he had seen in a newspaper, and explained
to his father that this simpler penmanship seemed to him better for practical
purposes than the curlicue fancifully embroidered Spencerian style; that if he
had to learn penmanship, why not learn the system that was of more possible use
in after life?</p>
<p>Now, your Dutchman is nothing if not practical. He is very simple and direct
in his nature, and is very likely to be equally so in his mental view. Edward's
father was distinctly interested--very much amused, as he confessed to the boy
in later years--in his son's discernment of the futility of the Spencerian
style of penmanship. He agreed with the boy, and, next morning, accompanied him
to school and to the principal. The two men were closeted together, and when
they came out Edward was sent to his classroom. For some weeks he was given no
penmanship lessons, and then a new copy-book was given him with a much simpler
style. He pounced upon it, and within a short time stood at the head of his
class in writing.</p>
<p>The same instinct that was so often to lead Edward aright in his future
life, at its very beginning served him in a singularly valuable way in
directing his attention to the study of penmanship; for it was through his
legible handwriting that later, in the absence of the typewriter, he was able
to secure and satisfactorily fill three positions which were to lead to his
final success.</p>
<p>Years afterward Edward had the satisfaction of seeing public-school pupils
given a choice of penmanship lessons: one along the flourish lines and the
other of a less ornate order. Of course, the boy never associated the incident
of his refusal with the change until later when his mother explained to him
that the principal of the school, of whom the father had made a warm friend,
was so impressed by the boy's simple but correct view, that he took up the
matter with the board of education, and a choice of systems was considered and
later decided upon.</p>
<p>From this it will be seen that, unconsciously, Edward Bok had started upon
his career of editing!</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_5">II. The First Job: Fifty Cents a
Week</a></h3>
<p>The Elder Bok did not find his "lines cast in pleasant places" in the United
States. He found himself, professionally, unable to adjust the methods of his
own land and of a lifetime to those of a new country. As a result the fortunes
of the transplanted family did not flourish, and Edward soon saw his mother
physically failing under burdens to which her nature was not accustomed nor her
hands trained. Then he and his brother decided to relieve their mother in the
housework by rising early in the morning, building the fire, preparing
breakfast, and washing the dishes before they went to school. After school they
gave up their play hours, and swept and scrubbed, and helped their mother to
prepare the evening meal and wash the dishes afterward. It was a curious
coincidence that it should fall upon Edward thus to get a first-hand knowledge
of woman's housework which was to stand him in such practical stead in later
years.</p>
<p>It was not easy for the parents to see their boys thus forced to do work
which only a short while before had been done by a retinue of servants. And the
capstone of humiliation seemed to be when Edward and his brother, after having
for several mornings found no kindling wood or coal to build the fire, decided
to go out of evenings with a basket and pick up what wood they could find in
neighboring lots, and the bits of coal spilled from the coal-bin of the
grocery-store, or left on the curbs before houses where coal had been
delivered. The mother remonstrated with the boys, although in her heart she
knew that the necessity was upon them. But Edward had been started upon his
Americanization career, and answered: "This is America, where one can do
anything if it is honest. So long as we don't steal the wood or coal, why
shouldn't we get it?" And, turning away, the saddened mother said nothing.</p>
<p>But while the doing of these homely chores was very effective in relieving
the untrained and tired mother, it added little to the family income. Edward
looked about and decided that the time had come for him, young as he was, to
begin some sort of wage-earning. But how and where? The answer he found one
afternoon when standing before the shop-window of a baker in the neighborhood.
The owner of the bakery, who had just placed in the window a series of trays
filled with buns, tarts, and pies, came outside to look at the display. He
found the hungry boy wistfully regarding the tempting-looking wares.</p>
<p>"Look pretty good, don't they?" asked the baker.</p>
<p>"They would," answered the Dutch boy with his national passion for
cleanliness, "if your window were clean."</p>
<p>"That's so, too," mused the baker. "Perhaps you'll clean it."</p>
<p>"I will," was the laconic reply. And Edward Bok, there and then, got his
first job. He went in, found a step-ladder, and put so much Dutch energy into
the cleaning of the large show-window that the baker immediately arranged with
him to clean it every Tuesday and Friday afternoon after school. The salary was
to be fifty cents per week!</p>
<p>But one day, after he had finished cleaning the window, and the baker was
busy in the rear of the store, a customer came in, and Edward ventured to wait
on her. Dexterously he wrapped up for another the fragrant currant-buns for
which his young soul--and stomach--so hungered! The baker watched him, saw how
quickly and smilingly he served the customer, and offered Edward an extra
dollar per week if he would come in afternoons and sell behind the counter. He
immediately entered into the bargain with the understanding that, in addition
to his salary of a dollar and a half per week, he should each afternoon carry
home from the good things unsold a moderate something as a present to his
mother. The baker agreed, and Edward promised to come each afternoon except
Saturday.</p>
<p>"Want to play ball, hey?" said the baker.</p>
<p>"Yes, I want to play ball," replied the boy, but he was not reserving his
Saturday afternoons for games, although, boy-like, that might be his
preference.</p>
<p>Edward now took on for each Saturday morning--when, of course, there was no
school--the delivery route of a weekly paper called the South Brooklyn
Advocate. He had offered to deliver the entire neighborhood edition of the
paper for one dollar, thus increasing his earning capacity to two dollars and a
half per week.</p>
<p>Transportation, in those days in Brooklyn, was by horse-cars, and the
car-line on Smith Street nearest Edward's home ran to Coney Island. Just around
the corner where Edward lived the cars stopped to water the horses on their
long haul. The boy noticed that the men jumped from the open cars in summer,
ran into the cigar-store before which the watering-trough was placed, and got a
drink of water from the ice-cooler placed near the door. But that was not so
easily possible for the women, and they, especially the children, were forced
to take the long ride without a drink. It was this that he had in mind when he
reserved his Saturday afternoon to "play ball."</p>
<p>Here was an opening, and Edward decided to fill it. He bought a shining new
pail, screwed three hooks on the edge from which he hung three clean shimmering
glasses, and one Saturday afternoon when a car stopped the boy leaped on,
tactfully asked the conductor if he did not want a drink, and then proceeded to
sell his water, cooled with ice, at a cent a glass to the passengers. A little
experience showed that he exhausted a pail with every two cars, and each pail
netted him thirty cents. Of course Sunday was a most profitable day; and after
going to Sunday-school in the morning, he did a further Sabbath service for the
rest of the day by refreshing tired mothers and thirsty children on the Coney
Island cars--at a penny a glass!</p>
<p>But the profit of six dollars which Edward was now reaping in his newly
found "bonanza" on Saturday and Sunday afternoons became apparent to other
boys, and one Saturday the young ice-water boy found that he had a competitor;
then two and soon three. Edward immediately met the challenge; he squeezed half
a dozen lemons into each pail of water, added some sugar, tripled his charge,
and continued his monopoly by selling "Lemonade, three cents a glass." Soon
more passengers were asking for lemonade than for plain drinking-water!</p>
<p>One evening Edward went to a party of young people, and his latent
journalistic sense whispered to him that his young hostess might like to see
her social affair in print. He went home, wrote up the party, being careful to
include the name of every boy and girl present, and next morning took the
account to the city editor of the Brooklyn Eagle, with the sage observation
that every name mentioned in that paragraph represented a buyer of the paper,
who would like to see his or her name in print, and that if the editor had
enough of these reports he might very advantageously strengthen the circulation
of The Eagle. The editor was not slow to see the point, and offered Edward
three dollars a column for such reports. On his way home, Edward calculated how
many parties he would have to attend a week to furnish a column, and decided
that he would organize a corps of private reporters himself. Forthwith, he saw
every girl and boy he knew, got each to promise to write for him an account of
each party he or she attended or gave, and laid great stress on a full recital
of names. Within a few weeks, Edward was turning in to The Eagle from two to
three columns a week; his pay was raised to four dollars a column; the editor
was pleased in having started a department that no other paper carried, and the
"among those present" at the parties all bought the paper and were immensely
gratified to see their names.</p>
<p>So everybody was happy, and Edward Bok, as a full-fledged reporter, had
begun his journalistic career.</p>
<p>It is curious how deeply embedded in his nature, even in his earliest years,
was the inclination toward the publishing business. The word "curious" is used
here because Edward is the first journalist in the Bok family in all the
centuries through which it extends in Dutch history. On his father's side,
there was a succession of jurists. On the mother's side, not a journalist is
visible.</p>
<p>Edward attended the Sunday-school of the Carroll Park Methodist Episcopal
Church, in Brooklyn, of which a Mr. Elkins was superintendent. One day he
learned that Mr. Elkins was associated with the publishing house of Harper and
Brothers. Edward had heard his father speak of Harper's Weekly and of the great
part it had played in the Civil War; his father also brought home an occasional
copy of Harper's Weekly and of Harper's Magazine. He had seen Harper's Young
People; the name of Harper and Brothers was on some of his school-books; and he
pictured in his mind how wonderful it must be for a man to be associated with
publishers of periodicals that other people read, and books that other folks
studied. The Sunday-school superintendent henceforth became a figure of
importance in Edward's eyes; many a morning the boy hastened from home long
before the hour for school, and seated himself on the steps of the Elkins house
under the pretext of waiting for Mr. Elkins's son to go to school, but really
for the secret purpose of seeing Mr. Elkins set forth to engage in the
momentous business of making books and periodicals. Edward would look after the
superintendent's form until it was lost to view; then, with a sigh, he would go
to school, forgetting all about the Elkins boy whom he had told the father he
had come to call for!</p>
<p>One day Edward was introduced to a girl whose father, he learned, was editor
of the New York Weekly. Edward could not quite place this periodical; he had
never seen it, he had never heard of it. So he bought a copy, and while its
contents seemed strange, and its air unfamiliar in comparison with the
magazines he found in his home, still an editor was an editor. He was certainly
well worth knowing. So he sought his newly made young lady friend, asked
permission to call upon her, and to Edward's joy was introduced to her father.
It was enough for Edward to look furtively at the editor upon his first call,
and being encouraged to come again, he promptly did so the next evening. The
daughter has long since passed away, and so it cannot hurt her feelings now to
acknowledge that for years Edward paid court to her only that he might know her
father, and have those talks with him about editorial methods that filled him
with ever-increasing ambition to tread the path that leads to editorial
tribulations.</p>
<p>But what with helping his mother, tending the baker's shop in after-school
hours, serving his paper route, plying his street-car trade, and acting as
social reporter, it soon became evident to Edward that he had not much time to
prepare his school lessons. By a supreme effort, he managed to hold his own in
his class, but no more. Instinctively, he felt that he was not getting all that
he might from his educational opportunities, yet the need for him to add to the
family income was, if anything, becoming greater. The idea of leaving school
was broached to his mother, but she rebelled. She told the boy that he was
earning something now and helping much. Perhaps the tide with the father would
turn and he would find the place to which his unquestioned talents entitled
him. Finally the father did. He associated himself with the Western Union
Telegraph Company as translator, a position for which his easy command of
languages admirably fitted him. Thus, for a time, the strain upon the family
exchequer was lessened.</p>
<p>But the American spirit of initiative had entered deep into the soul of
Edward Bok. The brother had left school a year before, and found a place as
messenger in a lawyer's office; and when one evening Edward heard his father
say that the office boy in his department had left, he asked that he be allowed
to leave school, apply for the open position, and get the rest of his education
in the great world itself. It was not easy for the parents to see the younger
son leave school at so early an age, but the earnestness of the boy
prevailed.</p>
<p>And so, at the age of thirteen, Edward Bok left school, and on Monday,
August 7, 1876, he became office boy in the electricians' department of the
Western Union Telegraph Company at six dollars and twenty-five cents per
week.</p>
<p>And, as such things will fall out in this curiously strange world, it
happened that as Edward drew up his chair for the first time to his desk to
begin his work on that Monday morning, there had been born in Boston, exactly
twelve hours before, a girl-baby who was destined to become his wife. Thus at
the earliest possible moment after her birth, Edward Bok started to work for
her!</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_6">III. The Hunger for
Self-Education</a></h3>
<p>With school-days ended, the question of self-education became an absorbing
thought with Edward Bok. He had mastered a schoolboy's English, but seven years
of public-school education was hardly a basis on which to build the work of a
lifetime. He saw each day in his duties as office boy some of the foremost men
of the time. It was the period of William H. Vanderbilt's ascendancy in Western
Union control; and the railroad millionnaire and his companions, Hamilton McK.
Twombly, James H. Banker, Samuel F. Barger, Alonzo B. Cornell, Augustus Schell,
William Orton, were objects of great interest to the young office boy.
Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas A. Edison were also constant visitors to the
department. He knew that some of these men, too, had been deprived of the
advantage of collegiate training, and yet they had risen to the top. But how?
The boy decided to read about these men and others, and find out. He could not,
however, afford the separate biographies, so he went to the libraries to find a
compendium that would authoritatively tell him of all successful men. He found
it in Appleton's Encyclopedia, and, determining to have only the best, he saved
his luncheon money, walked instead of riding the five miles to his Brooklyn
home, and, after a period of saving, had his reward in the first purchase from
his own earnings: a set of the Encyclopedia. He now read about all the
successful men, and was encouraged to find that in many cases their beginnings
had been as modest as his own, and their opportunities of education as
limited.</p>
<p>One day it occurred to him to test the accuracy of the biographies he was
reading. James A. Garfield was then spoken of for the presidency; Edward
wondered whether it was true that the man who was likely to be President of the
United States had once been a boy on the tow-path, and with a simple directness
characteristic of his Dutch training, wrote to General Garfield, asking whether
the boyhood episode was true, and explaining why he asked. Of course any public
man, no matter how large his correspondence, is pleased to receive an earnest
letter from an information-seeking boy. General Garfield answered warmly and
fully. Edward showed the letter to his father, who told the boy that it was
valuable and he should keep it. This was a new idea. He followed it further: if
one such letter was valuable, how much more valuable would be a hundred! If
General Garfield answered him, would not other famous men? Why not begin a
collection of autograph letters? Everybody collected something.</p>
<p>Edward had collected postage-stamps, and the hobby had, incidentally, helped
him wonderfully in his study of geography. Why should not autograph letters
from famous persons be of equal service in his struggle for self-education? Not
simple autographs--they were meaningless; but actual letters which might tell
him something useful. It never occurred to the boy that these men might not
answer him.</p>
<p>So he took his Encyclopedia--its trustworthiness now established in his mind
by General Garfield's letter--and began to study the lives of successful men
and women. Then, with boyish frankness, he wrote on some mooted question in one
famous person's life; he asked about the date of some important event in
another's, not given in the Encyclopedia; or he asked one man why he did this
or why some other man did that.</p>
<p>Most interesting were, of course, the replies. Thus General Grant sketched
on an improvised map the exact spot where General Lee surrendered to him;
Longfellow told him how he came to write "Excelsior"; Whittier told the story
of "The Barefoot Boy"; Tennyson wrote out a stanza or two of "The Brook," upon
condition that Edward would not again use the word "awful," which the poet said
"is slang for 'very,'" and "I hate slang."</p>
<p>One day the boy received a letter from the Confederate general Jubal A.
Early, giving the real reason why he burned Chambersburg. A friend visiting
Edward's father, happening to see the letter, recognized in it a
hitherto-missing bit of history, and suggested that it be published in the New
York Tribune. The letter attracted wide attention and provoked national
discussion.</p>
<p>This suggested to the editor of The Tribune that Edward might have other
equally interesting letters; so he despatched a reporter to the boy's home.
This reporter was Ripley Hitchcock, who afterward became literary adviser for
the Appletons and Harpers. Of course Hitchcock at once saw a "story" in the
boy's letters, and within a few days The Tribune appeared with a long article
on its principal news page giving an account of the Brooklyn boy's remarkable
letters and how he had secured them. The Brooklyn Eagle quickly followed with a
request for an interview; the Boston Globe followed suit; the Philadelphia
Public Ledger sent its New York correspondent; and before Edward was aware of
it, newspapers in different parts of the country were writing about "the
well-known Brooklyn autograph collector."</p>
<p>Edward Bok was quick to see the value of the publicity which had so suddenly
come to him. He received letters from other autograph collectors all over the
country who sought to "exchange" with him. References began to creep into
letters from famous persons to whom he had written, saying they had read about
his wonderful collection and were proud to be included in it. George W. Childs,
of Philadelphia, himself the possessor of probably one of the finest
collections of autograph letters in the country, asked Edward to come to
Philadelphia and bring his collection with him--which he did, on the following
Sunday, and brought it back greatly enriched.</p>
<p>Several of the writers felt an interest in a boy who frankly told them that
he wanted to educate himself, and asked Edward to come and see them.
Accordingly, when they lived in New York or Brooklyn, or came to these cities
on a visit, he was quick to avail himself of their invitations. He began to
note each day in the newspapers the "distinguished arrivals" at the New York
hotels; and when any one with whom he had corresponded arrived, Edward would,
after business hours, go up-town, pay his respects, and thank him in person for
his letters. No person was too high for Edward's boyish approach; President
Garfield, General Grant, General Sherman, President Hayes--all were called
upon, and all received the boy graciously and were interested in the problem of
his self-education. It was a veritable case of making friends on every hand;
friends who were to be of the greatest help and value to the boy in his
after-years, although he had no conception of it at the time.</p>
<p>The Fifth Avenue Hotel, in those days the stopping-place of the majority of
the famous men and women visiting New York, represented to the young boy who
came to see these celebrities the very pinnacle of opulence. Often while
waiting to be received by some dignitary, he wondered how one could acquire
enough means to live at a place of such luxury. The main dining-room, to the
boy's mind, was an object of special interest. He would purposely sneak
up-stairs and sit on one of the soft sofas in the foyer simply to see the
well-dressed diners go in and come out. Edward would speculate on whether the
time would ever come when he could dine in that wonderful room just once!</p>
<p>One evening he called, after the close of business, upon General and Mrs.
Grant, whom he had met before, and who had expressed a desire to see his
collection. It can readily be imagined what a red-letter day it made in the
boy's life to have General Grant say: "It might be better for us all to go down
to dinner first and see the collection afterward." Edward had purposely killed
time between five and seven o'clock, thinking that the general's dinner-hour,
like his own, was at six. He had allowed an hour for the general to eat his
dinner, only to find that he was still to begin it. The boy could hardly
believe his ears, and unable to find his voice, he failed to apologize for his
modest suit or his general after-business appearance.</p>
<p>As in a dream he went down in the elevator with his host and hostess, and
when the party of three faced toward the dining-room entrance, so familiar to
the boy, he felt as if his legs must give way under him. There have since been
other red-letter days in Edward Bok's life, but the moment that still stands
out preeminent is that when two colored head waiters at the dining-room
entrance, whom he had so often watched, bowed low and escorted the party to
their table. At last, he was in that sumptuous dining-hall. The entire room
took on the picture of one great eye, and that eye centred on the party of
three--as, in fact, it naturally would. But Edward felt that the eye was on
him, wondering why he should be there.</p>
<p>What he ate and what he said he does not recall. General Grant, not a
voluble talker himself, gently drew the boy out, and Mrs. Grant seconded him,
until toward the close of the dinner he heard himself talking. He remembers
that he heard his voice, but what that voice said is all dim to him. One act
stamped itself on his mind. The dinner ended with a wonderful dish of nuts and
raisins, and just before the party rose from the table Mrs. Grant asked the
waiter to bring her a paper bag. Into this she emptied the entire dish, and at
the close of the evening she gave it to Edward "to eat on the way home." It was
a wonderful evening, afterward up-stairs, General Grant smoking the inevitable
cigar, and telling stories as he read the letters of different celebrities.
Over those of Confederate generals he grew reminiscent; and when he came to a
letter from General Sherman, Edward remembers that he chuckled audibly, reread
it, and then turning to Mrs. Grant, said: "Julia, listen to this from Sherman.
Not bad." The letter he read was this:</p>
<p>"Dear Mr. Bok:--</p>
<p>"I prefer not to make scraps of sentimental writing. When I write anything I
want it to be real and connected in form, as, for instance, in your quotation
from Lord Lytton's play of 'Richelieu,' 'The pen is mightier than the sword.'
Lord Lytton would never have put his signature to so naked a sentiment. Surely
I will not.</p>
<p>"In the text there was a prefix or qualification:</p>
<pre class="poem">
  "Beneath the rule of men entirely great
  The pen is mightier than the sword.
</pre>
<p>"Now, this world does not often present the condition of facts herein
described. Men entirely great are very rare indeed, and even Washington, who
approached greatness as near as any mortal, found good use for the sword and
the pen, each in its proper sphere.</p>
<p>"You and I have seen the day when a great and good man ruled this country
(Lincoln) who wielded a powerful and prolific pen, and yet had to call to his
assistance a million of flaming swords.</p>
<p>"No, I cannot subscribe to your sentiment, 'The pen is mightier than the
sword,' which you ask me to write, because it is not true.</p>
<p>"Rather, in the providence of God, there is a time for all things; a time
when the sword may cut the Gordian knot, and set free the principles of right
and justice, bound up in the meshes of hatred, revenge, and tyranny, that the
pens of mighty men like Clay, Webster, Crittenden, and Lincoln were unable to
disentangle.</p>
<p>"Wishing you all success, I am, with respect, your friend,</p>
<p>"W. T. Sherman."</p>
<p>Mrs. Grant had asked Edward to send her a photograph of himself, and after
one had been taken, the boy took it to the Fifth Avenue Hotel, intending to ask
the clerk to send it to her room. Instead, he met General and Mrs. Grant just
coming from the elevator, going out to dinner. The boy told them his errand,
and said he would have the photograph sent up-stairs.</p>
<p>"I am so sorry we are just going out to dinner," said Mrs. Grant, "for the
general had some excellent photographs just taken of himself, and he signed one
for you, and put it aside, intending to send it to you when yours came." Then,
turning to the general, she said: "Ulysses, send up for it. We have a few
moments."</p>
<p>"I'll go and get it. I know just where it is," returned the general. "Let me
have yours," he said, turning to Edward. "I am glad to exchange photographs
with you, boy."</p>
<p>To Edward's surprise, when the general returned he brought with him, not a
duplicate of the small carte-de-visite size which he had given the general--all
that he could afford--but a large, full cabinet size.</p>
<p>"They make 'em too big," said the general, as he handed it to Edward.</p>
<p>But the boy didn't think so!</p>
<p>That evening was one that the boy was long to remember. It suddenly came to
him that he had read a few days before of Mrs. Abraham Lincoln's arrival in New
York at Doctor Holbrook's sanitarium. Thither Edward went; and within half an
hour from the time he had been talking with General Grant he was sitting at the
bedside of Mrs. Lincoln, showing her the wonderful photograph just presented to
him. Edward saw that the widow of the great Lincoln did not mentally respond to
his pleasure in his possession. It was apparent even to the boy that mental and
physical illness had done their work with the frail frame. But he had the
memory, at least, of having got that close to the great President.</p>
<pre class="poem">
  Mrs. Abraham Lincoln, October 13th 1881
</pre>
<p>The eventful evening, however, was not yet over. Edward had boarded a
Broadway stage to take him to his Brooklyn home when, glancing at the newspaper
of a man sitting next to him, he saw the headline: "Jefferson Davis arrives in
New York." He read enough to see that the Confederate President was stopping at
the Metropolitan Hotel, in lower Broadway, and as he looked out of the
stage-window the sign "Metropolitan Hotel" stared him in the face. In a moment
he was out of the stage; he wrote a little note, asked the clerk to send it to
Mr. Davis, and within five minutes was talking to the Confederate President and
telling of his remarkable evening.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis was keenly interested in the coincidence and in the boy before
him. He asked about the famous collection, and promised to secure for Edward a
letter written by each member of the Confederate Cabinet. This he subsequently
did. Edward remained with Mr. Davis until ten o'clock, and that evening brought
about an interchange of letters between the Brooklyn boy and Mr. Davis at
Beauvoir, Mississippi, that lasted until the latter passed away.</p>
<p>Edward was fast absorbing a tremendous quantity of biographical information
about the most famous men and women of his time, and he was compiling a
collection of autograph letters that the newspapers had made famous throughout
the country. He was ruminating over his possessions one day, and wondering to
what practical use he could put his collection; for while it was proving
educative to a wonderful degree, it was, after all, a hobby, and a hobby means
expense. His autograph quest cost him stationery, postage, car-fare--all outgo.
But it had brought him no income, save a rich mental revenue. And the boy and
his family needed money. He did not know, then, the value of a background.</p>
<p>He was thinking along this line in a restaurant when a man sitting next to
him opened a box of cigarettes, and taking a picture out of it threw it on the
floor. Edward picked it up, thinking it might be a "prospect" for his
collection of autograph letters. It was the picture of a well-known actress. He
then recalled an advertisement announcing that this particular brand of
cigarettes contained, in each package, a lithographed portrait of some famous
actor or actress, and that if the purchaser would collect these he would, in
the end, have a valuable album of the greatest actors and actresses of the day.
Edward turned the picture over, only to find a blank reverse side. "All very
well," he thought, "but what does a purchaser have, after all, in the end, but
a lot of pictures? Why don't they use the back of each picture, and tell what
each did: a little biography? Then it would be worth keeping." With his passion
for self-education, the idea appealed very strongly to him; and believing
firmly that there were others possessed of the same thirst, he set out the next
day, in his luncheon hour, to find out who made the picture.</p>
<p>At the office of the cigarette company he learned that the making of the
pictures was in the hands of the Knapp Lithographic Company. The following
luncheon hour, Edward sought the offices of the company, and explained his idea
to Mr. Joseph P. Knapp, now the president of the American Lithograph
Company.</p>
<p>"I'll give you ten dollars apiece if you will write me a one-hundred-word
biography of one hundred famous Americans," was Mr. Knapp's instant reply.
"Send me a list, and group them, as, for instance: presidents and
vice-presidents, famous soldiers, actors, authors, etc."</p>
<p>"And thus," says Mr. Knapp, as he tells the tale today, "I gave Edward Bok
his first literary commission, and started him off on his literary career."</p>
<p>And it is true.</p>
<p>But Edward soon found the Lithograph Company calling for "copy," and, write
as he might, he could not supply the biographies fast enough. He, at last,
completed the first hundred, and so instantaneous was their success that Mr.
Knapp called for a second hundred, and then for a third. Finding that one hand
was not equal to the task, Edward offered his brother five dollars for each
biography; he made the same offer to one or two journalists whom he knew and
whose accuracy he could trust; and he was speedily convinced that merely to
edit biographies written by others, at one-half the price paid to him, was more
profitable than to write himself.</p>
<p>So with five journalists working at top speed to supply the hungry
lithograph presses, Mr. Knapp was likewise responsible for Edward Bok's first
adventure as an editor. It was commercial, if you will, but it was a commercial
editing that had a distinct educational value to a large public.</p>
<p>The important point is that Edward Bok was being led more and more to
writing and to editorship.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_7">IV. A Presidential Friend and a
Boston Pilgrimage</a></h3>
<p>Edward Bok had not been office boy long before he realized that if he
learned shorthand he would stand a better chance for advancement. So he joined
the Young Men's Christian Association in Brooklyn, and entered the class in
stenography. But as this class met only twice a week, Edward, impatient to
learn the art of "pothooks" as quickly as possible, supplemented this
instruction by a course given on two other evenings at moderate cost by a
Brooklyn business college. As the system taught in both classes was the same,
more rapid progress was possible, and the two teachers were constantly
surprised that he acquired the art so much more quickly than the other
students.</p>
<p>Before many weeks Edward could "stenograph" fairly well, and as the
typewriter had not then come into its own, he was ready to put his knowledge to
practical use.</p>
<p>An opportunity offered itself when the city editor of the Brooklyn Eagle
asked him to report two speeches at a New England Society dinner. The speakers
were to be the President of the United States, General Grant, General Sherman,
Mr. Evarts, and General Sheridan. Edward was to report what General Grant and
the President said, and was instructed to give the President's speech
verbatim.</p>
<p>At the close of the dinner, the reporters came in and Edward was seated
directly in front of the President. In those days when a public dinner included
several kinds of wine, it was the custom to serve the reporters with wine, and
as the glasses were placed before Edward's plate he realized that he had to
make a decision then and there. He had, of course, constantly seen wine on his
father's table, as is the European custom, but the boy had never tasted it. He
decided he would not begin then, when he needed a clear head. So, in order to
get more room for his note-book, he asked the waiter to remove the glasses.</p>
<p>It was the first time he had ever attempted to report a public address.
General Grant's remarks were few, as usual, and as he spoke slowly, he gave the
young reporter no trouble. But alas for his stenographic knowledge, when
President Hayes began to speak! Edward worked hard, but the President was too
rapid for him; he did not get the speech, and he noticed that the reporters for
the other papers fared no better. Nothing daunted, however, after the
speechmaking, Edward resolutely sought the President, and as the latter turned
to him, he told him his plight, explained it was his first important
"assignment," and asked if he could possibly be given a copy of the speech so
that he could "beat" the other papers.</p>
<p>The President looked at him curiously for a moment, and then said: "Can you
wait a few minutes?"</p>
<p>Edward assured him that he could.</p>
<p>After fifteen minutes or so the President came up to where the boy was
waiting, and said abruptly:</p>
<p>"Tell me, my boy, why did you have the wine-glasses removed from your
place?"</p>
<p>Edward was completely taken aback at the question, but he explained his
resolution as well as he could.</p>
<p>"Did you make that decision this evening?" the President asked.</p>
<p>He had.</p>
<p>"What is your name?" the President next inquired.</p>
<p>He was told.</p>
<p>"And you live, where?"</p>
<p>Edward told him.</p>
<p>"Suppose you write your name and address on this card for me," said the
President, reaching for one of the place-cards on the table.</p>
<p>The boy did so.</p>
<p>"Now, I am stopping with Mr. A. A. Low, on Columbia Heights. Is that in the
direction of your home?"</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>"Suppose you go with me, then, in my carriage," said the President, "and I
will give you my speech."</p>
<p>Edward was not quite sure now whether he was on his head or his feet.</p>
<p>As he drove along with the President and his host, the President asked the
boy about himself, what he was doing, etc. On arriving at Mr. Low's house, the
President went up-stairs, and in a few moments came down with his speech in
full, written in his own hand. Edward assured him he would copy it, and return
the manuscript in the morning.</p>
<p>The President took out his watch. It was then after midnight. Musing a
moment, he said: "You say you are an office boy; what time must you be at your
office?"</p>
<p>"Half past eight, sir."</p>
<p>"Well, good night," he said, and then, as if it were a second thought: "By
the way, I can get another copy of the speech. Just turn that in as it is, if
they can read it."</p>
<p>Afterward, Edward found out that, as a matter of fact, it was the
President's only copy. Though the boy did not then appreciate this act of
consideration, his instinct fortunately led him to copy the speech and leave
the original at the President's stopping-place in the morning.</p>
<p>And for all his trouble, the young reporter was amply repaid by seeing that
The Eagle was the only paper which had a verbatim report of the President's
speech.</p>
<p>But the day was not yet done!</p>
<p>That evening, upon reaching home, what was the boy's astonishment to find
the following note:</p>
<p>MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND:--</p>
<p>I have been telling Mrs. Hayes this morning of what you told me at the
dinner last evening, and she was very much interested. She would like to see
you, and joins me in asking if you will call upon us this evening at
eight-thirty.</p>
<p>Very faithfully yours,</p>
<p>RUTHERFORD B. HAYES.</p>
<p>Edward had not risen to the possession of a suit of evening clothes, and
distinctly felt its lack for this occasion. But, dressed in the best he had, he
set out, at eight o'clock, to call on the President of the United States and
his wife!</p>
<p>He had no sooner handed his card to the butler than that dignitary, looking
at it, announced: "The President and Mrs. Hayes are waiting for you!" The ring
of those magic words still sounds in Edward's ears: "The President and Mrs.
Hayes are waiting for you!"--and he a boy of sixteen!</p>
<p>Edward had not been in the room ten minutes before he was made to feel as
thoroughly at ease as if he were sitting in his own home before an open fire
with his father and mother. Skilfully the President drew from him the story of
his youthful hopes and ambitions, and before the boy knew it he was telling the
President and his wife all about his precious Encyclopedia, his evening with
General Grant, and his efforts to become something more than an office boy. No
boy had ever so gracious a listener before; no mother could have been more
tenderly motherly than the woman who sat opposite him and seemed so honestly
interested in all that he told. Not for a moment during all those two hours was
he allowed to remember that his host and hostess were the President of the
United States and the first lady of the land!</p>
<p>That evening was the first of many thus spent as the years rolled by;
unexpected little courtesies came from the White House, and later from "Spiegel
Grove"; a constant and unflagging interest followed each undertaking on which
the boy embarked. Opportunities were opened to him; acquaintances were made
possible; a letter came almost every month until that last little note, late in
1892.</p>
<pre class="poem">
  My Dear Friend:
 
  I would write you more fully
  if I could. You are always thoughtful
  kind.
 
  Thankfully your friend
  Rutherford B. Hayes
 
  Thanks--Thanks for your steady friendship.
</pre>
<p>The simple act of turning down his wine-glasses had won for Edward Bok two
gracious friends.</p>
<p>The passion for autograph collecting was now leading Edward to read the
authors whom he read about. He had become attached to the works of the New
England group: Longfellow, Holmes, and, particularly, of Emerson. The
philosophy of the Concord sage made a peculiarly strong appeal to the young
mind, and a small copy of Emerson's essays was always in Edward's pocket on his
long stage or horse-car rides to his office and back.</p>
<p>He noticed that these New England authors rarely visited New York, or, if
they did, their presence was not heralded by the newspapers among the
"distinguished arrivals." He had a great desire personally to meet these
writers; and, having saved a little money, he decided to take his week's summer
vacation in the winter, when he knew he should be more likely to find the
people of his quest at home, and to spend his savings on a trip to Boston. He
had never been away from home, so this trip was a momentous affair.</p>
<p>He arrived in Boston on Sunday evening; and the first thing he did was to
despatch a note, by messenger, to Doctor Oliver Wendell Holmes, announcing the
important fact that he was there, and what his errand was, and asking whether
he might come up and see Doctor Holmes any time the next day. Edward naively
told him that he could come as early as Doctor Holmes liked--by breakfast-time,
he was assured, as Edward was all alone! Doctor Holmes's amusement at this
ingenuous note may be imagined.</p>
<p>Within the hour the boy brought back this answer:</p>
<pre class="poem">
  MY DEAR BOY:
 
  I shall certainly look for you to-morrow morning at eight
  o'clock to have a piece of pie with me. That is real New
  England, you know.
 
  Very cordially yours,
 
  OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES."
</pre>
<p>Edward was there at eight o'clock. Strictly speaking, he was there at
seven-thirty, and found the author already at his desk in that room overlooking
the Charles River, which he learned in after years to know better.</p>
<p>"Well," was the cheery greeting, "you couldn't wait until eight for your
breakfast, could you? Neither could I when I was a boy. I used to have my
breakfast at seven," and then telling the boy all about his boyhood, the cheery
poet led him to the dining-room, and for the first time he breakfasted away
from home and ate pie--and that with "The Autocrat" at his own
breakfast-table!</p>
<p>A cosier time no boy could have had. Just the two were there, and the
smiling face that looked out over the plates and cups gave the boy courage to
tell all that this trip was going to mean to him.</p>
<p>"And you have come on just to see us, have you?" chuckled the poet. "Now,
tell me, what good do you think you will get out of it?"</p>
<p>He was told what the idea was: that every successful man had something to
tell a boy, that would be likely to help him, and that Edward wanted to see the
men who had written the books that people enjoyed. Doctor Holmes could not
conceal his amusement at all this.</p>
<p>When breakfast was finished, Doctor Holmes said: "Do you know that I am a
full-fledged carpenter? No? Well, I am. Come into my carpenter-shop."</p>
<p>And he led the way into a front-basement room where was a complete
carpenter's outfit.</p>
<p>"You know I am a doctor," he explained, "and this shop is my medicine. I
believe that every man must have a hobby that is as different from his regular
work as it is possible to be. It is not good for a man to work all the time at
one thing. So this is my hobby. This is my change. I like to putter away at
these things. Every day I try to come down here for an hour or so. It rests me
because it gives my mind a complete change. For, whether you believe it or
not," he added with his inimitable chuckle, "to make a poem and to make a chair
are two very different things."</p>
<p>"Now," he continued, "if you think you can learn something from me, learn
that and remember it when you are a man. Don't keep always at your business,
whatever it may be. It makes no difference how much you like it. The more you
like it, the more dangerous it is. When you grow up you will understand what I
mean by an 'outlet'--a hobby, that is--in your life, and it must be so
different from your regular work that it will take your thoughts into an
entirely different direction. We doctors call it a safety-valve, and it is. I
would much rather," concluded the poet, "you would forget all that I have ever
written than that you should forget what I tell you about having a
safety-valve."</p>
<p>"And now do you know," smilingly said the poet, "about the Charles River
here?" as they returned to his study and stood before the large bay window. "I
love this river," he said. "Yes, I love it," he repeated; "love it in summer or
in winter." And then he was quiet for a minute or so.</p>
<p>Edward asked him which of his poems were his favorites.</p>
<p>"Well," he said musingly, "I think 'The Chambered Nautilus' is my most
finished piece of work, and I suppose it is my favorite. But there are also
'The Voiceless,' 'My Aviary,' written at this window, 'The Battle of Bunker
Hill,' and 'Dorothy Q,' written to the portrait of my great-grandmother which
you see on the wall there. All these I have a liking for, and when I speak of
the poems I like best there are two others that ought to be included--'The
Silent Melody' and 'The Last Leaf.' I think these are among my best."</p>
<p>"What is the history of 'The Chambered Nautilus'?" Edward asked.</p>
<p>"It has none," came the reply, "it wrote itself. So, too, did 'The One-Hoss
Shay.' That was one of those random conceptions that gallop through the brain,
and that you catch by the bridle. I caught it and reined it. That is all."</p>
<p>Just then a maid brought in a parcel, and as Doctor Holmes opened it on his
desk he smiled over at the boy and said:</p>
<p>"Well, I declare, if you haven't come just at the right time. See those
little books? Aren't they wee?" and he handed the boy a set of three little
books, six inches by four in size, beautifully bound in half levant. They were
his "Autocrat" in one volume, and his better-known poems in two volumes.</p>
<p>"This is a little fancy of mine," he said. "My publishers, to please me,
have gotten out this tiny wee set. And here," as he counted the little sets,
"they have sent me six sets. Are they not exquisite little things?" and he
fondled them with loving glee. "Lucky, too, for me that they should happen to
come now, for I have been wondering what I could give you as a souvenir of your
visit to me, and here it is, sure enough! My publishers must have guessed you
were here and my mind at the same time. Now, if you would like it, you shall
carry home one of these little sets, and I'll just write a piece from one of my
poems and your name on the fly-leaf of each volume. You say you like that
little verse:</p>
<p>"'A few can touch the magic string.'</p>
<p>Then I'll write those four lines in this volume." And he did.</p>
<p>As each little volume went under the poet's pen Edward said, as his heart
swelled in gratitude:</p>
<p>"Doctor Holmes, you are a man of the rarest sort to be so good to a
boy."</p>
<pre class="poem">
  A few can touch the magic string.
  And noisy fame is proud to win them, --
  Alas for those who never sing.
  But die with all their music in them!
  Oliver Wendell Holmes
</pre>
<p>The pen stopped, the poet looked out on the Charles a moment, and then,
turning to the boy with a little moisture in his eye, he said:</p>
<p>"No, my boy, I am not; but it does an old man's heart good to hear you say
it. It means much to those on the down-hill side to be well thought of by the
young who are coming up."</p>
<p>As he wiped his gold pen, with its swan-quill holder, and laid it down, he
said:</p>
<p>"That's the pen with which I wrote 'Elsie Venner' and the 'Autocrat' papers.
I try to take care of it."</p>
<p>"You say you are going from me over to see Longfellow?" he continued, as he
reached out once more for the pen. "Well, then, would you mind if I gave you a
letter for him? I have something to send him."</p>
<p>Sly but kindly old gentleman! The "something" he had to send Longfellow was
Edward himself, although the boy did not see through the subterfuge at that
time.</p>
<p>"And now, if you are going, I'll walk along with you if you don't mind, for
I'm going down to Park Street to thank my publishers for these little books,
and that lies along your way to the Cambridge car."</p>
<p>As the two walked along Beacon Street, Doctor Holmes pointed out the
residences where lived people of interest, and when they reached the Public
Garden he said:</p>
<p>"You must come over in the spring some time, and see the tulips and croci
and hyacinths here. They are so beautiful.</p>
<p>"Now, here is your car," he said as he hailed a coming horse-car. "Before
you go back you must come and see me and tell me all the people you have seen;
will you? I should like to hear about them. I may not have more books coming
in, but I might have a very good-looking photograph of a very old-looking
little man," he said as his eyes twinkled. "Give my love to Longfellow when you
see him, and don't forget to give him my letter, you know. It is about a very
important matter."</p>
<p>And when the boy had ridden a mile or so with his fare in his hand he held
it out to the conductor, who grinned and said:</p>
<p>"That's all right. Doctor Holmes paid me your fare, and I'm going to keep
that nickel if I lose my job for it."</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_8">V. Going to the Theatre with
Longfellow</a></h3>
<p>When Edward Bok stood before the home of Longfellow, he realized that he was
to see the man around whose head the boy's youthful reading had cast a sort of
halo. And when he saw the head itself he had a feeling that he could see the
halo. No kindlier pair of eyes ever looked at a boy, as, with a smile, "the
white Mr. Longfellow," as Mr. Howells had called him, held out his hand.</p>
<p>"I am very glad to see you, my boy," were his first words, and with them he
won the boy. Edward smiled back at the poet, and immediately the two were
friends.</p>
<p>"I have been taking a walk this beautiful morning," he said next, "and am a
little late getting at my mail. Suppose you come in and sit at my desk with me,
and we will see what the postman has brought. He brings me so many good things,
you know."</p>
<p>"Now, here is a little girl," he said, as he sat down at the desk with the
boy beside him, "who wants my autograph and a 'sentiment.' What sentiment, I
wonder, shall I send her?"</p>
<p>"Why not send her 'Let us, then, be up and doing'?" suggested the boy.
"That's what I should like if I were she."</p>
<p>"Should you, indeed?" said Longfellow. "That is a good suggestion. Now,
suppose you recite it off to me, so that I shall not have to look it up in my
books, and I will write as you recite. But slowly; you know I am an old man,
and write slowly."</p>
<p>Edward thought it strange that Longfellow himself should not know his own
great words without looking them up. But he recited the four lines, so familiar
to every schoolboy, and when the poet had finished writing them, he said:</p>
<p>"Good! I see you have a memory. Now, suppose I copy these lines once more
for the little girl, and give you this copy? Then you can say, you know, that
you dictated my own poetry to me."</p>
<p>Of course Edward was delighted, and Longfellow gave him the sheet as it is
here:</p>
<p align="right">Let us, then, be up and doing, with a heart for any fate,
Still achieving, still pursuing, Learn to labor and to wait. Henry W.
Longfellow</p>
<p>Then, as the fine head bent down to copy the lines once more, Edward
ventured to say to him:</p>
<p>"I should think it would keep you busy if you did this for every one who
asked you."</p>
<p>"Well," said the poet, "you see, I am not so busy a man as I was some years
ago, and I shouldn't like to disappoint a little girl; should you?"</p>
<p>As he took up his letters again, he discovered five more requests for his
autograph. At each one he reached into a drawer in his desk, took a card, and
wrote his name on it.</p>
<p>"There are a good many of these every day," said Longfellow, "but I always
like to do this little favor. It is so little to do, to write your name on a
card; and if I didn't do it some boy or girl might be looking, day by day, for
the postman and be disappointed. I only wish I could write my name better for
them. You see how I break my letters? That's because I never took pains with my
writing when I was a boy. I don't think I should get a high mark for penmanship
if I were at school, do you?"</p>
<p>"I see you get letters from Europe," said the boy, as Longfellow opened an
envelope with a foreign stamp on it.</p>
<p>"Yes, from all over the world," said the poet. Then, looking at the boy
quickly, he said: "Do you collect postage-stamps?"</p>
<p>Edward said he did.</p>
<p>"Well, I have some right here, then," and going to a drawer in a desk he
took out a bundle of letters, and cut out the postage-stamps and gave them to
the boy.</p>
<p>"There's one from the Netherlands. There's where I was born," Edward
ventured to say.</p>
<p>"In the Netherlands? Then you are a real Dutchman. Well! Well!" he said,
laying down his pen. "Can you read Dutch?"</p>
<p>The boy said he could.</p>
<p>"Then," said the poet, "you are just the boy I am looking for." And going to
a bookcase behind him he brought out a book, and handing it to the boy, he
said, his eyes laughing: "Can you read that?"</p>
<p>It was an edition of Longfellow's poems in Dutch.</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed," said Edward. "These are your poems in Dutch."</p>
<p>"That's right," he said. "Now, this is delightful. I am so glad you came. I
received this book last week, and although I have been in the Netherlands, I
cannot speak or read Dutch. I wonder whether you would read a poem to me and
let me hear how it sounds."</p>
<p>So Edward took "The Old Clock on the Stairs," and read it to him.</p>
<p>The poet's face beamed with delight. "That's beautiful," he said, and then
quickly added: "I mean the language, not the poem."</p>
<p>"Now," he went on, "I'll tell you what we'll do: we'll strike a bargain. We
Yankees are great for bargains, you know. If you will read me 'The Village
Blacksmith' you can sit in that chair there made out of the wood of the old
spreading chestnut-tree, and I'll take you out and show you where the old shop
stood. Is that a bargain?"</p>
<p>Edward assured him it was. He sat in the chair of wood and leather, and read
to the poet several of his own poems in a language in which, when he wrote
them, he never dreamed they would ever be printed. He was very quiet. Finally
he said: "It seems so odd, so very odd, to hear something you know so well
sound so strange."</p>
<p>"It's a great compliment, though, isn't it, sir?" asked the boy.</p>
<p>"Ye-es," said the poet slowly. "Yes, yes," he added quickly. "It is, my boy,
a very great compliment."</p>
<p>"Ah," he said, rousing himself, as a maid appeared, "that means luncheon, or
rather," he added, "it means dinner, for we have dinner in the old New England
fashion, in the middle of the day. I am all alone today, and you must keep me
company; will you? Then afterward we'll go and take a walk, and I'll show you
Cambridge. It is such a beautiful old town, even more beautiful, I sometimes
think, when the leaves are off the trees.</p>
<p>"Come," he said, "I'll take you up-stairs, and you can wash your hands in
the room where George Washington slept. And comb your hair, too, if you want
to," he added; "only it isn't the same comb that he used."</p>
<p>To the boyish mind it was an historic breaking of bread, that midday meal
with Longfellow.</p>
<p>"Can you say grace in Dutch?" he asked, as they sat down; and the boy
did.</p>
<p>"Well," the poet declared, "I never expected to hear that at my table. I
like the sound of it."</p>
<p>Then while the boy told all that he knew about the Netherlands, the poet
told the boy all about his poems. Edward said he liked "Hiawatha."</p>
<p>"So do I," he said. "But I think I like 'Evangeline' better. Still," he
added, "neither one is as good as it should be. But those are the things you
see afterward so much better than you do at the time."</p>
<p>It was a great event for Edward when, with the poet nodding and smiling to
every boy and man he met, and lifting his hat to every woman and little girl,
he walked through the fine old streets of Cambridge with Longfellow. At one
point of the walk they came to a theatrical bill-board announcing an attraction
that evening at the Boston Theatre. Skilfully the old poet drew out from Edward
that sometimes he went to the theatre with his parents. As they returned to the
gate of "Craigie House" Edward said he thought he would go back to Boston.</p>
<p>"And what have you on hand for this evening?" asked Longfellow.</p>
<p>Edward told him he was going to his hotel to think over the day's
events.</p>
<p>The poet laughed and said:</p>
<p>"Now, listen to my plan. Boston is strange to you. Now we're going to the
theatre this evening, and my plan is that you come in now, have a little supper
with us, and then go with us to see the play. It is a funny play, and a good
laugh will do you more good than to sit in a hotel all by yourself. Now, what
do you think?"</p>
<p>Of course the boy thought as Longfellow did, and it was a very happy boy
that evening who, in full view of the large audience in the immense theatre,
sat in that box. It was, as Longfellow had said, a play of laughter, and just
who laughed louder, the poet or the boy, neither ever knew.</p>
<p>Between the acts there came into the box a man of courtly presence,
dignified and yet gently courteous.</p>
<p>"Ah! Phillips," said the poet, "how are you? You must know my young friend
here. This is Wendell Phillips, my boy. Here is a young man who told me to-day
that he was going to call on you and on Phillips Brooks to-morrow. Now you know
him before he comes to you."</p>
<p>"I shall be glad to see you, my boy," said Mr. Phillips. "And so you are
going to see Phillips Brooks? Let me tell you something about Brooks. He has a
great many books in his library which are full of his marks and comments. Now,
when you go to see him you ask him to let you see some of those books, and
then, when he isn't looking, you put a couple of them in your pocket. They
would make splendid souvenirs, and he has so many he would never miss them. You
do it, and then when you come to see me tell me all about it."</p>
<p>And he and Longfellow smiled broadly.</p>
<p>An hour later, when Longfellow dropped Edward at his hotel, he had not only
a wonderful day to think over but another wonderful day to look forward to as
well!</p>
<p>He had breakfasted with Oliver Wendell Holmes; dined, supped, and been to
the theatre with Longfellow; and to-morrow he was to spend with Phillips
Brooks.</p>
<p>Boston was a great place, Edward Bok thought, as he fell asleep.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_9">VI. Phillips Brooks's Books and
Emerson's Mental Mist</a></h3>
<p>No one who called at Phillips Brooks's house was ever told that the master
of the house was out when he was in. That was a rule laid down by Doctor
Brooks: a maid was not to perjure herself for her master's comfort or
convenience. Therefore, when Edward was told that Doctor Brooks was out, he
knew he was out. The boy waited, and as he waited he had a chance to look
around the library and into the books. The rector's faithful housekeeper said
he might when he repeated what Wendell Phillips had told him of the interest
that was to be found in her master's books. Edward did not tell her of Mr.
Phillips's advice to "borrow" a couple of books. He reserved that bit of
information for the rector of Trinity when he came in, an hour later.</p>
<p>"Oh! did he?" laughingly said Doctor Brooks. "That is nice advice for a man
to give a boy. I am surprised at Wendell Phillips. He needs a little talk: a
ministerial visit. And have you followed his shameless advice?" smilingly asked
the huge man as he towered above the boy. "No? And to think of the opportunity
you had, too. Well, I am glad you had such respect for my dumb friends. For
they are my friends, each one of them," he continued, as he looked fondly at
the filled shelves. "Yes, I know them all, and love each for its own sake. Take
this little volume," and he picked up a little volume of Shakespeare. "Why, we
are the best of friends: we have travelled miles together--all over the world,
as a matter of fact. It knows me in all my moods, and responds to each, no
matter how irritable I am. Yes, it is pretty badly marked up now, for a fact,
isn't it? Black; I never thought of that before that it doesn't make a book
look any better to the eye. But it means more to me because of all that
pencilling.</p>
<p>"Now, some folks dislike my use of my books in this way. They love their
books so much that they think it nothing short of sacrilege to mark up a book.
But to me that's like having a child so prettily dressed that you can't romp
and play with it. What is the good of a book, I say, if it is too pretty for
use? I like to have my books speak to me, and then I like to talk back to
them.</p>
<p>"Take my Bible, here," he continued, as he took up an old and much-worn copy
of the book. "I have a number of copies of the Great Book: one copy I preach
from; another I minister from; but this is my own personal copy, and into it I
talk and talk. See how I talk," and he opened the Book and showed interleaved
pages full of comments in his handwriting. "There's where St. Paul and I had an
argument one day. Yes, it was a long argument, and I don't know now who won,"
he added smilingly. "But then, no one ever wins in an argument, anyway; do you
think so?</p>
<p>"You see," went on the preacher, "I put into these books what other men put
into articles and essays for magazines and papers. I never write for
publications. I always think of my church when something comes to me to say.
There is always danger of a man spreading himself out thin if he attempts too
much, you know."</p>
<p>Doctor Brooks must have caught the boy's eye, which, as he said this,
naturally surveyed his great frame, for he regarded him in an amused way, and
putting his hands on his girth, he said laughingly: "You are thinking I would
have to do a great deal to spread myself out thin, aren't you?"</p>
<p>The boy confessed he was, and the preacher laughed one of those deep laughs
of his that were so infectious.</p>
<p>"But here I am talking about myself. Tell me something about yourself?"</p>
<p>And when the boy told his object in coming to Boston, the rector of Trinity
Church was immensely amused.</p>
<p>"Just to see us fellows! Well, and how do you like us so far?"</p>
<p>And is the most comfortable way this true gentleman went on until the boy
mentioned that he must be keeping him from his work.</p>
<p>"Not at all; not at all," was the quick and hearty response. "Not a thing to
do. I cleaned up all my mail before I had my breakfast this morning.</p>
<p>"These letters, you mean?" he said, as the boy pointed to some letters on
his desk unopened. "Oh, yes! Well, they must have come in a later mail. Well,
if it will make you feel any better I'll go through them, and you can go
through my books if you like. I'll trust you," he added laughingly, as Wendell
Phillips's advice occurred to him.</p>
<p>"You like books, you say?" he went on, as he opened his letters. "Well,
then, you must come into my library here at any time you are in Boston, and
spend a morning reading anything I have that you like. Young men do that, you
know, and I like to have them. What's the use of good friends if you don't
share them? There's where the pleasure comes in."</p>
<p>He asked the boy then about his newspaper work: how much it paid him, and
whether he felt it helped him in an educational way. The boy told him he
thought it did; that it furnished good lessons in the study of human
nature.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, "I can believe that, so long as it is good journalism."</p>
<p>Edward told him that he sometimes wrote for the Sunday paper, and asked the
preacher what he thought of that.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, "that is not a crime."</p>
<p>The boy asked him if he, then, favored the Sunday paper more than did some
other clergymen.</p>
<p>"There is always good in everything, I think," replied Phillips Brooks. "A
thing must be pretty bad that hasn't some good in it." Then he stopped, and
after a moment went on: "My idea is that the fate of Sunday newspapers rests
very much with Sunday editors. There is a Sunday newspaper conceivable in which
we should all rejoice--all, that is, who do not hold that a Sunday newspaper is
always and per se wrong. But some cause has, in many instances, brought it
about that the Sunday paper is below, and not above, the standard of its
weekday brethren. I mean it is apt to be more gossipy, more personal, more
sensational, more frivolous; less serious and thoughtful and suggestive. Taking
for granted the fact of special leisure on the part of its readers, it is apt
to appeal to the lower and not to the higher part of them, which the Sunday
leisure has set free. Let the Sunday newspaper be worthy of the day, and the
day will not reject it. So I say its fate is in the hands of its editor. He can
give it such a character as will make all good men its champions and friends,
or he can preserve for it the suspicion and dislike in which it stands at
present."</p>
<p>Edward's journalistic instinct here got into full play; and although, as he
assured his host, he had had no such thought in coming, he asked whether Doctor
Brooks would object if he tried his reportorial wings by experimenting as to
whether he could report the talk.</p>
<p>"I do not like the papers to talk about me," was the answer; "but if it will
help you, go ahead and practise on me. You haven't stolen my books when you
were told to do so, and I don't think you'll steal my name."</p>
<p>The boy went back to his hotel, and wrote an article much as this account is
here written, which he sent to Doctor Brooks. "Let me keep it by me," the
doctor wrote, "and I will return it to you presently."</p>
<p>And he did, with his comment on the Sunday newspaper, just as it is given
here, and with this note:</p>
<pre class="poem">
  If I must go into the
  newspapers at all--which
  I should always vastly
  prefer to avoid--no words could
  have been more kind than
  those of your article. You
  were very good to send it
  to me. I am ever
  Sincerely, Your friend,
  Phillips Brooks
</pre>
<p>As he let the boy out of his house, at the end of that first meeting, he
said to him:</p>
<p>"And you're going from me now to see Emerson? I don't know," he added
reflectively, "whether you will see him at his best. Still, you may. And even
if you do not, to have seen him, even as you may see him, is better, in a way,
than not to have seen him at all."</p>
<p>Edward did not know what Phillips Brooks meant. But he was, sadly, to find
out the next day.</p>
<p>A boy of sixteen was pretty sure of a welcome from Louisa Alcott, and his
greeting from her was spontaneous and sincere.</p>
<p>"Why, you good boy," she said, "to come all the way to Concord to see us,"
quite for all the world as if she were the one favored. "Now take your coat
off, and come right in by the fire."</p>
<p>"Do tell me all about your visit," she continued.</p>
<p>Before that cozey fire they chatted. It was pleasant to the boy to sit there
with that sweet-faced woman with those kindly eyes! After a while she said:
"Now I shall put on my coat and hat, and we shall walk over to Emerson's house.
I am almost afraid to promise that you will see him. He sees scarcely any one
now. He is feeble, and--" She did not finish the sentence. "But we'll walk over
there, at any rate."</p>
<p>She spoke mostly of her father as the two walked along, and it was easy to
see that his condition was now the one thought of her life. Presently they
reached Emerson's house, and Miss Emerson welcomed them at the door. After a
brief chat Miss Alcott told of the boy's hope. Miss Emerson shook her head.</p>
<p>"Father sees no one now," she said, "and I fear it might not be a pleasure
if you did see him."</p>
<p>Then Edward told her what Phillips Brooks had said.</p>
<p>"Well," she said, "I'll see."</p>
<p>She had scarcely left the room when Miss Alcott rose and followed her,
saying to the boy: "You shall see Mr. Emerson if it is at all possible."</p>
<p>In a few minutes Miss Alcott returned, her eyes moistened, and simply said:
"Come."</p>
<p>The boy followed her through two rooms, and at the threshold of the third
Miss Emerson stood, also with moistened eyes.</p>
<p>"Father," she said simply, and there, at his desk, sat Emerson--the man
whose words had already won Edward Bok's boyish interest, and who was destined
to impress himself upon his life more deeply than any other writer.</p>
<p>Slowly, at the daughter's spoken word, Emerson rose with a wonderful quiet
dignity, extended his hand, and as the boy's hand rested in his, looked him
full in the eyes.</p>
<p>No light of welcome came from those sad yet tender eyes. The boy closed upon
the hand in his with a loving pressure, and for a single moment the eyelids
rose, a different look came into those eyes, and Edward felt a slight,
perceptible response of the hand. But that was all!</p>
<p>Quietly he motioned the boy to a chair beside the desk. Edward sat down and
was about to say something, when, instead of seating himself, Emerson walked
away to the window and stood there softly whistling and looking out as if there
were no one in the room. Edward's eyes had followed Emerson's every footstep,
when the boy was aroused by hearing a suppressed sob, and as he looked around
he saw that it came from Miss Emerson. Slowly she walked out of the room. The
boy looked at Miss Alcott, and she put her finger to her mouth, indicating
silence. He was nonplussed.</p>
<p>Edward looked toward Emerson standing in that window, and wondered what it
all meant. Presently Emerson left the window and, crossing the room, came to
his desk, bowing to the boy as he passed, and seated himself, not speaking a
word and ignoring the presence of the two persons in the room.</p>
<p>Suddenly the boy heard Miss Alcott say: "Have you read this new book by
Ruskin yet?"</p>
<p>Slowly the great master of thought lifted his eyes from his desk, turned
toward the speaker, rose with stately courtesy from his chair, and, bowing to
Miss Alcott, said with great deliberation: "Did you speak to me, madam?"</p>
<p>The boy was dumfounded! Louisa Alcott, his Louisa! And he did not know her!
Suddenly the whole sad truth flashed upon the boy. Tears sprang into Miss
Alcott's eyes, and she walked to the other side of the room. The boy did not
know what to say or do, so he sat silent. With a deliberate movement Emerson
resumed his seat, and slowly his eyes roamed over the boy sitting at the side
of the desk. He felt he should say something.</p>
<p>"I thought, perhaps, Mr. Emerson," he said, "that you might be able to favor
me with a letter from Carlyle."</p>
<p>At the mention of the name Carlyle his eyes lifted, and he asked: "Carlyle,
did you say, sir, Carlyle?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the boy, "Thomas Carlyle."</p>
<p>"Ye-es," Emerson answered slowly. "To be sure, Carlyle. Yes, he was here
this morning. He will be here again to-morrow morning," he added gleefully,
almost like a child.</p>
<p>Then suddenly: "You were saying--"</p>
<p>Edward repeated his request.</p>
<p>"Oh, I think so, I think so," said Emerson, to the boy's astonishment. "Let
me see. Yes, here in this drawer I have many letters from Carlyle."</p>
<p>At these words Miss Alcott came from the other part of the room, her wet
eyes dancing with pleasure and her face wreathed in smiles.</p>
<p>"I think we can help this young man; do you not think so, Louisa?" said
Emerson, smiling toward Miss Alcott. The whole atmosphere of the room had
changed. How different the expression of his eyes as now Emerson looked at the
boy! "And you have come all the way from New York to ask me that!" he said
smilingly as the boy told him of his trip. "Now, let us see," he said, as he
delved in a drawer full of letters.</p>
<p>For a moment he groped among letters and papers, and then, softly closing
the drawer, he began that ominous low whistle once more, looked inquiringly at
each, and dropped his eyes straightway to the papers before him on his desk. It
was to be only for a few moments, then! Miss Alcott turned away.</p>
<p>The boy felt the interview could not last much longer. So, anxious to have
some personal souvenir of the meeting, he said: "Mr. Emerson, will you be so
good as to write your name in this book for me?" and he brought out an album he
had in his pocket.</p>
<p>"Name?" he asked vaguely.</p>
<p>"Yes, please," said the boy, "your name: Ralph Waldo Emerson."</p>
<p>But the sound of the name brought no response from the eyes.</p>
<p>"Please write out the name you want," he said finally, "and I will copy it
for you if I can."</p>
<p>It was hard for the boy to believe his own senses. But picking up a pen he
wrote: "Ralph Waldo Emerson, Concord; November 22, 1881."</p>
<p>Emerson looked at it, and said mournfully: "Thank you." Then he picked up
the pen, and writing the single letter "R" stopped, followed his finger until
it reached the "W" of Waldo, and studiously copied letter by letter! At the
word "Concord" he seemed to hesitate, as if the task were too great, but
finally copied again, letter by letter, until the second "c" was reached.
"Another 'o,'" he said, and interpolated an extra letter in the name of the
town which he had done so much to make famous the world over. When he had
finished he handed back the book, in which there was written:</p>
<pre class="poem">
  R. Waldo Emerson
  Concord
  November 22, 1881
</pre>
<p>The boy put the book into his pocket; and as he did so Emerson's eye caught
the slip on his desk, in the boy's handwriting, and, with a smile of absolute
enlightenment, he turned and said:</p>
<p>"You wish me to write my name? With pleasure. Have you a book with you?"</p>
<p>Overcome with astonishment, Edward mechanically handed him the album once
more from his pocket. Quickly turning over the leaves, Emerson picked up the
pen, and pushing aside the slip, wrote without a moment's hesitation:</p>
<pre class="poem">
  Ralph Waldo Emerson
  Concord
</pre>
<p>The boy was almost dazed at the instantaneous transformation in the man!</p>
<p>Miss Alcott now grasped this moment to say: "Well, we must be going!"</p>
<p>"So soon?" said Emerson, rising and smiling. Then turning to Miss Alcott he
said: "It was very kind of you, Louisa, to run over this morning and bring your
young friend."</p>
<p>Then turning to the boy he said: "Thank you so much for coming to see me.
You must come over again while you are with the Alcotts. Good morning! Isn't it
a beautiful day out?" he said, and as he shook the boy's hand there was a warm
grasp in it, the fingers closed around those of the boy, and as Edward looked
into those deep eyes they twinkled and smiled back.</p>
<p>The going was all so different from the coming. The boy was grateful that
his last impression was of a moment when the eye kindled and the hand
pulsated.</p>
<p>The two walked back to the Alcott home in an almost unbroken silence. Once
Edward ventured to remark:</p>
<p>"You can have no idea, Miss Alcott, how grateful I am to you."</p>
<p>"Well, my boy," she answered, "Phillips Brooks may be right: that it is
something to have seen him even so, than not to have seen him at all. But to us
it is so sad, so very sad. The twilight is gently closing in."</p>
<p>And so it proved--just five months afterward.</p>
<p>Eventful day after eventful day followed in Edward's Boston visit. The
following morning he spent with Wendell Phillips, who presented him with
letters from William Lloyd Garrison, Lucretia Mott, and other famous persons;
and then, writing a letter of introduction to Charles Francis Adams, whom he
enjoined to give the boy autograph letters from his two presidential forbears,
John Adams and John Quincy Adams, sent Edward on his way rejoicing. Mr. Adams
received the boy with equal graciousness and liberality. Wonderful letters from
the two Adamses were his when he left.</p>
<p>And then, taking the train for New York, Edward Bok went home, sitting up
all night in a day-coach for the double purpose of saving the cost of a
sleeping-berth and of having a chance to classify and clarify the events of the
most wonderful week in his life!</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_10">VII. A Plunge into Wall
Street</a></h3>
<p>The father of Edward Bok passed away when Edward was eighteen years of age,
and it was found that the amount of the small insurance left behind would
barely cover the funeral expenses. Hence the two boys faced the problem of
supporting the mother on their meagre income. They determined to have but one
goal: to put their mother back to that life of comfort to which she had been
brought up and was formerly accustomed. But that was not possible on their
income. It was evident that other employment must be taken on during the
evenings.</p>
<p>The city editor of the Brooklyn Eagle had given Edward the assignment of
covering the news of the theatres; he was to ascertain "coming attractions" and
any other dramatic items of news interest. One Monday evening, when a
multiplicity of events crowded the reportorial corps, Edward was delegated to
"cover" the Grand Opera House, where Rose Coghlan was to appear in a play that
had already been seen in Brooklyn, and called, therefore, for no special
dramatic criticism. Yet The Eagle wanted to cover it. It so happened that
Edward had made another appointment for that evening which he considered more
important, and yet not wishing to disappoint his editor he accepted the
assignment. He had seen Miss Coghlan in the play; so he kept his other
engagement, and without approaching the theatre he wrote a notice to the effect
that Miss Coghlan acted her part, if anything, with greater power than on her
previous Brooklyn visit, and so forth, and handed it in to his city editor the
next morning on his way to business.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, Miss Coghlan had been taken ill just before the
raising of the curtain, and, there being no understudy, no performance had been
given and the audience dismissed. All this was duly commented upon by the New
York morning newspapers. Edward read this bit of news on the ferry-boat, but
his notice was in the hands of the city editor.</p>
<p>On reaching home that evening he found a summons from The Eagle, and the
next morning he received a rebuke, and was informed that his chances with the
paper were over. The ready acknowledgment and evident regret of the crestfallen
boy, however, appealed to the editor, and before the end of the week he called
the boy to him and promised him another chance, provided the lesson had sunk
in. It had, and it left a lasting impression. It was always a cause of profound
gratitude with Edward Bok that his first attempt at "faking" occurred so early
in his journalistic career that he could take the experience to heart and
profit by it.</p>
<p>One evening when Edward was attending a theatrical performance, he noticed
the restlessness of the women in the audience between the acts. In those days
it was, even more than at present, the custom for the men to go out between the
acts, leaving the women alone. Edward looked at the programme in his hands. It
was a large eleven-by-nine sheet, four pages, badly printed, with nothing in it
save the cast, a few advertisements, and an announcement of some coming
attraction. The boy mechanically folded the programme, turned it long side up
and wondered whether a programme of this smaller size, easier to handle, with
an attractive cover and some reading-matter, would not be profitable.</p>
<p>When he reached home he made up an eight-page "dummy," pasted an attractive
picture on the cover, indicated the material to go inside, and the next morning
showed it to the manager of the theatre. The programme as issued was an item of
considerable expense to the management; Edward offered to supply his new
programme without cost, provided he was given the exclusive right, and the
manager at once accepted the offer. Edward then sought a friend, Frederic L.
Colver, who had a larger experience in publishing and advertising, with whom he
formed a partnership. Deciding that immediately upon the issuance of their
first programme the idea was likely to be taken up by the other theatres,
Edward proceeded to secure the exclusive rights to them all. The two young
publishers solicited their advertisements on the way to and from business
mornings and evenings, and shortly the first smaller-sized theatre programme,
now in use in all theatres, appeared. The venture was successful from the
start, returning a comfortable profit each week. Such advertisements as they
could not secure for cash they accepted in trade; and this latter arrangement
assisted materially in maintaining the households of the two publishers.</p>
<p>Edward's partner now introduced him into a debating society called The
Philomathean Society, made up of young men connected with Plymouth Church, of
which Henry Ward Beecher was pastor. The debates took the form of a miniature
congress, each member representing a State, and it is a curious coincidence
that Edward drew, by lot, the representation of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The members took these debates very seriously; no subject was too
large for them to discuss. Edward became intensely interested in the society's
doings, and it was not long before he was elected president.</p>
<p>The society derived its revenue from the dues of its members and from an
annual concert given under its auspices in Plymouth Church. When the time for
the concert under Edward's presidency came around, he decided that the occasion
should be unique so as to insure a crowded house. He induced Mr. Beecher to
preside; he got General Grant's promise to come and speak; he secured the
gratuitous services of Emma C. Thursby, Annie Louise Cary, Clara Louise
Kellogg, and Evelyn Lyon Hegeman, all of the first rank of concert-singers of
that day, with the result that the church could not accommodate the crowd which
naturally was attracted by such a programme.</p>
<p>It now entered into the minds of the two young theatre-programme publishers
to extend their publishing interests by issuing an "organ" for their society,
and the first issue of The Philomathean Review duly appeared with Mr. Colver as
its publisher and Edward Bok as editor. Edward had now an opportunity to try
his wings in an editorial capacity. The periodical was, of course, essentially
an organ of the society; but gradually it took on a more general character, so
that its circulation might extend over a larger portion of Brooklyn. With this
extension came a further broadening of its contents, which now began to take on
a literary character, and it was not long before its two projectors realized
that the periodical had outgrown its name. It was decided--late in 1884--to
change the name to The Brooklyn Magazine.</p>
<p>There was a periodical called The Plymouth Pulpit, which presented verbatim
reports of the sermons of Mr. Beecher, and Edward got the idea of absorbing the
Pulpit in the Magazine. But that required more capital than he and his partner
could command. They consulted Mr. Beecher, who, attracted by the enterprise of
the two boys, sent them with letters of introduction to a few of his most
influential parishioners, with the result that the pair soon had a sufficient
financial backing by some of the leading men of Brooklyn, like A. A. Low, H. B.
Claflin, Rufus T. Bush, Henry W. Slocum, Seth Low, Rossiter W. Raymond, Horatio
C. King, and others.</p>
<p>The young publishers could now go on. Understanding that Mr. Beecher's
sermons might give a partial and denominational tone to the magazine, Edward
arranged to publish also in its pages verbatim reports of the sermons of the
Reverend T. De Witt Talmage, whose reputation was then at its zenith. The young
editor now realized that he had a rather heavy cargo of sermons to carry each
month; accordingly, in order that his magazine might not appear to be
exclusively religious, he determined that its literary contents should be of a
high order and equal in interest to the sermons. But this called for additional
capital, and the capital furnished was not for that purpose.</p>
<p>It is here that Edward's autographic acquaintances stood him in good stead.
He went in turn to each noted person he had met, explained his plight and
stated his ambitions, with the result that very soon the magazine and the
public were surprised at the distinction of the contributors to The Brooklyn
Magazine. Each number contained a noteworthy list of them, and when an article
by the President of the United States, then Rutherford B. Hayes, opened one of
the numbers, the public was astonished, since up to that time the unwritten
rule that a President's writings were confined to official pronouncements had
scarcely been broken. William Dean Howells, General Grant, General Sherman,
Phillips Brooks, General Sheridan, Canon Farrar, Cardinal Gibbons, Marion
Harland, Margaret Sangster--the most prominent men and women of the day, some
of whom had never written for magazines--began to appear in the young editor's
contents. Editors wondered how the publishers could afford it, whereas, in
fact, not a single name represented an honorarium. Each contributor had come
gratuitously to the aid of the editor.</p>
<p>At first, the circulation of the magazine permitted the boys to wrap the
copies themselves; and then they, with two other boys, would carry as huge
bundles as they could lift, put them late at night on the front platform of the
street-cars, and take them to the postoffice. Thus the boys absolutely knew the
growth of their circulation by the weight of their bundles and the number of
their front-platform trips each month. Soon a baker's hand-cart was leased for
an evening, and that was added to the capacity of the front platforms. Then one
eventful month it was seen that a horse-truck would have to be employed. Within
three weeks, a double horse-truck was necessary, and three trips had to be
made.</p>
<p>By this time Edward Bok had become so intensely interested in the editorial
problem, and his partner in the periodical publishing part, that they decided
to sell out their theatre-programme interests and devote themselves to the
magazine and its rapidly increasing circulation. All of Edward's editorial work
had naturally to be done outside of his business hours, in other words, in the
evenings and on Sundays; and the young editor found himself fully occupied. He
now revived the old idea of selecting a subject and having ten or twenty
writers express their views on it. It was the old symposium idea, but it had
not been presented in American journalism for a number of years. He conceived
the topic "Should America Have a Westminster Abbey?" and induced some twenty of
the foremost men and women of the day to discuss it. When the discussion was
presented in the magazine, the form being new and the theme novel, Edward was
careful to send advance sheets to the newspapers, which treated it at length in
reviews and editorials, with marked effect upon the circulation of the
magazine.</p>
<p>All this time, while Edward Bok was an editor in his evenings he was, during
the day, a stenographer and clerk of the Western Union Telegraph Company. The
two occupations were hardly compatible, but each meant a source of revenue to
the boy, and he felt he must hold on to both.</p>
<p>After his father passed away, the position of the boy's desk--next to the
empty desk of his father--was a cause of constant depression to him. This was
understood by the attorney for the company, Mr. Clarence Cary, who sought the
head of Edward's department, with the result that Edward was transferred to Mr.
Cary's department as the attorney's private stenographer.</p>
<p>Edward had been much attracted to Mr. Cary, and the attorney believed in the
boy, and decided to show his interest by pushing him along. He had heard of the
dual role which Edward was playing; he bought a copy of the magazine, and was
interested. Edward now worked with new zest for his employer and friend; while
in every free moment he read law, feeling that, as almost all his forbears had
been lawyers, he might perhaps be destined for the bar. This acquaintance with
the fundamental basis of law, cursory as it was, became like a gospel to Edward
Bok. In later years, he was taught its value by repeated experience in his
contact with corporate laws, contracts, property leases, and other matters; and
he determined that, whatever the direction of activity taken by his sons, each
should spend at least a year in the study of law.</p>
<p>The control of the Western Union Telegraph Company had now passed into the
hands of Jay Gould and his companions, and in the many legal matters arising
therefrom, Edward saw much, in his office, of "the little wizard of Wall
Street." One day, the financier had to dictate a contract, and, coming into Mr.
Cary's office, decided to dictate it then and there. An hour afterward Edward
delivered the copy of the contract to Mr. Gould, and the financier was so
struck by its accuracy and by the legibility of the handwriting that afterward
he almost daily "happened in" to dictate to Mr. Cary's stenographer. Mr.
Gould's private stenographer was in his own office in lower Broadway; but on
his way down-town in the morning Mr. Gould invariably stopped at the Western
Union Building, at 195 Broadway, and the habit resulted in the installation of
a private office there. He borrowed Edward to do his stenography. The boy found
himself taking not only letters from Mr. Gould's dictation, but, what
interested him particularly, the financier's orders to buy and sell stock.</p>
<p>Edward watched the effects on the stock-market of these little notes which
he wrote out and then shot through a pneumatic tube to Mr. Gould's brokers.
Naturally, the results enthralled the boy, and he told Mr. Cary about his
discoveries. This, in turn, interested Mr. Cary; Mr. Gould's dictations were
frequently given in Mr. Cary's own office, where, as his desk was not ten feet
from that of his stenographer, the attorney heard them, and began to buy and
sell according to the magnate's decisions.</p>
<p>Edward had now become tremendously interested in the stock game which he saw
constantly played by the great financier; and having a little money saved up,
he concluded that he would follow in the wake of Mr. Gould's orders. One day,
he naively mentioned his desire to Mr. Gould, when the financier seemed in a
particularly favorable frame of mind; but Edward did not succeed in drawing out
the advice he hoped for. "At least," reasoned Edward, "he knew of my intention;
and if he considered it a violation of confidence he would have said as
much."</p>
<p>Construing the financier's silence to mean at least not a prohibition,
Edward went to his Sunday-school teacher, who was a member of a Wall Street
brokerage firm, laid the facts before him, and asked him if he would buy for
him some Western Union stock. Edward explained, however, that somehow he did
not like the gambling idea of buying "on margin," and preferred to purchase the
stock outright. He was shown that this would mean smaller profits; but the boy
had in mind the loss of his father's fortune, brought about largely by "stock
margins," and he did not intend to follow that example. So, prudently, under
the brokerage of his Sunday-school teacher, and guided by the tips of no less a
man than the controlling factor of stock-market finance, Edward Bok took his
first plunge in Wall Street!</p>
<p>Of course the boy's buying and selling tallied precisely with the rise and
fall of Western Union stock. It could scarcely have been otherwise. Jay Gould
had the cards all in his hands; and as he bought and sold, so Edward bought and
sold. The trouble was, the combination did not end there, as Edward might have
foreseen had he been older and thus wiser. For as Edward bought and sold, so
did his Sunday-school teacher, and all his customers who had seen the wonderful
acumen of their broker in choosing exactly the right time to buy and sell
Western Union. But Edward did not know this.</p>
<p>One day a rumor became current on the Street that an agreement had been
reached by the Western Union Company and its bitter rival, the American Union
Telegraph Company, whereby the former was to absorb the latter. Naturally, the
report affected Western Union stock. But Mr. Gould denied it in toto; said the
report was not true, no such consolidation was in view or had even been
considered. Down tumbled the stock, of course.</p>
<p>But it so happened that Edward knew the rumor was true, because Mr. Gould,
some time before, had personally given him the contract of consolidation to
copy. The next day a rumor to the effect that the American Union was to absorb
the Western Union appeared on the first page of every New York newspaper.
Edward knew exactly whence this rumor emanated. He had heard it talked over.
Again, Western Union stock dropped several points. Then he noticed that Mr.
Gould became a heavy buyer. So became Edward--as heavy as he could. Jay Gould
pooh-poohed the latest rumor. The boy awaited developments.</p>
<p>On Sunday afternoon, Edward's Sunday-school teacher asked the boy to walk
home with him, and on reaching the house took him into the study and asked him
whether he felt justified in putting all his savings in Western Union just at
that time when the price was tumbling so fast and the market was so unsteady.
Edward assured his teacher that he was right, although he explained that he
could not disclose the basis of his assurance.</p>
<p>Edward thought his teacher looked worried, and after a little there came the
revelation that he, seeing that Edward was buying to his limit, had likewise
done so. But the broker had bought on margin, and had his margin wiped out by
the decline in the stock caused by the rumors. He explained to Edward that he
could recoup his losses, heavy though they were--in fact, he explained that
nearly everything he possessed was involved--if Edward's basis was sure and the
stock would recover.</p>
<p>Edward keenly felt the responsibility placed upon him. He could never
clearly diagnose his feelings when he saw his teacher in this new light. The
broker's "customers" had been hinted at, and the boy of eighteen wondered how
far his responsibility went, and how many persons were involved. But the deal
came out all right, for when, three days afterward, the contract was made
public, Western Union, of course, skyrocketed, Jay Gould sold out, Edward sold
out, the teacher-broker sold out, and all the customers sold out!</p>
<p>How long a string it was Edward never discovered, but he determined there
and then to end his Wall Street experience; his original amount had multiplied;
he was content to let well enough alone, and from that day to this Edward Bok
has kept out of Wall Street. He had seen enough of its manipulations; and,
although on "the inside," he decided that the combination of his teacher and
his customers was a responsibility too great for him to carry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Edward decided to leave the Western Union. The longer he
remained, the less he liked its atmosphere. And the closer his contact with Jay
Gould the more doubtful he became of the wisdom of such an association and
perhaps its unconscious influence upon his own life in its formative
period.</p>
<p>In fact, it was an experience with Mr. Gould that definitely fixed Edward's
determination. The financier decided one Saturday to leave on a railroad
inspection tour on the following Monday. It was necessary that a special
meeting of one of his railroad interests should be held before his departure,
and he fixed the meeting for Sunday at eleven-thirty at his residence on Fifth
Avenue. He asked Edward to be there to take the notes of the meeting.</p>
<p>The meeting was protracted, and at one o'clock Mr. Gould suggested an
adjournment for luncheon, the meeting to reconvene at two. Turning to Edward,
the financier said: "You may go out to luncheon and return in an hour." So, on
Sunday afternoon, with the Windsor Hotel on the opposite corner as the only
visible place to get something to eat, but where he could not afford to go,
Edward, with just fifteen cents in his pocket, was turned out to find a
luncheon place.</p>
<p>He bought three apples for five cents--all that he could afford to spend,
and even this meant that he must walk home from the ferry to his house in
Brooklyn--and these he ate as he walked up and down Fifth Avenue until his hour
was over. When the meeting ended at three o'clock, Mr. Gould said that, as he
was leaving for the West early next morning, he would like Edward to write out
his notes, and have them at his house by eight o'clock. There were over forty
note-book pages of minutes. The remainder of Edward's Sunday afternoon and
evening was spent in transcribing the notes. By rising at half past five the
next morning he reached Mr. Gould's house at a quarter to eight, handed him the
minutes, and was dismissed without so much as a word of thanks or a nod of
approval from the financier.</p>
<p>Edward felt that this exceeded the limit of fair treatment by employer of
employee. He spoke of it to Mr. Cary, and asked whether he would object if he
tried to get away from such influence and secure another position. His employer
asked the boy in which direction he would like to go, and Edward unhesitatingly
suggested the publishing business. He talked it over from every angle with his
employer, and Mr. Cary not only agreed with him that his decision was wise, but
promised to find him a position such as he had in mind.</p>
<p>It was not long before Mr. Cary made good his word, and told Edward that his
friend Henry Holt, the publisher, would like to give him a trial.</p>
<p>The day before he was to leave the Western Union Telegraph Company the fact
of his resignation became known to Mr. Gould. The financier told the boy there
was no reason for his leaving, and that he would personally see to it that a
substantial increase was made in his salary. Edward explained that the salary,
while of importance to him, did not influence him so much as securing a
position in a business in which he felt he would be happier.</p>
<p>"And what business is that?" asked the financier.</p>
<p>"The publishing of books," replied the boy.</p>
<p>"You are making a great mistake," answered the little man, fixing his keen
gray eyes on the boy. "Books are a luxury. The public spends its largest money
on necessities: on what it can't do without. It must telegraph; it need not
read. It can read in libraries. A promising boy such as you are, with his life
before him, should choose the right sort of business, not the wrong one."</p>
<p>But, as facts proved, the "little wizard of Wall Street" was wrong in his
prediction; Edward Bok was not choosing the wrong business.</p>
<p>Years afterward when Edward was cruising up the Hudson with a yachting party
one Saturday afternoon, the sight of Jay Gould's mansion, upon approaching
Irvington, awakened the desire of the women on board to see his wonderful
orchid collection. Edward explained his previous association with the financier
and offered to recall himself to him, if the party wished to take the chance of
recognition. A note was written to Mr. Gould, and sent ashore, and the answer
came back that they were welcome to visit the orchid houses. Jay Gould, in
person, received the party, and, placing it under the personal conduct of his
gardener, turned to Edward and, indicating a bench, said: "Come and sit down
here with me."</p>
<p>"Well," said the financier, who was in his domestic mood, quite different
from his Wall Street aspect, "I see in the papers that you seem to be making
your way in the publishing business."</p>
<p>Edward expressed surprise that the Wall Street magnate had followed his
work.</p>
<p>"I have because I always felt you had it in you to make a successful man.
But not in that business," he added quickly. "You were born for the Street. You
would have made a great success there, and that is what I had in mind for you.
In the publishing business you will go just so far; in the Street you could
have gone as far as you liked. There is room there; there is none in the
publishing business. It's not too late now, for that matter," continued the
"little wizard," fastening his steel eyes on the lad beside him!</p>
<p>And Edward Bok has often speculated whither Jay Gould might have led him. To
many a young man, a suggestion from such a source would have seemed the one to
heed and follow. But Edward Bok's instinct never failed him. He felt that his
path lay far apart from that of Jay Gould--and the farther the better!</p>
<p>In 1882 Edward, with a feeling of distinct relief, left the employ of the
Western Union Telegraph Company and associated himself with the publishing
business in which he had correctly divined that his future lay.</p>
<p>His chief regret on leaving his position was in severing the close
relations, almost as of father and son, between Mr. Cary and himself. When
Edward was left alone, with the passing away of his father, Clarence Cary had
put his sheltering arm around the lonely boy, and with the tremendous
encouragement of the phrase that the boy never forgot, "I think you have it in
you, Edward, to make a successful man," he took him under his wing. It was a
turning-point in Edward Bok's life, as he felt at the time and as he saw more
clearly afterward.</p>
<p>He remained in touch with his friend, however, keeping him advised of his
progress in everything he did, not only at that time, but all through his later
years. And it was given to Edward to feel the deep satisfaction of having Mr.
Cary say, before he passed away, that the boy had more than justified the
confidence reposed in him. Mr. Cary lived to see him well on his way, until,
indeed, Edward had had the proud happiness of introducing to his benefactor the
son who bore his name, Cary William Bok.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_11">VIII. Starting a Newspaper
Syndicate</a></h3>
<p>Edward felt that his daytime hours, spent in a publishing atmosphere as
stenographer with Henry Holt and Company, were more in line with his editorial
duties during the evenings. The Brooklyn Magazine was now earning a comfortable
income for its two young proprietors, and their backers were entirely satisfied
with the way it was being conducted. In fact, one of these backers, Mr. Rufus
T. Bush, associated with the Standard Oil Company, who became especially
interested, thought he saw in the success of the two boys a possible opening
for one of his sons, who was shortly to be graduated from college. He talked to
the publisher and editor about the idea, but the boys showed by their books
that while there was a reasonable income for them, not wholly dependent on the
magazine, there was no room for a third.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush now suggested that he buy the magazine for his son, alter its name,
enlarge its scope, and make of it a national periodical. Arrangements were
concluded, those who had financially backed the venture were fully paid, and
the two boys received a satisfactory amount for their work in building up the
magazine. Mr. Bush asked Edward to suggest a name for the new periodical, and
in the following month of May, 1887, The Brooklyn Magazine became The American
Magazine, with its publication office in New York. But, though a great deal of
money was spent on the new magazine, it did not succeed. Mr. Bush sold his
interest in the periodical, which, once more changing its name, became The
Cosmopolitan Magazine. Since then it has passed through the hands of several
owners, but the name has remained the same. Before Mr. Bush sold The American
Magazine he had urged Edward to come back to it as its editor, with promise of
financial support; but the young man felt instinctively that his return would
not be wise. The magazine had been The Cosmopolitan only a short time when the
new owners, Mr. Paul J. Slicht and Mr. E. D. Walker, also solicited the
previous editor to accept reappointment. But Edward, feeling that his baby had
been rechristened too often for him to father it again, declined the
proposition. He had not heard the last of it, however, for, by a curious
coincidence, its subsequent owner, entirely ignorant of Edward's previous
association with the magazine, invited him to connect himself with it. Thus
three times could Edward Bok have returned to the magazine for whose creation
he was responsible.</p>
<p>Edward was now without editorial cares; but he had already, even before
disposing of the magazine, embarked on another line of endeavor. In sending to
a number of newspapers the advance sheets of a particularly striking "feature"
in one of his numbers of The Brooklyn Magazine, it occurred to him that he was
furnishing a good deal of valuable material to these papers without cost. It is
true his magazine was receiving the advertising value of editorial comment; but
the boy wondered whether the newspapers would not be willing to pay for the
privilege of simultaneous publication. An inquiry or two proved that they
would. Thus Edward stumbled upon the "syndicate" plan of furnishing the same
article to a group of newspapers, one in each city, for simultaneous
publication. He looked over the ground, and found that while his idea was not a
new one, since two "syndicate" agencies already existed, the field was by no
means fully covered, and that the success of a third agency would depend
entirely upon its ability to furnish the newspapers with material equally good
or better than they received from the others. After following the material
furnished by these agencies for two or three weeks, Edward decided that there
was plenty of room for his new ideas.</p>
<p>He discussed the matter with his former magazine partner, Colver, and
suggested that if they could induce Mr. Beecher to write a weekly comment on
current events for the newspapers it would make an auspicious beginning. They
decided to talk it over with the famous preacher. For to be a "Plymouth
boy"--that is, to go to the Plymouth Church Sunday-school and to attend church
there--was to know personally and become devoted to Henry Ward Beecher. And the
two were synonymous. There was no distance between Mr. Beecher and his
"Plymouth boys." Each understood the other. The tie was that of absolute
comradeship.</p>
<p>"I don't believe in it, boys," said Mr. Beecher when Edward and his friend
broached the syndicate letter to him. "No one yet ever made a cent out of my
supposed literary work."</p>
<p>All the more reason, was the argument, why some one should.</p>
<p>Mr. Beecher smiled! How well he knew the youthful enthusiasm that rushes in,
etc.</p>
<p>"Well, all right, boys! I like your pluck," he finally said. "I'll help you
if I can."</p>
<p>The boys agreed to pay Mr. Beecher a weekly sum of two hundred and fifty
dollars--which he knew was considerable for them.</p>
<p>When the first article had been written they took him their first check. He
looked at it quizzically, and then at the boys. Then he said simply: "Thank
you." He took a pin and pinned the check to his desk. There it remained, much
to the curiosity of the two boys.</p>
<p>The following week he had written the second article and the boys gave him
another check. He pinned that up over the other. "I like to look at them," was
his only explanation, as he saw Edward's inquiring glance one morning.</p>
<p>The third check was treated the same way. When the boys handed him the
fourth, one morning, as he was pinning it up over the others, he asked: "When
do you get your money from the newspapers?"</p>
<p>He was told that the bills were going out that morning for the four letters
constituting a month's service.</p>
<p>"I see," he remarked.</p>
<p>A fortnight passed, then one day Mr. Beecher asked: "Well, how are the
checks coming in?"</p>
<p>"Very well," he was assured.</p>
<p>"Suppose you let me see how much you've got in," he suggested, and the boys
brought the accounts to him.</p>
<p>After looking at them he said: "That's very interesting. How much have you
in the bank?"</p>
<p>He was told the balance, less the checks given to him. "But I haven't turned
them in yet," he explained. "Anyhow, you have enough in bank to meet the checks
you have given me, and a profit besides, haven't you?"</p>
<p>He was assured they had.</p>
<p>Then, taking his bank-book from a drawer, he unpinned the six checks on his
desk, indorsed each thus: wrote a deposit-slip, and, handing the book to
Edward, said:</p>
<pre class="poem">
  For deposit (??) in Bank
  H. W. Beecher
</pre>
<p>"Just hand that in at the bank as you go by, will you?"</p>
<p>Edward was very young then, and Mr. Beecher's methods of financiering seemed
to him quite in line with current notions of the Plymouth pastor's lack of
business knowledge. But as the years rolled on the incident appeared in a new
light--a striking example of the great preacher's wonderful
considerateness.</p>
<p>Edward had offered to help Mr. Beecher with his correspondence; at the close
of one afternoon, while he was with the Plymouth pastor at work, an
organ-grinder and a little girl came under the study window. A cold, driving
rain was pelting down. In a moment Mr. Beecher noticed the girl's bare toes
sticking out of her worn shoes.</p>
<p>He got up, went into the hall, and called for one of his granddaughters.</p>
<p>"Got any good, strong rain boots?" he asked when she appeared.</p>
<p>"Why, yes, grandfather. Why?" was the answer.</p>
<p>"More than one pair?" Mr. Beecher asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, two or three, I think."</p>
<p>"Bring me your strongest pair, will you, dear?" he asked. And as the girl
looked at him with surprise he said: "Just one of my notions."</p>
<p>"Now, just bring that child into the house and put them on her feet for me,
will you?" he said when the shoes came. "I'll be able to work so much
better."</p>
<p>One rainy day, as Edward was coming up from Fulton Ferry with Mr. Beecher,
they met an old woman soaked with the rain. "Here, you take this, my good
woman," said the clergyman, putting his umbrella over her head and thrusting
the handle into the astonished woman's hand. "Let's get into this," he said to
Edward simply, as he hailed a passing car.</p>
<p>"There is a good deal of fraud about beggars," he remarked as he waved a sot
away from him one day; "but that doesn't apply to women and children," he
added; and he never passed such mendicants without stopping. All the stories
about their being tools in the hands of accomplices failed to convince him.
"They're women and children," he would say, and that settled it for him.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, son? Stuck?" he said once to a newsboy who was crying
with a heavy bundle of papers under his arm.</p>
<p>"Come along with me, then," said Mr. Beecher, taking the boy's hand and
leading him into the newspaper office a few doors up the street.</p>
<p>"This boy is stuck," he simply said to the man behind the counter. "Guess
The Eagle can stand it better than this boy; don't you think so?"</p>
<p>To the grown man Mr. Beecher rarely gave charity. He believed in a return
for his alms.</p>
<p>"Why don't you go to work?" he asked of a man who approached him one day in
the street.</p>
<p>"Can't find any," said the man.</p>
<p>"Looked hard for it?" was the next question.</p>
<p>"I have," and the man looked Mr. Beecher in the eye.</p>
<p>"Want some?" asked Mr. Beecher.</p>
<p>"I do," said the man.</p>
<p>"Come with me," said the preacher. And then to Edward, as they walked along
with the man following behind, he added: "That man is honest."</p>
<p>"Let this man sweep out the church," he said to the sexton when they had
reached Plymouth Church.</p>
<p>"But, Mr. Beecher," replied the sexton with wounded pride, "it doesn't need
it."</p>
<p>"Don't tell him so, though," said Mr. Beecher with a merry twinkle of the
eye; and the sexton understood.</p>
<p>Mr. Beecher was constantly thoughtful of a struggling young man's welfare,
even at the expense of his own material comfort. Anxious to save him from the
labor of writing out the newspaper articles, Edward, himself employed during
the daylight hours which Mr. Beecher preferred for his original work, suggested
a stenographer. The idea appealed to Mr. Beecher, for he was very busy just
then. He hesitated, but as Edward persisted, he said: "All right; let him come
to-morrow."</p>
<p>The next day he said: "I asked that stenographer friend of yours not to come
again. No use of my trying to dictate. I am too old to learn new tricks. Much
easier for me to write myself."</p>
<p>Shortly after that, however, Mr. Beecher dictated to Edward some material
for a book he was writing. Edward naturally wondered at this, and asked the
stenographer what had happened.</p>
<p>"Nothing," he said. "Only Mr. Beecher asked me how much it would cost you to
have me come to him each week. I told him, and then he sent me away."</p>
<p>That was Henry Ward Beecher!</p>
<p>Edward Bok was in the formative period between boyhood and young manhood
when impressions meant lessons, and associations meant ideals. Mr. Beecher
never disappointed. The closer one got to him, the greater he became--in
striking contrast to most public men, as Edward had already learned.</p>
<p>Then, his interests and sympathies were enormously wide. He took in so much!
One day Edward was walking past Fulton Market, in New York City, with Mr.
Beecher.</p>
<p>"Never skirt a market," the latter said; "always go through it. It's the
next best thing, in the winter, to going South."</p>
<p>Of course all the marketmen knew him, and they knew, too, his love for green
things.</p>
<p>"What do you think of these apples, Mr. Beecher?" one marketman would stop
to ask.</p>
<p>Mr. Beecher would answer heartily: "Fine! Don't see how you grow them. All
that my trees bear is a crop of scale. Still, the blossoms are beautiful in the
spring, and I like an apple-leaf. Ever examine one?" The marketman never had.
"Well, now, do, the next time you come across an apple-tree in the spring."</p>
<p>And thus he would spread abroad an interest in the beauties of nature which
were commonly passed over.</p>
<p>"Wonderful man, Beecher is," said a market dealer in green goods once. "I
had handled thousands of bunches of celery in my life and never noticed how
beautiful its top leaves were until he picked up a bunch once and told me all
about it. Now I haven't the heart to cut the leaves off when a customer asks
me."</p>
<p>His idea of his own vegetable-gardening at Boscobel, his Peekskill home, was
very amusing. One day Edward was having a hurried dinner, preparatory to
catching the New York train. Mr. Beecher sat beside the boy, telling him of
some things he wished done in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>"No, I thank you," said Edward, as the maid offered him some potatoes.</p>
<p>"Look here, young man," said Mr. Beecher, "don't pass those potatoes so
lightly. They're of my own raising--and I reckon they cost me about a dollar a
piece," he added with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>He was an education in so many ways! One instance taught Edward the great
danger of passionate speech that might unconsciously wound, and the manliness
of instant recognition of the error. Swayed by an occasion, or by the
responsiveness of an audience, Mr. Beecher would sometimes say something which
was not meant as it sounded. One evening, at a great political meeting at
Cooper Union, Mr. Beecher was at his brightest and wittiest. In the course of
his remarks he had occasion to refer to ex-President Hayes; some one in the
audience called out: "He was a softy!"</p>
<p>"No," was Mr. Beecher's quick response. "The country needed a poultice at
that time, and got it."</p>
<p>"He's dead now, anyhow," responded the voice.</p>
<p>"Not dead, my friend: he only sleepeth."</p>
<p>It convulsed the audience, of course, and the reporters took it down in
their books.</p>
<p>After the meeting Edward drove home with Mr. Beecher. After a while he
asked: "Well, how do you think it went?"</p>
<p>Edward replied he thought it went very well, except that he did not like the
reference to ex-President Hayes.</p>
<p>"What reference? What did I say?"</p>
<p>Edward repeated it.</p>
<p>"Did I say that?" he asked. Edward looked at him. Mr. Beecher's face was
tense. After a few moments he said: "That's generally the way with
extemporaneous remarks: they are always dangerous. The best impromptu speeches
and remarks are the carefully prepared kind," he added.</p>
<p>Edward told him he regretted the reference because he knew that General
Hayes would read it in the New York papers, and he would be nonplussed to
understand it, considering the cordial relations which existed between the two
men. Mr. Beecher knew of Edward's relations with the ex-President, and they had
often talked of him together.</p>
<p>Nothing more was said of the incident. When the Beecher home was reached Mr.
Beecher said: "Just come in a minute." He went straight to his desk, and wrote
and wrote. It seemed as if he would never stop. At last he handed Edward an
eight-page letter, closely written, addressed to General Hayes.</p>
<p>"Read that, and mail it, please, on your way home. Then it'll get there just
as quickly as the New York papers will."</p>
<p>It was a superbly fine letter,--one of those letters which only Henry Ward
Beecher could write in his tenderest moods. And the reply which came from
Fremont, Ohio, was no less fine!</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_12">IX. Association with Henry Ward
Beecher</a></h3>
<p>As a letter-writer, Henry Ward Beecher was a constant wonder. He never wrote
a commonplace letter. There was always himself in it--in whatever mood it found
him.</p>
<p>It was not customary for him to see all his mail. As a rule Mrs. Beecher
opened it, and attended to most of it. One evening Edward was helping Mrs.
Beecher handle an unusually large number of letters. He was reading one when
Mr. Beecher happened to come in and read what otherwise he would not have
seen:</p>
<p>"Reverend Henry Ward Beecher.</p>
<p>"Dear Sir:</p>
<p>"I journeyed over from my New York hotel yesterday morning to hear you
preach, expecting, of course, to hear an exposition of the gospel of Jesus
Christ. Instead, I heard a political harangue, with no reason or cohesion in
it. You made an ass of yourself.</p>
<p>"Very truly yours, __ __.</p>
<p>"That's to the point," commented Mr. Beecher with a smile; and then seating
himself at his desk, he turned the sheet over and wrote:</p>
<p>My Dear Sir:--</p>
<p>"I am sorry you should have taken so long a journey to hear Christ preached,
and then heard what you are polite enough to call a 'political harangue.' I am
sorry, too, that you think I made an ass of myself. In this connection I have
but one consolation: that you didn't make an ass of yourself. The Lord did
that."</p>
<p>"Henry Ward Beecher.</p>
<p>When the Reverend T. De Witt Talmage began to come into public notice in
Brooklyn, some of Mr. Beecher's overzealous followers unwisely gave the
impression that the Plymouth preacher resented sharing with another the pulpit
fame which he alone had so long unquestioningly held. Nothing, of course, was
further from Mr. Beecher's mind. As a matter of fact, the two men were
exceedingly good friends. Mr. Beecher once met Doctor Talmage in a crowded
business thoroughfare, where they got so deeply interested in each other's talk
that they sat down in some chairs standing in front of a furniture store. A
gathering throng of intensely amused people soon brought the two men to the
realization that they had better move. Then Mr. Beecher happened to see that
back of their heads had been, respectively, two signs: one reading, "This style
$3.45," the other, "This style $4.25."</p>
<p>"Well," said Mr. Beecher, as he and Doctor Talmage walked away laughing, "I
was ticketed higher than you, Talmage, anyhow."</p>
<p>"You're worth more," rejoined Doctor Talmage.</p>
<p>On another occasion, as the two men met they began to bandy each other.</p>
<p>"Now, Talmage," said Mr. Beecher, his eyes twinkling, "let's have it out. My
people say that Plymouth holds more people than the Tabernacle, and your folks
stand up for the Tabernacle. Now which is it? What is your estimate?"</p>
<p>"Well, I should say that the Tabernacle holds about fifteen thousand
people," said Doctor Talmage with a smile.</p>
<p>"Good," said Mr. Beecher, at once catching the spirit. "And I say that
Plymouth accommodates, comfortably, twenty thousand people. Now, let's tell our
respective trustees that it's settled, once for all."</p>
<p>Mr. Beecher could never be induced to take note of what others said of him.
His friends, with more heart than head, often tried to persuade him to answer
some attack, but he invariably waved them off. He always saw the ridiculous
side of those attacks; never their serious import.</p>
<p>At one time a fellow Brooklyn minister, a staunch Prohibitionist, publicly
reproved Mr. Beecher for being inconsistent in his temperance views, to the
extent that he preached temperance but drank beer at his own dinner-table. This
attack angered the friends of Mr. Beecher, who tried to persuade him to answer
the charge. But the Plymouth pastor refused. "Friend -- is a good fellow," was
the only comment they could elicit.</p>
<p>"But he ought to be broadened," persisted the friends.</p>
<p>"Well now," said Mr. Beecher, "that isn't always possible. For instance," he
continued, as that inimitable merry twinkle came into his eyes, "sometime ago
Friend -- criticised me for something I had said. I thought he ought not to
have done so, and the next time we met I told him so. He persisted, and I felt
the only way to treat him was as I would an unruly child. So I just took hold
of him, laid him face down over my knee, and proceeded to impress him as our
fathers used to do of old. And, do you know, I found that the Lord had not made
a place on him for me to lay my hand upon."</p>
<p>And in the laughter which met this sally Mr. Beecher ended with "You see, it
isn't always possible to broaden a man."</p>
<p>Mr. Beecher was rarely angry. Once, however, he came near it; yet he was
more displeased than angry. Some of his family and Edward had gone to a notable
public affair at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where a box had been placed at
Mr. Beecher's disposal. One member of the family was a very beautiful girl who
had brought a girl-friend. Both were attired in full evening decollete costume.
Mr. Beecher came in late from another engagement. A chair had been kept vacant
for him in the immediate front of the box, since his presence had been widely
advertised, and the audience was expecting to see him. When he came in, he
doffed his coat and was about to go to the chair reserved for him, when he
stopped, stepped back, and sat down in a chair in the rear of the box. It was
evident from his face that something had displeased him. Mrs. Beecher leaned
over and asked him, but he offered no explanation. Nothing was said.</p>
<p>Edward went back to the house with Mr. Beecher; after talking awhile in the
study, the preacher, wishing to show him something, was going up-stairs with
his guest and had nearly reached the second landing when there was the sound of
a rush, the gas was quickly turned low, and two white figures sped into one of
the rooms.</p>
<p>"My dears," called Mr. Beecher.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Beecher," came a voice from behind the door of the room in
question.</p>
<p>"Come here one minute," said Mr. Beecher.</p>
<p>"But we cannot," said the voice. "We are ready for bed. Wait until--"</p>
<p>"No; come as you are," returned Mr. Beecher.</p>
<p>"Let me go down-stairs," Edward interrupted.</p>
<p>"No; you stay right here," said Mr. Beecher.</p>
<p>"Why, Mr. Beecher! How can we? Isn't Edward with you?"</p>
<p>"You are keeping me waiting for you," was the quiet and firm answer.</p>
<p>There was a moment's hesitation. Then the door opened and the figures of the
two girls appeared.</p>
<p>"Now, turn up the gas, please, as it was," said Mr. Beecher.</p>
<p>"But, Mr. Beecher--"</p>
<p>"You heard me?"</p>
<p>Up went the light, and the two beautiful girls of the box stood in their
night-dresses.</p>
<p>"Now, why did you run away?" asked Mr. Beecher.</p>
<p>"Why, Mr. Beecher! How can you ask such a question?" pouted one of the
girls, looking at her dress and then at Edward.</p>
<p>"Exactly," said Mr. Beecher. "Your modesty leads you to run away from this
young man because he might possibly see you under a single light in dresses
that cover your entire bodies, while that same modesty did not prevent you all
this evening from sitting beside him, under a myriad of lights, in dresses that
exposed nearly half of your bodies. That's what I call a distinction with a
difference--with the difference to the credit neither of your intelligence nor
of your modesty. There is some modesty in the dresses you have on: there was
precious little in what you girls wore this evening. Good night."</p>
<p>"You do not believe, Mr. Beecher," Edward asked later, "in decollete
dressing for girls?"</p>
<p>"No, and even less for women. A girl has some excuse of youth on her side; a
woman none at all."</p>
<p>A few moments later he added:</p>
<p>"A proper dress for any girl or woman is one that reveals the lady, but not
her person."</p>
<p>Edward asked Mrs. Beecher one day whether Mr. Beecher had ever expressed an
opinion of his sister's famous book, Uncle Tom's Cabin, and she told this
interesting story of how the famous preacher read the story:</p>
<p>"When the story was first published in The National Era, in chapters, all
our family, excepting Mr. Beecher, looked impatiently for its appearance each
week. But, try as we might, we could not persuade Mr. Beecher to read it, or
let us tell him anything about it.</p>
<p>"'It's folly for you to be kept in constant excitement week after week,' he
would say. 'I shall wait till the work is completed, and take it all at one
dose.'</p>
<p>"After the serial ended, the book came to Mr. Beecher on the morning of a
day when he had a meeting on hand for the afternoon and a speech to make in the
evening. The book was quietly laid one side, for he always scrupulously avoided
everything that could interfere with work he was expected to do. But the next
day was a free day. Mr. Beecher rose even earlier than usual, and as soon as he
was dressed he began to read Uncle Tom's Cabin. When breakfast was ready he
took his book with him to the table, where reading and eating went on together;
but he spoke never a word. After morning prayers, he threw himself on the sofa,
forgot everything but his book, and read uninterruptedly till dinner-time.
Though evidently intensely interested, for a long time he controlled any marked
indication of it. Before noon I knew the storm was gathering that would conquer
his self-control, as it had done with us all. He frequently 'gave way to his
pocket-handkerchief,' to use one of his old humorous remarks, in a most
vigorous manner. In return for his teasing me for reading the work weekly, I
could not refrain from saying demurely, as I passed him once: 'You seem to have
a severe cold, Henry. How could you have taken it?' But what did I gain? Not
even a half-annoyed shake of the head, or the semblance of a smile. I might as
well have spoken to the Sphinx.</p>
<p>"When reminded that the dinner-bell had rung, he rose and went to the table,
still with his book in his hand. He asked the blessing with a tremor in his
voice, which showed the intense excitement under which he was laboring. We were
alone at the table, and there was nothing to distract his thoughts. He drank
his coffee, ate but little, and returned to his reading, with no thought of
indulging in his usual nap. His almost uncontrollable excitement revealed
itself in frequent half-suppressed sobs.</p>
<p>"Mr. Beecher was a very slow reader. I was getting uneasy over the marks of
strong feeling and excitement, and longed to have him finish the book. I could
see that he entered into the whole story, every scene, as if it were being
acted right before him, and he himself were the sufferer. He had always been a
pronounced Abolitionist, and the story he was reading roused intensely all he
had felt on that subject.</p>
<p>"The night came on. It was growing late, and I felt impelled to urge him to
retire. Without raising his eyes from the book, he replied:</p>
<p>"'Soon; soon; you go; I'll come soon.'</p>
<p>"Closing the house, I went to our room; but not to sleep. The clock struck
twelve, one, two, three; and then, to my great relief, I heard Mr. Beecher
coming up-stairs. As he entered, he threw Uncle Tom's Cabin on the table,
exclaiming: 'There; I've done it! But if Hattie Stowe ever writes anything more
like that I'll--well! She has nearly killed me.'</p>
<p>"And he never picked up the book from that day."</p>
<p>Any one who knew Henry Ward Beecher at all knew of his love of books. He
was, however, most prodigal in lending his books and he always forgot the
borrowers. Then when he wanted a certain volume from his library he could not
find it. He would, of course, have forgotten the borrower, but he had a unique
method of tracing the book.</p>
<p>One evening the great preacher suddenly appeared at a friend's house and,
quietly entering the drawing-room without removing his overcoat, he walked up
to his friend and said:</p>
<p>"Rossiter, why don't you bring back that Ruskin of mine that I lent
you?"</p>
<p>The man colored to the roots of his hair. "Why, Mr. Beecher," he said, "I'll
go up-stairs and get it for you right away. I would not have kept it so long,
only you told me I might."</p>
<p>At this Beecher burst into a fit of merry laughter. "Found! Found!" he
shouted, as he took off his overcoat and threw himself into a chair.</p>
<p>When he could stop laughing, he said: "You know, Rossiter, that I am always
ready to lend my books to any one who will make good use of them and bring them
back, but I always forget to whom I lend them. It happened, in this case, that
I wanted that volume of Ruskin about a week ago; but when I went to the shelf
for it, it was gone. I knew I must have lent it, but to whom I could not
remember. During the past week, I began to demand the book of every friend I
met to whom I might have lent it. Of course, every one of them protested
innocence; but at last I've struck the guilty man. I shall know, in future, how
to find my missing books. The plan works beautifully."</p>
<p>One evening, after supper, Mr. Beecher said to his wife:</p>
<p>"Mother, what material have we among our papers about our early Indiana
days?"</p>
<p>Mr. Beecher had long been importuned to write his autobiography, and he had
decided to do it after he had finished his Life of Christ.</p>
<p>Mrs. Beecher had two boxes brought into the room.</p>
<p>"Suppose you look into that box, if you will," said Mr. Beecher to Edward,
"and I'll take this one, and we'll see what we can find about that time.
Mother, you supervise and see how we look on the floor."</p>
<p>And Mr. Beecher sat down on the floor in front of one box,
shoemaker-fashion, while Edward, likewise on the floor, started on the other
box.</p>
<p>It was a dusty job, and the little room began to be filled with particles of
dust which set Mrs. Beecher coughing. At last she said: "I'll leave you two to
finish. I have some things to do up-stairs, and then I'll retire. Don't be too
late, Henry," she said.</p>
<p>It was one of those rare evenings for Mr. Beecher--absolutely free from
interruption; and, with his memory constantly taken back to his early days, he
continued in a reminiscent mood that was charmingly intimate to the boy.</p>
<p>"Found something?" he asked at one intermission when quiet had reigned
longer than usual, and he saw Edward studying a huge pile of papers.</p>
<p>"No, sir," said the boy. "Only a lot of papers about a suit."</p>
<p>"What suit?" asked Mr. Beecher mechanically, with his head buried in his
box.</p>
<p>"I don't know, sir," Edward replied naively, little knowing what he was
reopening to the preacher. "'Tilton versus Beecher' they are marked."</p>
<p>Mr. Beecher said nothing, and after the boy had fingered the papers he
chanced to look in the preacher's direction and found him watching him intently
with a curiously serious look in his face.</p>
<p>"Must have been a big suit," commented the boy. "Here's another pile of
papers about it."</p>
<p>Edward could not make out Mr. Beecher's steady look at him as he sat there
on the floor mechanically playing with a paper in his hand.</p>
<p>"Yes," he finally said, "it was a big suit. What does it mean to you?" he
asked suddenly.</p>
<p>"To me?" Edward asked. "Nothing, sir. Why?"</p>
<p>Mr. Beecher said nothing for a few moments, and turned to his box to examine
some more papers.</p>
<p>Then the boy asked: "Was the Beecher in this suit you, Mr. Beecher?"</p>
<p>Again was turned on him that serious, questioning look.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said after a bit. Then he thought again for a few moments and
said: "How old were you in 1875?"</p>
<p>"Twelve," the boy replied.</p>
<p>"Twelve," he repeated. "Twelve."</p>
<p>He turned again to his box and Edward to his.</p>
<p>"There doesn't seem to be anything more in this box," the boy said, "but
more papers in that suit," and he began to put the papers back.</p>
<p>"What do you know about that 'suit,' as you call it?" asked Mr. Beecher,
stopping in his work.</p>
<p>"Nothing," was the reply. "I never heard of it."</p>
<p>"Never heard of it?" he repeated, and he fastened that curious look upon
Edward again. It was so compelling that it held the boy. For several moments
they looked at each other. Neither spoke.</p>
<p>"That seems strange," he said, at last, as he renewed the search of his box.
"Never heard of it," he repeated almost to himself.</p>
<p>Then for fully five minutes not a word was spoken.</p>
<p>"But you will some day," said Mr. Beecher suddenly.</p>
<p>"I will what, Mr. Beecher?" asked the boy. He had forgotten the previous
remark.</p>
<p>Mr. Beecher looked at Edward and sighed. "Hear about it," he said.</p>
<p>"I don't think I understand you," was the reply.</p>
<p>"No, I don't think you do," he said. "I mean, you will some day hear about
that suit. And I don't know," then he hesitated, "but--but you might as well
get it straight. You say you were twelve then," he mused. "What were you doing
when you were twelve?"</p>
<p>"Going to school," was the reply.</p>
<p>"Yes, of course," said Mr. Beecher. "Well," he continued, turning on his
haunches so that his back rested against the box, "I am going to tell you the
story of that suit, and then you'll know it."</p>
<p>Edward said nothing, and then began the recital of a story that he was
destined to remember. It was interesting then, as Mr. Beecher progressed; but
how thrice interesting that wonderful recital was to prove as the years rolled
by and the boy realized the wonderful telling of that of all stories by Mr.
Beecher himself!</p>
<p>Slowly, and in that wonderfully low, mellow voice that so many knew and
loved, step by step, came the unfolding of that remarkable story. Once or twice
only did the voice halt, as when, after he had explained the basis of the
famous suit, he said:</p>
<p>"Those were the charges. That is what it was all about."</p>
<p>Then he looked at Edward and asked: "Do you know just what such charges
mean?"</p>
<p>"I think I do," Edward replied, and the question was asked with such
feeling, and the answer was said so mechanically, that Mr. Beecher replied
simply: "Perhaps."</p>
<p>"Well," he continued, "the suit was a 'long one,' as you said. For days and
weeks, yes, for months, it went on, from January to July, and those were very
full days: full of so many things that you would hardly understand."</p>
<p>And then he told the boy as much of the days in court as he thought he would
understand, and how the lawyers worked and worked, in court all day, and up
half the night, preparing for the next day. "Mostly around that little table
there," he said, pointing to a white, marble-topped table against which the boy
was leaning, and which now stands in Edward Bok's study.</p>
<p>"Finally the end came," he said, "after--well, months. To some it seemed
years," said Mr. Beecher, and his eyes looked tired.</p>
<p>"Well," he continued, "the case went to the jury: the men, you know, who had
to decide. There were twelve of them."</p>
<p>"Was it necessary that all twelve should think alike?" asked the boy.</p>
<p>"That was what was hoped, my boy," said Mr. Beecher--"that was what was
hoped," he repeated.</p>
<p>"Well, they did, didn't they?" Edward asked, as Mr. Beecher stopped.</p>
<p>"Nine did," he replied. "Yes; nine did. But three didn't. Three thought--"
Mr. Beecher stopped and did not finish the sentence. "But nine did," he
repeated. "Nine to three it stood. That was the decision, and then the judge
discharged the jury," he said.</p>
<p>There was naturally one question in the boyish mind to ask the man before
him--one question! Yet, instinctively, something within him made him hesitate
to ask that question. But at last his curiosity got the better of the still,
small voice of judgment.</p>
<p>"And, Mr. Beecher--" the boy began.</p>
<p>But Mr. Beecher knew! He knew what was at the end of the tongue, looked
clear into the boy's mind; and Edward can still see him lift that fine head and
look into his eyes, as he said, slowly and clearly:</p>
<p>"And the decision of the nine was in exact accord with the facts."</p>
<p>He had divined the question!</p>
<p>As the two rose from the floor that night Edward looked at the clock. It was
past midnight; Mr. Beecher had talked for two hours; the boy had spoken hardly
at all.</p>
<p>As the boy was going out, he turned to Mr. Beecher sitting thoughtfully in
his chair.</p>
<p>"Good night, Mr. Beecher," he said.</p>
<p>The Plymouth pastor pulled himself together, and with that wit that never
forsook him he looked at the clock, smiled, and answered: "Good morning, I
should say. God bless you, my boy." Then rising, he put his arm around the
boy's shoulders and walked with him to the door.</p>

"Literary Leaves," and Entering Scribner's</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Beecher's weekly newspaper "syndicate" letter was not only successful in
itself, it made liberal money for the writer and for its two young publishers,
but it served to introduce Edward Bok's proposed agency to the newspapers under
the most favorable conditions. With one stroke, the attention of newspaper
editors had been attracted, and Edward concluded to take quick advantage of it.
He organized the Bok Syndicate Press, with offices in New York, and his
brother, William J. Bok, as partner and active manager. Edward's days were
occupied, of course, with his duties in the Holt publishing house, where he was
acquiring a first-hand knowledge of the business.</p>
<p>Edward's attention was now turned, for the first time, to women and their
reading habits. He became interested in the fact that the American woman was
not a newspaper reader. He tried to find out the psychology of this, and
finally reached the conclusion, on looking over the newspapers, that the
absence of any distinctive material for women was a factor. He talked the
matter over with several prominent New York editors, who frankly acknowledged
that they would like nothing better than to interest women, and make them
readers of their papers. But they were equally frank in confessing that they
were ignorant both of what women wanted, and, even if they knew, of where such
material was to be had. Edward at once saw that here was an open field. It was
a productive field, since, as woman was the purchasing power, it would benefit
the newspaper enormously in its advertising if it could offer a feminine
clientele.</p>
<p>There was a bright letter of New York gossip published in the New York Star,
called "Bab's Babble." Edward had read it, and saw the possibility of
syndicating this item as a woman's letter from New York. He instinctively
realized that women all over the country would read it. He sought out the
author, made arrangements with her and with former Governor Dorscheimer, owner
of the paper, and the letter was sent out to a group of papers. It was an
instantaneous success, and a syndicate of ninety newspapers was quickly
organized.</p>
<p>Edward followed this up by engaging Ella Wheeler Wilcox, then at the height
of her career, to write a weekly letter on women's topics. This he syndicated
in conjunction with the other letter, and the editors invariably grouped the
two letters. This, in turn, naturally led to the idea of supplying an entire
page of matter of interest to women. The plan was proposed to a number of
editors, who at once saw the possibilities in it and promised support. The
young syndicator now laid under contribution all the famous women writers of
the day; he chose the best of the men writers to write on women's topics; and
it was not long before the syndicate was supplying a page of women's material.
The newspapers played up the innovation, and thus was introduced into the
newspaper press of the United States the "Woman's Page."</p>
<p>The material supplied by the Bok Syndicate Press was of the best; the
standard was kept high; the writers were selected from among the most popular
authors of the day; and readability was the cardinal note. The women bought the
newspapers containing the new page, the advertiser began to feel the presence
of the new reader, and every newspaper that could not get the rights for the
"Bok Page," as it came to be known, started a "Woman's Page" of it own.
Naturally, the material so obtained was of an inferior character. No single
newspaper could afford what the syndicate, with the expense divided among a
hundred newspapers, could pay. Nor had the editors of these woman's pages
either a standard or a policy. In desperation they engaged any person they
could to "get a lot of woman's stuff." It was stuff, and of the trashiest kind.
So that almost coincident with the birth of the idea began its abuse and
disintegration; the result we see in the meaningless presentations which pass
for "woman's pages" in the newspaper of to-day.</p>
<p>This is true even of the woman's material in the leading newspapers, and the
reason is not difficult to find. The average editor has, as a rule, no time to
study the changing conditions of women's interests; his time is and must be
engrossed by the news and editorial pages. He usually delegates the Sunday
"specials" to some editor who, again, has little time to study the
ever-changing women's problems, particularly in these days, and he relies upon
unintelligent advice, or he places his "woman's page" in the hands of some
woman with the comfortable assurance that, being a woman, she ought to know
what interests her sex.</p>
<p>But having given the subject little thought, he attaches minor importance to
the woman's "stuff," regarding it rather in the light of something that he
"must carry to catch the women"; and forthwith he either forgets it or refuses
to give the editor of his woman's page even a reasonable allowance to spend on
her material. The result is, of course, inevitable: pages of worthless
material. There is, in fact, no part of the Sunday newspaper of to-day upon
which so much good and now expensive white paper is wasted as upon the pages
marked for the home, for women, and for children.</p>
<p>Edward Bok now became convinced, from his book-publishing association, that
if the American women were not reading the newspapers, the American public, as
a whole, was not reading the number of books that it should, considering the
intelligence and wealth of the people, and the cheap prices at which books were
sold. He concluded to see whether he could not induce the newspapers to give
larger and more prominent space to the news of the book world.</p>
<p>Owing to his constant contact with authors, he was in a peculiarly fortunate
position to know their plans in advance of execution, and he was beginning to
learn the ins and outs of the book-publishing world. He canvassed the
newspapers subscribing to his syndicate features, but found a disinclination to
give space to literary news. To the average editor, purely literary features
held less of an appeal than did the features for women. Fewer persons were
interested in books, they declared; besides, the publishing houses were not so
liberal advertisers as the department stores. The whole question rested on a
commercial basis.</p>
<p>Edward believed he could convince editors of the public interest in a newsy,
readable New York literary letter, and he prevailed upon the editor of the New
York Star to allow him to supplement the book reviews of George Parsons Lathrop
in that paper by a column of literary chat called "Literary Leaves." For a
number of weeks he continued to write this department, and confine it to the
New York paper, feeling that he needed the experience for the acquirement of a
readable style, and he wanted to be sure that he had opened a sufficient number
of productive news channels to ensure a continuous flow of readable literary
information.</p>
<p>Occasionally he sent to an editor here and there what he thought was a
particularly newsy letter just "for his information, not for sale." The editor
of the Philadelphia Times was the first to discover that his paper wanted the
letter, and the Boston Journal followed suit. Then the editor of the Cincinnati
Times-Star discovered the letter in the New York Star, and asked that it be
supplied weekly with the letter. These newspapers renamed the letter "Bok's
Literary Leaves," and the feature started on its successful career.</p>
<p>Edward had been in the employ of Henry Holt and Company as clerk and
stenographer for two years when Mr. Cary sent for him and told him that there
was an opening in the publishing house of Charles Scribner's Sons, if he wanted
to make a change. Edward saw at once the larger opportunities possible in a
house of the importance of the Scribners, and he immediately placed himself in
communication with Mr. Charles Scribner, with the result that in January, 1884,
he entered the employ of these publishers as stenographer to the two members of
the firm and to Mr. Edward L. Burlingame, literary adviser to the house. He was
to receive a salary of eighteen dollars and thirty-three cents per week, which
was then considered a fair wage for stenographic work. The typewriter had at
that time not come into use, and all letters were written in long-hand. Once
more his legible handwriting had secured for him a position.</p>
<p>Edward Bok was now twenty-one years of age. He had already done a prodigious
amount of work for a boy of his years. He was always busy. Every spare moment
of his evenings was devoted either to writing his literary letter, to the
arrangement or editing of articles for his newspaper syndicate, to the steady
acquirement of autograph letters in which he still persisted, or to helping Mr.
Beecher in his literary work. The Plymouth pastor was particularly pleased with
Edward's successful exploitation of his pen work; and he afterward wrote: "Bok
is the only man who ever seemed to make my literary work go and get money out
of it."</p>
<p>Enterprise and energy the boy unquestionably possessed, but one need only
think back even thus far in his life to see the continuous good fortune which
had followed him in the friendships he had made, and in the men with whom his
life, at its most formative period, had come into close contact. If we are
inclined to credit young Bok with an ever-willingness to work and a certain
quality of initiative, the influences which played upon him must also be taken
into account.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the peculiarly fortuitous circumstances under which he
entered the Scribner publishing house. As stenographer to the two members of
the firm, Bok was immediately brought into touch with the leading authors of
the day, their works as they were discussed in the correspondence dictated to
him, and the authors' terms upon which books were published. In fact, he was
given as close an insight as it was possible for a young man to get into the
inner workings of one of the large publishing houses in the United States, with
a list peculiarly noted for the distinction of its authors and the broad scope
of its books.</p>
<p>The Scribners had the foremost theological list of all the publishing
houses; its educational list was exceptionally strong; its musical list
excelled; its fiction represented the leading writers of the day; its general
list was particularly noteworthy; and its foreign department, importing the
leading books brought out in Great Britain and Europe, was an outstanding
feature of the business. The correspondence dictated to Bok covered, naturally,
all these fields, and a more remarkable opportunity for self-education was
never offered a stenographer.</p>
<p>Mr. Burlingame was known in the publishing world for his singularly keen
literary appreciation, and was accepted as one of the best judges of good
fiction. Bok entered the Scribner employ as Mr. Burlingame was selecting the
best short stories published within a decade for a set of books to be called
"Short Stories by American Authors." The correspondence for this series was
dictated to Bok, and he decided to read after Mr. Burlingame and thus get an
idea of the best fiction of the day. So whenever his chief wrote to an author
asking for permission to include his story in the proposed series, Bok
immediately hunted up the story and read it.</p>
<p>Later, when the house decided to start Scribner's Magazine, and Mr.
Burlingame was selected to be its editor, all the preliminary correspondence
was dictated to Bok through his employers, and he received a firsthand
education in the setting up of the machinery necessary for the publication of a
magazine. All this he eagerly absorbed.</p>
<p>He was again fortunate in that his desk was placed in the advertising
department of the house; and here he found, as manager, an old-time Brooklyn
boy friend with whom he had gone to school: Frank N. Doubleday, to-day the
senior partner of Doubleday, Page and Company. Bok had been attracted to
advertising through his theatre programme and Brooklyn Magazine experience, and
here was presented a chance to learn the art at first hand and according to the
best traditions. So, whenever his stenographic work permitted, he assisted Mr.
Doubleday in preparing and placing the advertisements of the books of the
house.</p>
<p>Mr. Doubleday was just reviving the publication of a house-organ called The
Book Buyer, and, given a chance to help in this, Bok felt he was getting back
into the periodical field, especially since, under Mr. Doubleday's guidance,
the little monthly soon developed into a literary magazine of very respectable
size and generally bookish contents.</p>
<p>The house also issued another periodical, The Presbyterian Review, a
quarterly under the editorship of a board of professors connected with the
Princeton and Union Theological Seminaries. This ponderous-looking magazine was
not composed of what one might call "light reading," and as the price of a
single copy was eighty cents, and the advertisements it could reasonably expect
were necessarily limited in number, the periodical was rather difficult to
move. Thus the whole situation at the Scribners' was adapted to give Edward an
all-round training in the publishing business. It was an exceptional
opportunity.</p>
<p>He worked early and late. An increase in his salary soon told him that he
was satisfying his employers, and then, when the new Scribner's Magazine
appeared, and a little later Mr. Doubleday was delegated to take charge of the
business end of it, Bok himself was placed in charge of the advertising
department, with the publishing details of the two periodicals on his
hands.</p>
<p>He suddenly found himself directing a stenographer instead of being a
stenographer himself. Evidently his apprentice days were over. He had, in
addition, the charge of sending all the editorial copies of the new books to
the press for review, and of keeping a record of those reviews. This naturally
brought to his desk the authors of the house who wished to see how the press
received their works.</p>
<p>The study of the writers who were interested in following the press notices
of their books, and those who were indifferent to them became a fascinating
game to young Bok. He soon discovered that the greater the author the less he
seemed to care about his books once they were published. Bok noticed this,
particularly, in the case of Robert Louis Stevenson, whose work had attracted
him, but, although he used the most subtle means to inveigle the author into
the office to read the press notices, he never succeeded. Stevenson never
seemed to have the slightest interest in what the press said of his books.</p>
<p>One day Mr. Burlingame asked Bok to take some proofs to Stevenson at his
home; thinking it might be a propitious moment to interest the author in the
popular acclaim that followed the publication of Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,
Bok put a bunch of press notices in his pocket. He found the author in bed,
smoking his inevitable cigarette.</p>
<p>As the proofs were to be brought back, Bok waited, and thus had an
opportunity for nearly two hours to see the author at work. No man ever went
over his proofs more carefully than did Stevenson; his corrections were
numerous; and sometimes for ten minutes at a time he would sit smoking and
thinking over a single sentence, which, when he had satisfactorily shaped it in
his mind, he would recast on the proof.</p>
<p>Stevenson was not a prepossessing figure at these times. With his sallow
skin and his black dishevelled hair, with finger-nails which had been allowed
to grow very long, with fingers discolored by tobacco--in short, with a general
untidiness that was all his own, Stevenson, so Bok felt, was an author whom it
was better to read than to see. And yet his kindliness and gentleness more than
offset the unattractiveness of his physical appearance.</p>
<p>After one or two visits from Bok, having grown accustomed to him, Stevenson
would discuss some sentence in an article, or read some amended paragraph out
loud and ask whether Bok thought it sounded better. To pass upon Stevenson as a
stylist was, of course, hardly within Bok's mental reach, so he kept discreetly
silent when Stevenson asked his opinion.</p>
<p>In fact, Bok reasoned it out that the novelist did not really expect an
answer or an opinion, but was at such times thinking aloud. The mental process,
however, was immensely interesting, particularly when Stevenson would ask Bok
to hand him a book on words lying on an adjacent table. "So hard to find just
the right word," Stevenson would say, and Bok got his first realization of the
truth of the maxim: "Easy writing, hard reading; hard writing, easy
reading."</p>
<p>On this particular occasion when Stevenson finished, Bok pulled out his
clippings, told the author how his book was being received, and was selling,
what the house was doing to advertise it, explained the forthcoming play by
Richard Mansfield, and then offered the press notices.</p>
<p>Stevenson took the bundle and held it in his hand.</p>
<p>"That's very nice to tell me all you have," he said, "and I have been
greatly interested. But you have really told me all about it, haven't you, so
why should I read these notices? Hadn't I better get busy on another paper for
Mr. Burlingame for the next magazine, else he'll be after me? You know how
impatient these editors are." And he handed back the notices.</p>
<p>Bok saw it was of no use: Stevenson was interested in his work, but, beyond
a certain point, not in the world's reception of it. Bok's estimate of the
author rose immeasurably. His attitude was in such sharp contrast to that of
others who came almost daily into the office to see what the papers said, often
causing discomfiture to the young advertising director by insisting upon taking
the notices with them. But Bok always countered this desire by reminding the
author that, of course, in that case he could not quote from these desirable
notices in his advertisements of the book. And, invariably, the notices were
left behind!</p>
<p>It now fell to the lot of the young advertiser to arouse the interest of the
public in what were to be some of the most widely read and best-known books of
the day: Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; Frances Hodgson
Burnett's Little Lord Fauntleroy; Andrew Carnegie's Triumphant Democracy; Frank
R. Stockton's The Lady, or the Tiger? and his Rudder Grange, and a succession
of other books.</p>
<p>The advertising of these books keenly sharpened the publicity sense of the
developing advertising director. One book could best be advertised by the
conventional means of the display advertisement; another, like Triumphant
Democracy, was best served by sending out to the newspapers a "broadside" of
pungent extracts; public curiosity in a novel like The Lady, or the Tiger? was,
of course, whetted by the publication of literary notes as to the real
denouement the author had in mind in writing the story. Whenever Mr. Stockton
came into the office Bok pumped him dry as to his experiences with the story,
such as when, at a dinner party, his hostess served an ice-cream lady and a
tiger to the author, and the whole company watched which he chose.</p>
<p>"And which did you choose?" asked the advertising director.</p>
<p>"Et tu, Brute?" Stockton smilingly replied. "Well, I'll tell you. I asked
the butler to bring me another spoon, and then, with a spoon in each hand, I
attacked both the lady and the tiger at the same time."</p>
<p>Once, when Stockton was going to Boston by the night boat, every room was
taken. The ticket agent recognized the author, and promised to get him a
desirable room if the author would tell which he had had in mind, the lady or
the tiger.</p>
<p>"Produce the room," answered Stockton.</p>
<p>The man did. Stockton paid for it, and then said: "To tell you the truth, my
friend, I don't know."</p>
<p>And that was the truth, as Mr. Stockton confessed to his friends. The idea
of the story had fascinated him; when he began it he purposed to give it a
definite ending. But when he reached the end he didn't know himself which to
produce out of the open door, the lady or the tiger, "and so," he used to
explain, "I made up my mind to leave it hanging in the air."</p>
<p>To the present generation of readers, all this reference to Stockton's story
may sound strange, but for months it was the most talked-of story of the time,
and sold into large numbers.</p>
<p>One day while Mr. Stockton was in Bok's office, A. B. Frost, the
illustrator, came in. Frost had become a full-fledged farmer with one hundred
and twenty acres of Jersey land, and Stockton had a large farm in the South
which was a financial burden to him.</p>
<p>"Well, Stockton," said Frost, "I have found a way at last to make a farm
stop eating up money. Perhaps it will help you."</p>
<p>Stockton was busy writing, but at this bit of hopeful news he looked up, his
eyes kindled, he dropped his pen, and eagerly said:</p>
<p>"Tell me."</p>
<p>And looking behind him to see that the way was clear, Frost answered:</p>
<p>"Pave it solid, old man."</p>
<p>When the stories of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Little Lord Fauntleroy were
made into plays, Bok was given an opportunity for an entirely different kind of
publicity. Both plays were highly successful; they ran for weeks in succession,
and each evening Bok had circulars of the books in every seat of the theatre;
he had a table filled with the books in the foyer of each theatre; and he
bombarded the newspapers with stories of Mr. Mansfield's method of making the
quick change from one character to the other in the dual role of the Stevenson
play, and with anecdotes about the boy Tommy Russell in Mrs. Burnett's play.
The sale of the books went merrily on, and kept pace with the success of the
plays. And it all sharpened the initiative of the young advertiser and
developed his sense for publicity.</p>
<p>One day while waiting in the anteroom of a publishing house to see a member
of the firm, he picked up a book and began to read it. Since he had to wait for
nearly an hour, he had read a large part of the volume when he was at last
admitted to the private office. When his business was finished, Bok asked the
publisher why this book was not selling.</p>
<p>"I don't know," replied the publisher. "We had great hopes for it, but
somehow or other the public has not responded to it."</p>
<p>"Are you sure you are telling the public about it in the right way?"
ventured Bok.</p>
<p>The Scribner advertising had by this time attracted the attention of the
publishing world, and this publisher was entirely ready to listen to a
suggestion from his youthful caller.</p>
<p>"I wish we published it," said Bok. "I think I could make it a go. It's all
in the book."</p>
<p>"How would you advertise it?" asked the publisher.</p>
<p>Bok promised the publisher he would let him know. He carried with him a copy
of the book, wrote some advertisements for it, prepared an attractive
"broadside" of extracts, to which the book easily lent itself, wrote some
literary notes about it, and sent the whole collection to the publisher. Every
particle of "copy" which Bok had prepared was used, the book began to sell, and
within three months it was the most discussed book of the day.</p>
<p>The book was Edward Bellamy's "Looking Backward".</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_14">XI. The Chances for
Success</a></h3>
<p>Edward Bok does not now remember whether the mental picture had been given
him, or whether he had conjured it up for himself; but he certainly was
possessed of the idea, as are so many young men entering business, that the
path which led to success was very difficult: that it was overfilled with a
jostling, bustling, panting crowd, each eager to reach the goal; and all ready
to dispute every step that a young man should take; and that favoritism only
could bring one to the top.</p>
<p>After Bok had been in the world of affairs, he wondered where were these
choked avenues, these struggling masses, these competitors for every inch of
vantage. Then he gradually discovered that they did not exist.</p>
<p>In the first place, he found every avenue leading to success wide open and
certainly not over-peopled. He was surprised how few there were who really
stood in a young man's way. He found that favoritism was not the factor that he
had been led to suppose. He realized it existed in a few isolated cases, but to
these every one had pointed and about these every one had talked until, in the
public mind, they had multiplied in number and assumed a proportion that the
facts did not bear out.</p>
<p>Here and there a relative "played a favorite," but even with the push and
influence behind him "the lucky one," as he was termed, did not seem to make
progress, unless he had merit. It was not long before Bok discovered that the
possession of sheer merit was the only real factor that actually counted in any
of the places where he had been employed or in others which he had watched;
that business was so constructed and conducted that nothing else, in the face
of competition, could act as current coin. And the amazing part of it all to
Bok was how little merit there was. Nothing astonished him more than the low
average ability of those with whom he worked or came into contact.</p>
<p>He looked at the top, and instead of finding it overcrowded, he was
surprised at the few who had reached there; the top fairly begged for more to
climb its heights.</p>
<p>For every young man, earnest, eager to serve, willing to do more than he was
paid for, he found ten trying to solve the problem of how little they could
actually do for the pay received.</p>
<p>It interested Bok to listen to the talk of his fellow-workers during
luncheon hours and at all other times outside of office hours. When the talk
did turn on the business with which they were concerned, it consisted almost
entirely of wages, and he soon found that, with scarcely an exception, every
young man was terribly underpaid, and that his employer absolutely failed to
appreciate his work. It was interesting, later, when Bok happened to get the
angle of the employer, to discover that, invariably, these same lamenting young
men were those who, from the employer's point of view, were either greatly
overpaid or so entirely worthless as to be marked for early decapitation.</p>
<p>Bok felt that this constant thought of the wages earned or deserved was
putting the cart before the horse; he had schooled himself into the belief that
if he did his work well, and accomplished more than was expected of him, the
question of wages would take care of itself. But, according to the talk on
every side, it was he who had the cart before the horse. Bok had not only tried
always to fill the particular job set for him but had made it a rule at the
same time to study the position just ahead, to see what it was like, what it
demanded, and then, as the opportunity presented itself, do a part of that job
in addition to his own. As a stenographer, he tried always to clear off the
day's work before he closed his desk. This was not always possible, but he kept
it before him as a rule to be followed rather than violated.</p>
<p>One morning Bok's employer happened to come to the office earlier than
usual, to find the letters he had dictated late in the afternoon before lying
on his desk ready to be signed.</p>
<p>"These are the letters I gave you late yesterday afternoon, are they not?"
asked the employer.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Must have started early this morning, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," answered Bok. "I wrote them out last evening before I left."</p>
<p>"Like to get your notes written out before they get stale?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Good idea," said the employer.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," answered Bok, "and I think it is even a better idea to get a
day's work off before I take my apron off."</p>
<p>"Well said," answered the employer, and the following payday Bok found an
increase in his weekly envelope.</p>
<p>It is only fair, however, to add here, parenthetically, that it is neither
just nor considerate to a conscientious stenographer for an employer to delay
his dictation until the end of the day's work, when, merely by judicious
management of his affairs and time, he can give his dictation directly after
opening his morning mail. There are two sides to every question; but sometimes
the side of the stenographer is not kept in mind by the employer.</p>
<p>Bok found it a uniform rule among his fellow-workers to do exactly the
opposite to his own idea; there was an astonishing unanimity in working by the
clock; where the hour of closing was five o'clock the preparations began five
minutes before, with the hat and overcoat over the back of the chair ready for
the stroke of the hour. This concert of action was curiously universal, no
"overtime" was ever to be thought of, and, as occasionally happened when the
work did go over the hour, it was not, to use the mildest term, done with care,
neatness, or accuracy; it was, to use a current phrase, "slammed off." Every
moment beyond five o'clock in which the worker was asked to do anything was by
just so much an imposition on the part of the employer, and so far as it could
be safely shown, this impression was gotten over to him.</p>
<p>There was an entire unwillingness to let business interfere with any
anticipated pleasure or personal engagement. The office was all right between
nine and five; one had to be there to earn a living; but after five, it was not
to be thought of for one moment. The elevators which ran on the stroke of five
were never large enough to hold the throng which besieged them.</p>
<p>The talk during lunch hour rarely, if ever, turned toward business, except
as said before, when it dealt with underpaid services. In the spring and summer
it was invariably of baseball, and scores of young men knew the batting
averages of the different players and the standing of the clubs with far
greater accuracy than they knew the standing or the discounts of the customers
of their employers. In the winter the talk was all of dancing, boxing, or
plays.</p>
<p>It soon became evident to Bok why scarcely five out of every hundred of the
young men whom he knew made any business progress. They were not interested; it
was a case of a day's work and a day's pay; it was not a question of how much
one could do but how little one could get away with. The thought of how well
one might do a given thing never seemed to occur to the average mind.</p>
<p>"Oh, what do you care?" was the favorite expression. "The boss won't notice
it if you break your back over his work; you won't get any more pay."</p>
<p>And there the subject was dismissed, and thoroughly dismissed, too.</p>
<p>Eventually, then, Bok learned that the path that led to success was wide
open: the competition was negligible. There was no jostling. In fact, travel on
it was just a trifle lonely. One's fellow-travellers were excellent company,
but they were few! It was one of Edward Bok's greatest surprises, but it was
also one of his greatest stimulants. To go where others could not go, or were
loath to go, where at least they were not, had a tang that savored of the
freshest kind of adventure. And the way was so simple, so much simpler, in
fact, than its avoidance, which called for so much argument, explanation, and
discussion. One had merely to do all that one could do, a little more than one
was asked or expected to do, and immediately one's head rose above the crowd
and one was in an employer's eye--where it is always so satisfying for an
employee to be! And as so few heads lifted themselves above the many, there was
never any danger that they would not be seen.</p>
<p>Of course, Edward Bok had to prove to himself that his conception of
conditions was right. He felt instinctively that it was, however, and with this
stimulus he bucked the line hard. When others played, he worked, fully
convinced that his play-time would come later. Where others shirked, he
assumed. Where others lagged, he accelerated his pace. Where others were
indifferent to things around them, he observed and put away the results for
possible use later. He did not make of himself a pack-horse; what he undertook
he did from interest in it, and that made it a pleasure to him when to others
it was a burden. He instinctively reasoned it out that an unpleasant task is
never accomplished by stepping aside from it, but that, unerringly, it will
return later to be met and done.</p>
<p>Obstacles, to Edward Bok, soon became merely difficulties to be overcome,
and he trusted to his instinct to show him the best way to overcome them. He
soon learned that the hardest kind of work was back of every success; that
nothing in the world of business just happened, but that everything was brought
about, and only in one way--by a willingness of spirit and a determination to
carry through. He soon exploded for himself the misleading and comfortable
theory of luck: the only lucky people, he found, were those who worked hard. To
them, luck came in the shape of what they had earned. There were exceptions
here and there, as there are to every rule; but the majority of these, he soon
found, were more in the seeming than in the reality. Generally speaking--and of
course to this rule there are likewise exceptions, or as the Frenchman said,
"All generalizations are false, including this one"--a man got in this world
about what he worked for.</p>
<p>And that became, for himself, the rule of Edward Bok's life.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_15">XII. Baptism Under
Fire</a></h3>
<p>The personnel of the Scribner house was very youthful from the members of
the firm clear down the line. It was veritably a house of young men.</p>
<p>The story is told of a Boston publisher, sedate and fairly elderly, who came
to the Scribner house to transact business with several of its departments. One
of his errands concerning itself with advertising, he was introduced to Bok,
who was then twenty-four. Looking the youth over, he transacted his business as
well as he felt it could be transacted with a manager of such tender years, and
then sought the head of the educational department: this brought him to another
young man of twenty-four.</p>
<p>With his yearnings for some one more advanced in years full upon him, the
visitor now inquired for the business manager of the new magazine, only to find
a man of twenty-six. His next introduction was to the head of the out-of-town
business department, who was twenty-seven.</p>
<p>At this point the Boston man asked to see Mr. Scribner. This disclosed to
him Mr. Arthur H. Scribner, the junior partner, who owned to twenty-eight
summers. Mustering courage to ask faintly for Mr. Charles Scribner himself, he
finally brought up in that gentleman's office only to meet a man just turning
thirty-three!</p>
<p>"This is a young-looking crowd," said Mr. Scribner one day, looking over his
young men. And his eye rested on Bok. "Particularly you, Bok. Doubleday looks
his years better than you do, for at least he has a moustache." Then,
contemplatively: "You raise a moustache, Bok, and I'll raise your salary."</p>
<p>This appealed to Bok very strongly, and within a month he pointed out the
result to his employer. "Stand in the light here," said Mr. Scribner. "Well,
yes," he concluded dubiously, "it's there--something at least. All right; I'll
keep my part of the bargain."</p>
<p>He did. But the next day he was nonplussed to see that the moustache had
disappeared from the lip of his youthful advertising manager. "Couldn't quite
stand it, Mr. Scribner," was the explanation. "Besides, you didn't say I should
keep it: you merely said to raise it."</p>
<p>But the increase did not follow the moustache. To Bok's great relief, it
stuck!</p>
<p>This youthful personnel, while it made for esprit de corps, had also its
disadvantages. One day as Bok was going out to lunch, he found a small-statured
man, rather plainly dressed, wandering around the retail department, hoping for
a salesman to wait on him. The young salesman on duty, full of inexperience,
had a ready smile and quick service ever ready for "carriage trade," as he
called it; but this particular customer had come afoot, and this, together with
his plainness of dress, did not impress the young salesman. His attention was
called to the wandering customer, and it was suggested that he find out what
was wanted. When Bok returned from lunch, the young salesman, who, with a
beaming smile, had just most ceremoniously bowed the plainly dressed little
customer out of the street-door, said: "You certainly struck it rich that time
when you suggested my waiting on that little man! Such an order! Been here ever
since. Did you know who it was?"</p>
<p>"No," returned Bok. "Who was it?"</p>
<p>"Andrew Carnegie," beamed the salesman.</p>
<p>Another youthful clerk in the Scribner retail bookstore, unconscious of the
customer's identity, waited one day on the wife of Mark Twain.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens asked the young salesman for a copy of Taine's Ancient
Regime.</p>
<p>"Beg pardon," said the clerk, "what book did you say?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens repeated the author and title of the book.</p>
<p>Going to the rear of the store, the clerk soon returned, only to inquire:
"May I ask you to repeat the name of the author?"</p>
<p>"Taine, T-a-i-n-e," replied Mrs. Clemens.</p>
<p>Then did the youthfulness of the salesman assert itself. Assuming an air of
superior knowledge, and looking at the customer with an air of sympathy, he
corrected Mrs. Clemens:</p>
<p>"Pardon me, madam, but you have the name a trifle wrong. You mean Twain-not
Taine."</p>
<p>With so many young men of the same age, there was a natural sense of
team-work and a spirit of comradeship that made for successful co-operation.
This spirit extended outside of business hours. At luncheon there was a
Scribner table in a neighboring restaurant, and evenings saw the Scribner
department heads mingling as friends. It was a group of young men who
understood and liked each other, with the natural result that business went
easier and better because of it.</p>
<p>But Bok did not have much time for evening enjoyment, since his outside
interests had grown and prospered and they kept him busy. His syndicate was
regularly supplying over a hundred newspapers: his literary letter had become
an established feature in thirty different newspapers.</p>
<p>Of course, his opportunities for making this letter interesting were
unusual. Owing to his Scribner connection, however, he had taken his name from
the letter and signed that of his brother. He had, also, constantly to
discriminate between the information that he could publish without violation of
confidence and that which he felt he was not at liberty to print. This gave him
excellent experience; for the most vital of all essentials in the journalist is
the ability unerringly to decide what to print and what to regard as
confidential.</p>
<p>Of course, the best things that came to him he could not print. Whenever
there was a question, he gave the benefit of the doubt to the confidential
relation in which his position placed him with authors; and his Dutch caution,
although it deprived him of many a toothsome morsel for his letter, soon became
known to his confreres, and was a large asset when, as an editor, he had to
follow the golden rule of editorship that teaches one to keep the ears open but
the mouth shut.</p>
<p>This Alpha and Omega of all the commandments in the editorial creed some
editors learn by sorrowful experience. Bok was, again, fortunate in learning it
under the most friendly auspices. He continued to work without sparing himself,
but his star remained in the ascendency. Just how far a man's own efforts and
standards keep a friendly star centred over his head is a question. But Edward
Bok has always felt that he was materially helped by fortuitous conditions not
of his own creation or choice.</p>
<p>He was now to receive his first public baptism of fire. He had published a
symposium, through his newspaper syndicate, discussing the question, "Should
Clergymen Smoke?" He had induced all the prominent clergymen in the country to
contribute their views, and so distinguished was the list that the article
created widespread attention.</p>
<p>One of the contributors was the Reverend Richard S. Storrs, D.D., one of the
most distinguished of Brooklyn's coterie of clergy of that day. A few days
after the publication of the article, Bok was astounded to read in the Brooklyn
Eagle a sensational article, with large headlines, in which Doctor Storrs
repudiated his contribution to the symposium, declared that he had never
written or signed such a statement, and accused Edward Bok of forgery.</p>
<p>Coming from a man of Doctor Storrs's prominence, the accusation was, of
course, a serious one. Bok realized this at once. He foresaw the damage it
might work to the reputation of a young man trying to climb the ladder of
success, and wondered why Doctor Storrs had seen fit to accuse him in this
public manner instead of calling upon him for a personal explanation. He
thought perhaps he might find such a letter from Doctor Storrs when he reached
home, but instead he met a small corps of reporters from the Brooklyn and New
York newspapers. He told them frankly that no one was more surprised at the
accusation than he, but that the original contributions were in the New York
office of the syndicate, and he could not corroborate his word until he had
looked into the papers and found Doctor Storrs's contribution.</p>
<p>That evening Bok got at the papers in the case, and found out that,
technically, Doctor Storrs was right: he had not written or signed such a
statement. The compiler of the symposium, the editor of one of New York's
leading evening papers whom Bok had employed, had found Doctor Storrs's
declaration in favor of a clergyman's use of tobacco in an address made some
time before, had extracted it and incorporated it into the symposium. It was,
therefore, Doctor Storrs's opinion on the subject, but not written for the
occasion for which it was used. Bok felt that his editor had led him into an
indiscretion. Yet the sentiments were those of the writer whose name was
attached to them, so that the act was not one of forgery. The editor explained
that he had sent the extract to Doctor Storrs, who had not returned it, and he
had taken silence to mean consent to the use of the material.</p>
<p>Bok decided to say nothing until he heard from Doctor Storrs personally, and
so told the newspapers. But the clergyman did not stop his attack. Of course,
the newspapers egged him on and extracted from him the further accusation that
Bok's silence proved his guilt. Bok now took the case to Mr. Beecher, and asked
his advice.</p>
<p>"Well, Edward, you are right and you are wrong," said Mr. Beecher. "And so
is Storrs, of course. It is beneath him to do what he has done. Storrs and I
are not good friends, as you know, and so I cannot go to him and ask him the
reason of his disclaimer. Otherwise I would. Of course, he may have forgotten
his remarks: that is always possible in a busy man's life. He may not have
received the letter enclosing them. That is likewise possible. But I have a
feeling that Storrs has some reason for wishing to repudiate his views on this
subject just at this time. What it is I do not, of course, know, but his
vehemence makes me think so. I think I should let him have his rein. Keep you
quiet. It may damage you a little here and there, but in the end it won't harm
you. In the main point, you are right. You are not a forger. The sentiments are
his and he uttered them, and he should stand by them. He threatens to bring you
into court, I see from to-day's paper. Wait until he does so."</p>
<p>Bok, chancing to meet Doctor Talmage, told him Mr. Beecher's advice, and he
endorsed it. "Remember, boy," said Doctor Talmage, "silence is never so golden
as when you are under fire. I know, for I have been there, as you know, more
than once. Keep quiet; and always believe this: that there is a great deal of
common sense abroad in the world, and a man is always safe in trusting it to do
him justice."</p>
<p>They were not pleasant and easy days for Bok, for Doctor Storrs kept up the
din for several days. Bok waited for the word to appear in court. But this
never came, and the matter soon died down and out. And, although Bok met the
clergyman several times afterward in the years that followed, no reference was
ever made by him to the incident.</p>
<p>But Edward Bok had learned a valuable lesson of silence under fire--an
experience that was to stand him in good stead when he was again publicly
attacked not long afterward.</p>
<p>This occurred in connection with a notable anniversary celebration in honor
of Henry Ward Beecher, in which the entire city of Brooklyn was to participate.
It was to mark a mile-stone in Mr. Beecher's ministry and in his pastorate of
Plymouth Church. Bok planned a worldwide tribute to the famed clergyman: he
would get the most distinguished men and women of this and other countries to
express their esteem for the Plymouth pastor in written congratulations, and he
would bind these into a volume for presentation to Mr. Beecher on the occasion.
He consulted members of the Beecher family, and, with their acquiescence, began
to assemble the material. He was in the midst of the work when Henry Ward
Beecher passed away. Bok felt that the tributes already received were too
wonderful to be lost to the world, and, after again consulting Mrs. Beecher and
her children, he determined to finish the collection and publish it as a
memorial for private distribution. After a prodigious correspondence, the work
was at last completed; and in June, 1887, the volume was published, in a
limited edition of five hundred copies. Bok distributed copies of the volume to
the members of Mr. Beecher's family, he had orders from Mr. Beecher's friends,
one hundred copies were offered to the American public and one hundred copies
were issued in an English edition.</p>
<p>With such a figure to whom to do honor, the contributors, of course,
included the foremost men and women of the time. Grover Cleveland was then
President of the United States, and his tribute was a notable one. Mr.
Gladstone, the Duke of Argyll, Pasteur, Canon Farrar, Bartholdi, Salvini, and a
score of others represented English and European opinion. Oliver Wendell
Holmes, John Greenleaf Whittier, T. De Witt Talmage, Robert G. Ingersoll,
Charles Dudley Warner, General Sherman, Julia Ward Howe, Andrew Carnegie, Edwin
Booth, Rutherford B. Hayes--there was scarcely a leader of thought and of
action of that day unrepresented. The edition was, of course, quickly
exhausted; and when to-day a copy occasionally appears at an auction sale, it
is sold at a high price.</p>
<p>The newspapers gave very large space to the distinguished memorial, and this
fact angered a journalist, Joseph Howard, Junior, a man at one time close to
Mr. Beecher, who had befriended him. Howard had planned to be the first in the
field with a hastily prepared biography of the great preacher, and he felt that
Bok had forestalled him. Forthwith, he launched a vicious attack on the
compiler of the memorial, accusing him of "making money out of Henry Ward
Beecher's dead body" and of "seriously offending the family of Mr. Beecher, who
had had no say in the memorial, which was therefore without authority, and
hence extremely distasteful to all."</p>
<p>Howard had convinced a number of editors of the justice of his position, and
so he secured a wide publication for his attack. For the second time, Edward
Bok was under fire, and remembering his action on the previous occasion, he
again remained silent, and again the argument was put forth that his silence
implied guilt. But Mrs. Beecher and members of the Beecher family did not
observe silence, and quickly proved that not only had Bok compiled the memorial
as a labor of love and had lost money on it, but that he had the full consent
of the family in its preparation.</p>
<p>When, shortly afterward, Howard's hastily compiled "biography" of Mr.
Beecher appeared, a reporter asked Mrs. Beecher whether she and her family had
found it accurate.</p>
<p>"Accurate, my child," said Mrs. Beecher. "Why, it is so accurate in its
absolute falsity that neither I nor the boys can find one fact or date given
correctly, although we have studied it for two days. Even the year of Mr.
Beecher's birth is wrong, and that is the smallest error!"</p>
<p>Edward Bok little dreamed that these two experiences with public criticism
were to serve him as a foretaste of future attacks when he would get the
benefit of hundreds of pencils especially sharpened for him.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_16">XIII. Publishing Incidents and
Anecdotes</a></h3>
<p>One evening some literary men were dining together previous to going to a
private house where a number of authors were to give readings from their books.
At the table the talk turned on the carelessness with which the public reads
books. Richard Harding Davis, one of the party, contended that the public read
more carefully than the others believed. It was just at the time when Du
Maurier's Trilby was in every one's hands.</p>
<p>"Don't you believe it," said one of the diners. "I'll warrant you could take
a portion of some well-known story to-night and palm it off on most of your
listeners as new stuff."</p>
<p>"Done," said Davis. "Come along, and I'll prove you wrong."</p>
<p>The reading was to be at the house of John Kendrick Bangs at Yonkers. When
Davis's "turn" in the programme came, he announced that he would read a portion
from an unpublished story written by himself. Immediately there was a flutter
in the audience, particularly among the younger element.</p>
<p>Pulling a roll of manuscript out of his pocket, Davis began:</p>
<p>"It was a fine, sunny, showery day in April. The big studio window--"</p>
<p>He got no farther. Almost the entire audience broke into a shout of laughter
and applause. Davis had read thirteen of the opening words of Trilby.</p>
<p>All publishing houses employ "readers" outside of those in their own offices
for the reading of manuscripts on special subjects. One of these "outside
readers" was given a manuscript for criticism. He took it home and began its
reading. He had finished only a hundred pages or so when, by a curious
coincidence, the card of the author of the manuscript was brought to the
"reader." The men were close friends.</p>
<p>Hastily gathering up the manuscript, the critic shoved the work into a
drawer of his desk, and asked that his friend be shown in.</p>
<p>The evening was passed in conversation; as the visitor rose to leave, his
host, rising also and seating himself on his desk, asked:</p>
<p>"What have you been doing lately? Haven't seen much of you."</p>
<p>"No," said the friend. "It may interest you to know that I have been turning
to literary work, and have just completed what I consider to be an important
book."</p>
<p>"Really?" commented the "reader."</p>
<p>"Yes," went on his friend. "I submitted it a few days ago to one of the big
publishing houses. But, great Scott, you can never tell what these publishers
will do with a thing of that sort. They give their manuscripts to all kinds of
fools to read. I suppose, by this time, some idiot, who doesn't know a thing of
the subject about which I have written, is sitting on my manuscript."</p>
<p>Mechanically, the "reader" looked at the desk upon which he was sitting,
thought of the manuscript lying in the drawer directly under him, and said:</p>
<p>"Yes, that may be. Quite likely, in fact."</p>
<p>Of no novel was the secret of the authorship ever so well kept as was that
of The Breadwinners, which, published anonymously in 1883, was the talk of
literary circles for a long time, and speculation as to its authorship was
renewed in the newspapers for years afterward. Bok wanted very much to find out
the author's name so that he could announce it in his literary letter. He had
his suspicions, but they were not well founded until an amusing little incident
occurred which curiously revealed the secret to him.</p>
<p>Bok was waiting to see one of the members of a publishing firm when a
well-known English publisher, visiting in America, was being escorted out of
the office, the conversation continuing as the two gentlemen walked through the
outer rooms. "My chief reason," said the English publisher, as he stopped at
the end of the outer office where Bok was sitting, "for hesitating at all about
taking an English set of plates of the novel you speak of is because it is of
anonymous authorship, a custom of writing which has grown out of all decent
proportions in your country since the issue of that stupid book, The
Breadwinners."</p>
<p>As these last words were spoken, a man seated at a desk directly behind the
speaker looked up, smiled, and resumed reading a document which he had dropped
in to sign. A smile also spread over the countenance of the American publisher
as he furtively glanced over the shoulder of the English visitor and caught the
eye of the smiling man at the desk.</p>
<p>Bok saw the little comedy, realized at once that he had discovered the
author of The Breadwinners, and stated to the publisher that he intended to use
the incident in his literary letter. But it proved to be one of those
heart-rending instances of a delicious morsel of news that must be withheld
from the journalist's use. The publisher acknowledged that Bok had happened
upon the true authorship, but placed him upon his honor to make no use of the
incident. And Bok learned again the vital journalistic lesson that there are a
great many things in the world that the journalist knows and yet cannot write
about. He would have been years in advance of the announcement finally made
that John Hay wrote the novel.</p>
<p>At another time, while waiting, Bok had an experience which, while
interesting, was saddening instead of amusing. He was sitting in Mark Twain's
sitting-room in his home in Hartford waiting for the humorist to return from a
walk. Suddenly sounds of devotional singing came in through the open window
from the direction of the outer conservatory. The singing was low, yet the sad
tremor in the voice seemed to give it special carrying power.</p>
<p>"You have quite a devotional servant," Bok said to a maid who was dusting
the room.</p>
<p>"Oh, that is not a servant who is singing, sir," was the answer. "You can
step to this window and see for yourself."</p>
<p>Bok did so, and there, sitting alone on one of the rustic benches in the
flower-house, was a small, elderly woman. Keeping time with the first finger of
her right hand, as if with a baton, she was slightly swaying her frail body as
she sang, softly yet sweetly, Charles Wesley's hymn, "Jesus, Lover of My Soul,"
and Sarah Flower Adams's "Nearer, My God, to Thee."</p>
<p>But the singer was not a servant. It was Harriet Beecher Stowe!</p>
<p>On another visit to Hartford, shortly afterward, Bok was just turning into
Forrest Street when a little old woman came shambling along toward him,
unconscious, apparently, of people or surroundings. In her hand she carried a
small tree-switch. Bok did not notice her until just as he had passed her he
heard her calling to him: "Young man, young man." Bok retraced his steps, and
then the old lady said: "Young man, you have been leaning against something
white," and taking her tree-switch she whipped some wall dust from the sleeve
of Bok's coat. It was not until that moment that Bok recognized in his
self-appointed "brush" no less a personage than Harriet Beecher Stowe.</p>
<p>"This is Mrs. Stowe, is it not?" he asked, after tendering his thanks to
her.</p>
<p>Those blue eyes looked strangely into his as she answered:</p>
<p>"That is my name, young man. I live on this street. Are you going to have me
arrested for stopping you?" with which she gathered up her skirts and quickly
ran away, looking furtively over her shoulder at the amazed young man,
sorrowfully watching the running figure!</p>
<p>Speaking of Mrs. Stowe brings to mind an unscrupulous and yet ingenious
trick just about this time played by a young man attached to one of the New
York publishing houses. One evening at dinner this chap happened to be in a
bookish company when the talk turned to the enthusiasm of the Southern negro
for an illustrated Bible. The young publishing clerk listened intently, and
next day he went to a Bible publishing house in New York which issued a Bible
gorgeous with pictures and entered into an arrangement with the proprietors
whereby he should have the Southern territory. He resigned his position, and
within a week he was in the South. He made arrangements with an artist friend
to make a change in each copy of the Bible which he contracted for. The angels
pictured therein were white in color. He had these made black, so he could show
that there were black angels as well as white ones. The Bibles cost him just
eighty cents apiece. He went about the South and offered the Bibles to the
astonished and open-mouthed negroes for eight dollars each, two dollars and a
half down and the rest in monthly payments. His sales were enormous. Then he
went his rounds all over again and offered to close out the remaining five
dollars and a half due him by a final payment of two dollars and a half each.
In nearly every case the bait was swallowed, and on each Bible he thus cleared
four dollars and twenty cents net!</p>
<p>Running the elevator in the building where a prominent publishing firm had
its office was a negro of more than ordinary intelligence. The firm had just
published a subscription book on mechanical engineering, a chapter of which was
devoted to the construction and operation of passenger elevators. One of the
agents selling the book thought he might find a customer in Washington.</p>
<p>"Wash," said the book-agent, "you ought to buy a copy of this book, do you
know it?"</p>
<p>"No, boss, don't want no books. Don't git no time fo' readin' books,"
drawled Wash. "It teks all mah time to run dis elevator."</p>
<p>"But this book will help you to run your elevator. See here: there's a whole
chapter here on elevators," persisted the canvasser.</p>
<p>"Don't want no help to run dis elevator," said the darky. "Dis elevator runs
all right now."</p>
<p>"But," said the canvasser, "this will help you to run it better. You will
know twice as much when you get through."</p>
<p>"No, boss, no, dat's just it," returned Wash. "Don't want to learn nothing,
boss," he said. "Why, boss, I know more now than I git paid for."</p>
<p>There was one New York newspaper that prided itself on its huge circulation,
and its advertising canvassers were particularly insistent in securing the
advertisements of publishers. Of course, the real purpose of the paper was to
secure a certain standing for itself, which it lacked, rather than to be of any
service to the publishers.</p>
<p>By dint of perseverance, its agents finally secured from one of the ten-cent
magazines, then so numerous, a large advertisement of a special number, and in
order to test the drawing power of the newspaper as a medium, there was
inserted a line in large black type:</p>
<p>"SEND TEN CENTS FOR A NUMBER."</p>
<p>But the compositor felt that magazine literature should be even cheaper than
it was, and to that thought in his mind his fingers responded, so that when the
advertisement appeared, this particular bold-type line read:</p>
<p>"SEND TEN CENTS FOR A YEAR."</p>
<p>This wonderful offer appealed with singular force to the class of readers of
this particular paper, and they decided to take advantage of it. The
advertisement appeared on Sunday, and Monday's first mail brought the magazine
over eight hundred letters with ten cents enclosed "for a year's subscription
as per your advertisement in yesterday's --." The magazine management consulted
its lawyer, who advised the publisher to make the newspaper pay the extra
ninety cents on each subscription, and, although this demand was at first
refused, the proprietors of the daily finally yielded. At the end of the first
week eight thousand and fifty-five letters with ten cents enclosed had reached
the magazine, and finally the total was a few over twelve thousand!</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_17">XIV. Last Years in New
York</a></h3>
<p>Edward Bok's lines were now to follow those of advertising for several
years. He was responsible for securing the advertisements for The Book Buyer
and The Presbyterian Review. While the former was, frankly, a house-organ, its
editorial contents had so broadened as to make the periodical of general
interest to book-lovers, and with the subscribers constituting the valuable
list of Scribner book-buyers, other publishers were eager to fish in the
Scribner pond.</p>
<p>With The Presbyterian Review, the condition was different. A magazine issued
quarterly naturally lacks the continuity desired by the advertiser; the scope
of the magazine was limited, and so was the circulation. It was a difficult
magazine to "sell" to the advertiser, and Bok's salesmanship was taxed to the
utmost. Although all that the publishers asked was that the expense of getting
out the periodical be met, with its two hundred and odd pages even this was
difficult. It was not an attractive proposition.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature of the magazine to Bok appeared to be the
method of editing. It was ostensibly edited by a board, but, practically, by
Professor Francis L. Patton, D.D., of Princeton Theological Seminary (afterward
president of Princeton University), and Doctor Charles A. Briggs, of Union
Theological Seminary. The views of these two theologians differed rather
widely, and when, upon several occasions, they met in Bok's office, on bringing
in their different articles to go into the magazine, lively discussions ensued.
Bok did not often get the drift of these discussions, but he was intensely
interested in listening to the diverse views of the two theologians.</p>
<p>One day the question of heresy came up between the two men, and during a
pause in the discussion, Bok, looking for light, turned to Doctor Briggs and
asked: "Doctor, what really is heresy?"</p>
<p>Doctor Briggs, taken off his guard for a moment, looked blankly at his young
questioner, and repeated: "What is heresy?"</p>
<p>"Yes," repeated Bok, "just what is heresy, Doctor?"</p>
<p>"That's right," interjected Doctor Patton, with a twinkle in his eyes, "what
is heresy, Briggs?"</p>
<p>"Would you be willing to write it down for me?" asked Bok, fearful that he
should not remember Doctor Briggs's definition even if he were told.</p>
<p>And Doctor Briggs wrote:</p>
<p>"Heresy is anything in doctrine or practice that departs from the mind of
the Church as officially defined.</p>
<p>Charles A. Briggs.</p>
<p>"Let me see," asked Doctor Patton, and when he read it, he muttered: "Humph,
pretty broad, pretty broad."</p>
<p>"Well," answered the nettled Doctor Briggs, "perhaps you can give a less
broad definition, Patton."</p>
<p>"No, no," answered the Princeton theologian, as the slightest wink came from
the eye nearest Bok, "I wouldn't attempt it for a moment. Too much for me."</p>
<p>On another occasion, as the two were busy in their discussion of some
article to be inserted in the magazine, Bok listening with all his might,
Doctor Patton, suddenly turning to the young listener, asked, in the midst of
the argument: "Whom are the Giants going to play this afternoon, Bok?"</p>
<p>Doctor Briggs's face was a study. For a moment the drift of the question was
an enigma to him: then realizing that an important theological discussion had
been interrupted by a trivial baseball question, he gathered up his papers and
stamped violently out of the office. Doctor Patton made no comment, but, with a
smile, he asked Bok: "Johnnie Ward going to play to-day, do you know? Thought I
might ask Mr. Scribner if you could go up to the game this afternoon."</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to say to which of the two men Bok was the more attracted,
and when it came, each quarter, to figuring how many articles could go into the
Review without exceeding the cost limit fixed by the house, it was always a
puzzle to Doctor Briggs why the majority of the articles left out were
invariably those that he had brought in, while many of those which Doctor
Patton handed in somehow found their place, upon the final assembling, among
the contents.</p>
<p>"Your articles are so long," Bok would explain.</p>
<p>"Long?" Doctor Briggs would echo. "You don't measure theological discussions
by the yardstick, young man."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," the young assembler would maintain.</p>
<p>But we have to do some measuring here by the composition-stick, just the
same."</p>
<p>And the Union Seminary theologian was never able successfully, to vault that
hurdle!</p>
<p>From his boyhood days (up to the present writing) Bok was a pronounced
baseball "fan," and so Doctor Patton appealed to a warm place in the young
man's heart when he asked him the questions about the New York baseball team.
There was, too, a baseball team among the Scribner young men of which Bok was a
part. This team played, each Saturday afternoon, a team from another publishing
house, and for two seasons it was unbeatable. Not only was this baseball
aggregation close to the hearts of the Scribner employees, but, in an important
game, the junior member of the firm played on it and the senior member was a
spectator. Frank N. Doubleday played on first base; William D. Moffat, later of
Moffat, Yard Company, and now editor of The Mentor, was behind the bat; Bok
pitched; Ernest Dressel North, the present authority on rare editions of books,
was in the field, as were also Ray Safford, now a director in the Scribner
corporation, and Owen W. Brewer, at present a prominent figure in Chicago's
book world. It was a happy group, all closely banded together in their business
interests and in their human relations as well.</p>
<p>With Scribner's Magazine now in the periodical field, Bok would be asked on
his trips to the publishing houses to have an eye open for advertisements for
that periodical as well. Hence his education in the solicitation of
advertisements became general, and gave him a sympathetic understanding of the
problems of the advertising solicitor which was to stand him in good stead
when, in his later experience, he was called upon to view the business problems
of a magazine from the editor's position. His knowledge of the manufacture of
the two magazines in his charge was likewise educative, as was the fascinating
study of typography which always had, and has today, a wonderful attraction for
him.</p>
<p>It was, however, in connection with the advertising of the general books of
the house, and in his relations with their authors, that Bok found his greatest
interest. It was for him to find the best manner in which to introduce to the
public the books issued by the house, and the general study of the psychology
of publicity which this called for attracted Bok greatly.</p>
<p>Bok was now asked to advertise a novel published by the Scribners which,
when it was issued, and for years afterward, was pointed to as a proof of the
notion that a famous name was all that was necessary to ensure the acceptance
of a manuscript by even a leading publishing house. The facts in the case were
that this manuscript was handed in one morning by a friend of the house with
the remark that he submitted it at the suggestion of the author, who did not
desire that his identity should be known until after the manuscript had been
read and passed upon by the house. It was explained that the writer was not a
famous author; in fact, he had never written anything before; this was his
first book of any sort; he merely wanted to "try his wings." The manuscript was
read in due time by the Scribner readers, and the mutual friend was advised
that the house would be glad to publish the novel, and was ready to execute and
send a contract to the author if the firm knew in whose name the agreement
should be made. Then came the first intimation of the identity of the author:
the friend wrote that if the publishers would look in the right-hand corner of
the first page of the manuscript they would find there the author's name.
Search finally revealed an asterisk. The author of the novel (Valentino) was
William Waldorf Astor.</p>
<p>Although the Scribners did not publish Mark Twain's books, the humorist was
a frequent visitor to the retail store, and occasionally he would wander back
to the publishing department located at the rear of the store, which was then
at 743 Broadway.</p>
<p>Smoking was not permitted in the Scribner offices, and, of course, Mark
Twain was always smoking. He generally smoked a granulated tobacco which he
kept in a long check bag made of silk and rubber. When he sauntered to the back
of the Scribner store, he would generally knock the residue from the bowl of
the pipe, take out the stem, place it in his vest pocket, like a pencil, and
drop the bowl into the bag containing the granulated tobacco. When he wanted to
smoke again (which was usually five minutes later) he would fish out the bowl,
now automatically filled with tobacco, insert the stem, and strike a light. One
afternoon as he wandered into Bok's office, he was just putting his pipe away.
The pipe, of the corncob variety, was very aged and black. Bok asked him
whether it was the only pipe he had.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," Mark answered, "I have several. But they're all like this. I never
smoke a new corncob pipe. A new pipe irritates the throat. No corncob pipe is
fit for anything until it has been used at least a fortnight."</p>
<p>"How do you break in a pipe, then?" asked Bok.</p>
<p>"That's the trick," answered Mark Twain. "I get a cheap man--a man who
doesn't amount to much, anyhow: who would be as well, or better, dead--and pay
him a dollar to break in the pipe for me. I get him to smoke the pipe for a
couple of weeks, then put in a new stem, and continue operations as long as the
pipe holds together."</p>
<p>Bok's newspaper syndicate work had brought him into contact with Fanny
Davenport, then at the zenith of her career as an actress. Miss Davenport, or
Mrs. Melbourne McDowell as she was in private life, had never written for
print; but Bok, seeing that she had something to say about her art and the
ability to say it, induced her to write for the newspapers through his
syndicate. The actress was overjoyed to have revealed to her a hitherto
unsuspected gift; Bok published her articles successfully, and gave her a
publicity that her press agent had never dreamed of. Miss Davenport became
interested in the young publisher, and after watching the methods which he
employed in successfully publishing her writings, decided to try to obtain his
services as her assistant manager. She broached the subject, offered him a five
years' contract for forty weeks' service, with a minimum of fifteen weeks each
year to spend in or near New York, at a salary, for the first year, of three
thousand dollars, increasing annually until the fifth year, when he was to
receive sixty-four hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Bok was attracted to the work: he had never seen the United States, was
anxious to do so, and looked upon the chance as a good opportunity. Miss
Davenport had the contract made out, executed it, and then, in high glee, Bok
took it home to show it to his mother. He had reckoned without question upon
her approval, only to meet with an immediate and decided negative to the
proposition as a whole, general and specific. She argued that the theatrical
business was not for him; and she saw ahead and pointed out so strongly the
mistake he was making that he sought Miss Davenport the next day and told her
of his mother's stand. The actress suggested that she see the mother; she did,
that day, and she came away from the interview a wiser if a sadder woman. Miss
Davenport frankly told Bok that with such an instinctive objection as his
mother seemed to have, he was right to follow her advice and the contract was
not to be thought of.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say whether this was or was not for Bok the turning-point
which comes in the life of every young man. Where the venture into theatrical
life would have led him no one can, of course, say. One thing is certain: Bok's
instinct and reason both failed him in this instance. He believes now that had
his venture into the theatrical field been temporary or permanent, the
experiment, either way, would have been disastrous.</p>
<p>Looking back and viewing the theatrical profession even as it was in that
day (of a much higher order than now), he is convinced he would never have been
happy in it. He might have found this out in a year or more, after the novelty
of travelling had worn off, and asked release from his contract; in that case
he would have broken his line of progress in the publishing business. From
whatever viewpoint he has looked back upon this, which he now believes to have
been the crisis in his life, he is convinced that his mother's instinct saved
him from a grievous mistake.</p>
<p>The Scribner house, in its foreign-book department, had imported some copies
of Bourrienne's Life of Napoleon, and a set had found its way to Bok's desk for
advertising purposes. He took the books home to glance them over, found himself
interested, and sat up half the night to read them. Then he took the set to the
editor of the New York Star, and suggested that such a book warranted a special
review, and offered to leave the work for the literary editor.</p>
<p>"You have read the books?" asked the editor.</p>
<p>"Every word," returned Bok.</p>
<p>"Then, why don't you write the review?" suggested the editor.</p>
<p>This was a new thought to Bok. "Never wrote a review," he said.</p>
<p>"Try it," answered the editor. "Write a column."</p>
<p>"A column wouldn't scratch the surface of this book," suggested the embryo
reviewer.</p>
<p>"Well, give it what it is worth," returned the editor.</p>
<p>Bok did. He wrote a page of the paper.</p>
<p>"Too much, too much," said the editor. "Heavens, man, we've got to get some
news into this paper."</p>
<p>"Very well," returned the reviewer. "Read it, and cut it where you like.
That's the way I see the book."</p>
<p>And next Sunday the review appeared, word for word, as Bok had written it.
His first review had successfully passed!</p>
<p>But Bok was really happiest in that part of his work which concerned itself
with the writing of advertisements. The science of advertisement writing, which
meant to him the capacity to say much in little space, appealed strongly. He
found himself more honestly attracted to this than to the writing of his
literary letter, his editorials, or his book reviewing, of which he was now
doing a good deal. He determined to follow where his bent led; he studied the
mechanics of unusual advertisements wherever he saw them; he eagerly sought a
knowledge of typography and its best handling in an advertisement, and of the
value and relation of illustrations to text. He perceived that his work along
these lines seemed to give satisfaction to his employers, since they placed
more of it in his hands to do; and he sought in every way to become proficient
in the art.</p>
<p>To publishers whose advertisements he secured for the periodicals in his
charge, he made suggestions for the improvement of their announcements, and
found his suggestions accepted. He early saw the value of white space as one of
the most effective factors in advertising; but this was a difficult argument,
he soon found, to convey successfully to others. A white space in an
advertisement was to the average publisher something to fill up; Bok saw in it
something to cherish for its effectiveness. But he never got very far with his
idea: he could not convince (perhaps because he failed to express his ideas
convincingly) his advertisers of what he felt and believed so strongly.</p>
<p>An occasion came in which he was permitted to prove his contention. The
Scribners had published Andrew Carnegie's volume, Triumphant Democracy, and the
author desired that some special advertising should be done in addition to that
allowed by the appropriation made by the house. To Bok's grateful ears came the
injunction from the steel magnate: "Use plenty of white space." In conjunction
with Mr. Doubleday, Bok prepared and issued this extra advertising, and for
once, at least, the wisdom of using white space was demonstrated. But it was
only a flash in the pan. Publishers were unwilling to pay for "unused space,"
as they termed it. Each book was a separate unit, others argued: it was not
like advertising one article continuously in which money could be invested; and
only a limited amount could be spent on a book which ran its course, even at
its best, in a very short time.</p>
<p>And, rightly or wrongly, book advertising has continued much along the same
lines until the present day. In fact, in no department of manufacturing or
selling activity has there been so little progress during the past fifty years
as in bringing books to the notice of the public. In all other lines, the
producer has brought his wares to the public, making it easier and still easier
for it to obtain his goods, while the public, if it wants a book, must still
seek the book instead of being sought by it.</p>
<p>That there is a tremendous unsupplied book demand in this country there is
no doubt: the wider distribution and easier access given to periodicals prove
this point. Now and then there has been tried an unsupported or not
well-thought-out plan for bringing books to a public not now reading them, but
there seems little or no understanding of the fact that there lies an
uncultivated field of tremendous promise to the publisher who will strike out
on a new line and market his books, so that the public will not have to ferret
out a book-store or wind through the maze of a department store. The American
reading public is not the book-reading public that it should be or could be
made to be; but the habit must be made easy for it to acquire. Books must be
placed where the public can readily get at them. It will not, of its own
volition, seek them. It did not do so with magazines; it will not do so with
books.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Bok's literary letter had prospered until it was now
published in some forty-five newspapers. One of these was the Philadelphia
Times. In that paper, each week, the letter had been read by Mr. Cyrus H. K.
Curtis, the owner and publisher of The Ladies' Home Journal. Mr. Curtis had
decided that he needed an editor for his magazine, in order to relieve his
wife, who was then editing it, and he fixed upon the writer of Literary Leaves
as his man. He came to New York, consulted Will Carleton, the poet, and found
that while the letter was signed by William J. Bok, it was actually written by
his brother who was with the Scribners. So he sought Bok out there.</p>
<p>The publishing house had been advertising in the Philadelphia magazine, so
that the visit of Mr. Curtis was not an occasion for surprise. Mr. Curtis told
Bok he had read his literary letter in the Philadelphia Times, and suggested
that perhaps he might write a similar department for The Ladies' Home Journal.
Bok saw no reason why he should not, and told Mr. Curtis so, and promised to
send over a trial installment. The Philadelphia publisher then deftly went on,
explained editorial conditions in his magazine, and, recognizing the ethics of
the occasion by not offering Bok another position while he was already
occupying one, asked him if he knew the man for the place.</p>
<p>"Are you talking at me or through me?" asked Bok.</p>
<p>"Both," replied Mr. Curtis.</p>
<p>This was in April of 1889.</p>
<p>Bok promised Mr. Curtis he would look over the field, and meanwhile he sent
over to Philadelphia the promised trial "literary gossip" installment. It
pleased Mr. Curtis, who suggested a monthly department, to which Bok consented.
He also turned over in his mind the wisdom of interrupting his line of progress
with the Scribners, and in New York, and began to contemplate the possibilities
in Philadelphia and the work there.</p>
<p>He gathered a collection of domestic magazines then published, and looked
them over to see what was already in the field. Then he began to study himself,
his capacity for the work, and the possibility of finding it congenial. He
realized that it was absolutely foreign to his Scribner work: that it meant a
radical departure. But his work with his newspaper syndicate naturally occurred
to him, and he studied it with a view of its adaptation to the field of the
Philadelphia magazine.</p>
<p>His next step was to take into his confidence two or three friends whose
judgment he trusted and discuss the possible change. Without an exception, they
advised against it. The periodical had no standing, they argued; Bok would be
out of sympathy with its general atmosphere after his Scribner environment; he
was now in the direct line of progress in New York publishing houses; and, to
cap the climax, they each argued in turn, he would be buried in Philadelphia:
New York was the centre, etc., etc.</p>
<p>More than any other single argument, this last point destroyed Bok's faith
in the judgment of his friends. He had had experience enough to realize that a
man could not be buried in any city, provided he had the ability to stand out
from his fellow-men. He knew from his biographical reading that cream will rise
to the surface anywhere, in Philadelphia as well as in New York: it all
depended on whether the cream was there: it was up to the man. Had he within
him that peculiar, subtle something that, for the want of a better phrase, we
call the editorial instinct? That was all there was to it, and that decision
had to be his and his alone!</p>
<p>A business trip for the Scribners now calling him West, Bok decided to stop
at Philadelphia, have a talk with Mr. Curtis, and look over his business plant.
He did this, and found Mr. Curtis even more desirous than before to have him
consider the position. Bok's instinct was strongly in favor of an acceptance. A
natural impulse moved him, without reasoning, to action. Reasoning led only to
a cautious mental state, and caution is a strong factor in the Dutch character.
The longer he pursued a conscious process of reasoning, the farther he got from
the position. But the instinct remained strong.</p>
<p>On his way back from the West, he stopped in Philadelphia again to consult
his friend, George W. Childs; and here he found the only person who was ready
to encourage him to make the change.</p>
<p>Bok now laid the matter before his mother, in whose feminine instinct he had
supreme confidence. With her, he met with instant discouragement. But in
subsequent talks he found that her opposition was based not upon the
possibilities inherent in the position, but on a mother's natural
disinclination to be separated from one of her sons. In the case of Fanny
Davenport's offer the mother's instinct was strong against the proposition
itself. But in the present instance it was the mother's love that was speaking;
not her instinct or judgment.</p>
<p>Bok now consulted his business associates, and, to a man, they discouraged
the step, but almost invariably upon the argument that it was suicidal to leave
New York. He had now a glimpse of the truth that there is no man so
provincially narrow as the untravelled New Yorker who believes in his heart
that the sun rises in the East River and sets in the North River.</p>
<p>He realized more keenly than ever before that the decision rested with him
alone. On September 1, 1889, Bok wrote to Mr. Curtis, accepting the position in
Philadelphia; and on October 13 following he left the Scribners, where he had
been so fortunate and so happy, and, after a week's vacation, followed where
his instinct so strongly led, but where his reason wavered.</p>
<p>On October 20, 1889, Edward Bok became the editor of The Ladies' Home
Journal.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_18">XV. Successful
Editorship</a></h3>
<p>There is a popular notion that the editor of a woman's magazine should be a
woman. At first thought, perhaps, this sounds logical. But it is a curious fact
that by far the larger number of periodicals for women, the world over, are
edited by men; and where, as in some cases, a woman is the proclaimed editor,
the direction of the editorial policy is generally in the hands of a man, or
group of men, in the background. Why this is so has never been explained, any
more than why the majority of women's dressmakers are men; why music, with its
larger appeal to women, has been and is still being composed, largely, by men,
and why its greatest instrumental performers are likewise men; and why the
church, with its larger membership of women, still has, as it always has had,
men for its greatest preachers.</p>
<p>In fact, we may well ponder whether the full editorial authority and
direction of a modern magazine, either essentially feminine in its appeal or
not, can safely be entrusted to a woman when one considers how largely
executive is the nature of such a position, and how thoroughly sensitive the
modern editor must be to the hundred and one practical business matters which
today enter into and form so large a part of the editorial duties. We may
question whether women have as yet had sufficient experience in the world of
business to cope successfully with the material questions of a pivotal
editorial position. Then, again, it is absolutely essential in the conduct of a
magazine with a feminine or home appeal to have on the editorial staff women
who are experts in their line; and the truth is that women will work infinitely
better under the direction of a man than of a woman.</p>
<p>It would seem from the present outlook that, for some time, at least, the
so-called woman's magazine of large purpose and wide vision is very likely to
be edited by a man. It is a question, however, whether the day of the woman's
magazine, as we have known it, is not passing. Already the day has gone for the
woman's magazine built on the old lines which now seem so grotesque and feeble
in the light of modern growth. The interests of women and of men are being
brought closer with the years, and it will not be long before they will
entirely merge. This means a constantly diminishing necessity for the
distinctly feminine magazine.</p>
<p>Naturally, there will always be a field in the essentially feminine pursuits
which have no place in the life of a man, but these are rapidly being cared for
by books, gratuitously distributed, issued by the manufacturers of distinctly
feminine and domestic wares; for such publications the best talent is being
employed, and the results are placed within easy access of women, by means of
newspaper advertisement, the store-counter, or the mails. These will sooner or
later--and much sooner than later--supplant the practical portions of the
woman's magazine, leaving only the general contents, which are equally
interesting to men and to women. Hence the field for the magazine with the
essentially feminine appeal is contracting rather than broadening, and it is
likely to contract much more rapidly in the future.</p>
<p>The field was altogether different when Edward Bok entered it in 1889. It
was not only wide open, but fairly crying out to be filled. The day of Godey's
Lady's Book had passed; Peterson's Magazine was breathing its last; and the
home or women's magazines that had attempted to take their place were sorry
affairs. It was this consciousness of a void ready to be filled that made the
Philadelphia experiment so attractive to the embryo editor. He looked over the
field and reasoned that if such magazines as did exist could be fairly
successful, if women were ready to buy such, how much greater response would
there be to a magazine of higher standards, of larger initiative--a magazine
that would be an authoritative clearing-house for all the problems confronting
women in the home, that brought itself closely into contact with those problems
and tried to solve them in an entertaining and efficient way; and yet a
magazine of uplift and inspiration: a magazine, in other words, that would give
light and leading in the woman's world.</p>
<p>The method of editorial expression in the magazines of 1889 was also
distinctly vague and prohibitively impersonal. The public knew the name of
scarcely a single editor of a magazine: there was no personality that stood out
in the mind: the accepted editorial expression was the indefinite "we"; no one
ventured to use the first person singular and talk intimately to the reader.
Edward Bok's biographical reading had taught him that the American public loved
a personality: that it was always ready to recognize and follow a leader,
provided, of course, that the qualities of leadership were demonstrated. He
felt the time had come--the reference here and elsewhere is always to the realm
of popular magazine literature appealing to a very wide audience--for the
editor of some magazine to project his personality through the printed page and
to convince the public that he was not an oracle removed from the people, but a
real human being who could talk and not merely write on paper.</p>
<p>He saw, too, that the average popular magazine of 1889 failed of large
success because it wrote down to the public--a grievous mistake that so many
editors have made and still make. No one wants to be told, either directly or
indirectly, that he knows less than he does, or even that he knows as little as
he does: every one is benefited by the opposite implication, and the public
will always follow the leader who comprehends this bit of psychology. There is
always a happy medium between shooting over the public's head and shooting too
far under it. And it is because of the latter aim that we find the modern
popular magazine the worthless thing that, in so many instances, it is
to-day.</p>
<p>It is the rare editor who rightly gauges his public psychology. Perhaps that
is why, in the enormous growth of the modern magazine, there have been produced
so few successful editors. The average editor is obsessed with the idea of
"giving the public what it wants," whereas, in fact, the public, while it knows
what it wants when it sees it, cannot clearly express its wants, and never
wants the thing that it does ask for, although it thinks it does at the time.
But woe to the editor and his periodical if he heeds that siren voice!</p>
<p>The editor has, therefore, no means of finding it out aforehand by putting
his ear to the ground. Only by the simplest rules of psychology can he edit
rightly so that he may lead, and to the average editor of to-day, it is to be
feared, psychology is a closed book. His mind is all too often focussed on the
circulation and advertising, and all too little on the intangibles that will
bring to his periodical the results essential in these respects.</p>
<p>The editor is the pivot of a magazine. On him everything turns. If his gauge
of the public is correct, readers will come: they cannot help coming to the man
who has something to say himself, or who presents writers who have. And if the
reader comes, the advertiser must come. He must go where his largest market is:
where the buyers are. The advertiser, instead of being the most difficult
factor in a magazine proposition, as is so often mistakenly thought, is, in
reality, the simplest. He has no choice but to advertise in the successful
periodical. He must come along. The editor need never worry about him. If the
advertiser shuns the periodical's pages, the fault is rarely that of the
advertiser: the editor can generally look for the reason nearer home.</p>
<p>One of Edward Bok's first acts as editor was to offer a series of prizes for
the best answers to three questions he put to his readers: what in the magazine
did they like least and why; what did they like best and why; and what omitted
feature or department would they like to see installed? Thousands of answers
came, and these the editor personally read carefully and classified. Then he
gave his readers' suggestions back to them in articles and departments, but
never on the level suggested by them. He gave them the subjects they asked for,
but invariably on a slightly higher plane; and each year he raised the standard
a notch. He always kept "a huckleberry or two" ahead of his readers. His
psychology was simple: come down to the level which the public sets and it will
leave you at the moment you do it. It always expects of its leaders that they
shall keep a notch above or a step ahead. The American public always wants
something a little better than it asks for, and the successful man, in catering
to it, is he who follows this golden rule.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_19">XVI. First Years as a Woman's
Editor</a></h3>
<p>Edward Bok has often been referred to as the one "who made The Ladies' Home
Journal out of nothing," who "built it from the ground up," or, in similar
terms, implying that when he became its editor in 1889 the magazine was
practically non-existent. This is far from the fact. The magazine was begun in
1883, and had been edited by Mrs. Cyrus H. K. Curtis, for six years, under her
maiden name of Louisa Knapp, before Bok undertook its editorship. Mrs. Curtis
had laid a solid foundation of principle and policy for the magazine: it had
achieved a circulation of 440,000 copies a month when she transferred the
editorship, and it had already acquired such a standing in the periodical world
as to attract the advertisements of Charles Scribner's Sons, which Mr.
Doubleday, and later Bok himself, gave to the Philadelphia
magazine--advertising which was never given lightly, or without the most
careful investigation of the worth of the circulation of a periodical.</p>
<p>What every magazine publisher knows as the most troublous years in the
establishment of a periodical, the first half-dozen years of its existence, had
already been weathered by the editor and publisher. The wife as editor and the
husband as publisher had combined to lay a solid basis upon which Bok had only
to build: his task was simply to rear a structure upon the foundation already
laid. It is to the vision and to the genius of the first editor of The Ladies'
Home Journal that the unprecedented success of the magazine is primarily due.
It was the purpose and the policy of making a magazine of authoritative service
for the womanhood of America, a service which would visualize for womanhood its
highest domestic estate, that had won success for the periodical from its
inception. It is difficult to believe, in the multiplicity of similar magazines
to-day, that such a purpose was new; that The Ladies' Home Journal was a
path-finder; but the convincing proof is found in the fact that all the later
magazines of this class have followed in the wake of the periodical conceived
by Mrs. Curtis, and have ever since been its imitators.</p>
<p>When Edward Bok succeeded Mrs. Curtis, he immediately encountered another
popular misconception of a woman's magazine--the conviction that if a man is
the editor of a periodical with a distinctly feminine appeal, he must, as the
term goes, "understand women." If Bok had believed this to be true, he would
never have assumed the position. How deeply rooted is this belief was brought
home to him on every hand when his decision to accept the Philadelphia position
was announced. His mother, knowing her son better than did any one else, looked
at him with amazement. She could not believe that he was serious in his
decision to cater to women's needs when he knew so little about them. His
friends, too, were intensely amused, and took no pains to hide their amusement
from him. They knew him to be the very opposite of "a lady's man," and when
they were not convulsed with hilarity they were incredulous and marvelled.</p>
<p>No man, perhaps, could have been chosen for the position who had a less
intimate knowledge of women. Bok had no sister, no women confidantes: he had
lived with and for his mother. She was the only woman he really knew or who
really knew him. His boyhood days had been too full of poverty and struggle to
permit him to mingle with the opposite sex. And it is a curious fact that
Edward Bok's instinctive attitude toward women was that of avoidance. He did
not dislike women, but it could not be said that he liked them. They had never
interested him. Of women, therefore, he knew little; of their needs less. Nor
had he the slightest desire, even as an editor, to know them better, or to seek
to understand them. Even at that age, he knew that, as a man, he could not, no
matter what effort he might make, and he let it go at that.</p>
<p>What he saw in the position was not the need to know women; he could employ
women for that purpose. He perceived clearly that the editor of a magazine was
largely an executive: his was principally the work of direction; of studying
currents and movements, watching their formation, their tendency, their
efficacy if advocated or translated into actuality; and then selecting from the
horizon those that were for the best interests of the home. For a home was
something Edward Bok did understand. He had always lived in one; had struggled
to keep it together, and he knew every inch of the hard road that makes for
domestic permanence amid adverse financial conditions. And at the home he aimed
rather than at the woman in it.</p>
<p>It was upon his instinct that he intended to rely rather than upon any
knowledge of woman. His first act in the editorial chair of The Ladies' Home
Journal showed him to be right in this diagnosis of himself, for the incident
proved not only how correct was his instinct, but how woefully lacking he was
in any knowledge of the feminine nature.</p>
<p>He had divined the fact that in thousands of cases the American mother was
not the confidante of her daughter, and reasoned if an inviting human
personality could be created on the printed page that would supply this
lamentable lack of American family life, girls would flock to such a figure.
But all depended on the confidence which the written word could inspire. He
tried several writers, but in each case the particular touch that he sought for
was lacking. It seemed so simple to him, and yet he could not translate it to
others. Then, in desperation, he wrote an installment of such a department as
he had in mind himself, intending to show it to a writer he had in view, thus
giving her a visual demonstration. He took it to the office the next morning,
intending to have it copied, but the manuscript accidentally attached itself to
another intended for the composing-room, and it was not until the
superintendent of the composing-room during the day said to him, "I didn't know
Miss Ashmead wrote," that Bok knew where his manuscript had gone.</p>
<p>Miss Ashmead?" asked the puzzled editor.</p>
<p>Yes, Miss Ashmead in your department," was the answer.</p>
<p>The whereabouts of the manuscript was then disclosed, and the editor called
for its return. He had called the department "Side Talks with Girls" by Ruth
Ashmead.</p>
<p>"My girls all hope this is going into the magazine," said the superintendent
when he returned the manuscript.</p>
<p>"Why?" asked the editor.</p>
<p>"Well, they say it's the best stuff for girls they have ever read. They'd
love to know Miss Ashmead better."</p>
<p>Here was exactly what the editor wanted, but he was the author! He changed
the name to Ruth Ashmore, and decided to let the manuscript go into the
magazine. He reasoned that he would then have a month in which to see the
writer he had in mind, and he would show her the proof. But a month filled
itself with other duties, and before the editor was aware of it, the
composition-room wanted "copy" for the second installment of "Side Talks with
Girls." Once more the editor furnished the copy!</p>
<p>Within two weeks after the second article had been written, the magazine
containing the first installment of the new department appeared, and the next
day two hundred letters were received for "Ruth Ashmore," with the mail-clerk
asking where they should be sent. "Leave them with me, please," replied the
editor. On the following day the mail-clerk handed him five hundred more.</p>
<p>The editor now took two letters from the top and opened them. He never
opened the third! That evening he took the bundle home, and told his mother of
his predicament. She read the letters and looked at her son. "You have no right
to read these," she said. The son readily agreed.</p>
<p>His instinct had correctly interpreted the need, but he never dreamed how
far the feminine nature would reveal itself on paper.</p>
<p>The next morning the editor, with his letters, took the train for New York
and sought his friend, Mrs. Isabel A. Mallon, the "Bab" of his popular
syndicate letter.</p>
<p>"Have you read this department?" he asked, pointing to the page in the
magazine.</p>
<p>"I have," answered Mrs. Mallon. "Very well done, too, it is. Who is 'Ruth
Ashmore'?'</p>
<p>"You are," answered Edward Bok. And while it took considerable persuasion,
from that time on Mrs. Mallon became Ruth Ashmore, the most ridiculed writer in
the magazine world, and yet the most helpful editor that ever conducted a
department in periodical literature. For sixteen years she conducted the
department, until she passed away, her last act being to dictate a letter to a
correspondent. In those sixteen years she had received one hundred and
fifty-eight thousand letters: she kept three stenographers busy, and the number
of girls who to-day bless the name of Ruth Ashmore is legion.</p>
<p>But the newspaper humorists who insisted that Ruth Ashmore was none other
than Edward Bok never knew the partial truth of their joke!</p>
<p>The editor soon supplemented this department with one dealing with the
spiritual needs of the mature woman. "The King's Daughters" was then an
organization at the summit of its usefulness, with Margaret Bottome its
president. Edward Bok had heard Mrs. Bottome speak, had met her personally, and
decided that she was the editor for the department he had in mind.</p>
<p>"I want it written in an intimate way as if there were only two persons in
the world, you and the person reading. I want heart to speak to heart. We will
make that the title," said the editor, and unconsciously he thus created the
title that has since become familiar wherever English is spoken: "Heart to
Heart Talks." The title gave the department an instantaneous hearing; the
material in it carried out its spirit, and soon Mrs. Bottome's department
rivaled, in popularity, the page by Ruth Ashmore.</p>
<p>These two departments more than anything else, and the irresistible picture
of a man editing a woman's magazine, brought forth an era of newspaper
paragraphing and a flood of so-called "humorous" references to the magazine and
editor. It became the vogue to poke fun at both. The humorous papers took it
up, the cartoonists helped it along, and actors introduced the name of the
magazine on the stage in plays and skits. Never did a periodical receive such
an amount of gratuitous advertising. Much of the wit was absolutely without
malice: some of it was written by Edward Bok's best friends, who volunteered to
"let up" would he but raise a finger.</p>
<p>But he did not raise the finger. No one enjoyed the "paragraphs" more
heartily when the wit was good, and in that case, if the writer was unknown to
him, he sought him out and induced him to write for him. In this way, George
Fitch was found on the Peoria, Illinois, Transcript and introduced to his
larger public in the magazine and book world through The Ladies' Home Journal,
whose editor he believed he had "most unmercifully roasted";--but he had done
it so cleverly that the editor at once saw his possibilities.</p>
<p>When all his friends begged Bok to begin proceedings against the New York
Evening Sun because of the libellous (?) articles written about him by "The
Woman About Town," the editor admired the style rather than the contents, made
her acquaintance, and secured her as a regular writer: she contributed to the
magazine some of the best things published in its pages. But she did not abate
her opinions of Bok and his magazine in her articles in the newspaper, and Bok
did not ask it of her: he felt that she had a right to her opinions--those he
was not buying; but he was eager to buy her direct style in treating subjects
he knew no other woman could so effectively handle.</p>
<p>And with his own limited knowledge of the sex, he needed, and none knew it
better than did he, the ablest women he could obtain to help him realize his
ideals. Their personal opinions of him did not matter so long as he could
command their best work. Sooner or later, when his purposes were better
understood, they might alter those opinions. For that he could afford to wait.
But he could not wait to get their work.</p>
<p>By this time the editor had come to see that the power of a magazine might
lie more securely behind the printed page than in it. He had begun to accustom
his readers to writing to his editors upon all conceivable problems.</p>
<p>This he decided to encourage. He employed an expert in each line of feminine
endeavor, upon the distinct understanding that the most scrupulous attention
should be given to her correspondence: that every letter, no matter how
inconsequential, should be answered quickly, fully, and courteously, with the
questioner always encouraged to come again if any problem of whatever nature
came to her. He told his editors that ignorance on any question was a
misfortune, not a crime; and he wished their correspondence treated in the most
courteous and helpful spirit.</p>
<p>Step by step, the editor built up this service behind the magazine until he
had a staff of thirty-five editors on the monthly pay-roll; in each issue, he
proclaimed the willingness of these editors to answer immediately any questions
by mail, he encouraged and cajoled his readers to form the habit of looking
upon his magazine as a great clearing-house of information. Before long, the
letters streamed in by the tens of thousands during a year. The editor still
encouraged, and the total ran into the hundreds of thousands, until during the
last year, before the service was finally stopped by the Great War of 1917-18,
the yearly correspondence totalled nearly a million letters.</p>
<p>The work of some of these editors never reached the printed page, and yet
was vastly more important than any published matter could possibly be. Out of
the work of Ruth Ashmore, for instance, there grew a class of cases of the most
confidential nature. These cases, distributed all over the country, called for
special investigation and personal contact. Bok selected Mrs. Lyman Abbott for
this piece of delicate work, and, through the wide acquaintance of her husband,
she was enabled to reach, personally, every case in every locality, and bring
personal help to bear on it. These cases mounted into the hundreds, and the
good accomplished through this quiet channel cannot be overestimated.</p>
<p>The lack of opportunity for an education in Bok's own life led him to cast
about for some plan whereby an education might be obtained without expense by
any one who desired. He finally hit upon the simple plan of substituting free
scholarships for the premiums then so frequently offered by periodicals for
subscriptions secured. Free musical education at the leading conservatories was
first offered to any girl who would secure a certain number of subscriptions to
The Ladies' Home Journal, the complete offer being a year's free tuition, with
free room, free board, free piano in her own room, and all travelling expenses
paid. The plan was an immediate success: the solicitation of a subscription by
a girl desirous of educating herself made an irresistible appeal.</p>
<p>This plan was soon extended, so as to include all the girls' colleges, and
finally all the men's colleges, so that a free education might be possible at
any educational institution. So comprehensive it became that to the close of
1919, one thousand four hundred and fifty-five free scholarships had been
awarded. The plan has now been in operation long enough to have produced some
of the leading singers and instrumental artists of the day, whose names are
familiar to all, as well as instructors in colleges and scores of teachers; and
to have sent several score of men into conspicuous positions in the business
and professional world.</p>
<p>Edward Bok has always felt that but for his own inability to secure an
education, and his consequent desire for self-improvement, the realization of
the need in others might not have been so strongly felt by him, and that his
plan whereby thousands of others were benefited might never have been
realized.</p>
<p>The editor's correspondence was revealing, among other deficiencies, the
wide-spread unpreparedness of the average American girl for motherhood, and her
desperate ignorance when a new life was given her. On the theory that with the
realization of a vital need there is always the person to meet it, Bok
consulted the authorities of the Babies' Hospital of New York, and found Doctor
Emmet Holt's house physician, Doctor Emelyn L. Coolidge. To the authorities in
the world of babies, Bok's discovery was, of course, a known and serious
fact.</p>
<p>Doctor Coolidge proposed that the magazine create a department of questions
and answers devoted to the problems of young mothers. This was done, and from
the publication of the first issue the questions began to come in. Within five
years the department had grown to such proportions that Doctor Coolidge
proposed a plan whereby mothers might be instructed, by mail, in the rearing of
babies--in their general care, their feeding, and the complete hygiene of the
nursery.</p>
<p>Bok had already learned, in his editorial experience, carefully to weigh a
woman's instinct against a man's judgment, but the idea of raising babies by
mail floored him. He reasoned, however, that a woman, and more particularly one
who had been in a babies' hospital for years, knew more about babies than he
could possibly know. He consulted baby-specialists in New York and
Philadelphia, and, with one accord, they declared the plan not only absolutely
impracticable but positively dangerous. Bok's confidence in woman's instinct,
however, persisted, and he asked Doctor Coolidge to map out a plan.</p>
<p>This called for the services of two physicians: Miss Marianna Wheeler, for
many years superintendent of the Babies' Hospital, was to look after the
prospective mother before the baby's birth; and Doctor Coolidge, when the baby
was born, would immediately send to the young mother a printed list of
comprehensive questions, which, when answered, would be immediately followed by
a full set of directions as to the care of the child, including carefully
prepared food formule. At the end of the first month, another set of questions
was to be forwarded for answer by the mother, and this monthly service was to
be continued until the child reached the age of two years. The contact with the
mother would then become intermittent, dependent upon the condition of mother
and child. All the directions and formule were to be used only under the
direction of the mother's attendant physician, so that the fullest cooperation
might be established between the physician on the case and the advisory
department of the magazine.</p>
<p>Despite advice to the contrary, Bok decided, after consulting a number of
mothers, to establish the system. It was understood that the greatest care was
to be exercised: the most expert advice, if needed, was to be sought and given,
and the thousands of cases at the Babies' Hospital were to be laid under
contribution.</p>
<p>There was then begun a magazine department which was to be classed among the
most clear-cut pieces of successful work achieved by The Ladies' Home
Journal.</p>
<p>Step by step, the new departure won its way, and was welcomed eagerly by
thousands of young mothers. It was not long before the warmest commendation
from physicians all over the country was received. Promptness of response and
thoroughness of diagnosis were, of course, the keynotes of the service: where
the cases were urgent, the special delivery post and, later, the night-letter
telegraph service were used.</p>
<p>The plan is now in its eleventh year of successful operation. Some idea of
the enormous extent of its service can be gathered from the amazing figures
that, at the close of the tenth year, show over forty thousand prospective
mothers have been advised, while the number of babies actually "raised" by
Doctor Coolidge approaches eighty thousand. Fully ninety-five of every hundred
of these babies registered have remained under the monthly letter-care of
Doctor Coolidge until their first year, when the mothers receive a diet list
which has proved so effective for future guidance that many mothers cease to
report regularly. Eighty-five out of every hundred babies have remained in the
registry until their graduation at the age of two. Over eight large sets of
library drawers are required for the records of the babies always under the
supervision of the registry.</p>
<p>Scores of physicians who vigorously opposed the work at the start have
amended their opinions and now not only give their enthusiastic endorsement,
but have adopted Doctor Coolidge's food formule for their private and hospital
cases.</p>
<p>It was this comprehensive personal service, built up back of the magazine
from the start, that gave the periodical so firm and unique a hold on its
clientele. It was not the printed word that was its chief power: scores of
editors who have tried to study and diagnose the appeal of the magazine from
the printed page, have remained baffled at the remarkable confidence elicited
from its readers. They never looked back of the magazine, and therefore failed
to discover its secret. Bok went through three financial panics with the
magazine, and while other periodicals severely suffered from diminished
circulation at such times, The Ladies' Home Journal always held its own.
Thousands of women had been directly helped by the magazine; it had not
remained an inanimate printed thing, but had become a vital need in the
personal lives of its readers.</p>
<p>So intimate had become this relation, so efficient was the service rendered,
that its readers could not be pried loose from it; where women were willing and
ready, when the domestic pinch came, to let go of other reading matter, they
explained to their husbands or fathers that The Ladies' Home Journal was a
necessity--they did not feel that they could do without it. The very quality
for which the magazine had been held up to ridicule by the unknowing and
unthinking had become, with hundreds of thousands of women, its source of power
and the bulwark of its success.</p>
<p>Bok was beginning to realize the vision which had lured him from New York:
that of putting into the field of American magazines a periodical that should
become such a clearing-house as virtually to make it an institution.</p>
<p>He felt that, for the present at least, he had sufficiently established the
personal contact with his readers through the more intimate departments, and
decided to devote his efforts to the literary features of the magazine.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_20">XVII. Eugene Field's Practical
Jokes</a></h3>
<p>Eugene Field was one of Edward Bok's close friends and also his despair, as
was likely to be the case with those who were intimate with the Western poet.
One day Field said to Bok: "I am going to make you the most widely paragraphed
man in America." The editor passed the remark over, but he was to recall it
often as his friend set out to make his boast good.</p>
<p>The fact that Bok was unmarried and the editor of a woman's magazine
appealed strongly to Field's sense of humor. He knew the editor's opposition to
patent medicines, and so he decided to join the two facts in a paragraph, put
on the wire at Chicago, to the effect that the editor was engaged to be married
to Miss Lavinia Pinkham, the granddaughter of Mrs. Lydia Pinkham, of
patent-medicine fame. The paragraph carefully described Miss Pinkham, the
school where she had been educated, her talents, her wealth, etc. Field was
wise enough to put the paragraph not in his own column in the Chicago News,
lest it be considered in the light of one of his practical jokes, but on the
news page of the paper, and he had it put on the Associated Press wire.</p>
<p>He followed this up a few days later with a paragraph announcing Bok's
arrival at a Boston hotel. Then came a paragraph saying that Miss Pinkham was
sailing for Paris to buy her trousseau. The paragraphs were worded in the most
matter-of-fact manner, and completely fooled the newspapers, even those of
Boston. Field was delighted at the success of his joke, and the fact that Bok
was in despair over the letters that poured in upon him added to Field's
delight.</p>
<p>He now asked Bok to come to Chicago. "I want you to know some of my
cronies," he wrote. "Julia [his wife] is away, so we will shift for ourselves."
Bok arrived in Chicago one Sunday afternoon, and was to dine at Field's house
that evening. He found a jolly company: James Whitcomb Riley, Sol Smith Russell
the actor, Opie Read, and a number of Chicago's literary men.</p>
<p>When seven o'clock came, some one suggested to Field that something to eat
might not be amiss.</p>
<p>"Shortly," answered the poet. "Wife is out; cook is new, and dinner will be
a little late. Be patient." But at eight o'clock there was still no dinner.
Riley began to grow suspicious and slipped down-stairs. He found no one in the
kitchen and the range cold. He came back and reported. "Nonsense," said Field.
"It can't be." All went down-stairs to find out the truth. "Let's get supper
ourselves," suggested Russell. Then it was discovered that not a morsel of food
was to be found in the refrigerator, closet, or cellar. "That's a joke on us,"
said Field. "Julia has left us without a crumb to eat.</p>
<p>It was then nine o'clock. Riley and Bok held a council of war and decided to
slip out and buy some food, only to find that the front, basement, and back
doors were locked and the keys missing! Field was very sober. "Thorough woman,
that wife of mine," he commented. But his friends knew better.</p>
<p>Finally, the Hoosier poet and the Philadelphia editor crawled through one of
the basement windows and started on a foraging expedition. Of course, Field
lived in a residential section where there were few stores, and on Sunday these
were closed. There was nothing to do but to board a down-town car. Finally they
found a delicatessen shop open, and the two hungry men amazed the proprietor by
nearly buying out his stock.</p>
<p>It was after ten o'clock when Riley and Bok got back to the house with their
load of provisions to find every door locked, every curtain drawn, and the bolt
sprung on every window. Only the cellar grating remained, and through this the
two dropped their bundles and themselves, and appeared in the dining-room,
dirty and dishevelled, to find the party at table enjoying a supper which Field
had carefully hidden and brought out when they had left the house.</p>
<p>Riley, cold and hungry, and before this time the victim of Field's practical
jokes, was not in a merry humor and began to recite paraphrases of Field's
poems. Field retorted by paraphrasing Riley's poems, and mimicking the marked
characteristics of Riley's speech. This started Sol Smith Russell, who mimicked
both. The fun grew fast and furious, the entire company now took part, Mrs.
Field's dresses were laid under contribution, and Field, Russell, and Riley
gave an impromptu play. And it was upon this scene that Mrs. Field, after a
continuous ringing of the door-bell and nearly battering down the door,
appeared at seven o'clock the next morning!</p>
<p>It was fortunate that Eugene Field had a patient wife; she needed every
ounce of patience that she could command. And no one realized this more keenly
than did her husband. He once told of a dream he had which illustrated the
endurance of his wife.</p>
<p>"I thought," said Field, "that I had died and gone to heaven. I had some
difficulty in getting past St. Peter, who regarded me with doubt and suspicion,
and examined my records closely, but finally permitted me to enter the pearly
gates. As I walked up the street of the heavenly city, I saw a venerable old
man with long gray hair and flowing beard. His benignant face encouraged me to
address him. 'I have just arrived and I am entirely unacquainted,' I said. 'May
I ask your name?'</p>
<p>"'My name,' he replied, 'is Job.'</p>
<p>"'Indeed,' I exclaimed, 'are you that Job whom we were taught to revere as
the most patient being in the world?'</p>
<p>"'The same,' he said, with a shadow of hesitation; 'I did have quite a
reputation for patience once, but I hear that there is a woman now on earth, in
Chicago, who has suffered more than I ever did, and she has endured it with
great resignation.'</p>
<p>"'Why,' said I, 'that is curious. I am just from earth, and from Chicago,
and I do not remember to have heard of her case. What is her name?'</p>
<p>"'Mrs. Eugene Field,' was the reply.</p>
<p>"Just then I awoke," ended Field.</p>
<p>The success of Field's paragraph engaging Bok to Miss Pinkham stimulated the
poet to greater effort. Bok had gone to Europe; Field, having found out the
date of his probable return, just about when the steamer was due, printed an
interview with the editor "at quarantine" which sounded so plausible that even
the men in Bok's office in Philadelphia were fooled and prepared for his
arrival. The interview recounted, in detail, the changes in women's fashions in
Paris, and so plausible had Field made it, based upon information obtained at
Marshall Field's, that even the fashion papers copied it.</p>
<p>All this delighted Field beyond measure. Bok begged him to desist; but Field
answered by printing an item to the effect that there was the highest authority
for denying "the reports industriously circulated some time ago to the effect
that Mr. Bok was engaged to be married to a New England young lady, whereas, as
a matter of fact, it is no violation of friendly confidence that makes it
possible to announce that the Philadelphia editor is engaged to Mrs. Frank
Leslie, of New York."</p>
<p>It so happened that Field put this new paragraph on the wire just about the
time that Bok's actual engagement was announced. Field was now deeply contrite,
and sincerely promised Bok and his fiancee to reform. "I'm through, you
mooning, spooning calf, you," he wrote Bok, and his friend believed him, only
to receive a telegram the next day from Mrs. Field warning him that "Gene is
planning a series of telephonic conversations with you and Miss Curtis at
college that I think should not be printed." Bok knew it was of no use trying
to curb Field's industry, and so he wired the editor of the Chicago News for
his cooperation. Field, now checked, asked Bok and his fiancee and the parents
of both to come to Chicago, be his guests for the World's Fair, and "let me
make amends."</p>
<p>It was a happy visit. Field was all kindness, and, of course, the entire
party was charmed by his personality. But the boy in him could not be
repressed. He had kept it down all through the visit. "No, not a joke-cross my
heart," he would say, and then he invited the party to lunch with him on their
way to the train when they were leaving for home. "But we shall be in our
travelling clothes, not dressed for a luncheon," protested the women. It was an
unfortunate protest, for it gave Field an idea! "Oh," he assured them, "just a
goodbye luncheon at the club; just you folks and Julia and me." They believed
him, only to find upon their arrival at the club an assembly of over sixty
guests at one of the most elaborate luncheons ever served in Chicago, with each
woman guest carefully enjoined by Field, in his invitation, to "put on her
prettiest and most elaborate costume in order to dress up the table!"</p>
<p>One day Field came to Philadelphia to give a reading in Camden in
conjunction with George W. Cable. It chanced that his friend, Francis Wilson,
was opening that same evening in Philadelphia in a new comic opera which Field
had not seen. He immediately refused to give his reading, and insisted upon
going to the theatre. The combined efforts of his manager, Wilson, Mr. Cable,
and his friends finally persuaded him to keep his engagement and join in a
double-box party later at the theatre. To make sure that he would keep his
lecture appointment, Bok decided to go to Camden with him. Field and Cable were
to appear alternately.</p>
<p>Field went on for his first number; and when he came off, he turned to Bok
and said: "No use, Bok, I'm a sick man. I must go home. Cable can see this
through," and despite every protestation Field bundled himself into his
overcoat and made for his carriage. "Sick, Bok, really sick," he muttered as
they rode along. Then seeing a fruit-stand he said: "Buy me a bag of oranges,
like a good fellow. They'll do me good.</p>
<p>When Philadelphia was reached, he suggested: "Do you know I think it would
do me good to go and see Frank in the new play? Tell the driver to go to the
theatre like a good boy." Of course, that had been his intent all along! When
the theatre was reached he insisted upon taking the oranges with him. "They'll
steal 'em if you leave 'em there," he said.</p>
<p>Field lost all traces of his supposed illness the moment he reached the box.
Francis Wilson was on the stage with Marie Jansen. "Isn't it beautiful?" said
Field, and directing the attention of the party to the players, he reached
under his chair for the bag of oranges, took one out, and was about to throw it
at Wilson when Bok caught his arm, took the orange away from him, and grabbed
the bag. Field never forgave Bok for this act of watchfulness. "Treason," he
hissed--"going back on a friend."</p>
<p>The one object of Field's ambition was to achieve the distinction of so
"fussing" Francis Wilson that he would be compelled to ring down the curtain.
He had tried every conceivable trick: had walked on the stage in one of
Wilson's scenes; had started a quarrel with an usher in the
audience--everything that ingenuity could conceive he had practised on his
friend. Bok had known this penchant of Field's, and when he insisted on taking
the bag of oranges into the theatre, Field's purpose was evident!</p>
<p>One day Bok received a wire from Field: "City of New Orleans purposing give
me largest public reception on sixth ever given an author. Event of unusual
quality. Mayor and city officials peculiarly desirous of having you introduce
me to vast audience they propose to have. Hate to ask you to travel so far, but
would be great favor to me. Wire answer." Bok wired back his willingness to
travel to New Orleans and oblige his friend. It occurred to Bok, however, to
write to a friend in New Orleans and ask the particulars. Of course, there was
never any thought of Field going to New Orleans or of any reception. Bok waited
for further advices, and a long letter followed from Field giving him a glowing
picture of the reception planned. Bok sent a message to his New Orleans friend
to be telegraphed from New Orleans on the sixth: "Find whole thing to be a
fake. Nice job to put over on me. Bok." Field was overjoyed at the apparent
success of his joke and gleefully told his Chicago friends all about it--until
he found out that the joke had been on him. "Durned dirty, I call it," he wrote
Bok.</p>
<p>It was a lively friendship that Eugene Field gave to Edward Bok, full of
anxieties and of continuous forebodings, but it was worth all that it cost in
mental perturbation. No rarer friend ever lived: in his serious moments he gave
one a quality of unforgetable friendship that remains a precious memory. But
his desire for practical jokes was uncontrollable: it meant being constantly on
one's guard, and even then the pranks could not always be thwarted!</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_21">XVIII. Building Up a
Magazine</a></h3>
<p>The newspaper paragraphers were now having a delightful time with Edward Bok
and his woman's magazine, and he was having a delightful time with them. The
editor's publicity sense made him realize how valuable for his purposes was all
this free advertising. The paragraphers believed, in their hearts, that they
were annoying the young editor; they tried to draw his fire through their
articles. But he kept quiet, put his tongue in his cheek, and determined to
give them some choice morsels for their wit.</p>
<p>He conceived the idea of making familiar to the public the women who were
back of the successful men of the day. He felt sure that his readers wanted to
know about these women. But to attract his newspaper friends he labelled the
series, "Unknown Wives of Well-Known Men" and "Clever Daughters of Clever
Men."</p>
<p>The alliterative titles at once attracted the paragraphers; they fell upon
them like hungry trout, and a perfect fusillade of paragraphs began. This is
exactly what the editor wanted; and he followed these two series immediately by
inducing the daughter of Charles Dickens to write of "My Father as I Knew Him,"
and Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher, of "Mr. Beecher as I Knew Him." Bok now felt that
he had given the newspapers enough ammunition to last for some time; and he
turned his attention to building up a more permanent basis for his
magazine.</p>
<p>The two authors of that day who commanded more attention than any others
were William Dean Howells and Rudyard Kipling. Bok knew that these two would
give to his magazine the literary quality that it needed, and so he laid them
both under contribution. He bought Mr. Howells's new novel, "The Coast of
Bohemia," and arranged that Kipling's new novelette upon which he was working
should come to the magazine. Neither the public nor the magazine editors had
expected Bok to break out along these more permanent lines, and magazine
publishers began to realize that a new competitor had sprung up in
Philadelphia. Bok knew they would feel this; so before he announced Mr.
Howells's new novel, he contracted with the novelist to follow this with his
autobiography. This surprised the editors of the older magazines, for they
realized that the Philadelphia editor had completely tied up the leading
novelist of the day for his next two years' output.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in order that the newspapers might be well supplied with barbs
for their shafts, he published an entire number of his magazine written by
famous daughters of famous men. This unique issue presented contributions by
the daughters of Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, President Harrison,
Horace Greeley, William M. Thackeray, William Dean Howells, General Sherman,
Julia Ward Howe, Jefferson Davis, Mr. Gladstone, and a score of others. This
issue simply filled the paragraphers with glee. Then once more Bok turned to
material calculated to cement the foundation for a more permanent
structure.</p>
<p>He noted, early in its progress, the gathering strength of the drift toward
woman suffrage, and realized that the American woman was not prepared, in her
knowledge of her country, to exercise the privilege of the ballot. Bok
determined to supply the deficiency to his readers, and concluded to put under
contract the President of the United States, Benjamin Harrison, the moment he
left office, to write a series of articles explaining the United States. No man
knew this subject better than the President; none could write better; and none
would attract such general attention to his magazine, reasoned Bok. He sought
the President, talked it over with him, and found him favorable to the idea.
But the President was in doubt at that time whether he would be a candidate for
another term, and frankly told Bok that he would be taking too much risk to
wait for him. He suggested that the editor try to prevail upon his then
secretary of state, James G. Blaine, to undertake the series, and offered to
see Mr. Blaine and induce him to a favorable consideration. Bok acquiesced, and
a few days afterward received from Mr. Blaine a request to come to
Washington.</p>
<p>Bok had had a previous experience with Mr. Blaine which had impressed him to
an unusual degree. Many years before, he had called upon him at his hotel in
New York, seeking his autograph, had been received, and as the statesman was
writing his signature he said: "Your name is a familiar one to me. I have had
correspondence with an Edward Bok who is secretary of state for the Transvaal
Republic. Are you related to him?"</p>
<p>Bok explained that this was his uncle, and that he was named for him.</p>
<p>Years afterward Bok happened to be at a public meeting where Mr. Blaine was
speaking, and the statesman, seeing him, immediately called him by name. Bok
knew of the reputed marvels of Mr. Blaine's memory, but this proof of it amazed
him.</p>
<p>"It is simply inconceivable, Mr. Blaine," said Bok, "that you should
remember my name after all these years."</p>
<p>"Not at all, my boy," returned Mr. Blaine. "Memorizing is simply
association. You associate a fact or an incident with a name and you remember
the name. It never leaves you. The moment I saw you I remembered you told me
that your uncle was secretary of state for the Transvaal. That at once brought
your name to me. You see how simple a trick it is."</p>
<p>But Bok did not see, since remembering the incident was to him an even
greater feat of memory than recalling the name. It was a case of having to
remember two things instead of one.</p>
<p>At all events, Bok was no stranger to James G. Blaine when he called upon
him at his Lafayette Place home in Washington.</p>
<p>"You've gone ahead in the world some since I last saw you," was the
statesman's greeting. "It seems to go with the name."</p>
<p>This naturally broke the ice for the editor at once.</p>
<p>"Let's go to my library where we can talk quietly. What train are you making
back to Philadelphia, by the way?"</p>
<p>"The four, if I can," replied Bok.</p>
<p>"Excuse me a moment," returned Mr. Blaine, and when he came back to the
room, he said: "Now let's talk over this interesting proposition that the
President has told me about."</p>
<p>The two discussed the matter and completed arrangements whereby Mr. Blaine
was to undertake the work. Toward the latter end of the talk, Bok had
covertly--as he thought--looked at his watch to keep track of his train.</p>
<p>"It's all right about that train," came from Mr. Blaine, with his back
toward Bok, writing some data of the talk at his desk. "You'll make it all
right."</p>
<p>Bok wondered how he should, as it then lacked only seventeen minutes of
four. But as Mr. Blaine reached the front door, he said to the editor: "My
carriage is waiting at the curb to take you to the station, and the coachman
has your seat in the parlor car."</p>
<p>And with this knightly courtesy, Mr. Blaine shook hands with Bok, who was
never again to see him, nor was the contract ever to be fulfilled. For early in
1893 Mr. Blaine passed away without having begun the work.</p>
<p>Again Bok turned to the President, and explained to him that, for some
reason or other, the way seemed to point to him to write the articles himself.
By that time President Harrison had decided that he would not succeed himself.
Accordingly he entered into an agreement with the editor to begin to write the
articles immediately upon his retirement from office. And the day after
Inauguration Day every newspaper contained an Associated Press despatch
announcing the former President's contract with The Ladies' Home Journal.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Benjamin Harrison's articles on "This Country of Ours"
successfully appeared in the magazine.</p>
<p>During Bok's negotiations with President Harrison in connection with his
series of articles, he was called to the White House for a conference. It was
midsummer. Mrs. Harrison was away at the seashore, and the President was taking
advantage of her absence by working far into the night.</p>
<p>The President, his secretary, and Bok sat down to dinner.</p>
<p>The Marine Band was giving its weekly concert on the green, and after dinner
the President suggested that Bok and he adjourn to the "back lot" and enjoy the
music.</p>
<p>"You have a coat?" asked the President.</p>
<p>"No, thank you," Bok answered. "I don't need one."</p>
<p>"Not in other places, perhaps," he said, "but here you do. The dampness
comes up from the Potomac at nightfall, and it's just as well to be careful.
It's Mrs. Harrison's dictum," he added smiling. "Halford, send up for one of my
light coats, will you, please?"</p>
<p>Bok remarked, as he put on the President's coat, that this was probably
about as near as he should ever get to the presidency.</p>
<p>"Well, it's a question whether you want to get nearer to it," answered the
President. He looked very white and tired in the moonlight.</p>
<p>"Still," Bok said with a smile, "some folks seem to like it well enough to
wish to get it a second time."</p>
<p>"True," he answered, "but that's what pride will do for a man. Try one of
these cigars."</p>
<p>A cigar! Bok had been taking his tobacco in smaller doses with paper around
them. He had never smoked a cigar. Still, one cannot very well refuse a
presidential cigar!</p>
<p>"Thank you," Bok said as he took one from the President's case. He looked at
the cigar and remembered all he had read of Benjamin Harrison's black cigars.
This one was black--inky black--and big.</p>
<p>"Allow me," he heard the President suddenly say, as he handed him a blazing
match. There was no escape. The aroma was delicious, but--Two or three whiffs
of that cigar, and Bok decided the best thing to do was to let it go out. He
did.</p>
<p>"I have allowed you to talk so much," said the President after a while,
"that you haven't had a chance to smoke. Allow me," and another match crackled
into flame.</p>
<p>"Thank you," the editor said, as once more he lighted the cigar, and the
fumes went clear up into the farthest corner of his brain.</p>
<p>"Take a fresh cigar," said the President after a while. "That doesn't seem
to burn well. You will get one like that once in a while, although I am careful
about my cigars."</p>
<p>"No, thanks, Mr. President," Bok said hurriedly. "It's I, not the
cigar."</p>
<p>"Well, prove it to me with another," was the quick rejoinder, as he held out
his case, and in another minute a match again crackled. "There is only one
thing worse than a bad smoke, and that is an office-seeker," chuckled the
President.</p>
<p>Bok couldn't prove that the cigars were bad, naturally. So smoke that cigar
he did, to the bitter end, and it was bitter! In fifteen minutes his head and
stomach were each whirling around, and no more welcome words had Bok ever heard
than when the President said: "Well, suppose we go in. Halford and I have a
day's work ahead of us yet."</p>
<p>The President went to work.</p>
<p>Bok went to bed. He could not get there quick enough, and he didn't--that
is, not before he had experienced that same sensation of which Oliver Wendell
Holmes wrote: he never could understand, he said, why young authors found so
much trouble in getting into the magazines, for his first trip to Europe was
not a day old before, without even the slightest desire or wish on his part, he
became a contributor to the Atlantic!</p>
<p>The next day, and for days after, Bok smelled, tasted, and felt that
presidential cigar!</p>
<p>A few weeks afterward, Bok was talking after dinner with the President at a
hotel in New York, when once more the cigar-case came out and was handed to
Bok.</p>
<p>"No, thank you, Mr. President," was the instant reply, as visions of his
night in the White House came back to him. "I am like the man from the West who
was willing to try anything once."</p>
<p>And he told the President the story of the White House cigar.</p>
<p>The editor decided to follow General Harrison's discussion of American
affairs by giving his readers a glimpse of foreign politics, and he fixed upon
Mr. Gladstone as the one figure abroad to write for him. He sailed for England,
visited Hawarden Castle, and proposed to Mr. Gladstone that he should write a
series of twelve autobiographical articles which later could be expanded into a
book.</p>
<p>Bok offered fifteen thousand dollars for the twelve articles--a goodly price
in those days--and he saw that the idea and the terms attracted the English
statesman. But he also saw that the statesman was not quite ready. He decided,
therefore, to leave the matter with him, and keep the avenue of approach
favorably open by inducing Mrs. Gladstone to write for him. Bok knew that Mrs.
Gladstone had helped her husband in his literary work, that she was a woman who
had lived a full-rounded life, and after a day's visit and persuasion, with Mr.
Gladstone as an amused looker-on, the editor closed a contract with Mrs.
Gladstone for a series of reminiscent articles "From a Mother's Life."</p>
<p>Some time after Bok had sent the check to Mrs. Gladstone, he received a
letter from Mr. Gladstone expressing the opinion that his wife must have
written with a golden pen, considering the size of the honorarium. "But," he
added, "she is so impressed with this as the first money she has ever earned by
her pen that she is reluctant to part with the check. The result is that she
has not offered it for deposit, and has decided to frame it. Considering the
condition of our exchequer, I have tried to explain to her, and so have my son
and daughter, that if she were to present the check for payment and allow it to
pass through the bank, the check would come back to you and that I am sure your
company would return it to her as a souvenir of the momentous occasion. Our
arguments are of no avail, however, and it occurred to me that an assurance
from you might make the check more useful than it is at present!"</p>
<p>Bok saw with this disposition that, as he had hoped, the avenue of favorable
approach to Mr. Gladstone had been kept open. The next summer Bok again visited
Hawarden, where he found the statesman absorbed in writing a life of Bishop
Butler, from which it was difficult for him to turn away. He explained that it
would take at least a year or two to finish this work. Bok saw, of course, his
advantage, and closed a contract with the English statesman whereby he was to
write the twelve autobiographical articles immediately upon his completion of
the work then under his hand.</p>
<p>Here again, however, as in the case of Mr. Blaine, the contract was never
fulfilled, for Mr. Gladstone passed away before he could free his mind and
begin on the work.</p>
<p>The vicissitudes of an editor's life were certainly beginning to demonstrate
themselves to Edward Bok.</p>
<p>The material that the editor was publishing and the authors that he was
laying under contribution began to have marked effect upon the circulation of
the magazine, and it was not long before the original figures were doubled, an
edition--enormous for that day--of seven hundred and fifty thousand copies was
printed and sold each month, the magical figure of a million was in sight, and
the periodical was rapidly taking its place as one of the largest successes of
the day.</p>
<p>Mr. Curtis's single proprietorship of the magazine had been changed into a
corporation called The Curtis Publishing Company, with a capital of five
hundred thousand dollars, with Mr. Curtis as president, and Bok as
vice-president.</p>
<p>The magazine had by no means an easy road to travel financially. The
doubling of the subscription price to one dollar per year had materially
checked the income for the time being; the huge advertising bills, sometimes
exceeding three hundred thousand dollars a year, were difficult to pay; large
credit had to be obtained, and the banks were carrying a considerable quantity
of Mr. Curtis's notes. But Mr. Curtis never wavered in his faith in his
proposition and his editor. In the first he invested all he had and could
borrow, and to the latter he gave his undivided support. The two men worked
together rather as father and son--as, curiously enough, they were to be
later--than as employer and employee. To Bok, the daily experience of seeing
Mr. Curtis finance his proposition in sums that made the publishing world of
that day gasp with sceptical astonishment was a wonderful opportunity, of which
the editor took full advantage so as to learn the intricacies of a world which
up to that time he had known only in a limited way.</p>
<p>What attracted Bok immensely to Mr. Curtis's methods was their perfect
simplicity and directness. He believed absolutely in the final outcome of his
proposition: where others saw mist and failure ahead, he saw clear weather and
the port of success. Never did he waver: never did he deflect from his course.
He knew no path save the direct one that led straight to success, and, through
his eyes, he made Bok see it with equal clarity until Bok wondered why others
could not see it. But they could not. Cyrus Curtis would never be able, they
said, to come out from under the load he had piled up. Where they differed from
Mr. Curtis was in their lack of vision: they could not see what he saw!</p>
<p>It has been said that Mr. Curtis banished patent-medicine advertisements
from his magazine only when he could afford to do so. That is not true, as a
simple incident will show. In the early days, he and Bok were opening the mail
one Friday full of anxiety because the pay-roll was due that evening, and there
was not enough money in the bank to meet it. From one of the letters dropped a
certified check for five figures for a contract equal to five pages in the
magazine. It was a welcome sight, for it meant an easy meeting of the pay-roll
for that week and two succeeding weeks. But the check was from a manufacturing
patent-medicine company. Without a moment's hesitation, Mr. Curtis slipped it
back into the envelope, saying: "Of course, that we can't take." He returned
the check, never gave the matter a second thought, and went out and borrowed
more money to meet his pay-roll!</p>
<p>With all respect to American publishers, there are very few who could have
done this--or indeed, would do it to-day, under similar
conditions--particularly in that day when it was the custom for all magazines
to accept patent-medicine advertising; The Ladies' Home Journal was practically
the only publication of standing in the United States refusing that class of
business!</p>
<p>Bok now saw advertising done on a large scale by a man who believed in
plenty of white space surrounding the announcement in the advertisement. He
paid Mr. Howells $10,000 for his autobiography, and Mr. Curtis spent $50,000 in
advertising it. "It is not expense," he would explain to Bok, "it is
investment. We are investing in a trade-mark. It will all come back in time."
And when the first $100,000 did not come back as Mr. Curtis figured, he would
send another $100,000 after it, and then both came back.</p>
<p>Bok's experience in advertisement writing was now to stand him in excellent
stead. He wrote all the advertisements and from that day to the day of his
retirement, practically every advertisement of the magazine was written by
him.</p>
<p>Mr. Curtis believed that the editor should write the advertisements of a
magazine's articles. "You are the one who knows them, what is in them and your
purpose," he said to Bok, who keenly enjoyed this advertisement writing. He put
less and less in his advertisements. Mr. Curtis made them larger and larger in
the space which they occupied in the media used. In this way The Ladies' Home
Journal advertisements became distinctive for their use of white space, and as
the advertising world began to say: "You can't miss them." Only one feature was
advertised at one time, but the "feature" was always carefully selected for its
wide popular appeal, and then Mr. Curtis spared no expense to advertise it
abundantly. As much as $400,000 was spent in one year in advertising only a few
features--a gigantic sum in those days, approached by no other periodical. But
Mr. Curtis believed in showing the advertising world that he was willing to
take his own medicine.</p>
<p>Naturally, such a campaign of publicity announcing the most popular
attractions offered by any magazine of the day had but one effect: the
circulation leaped forward by bounds, and the advertising columns of the
magazine rapidly filled up.</p>
<p>The success of The Ladies' Home Journal began to look like an assured fact,
even to the most sceptical.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it was only at its beginning, as both publisher and
editor knew. But they desired to fill the particular field of the magazine so
quickly and fully that there would be small room for competition. The woman's
magazine field was to belong to them!</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_22">XIX. Personality
Letters</a></h3>
<p>Edward Bok was always interested in the manner in which personality was
expressed in letters. For this reason he adopted, as a boy, the method of
collecting not mere autographs, but letters characteristic of their writers
which should give interesting insight into the most famous men and women of the
day. He secured what were really personality letters.</p>
<p>One of these writers was Mark Twain. The humorist was not kindly disposed
toward autograph collectors, and the fact that in this case the collector aimed
to raise the standard of the hobby did not appease him. Still, it brought forth
a characteristic letter:</p>
<p>"I hope I shall not offend you; I shall certainly say nothing with the
intention to offend you. I must explain myself, however, and I will do it as
kindly as I can. What you ask me to do, I am asked to do as often as one-half
dozen times a week. Three hundred letters a year! One's impulse is to freely
consent, but one's time and necessary occupations will not permit it. There is
no way but to decline in all cases, making no exceptions, and I wish to call
your attention to a thing which has probably not occurred to you, and that is
this: that no man takes pleasure in exercising his trade as a pastime. Writing
is my trade, and I exercise it only when I am obliged to. You might make your
request of a doctor, or a builder, or a sculptor, and there would be no
impropriety in it, but if you asked either of those for a specimen of his
trade, his handiwork, he would be justified in rising to a point of order. It
would never be fair to ask a doctor for one of his corpses to remember him
by.</p>
<p>"MARK TWAIN".</p>
<p>At another time, after an interesting talk with Mark Twain, Bok wrote an
account of the interview, with the humorist's permission. Desirous that the
published account should be in every respect accurate, the manuscript was
forwarded to Mark Twain for his approval. This resulted in the following
interesting letter:</p>
<p>"MY DEAR MR. BOK:</p>
<p>"No, no--it is like most interviews, pure twaddle, and valueless.</p>
<p>"For several quite plain and simple reasons, an 'interview' must, as a rule,
be an absurdity. And chiefly for this reason: it is an attempt to use a boat on
land, or a wagon on water, to speak figuratively. Spoken speech is one thing,
written speech is quite another. Print is a proper vehicle for the latter, but
it isn't for the former. The moment 'talk' is put into print you recognize that
it is not what it was when you heard it; you perceive that an immense something
has disappeared from it. That is its soul. You have nothing but a dead carcass
left on your hands. Color, play of feature, the varying modulations of voice,
the laugh, the smile, the informing inflections, everything that gave that body
warmth, grace, friendliness, and charm, and commended it to your affection, or
at least to your tolerance, is gone, and nothing is left, but a pallid, stiff
and repulsive cadaver.</p>
<p>"Such is 'talk,' almost invariably, as you see it lying in state in an
'interview.' The interviewer seldom tries to tell one how a thing was said; he
merely puts in the naked remark, and stops there. When one writes for print,
his methods are very different. He follows forms which have but little
resemblance to conversation, but they make the reader understand what the
writer is trying to convey. And when the writer is making a story, and finds it
necessary to report some of the talk of his characters, observe how cautiously
and anxiously he goes at that risky and difficult thing:</p>
<p>"'If he had dared to say that thing in my presence,' said Alfred, taking a
mock heroic attitude, and casting an arch glance upon the company, 'blood would
have flowed.'</p>
<p>"'If he had dared to say that thing in my presence,' said Hawkwood, with
that in his eye which caused more than one heart in that guilty assemblage to
quake, 'blood would have flowed.'</p>
<p>"'If he had dared to say that thing in my presence,' said the paltry
blusterer, with valor on his tongue and pallor on his lips, 'blood would have
flowed.'</p>
<p>"So painfully aware is the novelist that naked talk in print conveys no
meaning, that he loads, and often overloads, almost every utterance of his
characters with explanations and interpretations. It is a loud confession that
print is a poor vehicle for 'talk,' it is a recognition that uninterpreted talk
in print would result in confusion to the reader, not instruction.</p>
<p>"Now, in your interview you have certainly been most accurate, you have set
down the sentences I uttered as I said them. But you have not a word of
explanation; what my manner was at several points is not indicated. Therefore,
no reader can possibly know where I was in earnest and where I was joking; or
whether I was joking altogether or in earnest altogether. Such a report of a
conversation has no value. It can convey many meanings to the reader, but never
the right one. To add interpretations which would convey the right meaning is a
something which would require--what? An art so high and fine and difficult that
no possessor of it would ever be allowed to waste it on interviews.</p>
<p>"No; spare the reader and spare me; leave the whole interview out; it is
rubbish. I wouldn't talk in my sleep if I couldn't talk better than that.</p>
<p>"If you wish to print anything, print this letter; it may have some value,
for it may explain to a reader here and there why it is that in interviews as a
rule men seem to talk like anybody but themselves.</p>
<p>"Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>"MARK TWAIN."</p>
<p>The Harpers had asked Bok to write a book descriptive of his
autograph-letter collection, and he had consented. The propitious moment,
however, never came in his busy life. One day he mentioned the fact to Doctor
Oliver Wendell Holmes and the poet said: "Let me write the introduction for
it." Bok, of course, eagerly accepted, and within a few days he received the
following, which, with the book, never reached publication:</p>
<p>"How many autograph writers have had occasion to say with the Scotch
trespasser climbing his neighbor's wall, when asked where he was going Bok
again!'</p>
<p>"Edward Bok has persevered like the widow in scripture, and the most
obdurate subjects of his quest have found it for their interest to give in,
lest by his continual coming he should weary them. We forgive him; almost
admire him for his pertinacity; only let him have no imitators. The tax he has
levied must not be imposed a second time.</p>
<p>"An autograph of a distinguished personage means more to an imaginative
person than a prosaic looker-on dreams of. Along these lines ran the
consciousness and the guiding will of Napoleon, or Washington, of Milton or
Goethe.</p>
<p>"His breath warmed the sheet of paper which you have before you. The
microscope will show you the trail of flattened particles left by the
tesselated epidermis of his hand as it swept along the manuscript. Nay, if we
had but the right developing fluid to flow over it, the surface of the sheet
would offer you his photograph as the light pictured it at the instant of
writing.</p>
<p>"Look at Mr. Bok's collection with such thoughts, ...and you will cease to
wonder at his pertinacity and applaud the conquests of his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Oliver Wendell Holmes."</p>
<p>Whenever biographers of the New England school of writers have come to write
of John Greenleaf Whittier, they have been puzzled as to the scanty number of
letters and private papers left by the poet. This letter, written to Bok, in
comment upon a report that the poet had burned all his letters, is
illuminating:</p>
<p>"Dear Friend:</p>
<p>"The report concerning the burning of my letters is only true so far as
this: some years ago I destroyed a large collection of letters I had received
not from any regard to my own reputation, but from the fear that to leave them
liable to publicity might be injurious or unpleasant to the writers or their
friends. They covered much of the anti-slavery period and the War of the
Rebellion, and many of them I knew were strictly private and confidential. I
was not able at the time to look over the MS. and thought it safest to make a
bonfire of it all. I have always regarded a private and confidential letter as
sacred and its publicity in any shape a shameful breach of trust, unless
authorized by the writer. I only wish my own letters to thousands of
correspondents may be as carefully disposed of.</p>
<p>"You may use this letter as you think wise and best.</p>
<p>"Very truly thy friend,</p>
<p>"John G. Whittier."</p>
<p>Once in a while a bit of untold history crept into a letter sent to Bok; as
for example in the letter, referred to in a previous chapter from General Jubal
A. Early, the Confederate general, in which he gave an explanation, never
before fully given, of his reasons for the burning of Chambersburg,
Pennsylvania:</p>
<p>"The town of Chambersburg was burned on the same day on which the demand on
it was made by McCausland and refused. It was ascertained that a force of the
enemy's cavalry was approaching, and there was no time for delay. Moreover, the
refusal was peremptory, and there was no reason for delay unless the demand was
a mere idle threat.</p>
<p>"I had no knowledge of what amount of money there might be in Chambersburg.
I knew that it was a town of some twelve thousand inhabitants. The town of
Frederick, in Maryland, which was a much smaller town than Chambersburg, had in
June very promptly responded to my demand on it for $200,000, some of the
inhabitants, who were friendly to me, expressing a regret that I had not made
it $500,000. There were one or more National Banks at Chambersburg, and the
town ought to have been able to raise the sum I demanded. I never heard that
the refusal was based on the inability to pay such a sum, and there was no
offer to pay any sum. The value of the houses destroyed by Hunter, with their
contents, was fully $100,000 in gold, and at the time I made the demand the
price of gold in greenbacks had very nearly reached $3.00 and was going up
rapidly. Hence it was that I required the $500,000 in greenbacks, if the gold
was not paid, to provide against any further depreciation of the paper
money.</p>
<p>"I would have been fully justified by the laws of retaliation in war in
burning the town without giving the inhabitants the opportunity of redeeming
it.</p>
<p>"J. A. Early."</p>
<p>Bok wrote to Eugene Field, once, asking him why in all his verse he had
never written any love-songs, and suggesting that the story of Jacob and Rachel
would have made a theme for a beautiful love-poem. Field's reply is interesting
and characteristic, and throws a light on an omission in his works at which
many have wondered:</p>
<p>"Dear Bok:</p>
<p>"I'll see what I can do with the suggestion as to Jacob and Rachel. Several
have asked me why I have never written any love-songs. That is hard to answer.
I presume it is because I married so young. I was married at twenty-three, and
did not begin to write until I was twenty-nine. Most of my lullabies are, in a
sense, love-songs; so is 'To a Usurper,' 'A Valentine,' 'The Little Bit of a
Woman,' 'Lovers' Lane,' etc., but not the kind commonly called love-songs. I am
sending you herewith my first love-song, and even into it has crept a cadence
that makes it a love-song of maturity rather than of youth. I do not know that
you will care to have it, but it will interest you as the first....</p>
<p>"Ever sincerely yours,</p>
<p>"Eugene Field."</p>
<p>During the last years of his life, Bok tried to interest Benjamin Harrison,
former President of the United States, in golf, since his physician had ordered
"moderate outdoor exercise." Bok offered to equip him with the necessary clubs
and balls. When he received the balls, the ex-president wrote:</p>
<p>"Thanks. But does not a bottle of liniment go with each ball?"</p>
<p>When William Howard Taft became President of the United States, the
impression was given out that journalists would not be so welcome at the White
House as they had been during the administration of President Roosevelt. Mr.
Taft, writing to Bok about another matter, asked why he had not called and
talked it over while in Washington. Bok explained the impression that was
current; whereupon came the answer, swift and definite!</p>
<p>"There are no personae non gratae at the White House. I long ago learned the
waste of time in maintaining such a class."</p>
<p>There was in circulation during Henry Ward Beecher's lifetime a story, which
is still revived every now and then, that on a hot Sunday morning in early
summer, he began his sermon in Plymouth Church by declaring that "It is too
damned hot to preach." Bok wrote to the great preacher, asked him the truth of
this report, and received this definite denial:</p>
<p>"My Dear Friend:</p>
<p>"No, I never did begin a sermon with the remark that "it is d--d hot," etc.
It is a story a hundred years old, revamped every few years to suit some new
man. When I am dead and gone, it will be told to the rising generation
respecting some other man, and then, as now, there will be fools who will swear
that they heard it!</p>
<p>"Henry Ward Beecher."</p>
<p>When Bok's father passed away, he left, among his effects, a large number of
Confederate bonds. Bok wrote to Jefferson Davis, asking if they had any value,
and received this characteristic answer:</p>
<p>"I regret my inability to give an opinion. The theory of the Confederate
Government, like that of the United States, was to separate the sword from the
purse. Therefore, the Confederate States Treasury was under the control not of
the Chief Executive, but of the Congress and the Secretary of the Treasury.
This may explain my want of special information in regard to the Confederate
States Bonds. Generally, I may state that the Confederate Government cannot
have preserved a fund for the redemption of its Bonds other than the cotton
subscribed by our citizens for that purpose. At the termination of the War, the
United States Government, claiming to be the successor of the Confederate
Government, seized all its property which could be found, both at home and
abroad. I have not heard of any purpose to apply these assets to the payment of
the liabilities of the Confederacy, and, therefore, have been at a loss to
account for the demand which has lately been made for the Confederate
Bonds.</p>
<p>"Jefferson Davis."</p>
<p>Always the soul of courtesy itself, and most obliging in granting the
numerous requests which came to him for his autograph, William Dean Howells
finally turned; and Bok always considered himself fortunate that the novelist
announced his decision to him in the following characteristic letter:</p>
<p>"The requests for my autograph have of late become so burdensome that I am
obliged either to refuse all or to make some sort of limitation. Every author
must have an uneasy fear that his signature is 'collected' at times like
postage-stamps, and at times 'traded' among the collectors for other
signatures. That would not matter so much if the applicants were always able to
spell his name, or were apparently acquainted with his work or interested in
it.</p>
<p>"I propose, therefore, to give my name hereafter only to such askers as can
furnish me proof by intelligent comment upon it that they have read some book
of mine. If they can inclose a bookseller's certificate that they have bought
the book, their case will be very much strengthened; but I do not insist upon
this. In all instances a card and a stamped and directed envelope must be
inclosed. I will never 'add a sentiment' except in the case of applicants who
can give me proof that they have read all my books, now some thirty or forty in
number.</p>
<p>"W. D. Howells."</p>
<p>It need hardly be added that Mr. Howells's good nature prevented his
adherence to his rule!</p>
<p>Rudyard Kipling is another whose letters fairly vibrate with personality;
few men can write more interestingly, or, incidentally, considering his
microscopic handwriting, say more on a letter page.</p>
<p>Bok was telling Kipling one day about the scrapple so dear to the heart of
the Philadelphian as a breakfast dish. The author had never heard of it or
tasted it, and wished for a sample. So, upon his return home, Bok had a
Philadelphia market-man send some of the Philadelphia-made article, packed in
ice, to Kipling in his English home. There were several pounds of it and
Kipling wrote:</p>
<p>"By the way, that scrapple--which by token is a dish for the Gods--arrived
in perfect condition, and I ate it all, or as much as I could get hold of. I am
extremely grateful for it. It's all nonsense about pig being unwholesome. There
isn't a Mary-ache in a barrel of scrapple."</p>
<p>Then later came this afterthought:</p>
<p>"A noble dish is that scrapple, but don't eat three slices and go to work
straight on top of 'em. That's the way to dyspepsia!</p>
<p>"P. S. I wish to goodness you'd give another look at England before long.
It's quite a country; really it is. Old, too, I believe."</p>
<p>It was Kipling who suggested that Bok should name his Merion home
"Swastika." Bok asked what the author knew about the mystic sign:</p>
<p>"There is a huge book (I've forgotten the name, but the Smithsonian will
know)," he wrote back, "about the Swastika (pronounced Swas-ti-ka to rhyme with
'car's ticker'), in literature, art, religion, dogma, etc. I believe there are
two sorts of Swastikas, one [figure] and one [figure]; one is bad, the other is
good, but which is which I know not for sure. The Hindu trader opens his yearly
account-books with a Swastika as 'an auspicious beginning,' and all the races
of the earth have used it. It's an inexhaustible subject, and some man in the
Smithsonian ought to be full of it. Anyhow, the sign on the door or the hearth
should protect you against fire and water and thieves.</p>
<p>"By this time should have reached you a Swastika door-knocker, which I hope
may fit in with the new house and the new name. It was made by a village-smith;
and you will see that it has my initials, to which I hope you will add yours,
that the story may be complete.</p>
<p>"We are settled out here in Cape Town, eating strawberries in January and
complaining of the heat, which for the last two days has been a little more
than we pampered folk are used to; say 70&deg; at night. But what a lovely land
it is, and how superb are the hydrangeas! Figure to yourself four acres of 'em,
all in bloom on the hillside near our home!"</p>
<p>Bok had visited the Panama Canal before its completion and had talked with
the men, high and low, working on it, asking them how they felt about President
Roosevelt's action in "digging the Canal first and talking about it
afterwards." He wrote the result of his talks to Colonel Roosevelt, and
received this reply:</p>
<p>"I shall always keep your letter, for I shall want my children and
grandchildren to see it after I am gone. I feel just as you do about the Canal.
It is the greatest contribution I was able to make to my country; and while I
do not believe my countrymen appreciate this at the moment, I am extremely
pleased to know that the men on the Canal do, for they are the men who have
done and are doing the great job. I am awfully pleased that you feel the way
you do.</p>
<p>"Theodore Roosevelt."</p>
<p>In 1887, General William Tecumseh Sherman was much talked about as a
candidate for the presidency, until his famous declaration came out: "I will
not run if nominated, and will not serve if elected." During the weeks of talk,
however, much was said of General Sherman's religious views, some contending
that he was a Roman Catholic; others that he was a Protestant.</p>
<p>Bok wrote to General Sherman and asked him. His answer was direct:</p>
<p>"My family is strongly Roman Catholic, but I am not. Until I ask some favor
the public has no claim to question me further."</p>
<p>When Mrs. Sherman passed away, Doctor T. DeWitt Talmage wrote General
Sherman a note of condolence, and what is perhaps one of the fullest
expositions of his religious faith to which he ever gave expression came from
him in a most remarkable letter, which Doctor Talmage gave to Bok.</p>
<p>"New York, December 12, 1886.</p>
<p>"My Dear Friend:</p>
<p>"Your most tender epistle from Mansfield, Ohio, of December 9 brought here
last night by your son awakens in my brain a flood of memories. Mrs. Sherman
was by nature and inheritance an Irish Catholic. Her grandfather, Hugh Boyle,
was a highly educated classical scholar, whom I remember well,--married the
half sister of the mother of James G. Blaine at Brownsville, Pa., settled in
our native town Lancaster, Fairfield County, Ohio, and became the Clerk of the
County Court. He had two daughters, Maria and Susan. Maria became the wife of
Thomas Ewing, about 1819, and was the mother of my wife, Ellen Boyle Ewing. She
was so staunch to what she believed the true Faith that I am sure that though
she loved her children better than herself, she would have seen them die with
less pang, than to depart from the "Faith." Mr. Ewing was a great big man, an
intellectual giant, and looked down on religion as something domestic,
something consoling which ought to be encouraged; and to him it made little
difference whether the religion was Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, or
Catholic, provided the acts were 'half as good' as their professions.</p>
<p>"In 1829 my father, a Judge of the Supreme Court of Ohio, died at Lebanon
away from home, leaving his widow, Mary Hoyt of Norwalk, Conn. (sister to
Charles and James Hoyt of Brooklyn) with a frame house in Lancaster, an income
of $200 a year and eleven as hungry, rough, and uncouth children as ever
existed on earth. But father had been kind, generous, manly with a big heart;
and when it ceased to beat friends turned up--Our Uncle Stoddard took Charles,
the oldest; W. I. married the next, Elisabeth (still living); Amelia was soon
married to a merchant in Mansfield, McCorab; I, the third son, was adopted by
Thomas Ewing, a neighbor, and John fell to his namesake in Mt. Vernon, a
merchant.</p>
<p>"Surely 'Man proposes and God disposes.' I could fill a hundred pages, but
will not bore you. A half century has passed and you, a Protestant minister,
write me a kind, affectionate letter about my Catholic wife from Mansfield, one
of my family homes, where my mother, Mary Hoyt, died, and where our
Grandmother, Betsey Stoddard, lies buried. Oh, what a flood of memories come up
at the name of Betsey Stoddard,--daughter of the Revd. Mr. Stoddard, who
preached three times every Sunday, and as often in between as he could cajole a
congregation at ancient Woodbury, Conn.,--who came down from Mansfield to
Lancaster, three days' hard journey to regulate the family of her son Judge
Sherman, whose gentle wife was as afraid of Grandma as any of us boys. She
never spared the rod or broom, but she had more square solid sense to the yard
than any woman I ever saw. From her Charles, John, and I inherit what little
sense we possess.</p>
<p>"Lancaster, Fairfield County, was our paternal home, Mansfield that of
Grandmother Stoddard and her daughter, Betsey Parker. There Charles and John
settled, and when in 1846 I went to California Mother also went there, and
there died in 1851.</p>
<p>"When a boy, once a year I had to drive my mother in an old 'dandy wagon' on
her annual visit. The distance was 75 miles, further than Omaha is from San
Francisco. We always took three days and stopped at every house to gossip with
the woman folks, and dispense medicines and syrups to the sick, for in those
days all had the chills or ague. If I could I would not awaken Grandmother
Betsey Stoddard because she would be horrified at the backsliding of the
servants of Christ,--but oh! how I would like to take my mother, Mary Hoyt, in
a railroad car out to California, to Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, among the
vineyards of grapes, the groves of oranges, lemons and pomegranates. How
clearly recurs to me the memory of her exclamation when I told her I had been
ordered around Cape Horn to California. Her idea was about as definite as mine
or yours as to, Where is Stanley? but she saw me return with some nuggets to
make her life more comfortable.</p>
<p>"She was a strong Presbyterian to the end, but she loved my Ellen, and the
love was mutual. All my children have inherited their mother's faith, and she
would have given anything if I would have simply said Amen; but it is simply
impossible.</p>
<p>"But I am sure that you know that the God who created the minnow, and who
has moulded the rose and carnation, given each its sweet fragrance, will
provide for those mortal men who strive to do right in the world which he
himself has stocked with birds, animals, and men;--at all events, I will trust
Him with absolute confidence.</p>
<p>"With great respect and affection,</p>
<p>"Yours truly,</p>
<p>"W. T. Sherman."</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_23">XX. Meeting a Reverse or
Two</a></h3>
<p>With the hitherto unreached magazine circulation of a million copies a month
in sight, Edward Bok decided to give a broader scope to the periodical. He was
determined to lay under contribution not only the most famous writers of the
day, but also to seek out those well-known persons who usually did not
contribute to the magazines; always keeping in mind the popular appeal of his
material, but likewise aiming constantly to widen its scope and gradually to
lift its standard.</p>
<p>Sailing again for England, he sought and secured the acquaintance of Rudyard
Kipling, whose alert mind was at once keenly interested in what Bok was trying
to do. He was willing to co-operate, with the result that Bok secured the
author's new story, William the Conqueror. When Bok read the manuscript, he was
delighted; he had for some time been reading Kipling's work with enthusiasm,
and he saw at once that here was one of the author's best tales.</p>
<p>At that time, Frances E. Willard had brought her agitation for temperance
prominently before the public, and Bok had promised to aid her by eliminating
from his magazine, so far as possible, all scenes which represented alcoholic
drinking. It was not an iron-clad rule, but, both from the principle fixed for
his own life and in the interest of the thousands of young people who read his
magazine, he believed it would be better to minimize all incidents portraying
alcoholic drinking or drunkenness. Kipling's story depicted several such
scenes; so when Bok sent the proofs he suggested that if Kipling could moderate
some of these scenes, it would be more in line with the policy of the magazine.
Bok did not make a special point of the matter, leaving it to Kipling's
judgment to decide how far he could make such changes and preserve the
atmosphere of his story.</p>
<p>From this incident arose the widely published story that Bok cabled Kipling,
asking permission to omit a certain drinking reference, and substitute
something else, whereupon Kipling cabled back: "Substitute Mellin's Food." As a
matter of fact (although it is a pity to kill such a clever story), no such
cable was ever sent and no such reply ever received. As Kipling himself wrote
to Bok: "No, I said nothing about Mellin's Food. I wish I had." An American
author in London happened to hear of the correspondence between the editor and
the author, it appealed to his sense of humor, and the published story was the
result. If it mattered, it is possible that Brander Matthews could accurately
reveal the originator of the much-published yarn.</p>
<p>From Kipling's house Bok went to Tunbridge Wells to visit Mary Anderson, the
one-time popular American actress, who had married Antonio de Navarro and
retired from the stage. A goodly number of editors had tried to induce the
retired actress to write, just as a number of managers had tried to induce her
to return to the stage. All had failed. But Bok never accepted the failure of
others as a final decision for himself; and after two or three visits, he
persuaded Madame de Navarro to write her reminiscences, which he published with
marked success in the magazine.</p>
<p>The editor was very desirous of securing something for his magazine that
would delight children, and he hit upon the idea of trying to induce Lewis
Carroll to write another Alice in Wonderland series. He was told by English
friends that this would be difficult, since the author led a secluded life at
Oxford and hardly ever admitted any one into his confidence. But Bok wanted to
beard the lion in his den, and an Oxford graduate volunteered to introduce him
to an Oxford don through whom, if it were at all possible, he could reach the
author. The journey to Oxford was made, and Bok was introduced to the don, who
turned out to be no less a person than the original possessor of the highly
colored vocabulary of the "White Rabbit" of the Alice stories.</p>
<p>"Impossible," immediately declared the don. "You couldn't persuade Dodgson
to consider it." Bok, however, persisted, and it so happened that the don liked
what he called "American perseverance."</p>
<p>"Well, come along," he said. "We'll beard the lion in his den, as you say,
and see what happens. You know, of course, that it is the Reverend Charles L.
Dodgson that we are going to see, and I must introduce you to that person, not
to Lewis Carroll. He is a tutor in mathematics here, as you doubtless know;
lives a rigidly secluded life; dislikes strangers; makes no friends; and yet
withal is one of the most delightful men in the world if he wants to be."</p>
<p>But as it happened upon this special occasion when Bok was introduced to him
in his chambers in Tom Quad, Mr. Dodgson did not "want to be" delightful. There
was no doubt that back of the studied reserve was a kindly, charming, gracious
gentleman, but Bok's profession had been mentioned and the author was on rigid
guard.</p>
<p>When Bok explained that one of the special reasons for his journey from
America this summer was to see him, the Oxford mathematician sufficiently
softened to ask the editor to sit down.</p>
<p>Bok then broached his mission.</p>
<p>"You are quite in error, Mr. Bok," was the Dodgson comment. "You are not
speaking to the person you think you are addressing."</p>
<p>For a moment Bok was taken aback. Then he decided to go right to the
point.</p>
<p>"Do I understand, Mr. Dodgson, that you are not 'Lewis Carroll'; that you
did not write Alice in Wonderland?"</p>
<p>For an answer the tutor rose, went into another room, and returned with a
book which he handed to Bok. "This is my book," he said simply. It was entitled
An Elementary Treatise on Determinants, by C. L. Dodgson. When he looked up,
Bok found the author's eyes riveted on him.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Bok. "I know, Mr. Dodgson. If I remember correctly, this is the
same book of which you sent a copy to Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, when she
wrote to you for a personal copy of your Alice."</p>
<p>Dodgson made no comment. The face was absolutely without expression save a
kindly compassion intended to convey to the editor that he was making a
terrible mistake.</p>
<p>"As I said to you in the beginning, Mr. Bok, you are in error. You are not
speaking to 'Lewis Carroll.'" And then: "Is this the first time you have
visited Oxford?"</p>
<p>Bok said it was; and there followed the most delightful two hours with the
Oxford mathematician and the Oxford don, walking about and into the wonderful
college buildings, and afterward the three had a bite of lunch together. But
all efforts to return to "Lewis Carroll" were futile. While saying good-by to
his host, Bok remarked:</p>
<p>"I can't help expressing my disappointment, Mr. Dodgson, in my quest in
behalf of the thousands of American children who love you and who would so
gladly welcome 'Lewis Carroll' back."</p>
<p>The mention of children and their love for him momentarily had its effect.
For an instant a different light came into the eyes, and Bok instinctively
realized Dodgson was about to say something. But he checked himself. Bok had
almost caught him off his guard.</p>
<p>"I am sorry," he finally said at the parting at the door, "that you should
be disappointed, for the sake of the children as well as for your own sake. I
only regret that I cannot remove the disappointment."</p>
<p>And as the trio walked to the station, the don said: "That is his attitude
toward all, even toward me. He is not 'Lewis Carroll' to any one; is extremely
sensitive on the point, and will not acknowledge his identity. That is why he
lives so much to himself. He is in daily dread that some one will mention Alice
in his presence. Curious, but there it is."</p>
<p>Edward Bok's next quest was to be even more disappointing; he was never even
to reach the presence of the person he sought. This was Florence Nightingale,
the Crimean nurse. Bok was desirous of securing her own story of her
experiences, but on every hand he found an unwillingness even to take him to
her house. "No use," said everybody. "She won't see any one. Hates publicity
and all that sort of thing, and shuns the public." Nevertheless, the editor
journeyed to the famous nurse's home on South Street, in the West End of
London, only to be told that "Miss Nightingale never receives strangers."</p>
<p>"But I am not a stranger," insisted the editor. "I am one of her friends
from America. Please take my card to her."</p>
<p>This mollified the faithful secretary, but the word instantly came back that
Miss Nightingale was not receiving any one that day. Bok wrote her a letter
asking for an appointment, which was never answered. Then he wrote another,
took it personally to the house, and awaited an answer, only to receive the
message that "Miss Nightingale says there is no answer to the letter."</p>
<p>Bok had with such remarkable uniformity secured whatever he sought, that
these experiences were new to him. Frankly, they puzzled him. He was not easily
baffled, but baffled he now was, and that twice in succession. Turn as he
might, he could find no way in which to reopen an approach to either the Oxford
tutor or the Crimean nurse. They were plainly too much for him, and he had to
acknowledge his defeat. The experience was good for him; he did not realize
this at the time, nor did he enjoy the sensation of not getting what he wanted.
Nevertheless, a reverse or two was due. Not that his success was having any
undesirable effect upon him; his Dutch common sense saved him from any such
calamity. But at thirty years of age it is not good for any one, no matter how
well balanced, to have things come his way too fast and too consistently. And
here were breaks. He could not have everything he wanted, and it was just as
well that he should find that out.</p>
<p>In his next quest he found himself again opposed by his London friends.
Unable to secure a new Alice in Wonderland for his child readers, he determined
to give them Kate Greenaway. But here he had selected another recluse.
Everybody discouraged him. The artist never saw visitors, he was told, and she
particularly shunned editors and publishers. Her own publishers confessed that
Miss Greenaway was inaccessible to them. "We conduct all our business with her
by correspondence. I have never seen her personally myself," said a member of
the firm.</p>
<p>Bok inwardly decided that two failures in two days were sufficient, and he
made up his mind that there should not be a third. He took a bus for the long
ride to Hampstead Heath, where the illustrator lived, and finally stood before
a picturesque Queen Anne house that one would have recognized at once, with its
lower story of red brick, its upper part covered with red tiles, its windows of
every size and shape, as the inspiration of Kate Greenaway's pictures. As it
turned out later, Miss Greenaway's sister opened the door and told the visitor
that Miss Greenaway was not at home.</p>
<p>"But, pardon me, has not Miss Greenaway returned? Is not that she?" asked
Bok, as he indicated a figure just coming down the stairs. And as the sister
turned to see, Bok stepped into the hall. At least he was inside! Bok had never
seen a photograph of Miss Greenaway, he did not know that the figure coming
downstairs was the artist; but his instinct had led him right, and good fortune
was with him.</p>
<p>He now introduced himself to Kate Greenaway, and explained that one of his
objects in coming to London was to see her on behalf of thousands of American
children. Naturally there was nothing for the illustrator to do but to welcome
her visitor. She took him into the garden, where he saw at once that he was
seated under the apple-tree of Miss Greenaway's pictures. It was in full bloom,
a veritable picture of spring loveliness. Bok's love for nature pleased the
artist and when he recognized the cat that sauntered up, he could see that he
was making headway. But when he explained his profession and stated his errand,
the atmosphere instantly changed. Miss Greenaway conveyed the unmistakable
impression that she had been trapped, and Bok realized at once that he had a
long and difficult road ahead.</p>
<p>Still, negotiate it he must and he did! And after luncheon in the garden,
with the cat in his lap, Miss Greenaway perceptibly thawed out, and when the
editor left late that afternoon he had the promise of the artist that she would
do her first magazine work for him. That promise was kept monthly, and for
nearly two years her articles appeared, with satisfaction to Miss Greenaway and
with great success to the magazine.</p>
<p>The next opposition to Bok's plans arose from the soreness generated by the
absence of copyright laws between the United States and Great Britain and
Europe. The editor, who had been publishing a series of musical compositions,
solicited the aid of Sir Arthur Sullivan. But it so happened that Sir Arthur's
most famous composition, "The Lost Chord," had been taken without leave by
American music publishers, and sold by the hundreds of thousands with the
composer left out on pay-day. Sir Arthur held forth on this injustice, and said
further that no accurate copy of "The Lost Chord" had, so far as he knew, ever
been printed in the United States. Bok saw his chance, and also an opportunity
for a little Americanization.</p>
<p>"Very well, Sir Arthur," suggested Bok; "with your consent, I will rectify
both the inaccuracy and the injustice. Write out a correct version of 'The Lost
Chord'; I will give it to nearly a million readers, and so render obsolete the
incorrect copies; and I shall be only too happy to pay you the first honorarium
for an American publication of the song. You can add to the copy the statement
that this is the first American honorarium you have ever received, and so shame
the American publishers for their dishonesty."</p>
<p>This argument appealed strongly to the composer, who made a correct
transcript of his famous song, and published it with the following note:</p>
<p>"This is the first and only copy of "The Lost Chord" which has ever been
sent by me to an American publisher. I believe all the reprints in America are
more or less incorrect. I have pleasure in sending this copy to my friend, Mr.
Edward W. Bok, for publication in The Ladies' Home Journal for which he gives
me an honorarium, the only one I have ever received from an American publisher
for this song.</p>
<p>"Arthur Sullivan."</p>
<p>At least, thought Bok, he had healed one man's soreness toward America. But
the next day he encountered another. On his way to Paris, he stopped at Amiens
to see Jules Verne. Here he found special difficulty in that the aged author
could not speak English, and Bok knew only a few words of casual French.
Finally a neighbor's servant who knew a handful of English words was
commandeered, and a halting three-cornered conversation was begun.</p>
<p>Bok found two grievances here: the author was incensed at the American
public because it had insisted on classing his books as juveniles, and
accepting them as stories of adventure, whereas he desired them to be
recognized as prophetic stories based on scientific facts--an insistence which,
as all the world knows, has since been justified. Bok explained, however, that
the popular acceptance of the author's books as stories of adventure was by no
means confined to America; that even in his own country the same was true. But
Jules Verne came back with the rejoinder that if the French were a pack of
fools, that was no reason why the Americans should also be.</p>
<p>The argument weighed somewhat with the author, however, for he then changed
the conversation, and pointed out how he had been robbed by American publishers
who had stolen his books. So Bok was once more face to face with the old
non-copyright conditions; and although he explained the existence then of a new
protective law, the old man was not mollified. He did not take kindly to Bok's
suggestion for new work, and closed the talk, extremely difficult to all three,
by declaring that his writing days were over.</p>
<p>But Bok was by no means through with non-copyright echoes, for he was
destined next day to take part in an even stormier interview on the same
subject with Alexander Dumas fils. Bok had been publishing a series of articles
in which authors had told how they had been led to write their most famous
books, and he wanted Dumas to tell "How I Came to Write 'Camille.'"</p>
<p>To act as translator this time, Bok took a trusted friend with him, whose
services he found were needed, as Dumas was absolutely without knowledge of
English. No sooner was the editor's request made known to him than the storm
broke. Dumas, hotly excited, denounced the Americans as robbers who had
deprived him of his rightful returns on his book and play, and ended by
declaring that he would trust no American editor or publisher.</p>
<p>The mutual friend explained the new copyright conditions and declared that
Bok intended to treat the author honorably. But Dumas was not to be mollified.
He launched forth upon a new arraignment of the Americans; dishonesty was bred
in their bones! and they were robbers by instinct. All of this distinctly
nettled Bok's Americanism. The interpreting friend finally suggested that the
article should be written while Bok was in Paris; that he should be notified
when the manuscript was ready, that he should then appear with the actual money
in hand in French notes; and that Dumas should give Bok the manuscript when Bok
handed Dumas the money.</p>
<p>"After I count it," said Dumas.</p>
<p>This was the last straw!</p>
<p>"Pray ask him," Bok suggested to the interpreter, "what assurance I have
that he will deliver the manuscript to me after he has the money." The friend
protested against translating this thrust, but Bok insisted, and Dumas, not
knowing what was coming, insisted that the message be given him. When it was,
the man was a study; he became livid with rage.</p>
<p>"But," persisted Bok, "say to Monsieur Dumas that I have the same privilege
of distrusting him as he apparently has of distrusting me."</p>
<p>And Bok can still see the violent gesticulations of the storming French
author, his face burning with passionate anger, as the two left him.</p>
<p>Edward Bok now sincerely hoped that his encounters with the absence of a law
that has been met were at an end!</p>
<p>Rosa Bonheur, the painter of "The Horse Fair," had been represented to Bok
as another recluse who was as inaccessible as Kate Greenaway. He had known of
the painter's intimate relations with the ex-Empress Eugenie, and desired to
get these reminiscences. Everybody dissuaded him; but again taking a French
friend he made the journey to Fontainebleau, where the artist lived in a
chateau in the little village of By.</p>
<p>A group of dogs, great, magnificent tawny creatures, welcomed the two
visitors to the chateau; and the most powerful door that Bok had ever seen, as
securely bolted as that of a cell, told of the inaccessibility of the mistress
of the house. Two blue-frocked peasants explained how impossible it was for any
one to see their mistress, so Bok asked permission to come in and write her a
note.</p>
<p>This was granted; and then, as in the case of Kate Greenaway, Rosa Bonheur
herself walked into the hall, in a velvet jacket, dressed, as she always was,
in man's attire. A delightful smile lighted the strong face, surmounted by a
shock of gray hair, cut short at the back; and from the moment of her first
welcome there was no doubt of her cordiality to the few who were fortunate
enough to work their way into her presence. It was a wonderful afternoon, spent
in the painter's studio in the upper part of the chateau; and Bok carried away
with him the promise of Rosa Bonheur to write the story of her life for
publication in the magazine.</p>
<p>On his return to London the editor found that Charles Dana Gibson had
settled down there for a time. Bok had always wanted Gibson to depict the
characters of Dickens; and he felt that this was the opportunity, while the
artist was in London and could get the atmosphere for his work. Gibson was as
keen for the idea as was Bok, and so the two arranged the series which was
subsequently published.</p>
<p>On his way to his steamer to sail for home, Bok visited "Ian Maclaren,"
whose Bonnie Brier Bush stories were then in great vogue, and not only
contracted for Doctor Watson's stories of the immediate future, but arranged
with him for a series of articles which, for two years thereafter, was
published in the magazine.</p>
<p>The editor now sailed for home, content with his assembly of foreign
"features."</p>
<p>On the steamer, Bok heard of the recent discovery of some unpublished
letters by Louisa May Alcott, written to five girls, and before returning to
Philadelphia, he went to Boston, got into touch with the executors of the will
of Miss Alcott, brought the letters back with him to read, and upon reaching
Philadelphia, wired his acceptance of them for publication.</p>
<p>But the traveller was not at once to enjoy his home. After only a day in
Philadelphia he took a train for Indianapolis. Here lived the most thoroughly
American writer of the day, in Bok's estimation: James Whitcomb Riley. An
arrangement, perfected before his European visit, had secured to Bok
practically exclusive rights to all the output of his Chicago friend Eugene
Field, and he felt that Riley's work would admirably complement that of Field.
This Bok explained to Riley, who readily fell in with the idea, and the editor
returned to Philadelphia with a contract to see Riley's next dozen poems. A
little later Field passed away. His last poem, "The Dream Ship," and his
posthumous story "The Werewolf" appeared in The Ladies' Home Journal.</p>
<p>A second series of articles was also arranged for with Mr. Harrison, in
which he was to depict, in a personal way, the life of a President of the
United States, the domestic life of the White House, and the financial
arrangements made by the government for the care of the chief executive and his
family. The first series of articles by the former President had been very
successful; Bok felt that they had accomplished much in making his women
readers familiar with their country and the machinery of its government. After
this, which had been undeniably solid reading, Bok reasoned that the
supplementary articles, in lighter vein, would serve as a sort of dessert. And
so it proved.</p>
<p>Bok now devoted his attention to strengthening the fiction in his magazine.
He sought Mark Twain, and bought his two new stories; he secured from Bret
Harte a tale which he had just finished; and then ran the gamut of the best
fiction writers of the day, and secured their best output. Marion Crawford,
Conan Doyle, Sarah Orne Jewett, John Kendrick Bangs, Kate Douglas Wiggin,
Hamlin Garland, Mrs. Burton Harrison, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Mary E. Wilkins,
Jerome K. Jerome, Anthony Hope, Joel Chandler Harris, and others followed in
rapid succession.</p>
<p>He next turned for a moment to his religious department, decided that it
needed a freshening of interest, and secured Dwight L. Moody, whose evangelical
work was then so prominently in the public eye, to conduct "Mr. Moody's Bible
Class" in the magazine--practically a study of the stated Bible lesson of the
month with explanation in Moody's simple and effective style.</p>
<p>The authors for whom the Journal was now publishing attracted the attention
of all the writers of the day, and the supply of good material became too great
for its capacity. Bok studied the mechanical makeup, and felt that by some
method he must find more room in the front portion. He had allotted the first
third of the magazine to the general literary contents and the latter
two-thirds to departmental features. Toward the close of the number, the
departments narrowed down from full pages to single columns with advertisements
on each side.</p>
<p>One day Bok was handling a story by Rudyard Kipling which had overrun the
space allowed for it in the front. The story had come late, and the rest of the
front portion of the magazine had gone to press. The editor was in a quandary
what to do with the two remaining columns of the Kipling tale. There were only
two pages open, and these were at the back. He remade those pages, and
continued the story from pages 6 and 7 to pages 38 and 39.</p>
<p>At once Bok saw that this was an instance where "necessity was the mother of
invention." He realized that if he could run some of his front material over to
the back he would relieve the pressure at the front, present a more varied
contents there, and make his advertisements more valuable by putting them next
to the most expensive material in the magazine.</p>
<p>In the next issue he combined some of his smaller departments in the back;
and thus, in 1896, he inaugurated the method of "running over into the back"
which has now become a recognized principle in the make-up of magazines of
larger size. At first, Bok's readers objected, but he explained why he did it;
that they were the benefiters by the plan; and, so far as readers can be
satisfied with what is, at best, an awkward method of presentation, they were
content. Today the practice is undoubtedly followed to excess, some magazines
carrying as much as eighty and ninety columns over from the front to the back;
from such abuse it will, of course, free itself either by a return to the
original method of make-up or by the adoption of some other less-irritating
plan.</p>
<p>In his reading about the America of the past, Bok had been impressed by the
unusual amount of interesting personal material that constituted what is termed
unwritten history--original events of tremendous personal appeal in which great
personalities figured but which had not sufficient historical importance to
have been included in American history. Bok determined to please his older
readers by harking back to the past and at the same time acquainting the
younger generation with the picturesque events which had preceded their
time.</p>
<p>He also believed that if he could "dress up" the past, he could arrest the
attention of a generation which was too likely to boast of its interest only in
the present and the future. He took a course of reading and consulted with Mr.
Charles A. Dana, editor of the New York Sun, who had become interested in his
work and had written him several voluntary letters of commendation. Mr. Dana
gave material help in the selection of subjects and writers; and was intensely
amused and interested by the manner in which his youthful confrere "dressed up"
the titles of what might otherwise have looked like commonplace articles.</p>
<p>"I know," said Bok to the elder editor, "it smacks a little of the
sensational, Mr. Dana, but the purpose I have in mind of showing the young
people of to-day that some great things happened before they came on the stage
seems to me to make it worth while."</p>
<p>Mr. Dana agreed with this view, supplemented every effort of the
Philadelphia editor in several subsequent talks, and in 1897 The Ladies' Home
Journal began one of the most popular series it ever published. It was called
"Great Personal Events," and the picturesque titles explained them. He first
pictured the enthusiastic evening "When Jenny Lind Sang in Castle Garden," and,
as Bok added to pique curiosity, "when people paid $20 to sit in rowboats to
hear the Swedish nightingale."</p>
<p>This was followed by an account of the astonishing episode "When Henry Ward
Beecher Sold Slaves in Plymouth Pulpit"; the picturesque journey "When Louis
Kossuth Rode Up Broadway"; the triumphant tour "When General Grant Went Round
the World"; the forgotten story of "When an Actress Was the Lady of the White
House"; the sensational striking of the gold vein in 1849, "When Mackay Struck
the Great Bonanza"; the hitherto little-known instance "When Louis Philippe
Taught School in Philadelphia"; and even the lesser-known fact of the residence
of the brother of Napoleon Bonaparte in America, "When the King of Spain Lived
on the Banks of the Schuylkill"; while the story of "When John Wesley Preached
in Georgia" surprised nearly every Methodist, as so few had known that the
founder of their church had ever visited America. Each month picturesque event
followed graphic happening, and never was unwritten history more readily read
by the young, or the memories of the older folk more catered to than in this
series which won new friends for the magazine on every hand.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_24">XXI. A Signal Piece of
Constructive Work</a></h3>
<p>The influence of his grandfather and the injunction of his grandmother to
her sons that each "should make the world a better or a more beautiful place to
live in" now began to be manifest in the grandson. Edward Bok was unconscious
that it was this influence. What directly led him to the signal piece of
construction in which he engaged was the wretched architecture of small houses.
As he travelled through the United States he was appalled by it. Where the
houses were not positively ugly, they were, to him, repellently ornate. Money
was wasted on useless turrets, filigree work, or machine-made ornamentation.
Bok found out that these small householders never employed an architect, but
that the houses were put up by builders from their own plans.</p>
<p>Bok felt a keen desire to take hold of the small American house and make it
architecturally better. He foresaw, however, that the subject would finally
include small gardening and interior decoration. He feared that the subject
would become too large for the magazine, which was already feeling the pressure
of the material which he was securing. He suggested, therefore, to Mr. Curtis
that they purchase a little magazine published in Buffalo, N. Y., called
Country Life, and develop it into a first-class periodical devoted to the
general subject of a better American architecture, gardening, and interior
decoration, with special application to the small house. The magazine was
purchased, and while Bok was collecting his material for a number of issues
ahead, he edited and issued, for copyright purposes, a four-page magazine.</p>
<p>An opportunity now came to Mr. Curtis to purchase The Saturday Evening Post,
a Philadelphia weekly of honored prestige, founded by Benjamin Franklin. It was
apparent at once that the company could not embark upon the development of two
magazines at the same time, and as a larger field was seen for The Saturday
Evening Post, it was decided to leave Country Life in abeyance for the
present.</p>
<p>Mr. Frank Doubleday, having left the Scribners and started a
publishing-house of his own, asked Bok to transfer to him the copyright and
good will of Country Life--seeing that there was little chance for The Curtis
Publishing Company to undertake its publication. Mr. Curtis was willing, but he
knew that Bok had set his heart on the new magazine and left it for him to
decide. The editor realized, as the Doubleday Company could take up the
magazine at once, the unfairness of holding indefinitely the field against them
by the publication of a mere copyright periodical. And so, with a feeling as if
he were giving up his child to another father, Bok arranged that The Curtis
Publishing Company should transfer to the Doubleday, Page Company all rights to
the title and periodical of which the present beautiful publication Country
Life is the outgrowth.</p>
<p>Bok now turned to The Ladies' Home Journal as his medium for making the
small-house architecture of America better. He realized the limitation of
space, but decided to do the best he could under the circumstances. He believed
he might serve thousands of his readers if he could make it possible for them
to secure, at moderate cost, plans for well-designed houses by the leading
domestic architects in the country. He consulted a number of architects, only
to find them unalterably opposed to the idea. They disliked the publicity of
magazine presentation; prices differed too much in various parts of the
country; and they did not care to risk the criticism of their contemporaries.
It was "cheapening" their profession!</p>
<p>Bok saw that he should have to blaze the way and demonstrate the futility of
these arguments. At last he persuaded one architect to co-operate with him, and
in 1895 began the publication of a series of houses which could be built,
approximately, for from one thousand five hundred dollars to five thousand
dollars. The idea attracted attention at once, and the architect-author was
swamped with letters and inquiries regarding his plans.</p>
<p>This proved Bok's instinct to be correct as to the public willingness to
accept such designs; upon this proof he succeeded in winning over two
additional architects to make plans. He offered his readers full building
specifications and plans to scale of the houses with estimates from four
builders in different parts of the United States for five dollars a set. The
plans and specifications were so complete in every detail that any builder
could build the house from them.</p>
<p>A storm of criticism now arose from architects and builders all over the
country, the architects claiming that Bok was taking "the bread out of their
mouths" by the sale of plans, and local builders vigorously questioned the
accuracy of the estimates. But Bok knew he was right and persevered.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely he won the approval of the leading architects, who saw
that he was appealing to a class of house-builders who could not afford to pay
an architect's fee, and that, with his wide circulation, he might become an
influence for better architecture through these small houses. The sets of plans
and specifications sold by the thousands. It was not long before the magazine
was able to present small-house plans by the foremost architects of the
country, whose services the average householder could otherwise never have
dreamed of securing.</p>
<p>Bok not only saw an opportunity to better the exterior of the small houses,
but he determined that each plan published should provide for two essentials:
every servant's room should have two windows to insure cross-ventilation, and
contain twice the number of cubic feet usually given to such rooms; and in
place of the American parlor, which he considered a useless room, should be
substituted either a living-room or a library. He did not point to these
improvements; every plan simply presented the larger servant's room and did not
present a parlor. It is a singular fact that of the tens of thousands of plans
sold, not a purchaser ever noticed the absence of a parlor except one woman in
Brookline, Mass., who, in erecting a group of twenty-five "Journal houses,"
discovered after she had built ten that not one contained a parlor!</p>
<p>"Ladies' Home Journal houses" were now going up in communities all over the
country, and Bok determined to prove that they could be erected for the prices
given. Accordingly, he published a prize offer of generous amount for the best
set of exterior and interior photographs of a house built after a Journal plan
within the published price. Five other and smaller prizes were also offered. A
legally attested builder's declaration was to accompany each set of
photographs. The sets immediately began to come in, until over five thousand
had been received. Bok selected the best of these, awarded the prizes, and
began the presentation of the houses actually built after the published
plans.</p>
<p>Of course this publication gave fresh impetus to the whole scheme;
prospective house-builders pointed their builders to the proof given, and
additional thousands of sets of plans were sold. The little houses became
better and better in architecture as the series went on, and occasionally a
plan for a house costing as high as ten thousand dollars was given.</p>
<p>For nearly twenty-five years Bok continued to publish pictures of houses and
plans. Entire colonies of "Ladies' Home Journal houses" have sprung up, and
building promoters have built complete suburban developments with them. How
many of these homes have been erected it is, of course, impossible to say; the
number certainly runs into the thousands.</p>
<p>It was one of the most constructive and far-reaching pieces of work that Bok
did during his editorial career--a fact now recognized by all architects.
Shortly before Stanford White passed away, he wrote: "I firmly believe that
Edward Bok has more completely influenced American domestic architecture for
the better than any man in this generation. When he began, I was short-sighted
enough to discourage him, and refused to cooperate with him. If Bok came to me
now, I would not only make plans for him, but I would waive any fee for them in
retribution for my early mistake."</p>
<p>Bok then turned to the subject of the garden for the small house, and the
development of the grounds around the homes which he had been instrumental in
putting on the earth. He encountered no opposition here. The publication of
small gardens for small houses finally ran into hundreds of pages, the magazine
supplying planting plans and full directions as to when and how to plant-this
time without cost.</p>
<p>Next the editor decided to see what he could do for the better and simpler
furnishing of the small American home. Here was a field almost limitless in
possible improvement, but he wanted to approach it in a new way. The best
method baffled him until one day he met a woman friend who told him that she
was on her way to a funeral at a friend's home.</p>
<p>"I didn't know you were so well acquainted with Mrs. S--," said Bok.</p>
<p>"I wasn't, as a matter of fact," replied the woman. "I'll be perfectly
frank; I am going to the funeral just to see how Mrs. S--'s house is furnished.
She was always thought to have great taste, you know, and, whether you know it
or not, a woman is always keen to look into another woman's home."</p>
<p>Bok realized that he had found the method of presentation for his
interior-furnishing plan if he could secure photographs of the most carefully
furnished homes in America. He immediately employed the best available expert,
and within six months there came to him an assorted collection of over a
thousand photographs of well-furnished rooms. The best were selected, and a
series of photographic pages called "Inside of 100 Homes" was begun. The
editor's woman friend had correctly pointed the way to him, for this series won
for his magazine the enviable distinction of being the first magazine of
standing to reach the then marvellous record of a circulation of one million
copies a month. The editions containing the series were sold out as fast as
they could be printed.</p>
<p>The editor followed this up with another successful series, again pictorial.
He realized that to explain good taste in furnishing by text was almost
impossible. So he started a series of all-picture pages called "Good Taste and
Bad Taste." He presented a chair that was bad in lines and either useless or
uncomfortable to sit in, and explained where and why it was bad; and then put a
good chair next to it, and explained where and why it was good.</p>
<p>The lesson to the eye was simply and directly effective; the pictures told
their story as no printed word could have done, and furniture manufacturers and
dealers all over the country, feeling the pressure from their customers, began
to put on the market the tables, chairs, divans, bedsteads, and dressing-tables
which the magazine was portraying as examples of good taste. It was amazing
that, within five years, the physical appearance of domestic furniture in the
stores completely changed.</p>
<p>The next undertaking was a systematic plan for improving the pictures on the
walls of the American home. Bok was employing the best artists of the day:
Edwin A. Abbey, Howard Pyle, Charles Dana Gibson, W. L. Taylor, Albert Lynch,
Will H. Low, W. T. Smedley, Irving R. Wiles, and others. As his magazine was
rolled to go through the mails, the pictures naturally suffered; Bok therefore
decided to print a special edition of each important picture that he published,
an edition on plate-paper, without text, and offered to his readers at ten
cents a copy. Within a year he had sold nearly one hundred thousand copies,
such pictures as W. L. Taylor's "The Hanging of the Crane" and "Home-Keeping
Hearts" being particularly popular.</p>
<p>Pictures were difficult to advertise successfully; it was before the
full-color press had become practicable for rapid magazine work; and even the
large-page black-and-white reproductions which Bok could give in his magazine
did not, of course, show the beauty of the original paintings, the majority of
which were in full color. He accordingly made arrangements with art publishers
to print his pictures in their original colors; then he determined to give the
public an opportunity to see what the pictures themselves looked like.</p>
<p>He asked his art editor to select the two hundred and fifty best pictures
and frame them. Then he engaged the art gallery of the Philadelphia Art Club,
and advertised an exhibition of the original paintings. No admission was
charged. The gallery was put into gala attire, and the pictures were well hung.
The exhibition, which was continued for two weeks, was visited by over fifteen
thousand persons.</p>
<p>His success here induced Bok to take the collection to New York. The
galleries of the American Art Association were offered him, but he decided to
rent the ballroom of the Hotel Waldorf. The hotel was then new; it was the talk
not only of the town but of the country, while the ballroom had been pictured
far and wide. It would have a publicity value. He could secure the room for
only four days, but he determined to make the most of the short time. The
exhibition was well advertised; a "private view" was given the evening before
the opening day, and when, at nine o'clock the following morning, the doors of
the exhibition were thrown open, over a thousand persons were waiting in
line.</p>
<p>The hotel authorities had to resort to a special cordon of police to handle
the crowds, and within four days over seventeen thousand persons had seen the
pictures. On the last evening it was after midnight before the doors could be
closed to the waiting-line. Boston was next visited, and there, at the Art Club
Gallery, the previous successes were repeated. Within two weeks over
twenty-eight thousand persons visited the exhibition.</p>
<p>Other cities now clamored for a sight of the pictures, and it was finally
decided to end the exhibitions by a visit to Chicago. The success here exceeded
that in any of the other cities. The banquet-hall of the Auditorium Hotel had
been engaged; over two thousand persons were continually in a waiting-line
outside, and within a week nearly thirty thousand persons pushed and jostled
themselves into the gallery. Over eight thousand persons in all had viewed the
pictures in the four cities.</p>
<p>The exhibition was immediately followed by the publication of a portfolio of
the ten pictures that had proved the greatest favorites. These were printed on
plate-paper and the portfolio was offered by Bok to his readers for one dollar.
The first thousand sets were exhausted within a fortnight. A second thousand
were printed, and these were quickly sold out.</p>
<p>Bok's next enterprise was to get his pictures into the homes of the country
on a larger scale; he determined to work through the churches. He selected the
fifty best pictures, made them into a set and offered first a hundred sets to
selected schools, which were at once taken. Then he offered two hundred and
fifty sets to churches to sell at their fairs. The managers were to promise to
erect a Ladies' Home Journal booth (which Bok knew, of course, would be most
effective advertising), and the pictures were to sell at twenty-five and fifty
cents each, with some at a dollar each. The set was offered to the churches for
five dollars: the actual cost of reproduction and expressage. On the day after
the publication of the magazine containing the offer, enough telegraphic orders
were received to absorb the entire edition. A second edition was immediately
printed; and finally ten editions, four thousand sets in all, were absorbed
before the demand was filled. By this method, two hundred thousand pictures had
been introduced into American homes, and over one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars in money had been raised by the churches as their portion.</p>
<p>But all this was simply to lead up to the realization of Bok's cherished
dream: the reproduction, in enormous numbers, of the greatest pictures in the
world in their original colors. The plan, however, was not for the moment
feasible: the cost of the four-color process was at that time prohibitive, and
Bok had to abandon it. But he never lost sight of it. He knew the hour would
come when he could carry it out, and he bided his time.</p>
<p>It was not until years later that his opportunity came, when he immediately
made up his mind to seize it. The magazine had installed a battery of
four-color presses; the color-work in the periodical was attracting universal
attention, and after all stages of experimentation had been passed, Bok decided
to make his dream a reality. He sought the co-operation of the owners of the
greatest private art galleries in the country: J. Pierpont Morgan, Henry C.
Frick, Joseph E. Widener, George W. Elkins, John G. Johnson, Charles P. Taft,
Mrs. John L. Gardner, Charles L. Freer, Mrs. Havemeyer, and the owners of the
Benjamin Altman Collection, and sought permission to reproduce their greatest
paintings.</p>
<p>Although each felt doubtful of the ability of any process adequately to
reproduce their masterpieces, the owners heartily co-operated with Bok. But
Bok's co-editors discouraged his plan, since it would involve endless labor,
the exclusive services of a corps of photographers and engravers, and the
employment of the most careful pressmen available in the United States. The
editor realized that the obstacles were numerous and that the expense would be
enormous; but he felt sure that the American public was ready for his idea. And
early in 1912 he announced his series and began its publication.</p>
<p>The most wonderful Rembrandt, Velasquez, Turner, Hobbema, Van Dyck, Raphael,
Frans Hals, Romney, Gainsborough, Whistler, Corot, Mauve, Vermeer, Fragonard,
Botticelli, and Titian reproductions followed in such rapid succession as
fairly to daze the magazine readers. Four pictures were given in each number,
and the faithfulness of the reproductions astonished even their owners. The
success of the series was beyond Bok's own best hopes. He was printing and
selling one and three-quarter million copies of each issue of his magazine; and
before he was through he had presented to American homes throughout the breadth
of the country over seventy million reproductions of forty separate
master-pieces of art.</p>
<p>The dream of years had come true.</p>
<p>Bok had begun with the exterior of the small American house and made an
impression upon it; he had brought the love of flowers into the hearts of
thousands of small householders who had never thought they could have an
artistic garden within a small area; he had changed the lines of furniture, and
he had put better art on the walls of these homes. He had conceived a
full-rounded scheme, and he had carried it out.</p>
<p>It was a peculiar satisfaction to Bok that Theodore Roosevelt once summed up
this piece of work in these words: "Bok is the only man I ever heard of who
changed, for the better, the architecture of an entire nation, and he did it so
quickly and yet so effectively that we didn't know it was begun before it was
finished. That is a mighty big job for one man to have done."</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_25">XXII. An Adventure in Civic and
Private Art</a></h3>
<p>Edward Bok now turned his attention to those influences of a more public
nature which he felt could contribute to elevate the standard of public
taste.</p>
<p>He was surprised, on talking with furnishers of homes, to learn to what
extent women whose husbands had recently acquired means would refer to certain
styles of decoration and hangings which they had seen in the Pullman
parlor-cars. He had never seriously regarded the influence of the furnishing of
these cars upon the travelling public; now he realized that, in a decorative
sense, they were a distinct factor and a very unfortunate one.</p>
<p>For in those days, twenty years ago, the decoration of the Pullman
parlor-car was atrocious. Colors were in riotous discord; every foot of
wood-panelling was carved and ornamented, nothing being left of the grain of
even the most beautiful woods; gilt was recklessly laid on everywhere
regardless of its fitness or relation. The hangings in the cars were not only
in bad taste, but distinctly unsanitary; the heaviest velvets and showiest
plushes were used; mirrors with bronzed and redplushed frames were the order of
the day; cord porti&egrave;res, lambrequins, and tasselled fringes were still
in vogue in these cars. It was a veritable riot of the worst conceivable ideas;
and it was this standard that these women of the new-money class were accepting
and introducing into their homes!</p>
<p>Bok wrote an editorial calling attention to these facts. The Pullman Company
paid no attention to it, but the railroad journals did. With one accord they
seized the cudgel which Bok had raised, and a series of hammerings began. The
Pullman conductors began to report to their division chiefs that the passengers
were criticising the cars, and the company at last woke up. It issued a cynical
rejoinder; whereupon Bok wrote another editorial, and the railroad journals
once more joined in the chorus.</p>
<p>The president of a large Western railroad wrote to Bok that he agreed
absolutely with his position, and asked whether he had any definite suggestions
to offer for the improvement of some new cars which they were about to order.
Bok engaged two of the best architects and decorators in the country, and
submitted the results to the officials of the railroad company, who approved of
them heartily. The Pullman Company did not take very kindly, however, to
suggestions thus brought to them. But a current had been started; the attention
of the travelling public had been drawn for the first time to the wretched
decoration of the cars; and public sentiment was beginning to be vocal.</p>
<p>The first change came when a new dining-car on the Chicago, Burlington and
Quincy Railroad suddenly appeared. It was an artistically treated
Flemish-oak-panelled car with longitudinal beams and cross-beams, giving the
impression of a ceiling-beamed room. Between the "beams" was a quiet tone of
deep yellow. The sides of the car were wainscoting of plain surface done in a
Flemish stain rubbed down to a dull finish. The grain of the wood was allowed
to serve as decoration; there was no carving. The whole tone of the car was
that of the rich color of the sunflower. The effect upon the travelling public
was instantaneous. Every passenger commented favorably on the car.</p>
<p>The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad now followed suit by introducing
a new Pullman chair-car. The hideous and germ-laden plush or velvet curtains
were gone, and leather hangings of a rich tone took their place. All the
grill-work of a bygone age was missing; likewise the rope curtains. The woods
were left to show the grain; no carving was visible anywhere. The car was a
relief to the eye, beautiful and simple, and easy to keep clean. Again the
public observed, and expressed its pleasure.</p>
<p>The Pullman people now saw the drift, and wisely reorganized their
decorative department. Only those who remember the Pullman parlor-car of twenty
years ago can realize how long a step it is from the atrociously decorated,
unsanitary vehicle of that day to the simple car of to-day.</p>
<p>It was only a step from the Pullman car to the landscape outside, and Bok
next decided to see what he could do toward eliminating the hideous bill-board
advertisements which defaced the landscape along the lines of the principal
roads. He found a willing ally in this idea in Mr. J. Horace McFarland, of
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, one of the most skilful photographers in the country,
and the president of The American Civic Association. McFarland and Bok worked
together; they took innumerable photographs, and began to publish them, calling
public attention to the intrusion upon the public eye.</p>
<p>Page after page appeared in the magazine, and after a few months these
roused public discussion as to legal control of this class of advertising. Bok
meanwhile called the attention of women's clubs and other civic organizations
to the question, and urged that they clean their towns of the obnoxious
bill-boards. Legislative measures regulating the size, character, and location
of bill-boards were introduced in various States, a tax on each bill-board was
suggested in other States, and the agitation began to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Bok now called upon his readers in general to help by offering a series of
prizes totalling several thousands of dollars for two photographs, one showing
a fence, barn, or outbuilding painted with an advertisement or having a
bill-board attached to it, or a field with a bill-board in it, and a second
photograph of the same spot showing the advertisement removed, with an
accompanying affidavit of the owner of the property, legally attested,
asserting that the advertisement had been permanently removed. Hundreds of
photographs poured in, scores of prizes were awarded, the results were
published, and requests came in for a second series of prizes, which were duly
awarded.</p>
<p>While Bok did not solve the problem of bill-board advertising, and while in
some parts of the country it is a more flagrant nuisance to-day than ever
before, he had started the first serious agitation against bill-board
advertising of bad design, detrimental, from its location, to landscape beauty.
He succeeded in getting rid of a huge bill-board which had been placed at the
most picturesque spot at Niagara Falls; and hearing of "the largest
advertisement sign in the world" to be placed on the rim of the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado, he notified the advertisers that a photograph of the sign, if it
was erected, would be immediately published in the magazine and the attention
of the women of America called to the defacement of one of the most impressive
and beautiful scenes in the world. The article to be advertised was a household
commodity, purchased by women; and the owners realized that the proposed
advertisement would not be to the benefit of their product. The sign was
abandoned.</p>
<p>Of course the advertisers whose signs were shown in the magazine immediately
threatened the withdrawal of their accounts from The Ladies' Home Journal, and
the proposed advertiser at the Grand Canyon, whose business was conspicuous in
each number of the magazine, became actively threatening. But Bok contended
that the one proposition had absolutely no relation to the other, and that if
concerns advertised in the magazine simply on the basis of his editorial policy
toward bill-board advertising, it was, to say the least, not a sound basis for
advertising. No advertising account was ever actually withdrawn.</p>
<p>In their travels about, Mr. McFarland and Bok began to note the disreputably
untidy spots which various municipalities allowed in the closest proximity to
the centre of their business life, in the most desirable residential sections,
and often adjacent to the most important municipal buildings and parks. It was
decided to select a dozen cities, pick out the most flagrant instances of spots
which were not only an eyesore and a disgrace from a municipal standpoint, but
a menace to health and meant a depreciation of real-estate value.</p>
<p>Lynn, Massachusetts, was the initial city chosen, a number of photographs
were taken, and the first of a series of "Dirty Cities" was begun in the
magazine. The effect was instantaneous. The people of Lynn rose in protest, and
the municipal authorities threatened suit against the magazine; the local
newspapers were virulent in their attacks. Without warning, they argued, Bok
had held up their city to disgrace before the entire country; the attack was
unwarranted; in bad taste; every citizen in Lynn should thereafter cease to buy
the magazine, and so the criticisms ran. In answer Bok merely pointed to the
photographs; to the fact that the camera could not lie, and that if he had
misrepresented conditions he was ready to make amends.</p>
<p>Of course the facts could not be gainsaid; local pride was aroused, and as a
result not only were the advertised "dirty spots" cleaned up, but the municipal
authorities went out and hunted around for other spots in the city, not knowing
what other photographs Bok might have had taken.</p>
<p>Trenton, New Jersey, was the next example, and the same storm of public
resentment broke loose--with exactly the same beneficial results in the end to
the city. Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, was the third one of America's "dirty
cities." Here public anger rose particularly high, the magazine practically
being barred from the news-stands. But again the result was to the lasting
benefit of the community.</p>
<p>Memphis, Tennessee, came next, but here a different spirit was met. Although
some resentment was expressed, the general feeling was that a service had been
rendered the city, and that the only wise and practical solution was for the
city to meet the situation. The result here was a group of municipal buildings
costing millions of dollars, photographs of which The Ladies' Home Journal
subsequently published with gratification to itself and to the people of
Memphis.</p>
<p>Cities throughout the country now began to look around to see whether they
had dirty spots within their limits, not knowing when the McFarland
photographers might visit them. Bok received letters from various
municipalities calling his attention to the fact that they were cognizant of
spots in their cities and were cleaning up, and asking that, if he had
photographs of these spots, they should not be published.</p>
<p>It happened that in two such instances Bok had already prepared sets of
photographs for publication. These he sent to the mayors of the respective
cities, stating that if they would return them with an additional set showing
the spots cleaned up there would be no occasion for their publication. In both
cases this was done. Atlanta, Georgia; New Haven, Connecticut; Pittsburgh,
Cincinnati, and finally Bok's own city of Philadelphia were duly chronicled in
the magazine; local storms broke and calmed down-with the spots in every
instance improved.</p>
<p>It was an interesting experiment in photographic civics. The pity of it is
that more has not been done along this and similar lines.</p>
<p>The time now came when Bok could demonstrate the willingness of his own
publishing company to do what it could to elevate the public taste in art. With
the increasing circulation of The Ladies' Home Journal and of The Saturday
Evening Post the business of the company had grown to such dimensions that in
1908 plans for a new building were started. For purposes of air and light the
vicinity of Independence Square was selected. Mr. Curtis purchased an entire
city block facing the square, and the present huge but beautiful publication
building was conceived.</p>
<p>Bok strongly believed that good art should find a place in public buildings
where large numbers of persons might find easy access to it. The proximity of
the proposed new structure to historic Independence Hall and the adjacent
buildings would make it a focal point for visitors from all parts of the
country and the world. The opportunity presented itself to put good art, within
the comprehension of a large public, into the new building, and Bok asked
permission of Mr. Curtis to introduce a strong note of mural decoration. The
idea commended itself to Mr. Curtis as adding an attraction to the building and
a contribution to public art.</p>
<p>The great public dining-room, seating over seven hundred persons, on the top
floor of the building, affording unusual lighting facilities, was first
selected; and Maxfield Parrish was engaged to paint a series of seventeen
panels to fill the large spaces between the windows and an unusually large wall
space at the end of the room. Parrish contracted to give up all other work and
devote himself to the commission which attracted him greatly.</p>
<p>For over a year he made sketches, and finally the theme was decided upon: a
bevy of youths and maidens in gala costume, on their way through gardens and
along terraces to a great fete, with pierrots and dancers and musicians on the
main wall space. It was to be a picture of happy youth and sunny gladness. Five
years after the conception of the idea the final panel was finished and
installed in the dining-room, where the series has since been admired by the
thirty to fifty thousand visitors who come to the Curtis Building each year
from foreign lands and from every State in America. No other scheme of mural
decoration was ever planned on so large a scale for a commercial building, or
so successfully carried out.</p>
<p>The great wall space of over one thousand square feet, unobstructed by a
single column, in the main foyer of the building was decided upon as the place
for the pivotal note to be struck by some mural artist. After looking carefully
over the field, Bok finally decided upon Edwin A. Abbey. He took a steamer and
visited Abbey in his English home. The artist was working on his canvases for
the State capitol at Harrisburg, and it was agreed that the commission for the
Curtis Building was to follow the completion of the State work.</p>
<p>"What subject have you in mind?" asked Abbey.</p>
<p>"None," replied Bok. "That is left entirely to you."</p>
<p>The artist and his wife looked at each other in bewilderment.</p>
<p>"Rather unusual," commented Abbey. "You have nothing in mind at all?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, except to get the best piece of work you have ever done," was the
assurance.</p>
<p>Poor Abbey! His life had been made so tortuous by suggestions, ideas, yes,
demands made upon him in the work of the Harrisburg panels upon which he was
engaged, that a commission in which he was to have free scope, his brush full
leeway, with no one making suggestions but himself and Mrs. Abbey, seemed like
a dream. When he explained this, Bok assured him that was exactly what he was
offering him: a piece of work, the subject to be his own selection, with the
assurance of absolute liberty to carry out his own ideas. Never was an artist
more elated.</p>
<p>"Then, I'll give you the best piece of work of my life," said Abbey.</p>
<p>"Perhaps there is some subject which you have long wished to paint rather
than any other," asked Bok, "that might fit our purpose admirably?"</p>
<p>There was: a theme that he had started as a fresco for Mrs. Abbey's bedroom.
But it would not answer this purpose at all, although he confessed he would
rather paint it than any subject in the realm of all literature and art.</p>
<p>"And the subject?" asked Bok.</p>
<p>"The Grove of Academe," replied Abbey, and the eyes of the artist and his
wife were riveted on the editor.</p>
<p>"With Plato and his disciples?" asked Bok.</p>
<p>"The same," said Abbey. "But you see it wouldn't fit."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't fit?" echoed Bok. "Why, it's the very thing."</p>
<p>Abbey and his wife were now like two happy children. Mrs. Abbey fetched the
sketches which her husband had begun years ago, and when Bok saw them he was
delighted. He realized at once that conditions and choice would conspire to
produce Abbey's greatest piece of mural work.</p>
<p>The arrangements were quickly settled; the Curtis architect had accompanied
Bok to explain the architectural possibilities to Abbey, and when the artist
bade good-by to the two at the railroad station, his last words were:</p>
<p>"Bok, you are going to get the best Abbey in the world."</p>
<p>And Mrs. Abbey echoed the prophecy!</p>
<p>But Fate intervened. On the day after Abbey had stretched his great canvas
in Sargent's studio in London, expecting to begin his work the following week,
he suddenly passed away, and what would, in all likelihood, have been Edwin
Abbey's mural masterpiece was lost to the world.</p>
<p>Assured of Mrs. Abbey's willingness to have another artist take the theme of
the Grove of Academe and carry it out as a mural decoration, Bok turned to
Howard Pyle. He knew Pyle had made a study of Plato, and believed that, with
his knowledge and love of the work of the Athenian philosopher, a good
decoration would result. Pyle was then in Italy; Bok telephoned the painter's
home in Wilmington, Delaware, to get his address, only to be told that an hour
earlier word had been received by the family that Pyle had been fatally
stricken the day before.</p>
<p>Once more Bok went over the field of mural art and decided this time that he
would go far afield, and present his idea to Boutet de Monvel, the French
decorative artist. Bok had been much impressed with some decorative work by De
Monvel which had just been exhibited in New York. By letter he laid the
proposition in detail before the artist, asked for a subject, and stipulated
that if the details could be arranged the artist should visit the building and
see the place and surroundings for himself. After a lengthy correspondence, and
sketches submitted and corrected, a plan for what promised to be a most unusual
and artistically decorative panel was arrived at.</p>
<p>The date for M. de Monvel's visit to Philadelphia was fixed, a final letter
from the artist reached Bok on a Monday morning, in which a few remaining
details were satisfactorily cleared up, and a cable was sent assuring De Monvel
of the entire satisfaction of the company with his final sketches and
arrangements. The following morning Bok picked up his newspaper to read that
Boutet de Monvel had suddenly passed away in Paris the previous evening!</p>
<p>Bok, thoroughly bewildered, began to feel as if some fatal star hung over
his cherished decoration. Three times in succession he had met the same decree
of fate.</p>
<p>He consulted six of the leading mural decorators in America, asking whether
they would consent, not in competition, to submit each a finished full-color
sketch of the subject which he believed fitted for the place in mind; they
could take the Grove of Academe or not, as they chose; the subject was to be of
their own selection. Each artist was to receive a generous fee for his sketch,
whether accepted or rejected. In due time, the six sketches were received;
impartial judges were selected, no names were attached to the sketches, several
conferences were held, and all the sketches were rejected!</p>
<p>Bok was still exactly where he started, while the building was nearly
complete, with no mural for the large place so insistently demanding it.</p>
<p>He now recalled a marvellous stage-curtain entirely of glass mosaic executed
by Louis C. Tiffany, of New York, for the Municipal Theatre at Mexico City. The
work had attracted universal attention at its exhibition, art critics and
connoisseurs had praised it unstintingly, and Bok decided to experiment in that
direction.</p>
<p>Just as the ancient Egyptians and Persians had used glazed brick and tile,
set in cement, as their form of wall decoration, so Mr. Tiffany had used
favrile glass, set in cement. The luminosity was marvellous; the effect of
light upon the glass was unbelievably beautiful, and the colorings obtained
were a joy to the senses.</p>
<p>Here was not only a new method in wall decoration, but one that was entirely
practicable. Glass would not craze like tiles or mosaic; it would not crinkle
as will canvas; it needed no varnish. It would retain its color, freshness, and
beauty, and water would readily cleanse it from dust.</p>
<p>He sought Mr. Tiffany, who was enthusiastic over the idea of making an
example of his mosaic glass of such dimensions which should remain in this
country, and gladly offered to co-operate. But, try as he might, Bok could not
secure an adequate sketch for Mr. Tiffany to carry out. Then he recalled that
one day while at Maxfield Parrish's summer home in New Hampshire the artist had
told him of a dream garden which he would like to construct, not on canvas but
in reality. Bok suggested to Parrish that he come to New York. He asked him if
he could put his dream garden on canvas. The artist thought he could; in fact,
was greatly attracted to the idea; but he knew nothing of mosaic work, and was
not particularly attracted by the idea of having his work rendered in that
medium.</p>
<p>Bok took Parrish to Mr. Tiffany's studio; the two artists talked together,
the glass-worker showed the canvas-painter his work, with the result that the
two became enthusiastic to co-operate in trying the experiment. Parrish agreed
to make a sketch for Mr. Tiffany's approval, and within six months, after a
number of conferences and an equal number of sketches, they were ready to begin
the work. Bok only hoped that this time both artists would outlive their
commissions!</p>
<p>It was a huge picture to be done in glass mosaic. The space to be filled
called for over a million pieces of glass, and for a year the services of
thirty of the most skilled artisans would be required. The work had to be done
from a series of bromide photographs enlarged to a size hitherto unattempted.
But at last the decoration was completed; the finished art piece was placed on
exhibition in New York and over seven thousand persons came to see it. The
leading art critics pronounced the result to be the most amazing instance of
the tone capacity of glass-work ever achieved. It was a veritable wonder-piece,
far exceeding the utmost expression of paint and canvas.</p>
<p>For six months a group of skilled artisans worked to take the picture apart
in New York, transport it and set it into its place in Philadelphia. But at
last it was in place: the wonder-picture in glass of which painters have
declared that "mere words are only aggravating in describing this amazing
picture." Since that day over one hundred thousand visitors to the building
have sat in admiration before it.</p>
<p>The Grove of Academe was to become a Dream Garden, but it was only after six
years of incessant effort, with obstacles and interventions almost
insurmountable, that the dream became true.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_26">XXIII. Theodore Roosevelt's
Influence</a></h3>
<p>When the virile figure of Theodore Roosevelt swung down the national
highway, Bok was one of thousands of young men who felt strongly the attraction
of his personality. Colonel Roosevelt was only five years the senior of the
editor; he spoke, therefore, as one of his own years. The energy with which he
said and did things appealed to Bok. He made Americanism something more real,
more stirring than Bok had ever felt it; he explained national questions in a
way that caught Bok's fancy and came within his comprehension. Bok's lines had
been cast with many of the great men of the day, but he felt that there was
something distinctive about the personality of this man: his method of doing
things and his way of saying things. Bok observed everything Colonel Roosevelt
did and read everything he wrote.</p>
<p>The editor now sought an opportunity to know personally the man whom he
admired. It came at a dinner at the University Club, and Colonel Roosevelt
suggested that they meet there the following day for a "talk-fest." For three
hours the two talked together. The fact that Colonel Roosevelt was of Dutch
ancestry interested Bok; that Bok was actually of Dutch birth made a strong
appeal to the colonel. With his tremendous breadth of interests, Roosevelt, Bok
found, had followed him quite closely in his work, and was familiar with "its
high points," as he called them. "We must work for the same ends," said the
colonel, "you in your way, I in mine. But our lines are bound to cross. You and
I can each become good Americans by giving our best to make America better.
With the Dutch stock there is in both of us, there's no limit to what we can
do. Let's go to it." Naturally that talk left the two firm friends.</p>
<p>Bok felt somehow that he had been given a new draft of Americanism: the word
took on a new meaning for him; it stood for something different, something
deeper and finer than before. And every subsequent talk with Roosevelt deepened
the feeling and stirred Bok's deepest ambitions. "Go to it, you Dutchman,"
Roosevelt would say, and Bok would go to it. A talk with Roosevelt always left
him feeling as if mountains were the easiest things in the world to move.</p>
<p>One of Theodore Roosevelt's arguments which made a deep impression upon Bok
was that no man had a right to devote his entire life to the making of money.
"You are in a peculiar position," said the man of Oyster Bay one day to Bok;
"you are in that happy position where you can make money and do good at the
same time. A man wields a tremendous power for good or for evil who is welcomed
into a million homes and read with confidence. That's fine, and is all right so
far as it goes, and in your case it goes very far. Still, there remains more
for you to do. The public has built up for you a personality: now give that
personality to whatever interests you in contact with your immediate fellowmen:
something in your neighborhood, your city, or your State. With one hand work
and write to your national audience: let no fads sway you. Hew close to the
line. But, with the other hand, swing into the life immediately around you.
Think it over."</p>
<p>Bok did think it over. He was now realizing the dream of his life for which
he had worked: his means were sufficient to give his mother every comfort; to
install her in the most comfortable surroundings wherever she chose to live; to
make it possible for her to spend the winters in the United States and the
summers in the Netherlands, and thus to keep in touch with her family and
friends in both countries. He had for years toiled unceasingly to reach this
point: he felt he had now achieved at least one goal.</p>
<p>He had now turned instinctively to the making of a home for himself. After
an engagement of four years he had been married, on October 22, 1896, to Mary
Louise Curtis, the only child of Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus H. K. Curtis; two sons had
been born to them; he had built and was occupying a house at Merion,
Pennsylvania, a suburb six miles from the Philadelphia City Hall. When she was
in this country his mother lived with him, and also his brother, and, with a
strong belief in life insurance, he had seen to it that his family was provided
for in case of personal incapacity or of his demise. In other words, he felt
that he had put his own house in order; he had carried out what he felt is
every man's duty: to be, first of all, a careful and adequate provider for his
family. He was now at the point where he could begin to work for another goal,
the goal that he felt so few American men saw: the point in his life where he
could retire from the call of duty and follow the call of inclination.</p>
<p>At the age of forty he tried to look ahead and plan out his life as far as
he could. Barring unforeseen obstacles, he determined to retire from active
business when he reached his fiftieth year, and give the remainder of his life
over to those interests and influences which he assumed now as part of his
life, and which, at fifty, should seem to him best worth while. He realized
that in order to do this he must do two things: he must husband his financial
resources and he must begin to accumulate a mental reserve.</p>
<p>The wide public acceptance of the periodical which he edited naturally
brought a share of financial success to him. He had experienced poverty, and as
he subsequently wrote, in an article called "Why I Believe in Poverty," he was
deeply grateful for his experience. He had known what it was to be poor; he had
seen others dear to him suffer for the bare necessities; there was, in fact,
not a single step on that hard road that he had not travelled. He could,
therefore, sympathize with the fullest understanding with those similarly
situated, could help as one who knew from practice and not from theory. He
realized what a marvellous blessing poverty can be; but as a condition to
experience, to derive from it poignant lessons, and then to get out of; not as
a condition to stay in.</p>
<p>Of course many said to Bok when he wrote the article in which he expressed
these beliefs: "That's all very well; easy enough to say, but how can you get
out of it?" Bok realized that he could not definitely show any one the way. No
one had shown him. No two persons can find the same way out. Bok determined to
lift himself out of poverty because his mother was not born in it, did not
belong in it, and could not stand it. That gave him the first essential: a
purpose. Then he backed up the purpose with effort and an ever-ready
willingness to work, and to work at anything that came his way, no matter what
it was, so long as it meant "the way out." He did not pick and choose; he took
what came, and did it in the best way he knew how; and when he did not like
what he was doing he still did it as well as he could while he was doing it,
but always with an eye single to the purpose not to do it any longer than was
strictly necessary. He used every rung in the ladder as a rung to the one
above. He always gave more than his particular position or salary asked for. He
never worked by the clock; always by the job; and saw that it was well done
regardless of the time it took to do it. This meant effort, of course,
untiring, ceaseless, unsparing; and it meant work, hard as nails.</p>
<p>He was particularly careful never to live up to his income; and as his
income increased he increased not the percentage of expenditure but the
percentage of saving. Thrift was, of course, inborn with him as a Dutchman, but
the necessity for it as a prime factor in life was burned into him by his
experience with poverty. But he interpreted thrift not as a trait of
niggardliness, but as Theodore Roosevelt interpreted it: common sense applied
to spending.</p>
<p>At forty, therefore, he felt he had learned the first essential to carrying
out his idea of retirement at fifty.</p>
<p>The second essential--varied interests outside of his business upon which he
could rely on relinquishing his duties--he had not cultivated. He had quite
naturally, in line with his belief that concentration means success, immersed
himself in his business to the exclusion of almost everything else. He felt
that he could now spare a certain percentage of his time to follow Theodore
Roosevelt's ideas and let the breezes of other worlds blow over him. In that
way he could do as Roosevelt suggested and as Bok now firmly believed was
right: he could develop himself along broader lines, albeit the lines of his
daily work were broadening in and of themselves, and he could so develop a new
set of inner resources upon which he could draw when the time came to
relinquish his editorial position.</p>
<p>He saw, on every side, the pathetic figures of men who could not let go
after their greatest usefulness was past; of other men who dropped before they
realized their arrival at the end of the road; and, most pathetic of all, of
men who having retired, but because of lack of inner resources did not know
what to do with themselves, had become a trial to themselves, their families,
and their communities.</p>
<p>Bok decided that, given health and mental freshness, he would say good-by to
his public before his public might decide to say good-by to him. So, at forty,
he candidly faced the facts of life and began to prepare himself for his
retirement at fifty under circumstances that would be of his own making and not
those of others.</p>
<p>And thereby Edward Bok proved that he was still, by instinct, a Dutchman,
and had not in his thirty-four years of residence in the United States become
so thoroughly Americanized as he believed.</p>
<p>However, it was an American, albeit of Dutch extraction, one whom he
believed to be the greatest American in his own day, who had set him thinking
and shown him the way.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_27">XXIV. Theodore Roosevelt's
Anonymous Editorial Work</a></h3>
<p>While Theodore Roosevelt was President of the United States, Bok was sitting
one evening talking with him, when suddenly Mr. Roosevelt turned to him and
said with his usual emphasis: "Bok, I envy you your power with your
public."</p>
<p>The editor was frankly puzzled.</p>
<p>"That is a strange remark from the President of the United States," he
replied.</p>
<p>"You may think so," was the rejoinder. "But listen. When do I get the ear of
the public? In its busiest moments. My messages are printed in the newspapers
and read hurriedly, mostly by men in trolleys or railroad-cars. Women hardly
ever read them, I should judge. Now you are read in the evening by the fireside
or under the lamp, when the day's work is over and the mind is at rest from
other things and receptive to what you offer. Don't you see where you have it
on me?"</p>
<p>This diagnosis was keenly interesting, and while the President talked during
the balance of the evening, Bok was thinking. Finally, he said: "Mr. President,
I should like to share my power with you."</p>
<p>"How?" asked Mr. Roosevelt.</p>
<p>"You recognize that women do not read your messages; and yet no President's
messages ever discussed more ethical questions that women should know about and
get straight in their minds. As it is, some of your ideas are not at all
understood by them; your strenuous-life theory, for instance, your factory-law
ideas, and particularly your race-suicide arguments. Men don't fully understand
them, for that matter; women certainly do not."</p>
<p>"I am aware of all that," said the President. "What is your plan to remedy
it?"</p>
<p>"Have a department in my magazine, and explain your ideas," suggested
Bok.</p>
<p>"Haven't time for another thing. You know that," snapped back the President.
"Wish I had."</p>
<p>"Not to write it, perhaps, yourself," returned Bok.</p>
<p>"But why couldn't you find time to do this: select the writer here in
Washington in whose accuracy you have the most implicit faith; let him talk
with you for one hour each month on one of those subjects; let him write out
your views, and submit the manuscript to you; and we will have a department
stating exactly how the material is obtained and how far it represents your own
work. In that way, with only an hour's work each month, you can get your views,
correctly stated, before this vast audience when it is not in trolleys or
railroadcars."</p>
<p>"But I haven't the hour," answered Roosevelt, impressed, however, as Bok
saw. "I have only half an hour, when I am awake, when I am really idle, and
that is when I am being shaved."</p>
<p>"Well," calmly suggested the editor, "why not two of those half-hours a
month, or perhaps one?"</p>
<p>"What?" answered the President, sitting upright, his teeth flashing but his
smile broadening. "You Dutchman, you'd make me work while I'm getting shaved,
too?"</p>
<p>"Well," was the answer, "isn't the result worth the effort?"</p>
<p>"Bok, you are absolutely relentless," said the President. "But you're right.
The result would be worth the effort. What writer have you in mind? You seem to
have thought this thing through."</p>
<p>"How about O'Brien? You think well of him?"</p>
<p>(Robert L. O'Brien, now editor of the Boston Herald, was then Washington
correspondent for the Boston Transcript and thoroughly in the President's
confidence.)</p>
<p>"Fine," said the President. "I trust O'Brien implicitly. All right, if you
can get O'Brien to add it on, I'll try it."</p>
<p>And so the "shaving interviews" were begun; and early in 1906 there appeared
in The Ladies' Home Journal a department called "The President," with the
subtitle: "A Department in which will be presented the attitude of the
President on those national questions which affect the vital interests of the
home, by a writer intimately acquainted and in close touch with him."</p>
<p>O'Brien talked with Mr. Roosevelt once a month, wrote out the results, the
President went over the proofs carefully, and the department was conducted with
great success for a year.</p>
<p>But Theodore Roosevelt was again to be the editor of a department in The
Ladies' Home Journal; this time to be written by himself under the strictest
possible anonymity, so closely adhered to that, until this revelation, only
five persons have known the authorship.</p>
<p>Feeling that it would be an interesting experiment to see how far Theodore
Roosevelt's ideas could stand unsupported by the authority of his vibrant
personality, Bok suggested the plan to the colonel. It was just after he had
returned from his South American trip. He was immediately interested.</p>
<p>"But how can we keep the authorship really anonymous?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Easily enough," answered Bok, "if you're willing to do the work. Our
letters about it must be written in long hand addressed to each other's homes;
you must write your manuscript in your own hand; I will copy it in mine, and it
will go to the printer in that way. I will personally send you the proofs; you
mark your corrections in pencil, and I will copy them in ink; the company will
pay me for each article, and I will send you my personal check each month. By
this means, the identity of the author will be concealed."</p>
<p>Colonel Roosevelt was never averse to hard work if it was necessary to
achieve a result that he felt was worth while.</p>
<p>"All right," wrote the colonel finally. "I'll try--with you!--the experiment
for a year: 12 articles... I don't know that I can give your readers
satisfaction, but I shall try my very best. I am very glad to be associated
with you, anyway. At first I doubted the wisdom of the plan, merely because I
doubted whether I could give you just that you wished. I never know what an
audience wants: I know what it ought to want: and sometimes I can give it, or
make it accept what I think it needs--and sometimes I cannot. But the more I
thought over your proposal, the more I liked it... Whether the wine will be
good enough to attract without any bush I don't know; and besides, in such
cases the fault is not in the wine, but in the fact that the consumers decline
to have their attention attracted unless there is a bush!"</p>
<p>In the latter part of 1916 an anonymous department called "Men" was begun in
the magazine.</p>
<p>The physical work was great. The colonel punctiliously held to the
conditions, and wrote manuscript and letters with his own hand, and Bok carried
out his part of the agreement. Nor was this simple, for Colonel Roosevelt's
manuscript--particularly when, as in this case, it was written on yellow paper
with a soft pencil and generously interlined--was anything but legible. Month
after month the two men worked each at his own task. To throw the public off
the scent, during the conduct of the department, an article or two by Colonel
Roosevelt was published in another part of the magazine under his own name, and
in the department itself the anonymous author would occasionally quote
himself.</p>
<p>It was natural that the appearance of a department devoted to men in a
woman's magazine should attract immediate attention. The department took up the
various interests of a man's life, such as real efficiency; his duties as an
employer and his usefulness to his employees; the employee's attitude toward
his employer; the relations of men and women; a father's relations to his sons
and daughters; a man's duty to his community; the public-school system; a man's
relation to his church, and kindred topics.</p>
<p>The anonymity of the articles soon took on interest from the positiveness of
the opinions discussed; but so thoroughly had Colonel Roosevelt covered his
tracks that, although he wrote in his usual style, in not a single instance was
his name connected with the department. Lyman Abbott was the favorite "guess"
at first; then after various other public men had been suggested, the
newspapers finally decided upon former President Eliot of Harvard University as
the writer.</p>
<p>All this intensely interested and amused Colonel Roosevelt and he fairly
itched with the desire to write a series of criticisms of his own articles to
Doctor Eliot. Bok, however, persuaded the colonel not to spend more physical
effort than he was already doing on the articles; for, in addition, he was
notating answers on the numerous letters received, and those Bok answered "on
behalf of the author."</p>
<p>For a year, the department continued. During all that time the secret of the
authorship was known to only one man, besides the colonel and Bok, and their
respective wives!</p>
<p>When the colonel sent his last article in the series to Bok, he wrote:</p>
<p>"Now that the work is over, I wish most cordially to thank you, my dear
fellow, for your unvarying courtesy and kindness. I have not been satisfied
with my work. This is the first time I ever tried to write precisely to order,
and I am not one of those gifted men who can do so to advantage. Generally I
find that the 3,000 words is not the right length and that I wish to use 2,000
or 4,000! And in consequence feel as if I had either padded or mutilated the
article. And I am not always able to feel that every month I have something
worth saying on a given subject.</p>
<p>"But I hope that you have not been too much disappointed."</p>
<p>Bok had not been, and neither had his public!</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Bok had arranged with Colonel Roosevelt for his reading
and advising upon manuscripts of special significance for the magazine. In this
work, Colonel Roosevelt showed his customary promptness and thoroughness. A
manuscript, no matter how long it might be, was in his hands scarcely
forty-eight hours, more generally twenty-four, before it was read, a report
thereon written, and the article on its way back. His reports were always
comprehensive and invariably interesting. There was none of the cut-and-dried
flavor of the opinion of the average "reader"; he always put himself into the
report, and, of course, that meant a warm personal touch. If he could not
encourage the publication of a manuscript, his reasons were always fully given,
and invariably without personal bias.</p>
<p>On one occasion Bok sent him a manuscript which he was sure was, in its
views, at variance with the colonel's beliefs. The colonel, he knew, felt
strongly on the subject, and Bok wondered what would be his criticism. The
report came back promptly. He reviewed the article carefully and ended: "Of
course, this is all at variance with my own views. I believe thoroughly and
completely that this writer is all wrong. And yet, from his side of the case, I
am free to say that he makes out the best case I have read anywhere. I think a
magazine should present both sides of all questions; and if you want to present
this side, I should strongly recommend that you do so with this article."</p>

  Sagamore Hill. April 26th 1916
 
  This is a really noteworth story--a
  profoundly touching story--of the Americanizing
  of an immigrant girl, who between babyhood
  and young womanhood leaps over a space
  which in all outward and humanizing essentials
  is far more important than the distance
  painfully traversed by her forefathers during
  the preceding thousand years. When we tend to
  grow disheartened over some of the developments
  of our American civilization, it is well
  worth while seeing what this same
  civilization holds for starved and noble
  souls who have elsewhere been denied what
  here we hold to be, as a matter of course, rights
  free to all--altho we do not, as we should do,
  make these rights accessible to all who are
  willing with resolute earnestness to strive for them.
  I most cordially commend this story.

</pre>
<p>Not long after, Bok decided to induce Colonel Roosevelt to embark upon an
entirely new activity, and negotiations were begun (alas, too late! for it was
in the autumn of 1918), which, owing to their tentative character, were never
made public. Bok told Colonel Roosevelt that he wanted to invest twenty-five
thousand dollars a year in American boyhood--the boyhood that he felt twenty
years hence would be the manhood of America, and that would actually solve the
problems with which we were now grappling.</p>
<p>Although, all too apparently, he was not in his usual vigorous health,
Colonel Roosevelt was alert in a moment.</p>
<p>"Fine!" he said, with his teeth gleaming. "Couldn't invest better anywhere.
How are you going to do it?"</p>
<p>"By asking you to assume the active headship of the National Boy Scouts of
America, and paying you that amount each year as a fixed salary."</p>
<p>The colonel looked steadily ahead for a moment, without a word, and then
with the old Roosevelt smile wreathing his face and his teeth fairly gleaming,
he turned to his "tempter," as he called him, and said:</p>
<p>"Do you know that was very well put? Yes, sir, very well put."</p>
<p>"Yes?" answered Bok. "Glad you think so. But how about your acceptance of
the idea?"</p>
<p>"That's another matter; quite another matter. How about the organization
itself? There are men in it that don't approve of me at all, you know," he
said.</p>
<p>Bok explained that the organization knew nothing of his offer; that it was
entirely unofficial. It was purely a personal thought. He believed the Boy
Scouts of America needed a leader; that the colonel was the one man in the
United States fitted by every natural quality to be that leader; that the
Scouts would rally around him, and that, at his call, instead of four hundred
thousand Scouts, as there were then, the organization would grow into a million
and more. Bok further explained that he believed his connection with the
national organization was sufficient, if Colonel Roosevelt would favorably
consider such a leadership, to warrant him in presenting it to the national
officers; and he was inclined to believe they would welcome the opportunity. He
could not assure the colonel of this! He had no authority for saying they
would; but was Colonel Roosevelt receptive to the idea?</p>
<p>At first, the colonel could not see it. But he went over the ground as
thoroughly as a half-hour talk permitted; and finally the opportunity for doing
a piece of constructive work that might prove second to none that he had ever
done, made its appeal.</p>
<p>"You mean for me to be the active head?" asked the colonel.</p>
<p>"Could you be anything else, colonel?" answered Bok.</p>
<p>"Quite so," said the colonel. "That's about right. Do you know," he
pondered, "I think Edie (Mrs. Roosevelt) might like me to do something like
that. She would figure it would keep me out of mischief in 1920," and the
colonel's smile spread over his face.</p>
<p>"Bok," he at last concluded, "do you know, after all, I think you've said
something! Let's think it over. Let's see how I get along with this trouble of
mine. I am not sure, you know, how far I can go in the future. Not at all sure,
you know--not at all. That last trip of mine to South America was a bit too
much. Shouldn't have done it, you know. I know it now. Well, as I say, let's
both think it over and through; I will, gladly and most carefully. There's much
in what you say; it's a great chance; I'd love doing it. By Jove! it would be
wonderful to rally a million boys for real Americanism, as you say. It looms up
as I think it over. Suppose we let it simmer for a month or two."</p>
<p>And so it was left--for "a month or two." It was to be
forever--unfortunately. Edward Bok has always felt that the most worth-while
idea that ever came to him had, for some reason he never could understand, come
too late. He felt, as he will always feel, that the boys of America had lost a
national leader that might have led them--where would have been the limit?</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_28">XXV. The President and the
Boy</a></h3>
<p>One of the incidents connected with Edward Bok that Theodore Roosevelt never
forgot was when Bok's eldest boy chose the colonel as a Christmas present. And
no incident better portrays the wonderful character of the colonel than did his
remarkable response to the compliment.</p>
<p>A vicious attack of double pneumonia had left the heart of the boy very
weak--and Christmas was close by! So the father said:</p>
<p>"It's a quiet Christmas for you this year, boy. Suppose you do this: think
of the one thing in the world that you would rather have than anything else and
I'll give you that, and that will have to be your Christmas."</p>
<p>"I know now," came the instant reply.</p>
<p>"But the world is a big place, and there are lots of things in it, you
know."</p>
<p>"I know that," said the boy, "but this is something I have wanted for a long
time, and would rather have than anything else in the world." And he looked as
if he meant it.</p>
<p>"Well, out with it, then, if you're so sure."</p>
<p>And to the father's astonished ears came this request:</p>
<p>"Take me to Washington as soon as my heart is all right, introduce me to
President Roosevelt, and let me shake hands with him."</p>
<p>"All right," said the father, after recovering from his surprise. "I'll see
whether I can fix it." And that morning a letter went to the President saying
that he had been chosen as a Christmas present. Naturally, any man would have
felt pleased, no matter how high his station, and for Theodore Roosevelt,
father of boys, the message had a special appeal.</p>
<p>The letter had no sooner reached Washington than back came an answer,
addressed not to the father but to the boy! It read:</p>
<p>"The White House, Washington.</p>
<p>"November 13th, 1907.</p>
<p>"Dear Curtis:</p>
<p>"Your father has just written me, and I want him to bring you on and shake
hands with me as soon as you are well enough to travel. Then I am going to give
you, myself, a copy of the book containing my hunting trips since I have been
President; unless you will wait until the new edition, which contains two more
chapters, is out. If so, I will send it to you, as this new edition probably
won't be ready when you come on here.</p>
<p>"Give my warm regards to your father and mother.</p>
<p>"Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>"Theodore Roosevelt."</p>
<p>Here was joy serene! But the boy's heart had acted queerly for a few days,
and so the father wrote, thanked the President, and said that as soon as the
heart moderated a bit the letter would be given the boy. It was a rare bit of
consideration that now followed. No sooner had the father's letter reached the
White House than an answer came back by first post--this time with a
special-delivery stamp on it. It was Theodore Roosevelt, the father, who wrote
this time; his mind and time filled with affairs of state, and yet full of
tender thoughtfulness for a little boy:</p>
<p>"Dear Mr. Bok:--</p>
<p>"I have your letter of the 16th instant. I hope the little fellow will soon
be all right. Instead of giving him my letter, give him a message from me based
on the letter, if that will be better for him. Tell Mrs. Bok how deeply Mrs.
Roosevelt and I sympathize with her. We know just how she feels.</p>
<p>"Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>"Theodore Roosevelt."</p>
<p>"That's pretty fine consideration," said the father. He got the letter
during a business conference and he read it aloud to the group of business men.
Some there were in that group who keenly differed with the President on
national issues, but they were all fathers, and two of the sturdiest turned and
walked to the window as they said: "Yes, that is fine!"</p>
<p>Then came the boy's pleasure when he was handed the letter; the next few
days were spent inditing an answer to "my friend, the President." At last the
momentous epistle seemed satisfactory, and off to the busy presidential desk
went the boyish note, full of thanks and assurances that he would come just as
soon as he could, and that Mr. Roosevelt must not get impatient!</p>
<p>The "soon as he could" time, however, did not come as quickly as all had
hoped!--a little heart pumped for days full of oxygen and accelerated by
hypodermic injections is slow to mend. But the President's framed letter,
hanging on the spot on the wall first seen in the morning, was a daily
consolation.</p>
<p>Then, in March, although four months after the promise--and it would not
have been strange, in his busy life, for the President to have forgotten or at
least overlooked it--on the very day that the book was published came a special
"large-paper" copy of The Outdoor Pastimes of an American Hunter, and on the
fly-leaf there greeted the boy, in the President's own hand:</p>
<p>"To Master Curtis Bok,</p>
<p>"With the best wishes of his friend,</p>
<p>"Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>"March 11, 1908."</p>
<p>The boy's cup was now full, and so said his letter to the President. And the
President wrote back to the father: "I am really immensely amused and
interested, and shall be mighty glad to see the little fellow."</p>
<p>In the spring, on a beautiful May day, came the great moment. The mother had
to go along, the boy insisted, to see the great event, and so the trio found
themselves shaking the hand of the President's secretary at the White
House.</p>
<p>"Oh, the President is looking for you, all right," he said to the boy, and
then the next moment the three were in a large room. Mr. Roosevelt, with
beaming face, was already striding across the room, and with a "Well, well, and
so this is my friend Curtis!" the two stood looking into each other's faces,
each fairly wreathed in smiles, and each industriously shaking the hand of the
other.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. President, I'm mighty glad to see you!" said the boy.</p>
<p>"I am glad to see you, Curtis," returned Mr. Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Then there came a white rose from the presidential desk for the mother, but
after that father and mother might as well have faded away. Nobody existed save
the President and the boy. The anteroom was full; in the Cabinet-room a
delegation waited to be addressed. But affairs of state were at a complete
standstill as, with boyish zeal, the President became oblivious to all but the
boy before him.</p>
<p>"Now, Curtis, I've got some pictures here of bears that a friend of mine has
just shot. Look at that whopper, fifteen hundred pounds--that's as much as a
horse weighs, you know. Now, my friend shot him"--and it was a toss-up who was
the more keenly interested, the real boy or the man-boy, as picture after
picture came out and bear adventure crowded upon the heels of bear
adventure.</p>
<p>"Gee, he's a corker, all right!" came from the boy at one point, and then,
from the President: "That's right, he is a corker. Now you see his head
here"--and then both were off again.</p>
<p>The private secretary came in at this point and whispered in the President's
ear.</p>
<p>"I know, I know. I'll see him later. Say that I am very busy now." And the
face beamed with smiles.</p>
<p>"Now, Mr. President--" began the father.</p>
<p>"No, sir; no, sir; not at all. Affairs can wait. This is a long-standing
engagement between Curtis and me, and that must come first. Isn't that so,
Curtis?"</p>
<p>Of course the boy agreed.</p>
<p>Suddenly the boy looked around the room and said:</p>
<p>"Where's your gun, Mr. President? Got it here?"</p>
<p>"No," laughingly came from the President, "but I'll tell you"--and then the
two heads were together again.</p>
<p>A moment for breath-taking came, and the boy said:</p>
<p>"Aren't you ever afraid of being shot?"</p>
<p>"You mean while I am hunting?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no. I mean as President."</p>
<p>"No," replied the smiling President. "I'll tell you, Curtis; I'm too busy to
think about that. I have too many things to do to bother about anything of that
sort. When I was in battle I was always too anxious to get to the front to
think about the shots. And here--well, here I'm too busy too. Never think about
it. But I'll tell you, Curtis, there are some men down there," pointing out of
the window in the direction of the capitol, "called the Congress, and if they
would only give me the four battleships I want, I'd be perfectly willing to
have any one take a crack at me." Then, for the first time recognizing the
existence of the parents, the President said: "And I don't know but if they did
pick me off I'd be pretty well ahead of the game."</p>
<p>Just in that moment only did the boy-knowing President get a single inch
above the boy-interest. It was astonishing to see the natural accuracy with
which the man gauged the boy-level.</p>
<p>"Now, how would you like to see a bear, Curtis?" came next. "I know where
there's a beauty, twelve hundred pounds."</p>
<p>"Must be some bear!" interjected the boy.</p>
<p>"That's what it is," put in the President. "Regular cinnamon-brown
type"--and then off went the talk to the big bear at the Washington "Zoo" where
the President was to send the boy.</p>
<p>Then, after a little: "Now, Curtis, see those men over there in that room.
They've travelled from all parts of the country to come here at my invitation,
and I've got to make a little speech to them, and I'll do that while you go off
to see the bear."</p>
<p>And then the hand came forth to say good-by. The boy put his in it, each
looked into the other's face, and on neither was there a place big enough to
put a ten-cent piece that was not wreathed in smiles. "He certainly is all
right," said the boy to the father, looking wistfully after the President.</p>
<p>Almost to the other room had the President gone when he, too, instinctively
looked back to find the boy following him with his eyes. He stopped, wheeled
around, and then the two instinctively sought each other again. The President
came back, the boy went forward. This time each held out both hands, and as
each looked once more into the other's eyes a world of complete understanding
was in both faces, and every looker-on smiled with them.</p>
<p>"Good-by, Curtis," came at last from the President.</p>
<p>"Good-by, Mr. President," came from the boy.</p>
<p>Then, with another pump-handly shake and with a "Gee, but he's great, all
right!" the boy went out to see the cinnamon-bear at the "Zoo," and to live it
all over in the days to come.</p>
<p>Two boy-hearts had met, although one of them belonged to the President of
the United States.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_29">XXVI. The Literary
Back-Stairs</a></h3>
<p>His complete absorption in the magazine work now compelled Bok to close his
newspaper syndicate in New York and end the writing of his weekly newspaper
literary letter. He decided, however, to transfer to the pages of his magazine
his idea of making the American public more conversant with books and authors.
Accordingly, he engaged Robert Bridges (the present editor of Scribner's
Magazine) to write a series of conversational book-talks under his nom de plume
of "Droch." Later, this was supplemented by the engagement of Hamilton W.
Mabie, who for years reviewed the newest books.</p>
<p>In almost every issue of the magazine there appeared also an article
addressed to the literary novice. Bok was eager, of course, to attract the new
authors to the magazine; but, particularly, he had in mind the correction of
the popular notion, then so prevalent (less so to-day, fortunately, but still
existent), that only the manuscripts of famous authors were given favorable
reading in editorial offices; that in these offices there really existed a
clique, and that unless the writer knew the literary back-stairs he had a slim
chance to enter and be heard.</p>
<p>In the minds of these misinformed writers, these back-stairs are gained by
"knowing the editor" or through "having some influence with him." These writers
have conclusively settled two points in their own minds: first, that an editor
is antagonistic to the struggling writer; and, second, that a manuscript sent
in the ordinary manner to an editor never reaches him. Hence, some "influence"
is necessary, and they set about to secure it.</p>
<p>Now, the truth is, of course, that there are no "literary back-stairs" to
the editorial office of the modern magazine. There cannot be. The making of a
modern magazine is a business proposition; the editor is there to make it pay.
He can do this only if he is of service to his readers, and that depends on his
ability to obtain a class of material essentially the best of its kind and
varied in its character.</p>
<p>The "best," while it means good writing, means also that it shall say
something. The most desired writer in the magazine office is the man who has
something to say, and knows how to say it. Variety requires that there shall be
many of these writers, and it is the editor's business to ferret them out. It
stands to reason, therefore, that there can be no such thing as a "clique";
limitation by the editor of his list of authors would mean being limited to the
style of the few and the thoughts of a handful. And with a public that easily
tires even of the best where it continually comes from one source, such an
editorial policy would be suicidal.</p>
<p>Hence, if the editor is more keenly alert for one thing than for another, it
is for the new writer. The frequency of the new note in his magazine is his
salvation; for just in proportion as he can introduce that new note is his
success with his readers. A successful magazine is exactly like a successful
store: it must keep its wares constantly fresh and varied to attract the eye
and hold the patronage of its customers.</p>
<p>With an editor ever alive to the new message, the new note, the fresh way of
saying a thing, the new angle on a current subject, whether in article or
story--since fiction is really to-day only a reflection of modern thought--the
foolish notion that an editor must be approached through "influence," by a
letter of introduction from some friend or other author, falls of itself. There
is no more powerful lever to open the modern magazine door than a postage-stamp
on an envelope containing a manuscript that says something. No influence is
needed to bring that manuscript to the editor's desk or to his attention. That
he will receive it the sender need not for a moment doubt; his mail is too
closely scanned for that very envelope.</p>
<p>The most successful authors have "broken into" the magazines very often
without even a letter accompanying their first manuscript. The name and address
in the right-hand corner of the first page; some "return" stamps in the left
corner, and all that the editor requires is there. The author need tell nothing
about the manuscript; if what the editor wants is in it he will find it. An
editor can stand a tremendous amount of letting alone. If young authors could
be made to realize how simple is the process of "breaking into" the modern
magazine, which apparently gives them such needless heartburn, they would save
themselves infinite pains, time, and worry.</p>
<p>Despite all the rubbish written to the contrary, manuscripts sent to the
magazines of to-day are, in every case, read, and frequently more carefully
read than the author imagines. Editors know that, from the standpoint of good
business alone, it is unwise to return a manuscript unread. Literary talent has
been found in many instances where it was least expected.</p>
<p>This does not mean that every manuscript received by a magazine is read from
first page to last. There is no reason why it should be, any more than that all
of a bad egg should be eaten to prove that it is bad. The title alone sometimes
decides the fate of a manuscript. If the subject discussed is entirely foreign
to the aims of the magazine, it is simply a case of misapplication on the
author's part; and it would be a waste of time for the editor to read something
which he knows from its subject he cannot use.</p>
<p>This, of course, applies more to articles than to other forms of literary
work, although unsuitability in a poem is naturally as quickly detected.
Stories, no matter how unpromising they may appear at the beginning, are
generally read through, since gold in a piece of fiction has often been found
almost at the close. This careful attention to manuscripts in editorial offices
is fixed by rules, and an author's indorsement or a friend's judgment never
affects the custom.</p>
<p>At no time does the fallacy hold in a magazine office that "a big name
counts for everything and an unknown name for nothing." There can be no denial
of the fact that where a name of repute is attached to a meritorious story or
article the combination is ideal. But as between an indifferent story and a
well-known name and a good story with an unknown name the editor may be
depended upon to accept the latter. Editors are very careful nowadays to avoid
the public impatience that invariably follows upon publishing material simply
on account of the name attached to it. Nothing so quickly injures the
reputation of a magazine in the estimation of its readers. If a person, taking
up a magazine, reads a story attracted by a famous name, and the story
disappoints, the editor has a doubly disappointed reader on his hands: a reader
whose high expectations from the name have not been realized and who is
disappointed with the story.</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact among successful magazine editors that their most
striking successes have been made by material to which unknown names were
attached, where the material was fresh, the approach new, the note different.
That is what builds up a magazine; the reader learns to have confidence in what
he finds in the periodical, whether it bears a famous name or not.</p>
<p>Nor must the young author believe that the best work in modern magazine
literature "is dashed off at white heat." What is dashed off reads dashed off,
and one does not come across it in the well-edited magazine, because it is
never accepted. Good writing is laborious writing, the result of revision upon
revision. The work of masters such as Robert Louis Stevenson and Rudyard
Kipling represents never less than eight or ten revisions, and often a far
greater number. It was Stevenson who once said to Edward Bok, after a laborious
correction of certain proofs: "My boy, I could be a healthy man, I think, if I
did something else than writing. But to write, as I try to write, takes every
ounce of my vitality." Just as the best "impromptu" speeches are those most
carefully prepared, so do the simplest articles and stories represent the
hardest kind of work; the simpler the method seems and the easier the article
reads, the harder, it is safe to say, was the work put into it.</p>
<p>But the author must also know when to let his material alone. In his
excessive regard for style even so great a master as Robert Louis Stevenson
robbed his work of much of the spontaneity and natural charm found, for
example, in his Vailima Letters. The main thing is for a writer to say what he
has to say in the best way, natural to himself, in which he can say it, and
then let it alone--always remembering that, provided he has made himself clear,
the message itself is of greater import than the manner in which it is said. Up
to a certain point only is a piece of literary work an artistic endeavor. A
readable, lucid style is far preferable to what is called a "literary style"--a
foolish phrase, since it often means nothing except a complicated method of
expression which confuses rather than clarifies thought. What the public wants
in its literature is human nature, and that human nature simply and forcibly
expressed. This is fundamental, and this is why true literature has no fashion
and knows no change, despite the cries of the modern weaklings who affect weird
forms. The clarity of Shakespeare is the clarity of to-day and will be that of
to-morrow.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_30">XXVII. Women's Clubs and Woman
Suffrage</a></h3>
<p>Edward Bok was now jumping from one sizzling frying-pan into another. He had
become vitally interested in the growth of women's clubs as a power for good,
and began to follow their work and study their methods. He attended meetings;
he had his editors attend others and give him reports; he collected and read
the year-books of scores of clubs, and he secured and read a number of the
papers that had been presented by members at these meetings. He saw at once
that what might prove a wonderful power in the civic life of the nation was
being misdirected into gatherings of pseudo-culture, where papers ill-digested
and mostly copied from books were read and superficially discussed.</p>
<p>Apparently the average club thought nothing of disposing of the works of the
Victorian poets in one afternoon; the Italian Renaissance was "fully treated
and most ably discussed," according to one programme, at a single meeting;
Rembrandt and his school were likewise disposed of in one afternoon, and German
literature was "adequately treated" at one session "in able papers."</p>
<p>Bok gathered a mass of this material, and then paid his respects to it in
the magazine. He recited his evidence and then expressed his opinion of it. He
realized that his arraignment of the clubs would cost the magazine hundreds of
friends; but, convinced of the great power of the woman's club with its
activities rightly directed, he concluded that he could afford to risk
incurring displeasure if he might point the way to more effective work. The one
was worth the other.</p>
<p>The displeasure was not slow in making itself manifest. It came to maturity
overnight, as it were, and expressed itself in no uncertain terms. Every club
flew to arms, and Bok was intensely interested to note that the clubs whose
work he had taken as "horrible examples," although he had not mentioned their
names, were the most strenuous in their denials of the methods outlined in the
magazine, and that the members of those clubs were particularly heated in their
attacks upon him.</p>
<p>He soon found that he had stirred up quite as active a hornet's nest as he
had anticipated. Letters by the hundred poured in attacking and reviling him.
In nearly every case the writers fell back upon personal abuse, ignoring his
arguments altogether. He became the subject of heated debates at club meetings,
at conventions, in the public press; and soon long petitions demanding his
removal as editor began to come to Mr. Curtis. These petitions were signed by
hundreds of names. Bok read them with absorbed interest, and bided his time for
action. Meanwhile he continued his articles of criticism in the magazine, and
these, of course, added fuel to the conflagration.</p>
<p>Former President Cleveland now came to Bok's side, and in an article in the
magazine went even further than Bok had ever thought of going in his criticism
of women's clubs. This article deflected the criticism from Bok momentarily,
and Mr. Cleveland received a grilling to which his experiences in the White
House were "as child's play," as he expressed it. The two men, the editor and
the former President, were now bracketed as copartners in crime in the eyes of
the club-women, and nothing too harsh could be found to say or write of
either.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bok had been watching the petitions for his removal which kept
coming in. He was looking for an opening, and soon found it. One of the most
prominent women's clubs sent a protest condemning his attitude and advising him
by resolutions, which were enclosed, that unless he ceased his attacks, the
members of the -- Woman's Club had resolved "to unitedly and unanimously
boycott The Ladies' Home Journal and had already put the plan into effect with
the current issue."</p>
<p>Bok immediately engaged counsel in the city where the club was situated, and
instructed his lawyer to begin proceedings, for violation of the Sherman Act,
against the president and the secretary of the club, and three other members;
counsel to take particular pains to choose, if possible, the wives of three
lawyers.</p>
<p>Within forty-eight hours Bok heard from the husbands of the five wives, who
pointed out to him that the women had acted in entire ignorance of the law, and
suggested a reconsideration of his action. Bok replied by quoting from the
petition which set forth that it was signed "by the most intelligent women of
-- who were thoroughly versed in civic and national affairs"; and if this were
true, Bok argued, it naturally followed that they must have been cognizant of a
legislative measure so well known and so widely discussed as the Sherman Act.
He was basing his action, he said, merely on their declaration.</p>
<p>Bok could easily picture to himself the chagrin and wrath of the women, with
the husbands laughing up their sleeves at the turn of affairs. "My wife never
could see the humor in the situation," said one of these husbands to Bok, when
he met him years later. Bok capitulated, and then apparently with great
reluctance, only when the club sent him an official withdrawal of the protest
and an apology for "its ill-considered action." It was years after that one of
the members of the club, upon meeting Bok, said to him: "Your action did not
increase the club's love for you, but you taught it a much-needed lesson which
it never forgot."</p>
<p>Up to this time, Bok had purposely been destructive in his criticism. Now,
he pointed out a constructive plan whereby the woman's club could make itself a
power in every community. He advocated less of the cultural and more of the
civic interest, and urged that the clubs study the numerous questions dealing
with the life of their communities. This seems strange, in view of the enormous
amount of civic work done by women's clubs to-day. But at that time, when the
woman's club movement was unformed, these civic matters found but a small part
in the majority of programmes; in a number of cases none at all.</p>
<p>Of course, the clubs refused to accept or even to consider his suggestions;
they were quite competent to decide for themselves the particular subjects for
their meetings, they argued; they did not care to be tutored or guided,
particularly by Bok. They were much too angry with him even to admit that his
suggestions were practical and in order. But he knew, of course, that they
would adopt them of their own volition--under cover, perhaps, but that made no
difference, so long as the end was accomplished. One club after another, during
the following years, changed its programme, and soon the supposed cultural
interest had yielded first place to the needful civic questions.</p>
<p>For years, however, the club-women of America did not forgive Bok. They
refused to buy or countenance his magazine, and periodically they attacked it
or made light of it. But he knew he had made his point, and was content to
leave it to time to heal the wounds. This came years afterward, when Mrs.
Pennypacker became president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs and
Mrs. Rudolph Blankenburg, vice-president.</p>
<p>Those two far-seeing women and Bok arranged that an official department of
the Federation should find a place in The Ladies' Home Journal, with Mrs.
Pennypacker as editor and Mrs. Blankenburg, who lived in Philadelphia, as the
resident consulting editor. The idea was arranged agreeably to all three; the
Federation officially endorsed its president's suggestion, and for several
years the department was one of the most successful in the magazine.</p>
<p>The breach had been healed; two powerful forces were working together, as
they should, for the mutual good of the American woman. No relations could have
been pleasanter than those between the editor-in-chief of the magazine and the
two departmental editors. The report was purposely set afloat that Bok had
withdrawn from his position of antagonism (?) toward women's clubs, and this
gave great satisfaction to thousands of women club-members and made everybody
happy!</p>
<p>At this time the question of suffrage for women was fast becoming a
prominent issue, and naturally Bok was asked to take a stand on the question in
his magazine. No man sat at a larger gateway to learn the sentiments of numbers
of women on any subject. He read his vast correspondence carefully. He
consulted women of every grade of intelligence and in every station in life.
Then he caused a straw-vote to be taken among a selected list of thousands of
his subscribers in large cities and in small towns. The result of all these
inquiries was most emphatic and clear: by far the overwhelming majority of the
women approached either were opposed to the ballot or were indifferent to it.
Those who desired to try the experiment were negligible in number. So far as
the sentiment of any wide public can be secured on any given topic, this seemed
to be the dominant opinion.</p>
<p>Bok then instituted a systematic investigation of conditions in those states
where women had voted for years; but he could not see, from a thoughtful study
of his investigations, that much had been accomplished. The results certainly
did not measure up to the prophecies constantly advanced by the advocates of a
nation-wide equal suffrage.</p>
<p>The editor now carefully looked into the speeches of the suffragists,
examined the platform of the National body in favor of woman suffrage, and
talked at length with such leaders in the movement as Susan B. Anthony, Julia
Ward Howe, Anna Howard Shaw, and Jane Addams.</p>
<p>All this time Bok had kept his own mind open. He was ready to have the
magazine, for whose editorial policy he was responsible, advocate that side of
the issue which seemed for the best interests of the American woman.</p>
<p>The arguments that a woman should not have a vote because she was a woman;
that it would interfere with her work in the home; that it would make her more
masculine; that it would take her out of her own home; that it was a blow at
domesticity and an actual menace to the home life of America--these did not
weight with him. There was only one question for him to settle: Was the ballot
something which, in its demonstrated value or in its potentiality, would serve
the best interests of American womanhood?</p>
<p>After all his investigations of both sides of the question, Bok decided upon
a negative answer. He felt that American women were not ready to exercise the
privilege intelligently and that their mental attitude was against it.</p>
<p>Forthwith he said so in his magazine. And the storm broke. The denunciations
brought down upon him by his attitude toward woman's clubs was as nothing
compared to what was now let loose. The attacks were bitter. His arguments were
ignored; and the suffragists evidently decided to concentrate their criticisms
upon the youthful years of the editor. They regarded this as a most vulnerable
point of attack, and reams of paper were used to prove that the opinion of a
man so young in years and so necessarily unformed in his judgment was of no
value.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the suffragists did not know, when they advanced this
argument, that it would be overthrown by the endorsement of Bok's point of view
by such men and women of years and ripe judgment as Doctor Eliot, then
president of Harvard University, former President Cleveland, Lyman Abbott,
Margaret Deland, and others. When articles by these opponents to suffrage
appeared, the argument of youth hardly held good; and the attacks of the
suffragists were quickly shifted to the ground of "narrow-mindedness and
old-fashioned fogyism."</p>
<p>The article by former President Cleveland particularly stirred the ire of
the attacking suffragists, and Miss Anthony hurled a broadside at the former
President in a newspaper interview. Unfortunately for her best judgment, and
the strength of her argument, the attack became intensely personal; and of
course, nullified its force. But it irritated Mr. Cleveland, who called Bok to
his Princeton home and read him a draft of a proposed answer for publication in
Bok's magazine.</p>
<p>Those who knew Mr. Cleveland were well aware of the force that he could put
into his pen when he chose, and in this proposed article he certainly chose! It
would have made very unpleasant reading for Miss Anthony in particular, as well
as for her friends. Bok argued strongly against the article. He reminded Mr.
Cleveland that it would be undignified to make such an answer; that it was
always an unpopular thing to attack a woman in public, especially a woman who
was old and ill; that she would again strive for the last word; that there
would be no point to the controversy and nothing gained by it. He pleaded with
Mr. Cleveland to meet Miss Anthony's attack by a dignified silence.</p>
<p>These arguments happily prevailed. In reality, Mr. Cleveland was not keen to
attack Miss Anthony or any other woman; such a thought was foreign to his
nature. He summed up his feeling to Bok when he tore up the draft of his
article and smilingly said: "Well, I've got if off my chest, that is the main
thing. I wanted to get it out of my system, and talking it over has driven it
out. It is better in the fire," and he threw the torn paper into the open
grate.</p>
<p>As events turned out, it was indeed fortunate that the matter had been so
decided; for the article would have appeared in the number of Bok's magazine
published on the day that Miss Anthony passed away. It would have been a most
unfortunate moment, to say the least, for the appearance of an attack such as
Mr. Cleveland had in mind.</p>
<p>This incident, like so many instances that might be adduced, points with
singular force to the value of that editorial discrimination which the editor
often makes between what is wise or unwise for him to publish. Bok realized
that had he encouraged Mr. Cleveland to publish the article, he could have
exhausted any edition he might have chosen to print. Times without number,
editors make such decisions directly against what would be of temporary
advantage to their publications. The public never hears of these incidents.</p>
<p>More often than not the editor hears "stories" that, if printed, would be a
"scoop" which would cause his publication to be talked about from one end of
the country to the other. The public does not give credit to the editor,
particularly of the modern newspaper, for the high code of honor which
constantly actuates him in his work. The prevailing notion is that an editor
prints all that he knows, and much that he does not know. Outside of those in
the inner government circles, no group of men, during the Great War, had more
information of a confidential nature constantly given or brought to them, and
more zealously guarded it, than the editors of the newspapers of America. Among
no other set of professional men is the code of honor so high; and woe betide
the journalist who, in the eyes of his fellow-workers, violates, even in the
slightest degree, that code of editorial ethics. Public men know how true is
this statement; the public at large, however, has not the first conception of
it. If it had, it would have a much higher opinion of its periodicals and
newspapers.</p>
<p>At this juncture, Rudyard Kipling unconsciously came into the very centre of
the suffragists' maelstrom of attack when he sent Bok his famous poem: "The
Female of the Species." The suffragists at once took the argument in the poem
as personal to themselves, and now Kipling got the full benefit of their
vitriolic abuse. Bok sent a handful of these criticisms to Kipling, who was
very gleeful about them. "I owe you a good laugh over the clippings," he wrote.
"They were delightful. But what a quantity of spare time some people in this
world have to burn!"</p>
<p>It was a merry time; and the longer it continued the more heated were the
attacks. The suffragists now had a number of targets, and they took each in
turn and proceeded to riddle it. That Bok was publishing articles explaining
both sides of the question, presenting arguments by the leading suffragists as
well as known anti-suffragists, did not matter in the least. These were either
conveniently overlooked, or, when referred to at all, were considered in the
light of "sops" to the offended women.</p>
<p>At last Bok reached the stage where he had exhausted all the arguments worth
printing, on both sides of the question, and soon the storm calmed down.</p>
<p>It was always a matter of gratification to him that the woman who had most
bitterly assailed him during the suffrage controversy, Anna Howard Shaw, became
in later years one of his stanchest friends, and was an editor on his pay-roll.
When the United States entered the Great War, Bok saw that Doctor Shaw had
undertaken a gigantic task in promising, as chairman, to direct the activities
of the National Council for Women. He went to see her in Washington, and
offered his help and that of the magazine. Doctor Shaw, kindliest of women in
her nature, at once accepted the offer; Bok placed the entire resources of the
magazine and of its Washington editorial force at her disposal; and all through
America's participation in the war, she successfully conducted a monthly
department in The Ladies' Home Journal.</p>
<p>"Such help," she wrote at the close, "as you and your associates have
extended me and my co-workers; such unstinted co-operation and such practical
guidance I never should have dreamed possible. You made your magazine a living
force in our work; we do not see now how we would have done without it. You
came into our activities at the psychological moment, when we most needed what
you could give us, and none could have given with more open hands and fuller
hearts."</p>
<p>So the contending forces in a bitter word-war came together and worked
together, and a mutual regard sprang up between the woman and the man who had
once so radically differed.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_31">XXVIII. Going Home with
Kipling, and as a Lecturer</a></h3>
<p>It was in June, 1899, when Rudyard Kipling, after the loss of his daughter
and his own almost fatal illness from pneumonia in America, sailed for his
English home on the White Star liner, Teutonic. The party consisted of Kipling,
his wife, his father J. Lockwood Kipling, Mr. and Mrs. Frank N. Doubleday, and
Bok. It was only at the last moment that Bok decided to join the party, and the
steamer having its full complement of passengers, he could only secure one of
the officers' large rooms on the upper deck. Owing to the sensitive condition
of Kipling's lungs, it was not wise for him to be out on deck except in the
most favorable weather. The atmosphere of the smoking-room was forbidding, and
as the rooms of the rest of the party were below deck, it was decided to make
Bok's convenient room the headquarters of the party. Here they assembled for
the best part of each day; the talk ranged over literary and publishing matters
of mutual interest, and Kipling promptly labelled the room "The
Hatchery,"--from the plans and schemes that were hatched during these
discussions.</p>
<p>It was decided on the first day out that the party, too active-minded to
remain inert for any length of time, should publish a daily newspaper to be
written on large sheets of paper and to be read each evening to the group. It
was called The Teuton Tonic; Mr. Doubleday was appointed publisher and
advertising manager; Mr. Lockwood Kipling was made art editor to embellish the
news; Rudyard Kipling was the star reporter, and Bok was editor.</p>
<p>Kipling, just released from his long confinement, like a boy out of school,
was the life of the party--and when, one day, he found a woman aboard reading a
copy of The Ladies' Home Journal his joy knew no bounds; he turned in the most
inimitable "copy" to the Tonic, describing the woman's feelings as she read the
different departments in the magazine. Of course, Bok, as editor of the Tonic,
promptly pigeon-holed the reporter's "copy"; then relented, and, in a fine
spirit of large-mindedness, "printed" Kipling's peans of rapture over Bok's
subscriber. The preparation of the paper was a daily joy: it kept the different
members busy, and each evening the copy was handed to "the large circle of
readers"--the two women of the party--to read aloud. At the end of the sixth
day, it was voted to "suspend publication," and the daily of six issues was
unanimously bequeathed to the little daughter of Mr. Lockwood de Forest, a
close friend of the Kipling family--a choice bit of Kiplingania.</p>
<p>One day it was decided by the party that Bok should be taught the game of
poker, and Kipling at once offered to be the instructor! He wrote out a list of
the "hands" for Bok's guidance, which was placed in the centre of the table,
and the party, augmented by the women, gathered to see the game.</p>
<p>A baby had been born that evening in the steerage, and it was decided to
inaugurate a small "jack-pot" for the benefit of the mother. All went well
until about the fourth hand, when Bok began to bid higher than had been
originally planned. Kipling questioned the beginner's knowledge of the game and
his tactics, but Bok retorted it was his money that he was putting into the pot
and that no one was compelled to follow his bets if he did not choose to do so.
Finally, the jack-pot assumed altogether too large dimensions for the party,
Kipling "called" and Bok, true to the old idea of "beginner's luck" in cards,
laid down a royal flush! This was too much, and poker, with Bok in it, was
taboo from that moment. Kipling's version of this card-playing does not agree
in all particulars with the version here written. "Bok learned the game of
poker," Kipling says; "had the deck stacked on him, and on hearing that there
was a woman aboard who read The Ladies' Home Journal insisted on playing after
that with the cabin-door carefully shut." But Kipling's art as a reporter for
The Tonic was not as reliable as the art of his more careful book work.</p>
<p>Bok derived special pleasure on this trip from his acquaintance with Father
Kipling, as the party called him. Rudyard Kipling's respect for his father was
the tribute of a loyal son to a wonderful father.</p>
<p>"What annoys me," said Kipling, speaking of his father one day, "is when the
pater comes to America to have him referred to in the newspapers as 'the father
of Rudyard Kipling.' It is in India where they get the relation correct: there
I am always 'the son of Lockwood Kipling.'"</p>
<p>Father Kipling was, in every sense, a choice spirit: gentle, kindly, and of
a most remarkably even temperament. His knowledge of art, his wide reading, his
extensive travel, and an interest in every phase of the world's doings, made
him a rare conversationalist, when inclined to talk, and an encyclopedia of
knowledge as extensive as it was accurate. It was very easy to grow fond of
Father Kipling, and he won Bok's affection as few men ever did.</p>
<p>Father Kipling's conversation was remarkable in that he was exceedingly
careful of language and wasted few words.</p>
<p>One day Kipling and Bok were engaged in a discussion of the Boer problem,
which was then pressing. Father Kipling sat by listening, but made no comment
on the divergent views, since, Kipling holding the English side of the question
and Bok the Dutch side, it followed that they could not agree. Finally Father
Kipling arose and said: "Well, I will take a stroll and see if I can't listen
to the water and get all this din out of my ears."</p>
<p>Both men felt gently but firmly rebuked and the discussion was never again
taken up.</p>
<p>Bok tried on one occasion to ascertain how the father regarded the son's
work.</p>
<p>"You should feel pretty proud of your son," remarked Bok.</p>
<p>"A good sort," was the simple reply.</p>
<p>"I mean, rather, of his work. How does that strike you?" asked Bok.</p>
<p>"Which work?"</p>
<p>"His work as a whole," explained Bok.</p>
<p>"Creditable," was the succinct answer.</p>
<p>"No more than that?" asked Bok.</p>
<p>"Can there be more?" came from the father.</p>
<p>"Well," said Bok, "the judgment seems a little tame as applied to one who is
generally regarded as a genius."</p>
<p>"By whom?"</p>
<p>"The critics, for instance," replied Bok.</p>
<p>"There are no such," came the answer.</p>
<p>"No such what, Mr. Kipling?" asked Bok.</p>
<p>"Critics."</p>
<p>"No critics?"</p>
<p>"No," and for the first time the pipe was removed for a moment. "A critic is
one who only exists as such in his own imagination."</p>
<p>"But surely you must consider that Rud has done some great work?" persisted
Bok.</p>
<p>"Creditable," came once more.</p>
<p>"You think him capable of great work, do you not?" asked Bok. For a moment
there was silence. Then:</p>
<p>"He has a certain grasp of the human instinct. That, some day, I think, will
lead him to write a great work."</p>
<p>There was the secret: the constant holding up to the son, apparently, of
something still to be accomplished; of a goal to be reached; of a higher
standard to be attained. Rudyard Kipling was never in danger of unintelligent
laudation from his safest and most intelligent reader.</p>
<p>During the years which intervened until his passing away, Bok sought to keep
in touch with Father Kipling, and received the most wonderful letters from him.
One day he enclosed in a letter a drawing which he had made showing Sakia Muni
sitting under the bo-tree with two of his disciples, a young man and a young
woman, gathered at his feet. It was a piece of exquisite drawing. "I like to
think of you and your work in this way," wrote Mr. Kipling, "and so I sketched
it for you." Bok had the sketch enlarged, engaged John La Farge to translate it
into glass, and inserted it in a window in the living-room of his home at
Merion.</p>
<p>After Father Kipling had passed away, the express brought to Bok one day a
beautiful plaque of red clay, showing the elephant's head, the lotus, and the
swastika, which the father had made for the son. It was the original model of
the insignia which, as a watermark, is used in the pages of Kipling's books and
on the cover of the subscription edition.</p>
<p>"I am sending with this for your acceptance," wrote Kipling to Bok, "as some
little memory of my father to whom you were so kind, the original of one of the
plaques that he used to make for me. I thought it being the swastika would be
appropriate for your swastika. May it bring you even more good fortune."</p>
<p>To those who knew Lockwood Kipling, it is easier to understand the genius
and the kindliness of the son. For the sake of the public's knowledge, it is a
distinct loss that there is not a better understanding of the real sweetness of
character of the son. The public's only idea of the great writer is naturally
one derived from writers who do not understand him, or from reporters whom he
refused to see, while Kipling's own slogan is expressed in his own words: "I
have always managed to keep clear of 'personal' things as much as
possible."</p>

  Copied out from memory by Rudyard Kipling.
  Batemons: Sept. 1913
  for E.W. Bok on his 50th Birthday
</pre>
<p>It was on Bok's fiftieth birthday that Kipling sent him a copy of "If." Bok
had greatly admired this poem, but knowing Kipling's distaste for writing out
his own work, he had resisted the strong desire to ask him for a copy of it. It
is significant of the author's remarkable memory that he wrote it, as he said,
"from memory," years after its publication, and yet a comparison of the copy
with the printed form, corrected by Kipling, fails to discover the difference
of a single word.</p>
<p>The lecture bureaus now desired that Edward Bok should go on the platform.
Bok had never appeared in the role of a lecturer, but he reasoned that through
the medium of the rostrum he might come in closer contact with the American
public, meet his readers personally, and secure some first-hand constructive
criticism of his work. This last he was always encouraging. It was a naive
conception of a lecture tour, but Bok believed it and he contracted for a tour
beginning at Richmond, Virginia, and continuing through the South and Southwest
as far as Saint Joseph, Missouri, and then back home by way of the Middle
West.</p>
<p>Large audiences greeted him wherever he went, but he had not gone far on his
tour when he realized that he was not getting what he thought he would. There
was much entertaining and lionizing, but nothing to help him in his work by
pointing out to him where he could better it. He shrank from the pitiless
publicity that was inevitable; he became more and more self-conscious when
during the first five minutes on the stage he felt the hundreds of
opera-glasses levelled at him, and he and Mrs. Bok, who accompanied him, had
not a moment to themselves from early morning to midnight. Yet his large
correspondence was following him from the office, and the inevitable
invitations in each city had at least to be acknowledged. Bok realized he had
miscalculated the benefits of a lecture tour to his work, and began hopefully
to wish for the ending of the circuit.</p>
<p>One afternoon as he was returning with his manager from a large reception,
the "impresario" said to him: "I don't like these receptions. They hurt the
house."</p>
<p>"The house?" echoed Bok.</p>
<p>"Yes, the attendance."</p>
<p>"But you told me the house for this evening was sold out?" said the
lecturer.</p>
<p>"That is true enough. House, and even the stage. Not a seat unsold. But
hundreds just come to see you and not to hear your lecture, and this exposure
of a lecturer at so crowded a reception as this, before the talk, satisfies the
people without their buying a ticket. My rule is that a lecturer should not be
seen in public before his lecture, and I wish you would let me enforce the rule
with you. It wears you out, anyway, and no receptions until afterward will give
you more time for yourself and save your vitality for the talk."</p>
<p>Bok was entirely acquiescent. He had no personal taste for the continued
round of functions, but he had accepted it as part of the game.</p>
<p>The idea from this talk that impressed Bok, however, with particular force,
was that the people who crowded his houses came to see him and not to hear his
lecture. Personal curiosity, in other words. This was a new thought. He had
been too busy to think of his personality; now he realized a different angle to
the situation. And, much to his manager's astonishment, two days afterwards Bok
refused to sign an agreement for another tour later in the year. He had had
enough of exhibiting himself as a curiosity. He continued his tour; but before
its conclusion fell ill--a misfortune with a pleasant side to it, for three of
his engagements had to be cancelled.</p>
<p>The Saint Joseph engagement could not be cancelled. The house had been
oversold; it was for the benefit of a local charity which besought Bok by wire
after wire to keep a postponed date. He agreed, and he went. He realized that
he was not well, but he did not realize the extent of his mental and physical
exhaustion until he came out on the platform and faced the crowded auditorium.
Barely sufficient space had been left for him and for the speaker's desk; the
people on the stage were close to him, and he felt distinctly
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Then, to his consternation, it suddenly dawned upon him that his tired mind
had played a serious trick on him. He did not remember a line of his lecture;
he could not even recall how it began! He arose, after his introduction, in a
bath of cold perspiration. The applause gave him a moment to recover himself,
but not a word came to his mind. He sparred for time by some informal prefatory
remarks expressing regret at his illness and that he had been compelled to
disappoint his audience a few days before, and then he stood helpless! In sheer
desperation he looked at Mrs. Bok sitting in the stage box, who, divining her
husband's plight, motioned to the inside pocket of his coat. He put his hand
there and pulled out a copy of his lecture which she had placed there! The
whole tragic comedy had happened so quickly that the audience was absolutely
unaware of what had occurred, and Bok went on and practically read his lecture.
But it was not a successful evening for his audience or for himself, and the
one was doubtless as glad when it was over as the other.</p>
<p>When he reached home, he was convinced that he had had enough of lecturing!
He had to make a second short tour, however, for which he had contracted with
another manager before embarking on the first. This tour took him to
Indianapolis, and after the lecture, James Whitcomb Riley gave him a supper.
There were some thirty men in the party; the affair was an exceedingly happy
one; the happiest that Bok had attended. He said this to Riley on the way to
the hotel.</p>
<p>"Usually," said Bok, "men, for some reason or other, hold aloof from me on
these lecture tours. They stand at a distance and eye me, and I see wonder on
their faces rather than a desire to mix."</p>
<p>"You've noticed that, then?" smilingly asked the poet.</p>
<p>"Yes, and I can't quite get it. At home, my friends are men. Why should it
be different in other cities?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you," said Riley. "Five or six of the men you met to-night were
loath to come. When I pinned them down to their reason, it was I thought: they
regard you as an effeminate being, a sissy."</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" interrupted Bok.</p>
<p>"Fact," said Riley, "and you can't wonder at it nor blame them. You have
been most industriously paragraphed, in countless jests, about your penchant
for pink teas, your expert knowledge of tatting, crocheting, and all that sort
of stuff. Look what Eugene Field has done in that direction. These paragraphs
have, doubtless, been good advertising for your magazine, and, in a way, for
you. But, on the other hand, they have given a false impression of you. Men
have taken these paragraphs seriously and they think of you as the man pictured
in them. It's a fact; I know. It's all right after they meet you and get your
measure. The joke then is on them. Four of the men I fairly dragged to the
dinner this evening said this to me just before I left. That is one reason why
I advise you to keep on lecturing. Get around and show yourself, and correct
this universal impression. Not that you can't stand when men think of you, but
it's unpleasant."</p>
<p>It was unpleasant, but Bok decided that the solution as found in lecturing
was worse than the misconception. From that day to this he never lectured
again.</p>
<p>But the public conception of himself, especially that of men, awakened his
interest and amusement. Some of his friends on the press were still busy with
their paragraphs, and he promptly called a halt and asked them to desist.
"Enough was as good as a feast," he told them, and explained why.</p>
<p>One day Bok got a distinctly amusing line on himself from a chance stranger.
He was riding from Washington to Philadelphia in the smoking compartment, when
the newsboy stuck his head in the door and yelled: "Ladies' Home Journal, out
to-day." He had heard this many times before; but on this particular day, upon
hearing the title of his own magazine yelled almost in his ears, he gave an
involuntary start.</p>
<p>Opposite to him sat a most companionable young fellow, who, noticing Bok's
start, leaned over and with a smile said: "I know, I know just how you feel.
That's the way I feel whenever I hear the name of that damned magazine. Here,
boy," he called to the retreating magazine-carrier, "give me a copy of that
Ladies' Home Disturber: I might as well buy it here as in the station."</p>
<p>Then to Bok: "Honest, if I don't bring home that sheet on the day it is out,
the wife is in a funk. She runs her home by it literally. Same with you?"</p>
<p>"The same," answered Bok. "As a matter of fact, in our family, we live by
it, on it, and from it."</p>
<p>Bok's neighbor, of course, couldn't get the real point of this, but he
thought he had it.</p>
<p>"Exactly," he replied. "So do we. That fellow Bok certainly has the women
buffaloed for good. Ever see him?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," answered Bok.</p>
<p>"Live in Philadelphia?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"There's where the thing is published, all right. What does Bok look
like?"</p>
<p>"Oh," answered Bok carelessly, "just like, well, like all of us. In fact, he
looks something like me."</p>
<p>"Does he, now?" echoed the man. "Shouldn't think it would make you very
proud!"</p>
<p>And, the train pulling in at Baltimore, Bok's genial neighbor sent him a
hearty good-bye and ran out with the much-maligned magazine under his arm!</p>
<p>He had an occasion or two now to find out what women thought of him!</p>
<p>He was leaving the publication building one evening after office hours when
just as he opened the front door, a woman approached. Bok explained that the
building was closed.</p>
<p>"Well, I am sorry," said the woman in a dejected tone, "for I don't think I
can manage to come again."</p>
<p>"Is there anything I can do?" asked Bok. "I am employed here."</p>
<p>"No-o," said the woman. "I came to see Mr. Curtis on a personal matter."</p>
<p>"I shall see him this evening," suggested Bok, "and can give him a message
for you if you like."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know if you can. I came to complain to him about Mr. Bok,"
announced the woman.</p>
<p>"Oh, well," answered Bok, with a slight start at the matter-of-fact
announcement, "that is serious; quite serious. If you will explain your
complaint, I will surely see that it gets to Mr. Curtis."</p>
<p>Bok's interest grew.</p>
<p>"Well, you see," said the woman, "it is this way. I live in a three-family
flat. Here is my name and card," and a card came out of a bag. "I subscribe to
The Ladies' Home Journal. It is delivered at my house each month by Mr. Bok.
Now I have told that man three times over that when he delivers the magazine,
he must ring the bell twice. But he just persists in ringing once and then that
cat who lives on the first floor gets my magazine, reads it, and keeps it
sometimes for three days before I get it! Now, I want Mr. Curtis to tell Mr.
Bok that he must do as I ask and ring the bell twice. Can you give him that
message for me? There's no use talking to Mr. Bok; I've done that, as I
say."</p>
<p>And Bok solemnly assured his subscriber that he would!</p>
<p>Bok's secretary told him one day that there was in the outer office the most
irate woman he had ever tried to handle; that he had tried for half an hour to
appease her, but it was of no use. She threatened to remain until Bok admitted
her, and see him she would, and tell him exactly what she thought of him. The
secretary looked as if he had been through a struggle. "It's hopeless," he
said. "Will you see her?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Bok. "Show her in."</p>
<p>The moment the woman came in, she began a perfect torrent of abuse. Bok
could not piece out, try as he might, what it was all about. But he did gather
from the explosion that the woman considered him a hypocrite who wrote one
thing and did another; that he was really a thief, stealing a woman's money,
and so forth. There was no chance of a word for fully fifteen minutes and then,
when she was almost breathless, Bok managed to ask if his caller would kindly
tell him just what he had done.</p>
<p>Another torrent of incoherent abuse came forth, but after a while it became
apparent that the woman's complaint was that she had sent a dollar for a
subscription to The Ladies' Home Journal; had never had a copy of the magazine,
had complained, and been told there was no record of the money being received.
And as she had sent her subscription to Bok personally, he had purloined the
dollar!</p>
<p>It was fully half an hour before Bok could explain to the irate woman that
he never remembered receiving a letter from her; that subscriptions, even when
personally addressed to him, did not come to his desk, etc.; that if she would
leave her name and address he would have the matter investigated. Absolutely
unconvinced that anything would be done, and unaltered in her opinion about
Bok, the woman finally left.</p>
<p>Two days later a card was handed in to the editor with a note asking him to
see for a moment the husband of his irate caller. When the man came in, he
looked sheepish and amused in turn, and finally said:</p>
<p>"I hardly know what to say, because I don't know what my wife said to you.
But if what she said to me is any index of her talk with you, I want to
apologize for her most profoundly. She isn't well, and we shall both have to
let it go at that. As for her subscription, you, of course, never received it,
for, with difficulty, I finally extracted the fact from her that she pinned a
dollar bill to a postal card and dropped it in a street postal box. And she
doesn't yet see that she has done anything extraordinary, or that she had a
faith in Uncle Sam that I call sublime."</p>
<p>The Journal had been calling the attention of its readers to the defacement
of the landscape by billboard advertisers. One day on his way to New York he
found himself sitting in a sleeping-car section opposite a woman and her
daughter.</p>
<p>The mother was looking at the landscape when suddenly she commented:</p>
<p>"There are some of those ugly advertising signs that Mr. Bok says are such a
defacement to the landscape. I never noticed them before, but he is right, and
I am going to write and tell him so."</p>
<p>"Oh, mamma, don't," said the girl. "That man is pampered enough by women.
Don't make him worse. Ethel says he is now the vainest man in America."</p>
<p>Bok's eyes must have twinkled, and just then the mother looked at him,
caught his eye; she gave a little gasp, and Bok saw that she had telepathically
discovered him!</p>
<p>He smiled, raised his hat, presented his card to the mother, and said:
"Excuse me, but I do want to defend myself from that last statement, if I may.
I couldn't help overhearing it."</p>
<p>The mother, a woman of the world, read the name on the card quickly and
smiled, but the daughter's face was a study as she leaned over and glanced at
the card. She turned scarlet and then white.</p>
<p>"Now, do tell me," asked Bok of the daughter, "who 'Ethel' is, so that I may
try at least to prove that I am not what she thinks."</p>
<p>The daughter was completely flustered. For the rest of the journey, however,
the talk was informal; the girl became more at ease, and Bok ended by dining
with the mother and daughter at their hotel that evening.</p>
<p>But he never found out "Ethel's" other name!</p>
<p>There were curiously amusing sides to a man's editorship of a woman's
magazine!</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_32">XXIX. An Excursion into the
Feminine Nature</a></h3>
<p>The strangling hold which the Paris couturiers had secured on the American
woman in their absolute dictation as to her fashions in dress, had interested
Edward Bok for some time. As he studied the question, he was constantly amazed
at the audacity with which these French dressmakers and milliners, often
themselves of little taste and scant morals, cracked the whip, and the docility
with which the American woman blindly and unintelligently danced to their
measure. The deeper he went into the matter, too, the more deceit and
misrepresentation did he find in the situation. It was inconceivable that the
American woman should submit to what was being imposed upon her if she knew the
facts. He determined that she should. The process of Americanization going on
within him decided him to expose the Paris conditions and advocate and present
American-designed fashions for women.</p>
<p>The Journal engaged the best-informed woman in Paris frankly to lay open the
situation to the American women; she proved that the designs sent over by the
so-called Paris arbiters of fashion were never worn by the Frenchwoman of birth
and good taste; that they were especially designed and specifically intended
for "the bizarre American trade," as one polite Frenchman called it; and that
the only women in Paris who wore these grotesque and often immoderate styles
were of the demimonde.</p>
<p>This article was the opening gun of the campaign, and this was quickly
followed by a second equally convincing--both articles being written from the
inside of the gilded circles of the couturiers' shops. Madame Sarah Bernhardt
was visiting the United States at the time, and Bok induced the great actress
to verify the statements printed. She went farther and expressed amazement at
the readiness with which the American woman had been duped; and indicated her
horror on seeing American women of refined sensibilities and position dressed
in the gowns of the declasse street-women of Paris. The somewhat sensational
nature of the articles attracted the attention of the American newspapers,
which copied and commented on them; the gist of them was cabled over to Paris,
and, of course, the Paris couturiers denied the charges. But their denials were
in general terms; and no convincing proof of the falsity of the charges was
furnished. The French couturier simply resorted to a shrug of the shoulder and
a laugh, implying that the accusations were beneath his notice.</p>
<p>Bok now followed the French models of dresses and millinery to the United
States, and soon found that for every genuine Parisian model sold in the large
cities at least ten were copies, made in New York shops, but with the labels of
the French dressmakers and milliners sewed on them. He followed the labels to
their source, and discovered a firm one of whose specialties was the making of
these labels bearing the names of the leading French designers. They were
manufactured by the gross, and sold in bundles to the retailers. Bok secured a
list of the buyers of these labels and found that they represented some of the
leading merchants throughout the country. All these facts he published. The
retailers now sprang up in arms and denied the charges, but again the denials
were in general terms. Bok had the facts and they knew it. These facts were too
specific and too convincing to be controverted.</p>
<p>The editor had now presented a complete case before the women of America as
to the character of the Paris-designed fashions and the manner in which women
were being hoodwinked in buying imitations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he had engaged the most expert designers in the world of women's
dress and commissioned them to create American designs. He sent one of his
editors to the West to get first-hand motifs from Indian costumes and adapt
them as decorative themes for dress embroideries. Three designers searched the
Metropolitan Museum for new and artistic ideas, and he induced his company to
install a battery of four-color presses in order that the designs might be
given in all the beauty of their original colors. For months designers and
artists worked; he had the designs passed upon by a board of judges composed of
New York women who knew good clothes, and then he began their publication.</p>
<p>The editor of The New York Times asked Bok to conduct for that newspaper a
prize contest for the best American-designed dresses and hats, and edit a
special supplement presenting them in full colors, the prizes to be awarded by
a jury of six of the leading New York women best versed in matters of dress.
Hundreds of designs were submitted, the best were selected, and the supplement
issued under the most successful auspices.</p>
<p>In his own magazine, Bok published pages of American-designed fashions:
their presence in the magazine was advertised far and wide; conventions of
dressmakers were called to consider the salability of domestic-designed
fashions; and a campaign with the slogan "American Fashions for American Women"
was soon in full swing.</p>
<p>But there it ended. The women looked the designs over with interest, as they
did all designs of new clothes, and paid no further attention to them. The very
fact that they were of American design prejudiced the women against them.
America never had designed good clothes, they argued: she never would. Argument
availed naught. The Paris germ was deep-rooted in the feminine mind of America:
the women acknowledged that they were, perhaps, being hoodwinked by spurious
French dresses and hats; that the case presented by Bok seemed convincing
enough, but the temptation to throw a coat over a sofa or a chair to expose a
Parisian label to the eyes of some other woman was too great; there was always
a gambling chance that her particular gown, coat, or hat was an actual Paris
creation.</p>
<p>Bok called upon the American woman to come out from under the yoke of the
French couturiers, show her patriotism, and encourage American design. But it
was of no use. He talked with women on every hand; his mail was full of letters
commending him for his stand; but as for actual results, there were none. One
of his most intelligent woman-friends finally summed up the situation for
him:</p>
<p>"You can rail against the Paris domination all you like; you can expose it
for the fraud that it is, and we know that it is; but it is all to no purpose,
take my word. When it comes to the question of her personal adornment, a woman
employs no reason; she knows no logic. She knows that the adornment of her body
is all that she has to match the other woman and outdo her, and to attract the
male, and nothing that you can say will influence her a particle. I know this
all seems incomprehensible to you as a man, but that is the feminine nature.
You are trying to fight something that is unfightable."</p>
<p>"Has the American woman no instinct of patriotism, then?" asked Bok.</p>
<p>"Not the least," was the answer, "when it comes to her adornment. What Paris
says, she will do, blindly and unintelligently if you will, but she will do it.
She will sacrifice her patriotism; she will even justify a possible disregard
of the decencies. Look at the present Parisian styles. They are absolutely
indecent. Women know it, but they follow them just the same, and they will. It
is all very unpleasant to say this, but it is the truth and you will find it
out. Your effort, fine as it is, will bear no fruit."</p>
<p>Wherever Bok went, women upon whose judgment he felt he could rely, told
him, in effect, the same thing. They were all regretful, in some cases ashamed
of their sex, universally apologetic; but one and all declared that such is
"the feminine nature," and Bok would only have his trouble for nothing.</p>
<p>And so it proved. For a period, the retail shops were more careful in the
number of genuine French models of gowns and hats which they exhibited, and the
label firm confessed that its trade had fallen off. But this was only
temporary. Within a year after The Journal stopped the campaign, baffled and
beaten, the trade in French labels was greater than ever, hundreds of French
models were sold that had never crossed the ocean, the American woman was being
hoodwinked on every hand, and the reign of the French couturier was once more
supreme.</p>
<p>There was no disguising the fact that the case was hopeless, and Bok
recognized and accepted the inevitable. He had, at least, the satisfaction of
having made an intelligent effort to awaken the American woman to her
unintelligent submission. But she refused to be awakened. She preferred to be a
tool: to be made a fool of.</p>
<p>Bok's probe into the feminine nature had been keenly disappointing. He had
earnestly tried to serve the American woman, and he had failed. But he was
destined to receive a still greater and deeper disappointment on his next
excursion into the feminine nature, although, this time, he was to win.</p>
<p>During his investigations into women's fashions, he had unearthed the origin
of the fashionable aigrette, the most desired of all the feathered possessions
of womankind. He had been told of the cruel torture of the mother-heron, who
produced the beautiful aigrette only in her period of maternity and who was
cruelly slaughtered, usually left to die slowly rather than killed, leaving her
whole nest of baby-birds to starve while they awaited the return of the
mother-bird.</p>
<p>Bok was shown the most heart-rending photographs portraying the butchery of
the mother and the starvation of her little ones. He collected all the
photographs that he could secure, had the most graphic text written to them,
and began their publication. He felt certain that the mere publication of the
frightfully convincing photographs would be enough to arouse the
mother-instinct in every woman and stop the wearing of the so-highly prized
feather. But for the second time in his attempt to reform the feminine nature
he reckoned beside the mark.</p>
<p>He published a succession of pages showing the frightful cost at which the
aigrette was secured. There was no challenging the actual facts as shown by the
photographic lens: the slaughter of the mother-bird, and the starving
baby-birds; and the importers of the feather wisely remained quiet, not
attempting to answer Bok's accusations. Letters poured in upon the editor from
Audubon Society workers; from lovers of birds, and from women filled with the
humanitarian instinct. But Bok knew that the answer was not with those few: the
solution lay with the larger circle of American womanhood from which he did not
hear.</p>
<p>He waited for results. They came. But they were not those for which he had
striven. After four months of his campaign, he learned from the inside of the
importing-houses which dealt in the largest stocks of aigrettes in the United
States that the demand for the feather had more than quadrupled! Bok was
dumbfounded! He made inquiries in certain channels from which he knew he could
secure the most reliable information, and after all the importers had been
interviewed, the conviction was unescapable that just in proportion as Bok had
dwelt upon the desirability of the aigrette as the hallmark of wealth and
fashion, upon its expense, and the fact that women regarded it as the last word
in feminine adornment, he had by so much made these facts familiar to thousands
of women who had never before known of them, and had created the desire to own
one of the precious feathers.</p>
<p>Bok could not and would not accept these conclusions. It seemed to him
incredible that women would go so far as this in the question of personal
adornment. He caused the increased sales to be traced from wholesaler to
retailer, and from retailer to customer, and was amazed at the character and
standing of the latter. He had a number of those buyers who lived in adjacent
cities, privately approached and interviewed, and ascertained that, save in two
instances, they were all his readers, had seen the gruesome pictures he had
presented, and then had deliberately purchased the coveted aigrette.</p>
<p>Personally again he sought the most intelligent of his woman-friends, talked
with scores of others, and found himself facing the same trait in feminine
nature which he had encountered in his advocacy of American fashions. But this
time it seemed to Bok that the facts he had presented went so much deeper.</p>
<p>"It will be hard for you to believe," said one of his most trusted
woman-friends. "I grant your arguments: there is no gainsaying them. But you
are fighting the same thing again that you do not understand: the feminine
nature that craves outer adornment will secure it at any cost, even at the cost
of suffering."</p>
<p>"Yes," argued Bok. "But if there is one thing above everything else that we
believe a woman feels and understands, it is the mother-instinct. Do you mean
to tell me that it means nothing to her that these birds are killed in their
period of motherhood, and that a whole nest of starving baby-birds is the price
of every aigrette?"</p>
<p>"I won't say that this does not weigh with a woman. It does, naturally. But
when it comes to her possession of an ornament of beauty, as beautiful as the
aigrette, it weighs with her, but it doesn't tip the scale against her
possession of it. I am sorry to have to say this to you, but it is a fact. A
woman will regret that the mother-bird must be tortured and her babies starve,
but she will have the aigrette. She simply trains herself to forget the
origin.</p>
<p>"Take my own case. You will doubtless be shocked when I tell you that I was
perfectly aware of the conditions under which the aigrette is obtained before
you began your exposure of the method. But did it prevent my purchase of one?
Not at all. Why? Because I am a woman: I realize that no head ornament will set
off my hair so well as an aigrette. Say I am cruel if you like. I wish the
heron-mother didn't have to be killed or the babies starve, but, Mr. Bok, I
must have my beautiful aigrette!"</p>
<p>Bok was frankly astounded: he had certainly probed deep this time into the
feminine nature. With every desire and instinct to disbelieve the facts, the
deeper his inquiries went, the stronger the evidence rolled up: there was no
gainsaying it; no sense in a further disbelief of it.</p>
<p>But Bok was determined that this time he would not fail. His sense of
justice and protection to the mother-bird and her young was now fully aroused.
He resolved that he would, by compulsion, bring about what he had failed to do
by persuasion. He would make it impossible for women to be untrue to their most
sacred instinct. He sought legal talent, had a bill drawn up making it a
misdemeanor to import, sell, purchase, or wear an aigrette. Armed with this
measure, and the photographs and articles which he had published, he sought and
obtained the interest and promise of support of the most influential
legislators in several States. He felt a sense of pride in his own sex that he
had no trouble in winning the immediate interest of every legislator with whom
he talked.</p>
<p>Where he had failed with women, he was succeeding with men! The outrageous
butchery of the birds and the circumstances under which they were tortured
appealed with direct force to the sporting instinct in every man, and aroused
him. Bok explained to each that he need expect no support for such a measure
from women save from the members of the Audubon Societies, and a few
humanitarian women and bird-lovers. Women, as a whole, he argued from his
experiences, while they would not go so far as openly to oppose such a measure,
for fear of public comment, would do nothing to further its passage, for in
their hearts they preferred failure to success for the legislation. They had
frankly told him so: he was not speaking from theory.</p>
<p>In one State after another Bok got into touch with legislators. He
counselled, in each case, a quiet passage for the measure instead of one that
would draw public attention to it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a strong initiative had come from the Audubon Societies
throughout the country, and from the National Association of Audubon Societies,
at New York. This latter society also caused to be introduced bills of its own
to the same and in various legislatures, and here Bok had a valuable ally. It
was a curious fact that the Audubon officials encountered their strongest
resistance in Bok's own State: Pennsylvania. But Bok's personal acquaintance
with legislators in his Keystone State helped here materially.</p>
<p>The demand for the aigrette constantly increased and rose to hitherto
unknown figures. In one State where Bok's measure was pending before the
legislature, he heard of the coming of an unusually large shipment of aigrettes
to meet this increased demand. He wired the legislator in charge of the measure
apprising him of this fact, of what he intended to do, and urging speed in
securing the passage of the bill. Then he caused the shipment to be seized at
the dock on the ground of illegal importation.</p>
<p>The importing firm at once secured an injunction restraining the seizure.
Bok replied by serving a writ setting the injunction aside. The lawyers of the
importers got busy, of course, but meanwhile the legislator had taken advantage
of a special evening session, had the bill passed, and induced the governor to
sign it, the act taking effect at once.</p>
<p>This was exactly what Bok had been playing for. The aigrettes were now
useless; they could not be reshipped to another State, they could not be
offered for sale. The suit was dropped, and Bok had the satisfaction of seeing
the entire shipment, valued at $160,000, destroyed. He had not saved the lives
of the mother-birds, but, at least, he had prevented hundreds of American women
from wearing the hallmark of torture.</p>
<p>State after State now passed an aigrette-prohibition law until fourteen of
the principal States, including practically all the large cities, fell into
line.</p>
<p>Later, the National Association of Audubon Societies had introduced into the
United States Congress and passed a bill prohibiting the importation of
bird-feathers into the country, thus bringing a Federal law into existence.</p>
<p>Bok had won his fight, it is true, but he derived little satisfaction from
the character of his victory. His ideal of womanhood had received a severe
jolt. Women had revealed their worst side to him, and he did not like the
picture. He had appealed to what he had been led to believe was the most sacred
instinct in a woman's nature. He received no response. Moreover, he saw the
deeper love for personal vanity and finery absolutely dominate the
mother-instinct. He was conscious that something had toppled off its pedestal
which could never be replaced.</p>
<p>He was aware that his mother's words, when he accepted his editorial
position, were coming terribly true: "I am sorry you are going to take this
position. It will cost you the high ideal you have always held of your mother's
sex. But a nature, as is the feminine nature, wholly swayed inwardly by
emotion, and outwardly influenced by an insatiate love for personal adornment,
will never stand the analysis you will give it."</p>
<p>He realized that he was paying a high price for his success. Such
experiences as these--and, unfortunately, they were only two of several--were
doubtless in his mind when, upon his retirement, the newspapers clamored for
his opinions of women. "No, thank you," he said to one and all, "not a
word."</p>
<p>He did not give his reasons.</p>
<p>He never will.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_33">XXX. Cleaning Up the
Patent-Medicine and Other Evils</a></h3>
<p>In 1892 The Ladies' Home Journal announced that it would thereafter accept
no advertisements of patent medicines for its pages. It was a pioneer stroke.
During the following two years, seven other newspapers and periodicals followed
suit. The American people were slaves to self-medication, and the
patent-medicine makers had it all their own way. There was little or no legal
regulation as to the ingredients in their nostrums; the mails were wide open to
their circulars, and the pages of even the most reputable periodicals welcomed
their advertisements. The patent-medicine business in the United States ran
into the hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The business is still large;
then it was enormous.</p>
<p>Into this army of deceit and spurious medicines, The Ladies' Home Journal
fired the first gun. Neither the public nor the patent-medicine people paid
much attention to the first attacks. But as they grew, and the evidence
multiplied, the public began to comment and the nostrum makers began to get
uneasy.</p>
<p>The magazine attacked the evil from every angle. It aroused the public by
showing the actual contents of some of their pet medicines, or the absolute
worthlessness of them. The Editor got the Women's Christian Temperance Union
into action against the periodicals for publishing advertisements of medicines
containing as high as forty per cent alcohol. He showed that the most
confidential letters written by women with private ailments were opened by
young clerks of both sexes, laughed at and gossiped over, and that afterward
their names and addresses, which they had been told were held in the strictest
confidence, were sold to other lines of business for five cents each. He held
the religious press up to the scorn of church members for accepting
advertisements which the publishers knew and which he proved to be not only
fraudulent, but actually harmful. He called the United States Post Office
authorities to account for accepting and distributing obscene circular
matter.</p>
<p>He cut an advertisement out of a newspaper which ended with the
statement:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Pinkham, in her laboratory at Lynn, Massachusetts, is able to do more
for the ailing women of America than the family physician. Any woman,
therefore, is responsible for her own suffering who will not take the trouble
to write to Mrs. Pinkham for advice."</p>
<p>Next to this advertisement representing Mrs. Lydia Pinkham as "in her
laboratory," Bok simply placed the photograph of Mrs. Pinkham's tombstone in
Pine Grove Cemetery, at Lynn, showing that Mrs. Pinkham had passed away
twenty-two years before!</p>
<p>It was one of the most effective pieces of copy that the magazine used in
the campaign. It told its story with absolute simplicity, but with deadly
force.</p>
<p>The proprietors of "Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup" had strenuously denied
the presence of morphine in their preparation. Bok simply bought a bottle of
the syrup in London, where, under the English Pharmacy Act, the authorities
compelled the proprietors of the syrup to affix the following declaration on
each bottle: "This preparation, containing, among other valuable ingredients, a
small amount of morphine is, in accordance with the Pharmacy Act, hereby
labelled 'Poison!'" The magazine published a photograph of the label, and it
told its own convincing story. It is only fair to say that the makers of this
remedy now publish their formula.</p>
<p>Bok now slipped a cog in his machinery. He published a list of twenty-seven
medicines, by name, and told what they contained. One preparation, he said,
contained alcohol, opium, and digitalis. He believed he had been extremely
careful in this list. He had consulted the highest medical authorities,
physicians, and chemists. But in the instance of the one preparation referred
to above he was wrong.</p>
<p>The analysis had been furnished by the secretary of the State Board of
Health of Massachusetts; a recognized expert, who had taken it from the
analysis of a famous German chemist. It was in nearly every standard medical
authority, and was accepted by the best medical authorities. Bok accepted these
authorities as final. Nevertheless, the analysis and the experts were wrong. A
suit for two hundred thousand dollars was brought by the patent-medicine
company against The Curtis Publishing Company, and, of course, it was decided
in favor of the former. But so strong a public sentiment had been created
against the whole business of patent medicines by this time that the jury gave
a verdict of only sixteen thousand dollars, with costs, against the
magazine.</p>
<p>Undaunted, Bok kept on. He now engaged Mark Sullivan, then a young lawyer in
downtown New York, induced him to give up his practice, and bring his legal
mind to bear upon the problem. It was the beginning of Sullivan's subsequent
journalistic career, and he justified Bok's confidence in him. He exposed the
testimonials to patent medicines from senators and congressmen then so widely
published, showed how they were obtained by a journalist in Washington who made
a business of it. He charged seventy-five dollars for a senator's testimonial,
forty dollars for that of a congressman, and accepted no contract for less than
five thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Sullivan next exposed the disgraceful violation of the confidence of women
by these nostrum vendors in selling their most confidential letters to any one
who would buy them. Sullivan himself bought thousands of these letters and
names, and then wrote about them in the magazine. One prominent firm
indignantly denied the charge, asserting that whatever others might have done,
their names were always held sacred. In answer to this declaration Sullivan
published an advertisement of this righteous concern offering fifty thousand of
their names for sale.</p>
<p>Bok had now kept up the fight for over two years, and the results were
apparent on every hand. Reputable newspapers and magazines were closing their
pages to the advertisements of patent medicines; legislation was appearing in
several States; the public had been awakened to the fraud practised upon it,
and a Federal Pure Food and Drug Act was beginning to be talked about.</p>
<p>Single-handed, The Ladies' Home Journal kept up the fight until Mark
Sullivan produced an unusually strong article, but too legalistic for the
magazine. He called the attention of Norman Hapgood, then editor of Collier's
Weekly, to it, who accepted it at once, and, with Bok's permission, engaged
Sullivan, who later succeeded Hapgood as editor of Collier's. Robert J. Collier
now brought Samuel Hopkins Adams to Bok's attention and asked the latter if he
should object if Collier's Weekly joined him in his fight. The Philadelphia
editor naturally welcomed the help of the weekly, and Adams began his
wonderfully effective campaign.</p>
<p>The weekly and the monthly now pounded away together; other periodicals and
newspapers, seeing success ahead, and desiring to be part of it and share the
glory, came into the conflict, and it was not long before so strong a public
sentiment had been created as to bring about the passage of the United States
Food and Drug Act, and the patent-medicine business of the United States had
received a blow from which it has never recovered. To-day the pages of every
newspaper and periodical of recognized standing are closed to the
advertisements of patent medicines; the Drug Act regulates the ingredients, and
post office officials scan the literature sent through the United States
mails.</p>
<p>There are distinct indications that the time has come once more to scan the
patent-medicine horizon carefully, but the conditions existing in 1920 are
radically different from those prevailing in 1904.</p>
<p>One day when Bok was at luncheon with Doctor Lyman Abbott, the latter
expressed the wish that Bok would take up the subject of venereal disease as he
had the patent-medicine question.</p>
<p>"Not our question," answered Bok.</p>
<p>"It is most decidedly your question," was the reply.</p>
<p>Bok cherished the highest regard for Doctor Abbott's opinion and judgment,
and this positive declaration amazed him.</p>
<p>"Read up on the subject," counselled Doctor Abbott, "and you will find that
the evil has its direct roots in the home with the parents. You will agree with
me before you go very far that it is your question."</p>
<p>Bok began to read on the unsavory subject. It was exceedingly unpleasant
reading, but for two years Bok persisted, only to find that Doctor Abbott was
right. The root of the evil lay in the reticence of parents with children as to
the mystery of life; boys and girls were going out into the world blind-folded
as to any knowledge of their physical selves; "the bloom must not be rubbed off
the peach," was the belief of thousands of parents, and the results were
appalling. Bok pursued his investigations from books direct into the "Homes of
Refuge," "Doors of Hope," and similar institutions, and unearthed a condition,
the direct results of the false modesty of parents, that was almost
unbelievable.</p>
<p>Bok had now all his facts, but realized that for his magazine, of all
magazines, to take up this subject would be like a bolt from the blue in tens
of thousands of homes. But this very fact, the unquestioned position of the
magazine, the remarkable respect which its readers had for it, and the
confidence with which parents placed the periodical on their home tables--all
this was, after all, Bok thought, the more reason why he should take up the
matter and thresh it out. He consulted with friends, who advised against it;
his editors were all opposed to the introduction of the unsavory subject into
the magazine.</p>
<p>"But it isn't unsavory," argued Bok. "That is just it. We have made it so by
making it mysterious, by surrounding it with silence, by making it a forbidden
topic. It is the most beautiful story in life."</p>
<p>Mr. Curtis, alone, encouraged his editor. Was he sure he was right? If he
was, why not go ahead? Bok called his attention to the fact that a heavy loss
in circulation was a foregone conclusion; he could calculate upon one hundred
thousand subscribers, at least, stopping the magazine. "It is a question of
right," answered the publisher, "not of circulation."</p>
<p>And so, in 1906, with the subject absolutely prohibited in every periodical
and newspaper of standing, never discussed at a public gathering save at
medical meetings, Bok published his first editorial.</p>
<p>The readers of his magazine fairly gasped; they were dumb with astonishment!
The Ladies' Home Journal, of all magazines, to discuss such a subject! When
they had recovered from their astonishment, the parents began to write letters,
and one morning Bok was confronted with a large waste-basket full brought in by
his two office boys.</p>
<p>"Protests," laconically explained one of his editors. "More than that, the
majority threaten to stop their subscription unless you stop."</p>
<p>"All right, that proves I am right," answered Bok. "Write to each one and
say that what I have written is nothing as compared in frankness to what is
coming, and that we shall be glad to refund the unfulfilled part of their
subscriptions."</p>
<p>Day after day, thousands of letters came in. The next issue contained
another editorial, stronger than the first. Bok explained that he would not
tell the actual story of the beginning of life in the magazine--that was the
prerogative of the parents, and he had no notion of taking it away from either;
but that he meant to insist upon putting their duty squarely up to them, that
he realized it was a long fight, hence the articles to come would be many and
continued; and that those of his readers who did not believe in his policy had
better stop the magazine at once. But he reminded them that no solution of any
question was ever reached by running away from it. This question had to be
faced some time, and now was as good a time as any.</p>
<p>Thousands of subscriptions were stopped; advertisements gave notice that
they would cancel their accounts; the greatest pressure was placed upon Mr.
Curtis to order his editor to cease, and Bok had the grim experience of seeing
his magazine, hitherto proclaimed all over the land as a model advocate of the
virtues, refused admittance into thousands of homes, and saw his own friends
tear the offending pages out of the periodical before it was allowed to find a
place on their home-tables.</p>
<p>But The Journal kept steadily on. Number after number contained some article
on the subject, and finally such men and women as Jane Addams, Cardinal
Gibbons, Margaret Deland, Henry van Dyke, President Eliot, the Bishop of
London, braved the public storm, came to Bok's aid, and wrote articles for his
magazine heartily backing up his lonely fight.</p>
<p>The public, seeing this array of distinguished opinion expressing itself,
began to wonder "whether there might not be something in what Bok was saying,
after all." At the end of eighteen months, inquiries began to take the place of
protests; and Bok knew then that the fight was won. He employed two experts,
one man and one woman, to answer the inquiries, and he had published a series
of little books, each written by a different author on a different aspect of
the question.</p>
<p>This series was known as The Edward Bok Books. They sold for twenty-five
cents each, without profit to either editor or publisher. The series sold into
the tens of thousands. Information was, therefore, to be had, in authoritative
form, enabling every parent to tell the story to his or her child. Bok now
insisted that every parent should do this, and announced that he intended to
keep at the subject until the parents did. He explained that the magazine had
lost about seventy-five thousand subscribers, and that it might just as well
lose some more; but that the insistence should go on.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely the subject became a debatable one. Where, when Bok began,
the leading prophylactic society in New York could not secure five speaking
dates for its single lecturer during a session, it was now put to it to find
open dates for over ten speakers. Mothers' clubs, women's clubs, and
organizations of all kinds clamored for authoritative talks; here and there a
much-veiled article apologetically crept into print, and occasionally a
progressive school board or educational institution experimented with a talk or
two.</p>
<p>The Ladies' Home Journal published a full-page editorial declaring that
seventy of every one hundred special surgical operations on women were directly
or indirectly the result of one cause; that sixty of every one hundred new-born
blinded babies were blinded soon after birth from this same cause; and that
every man knew what this cause was!</p>
<p>Letters from men now began to pour in by the hundreds. With an oath on
nearly every line, they told him that their wives, daughters, sisters, or
mothers had demanded to know this cause, and that they had to tell them. Bok
answered these heated men and told them that was exactly why the Journal had
published the editorial, and that in the next issue there would be another for
those women who might have missed his first. He insisted that the time had come
when women should learn the truth, and that, so far as it lay in his power, he
intended to see that they did know.</p>
<p>The tide of public opinion at last turned toward The Ladies' Home Journal
and its campaign. Women began to realize that it had a case; that it was
working for their best interests and for those of their children, and they
decided that the question might as well be faced. Bok now felt that his part in
the work was done. He had started something well on its way; the common sense
of the public must do the rest. He had taken the question of natural life, and
stripped it of its false mystery in the minds of hundreds of thousands of young
people; had started their inquiring minds; had shown parents the way; had made
a forbidden topic a debatable subject, discussed in open gatherings, by the
press, an increasing number of books, and in schools and colleges. He dropped
the subject, only to take up one that was more or less akin to it.</p>
<p>That was the public drinking-cup. Here was a distinct menace that actual
examples and figures showed was spreading the most loathsome diseases among
innocent children. In 1908, he opened up the subject by ruthlessly publishing
photographs that were unpleasantly but tremendously convincing. He had now
secured the confidence of his vast public, who listened attentively to him when
he spoke on an unpleasant topic; and having learned from experience that he
would simply keep on until he got results, his readers decided that this time
they would act quickly. So quick a result was hardly ever achieved in any
campaign. Within six months legislation all over the country was introduced or
enacted prohibiting the common drinking-cup in any public gathering-place,
park, store, or theatre, and substituting the individual paper cup. Almost over
night, the germ-laden common drinking-cup, which had so widely spread disease,
disappeared; and in a number of States, the common towel, upon Bok's
insistence, met the same fate. Within a year, one of the worst menaces to
American life had been wiped out by public sentiment.</p>
<p>Bok was now done with health measures for a while, and determined to see
what he could do with two or three civic questions that he felt needed
attention.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_34">XXXI. Adventures in
Civics</a></h3>
<p>The electric power companies at Niagara Falls were beginning to draw so much
water from above the great Horseshoe Falls as to bring into speculation the
question of how soon America's greatest scenic asset would be a coal-pile with
a thin trickle of water crawling down its vast cliffs. Already companies had
been given legal permission to utilize one-quarter of the whole flow, and
additional companies were asking for further grants. Permission for forty per
cent of the whole volume of water had been granted. J. Horace McFarland, as
President of the American Civic Association, called Bok's attention to the
matter, and urged him to agitate it through his magazine so that restrictive
legislation might be secured.</p>
<p>Bok went to Washington, conferred with President Roosevelt, and found him
cognizant of the matter in all its aspects.</p>
<p>"I can do nothing," said the President, "unless there is an awakened public
sentiment that compels action. Give me that, and I'll either put the subject in
my next message to Congress or send a special message. I'm from Missouri on
this point," continued the President. "Show me that the American people want
their Falls preserved, and I'll do the rest. But I've got to be shown." Bok
assured the President he could demonstrate this to him.</p>
<p>The next number of his magazine presented a graphic picture of the Horseshoe
Falls as they were and the same Falls as they would be if more water was
allowed to be taken for power: a barren coal-pile with a tiny rivulet of water
trickling down its sides. The editorial asked whether the American women were
going to allow this? If not, each, if an American, should write to the
President, and, if a Canadian, to Earl Grey, then Governor-General of Canada.
Very soon after the magazine had reached its subscribers' hands, the letters
began to reach the White House; not by dozens, as the President's secretary
wrote to Bok, but by the hundreds and then by the thousands. "Is there any way
to turn this spigot off?" telegraphed the President's secretary. "We are really
being inundated."</p>
<p>Bok went to Washington and was shown the huge pile of letters.</p>
<p>"All right," said the President. "That's all I want. You've proved it to me
that there is a public sentiment."</p>
<p>The clerks at Rideau Hall, at Ottawa, did not know what had happened one
morning when the mail quadrupled in size and thousands of protests came to Earl
Grey. He wired the President, the President exchanged views with the
governor-general, and the great international campaign to save Niagara Falls
had begun. The American Civic Association and scores of other civic and
patriotic bodies had joined in the clamor.</p>
<p>The attorney-general and the secretary of state were instructed by the
President to look into the legal and diplomatic aspects of the question, and in
his next message to Congress President Roosevelt uttered a clarion call to that
body to restrict the power-grabbing companies.</p>
<p>The Ladies' Home Journal urged its readers to write to their congressmen and
they did by the thousands. Every congressman and senator was overwhelmed. As
one senator said: "I have never seen such an avalanche. But thanks to The
Ladies' Home Journal, I have received these hundreds of letters from my
constituents; they have told me what they want done, and they are mostly from
those of my people whose wishes I am bound to respect."</p>
<p>The power companies, of course, promptly sent their attorneys and lobbyists
to Washington; but the public sentiment aroused was too strong to be
disregarded, and on June 29, 1906, the President signed the Burton Bill
restricting the use of the water of Niagara Falls.</p>
<p>The matter was then referred to the secretary of war, William Howard Taft,
to grant the use of such volume of water as would preserve the beauty of the
Falls. McFarland and Bok wanted to be sure that Secretary Taft felt the support
of public opinion, for his policy was to be conservative, and tremendous
pressure was being brought upon him from every side to permit a more liberal
use of water. Bok turned to his readers and asked them to write to Secretary
Taft and assure him of the support of the American women in his attitude of
conservatism.</p>
<p>The flood of letters that descended upon the secretary almost taxed even his
genial nature; and when Mr. McFarland, as the editorial representative of The
Ladies' Home Journal, arose to speak at the public hearing in Washington, the
secretary said: "I can assure you that you don't have to say very much. Your
case has already been pleaded for you by, I should say at the most conservative
estimate, at least one hundred thousand women. Why, I have had letters from
even my wife and my mother."</p>
<p>Secretary Taft adhered to his conservative policy, Sir Wilfred Laurier,
premier of Canada, met the overtures of Secretary of State Root, a new
international document was drawn up, and Niagara Falls had been saved to the
American people.</p>
<p>In 1905 and in previous years the casualties resulting from fireworks on the
Fourth of July averaged from five to six thousand each year. The humorous
weekly Life and The Chicago Tribune had been for some time agitating a
restricted use of fireworks on the national fete day, but nevertheless the list
of casualties kept creeping to higher figures. Bok decided to help by arousing
the parents of America, in whose hands, after all, lay the remedy. He began a
series of articles in the magazine, showing what had happened over a period of
years, the criminality of allowing so many young lives to be snuffed out, and
suggested how parents could help by prohibiting the deadly firecrackers and
cannon, and how organizations could assist by influencing the passing of city
ordinances. Each recurring January, The Journal returned to the subject,
looking forward to the coming Fourth. It was a deep-rooted custom to eradicate,
and powerful influences, in the form of thousands of small storekeepers, were
at work upon local officials to pay no heed to the agitation. Gradually public
opinion changed. The newspapers joined in the cry; women's organizations
insisted upon action from local municipal bodies.</p>
<p>Finally, the civic spirit in Cleveland, Ohio, forced the passage of a city
ordinance prohibiting the sale or use of fireworks on the Fourth. The following
year when Cleveland reported no casualties as compared to an ugly list for the
previous. Fourth, a distinct impression was made upon other cities. Gradually,
other municipalities took action, and year by year the list of Fourth of July
casualties grew perceptibly shorter. New York City was now induced to join the
list of prohibitive cities, by a personal appeal made to its mayor by Bok, and
on the succeeding Fourth of July the city authorities, on behalf of the people
of New York City, conferred a gold medal upon Edward Bok for his services in
connection with the birth of the new Fourth in that city.</p>
<p>There still remains much to be done in cities as yet unawakened; but a
comparison of the list of casualties of 1920 with that of 1905 proves the
growth in enlightened public sentiment in fifteen years to have been steadily
increasing. It is an instance not of Bok taking the initiative--that had
already been taken--but of throwing the whole force of the magazine with those
working in the field to help. It is the American woman who is primarily
responsible for the safe and sane Fourth, so far as it already exists in this
country to-day, and it is the American woman who can make it universal.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pennypacker, as president of The Federation of Women's Clubs, now
brought to Bok's attention the conditions under which the average rural
school-teacher lived; the suffering often entailed on her in having to walk
miles to the schoolhouse in wintry weather; the discomfort she had to put up
with in the farm-houses where she was compelled to live, with the natural
result, under those conditions, that it was almost impossible to secure the
services of capable teachers, or to have good teaching even where efficient
teachers were obtained.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pennypacker suggested that Bok undertake the creation of a public
sentiment for a residence for the teacher in connection with the schoolhouse.
The parson was given a parsonage; why not the teacher a "teacherage"? The
Journal co-operated with Mrs. Pennypacker and she began the agitation of the
subject in the magazine. She also spoke on the subject wherever she went, and
induced women's clubs all over the country to join the magazine in its advocacy
of the "teacherage."</p>
<p>By personal effort, several "teacherages" were established in connection
with new schoolhouses; photographs of these were published and sent personally
to school-boards all over the country; the members of women's clubs saw to it
that the articles were brought to the attention of members of their local
school-boards; and the now-generally accepted idea that a "teacherage" must
accompany a new schoolhouse was well on its way to national recognition.</p>
<p>It only remains now for communities to install a visiting nurse in each of
these "teacherages" so that the teacher need not live in solitary isolation,
and that the health of the children at school can be looked after at first
hand. Then the nurse shall be at the call of every small American
community--particularly to be available in cases of childbirth, since in these
thinly settled districts it is too often impossible to obtain the services of a
physician, with the result of a high percentage of fatalities to mothers that
should not be tolerated by a wealthy and progressive people. No American
mother, at childbirth, should be denied the assistance of professional skill,
no matter how far she may live from a physician. And here is where a visiting
nurse in every community can become an institution of inestimable value.</p>
<p>Just about this time a group of Philadelphia physicians, headed by Doctor
Samuel McClintock Hamill, which had formed itself into a hygienic committee for
babies, waited upon Bok to ask him to join them in the creation of a permanent
organization devoted to the welfare of babies and children. Bok found that he
was dealing with a company of representative physicians, and helped to organize
"The Child Federation," an organization "to do good on a business basis."</p>
<p>It was to go to the heart of the problem of the baby in the congested
districts of Philadelphia, and do a piece of intensive work in the ward having
the highest infant mortality, establishing the first health centre in the
United States actively managed by competent physicians and nurses. This centre
was to demonstrate to the city authorities that the fearful mortality among
babies, particularly in summer, could be reduced.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was created a "Baby Saving Show," a set of graphic pictures
conveying to the eye methods of sanitation and other too often disregarded
essentials of the wise care and feeding of babies; and this travelled, like a
theatrical attraction, to different parts of the city. "Little Mothers'
Leagues" were organized to teach the little girl of ten or twelve, so often
left in charge of a family of children when the mother is at work during the
day, and demonstrations were given in various parts of the city.</p>
<p>The Child Federation now undertook one activity after the other. Under its
auspices, the first municipal Christmas tree ever erected in Philadelphia was
shown in the historic Independence Square, and with two bands of music giving
concerts every day from Christmas to New Year's Day, attracted over two hundred
thousand persons. A pavilion was erected in City Hall Square, the most central
spot in the city, and the "Baby Saving Show" was permanently placed there and
visited by over one hundred thousand visitors from every part of the country on
their way to and from the Pennsylvania Station at Broad Street.</p>
<p>A searching investigation of the Day Nurseries of Philadelphia--probably one
of the most admirable pieces of research work ever made in a city--changed the
methods in vogue and became a standard guide for similar institutions
throughout the country. So successful were the Little Mothers' Leagues that
they were introduced into the public schools of Philadelphia, and are to-day a
regular part of the curriculum. The Health Centre, its success being proved,
was taken over by the city Board of Health, and three others were
established.</p>
<p>To-day The Child Federation is recognized as one of the most practically
conducted child welfare agencies in Philadelphia, and its methods have been
followed by similar organizations all over the country. It is now rapidly
becoming the central medium through which the other agencies in Philadelphia
are working, thus avoiding the duplication of infant welfare work in the city.
Broadening its scope, it is not unlikely to become one of the greatest indirect
influences in the welfare work of Philadelphia and the vicinity, through which
other organizations will be able to work.</p>
<p>Bok's interest and knowledge in civic matters had now peculiarly prepared
him for a personal adventure into community work. Merion, where he lived, was
one of the most beautiful of the many suburbs that surround the Quaker City;
but, like hundreds of similar communities, there had been developed in it no
civic interest. Some of the most successful business men of Philadelphia lived
in Merion; they had beautiful estates, which they maintained without regard to
expense, but also without regard to the community as a whole. They were busy
men; they came home tired after a day in the city; they considered themselves
good citizens if they kept their own places sightly, but the idea of devoting
their evenings to the problems of their community had never occurred to them
before the evening when two of Bok's neighbors called to ask his help in
forming a civic association.</p>
<p>A canvass of the sentiment of the neighborhood revealed the unanimous
opinion that the experiment, if attempted, would be a failure,--an attitude not
by any means confined to the residents of Merion! Bok decided to test it out;
he called together twenty of his neighbors, put the suggestion before them and
asked for two thousand dollars as a start, so that a paid secretary might be
engaged, since the men themselves were too busy to attend to the details of the
work. The amount was immediately subscribed, and in 1913 The Merion Civic
Association applied for a charter and began its existence.</p>
<p>The leading men in the community were elected as a Board of Directors, and a
salaried secretary was engaged to carry out the directions of the Board. The
association adopted the motto: "To be nation right, and State right, we must
first be community right." Three objectives were selected with which to attract
community interest and membership: safety to life, in the form of proper police
protection; safety to property, in the form of adequate hydrant and fire-engine
service; and safety to health, in careful supervision of the water and milk
used in the community.</p>
<p>"The three S's," as they were called, brought an immediate response. They
were practical in their appeal, and members began to come in. The police force
was increased from one officer at night and none in the day, to three at night
and two during the day, and to this the Association added two special night
officers of its own. Private detectives were intermittently brought in to
"check up" and see that the service was vigilant. A fire hydrant was placed
within seven hundred feet of every house, with the insurance rates reduced from
twelve and one-half to thirty per cent; the services of three fire-engine
companies was arranged for. Fire-gongs were introduced into the community to
guard against danger from interruption of telephone service. The water supply
was chemically analyzed each month and the milk supply carefully scrutinized.
One hundred and fifty new electric-light posts specially designed, and
pronounced by experts as the most beautiful and practical road lamps ever
introduced into any community, were erected, making Merion the best-lighted
community in its vicinity.</p>
<p>At every corner was erected an artistically designed cast-iron road sign;
instead of the unsightly wooden ones, cast-iron automobile warnings were placed
at every dangerous spot; community bulletin-boards, preventing the display of
notices on trees and poles, were placed at the railroad station; litter-cans
were distributed over the entire community; a new railroad station and
postoffice were secured; the station grounds were laid out as a garden by a
landscape architect; new roads of permanent construction, from curb to curb,
were laid down; uniform tree-planting along the roads was introduced;
bird-houses were made and sold, so as to attract bird-life to the community;
toll-gates were abolished along the two main arteries of travel; the removal of
all telegraph and telephone poles was begun; an efficient Boy Scout troop was
organized, and an American Legion post; the automobile speed limit was reduced
from twenty-four to fifteen miles as a protection to children; roads were
regularly swept, cleaned, and oiled, and uniform sidewalks advocated and
secured.</p>
<p>Within seven years so efficiently had the Association functioned that its
work attracted attention far beyond its own confines and that of Philadelphia,
and caused Theodore Roosevelt voluntarily to select it as a subject for a
special magazine article in which he declared it to "stand as a model in civic
matters." To-day it may be conservatively said of The Merion Civic Association
that it is pointed out as one of the most successful suburban civic efforts in
the country; as Doctor Lyman Abbott said in The Outlook, it has made "Merion a
model suburb, which may standardize ideal suburban life, certainly for
Philadelphia, possibly for the United States."</p>
<p>When the armistice was signed in November, 1918, the Association immediately
canvassed the neighborhood to erect a suitable Tribute House, as a memorial to
the eighty-three Merion boys who had gone into the Great War: a public building
which would comprise a community centre, with an American Legion Post room, a
Boy Scout house, an auditorium, and a meeting-place for the civic activities of
Merion. A subscription was raised, and plans were already drawn for the Tribute
House, when Mr. Eldridge R. Johnson, president of the Victor Talking Machine
Company, one of the strong supporters of The Merion Civic Association,
presented his entire estate of twelve acres, the finest in Merion, to the
community, and agreed to build a Tribute House at his own expense. The grounds
represented a gift of two hundred thousand dollars, and the building a gift of
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. This building, now about to be erected,
will be one of the most beautiful and complete community centres in the United
States.</p>
<p>Perhaps no other suburban civic effort proves the efficiency of community
co-operation so well as does the seven years' work of The Merion Civic
Association. It is a practical demonstration of what a community can do for
itself by concerted action. It preached, from the very start, the gospel of
united service; it translated into actual practice the doctrine of being one's
brother's keeper, and it taught the invaluable habit of collective action. The
Association has no legal powers; it rules solely by persuasion; it accomplishes
by the power of combination; by a spirit of the community for the
community.</p>
<p>When The Merion Civic Association was conceived, the spirit of local pride
was seemingly not present in the community. As a matter of fact, it was there
as it is in practically every neighborhood; it was simply dormant; it had to be
awakened, and its value brought vividly to the community consciousness.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_35">XXXII. A Bewildered
Bok</a></h3>
<p>One of the misfortunes of Edward Bok's training, which he realized more
clearly as time went on, was that music had little or no place in his life. His
mother did not play; and aside from the fact that his father and mother were
patrons of the opera during their residence in The Netherlands, the musical
atmosphere was lacking in his home. He realized how welcome an outlet music
might be in his now busy life. So what he lacked himself and realized as a
distinct omission in his own life he decided to make possible for others.</p>
<p>The Ladies' Home Journal began to strike a definite musical note. It first
caught the eye and ear of its public by presenting the popular new marches by
John Philip Sousa; and when the comic opera of "Robin Hood" became the favorite
of the day, it secured all the new compositions by Reginald de Koven. Following
these, it introduced its readers to new compositions by Sir Arthur Sullivan,
Tosti, Moscowski, Richard Strauss, Paderewski, Josef Hofmann, Edouard Strauss,
and Mascagni. Bok induced Josef Hofmann to give a series of piano lessons in
his magazine, and Madame Marchesi a series of vocal lessons. The Journal
introduced its readers to all the great instrumental and vocal artists of the
day through articles; it offered prizes for the best piano and vocal
compositions; it had the leading critics of New York, Boston, and Chicago write
articles explanatory of orchestral music and how to listen to music.</p>
<p>Bok was early attracted by the abilities of Josef Hofmann. In 1898, he met
the pianist, who was then twenty-two years old. Of his musical ability Bok
could not judge, but he was much impressed by his unusual mentality, and soon
both learned and felt that Hofmann's art was deeply and firmly rooted. Hofmann
had a wider knowledge of affairs than other musicians whom Bok had met; he had
not narrowed his interests to his own art. He was striving to achieve a
position in his art, and, finding that he had literary ability, Bok asked him
to write a reminiscent article on his famous master, Rubinstein.</p>
<p>This was followed by other articles; the publication of his new mazurka;
still further articles; and then, in 1907, Bok offered him a regular department
in the magazine and a salaried editorship on his staff.</p>
<p>Bok's musical friends and the music critics tried to convince the editor
that Hofmann's art lay not so deep as Bok imagined; that he had been a child
prodigy, and would end where all child prodigies invariably end--opinions which
make curious reading now in view of Hofmann's commanding position in the world
of music. But while Bok lacked musical knowledge, his instinct led him to
adhere to his belief in Hofmann; and for twelve years, until Bok's retirement
as editor, the pianist was a regular contributor to the magazine. His success
was, of course, unquestioned. He answered hundreds of questions sent him by his
readers, and these answers furnished such valuable advice for piano students
that two volumes were made in book form and are to-day used by piano teachers
and students as authoritative guides.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bok's marriage had brought music directly into his domestic
circle. Mrs. Bok loved music, was a pianist herself, and sought to acquaint her
husband with what his former training had omitted. Hofmann and Bok had become
strong friends outside of the editorial relation, and the pianist frequently
visited the Bok home. But it was some time, even with these influences
surrounding him, before music began to play any real part in Bok's own
life.</p>
<p>He attended the opera occasionally; more or less under protest, because of
its length, and because his mind was too practical for the indirect operatic
form. He could not remain patient at a recital; the effort to listen to one
performer for an hour and a half was too severe a tax upon his restless nature.
The Philadelphia Orchestra gave a symphony concert each Saturday evening, and
Bok dreaded the coming of that evening in each week for fear of being taken to
hear music which he was convinced was "over his head."</p>
<p>Like many men of his practical nature, he had made up his mind on this point
without ever having heard such a concert. The word "symphony" was enough; it
conveyed to him a form of the highest music quite beyond his comprehension.
Then, too, in the back of his mind there was the feeling that, while he was
perfectly willing to offer the best that the musical world afforded in his
magazine, his readers were primarily women, and the appeal of music, after all,
he felt was largely, if not wholly, to the feminine nature. It was very
satisfying to him to hear his wife play in the evening; but when it came to
public concerts, they were not for his masculine nature. In other words, Bok
shared the all too common masculine notion that music is for women and has
little place in the lives of men.</p>
<p>One day Josef Hofmann gave Bok an entirely new point of view. The artist was
rehearsing in Philadelphia for an appearance with the orchestra, and the
pianist was telling Bok and his wife of the desire of Leopold Stokowski, who
had recently become conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, to eliminate
encores from his symphonic programmes; he wanted to begin the experiment with
Hofmann's appearance that week. This was a novel thought to Bok: why eliminate
encores from any concert? If he liked the way any performer played, he had
always done his share to secure an encore. Why should not the public have an
encore if it desired it, and why should a conductor or a performer object?
Hofmann explained to him the entity of a symphonic programme; that it was made
up with one composition in relation to the others as a sympathetic unit, and
that an encore was an intrusion, disturbing the harmony of the whole.</p>
<p>"I wish you would let Stokowski come out and explain to you what he is
trying to do," said Hofmann. "He knows what he wants, and he is right in his
efforts; but he doesn't know how to educate the public. There is where you
could help him."</p>
<p>But Bok had no desire to meet Stokowski. He mentally pictured the conductor:
long hair; feet never touching the earth; temperament galore; he knew them! And
he had no wish to introduce the type into his home life.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bok, however, ably seconded Josef Hofmann, and endeavored to dissipate
Bok's preconceived notion, with the result that Stokowksi came to the Bok
home.</p>
<p>Bok was not slow to see that Stokowski was quite the reverse of his mental
picture, and became intensely interested in the youthful conductor's practical
way of looking at things. It was agreed that the encore "bull" was to be taken
by the horns that week; that no matter what the ovation to Hofmann might be,
however the public might clamor, no encore was to be forthcoming; and Bok was
to give the public an explanation during the following week. The next concert
was to present Mischa Elman, and his co-operation was assured so that
continuity of effort might be counted upon.</p>
<p>In order to have first-hand information, Bok attended the concert that
Saturday evening. The symphony, Dvorak's "New World Symphony," amazed Bok by
its beauty; he was more astonished that he could so easily grasp any music in
symphonic form. He was equally surprised at the simple beauty of the other
numbers on the programme, and wondered not a little at his own perfectly
absorbed attention during Hofmann's playing of a rather long concerto.</p>
<p>The pianist's performance was so beautiful that the audience was uproarious
in its approval; it had calculated, of course, upon an encore, and recalled the
pianist again and again until he had appeared and bowed his thanks several
times. But there was no encore; the stage hands appeared and moved the piano to
one side, and the audience relapsed into unsatisfied and rather bewildered
silence.</p>
<p>Then followed Bok's publicity work in the newspapers, beginning the next
day, exonerating Hofmann and explaining the situation. The following week, with
Mischa Elman as soloist, the audience once more tried to have its way and its
cherished encore, but again none was forthcoming. Once more the newspapers
explained; the battle was won, and the no-encore rule has prevailed at the
Philadelphia Orchestra concerts from that day to this, with the public entirely
resigned to the idea and satisfied with the reason therefor.</p>
<p>But the bewildered Bok could not make out exactly what had happened to his
preconceived notion about symphonic music. He attended the following Saturday
evening concert; listened to a Brahms symphony that pleased him even more than
had "The New World," and when, two weeks later, he heard the Tschaikowski
"Pathetique" and later the "Unfinished" symphony, by Schubert, and a Beethoven
symphony, attracted by each in turn, he realized that his prejudice against the
whole question of symphonic music had been both wrongly conceived and
baseless.</p>
<p>He now began to see the possibility of a whole world of beauty which up to
that time had been closed to him, and he made up his mind that he would enter
it. Somehow or other, he found the appeal of music did not confine itself to
women; it seemed to have a message for men. Then, too, instead of dreading the
approach of Saturday evenings, he was looking forward to them, and invariably
so arranged his engagements that they might not interfere with his attendance
at the orchestra concerts.</p>
<p>After a busy week, he discovered that nothing he had ever experienced served
to quiet him so much as these end-of-the-week concerts. They were not too long,
an hour and a half at the utmost; and, above all, except now and then, when the
conductor would take a flight into the world of Bach, he found he followed him
with at least a moderate degree of intelligence; certainly with personal
pleasure and inner satisfaction.</p>
<p>Bok concluded he would not read the articles he had published on the meaning
of the different "sections" of a symphony orchestra, or the books issued on
that subject. He would try to solve the mechanism of an orchestra for himself,
and ascertain as he went along the relation that each portion bore to the
other. When, therefore, in 1913, the president of the Philadelphia Orchestra
Association asked him to become a member of its Board of Directors, his
acceptance was a natural step in the gradual development of his interest in
orchestral music.</p>
<p>The public support given to orchestras now greatly interested Bok. He was
surprised to find that every symphony orchestra had a yearly deficit. This he
immediately attributed to faulty management; but on investigating the whole
question he learned that a symphony orchestra could not possibly operate, at a
profit or even on a self-sustaining basis, because of its weekly change of
programme, the incessant rehearsals required, and the limited number of times
it could actually play within a contracted season. An annual deficit was
inevitable.</p>
<p>He found that the Philadelphia Orchestra had a small but faithful group of
guarantors who each year made good the deficit in addition to paying for its
concert seats. This did not seem to Bok a sound business plan; it made of the
orchestra a necessarily exclusive organization, maintained by a few; and it
gave out this impression to the general public, which felt that it did not
"belong," whereas the true relation of public and orchestra was that of mutual
dependence. Other orchestras, he found, as, for example, the Boston Symphony
and the New York Philharmonic had their deficits met by one individual patron
in each case. This, to Bok's mind, was an even worse system, since it entirely
excluded the public, making the orchestra dependent on the continued interest
and life of a single man.</p>
<p>In 1916 Bok sought Mr. Alexander Van Rensselaer, the president of the
Philadelphia Orchestra Association, and proposed that he, himself, should
guarantee the deficit of the orchestra for five years, provided that during
that period an endowment fund should be raised, contributed by a large number
of subscribers, and sufficient in amount to meet, from its interest, the annual
deficit. It was agreed that the donor should remain in strict anonymity, an
understanding which has been adhered to until the present writing.</p>
<p>The offer from the "anonymous donor," presented by the president, was
accepted by the Orchestra Association. A subscription to an endowment fund was
shortly afterward begun; and the amount had been brought to eight hundred
thousand dollars when the Great War interrupted any further additions. In the
autumn of 1919, however, a city-wide campaign for an addition of one million
dollars to the endowment fund was launched. The amount was not only secured,
but over-subscribed. Thus, instead of a guarantee fund, contributed by thirteen
hundred subscribers, with the necessity for annual collection, an endowment
fund of one million eight hundred thousand dollars, contributed by fourteen
thousand subscribers, has been secured; and the Philadelphia Orchestra has been
promoted from a privately maintained organization to a public institution in
which fourteen thousand residents of Philadelphia feel a proprietary interest.
It has become in fact, as well as in name, "our orchestra."</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_36">XXXIII. How Millions of People
Are Reached</a></h3>
<p>The success of The Ladies' Home Journal went steadily forward. The
circulation had passed the previously unheard-of figure for a monthly magazine
of a million and a half copies per month; it had now touched a million and
three-quarters.</p>
<p>And not only was the figure so high, but the circulation itself was
absolutely free from "water." The public could not obtain the magazine through
what are known as clubbing-rates, since no subscriber was permitted to include
any other magazine with it; years ago it had abandoned the practice of offering
premiums or consideration of any kind to induce subscriptions; and the
newsdealers were not allowed to return unsold copies of the periodical. Hence
every copy was either purchased by the public at the full price at a newsstand,
or subscribed for at its stated subscription price. It was, in short, an
authoritative circulation. And on every hand the question was being asked: "How
is it done? How is such a high circulation obtained?"</p>
<p>Bok's invariable answer was that he gave his readers the very best of the
class of reading that he believed would interest them, and that he spared
neither effort nor expense to obtain it for them. When Mr. Howells once asked
him how he classified his audience, Bok replied: "We appeal to the intelligent
American woman rather than to the intellectual type." And he gave her the best
he could obtain. As he knew her to be fond of the personal type of literature,
he gave her in succession Jane Addams's story of "My Fifteen Years at Hull
House," and the remarkable narration of Helen Keller's "Story of My Life"; he
invited Henry Van Dyke, who had never been in the Holy Land, to go there, camp
out in a tent, and then write a series of sketches, "Out of Doors in the Holy
Land"; he induced Lyman Abbott to tell the story of "My Fifty Years as a
Minister." He asked Gene Stratton Porter to tell of her bird-experiences in the
series: "What I Have Done with Birds"; he persuaded Dean Hodges to turn from
his work of training young clergymen at the Episcopal Seminary, at Cambridge,
and write one of the most successful series of Bible stories for children ever
printed; and then he supplemented this feature for children by publishing
Rudyard Kipling's "Just So" stories and his "Puck of Pook's Hill." He induced
F. Hopkinson Smith to tell the best stories he had ever heard in his wide
travels in "The Man in the Arm Chair"; he got Kate Douglas Wiggin to tell a
country church experience of hers in "The Old Peabody Pew"; and Jean Webster
her knowledge of almshouse life in "Daddy Long Legs."</p>
<p>The readers of The Ladies' Home Journal realized that it searched the whole
field of endeavor in literature and art to secure what would interest them, and
they responded with their support.</p>
<p>Another of Bok's methods in editing was to do the common thing in an
uncommon way. He had the faculty of putting old wine in new bottles and the
public liked it. His ideas were not new; he knew there were no new ideas, but
he presented his ideas in such a way that they seemed new. It is a significant
fact, too, that a large public will respond more quickly to an idea than it
will to a name.</p>
<p>This The Ladies' Home Journal proved again and again. Its most pronounced
successes, from the point of view of circulation, were those in which the idea
was the sole and central appeal. For instance, when it gave American women an
opportunity to look into a hundred homes and see how they were furnished, it
added a hundred thousand copies to the circulation. There was nothing new in
publishing pictures of rooms and, had it merely done this, it is questionable
whether success would have followed the effort. It was the way in which it was
done. The note struck entered into the feminine desire, reflected it, piqued
curiosity, and won success.</p>
<p>Again, when The Journal decided to show good taste and bad taste in
furniture, in comparative pictures, another hundred thousand circulation came
to it. There was certainly nothing new in the comparative idea; but applied to
a question of taste, which could not be explained so clearly in words, it
seemed new.</p>
<p>Had it simply presented masterpieces of art as such, the series might have
attracted little attention. But when it announced that these masterpieces had
always been kept in private galleries, and seen only by the favored few; that
the public had never been allowed to get any closer to them than to read of the
fabulous prices paid by their millionaire owners; and that now the magazine
would open the doors of those exclusive galleries and let the public in--public
curiosity was at once piqued, and over one hundred and fifty thousand persons
who had never before bought the magazine were added to the list.</p>
<p>In not one of these instances, nor in the case of other successful series,
did the appeal to the public depend upon the names of contributors; there were
none: it was the idea which the public liked and to which it responded.</p>
<p>The editorial Edward Bok enjoyed this hugely; the real Edward Bok did not.
The one was bottled up in the other. It was a case of absolute self-effacement.
The man behind the editor knew that if he followed his own personal tastes and
expressed them in his magazine, a limited audience would be his instead of the
enormous clientele that he was now reaching. It was the man behind the editor
who had sought expression in the idea of Country Life, the magazine which his
company sold to Doubleday, Page Company, and which he would personally have
enjoyed editing.</p>
<p>It was in 1913 that the real Edward Bok, bottled up for twenty-five years,
again came to the surface. The majority stockholders of The Century Magazine
wanted to dispose of their interest in the periodical. Overtures were made to
The Curtis Publishing Company, but its hands were full, and the matter was
presented for Bok's personal consideration. The idea interested him, as he saw
in The Century a chance for his self-expression. He entered into negotiations,
looked carefully into the property itself and over the field which such a
magazine might fill, decided to buy it, and install an active editor while he,
as a close adviser, served as the propelling power.</p>
<p>Bok figured out that there was room for one of the trio of what was, and
still is, called the standard-sized magazines, namely Scribner's, Harper's, and
The Century. He believed, as he does to-day, that any one of these magazines
could be so edited as to preserve all its traditions and yet be so ingrafted
with the new progressive, modern spirit as to dominate the field and constitute
itself the leader in that particular group. He believed that there was a field
which would produce a circulation in the neighborhood of a quarter of a million
copies a month for one of those magazines, so that it would be considered not,
as now, one of three, but the one.</p>
<p>What Bok saw in the possibilities of the standard illustrated magazine has
been excellently carried out by Mr. Ellery Sedgwick in The Atlantic Monthly;
every tradition has been respected, and yet the new progressive note introduced
has given it a position and a circulation never before attained by a
non-illustrated magazine of the highest class.</p>
<p>As Bok studied the field, his confidence in the proposition, as he saw it,
grew. For his own amusement, he made up some six issues of The Century as he
visualized it, and saw that the articles he had included were all obtainable.
He selected a business manager and publisher who would relieve him of the
manufacturing problems; but before the contract was actually closed Bok,
naturally, wanted to consult Mr. Curtis, who was just returning from abroad, as
to this proposed sharing of his editor.</p>
<p>For one man to edit two magazines inevitably meant a distribution of effort,
and this Mr. Curtis counselled against. He did not believe that any man could
successfully serve two masters; it would also mean a division of public
association; it might result in Bok's physical undoing, as already he was
overworked. Mr. Curtis's arguments, of course, prevailed; the negotiations were
immediately called off, and for the second time--for some wise reason,
undoubtedly--the real Edward Bok was subdued. He went back into the bottle!</p>
<p>A cardinal point in Edward Bok's code of editing was not to commit his
magazine to unwritten material, or to accept and print articles or stories
simply because they were the work of well-known persons. And as his
acquaintance with authors multiplied, he found that the greater the man the
more willing he was that his work should stand or fall on its merit, and that
the editor should retain his prerogative of declination--if he deemed it wise
to exercise it.</p>
<p>Rudyard Kipling was, and is, a notable example of this broad and just
policy. His work is never imposed upon an editor; it is invariably submitted,
in its completed form, for acceptance or declination. "Wait until it's done,"
said Kipling once to Bok as he outlined a story to him which the editor liked,
"and see whether you want it. You can't tell until then." (What a difference
from the type of author who insists that an editor must take his or her story
before a line is written!)</p>
<p>"I told Watt to send you," he writes to Bok, "the first four of my child
stories (you see I hadn't forgotten my promise), and they may serve to amuse
you for a while personally, even if you don't use them for publication.
Frankly, I don't myself see how they can be used for the L. H. J.; but they're
part of a scheme of mine for trying to give children not a notion of history,
but a notion of the time sense which is at the bottom of all knowledge of
history; and history, rightly understood, means the love of one's fellow-men
and the land one lives in."</p>
<p>James Whitcomb Riley was another who believed that an editor should have the
privilege of saying "No" if he so elected. When Riley was writing a series of
poems for Bok, the latter, not liking a poem which the Hoosier poet sent him,
returned it to him. He wondered how Riley would receive a
declination--naturally a rare experience. But his immediate answer settled the
question:</p>
<p>"Thanks equally for your treatment of both poems, [he wrote], the one
accepted and the other returned. Maintain your own opinions and respect, and my
vigorous esteem for you shall remain 'deep-rooted in the fruitful soil.' No
occasion for apology whatever. In my opinion, you are wrong; in your opinion,
you are right; therefore, you are right,--at least righter than wronger. It is
seldom that I drop other work for logic, but when I do, as my grandfather was
wont to sturdily remark, 'it is to some purpose, I can promise you.'</p>
<p>"Am goin' to try mighty hard to send you the dialect work you've so long
wanted; in few weeks at furthest. 'Patience and shuffle the cards.'</p>
<p>"I am really, just now, stark and bare of one commonsence idea. In the
writing line, I was never so involved before and see no end to the ink-(an
humorous voluntary provocative, I trust of much merriment)-creasing pressure of
it all.</p>
<p>"Even the hope of waking to find myself famous is denied me, since I haven't
time in which to fall asleep. Therefore, very drowsily and yawningly indeed, I
am your</p>
<p>"James Whitcomb Riley."</p>
<p>Neither did the President of the United States consider himself above a
possible declination of his material if it seemed advisable to the editor. In
1916 Woodrow Wilson wrote to Bok:</p>
<p>"Sometime ago you kindly intimated to me that you would like to publish an
article from me. At first, it seemed impossible for me to undertake anything of
the kind, but I have found a little interval in which I have written something
on Mexico which I hope you will think worthy of publication. If not, will you
return it to me?"</p>
<p>The President, too, acted as an intermediary in turning authors in Bok's
direction, when the way opened. In a letter written not on the official White
House letterhead, but on his personal "up-stairs" stationery, as it is called,
he asks:</p>
<p>"Will you do me the favor of reading the enclosed to see if it is worthy of
your acceptance for the Journal, or whether you think it indicates that the
writer, with a few directions and suggestions, might be useful to you?</p>
<p>"It was written by --. She is a woman of great refinement, of a very
unusually broad social experience, and of many exceptional gifts, who
thoroughly knows what she is writing about, whether she has yet discovered the
best way to set it forth or not. She is one of the most gifted and resourceful
hostesses I have known, but has now fallen upon hard times.</p>
<p>"Among other things that she really knows, she really does thoroughly know
old furniture and all kinds of china worth knowing.</p>
<p>"Pardon me if I have been guilty of an indiscretion in sending this direct
to you. I am throwing myself upon your indulgence in my desire to help a
splendid woman.</p>
<p>"She has a great collection of recipes which housekeepers would like to
have. Does a serial cook-book sound like nonsense?"</p>
<p>A further point in his editing which Bok always kept in view was his rule
that the editor must always be given the privilege of revising or editing a
manuscript. Bok's invariable rule was, of course, to submit his editing for
approval, but here again the bigger the personality back of the material, the
more willing the author was to have his manuscript "blue pencilled," if he were
convinced that the deletions or condensations improved or at least did not
detract from his arguments. It was the small author who ever resented the touch
of the editorial pencil upon his precious effusions.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact there are few authors who cannot be edited with
advantage, and it would be infinitely better for our reading if this truth was
applied to some of the literature of to-day.</p>
<p>Bok had once under his hand a story by Mark Twain, which he believed
contained passages that should be deleted. They represented a goodly portion of
the manuscript. They were, however, taken out, and the result submitted to the
humorist. The answer was curious. Twain evidently saw that Bok was right, for
he wrote: "Of course, I want every single line and word of it left out," and
then added: "Do me the favor to call the next time you are again in Hartford. I
want to say things which--well, I want to argue with you." Bok never knew what
those "things" were, for at the next meeting they were not referred to.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, a curious coincidence that all the Presidents of the United
States whose work Bok had occasion to publish were uniformly liberal with
regard to having their material edited.</p>
<p>Colonel Roosevelt was always ready to concede improvement: "Fine," he wrote;
"the changes are much for the better. I never object to my work being improved,
where it needs it, so long as the sense is not altered."</p>
<p>William Howard Taft wrote, after being subjected to editorial revision: "You
have done very well by my article. You have made it much more readable by your
rearrangement."</p>
<p>Mr. Cleveland was very likely to let his interest in a subject run counter
to the space exigencies of journalism; and Bok, in one instance, had to reduce
one of his articles considerably. He explained the reason and enclosed the
revision.</p>
<p>"I am entirely willing to have the article cut down as you suggest," wrote
the former President. "I find sufficient reason for this in the fact that the
matter you suggest for elimination has been largely exploited lately. And in
looking the matter over carefully, I am inclined to think that the article
expurgated as you suggest will gain in unity and directness. At first, I feared
it would appear a little 'bobbed' off, but you are a much better judge of that
than I. ... I leave it altogether to you."</p>
<p>It was always interesting to Bok, as a study of mental processes, to note
how differently he and some author with whom he would talk it over would see
the method of treating some theme. He was discussing the growing unrest among
American women with Rudyard Kipling at the latter's English home; and expressed
the desire that the novelist should treat the subject and its causes.</p>
<p>They talked until the early hours, when it was agreed that each should write
out a plan, suggest the best treatment, and come together the next morning.
When they did so, Kipling had mapped out the scenario of a novel; Bok had
sketched out the headings of a series of analytical articles. Neither one could
see the other's viewpoint, Kipling contending for the greater power of fiction
and Bok strongly arguing for the value of the direct essay. In this instance,
the point was never settled, for the work failed to materialize in any
form!</p>
<p>If the readers of The Ladies' Home Journal were quick to support its editor
when he presented an idea that appealed to them, they were equally quick to
tell him when he gave them something of which they did not approve. An
illustration of this occurred during the dance-craze that preceded the Great
War. In 1914, America was dance-mad, and the character of the dances rapidly
grew more and more offensive. Bok's readers, by the hundreds, urged him to come
out against the tendency.</p>
<p>The editor looked around and found that the country's terpsichorean idols
were Mr. and Mrs. Vernon Castle; he decided that, with their cooperation, he
might, by thus going to the fountainhead, effect an improvement through the
introduction, by the Castles, of better and more decorous new dances. Bok could
see no reason why the people should not dance, if they wanted to, so long as
they kept within the bounds of decency.</p>
<p>He found the Castles willing and eager to cooperate, not only because of the
publicity it would mean for them, but because they were themselves not in favor
of the new mode. They had little sympathy for the elimination of the graceful
dance by the introduction of what they called the "shuffle" or the "bunny-hug,"
"turkey-trot," and other ungraceful and unworthy dances. It was decided that
the Castles should, through Bok's magazine and their own public exhibitions,
revive the gavotte, the polka, and finally the waltz. They would evolve these
into new forms and Bok would present them pictorially. A series of three
double-page presentations was decided upon, allowing for large photographs so
that the steps could be easily seen and learned from the printed page.</p>
<p>The magazine containing the first "lesson" was no sooner published than
protests began to come in by the hundreds. Bok had not stated his object, and
the public misconstrued his effort and purpose into an acknowledgment that he
had fallen a victim to the prevailing craze. He explained in letters, but to no
purpose. Try as he might, Bok could not rid the pages of the savor of the
cabaret. He published the three dances as agreed, but he realized he had made a
mistake, and was as much disgusted as were his readers. Nor did he, in the
slightest degree, improve the dance situation. The public refused to try the
new Castle dances, and kept on turkey-trotting and bunny-hugging.</p>
<p>The Ladies' Home Journal followed the Castle lessons with a series of the
most beautiful dances of Madam Pavlowa, the Russian dancer, hoping to remove
the unfavorable impression of the former series. But it was only partially
successful. Bok had made a mistake in recognizing the craze at all; he should
have ignored it, as he had so often in the past ignored other temporary,
superficial hysterics of the public. The Journal readers knew the magazine had
made a mistake and frankly said so.</p>
<p>Which shows that, even after having been for over twenty-five years in the
editorial chair, Edward Bok was by no means infallible in his judgment of what
the public wanted or would accept.</p>
<p>No man is, for that matter.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_37">XXXIV. A War Magazine and War
Activities</a></h3>
<p>When, early in 1917, events began so to shape themselves as directly to
point to the entrance of the United States into the Great War, Edward Bok set
himself to formulate a policy for The Ladies' Home Journal. He knew that he was
in an almost insurmountably difficult position. The huge edition necessitated
going to press fully six weeks in advance of publication, and the preparation
of material fully four weeks previous to that. He could not, therefore, get
much closer than ten weeks to the date when his readers received the magazine.
And he knew that events, in war time, had a way of moving rapidly.</p>
<p>Late in January he went to Washington, consulted those authorities who could
indicate possibilities to him better than any one else, and found, as he had
suspected, that the entry of the United States into the war was a practical
certainty; it was only a question of time.</p>
<p>Bok went South for a month's holiday to get ready for the fray, and in the
saddle and on the golf links he formulated a policy. The newspapers and
weeklies would send innumerable correspondents to the front, and obviously,
with the necessity for going to press so far in advance, The Journal could not
compete with them. They would depict every activity in the field. There was but
one logical thing for him to do: ignore the "front" entirely, refuse all the
offers of correspondents, men and women, who wanted to go with the armies for
his magazine, and cover fully and practically the results of the war as they
would affect the women left behind. He went carefully over the ground to see
what these would be, along what particular lines women's activities would be
most likely to go, and then went home and back to Washington.</p>
<p>It was now March. He conferred with the President, had his fears confirmed,
and offered all the resources of his magazine to the government. His diagnosis
of the situation was verified in every detail by the authorities whom he
consulted. The Ladies' Home Journal could best serve by keeping up the morale
at home and by helping to meet the problems that would confront the women; as
the President said: "Give help in the second line of defense."</p>
<p>A year before, Bok had opened a separate editorial office in Washington and
had secured Dudley Harmon, the Washington correspondent for The New York Sun,
as his editor-in-charge. The purpose was to bring the women of the country into
a clearer understanding of their government and a closer relation with it. This
work had been so successful as to necessitate a force of four offices and
twenty stenographers. Bok now placed this Washington office on a war-basis,
bringing it into close relation with every department of the government that
would be connected with the war activities. By this means, he had an editor and
an organized force on the spot, devoting full time to the preparation of war
material, with Mr. Harmon in daily conference with the department chiefs to
secure the newest developments.</p>
<p>Bok learned that the country's first act would be to recruit for the navy,
so as to get this branch of the service into a state of preparedness. He
therefore secured Franklin D. Roosevelt, assistant secretary of the navy, to
write an article explaining to mothers why they should let their boys volunteer
for the Navy and what it would mean to them.</p>
<p>He made arrangements at the American Red Cross Headquarters for an official
department to begin at once in the magazine, telling women the first steps that
would be taken by the Red Cross and how they could help. He secured former
President William Howard Taft, as chairman of the Central Committee of the Red
Cross, for the editor of this department.</p>
<p>He cabled to Viscount Northcliffe and Ian Hay for articles showing what the
English women had done at the outbreak of the war, the mistakes they had made,
what errors the American women should avoid, the right lines along which
English women had worked and how their American sisters could adapt these
methods to transatlantic conditions.</p>
<p>And so it happened that when the first war issue of The Journal appeared on
April 20th, only three weeks after the President's declaration, it was the only
monthly that recognized the existence of war, and its pages had already begun
to indicate practical lines along which women could help.</p>
<p>The President planned to bring the Y. M. C. A. into the service by making it
a war-work body, and Bok immediately made arrangements for a page to appear
each month under the editorship of John R. Mott, general secretary of the
International Y. M. C. A. Committee.</p>
<p>The editor had been told that the question of food would come to be of
paramount importance; he knew that Herbert Hoover had been asked to return to
America as soon as he could close his work abroad, and he cabled over to his
English representative to arrange that the proposed Food Administrator should
know, at first hand, of the magazine and its possibilities for the furtherance
of the proposed Food Administration work.</p>
<p>The Food Administration was no sooner organized than Bok made arrangements
for an authoritative department to be conducted in his magazine, reflecting the
plans and desires of the Food Administration, and Herbert Hoover's first public
declaration as food administrator to the women of America was published in The
Ladies' Home Journal. Bok now placed all the resources of his four-color
press-work at Mr. Hoover's disposal; and the Food Administration's domestic
experts, in conjunction with the full culinary staff of the magazine, prepared
the new war dishes and presented them appetizingly in full colors under the
personal endorsement of Mr. Hoover and the Food Administration. From six to
sixteen articles per month were now coming from Mr. Hoover's department
alone.</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture was laid under contribution by the magazine
for the best ideas for the raising of food from the soil in the creation of
war-gardens.</p>
<p>Doctor Anna Howard Shaw had been appointed chairman of the National
Committee of the Women's Council of National Defence, and Bok arranged at once
with her that she should edit a department page in his magazine, setting forth
the plans of the committee and how the women of America could co-operate
therewith.</p>
<p>The magazine had thus practically become the semiofficial mouthpiece of all
the various government war bureaus and war-work bodies. James A. Flaherty,
supreme knight of the Knights of Columbus, explained the proposed work of that
body; Commander Evangeline Booth presented the plans of the Salvation Army, and
Mrs. Robert E. Speer, president of the National Board of the Young Women's
Christian Association, reflected the activities of her organization; while the
President's daughter, Miss Margaret Wilson, discussed her work for the opening
of all schoolhouses as community war-centres.</p>
<p>The magazine reflected in full-color pictures the life and activities of the
boys in the American camps, and William C. Gorgas, surgeon-general of the
United States, was the spokesman in the magazine for the health of the
boys.</p>
<p>Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo interpreted the first Liberty Loan "drive"
to the women; the President of the United States, in a special message to
women, wrote in behalf of the subsequent Loan; Bernard Baruch, as chairman of
the War Industries Board, made clear the need for war-time thrift; the recalled
ambassador to Germany, James W. Gerard, told of the ingenious plans resorted to
by German women which American women could profitably copy; and Elizabeth,
Queen of the Belgians, explained the plight of the babies and children of
Belgium, and made a plea to the women of the magazine to help. So straight to
the point did the Queen write, and so well did she present her case that within
six months there had been sent to her, through The Ladies' Home Journal, two
hundred and forty-eight thousand cans of condensed milk, seventy-two thousand
cans of pork and beans, five thousand cans of infants' prepared food, eighty
thousand cans of beef soup, and nearly four thousand bushels of wheat,
purchased with the money donated by the magazine readers.</p>
<p>On the coming of the coal question, the magazine immediately reflected the
findings and recommendations of the Fuel Administration, and Doctor H. A.
Garfield, as fuel administrator, placed the material of his Bureau at the
disposal of the magazine's Washington editor.</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Information now sought the magazine for the issuance
of a series of official announcements explanatory of matters to women.</p>
<p>When the "meatless" and the "wheatless" days were inaugurated, the women of
America found that the magazine had anticipated their coming; and the issue
appearing on the first of these days, as publicly announced by the Food
Administration, presented pages of substitutes in full colors.</p>
<p>Of course, miscellaneous articles on the war there were, without number.
Before the war was ended, the magazine did send a representative to the front
in Catherine Van Dyke, who did most effective work for the magazine in articles
of a general nature. The fullpage battle pictures, painted from data furnished
by those who took actual part, were universally commended and exhausted even
the largest editions that could be printed. A source of continual astonishment
was the number of copies of the magazine found among the boys in France; it
became the third in the official War Department list of the most desired
American periodicals, evidently representing a tie between the boys and their
home folks. But all these "war" features, while appreciated and desirable,
were, after all, but a side-issue to the more practical economic work of the
magazine. It was in this service that the magazine excelled, it was for this
reason that the women at home so eagerly bought it, and that it was impossible
to supply each month the editions called for by the extraordinary demand.</p>
<p>Considering the difficulties to be surmounted, due to the advance
preparation of material, and considering that, at the best, most of its advance
information, even by the highest authorities, could only be in the nature of
surmise, the comprehensive manner in which The Ladies' Home Journal covered
every activity of women during the Great War, will always remain one of the
magazine's most noteworthy achievements. This can be said without reserve here,
since the credit is due to no single person; it was the combined, careful work
of its entire staff, weighing every step before it was taken, looking as
clearly into the future as circumstances made possible, and always seeking the
most authoritative sources of information.</p>
<p>Bok merely directed. Each month, before his magazine went to press, he
sought counsel and vision from at least one of three of the highest sources;
and upon this guidance, as authoritative as anything could be in times of war
when no human vision can actually foretell what the next day will bring forth,
he acted. The result, as one now looks back upon it, was truly amazing; an
uncanny timeliness would often color material on publication day. Of course,
much of this was due to the close government co-operation, so generously and
painstakingly given.</p>
<p>With the establishment of the various war boards in Washington, Bok received
overtures to associate himself exclusively with them and move to the capital.
He sought the best advice and with his own instincts pointing in the same way,
he decided that he could give his fullest service by retaining his editorial
position and adding to that such activities as his leisure allowed. He
undertook several private commissions for the United States Government, and
then he was elected vice-president of the Philadelphia Belgian Relief
Commission.</p>
<p>With the Belgian consul-general for the United States, Mr. Paul Hagemans, as
the president of the Commission, and guided by his intimate knowledge of the
Belgian people, Bok selected a committee of the ablest buyers and merchants in
the special lines of foods which he would have to handle. The Commission raised
hundreds of thousands of dollars, with which it purchased foods and chartered
ships. The quantities of food ran into prodigious figures; Bok felt that he was
feeding the world; and yet when the holds of the ships began to take in the
thousands of crates of canned goods, the bags of peas and beans, and the
endless tins of condensed milk, it was amazing how the piled-up boxes melted
from the piers and the ship-holds yawned for more. Flour was sent in seemingly
endless hundreds of barrels.</p>
<p>Each line of goods was bought by a specialist on the Committee at the lowest
quantity prices; and the result was that the succession of ships leaving the
port of Philadelphia was a credit to the generosity of the people of the city
and the commonwealth. The Commission delegated one of its members to go to
Belgium and personally see that the food actually reached the needy Belgian
people.</p>
<p>In September, 1917, word was received from John R. Mott that Bok had been
appointed State chairman for the Y. M. C. A. War Work Council for Pennsylvania;
that a country-wide campaign for twenty-five million dollars would be launched
six weeks hence, and that Pennsylvania's quota was three millions of dollars.
He was to set up an organization throughout the State, conduct the drive from
Philadelphia, speak at various centres in Pennsylvania, and secure the
allocated quota. Bok knew little or nothing about the work of the Y. M. C. A.;
he accordingly went to New York headquarters and familiarized himself with the
work being done and proposed; and then began to set up his State machinery. The
drive came off as scheduled, Pennsylvania doubled its quota, subscribing six
instead of three millions of dollars, and of this was collected five million
eight hundred and twenty-nine thousand dollars--almost one hundred per
cent.</p>
<p>Bok, who was now put on the National War Work Council of the Y. M. C. A. at
New York, was asked to take part in the creation of the machinery necessary for
the gigantic piece of work that the organization had been called upon by the
President of the United States to do. It was a herculean task; practically
impossible with any large degree of efficiency in view of the almost
insurmountable obstacles to be contended with. But step by step the imperfect
machinery was set up, and it began to function in the home camps. Then the
overseas work was introduced by the first troops going to France, and the
difficulties increased a hundredfold.</p>
<p>But Bok's knowledge of the workings of the government departments at
Washington, the war boards, and the other war-work organizations soon convinced
him that the Y. M. C. A. was not the only body, asked to set up an organization
almost overnight, that was staggering under its load and falling down as often
as it was functioning.</p>
<p>The need for Y. M. C. A. secretaries overseas and in the camps soon became
acute, and Bok was appointed chairman of the Philadelphia Recruiting Committee.
As in the case of his Belgian relief work, he at once surrounded himself with
an able committee: this time composed of business and professional men trained
in a knowledge of human nature in the large, and of wide acquaintance in the
city. Simultaneously, Bok secured the release of one of the ablest men in the
Y. M. C. A. service in New York, Edward S. Wilkinson, who became the permanent
secretary of the Philadelphia Committee. Bok organized a separate committee
composed of automobile manufacturers to recruit for chauffeurs and
mechanicians; another separate committee recruited for physical directors, and
later a third committee recruited for women.</p>
<p>The work was difficult because the field of selection was limited. No men
between the military ages could be recruited; the War Boards at Washington had
drawn heavily upon the best men of the city; the slightest physical defect
barred out a man, on account of the exposure and strain of the Y. M. C. A.
work; the residue was not large.</p>
<p>It was scarcely to be wondered at that so many incompetent secretaries had
been passed and sent over to France. How could it have been otherwise with the
restricted selection? But the Philadelphia Committee was determined,
nevertheless, that its men should be of the best, and it decided that to get a
hundred men of unquestioned ability would be to do a greater job than to send
over two hundred men of indifferent quality. The Committee felt that enough
good men were still in Philadelphia and the vicinity, if they could be pried
loose from their business and home anchorages, and that it was rather a
question of incessant work than an impossible task.</p>
<p>Bok took large advertising spaces in the Philadelphia newspapers, asking for
men of exceptional character to go to France in the service of the Y. M. C. A.;
and members of the Committee spoke before the different commercial bodies at
their noon luncheons. The applicants now began to come, and the Committee began
its discriminating selection. Each applicant was carefully questioned by the
secretary before he appeared before the Committee, which held sittings twice a
week. Hence of over twenty-five hundred applicants, only three hundred appeared
before the Committee, of whom two hundred and fifty-eight were passed and sent
overseas.</p>
<p>The Committee's work was exceptionally successful; it soon proved of so
excellent a quality as to elicit a cabled request from Paris headquarters to
send more men of the Philadelphia type. The secret of this lay in the sterling
personnel of the Committee itself, and its interpretation of the standards
required; and so well did it work that when Bok left for the front to be absent
from Philadelphia for ten weeks, his Committee, with Thomas W. Hulme, of the
Pennsylvania Railroad, acting as Chairman, did some of its best work.</p>
<p>The after-results, according to the report of the New York headquarters,
showed that no Y. M. C. A. recruiting committee had equalled the work of the
Philadelphia committee in that its men, in point of service, had proved one
hundred per cent secretaries. With two exceptions, the entire two hundred and
fifty-eight men passed, brought back one hundred per cent records, some of them
having been placed in the most important posts abroad and having given the most
difficult service. The work of the other Philadelphia committees, particularly
that of the Women's Committee, was equally good.</p>
<p>To do away with the multiplicity of "drives," rapidly becoming a drain upon
the efforts of the men engaged in them, a War Chest Committee was now formed in
Philadelphia and vicinity to collect money for all the war-work agencies. Bok
was made a member of the Executive Committee, and chairman of the Publicity
Committee. In May, 1918, a campaign for twenty millions of dollars was started;
the amount was subscribed, and although much of it had to be collected after
the armistice, since the subscriptions were in twelve monthly payments, a total
of fifteen and a half million dollars was paid in and turned over to the
different agencies.</p>
<p>Bok, who had been appointed one of the Boy Scout commissioners in his home
district of Merion, saw the possibilities of the Boy Scouts in the Liberty Loan
and other campaigns. Working in co-operation with the other commissioners, and
the scoutmaster of the Merion Troop, Bok supported the boys in their work in
each campaign as it came along. Although there were in the troop only nine
boys, in ages ranging from twelve to fourteen years--Bok's younger son was one
of them--so effectively did these youngsters work under the inspiration of the
scoutmaster, Thomas Dun Belfield, that they soon attracted general attention
and acquired distinction as one of the most efficient troops in the vicinity of
Philadelphia. They won nearly all the prizes offered in their vicinity, and
elicited the special approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p>Although only "gleaners" in most of the campaigns--that is, working only in
the last three days after the regular committees had scoured the
neighborhood--these Merion Boy Scouts sold over one million four hundred
thousand dollars in Liberty Bonds, and raised enough money in the Y. M. C. A.
campaign to erect one of the largest huts in France for the army boys, and a Y.
M. C. A. gymnasium at the League Island Navy Yard accommodating two thousand
sailor-boys.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1918, the eight leading war-work agencies, excepting the
Red Cross, were merged, for the purpose of one drive for funds, into the United
War Work Campaign, and Bok was made chairman for Pennsylvania. In November a
country-wide campaign was launched, the quota for Pennsylvania being twenty
millions of dollars--the largest amount ever asked of the commonwealth. Bok
organized a committee of the representative men of Pennsylvania, and proceeded
to set up the machinery to secure the huge sum. He had no sooner done this,
however, than he had to sail for France, returning only a month before the
beginning of the campaign.</p>
<p>But the efficient committee had done its work; upon his return Bok found the
organization complete. On the first day of the campaign, the false rumor that
an armistice had been signed made the raising of the large amount seem almost
hopeless; furthermore, owing to the influenza raging throughout the
commonwealth, no public meetings had been permitted or held. Still, despite all
these obstacles, not only was the twenty millions subscribed but oversubscribed
to the extent of nearly a million dollars; and in face of the fact that every
penny of this large total had to be collected after the signing of the
armistice, twenty millions of dollars was paid in and turned over to the war
agencies.</p>
<p>It is indeed a question whether any single war act on the part of the people
of Pennsylvania redounds so highly to their credit as this marvellous evidence
of patriotic generosity. It was one form of patriotism to subscribe so huge a
sum while the war was on and the guns were firing; it was quite another and a
higher patriotism to subscribe and pay such a sum after the war was over!</p>
<p>Bok's position as State chairman of the United War Work Campaign made it
necessary for him to follow authoritatively and closely the work of each of the
eight different organizations represented in the fund. Because he felt he had
to know what the Knights of Columbus, the Salvation Army, the Y. W. C. A., and
the others were doing with the money he had been instrumental in collecting,
and for which he felt, as chairman, responsible to the people of Pennsylvania,
he learned to know their work just as thoroughly as he knew what the Y. M. C.
A. was doing.</p>
<p>He had now seen and come into personal knowledge of the work of the Y. M. C.
A. from his Philadelphia point of vantage, with his official connection with it
at New York headquarters; he had seen the work as it was done in the London and
Paris headquarters; and he had seen the actual work in the American camps, the
English rest-camps, back of the French lines, in the trenches, and as near the
firing-line as he had been permitted to go.</p>
<p>He had, in short, seen the Y. M. C. A. function from every angle, but he had
also seen the work of the other organizations in England and France, back of
the lines and in the trenches. He found them all faulty--necessarily so. Each
had endeavored to create an organization within an incredibly short space of
time and in the face of adverse circumstances. Bok saw at once that the charge
that the Y. M. C. A. was "falling down" in its work was as false as that the
Salvation Army was doing "a marvellous work" and that the K. of C. was
"efficient where others were incompetent," and that the Y. W. C. A. was
"nowhere to be seen."</p>
<p>The Salvation Army was unquestionably doing an excellent piece of work
within a most limited area; it could not be on a wider scale, when one
considered the limited personnel it had at its command. The work of the K. of
C. was not a particle more or less efficient than the work of the other
organizations. What it did, it strove to do well, but so did the others. The Y.
W. C. A. made little claim about its work in France, since the United States
Government would not, until nearly at the close of the war, allow women to be
sent over in the uniforms of any of the war-work organizations. But no one can
gainsay for a single moment the efficient service rendered by the Y. W. C. A.
in its hostess-house work in the American camps; that work alone would have
entitled it to the support of the American people. That of the Y. M. C. A. was
on so large a scale that naturally its inefficiency was often in proportion to
its magnitude.</p>
<p>Bok was in France when the storm of criticism against the Y. M. C. A. broke
out, and, as State chairman for Pennsylvania, it was his duty to meet the
outcry when it came over to the United States. That the work of the Y. M. C. A.
was faulty no one can deny. Bok saw the "holes" long before they were called to
the attention of the public, but he also saw the almost impossible task, in
face of prevailing difficulties, of caulking them up. No one who was not in
France can form any conception of the practically insurmountable obstacles
against which all the war-work organizations worked; and the larger the work
the greater were the obstacles, naturally. That the Y. M. C. A. and the other
similar agencies made mistakes is not the wonder so much as that they did not
make more. The real marvel is that they did so much efficient work. For after
we get a little farther away from the details and see the work of these
agencies in its broader aspects, when we forget the lapses--which, after all,
though irritating and regrettable, were not major--the record as a whole will
stand as a most signal piece of volunteer service.</p>
<p>What was actually accomplished was nothing short of marvellous; and it is
this fact that must be borne in mind; not the omissions, but the commissions.
And when the American public gets that point of view--as it will, and, for that
matter, is already beginning to do--the work of the American Y. M. C. A. will
no longer suffer for its omissions, but will amaze and gladden by its
accomplishments. As an American officer of high rank said to Bok at Chaumont
headquarters: "The mind cannot take in what the war would have been without the
'Y.'" And that, in time, will be the universal American opinion, extended, in
proportion to their work, to all the war-work agencies and the men and women
who endured, suffered, and were killed in their service.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_38">XXXV. At the Battle-Fronts in
the Great War</a></h3>
<p>It was in the summer of 1918 that Edward Bok received from the British
Government, through its department of public information, of which Lord
Beaverbrook was the minister, an invitation to join a party of thirteen
American editors to visit Great Britain and France. The British Government, not
versed in publicity methods, was anxious that selected parties of American
publicists should see, personally, what Great Britain had done, and was doing
in the war; and it had decided to ask a few individuals to pay personal visits
to its munition factories, its great aerodromes, its Great Fleet, which then
lay in the Firth of Forth, and to the battle-fields. It was understood that no
specific obligation rested upon any member of the party to write of what he
saw: he was asked simply to observe and then, with discretion, use his
observations for his own guidance and information in future writing. In fact,
each member was explicitly told that much of what he would see could not be
revealed either personally or in print.</p>
<p>The party embarked in August amid all the attendant secrecy of war
conditions. The steamer was known only by a number, although later it turned
out to be the White Star liner, Adriatic. Preceded by a powerful United States
cruiser, flanked by destroyers, guided overhead by observation balloons, the
Adriatic was found to be the first ship in a convoy of sixteen other ships with
thirty thousand United States troops on board.</p>
<p>It was a veritable Armada that steamed out of lower New York harbor on that
early August morning, headed straight into the rising sun. But it was a voyage
of unpleasant war reminders, with life-savers carried every moment of the day,
with every light out at night, with every window and door as if hermetically
sealed so that the stuffy cabins deprived of sleep those accustomed to fresh
air, with over sixty army men and civilians on watch at night, with life-drills
each day, with lessons as to behavior in life-boats; and with a fleet of
eighteen British destroyers meeting the convoy upon its approach to the Irish
Coast after a thirteen days' voyage of constant anxiety. No one could say he
travelled across the Atlantic Ocean in war days for pleasure, and no one
did.</p>
<p>Once ashore, the party began a series of inspections of munition plants,
ship-yards, aeroplane factories and of meetings with the different members of
the English War Cabinet. Luncheons and dinners were the order of each day until
broken by a journey to Edinburgh to see the amazing Great Fleet, with the
addition of six of the foremost fighting machines of the United States Navy,
all straining like dogs at leash, awaiting an expected dash from the bottled-up
German fleet. It was a formidable sight, perhaps never equalled: those lines of
huge, menacing, and yet protecting fighting machines stretching down the river
for miles, all conveying the single thought of the power and extent of the
British Navy and its formidable character as a fighting unit.</p>
<p>It was upon his return to London that Bok learned, through the confidence of
a member of the British "inner circle," the amazing news that the war was
practically over: that Bulgaria had capitulated and was suing for peace; that
two of the Central Power provinces had indicated their strong desire that the
war should end; and that the first peace intimations had gone to the President
of the United States. All diplomatic eyes were turned toward Washington. Yet
not a hint of the impending events had reached the public. The Germans were
being beaten back, that was known; it was evident that the morale of the German
army was broken; that Foch had turned the tide toward victory; but even the
best-informed military authorities outside of the inner diplomatic circles,
predicted that the war would last until the spring of 1919, when a final
"drive" would end it. Yet, at that very moment, the end of the war was in
sight!</p>
<p>Next Bok went to France to visit the battle-fields. It was arranged that the
party should first, under guidance of British officers, visit back of the
British lines; and then, successively, be turned over to the American and
French Governments, and visit the operations back of their armies.</p>
<p>It is an amusing fact that although each detail of officers delegated to
escort the party "to the front" received the most explicit instructions from
their superior officers to take the party only to the quiet sectors where there
was no fighting going on, each detail from the three governments successively
brought the party directly under shell-fire, and each on the first day of the
"inspection." It was unconsciously done: the officers were as much amazed to
find themselves under fire as were the members of the party, except that the
latter did not feel the responsibility to an equal degree. The officers, in
each case, were plainly worried: the editors were intensely interested.</p>
<p>They were depressing trips through miles and miles of devastated villages
and small cities. From two to three days each were spent in front-line posts on
the Amiens-Bethune, Albert-Peronne, Bapaume-Soissons, St. Mihiel, and back of
the Argonne sectors. Often, the party was the first civilian group to enter a
town evacuated only a week before, and all the horrible evidence of bloody
warfare was fresh and plain. Bodies of German soldiers lay in the trenches
where they had fallen; wired bombs were on every hand, so that no object could
be touched that lay on the battle-fields; the streets of some of the towns were
still mined, so that no automobiles could enter; the towns were deserted, the
streets desolate. It was an appalling panorama of the most frightful results of
war.</p>
<p>The picturesqueness and romance of the war of picture books were missing. To
stand beside an English battery of thirty guns laying a barrage as they fired
their shells to a point ten miles distant, made one feel as if one were an
actual part of real warfare, and yet far removed from it, until the battery was
located from the enemy's "sausage observation"; then the shells from the enemy
fired a return salvo, and the better part of valor was discretion a few miles
farther back.</p>
<p>The amazing part of the "show," however, was the American doughboy. Never
was there a more cheerful, laughing, good-natured set of boys in the world;
never a more homesick, lonely, and complaining set. But good nature
predominated, and the smile was always uppermost, even when the moment looked
the blackest, the privations were worst, and the longing for home the
deepest.</p>
<p>Bok had been talking to a boy who lived near his own home, who was on his
way to the front and "over the top" in the Argonne mess. Three days afterward,
at a hospital base where a hospital train was just discharging its load of
wounded, Bok walked among the boys as they lay on their stretchers on the
railroad platform waiting for bearers to carry them into the huts. As he
approached one stretcher, a cheery voice called, "Hello, Mr. Bok. Here I am
again."</p>
<p>It was the boy he had left just seventy-two hours before hearty and
well.</p>
<p>"Well, my boy, you weren't in it long, were you?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," answered the boy; "Fritzie sure got me first thing. Hadn't gone a
hundred yards over the top. Got a cigarette?" (the invariable question).</p>
<p>Bok handed a cigarette to the boy, who then said: "Mind sticking it in my
mouth?" Bok did so and then offered him a light; the boy continued, all with
his wonderful smile: "If you don't mind, would you just light it? You see,
Fritzie kept both of my hooks as souvenirs."</p>
<p>With both arms amputated, the boy could still jest and smile!</p>
<p>It was the same boy who on his hospital cot the next day said: "Don't you
think you could do something for the chap next to me, there on my left? He's
really suffering: cried like hell all last night. It would be a Godsend if you
could get Doc to do something."</p>
<p>A promise was given that the surgeon should be seen at once, but the boy was
asked: "How about you?"</p>
<p>"Oh," came the cheerful answer, "I'm all right. I haven't anything to hurt.
My wounded members are gone--just plain gone. But that chap has got
something--he got the real thing!"</p>
<p>What was the real thing according to such a boy's idea?</p>
<p>There were beautiful stories that one heard "over there." One of the most
beautiful acts of consideration was told, later, of a lovable boy whose throat
had been practically shot away. During his convalescence he had learned the art
of making beaded bags. It kept him from talking, the main prescription. But one
day he sold the bag which he had first made to a visitor, and with his face
radiant with glee he sought the nurse-mother to tell her all about his good
fortune. Of course, nothing but a series of the most horrible guttural sounds
came from the boy: not a word could be understood. It was his first venture
into the world with the loss of his member, and the nurse-mother could not find
it in her heart to tell the boy that not a word which he spoke was
understandable. With eyes full of tears she placed both of her hands on the
boy's shoulders and said to him: "I am so sorry, my boy. I cannot understand a
word you say to me. You evidently do not know that I am totally deaf. Won't you
write what you want to tell me?"</p>
<p>A look of deepest compassion swept the face of the boy. To think that one
could be so afflicted, and yet so beautifully tender and always so radiantly
cheerful, he wrote her.</p>
<p>Pathos and humor followed rapidly one upon the other "at the front" in those
gruesome days, and Bok was to have his spirits lightened somewhat by an
incident of the next day. He found himself in one of the numerous little towns
where our doughboys were billeted, some in the homes of the peasants, others in
stables, barns, outhouses, lean-tos, and what not. These were the troops on
their way to the front where the fighting in the Argonne Forest was at that
time going on. As Bok was walking with an American officer, the latter pointed
to a doughboy crossing the road, followed by as disreputable a specimen of a
pig as he had ever seen. Catching Bok's smile, the officer said: "That's Pinney
and his porker. Where you see the one you see the other."</p>
<p>Bok caught up with the boy, and said: "Found a friend, I see, Buddy?"</p>
<p>"I sure have," grinned the doughboy, "and it sticks closer than a poor
relation, too."</p>
<p>"Where did you pick it up?"</p>
<p>"Oh, in there," said the soldier, pointing to a dilapidated barn.</p>
<p>"Why in there?"</p>
<p>"My home," grinned the boy.</p>
<p>"Let me see," said Bok, and the doughboy took him in with the pig following
close behind. "Billeted here--been here six days. The pig was here when we
came, and the first night I lay down and slept, it came up to me and stuck its
snout in my face and woke me up. Kind enough, all right, but not very
comfortable: it stinks so."</p>
<p>"Yes; it certainly does. What did you do?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I got some grub I had and gave it to eat: thought it might be hungry,
you know. I guess that sort of settled it, for the next night it came again and
stuck its snout right in my mug. I turned around, but it just climbed over me
and there it was."</p>
<p>"Well, what did you do then? Chase it out?"</p>
<p>"Chase it out?" said the doughboy, looking into Bok's face with the most
unaffected astonishment. "Why, mister, that's a mother-pig, that is. She's
going to have young ones in a few days. How could I chase her out?"</p>
<p>"You're quite right, Buddy," said Bok. "You couldn't do that."</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said the boy. "The worst of it is, what am I going to do with her
when we move up within a day or two? I can't take her along to the front, and I
hate to leave her here. Some one might treat her rough."</p>
<p>"Captain," said Bok, hailing the officer, "you can attend to that, can't
you, when the time comes?"</p>
<p>"I sure can, and I sure will," answered the Captain. And with a quick
salute, Pinney and his porker went off across the road!</p>
<p>Bok was standing talking to the commandant of one of the great French army
supply depots one morning. He was a man of forty; a colonel in the regular
French army. An erect, sturdy-looking man with white hair and mustache, and who
wore the single star of a subaltern on his sleeve, came up, saluted, delivered
a message, and then asked:</p>
<p>"Are there any more orders, sir?"</p>
<p>"No," was the reply.</p>
<p>He brought his heels together with a click, saluted again, and went
away.</p>
<p>The commandant turned to Bok with a peculiar smile on his face and
asked:</p>
<p>"Do you know who that man is?"</p>
<p>"No," was the reply.</p>
<p>"That is my father," was the answer.</p>
<p>The father was then exactly seventy-two years old. He was a retired business
man when the war broke out. After two years of the heroic struggle he decided
that he couldn't keep out of it. He was too old to fight, but after long
insistence he secured a commission. By one of the many curious coincidences of
the war he was assigned to serve under his own son.</p>
<p>When under the most trying conditions, the Americans never lost their sense
of fun. On the staff of a prison hospital in Germany, where a number of
captured American soldiers were being treated, a German sergeant became quite
friendly with the prisoners under his care. One day he told them that he had
been ordered to active service on the front. He felt convinced that he would be
captured by the English, and asked the Americans if they would not give him
some sort of testimonial which he could show if he were taken prisoner, so that
he would not be ill-treated.</p>
<p>The Americans were much amused at this idea, and concocted a note of
introduction, written in English. The German sergeant knew no English and could
not understand his testimonial, but he tucked it in his pocket, well
satisfied.</p>
<p>In due time, he was sent to the front and was captured by "the ladies from
hell," as the Germans called the Scotch kilties. He at once presented his
introduction, and his captors laughed heartily when they read:</p>
<p>"This is L--. He is not a bad sort of chap. Don't shoot him; torture him
slowly to death."</p>
<p>One evening as Bok was strolling out after dinner a Red Cross nurse came to
him, explained that she had two severely wounded boys in what remained of an
old hut: that they were both from Pennsylvania, and had expressed a great
desire to see him as a resident of their State.</p>
<p>"Neither can possibly survive the night," said the nurse.</p>
<p>"They know that?" asked Bok.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, but like all our boys they are lying there joking with each
other."</p>
<p>Bok was taken into what remained of a room in a badly shelled farmhouse, and
there, on two roughly constructed cots, lay the two boys. Their faces had been
bandaged so that nothing was visible except the eyes of each boy. A candle in a
bottle standing on a box gave out the only light. But the eyes of the boys were
smiling as Bok came in and sat down on the box on which the nurse had been
sitting. He talked with the boys, got as much of their stories from them as he
could, and told them such home news as he thought might interest them.</p>
<p>After half an hour he arose to leave, when the nurse said: "There is no one
here, Mr. Bok, to say the last words to these boys. Will you do it?" Bok stood
transfixed. In sending men over in the service of the Y. M. C. A. he had
several times told them to be ready for any act that they might be asked to
render, even the most sacred one. And here he stood himself before that duty.
He felt as if he stood stripped before his Maker. Through the glassless window
the sky lit up constantly with the flashes of the guns, and then followed the
booming of a shell as it landed.</p>
<p>"Yes, won't you, sir?" asked the boy on the right cot as he held out his
hand. Bok took it, and then the hand of the other boy reached out.</p>
<p>What to say, he did not know. Then, to his surprise, he heard himself
repeating extract after extract from a book by Lyman Abbott called The Other
Room, a message to the bereaved declaring the non-existence of death, but that
we merely move from this earth to another: from one room to another, as it
were. Bok had not read the book for years, but here was the subconscious self
supplying the material for him in his moment of greatest need. Then he
remembered that just before leaving home he had heard sung at matins, after the
prayer for the President, a beautiful song called "Passing Souls." He had asked
the rector for a copy of it; and, wondering why, he had put it in his wallet
that he carried with him. He took it out now and holding the hand of the boy at
his right, he read to them:</p>
<pre class="poem">
  For the passing souls we pray,
  Saviour, meet them on their way;
  Let their trust lay hold on Thee
  Ere they touch eternity.
 
  Holy counsels long forgot
  Breathe again 'mid shell and shot;
  Through the mist of life's last pain
  None shall look to Thee in vain.
 
  To the hearts that know Thee, Lord,
  Thou wilt speak through flood or sword;
  Just beyond the cannon's roar,
  Thou art on the farther shore.
 
  For the passing souls we pray,
  Saviour, meet them on the way;
  Thou wilt hear our yearning call,
  Who hast loved and died for all.
</pre>
<p>Absolute stillness reigned in the room save for the half-suppressed sob from
the nurse and the distant booming of the cannon. As Bok finished, he heard the
boy at his right say slowly: "Saviour-meet-me-on-my-way": with a little
emphasis on the word "my." The hand in his relaxed slowly, and then fell on the
cot; and he saw that the soul of another brave American boy had "gone
West."</p>
<p>Bok glanced at the other boy, reached for his hand, shook it, and looking
deep into his eyes, he left the little hut.</p>
<p>He little knew where and how he was to look into those eyes again!</p>
<p>Feeling the need of air in order to get hold of himself after one of the
most solemn moments of his visit to the front, Bok strolled out, and soon found
himself on what only a few days before had been a field of carnage where the
American boys had driven back the Germans. Walking in the trenches and looking
out, in the clear moonlight, over the field of desolation and ruin, and
thinking of the inferno that had been enacted there only so recently, he
suddenly felt his foot rest on what seemed to be a soft object. Taking his
"ever-ready" flash from his pocket, he shot a ray at his feet, only to realize
that his foot was resting on the face of a dead German!</p>
<p>Bok had had enough for one evening! In fact, he had had enough of war in all
its aspects; and he felt a sigh of relief when, a few days thereafter, he
boarded The Empress of Asia for home, after a ten-weeks absence.</p>
<p>He hoped never again to see, at first hand, what war meant!</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_39">XXXVI. The End of Thirty Years'
Editorship</a></h3>
<p>On the voyage home, Edward Bok decided that, now the war was over, he would
ask his company to release him from the editorship of The Ladies' Home Journal.
His original plan had been to retire at the end of a quarter of a century of
editorship, when in his fiftieth year. He was, therefore, six years behind his
schedule. In October, 1919, he would reach his thirtieth anniversary as editor,
and he fixed upon this as an appropriate time for the relinquishment of his
duties.</p>
<p>He felt he had carried out the conditions under which the editorship of the
magazine had been transferred to him by Mrs. Curtis, that he had brought them
to fruition, and that any further carrying on of the periodical by him would be
of a supplementary character. He had, too, realized his hope of helping to
create a national institution of service to the American woman, and he felt
that his part in the work was done.</p>
<p>He considered carefully where he would leave an institution which the public
had so thoroughly associated with his personality, and he felt that at no point
in its history could he so safely transfer it to other hands. The position of
the magazine in the public estimation was unquestioned; it had never been so
strong. Its circulation not only had outstripped that of any other monthly
periodical, but it was still growing so rapidly that it was only a question of
a few months when it would reach the almost incredible mark of two million
copies per month. With its advertising patronage exceeding that of any other
monthly, the periodical had become, probably, the most valuable and profitable
piece of magazine property in the world.</p>
<p>The time might never come again when all conditions would be equally
favorable to a change of editorship. The position of the magazine was so
thoroughly assured that its progress could hardly be affected by the retirement
of one editor, and the accession of another. There was a competent editorial
staff, the members of which had been with the periodical from ten to thirty
years each. This staff had been a very large factor in the success of the
magazine. While Bok had furnished the initiative and supplied the directing
power, a large part of the editorial success of the magazine was due to the
staff. It could carry on the magazine without his guidance.</p>
<p>Moreover, Bok wished to say good-bye to his public before it decided, for
some reason or other, to say good-bye to him. He had no desire to outstay his
welcome. That public had been wonderfully indulgent toward his shortcomings,
lenient with his errors, and tremendously inspiring to his best endeavor. He
would not ask too much of it. Thirty years was a long tenure of office, one of
the longest, in point of consecutively active editorship, in the history of
American magazines.</p>
<p>He had helped to create and to put into the life of the American home a
magazine of peculiar distinction. From its beginning it had been unlike any
other periodical; it had always retained its individuality as a magazine apart
from the others. It had sought to be something more than a mere assemblage of
stories and articles. It had consistently stood for ideals; and, save in one or
two instances, it had carried through what it undertook to achieve. It had a
record of worthy accomplishment; a more fruitful record than many imagined. It
had become a national institution such as no other magazine had ever been. It
was indisputably accepted by the public and by business interests alike as the
recognized avenue of approach to the intelligent homes of America.</p>
<p>Edward Bok was content to leave it at this point.</p>
<p>He explained all this in December, 1918, to the Board of Directors, and
asked that his resignation be considered. It was understood that he was to
serve out his thirty years, thus remaining with the magazine for the best part
of another year.</p>
<p>In the material which The Journal now included in its contents, it began to
point the way to the problems which would face women during the reconstruction
period. Bok scanned the rather crowded field of thought very carefully, and
selected for discussion in the magazine such questions as seemed to him most
important for the public to understand in order to face and solve its impending
problems. The outstanding question he saw which would immediately face men and
women of the country was the problem of Americanization. The war and its
after-effects had clearly demonstrated this to be the most vital need in the
life of the nation, not only for the foreign-born but for the American as
well.</p>
<p>The more one studied the problem the clearer it became that the vast
majority of American-born needed a refreshing, and, in many cases, a new
conception of American ideals as much as did the foreign-born, and that the
latter could never be taught what America and its institutions stood for until
they were more clearly defined in the mind of the men and women of American
birth.</p>
<p>Bok went to Washington, consulted with Franklin K. Lane, secretary of the
interior, of whose department the Government Bureau of Americanization was a
part. A comprehensive series of articles was outlined; the most expert writer,
Esther Everett Lape, who had several years of actual experience in
Americanization work, was selected; Secretary Lane agreed personally to read
and pass upon the material, and to assume the responsibility for its
publication.</p>
<p>With the full and direct co-operation of the Federal Bureau of
Americanization, the material was assembled and worked up with the result that,
in the opinion of the director of the Federal Bureau, the series proved to be
the most comprehensive exposition of practical Americanization adapted to city,
town, and village, thus far published.</p>
<p>The work on this series was one of the last acts of Edward Bok's editorship;
and it was peculiarly gratifying to him that his editorial work should end with
the exposition of that Americanization of which he himself was a product. It
seemed a fitting close to the career of a foreign-born Americanized editor.</p>
<p>The scope of the reconstruction articles now published, and the clarity of
vision shown in the selection of the subjects, gave a fresh impetus to the
circulation of the magazine; and now that the government's embargo on the use
of paper had been removed, the full editions of the periodical could again be
printed. The public responded instantly.</p>
<p>The result reached phenomenal figures. The last number under Bok's full
editorial control was the issue of October, 1919. This number was oversold with
a printed edition of two million copies--a record never before achieved by any
magazine. This same issue presented another record unattained in any single
number of any periodical in the world. It carried between its covers the
amazing total of over one million dollars in advertisements.</p>
<p>This was the psychological point at which to stop. And Edward Bok did.
Although his official relation as editor did not terminate until January, 1920,
when the number which contained his valedictory editorial was issued, his
actual editorship ceased on September 22, 1919. On that day he handed over the
reins to his successor.</p>
<p>As Bok was, on that day, about to leave his desk for the last time, it was
announced that a young soldier whom he "had met and befriended in France" was
waiting to see him. When the soldier walked into the office he was to Bok only
one of the many whom he had met on the other side. But as the boy shook hands
with him and said: "I guess you do not remember me, Mr. Bok," there was
something in the eyes into which he looked that startled him. And then, in a
flash, the circumstances under which he had last seen those eyes came to
him.</p>
<p>"Good heavens, my boy, you are not one of those two boys in the little hut
that I--"</p>
<p>"To whom you read the poem 'Passing Souls,' that evening. Yes, sir, I'm the
boy who had hold of your left hand. My bunkie, Ben, went West that same
evening, you remember."</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the editor, "I remember; I remember only too well," and again
Bok felt the hand in his relax, drop from his own, and heard the words:
"Saviour-meet-me-on-my way."</p>
<p>The boy's voice brought Bok back to the moment.</p>
<p>"It's wonderful you should remember me; my face was all bound up--I guess
you couldn't see anything but my eyes."</p>
<p>"Just the eyes, that's right," said Bok. "But they burned into me all right,
my boy."</p>
<p>"I don't think I get you, sir," said the boy.</p>
<p>"No, you wouldn't," Bok replied. "You couldn't, boy, not until you're older.
But, tell me, how in the world did you ever get out of it?"</p>
<p>"Well, sir," answered the boy, with that shyness which we all have come to
know in the boys who actually did, "I guess it was a close call, all right. But
just as you left us, a hospital corps happened to come along on its way to the
back and Miss Nelson--the nurse, you remember?--she asked them to take me
along. They took me to a wonderful hospital, gave me fine care, and then after
a few weeks they sent me back to the States, and I've been in a hospital over
here ever since. Now, except for this thickness of my voice that you notice,
which Doc says will be all right soon, I'm fit again. The government has given
me a job, and I came here on leave just to see my parents up-State, and I
thought I'd like you to know that I didn't go West after all."</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, Edward Bok left his editorial office for the last
time.</p>
<p>But as he went home his thoughts were not of his last day at the office, nor
of his last acts as editor, but of his last caller-the soldier-boy whom he had
left seemingly so surely on his way "West," and whose eyes had burned into his
memory on that fearful night a year before!</p>
<p>Strange that this boy should have been his last visitor!</p>
<p>As John Drinkwater, in his play, makes Abraham Lincoln say to General
Grant:</p>
<p>"It's a queer world!"</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_40">XXXVII. The Third
Period</a></h3>
<p>The announcement of Edward Bok's retirement came as a great surprise to his
friends. Save for one here and there, who had a clearer vision, the feeling was
general that he had made a mistake. He was fifty-six, in the prime of life,
never in better health, with "success lying easily upon him"--said one; "at the
very summit of his career," said another--and all agreed it was "queer,"
"strange,"--unless, they argued, he was really ill. Even the most acute
students of human affairs among his friends wondered. It seemed
incomprehensible that any man should want to give up before he was, for some
reason, compelled to do so. A man should go on until he "dropped in the
harness," they argued.</p>
<p>Bok agreed that any man had a perfect right to work until he did "drop in
the harness." But, he argued, if he conceded this right to others, why should
they not concede to him the privilege of dropping with the blinders off?</p>
<p>"But," continued the argument, "a man degenerates when he retires from
active affairs." And then, instances were pointed out as notable examples. "A
year of retirement and he was through," was the picture given of one retired
man. "In two years, he was glad to come back," and so the examples ran on. "No
big man ever retired from active business and did great work afterwards," Bok
was told.</p>
<p>"No?" he answered. "Not even Cyrus W. Field or Herbert Hoover?"</p>
<p>And all this time Edward Bok's failure to be entirely Americanized was
brought home to his consciousness. After fifty years, he was still not an
American! He had deliberately planned, and then had carried out his plan, to
retire while he still had the mental and physical capacity to enjoy the fruits
of his years of labor! For foreign to the American way of thinking it certainly
was: the protestations and arguments of his friends proved that to him. After
all, he was still Dutch; he had held on to the lesson which his people had
learned years ago; that the people of other European countries had learned;
that the English had discovered: that the Great Adventure of Life was something
more than material work, and that the time to go is while the going is
good!</p>
<p>For it cannot be denied that the pathetic picture we so often see is found
in American business life more frequently than in that of any other land: men
unable to let go--not only for their own good, but to give the younger men
behind them an opportunity. Not that a man should stop work, for man was born
to work, and in work he should find his greatest refreshment. But so often it
does not occur to the man in a pivotal position to question the possibility
that at sixty or seventy he can keep steadily in touch with a generation whose
ideas are controlled by men twenty years younger. Unconsciously he hangs on
beyond his greatest usefulness and efficiency: he convinces himself that he is
indispensable to his business, while, in scores of cases, the business would be
distinctly benefited by his retirement and the consequent coming to the front
of the younger blood.</p>
<p>Such a man in a position of importance seems often not to see that he has it
within his power to advance the fortunes of younger men by stepping out when he
has served his time, while by refusing to let go he often works dire injustice
and even disaster to his younger associates.</p>
<p>The sad fact is that in all too many instances the average American business
man is actually afraid to let go because he realizes that out of business he
should not know what to do. For years he has so excluded all other interests
that at fifty or sixty or seventy he finds himself a slave to his business,
with positively no inner resources. Retirement from the one thing he does know
would naturally leave such a man useless to himself and his family, and his
community: worse than useless, as a matter of fact, for he would become a
burden to himself, a nuisance to his family, and, when he would begin to write
"letters" to the newspapers, a bore to the community.</p>
<p>It is significant that a European or English business man rarely reaches
middle age devoid of acquaintance with other matters; he always lets the
breezes from other worlds of thought blow through his ideas, with the result
that when he is ready to retire from business he has other interests to fall
back upon. Fortunately it is becoming less uncommon for American men to retire
from business and devote themselves to other pursuits; and their number will
undoubtedly increase as time goes on, and we learn the lessons of life with a
richer background. But one cannot help feeling regretful that the custom is not
growing more rapidly.</p>
<p>A man must unquestionably prepare years ahead for his retirement, not alone
financially, but mentally as well. Bok noticed as a curious fact that nearly
every business man who told him he had made a mistake in his retirement, and
that the proper life for a man is to stick to the game and see it
through--"hold her nozzle agin the bank" as Jim Bludso would say--was a man
with no resources outside his business. Naturally, a retirement is a mistake in
the eyes of such a man; but oh, the pathos of such a position: that in a world
of so much interest, in an age so fascinatingly full of things worth doing, a
man should have allowed himself to become a slave to his business, and should
imagine no other man happy without the same claims!</p>
<p>It is this lesson that the American business man has still to learn: that no
man can be wholly efficient in his life, that he is not living a four-squared
existence, if he concentrates every waking thought on his material affairs. He
has still to learn that man cannot live by bread alone. The making of money,
the accumulation of material power, is not all there is to living. Life is
something more than these, and the man who misses this truth misses the
greatest joy and satisfaction that can come into his life-service for
others.</p>
<p>Some men argue that they can give this service and be in business, too. But
service with such men generally means drawing a check for some worthy cause,
and nothing more. Edward Bok never belittled the giving of contributions--he
solicited too much money himself for the causes in which he was interested--but
it is a poor nature that can satisfy itself that it is serving humanity by
merely signing checks. There is no form of service more comfortable or so
cheap. Real service, however, demands that a man give himself with his check.
And that the average man cannot do if he remains in affairs.</p>
<p>Particularly true is this to-day, when every problem of business is so
engrossing, demanding a man's full time and thought. It is the rare man who can
devote himself to business and be fresh for the service of others afterward. No
man can, with efficiency, serve two masters so exacting as are these. Besides,
if his business has seemed important enough to demand his entire attention, are
not the great uplift questions equally worth his exclusive thought? Are they
easier of solution than the material problems?</p>
<p>A man can live a life full-square only when he divides it into three
periods:</p>
<p>First: that of education, acquiring the fullest and best within his reach
and power;</p>
<p>Second: that of achievement: achieving for himself and his family, and
discharging the first duty of any man, that in case of his incapacity those who
are closest to him are provided for. But such provision does not mean an
accumulation that becomes to those he leaves behind him an embarrassment rather
than a protection. To prevent this, the next period confronts him:</p>
<p>Third: Service for others. That is the acid test where many a man falls
short: to know when he has enough, and to be willing not only to let well
enough alone, but to give a helping hand to the other fellow; to recognize, in
a practical way, that we are our brother's keeper; that a brotherhood of man
does exist outside after-dinner speeches. Too many men make the mistake, when
they reach the point of enough, of going on pursuing the same old game:
accumulating more money, grasping for more power until either a nervous
breakdown overtakes them and a sad incapacity results, or they drop "in the
harness," which is, of course, only calling an early grave by another name.
They cannot seem to get the truth into their heads that as they have been
helped by others so should they now help others: as their means have come from
the public, so now they owe something in turn to that public.</p>
<p>No man has a right to leave the world no better than he found it. He must
add something to it: either he must make its people better and happier, or he
must make the face of the world fairer to look at. And the one really means the
other.</p>
<p>"Idealism," immediately say some. Of course, it is. But what is the matter
with idealism? What really is idealism? Do one-tenth of those who use the
phrase so glibly know it true meaning, the part it has played in the world? The
worthy interpretation of an ideal is that it embodies an idea--a conception of
the imagination. All ideas are at first ideals. They must be. The producer
brings forth an idea, but some dreamer has dreamed it before him either in
whole or in part.</p>
<p>Where would the human race be were it not for the ideals of men? It is
idealists, in a large sense, that this old world needs to-day. Its soil is
sadly in need of new seed. Washington, in his day, was decried as an idealist.
So was Jefferson. It was commonly remarked of Lincoln that he was a "rank
idealist." Morse, Watt, Marconi, Edison--all were, at first, adjudged
idealists. We say of the League of Nations that it is ideal, and we use the
term in a derogatory sense. But that was exactly what was said of the
Constitution of the United States. "Insanely ideal" was the term used of
it.</p>
<p>The idealist, particularly to-day when there is so great need of him, is not
to be scoffed at. It is through him and only through him that the world will
see a new and clear vision of what is right. It is he who has the power of
going out of himself--that self in which too many are nowadays so deeply
imbedded; it is he who, in seeking the ideal, will, through his own clearer
perception or that of others, transform the ideal into the real. "Where there
is no vision, the people perish."</p>
<p>It was his remark that he retired because he wanted "to play" that Edward
Bok's friends most completely misunderstood. "Play" in their minds meant
tennis, golf, horseback, polo, travel, etc.--(curious that scarcely one
mentioned reading!). It so happens that no one enjoys some of these play-forms
more than Bok; but "God forbid," he said, "that I should spend the rest of my
days in a bunker or in the saddle. In moderation," he added, "yes; most
decidedly." But the phrase of "play" meant more to him than all this. Play is
diversion: exertion of the mind as well as of the body. There is such a thing
as mental play as well as physical play. We ask of play that it shall rest,
refresh, exhilarate. Is there any form of mental activity that secures all
these ends so thoroughly and so directly as doing something that a man really
likes to do, doing it with all his heart, all the time conscious that he is
helping to make the world better for some one else?</p>
<p>A man's "play" can take many forms. If his life has been barren of books or
travel, let him read or see the world. But he reaches his high estate by either
of these roads only when he reads or travels to enrich himself in order to give
out what he gets to enrich the lives of others. He owes it to himself to get
his own refreshment, his own pleasure, but he need not make that pure
self-indulgence.</p>
<p>Other men, more active in body and mind, feel drawn to the modern arena of
the great questions that puzzle. It matters not in which direction a man goes
in these matters any more than the length of a step matters so much as does the
direction in which the step is taken. He should seek those questions which
engross his deepest interest, whether literary, musical, artistic, civic,
economic, or what not.</p>
<p>Our cities, towns, communities of all sizes and kinds, urban and rural, cry
out for men to solve their problems. There is room and to spare for the man of
any bent. The old Romans looked forward, on coming to the age or retirement,
which was definitely fixed by rule, to a rural life, when they hied themselves
to a little home in the country, had open house for their friends, and "kept
bees." While bee-keeping is unquestionably interesting, there are to-day other
and more vital occupations awaiting the retired American.</p>
<p>The main thing is to secure that freedom of movement that lets a man go
where he will and do what he thinks he can do best, and prove to himself and to
others that the acquirement of the dollar is not all there is to life. No man
can realize, until on awakening some morning he feels the exhilaration, the
sense of freedom that comes from knowing he can choose his own doings and
control his own goings. Time is of more value than money, and it is that which
the man who retires feels that he possesses. Hamilton Mabie once said, after
his retirement from an active editorial position: "I am so happy that the time
has come when I elect what I shall do," which is true; but then he added: "I
have rubbed out the word 'must' from my vocabulary," which was not true. No man
ever reaches that point. Duty of some sort confronts a man in business or out
of business, and duty spells "must." But there is less "must" in the vocabulary
of the retired man; and it is this lessened quantity that gives the tang of joy
to the new day.</p>
<p>It is a wonderful inner personal satisfaction to reach the point when a man
can say: "I have enough." His soul and character are refreshed by it: he is
made over by it. He begins a new life! he gets a sense of a new joy; he feels,
for the first time, what a priceless possession is that thing that he never
knew before, freedom. And if he seeks that freedom at the right time, when he
is at the summit of his years and powers and at the most opportune moment in
his affairs, he has that supreme satisfaction denied to so many men, the
opposite of which comes home with such cruel force to them: that they have
overstayed their time: they have worn out their welcome.</p>
<p>There is no satisfaction that so thoroughly satisfies as that of going while
the going is good.</p>
<p>Still--</p>
<p>The friends of Edward Bok may be right when they said he made a mistake in
his retirement.</p>
<p>However--</p>
<p>As Mr. Dooley says: "It's a good thing, sometimes, to have people size ye up
wrong, Hinnessey: it's whin they've got ye'er measure ye're in danger."</p>
<p>Edward Bok's friends have failed to get his measure--yet!</p>
<p>They still have to learn what he has learned and is learning every day: "the
joy," as Charles Lamb so aptly put it upon his retirement, "of walking about
and around instead of to and fro."</p>
<p>The question now naturally arises, having read this record thus far: To what
extent, with his unusual opportunities of fifty years, has the Americanization
of Edward Bok gone? How far is he, to-day, an American? These questions, so
direct and personal in their nature, are perhaps best answered in a way more
direct and personal than the method thus far adopted in this chronicle. We
will, therefore, let Edward Bok answer these questions for himself, in closing
this record of his Americanization.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_41">XXXVIII. Where America Fell
Short with Me</a></h3>
<p>When I came to the United States as a lad of six, the most needful lesson
for me, as a boy, was the necessity for thrift. I had been taught in my home
across the sea that thrift was one of the fundamentals in a successful life. My
family had come from a land (the Netherlands) noted for its thrift; but we had
been in the United States only a few days before the realization came home
strongly to my father and mother that they had brought their children to a land
of waste.</p>
<p>Where the Dutchman saved, the American wasted. There was waste, and the most
prodigal waste, on every hand. In every street-car and on every ferry-boat the
floors and seats were littered with newspapers that had been read and thrown
away or left behind. If I went to a grocery store to buy a peck of potatoes,
and a potato rolled off the heaping measure, the groceryman, instead of picking
it up, kicked it into the gutter for the wheels of his wagon to run over. The
butcher's waste filled my mother's soul with dismay. If I bought a scuttle of
coal at the corner grocery, the coal that missed the scuttle, instead of being
shovelled up and put back into the bin, was swept into the street. My young
eyes quickly saw this; in the evening I gathered up the coal thus swept away,
and during the course of a week I collected a scuttleful. The first time my
mother saw the garbage pail of a family almost as poor as our own, with the
wife and husband constantly complaining that they could not get along, she
could scarcely believe her eyes. A half pan of hominy of the preceding day's
breakfast lay in the pail next to a third of a loaf of bread. In later years,
when I saw, daily, a scow loaded with the garbage of Brooklyn householders
being towed through New York harbor out to sea, it was an easy calculation that
what was thrown away in a week's time from Brooklyn homes would feed the poor
of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>At school, I quickly learned that to "save money" was to be "stingy"; as a
young man, I soon found that the American disliked the word "economy," and on
every hand as plenty grew spending grew. There was literally nothing in
American life to teach me thrift or economy; everything to teach me to spend
and to waste.</p>
<p>I saw men who had earned good salaries in their prime, reach the years of
incapacity as dependents. I saw families on every hand either living quite up
to their means or beyond them; rarely within them. The more a man earned, the
more he--or his wife--spent. I saw fathers and mothers and their children
dressed beyond their incomes. The proportion of families who ran into debt was
far greater than those who saved. When a panic came, the families "pulled in";
when the panic was over, they "let out." But the end of one year found them
precisely where they were at the close of the previous year, unless they were
deeper in debt.</p>
<p>It was in this atmosphere of prodigal expenditure and culpable waste that I
was to practise thrift: a fundamental in life! And it is into this atmosphere
that the foreign-born comes now, with every inducement to spend and no
encouragement to save. For as it was in the days of my boyhood, so it is
to-day--only worse. One need only go over the experiences of the past two
years, to compare the receipts of merchants who cater to the working-classes
and the statements of savingsbanks throughout the country, to read the story of
how the foreign-born are learning the habit of criminal wastefulness as taught
them by the American.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder, then, that in this, one of the essentials in life and in
all success, America fell short with me, as it is continuing to fall short with
every foreign-born who comes to its shores?</p>
<p>As a Dutch boy, one of the cardinal truths taught me was that whatever was
worth doing was worth doing well: that next to honesty came thoroughness as a
factor in success. It was not enough that anything should be done: it was not
done at all if it was not done well. I came to America to be taught exactly the
opposite. The two infernal Americanisms "That's good enough" and "That will do"
were early taught me, together with the maxim of quantity rather than
quality.</p>
<p>It was not the boy at school who could write the words in his copy-book best
who received the praise of the teacher; it was the boy who could write the
largest number of words in a given time. The acid test in arithmetic was not
the mastery of the method, but the number of minutes required to work out an
example. If a boy abbreviated the month January to "Jan."and the word Company
to "Co." he received a hundred per cent mark, as did the boy who spelled out
the words and who could not make the teacher see that "Co." did not spell
"Company."</p>
<p>As I grew into young manhood, and went into business, I found on every hand
that quantity counted for more than quality. The emphasis was almost always
placed on how much work one could do in a day, rather than upon how well the
work was done. Thoroughness was at a discount on every hand; production at a
premium. It made no difference in what direction I went, the result was the
same: the cry was always for quantity, quantity! And into this atmosphere of
almost utter disregard for quality I brought my ideas of Dutch thoroughness and
my conviction that doing well whatever I did was to count as a cardinal
principle in life.</p>
<p>During my years of editorship, save in one or two conspicuous instances, I
was never able to assign to an American writer, work which called for
painstaking research. In every instance, the work came back to me either
incorrect in statement, or otherwise obviously lacking in careful
preparation.</p>
<p>One of the most successful departments I ever conducted in The Ladies' Home
Journal called for infinite reading and patient digging, with the actual
results sometimes almost negligible. I made a study of my associates by turning
the department over to one after another, and always with the same result:
absolute lack of a capacity for patient research. As one of my editors,
typically American, said to me: "It isn't worth all the trouble that you put
into it." Yet no single department ever repaid the searcher more for his pains.
Save for assistance derived from a single person, I had to do the work myself
for all the years that the department continued. It was apparently impossible
for the American to work with sufficient patience and care to achieve a
result.</p>
<p>We all have our pet notions as to the particular evil which is "the curse of
America," but I always think that Theodore Roosevelt came closest to the real
curse when he classed it as a lack of thoroughness.</p>
<p>Here again, in one of the most important matters in life, did America fall
short with me; and, what is more important, she is falling short with every
foreigner that comes to her shores.</p>
<p>In the matter of education, America fell far short in what should be the
strongest of all her institutions: the public school. A more inadequate,
incompetent method of teaching, as I look back over my seven years of
attendance at three different public schools, it is difficult to conceive. If
there is one thing that I, as a foreign-born child, should have been carefully
taught, it is the English language. The individual effort to teach this, if
effort there was, and I remember none, was negligible. It was left for my
father to teach me, or for me to dig it out for myself. There was absolutely no
indication on the part of teacher or principal of responsibility for seeing
that a foreign-born boy should acquire the English language correctly. I was
taught as if I were American-born, and, of course, I was left dangling in the
air, with no conception of what I was trying to do.</p>
<p>My father worked with me evening after evening; I plunged my young mind deep
into the bewildering confusions of the language--and no one realizes the
confusions of the English language as does the foreign-born--and got what I
could through these joint efforts. But I gained nothing from the much-vaunted
public-school system which the United States had borrowed from my own country,
and then had rendered incompetent-either by a sheer disregard for the
thoroughness that makes the Dutch public schools the admiration of the world,
or by too close a regard for politics.</p>
<p>Thus, in her most important institution to the foreign-born, America fell
short. And while I am ready to believe that the public school may have
increased in efficiency since that day, it is, indeed, a question for the
American to ponder, just how far the system is efficient for the education of
the child who comes to its school without a knowledge of the first word in the
English language. Without a detailed knowledge of the subject, I know enough of
conditions in the average public school to-day to warrant at least the
suspicion that Americans would not be particularly proud of the system, and of
what it gives for which annually they pay millions of dollars in taxes.</p>
<p>I am aware in making this statement that I shall be met with convincing
instances of intelligent effort being made with the foreign-born children in
special classes. No one has a higher respect for those efforts than I
have--few, other than educators, know of them better than I do, since I did not
make my five-year study of the American public school system for naught. But I
am not referring to the exceptional instance here and there. I merely ask of
the American, interested as he is or should be in the Americanization of the
strangers within his gates, how far the public school system, as a whole, urban
and rural, adapts itself, with any true efficiency, to the foreign-born child.
I venture to color his opinion in no wise; I simply ask that he will inquire
and ascertain for himself, as he should do if he is interested in the future
welfare of his country and his institutions; for what happens in America in the
years to come depends, in large measure, on what is happening to-day in the
public schools of this country.</p>
<p>As a Dutch boy I was taught a wholesome respect for law and for authority.
The fact was impressed upon me that laws of themselves were futile unless the
people for whom they were made respected them, and obeyed them in spirit more
even than in the letter. I came to America to feel, on every hand, that exactly
the opposite was true. Laws were passed, but were not enforced; the spirit to
enforce them was lacking in the people. There was little respect for the law;
there was scarcely any for those appointed to enforce it.</p>
<p>The nearest that a boy gets to the law is through the policeman. In the
Netherlands a boy is taught that a policeman is for the protection of life and
property; that he is the natural friend of every boy and man who behaves
himself. The Dutch boy and the policeman are, naturally, friendly in their
relations. I came to America to be told that a policeman is a boy's natural
enemy; that he is eager to arrest him if he can find the slightest reason for
doing so. A policeman, I was informed, was a being to hold in fear, not in
respect. He was to be avoided, not to be made friends with. The result was
that, as did all boys, I came to regard the policeman on our beat as a distinct
enemy. His presence meant that we should "stiffen up"; his disappearance was
the signal for us to "let loose."</p>
<p>So long as one was not caught, it did not matter. I heard mothers tell their
little children that if they did not behave themselves, the policeman would put
them into a bag and carry them off, or cut their ears off. Of course, the
policeman became to them an object of terror; the law he represented, a cruel
thing that stood for punishment. Not a note of respect did I ever hear for the
law in my boyhood days. A law was something to be broken, to be evaded, to call
down upon others as a source of punishment, but never to be regarded in the
light of a safeguard.</p>
<p>And as I grew into manhood, the newspapers rang on every side with
disrespect for those in authority. Under the special dispensation of the
liberty of the press, which was construed into the license of the press, no man
was too high to escape editorial vituperation if his politics did not happen to
suit the management, or if his action ran counter to what the proprietors
believed it should be. It was not criticism of his acts, it was personal attack
upon the official; whether supervisor, mayor, governor, or president, it
mattered not.</p>
<p>It is a very unfortunate impression that this American lack of respect for
those in authority makes upon the foreign-born mind. It is difficult for the
foreigner to square up the arrest and deportation of a man who, through an
incendiary address, seeks to overthrow governmental authority, with the
ignoring of an expression of exactly the same sentiments by the editor of his
next morning's newspaper. In other words, the man who writes is immune, but the
man who reads, imbibes, and translates the editor's words into action is
immediately marked as a culprit, and America will not harbor him. But why
harbor the original cause? Is the man who speaks with type less dangerous than
he who speaks with his mouth or with a bomb?</p>
<p>At the most vital part of my life, when I was to become an American citizen
and exercise the right of suffrage, America fell entirely short. It reached out
not even the suggestion of a hand.</p>
<p>When the Presidential Conventions had been held in the year I reached my
legal majority, and I knew I could vote, I endeavored to find out whether,
being foreign-born, I was entitled to the suffrage. No one could tell me; and
not until I had visited six different municipal departments, being referred
from one to another, was it explained that, through my father's naturalization,
I became, automatically, as his son, an American citizen. I decided to read up
on the platforms of the Republican and Democratic parties, but I could not
secure copies anywhere, although a week had passed since they had been adopted
in convention.</p>
<p>I was told the newspapers had printed them. It occurred to me there must be
many others besides myself who were anxious to secure the platforms of the two
parties in some more convenient form. With the eye of necessity ever upon a
chance to earn an honest penny, I went to a newspaper office, cut out from its
files the two platforms, had them printed in a small pocket edition, sold one
edition to the American News Company and another to the News Company
controlling the Elevated Railroad bookstands in New York City, where they sold
at ten cents each. So great was the demand which I had only partially guessed,
that within three weeks I had sold such huge editions of the little books that
I had cleared over a thousand dollars.</p>
<p>But it seemed to me strange that it should depend on a foreign-born American
to supply an eager public with what should have been supplied through the
agency of the political parties or through some educational source.</p>
<p>I now tried to find out what a vote actually meant. It must be recalled that
I was only twenty-one years old, with scant education, and with no civic agency
offering me the information I was seeking. I went to the headquarters of each
of the political parties and put my query. I was regarded with puzzled
looks.</p>
<p>"What does it mean to vote?" asked one chairman.</p>
<p>"Why, on Election Day you go up to the ballot-box and put your ballot in,
and that's all there is to it."</p>
<p>But I knew very well that that was not all there was to it, and was
determined to find out the significance of the franchise. I met with dense
ignorance on every hand. I went to the Brooklyn Library, and was frankly told
by the librarian that he did not know of a book that would tell me what I
wanted to know. This was in 1884.</p>
<p>As the campaign increased in intensity, I found myself a desired person in
the eyes of the local campaign managers, but not one of them could tell me the
significance and meaning of the privilege I was for the first time to
exercise.</p>
<p>Finally, I spent an evening with Seth Low, and, of course, got the desired
information.</p>
<p>But fancy the quest I had been compelled to make to acquire the simple
information that should have been placed in my hands or made readily accessible
to me. And how many foreign-born would take equal pains to ascertain what I was
determined to find out?</p>
<p>Surely America fell short here at the moment most sacred to me: that of my
first vote!</p>
<p>Is it any easier to-day for the foreign citizen to acquire this information
when he approaches his first vote? I wonder! Not that I do not believe there
are agencies for this purpose. You know there are, and so do I. But how about
the foreign-born? Does he know it? Is it not perhaps like the owner of the
bulldog who assured the friend calling on him that it never attacked friends of
the family? "Yes," said the friend, "that's all right. You know and I know that
I am a friend of the family; but does the dog know?"</p>
<p>Is it to-day made known to the foreign-born, about to exercise his privilege
of suffrage for the first time, where he can be told what that privilege means:
is the means to know made readily accessible to him: is it, in fact, as it
should be, brought to him?</p>
<p>It was not to me; is it to him?</p>
<p>One fundamental trouble with the present desire for Americanization is that
the American is anxious to Americanize two classes--if he is a reformer, the
foreign-born; if he is an employer, his employees. It never occurs to him that
he himself may be in need of Americanization. He seems to take it for granted
that because he is American-born, he is an American in spirit and has a right
understanding of American ideals. But that, by no means, always follows. There
are thousands of the American-born who need Americanization just as much as do
the foreign-born. There are hundreds of American employers who know far less of
American ideals than do some of their employees. In fact, there are those
actually engaged to-day in the work of Americanization, men at the top of the
movement, who sadly need a better conception of true Americanism.</p>
<p>An excellent illustration of this came to my knowledge when I attended a
large Americanization Conference in Washington. One of the principal speakers
was an educator of high standing and considerable influence in one of the most
important sections of the United States. In a speech setting forth his ideas of
Americanization, he dwelt with much emphasis and at considerable length upon
instilling into the mind of the foreign-born the highest respect for American
institutions.</p>
<p>After the Conference he asked me whether he could see me that afternoon at
my hotel; he wanted to talk about contributing to the magazine. When he came,
before approaching the object of his talk, he launched out on a tirade against
the President of the United States; the weakness of the Cabinet, the
inefficiency of the Congress, and the stupidity of the Senate. If words could
have killed, there would have not remained a single living member of the
Administration at Washington.</p>
<p>After fifteen minutes of this, I reminded him of his speech and the emphasis
which he had placed upon the necessity of inculcating in the foreign-born
respect for American institutions.</p>
<p>Yet this man was a power in his community, a strong influence upon others;
he believed he could Americanize others, when he himself, according to his own
statements, lacked the fundamental principle of Americanization. What is true
of this man is, in lesser or greater degree, true of hundreds of others. Their
Americanization consists of lip-service; the real spirit, the only factor which
counts in the successful teaching of any doctrine, is absolutely missing. We
certainly cannot teach anything approaching a true Americanism until we
ourselves feel and believe and practise in our own lives what we are teaching
to others. No law, no lip-service, no effort, however well-intentioned, will
amount to anything worth while in inculcating the true American spirit in our
foreign-born citizens until we are sure that the American spirit is understood
by ourselves and is warp and woof of our own being.</p>
<p>To the American, part and parcel of his country, these particulars in which
his country falls short with the foreign-born are, perhaps, not so evident;
they may even seem not so very important. But to the foreign-born they seem
distinct lacks; they loom large; they form serious handicaps which, in many
cases, are never surmounted; they are a menace to that Americanization which
is, to-day, more than ever our fondest dream, and which we now realize more
keenly than before is our most vital need.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that I have put them down here as a concrete instance
of where and how America fell short in my own Americanization, and, what is far
more serious to me, where she is falling short in her Americanization of
thousands of other foreign-born.</p>
<p>"Yet you succeeded," it will be argued.</p>
<p>That may be; but you, on the other hand, must admit that I did not succeed
by reason of these shortcomings: it was in spite of them, by overcoming them--a
result that all might not achieve.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_42">XXXIX. What I Owe to
America</a></h3>
<p>Whatever shortcomings I may have found during my fifty-year period of
Americanization; however America may have failed to help my transition from a
foreigner into an American, I owe to her the most priceless gift that any
nation can offer, and that is opportunity.</p>
<p>As the world stands to-day, no nation offers opportunity in the degree that
America does to the foreign-born. Russia may, in the future, as I like to
believe she will, prove a second United States of America in this respect. She
has the same limitless area; her people the same potentialities. But, as things
are to-day, the United States offers, as does no other nation, a limitless
opportunity: here a man can go as far as his abilities will carry him. It may
be that the foreign-born, as in my own case, must hold on to some of the ideals
and ideas of the land of his birth; it may be that he must develop and mould
his character by overcoming the habits resulting from national shortcomings.
But into the best that the foreign-born can retain, America can graft such a
wealth of inspiration, so high a national idealism, so great an opportunity for
the highest endeavor, as to make him the fortunate man of the earth to-day.</p>
<p>He can go where he will: no traditions hamper him; no limitations are set
except those within himself. The larger the area he chooses in which to work,
the larger the vision he demonstrates, the more eager the people are to give
support to his undertakings if they are convinced that he has their best
welfare as his goal. There is no public confidence equal to that of the
American public, once it is obtained. It is fickle, of course, as are all
publics, but fickle only toward the man who cannot maintain an achieved
success.</p>
<p>A man in America cannot complacently lean back upon victories won, as he can
in the older European countries, and depend upon the glamour of the past to
sustain him or the momentum of success to carry him. Probably the most alert
public in the world, it requires of its leaders that they be alert. Its
appetite for variety is insatiable, but its appreciation, when given, is
fullhanded and whole-hearted. The American public never holds back from the man
to whom it gives; it never bestows in a niggardly way; it gives all or
nothing.</p>
<p>What is not generally understood of the American people is their wonderful
idealism. Nothing so completely surprises the foreign-born as the discovery of
this trait in the American character. The impression is current in European
countries-perhaps less generally since the war--that America is given over
solely to a worship of the American dollar. While between nations as between
individuals, comparisons are valueless, it may not be amiss to say, from
personal knowledge, that the Dutch worship the gulden infinitely more than do
the Americans the dollar.</p>
<p>I do not claim that the American is always conscious of this idealism; often
he is not. But let a great convulsion touching moral questions occur, and the
result always shows how close to the surface is his idealism. And the fact that
so frequently he puts over it a thick veneer of materialism does not affect its
quality. The truest approach, the only approach in fact, to the American
character is, as Viscount Bryce has so well said, through its idealism.</p>
<p>It is this quality which gives the truest inspiration to the foreign-born in
his endeavor to serve the people of his adopted country. He is mentally
sluggish, indeed, who does not discover that America will make good with him if
he makes good with her.</p>
<p>But he must play fair. It is essentially the straight game that the true
American plays, and he insists that you shall play it too. Evidence there is,
of course, to the contrary in American life, experiences that seem to give
ground for the belief that the man succeeds who is not scrupulous in playing
his cards. But never is this true in the long run. Sooner or later--sometimes,
unfortunately, later than sooner--the public discovers the trickery. In no
other country in the world is the moral conception so clear and true as in
America, and no people will give a larger and more permanent reward to the man
whose effort for that public has its roots in honor and truth.</p>
<p>"The sky is the limit" to the foreign-born who comes to America endowed with
honest endeavor, ceaseless industry, and the ability to carry through. In any
honest endeavor, the way is wide open to the will to succeed. Every path
beckons, every vista invites, every talent is called forth, and every efficient
effort finds its due reward. In no land is the way so clear and so free.</p>
<p>How good an American has the process of Americanization made me? That I
cannot say. Who can say that of himself? But when I look around me at the
American-born I have come to know as my close friends, I wonder whether, after
all, the foreign-born does not make in some sense a better American--whether he
is not able to get a truer perspective; whether his is not the deeper desire to
see America greater; whether he is not less content to let its faulty
institutions be as they are; whether in seeing faults more clearly he does not
make a more decided effort to have America reach those ideals or those
fundamentals of his own land which he feels are in his nature, and the best of
which he is anxious to graft into the character of his adopted land?</p>
<p>It is naturally with a feeling of deep satisfaction that I remember two
Presidents of the United States considered me a sufficiently typical American
to wish to send me to my native land as the accredited minister of my adopted
country. And yet when I analyze the reasons for my choice in both these
instances, I derive a deeper satisfaction from the fact that my strong desire
to work in America for America led me to ask to be permitted to remain
here.</p>
<p>It is this strong impulse that my Americanization has made the driving power
of my life. And I ask no greater privilege than to be allowed to live to see my
potential America become actual: the America that I like to think of as the
America of Abraham Lincoln and of Theodore Roosevelt--not faultless, but less
faulty. It is a part in trying to shape that America, and an opportunity to
work in that America when it comes, that I ask in return for what I owe to her.
A greater privilege no man could have.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_44">The Expression of a Personal
Pleasure</a></h3>
<p>I cannot close this record of a boy's development without an attempt to
suggest the sense of deep personal pleasure which I feel that the imprint on
the title-page of this book should be that of the publishing house which,
thirty-six years ago, I entered as stenographer. It was there I received my
start; it was there I laid the foundation of that future career then so hidden
from me. The happiest days of my young manhood were spent in the employ of this
house; I there began friendships which have grown closer with each passing
year. And one of my deepest sources of satisfaction is, that during all the
thirty-one years which have followed my resignation from the Scribner house, it
has been my good fortune to hold the friendship, and, as I have been led to
believe, the respect of my former employers. That they should now be my
publishers demonstrates, in a striking manner, the curious turning of the wheel
of time, and gives me a sense of gratification difficult of expression.</p>
