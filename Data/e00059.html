<h5>&ldquo;For though most men are contented only to see a
river as it runs by them, and talk of the changes in it as they
happen; when it is troubled, or when clear; when it drowns the
country in a flood, or forsakes it in a drought: yet he that
would know the nature of the water, and the causes of those
accidents (so as to guess at their continuance or return), must
find out its source, and observe with what strength it rises,
what length it runs, and how many small streams fall in, and feed
it to such a height, as make it either delightful or terrible to
the eye, and useful or dangerous to the country about
it.&rdquo;&hellip;<i>Sir William Temple's Netherlands.</i></h5>

long desired of thanking your Lordship thus publicly, for the
kindness with which you acceded to my request to be permitted to
dedicate it to you. </p>

<p>The encouragement your Lordship was pleased to give me has
served to stimulate me in the prosecution of a task, which would,
I fear, have been too great for me to have accomplished in my
present condition, under any ordinary views of ambition. Indeed,
labouring as I have been for <!--page iv DEDICATION /page-->many months past, under an almost
total deprivation of sight, (the effect of exposure and anxiety
of mind in the prosecution of geographical researches,) I owe it
to the casual assistance of some of my friends, that I am at
length enabled to lay these results before your Lordship and the
public. </p>

<p>While I feel a painful conviction that many errors must
necessarily pervade a work produced under such unfavourable
circumstances, it affords me no small consolation to reflect that
Your Lordship has been aware of my situation, and will be
disposed to grant me every reasonable indulgence. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>When I first determined on committing to the press a detailed
account of the two expeditions, which I conducted into the
interior of the Australian continent, pursuant to the orders of
Lieutenant General Darling, the late Governor of the Colony of
New South Wales, it was simply <!--page x PURPOSE OF THIS PRELIMINARY CHAPTER. /page-->with a view of laying their
results before the geographical world, and of correcting the
opinions that prevailed with regard to the unexplored country to
the westward of the Blue Mountains. I did not feel myself equal
either to the task or the responsibility of venturing any remarks
on the Colony of New South Wales itself. I had had little time
for inquiry, amidst the various duties that fell to my lot in the
ordinary routine of the service to which I belonged, when
unemployed by the Colonial Government in the prosecution of
inland discoveries. My observations had been in a great measure
confined to those points which curiosity, or a desire of personal
information, had prompted me to investigate. I did not,
therefore, venture to flatter myself that I had collected
materials of sufficient importance on general topics to enable me
to write for the information of others. Since my return to
England, however, I have been strenuously urged to give a short
description of the colony before entering upon my personal
narrative; and I have conversed with so many individuals whose
ideas of Australia are totally at variance with its actual state,
that I am encouraged to indulge the hope that my observations,
desultory <!--page xi NAME OF AUSTRALIA. /page-->as they are, may be of some interest to the public. I
am strengthened in this hope by the consideration that some kind
friends have enabled me to add much valuable matter to that which
I had myself collected. It is not my intention, however, to enter
at any length on the commercial or agricultural interests of New
South Wales. It may be necessary for me to touch lightly on those
important subjects, but it is my wish to connect this preliminary
chapter, as much as possible with the subjects treated of in the
body of the work, and chiefly to notice the physical structure,
the soil, climate, and productions of the colony, in order to
convey to the reader general information on these points, before
I lead him into the remote interior. </p>

<p>It may be worthy of remark that the name
&ldquo;Australia,&rdquo; has of late years been affixed to
that extensive tract of land which Great Britain possesses in the
Southern Seas, and which, having been a discovery of the early
Dutch navigators, was previously termed &ldquo;New
Holland.&rdquo; The change of name was, I believe, introduced
by the celebrated French geographer, Malte Brun, who, in his
division of the globe, gave the appel<!--page xii IMPRESSIONS OF ITS EARLY VISITORS. /page-->lation of Austral Asia and
Polynesia to the new discovered lands in the southern ocean; in
which division he meant to include the numerous insular groups
scattered over the Pacific. </p>

<p>Australia is properly speaking an island, but it is so much
larger than every other island on the face of the globe, that it
is classed as a continent in order to convey to the mind a just
idea of its magnitude. Stretching from the 115th to the 153rd
degree of east longitude, and from the 10th to the 37th of south
latitude, it averages 2700 miles in length by 1800 in breadth;
and balanced, as it were, upon the tropic of that hemisphere in
which it is situated, it receives the fiery heat of the equator
at one extremity, while it enjoys the refreshing coolness of the
temperate zone at the other. On a first view we should be led to
expect that this extensive tract of land possessed more than
ordinary advantages; that its rivers would be in proportion to
its size; and that it would abound in the richest productions of
the inter-tropical and temperate regions. Such, indeed, was the
impression of those who first touched upon its southern shores,
but who remained no longer than to be dazzled by the splendour
and variety of its botanical productions, and to enjoy for a <!--page xiii CHARACTER OF AUSTRALIAN RIVERS. /page-->few
days the delightful mildness of its climate. But the very spot
which had appeared to Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks an
earthly paradise, was abandoned by the early settlers as unfit
for occupation; nor has the country generally been fount to
realize the sanguine expectations of those distinguished
individuals, so far as it has hitherto been explored. </p>

<p>Rivers which have the widest mouths or the most practicable
entrances, are, in Europe or America, usually of impetuous
current, or else contain such a body of water as to bear down all
opposition to their free course; whilst on the other hand, rivers
whose force is expended ere they reach the sea, have almost
invariably a bar at their embouchure, or where they mingle their
waters with those of the ocean. This last feature unfortunately
appears to characterise all rivers of Australia, or such of them
at least as are sufficiently known to us. Falling rapidly from
the mountains in which they originate into a level and extremely
depressed country; having weak and inconsiderable sources, and
being almost wholly unaided by tributaries of any kind; they
naturally fail before they reach the coast, and exhaust
themselves in marshes <!--page xiv FIRST VIEW OF PORT JACKSON. /page-->or lakes; or reach it so weakened as to be
unable to preserve clear or navigable months, or to remove the
sand banks that the tides throw up before them. On the other hand
the productions of this singular region seem to be peculiar to
it, and unlike those of any other part of the world; nor have any
indigenous fruits of any value as yet been found either in its
forests or on its plains. </p>

<p>He who has never looked on any other than the well-cultured
fields of England, can have little idea of a country that Nature
has covered with an interminable forest. Still less can he
estimate the feelings with which the adventurer approaches a
shore that has never (or perhaps only lately) been trodden by
civilized man. </p>

<p>It was with feelings peculiar to the occasion, that I gazed
for the first time on the bold cliffs at the entrance of Port
Jackson, as our vessel neared them, and speculated on the
probable character of the landscape they hid; and I am free to
confess, that I did not anticipate anything equal to the scene
which presented itself both to my sight and my judgment, as we
sailed up the noble and extensive basin we <!--page xv EXTENT OF NEW SOUTH WALES. /page-->had entered, towards
the seat of government. A single glance was sufficient to tell me
that the hills upon the southern shore of the port, the outlines
of which were broken by houses and spires, must once have been
covered with the same dense and gloomy wood which abounded every
where else. The contrast was indeed very great&mdash;the
improvement singularly striking. The labour and patience
required, and the difficulties which the first settlers
encountered effecting these improvements, must have been
incalculable. But their success has been complete: it is the very
triumph of human skill and industry over Nature herself. The
cornfield and the orchard have supplanted the wild grass and the
brush; a flourishing town stands over the ruins of the forest;
the lowing of herds has succeeded the wild whoop of the savage;
and the stillness of that once desert shore is now broken by the
sound of the bugle and the busy hum of commerce. </p>

<p>The Colony of New South Wales is situated upon the eastern
coast of Australia; and the districts within which land has been
granted to settlers, extends from the 36th parallel of latitude
to the 32nd, that is say, from the <!--page xvi DIVISIONS OF THE COLONY. /page-->Moroyo River to the south of
Sydney on the one hand, and to the Manning River on the other,
including Wellington Valley within its limits to the westward.
Thus it will appear that the boundaries of the located parts of
the colony have been considerably enlarged, and some fine
districts of country included within them. In consequence of its
extent and increasing population, it has been found convenient to
divide it into counties, parishes, and townships; and indeed,
every measure of the Colonial Government of late years, has had
for its object to assimilate its internal arrangements as nearly
as possible, to those of the mother country. Whether we are to
attribute the present flourishing state of the colony to the
beneficial influence of that system of government which has been
exercised over it for the last seven years it is not for me to
say. That the prosperity of a country depends, however, in a
great measure, on the wisdom of its legislature, is as undoubted,
as that within the period I have mentioned the colony of N. S.
Wales has risen unprecedentedly in importance and in wealth, and
has advanced to a state of im<!--page xvii ITS ADVANCES IN PROSPERITY. /page-->provement at which it could not have
arrived had its energies been cramped or its interests neglected.
</p>

<p>There is a period in the history of every country, during
which it will appear to have been more prosperous than at any
other. I allude not to the period of great martial achievements,
should any such adorn its pages, but to that in which the
enterprise of its merchants was roused into action, and when all
classes of its community seem to have put forth their strength
towards the attainment of wealth and power. </p>

<p>In this eventful period the colony of New South Wales is
already far advanced. The conduct of its merchants is marked by
the boldest speculations and the most gigantic projects. Their
storehouses are built on the most magnificent scale, and with the
best and most substantial materials. Few persons in England have
even a remote idea of its present flourishing condition, or of
the improvements that are daily taking place both in its commerce
and in its agriculture. I am aware that many object to it as a
place of residence, and I can easily enter into their feelings
from the recollec<!--page xviii ERRONEOUS IMPRESSIONS. /page-->tion of what my own were before I visited it. I
cannot but remark, however, that I found my prejudices had arisen
from a natural objection to the character of a part of its
population; from the circumstance of its being a penal colony,
and from my total ignorance of its actual state, and not from any
substantial or permanent cause. On the contrary I speedily became
convinced of the exaggerated nature of the reports I had heard in
England, on some of the points just adverted to; nor did any
thing fall under my observation during a residence in it of more
than six years to justify the opinion I had been previously led
to entertain of it. I embarked for New South Wales, with strong
prejudices against it: I left it with strong feelings in its
favour, and with a deep feeling of interest in its prosperity. It
is a pleasing task to me, therefore, to write of it thus, and to
have it in my power to contribute to the removal of any erroneous
impressions with regard to its condition at the present moment. </p>

<p>I have already remarked, that I was not prepared for the scene
that met my view when I first saw Sydney. The fact was, I had not
pictured to myself; nor conceived from any thing that I had <!--page xix COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE OF SYDNEY. /page-->ever
read or heard in England, that so extensive a town could have
been reared in that remote region, in so brief a period as that
which had elapsed since its foundation. It is not, however, a
distant or cursory glance that will give the observer a just idea
of the mercantile importance of this busy capital. In order to
form an accurate estimate of it, he should take a boat and
proceed from Sydney Cove to Darling Harbour. He would then be
satisfied, that it is not upon the first alone that Australian
commerce has raised its storehouse and wharfs, but that the whole
extent of the eastern shore of the last more capacious basin, is
equally crowded with warehouses, stores, dockyards, mills, and
wharfs, the appearance and solidity of which would do credit even
to Liverpool. Where, thirty years ago, the people flocked to the
beach to hail an arrival, it is not now unusual to see from
thirty to forty vessels riding at anchor at one time, collected
there from every quarter of the globe. In 1832, one hundred and
fifty vessels entered the harbour of Port Jackson, from foreign
parts, the amount of their tonnage being 31,259 tons. </p>

<p>The increasing importance of Sydney must <!--page xx STAPLE OF THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES. /page-->in some measure be
attributed to the flourishing condition of the colony itself, to
the industry of its farmers, to the successful enterprise of its
merchants, and to particular local causes. It is foreign to my
purpose, however, to enter largely into an investigation of these
important points. To do so would require more space than I can
afford for the purpose, and might justly be considered as
irrelevant in a work of this kind. Without attempting any
lengthened detail, it may be considered sufficient if I endeavour
merely to point out the principal causes of the present
prosperity (and, as they may very probably prove) of the eventual
progress of our great southern colony to power and independence. </p>

<p>The staple of our Australian colonies, but more particularly
of New South Wales, the climate and the soil of which are
peculiarly suited to its production,&mdash;is fine wool. There
can be no doubt that the growth of this article has mainly
contributed to the prosperity of the above mentioned colony and
of Van Diemen's Land. </p>

<p>At the close of the last century, wool was imported into
England from Spain and Germany only, and but a few years
previously from Spain <!--page xxi GROWTH OF FINE WOOL. /page-->alone. Indeed, long after its introduction
from the latter country, German wool, obtained but little
consideration in the London market; and in like manner, it may be
presumed that many years will not have elapsed before the
increased importation of wool from our own possessions in the
southern hemisphere, will render us, in respect to this
commodity, independent of every other part of the world. The
great improvements in modern navigation are such, that the
expense of sending the fleece to market from New South Wales is
less than from any part of Europe. The charges for instance on
Spanish and German wool, are from fourpence to fourpence three
farthings per pound; whereas the entire charge, after shipment
from New South Wales, and Van Diemen's Land, does not exceed
threepence three farthings,&mdash;and in this the dock and
landing charges, freight, insurance, brokerage, and commission,
are included. </p>

<p>As some particulars respecting the introduction of this source
of national wealth into Australia may prove interesting to the
public, I have put together the following details of it, upon the
authenticity of which they may rely. The person <!--page xxii MR. M'ARTHUR'S EXERTIONS /page-->who foresaw the
advantage to be derived from the growth of fine wool in New South
Wales, and who commenced the culture of it in that colony, was
Mr. John M'Arthur. So far back, I believe, as the year 1793, not
long after the establishment of the first settlement at Sydney,
this gentleman commenced sheep-farming, and about two years
afterwards he obtained a ram and two ewes from Captain Kent, of
the royal navy, who had brought them, with some other stock for
the supply of the settlement, from the Cape of Good Hope, to
which place a flock of these sheep had been originally sent by
the Dutch government. Sensible of the importance of the
acquisition, Mr. M'Arthur began to cross his coarse-fleeced sheep
with Merino blood; and, proceeding upon a system, he effected a
considerable improvement in the course of a few years. So
prolific was the mixed breed, that in ten years, a flock which
originally consisted of not more than seventy Bengal sheep, had
increased in number to 4,000 head, although the wethers had been
killed as they became fit for slaughter. It appears, however,
that as the sheep approached to greater purity of blood, their
extreme fecundity diminished. <!--page xxiii TO REAR MERINO FLOCKS. /page--> </p>

<p>In 1803, Mr. M'Arthur revisited England; and there happening
at the time to be a committee of manufacturers in London from the
clothing districts, he exhibited before them samples of his wool,
which were so much approved, that the committee represented to
their constituents the advantages which would result from the
growth of fine wool, in one of the southern dependencies of the
empire. In consequence of this a memorial was transmitted to His
Majesty's government, and Mr. M'Arthur's plans having been
investigated by a Privy Council, at which he was present, they
were recommended to the government as worthy of its protection.
With such encouragement Mr. M'Arthur purchased two ewes and three
rams, from the Merino flock of His Majesty King George the Third.
He embarked with them on his return to New South Wales in 1806,
on board a vessel named by him &ldquo;the Argo,&rdquo; in
reference to the golden treasure with which she was freighted. On
reaching the colony he removed his sheep to a grant of land which
the Home Government had directed he should receive in the Cow
Pastures. To commemorate the transaction, and to transmit to a <!--page xxiv EXPORT OF WOOL TO ENGLAND. /page-->grateful
posterity the recollection of the nobleman who then presided over
the colonies, the estate, together with the district in which it
is situated, was honoured by the name of Camden. </p>

<p>Since that time the value of New South Wales wool has been
constantly on the increase, and the colony are indebted to Mr.
M'Arthur for the possession of an exportable commodity which has
contributed very materially to its present wealth and importance.
Such general attention is now paid to this interesting branch of
rural economy, that the importation of wool into England from our
Australian colonies, amounted, in 1832, to 10,633 bales, or
2,500,000 lbs. It has been sold at as high a price as 10s. per
lb.; but the average price of wool of the best flocks vary from
1s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. at the present moment. The number of sheep in
New South Wales alone was calculated in the last census at
536,891 head. The ordinary profits on this kind of stock may be
extracted from the Table given in the Appendix to the first
volume of this work. </p>

<p>Among the various speculations undertaken by the merchants of
Sydney, there is not one into which they have entered with so
much <!--page xxv WHALE FISHERY. /page-->spirit as in the South Sea Fishery. The local situation of
Port Jackson gives them an advantage over the English and the
American merchants, since the distance of both these from the
field of their gains, must necessarily impede them greatly;
whereas the ships that leave Sydney on a whaling excursion,
arrive without loss of time upon their ground, and return either
for fresh supplies or to repair damages with equal facility. The
spirit with which the colonial youth have engaged in this
adventurous and hardy service, is highly to their credit. The
profits arising from it may not be (indeed I have every reason to
think are not) so great as might be supposed, or such as might
reasonably be expected; but the extensive scale on which it is
conducted, speaks equally for the energy and perseverance of the
parties concerned, in the prosecution of their commercial
enterprises. It has enabled them to equip a creditable colonial
marine, and given great importance to their mercantile interests
in the mother country. </p>

<p>In the year 1831, the quantity of sperm and black oil, the
produce of the fisheries exported from New South Wales, amounted
to 2,307 tons, <!--page xxvi OTHER EXPORTS. /page-->and was estimated, together with skins and
whalebone, to be worth 107,971<i>l.</i> sterling. The gross
amount of all other exports during that year, did not exceed
107,697<i>l.</i> sterling. Of these exports, the following were
the most considerable:</p>

<p>The above is exclusive of £61,000 value of British
manufactures re-exported to the various ports and islands in the
Southern Seas. </p>

<p>In this scale, moreover, tobacco is not mentioned; but that
plant is now raised for the supply of every private
establishment, and will assuredly form an article of export, as
soon as its manufacture shall be well understood. Neither can it
be doubted but that the vine and the olive will, in a short time,
be abundantly cultivated; and that a greater knowledge of the
climate and soil of the more northern parts of the colony, will <!--page xxvii GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES. /page-->lead
to the introduction of fresh sources of wealth. </p>

<p>Having taken this hasty review of the commercial interests of
the colony, we may now turn to a brief examination of its
internal structure and principal natural features. </p>

<p>I have already given a cursory sketch of the geographical
features of the whole continent. Of the vast area which its
coasts embrace, the east part alone has been fully explored. </p>

<p>A range of hills runs along the eastern coast, from north to
south, which, in different quarters, vary in their distance from
the sea; at one place approaching it pretty nearly, at another,
receding from it to a distance of forty miles. It is a singular
fact, that there is no pass or break in these mountains, by which
any of the rivers of the interior can escape in an easterly
direction. Their spine is unbroken. The consequence is, that
there is a complete division of the eastern and western waters,
and that streams, the heads of which are close to each other,
flow away in opposite directions; the one to pursue a short
course to the sea; the other to fall into a level and depressed
interior, the <!--page xxviii GREAT PROPORTION OF BAD SOIL. /page-->character of which will be noticed in its proper
place. </p>

<p>The proportion of bad soil to that which is good in New South
Wales, is certainly very great: I mean the proportion of inferior
soil to such as is fit for the higher purposes of agriculture.
Mr. Dawson, the late superintendent of the Australian
Agricultural Company's possessions, has observed, as a singular
fact, that the best soil generally prevails on the summits of the
hills, more especially where they are at all level. He accounts
for so unusual a circumstance by the fact, that elevated
positions are less subject to the effects of fire or floods than
their valleys or flanks, and attributes the general want of
vegetable mould over the colony chiefly to the ravages of the
former element, whereby the growth of underwood, so favourable in
other countries to the formation of soil, is wholly prevented.
Undoubtedly this is a principal cause for the deficiency in
question. There is no part of the world in which fires create
such havoc as in New South Wales and indeed in Australia
generally. The climate, on the one hand, which dries up
vegetation, and <!--page xxix CAUSE OF THIS. /page-->the wandering habits of the natives on the other,
which induce them to clear the country before them by
conflagration, operate equally against the growth of timber and
underwood. </p>

<p>But there is another circumstance that appears to have escaped
Mr. Dawson's observation; which is the actual property of the
trees themselves, as to the quantity of vegetable matter they
produce in decay. Being a military man, I cannot be supposed to
have devoted much of my time to agricultural pursuits; but it has
been obvious to me, as it must have been to many others, that in
New South Wales, the fall of leaves and the decay of timber, so
far from adding to the richness of its soil, actually destroy
minor vegetation. This fact was brought more home to me in
consequence of its having been my lot to spend some months upon
Norfolk Island, a distant penal settlement attached to the
Government of Sydney. There the abundance of vegetable decay was
as remarkable as the want of it on the Australian Continent. I
have frequently sunk up to my knees in a bed of leaves when
walking through its woods; and, <!--page xxx CONNECTION BETWEEN THE /page-->often when I placed my foot on
what appeared externally to be the solid trunk of a tree, I have
found it yield to the pressure, in consequence of its
decomposition into absolute rottenness. But such is not the case
in New South Wales. There, no such accumulations of vegetable
matter are to be met with; but where the loftiest tree of the
forest falls to the ground, its figure and length are marked out
by the total want of vegetation within a certain distance of it,
and a small elevation of earth, resembling more the refuse or
scoria of burnt bricks than any thing else, is all that
ultimately remains of the immense body which time or accident had
prostrated. Thus it would appear, that it is not less to the
character of its woods than to the ravages of fire that New South
Wales owes its general sterility. </p>

<p>Whilst prosecuting my researches in the interior of the
colony, I could not but be struck with the apparent connection
between its geology and vegetation; so strong, indeed, was this
connection, that I had little difficulty, after a short
experience, in judging of the rock that formed the basis of the
country over which I <!--page xxxi GEOLOGY AND VEGETATION. /page-->was travelling, from the kind of tree or
herbage that flourished in the soil above it. The eucalyptus
pulv., a species of eucalyptus having a glaucus-coloured leaf, of
dwarfish habits and growing mostly in scrub, betrayed the
sandstone formation, wherever it existed, This was the case in
many parts of the County of Cumberland, in some parts of Wombat
Brush, at the two passes on the great south road, over a great
extent of country to the N.W. of Yass Plains, and at Blackheath
on the summit of the Blue Mountains. On the other hand, those
open grassy and park-like tracts, of which so much has been said,
characterise the secondary ranges of granite and porphyry. The
trees most usual on these tracts, were the box, an unnamed
species of eucalyptus, and the grass chiefly of that kind, called
the oat or forest grass, which grows in tufts at considerable
distances from each other, and which generally affords good
pasturage. On the richer grounds the angophora lanceolata, and
the eucalyptus mammifera more frequently point out the quality of
the soil on which they grow. The first are abundant on the
alluvial flats of the Nepean, the <!--page xxxii CONNECTION BETWEEN THE /page-->Hawkesbury and the Hunter; the
latter on the limestone formation of Wellington Valley and in the
better portions of Argyle; whilst the cupressus calytris seems to
occupy sandy ridges with the casuarina. It was impossible that
these broad features should have escaped observation: it was
naturally inferred from this, that the trees of New South Wales
are gregarious; and in fact they may, in a great measure, be
considered so. The strong line that occasionally separates
different species, and the sudden manner in which several species
are lost at one point, to re-appear at another more distant,
without any visible cause for the break that has taken place,
will furnish a number of interesting facts in the botany of New
South Wales. </p>

<p>It was observed both on the Macquarie river and the
Morumbidgee, that the casuarinae ceased at a particular point. On
the Macquarie particularly, these trees which had often excited
our admiration from Wellington Valley downwards, ceased to occupy
its banks below the cataract, nor were they again noticed until
we arrived on the banks of the Castlereagh. The blue-gum trees,
again, were never observed to <!--page xxxiii GEOLOGY AND VEGETATION. /page-->extend beyond the secondary
embankments of the rivers, occupying that ground alone which was
subject to flood and covered with reeds. These trees waved over
the marshes of the Macquarie, but were not observed to the
westward of them for many miles; yet they re-appeared upon the
banks of New-Year's Creek as suddenly as they had disappeared
after we left the marshes, and grew along the line of the Darling
to unusual size. But it is remarkable, that, even in the midst of
the marshes, the blue-gum trees were strictly confined to the
immediate flooded spaces on which the reeds prevailed, or to the
very beds of the water-courses. Where the ground was elevated, or
out of the reach of flood, the box (unnamed) alone occupied it;
and, though the branches of these trees might be interwoven
together, the one never left its wet and reedy bed, the other
never descended from its more elevated position. The same
singular distinction marked the acacia pendula, when it ceased to
cover the interior plains of light earth, and was succeeded by
another shrub of the same species. It continued to the banks of
New-Year's Creek, a part of which it thickly lined. <!--page xxxiv GEOLOGICAL FEATURES. /page-->To the
westward of the creek, another species of acacia was remarked for
the first time. Both shrubs, like the blue-gum and the box, mixed
their branches together, but the creek formed the line of
separation between them. The acacia pendula was not afterwards
seen, but that which had taken its place, as it were, was found
to cover large tracts of country and to form extensive brushes.
Many other peculiarities in the vegetation of the interior are
noticed in the body of this work, but I have thought that these
more striking ones deserved to be particularly remarked upon. </p>

<p>If we strike a line to the N.W. from Sydney to Wellington
Valley, we shall find that little change takes place in the
geological features of the country. The sand-stone of which the
first of the barrier ranges is composed, terminates a little
beyond Mount York, and at Cox's River is succeeded by grey
granite. The secondary ranges to the N.W. of Bathurst, are wholly
of that primitive rock; for although there are partial changes of
strata between Bathurst and <!--page xxxv GEOLOGICAL FEATURES. /page-->Moulong Plains, granite is
undoubtedly the rock upon which the whole are based: but at
Moulong Plains, a military station intermediate between Bathurst
and Wellington Valley, limestone appears in the bed of a small
clear stream, and with little interruption continues to some
distance below the last-mentioned place. The accidental discovery
of some caves at Moulong Plains, led to the more critical
examination of the whole formation, and cavities of considerable
size were subsequently found in various parts of it, but more
particularly in the neighbourhood of Wellington Valley. The local
interest which has of late years been taken in the prosecution of
geological investigations, led many gentlemen to examine the
contents of these caverns; and among the most forward, Major
Mitchell, the Surveyor-General, must justly be considered, to
whose indefatigable perseverance the scientific world is already
so much indebted. </p>

<p>The caves into which I penetrated, did not present anything
particular to my observation; they differed little from caves of
a similar description into which I had penetrated in Europe.
Large masses of stalactites hung from their roofs, and a
corresponding formation encrusted their <!--page xxxvi GEOLOGICAL FEATURES. /page-->floors. They comprised
various chambers or compartments, the most remote of which
terminated at a deep chasm that was full of water. A close
examination of these caves has led to the discovery of some
organic remains, bones of various animals embedded in a light red
soil; but I am not aware that the remains of any extinct species
have been found, or that any fossils have been met with in the
limestone itself. There can, however, be little doubt but that
the same causes operated in depositing these mouldering remains
in the caves of Kirkdale and those of Wellington Valley. </p>

<p>About twenty miles below the junction of the Bell with the
Macquarie, free-stone supersedes the limestone, but as the
country falls rapidly from that point, it soon disappears, and
the traveller enters upon a flat country of successive terraces.
A schorl rock, of a blue colour and fine grain, composed of
tourmaline and quartz, forms the bed of the Macquarie at the
Cataract; and, in immediate contact with it, a mass of mica slate
of alternate rose, pink, and white, was observed, which must have
been covered by the waters of the river when Mr. Oxley descended
it. <!--page xxxvii GEOLOGICAL FEATURES. /page--> </p>

<p>From the Cataract of the Macquarie, a flat extends to the
marshes in which that river exhausts itself. From the midst of
this flat Mount Foster and Mount Harris rise, both of which are
porphyritic: but as I have been particular in describing these
heights in their proper place, any minute notice of them here may
be considered unnecessary. We will rather extend our enquiries to
those parts of the colony upon which we shall not be called upon
to remark in the succeeding pages. </p>

<p>Returning to the coast, we may mark the geological changes in
a line to the S.W. of Sydney; and as my object is to extend the
information of my readers, I shall notice any particular district
on either side of the line I propose to touch upon, which may be
worthy of notice. It would appear that the first decided break in
the sandstone formation which penetrates into the county of
Camden, is at Mittagong Range. It is there traversed by a dike of
whinstone, of which that range is wholly composed. The change of
soil and of vegetation are equally remarkable at this place; the
one being a rich, greasy, chocolate-coloured earth, the other
partaking greatly of <!--page xxxviii GEOLOGICAL FEATURES. /page-->the intertropical character. In wandering
over them, I noticed the wild fig and the cherry-tree, growing to
a much larger size than I had seen them in any other part of the
colony. Upon their branches, the satin bird, the gangan, and
various kinds of pigeons were feeding. Birds unknown to the
eastward of the Blue Mountains, were numerous in the valleys; and
there was an unusual appearance of freshness and moisture in the
vegetation. </p>

<p>These signs of improvement, however, vanish the moment
Mittagong range is crossed, and sand-stone again forms the basis
of the country to a considerable distance beyond Bong-bong. At a
small farm called the Ploughed Ground, it is again traversed by a
dike of whinstone, and a rich but isolated spot is thus passed
over. With occasional and partial interruption, however, the
sand-stone formation continues to an abrupt pass, from which the
traveller descends to the county of Argyle. This pass is
extremely abrupt, and is covered with glaucus, the low scrub I
have noticed as common to the sand-stone formation. A small but
lively stream, called Paddy's River, runs at the bottom of this
pass, <!--page xxxix GEOLOGICAL FEATURES. /page-->and immediately to the S.W. of it, an open forest country
of granite base extends for many miles, on which the eucalyptus
manifera is prevalent, and which affords the best grazing tracts
in Argyle. At Goulburn Plains, however, a vein of limestone
occurs, which is evidently connected with that forming the
ShoalHaven Gully, which is perhaps the most remarkable geological
feature in the colony of New South Wales. It is a deep chasm of
about a quarter of a mile in breadth, and 1200 feet in depth. The
country on either side is perfectly level, so much so that the
traveller approaches almost to its very brink before he is aware
of his being near so singular an abyss. A small rivulet flows
through the Gully, and discharges itself into the sea at
ShoalHaven; but this river is hardly perceptible, from the summit
of the cliffs forming the sides of the Gully, which are of the
boldest and most precipitous character. The ground on the summit
is full of caves of great depth, but there has been a difficulty
in examining them, in consequence of the violent wind that rushes
up them, and extinguishes every torch. </p>

<p>The open and grassy forests of Argyle are ter<!--page xl GEOLOGICAL FEATURES. /page-->minated by
another of those abrupt sand-stone passes I have just described,
and the traveller again falls considerably from his former level,
previously to his entering on Yass Plains, to which this pass is
the only inlet. </p>

<p>From Yass Plains the view to the S. and S.W. is over a lofty
and broken country: mountains with rounded summits, others with
towering peaks, and others again of lengthened form but sharp
spine, characterise the various rocks of which they are composed.
The ranges decline rapidly from east to west, and while on the
one hand the country has all the appearance of increasing height,
on the other it sinks to a dead level; nor on the distant horizon
to the N. W. is there a hill or an inequality to be seen. </p>

<p>From Yass Plains to the very commencement of the level
interior, every range I crossed presented a new rock-formation;
serpentine quartz in huge white masses, granite, chlorite,
micaceous schist, sandstone, chalcedony, quartz, and red jasper,
and conglomerate rocks. </p>

<p>It was however, out of my power, in so hurried a journey as
that which I performed down the <!--page xli GEOLOGICAL FEATURES. /page-->banks of the Morumbidgee River,
to examine with the accuracy I could have wished, either the
immediate connection between these rocks or their gradual change
from the one to the other. I was content to ascertain their
actual succession, and to note the general outlines of the
ranges; but the defect of vision under which I labour, prevents
me from laying them before the public. </p>

<p>From what has been advanced, however, it will appear that the
physical structure of the southern parts of the colony is as
varied, as that of the western interior is monotonous, and we may
now pursue our original observations on the soil of the colony
with greater confidence. </p>

<p>In endeavouring to account for the poverty of the soil in New
South Wales, and in attributing it in a great degree to the
causes already mentioned, it appears necessary to estimate more
specifically the influence which the geological formation of a
country exercises on its soil, and how much the quality of the
latter partakes of the character of the rock on which it reposes.
And although I find it extremely <!--page xlii CHARACTER OF THE SOIL /page-->difficult to explain myself as I
should wish to do, in the critical discussion on which I have
thus entered, yet as it is material to the elucidation of an
important subject in the body of the work, I feel it incumbent on
me to proceed to the best of my ability. </p>

<p>I have said that the soil of a country depends much upon its
geological formation. This appears to be particularly the case in
those parts of the colony with which I am acquainted, or those
lying between the parallels of 30° and 35° south. Sandstone,
porphyry, and granite, succeed each other from the coast to a
very considerable distance into the interior, on a N. W. line.
The light ferruginous dust that is distributed over the county of
Cumberland, and which annoys the traveller by its extreme
minuteness, to the eastward of the Blue Mountains, is as
different from the coarse gravelly soil on the secondary ranges
to the westward of them, as the barren scrubs and thickly-wooded
tracts of the former district are to the grassy and open forests
of the latter. </p>

<p>As soon as I began to descend to the westward it became
necessary to pay strict and <!--page xliii CONNECTED WITH GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. /page-->earnest attention to the features of
the country through which I passed, in order to determine more
accurately the different appearances which, as I was led to
expect, the rivers would assume. In the course of my examination
I found, first, that the broken country through which I
travelled, was generally covered with a loose, coarse, and sandy
soil; and, secondly, that the ranges were wholly deficient in
that peat formation which fills the valleys, or covers the flat
summits of the hills or mountains, in the northern hemisphere.
The peculiar property of this formation is to retain water like a
sponge; and to this property the regular and constant flow of the
rivers descending from such hills, may, in a great measure, be
attributed. In New South Wales on the contrary, the rains that
fall upon the mountains drain rapidly through a coarse and
superficial soil, and pour down their sides without a moment's
interruption. The consequence is that on such occasions the
rivers are subject to great and sudden rises, whereas they have
scarcely water enough to support a current in ordinary seasons.
At one time the traveller will find it impracticable to cross
them: at another he may do so with ease; and <!--page xliv CHARACTER OF THE SOIL /page-->only from the
remains of debris in the branches of the trees high above, can he
judge of the furious torrent they must occasionally contain. </p>

<p>This seeming deviation on the part of Nature from her usual
laws will no longer appear such, if we consider its results for a
moment. The very floods which swell the rivers to overflowing,
are followed by the most beneficent effects; and, rude and
violent as the means are by which she accomplishes her purpose,
they form, no doubt, a part of that process by which she
preserves the balance of good and evil. Vast quantities of the
best soil have been thus washed down from the mountains to
accumulate in more accessible places. From frequent depositions,
a great extent of country along the banks of every river and
creek has risen high above the influence of the floods, and
constitutes the richest tracts in the colony. The alluvial flats
of the Nepean, the Hawkesbury, and the Hunter, are striking
instances of the truth of these observations; to which the plains
of O'Connell and Bathurst must be added. The only good soil upon
the two latter, is in the immediate neighbourhood of the
Macquarie River: but, even close to its banks, <!--page xlv CONNECTED WITH GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. /page-->the depositions
are of little depth, lying on a coarse gravelly soil, the
decomposition of the nearer ranges. The former is found to
diminish in thickness, according to the concavity of the valley
through which the Macquarie flows, and at length becomes mixed
with the coarser soil. This deposit is alone fit for agricultural
purposes; but it does not necessarily follow that the distant
country is unavailable since it is admitted, that the best
grazing tracts are upon the secondary ranges of granite and
porphyry. These ranges generally have the appearance of open
forest, and are covered with several kinds of grasses, among
which the long oat-grass is the most abundant. </p>

<p>If we except the valley of the Nepean, the banks of the South
Creek, the Pennant Hills near Parramatta, and a few other places,
the general soil of the county of Cumberland, is of the poorest
description. It is superficial in most places, resting either
upon a cold clay, or upon sandstone; and is, as I have already
remarked, a ferruginous compound of the finest dust. Yet there
are many places upon its surface, (hollows for instance,) in
which vegetable decay has ac<!--page xlvi COUNTY OF CUMBERLAND. /page-->cumulated, or valleys, into which it
has been washed, that are well adapted for the usual purposes of
agriculture, and would, if the country was more generally
cleared, be found to exist to a much greater extent than is at
present imagined. I have frequently observed the isolated patches
of better land, when wandering through the woods, both on the
Parramatta River, and at a greater distance from the coast. And I
cannot but think, that it would be highly advantageous to those
who possess large properties in the County of Cumberland to let
Portions of them. The concentration of people round their
capital, promotes more than anything else the prosperity of a
colony, by creating a reciprocal demand for the produce both of
the country and the town, since the one would necessarily
stimulate the energy of the farmer, as the other would rouse the
enterprise of the merchant. The consideration, however, of such a
subject is foreign to my present purpose. </p>

<p>It must not be supposed, that because I have given a somewhat
particular description of the County of Cumberland, I have done
so with a view to bring it forward as a specimen of the <!--page xlvii COUNTRY WEST OF BLUE MOUNTAINS. /page-->other
counties, or to found upon it a general description of the
colony. It is, in fact, poorer in every respect than any tract of
land of similar extent in the interior, and is still covered with
dense forests of heavy timber, excepting when the trees have been
felled by dint of manual labour, and the ground cleared at an
expense that nothing but its proximity to the seat of government
could have justified. But experience has proved, that neither the
labour nor the the expense have been thrown away. Many valuable
farms and extensive gardens chequer the face of the country, from
which the proprietors derive a very efficient income. </p>

<p>To the westward of the Blue Mountains, the country differs in
many respects from that lying between those ranges and the coast;
and although, its aspect varies in different places, three
principal features appear more immediately to characterise it.
These are, first, plains of considerable extent wholly destitute
of timber; secondly, open undulating woodlands; and, thirdly,
barren unprofitable tracts. The first almost invariably occur in
the immediate neighbourhood of some river, as the Plains <!--page xlviii MEANS OF INLAND TRANSPORT. /page-->of
Bathurst, which are divided by the Macquarie; Goulburn Plains,
through which the Wallandilly flows; and Yass Plains, which are
watered by a river of the same name. The open forests, through
which the horseman may gallop in perfect safety, seem to prevail
over the whole secondary ranges of granite, and are generally
considered as excellent grazing tracts. Such is the country in
Argyleshire on either side of the Lachlan, where that river
crosses the great southern road near Mr. Hume's station; such
also are many parts of Goulburn and the whole extent of country
lying between Underaliga and the Morumbidgee River. The barren
tracts, on the other hand, may be said to occupy the central
spaces between all the principal streams. With regard to the
proportion that these different kinds of country bear to each
other, there can be no doubt of the undue preponderance of the
last over the first two; but there are nevertheless many
extensive available tracts in every part of the colony. </p>

<p>The greatest disadvantage under which New South Wales labours,
is the want of means for conveying inland produce to the market,
or to the <!--page xlix DISADVANTAGES OF DISTANT SETTLERS. /page-->coast. The Blue Mountains are in this respect a serious
bar to the internal prosperity of the colony. By this time,
however, a magnificent road will have been completed across them
to the westward, over parts of which I travelled in 1831. Indeed
the efforts of the colonial government have been wisely directed,
not only to the construction of this road, which the late
Governor, General Darling commenced, but also in facilitating the
communication to the southern districts, by an almost equally
fine road over the Razor Back Range, near the Cow Pastures; so
that as far as it is possible for human efforts to overcome
natural obstacles, the wisdom and foresight of the executive have
ere this been successful. </p>

<p>The majority of the settlers in the Bathurst country, and in
the more remote interior, are woolgrowers; and as they send their
produce to the market only once a year, receiving supplies for
home consumption, on the return of their drays or carts from
thence, the inconvenience of bad roads is not so much felt by
them. But to an agriculturist a residence to the westward of the
Blue Mountains is decidedly objectionable, unless he possess the
means with which to pro<!--page l DISADVANTAGES OF DISTANT SETTLERS. /page-->cure the more immediate necessaries of
life, otherwise than by the sale of his grain or other produce,
and can be satisfied to cultivate his property for home
consumption, or for the casual wants of his neighbours. Under
such circumstances, a man with a small private income would enjoy
every rational comfort. But of course, not only in consequence of
the loss of labour, but the chance of accidents during a long
journey, the more the distance is increased from Sydney, as the
only place at which the absolute necessaries of life can be
purchased, the greater becomes the objection to a residence in
such a part of the country; and on this account it is, that
although some beautiful locations both as to extent and richness,
are to be found to the westward of Bathurst, equally on the Bell,
the Macquarie and the Lachlan, it is not probable they will be
taken up for many years, or will only be occupied as distant
stock stations. </p>

<p>Since, therefore, it appears from what has been advanced, that
it is not to the westward the views of any settlers should be
directed, excepting under particular circumstances, it remains
for us to consider what other parts of the colony <!--page li CHARACTER OF EASTERN COAST. /page-->hold out, or
appear to hold out, greater advantages. The eye naturally turns
to the south on the one hand, and to Port Macquarie northerly on
the other. It is to be remarked that the eastern shores of
Australia partake of the same barren character that marks the
other three. it is generally bounded to a certain extent by a
sandy and sterile tract. There are, however, breaks in so
prolonged a line, as might have been expected, where, from
particular local causes, both the soil and vegetation are of a
superior kind. At Illawarra for instance, the contiguity of the
mountains to the coast leaves no room for the sandy belt we have
noticed, but the debris from them reaches to the very shore.
Whether from reflected heat, or from some other peculiarity of
situation, the vegetation of Illawarra is of an intertropical
character, and birds that are strangers to the county of
Cumberland frequent its thickets. There is no part of Australia
where the feathered race are more beautiful, or more diversified.
The most splendid pigeon, perhaps, that the world produces, and
the satin bird, with its lovely eye, feed there upon the berries
of the ficus (wild fig,) and other trees: and a <!--page lii PORT MACQUARIE AND FIVE ISLANDS. /page-->numerous tribe of
the accipitrine class soar over its dense and spacious forests. </p>

<p>We again see a break in the sandy line of the coast at Broken
Bay, at Newcastle, and still further north at Port Macquarie; at
which places the Hawkesbury, the Hunter, and the Hastings
severally debouche. Of Port Macquarie, as a place of settlement,
I entertain a very high opinion, in consequence of its being
situated under a most favourable parallel latitude. I am
convinced it holds out many substantial advantages. One of the
most important of these is the circumstance of its having been
much improved when occupied as a penal settlement. And since the
shores of the colony are how navigated by steam-boats, the
facility of water communication would be proportionably great. </p>

<p>I believe the Five Islands or Illawarr district is considered
peculiarly eligible for small settlers. The great drawback to
this place is the heavy character of its timber and the closeness
of its thickets, which vie almost with the American woods in
those respects. The return, however, is adequate to the labour
required in clearing the ground. Between the Five Islands and <!--page liii RICH TRACTS IN THE INTERIOR. /page-->Sydney,
a constant intercourse is kept up by numerous small craft; and a
communication with the interior, by branch roads from the great
southern line to the coast, would necessarily be thrown open, if
the more distant parts of it were sufficiently peopled. </p>

<p>Recent surveys have discovered to us rich and extensive tracts
in the remote interior between Jervis Bay and Bateman's Bay, and
southwards upon the western slope of the dividing range. The
account given by Messrs. Hovel and Hume is sufficient to prove
that every valley they crossed was worthy of notice, and that the
several rivers they forded were flanked by rich and extensive
flats. </p>

<p>The distance of Moneroo Plains, and of the Doomot and
Morumbidgee Rivers from Sydney, alarms the settler, who knows not
the value of those localities; but men whose experience has
taught them to set this obstacle at nought, have long depastured
their herds on the banks of the last two. The fattest cattle that
supply the Sydney market are fed upon the rich flats, and in the
grassy valleys of the Morumbidgee; and there are several
beautiful farms upon those of <!--page liv PERIODICAL DROUGHTS. /page-->the Doomot. Generally speaking, the
persons who reside in those distant parts, pay little attention
to the comfort of their dwellings, or to the raising of more
grain than their establishments may require; but there can be no
doubt this part of the interior ought to be the granary of New
South Wales; its climate and greater humidity being more
favourable than that of Sydney for the production of wheat. </p>

<p>The most serious disadvantages under which the colony of New
South Wales labours, is in the drought to which it is
periodically subject. Its climate may be said to be too dry; in
other respects it is one of the most delightful under heaven; and
experience of the certainty of the recurrence of the trying
seasons to which I allude, should teach men to provide against
their effects. Those seasons, during which no rain falls, appear,
from the observations of former writers, to occur every ten or
twelve years; and it is somewhat singular that no cause has been
assigned for such periodical visitations. Whether the state of
the interior has anything to do with them, and whether the wet or
dry condition of the marshes at all regulate the seasons, is a
ques<!--page lv THE SEASONS AFFECTED BY THE MARSHES. /page-->tion upon which I will not venture to give my decisive
opinion. But most assuredly, when the interior is dry, the
seasons are dry, and <i>vice versa</i>. Indeed, not only is this
the case, but rains, from excessive duration in the first year
after a drought, decrease gradually year after year, until they
wholly cease for a time. It seems not improbable, therefore, that
the state of the interior does, in some measure, regulate the
fall of rain upon the eastern ranges, which appears to decrease
in quantity yearly as the marshes become exhausted, and cease
altogether, when they no longer contain any water. A drought will
naturally follow until such time as the air becomes surcharged
with clouds or vapour from the ocean, which being no longer able
to sustain their own weight, descend upon the mountains, and
being conveyed by hundreds of streams into the western lowlands,
again fill the marshes, and cause the recurrence of regular
seasons. </p>

<p>The thermometer ranges during the summer months, that is, from
September to March, from 36° to 106° of Fahrenheit, but the
mean of the temperature during the above period is 70°. <!--page lvi TEMPERATURE OF THE CLIMATE. /page-->The
instrument in the winter months ranges from 27° to 98°, with a
mean of 66°. However great the summer heat may appear, it is
certain that the climate of New South Wales has not the relaxing
and enfeebling effect upon the constitution, which renders a
residence in India or other parts of the south so intolerable.
Neither are any of the ordinary occupations of business or of
pleasure laid aside at noon, or during the hottest part of the
day. The traveller may cast himself at length under the first
tree that invites him, and repose there as safely as if he were
in a palace. Fearless of damps, and unmolested by noxious
insects, his sleep is as sound as it is refreshing, and he rises
with renewed spirits to pursue his journey. Equally so may the
ploughman or the labourer seek repose beside his team, and allow
them to graze quietly around him. The delicious coolness of the
morning and the mild temperature of the evening air, in that
luxurious climate, are beyond the power of description. It
appears to have an influence on the very animals, the horses and
the cattle being particularly docile; and I cannot but think it
is is some degree the same <!--page lvii FRUITS. /page-->happy effect upon some of the hardened
human beings who are sent thither from the old world. </p>

<p>As I have before observed, it has not yet been discovered
whether there are any indigenous fruits of any value in
Australia. In the colony of New South Wales there certainly are
none; yet the climate is peculiarly adapted for the growth of
every European and of many tropical productions. The orange, the
fig, the citron, the pomegranate, the peach, the apple, the
guava, the nectarine, the pear, and the loquette, grow side by
side together. The plantain throws its broad leaves over the
water, the vine encircles the cottages, and the market of Sydney
is abundantly supplied with every culinary vegetable. </p>

<p>In a climate, therefore, so soft that man scarcely requires a
dwelling, and so enchanting that few have left it but with
regret, the spirits must necessarily be acted upon,&mdash;and
the heart feel lighter. Such, indeed, I have myself found to be
the case; nor have I ever been happier than when roving through
the woods or wandering along one of the silent and beautiful bays
for which the harbour of Port Jackson is so celebrated. I went to
New South Wales as I have already remarked, highly prejudiced <!--page lviii REMARKS ON EMIGRATION. /page-->against
it, both from the nature of the service, and the character of the
great body of its inhabitants. My regiment has since quitted its
shores, but I am aware there are few of them who would not gladly
return. The feeling I have in its favour arises not, therefore,
from the services in which I was employed, but from circumstances
in the colony itself; and I yet hope to form one of its community
and to join a number of valuable and warm-hearted friends whom I
left in that distant part of the world. </p>

<p>On the subject of emigration, it is not my intention to dwell
at any length. My object in these preliminary remarks has been to
give the reader a general idea of the country, in the interior
recesses of which I am about to lead him. Still, however, it may
be useful to offer a few general observations on a topic which
has, of late years, become so interesting to the British public. </p>

<p>The main consideration with those who, possessing some
capital, propose to emigrate as the means of improving their
condition, is, the society likely to be found in the land fixed
on for their future residence. One of the first questions I have
been asked, when conversing on <!--page lix REMARKS ON EMIGRATION. /page-->the subject of emigration, has
consequently related to this important matter. I had only then to
observe in reply, that the civil and military establishments in
New South Wales, form the elements of as good society as it is
the lot of the majority to command in Great Britain. </p>

<p>The houses of the settlers are not scattered over a greater
surface than the residences of country gentlemen here, and if
they cannot vie with them in size, they most assuredly do in many
other more important respects; and if a substantial cottage of
brick or stone has any claim to the rank of a tenantable mansion,
there are few of them which do not posses all the means of
exercising that hospitality for which young communities are
remarkable. </p>

<p>But to sever the links of kindred, and to abandon the homes of
our fathers after years of happy tranquillity, is a sacrifice the
magnitude of which is unquestionable. The feelings by which men
are influenced under such circumstances have a claim to our
respect. Indeed, no class of persons can have a stronger hold
upon our sympathies than those whom unmerited adverse fortune
obliges to seek a home in a distant country. <!--page lx DESCRIPTION OF IMMIGRANTS /page--> </p>

<p>Far, therefore, be it from me to dispute a single expression
of regret to which they may give utterance. It must, however, he
remembered that the deepest feelings of anguish are
providentially alleviated in time. Our heaviest misfortunes are
frequently repaired by industry and caution. The sky clears up,
as it were: new interests engage the attention, and the cares of
a family or the improvement of a newly acquired property engross
those moments which would otherwise be spent in vain and
unprofitable regrets. </p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that persons such as I have described,
whose conduct has hitherto been regulated by prudence, and whose
main object is to provide for their children, are the most
valuable members of every community, whether young or old. To
such men few countries hold out greater prospects of success than
New South Wales; for the more we extend our enquiries, the more
we shall find that the success of the emigrant in that colony
depends upon his prudence and foresight rather than on any
collateral circumstance of climate or soil; and to him who can be
satisfied with the gradual acquirement of competency, it is the
land of promise. Blessed with a climate of unparalleled serenity,
and of <!--page lxi MOST LIKELY TO PROSPER. /page-->unusual freedom from disease, the settler has little
external cause of anxiety, little apprehension of sickness among
his family or domestics, and little else to do than to attend to
his own immediate interests. I should wish to illustrate the
observations by two or three instances of their practical bearing
and tendency. </p>

<p>It was on my return from my second expedition, that I visited
Lieut. ****** who resides in the southern parts of the colony.
The day after my arrival, he took me round his property, and
explained the various improvements he had made, considering the
small means with which he had commenced. At this part of our
conversation, we came within view of his house, a substantial
weather-board cottage. &ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; said I,
turning to him, &ldquo;you will excuse the question I am about
to ask; for your frankness emboldens me to propose it, and on
your answer much of the effect of what you have been saying will
depend. In effecting these various improvements, and in the
building of that house, have you been obliged to embarrass
yourself, or are they free from
incumbrance?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Your
question,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a reasonable one, and I
will answer it with the frankness you are kind <!--page lxii CASES OF EMIGRANTS. /page-->enough to ascribe
to me. I have ever made it a rule not to exceed my income. Mrs.
****** bore our first trials with so much cheerfulness, and
contributed so much to my happiness and my prosperity, that I
felt myself bound to build her a good house with the first money
I had to spare.&rdquo; I confess this answer raised my host in
my estimation, and it was a gratifying proof to me of the success
that attends industry and perseverance. </p>

<p>But let us look at another case. Mr. *** had a property to the
N.W. of Sydney, and having considerable funded means when he
arrived in the colony, he soon put his property into a state of
progressive improvement, and being in truth an excellent
practical farmer, it assumed the appearance of regularity and
order. Had Mr. *** stopped at this moment, he would have been in
the enjoyment of affluence and of every rational comfort. But
instead of exercising prudent rules of hospitality, he gave way
to the natural generosity of his disposition, entered into
expenses he could not afford, and was ultimately obliged to part
with his estate. Now it is deeply to be regretted, that one whose
energies and abilities particularly fitted him for the life he
had chosen, should have <!--page lxiii CAUSES OF SUCCESS OR FAILURE. /page-->failed through such conduct; and it is
more than probable, that if he had commenced with smaller means,
and had gradually improved his property, his fate would have been
very different. </p>

<p>I shall leave these cases without any further comment,
convinced as I am, that each of them furnishes matter for serious
consideration, and that they are practical illustrations of the
causes of success or failure of those who emigrate to the colony
of New South Wales. And although I do not mean to affirm, that
the majority follow Mr. ***'s example, I must venture to assert
that thoughtlessness&mdash;useless expenditure in the first
instance&mdash;waste of time and other circumstances, lead to
equally ruinous consequences. </p>

<p>One of the greatest objections which families have to New
South Wales, is their apprehension of the moral effects that are
likely to overwhelm them by bad example, and for which no success
in life could compensate. In a colony constituted like that of
New South Wales, the proportion of crime must of course be great.
Yet it falls less under the notice of private families than one
might at first sight have been led to suppose. Drunkenness, as in
the mother <!--page lxiv MORAL OBJECTIONS TO THE COLONY. /page-->country, is the besetting sin; but it is confined
chiefly to the large towns in consequence of the difficulty of
procuring spirits in the country. There are, no doubt, many
incorrigible characters sent to settle in the interior, and it is
an evil to have these men, even for a single day, to break the
harmony of a previously well regulated establishment, or to
injure its future prospects by the influence of evil example.
They are men who are sent upon trial, from on board a newly
arrived ship, and they generally terminate their misconduct
either on the roads or at a penal settlement, being thus happily
removed from the mass of the prisoners. Frequently, however, men
remain for years under the same master. They become attached to
their occupations, their hearts become softened by kindness, and
they atone as much as they possibly can for previous error. </p>

<p>Still there can be no doubt, but that the evil complained of
is considerable. It is from this reason, and from my personal
knowledge of the southern parts of the colony, that I should
rejoice to see its flats and its valleys filled with an
industrious population of a better description of farmers. A hope
might then be reasonably in<!--page lxv SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION RECOMMENDED. /page-->dulged, that the Home Government would
not be backward in recognising, and in acting upon a principle,
the soundness of which has been felt and acknowledged in all
ages, but the chief difficulty of which rests in its judicious
application. I allude to a system of emigration. Sure I am that
if it were well organized, and care were taken to profit by the
experience of the past in similar attempts, it could not fail to
be attended with ultimate success. The evils resulting from a
surplus population in an old community, were never more seriously
felt than in Great Britain at the present moment. Assuming that
the amount of surplus population is 2,000,000, the excess of
labour and competition thus occasioned by diminishing profits and
wages, creates, it has been said, an indirect tax to the enormous
extent of 20,000,000<i>l.</i> per annum. It has appeared to many
experienced persons, that it is in emigration, we should best
find the means of relief from this heavy pressure; particularly
if the individuals encouraged to go out to the colonies were
young persons of both sexes, from the industrious classes of the
community. Even if no more than three couples were induced to
emigrate from each parish in England in ten years, the relief to
the <!--page lxvi ENCOURAGEMENT FOR EMIGRATION. /page-->springs of industry would be very great. Besides, the funds
necessary for this purpose would revert to the country by a
thousand indirect channels. Persons unacquainted with our
Australian colonies, whether Van Dieman's Land or New South
Wales, can form little idea of the increasing demand for, and
consumption in them of every species of British manufacture. The
liberal encouragement given by government to every practicable
scheme of emigration, and the sum advanced by it towards the
expenses of the voyage to the labouring classes, sufficiently
indicate the light in which the subject is viewed by the
legislature; and the fact that no private family taking out
servants to Sydney, has in any one instance been able to retain
them, on account of offers more advantageous from other quarters,
shows clearly the great demand for labour in the colony. If I
might judge of the feelings of the majority of respectable
individuals there, from the assurances of the few, they would
willingly defray any parochial expenses attendant on the voyage,
provided the services of such individuals could be secured to
them for a time sufficiently long to remunerate them for such
pavement. The tide of emigration should be directed to Sydney,
Van Dieman's <!--page lxvii COMMITTEE FOUND AT SYDNEY. /page-->Land, or Western Australia, upon condition of the
labourer's receiving a certain sum in wages, and his daily
subsistence from his employer, with an understanding, however,
that he must consider himself bound for two years to such
employer. Surely there are hundreds of our indigent countrymen,
who would gladly seek a land of such plenty, and cast away the
natural, but unavailing regret of leaving home to secure to
themselves and their families, the substantial comforts of life
on such easy conditions. </p>

<p>It is not, perhaps, generally known that a committee has been
formed in Sydney, to advise settlers as to the best mode of
proceeding on arrival there. Such a plan is one of obvious
utility; and if those who may find themselves at a loss for
information would apply to this committee for advice, rather than
to individuals with whom they may become casually acquainted,
they would further their own interests, and in all probability
ensure success. Still there are some broad rules upon which every
man ought to act, which I shall endeavour to point out, and it
will give me no ordinary satisfaction, if I should be the means
of directing any one to the road of prosperity and comfort. <!--page lxviii HINTS TO EMIGRANTS. /page--> </p>

<p>It is to be feared that those who emigrate to New South Wales,
generally anticipate too great facility in their future
operations and certainty of success in conducting them; but they
should recollect that competency cannot be obtained without
labour. Every trade&mdash;every profession in this respect, is
subject to the same law&mdash;the lawyer, the physician, the
tradesman, and the mechanic. This labour is required at our
hands, even in an old community; how much more then is it called
for in a new, where the ingenuity of men is put to trial to
secure those means of accomplishing their ends which here are
abundant. Now, it appears to me but consistent, that he who is
obliged to leave his native country from want of means to hold
his station there, can hardly expect to find, or rather to
secure, abundance elsewhere without some exertion. Every man who
emigrates should proceed with a conviction on his mind, that he
is about to encounter years of labour and privation. He will not
then be disappointed at partial reverses, and will be more
thankful for unexpected prosperity. I feel persuaded the tone of
mind has a great deal to do with success, because it influences
the conduct of the individual. Supposing, <!--page lxix HINTS TO EMIGRANTS. /page-->however, that an
emigrant has taken this rational view of his situation, he should
determine on his pursuits, and allow nothing but absolute
certainty of better fortune to turn him aside. Men, however,
landing at Sydney, in their eagerness for information get
bewildered, give up their original plans, adopt new and uncertain
speculations, trifle away both their time and their money, and
ultimately ruin themselves. An individual who goes to New South
Wales for the purpose of settling, should not remain in Sydney a
day longer than is necessary for the arrangement of his affairs.
Every shilling spent there is thrown away. The greatest facility
is given by the different departments of the Colonial Government
to the settlers; and it is entirely his own fault if he trifles
away his time in search of information elsewhere than at the
fountainhead, or if he trusts to any other opinion than his own,
supposing him experienced as to the quality of the land he may
fix upon. Let him be speedy in his selection, and fix himself
upon his allotment as soon as possible. Instead of overstocking
his farm, or employing more labourers than he can afford to keep,
let him be satisfied with a gradual increase of his stock, <!--page lxx HINTS TO EMIGRANTS. /page-->and
wait patiently till he can better afford to employ labour; above
all, let him avoid embarrassing himself by the purchase of any
superfluous or unnecessary comfort. I consider that man has
already failed, who runs into debt in the first instance, or who
exhausts his means in the purchase of large herds, from the vain
expectation that their increase will clear him. The time was when
those idle speculations were occasionally attended with success,
but such is not now the case. The energies of the agriculturist
are directed to their proper channel, and if the few are unable
to make rapid fortunes, the many have escaped inevitable ruin. No
farm in a state of nature can be expected to yield any return of
consequence for the first year. It is incumbent on a settler to
provide for his establishment, or to retain the means of
providing for it as circumstances may require. </p>

<p>Farming implements are as cheap in Sydney as in England.
Horses and cattle are cheaper. It requires little, therefore, to
stock a farm in a reasonable manner. On the other hand, the
climate is so mild that the want of a house is scarcely felt, and
a temporary residence easily constructed. On the whole I am
convinced, <!--page lxxi HINTS TO EMIGRANTS. /page-->that a man who regulates his conduct by prudence, and
who perseveringly follows up his occupations, who behaves with
kindness to those around him, and performs his social and moral
duties with punctuality, will ultimately secure to himself a home
that will make up for the one he has quitted in the land of his
fathers, and place him in as respectable and as happy a situation
as that which he there enjoyed.</p>

<hr width="30%">

<p>Having thrown out the foregoing remarks for the information of
the general reader, and of persons who look to Australia with the
more earnest views of selecting a colonial home, I now return to
the immediate object of these volumes; but before entering on the
narrative of my own expeditions, I think it necessary to advert
cursorily to the discoveries previously accomplished. </p>

<p>The journeys of Mr. Oxley, far into the western interior of
Australia, gave rise to various and conflicting opinions as to
the character of the more central parts of that extensive
continent, of which the colony of New South Wales forms but a
small portion. I feel, therefore, called upon briefly to advert
to the con<!--page lxxii PROGRESS OF INLAND DISCOVERY. /page-->clusions which that able and intelligent officer drew
from his personal observation of the country into which he
penetrated, as an acquaintance with his opinions will not only
tend to throw a clearer light on the following details, but will,
also, convey much necessary information to those of my readers
who may not have perused his journals. It is necessary, however,
in order to divest the subject of all obscureness, to trace, in
the first instance, the progress of inland discovery, in New
South Wales, from the first foundation of the colony to the
period when Mr. Oxley's exertions attracted the public attention.
</p>

<p>In the year 1788, the British Government took formal
possession of the eastern coast of Australia, by the
establishment of a penal colony at Port Jackson. The first
settlers, under Governor Phillips, had too many difficulties to
contend with to submit themselves to be thwarted from pursuits
essential to their immediate safety and comfort, by the prospect
of remote and uncertain advantages. It was by perseverance and
toil alone that they first established and ultimately spread
themselves over that part of the territory, which, flanked by the
ocean on the one hand, and embraced as it were by the <!--page lxxiii MR. CALEY'S ATTEMPT. /page-->Nepean
River on the other, is now entitled the County Of Cumberland. For
many years, this single district supplied the wants of the
settlers. Upon it they found ample pasture for their herds, and
sufficient employment for themselves. Nor was it until a
succession of untoward seasons, and the rapid increase of their
stock pointed out to them the necessity of seeking for more
extensive pasturage, that they contemplated surmounting that dark
and rugged chain of mountains, which, like the natural ramparts
of Spain and Italy, rose high over the nether forest, and broke
the line of the western horizon. </p>

<p>A Mr. Caley is said to have been the first who attempted to
scale the Blue Mountains: but he did not long persevere in
struggling with difficulties too great for ordinary resolution to
overcome. It appears that he retraced his steps, after having
penetrated about sixteen miles into their dark and precipitous
recesses; and a heap of stones, which the traveller passes about
that distance from Erne Ford, on the road to Bathurst, marks the
extreme point reached by the first expedition to the westward of
the Nepean river. </p>

<p>Shortly after the failure of this expedition, the sad effects
of a long protracted drought called <!--page lxxiv LIEUT. LAWSON'S EXPEDITION. /page-->forth a more general spirit
of enterprise and exertion among the settlers; and Mr. Oxley
makes honorable mention of the perseverance and resolution with
which Lieut. Lawson, of the 104th regiment, accompanied by
Messrs. Blaxland and Wentworth, conducted an expedition into the
Blue Mountains. Their efforts were successful: and the objects of
their enterprise would have been completely attained, but for the
failure of their provisions at a moment when their view of the
distant interior was such as to convince them that they had
overcome the most formidable obstacles to their advance, and that
in their further progress few impediments would have presented
themselves. </p>

<p>The success of this undertaking induced Governor Macquarie to
further the prosecution of inland discovery, and of attempts to
ascertain the nature of the country of which Mr. Lawson only
obtained a glimpse. An expedition was accordingly dispatched
under Mr. Evans, the Deputy Surveyor-General, to follow the route
taken by the former one, and to penetrate as far as practicable
into the western interior. The result was the discovery of the
Macquarie river, and of Bathurst Plains. The report of Mr. <!--page lxxv MR. EVANS' DISCOVERIES. /page-->Evans
was so favourable, that orders were immediately issued for the
construction of a line of road across the mountains. When that
was completed, the Governor went in person to fix the site of a
future town on Bathurst Plains. From thence Mr. Evans, who
accompanied the Governor on the occasion, was directed to proceed
to the southward and westward, to ascertain the nature of the
country in that direction. He discovered another considerable
river, flowing, like the Macquarie, to the west, to which he gave
the name of the Lachlan. The promising appearance of these two
streams, and the expectation of all parties that they would be
found to water rich and extensive tracts of country, led to the
fitting out of a more important expedition than any which had
before been contemplated. </p>

<p>Mr. Oxley, the Surveyor-General of the Colony, was appointed
chief of this expedition, and was directed to trace the Lachlan
and Macquarie rivers, as far as practicable, with a view to
ascertain their capabilities and the nature of the country they
watered. In 1817, Mr. Oxley directed his attention to the former
river, and continued to follow its windings, until it <!--page lxxvi MR. OXLEY'S DISCOVERIES. /page-->appeared
that its waters were lost in successive marshes and it ceased to
be a river. In the following year he turned towards the
Macquarie, and traced it, in like manner, until he was checked by
high reeds that covered an extensive plain before him, amidst
which the channel of the river was lost. </p>

<p>From what he observed of the country, on both these occasions,
he was led to infer that beyond the limits of his advance the
interior had a uniform level, and was, for the most part,
uninhabitable and under water. Its features must have been
strongly marked to have confirmed such an opinion in the mind of
the late Surveyor-General. It stands recorded on the pages of his
journal, that he travelled over a country of many miles in
extent, after clearing the mountains, which so far from
presenting any rise of ground to the eye, bore unequivocal marks
of frequent and extensive inundation. He traced two rivers of
considerable size, and found that, at a great distance from each
other, they apparently terminated in marshes, and that the
country beyond them was low and unbroken. In his progress
eastward, he crossed a third stream (the Castlereagh), about
forty-five miles <!--page lxxvii MR. OXLEY'S DISCOVERIES. /page-->from the Macquarie, seemingly not inferior to it
in size, originating in the mountains for which he was making,
and flowing nearly parallel to the other rivers into a level
country like that which he had just quitted. </p>

<p>Mr. Evans, moreover, who accompanied Mr. Oxley on these
journeys, and who had been detached by his principal from Mount
Harris, to ascertain the nature of the country in the line which
the expedition was next to pursue, having crossed the Castlereagh
considerably below the place at which the party afterwards
effected a passage, reported that the river was then running
through high reeds. The inference naturally drawn by Mr. Oxley,
was, that it terminated as the Lachlan and the Macquarie had
done; and that their united waters formed an inland sea or basin.
It is evident that Mr. Oxley had this impression on his mind,
when he turned towards the coast; but the wet state of the
lowlands prevented him from ascertaining its correctness or
error. Doubt, consequently, still existed as to the nature of the
country he had left behind him; a question in which the best
interests of the colony were apparently involved. Subsequently to
these discoveries, Mr. Surveyor <!--page lxxviii DISCOVERIES OF MESSRS. MECHAN, /page-->Mechan, accompanied by Mr.
Hamilton Hume, a colonist of considerable experience, explored
the country more to the southward and westward of Sydney, and
discovered most of the new country called Argyle, and also Lake
Bathurst. </p>

<p>Mr. Hume was afterwards associated with a Mr. Hovel, in an
excursion to the south coast, under the auspices of Sir Thomas
Brisbane. After a most persevering and laborious journey, they
reached the sea; but it is uncertain whether they made Port
Philips, or Western Port. Mr. Hume, whose practical experience
will yield to that of no man, entertains a conviction that it was
to the former they descended from the neighbouring ranges; but
Mr. Hovel, I believe supports a contrary opinion. In the early
stage of their journey, they passed over York or Yass Plains;
and, after crossing the Morumbidgee, were generally entangled
among mountain ranges that increased in height to the east and
south-east. They crossed three considerable rivers, falling
westerly, which they named the Goulburn, the Hume, and the Ovens;
and found a beautiful and well-watered country in the vicinity of
the coast. </p>

<p>In 1826, Mr. Allan Cunningham, Botanical <!--page lxxix HUME, HOVEL AND CUNNINGHAM. /page-->Collector to his late
Majesty, traversed a considerable portion of the interior to the
north of Bathurst, and, with a laudable zeal, devoted his labours
to the acquisition of general information, as well as to his more
immediate professional pursuits. In 1827, this gentleman again
bent his steps towards the northward, and succeeded in gaining
the 28th parallel of latitude; and, on a subsequent occasion,
having taken his departure from Moreton Bay, he connected his
former journey with that settlement, and thus contributed largely
to our knowledge of the mountain country between it and the
capital. Mr. Cunningham, who, independently of his individual
excursions, had not only circumnavigated the Australian Continent
with Capt. King, but had formed also one of the party with Mr.
Oxley, in the journeys before noticed, had adopted this
gentleman's opinion with regard to the swampy and inhospitable
character of the distant interior. Its depressed appearance from
the high ground on which Mr. Cunningham subsequently moved,
tended to confirm this opinion, which was moreover daily gaining
strength from the reports of the natives, who became more
frequent in their intercourse with the whites, and who reported <!--page lxxx CONJECTURES RESPECTING THE INTERIOR. /page-->that
there were large waters to the westward, on which the natives had
canoes, and in which there were fish of great size. </p>

<p>It became, therefore, a current opinion, that the western
interior of New Holland comprehended an extensive basin, of which
the ocean of reeds which had proved so formidable to Mr. Oxley,
formed most probably the outskirts; and it was generally thought
that an expedition proceeding into the interior, would encounter
marshes of vast extent, which would be extremely difficult to
turn, and no less dangerous to enter. </p>

<p>It remained to be proved, however, whether these conjectures
were founded in fact. The chief difficulty lay in the character
of the country, and in providing the necessary means to ensure
success. Those which were resorted to will be found in the
succeeding chapter. Whether they would have been found sufficient
and applicable had the interior been wholly under water, is
doubtful; and my impression on this point induced me to make more
efficient arrangements on the second expedition.</p>

<p>The year 1826 was remarkable for the commencement of one of
those fearful droughts to which we have reason to believe the
climate of New South Wales is periodically subject. It continued
during the two following years with unabated severity. The
surface of the earth became so parched up that minor vegetation
ceased upon it. Culinary herbs were raised with difficulty, and
crops failed even in the most favourable situations. Settlers
drove their flocks and <!--page 2 OBJECTS OF THE EXPEDITION. /page-->herds to distant tracts for pasture and
water, neither remaining for them in the located districts. The
interior suffered equally with the coast, and men, at length,
began to despond under so alarming a visitation. It almost
appeared as if the Australian sky were never again to be
traversed by a cloud. </p>

<p>But, however severe for the colony the seasons had proved, or
were likely to prove, it was borne in mind at this critical
moment, that the wet and swampy state of the interior had alone
prevented Mr. Oxley from penetrating further into it, in 1818.
Each successive report from Wellington Valley, the most distant
settlement to the N. W., confirmed the news of the unusually dry
state of the lowlands, and of the exhausted appearance of the
streams falling into them. It was, consequently, hoped that an
expedition, pursuing the line of the Macquarie, would have a
greater chance of success than the late Surveyor General had; and
that the difficulties he had to contend against would be found to
be greatly diminished, if not altogether removed. The immediate
fitting out of an expedition was therefore decided upon, for the
express purpose of ascertaining the nature and extent of that
basin into which the Macquarie was supposed to fall, and whether
any connection existed between it and the streams falling
westerly. As I had early taken a great interest in the geography
of New South Wales, the Governor was pleased to appoint me to the
command of this expedition. </p>

<p>In the month of September, 1828, I received his Ex<!--page 3 JOURNEY FROM SYDNEY TO EMU PLAINS. /page-->cellency's
commands to prepare for my journey; and by the commencement of
November, had organized my party, and completed the necessary
arrangements. On the 9th of that month, I waited on the Governor,
at Parramatta, to receive his definitive instructions. As the
establishments at Sydney had been unable to supply me with the
necessary number of horses and oxen, instructions had been
forwarded to Mr. Maxwell, the superintendent of Wellington
Valley, to train a certain number for my use; and I was now
directed to push for that settlement without loss of time. I
returned to Sydney in the afternoon of the 9th, and on the 10th
took leave of my brother officers, to commence a journey of very
dubious issue; and, in company with my friend, Staff-surgeon
M'Leod, who had obtained permission to accompany me to the limits
of the colony, followed my men along the great western road. We
moved leisurely over the level country, between the coast and the
Nepean River, and availed ourselves of the kind hospitality of
those of our friends whose property lay along that line of road,
to secure more comfortable places of rest than the inns would
have afforded. </p>

<p>We reached Sheane, the residence of Dr. Harris, on the 11th,
and were received by him with the characteristic kindness with
which friends or strangers are ever welcomed by that gentleman,
He had accompanied Mr. Oxley as a volunteer in 1818, and his name
was then given to the mount which formed the extreme point to
which the main body of the first expedition down the banks of the
Macquarie penetrated, in a westerly direction. <!--page 4 FROM EMU PLAINS TO /page--> </p>

<p>The general appearance of the property of Dr. Harris, showed
how much perseverance and labour had effected towards its
improvement. Many acres of ground bore a promising crop, over
which a gloomy forest had once waved. The Doctor's farming
establishment was as complete as his husbandry seemed to be
prosperous; but he did not appear to be satisfied with the extent
of his dwelling, to which he was making considerable additions,
although I should have thought it large enough for all ordinary
purposes of residence or hospitality. The rewards of successful
industry were everywhere visible. </p>

<p>On the 13th, we gained Regent's Ville, the more splendid
mansion of Sir John Jamieson, which overlooks the Nepean River,
and commands the most beautiful and extensive views of the Blue
Mountains. Crossing the ford on the 14th, we overtook the men as
they were toiling up the first ascent of those rugged bulwarks,
which certainly gave no favourable earnest of the road before us;
and, as we could scarcely hope to reach the level country to the
westward without the occurrence of some accident, I determined to
keep near the drays, that I might be on hand should my presence
be required. We gained O'Connell's plains on the 20th November,
and arrived at Bathurst on the 22nd, with no other damage than
the loss of one of the props supporting the boat which snapped in
two as we descended Mount York. On examination, it was found that
the boat had also received a slight contusion, but it admitted of
easy repair. <!--page 5 WELLINGTON VALLEY. /page--> </p>

<p>I was detained at Bathurst longer than I intended, in
consequence of indisposition, and during my stay there
experienced many proofs of the kind hospitality of the settlers
of that promising district: nor was I ever more impressed with
the importance of the service upon which I was employed, or more
anxious as to the issue, than while contemplating the rapid
advance of agriculture upon its plains, and the formidable bar to
its prosperity which I had left behind me, in the dark and gloomy
ranges which I had crossed. </p>

<p>On the 27th, Mr. Hamilton Hume, whose experience well
qualified him for the task, and who had been associated with me
in the expedition, having joined me, we proceeded on our journey,
and reached Wellington Valley about the end of the month. </p>

<p>I wished to push into the interior without any delay, or at
least, so soon as we should have completed our arrangements and
organized the party; but, although Mr. Maxwell had paid every
attention to the training of the cattle, he was of opinion that
they could not yet be wholly relied upon, and strongly
recommended that they should be kept at practice for another
week. As we could not have left the settlement under the most
favourable circumstances in less than four days, the further
delay attendant on this measure was considered immaterial, and it
was, accordingly, determined upon. Mr. Hume undertook to
superintend the training of the animals, and this left me at
leisure to gather such information as would be of use to us in
our progress down the river. <!--page 6 WELLINGTON VALLEY. /page--> </p>

<p>In his description of Wellington Valley, Mr. Oxley has not
done it more than justice. It is certainly a beautiful and
fertile spot, and it was now abundant in pasturage,
notwithstanding the unfavourable season that had passed over it. </p>

<p>The settlement stands upon the right bank of the Bell, about
two miles above the junction of that stream with the Macquarie.
Its whitewashed buildings bore outward testimony to the
cleanliness and regularity of the inhabitants; and the respectful
conduct of the prisoners under his charge, showed that Mr.
Maxwell had maintained that discipline by which alone he could
have secured respect to himself and success to his exertions, at
such a distance from the seat of government. </p>

<p>The weather was so exceedingly hot, during our stay, that it
was impossible to take exercise at noon; but in the evening, or
at an early hour in the morning, we were enabled to make short
excursions in the neighbourhood. </p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell informed me that there were three stations below
the settlement, the first of which, called Gobawlin, belonging to
Mr. Wylde, was not more than five miles from it; the other two,
occupied by Mr. Palmer, were at a greater distance, one being
nineteen, the other thirty-four miles below the junction of the
Bell. He was good enough to send for the stockman (or chief
herdsman), in charge of the last, to give me such information of
the nature of the country below him, as he could furnish from
personal knowledge or from the accounts of the natives. <!--page 7 LOW STATE OF THE MACQUARIE RIVER. /page--> </p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell pointed out to me the spot on which Mr. Oxley's
boats had been built, close upon the bank of the Macquarie; and I
could not but reflect with some degree of apprehension on the
singularly diminished state of the river from what it must then
have been to allow a boat to pass down it. Instead of a broad
stream and a rapid current, the stream was confined to a narrow
space in the centre of the channel, and it ran so feebly amidst
frequent shallows that it was often scarcely perceptible. The
Bell, also, which Mr. Oxley describes as dashing and rippling
along its pebbly bed, had ceased to flow, and consisted merely of
a chain of ponds. </p>

<p>On the 3rd of Dec, the stockman from below arrived; but the
only information we gathered from him was the existence of a lake
to the left of the river, about three days' journey below the run
of his herds, on the banks of which he assured us, the native
companions, a species of stork, stood in rows like companies of
soldiers. </p>

<p>He brought up a nest of small paroquets of the most beautiful
plumage, as a present to Mr. Maxwell, and affirmed that they were
common about his part of the river. The peculiarity of the
seasons had also brought a parrot into the valley which had never
before visited it. This delicate bird was noticed by Captain Cook
upon the coast, and is called <i>Psittacus Novae-Hollandiae</i>,
or New Holland Parrot, by Mr. Brown. <!--comment {probably the
Cockatiel <i>Nymphicus hollandicus</i>} /comment--> It had not, however, been
subsequently seen until the summer of 1828, when it made its
appearance at Wellington Valley in considerable num<!--page 8 DEPARTURE FOR THE INTERIOR. /page-->bers, together
with a species of merops or mountain bee-eater. </p>

<p>On the 5th, our preparations being wholly completed, and the
loads arranged, the party was mustered, and was found to consist
of myself and Mr. Hume, two soldiers and eight prisoners of the
crown, two of whom were to return with dispatches. Our animals
numbered two riding, and seven pack, horses, two draft, and eight
pack, bullocks, exclusive of two horses of my own, and two for
the men to be sent back. </p>

<p>The morning of the 7th December, the day upon which we were to
leave the valley, was ushered in by a cloudless sky, and that
heated appearance in the atmosphere which foretells an
oppressively sultry day. I therefore put off the moment of our
departure to the evening, and determined to proceed no further
than Gobawlin. I was the more readily induced to order this short
journey because the animals had not been practised to their full
loads, and I thought they might have given some trouble at
starting with an unusual weight. They moved off however very
quietly, and as if they had been accustomed to their work by a
long course of training. We took our departure from the
settlement at 3 p.m. and, crossing to the right bank of the
Macquarie, a little above its junction with the Bell, reached Mr
Wylde's station about half-past five. Thus we commenced our
journey under circumstances as favorable as could have been
wished. In disengaging ourselves on the following day from the
hills by which Wellington Valley is encompassed on the westward,
with a view to approach Mr. Pal<!--page 9 BANKS OF THE MACQUARIE. /page-->mer's first station, we kept
rather wide of the river, and only occasionally touched on its
more projecting angles. The soil at a distance from the stream
was by no means so good as that in its immediate vicinity, nor
was the timber of the same description. On the rich and
picturesque grounds near the river the angophora prevailed with
the flooded gum, and the scenery upon its banks was improved by
the casuarinae that overhung them. On the latter, inferior
eucalypti and cypresses were mixed together. The country was
broken and undulating, and the hills stony, notwithstanding
which, they appeared to have an abundance of pasture upon them.
Mr. Hume rode with me to the summit of a limestone elevation,
from which I thought it probable we might have obtained such a
view as would have enabled us to form some idea of the country
into which we were about to descend. But in following the river
line, the eye wandered over a dark and unbroken forest alone. The
ranges from which we were fast receding formed an irregular and
beautiful landscape to the southward; and contrasted strongly
with the appearance of the country to the N. W., in which
direction it was rapidly assuming a level. </p>

<p>We reached Mr. Palmer's at a late hour in the afternoon, in
consequence of a delay we experienced in crossing a gully, and
encamped upon a high bank immediately opposite to the mouth of
Molle's rivulet which here joins the Macquarie from the
southward. The cattle had consumed all the food, and the ground
on both sides of the river looked bare and arid. <!--page 10 DIBILAMBLE. /page--> </p>

<p>No doubt, however, the face of the country in ordinary seasons
wears a very different appearance. Its general elevation
continued high; nor did the Macquarie assume any change of
aspect. Mountain debris and rounded pebbles of various kinds
formed its bed, which was much encumbered with timber. </p>

<p>We had been unable to persuade any of the natives of
Wellington Valley to accompany us as guides, on our leaving that
settlement. Even Mr. Maxwell's influence failed; for,
notwithstanding the promises of several, when they saw that we
were ready to depart, they either feigned sickness or stated that
they were afraid of the more distant natives. The fact is, that
they were too lazy to wander far from their own district, and too
fond of Maxwell's beef to leave it for a precarious bush
subsistence. Fortunately we found several natives with Mr.
Palmer's stockmen, who readily undertook to conduct us by the
nearest route to the cataract, which we considered to be midway
between Wellington Valley and Mount Harris. We started under
their guidance for Dibilamble, Mr. Palmer's second station, and
reached it about half-past 4 p.m. The distance between the two is
sixteen miles. The country for some miles differs in no material
point from that through which we had already passed. The same
rich tracts of soil near the river and the same inferiority in
the tracks remote from it. Near Dibilamble, however, the
limestone formation terminates, and gives place to barren stony
ridges, upon which the cypress callities is of close and stunted
growth. The ridges themselves were formed of a coarse kind of
freestone <!--page 11 SCENERY NEAR THE RIVER. /page-->in a state of rapid decomposition. The Tabragar (the
Erskine of Mr. Oxley) falls into the Macquarie at Dibilamble. It
had long ceased to flow, being a small mountain torrent whose
source, if we judge from the shingly nature of its bed, cannot be
very distant. Our descent was considerable during the day; the
rapids were frequent in the river, but it underwent no change in
its general appearance. Its waters were hard and transparent, and
its banks, in many places, extremely lofty; with a red sandy loam
and gravel under the alluvial deposits. It generally happened
that where the bank was high on the one side it was low and
subject to flood, to a limited extent at least, on the other.
Upon these low grounds the blue-gum trees were of lofty growth,
but on the upper levels box prevailed. </p>

<p>The views upon the river were really beautiful, and varied at
every turn; nor is it possible for any tree to exceed the
casuarina in the graceful manner in which it bends over the
stream, or clings to some solitary rock in its centre. </p>

<p>It here became necessary for us to cross to the left bank of
the river, not only to avoid its numerous windings, and thus to
preserve as much as possible the direct line to Mount Harris; but
also, because the travelling was much better on the south side.
We therefore availed ourselves of a ford opposite to the ground
on which the tents had stood; and then pursued our journey, in a
south-westerly course, over a country of a description very
inferior to that of any we had previously noticed. </p>

<p>Iron-bark and cypresses generally prevailed along our <!--page 12 TAYLOR'S RIVULET. /page-->line of
route on a poor and sandy soil, which improved after we passed
Elizabeth Burn, a small creek mentioned by Mr. Oxley. </p>

<p>We approached the river again early in the day, and pitched
our tent on the summit of a sloping bank that overlooked one of
its long still reaches. We were protected from the sun by the
angophora trees, which formed a hanging wood around us, and, with
its bright green foliage, gave a cheerfulness to the scene that
was altogether unusual. The opposite side of the river was rather
undulated, and the soil appeared to be of the finest description.
The grass, although growing in tufts, afforded abundance of
pasture for the cattle; and, on the whole, this struck me as a
most eligible spot for a station, and I found it occupied as such
on the return of the expedition. We had encamped about a quarter
of a mile from Taylor's Rivulet, which discharges itself into the
Macquarie from the N. E., and is the first stream, upon the right
bank, below the Wellington Valley. </p>

<p>Immediately after receiving it the river sweeps away to the
southward, in consequence of which it became again necessary for
us to cross it. Our guides, who were intelligent lads, led the
cattle to a ford, a little below the junction of Taylor's
Rivulet, at which we effected a passage with some difficulty; the
opposite bank being very steep, and we were obliged to force our
way up a gully for some eighty or a hundred yards before we could
extricate the team. Pursuing our journey, in a N. W. direction,
we soon left the <!--page 13 SURPRISE SOME NATIVES. /page-->rich and undulating grounds bordering the river
behind us. A poor, level, and open country, succeeded them. The
soil changed to a light red, sandy loam, on which eucalypti,
cypresses, and casuarinae, were intermixed with minor shrubs; of
which latter, the cherry tree (exocarpus cupressiformis) was the
most prevalent. </p>

<p>At about seven miles from the river we passed some barren
freestone ridges, near which Mr. Hume killed the first kangaroo
we had seen. At mid-day we passed a small creek, at which the
cattle were watered; and afterwards continued our journey through
a country similar to that over which we had already made our way.
</p>

<p>As we neared the stream we noticed the acacia pendula for the
first time,&mdash;an indication of our approach to the
marshes. The weather still continued extremely hot. Our journey
this day was unusually long, and our cattle suffered so much, and
moved so slowly, that it was late when we struck upon the
Macquarie, at a part where its banks were so high that we had
some difficulty in finding a good watering place. </p>

<p>Being considerably in front of the party, with one of our
guides, when we neared the river, I came suddenly upon a family
of natives. They were much terrified, and finding that they could
not escape, called vehemently to some of their companions, who
were in the distance. By the time Mr. Hume came up, they had in
some measure recovered their presence of mind, but availed
themselves of the first favourable moment to leave us. I was
particular in not <!--page 14 NATIVE BURIAL PLACE. /page-->imposing any restraint on these men, in
consequence of which they afterwards mustered sufficient
resolution to visit us in our camp. We now judged that we were
about ten miles from the cataract, and that, according to the
accounts of the stockman, we could not be very distant from the
lake he had mentioned. </p>

<p>As I was unwilling to pass any important feature of the
country without enquiry or examination, I requested Mr. Hume to
interrogate the strangers on the subject. They stated that they
belonged to the lake tribe, that the lake was a short day's
journey to the eastward, and that they would guide us to it if we
wished. The matter was accordingly arranged. They left us at
dusk, but returned to the camp at the earliest dawn; when we once
more crossed the river, and, after traversing a very level
country for about nine miles, arrived at our destination. We
passed over the dried beds of lagoons, and through coppices of
cypresses and acacia pendula, or open forest, but did not observe
any of the barren stony ridges so common to the N.E. About a
mile, or a mile and a half, from the lake we examined a solitary
grave that had recently been constructed. It consisted of an
oblong mound, with three semicircular seats. A walk encompassed
the whole, from which three others branched off for a few yards
only, into the forest. Several cypresses, overhanging the grave,
were fancifully carved on the inner side, and on one the shape of
a heart was deeply engraved. </p>

<p>We were sadly disappointed in the appearance of the <!--page 15 BUDDAH LAKE. /page-->lake,
which the natives call the Buddah. It is a serpentine sheet of
fresh water, of rather more than a mile in length, and from three
to four hundred yards in breadth. Its depth was four fathoms; but
it seemed as if it were now five or six feet below the ordinary
level. No stream either runs into it or flows from it; yet it
abounds in fish; from which circumstance I should imagine that it
originally owed its supply to the river during some extensive
inundation. Notwithstanding that we had crossed some rich tracts
of land in our way to it, the neighbourhood of the lake was by no
means fertile. The trees around it were in rapid decay, and the
little vegetation to be seen appeared to derive but little
advantage from its proximity to water. </p>

<p>We had started at early dawn; and the heat had become
intolerable long ere the sun had gained the meridian. It was
rendered still more oppressive from the want of air in the dense
bushes through which we occasionally moved. At 2 p.m. the
thermometer stood at 129° of Fahrenheit, in the shade; and at
149° in the sun; the difference being exactly 20°. It is not to
be wondered at that the cattle suffered, although the journey was
so short. The sun's rays were too powerful even for the natives,
who kept as much as possible in the shade. In the evening, when
the atmosphere was somewhat cooler, we launched the boat upon the
lake, in order to get some wild fowl and fish; but although we
were tolerably successful with our guns, we did not take anything
with our hooks. </p>

<p>The natives had, in the course of the afternoon, been <!--page 16 EXTREME HEAT OF THE WEATHER. /page-->joined
by the rest of the tribe, and they now numbered about three and
twenty. They were rather distant in their manner, and gazed with
apparent astonishment at the scene that was passing before them. </p>

<p>If there had been other proof wanting, of the lamentably
parched and exhausted state of the interior, we had on this
occasion ample evidence of it, and of the fearful severity of the
drought under which the country was suffering. As soon as the sun
dipped under the horizon, hundreds of birds came crowding to the
border of the lake, to quench the thirst they had been unable to
allay in the forest. Some were gasping, others almost too weak to
avoid us, and all were indifferent to the reports of our guns. </p>

<p>On leaving the Buddah, eleven only of the natives accompanied
us. We reached the river again about noon, on a north-half-east
course, where it had a rocky bed, and continued to journey along
it, until we reached the cataract at which we halted. We
travelled over soil generally inferior to that which we had seen
on the preceding day, but rich in many places. The same kind of
timber was observed, but the acacia pendula was more prevalent
than any other, although near the river the flooded gum and
Australian apple-tree were of beautiful growth.</p>

<h5>CATARACT OF THE MACQUARIE.</h5>

<p>It had appeared to me that the waters of the Macquarie had
been diminishing in volume since our departure from Wellington
Valley, and I had a favourable opportunity of judging as to the
correctness of this conclusion at the cataract, where its
channel, at all times much contracted, was <!--page 17 CATARACT OF THE MACQUARIE. /page-->particularly so on the
present occasion. So little force was there in the current, that
I began to entertain doubts how long it would continue, more
especially when I reflected on the level character of the country
we had entered, and the fact of the Macquarie not receiving any
tributary between this point and the marshes. I was in
consequence led to infer that result, which, though not
immediately, eventually took place. </p>

<p>As they were treated with kindness, the natives who
accompanied us soon threw off all reserve, and in the afternoon
assembled at the pool below the fall to take fish. They went very
systematically to work, with short spears in their hands that
tapered gradually to a point, and sank at once under water
without splash or noise at a given signal from an elderly man. In
a short time, one or two rose with the fish they had transfixed;
the others remained about a minute under water, and then made
their appearance near the same rock into the crevices of which
they had driven their prey. Seven fine bream were taken, the
whole of which they insisted on giving to our men, although I am
not aware that any of themselves had broken their fast that day.
They soon, however, procured a quantity of muscles, with which
they sat down very contentedly at a fire. My barometrical
admeasurement gave the cataract an elevation of 680 feet above
the level of the sea; and my observations placed it in east
longitude 148° 3´ and in latitude 31° 50´ south. </p>

<p>It became an object with us to gain the right bank of <!--page 18 A TRIBE OF NATIVES. /page-->the
Macquarie as soon as possible; for it was evident that the
country to the southward of it was much more swampy than it was
to the north: but for some distance below the cataract, we found
it impossible to effect our purpose. The rocks composing the bed
of the river at the cataract, which are of trapp formation,
disappeared at about eight miles below it, when the river
immediately assumed another character. Its banks became of equal
height, which had not before been the case, and averaged from
fifteen to eighteen feet. They were composed entirely of alluvial
soil, and were higher than the highest flood-marks. Its waters
appeared to be turbid and deep, and its bed was a mixture of sand
and clay. The casuarina, which had so often been admired by us,
entirely disappeared and the channel in many places became so
narrow as to be completely arched over by gum-trees. </p>

<p>On the 16th, we fell in with a numerous tribe of natives who
joined our train after the very necessary ceremonies of an
introduction had passed, and when added to those who still
accompanied us, amounted to fifty-three. On this occasion I was
riding somewhat in front of the party, when I came upon them.
They were very different in appearance from those whom we had
surprised at the river; and from the manner in which I was
received, I was led to infer that they had been informed of our
arrival, and had purposely assembled to meet us. I was saluted by
an old man, who had stationed himself in front of his tribe, and
who was their chief. Behind him the young men stood in a <!--page 19 CONDUCT OF THE NATIVES. /page-->line,
and behind them the warriors were seated on the ground. </p>

<p>I had a young native with me who had attached himself to our
party, and who, from his extreme good nature and superior
intelligence, was considered by us as a first-rate kind of
fellow. He explained who and what we were, and I was glad to
observe that the old chief seemed perfectly reconciled to my
presence, although he cast many an anxious glance at the long
train of animals that were approaching. The warriors, I remarked,
never lifted their eyes from the ground. They were hideously
painted with red and yellow ochre, and had their weapons at their
sides, while their countenances were fixed, sullen, and
determined. In order to overcome this mood, I rode up to them,
and, taking a spear from the nearest, gave him my gun to examine;
a mark of confidence that was not lost upon them, for they
immediately relaxed from their gravity, and as soon as my party
arrived, rose up and followed us. That which appeared most to
excite their surprise, was the motion of the wheels of the boat
carriage. The young native whom I have noticed above, acted as
interpreter, and, by his facetious manner, contrived to keep the
whole of us in a fit of laughter as we moved along. He had been
named Botheri by some stockman. </p>

<p>In consequence of our wish to cross the river, we kept near
it, and experienced considerable delay from the frequent marshes
that opposed themselves to our progress. In one of these we saw a
number of ibises and spoon<!--page 20 CROSSING OF THE RIVER. /page-->bills; and the natives succeeded in
killing two or three snakes. Our view to the westward was
extremely limited; but to the eastward the country appeared in
some places to expand into plains. </p>

<p>After travelling some miles down the banks of the river,
finding that they still retained their steep character, we turned
back to a place which Mr. Hume had observed, and at which he
thought we might, with some little trouble, cross to the opposite
side. And, however objectionable the attempt was, we found
ourselves obliged to make it. We descended, therefore, into the
channel of the river, and unloaded the animals and boat-carriage.
In order to facilitate the ascent of the right bank, some of the
men were directed to cut steps up it. I was amused to see the
natives voluntarily assist them; and was surprised when they took
up bags of flour weighing 100 pounds each, and carried them
across the river. We were not long in getting the whole of the
stores over. The boat was then hoisted on the shoulders of the
strongest, and deposited on the top of the opposite bank; and
ropes being afterwards attached to the carriage, it was soon
drawn up to a place of safety. The natives worked as hard as our
own people, and that, too, with a cheerfulness for which I was
altogether unprepared, and which is certainly foreign to their
natural habits. We pitched our tents as soon as we had effected
the passage of the river; after which, the men went to bathe, and
blacks and whites were mingled promiscuously in the stream. I did
not observe that the former differed in any respect from <!--page 21 BAROMETER BROKEN. /page-->the
natives who frequent the located districts. They were generally
clean limbed and stout, and some of the young men had pleasing
intelligent countenances. They lacerate their bodies, inflicting
deep wounds to raise the flesh, and extract the front teeth like
the Bathurst tribes; and their weapons are precisely the same.
They are certainly a merry people, and sit up laughing and
talking more than half the night. </p>

<p>During the removal of the stores my barometer was
unfortunately broken, and I had often, in the subsequent stages
of the journey, occasion to regret the accident. I apprehend that
the corks in the instrument, placed to steady the tube, are too
distant from each other in most cases; and indeed I fear that
barometers as at present constructed, will seldom be carried with
safety in overland expeditions. </p>

<p>Nine only of the natives accompanied us on the morning
succeeding the day in which we crossed the river. Botheri was,
however, at the head of them; and, as we journeyed along, he
informed me that he had been promised a wife on his return from
acting as our guide, by the chief of the last tribe. The
excessive heat of the weather obliged us to shorten our journey,
and we encamped about noon in some scrub after having traversed a
level country for about eleven miles. </p>

<p>Several considerable plains were noticed to our right,
stretching east and west, which were generally rich in point of
soil; but we passed through much brushy land during the day. It
was lamentable to see the state of vegetation upon the plains
from want of moisture. Although the coun<!--page 22 DESERTED BY THE NATIVES. /page-->try had assumed a level
character, and was more open than on the higher branches of the
Macquarie, the small freestone elevations, backing the alluvial
tracts near the river, still continued upon our right, though
much diminished in height, and at a great distance from the
banks. They seemed to be covered with cypresses and beef-wood,
but dwarf-box and the acacia pendula prevailed along the plains;
while flooded-gum alone occupied the lands in the immediate
neighbourhood of the stream, which was evidently fast
diminishing, both in volume and rapidity; its bed, however, still
continuing to be a mixture of sand and clay. </p>

<p>The cattle found such poor feed around the camp that they
strayed away in search of better during the night. On such an
occasion Botheri and his fraternity would have been of real
service; but he had decamped at an early hour, and had carried
off an axe, a tomahawk, and some bacon, although I had made him
several presents. I was not at all surprised at this piece of
roguery, since cunning is the natural attribute of a savage; but
I was provoked at their running away at a moment when I so much
required their assistance. </p>

<p>Left to ourselves, I found Mr. Hume of the most essential
service in tracking the animals, and to his perseverance we were
indebted for their speedy recovery, They had managed to find
tolerable feed near a serpentine sheet of water, which Mr. Hume
thought it would be advisable to examine. We directed our course
to it as soon as the cattle were loaded, moving through bush, and
found it to be <!--page 23 GREAT HEAT. /page-->a very considerable creek that receives a part of
the superfluous waters of the Macquarie, and distributes them,
most probably, over the level country to the north. It was much
wider than the river, being from fifty to sixty yards across, and
is resorted to by the natives, who procure muscles from its bed
in great abundance. We were obliged to traverse its eastern bank
to its junction with the river, at which it fortunately happened
to be dry. We had, however, to cut roads down both its banks
before we could cross it; and, consequently, made but a short
day's journey. The soil passed over was inferior to the
generality of soil near the river, but we encamped on a tongue of
land on which both the flooded-gum and the grass were of
luxuriant height. We found a quantity of a substance like
pipe-clay in the bed of the river, similar to that mentioned by
Mr. Oxley. </p>

<p>The heat, which had been excessive at Wellington Valley,
increased upon us as we advanced into the interior. The
thermometer was seldom under 114° at noon, and rose still higher
at 2 p.m. We had no dews at night, and consequently the range of
the instrument was trifling in the twenty-four hours. The country
looked bare and scorched, and the plains over which we journeyed
had large fissures traversing them, so that the earth may
literally be said to have gasped for moisture. The country, which
above the cataract had borne the character of open forest,
excepting on the immediate banks of the river, where its
undulations and openness gave it a park-like appearance, or where
the barren stony ridges prevailed below that point, generally ex<!--page 24 ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY, AND THE RIVER. /page-->hibited
alternately plain and brush, the soil on both of which was good.
On the former, crested pigeons were numerous, several of which
were shot. We had likewise procured some of the rose-coloured and
grey parrots, mentioned by Mr. Oxley, and a small paroquet of
beautiful plumage; but there was less of variety in the feathered
race than I expected to find, and most of the other birds we had
seen were recognised by me as similar to specimens I had procured
from Melville Island, and were, therefore, most probably birds of
passage. </p>

<p>As we neared Mount Harris, the Macquarie became more sluggish
in its flow, and fell off so much as scarcely to deserve the name
of a river. In breadth, it averaged from thirty-five to
forty-five yards, and in the height of its banks, from fifteen to
eighteen. Mr. Hume had succeeded in taking some fish at one of
the stock stations; but if I except those speared by the natives,
we had since been altogether unsuccessful with the hook, a
circumstance which I attribute to the lowness of the river
itself. </p>

<p>About thirty miles from the cataract the country declines to
the north as a medium point, and again changes somewhat in its
general appearance. To the S. and S.W. it appeared level and
wooded, while to the N. the plains became more frequent, but
smaller, and travelling over them was extremely dangerous, in
consequence of the large fissures by which they were traversed.
The only trees to be observed were dwarf-box and the acacia
pendula, both of stunted growth, although flooded-gum still
prevailed upon the river.</p>

<h5>THE ROSE COCKATOO.</h5>
<!--page 25 ARRIVAL AT MOUNT HARRIS. /page-->
<p>On the 20th we travelled on a N.W. course, and in the early
part of the day passed over tolerably good soil. It was succeeded
by a barren scrub, through which we penetrated in the direction
of Welcome Rock, a point we had seen from one of the Plains and
had mistaken for Mount Harris. </p>

<p>On a nearer approach, however, we observed our error, and
corrected it by turning more to the left; and we ultimately
encamped about a mile to the W.S.W. of the latter eminence. On
issuing from the scrub we found ourselves among reeds and coarse
water-grass; and, from the appearance of the country, we were led
to conclude that we had arrived at a part of the interior more
than ordinarily subject to overflow. </p>

<p>As soon as the camp was fixed, Mr. Hume and I rode to Mount
Harris, over ground subject to flood and covered for the most
part by the polygonum, being too anxious to defer our examination
of its neighbourhood even for a few hours. </p>

<p>Nearly ten years had elapsed since Mr. Oxley pitched his tents
under the smallest of the two hills into which Mount Harris is
broken. There was no difficulty in hitting upon his position. The
trenches that had been cut round the tents were still perfect,
and the marks of the fire-places distinguishable; while the trees
in the neighbourhood had been felled, and round about them the
staves of some casks and a few tent-pegs were scattered. Mr.
Oxley had selected a place at some distance from the river, in
consequence of its then swollen state. I looked upon it from <!--page 26 VESTIGES OF MR. OXLEY'S ENCAMPMENT. /page-->the
same ground, and could not discern the waters in its channel; so
much had they fallen below their ordinary level. He saw the river
when it was overflowing its banks; on the present occasion it had
scarcely sufficient water to support a current. On the summit of
the greater eminence, which we ascended, there remained the
half-burnt planks of a boat, some clenched and rusty nails, and
an old trunk; but my search for the bottle Mr. Oxley had left was
unsuccessful. </p>

<p>A reflection naturally arose to my mind on examining these
decaying vestiges of a former expedition, whether I should be
more fortunate than the leader of it, and how far I should be
enabled to penetrate beyond the point which had conquered his
perseverance. Only a week before I left Sydney I had followed Mr.
Oxley to the tomb. A man of uncommon quickness, and of great
ability, the task of following up his discoveries was not less
enviable than arduous; but, arrived at that point at which his
journey may be said to have terminated and mine only to commence,
I knew not how soon I should be obliged, like him, to retreat
from the marshes and exhalations of so depressed a country. My
eye instinctively turned to the North-West, and the view extended
over an apparently endless forest. I could trace the river line
of trees by their superior height; but saw no appearance of
reeds, save the few that grew on the banks of the stream. </p>

<p>Mount Foster, somewhat higher than Mount Harris, on the
opposite side of the river, alone broke the line of the <!--page 27 ILLNESS OF TWO OF THE MEN. /page-->horizon
to the North N.W. at a distance of five miles. From that point
all round the compass, the low lands spread, like a dark sea,
before me; except where a large plain stretching from E. to W.,
and lying to the S.E. broke their monotony; and if there was
nothing discouraging, there certainly was nothing cheering, in
the prospect. </p>

<p>On our return to the camp, I was vexed to find two of the men,
Henwood and Williams, with increased inflammation of the eyes, of
which they had previously been complaining, and I thought it
advisable to bleed the latter. </p>

<p>In consequence of the indisposition of these men, we remained
stationary on the 21st, which enabled me to pay a second visit to
Mount Harris. On ascending the smaller hill, I was surprised to
find similar vestiges on its summit to those I had noticed on the
larger one; in addition to which, the rollers still continued on
the side of the hill, which had been used to get the boat up it.*
<span class="note">[Mr. Oxley had two boats; one of which he dragged to the top of
each of these hills, and left them turned bottom upwards, buryinq
a bottle under the head of the larger boat, which was conveyed to
the more distant hill.]</span> </p>

<p>Mount Harris is of basaltic formation, but I could not observe
any columnar regularity in it, although large blocks are exposed
above the ground. The rock is extremely hard and sonorous. </p>

<p>We moved leisurely towards Mount Foster, on the 22nd, and
arrived opposite to it a little before sunset. The country
between the two is mostly open, or covered only with the acacia
pendula and dwarf-box. The soil, although an <!--page 28 MOUNT FOSTER AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD. /page-->alluvial deposit, is
not of the best; nor was vegetation either fresh or close upon
it. As soon as the party stopped, I crossed the river, and lost
no time in ascending the hill, being anxious to ascertain if any
fresh object was visible from its summit, I thought that from an
eminence so much above the level of the surrounding objects, I
might obtain a view of the marshes, or of water; but I was wholly
disappointed. The view was certainly extensive, but it was
otherwise unsatisfactory. Again to the N.W. the lowlands spread
in darkness before me; there were some considerable plains beyond
the near wood; but the country at the foot of the hill appeared
open and promising. Although the river line was lost in the
distance, it was as truly pointed out by the fires of the
natives, which rose in upright columns into the sky, as if it had
been marked by the trees upon its banks. </p>

<p>To the eastward, Arbuthnot's range rose high above the line of
the horizon, bearing nearly due East, distant seventy miles. The
following sketch of its outlines will convey a better idea of its
appearance from Mount Foster than any written description.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="e00059-images/xpssti16.jpg" alt="small sketch showing the ranges">
</p>

<p>I stayed on the mount until after sunset, but I could not make
out any space that at all resembled the formidable barrier I knew
we were so rapidly approaching. I saw nothing to check our
advance, and I therefore returned to the camp, to advise with Mr.
Hume upon the subject. Not <!--page 29 MOUNT FOSTER AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD. /page-->having been with me on Mount Foster,
he took the opportunity to ascend it on the following morning;
and on his return concurred with me in opinion, that there was no
apparent obstacle to our moving onwards. As the men were
considerably better, I had the less hesitation in closing with
the marshes. We left our position, intending to travel slowly,
and to halt early. </p>

<p>The first part of our journey was over rich flats, timbered
sufficiently to afford a shade, on which the grass was luxuriant;
but we were obliged to seek more open ground, in consequence of
the frequent stumbling of the cattle. </p>

<p>We issued, at length, upon a plain, the view across which was
as dreary as can be imagined; in many places without a tree, save
a few old stumps left by the natives when they fired the timber,
some of which were still smoking in different parts of it.
Observing some lofty trees at the extremity of the plain, we
moved towards them, under an impression that they indicated the
river line. But on this exposed spot the sun's rays fell with
intense power upon us, and the dust was so minute and
penetrating, that I soon regretted having left the shady banks of
the river. </p>

<p>About 2.p.m. we neared the trees for which we had been making,
over ground evidently formed by alluvial deposition, and were
astonished to find that reeds alone were growing under the trees
as far as the eye could penetrate. It appeared that we were still
some distance from the river, and it was very doubtful how far we
might be from water, for which the men were anxiously calling. I
therefore halted, <!--page 30 ENCAMP AMIDST REEDS. /page-->and sent Fraser into the reeds towards some
dead trees, on which a number of spoonbills were sitting. He
found that there was a small lake in the centre of the reeds, the
resort of numerous wild fowl; but although the men were enabled
to quench their thirst, we found it impossible to water the
animals. We were obliged, therefore, to continue our course along
the edge of the reeds; which in a short time appeared in large
masses in front of us, stretching into a vast plain upon our
right; and it became evident that the whole neighbourhood was
subject to extensive inundation. </p>

<p>I was fearful that the reeds would have checked us; but there
was a passage between the patches, through which we managed to
force our way into a deep bight, and fortunately gained the river
at the bottom of it much sooner than we expected. We were obliged
to clear away a space for the tents; and thus, although there had
been no such appearance from Mount Foster, we found ourselves in
less than seven hours after leaving it, encamped pretty far in
that marsh for which we had so anxiously looked from its summit,
and now trusting to circumstances for safety, upon ground on
which, in any ordinary state of the river, it would have been
dangerous to have ventured. Indeed, as it was, our situation was
sufficiently critical, and would not admit of hesitation on my
part. </p>

<p>After the cattle had been turned out, Mr. Hume and I again
mounted our horses, and proceeded to the westward, with a view to
examine the nature of the country before us, and to ascertain if
it was still practicable to move along the <!--page 31 NATURE OF THE COUNTRY. /page-->river side. For,
although it was evident that we had arrived at what might
strictly be called the marshes of the Macquarie, I still thought
we might be at some distance from the place where Mr. Oxley
terminated his journey. </p>

<p>There was no indication in the river to encourage an idea that
it would speedily terminate; nor, although we were on ground
subject to extensive inundation, could we be said to have reached
the heart of the marshes, as the reeds still continued in
detached bodies only. We forced a path through various portions
of them, and passed over ground wholly subject to flood, to a
distance of about six miles. We then crossed a small rise of
ground, sufficiently high to have afforded a retreat, had
necessity obliged us to seek for one; and we shortly afterwards
descended on the river, unaltered in its appearance, and rather
increased than diminished in size. A vast plain extended to the
N.W., the extremity of which we could not discern; though a thick
forest formed its northern boundary. </p>

<p>It was evident that this plain had been frequently under
water, but it was difficult to judge from the marks on the trees
to what height the floods had risen. The soil was an alluvial
deposit, superficially sandy; and many shells were scattered over
its surface. To the south, the country appeared close and low;
nor do I think we could have approached the river from that side,
by reason of the huge belts of reeds that appeared to extend as
far as the the eye could reach. </p>

<p>The approach of night obliged us to return to the camp. On our
arrival, we found that the state of Henwood and <!--page 32 MEN ATTACKED WITH OPHTHALMIA. /page-->Williams would
prevent our stirring for a day or two. Not only had they a return
of inflammation, but several other of the men complained of a
painful irritation of the eyes, which were dreadfully blood-shot
and weak. I was in some measure prepared for a relapse in
Henwood, as the exposure which he necessarily underwent on the
plain was sufficient to produce that effect; but I now became
apprehensive that the affection would run through the party. </p>

<p>Considering our situation in its different bearings, it struck
me that the men who were to return to Wellington Valley with an
account our our proceedings for the Governor's information, had
been brought as far as prudence warranted. There was no fear of
their going astray, as long as they had the river to guide them;
but in the open country which we were to all appearance
approaching, or amidst fields of reeds, they might wander from
the track, and irrecoverably lose themselves. I determined,
therefore, not to risk their safety, but to prepare my dispatches
for Sydney, and I hoped most anxiously, that ere they were
closed, all symptoms of disease would have terminated. </p>

<p>In the course of the day, however, Spencer, who was to return
with Riley to Wellington Valley, became seriously indisposed, and
I feared that he was attacked with dysentery. Indeed, I should
have attributed his illness to our situation, but I did not
notice any unusual moisture in the atmosphere, nor did any fogs
rise from the river. I therefore the rather attributed it to
exposure and change of diet, <!--page 33 DEPARTURE OF TWO MEN FOR WELLINGTON. /page-->and treated him accordingly. To my
satisfaction, when I visited the men late in the evening, I found
a general improvement in the whole of them. Spencer was
considerably relieved, and those of the party who had
inflammation of the eyes no longer felt that painful irritation
of which they had before complained. I determined, therefore,
unless untoward circumstances should prevent it, to send Riley
and his companion homewards, and to move the party without loss
of time. </p>

<p>We had not seen any natives for many days, but a few passed
the camp on the opposite side of the river on the evening of the
25th. They would not, however, come to us; but fled into the
interior in great apparent alarm. </p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th, the men were sufficiently
recovered to pursue their journey. Riley and Spencer left us at
an early hour; and about 7 a.m. we pursued a N.N.W. course along
the great plain I have noticed, starting numberless quails, and
many wild turkeys, by the way. Leaving that part of the river on
which Mr. Hume and I had touched considerably to the left, we
made for the point of a wood, projecting from the river line of
trees into the plain. The ground under us was an alluvial
deposit, and bore all the marks of frequent inundation. </p>

<p>The soil was yielding, blistered, and uneven; and the claws of
cray-fish, together with numerous small shells, were every where
collected in the hollows made by the subsiding of the waters,
between broad belts of reeds and scrubs of polygonum. <!--page 34 CONSULTATION. /page--> </p>

<p>On gaining the point of the wood, we found an absolute check
put to our further progress. We had been moving directly on the
great body of the marsh, and from the wood it spread in boundless
extent before us. It was evidently lower than the ground on which
we stood; we had therefore, a complete view over the whole
expanse; and there was a dreariness and desolation pervading the
scene that strengthened as we gazed upon it. Under existing
circumstances, it only remained for us either to skirt the reeds
to the northward, or to turn in again upon the river; and as I
considered it important to ascertain the direction of the
Macquarie at so critical and interesting a point, I thought it
better to adopt the latter measure. We, accordingly, made for the
river, and pitched our tents, as at the last station, in the
midst of reeds. </p>

<p>There were two points at this time, upon which I was extremely
anxious. The first was as to the course of the river; the second,
as to the extent of the marshes by which we had been checked, and
the practicability of the country to the northward. </p>

<p>In advising with Mr. Hume, I proposed launching the boat, as
the surest means of ascertaining the former, and he, on his part,
most readily volunteered to examine the marshes, in any direction
I should point out. It was therefore, arranged, that I should
take two men, and a week's provision with me in the boat down the
river; and that he should proceed with a like number of men on an
excursion to the northward. <!--page 35 BOAT EXCURSION. /page--> </p>

<p>After having given directions as to the regulations of camp
during our absence, we separated, on the morning of the 26th for
the first time, in furtherance of the objects each had in view. </p>

<p>In pulling down the river, I found that its channel was at
first extremely tortuous and irregular, but that it held a
general N.W. course, and bore much the same appearance as it had
done since our descent from Mount Foster. </p>

<p>We had a laborious task in lifting the boat over the trunks of
trees that had fallen into the channel of the river or that had
been left by the floods, and at length we stove her in upon a
sunken log. The injury she received was too serious not to
require immediate repair; and we, therefore, patched her up with
a tin plate. This accident occasioned some delay, and the morning
was consumed without our having made any considerable progress.
At length, however, we got into a more open channel. </p>

<p>The river suddenly increased in breadth to thirty-five or
forty-five yards, with a depth of from twelve to twenty feet of
water. Its banks shelved perpendicularly down, and were almost on
a level with the surface of the stream; and the flood mark was
not more than two feet high on the reeds by which they were
lined. We had hitherto passed under the shade of the flooded gum,
which still continued on the immediate banks of the river; but,
the farther we advanced, the more did we find these trees in a
state of decay, until at length they ceased, or were only rarely
met with. </p>

<p>About 2 p.m. I brought up under a solitary tree, in con<!--page 36 TERMINATION OF THE RIVER. /page-->sequence
of heavy rain: this was upon the left bank. In the afternoon,
however, we again pushed forward, and soon lost sight of every
other object amidst reeds of great height. The channel of the
river continued as broad and as deep as ever, but the flood mark
did not show more than a foot above the banks, which were now
almost on a level with the water; and the current was so sluggish
as to be scarcely perceptible. These general appearances
continued for about three miles, when our course was suddenly,
and most unexpectedly, checked. The channel, which had promised
so well, without any change in its breadth or depth, ceased
altogether; and whilst we were yet lost in astonishment at so
abrupt a termination of it, the boat grounded. It only remained
for us to examine the banks, which we did with particular
attention. Two creeks were then discovered, so small as scarcely
to deserve the name, and which would, under ordinary
circumstances, have been overlooked. The one branched off to the
north&mdash;the other to the west. We were obliged to get out
of the boat to push up the former, the leeches sticking in
numbers to our legs. The creek continued for about thirty yards,
when it was terminated; and, in order fully to satisfy myself of
the fact, I walked round the head of it by pushing through the
reeds. Night coming on, we returned to the tree at which we had
stopped during the rain, and slept under it. The men cut away the
reeds, or we should not have had room to move. At 2 a.m. it
commenced raining, with a heavy storm of thunder and lightning;
the <!--page 37 FIRST GREAT MARSH. /page-->boat was consequently hauled ashore, and turned over to
afford us a temporary shelter. The lightning was extremely vivid,
and frequently played upon the ground, near the firelocks, for
more than a quarter of a minute at a time. </p>

<p>It is singular, that Mr. Oxley should, under similar
circumstances, have experienced an equally stormy night, and most
probably within a few yards of the place on which I had posted
myself. Notwithstanding that the elements were raging around me,
as if to warn me of the danger of my situation, my mind turned
solely on the singular failure of the river. I could not but
encourage hopes that this second channel that remained to be
explored would lead us into an open space again; and as soon as
the morning dawned we pursued our way to it. In passing some dead
trees upon the right bank, I stopped to ascend one, that, from an
elevation, I might survey the marsh, but I found it impossible to
trace the river through it. The country to the westward was
covered with reeds, apparently to the distance of seven miles; to
the N.W. to a still greater distance; and to the north they
bounded the horizon. </p>

<p>The whole expanse was level and unbroken, but here and there
the reeds were higher and darker than at other places, as if they
grew near constant moisture; but I could see no appearance of
water in any body, or of high lands beyond the distant forest. </p>

<p>As soon as we arrived at the end of the main channel, we again
got out of the boat, and in pushing up the smaller one, soon
found ourselves under a dark arch of reeds. <!--page 38 CAUSES OF THE FAILURE OF THE RIVER. /page-->It did not, however,
continue more than twenty yards when it ceased, and I walked
round the head of it as I had done round that of the other. We
then examined the space between the creeks, where the bank
receives the force of the current, which I did not doubt had
formed them by the separation of its eddies. Observing water
among the reeds, I pushed through them with infinite labour to a
considerable distance. The soil proved to be a stiff clay; the
reeds were closely embodied, and from ten to twelve feet high;
the waters were in some places ankle deep, and in others scarcely
covered the surface. They were flowing in different points, with
greater speed than those of the river, which at once convinced me
that they were not permanent, but must have lodged in the night
during which so much rain had fallen. They ultimately appeared to
flow to the northward, but I found it impossible to follow them,
and it was not without difficulty that, after having wandered
about at every point of the compass, I again reached the boat. </p>

<p>The care with which I had noted every change that took place
in the Macquarie, from Wellington Valley downwards, enabled me,
in some measure, to account for its present features. I was led
to conclude that the waters of the river being so small in body,
excepting in times of flood, and flowing for so many miles
through a level country without receiving any tributary to
support their first impulse, became too sluggish, long ere they
reached the marshes, to cleave through so formidable a barrier;
and consequently spread over the surrounding
country&mdash;whether again to take <!--page 39 MR. HUME'S REPORT. /page-->up the character of a
river, we had still to determine. Unless, however, a decline of
country should favour its assuming its original shape, it was
evident that the Macquarie would not be found to exist beyond
this marsh, of the nature and extent of which we were still
ignorant. The loss of my barometer was at this time severely felt
by me, since I could only guess at our probable height above the
ocean; and I found that my only course was to endeavour to force
my way to the northward, to ascertain, if I could, from the
bottom of the marshes; then penetrate in a westerly direction
beyond them, in order to commence my survey of the S.W. interior.
I was aware of Mr. Hume's perseverance, and determined,
therefore, to wait the result of his report ere I again moved the
camp, to which we returned late in the afternoon of the second
day of our departure. We found it unsufferably hot and
suffocating in the reeds, and were tormented by myriads of
mosquitoes, but the waters were perfectly sweet to the taste, nor
did the slightest smell, as of stagnation, proceed from them. I
may add that the birds, whose sanctuary we had invaded, as the
bittern and various tribes of the galinule, together with the
frogs, made incessant noises around us, There were, however, but
few water-fowl on the river; which was an additional proof to me
that we were not near any very extensive lake. </p>

<p>Mr. Hume had returned before me to the camp, and had succeeded
in finding a serpentine sheet of water, about twelve miles to the
northward; which he did not doubt to be the channel of the river.
He had pushed on after this <!--page 40 FALSE CHANNEL. /page-->success, in the hope of gaining a
further knowledge of the country; but another still more
extensive marsh checked him, and obliged him to retrace his
steps. He was no less surprised at the account I gave of the
termination of the river, than I was at its so speedily
re-forming, and it was determined to lose no time in the further
examination of so singular a region. </p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th therefore we broke up the camp, and
proceeded to the northward, under Mr. Hume's guidance, moving
over ground wholly subject to flood, and extensively covered with
reeds; the great body of the marsh lying upon our left. After
passing the angle of a wood, upon our right, from which Mount
Foster was distant about fourteen miles, we got upon a small
plain, on which there was a new species of tortuous box. This
plain was clear of reeds, and the soil upon it was very rich.
Crossing in a westerly direction we arrived at the channel found
by Mr. Hume, who must naturally have concluded that it was a
continuation of the river. The boat was immediately prepared, and
I went up it in order to ascertain the nature of its formation.
For two miles it preserved a pretty general width of from twenty
to thirty yards; but at that distance began to narrow, and at
length it became quite shallow and covered with weeds. We were
ultimately obliged to abandon the boat, and to walk along a
native path. The country to the westward was more open than I had
expected. About a quarter of a mile from where we had left the
boat, the channel separated into two <!--page 41 PERPLEXITIES. /page-->branches; to which I
perceived it owed its formation, coming, as they evidently did,
direct from the heart of the marsh. The wood through which I had
entered it on the first occasion bore south of me, to which one
of the branches inclined; as the other did to the S.W. An almost
imperceptible rise of ground was before me, which, by giving an
impetus to the waters of the marsh, accounted to me for the
formation of the main channel. It was too late, on my return to
the camp, to prosecute any further examination of it downwards;
but in the morning, Mr. Hume accompanied me in the boat, to
ascertain to what point it led; and we found that at about a mile
it began to diminish in breadth, until at length it was
completely lost in a second expanse of reeds. We passed a
singular scaffolding erected by the natives, on the side of the
channel, to take fish; and also found a weir at the termination
of it for the like purpose so that it was evident the natives
occasionally ventured into the marshes. </p>

<p>There was a small wood to our left which Mr. Hume endeavoured
to gain, but he failed in the attempt. He did, however, reach a
tree that was sufficiently high to give him a full view of the
marsh, which appeared to extend in every direction, but more
particularly to the north, for many miles. We were, however, at
fault, and I really felt at a loss what step to take. I should
have been led to believe from the extreme flatness of the
country, that the Macquarie would never assume its natural shape,
but from the direction of the marshes I could not but indulge a
hope that it <!--page 42 EXCURSION TO THE NORTH-WEST. /page-->would meet the Castlereagh, and that their united
waters might form a stream of some importance. Under this
impression I determined on again sending Mr. Hume to the N.E. in
order to ascertain the nature of the country in that direction. </p>

<p>The weather was excessively hot, and as my men were but slowly
recovering, I was anxious while those who were in health
continued active, to give the others a few days of rest. I
proposed, therefore, to cross the river, and to make an excursion
into the interior, during the probable time of Mr. Hume's
absence; since if, as I imagined, the Macquarie had taken a
permanent northerly course, I should not have an opportunity of
examining the distant western country. Mr. Hume's experience
rendered it unnecessary for me to give him other than general
directions. </p>

<p>On the last day of the year we left the camp, each accompanied
by two men. I had the evening previously ordered the horses I
intended taking with me across the channel, and at an early hour
of the morning I followed them. Getting on a plain, immediately
after I had disengaged myself from the reeds on the opposite side
of the river, which was full of holes and exceedingly treacherous
for the animals, I pushed on for a part of the wood Mr. Hume had
endeavoured to gain from the boat, with the intention of keeping
near the marsh. On entering it, I found myself in a thick brush
of eucalypti, casuarinae and minor trees; the soil under them
being mixed with sand. I kept a N.N.W. course through it, and at
the distance of three miles from <!--page 43 A PLAIN ON FIRE. /page-->its commencement, ascended a
tree, to ascertain if I was near the marshes; when I found that I
was fast receding from them. I concluded, therefore, that my
conjecture as to their direction was right, and altered my course
to N.W., a direction in which I had observed a dense smoke
arising, which I supposed had been made by some natives near
water. At the termination of the brush I crossed a barren sandy
plain, and from it saw the smoke ascending at a few miles'
distance from me. Passing through a wood, at the extremity of the
plain, I found myself at the outskirts of an open space of great
extent, almost wholly enveloped in flames. The fire was running
with incredible rapidity through the rhagodia shrubs with which
it was covered. Passing quickly over it, I continued my journey
to the N.W. over barren plains of red sandy loam of even surface,
and bushes of cypresses skirted by acacia pendula. It was not
until after sunset that we struck upon a creek, in which the
water was excellent; and we halted on its banks for the night,
calculating our distance at twenty-nine miles from the camp. The
creek was of considerable size, leading northerly. Several huts
were observed by us, and from the heaps of muscle-shells that
were scattered about, there could be no doubt of its being much
frequented by the natives. The grass being fairly burnt up, our
animals found but little to eat, but they had a tolerable
journey. and did not attempt to wander in search of better food.
I shot a snipe near the creek, much resembling the painted snipe
of India; but I had not the means with me of preserving it. <!--page 44 A TRIBE OF NATIVES. /page--> </p>

<p>Continuing our journey on the following morning, we at first
kept on the banks of the creek, and at about a quarter of a mile
from where we had slept, came upon a numerous tribe of natives. A
young girl sitting by the fire was the first to observe us as we
were slowly approaching her. She was so excessively alarmed, that
she had not the power to run away; but threw herself on the
ground and screamed violently. We now observed a number of huts,
out of which the natives issued, little dreaming of the spectacle
they were to behold. But the moment they saw us, they started
back; their huts were in a moment in flames, and each with a
fire-brand ran to and fro with hideous yells, thrusting them into
every bush they passed. I walked my horse quietly towards an old
man who stood more forward than the rest, as if he intended to
devote himself for the preservation of his tribe. I had intended
speaking to him, but on a nearer approach I remarked that he
trembled so violently that it was impossible to expect that I
could obtain any information from him, and as I had not time for
explanations, I left him to form his own conjectures as to what
we were, and continued to move towards a thick brush, into which
they did not venture to follow us. </p>

<p>After a ride of about eighteen miles, through a country of
alternate plain and brush, we struck upon a second creek leading
like the first to the northward. The water in it was very bitter
and muddy, and it was much inferior in appearance to that at
which we had slept. After stopping for half-an-hour upon its
banks, to rest our animals, we again <!--page 45 CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY. /page-->pushed forward. We had not
as yet risen any perceptible height above the level of the
marshes, but had left the country subject to overflow for a
considerable space behind us. The brushes through which we had
passed were too sandy to retain water long, but the plains were
of such an even surface, that they could not but continue wet for
a considerable period after any fall of rain. They were covered
with salsolaceous plants, without a blade of grass; and their
soil was generally a red sandy loam. There were occasional
patches that appeared moist, in which the calystemma was
abundant, and these patches must, I should imagine, form
quagmires in the wet season. </p>

<p>On leaving the last-mentioned creek, we found a gently rising
country before us; and about three or four miles from it we
crossed some stony ridges, covered with a new species of acacia
so thickly as to prevent our obtaining any view from them. As the
sun declined, we got into open forest ground; and travelled
forwards in momentary expectation, from appearances, of coming in
sight of water; but we were obliged to pull up at sunset on the
outskirts of a larger plain without having our expectation
realized. The day had been extremely warm, and our animals were
as thirsty as ourselves. Hope never forsakes the human breast;
and thence it was that, after we had secured the horses, we began
to wander round our lonely bivouac. It was almost dark, when one
of my men came to inform me that he had found a small puddle of
water, to which be had been led by a pigeon. <!--page 46 ISOLATED HILL. /page--> </p>

<p>It was, indeed, small enough, probably the remains of a
passing shower; it was, however, sufficient for our necessities,
and I thanked Providence for its bounty to us. We were now about
sixty miles from the Macquarie, in a N.W. by W. direction, and
the country had proved so extremely discouraging, that I
intimated to my men my intention of retracing my steps, should I
not discover any change in it before noon on the morrow. A dense
brush of acacia succeeded to the plain on which we had slept,
which we entered, and shortly afterwards found ourselves in an
open space, of oblong shape, at the extremity of which there was
a shallow lake. The brush completely encircled it, and a few huts
were upon its banks. About 10 p.m. we got into an open forest
track of better appearance than any over which we had recently
travelled. </p>

<p>There was a visible change in the country, and the soil,
although red, was extremely rich and free from sand. A short time
afterwards we rose to the summit of a round hill, from which we
obtained an extensive view on most points of the compass. We had
imperceptibly risen considerably above the general level of the
interior. </p>

<p>Beneath us, to the westward, I observed a broad and thinly
wooded valley; and W. by S., distant apparently about twenty
miles, an isolated mountain, whose sides seemed almost
perpendicular, broke the otherwise even line of the horizon; but
the country in every other direction looked as if it was darkly
wooded. Anticipating that I should find a stream in the valley, I
did not for a moment hesitate in <!--page 47 VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT. /page-->striking down into it.
Disappointed, however, in this expectation, I continued onwards
to the mountain, which I reached just before the sun set. Indeed,
he was barely visible when I gained its summit; but my eyes, from
exposure to his glare, became so weak, my face was so blistered,
and my lips cracked in so many places, that I was unable to look
towards the west, and was actually obliged to sit down behind a
rock until he had set. </p>

<p>Perhaps no time is so favourable for a view along the horizon
as the sunset hour; and here, at an elevation of from five to six
hundred feet above the plain, the visible line of it could not
have been less than from thirty-five to forty-five miles. The
hill upon which I stood was broken into two points; the one was a
bold rocky elevation; the other had its rear face also
perpendicular, but gradually declined to the north, and at a
distance of from four to five miles was lost in an extensive and
open plain in that direction. In the S.E. quarter, two wooded
hills were visible, which before had appeared to be nothing more
than swells in the general level of the country. A small hill,
similar to the above, bore N.E. by compass; and again, to the
west, a more considerable mountain than that I had ascended, and
evidently much higher, reflected the last beams of the sun as he
sunk behind them. I looked, however, in vain for water. I could
not trace either the windings of a stream, or the course of a
mountain torrent; and, as we had passed a swamp about a mile from
the hill, we descended to it for the night, during which we were
grievously tormented by the mosquitoes. <!--page 48 RESULTS OF THE EXCURSION. /page--> </p>

<p>I had no inducement to proceed further into the interior. I
had been sufficiently disappointed in the termination of this
excursion, and the track before me was still less inviting.
Nothing but a dense forest, and a level country, existed between
me and the distant hill. I had learnt, by experience, that it was
impossible to form any opinion of the probable features of so
singular a region as that in which I was wandering, from previous
appearances, or to expect the same result, as in other countries,
from similar causes. In a geographical point of view, my journey
had been more successful, and had enabled me to put to rest for
ever a question of much previous doubt. Of whatever extent the
marshes of the Macquarie might be, it was evident they were not
connected with those of the Lachlan. I had gained knowledge of
more than 100 miles of the western interior, and had ascertained
that no sea, indeed that little water, existed on its surface;
and that, although it is generally flat, it still has elevations
of considerable magnitude upon it. </p>

<p>Although I had passed over much barren ground, I had likewise
noticed soil that was far from poor, and the vegetation upon
which in ordinary seasons would, I am convinced, have borne a
very different aspect. </p>

<p>Yet, upon the whole, the space I traversed is unlikely to
become the haunt of civilized man, or will only become so in
isolated spots, as a chain of connection to a more fertile
country; if such a country exist to the westward. </p>

<p>The hill which thus became the extreme of my journey, <!--page 49 RETURN TO THE CAMP. /page-->is of
sandstone formation, and is bold and precipitous. Its summit is
level and lightly timbered. As a tribute of respect to the late
Surveyor-General, I called it Oxley's Table Land, and I named the
distant hills D'Urban's Group, after Sir Benjamin D'Urban, in
compliance with a previous request of my friend Lieut. De la
Condamine, that I would so name any prominent feature of the
interior that I might happen to come upon. </p>

<p>In returning to the camp, I made a circuit to the N.E., and
reached the Macquarie late on the evening of the 5th of January;
having been absent six days, during which we could not have
ridden less than 200 miles. Yet the horses were not so fatigued
as it was natural to expect they would have been. </p>

<p>My servant informed me that a party of natives had visited the
camp on the 3rd, but that they retired precipitately on seeing
the animals. I regretted to find the men but little better than
when I left them. Several still complained of a painful
irritation of the eyes, and of great weakness of sight.
Attributing their continued indisposition in some measure to our
situation, I was anxious to have moved from it; but as Mr. Hume
was still absent, I could not decide upon the measure. He made
his appearance, however, on the 6th, having ridden the greater
part of the day through rain, which commenced to fall in the
morning. Soon after his arrival, Dawber, my overseer of animals,
who had accompanied him, was taken suddenly ill. During the night
he became much worse, with shivering and spasms, and on the <!--page 50 MR. HUME'S EXCURSION. /page-->following
morning he was extremely weak and feverish. To add to my anxiety,
Mr. Hume also complained of indisposition. His state of health
made me the more anxious to quit a position which I fancied
unwholesome, and in which, if there was no apparent, there was
certainly some secret, exciting cause; and as Mr. Hume reported
having crossed a chain of ponds about four miles to the eastward,
and out of the immediate precincts of the marshes, I ordered the
tents to be struck, and placing Dawber on my horse, we all moved
quietly over to them. </p>

<p>The result of Mr. Hume's journey perplexed me exceedingly. He
stated, that on setting out from the Macquarie his intention was
to have proceeded to the N.E., to ascertain how far the reeds
existed in that direction, and, if at all practicable, to reach
the Castlereagh; but in case of failure, to regain the Macquarie
by a westerly course. At first he travelled nearly four miles
east, to clear the marshes, when he came on the chain of ponds to
which we had removed. </p>

<p>He travelled over good soil for two miles after crossing this
chain of ponds, but afterwards got on a red sandy loam, and found
it difficult to proceed, by reason of the thickness of the brush,
and the swampy state of the ground in consequence of the late
rain. </p>

<p>The timber in the brushes was of various kinds, and he saw
numerous kangaroos and emus. On issuing from this brush, he
crossed a creek, leading northerly, the banks of which were from
ten to twelve feet high. Whatever the <!--page 51 MR. HUME'S EXCURSION. /page-->body of water usually in it
is, it now only afforded a few shallow puddles. Mr. Hume
travelled through brushes until he came upon a third creek,
similar to the one he had left behind him, at which he halted for
the night. The water in it was bad, and the feed for the animals
extremely poor. The brush lined the creek thickly, and consisted
chiefly of acacia pendula and box. The country preserved an
uniform level, nor did Mr. Hume, from the highest trees, observe
any break on the horizon. </p>

<p>On the 2nd of January, Mr. Hume kept more northerly, being
unable to penetrate the brushes he encountered. At two miles he
crossed a creek leading to the N.W., between which and the place
at which he had slept, he passed a native burial ground,
containing eight graves. The earth was piled up in a conical
shape, but the trees were not carved over as he had seen them in
most other places. </p>

<p>The country became more open after he had passed the last
mentioned creek, which he again struck upon at the distance of
eight miles, and as it was then leading to the N.N.E. he followed
it down for eighteen or twenty miles, and crossed it frequently
during the day. The creek was dry in most places, and where he
stopped for the night the water was bad, and the cattle feed
indifferent. </p>

<p>Mr. Hume saw many huts, but none of them had been recently
occupied, although large quantities of muscle-shells were
scattered about. He computed that he had travelled about thirty
miles, in a N.N.W. direction, and the whole of the land he passed
over was, generally <!--page 52 MR. HUME'S EXCURSION. /page-->speaking, bad, nor did it appear to be
subject to overflow. </p>

<p>On the 3rd, Mr. Hume proceeded down the creek on which he had
slept, on a northern course, under an impression that it would
have joined the Castlereagh, but it took a N.W. direction after
he had ridden about four miles, and then turned again to the
eastward of north. In consequence of this, he left it, and
proceeded to the westward, being of opinion that the river just
mentioned must have taken a more northerly course than Mr. Oxley
supposed it to have done. </p>

<p>A short time after Mr. Hume turned towards the Macquarie, the
country assumed a more pleasing appearance. He soon cleared the
brushes, and at two miles came upon a chain of ponds, again
running northerly in times of flood. Shortly after crossing
these, he found himself on an extensive plain, apparently subject
to overflow. The timber on it was chiefly of the blue-gum kind,
and the ground was covered with shells. He then thought he was
approaching the Macquarie, and proceeded due west across the flat
for about two miles. At the extremity of it there was a hollow,
which he searched in vain for water. Ascending about thirty feet,
he entered a thick brush of box and acacia pendula, which
continued for fourteen miles, when it terminated abruptly, and
extensive plains of good soil commenced, stretching from N. to S.
as far as the eye could reach, on which there were many
kangaroos. Continuing to journey over them, he reached a creek at
5 p.m. <!--page 53 MR. HUME'S EXCURSION. /page-->on which the wild fowl were numerous, running nearly north
and south, and he rested on its banks for the night. The timber
consisted both of blue and rough gum, and the soil was a light
earth. </p>

<p>Mr. Hume expected in the course of the day to have reached the
Macquarie, but on arriving at the creek, he began to doubt
whether it any longer existed, or whether it had not taken a more
westerly direction. On the following morning, therefore, he
crossed the creek, and travelled W.S.W., for about two miles over
good plains; then through light brushes of swamp-oak, cypress,
box, and acacia pendula, for about twelve miles, to another creek
leading northerly. He shortly afterwards ascended a range of
hills stretching W.N.W. to which he gave the name of New Year's
Range. From these hills, he had an extensive view, although not
upon the highest part, but the only break he could see in the
horizon was caused by some hills bearing by compass W. by S.
distant about twenty-five miles. There was, however, an
appearance as of high land to the northward, although Mr. Hume
thought it might have been an atmospheric deception. From the
range he looked in vain for the Macquarie, or other waters, and,
as his provisions were nearly consumed, he was obliged to give up
all further pursuit, and to retrace his steps. He fell in with
two parties of natives, which, taken collectively, amounted to
thirty-five in number, but had no communication with them. </p>

<p>It was evident, from the above account, that supposing a <!--page 54 DOUBTS OF THE FURTHER EXTENSION OF THE RIVER. /page-->line
to have been drawn from the camp northerly, Mr. Hume must have
travelled considerably to the westward of it, and as I had run on
a N.W. course from the marshes, it necessarily followed that our
lines of route must have intersected each other, or that want of
extension could alone have prevented them from having done so;
but that, under any circumstances, they could not have been very
far apart. This was too important a point to be left undecided,
as upon it the question of the Macquarie's termination seemed to
depend. </p>

<p>Both Mr. Hume and myself were of opinion, that a medium course
would be the most satisfactory for us to pursue, to decide this
point; and it appeared that we could not do better than, by
availing ourselves of the creek on which we were, and skirting
the reeds, to take the first opportunity of dashing through them
in a westerly direction. </p>

<p>I entertained great doubts as to the longer existence of the
river, and as I foresaw that, in the event of its having
terminated we should strike at once into the heart of the
interior, I became anxious for the arrival of supplies at Mount
Harris; and although I could hardly expect that they had yet
reached it, I determined to proceed thither. Mr. Hume was too
unwell for me to think of imposing additional fatigue upon him; I
left him, therefore, to conduct the party, by easy stages, to the
northward, until such time as I should overtake them. Even in one
day there was a visible improvement in the men, and Dawber's
attack seemed to be rather the effects of cold than of any thing <!--page 55 PERPLEXING SITUATION. /page-->else.
A death, however, under our circumstances, would have been so
truly deplorable an event, that the least illness was sufficient
to create alarm. </p>

<p>I can hardly say that I was disappointed on my arrival at
Mount Harris, to find its neighbourhood silent and deserted. I
remained, however, under it for the greater part of the next day,
and, prior to leaving it, placed a sheet of paper with written
instructions against a tree, though almost without a hope that it
would remain untouched. </p>

<p>A little after sun-set we reached the first small marsh, at
which we slept; and on the following morning I crossed the plains
of the Macquarie, and joined the party at about fifteen miles
from the creek at which I had left it. I found it in a condition
that was as unlooked for by Mr. Hume as it was unexpected by me,
and really in a most perplexing situation. </p>

<p>On the day I left him, Mr. Hume only advanced about two miles,
in consequence of some derangement in the loads. Having crossed
the creek, he, the next morning, proceeded down its right bank,
until it entered the marshes and was lost. He then continued to
move on the outskirts of the latter, and having performed a
journey or about eight miles, was anxious to have stopped, but
there was no water at hand. The men, however, were so fatigued,
in consequence of previous illness, that he felt it necessary to
halt after travelling about eleven miles. </p>

<p>No water could be procured even here, notwithstanding that Mr.
Hume, who was quite unfit for great exertion, under<!--page 56 JOURNEY CONTINUED. /page-->went
considerable bodily fatigue in his anxiety to find some. He was,
therefore, obliged to move early on the following morning, but
neither men nor animals were in a condition to travel; and he had
scarcely made three miles' progress, when he stopped and
endeavoured to obtain a supply or water by digging pits among the
reeds. From these he had drawn sufficient for the wants of the
people when I arrived. Some rain had fallen on the 6th and 7th of
the month, or it is more than probable the expedient to which he
resorted would have failed of success. Mr. Hume, I was sorry to
observe, looked very unwell; but nothing could prevent him from
further endeavours to extricate the party from its present
embarrassment. </p>

<p>As soon as I had taken a little refreshment, therefore, I
mounted a fresh horse; and he accompanied me across a small
plain, immediately in front of the camp, which was subject to
overflow and covered with polygonum, having a considerable extent
of reeds to its right. </p>

<p>From the plain we entered a wood of blue-gum, in which reeds,
grass, and brush formed a thick coppice. We at length passed into
an open space, surrounded on every side by weeds in dense bodies.
The great marsh bore south of us, and was clear and open, but
behind us the blue-gum trees formed a thick wood above the weeds.
</p>

<p>About two hundred yards from the outskirts of the marsh there
was a line of saplings that had perished, and round about them a
number of the tern tribe (sea swallow) were flying, one of which
Mr. Hume had followed a consider<!--page 57 SECOND GREAT MARSH. /page-->able way into the reeds the
evening before, in the hope that it would have led him to water.
The circumstance of their being in such numbers led us to
penetrate towards them, when we found a serpentine sheet of water
of some length, over which they were playing. We had scarcely
time to examine it before night closed in upon us, and it was
after nine when we returned to the tents. </p>

<p>From the general appearance of the country to the northward,
and from the circumstance of our having got to the bottom of the
great marsh, which but a few days before had threatened to be so
formidable, I thought it probable that the reeds would not again
prove so extensive as they had been, and I determined, if I could
do so, to push through them in a westerly direction from our
position. </p>

<p>The pits yielded us so abundant a supply during the night,
that in the morning we found it unnecessary to take the animals
to water at the channel we had succeeded in finding the evening
before; but pursuing a westerly course we passed it, and struck
deep into the reeds. At mid-day we were hemmed in by them on
every side, and had crossed over numerous channels, by means of
which the waters of the marshes are equally and generally
distributed over the space subject to their influence. Coming to
a second sheet of water, narrower, but longer, as well as we
could judge, than the first, we stopped to dine at it; and, while
the men were resting themselves, Mr. Hume rode with me in a
westerly direction, to ascertain what <!--page 58 CONCLUSIONS IN REGARD TO /page-->obstacles we still had to
contend with. Forcing our way through bodies of reeds, we at
length got on a plain, stretching from S.E. to N.W., bounded on
the right by a wood of blue-gum, under which the reeds still
extended, and on the left by a wood in which they did not appear
to exist. Certain that there was no serious obstacle in our way,
we returned to the men; and as soon as they had finished their
meal, led them over the plain in a N.W. by W. direction. It was
covered with shells, and was full of holes from the effects of
flood. </p>

<p>As we were journeying over it, I requested Mr. Hume to ride
into the wood upon our left, to ascertain if it concealed any
channel. On his return he informed me that he descended from the
plain into a hollow, the bottom of which was covered with small
shells and bulrushes. He observed a new species of eucalypti, on
the trunks of which the water-mark was three feet high. After
crossing this hollow, which was about a quarter of a mile in
breadth, he gained an open forest of box, having good grass under
it; and, judging from the appearance of the country that no other
channel could exist beyond him, and that he had ascertained
sufficient for the object I had in view, he turned back to the
plain. We stopped for the night under a wood of box, where the
grass, which had been burnt down, was then springing up most
beautifully green, and was relished exceedingly by the animals. </p>

<p>It was in consequence of our not having crossed any channel,
while penetrating through the reeds, that could <!--page 59 THE MACQUARIE. /page-->by any possible
exaggeration have been laid down as the bed of the river, that I
detached Mr. Hume; and the account he brought me at once
confirmed my opinion in regard to the Macquarie, and I
thenceforth gave up every hope of ever seeing it in its
characteristic shape again. </p>

<p>Independently however of all circumstantial evidence, it was
clear that the river had not re-formed at a distance of
twenty-five miles to the north of us, since Mr. Hume had gone to
the westward of that point, at about the same distance on his
late journey, without having observed the least appearance of
reeds or of a river. He had, indeed, noticed a hollow, which
occasionally contained water, but he saw nothing like the bed of
a permanent stream. I became convinced, also, from observation of
the country through which we had passed, that the sources of the
Macquarie could not be of such magnitude as to give a constant
flow to it as a river, and at the same time to supply with water
the vast concavity into which it falls. In very heavy rains only
could the marshes and adjacent lands be laid wholly under water,
since the evaporation alone would be equal to the supply. </p>

<p>The great plains stretching for so many miles to the westward
of Mount Harris, even where they were clear of reeds, were
covered with shells and the claws of cray-fish and their soil,
although an alluvial deposit, was superficially sandy. They bore
the appearance not only of frequent inundation, but of the floods
having eventually subsided upon them. This was particularly
observable at <!--page 60 SITUATION OF THE PARTY. /page-->the bottom of the marshes. We did not find any
accumulation of rubbish to indicate a rush of water to any one
point; but numerous minor channels existed to distribute the
floods equally and generally over every part of the area subject
to them, and the marks of inundation and subsidence were
everywhere the same. The plain we had last crossed, was, in like
manner, covered with shells, so that we could not yet be said to
be out of the influence of the marshes; besides which we had not
crossed the hollow noticed by Mr. Hume, which it was clear we
should do, sooner or later. </p>

<p>To have remained in our position would have been impossible,
as there was no water either for ourselves or the animals; to
have descended into the reeds again, for the purpose of carrying
on a minute survey, would, under existing circumstances, have
been imprudent. Our provisions were running short, and if a
knowledge of the distant interior was to be gained, we had no
time to lose. It was determined, therefore, to defer our further
examination of the marshes to the period of our return; and to
pursue such a course as would soonest and most effectually enable
us to determine the character of the western interior.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We left our position at the head of the plain early on the
13th of January, and, ere the sun dipped, had entered a very
different country from that in which we had been labouring for
the last three weeks. We had, as yet, passed over little other
than an alluvial soil, but found that it changed to a red loam in
the brushes immediately backing the camp. An open forest track
succeeded this, over which the vegetation had an unusual
freshness, indicating that the waters had not long subsided from
its surface. We shortly afterwards crossed a hollow, similar to
that Mr. Hume had described, in which bulrushes had taken the
place of reeds. Flooded-gum trees, of large size, were also
growing in it, but on either side box alone prevailed, under
which the forest grass grew to a considerable height. We crossed
the hollow two or three times, and as often remarked the line of
separation between those trees. The <!--page 62 CREEK LEADING NORTHERLY. /page-->last time we crossed it the
country rose a few feet, and we journeyed for the remainder of
the day, at one time over good plains, at another through
brushes, until we found water and feed, at which we stopped for
the night, after having travelling about thirteen miles on a W.
by N. course. The mosquitoes were so extremely troublesome at
this place that we called it Mosquito Brush. At this time my men
were improving rapidly, and Mr. Hume complained less, and looked
better. I hoped, therefore, that our progress would be rapid into
the interior. </p>

<p>On the 14th we took up a westerly course, and in the first
instance traversed a plain of great extent; the soil of which was
for the most part a red sandy loam, but having patches of light
earth upon it. The former was covered with plants of the
chenopedia kind; the latter had evidently been quagmires, and
bore even then the appearance of moisture. At about seven miles
from Mosquito Brush we struck upon a creek of excellent water,
upon which the wild fowl were numerous. Some natives was seen,
but they were only women, and seemed so alarmed that I purposely
avoided them. As the creek was leading northerly, we traced it
down on that course for about seven miles, and then halted upon
its banks, which were composed of a light tenacious earth.
Brushes of casuarina existed near it, but a tortuous box was the
prevailing tree, which, excepting for the knees of small vessels,
could not have been applied to any use, while the flooded-gum had
entirely disappeared. Some ducks were shot in the after<!--page 63 PRODUCTIONS OF THE COUNTRY. /page-->noon,
which proved a great treat, as we had been living for some time
on salt provisions. Our animals fared worse than ourselves, as
the bed of the creek was occupied by coarse rushes, and but
little vegetation was elsewhere to be seen. I here killed a
beautiful snake, of about four feet in length, and of a bright
yellow colour: I had not, however, the means of preserving it.
Fraser collected numerous botanical specimens, and among them two
kinds of caparis. Indeed a great alteration had taken place in
the minor shrubs, and few of those now prevalent had been
observed to the eastward of the marshes. </p>

<p>From the creek, which both I and Mr. Hume must have crossed on
our respective journeys, we held a westerly course for about
fifteen miles, through a country of alternate plain and brush,
the latter predominating, and in its general character differing
but little from that we had traversed the day previous. </p>

<p>The acacia pendula still continued to exist on the plains
backed by dark rows of cypresses.* <span class="note">[Cupressus callitris]</span> In the
brushes, box and casuarina, ** <span class="note">[Casuarina tortuosa]</span> with
several other kinds of eucalypti, prevailed; but none of them
were sufficiently large to be of use. The plains were so
extremely level that a meridian altitude could have been taken
without any material error; and I doubt much whether it would
have been possible to have traversed them had the season been
wet. </p>

<p>As we were travelling through a forest we surprised a hunting
party of natives. Mr. Hume and I were considerably in front of
our party at the time, and he only had his <!--page 64 HUNTING PARTY OF NATIVES. /page-->gun with him. We had
been moving along so quietly that we were not for some time
observed by them. Three were seated on the ground, under a tree,
and two others were busily employed on one of the lower branches
cutting out honey. As soon as they saw us, four of them ran away;
but the fifth, who wore a cap of emu feathers, stood for a moment
looking at us, and then very deliberately dropped out of the tree
to the ground. I then advanced towards him, but before I got
round a bush that intervened, he had darted away. I was fearful
that he was gone to collect his tribe, and, under this
impression, rode quickly back for my gun to support Mr. Hume. On
my arrival I found the native was before me. He stood about
twenty paces from Mr. Hume, who was endeavouring to explain what
he was; but seeing me approach he immediately poised his spear at
him, as being the nearest. Mr. Hume then unslung his carbine, and
presented it; but, as it was evident my re-appearance had
startled the savage, I pulled up; and he immediately lowered his
weapon. His coolness and courage surprised me, and increased my
desire to communicate with him. He had evidently taken both man
and horse for one animal, and as long as Mr. Hume kept his seat,
the native remained upon his guard; but when he saw him dismount,
after the first astonishment had subsided, he stuck his spear
into the ground, and walked fearlessly up to him. We easily made
him comprehend that we were in search of water; when he pointed
to the west, as indicating that we should supply our wants there.
He gave his information in <!--page 65 FATE OF THE MACQUARIE. /page-->a frank and manly way, without the
least embarrassment, and when the party passed, he stepped back
to avoid the animals, without the smallest confusion. I am sure
he was a very brave man; and I left him with the most favourable
impressions, and not without hope that he would follow us. </p>

<p>From a more open forest, we entered a dense scrub, the soil in
which was of a bright-red colour and extremely sandy, and the
timber of various kinds. A leafless species of stenochylus
aphylta, which, from the resemblance, I at first thought one of
the polygonum tribe, was very abundant in the open spaces, and
the young cypresses were occasionally so close as to turn us from
the direction in which we had been moving. In the scrub we
crossed Mr. Hume's tract, and, from the appearance of the ground,
I was led to believe mine could not be very distant. </p>

<p>We struck upon a creek late in the afternoon, at which we
stopped; New Year's Range bearing nearly due west at about four
miles' distance. Had we struck upon my track, the question about
which we were so anxious would still have been undecided; but the
circumstance of our having crossed Mr. Hume's, which, from its
direction, could not be mistaken, convinced me of the fate of the
Macquarie, and I felt assured that, whatever channels it might
have for the distribution of its waters, to the north of our line
of route, the equality of surface of the interior would never
permit it again to form a river; and that it only required an
examination of the lower parts of the marshes to confirm the
theory of the ultimate evaporation and absorption of its waters,
instead <!--page 66 NEW YEAR'S RANGE. /page-->of their contributing to the permanence of an inland sea,
as Mr. Oxley had supposed. </p>

<p>On the 17th of January we encamped under New Year's Range,
which is the first elevation in the interior of Eastern Australia
to the westward of Mount Harris. Yet when at its base, I do not
think that we had ascended above forty feet higher than the
plains in the neighbourhood of that last mentioned eminence.
There certainly is a partial rise of country, where the change of
soil takes place from the alluvial deposits of the marshes, to
the sandy loam so prevalent on the plains we had lately
traversed; but I had to regret that I was unable to decide so
interesting a question by other than bare conjecture. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding that Mr. Hume had already been on them, I
encouraged hopes that a second survey of the country from the
highest point of New Year's Range would enable us to form some
opinion of it, by which to direct our future movements; but I was
disappointed. </p>

<p>The two wooded hills I had seen from Oxley's Table Land were
visible from the range, bearing south; and other eminences bore
by compass S.W. and W. by S.; but in every other direction the
horizon was unbroken. To the westward, there appeared to be a
valley of considerable extent, stretching N. and S., in which
latter direction there was a long strip of cleared ground, that
looked very like the sandy bed of a broad and rapid river. The
bare possibility of the reality determined me to ascertain by
inspection, whether my conjecture was right, and Mr. Hume <!--page 67 MOSQUITOES. /page-->accompanied
me on this excursion. After we left the camp we crossed a part of
the range, and travelled for some time through open forest land
that would afford excellent grazing in most seasons. We passed
some hollows, and noticed many huts that had been occupied near
them; but the hollows were now quite dry, and the huts had been
long deserted. After about ten miles' ride we reached a plain of
white sand, from which New Year's Range was distinctly visible;
and this no doubt was the spot that had attracted my attention.
Pools of water continued on it, from which circumstance it would
appear that the sand had a substratum of clay or marl. From this
plain we proceeded southerly through acacia scrub, bounding
gently undulating forest land, and at length ascended some small
elevations that scarcely deserved the name of hills. They had
fragments of quartz profusely scattered over them; and the soil,
which was sandy, contained particles of mica. </p>

<p>The view from them was confused, nor did any fresh object meet
our observation. We had, however, considerably neared the two
wooded hills, and the elevations that from the range were to the
S.W., now bore N.W. of us. We had wandered too far from the camp
to admit of our returning to it to sleep; we therefore commenced
a search for water, and having found some, we tethered our horses
near it for the night, and should have been tolerably
comfortable, had not the mosquitoes been so extremely
troublesome. They defied the power of smoke, and annoyed me so
much, that, hot as it was, I rolled myself in my boat <!--page 68 A MAN MISSING. /page-->cloak, and
perspired in consequence to such a degree, that my clothes were
wet through, and I had to stand at the fire in the morning to dry
them. Mr. Hume, who could not bear such confinement, suffered the
penalty, and was most unmercifully bitten. </p>

<p>We reached the camp about noon the following day, and learnt,
to our vexation, that one of the men, Norman, had lost himself
shortly after we started, and had not since been heard of.
Dawber, my overseer, was out in search of him. I awaited his
return, therefore, before I took any measures for the man's
recovery; nor was I without hopes that Dawber would have found
him, as it appeared he had taken one of the horses with him, and
Dawber, by keeping his tracks, might eventually have overtaken
him. He returned, however, about 3 p.m. unsuccessful, when Mr.
Hume and I mounted our horses, and proceeded in different
directions in quest of him, but were equally disappointed. </p>

<p>We met at the creek in the dark, and returned to the camp
together, when I ordered the cypresses on the range to be set on
fire, and thus illuminated the country round for many miles. In
the morning, however, as Norman had not made his appearance, we
again started in search of the poor fellow, on whose account I
was now most uneasy; for his horse, it appeared, had escaped him,
and was found with the others at watering time. </p>

<p>I did not return to the camp until after sunset, more fatigued
than I recollect ever having been before. I was, however,
rejoiced on being informed that the object of my <!--page 69 COUNTRY AROUND NEW YEAR'S RANGE. /page-->anxiety was safe
in his tent; that he had caught sight of the hill the evening
before, and that he had reached the camp shortly after I left it.
He had been absent three nights and two days, and had not tasted
water or food of any kind during that time. </p>

<p>To my enquiries he replied, that, being on horseback, he
thought he could have overtaken a kangaroo, which passed him
whilst waiting at the creek for the cattle, and that in the
attempt, he lost himself. It would appear that he crossed the
creek in the dark, and his horse escaped from him on the first
night. He complained more of thirst than of hunger, although he
had drunk at the watering-place to such an excess, on his return,
as to make him vomit; but, though not a little exhausted, he had
escaped better than I should have expected. </p>

<p>New Year's Range consists of a principal group of five hills,
the loftiest of which does not measure 300 feet in height. It has
lateral ridges, extending to the N.N.W. on the one hand, and
bending in to the creek on the other. The former have a few
cypresses, sterculia, and iron bark upon them; the latter are
generally covered with brush, under box; the brush for the most
part consisting of two distinct species of stenochylus, and a new
acacia. The whole range is of quartz formation, small fragments
of which are profusely scattered over the ridges, and are
abundantly incrusted with oxide of iron. The soil in the
neighbourhood of New Year's Range is a red loam, with a slight
mixture of sand. An open forest country lies between it and the
creek, and it is not at all deficient in pasture. <!--page 70 NEW YEAR'S CREEK. /page--> </p>

<p>That a change of soil takes place to the westward of the
creek, is obvious, from the change of vegetation, the most
remarkable feature of which is the sudden check given to the
further extension of the acacia pendula, which is not to be found
beyond it, it being succeeded by another acacia of the same
species and habits; neither do the plants of the chenopedia class
exist in the immediate vicinity of the range. </p>

<p>I place these hills, as far as my observations will allow, in
east long. 146° 32´ 15´´, and in lat. 30° 21´ south; the
variation of the compass being 6° 40´ easterly. </p>

<p>As New Year's Creek was leading northerly, it had been
determined to trace it down as long as it should keep that
course, or one to the westward of it. We broke up the camp,
therefore, under the range, on the evening of the 18th, and moved
to the creek, about two miles north of the place at which we had
before crossed it, with the intention of prosecuting our journey
on the morrow. But both Mr. Hume and I were so fatigued that we
were glad of an opportunity to rest, even for a single day. We
remained stationary, therefore, on the 19th; nor was I without
hope that the natives whom we had surprised in the woods, would
have paid us a visit, since Mr. Hume had met them in his search
for Norman, and they had promised not only to come to us, but to
do all in their power to find the man, whose footsteps some of
them had crossed. They did not, however, venture near us; and I
rather attribute their having kept aloof, to the circumstance of
Mr. Hume's having fired a shot, shortly after he left them, as a
signal <!--page 71 ANNOYED BY KANGAROO FLIES. /page-->to Norman, in the event of his being within hearing of the
report. They must have been alarmed at so unusual a sound; but I
am sure nothing was further from Mr. Hume's intention than to
intimidate them; his knowledge of their manners and customs, as
well as his partiality to the natives, being equally remarkable.
The circumstance is, however, a proof of the great caution that
is necessary in communicating with them. </p>

<p>I have said that we remained stationary the day after we left
the range, with a view to enjoy a little rest; it would, however,
have been infinitely better if we had moved forward. Our camp was
infested by the kangaroo fly, which settled upon us in thousands.
They appeared to rise from the ground, and as fast as they were
swept off were succeeded by fresh numbers. It was utterly
impossible to avoid their persecution, penetrating as they did
into the very tents. </p>

<p>The men were obliged to put handkerchiefs over their faces,
and stockings upon their hands; but they bit through every thing.
It was to no purpose that I myself shifted from place to place;
they still followed, or were equally numerous everywhere. To add
to our discomfort, the animals were driven almost to madness, and
galloped to and fro in so furious a manner that I was
apprehensive some of them would have been lost. I never
experienced such a day of torment; and only when the sun set, did
these little creatures cease from their attacks. </p>

<p>It will be supposed that we did not stay to subject our<!--page 72 SUDDENLY RELIEVED. /page-->selves
to another trial; indeed it was with some degree of horror that
the men saw the first light of morning streak the horizon. They
got up immediately, and we moved down the creek, on a northerly
course, without breakfasting as usual. We found that dense
brushes of casuarina lined the creek on both sides, beyond which,
to our left, there was open rising ground, on which eucalypti,
cypresses, and the acacia longifolia, prevailed; whilst to the
east, plains seemed to predominate. </p>

<p>Although we had left the immediate spot at which the kangaroo
flies (cabarus) seemed to be collected, I did not expect that we
should have got rid of them so completely as we did. None of them
were seen during the day; a proof that they were entirely local.
They were about half the size of a common house fly, had flat
brown bodies, and their bite, although sharp and piercing, left
no irritation after it. </p>

<p>About noon we stopped at the creek side to take some
refreshment. The country bore an improved appearance around us,
and the cattle found abundance of pasture. It was evident that
the creek had been numerously frequented by the natives, although
no recent traces of them could be found. It had a bed of coarse
red granite, of the fragments of which the natives had
constructed a weir for the purpose of taking fish. The appearance
of this rock in so isolated a situation, is worthy of the
consideration of geologists. </p>

<p>The promise of improvement I have noticed, gradually <!--page 73 DESOLATION OF THE COUNTRY. /page-->disappeared
as we proceeded on our day's journey, and we at length found
ourselves once more among brushes, and on the edge of plains,
over which the rhagodia prevailed. Nothing could exceed in
dreariness the appearance of the tracks through which we
journeyed, on this and the two following days. The creek on which
we depended for a supply of water, gave such alarming indications
of a total failure, that I at one time, had serious thoughts of
abandoning my pursuit of it. We passed hollow after hollow that
had successively dried up, although originally of considerable
depth; and, when we at length found water, it was doubtful how
far we could make use of it. Sometimes in boiling it left a
sediment nearly equal to half its body; at other times it was so
bitter as to be quite unpalatable. That on which we subsisted was
scraped up from small puddles, heated by the sun's rays; and so
uncertain were we of finding water at the end of the day's
journey, that we were obliged to carry a supply on one of the
bullocks. There was scarcely a living creature, even of the
feathered race, to be seen to break the stillness of the forest.
The native dogs alone wandered about, though they had scarcely
strength to avoid us; and their melancholy howl, breaking in upon
the ear at the dead of the night, only served to impress more
fully on the mind the absolute loneliness of the desert. </p>

<p>It appeared, from their traces that the natives had lingered
on this ground, on which they had perhaps been born, as long as
it continued to afford them a scanty <!--page 74 SANDY PLAINS. /page-->though precarious
subsistence; but that they had at length been forced from it.
Neither fish nor muscles remained in the creek, nor emus nor
kangaroos on the plains. How then could an European expect to
find food in deserts through which the savage wandered in vain?
There is no doubt of the fate that would have overtaken any one
of the party who might have strayed away, and I was happy to find
that Norman's narrow escape had made a due impression on the
minds of his comrades. </p>

<p>We passed some considerable plains, lying to the eastward of
the creek, on parts of which the grass, though growing in tufts,
was of luxuriant growth. They were, however, more generally
covered with salsola and rhagodia, and totally destitute of other
vegetation, the soil upon them being a red sandy loam. The paths
across the plains, which varied in breadth from three to eight
miles, were numerous; but they had not been recently trodden. The
creek continued to have a thick brush of casuarina and acacia
near it, to the westward of which there was a rising open forest
track; the timber upon it being chiefly box, cypress, and the
acacia longifolia. It was most probably connected with New Year's
Range, those elevations being about thirty miles distant. It
terminated in some gentle hills which, though covered in places
with acacia shrub, were sufficiently open to afford an extensive
view. From their summit Oxley's Table Land, towards which we had
been gradually working our way, was distinctly visible, distant
about twenty miles, and bearing by compass W. by S. On <!--page 75 LEAVE THE CREEK. /page-->descending
from these hills* <span class="note">[Called the Pink Hills, from the colour of a
flower upon them]</span> which were scattered over with fragments of
slaty quartz, we traversed a box flat, apparently subject to
overflow, having a barren sandy scrub to its left. I had desired
the men to preserve a W.N.W. direction, on leaving them,
supposing that that course would have kept them near the creek;
but, on overtaking the party, I found that they had wandered
completely away from it. The fact was, that the creek had taken a
sudden bend to the eastward of N. and had thus thrown them out.
It was with some difficulty that we regained it before sunset;
and we were at length obliged to stop for the night at a small
plain, about a quarter of a mile short of it, but we had the
satisfaction of having excellent feed for the animals. </p>

<p>Fearful that New Year's Creek would take us too far to the
eastward, and being anxious to keep westward as much as possible,
it struck me that we could not, under existing circumstances, do
better than make for Oxley's Table Land. Water, I knew, we should
find in a swamp at it's base, and we might discover some more
encouraging feature than I had observed on my hasty visit to it.
We left the creek, therefore on the 23rd, and once more took up a
westerly course. Passing through a generally open country, we
stopped at noon to rest the animals; and afterwards got on an
excellent grazing forest track, which continued to the brush,
through another part of which I had penetrated to the marsh more
to the south. While making our way through it, we came upon a
small pond of water, and must <!--page 76 OXLEY'S TABLE LAND. /page-->have alarmed some natives, as there
was a fresh made fire close to it. Our journey had been unusually
long, and the cattle had felt the heat so much, that the moment
they saw water they rushed into it; and, as this created some
confusion, I thought it best to stop where we were for the night.
</p>

<p>In the morning, Mr. Hume walked with me to the hill, a
distance of about a mile. It is not high enough to deserve the
name of a mountain, although a beautiful feature in the country,
and showing well from any point of view. We ascended it with an
anxiety that may well be imagined, but were wholly disappointed
in our most sanguine expectations. Our chief object, in this
second visit to Oxley's Table Land, had been to examine, more at
leisure, the face of the country around it, and to discover, if
possible, some fixed point on which to move. </p>

<p>If the rivers of the interior had already exhausted
themselves, what had we to expect from a creek whose diminished
appearance where we left it made us apprehend its speedy
termination, and whose banks we traversed under constant
apprehension? In any other country I should have followed such a
water course, in hopes of its ultimately leading to some
reservoir; but here I could encourage no such favourable
anticipation. </p>

<p>The only new object that struck our sight was a remarkable and
distant hill of conical shape, bearing by compass S. 10 E. To the
southward and westward, in the direction of D'Urban's Group, a
dense and apparently low brush extended; but to the N. and N.W.,
there was a regular <!--page 77 EXCURSION TO D'URBAN'S GROUP. /page-->alternation of wood and plain. I left Mr.
Hume upon the hill, that he might the more readily notice any
smoke made by the natives; and returned myself to the camp about
one o'clock, to move the party to the swamp. Mr. Hume's
perseverance was of little avail. The region he had been
overlooking was, to all appearance, uninhabited, nor did a single
fire indicate that there was even a solitary wanderer upon its
surface. </p>

<p>Our situation, at this time, was extremely embarrassing, and
the only circumstance on which we had to congratulate ourselves
was, the improved condition of our men; for several of the cattle
and horses were in a sad plight. The weather had been so
extremely oppressive, that we had found it impossible to keep
them free from eruptions. I proposed to Mr. Hume, therefore, to
give them a few days' rest, and to make an excursion, with such
of them as were serviceable, to D'Urban's Group. We were both of
us unwilling to return to the creek, but we foresaw that a blind
reliance upon fortune, in our next movements, might involve us in
inextricable difficulty. </p>

<p>On the other hand, there was a very great risk in delay. It
was more than probable, from the continued drought, that our
retreat would be cut off from the want of water, or that we
should only be enabled to effect our retreat with loss of most of
the animals. The hope, however, of our intersecting some stream,
or of falling upon a better country, prevailed over other
considerations; and the excursion was, consequently, determined
upon. <!--page 78 DISTRESS FROM WANT OF WATER. /page--> </p>

<p>We left the camp on the 25th, accompanied by Hopkinson and the
tinker; and, almost immediately after, entered an acacia scrub of
the most sterile description, and one, through which it would
have been impossible to have found a passage for the boat
carriage. The soil was almost a pure sand, and the lower branches
of the trees were decayed so generally as to give the whole an
indescribable appearance of desolation. About mid-day, we crossed
a light sandy plain, on which there were some dirty puddles of
water. They were so shallow as to leave the backs of the frogs in
them exposed, and they had, in consequence, been destroyed by
solar heat, and were in a state of putrefaction. Our horses
refused to drink, but it was evident that some natives must have
partaken of this sickening beverage only a few hours before our
arrival. Indeed, it was clear that a wandering family must have
slept near this spot, as we observed a fresh made gunneah (or
native hut), and their foot-prints were so fresh along the line
we were pursuing, that we momentarily expected to have overtaken
them. It was late in the evening when we got out of this brush
into better and more open ground, where, in ordinary seasons we
should, no doubt, have found abundance of water. But we now
searched in vain for it, and were contented to be enabled to give
our wearied animals better food than they had tasted for many
days, the forest grass, though in tufts, being abundant.</p>

<h5>THE CRESTED PIGEON OF THE MARSHES.</h5>

<p>We brought up for the night at the edge of a scrub, having
travelled from thirty-two to thirty-five miles, judging <!--page 79 BEARINGS FROM OXLEY'S TABLE LAND. /page-->the
distance from the mountains still to be about twelve. </p>

<p>In the morning we started at an early hour, and immediately
entered the brush, beneath which we had slept; pursuing a
westerly course through it. After a short ride, we found
ourselves upon a plain, that was crowded with flocks of
cockatoos. Here we got a supply of water, such as it
was&mdash;so mixed with slime as to hang in strings between
the fingers; and, after a hasty breakfast, we proceeded on our
journey, mostly through a barren sandy scrub that was a perfect
burrow from the number of wombats in it, to within a mile of the
hill group, where the country appeared like one continuous meadow
to the very base of them. I never saw anything like the
luxuriance of the grass on this tract of country, waving as it
did higher than our horses' middles as we rode through it. We
ascended the S.W. face of the mountain to an elevation of at
least 800 feet above the level of the plain, and had some
difficulty in scaling the masses of rock that opposed themselves
to our progress. But on gaining the summit, we were amply repaid
for our trouble. The view extended far and wide, but we were
again disappointed in the main object that had induced us to
undertake the journey. I took the following bearings by compass.
Oxley's Table Land bore N. 40 E. distant forty-five miles; small
and distant hill due E.; conical peak seen from Oxley's Table
Land S. 60 E., very distant; long ridge of high land, S.E.,
distant thirty-five miles; high land, S. 30 E., distant thirty
miles; long range, S. 25 W. <!--page 80 D'URBAN'S GROUP. /page--> </p>

<p>To the westward, as a medium point. the horizon was unbroken,
and the eye wandered over an apparently endless succession of
wood and plain. A brighter green than usual marked the course of
the mountain torrents in several places, but there was no
glittering light among the trees, no smoke to betray a water
hole, or to tell that a single inhabitant was traversing the
extensive region we were overlooking. We were obliged to return
to the plain on which we had breakfasted, and to sleep upon it. </p>

<p>D'Urban's Group is of compact sandstone formation. Its extreme
length is from E.S.E. to W.N.W., and cannot be more than from
seven to nine miles, whilst its breadth is from two to four. The
central space forms a large basin, in which there are stunted
pines and eucalyptus scrub, amid huge fragments of rocks. It
rises like an island from the midst of the ocean, and as I looked
upon it from the plains below, I could without any great stretch
of the imagination, picture to myself that it really was such.
Bold and precipitous, it only wanted the sea to lave its base;
and I cannot but think that such must at no very remote period
have been the case, and that the immense flat we had been
traversing, is of comparatively recent formation. </p>

<p>We reached the camp on the 28th of the month, by nearly the
same route; and were happy to find that, after the few days' rest
they had enjoyed, there was a considerable improvement in the
animals. </p>

<p>Our experience of the nature of the country to the south<!--page 81 DESCRIPTION OF OXLEY'S TABLE LAND. /page-->ward,
and the westward, was such as to deter us from risking anything,
by taking such a direction as was most agreeable to our views.
Nothing remained to us but to follow the creek, or to retreat;
and as we could only be induced to adopt the last measure when
every other expedient should have failed, we determined on
pursuing our original plan, of tracing New Year's Creek as far as
practicable. </p>

<p>Oxley's Table Land is situated in lat. 29° 57´ 30´´, and
in E. long. 145° 43´ 30´´, the mean variation being 6.32
easterly.<!--comment {probably 6&deg; 32&acute;} /comment--> It consists of two hills that appear to have been rent
asunder by some convulsion of nature, since the passage between
them is narrow and their inner faces are equally perpendicular.
The hill which I have named after the late Surveyor-general, is
steep on all sides; but the other gradually declines from the
south, and at length loses itself in a large plain that extends
to the north. It is from four to five miles in length, and is
picturesque in appearance, and lightly wooded. A few cypresses
were growing on Oxley's Table Land; but it had, otherwise, very
little timber upon its summit. Both hills are of sandstone
formation, and there are some hollows upon the last that deserve
particular notice. They have the appearance of having been formed
by eddies of water, being deeper in the centre than at any other
part, and contain fragments and slabs of sandstone of various
size and breadth, without a particle of soil or of sand between
them. It is to be observed that the edges of these slabs, which
were perfect parallelograms, were unbroken, and that they were as
clean as if they had only just been <!--page CONTINUE THE JOURNEY /page-->turned out of the hand of the
mason. We counted thirteen of these hollows in one spot about
twenty-five feet in diameter, but they are without doubt of
periodical formation, since a single hollow was observed lower
than the summit of the hill upon its south extremity, that had
evidently long been exposed to the action of the atmosphere, and
had a general coating of moss over it. </p>

<p>We left Oxley's Table Land on the morning of the 31st of
January, pursuing a northern course through the brush and across
a large plain, moving parallel to the smaller hill, and keeping
it upon our left. The soil upon this plain differed in character
from that on the plains to the eastward, and was much freer from
sand. We stopped to dine at a spot, whence Oxley's Table Land
bore by compass, S. by W., distant about twelve miles. Continuing
our journey, at 2 p.m. we cleared the plain, and entered a tract
covered with the polygonum junceum, on a soil evidently the
deposit of floods. Box-trees were thinly scattered over it, and
among the polygonum, the crested pigeons were numerous. These
general appearances, together with a dip of country to the
N.N.W., made us conclude that we were approaching the creek, and
we accordingly intersected it on a N.N.E. course, at about three
miles' distance from where we had dined. It had, however,
undergone so complete a change, and had increased so much in size
and in the height of its banks, that we were at a loss to
recognise it. Still, with all these favourable symptoms, there
was not a drop of water in it. But small <!--page DOWN NEW YEAR'S CREEK. /page-->shells lay in heaps in
its bed, or were abundantly scattered over it; and we remarked
that they differed from those on the plains of the Macquarie. A
circumstance that surprised us much, was the re-appearance of the
flooded-gum upon its banks, and that too of a large size. We had
not seen any to the westward of the marshes, and we were,
consequently, led to indulge in more sanguine expectation as to
our ultimate success than we had ever ventured to do before. </p>

<p>The party crossed to the right bank of the creek, and then
moved in a westerly direction along it in search of water. A
brush extended to our right, and some broken stony ground, rather
elevated, was visible, to which Mr. Hume rode; nor did he join me
again until after I had halted the party for the night. </p>

<p>My search for water had been unsuccessful, and the sun had
set, when I came upon a broad part of the creek that appeared
very favourable for an encampment, as it was encompassed by high
banks, and would afford the men a greater facility of watching
the cattle, that I knew would stray away if they could. </p>

<p>My anxiety for them led me to wander down the bed of the
creek, when, to my joy, I found a pond of water within a hundred
yards of the tents. It is impossible for me to describe the
relief I felt at this success, or the gladness it spread among
the men. Mr. Hume joined me at dusk, and informed me that he had
made a circuit, and had struck upon the creek about three miles
below us but that, in tracing it up, he had not found a drop of
water <!--page 84 DISTRESSED FOR WATER. /page-->until he came to the pond near which we had so
providentially encamped. On the following morning, we held a
westerly course over an open country for about eight miles and a
half. The prevailing timber appeared to be a species of
eucalypti, with rough bark, of small size, and evidently
languishing from the want of moisture. The soil over which we
travelled was far from bad, but there was a total absence of
water upon it. At 6 p.m. Oxley's Table Land was distant from us
about fifteen miles, bearing S. 20 E. by compass. </p>

<p>We had not touched upon the creek from the time we left it in
the morning, having wandered from it in a northerly direction,
along a native path that we intersected, and that seemed to have
been recently trodden, since footsteps were fresh upon it. At
sunset, we crossed a broad dry creek that puzzled us extremely,
and were shortly afterwards obliged to stop for the night upon a
plain beyond it. We had, during the afternoon, bent down to the
S.W. in hopes that we should again have struck upon New Year's
Creek; and, under an impression that we could not be far from it,
Mr. Hume and I walked across the plain, to ascertain if it was
sufficiently near to be of any service to us. We came upon a
creek, but could not decide whether it was the one for which we
had been searching, or another. </p>

<p>Its bed was so perfectly even that it was impossible to say to
what point it flowed, more especially as all remains of debris
had mouldered away. It was, however, extremely broad, and
evidently, at times, held a furious torrent. In the centre of it,
at one of the angles, we discovered a pole <!--page 85 REACH A LARGE RIVER. /page-->erected, and at first
thought, from the manner in which it was propped up, that some
unfortunate European must have placed it there as a mark to tell
of his wanderings, but we afterwards concluded that it might be
some superstitious rite of the natives, in consequence of the
untowardness of the season, as it seemed almost inconceivable
that an European could have wandered to such a distance from the
located districts in safety. </p>

<p>The creek had flooded-gum growing upon its banks, and, on
places apparently subject to flood, a number of tall straight
saplings were observed by us. We returned to the camp, after a
vain search for water, and were really at a loss what direction
next to pursue. The men kept the cattle pretty well together,
and, as we were not delayed by any preparations for breakfast,
they were saddled and loaded at an early hour. The circumstance
of there having been natives in the neighbourhood, of whom we had
seen so few traces of late, assured me that water was at hand,
but in what direction it was impossible to guess. As the path we
had observed was leading northerly, we took up that course, and
had not proceeded more than a mile upon it, when we suddenly
found ourselves on the banks of a noble river. Such it might in
truth be called, where water was scarcely to be found. The party
drew up upon a bank that was from forty to forty-five feet above
the level of the stream. The channel of the river was front
seventy to eighty yards broad, and enclosed an unbroken sheet of
water, evidently very deep, and literally covered with pe<!--page 86 DISAPPOINTMENT ON FINDING /page-->licans
and other wild fowl. Our surprise and delight may better be
imagined than described. Our difficulties seemed to be at an end,
for here was a river that promised to reward all our exertions,
and which appeared every moment to increase in importance to our
imagination. Coming from the N.E.,and flowing to the S.W., it had
a capacity of channel that proved that we were as far from its
source as from its termination. The paths of the natives on
either side of it were like well trodden roads; and the trees
that overhung it were of beautiful and gigantic growth. </p>

<p>Its banks were too precipitous to allow of our watering the
cattle, but the men eagerly descended to quench their thirst,
which a powerful sun had contributed to increase; nor shall I
ever forget the cry of amazement that followed their doing so, or
the looks of terror and disappointment with which they called out
to inform me that the water was so salt as to be unfit to drink!
This was, indeed, too true: on tasting it, I found it extremely
nauseous, and strongly impregnated with salt, being apparently a
mixture of sea and fresh water. Whence this arose, whether from
local causes, or from a communication with some inland sea, I
knew not, but the discovery was certainly a blow for which I was
not prepared. Our hopes were annihilated at the moment of their
apparent realization. The cup of joy was dashed out of our hands
before we had time to raise it to our lips. Notwithstanding this
disappointment, we proceeded down the river, and halted at about
five miles, being influenced by the goodness of the <!--page 87 THE RIVER SALT. /page-->feed to
provide for the cattle as well as circumstances would permit.
They would not drink of the river water, but stood covered in it
for many hours, having their noses alone exposed above the
stream. Their condition gave me great uneasiness. It was evident
they could not long hold out under their excessive thirst, and
unless we should procure some fresh water, it would impossible
for us to continue our journey. On a closer examination, the
river appeared to me much below its ordinary level, and its
current was scarcely perceptible. We placed sticks to ascertain
if there was a rise or fall of tide, but could arrive at no
satisfactory conclusion, although there was undoubtedly a current
in it. Yet, as I stood upon its banks at sunset, when not a
breath of air existed to break the stillness of the waters below
me, and saw their surface kept in constant agitation by the
leaping of fish, I doubted whether the river could supply itself
so abundantly, and the rather imagined, that it owed such
abundance, which the pelicans seemed to indicate was constant, to
some mediterranean sea or other. Where, however, were the human
inhabitants of this distant and singular region? The signs of a
numerous population were around us, but we had not seen even a
solitary wanderer. The water of the river was not, by any means,
so salt as that of the ocean, but its taste was precisely
similar. Could it be that its unnatural state had driven its
inhabitants from its banks? </p>

<p>One would have imagined that our perplexities would have been
sufficient for one day, but ere night closed, <!--page 88 JUNCTION OF NEW YEAR'S CREEK. /page-->they increased upon
us, although our anxiety, with regard to the cattle, was happily
removed. Mr. Hume with his usual perseverance, walked out when
the camp was formed; and, at a little distance from it, ascended
a ridge of pure sand, crowned with cypresses. From this, he
descended to the westward, and, at length, struck upon the river,
where a reef of rocks creased its channel, and formed a dry
passage from one side to the other; but the bend, which the river
must have taken, appeared to him so singular, that he doubted
whether it was the same beside which we had been travelling
during the day. Curiosity led him to cross it, when he found a
small pond of fresh water on a tongue of land, and, immediately
afterwards, returned to acquaint me with the welcome tidings. It
was too late to move, but we had, at least, the prospect of a
comfortable breakfast in the morning. </p>

<p>In consequence of the doubts that hung upon Mr. Hume's mind,
as to the course of the river, we arranged that the animals
should precede us to the fresh water; and that we should keep
close in upon the stream, to ascertain that point. After
traversing a deep bight, we arrived nearly as soon as the party,
at the appointed rendezvous. The rocks composing the channel of
the river at the crossing place, were of indurated clay. In the
course of an hour, the animals appearing quite refreshed, we
proceeded on our journey, and at about four miles crossed New
Year's Creek, at its junction with the salt river. We passed
several parts of the main channel that were perfectly dry, and
were altogether <!--page 89 NATIVE VILLAGE. /page-->at a loss to account for the current we
undoubtedly had observed in the river when we first came upon it.
At midday D'Urban's Group bore S. 65 E. distant about 32 miles.
We made a little westing in the afternoon. The river continued to
maintain its character and appearance, its lofty banks, and its
long still reaches: while, however, the blue-gum trees upon its
banks were of magnificent size, the soil had but little
vegetation upon it, although an alluvial deposit. </p>

<p>We passed over vast spaces covered with the polygonum junceum,
that bore all the appearance of the flooded tracks in the
neighbourhood of the marshes, and on which the travelling was
equally distressing to the animals. Indeed, it had been
sufficiently evident to us that the waters of this river were not
always confined to its channel, capacious as it was, but that
they inundated a belt of barren land, that varied in width from a
quarter of a mile to a mile, when they were checked by an outer
embankment that prevented them from spreading generally over the
country, and upon the neighbouring plains. At our halting place,
the cattle drank sparingly of the water, but it acted as a
violent purgative both on them and the men who partook of it. </p>

<p>On the 5th, the river led us to the southward and westward.
Early in the day, we passed a group of seventy huts, capable of
holding from twelve to fifteen men each. They appeared to be
permanent habitations, and all of them fronted the same point of
the compass. In searching amongst them we observed two
beautifully made nets, of <!--page 90 TERROR OF THE NATIVES. /page-->about ninety yards in length. The one
had much larger meshes than the other, and was, most probably,
intended to take kangaroos; but the other was evidently a fishing
net. </p>

<p>In one hut, the floor of which was swept with particular care,
a number of white balls, as of pulverised shells or lime, had
been deposited&mdash;the use of which we could not divine. A
trench was formed round the hut to prevent the rain from running
under it, and the whole was arranged with more than ordinary
attention. </p>

<p>We had not proceeded very far when we came suddenly upon the
tribe to which this village, as it might be called, belonged. </p>

<p>In breaking through some brush to an open space that was
bounded on one side by the river, we observed three or four
natives, seated on a bank at a considerable distance from us; and
directly in the line on which we were moving. The nature of the
ground so completely favoured our approach, that they did not
become aware of it until we were within a few yards of them, and
had ascended a little ridge, which, as we afterwards discovered,
ended in an abrupt precipice upon the river, not more than thirty
yards to our right. The crack of the drayman's whip was the first
thing that aroused their attention. They gazed upon us for a
moment, and then started up and assumed an attitude of horror and
amazement; their terror apparently increasing upon them. We stood
perfectly immovable, until at length they gave a fearful yell,
and darted out of sight. <!--page 91 THEY FIRE THE BUSH. /page--> </p>

<p>Their cry brought about a dozen more natives from the river,
whom we had not before observed, but who now ran after their
comrades with surprising activity, and without once venturing to
look behind them. As our position was a good one, we determined
to remain upon it, until we should ascertain the number and
disposition of the natives. We had not been long stationary, when
we heard a crackling noise in the distance, and it soon became
evident that the bush had been fired. It was, however, impossible
that we could receive any injury on the narrow ridge upon which
we stood, so that we waited very patiently to see the end of this
affair. </p>

<p>In a short time the fire approached pretty near to us, and
dense columns of smoke rose into the air over our heads. One of
the natives, who had been on the bank, now came out of the bush,
exactly from the spot into which he had retreated. He advanced a
few paces towards us, and bending his body so that his hands
rested on his knees, he fixed his gaze upon us for some time;
but, seeing that we remained immovable, he began to throw himself
into the most extravagant attitudes, shaking his foot from time
to time. When he found that all his violence had no effect, he
turned his rear to us in a most laughable manner, and absolutely
groaned in spirit when he found that this last insult failed of
success. </p>

<p>He stood perplexed and not knowing what next to do, which gave
Mr. Hume an opportunity to call out to him, and with considerable
address he at length got the savage <!--page 92 REMARKS ON THE NATIVES /page-->to approach close up to him;
Mr. Hume himself having advanced a short distance from the
animals in the first instance. As soon as I thought the savage
had sufficiently recovered from his alarm, I went up to him with
a tomahawk, the use of which he immediately guessed. We now
observed that the natives who had fled from the river, had been
employed in setting a net. They had placed it in a semicircle,
with either end to the shore, and rude pieces of wood were
attached to it to keep the upper part perpendicular. It was in
fact a sein, only that the materials, with the exception of the
net-work, were simpler and rougher than cork or lead&mdash;for
which last, we afterwards discovered stones had been substituted.
</p>

<p>We had on this occasion a remarkable instance of the docility
of the natives of the interior, or of the power they have of
subduing their apprehensions; manifesting the opposite extremes
of fear and confidence. These men whom we had thus surprised, and
who, no doubt, imagined that we were about to destroy them,
having apparently never seen nor heard of white men before, must
have taken us for something preternatural; yet from the extremity
of fear that had prompted them to set their woods in flames, they
in a brief space so completely subdued those fears as to approach
the very beings who had so strongly excited their alarm. The
savage who had been the principal actor in the scene, was an
elderly man, rather descending to the vale of years than what
might be strictly called aged. I know not how it was, but I
regarded him with peculiar interest. Mr. <!--page 93 DISEASE AMONG THEM. /page-->Hume's manners had in a
great measure contributed to allay his evident agitation; but,
from the moment I approached him, I thought there was a shade of
anxiety upon his brow, and an expression of sorrow over his
features, the cause of which did not originate with us. I could
see in a moment, that his bosom was full even to bursting, and he
seemed to claim at once our sympathy and our protection, although
we were ignorant of that which oppressed him. We had not long
been seated together, when some of his tribe mustered sufficient
courage to join him. Both Mr. Hume and I were desirous of seeing
the net drawn, but the old man raised some objection, by pointing
to the heavens and towards the sun. After a little more
solicitation, however, he gave a whistle, and, four or five
natives having obeyed the summons, he directed them to draw the
net, but they were unfortunate, and our wish to ascertain the
kind of fish contained in the river was disappointed. As his
tribe gathered round him, the old chief threw a melancholy glance
upon them, and endeavoured, as much as he could, to explain the
cause of that affliction which, as I had rightly judged, weighed
heavily upon him. It appeared, then, that a violent cutaneous
disease raged throughout the tribe, that was sweeping them off in
great numbers. He called several young men to Mr. Hume and
myself, who had been attacked by this singular malady. Nothing
could exceed the anxiety of his explanations, or the mild and
soothing tone in which he addressed his people, and it really
pained me that I could not assist him in his distress. We now <!--page 94 DEPARTURE OF THE NATIVES. /page-->discovered
the use to which the conical substance that had been deposited
with such unusual care in one of the huts, was applied. There
were few of the natives present who were not more or less marked
with it, and it was no doubt, indicative of mourning. </p>

<p>Some of the men, however, were painted with red and yellow
ochre, with which it was evident to me they had besmeared
themselves since our appearance, most likely in preparing for the
combat in which they fancied they would be engaged. We
distributed such presents as we had to those around us, and when
we pursued our journey, the majority accompanied us, nor did they
wholly leave us until we had passed the place to which their
women had retired. They might have left us when they pleased, for
we intended them no harm; as it was, however, they struck into
the brushes to join their families, and we pushed on to make up
for lost time. </p>

<p>The travelling near the river had been so bad, not only in
consequence of the nature of the soil and brush, but from the
numerous gullies that had been formed by torrents, as they poured
into its channel after heavy rains and floods, that it was
thought advisable to keep at a greater distance from it. We
turned away, therefore, to the plains, and found them of much
firmer surface. They partook, however, of the same general
character as the plains we had traversed more to the eastward.
Their soil was a light sandy loam, and the same succulent plants
still continued to prevail upon them, which we have already
noticed as <!--page 95 BRINE SPRINGS IN THE RIVER. /page-->existing upon the other plains. Both emus and
kangaroos were seen, though not in any considerable numbers, but
our dogs were not in a condition to run, and were all but killed
by the extreme heat of the weather. We had fallen on a small pool
of water shortly after we started in the morning, but we could do
no more than refresh ourselves and the animals at it. In the
afternoon, we again turned towards the river, and found it
unaltered. Its water was still salt, and from the increased
number of wild fowl and pelicans upon it, as well as from the
general flatness of the country, I certainly thought we were
rapidly approaching some inland sea. It was, however, uncertain
how long we should be enabled to continue on the river. The
animals were all of them extremely weak, and every day increased
the probable difficulty of our return. There was not the least
appearance of a break-up of the drought, the heavens were without
a cloud, and the atmosphere was so clear that the outline of the
moon could be distinctly seen, although she was far in her wane. </p>

<p>On the 6th, we journeyed again through a barren scrub,
although on firmer ground, and passed numerous groups of huts. At
about eight miles from our last encampment, we came upon the
river, where its banks were of considerable height. In riding
along them, Mr. Hume thought he observed a current running, and
be called to inform me of the circumstance. On a closer
examination, we discovered some springs in the very bed of the
river, from which a considerable stream was gushing, and from the
incrustation around <!--page 96 DISTRESS FOR WANT OF FRESH WATER. /page-->them, we had no difficulty in guessing at
their nature: in fact, they were brine springs, and I collected a
quantity of salt from the brink of them. </p>

<p>After such a discovery, we could not hope to keep our
position. No doubt the current we had observed on first reaching
the river, was caused by springs that had either escaped our
notice or were under water. Here was at length a local cause for
its saltness that destroyed at once the anticipation and hope of
our being near its termination, and, consequently, the ardour
with which we should have pressed on to decide so interesting a
point. </p>

<p>Our retreat would have been a measure of absolute necessity
ere this, had we not found occasional supplies of fresh water,
the last pond of which was now about eighteen miles behind us. </p>

<p>Whether we should again find any, was a doubtful question, and
I hesitated to run the risk. The animals were already, from bad
food, and from the effects of the river water, so weak, that they
could scarcely carry their loads, and I was aware, if any of the
bullocks once fell, he would never rise again. Under such
circumstances, I thought it better to halt the party at the edge
of the scrub, though the feed was poor, and the water not
drinkable. Our situation required most serious consideration. It
was necessary that we should move either backward or forward in
the morning. Yet we could not adopt either measure with
satisfaction to ourselves, under such unfavorable circumstances.
I determined to relieve my own mind by getting <!--page 97 OUR COURSE ARRESTED. /page-->the animals into a
place of safety, as soon as possible; and, as the only effectual
way of doing this was to retire upon the nearest fresh water, I
resolved at once to do so. The party turned back on the morning
of the 6th; nor do I think the cattle would ever have reached
their destination had we not found a few buckets of rain water in
the cleft of a rock, to refresh them. Thus it will appear that
under our most trying circumstances, we received aid from
Providence, and that the bounty of Heaven was extended towards
us, when we had least reason to expect it. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding we had been thus forced to a partial retreat,
both Mr. Hume and myself were unwilling to quit the pursuit of
the river, in so unsatisfactory a manner. There was no difference
in the appearance of the country to the westward of it; but a
seeming interminable flat stretched away in that direction. A
journey across it was not likely, therefore, to be attended with
any favorable results, since it was improbable that any other
leading feature was within our reach. I proposed, therefore, to
take the most serviceable of the horses with me down the river,
that, in the event of our finding fresh water, we might again
push forward. Mr. Hume requesting to be permitted to accompany
me, it was arranged that we should start on the 8th, thereby
giving the animals a day's rest. We had not seen any natives
since our parting with the chief horde; and as we were stationed
at some little distance from the river, I hoped that they would
not visit the camp during my absence. This was the only circum<!--page 98 EXTRAORDINARY SOUND. /page-->stance
that gave me uneasiness, but the men had generally been behaving
so well that I relied a great deal upon them. </p>

<p>About 3 p.m. on the 7th, Mr. Hume and I were occupied tracing
the chart upon the ground. The day had been remarkably fine, not
a cloud was there in the heavens, nor a breath of air to be felt.
On a sudden we heard what seemed to be the report of a gun fired
at the distance of between five and six miles. It was not the
hollow sound of an earthly explosion, or the sharp cracking noise
of falling timber, but in every way resembled a discharge of a
heavy piece of ordnance. On this all were agreed, but no one was
certain whence the sound proceeded. Both Mr. Hume and myself had
been too attentive to our occupation to form a satisfactory
opinion; but we both thought it came from the N.W. I sent one of
the men immediately up a tree, but he could observe nothing
unusual. The country around him appeared to be equally flat on
all sides, and to be thickly wooded: whatever occasioned the
report, it made a strong impression on all of us; and to this
day, the singularity of such a sound, in such a situation, is a
matter of mystery to me. </p>

<p>On the 8th, we commenced our journey down the river,
accompanied by two men, and a pack-horse, carrying our provisions
on one side and a bucket of water on the other. Keeping in
general near the stream, but making occasional turns into the
plains, we got to the brush from which the party had turned back,
about 3 p.m. Passing through, we crossed a small plain, of better
soil and vegetation <!--page 99 FURTHER ATTEMPT TO EXPLORE THE RIVER. /page-->than usual; but it soon gave place to the
sandy loam of the interior; nor did we observe any material
alteration, either in the country or the river, as we rode along.
The flooded-gum trees on the banks of the latter, were of
beautiful growth, but in the brushes dividing the plains, box and
other eucalypti, with cypresses and many minor shrubs, prevailed.
We slept on the river side, and calculated our distance from the
camp at about twenty-six or twenty-eight miles. </p>

<p>The horses would not drink the river water, so that we were
obliged to give them a pint each from our own supply. On the
following morning we continued our journey. The country was
generally open to the eastward, and we had fine views of
D'Urban's Group, distant from twenty to twenty-five miles. About
noon, turning towards the river to rest, both ourselves and the
horses, we passed through brush land for about a mile and a half.
When we came upon its banks, we found them composed of a red loam
with sandy superficies. We had, in the course of the day, crossed
several creeks, but in none of them could we find water, although
their channels were of great depth. </p>

<p>The day had been extremely warm, and from shaking in the
barrel our supply of water had diminished to a little more than a
pint; it consequently became a matter of serious consideration,
how far it would be prudent to proceed farther; for, however
capable we were of bearing additional fatigue, it was evident our
animals would soon fail, since they trembled exceedingly, and had
the look of total exhaustion. <!--page 100 CALLED IT THE &ldquo;DARLING&rdquo;. /page-->We calculated that we were forty
miles from the camp, in a S.W. direction, a fearful distance
under our circumstances, since we could not hope to obtain relief
for two days. Independently however, of the state of the animals,
our spirits were damped by the nature of the country, and the
change which had taken place on the soil, upon which it was
impossible that water could rest; while the general appearance of
the interior showed how much it had suffered from drought. On the
other hand, although the waters of the river had become worse to
the taste, the river itself had increased in size, and stretched
away to the westward, with all the uniformity of a magnificent
canal, and gave every promise of increasing importance; while the
pelicans were in such numbers upon it as to be quite dazzling to
the eye. Considering, however, that perseverance would only
involve us in inextricable difficulties, and that it would also
be useless to risk the horses, since we had gained a distance to
which the bullocks could not have been brought, I intimated my
intention of giving up the further pursuit of the river, though
it was with extreme reluctance that I did so. </p>

<p>As soon as we had bathed and finished our scanty meal, I took
the bearings of D'Urban's Group, and found them to be S. 58 E.
about thirty-three miles distant; and as we mounted our horses, I
named the river the &ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; as a lasting
memorial of the respect I bear the governor. </p>

<p>I should be doing injustice to Mr. Hume and my men, <!--page 101 ABANDON THE ATTEMPT. /page-->if I did
not express my conviction that they were extremely unwilling to
yield to circumstances, and that, had I determined on continuing
the journey, they would have followed me with cheerfulness,
whatever the consequences might have been.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We kept near the river as we journeyed homewards, and in
striking across a plain, found an isolated rock of quartz and
jasper, just showing itself partially above the surface of the
ground. </p>

<p>We were anxious to get to the small plain I have mentioned, if
possible, for the sake of the animals, and pushed on rapidly for
it. About 4 p.m. we had reached our sleeping place of the
previous evening, and being overpowered by thirst, we stopped in
hopes that by making our tea strong we might destroy, in some
measure, the nauseous taste of the water. The horses were
spancelled <!--page 103 INTERCOURSE WITH NATIVES. /page-->and a fire lit. Whilst we were sitting patiently for
the boiling of the tins, Mr. Hume observed at a considerable
distance above us, a large body of natives under some gum trees.
They were not near enough for us to observe them distinctly, but
it was evident that they were watching our motions. We did not
take any notice of them for some time, but at last I thought it
better to call out to them, and accordingly requested Mr. Hume to
do so. In a moment the whole of them ran forward and dashed into
the river, having been on the opposite side, with an uproar I had
never witnessed on any former occasion. </p>

<p>Mr. Hume thought they intended an attack, and the horses had
taken fright and galloped away. I determined, therefore, to fire
at once upon them if they pressed up the bank on which we were
posted. Mr. Hume went with me to the crest of it, and we rather
angrily beckoned to the foremost of the natives to stop. They
mistook our meaning, but laid all their spears in a heap as they
came up. We then sat down on the bank and they immediately did
the same; nor did they stir until we beckoned to them after the
horses had been secured. </p>

<p>As they conducted themselves so inoffensively, we gave them
everything we had to spare. My gun seemed to excite their
curiosity, as they had seen Mr. Hume shoot a cockatoo with it;
they must consequently have been close to us for the greater part
of the day, as the bird was killed in the morning. It was of a
species new to me, being smaller than the common white cockatoo,
and having a <!--page 104 DISTRESS FROM THIRST. /page-->large scarlet-and-yellow instead of a pine-yellow
top-knot. </p>

<p>Having stayed about half an hour with them, we remounted our
horses, and struck away from the river into the plains, while the
natives went up its banks to join their hordes. Those whom we saw
were about twenty-seven in number and the most of them were
strangers. </p>

<p>It was some time after sunset before we reached the little
plain on which we had arranged to sleep, and when we dismounted
we were in a truly pitiable state. I had been unable to refrain
from drinking copiously at the river, and now became extremely
sick. Mr. Hume had been scarcely more prudent than myself, but on
him the water had a contrary effect, as well as upon Hopkinson.
The tinker was the only man fit for duty, and it was well for us
that such was the case, as the horses made frequent attempts to
stray, and would have left us in a pretty plight had they
succeeded. We reached the camp on the following day a little
before sunset, nor was I more rejoiced to dismount from my
wearied horse than to learn that everything in the camp had been
regular during our absence and that the men had kept on the best
terms with the natives who had paid them frequent visits. </p>

<p>The bullocks had improved, but were still extremely weak, and
as the horses we had employed on the last journey required a day
or two's rest, it was arranged that we should not break up our
camp until the 12th, beyond which period we could not stop, in
consequence of the low <!--page 105 REMARKS ON THE NATIVES. /page-->state of our salt provisions, we having
barely sufficient to last to Mount Harris, at the rate of two
pounds per week. </p>

<p>The morning after we returned from our excursion, a large
party of natives, about seventy in number, visited the camp. On
this occasion, the women and children passed behind the tents,
but did not venture to stop. Most of the men had spears, and were
unusually inquisitive and forward. Several of them carried
fire-sticks under the influence of the disease I have already
noticed, whilst others were remarked to have violent cutaneous
eruptions all over the body. We were pretty well on the alert;
notwithstanding which, every minor article was seized with a
quickness that would have done credit to a most finished juggler.
One of the natives thus picked up my comb and toothbrush, but as
he did not attempt to conceal them, they were fortunately
recovered. After staying with us a short time the men followed
the women. They appeared to be strangers who had come from a
distance. </p>

<p>The natives of the Darling are a clean-limbed,
well-conditioned race, generally speaking. They seemingly occupy
permanent huts, but their tribe did not bear any proportion to
the size or number of their habitations. It was evident their
population had been thinned. The customs of these distant tribes,
as far as we could judge, were similar to those of the mountain
blacks, and they are essentially the same people, although their
language differs. They lacerate their bodies, but do not extract
the front teeth. We saw but few cloaks among them, since the <!--page 106 CUSTOMS OF THE NATIVES. /page-->opossum
does not inhabit the interior. Those that were noticed, were made
of the red kangaroo skin. In appearance, these men are stouter in
the bust than at the lower extremities; they have broad noses,
sunken eyes, overhanging eyebrows, and thick lips. The men are
much better looking than the women. Both go perfectly naked, if I
except the former, who wear nets over the loins and across the
forehead, and bones through the cartilages of the nose. Their
chief food is fish, of which they have great supplies in the
river; still they have their seasons for hunting their emus and
kangaroos. The nets they use for this purpose, as well as for
fishing, are of great length, and are made upon large frames.
These people do not appear to have warlike habits nor do they
take any pride in their arms, which differ little from those used
by the inland tribes, and are assimilated to them as far as the
materials will allow. One powerful man, however, had a regular
trident, for which Mr. Hume offered many things without success.
He plainly intimated to us that he had a use for it, but whether
against an enemy or to secure prey, we could not understand. I
was most anxious to have ascertained if any religious ceremonies
obtained among them, but the difficulty of making them comprehend
our meaning was insurmountable; and to the same cause may be
attributed the circumstance of my being unable to collect any
satisfactory vocabulary of their language. They evinced a strange
perversity, or obstinacy rather, in repeating words, although it
was evident that they knew they were meant as <!--page 107 REMARKS ON THE DARLING RIVER. /page-->questions. The pole
we observed in the creek, on the evening previously to our making
the Darling, was not the only one that fell under our notice; our
impression therefore, that they were fixed by the natives to
propitiate some deity, was confirmed. It would appear that the
white pigment was an indication of mourning. Whether these people
have an idea of a superintending Providence I doubt, but they
evidently dread evil agency. On the whole I should say they are a
people, at present, at the very bottom of the scale of humanity. </p>

<p>We struck the Darling River in lat. 29° 37´ S. and in E.
long. 145° 33´, and traced it down for about sixty-six miles in
a direct line to the S.W. If I might hazard an opinion from
appearance, to whatever part of the interior it leads, its source
must be far to the N.E. or N. The capacity of its channel, and
the terrific floods that must sometimes rage in it, would argue
that it is influenced by tropical rains, which alone would cause
such floods. It is likely that it seldom arrives at so reduced a
state as that in which we found it, and that, generally speaking,
it has a sufficient depth of water for the purposes of inland
navigation: in such case its future importance cannot be
questioned, since it most probably receives the chief streams
falling westerly from the coast ranges. But, with every
anticipation of the benefit that may at some time or other be
derived from this remarkable and central stream, it is incumbent
on me to state that the country, through which it flows, holds
out but little prospect of advantage. Certainly the portion we <!--page 108 REMARKS ON THE COUNTRY. /page-->know
of it, is far from encouraging. The extent of alluvial soil,
between the inner and outer banks of the river, is extremely
limited, and, instead of being covered with sward, is in most
places over-run by the polygonum. Beyond this the plains of the
interior stretch away, whose character and soil must change, ere
they can be available to any good purpose. But there is a
singular want of vegetable decay in the interior of New Holland,
and that powerfully argues its recent origin. </p>

<p>There is no life upon its surface, if I may so express myself;
but the stillness of death reigns in its brushes, and over its
plains. It cannot, however, be doubted that we visited the
interior during a most unfavorable season. Probably in ordinary
ones it wears a different appearance, but its deserts are of
great extent, and its productions are of little value. </p>

<p>Agreeably to our arrangements, we broke up our camp at an
early hour on the morning of the 12th, and proceeded up the river
to the junction of New Year's Creek. We then struck away in an
easterly direction from it, detaching a man to trace the creek
up, lest we should pass any water; and we should certainly have
been without it had we not taken this precaution. </p>

<p>On the following day, we again passed to the eastward, through
an open country, having picturesque views of Oxley's Table Land.
We crossed our track about noon, and struck on the creek at about
five miles beyond it, and we were fortunate enough to procure
both water and grass. <!--page 109 REGAIN OUR OLD ROUTE. /page-->The timber upon the plains, between us and
the Darling, we found to be a rough gum, but box prevailed in the
neighbourhood of the creek at this part of it. </p>

<p>On the 14th, we changed our direction more to the southward,
but made a short journey, in consequence of being obliged to make
some slight repairs on the boat carriage. </p>

<p>On the 15th, we kept an E.S.E. course, and, crossing the creek
at an early hour, got upon our old track, which we kept. We had
the lateral ridge of the Pink Hills upon our right, and travelled
through a good deal of brush. Four or five natives joined us, and
two followed us to the end of our day's journey. In the course of
the evening, they endeavoured to pilfer whatever was in their
reach, but were detected putting a tin into a bush, and soon took
to their heels. This was the first instance we had of open theft
among the natives of the interior. </p>

<p>We passed Mosquito Brush on the 18th, but found the ponds
quite dry, we were, therefore, under the necessity of pushing on,
to shorten the next day's journey, as we could not expect to get
water nearer than the marshes. At noon, on the 19th, we entered
the plain, and once more saw them spreading in dreariness before
us. While the party was crossing to the first channel, I rode to
the left, in order to examine the appearance of the country in
the direction of the wood, and as far as I skirted the reeds had
my impressions confirmed as to their partial extension. I was
obliged, however, to join the men without completing the <!--page 110 ALARM FOR THE SAFETY /page-->circuit
of the marshes. They had found the first channel dry, and had
passed on to the other, in which, fortunately, a small quantity
of water still remained. It was, however, so shallow as to expose
the backs of the fish in it, and a number of crows had
congregated, and were pecking at them. Wishing to satisfy my mind
as to the distance to which the river extended to the northward,
Mr. Hume rode with me on the following day, to examine the
country in that direction, leaving the men stationary. We found
that the reeds gradually decreased in body, until, at length,
they ceased, or gave place to bulrushes. There were general
appearances of inundation, and of the subsidence of waters, but
none that led us to suppose that any channel existed beyond the
flooded lands. </p>

<p>On our return to the camp, we observed dense masses of smoke
rising at the head of the marshes, and immediately under Mount
Foster. This excited our alarm for the safety of the party we
hoped to find at Mount Harris, and obliged us to make forced
marches, to relieve it if threatened by the natives. </p>

<p>On the 22nd, we crossed the plains of the Macquarie, and
surprised a numerous tribe on the banks of the river; and the
difficulty we found in getting any of them to approach us, their
evident timidity, and the circumstance of one of them having on a
jacket, tended to increase our apprehensions. When two or three
came to us, they intimated that white men either had been or were
under Mount Harris, but we were left in uncertainty and passed a
most anxious night. <!--page 111 OF THE PROVISION PARTY. /page--> </p>

<p>The body of reeds was still on fire; and the light embers were
carried to an amazing distance by the wind, falling like a
black-shower around us. As we knew that the natives never made
such extensive conflagration, unless they had some mischievous
object in view, our apprehension for the safety of Riley, with
his supplies, was increased. </p>

<p>At the earliest dawn, we pushed for the hill. In passing that
part of the meadows under Mount Foster, we observed that the
grass had also been consumed, and we scarcely recognised the
ground from its altered appearance. As we approached Mount
Harris, we saw recent traces of cattle, but none were visible on
the plains. Under the hill, however, we could distinctly see that
a hut of some kind had been erected, and it is impossible for me
to describe the relief we felt when a soldier came forward to
reconnoitre us. I could no longer doubt the safety of the party,
and this was confirmed by the rest of the men turning out to
welcome us. It appeared that our suspicions with regard to the
natives had not been without foundation, since they attempted to
surprise the camp, and it was supposed the firing of the marshes
was done with a view to collect the distant tribes, to make a
second attack; so that our arrival was most opportune. The party
I found awaiting our arrival at Mount Harris consisted of one
soldier, Riley, who had the charge of the supplies, and a
drayman. They had found the paper I had fixed against the tree,
and also the letters I had hid, and had forwarded them to Sydney,
by another soldier and a prisoner; <!--page 112 ENCAMP AT MOUNT HARRIS. /page-->which had weakened their party
a good deal. Riley informed me, that he had been between a month
and three weeks at the station, and that knowing our provisions
must have run short he had expected us much earlier than we had
made our appearance. </p>

<p>My dispatches stated, that additional supplies had been
forwarded for my use, together with horses and bullocks, in the
event of my requiring them. On examination, the former were found
to be in excellent order; and, as it would take some time to
carry any changes I might contemplate, or find it necessary to
make, into effect, I determined to give the men who had been with
me a week's rest. </p>

<p>The camp was made snug; and as the weather had become much
cooler I thought it a good opportunity to slaughter one of the
bullocks, in order to guard against any bad effects of our having
been living for some weeks exclusively on salt provisions. I was
also induced to this measure, from a wish to preserve my supplies
as much as possible. </p>

<p>These matters having been arranged, I had a temporary awning
erected near the river, and was for three or four days busily
employed writing an account of our journey for the Governor's
information. </p>

<p>Having closed my despatches, and answered the numerous
friendly letters I had received, my attention was next turned to
the changes that had taken place at Mount Harris during our
absence. The Macquarie, I found, had wholly <!--page 113 FIRING OF THE GREAT MARSHES. /page-->ceased to flow, and
now consisted of a chain of ponds. Such of the minor vegetation
as had escaped the fires of the natives, had perished under the
extreme heat of the season. The acacia pendula stood leafless
upon the plains, and the polygonum junceum appeared to be the
only plant that had withstood the effects of the drought. Yet,
notwithstanding this general depression of the vegetable kingdom,
the animals that had been brought from Wellington Valley were in
the best condition, and were, indeed, too fat for effective
labour; it might, therefore, be reasonably presumed, that herbage
affording such nourishment in so unfavourable a season, would be
of the richest quality, if fresh and vigorous under the influence
of seasonable, and not excessive, rains. </p>

<p>The appearance of the country was, however, truly melancholy;
there was not a flower in bloom, nor a green object to be seen.
Whether our arrival had increased their alarm, is uncertain, but
the natives continued to fire the great marshes, and as the
element raged amongst them, large bodies of smoke rose over the
horizon like storm clouds, and had the effect of giving
additional dreariness to the scene. I am inclined to think that
they made these conflagrations to procure food, by seizing
whatsoever might issue from the flames, as snakes, birds, or
other animals; for they had taken every fish in the river, and
the low state of its waters had enabled them to procure an
abundance of muscles from its bed, which they had consumed with
their characteristic improvidence. They were, consequently, in a
starving condition, and so pitiable were their indications of it,
that I <!--page 114 SLAUGHTER OF TWO IRISH RUNAWAYS. /page-->was induced to feed such of them as visited the camp,
notwithstanding their late misconduct; being likewise anxious to
bring about a good understanding, as the best means of ensuring
the safety of the smaller party when we should separate, of which
I had reason to be doubtful. These people had killed two white
men not long before my arrival among them, and as the
circumstances attending the slaughter are singular, I shall
relate them. </p>

<p>The parties were two Irish runaways, who thought they could
make their way to Timor. They escaped from Wellington Valley with
a fortnight's provision each, and a couple of dogs, and proceeded
down the Macquarie. About the cataract, they fell in with the
Mount Harris tribe, and remained with them for some days, when
they determined on pursuing their journey. The blacks, however,
wanted to get possession of their dogs, and a resistance on the
part of the Europeans brought on a quarrel. It appears, that
before the blacks proceeded to extremities, they furnished the
Irishmen, who were unarmed, with weapons, and then told them to
defend themselves, but whether against equal or inferior numbers,
I am uninformed. One of them soon fell, which the other
observing, he took his knife out, and cut the throats of both the
dogs before the blacks had time to put him to death. He was,
however, sacrificed; and both the men were eaten by the tribe
generally. I questioned several on the subject, but they
preserved the most sullen silence, neither acknowledging nor
denying the fact. </p>

<p>Mr. Hume had been one day on Mount Harris, and while <!--page 115 ARBUTHNOT'S RANGE. /page-->there,
had laid his compass on a large rock, near to which Mr. Oxley's
boat had been burnt. To his surprise, he found the needle
affected; and his bearings were all wrong. I subsequently went up
to ascertain the extent of the error produced, and found it
precisely the same as Mr. Hume noticed. When I placed the compass
on the rock, Mount Foster bore from me N. by W., the true bearing
of the one hill from the other being N.N.W. My placing my
notebook under the compass did not alter the effect, nor did the
card move until I raised the instrument a couple of feet above
the stone, when it first became violently agitated, and then
settled correctly; and my bearings of the highest parts of
Arbuthnot's Range, and of its centre, were as follows:</p>

</table>

<p>Having finished my reports and letters, it became necessary to
consider the best point on which to move, and to fix a day for
our departure from Mount Harris. It struck me that having found
so important a feature as the Darling River, the Governor would
approve my endeavouring to regain it more to the southward, in
order to trace it down. I, therefore, detached Mr. Hume to survey
the country in that direction, and to ascertain if a descent upon
the Bogen district would be practicable, through which I had been
informed a considerable river forced itself. The <!--page 116 CIRCUIT OF THE GREAT MARSHES. /page-->report he made
on his return was such as to deter me from that attempt, but he
stated that the country for 30 miles from the Macquarie was well
watered, and superior to any he had passed over during the
journey; beyond that distance, it took up the character of the
remote interior, and alternated with plains and brush, the soil
being too sandy to retain water on its surface. He saw some hills
from the extremity of his journey, bearing by compass W.S.W. We
consequently determined to make for the Castlereagh, agreeably to
our instructions. Preparations were made for breaking up the
camp, all the various arrangements in the change of animals were
completed, the boat carriage was exchanged for a dray, and I took
Boyle in the place of Norman, whose timidity in the bush rendered
him unfit for service. </p>

<p>There is a small hill on the opposite side of the river, and
immediately facing Mount Harris, and to the S.E. of it there is a
small lagoon, the head of a creek, by means of which its
superfluous waters are carried off. This creek runs parallel to
the river for about ten miles, and enters the marshes at the S.E.
angle. This I ascertained one day in riding to carry on my survey
of the southern extremity of the marshes, and to join my line of
route by making the circuit of that part of them. I found that
the river was turned to its northerly course by a rising ground
of forest land, which checks its further progress westerly. I
proceeded round the S.W. angle, and then, taking a northerly
course, got down to the bottom of the first great marsh, thus com<!--page 117 WALLIS'S PONDS. /page-->pleting
the circuit of them. I did not return to the camp until after 10
p.m., having crossed the river at day-light, nor did we procure
any water from the time we left the stream to the moment of our
recrossing it. </p>

<p>Having completed our various arrangements, and closed our
letters, we struck our tents on the morning of the 7th March; we
remained, however, to witness the departure of Riley's party for
Wellington Valley, and then left the Macquarie on an E.N.E.
course for Wallis's Ponds, and made them at about 14 miles. They
undoubtedly empty themselves into the marshes, and are a
continuation of that chain of ponds on which I left the party in
Mr. Hume's charge. About a mile from Mount Harris, we passed a
small dry creek, that evidently lays the country under water in
the wet seasons. There was a blue-gum flat to the eastward of it,
which we crossed, and then entered a brush of acacia pendula and
box. The soil upon the plain was an alluvial deposit; that in the
brushes was sandy. From the extremity of the plain, Mount Harris
bore, by compass, S.W. by W.; Mount Foster due west. The scrub
through which we were penetrating, at length became so dense,
that we found it impossible to travel in a direct line through
it, and frequent ridges of cypresses growing closely together,
turned us repeatedly from our course. The country at length
became clearer, and we travelled over open forest of box,
casuarina, and cypresses, on a sandy soil; the first
predominating. For about two miles before we made the creek, the
country was not heavily timbered, the acacia <!--page 118 MORRISSET'S PONDS. /page-->pendula succeeding
the larger trees. The ground had a good covering of grass upon
it, and there were few of the salsolaceous plants, so abundant on
the western plains, to be found. The rough-gum abounded near the
creek, with a small tree bearing a hard round nut, and we had the
luxury of plenty of water. </p>

<p>We remained stationary on the 8th, in hopes that Riley would
have met the soldier who had been sent back to Wellington Valley,
and that he would have forwarded any letters to us, of which he
might have been the bearer. The day, however, passed over without
realizing our expectations; and we started once more for the
interior, and cut ourselves off from all communication with
society. </p>

<p>We made for Morrisset's chain of ponds, and travelled over
rich and extensive plains, divided by plantations of cypress,
box, and casuarina, in the early and latter period of the day.
About noon we entered a dense forest of cypresses, which
continued for three miles, when the cypresses became mixed with
casuarina, box, and mountain-gum, a tree we had not remarked
before in so low a situation. We struck upon the creek after a
journey of about 15 miles. It had a sandy bed, and was extremely
tortuous in its course, nor was it until after a considerable
search, that we at length succeeded in finding water, at which a
party of natives were encamped. The moment they saw us, they
fled, and left all their utensils, &amp;c. behind them. Among
other things, we found a number of bark troughs, filled with the
gum of the mimosa, and vast quantities of gum made <!--page 119 REACH THE CASTLEREAGH RIVER. /page-->into cakes
upon the ground. From this it would appear these unfortunate
creatures were reduced to the last extremity, and, being unable
to procure any other nourishment, had been obliged to collect
this mucilaginous food. </p>

<p>The plains we traversed, were of uniform equality of surface.
Water evidently lodges and continues on them long after a fall of
rain, and in wet seasons they must, I should imagine, be full of
quagmires, and almost impassable. </p>

<p>On the 10th, we passed through a country that differed in no
material point from that already described. We stopped at 10 a.m.
under some brush, in the centre of a large plain, from which
Arbuthnot's range bore S. 84 E. distant from 50 to 55 miles, and
afterwards traversed or rather crossed, those extensive tracts
described by Mr. Evans as being under water and covered with
reeds, in 1817. They now bore a very different appearance, being
firm and dry. The soil was in general good, and covered with
forest grass and a species of oxalia. We did not observe any
reeds, or the signs of inundation, but, as is invariably the case
with plains in the interior, they were of too even surface, as I
have so lately remarked, to admit of the waters running quickly
off them; and no doubt, when they became saturated, many
quagmires are formed, that would very much impede the movements
of an expedition. </p>

<p>We reached the Castlereagh about 4 p.m., and although its
channel could not have been less than 130 yards in breadth, there
was apparently not a drop of water in it. Its bed consisted of
pure sand and reeds; amid the latter, <!--page 120 WANT OF WATER. /page-->we found a small pond of 15
yards circumference, after a long search. There is a considerable
dip in the country towards the river, at about two miles from it;
and the intervening brush was full of kangaroo, which, I fancy,
had congregated to a spot where there was abundance of food for
them. The soil covering the space was of the richest quality, and
the timber upon it consisted of box, mountain gum, and the
angophora lanceolata, a tree that is never found except on rich
ground. </p>

<p>It appeared that our troubles were to recommence, and that in
order to continue on the Castlereagh, it would be necessary for
Mr. Hume and myself to undertake those fatiguing journeys in
search of water that had so exhausted us already: and after all,
it was doubtful how soon we might be forced back. I had certainly
expected that, on our gaining the banks of the river, we should
have had a constant supply of water, but the circumstance of the
Castlereagh having not only ceased to flow, but being absolutely
dry, while it afforded the best and clearest proof of the
severity and continuance of the drought in the interior, at the
same time damped the spirits and ardour of the men. We kept the
left bank of the river as we proceeded down it, and passed two or
three larger ponds about a mile below where we had slept, but
there they ceased. The bed of the river became one of pure sand,
nor did there appear to be any chance of our finding any water in
it. I stopped the party at about eight miles, and desired the men
to get their dinners, to give Mr. Hume and myself time <!--page 121 CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY. /page-->to search
for a supply upon the plains. Disappointed to the left, we
crossed the channel of the Castlereagh, and struck over a small
plain upon the right bank, and at the extremity of it, came upon
a swamp, from which we immediately returned for the cattle, and
got them unloaded by seven o'clock. As there was sufficient
pasture around us, I proposed to Mr. Hume on the following day,
to leave the party stationary, and to ride down the river to see
how far its present appearances continued. Like the generality of
rivers of the interior, it had, where we struck upon it, outer
banks to confine its waters during floods, and to prevent them
from spreading generally over the country; the space between the
two banks being of the richest soil, and the timber chiefly of
the angophora kind. Flooded-gum overhung the inner banks of the
river, or grew upon the many islands, with casuarina. It became
evident, however, that the outer banks declined in height as we
proceeded down the river, nor was it long before they ceased
altogether. As we rode along, we found that the inner ones were
fast decreasing in height also. Riding under a hanging wood of
the angophora, which had ceased for a time, we were induced to
break off to our right, to examine some large flooded-gum trees
about a couple of miles to the N.W. of us. On arriving near them,
we were astonished to find that they concealed a serpentine
lagoon that had a belt of reeds round it. Keeping this lagoon
upon our right, we at length came to the head of it, past which
the river sweeps. Crossing the channel of the river, we continued
to ride in an easterly di<!--page 122 LAGOONS AND CREEKS /page-->rection to examine the country. In doing
this, we struck on a second branch of the Castlereagh, leading W.
by N. into a plain, which it of course inundates at times, and
running up it, we found its bed at the point of separation, to be
considerably higher than that of the main channel, which still
continued of pure sand&mdash;and was stamped all over with the
prints of the feet of natives, kangaroos, emus, and wild dogs, We
then turned again to the head of the lagoon, and took the
following bearings of Arbuthnot's range:</p>

<table border="0">

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Vernon's Peak . . </td>
        <td>E. 20 S.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>From the head of the lagoon, the river appeared to enter a
reedy hollow, shaded by a long line of flooded gum trees, and on
proceeding to it, we found the banks ceased here altogether; and
that a very considerable plain extended both to the right and the
left, which cannot fail of being frequently laid under water. </p>

<p>On the following morning we moved the party to the lagoon,
and, passing its head, encamped to the north of it; after which
we again rode down the river in search of water. It continued to
hold a straight and northerly course for about five miles, having
a plain on either side. The reeds that had previously covered the
channel then suddenly ceased, and the channel, contracting in
breadth, gained in depth: it became extremely serpentine, and at
length lost all the character and appearance of a river. It <!--page 123 OF THE CASTLEREAGH. /page-->had
many back channels, as large as the main one, serving to overflow
the neighbouring country. We succeeded in finding a small pond of
water in one of the former, hardly large enough to supply our
necessities, but as it enabled us to push so much further on, we
turned towards the lagoon, making a circuitous journey to the
right, across a large plain, bounded to the north by low acacia
brush and box. We struck upon a creek at the further extremity of
the plain, in which there was a tolerably sized pond. It appeared
from the traces of men, that some natives had been there the day
before; but we did not see any of them. The water was extremely
muddy and unfit for use. The lagoon at which we had encamped, was
of less importance than we had imagined. </p>

<p>Whilst Mr. Hume led the party down the river, I rode up its
northward bank, to examine it more closely. I found it to be a
serpentine sheet of about three miles in length, gradually
decreasing in depth until it separated into two small creeks. In
following one of them up, I observed that they re-united at the
distance of about two miles, and that the lagoon was filled from
the eastward, and not by the river as I had at first supposed.
The waters at the head of the lagoon were putrid, nor was there a
fish in, or a wild fowl upon it. The only bird we saw was a
beautiful eagle, of the osprey kind, with plumage like a sea
gull, which had a nest in the tree over the tents. </p>

<p>In turning to overtake the party I rode through a great deal
of acacia scrub, and on arriving at the place at which <!--page 124 JOURNEY DOWN /page-->I expected
to have overtaken them, I found they had pushed on. </p>

<p>The Castlereagh, as I rode down it, diminished in size
considerably, and became quite choked up with rushes and
brambles. Rough-gum again made its appearance, with swamp-oak and
a miserable acacia scrub outside. The country on both sides of
the river seemed to be an interminable flat, and the soil of an
inferior description. </p>

<p>I came up with with Mr. Hume about 1 o'clock and we again
pushed forward at 3, and halted for the night without water, the
want of which the cattle did not feel. The river held a general
westerly course, and the country in its neighbourhood became
extremely depressed and low. On the following day we moved
forward a distance of not more than nine miles, through a country
on which, at first, the acacia pendula alone was growing on a
light alluvial soil. The river had many back drains, by means of
which, in wet seasons, it inundates the adjacent plains. It was
evident, however, that they had not been flooded for many years;
and, notwithstanding that the country was low, the line of
inundation did not appear to be very extensive, nor were there
any reeds growing beyond the immediate banks of the river.
Swamp-oak and rough-gum again prevailed near the stream at our
halting place, and the improvement that had taken place, both in
the country and in the Castlereagh, had induced us to make so
short a journey; for not only was there abundance of the grass
for the animals, but large ponds of water in the river. Some
natives <!--page 125 THE RIVER. /page-->had only just preceded us down it: we came upon their
fires that were still smoking; and upon them were the remains of
some fish they had taken, near which they had left a cumbrous
spear. The circumstances cheered us with hopes that an
improvement would take place in the country, and that some new
feature would soon open upon us. In the course of the following
day, however, every favorable change, both in the river and in
the country, disappeared. The latter continued extremely
depressed, and in general open, or lightly covered with acacia
pendula; the former dwindled into a mere ditch, choked up with
brambles and reeds, and having only here and there a stagnant
pool of water. We travelled on a N.W. 1/2 W. course for about ten
miles, and again stopped for the night without water. In the
course of the afternoon, we traversed several flats, on which the
rough-gum alone was growing. These flats were evidently subject
to flood; and contained an alluvial soil. </p>

<p>They became more frequent as we travelled down the river, and
the work was so heavy for the animals, that I was obliged to keep
wide of them, in doing which we struck upon a creek of large
size, coming from the N.E. and, having crossed, we traversed its
right bank to its junction with the Castlereagh, and stopped
close to it at a pond of water, though the feed for the animals
was bad. The country to the left of the river, though somewhat
high, was the same, in essential points, as that to the right. <!--page 126 WRETCHED APPEARANCE OF THE COUNTRY. /page--> </p>

<p>The Castlereagh seemed to have increased in size below the
creek, but still it had no resemblance to a river. We had not
proceeded very far down its banks, on the 18th, when we crossed a
broad footpath leading to it from the interior. I turned my horse
to the left, and struck upon a long sheet of water, from which I
startled a number of pelicans. It was evident that the natives
had recently been in the neighbourhood, but we thought it
probable they might have been a hunting party, who had returned
again to the plains. The whole track we passed over during the
day was miserably poor and bare of vegetation, nor did the
appearance of the country to the N.E. indicate any improvement.
We lost the traces of the natives immediately after crossing
their path or beat, and again found the bed of the river dry,
after we had passed the sheet of water to which it led. The soil
was so rotten and yielding, that the team knocked up early;
indeed, it was a matter of surprise to me that they should not
have failed before. The river made somewhat to the westward with
little promise of improvement. The wretched appearance of the
country as we penetrated into it, damped our spirits; we pressed
on, however, with difficulty, over ground that was totally
destitute of vegetation. Instead of lofty timber and a living
stream, we wandered along the banks of an insignificant
watercourse, and under trees of stunted size and scanty foliage.
We stopped on the 20th at the angle of a creek, in which there
was some dry grass, in consequence of the animals being almost in
a starving state, but even here they had but little to eat. <!--page 127 A PARTY OF NATIVES. /page--> </p>

<p>A violent thunder-storm passed over us in the afternoon, but
it made no change in the temperature of the air. The weather,
although it had been hot and sultry, had fallen far short of the
intense heat we experienced in crossing the marshes of the
Macquarie, when it was such as to melt the sugar in the
canisters, and to destroy all our dogs; and our nights were now
become agreeably cool. </p>

<p>We still, however, continued to travel over a dead level, nor
was a height or break visible from the loftiest trees we
ascended. A little before we stopped at the creek, we surprised a
party of natives; old men, women, and children. They were
preparing dinners of fish in much larger quantities than they
could have devoured&mdash;probably for a part of the tribe
that were absent; but the moment they saw us they fled, and left
every thing at our mercy. On examining the fish, we found them
totally different from any in the Macquarie, and took two of the
most perfect to preserve. In the afternoon one of the men came to
inform me that the tribe was coming down upon us. </p>

<p>Mr. Hume and I, therefore, went to meet them. They were at
this time about 150 yards from the tent, but seeing us advance,
they stopped, and forming two deep, they marched to and fro, to a
war song I suppose, crouching with their spears. We had not,
however, any difficulty in communicating with them, and I shall
detail the manner in which this was brought about, in hopes that
it may help to guide others. When the natives saw us advance,
they stopped, and we did the same. Mr. Hume then walked to a
tree, and broke <!--page 128 LARGE CREEK. /page-->off a short branch. It is singular that this
should, even with these rude people, be a token of peace. As soon
as they saw the branch, the natives laid aside their spears, and
two of them advanced about twenty paces in front of the rest, who
sat down. Mr. Hume then went forward and sat down, when the two
natives again advanced and seated themselves close to him. </p>

<p>Now it is evident that a little insight into the customs of
every people is necessary to insure a kindly communication; this,
joined with patience and kindness, will seldom fail with the
natives of the interior. It is not to avoid alarming their
natural timidity that a gradual approach is so necessary. They
preserve the same ceremony among themselves. These men, who were
eighteen in number, came with us to the tents, and received such
presents as we had for them. They conducted themselves very
quietly, and, after a short time, left us with every token of
friendship. </p>

<p>On the 21st we proceeded down the river on a N.N.W. course,
and at about five miles struck upon a very large creek,
apparently coming from the E.N.E. </p>

<p>Although the Castlereagh had increased in size, this creek was
infinitely larger; it was, however, perfectly dry. Lofty
flooded-gum trees were upon its banks, and it appeared so much
superior to the river that I was induced to halt the party at the
junction, in order to examine it more closely. Mr. Hume,
therefore, rode with me up the right bank. We had not proceeded
very far, when some natives called out to us from the opposite
scrub. Thinking that they belonged <!--page 129 NATIVE ARMOURY. /page-->to the tribe we had left
behind us, we pointed to the junction, and motioned them to go
there, but one of the party continued to follow and call to us
for some time. On our return to the men, we found that the
natives had joined them, and they now gave us to understand that
we were going away from water. This had indeed been apparent to
us. The creek was perfectly dry, as far as we traced it up; and
seemed to have been totally deserted by the natives. </p>

<p>We were about to proceed on our journey, when from twenty to
thirty natives approached us from down the river. We sent two of
those who had been with us to them, and the whole accompanied us
for some miles, talking incessantly to the men, but keeping at a
very respectful distance from the animals. We at length got
opposite to their camp, near which there was a very fine pool of
water, and they were earnest in persuading us to stop at it. We
were, however, too anxious to get forward to comply; under the
improved appearance of the river since it had received the creeks
from the eastward, little anticipating what was before us. </p>

<p>The natives did not follow us beyond their own encampment.
Within sight of it, we came upon their armoury, if I may so term
it. Numerous spears were reared against the trees, and heaps of
boomerangs were lying on the ground. The spears were very heavy,
and half barbed; and it is singular that three of them were
marked with a broad arrow. We saw the natives watching us,
fearful, I <!--page 130 EXAMINATION OF CREEKS /page-->imagine, that we should help ourselves; but I would
not permit any of their weapons to be touched. </p>

<p>Pursuing our journey, we reached another creek, at about five
miles, similar to the last in appearance and size, and we crossed
it repeatedly during the afternoon. We had been induced to keep
along a native path in the hope that it would have led us to the
river by a short cut; but it eventually led us to this creek, and
away from the Castlereagh; for, notwithstanding that we
subsequently changed our course to the S.W., we failed, as we
supposed, again to strike upon the latter, and were obliged to
stop for the night on the banks of what appeared to be a third
large dry creek, which we intersected nearly at right angles. </p>

<p>We travelled through a good deal of brush during the day, nor
did the country change from the miserable and barren character it
had assumed for the last thirty or forty miles. The Castlereagh
had so frequently changed, that both Mr. Hume and myself were
puzzled as to the identity of the creek upon which we had halted.
We searched its bed in vain for water, although it was most
capacious. Under an impression that the river was still to the
south, and that we were at a point to which many watercourses
from the high lands tended, I crossed the creek early in the
morning, and held a S.W. course, over an open forest country. At
about eight miles, we came upon a large space over-run by the
polygonum junceum, a certain indication of flooded ground, and of
our consequent proximity to some stream. Accordingly, after
pushing through it, we struck <!--page 131 NEAR THE CASTLEREAGH. /page-->upon a small creek with abundance
of water in it. Whether this creek was the Castlereagh, which it
resembled much more than the one we had left in the morning, was
doubtful; but it was a great source of comfort to us to have so
unexpected a supply of water as that which was now at our
disposal. Whatever channel this was, whether a river or a creek,
our tracing it down would lead us in the direction we wished to
go, and probably to some junction. </p>

<p>The neighbourhood of the creek was well clothed with
vegetation, and the cattle found good feed; but the only trees
near it were rough-gum and casuarinae; the flooded-gum had again
disappeared. The soil of the forest land over which we journeyed
was a light sandy loam; and its timber consisted chiefly of
eucalypti, acacia pendula, and the angophora. </p>

<p>Some natives visited us in the afternoon, and among them, both
Mr. Hume and I recognised one of those we had seen on the
Darling. He also knew us again, but we could not make out from
him how far we were from that river. They stayed with us till
sunset, and then went down the creek, leaving their spears
against a tree, for which they said they would return. </p>

<p>On the 23rd we took up a W.N.W. course, and when we again
touched on the creek it was dry. This was at a distance of about
five miles from where we had slept. As the animals had not
recovered from their late privations, I deemed it better to halt
the party and to examine the creek for a few miles below us, that
in case it should prove des<!--page 132 EXAMINATION OF CREEKS /page-->titute of water, we might return to
that we had left. Mr. Hume accordingly rode down it for about
three miles, without success; and on his rejoining the men, we
returned with them to our last camp, or to within a short
distance of it. Wishing to examine the creek above our position,
I requested Mr. Hume to take two men with him, and to trace it
down in search of water, while I should proceed in the opposite
direction. I went from the camp at an early hour, and as I
wandered along the creek, I passed a regular chain of ponds. The
country on both sides of the creek was evidently subject to
flood, but more extensively to the south than to the north. From
the creek, I struck away to my left, and after penetrating
through a belt of swamp-oak and minor shrubs, got on a small
plain, which I crossed N.E. and, to my annoyance, found it
covered with rhagodia and salsolae. As I had not started with the
intention of sleeping, I turned to the S.W. a little before
sunset, and reached the tents between ten and eleven. I found Mr.
Hume awaiting me. He informed me that at about nine miles from
where we had turned back with the party, he had struck upon a
junction; and that as the junction was much larger than the
channel he had been tracing, he thought it better to follow it up
for a few miles. He found that it narrowed in width, and that its
banks became steep, with a fine avenue of flooded-gum trees
overhanging them. At four miles, he came upon another junction,
and at four miles more, found himself opposite to the ground on
which we had slept on the previous Saturday. From this point he
retraced the channel, <!--page 133 NEAR THE CASTLEREAGH. /page-->but not finding any water for three miles
below the lower junction, he returned to the camp, with a view of
prosecuting a longer journey on the morrow. Mr. Hume had become
impressed with an opinion, that the junction up which we had
slept was no other than the Castlereagh itself; and that our
position was on a creek, probably Morrisset's chain of ponds,
flowing into it. As the cattle wanted a few days' rest, Mr. Hume
and I determined to ride, unattended, along our track to our camp
of the 21st, and then to follow the channel upwards, until we
should arrive at the station of the natives, or until we should
have ridden to such a distance as would set our conjectures at
rest. In the morning, however, instead of running upon our old
track, we followed that of Mr. Hume to the junction, giving up
our first intention, with a view to ascertain if there existed
any water which we could, by an effort, gain, below where Mr.
Hume had been. The channel was very broad, with a considerable
fall in its bed, and, in appearance, more resembled the slope of
a lawn than the bed of a river. It had two gum-trees in the
centre of its channel, in one of which the floods had left the
trunk of a large tree. We could discover where it narrowed and
its banks rose, but, as we intended to make a closer examination
before we left the neighbourhood, we continued our journey down
the principal channel. The ground exhibited an abundance of
pasture in its immediate neighbourhood, but the distant country
was miserably poor and bare. At about three miles, we came upon
the fresh traces of some natives, which led us to the channel
again, from which we had wandered <!--page 134 DEPRESSION OF THE MEN. /page-->unintentionally. In it we found
there had been water very lately, and it appeared that the
natives had dug holes at the bottom to insure a longer supply.
These were now exhausted, but still retained the appearance of
moisture. At a mile and a half beyond these, we were led to some
similar holes, by observing a number of birds flying about them.
The water was too muddy for us to drink, but the horses emptied
them successively. We now kept sufficiently near the channel to
insure our seeing any pool that might still remain in it, but
rode for about seven miles before we again saw water, and even
here, although it was a spring, we were obliged to dig holes, and
await their filling, before we could get sufficient for our use.
Having dined, we again pursued our journey, and almost
immediately came upon a long narrow ditch, full of water, and
lined by bulrushes. The creek or river had for some time kept the
centre of a deep alluvial valley, in which there was plenty of
food for the cattle, and which, at this place, was apparently
broader than anywhere else. The situation being favourable, we
returned to the camp, and reached it late. </p>

<p>I do not know whether I was wrong in my conjecture, but I
fancied, about this time, that the men generally were desponding.
Whether it was that the constant fatigue entailed on myself and
Mr. Hume, and that our constant absence, or the consequent
exhaustion it produced, had any effect on their minds, or that
they feared the result of our perseverance, is difficult to say;
but certainly, they all had a depression of spirits, and looked,
I thought, altered in <!--page 135 CAMP OF NATIVES. /page-->appearance; nor did they evince any
satisfaction at our success&mdash;at least, not the
satisfaction they would have shown at an earlier period of our
journey. </p>

<p>Before moving forward, it remained for us to ascertain if the
channel from the junction was the Castlereagh, or only a creek.
The intersection of so many channels in this neighbourhood, most
of them so much alike, made it essentially necessary that we
should satisfy ourselves on this point. Mr. Hume, therefore,
accompanied me, as had at first been intended the morning of our
return to the place at which we had slept. We took fresh horses,
but dispensed with any other attendants, and indeed went wholly
unarmed. </p>

<p>After following our old track to its termination, we kept up
the right bank of the channel, and at length arrived at the camp
of the natives; thus satisfying ourselves that we had been
journeying on the Castlereagh, and that we were still following
it down. By this ride we ascertained that there was a distance of
five-and-forty miles in its bed without a drop of water. Few of
the natives were in the camp. The women avoided us, but not as if
they were under any apprehension. Crossing at the head of the
pool, we again got on our old track, but seeing two or three men
coming towards us we alighted, and, tying our horses to a tree,
went to meet them. One poor fellow had two ducks in his hand,
which he had just taken off the fire; these he offered to us, and
on our declining to accept of them, he called to a boy, who soon
appeared with a large trough of honey, of which we partook. One
of the men had an ulcer in the <!--page 136 DRY CHANNEL OF THE RIVER. /page-->arm, and asked me what he should
do to heal it; indeed, I believe Fraser had promised him some
ointment, but not having any with me, I signified to him that he
should wash it often, and stooping down, made as if I was taking
up water in my hand. The poor fellow mistook me, and, also
stooping down, took up a handful of dust which he threw over the
sore. This gave me the trouble of explaining matters again, and
by pointing to the water, I believe I at length made him
understand me. </p>

<p>These good natured people asked us where we had slept the day
we passed, and when informed of the direction, shook their heads,
motioning at the same time, that we must have been without water.
We informed them where the party was, and asked them to come and
see us, but I fancy the distance was too great, or else we were
in the beat of another tribe. On mentioning these facts to the
men, they said that two of the natives had followed us for some
miles, calling out loudly to us, but Mr. Hume and I both being in
front, we did not hear them, although, evidently, they wished to
save us distress. </p>

<p>Since the result of our excursion proved that the channel,
about which I had been so doubtful, was the Castlereagh, it
necessarily followed, that the creek at which we were encamped
was one of those (most probably Morrisset's chain of ponds,)
which we had already crossed nearer its source, and which Mr.
Hume must have struck upon when endeavouring to gain the
Castlereagh from the marshes of the Macquarie. <!--page 137 NATIVES PERISHING FROM FAMINE. /page--> </p>

<p>A perusal of these sheets will ere this have impressed on the
reader's mind, the peculiarity of that fortune which led us from
the Castlereagh to the creek, at which alone our wants could have
been supplied. Had we wandered down the river, as we undoubtedly
should have done had we recognised it as such, the loss of many
of our animals would have been the inevitable consequence, and
very probably a final issue would have been put to our journey.
It is only to those who are placed in situations that baffle
their own exertions or foresight, that the singular guidance of
Providence becomes fully apparent. </p>

<p>It would appear that the natives were dying fast, not from any
disease, but from the scarcity of food; and, should the drought
continue, it seemed probable they may became extinct. </p>

<p>The men found the body of a woman covered with leaves near the
tents, and very properly buried it. We made Friday a day of rest
for ourselves, as indeed was necessary; and on the following
morning proceeded down the river, and encamped on a high bank
above it, at the base of which, our cattle both fed and watered. </p>

<p>At this spot one of the largest gum-trees I had ever seen had
fallen, having died for want of moisture; indeed, the state of
the vegetable kingdom was such as to threaten its total
extinction, unless a change of seasons should take place. </p>

<p>It may be worthy of remark that, from our first arrival <!--page 138 JUNCTION OF THE CASTLEREAGH /page-->on the
banks of the Castlereagh, to our arrival at the present camp, we
never picked up a stone, or a pebble, in its bed. </p>

<p>In the hope that we should fall on some detached pond, we
pursued our journey on the 29th. The Castlereagh gave singular
proofs of its violence, as if its waters, confined in the valley,
had a difficulty in escaping from it. We had not travelled two
miles, when in crossing, as we imagined, one of its bights, we
found ourselves checked by a broad river. A single glimpse of it
was sufficient to tell us it was the Darling. At a distance of
more than ninety miles nearer its source, this singular river
still preserved its character, so strikingly, that it was
impossible not to have recognised it in a moment. The same steep
banks and lofty timber, the same deep reaches, alive with fish,
were here visible as when we left it. A hope naturally arose to
our minds, that if it was unchanged in other respects, it might
have lost the saltness that rendered its waters unfit for use;
but in this we were disappointed&mdash;even its waters
continued the same. As it was impossible for us to cross the
Darling, I determined on falling back upon our last encampment,
which was at a most Convenient distance, and of concerting
measures there for our future movements. Prior to doing so,
however, I rode to the junction of the Castlereagh with the
Darling, accompanied by Mr. Hume, a distance of about half a
mile. Upon the point formed by the two streams, there were a
number of huts, and on the opposite <!--page 139 WITH THE DARLING. /page-->bank of the Darling, about
twenty natives had collected. We called out to them, but they
would not join us. </p>

<p>At the junction, the Castlereagh, with whatever impetuosity it
rushes from its confinement, makes not apparently the least
impression on the Darling River. The latter seemed to loll on,
totally heedless of such a tributary.</p>

<p>On our return to the party, we found them surrounded by the
natives, who were looking with an eye of wonder on the cattle and
horses. We pointed out to them the direction in which we were
going, and invited them to visit us; and nothing appeared to
astonish them so much as the management of the team by a single
man. We got back to our position early, and again fixed ourselves
upon it. </p>

<p>It now only remained for us to consider what we should do
under circumstances of certainly more than ordinary perplexity.
We had nothing to hope for from travelling in a southerly
direction, while to the E. and N.E., the state of the country was
worse than that by which we had penetrated to the Darling. It was
evident, that the large creeks joining the Castlereagh in that
direction were dry, since <!--page 141 HONESTY OF A NATIVE. /page-->the natives not only intimated this to
us, but it was unquestionable that they themselves had deserted
them, and had crowded to such places as still contained a supply
of water. Even in retreating, we could not hope to retrace our
steps. Experience had proved to us, that the dry state of the
interior was as injurious to the movements of an expedition as a
too wet season would have been. Taking everything, therefore,
into consideration, I determined on leaving the party stationary,
and on crossing the Darling to the N.W., and, if any encouraging
feature presented itself, to return for the party, and persevere
in an examination of the distant interior. Such, at least,
appeared to me the most judicious plan: indeed, an attempt to
have moved in any other direction would have been fruitless. And,
as the result of this journey would be decisive, and would either
fix or determine our advance or retreat, I was anxious for Mr.
Hume's attendance. </p>

<p>The natives followed to the camp, and in the course of the
afternoon, were joined by their women. The latter however, would
not approach nearer than the top of a little hillock on which
they sat. The men did not come round the tents, but stood in a
row at a short distance. At sunset, they gained a little courage,
and wandered about a little more; at length they went off to the
Darling. </p>

<p>It was quite dark, when I heard a native call from the hill on
which the women had been, and I desired Hopkinson to take his
firelock and ascertain what the man wanted. He soon after
returned, and brought a blanket, <!--page 142 REWARD THE MAN FOR HIS CONDUCT. /page-->which he said the man had
returned to him. The native was alone, and when he offered the
blanket, kept his spear poised in his right hand; but, seeing
that no violence was intended him, he lowered his weapon, and
walked away. </p>

<p>I was extremely pleased at this trait of honesty, and
determined to reward it. On inquiry, I found that the men had
availed themselves of the day to wash their blankets and that one
of them had been flung over a bush hanging over the bank of the
river, and it was supposed that one of the natives must have
pulled it down with him. In the morning, the tribe went away from
their encampment before day-light as we judged from the cry of
their dogs, than which nothing could be more melancholy; but
about eight, the men made their appearance on the hill occupied
by the women the evening previously, and seemed to be doubtful
whether to approach nearer. I went out to them, and, with a
downward motion of my hand, beckoned for them to come to me: they
mistook the signal, but laid all their spears on the ground, and
it was not until after the sign had been reversed that they
stirred or moved towards me. I then got them in a row, and
desired Hopkinson to single out the man who had given him the
blanket. It was, however, with great difficulty that he
recognised him, as the man stood firm and motionless. At length,
after walking two or three times along the line, he stopped
before one man, and put his hand on his shoulder, upon which the
manner of the native testified as to the correctness of his
guess. <!--page 143 EFFECT OF FIRING A GUN. /page--> </p>

<p>The blanket being produced, I explained to the savage, with
Mr. Hume's assistance, that I was highly pleased with him, and
forthwith presented him with a tomahawk and a clasp-knife. The
tribe were perfectly aware of the reason of my conduct, and all
of them seemed highly delighted. </p>

<p>I was happy in having such an opportunity of showing the
natives of the interior that I came among them with a
determination to maintain justice in my communication with them,
and to impress them, at the same time, with a sense of our love
of it in them. That they appreciated my apparent lenity in not
calling for the defaulter, I am sure, and I feel perfectly
conscious that I should have failed in my duty had I acted
otherwise than I did. </p>

<p>Although the natives had shown so good a disposition, as they
were numerous, I thought it as well, since I was about to leave
the camp, to show them that I had a power they little dreamt of
about me. I therefore called for my gun and fired a ball into a
tree. The effect of the report upon the natives, was truly
ridiculous. Some stood and stared at me, others fell down, and
others ran away; and it was with some difficulty we collected
them again. At last, however, we did so, and, leaving them to
pick out the ball, mounted our horses and struck away for the
Darling. We crossed the river a little above where we struck it,
and then proceeded N.W. into the interior. </p>

<p>It is impossible for me to describe the nature of the country
over which we passed, for the first eight miles. <!--page 144 EXCURSION ACROSS THE DARLING. /page-->We rode through
brushes of polygonum, under rough-gum, without a blade of
vegetation, the whole space being subject to inundation. We then
got on small plains of firmer surface, and red soil, but these
soon changed again for the former; and at 4 p.m. we found
ourselves advanced about two miles on a plain that stretched away
before us, and bounded the horizon. It was dismally brown; a few
trees only served to mark the distance. Up one of the highest I
sent Hopkinson, who reported that he could not see the end of it,
and that all around looked blank and desolate. It is a singular
fact, that during the whole day, we had not seen a drop of water
or a blade of grass. </p>

<p>To have stopped where we were, would, therefore, have been
impossible; to have advanced, would probably have been ruin. Had
there been one favorable circumstance to have encouraged me with
the hope of success, I would have proceeded. Had we picked up a
stone as indicating our approach to high land, I would have gone
on; or had there been a break in the level of the country, or
even a change in the vegetation. But we had left all traces of
the natives far behind us; and this seemed a desert they never
entered&mdash;that not even a bird inhabited. I could not
encourage a hope of success, and, therefore, gave up the point;
not from want of means, but a conviction of the inutility of any
further efforts. If there is any blame to be attached to the
measure, it is I who am in fault, but none who had not like me
traversed the interior at such a season, would believe the state
of the country over which <!--page 145 DESOLATING EFFECTS OF THE DROUGHT. /page-->I had wandered. During the short
interval I had been out, I had seen rivers cease to flow before
me, and sheets of water disappear; and had it not been for a
merciful Providence, should, ere reaching the Darling, have been
overwhelmed by misfortune. </p>

<p>I am giving no false picture of the reality. So long had the
drought continued, that the vegetable kingdom was almost
annihilated, and minor vegetation had disappeared. In the creeks,
weeds had grown and withered, and grown again; and young saplings
were now rising in their beds, nourished by the moisture that
still remained; but the largest forest trees were drooping, and
many were dead. The emus, with outstretched necks, gasping for
breath, searched the channels of the rivers for water, in vain;
and the native dog, so thin that it could hardly walk, seemed to
implore some merciful hand to despatch it. How the natives
subsisted it was difficult to say, but there was no doubt of the
scarcity of food among them. </p>

<p>We arrived in camp at a late hour, and having nothing to
detain us longer, prepared for our retreat in the morning. The
natives had remained with the party during the greater part of
the day, and had only left them a short time prior to our
arrival, </p>

<p>When examining the creek on which we had been encamped for
some days, Mr. Hume observed a small junction; and as we knew we
were almost due N. of the marshes of the Macquarie, both of us
were anxious to <!--page 146 WILD MELON. /page-->ascertain whence it originated. To return to
Mount Harris, by retracing our steps up the Castlereagh, would
have entailed the severest distress upon us; we the rather
preferred proceeding up this creek, and taking our chance for a
supply of water. We therefore crossed Morrisset's chain of ponds,
and encamped in the angle formed by the junction of the two
creeks. </p>

<p>Before we left this position, we were visited by a party of
natives, twelve in number, but not of the Darling tribe. They
accompanied us a short way, and then struck off to the right. At
about a mile and a half, we crossed Mr. Hume's track, leading
westerly, which still remained observable. The creek was, no
doubt, the hollow he stated that he crossed on that excursion,
and its appearance certainly justified his opinion of it. Its bed
was choked up with bulrushes or the polygonum, and its banks were
level with the country on either side, or nearly so. We passed
over extremely rich soil the whole day, on a S.W. and by W.
course, though the timber upon it was dwarfish, and principally
of the rough-gum kind. </p>

<p>On the 2nd of April, we stopped in order to make some repairs
upon the dray; the wheels of which had failed us. Clayton put in
four new spokes, and we heated the tyres over again, by which
means we got it once more serviceable. </p>

<p>The soil in the creek was of the richest quality, and was
found to produce a dwarf melon, having all the habits and
character of the cucumber. The fruit was not larger than a
pigeon's egg, but was extremely sweet. There were not, <!--page 147 RETURN UP THE CREEK. /page-->however,
many ripe, although the runners were covered with flowers, and
had an abundance of fruit upon them. In the morning, we sent the
tinker on horseback up the creek, to ascertain how far the next
water was from us, desiring him to keep the creek upon his right,
and to follow his own track back again. He thought fit, however,
considering himself a good bushman, to wander away to his left,
and the consequence was, that he soon lost himself. It would
appear that he doubled and passed through some thick brush at the
back of the camp, and at length found himself at dark on the
banks of a considerable creek. In wandering along it, he luckily
struck upon the natives we had last seen, who, good-naturedly,
led him to the track of the dray, which his horse would not
afterwards desert, and the tinker sneaked into the tent about 3
o'clock in the morning, having failed in his errand, and made
himself the butt of the whole party. </p>

<p>The day succeeding this adventure, we moved up the creek,
which was, for the most part, even with the plain. The country
continued the same as that we had passed over from the junction,
being subject to flood, and having patches of bulrushes and reeds
upon it. No change took place in the timber, but the line of
acacia pendula, which forms the line of inundation, approached
neater to us; nor was the mark of flood so high on the trunks of
trees as below. We halted, with abominable water, but excellent
food for the animals in the plains behind us. In continuing our
journey, we found several changes take place in the appear<!--page 148 CONNECTION OF MACQUARIE AND DARLING. /page-->ance of
the creek and its neighbourhood. The former diminished in size,
and at length separated into two distinct channels, choked up,
for the most part, with dead bulrushes, but having a few green
reeds in patches along it. The flats on either side became
slightly timbered, and blue gum was the prevailing tree. Crossing
one of the channels, we observed every appearance of our near
approach to the marshes, the flats being intersected by many
little water-runs, such as we had noticed at the bottom of them.
About noon we struck upon a body of reeds under the wood of
eucalypti, below the second great morass, and keeping a little to
our right to avoid them, fell shortly afterwards into our old
track on the plain, upon which we continued to move, making the
best of our way to the channel which had supplied our wants on
our first return from the Darling. It was now, however, quite
dry, and we were obliged to push on further, to shorten the
journey of the morrow. </p>

<p>The result of our journey up the creek was particularly
satisfactory, both to myself and Mr. Hume; since it cleared up
every doubt that might have existed regarding the actual
termination of the Macquarie, and enabled us to connect the flow
of waters at so interesting and particular a point. It will be
seen by a reference to the chart, that the waters of the marshes,
after trickling through the reeds, form a small creek, which
carries off the superfluous part of them into Morrisset's chain
of ponds, which latter again falls into the Castlereagh, at about
eight miles to the W.N.W. and all three join the Darling in a W.
by N. direction, in lat. 30° <!--page 149 RETURN TO MOUNT HARRIS. /page-->52´ south and E. long. 147° 8´
at about 90 miles to the N.N.W. of Mount Harris, and about an
equal distance to the E.S.E. of where we struck upon the
last-mentioned river. Thus it is evident that the Darling had
considerably neared the eastern ranges, although it was still
more than 150 miles from their base. It was apparently coming
from the N.E., and whether it has its sources in the mountains
behind our distant settlements, or still farther to the
northwards, is a question of curious speculation, although, as I
have already stated, I am of opinion that none but tropical rains
could supply the furious torrent that must sometimes rage in it. </p>

<p>It would be presumptuous to hazard any opinion as to the
nature of the interior to the westward of that remarkable river.
Its course is involved in equal mystery, and it is a matter of
equal doubt whether it makes its way to the south coast, or
ultimately exhausts itself in feeding a succession of swamps, or
falls into a large reservoir in the centre of the island. </p>

<p>We reached Mount Harris on the 7th of the month, and moving
leisurely up the banks of the Macquarie, gained Mr. Palmer's
first station on the 14th, and Wellington Valley on the 21st,
having been absent from that settlement four months and two
weeks. The waters of the Macquarie had diminished so much, that
its bed was dry for more than half a mile at a stretch, nor did
we observe the least appearance of a current in it, until after
we had ascended the ranges. The lower tribes were actually
starving, and brought their children to us to implore something
to eat. The men at<!--page 150 DEPLORABLE STATE OF THE COUNTRY. /page-->tempted to surprise the camp, but I believe
they were urged from absolute necessity to procure subsistence
for themselves, and that they intended robbery rather than
personal violence. </p>

<p>We left the interior in a still more deplorable state than
that in which we found it; but it is more than probable that
under other circumstances, we should have found it impossible to
traverse its distant plains, as it is certain that unless rain
fell in less than three weeks, all communication with the Darling
would have been cut off:</p>

<p>Whether the discoveries that have been made during this
expedition, will ultimately prove of advantage to the colony of
New South Wales, is a question that time alone can answer. We
have in the meanwhile to regret that no beneficial consequences
will immediately follow them. The further knowledge that has been
gained of the interior is but as a gleam of sunshine over an
extensive landscape. A stronger light has fallen upon the nearer
ground, but the distant horizon is still enveloped in clouds. The
veil has only as it were been withdrawn from the marshes of the
Macquarie to be spread over the channel of the Darling. Un<!--page 152 RESULT OF THE EXPEDITION. /page-->satisfactory,
however, as the discoveries may as yet be considered in a
commercial point of view, the objects for which the expedition
had been fitted out were happily attained. The marsh it had been
directed to examine, was traversed on every side, and the rivers
it had been ordered to trace, were followed down to their
terminations to a distance far beyond where they had ceased to
exist as living streams. To many who may cast their eyes over the
accompanying chart, the extent of newly discovered country may
appear trifling; but when they are told, that there is not a mile
of that ground that was not traversed over and over again, either
by Mr. Hume or by myself, that we wandered over upwards of 600
miles more than the main body of the expedition, on different
occasions, in our constant and anxious search for water, and that
we seldom dismounted from our horses, until long after sunset,
they will acknowledge the difficulties with which we had to
contend, and will make a generous allowance for them; for,
however unsuccessful in some respects the expedition may have
been, it accomplished as much, it is to be hoped, as under such
trying circumstances could have been accomplished. It now only
remains for me to sum up the result of my own observations, and
to point out to the reader, how far the actual state of the
interior, has been found to correspond with the opinions that
were entertained of it. </p>

<p>I have already stated, in the introduction to this work, that
the general impression on the minds of those best qualified to
judge was, that the western streams discharged themselves <!--page 153 MR. OXLEY'S REMARKS. /page-->into a
central shoal sea. Mr. Oxley thus expresses himself on the
subject:&mdash; </p>

<p>&ldquo;July 3rd. Towards morning the storm abated, and at
day-light, we proceeded on our voyage. The main bed of the river
was much contracted, but very deep; the waters spreading to the
depth of a foot or eighteen inches over the banks, but all
running on the same point of bearing. We met with considerable
interruptions from fallen timber, which in places nearly choked
up the channel. After going about twenty miles, we lost the land
and trees; the channel of the river, which lay through reeds, and
was from one to three feet deep, ran northerly.&mdash;This
continued for three or four miles farther, when, although there
had been no previous change in the breadth, depth, or rapidity of
the stream for several miles, and I was sanguine in my
expectations of soon entering the long-sought-for Australian sea,
it all at once eluded our farther pursuit, by spreading on every
point from N.W. to N.E. among the ocean of reeds which surrounded
us, still running with the same rapidity as before. There was no
channel whatever among those reeds, and the depth varied from
three to five feet. This astonishing change (for I cannot call it
a termination of the river) of course left me no alternative but
to endeavour to return to some spot on which we could effect a
landing before dark. I estimated, that during the day, we had
gone about twenty-four miles, on nearly the same point of bearing
as yesterday. To assert, positively, that we were on the margin
of the lake, or sea, into which this great body <!--page 154 MR. CUNNINGHAM'S REMARKS. /page-->of water is
discharged, might reasonably be deemed a conclusion, which has
nothing but conjecture for its basis. But if an opinion may be
permitted to be hazarded from actual appearances, mine is
decidedly in favour of our being in the immediate vicinity of an
inland sea, or lake, most probably a shoal one, and gradually
filling up by numerous depositions from the high lands, left by
the waters which flow into it. It is most singular, that the high
lands on this continent seem to be confined to the sea-coast, and
not to extend to any distance from it.&rdquo; </p>

<p>In a work published at Sydney, containing an account of Mr.
Allan Cunningham's journey towards Moreton Bay, in 1828, the
following remarks occur, from which it is evident Mr. Cunningham
entertained Mr. Oxley's views of the character and nature of the
Western interior. Towards the conclusion of the narrative, the
author thus observes:&mdash; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the probable character of the distant unexplored
interior, into which it has been ascertained <i>all</i> the
rivers falling westerly from the dividing ranges flow, some
inference may be drawn from the following data. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Viewing, between the parallels of 34° and 27°, a
vast area of depressed interior, subjected in seasons of
prolonged rains to partial inundation, by a dispersion of the
several waters that flow upon it from the eastern mountains
whence they originate; and bearing in mind at the same time, that
the declension of the country within the above parallels, as most
decidedly shown by the dip of its several rivers, is uniformly <!--page 155 CHARACTER OF THE RIVERS. /page-->to
the N.N.W. and N.W., it would appear very conclusive, that either
a portion of our distant interior is occupied by a lake of
considerable magnitude, or that the confluence of those large
streams, the Macquarie, Castlereagh, Gwydir, and the Dumaresq,
with the many minor interfluent waters, which doubtless takes
place upon those low levels, forms one or more noble rivers,
which may flow across the continent by an almost imperceptible
declivity of country to the north of north-west coasts, on
certain parts of which, recent surveys have discovered to us
extensive openings, by which the largest accumulations of waters
might escape to the sea.&rdquo; </p>

<p>It is the characteristic of the streams falling westerly from
the eastern, or coast ranges, to maintain a breadth of channel
and a rapidity of current more immediately near their sources,
that ill accords with their diminished size, and the sluggish
flow of their waters in the more depressed interior. In truth,
neither the Macquarie nor the Castlereagh can strictly be
considered as permanent rivers. The last particularly is nothing
more than a mountain torrent. The Macquarie, although it at
length ceased to run, kept up the appearance of a river to the
very marshes; but the bed of the Castlereagh might have been
crossed in many places without being noticed, nor did its channel
contain so much water as was to be found on the neighbouring
plains. </p>

<p>There are two circumstances upon which the magnitude, and
velocity of a river, more immediately depend. The first is the
abundance of its sources, the other the dip of its <!--page 156 MR. CUNNINGHAM'S REMARKS. /page-->bed. If a
stream has constant fountains at its head, and numerous
tributaries joining it in its course, and flows withal through a
country of gradual descent, such a stream will never fail; but if
the supplies do not exceed the evaporation and absorption, to
which every river is subject, if a river dependant on its head
alone, falls rapidly into a level country, without receiving a
single addition to its waters to assist the first impulse
acquired in their descent, it must necessarily cease to flow at
one point or other. Such is the case with the Lachlan, the
Macquarie, the Castlereagh, and the Darling. Whence the latter
originates, still remains to be ascertained; but most undoubtedly
its sources have been influenced by the same drought that has
exhausted the fountains of the three first mentioned streams. </p>

<p>In supporting his opinion of the probable discharge of the
interior waters of Australia upon its north-west coast, Mr.
Cunningham thus remarks in the publication from which I have
already made an extract. </p>

<p>&ldquo;To those remarkable parts of the north-west coast
above referred to in the parallel of 16° south, the Macquarie
river, which rises in lat. 33°, and under the meridian of 150°
east, would have a course of 2045 statute miles throughout, while
the elevation of its source, being 3500 feet above the level of
the sea as shown by the barometer, would give its waters an
average descent of twenty inches to the mile, supposing the bed
of the river to be an inclined plane. </p>

<p>&ldquo;The Gwydir originating in elevated land, lying in
31° south, and long. 151° east, at a mean height of 3000 feet, <!--page 157 MR. OXLEY'S OPINIONS. /page-->would
have to flow 2020 miles, its elevated sources giving to each a
mean fall of seventeen inches. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Dumaresq's river falling 2970 feet from granite
mountains, in 28 1/4° under the meridian of 152°, would have to
pursue its course for 2969 miles, its average fall being eighteen
inches to a mile.&rdquo; </p>

<p>As I have never been upon the banks either of the Gwydir or
the Dumaresq, I cannot speak of those two rivers; but in
estimating the sources of the Macquarie at 3500 feet above the
level of the sea, Mr. Cunningham has lost sight of, or overlooked
the fact, that the fall of its bed in the first two hundred
miles, is more than 2800 feet, since the cataract, which is
midway between Wellington Valley and the marshes, was ascertained
by barometrical admeasurement, to be 680 feet only above the
ocean. The country, therefore, through which the Macquarie would
have to flow during the remainder of its course of 1700 miles, in
order to gain the N.W. coast, would not be a gradually inclined
plain, but for the most part a dead level, and the fact of its
failure is a sufficient proof in itself how short the course of a
river so circumstanced must necessarily be. </p>

<p>Having conversed frequently with Mr. Oxley on the subject of
his expeditions, I went into the interior prepossessed in favour
of his opinions, nor do I think he could have drawn any other
conclusion than that which he did, from his experience of the
terminations of the rivers whose courses he explored. Had Mr.
Oxley advanced forty, or even thirty miles, farther than he did,
to the westward of <!--page 158 CAPT. KING'S OPINIONS. /page-->Mount Harris; nay, had he proceeded eight
miles in the above direction beyond the actual spot from which he
turned back, he would have formed other and very different
opinions of the probable character of the distant interior. But I
am aware that Mr. Oxley performed all that enterprise, and
perseverance, and talent could have performed, and that it would
have been impracticable in him to have attempted to force its
marshes in the state in which he found them. It was from his want
of knowledge of their nature and extent, that he inferred the
swampy and inhospitable character of the more remote country, a
state in which subsequent investigation has found it not to be.
The marsh of the Macquarie is nothing more than an ordinary marsh
or swamp in another country. However large a space it covers, it
is no more than a concavity or basin for the reception of the
waters of the river itself, nor has it any influence whatever on
the country to the westward of it, in respect to inundation; the
general features of the latter being a regular alternation of
plain and brush. These facts are in themselves sufficient to give
a fresh interest to the interior of the Australian continent, and
to increase its importance. </p>

<p>With respect to that part of its coast at which the rivers
falling from the eastern mountains, discharge themselves, it is a
question of very great doubt. It seems that Capt. King, in
consequence of some peculiarities in the currents at its N.W.
angle, supports Mr. Cunningham's opinion as to their probable
discharge in that quarter. But I fear the internal structure of
the continent is so low, as to preclude <!--page 159 COURSE OF THE DARLING. /page-->the hopes of any river
reaching from one extremity of it to the other. A variety of
local circumstances, as the contraction of a channel, a shoal
sea, or numerous islands, influence currents generally, but more
especially round so extensive a continent as that of which we are
treating; nor does it strike me that any observations made by
Capt. King during his survey, can be held to bear any connection
with the eastern ranges, or their western waters. It may,
however, be said, that as the course of the Darling is still
involved in uncertainty, the question remains undecided; but it
appears to me, the discovery of that river has set aside every
conjecture (founded on previous observation) respecting the main
features of the interior lying to the westward of the Blue
Mountains. Both Mr. Oxley and Mr. Cunningham drew their
conclusions from the appearances of the country they severally
explored. The ground on which those theories were built, has been
travelled over, and has not been found to realize them, but
subsequent investigation has discovered to us a river, the dip of
whose bed is to the S.W. We have every reason to believe that the
sources of this river must be far to the northward of the most
distant northerly point to which any survey has been made, as we
are certain that it is far beyond the stretch of vision from the
loftiest and most westerly of the barrier ranges; from which
circumstance, it is evident that whatever disposition the streams
descending from those ranges to the westward may show to hold a
N.W. course more immediately at the base, the whole of the
interior streams, from the Macquarie <!--page 160 CHARACTER OF THE WESTERN INTERIOR. /page-->to the Dumaresq, are
tributaries to the principal channel which conveys their united
waters at right angles, if not still more opposite to the
direction they were supposed to take, as far as is yet known. </p>

<p>The Darling River must be considered as the boundary line to
all inland discoveries from the eastward. Any judgment or opinion
of the interior to the westward of that stream, would be
extremely premature and uncertain. There is not a single feature
over it to guide or to strengthen either the one or the other. </p>

<p>My impression, when travelling the country to the west and
N.W. of the marshes of the Macquarie, was, that I was traversing
a country of comparatively recent formation. The sandy nature of
its soil, the great want of vegetable decay, the salsolaceous
character of its plants, the appearance of its isolated hills and
flooded tracts, and its trifling elevations above the sea,
severally contributed to strengthen these impressions on my mind.
My knowledge of the interior is, however, too limited to justify
me in any conclusion with regard to the central parts of
Australia. An ample field is open to enterprise and to ambition,
and it is to be hoped that some more decisive measures will be
carried into effect, both for the sake of the colony and of
geography, to fill up the blank upon the face of the chart of
Australia, and remove from us the reproach of indifference and
inaction. </p>

<p>Since the above pages were written, an expedition was
undertaken by Major Mitchell, the Surveyor-General, to <!--page 161 BARBER'S STATEMENT. /page-->ascertain
the truth of a report brought in by a runaway convict of the name
of Barber, or Clarke, who had been at large for five years, at
different times, among the natives to the northward of Port
Macquarie. This man stated that a large river, originating in the
high lands near Liverpool Plains, and the mountains to the north
of them, pursued a N.W. course to the sea. His story ran thus:
Having learnt from the natives the existence of this river, he
determined to follow it down, in hopes that he might ultimately
be enabled to make his escape from the colony. He accordingly
started from Liverpool Plains, and kept on a river called the
Gnamoi, for some time, which took him N.W. After a few days'
journey, he left this river, traversed the country northwards,
and crossed some lofty ranges. Descending to the N.E. he came to
another large river, the Keindur, which again took him N.W. He
travelled 400 miles down it, when he observed a large stream
joining it upon its left bank, which he supposed to be the
Gnamoi. The river he was upon was broad and navigable. It flowed
through a level country with a dead current and muddy water, and
spread into frequent lakes. He found that it ultimately
discharged itself into the sea, but was uncertain at what
distance from its sources. He was positive he never travelled to
the <i>southward of west</i>. He ascended a hill near the sea,
and observed an island in the distance, from which, the natives
informed him, a race of light-coloured men came in large canoes
for a scented wood; but having failed in the immediate object of
his journey, he was eventually obliged to return. <!--page 162 MAJOR MITCHELL'S REPORT. /page--> </p>

<p>The following official report of Major Mitchell will
sufficiently point out the incorrectness of the preceding
statement. It is most probable that Barber merely told that which
he had heard from the natives, and that having a more than
ordinary share of cunning, he made up a story upon their vague
and uncertain accounts, in hopes that it would benefit him, as in
truth it did.</p>

<p>SIR, </p>

<p>I have the honour to state, for the information of His
Excellency the Governor, the progress I have made in exploring
the course of the interior waters to the northward of the Colony,
with reference to the letter which I had the honour to address to
Col. Lindesay, on this subject, on the 19th ult. </p>

<p>On crossing Liverpool Range my object was to proceed
northward, so as to avoid the plains and head the streams which
water them, and avoiding also the mountain ranges on the east. </p>

<p>I arrived accordingly, by a tolerably straight and level line,
at Walamoul, on Peel's River; this place (a cattle station of Mr.
Brown) being nearly due north from the common pass across
Liverpool Range, and about a mile-<!--page 163 PEEL'S RIVER. /page-->and-a-half above the spot where
Mr. Oxley crossed this river. </p>

<p>I found the general course of the Peel below Walamoul to be
nearly west; and after tracing this river downwards twenty-two
miles (in direct distance), I crossed it at an excellent ford,
named Wallamburra. I then traversed the extensive plain of
Mulluba; and leaving that of Coonil on the right, extending far
to the north-east, we passed through a favourable interval of
what I considered Hardwicke's Range, the general direction of
this range being two points west of north. </p>

<p>On passing through this gorge, which, from the name of a hill
on the south side, may be named Ydire, I crossed a very extensive
tract of flat country, on which the wood consisted of iron-bark
and acacia pendula; this tract being part of a valley evidently
declining to the north-west, which is bounded on the south by the
Liverpool Range, and on the south-west by the extremities from
the same. On the west, at a distance of twenty-two miles from
Hardwicke's Range, there stands a remarkable isolated hill named
Bounalla; and towards the lowest part of the country, and in the
direction in which all the waters tend, there is a rocky peak
named Tangulda. On the north, a low range (named Wowa), branching
westerly from Hardwicke's Range, bounds on that side this
extensive basin, which includes Liverpool Plains. Peel's River is
the principal stream, and receives, in its course, all the waters
of these <!--page 164 MAJOR MITCHELL'S REPORT. /page-->plains below the junction of Connadilly,&mdash;which
I take to be York's River, of Oxley. </p>

<p>The stream is well known to the natives by the name Nammoy;
and six miles below Tangulda, the low extremities from the
surrounding ranges close on the river, and separate this
extensive vale from the unexplored country which extends beyond
to an horizon which is unbroken between W.N.W. and N.N.W. </p>

<p>The impracticable appearance of the mountains to the
northward, induced me to proceed thus far to the west; and on
examining the country thirty miles N.E. by N. from Tangulda, I
ascended a lofty range extending westward from the coast chain,
and on which the perpendicular sides of masses of trachyte (a
volcanic rock) were opposed to my further progress even with
horses: it was therefore evident that the river supposed to rise
about the latitude of 28° would not be accessible, or at least
available to the Colony, in that direction, and that in the event
of the discovery of a river beyond that range flowing to the
northern or north-western shores, it would become of importance
to ascertain whether it was joined by the Nammoy, the head of
this river being so accessible that I have brought my heavily
laden drays to where it is navigable for boats, my present
encampment being on its banks six miles below Tangulda. From this
station I can perceive the western termination of the Trachytic
range, and I am now about to explore the country between it and
the Nammoy, and the further course of this river; and in the
event of its continuance in a favourable <!--page 165 THE RIVER NAMMOY. /page-->direction, I shall fix
my depot on its right bank, whence I now write, and descend the
stream in the portable boats. </p>

<p class="right">I have the honour to be, Sir, <br>
Your most obedient servant, <br>

<p><i>The Hon. The Colonial Secretary.</i></p>

<hr width="30%">

<p class="right"><i>Peel's River</i>, 29<i>th February</i>, 1832.
</p>

<p>SIR, </p>

<p>I have the honour to inform you, for the information of His
Excellency the Governor, that I have reached the left bank of
this River with my whole party on my return from the northern
interior, having explored the course of the river referred to in
my letter of 22nd December last, and others within the 29th
parallel of latitude. </p>

<p>There was so much fallen timber in the Nammoy, and its waters
were so low, that the portable boats could not be used on that
river with advantage, and I proceeded by land in a north-west
direction, until convinced by its course turning more to the
westward that this river joined the river Darling. I therefore
quitted its banks with the intention of exploring the country
further northward, by moving round the western extremities of the
mountains mentioned in my former letter, and which I have since
distinguished <!--page 166 MAJOR MITCHELL'S REPORT. /page-->in my map by the name of the Lindesay Range. These
mountains terminate abruptly on the west, and I entered a fine
open country at their base, from whence plains (or rather open
ground of gentle undulation) extended westward as far as could be
seen. On turning these mountains I directed my course northward,
and to the eastward of north, into the country beyond them, in
search of the river <i>Kindur</i>; and I reached a river flowing
westward, the bed of which was deep, broad, and permanent, but in
which there was not then much water. </p>

<p>The marks of inundation on trees, and on the adjoining high
ground, proved that its floods rose to an extraordinary height;
and from the latitude, and also from the general direction of its
course, I considered this to be the river which Mr. Cunningham
named the Gwydir, on crossing it sixty miles higher, on his route
to Moreton Bay. I descended this river, and explored the country
on its left bank for about eighty miles to the westward, when I
found that its general course was somewhat to the southward of
west. This river received no addition from the mountains over
that part of its left bank traversed by me; and the heat being
intense, the stream was at length so reduced that I could step
across it. The banks had become low, and the bed much contracted,
being no longer gravelly, but muddy. I therefore crossed this
river and travelled northward, on a meridian line, until, in the
latitude of 29° 2´, I came upon the largest river I had yet
seen. The banks were earthy and broken, the soil being loose, and
the water of a white <!--page 167 THE RIVER KARAULA. /page-->muddy colour. Trees, washed out by the roots
from the soft soil, filled the bed of this river in many places.
There was abundance of cod-fish of a small size, as well as of
the two other kinds of fish which we had caught in the Peel, the
Nammoy, and the Gwydir. The name of this river, as well as we
could make it out from the natives, was Karaula. Having made fast
one tree to top of another tall tree, I obtained a view of the
horizon, which appeared perfectly level, and I was in hopes that
we had at length found a river which would flow to the northward
and avoid the Darling. I accordingly ordered the boat to be put
together, and sent Mr. White with a party some miles down to
clear away any trees in the way. Mr. White came upon a rocky
fall, and found besides the channel so much obstructed by trees,
and the course so tortuous, that I determined to ascertain before
embarking upon it, whether the general course was in the desired
direction. Leaving Mr. White with half the party, I accordingly
traced the Karaula downwards, and found that its course changed
to south, a few miles below where I had made it, and that it was
joined by the Gwydir only eight miles below where I had crossed
that river. Immediately below the junction of the Gwydir (which
is in latitude 29° 30´ 27´´, longitude 148° 13´ 20´´) the
course of the river continues southward of west, directly towards
where Captain Sturt discovered the River Darling; and I could no
longer doubt that this was the same river. I therefore returned
to the party, determined to explore the country further
northward. <!--page 168 MAJOR MITCHELL'S REPORT. /page--> </p>

<p>The results of my progress thus far were sufficient, I
considered, to prove that the division of the waters falling
towards the northern and southern shores of Australia is not, as
has been supposed, in the direction of the Liverpool and
Warrabangle range, but extends between Cape Byron on the eastern
shore, towards Dick Hartog's Island on the west; the greater
elongation of this country being between these points, and
intermediate between the lines of its northern and southern
coasts. The basin of the streams I have been upon must be bounded
on the north by this dividing ground or water-shed, and although
no rise was perceptible in the northern horizon, the river was
traversed by several rocky dykes, over which it fell southward;
their direction being oblique to the course, and nearly parallel
to this division of the waters. I beg leave to state, that I
should not feel certain on this point without having seen more,
were it not evident from Mr. Cunningham's observations, made on
crossing this division on his way to Moreton Bay. Mr. Cunningham,
on crossing the head of this river, nearly in the same latitude,
but much nearer its sources, found the height of its bed above
the sea to be 840 feet; at about forty-five miles further
northward the ground rose to upwards of 1700 feet, but
immediately beyond, he reached a river flowing north-west, the
height of which was only 1400 feet above the sea. He had thus
crossed this dividing higher ground, between the parallels of
29° and 28°. It appears, therefore, that all the interior
rivers we know of to the northward of the Morum<!--page 169 THE RIVER KARAULA. /page-->bidgee, belong to
the basin of the Karaula; this stream flowing southward, and
hence the disappearance of the Macquarie and other lower rivers
may be understood, for all along the banks of the Karaula, the
Gwydir, and the Nammoy, the country, though not swampy, bears
marks of frequent inundation; thus the floods occasioned by these
rivers united, cover the low country, and receive the Macquarie
so that no channel marks its further course. </p>

<p>That a basin may be found to the northward receiving the
waters of the northern part of the coast range in a similar
manner is extremely probable, and that they form a better river,
because the angle is more acute between the high ground, which
must bound it on the N.E. and the watershed on the south. I
therefore prepared to cross the Karaula, in hopes of seeing the
head at least of such a river, and to explore the country two
degrees further northward, but moving in a N.W. direction. My
tent was struck, and I had just launched my portable boat for the
purpose of crossing the river, when Mr. Surveyor Finch, whom I
had instructed to bring up a supply of flour, arrived with the
distressing intelligence, that two of his men had been killed by
the natives, who had taken the flour, and were in possession of
everything he had brought&mdash;all the cattle, including his
horse, being also dispersed or lost. I therefore determined not
to extend my excursion further, as the party were already on
reduced rations, and on the 8th instant I retired from the
Karaula, returning by the marked line, which being cut through
thick scrubs in <!--page 170 MAJOR MITCHELL'S REPORT. /page-->various places, is now open, forming a tolerably
direct line of communication in a N.W. direction from Sydney, to
a river, beyond which the survey may be extended whenever His
Excellency the Governor thinks fit. </p>

<p>The natives had never troubled my party on our advance; indeed
I only saw them when I came upon them by surprise, and then they
always ran off. Their first visit was received at my camp on the
Karaula, during my absence down that river, when they were very
friendly, but much disposed to steal. Various tribes followed us
on coming back, but never with any show of hostility, although
moving in tribes of a hundred or more parallel to our marked
line, or in our rear; it was necessary to be ever on our guard,
and to encamp in strong positions only, arranging the drays for
defence during the night: three men were always under arms, and I
have much pleasure in stating, that throughout the whole
excursion, and under circumstances of hardship and privation, the
conduct of the men was very good. I took an armed party to the
scene of pillage, and buried the bodies of the two men, who
appeared to have been treacherously murdered while asleep by the
blacks during the absence of Mr. Finch: no natives were to be
found when I visited the spot, although it appeared from columns
of smoke on hills which overlooked if, that they were watching
our movements. </p>

<p>The party has now arrived within a day's journey of Brown's
station, and I have instructed Assistant-Surveyor White (from
whom I have received great assistance during <!--page 171 MAJOR MITCHELL'S REPORT. /page-->the whole journey)
to conduct it homewards, being desirous to proceed without delay
to Sydney, and to receive the instructions of His Excellency the
Governor. </p>

Your most obedient Servant, <br>
T. L. MITCHELL, <br>

<p>Having now had considerable experience in the fitting out and
management of expeditions in New South Wales, I cannot refrain
from making some few observations on the subject. And without
presuming to lay dawn any fixed rules, I shall only refer to
those by which I have best succeeded, in hopes that some of my
remarks may prove of use to future travellers who may venture to
penetrate into the trackless deserts over so small a portion of
which I wandered. </p>

<p>The great difficulty of examining the interior of Australia,
is that of carrying supplies; for increasing the number of
individuals composing an expedition is of no avail, since an
additional number of men must necessarily in<!--page 173 DIFFICULTIES OF EXPLORING AUSTRALIA. /page-->crease the
consumption of food. In order to meet this difficulty it has been
proposed to establish depots upon which an expedition could fall
back to recruit its supplies, and in ordinary cases this plan
might answer; but I am decidedly of opinion that no party could
long remain stationary in the distant interior without some fatal
collision with the natives, which would be attended with the most
deplorable consequences; and I do think, considering all things,
that the experiment is too dangerous to be tried; for when I
reached Mount Harris, on my first retreat from the Darling, I
found the party who were awaiting me, with a supply of
provisions, under very great alarm, in consequence of the hostile
proceedings of the Mount Harris tribe. The men had been obliged
to put the camp into a state of defence. The blacks had attempted
to surprise them, and would, had I not returned, have combined in
some general attack. It appears to me that the most judicious
plan would be to send a supply of provisions, with an expedition,
to a distant point, under the charge of a minor party. These
provisions could replace those already expended, and the animals
that carried them could be taken back. </p>

<p>The number of individuals of which the expedition down the
banks of the Macquarie was composed, was fourteen: that is to
say, myself, Mr. Hume, two soldiers, one free man, and seven
prisoners of the crown. The latter behaved, on all occasions, as
steadily as it was possible for men to do. Yet the circumstance
of the two soldiers being with me increased my confidence in the
whole, for I <!--page 174 SELECTION OF SUBORDINATES. /page-->was aware that their example would influence the
rest. However well disposed the prisoners of the crown may be,
(as in this instance they certainly were,) the beneficial example
of steady discipline cannot be denied. I should not have
considered myself justified in leaving the camp as I did for a
week, and in detaching Mr. Hume at the same time when at the
bottom of the marshes, or in making the last effort to maintain
our position on the banks of the Darling, if I had not reposed
every confidence in the man to whom I entrusted the safety of the
camp during my absence. </p>

<p>Experience, therefore, of the value of the two soldiers, whom
General Darling was good enough to permit me to take on the
strength of the party, fully bears me out in recommending that
one man, at least, of general responsibility shall be attached to
all future expeditions. The success of an expedition depends so
much on the conduct of the persons of whom it is composed, that
too much attention cannot be given to the selection even of the
most subordinate. Men of active intelligent minds, of persevering
habits, and of even temper, should be preferred to mechanics who
do not possess these most requisite qualities. On the other hand,
it is impossible to do without a good carpenter, however
defective he may be in other respects. I was indebted to Mr.
Maxwell, the superintendent of Wellington Valley, for some
excellent men, both on my first and on my second journey, because
he understood the nature of the service for which they were
required, and the <!--page 175 DANGER OF COLLISION WITH THE NATIVES. /page-->characters of those whom he recommended. But
however well selected the party, or the men rather, might be, I
still consider a man of general responsibility necessary for its
complete organisation. I would have him somewhat superior to the
rest in his station in life. Him I would hold answerable for the
immediate discipline of the camp, whilst I was present, and for
its safety when absent. The assistant to the leader I would put
entirely out of the question. He has other and most important
duties to perform. I would rate this man wholly independent of
him. </p>

<p>In reference to what I have already said with regard to the
natives, it was supposed that they were so little to be
apprehended, that when I went on the first occasion into the
interior, I applied for a limited number of men only, under an
impression that with a few men I could carry provisions equal to
a consumption of a greater number, and by this means be enabled
to keep the field for a greater length of time. But I do not
think it would be safe to penetrate into the distant country with
fewer than fifteen men, for although, happily, no rupture has as
yet taken place with the natives, yet, there is no security
against their treachery, and it is very certain that a slight
cause might involve an expedition in inextricable difficulty, and
oblige the leader to throw himself on the defensive, when far
away from other resources than those with which he should have
provided himself, and that, perhaps, when navigating a close and
intricate river, with all the dangers and perplexities attendant
on such a situation. It is absolutely necessary to <!--page 176 PACK-OXEN, HORSES, WHEEL-CARRIAGES. /page-->establish
nightly guards, not only for the security of the camp, but of the
cattle, and at the same time to have a force strong enough to
maintain an obstinate resistance against any number of savages,
where no mercy is to be expected. It will be borne in mind, that
there is a wide difference between penetrating into a country in
the midst of its population, and landing from ships for the
purpose of communication or traffic. Yet, how few voyages of
discovery have terminated without bloodshed! Boats while landing
are covered by their ships, and have succour within view; but not
so parties that go into unknown tracts. They must depend on their
immediate resources and individual courage alone. </p>

<p>With regard to the animals, I should recommend an equal number
of horses as of bullocks; since it has been found that the
latter, though slow, travel better over swampy ground than
horses, which, on the other hand, are preferable for expeditious
journeys, to which bullocks would never be equal. One of the
colonial pack-saddles weighs fifty pounds complete, and is
preferable to those sent out from England. This, with a load of
250 lbs. is sufficient for any animal, since it enables the men
to place a part of their provisions with the general loads. The
difficulty of keeping the backs of the animals free from injury,
more especially where any blemish has before existed, is
exceedingly great. They should undergo an examination twice
a-day, that is, in the morning prior to moving off, and in the
afternoon before they are turned out to feed; and measures <!--page 177 ISSUE OF PROVISIONS. /page-->should
then be taken to ease them as circumstances require. I never
suffered the saddles to be removed from the backs of the animals
under my charge for twenty minutes after the termination of the
journey for the day, in order to guard against the effects of the
sun; and where the least swelling appeared the saddle was altered
and the place dressed. Yet, notwithstanding all this care and
attention, several both of the horses and bullocks were at one
time in a sad condition, during the first journey,&mdash;so
much so as almost to paralyse our efforts. It would be advisable
that such animals as are entirely free from blemish should be
chosen for the service of expeditions, for, with proper
management they might be kept in order. The anxiety of mind
attendant on a bad state of the animals is really quite
embarrassing, for it not only causes a delay in the movements,
but a derangement in the loads. Other animals are overburdened,
and there is no knowing where the evil will stop. </p>

<p>In addition to the pack-animals, I would recommend the
employment of a dray or cart under any practicable circumstances.
It serves to carry necessary comforts, gives an expedition
greater facility for securing its collections, and is of
inconceivable advantage in many other respects. </p>

<p>Constant and most earnest attention should be paid to the
issue of provisions, on the discreet management of which so much
depends, and the charge of them should be committed to the second
in command. The most important articles are flour, tea, sugar,
and tobacco. All should be husbanded with extreme care, and
weighed from time to <!--page 178 LIVE STOCK. /page-->time. The flour is best carried in canvass
bags, containing 100 pounds each, and should at the termination
of each day's journey, be regularly piled up and covered with a
tarpaulin. Tea, sugar and tobacco lose considerably in weight, so
that it is necessary to estimate for somewhat more than the bare
supply. With regard to the salt meat, the best mode of conveying
it appears to be in small barrels of equal weight with the bags
of flour. Salt pork is better than beef. It should be deprived of
all bones and be of the very best quality. I have heard spirits
recommended, but I do not approve their use. Tea is much more
relished by the men; indeed they could not do well without it. A
small quantity of spirits would, however, of course be necessary
in the event of its being required. </p>

<p>Mr. Cornelius O'Brien, an enterprising and long-established
settler, who has pushed his flocks and herds to the banks of the
Morumbidgee, was good enough to present me with eight wethers as
I passed his station. It may be some gratification to Mr. O'Brien
to know, that they contributed very materially to our comforts,
and he will, perhaps, accept my acknowledgements in this place,
not only for so liberal a present to myself, but for his
attention and kindness to my men as long as they remained in his
neighbourhood. It was found that the sheep gave but little
additional trouble, requiring only to be penned at night, as much
to secure them from the native dogs as to prevent them from
straying away. They followed the other animals very quietly, and
soon became accustomed to daily move<!--page 179 INTERCOURSE WITH THE NATIVES. /page-->ments. They proved a most
available stock; no waste attended their slaughter, and they
admitted of a necessary and wholesome change of fresh food from
the general salt diet, on which the men would otherwise have had
to subsist. </p>

<p>The provisions should, if possible, be issued weekly, and
their diminution should be so regulated as to give an equal
relief to the animals. </p>

<p>For general information I have annexed a list of the supplies
I took with me on my first expedition. It may appear long, but
the articles were packed in a small compass, and their value
immaterial. </p>

<p>As a precautionary measure I should advise, that one of the
pack animals be kept apart for the purpose of carrying water. Two
casks of equal weight are the best for such a purpose. In long
and hot marches, the men experience great relief from having
water at hand. </p>

<p>In reference to the natives, I hope sufficient has been said
of the manner of communicating with them to prevent the necessity
of a repetition here. The great point is not to alarm their
natural timidity: to exercise patience in your intercourse with
them; to treat them kindly; and to watch them with suspicion,
especially at night. Never permit the men to steal away from the
camp, but keep them as compact as possible; and at every station
so arrange your drays and provisions that they may serve as a
defence in case of your being attacked. </p>

<p>The natives appeared to me to be indifferent to our pre<!--page 180 WHALE BOAT EMPLOYED /page-->sents,
in most cases. Tomahawks, knives, pieces of iron, and different
coloured ribbons for the forehead, were most esteemed by them.
They will barter and exchange their fish for articles, and
readily acquire confidence. </p>

<p>I believe I have now touched on all the more important points:
on minor ones no observation I can make will be of use; men must,
in many things, be guided by circumstances.</p>

<hr width="30%">

<p>I may here notice that, in my second expedition, as it was
anticipated that I should require adequate provision for water
conveyance, at one stage or other of my journey down the
Morumbidgee, I was furnished with a whale-boat, the dimensions of
which are given below. She was built by Mr. Egan, the master
builder of the dock-yard and a native of the colony, and did
great credit to his judgment. She carried two tons and a half of
provisions, independently of a locker, which I appropriated for
the security of the arms, occupying the space between the
after-seat and the stern. She was in the first instance put
together loosely, her planks and timbers marked, and her ring
bolts, &amp;c. fitted. She was then taken to pieces, carefully
packed up, and thus conveyed in plank into the interior, to a
distance of four hundred and forty miles, without injury. She was
admirably adapted for the service, and rose as well as could have
been expected over the seas in the lake. It was evident, however,
that she would have been much safer if she had <!--page 181 ON THE SECOND EXPEDITION. /page-->had another plank,
for she was undoubtedly too low. The following were her
dimensions:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Breadth across 7th timber aft, 5 ft. 1/2 an inch outside. <br>
    Across 12th timber, 5 ft. 11 1/4 in. <br>
    Across 17th timber forward, 5 ft. <br>
    25 ft. 8 in. in length inside. <br>
    Curve of the keel No. 1, from the after side of each apron, 3
    ft. 3 3/4 in. <br>
    No. 2, from head to head of the dead wood, 13 1/2 in. <br>
    No. 3, from one end of keel to the other inner side, 3 in. <br>
    No. 4, round of keel from the toe of each dead wood, 7/8
    1/16th. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The timbers were marked, beginning from the stern to the bow
on the starboard side, and from bow to stern on the larboard.</p>

    <p>By His Excellency Lieutenant General Ralph Darling,
    Commanding His Majesty's Forces, Captain-General and
    Governor-in-Chief of the Territory of New South Wales, and
    its dependencies, and Vice Admiral of the same, &amp;c.
    &amp;c. &amp;c. </p>

<p class="centre"><i>To Charles Sturt, Esq. Captain in the 39th
Regiment of Foot.</i> </p>

<p>Whereas it has been judged expedient to fit out an expedition
for the purpose of exploring the interior of New Holland, and the
present dry season affords a reasonable prospect of an
opportunity of ascertaining the nature and extent of the large
marsh or marshes which stopped the progress of the late John
Oxley Esq, Surveyor General, in following the courses of the
rivers Lachlan and Macquarie in the years 1817 and 1818. And
whereas I repose full confidence in your abilities and zeal for
conducting such an expedition, I do hereby constitute and appoint
you to command and take charge of the expedition now preparing
for the purpose of exploring the interior of the country, and for
ascertaining, if <!--page 184 APPENDIX&mdash;No. I. /page-->practicable, the nature and extent of the marsh
or marshes above mentioned. </p>

<p>In the prosecution of this service, you will be guided
generally by the following instructions. </p>

<ol>
    <li>You will be accompanied on this expedition by Mr.
        Hamilton Hume, whose great experience in travelling
        through the remote parts of the Colony, cannot fail to be
        highly useful to you. You will also be attended by two
        soldiers and six convicts, of whom one is to understand
        the shoeing of horses, one to be a carpenter, one a
        harness-maker and three stock-men, and you will be
        provided with six horses and twelve bullocks. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>A small boat has been built here for the use of the
        expedition, and for its conveyance, there is provided a
        light four-wheeled carriage to be drawn by two bullocks. <p>The
        deputy Commissary General has received orders for
        supplying the expedition with provisions of the best
        quality sufficient for six months' consumption, together
        with tents, blankets, clothing, pack-saddles, utensils,
        instruments, tools, and necessaries of all kinds of which
        you are likely to stand in need. Orders are also given
        for providing you with arms and ammunition, with rockets
        for signals, and an ample supply of simple
        medicines&mdash;You are to consider it an important
        duty to attend to the providing of all these supplies,
        and to take care that not only every article is of the
        best quality that can be procured, but also that no
        article be wanting with which you may desire to be
        provided. <br>
        <br>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Orders are given for forwarding without delay all your
        provisions, stores and supplies of every kind to
        Wellington Valley, at which place, you, Mr. Hume, and all
        your men <!--page 185 APPENDIX&mdash;No. I. /page-->are to rendezvous as soon as possible. Mr
        Maxwell, the superintendent, will furnish you with
        well-trained bullocks, and afford you all the assistance
        you may require in arranging every thing for your
        departure from that station. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>After you shall have completed all your arrangements, you
        are to lose no time in finally departing from Wellington
        Valley in prosecution of the immediate objects of the
        expedition. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>You are first to proceed to Mount Harris, where you are
        to form a temporary depot, by means of which you will
        have an opportunity of more readily communicating with
        Mr. Maxwell. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>You are then to endeavour to determine the fate of the
        Macquarie River, by tracing it as far as possible beyond
        the point to which Mr. Oxley went, and by pushing
        westward, you are to ascertain if there be any high lands
        in that direction, or if the country be, as it is
        supposed, an unbroken level and under water. If you
        should fail in these objects, you will traverse the
        plains lying behind our north-west boundaries, with a
        view to skirt any waters by which you may have been
        checked to the westward; and if you should succeed in
        skirting them, you are to explore the country westward
        and southward as far as possible, endeavouring to
        discover the Macquarie beyond the marsh of Mr. Oxley, and
        following it to its mouth if at all practicable. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>There is some reason to believe that the over-flowing of
        the Macquarie when visited by Mr. Oxley, was occasioned
        by heavy rains falling in the mountains to the eastward,
        and that as you are to visit the same spot at a different
        season of the year, you may escape such embarrassment;
        but although you should get beyond the point at which <!--page 186 APPENDIX&mdash;No. I. /page-->Mr.
        Oxley stopped, it would not be prudent to risk your own
        health or that of your men, by continuing long in a
        swampy country. Therefore it may be advisable for you in
        the first instance to leave the greater part of your men,
        bullocks, and baggage, at Mount Harris, and if you should
        see a probability of your being able to cross into the
        interior, you will then return to Mount Harris for such
        additional supplies as you may judge necessary. You can
        there communicate with Mr. Maxwell respecting any
        ulterior arrangements which you may be desirous of
        making. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>The success of the expedition is so desirable an object,
        that I cannot too strongly impress upon you the
        importance of perseverance in endeavouring to skirt any
        waters or marshes which may check your course as long as
        you have provisions sufficient for your return; but you
        must be cautious not to proceed a single day's journey
        further than where you find that your provisions will be
        barely sufficient to enable you to reach the nearest
        place at which you can depend upon getting supplies. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>If after every endeavour you should find it totally
        impracticable to get to the westward, you are still to
        proceed northward, keeping as westerly a direction as
        possible; and when the state of your provisions will
        oblige you to retreat, you will be guided by your
        latitude, as to the place to which you are to make the
        best of your way, but you are not to make for any place
        on the coast, if Wellington valley should still be
        nearer. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>You must be aware that the success of the expedition will
        greatly depend upon the time for which your provisions <!--page 187 APPENDIX&mdash;No. I. /page-->will
        hold out, and therefore you will see the great importance
        of observing every possible economy in the expenditure of
        provisions, and preventing waste of every kind. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>You are to keep a detailed account of your proceedings in
        a journal, in which all observations and occurrences of
        every kind, with all their circumstances, however minute,
        are to be carefully noted down. You are to be particular
        in describing the general face of all the country through
        which you pass, the direction and shape of the mountains,
        whether detached or in ranges, together with the bearings
        and estimated distances of the several mountains, hills,
        or eminences from each other. You are likewise to note
        the nature of the climate, as to heat, cold, moisture,
        winds, rains, &amp;c, and to keep a register of the
        temperature from Fahrenheit's thermometer, as observed at
        two or three periods of each day. The rivers, with their
        several branches, their direction, velocity, breadth, and
        depth, are carefully to be noted. It is further expected
        that you will, as far as may be in your power, attend to
        the animal, vegetable, and mineral productions of the
        country, noting down every thing that may occur to you,
        and preserving specimens as far as your means will admit,
        especially some of all the ripe seeds which you may
        discover; when the preservation of specimens is
        impossible, drawings or detailed accounts of them, are
        very desirable. <br>
        <br>
        </li>
    <li>You will note the description of the several people whom
        you may meet, the extent of the population, their means
        of subsistence, their genius and disposition, the nature
        of their amusements, their diseases and remedies, their
        objects <!--page 188 APPENDIX&mdash;No. I. /page-->of worship, religious ceremonies, and a
        vocabulary of their language.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lastly. On your return from your journey, you are to cause all
the journals or other written documents belonging to, and
curiosities collected by the several individuals composing the
expedition, to be carefully sealed up with your own seal and kept
in that state until you shall have made your report to me in
writing of the result of the expedition. </p>

<h5>LIST OF GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS, COLLECTED IN THE DISTANT
INTERIOR DURING THE FIRST EXPEDITION, WITH THEIR LOCALITIES AND
THEIR RELATIVE DISTANCES FROM EACH OTHER.</h5>

<p>It may be necessary to observe that the height of the Cataract
of the Macquarie River above the sea, was ascertained by
barometrical admeasurement to be 650 feet. The country
subsequently traversed is considerably lower. The specimens refer
only to the geological formation of the distant interior. </p>

<p>Schorl Rock.&mdash;Colour blueish grey, fine grained,
extremely hard. Composed of Tourmaline and Quartz. Forms the bed
of the Macquarie at the Cataract, 75 miles to the N.W. of
Wellington Valley. </p>

<p>Decomposed Mica Slate.&mdash;Colour white; yields to the
knife; adheres strongly to the tongue. </p>

<p>Decomposed Feldspar.&mdash;Colour pale rose-pink; very fine
grained; easily scratched with the knife; adheres strongly to the
tongue. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Both specimens immediately succeed the Schorl rock at the
    Cataract, in large smooth-sided masses. <!--page 198 APPENDIX&mdash;No. IV. /page--> </p>
    <p>This formation may be said to terminate the rocks
    connected with the dividing ranges, since it is the last that
    occurs at their western base. </p>
    <p>A little below the Cataract, the county undergoes a
    remarkable change, and becomes extremely depressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Porphyry with Feldspar.&mdash;Colour dull red, with white
spots, or grey with red spots; very hard, compact, sonorous,
magnetic. (See pp. 27 and 115.) Composition of Mount Harris, a
hill called by Mr. Oxley, elevated about 170 feet above the level
of the plains. It lies 65 miles to the N.N.W. of the Cataract,
and is about 16 miles distant from the first of the marshes of
the Macquarie. </p>

<p>Porphyry with Feldspar.&mdash;Colour grey with red spots,
similar to the last. Was not observed to affect the needle.
Formation of Mount Foster. Mount Foster is more than 200 feet in
height, and lies about 5 miles to the N.N.W. of Mount Harris.
From the summit of both, Arbuthnot's range is visible, bearing
nearly due east, distant 70 miles. (See page 28.) </p>

<p>Quartz Rock varieties&mdash;Slaty Quartz
varieties.&mdash;Composition of the first elevations to the
Westward of the marshes of the Macquarie, called New Year's
Range, a group of five hills. The loftiest about 200 feet in
elevation; distant about 80 miles to the N.W. of Mount Harris. </p>

<p>Granite.&mdash;Colour red, coarse-grained. Composed of
Quartz, Feldspar, and Mica.</p>
<!--face 199 /face--><a name="i1.6"></a>

<h5>Illustration 6</h5>

<p align="center"><img src="e00059-images/xpssti06.jpg" alt=""> </p>

<h5>A SELENITE. <br>
CHRYSTALLIZED SULPHATE OF LIME.</h5>

<p>Granite, Porphyritic.&mdash;Colour light red. Both
occurring in the bed of New Year's Creek, traversing it
obliquely, and are visible for a <!--page 199 APPENDIX&mdash;No. IV. /page-->few hundred yards only. This
granite occurs about 16 miles from the Range in a N. by E.
direction. </p>

<p>Old Red Sandstone.&mdash;Composition of Oxley's Table Land,
500 feet above the level of the plains. It is broken into two
hills, that appear to have been separated by some convulsion.
(See page 81.) It bears N.W. by W. from New Year's Range, distant
50 miles. </p>

<p>Old Red Sandstone.&mdash;Composition of D'Urban's group.
The highest elevation ascended during the expedition, being
nearly 600 feet above the level of the plain in which it rises.
It lies to the S.S.W. of Oxley's Table Land, distant 40 miles,
and the rock of which it is composed is much harder and closer. </p>

<p>Breccia.&mdash;Colour pale yellow, silicious cement.
Composition of some trifling elevations to the North of
New-Year's range, with which it is doubtful whether they are
connected. </p>

<p>Chrystallized Sulphate of Lime.&mdash;Found imbedded in the
alluvial soil forming the banks of the Darling river. Occurring
in a regular vein. Soft, yielding to the nail; not acted on by
acids.&mdash;See Plate. </p>

<p>Breccia.&mdash;Pale ochre colour, silicious cement,
extremely hard. Cellular, and sharp edges to the fractured
pebbles. Has apparently undergone fusion. Occurs in the bed of
the Darling in one place only. </p>

<p>Sandstone Varieties.&mdash;Colour dull red and muddy white;
appears like burnt bricks; light, easily frangible; adheres to
the tongue; occurs in large masses in the bed of the Darling; <!--page 200 APPENDIX&mdash;No. IV. /page-->probably
in connection with the rock-salt of the neighbourhood, which,
from the number of brine springs discovered feeding the river,
must necessarily exist. </p>

<p>Variety of the same description of rock. </p>

<p>Jasper and Quartz.&mdash;Showing itself above the surface
of a plain, from which D'Urban's group bore S. 40 E. distant 33
miles. </p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that not a pebble or a stone was
picked up during the progress of the expedition, on any one of
the plains; and that after it again left Mount Harris for the
Castlereagh, the only rock-formation discovered was a small
Freestone tract near the Darling river. There was not a pebble of
any kind either in the bed of the Castlereagh, or in the creeks
falling into it.</p>

<h5>OFFICIAL REPORTS TO THE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT.</h5>

<hr width="15%">

<h5 class="small">GOVERNMENT ORDER</h5>

<p class="right"><i>Colonial Secretary's Office</i>, 23<i>rd
January</i>, 1829. </p>

<p>His Excellency the Governor has been pleased to order, that
the following communication, dated the 25th of December last,
from Captain Sturt, of the 39th Regiment, who is employed in an
exploring expedition into the interior of the country, be
published for general information. </p>

<p class="right">By his Excellency's Command, <br>
ALEXANDER M'LEAY.</p>

<hr width="15%">

<p class="right"><i>Western Marshes</i>, 25<i>th December</i>,
1828. </p>

<p>SIR,&mdash;I do myself the honor to forward, for the
Governor's perusal, a copy of my journal up to the date of my <!--page 202 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->arrival
at Mount Harris. I should not have directed the messenger to
return so soon, had I not subsequently advanced to Mount Foster,
and surveyed the country from that eminence. I could distinctly
see Arbuthnot's Range to the eastward. From that point the
horizon appeared to me unbroken, but the country to the northward
and westward seemed to favour an attempt to penetrate into it. I
did not observe any sheet of water, and the course of the
Macquarie was lost in the woodlands below. </p>

<p>Mr. Hume ascended the hill at sun-rise, and thought he could
see mountains to the north east, but at such a distance as to
make it quite a matter of uncertainty. Agreeing, however, in the
prudence of an immediate descent, we left our encampment on the
morning of the 23rd, under Mount Foster, to which we had removed
from Mount Harris, and pursued a north-north-west course to the
spot on which we rest at present. We passed some fine meadow land
near the river, and were obliged to keep wide of it in
consequence of fissures in the ground. Traversing a large and
blasted plain, on which the sun's rays fell with intense heat,
and on which there was but little vegetation, we skirted the
first great morass, and made the river immediately beyond it. It
is of very considerable extent, the channel of the river passing
through it. We are encompassed on every side by high reeds, which
exist in the woods as well as in the plains. Mr. Hume and myself
rode forward yesterday through the second morass, and made the
river on slightly elevated ground, at a distance of about five
miles; the country beyond appeared to favour our object, and we,
to-morrow, proceed with the party to the north-west. The river
seems to bend to the north-east; but in <!--page 203 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->this level country it is
impossible to speak with certainty, or to give any decided
opinion of the nature of it, beyond the flats on which we are
travelling. The reeds to the north-east and northward extend over
a circumference of fifty miles; but if Mr. Hume really saw
mountains or rising ground in the former point, the apparent
course of the Macquarie is at once accounted for. The country,
however, seems to dip to the north, though generally speaking it
is level, and I am inclined to think that the state of the
atmosphere caused a deception in this appearance. </p>

<p>I regret to add, that the effects of the sun on the plain over
which we passed on the 23rd produced a return of inflammation in
the eyes of the men, I have named in my journals, and caused the
same in the eyes of several others of my party. I halted,
therefore, to expedite their recovery. They are doing well now,
and we can proceed in the cool of the morning without any fear of
their receiving injury by it. One of the men, who were to return
to Wellington Valley, was attacked slightly with dysentery, but
the medicines I gave him carried it off in the course of a day or
two. I have taken every precaution with regard to the health of
the men, in preparing them for the country into which they are
going; and I have to request that you will inform the governor
that the conduct of the whole party merits my approbation, and
that I have no fault to find. The men from Sydney are not so
sharp as those from Wellington Valley, but are equally well
disposed. The animals, both horses and bullocks, are in good
order, and I find the two soldiers of infinite service to me. The
boat has received some damage from exposure to intense heat, but
is <!--page 204 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->otherwise uninjured. We still retain the carriage and have
every prospect of dragging it on with us. </p>

<p>His Excellency, having been good enough to order a fresh
supply of provisions to Wellington Valley, I have to beg they may
be forwarded to Mount Harris, and that the person in charge
thereof be instructed to remain at that station for one month. We
shall, during the interval, have examined the country to the
north-west; and, in case we are forced back, shall require a
supply to enable us to proceed to the northward, in furtherance
of the views I have already had the honor to submit for the
Governor's approval. </p>

<p class="right">I have the honor to be, Sir, <br>
Your most obedient and humble Servant, <br>
CHARLES STURT, <br>
Captain, 39th Regt. </p>

<p><i>The Honorable The Colonial Secretary</i></p>

<hr width="15%">

<h5 class="small">GOVERNMENT ORDER</h5>

<p class="right"><i>Colonial Secretary's Office</i>, 6<i>th April</i>,
1829. </p>

<p>His Excellency the Governor is pleased to direct that the
following interesting Report which has been received from Captain
Sturt, 39th Regiment, who has been employed for some months past,
(as will be seen on reference to the Government Order, No. 4,
published with Captain Sturt's First Report in the Sydney
Gazette, of the 24th <!--page 205 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->of January last) in exploring the interior,
be communicated for the information of the public. </p>

<p>It appears that the river Macquarie ceases to exist near the
spot where the expedition under the late Mr. Oxley terminated,
which, from the state of country at the time, being then flooded,
could not be ascertained; and that another river of no
inconsiderable magnitude, fed by salt springs, was discovered by
Captain Sturt on the 2nd February last, about 100 miles to the
westward of the Macquarie, running to the southward and westward.
</p>

<p class="right">By His Excellency's Command, <br>
ALEXANDER M'LEAY.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Mount Harris</i>, 4<i>th March</i>, 1829. </p>

<p>SIR,&mdash;I do myself the honor to acquaint you, for the
information of His Excellency the Governor, that I returned to
this eminence on Monday, the 23rd ult. having been driven from
the interior, in consequence of the extreme drought which
prevails there. </p>

<p>I am to state, in reference to my former communication, that
agreeably to what I then reported, I moved, on the 26th December
last, lower down the plains of the Macquarie, but encountered a
barrier of reeds, formed by the marshes of that river, through
which we in vain endeavoured to force our way. I was in
consequence obliged to make the nearest part of the river to my
left, and to take such measures as the nature of my situation
required. Here, for the first time, I set the boat afloat,
deeming it <!--page 206 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->essential to trace the river, as I could not move upon
its banks, and wishing also to ascertain where it again issued
from the marshes, I requested Mr. Hume to proceed northerly, with
a view to skirt them, and to descend westerly, wherever he saw an
open space. He was fortunate enough to strike upon the channel
about twelve miles north of our position, but was obstructed in
his further progress by another marsh, in consequence of which he
returned to the camp the next day; in the mean time, I had taken
the boat, and proceeded down the Macquarie, my way being at first
considerably obstructed by fallen timber: clearing this obstacle,
however, I got into a deeper channel, with fine broad reaches,
and a depth of from twelve to fifteen feet water. I had a short
time previously cleared all woods and trees, and was now in the
midst of reeds of great height. After proceeding onwards for
about eight miles from the place whence I started, my course was
suddenly and unexpectedly checked; I saw reeds before me, and
expected I was about to turn an angle of the river, but I found
that I had got to the end of the channel, and that the river
itself had ceased to exist. Confounded at such a termination to a
stream, whose appearance justified the expectation that it would
have led me through the heart of the marsh to join Mr. Hume, I
commenced a most minute examination of the place, and discovered
two creeks, if they deserve the name, branching, the one to the
north-west, and the other to the north-east; after tracing the
former a short distance, I reached its termination, and in order
to assure myself that such was the case, I walked round the head
of it by pushing through the reeds; it being then too dark to
continue where I was, I returned to <!--page 207 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->a place on the river, at
which I had rested during a shower, and slept there. In the
morning I again went to the spot to examine the north-eastern
branch, when I was equally disappointed. I then examined the
space between the two creeks, opposite to the main channel of the
river, and where the bank receives the force of the current. Here
I saw water in the reeds, but it was scarcely ankle deep, and was
running off to the north-west quicker than the waters of the
river, which had almost an imperceptible motion, I was therefore
at once convinced that it was not permanent, but had lodged there
in the night, during which much rain had fallen. I next pushed my
way through the reeds into the marsh, and at length clearly
perceived that the waters which were perfectly sweet, after
running several courses, flowed off to the north, towards which
point there was an apparent declination or dip. Finding it
impossible to proceed further, I regained the boat, and thence
returned to the camp, under a conviction that I had reached the
very spot, at which Mr. Oxley lost the channel of the river in
1818. </p>

<p>The next day I moved to the place where Mr. Hume had struck
upon the channel of the river, but was again doubtful in what
direction to proceed. </p>

<p>The marsh, at the commencement of which we now found
ourselves, being the third from Mount Foster, but the second
great one, seemed to extend beyond us to the north for many
miles, but varying in breadth. In the evening I went in the boat
up the channel, and found it at first, deep and sullen, as that
of the river above. It soon however, narrowed, and the weeds
formed over its surface, so that I abandoned the boat and walked
along a path up it. I had not gone far when the channel divided;
two <!--page 208 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->smaller channels came, the one from the southern, and the
other from the western parts of the marsh into it. There was an
evident declination where they were, and it was at their junction
the river again rallied and formed. On my return to the camp, Mr.
Hume and I went down the river, but found that about a mile it
lost itself, and spread its waters ever the extensive marsh
before it. </p>

<p>In this extremity, I knew not what movement to make, as Mr.
Hume had been checked in his progress north. I therefore
determined to ascertain the nature of the country to the eastward
and to the westward, that I might move accordingly; I proposed to
Mr. Hume, to take a week's provisions, with two attendants, and
go to the north-east, in order again to turn the marsh, but with
the expectation that the angle formed by the junction of the
Castlereagh with the Macquarie would arrest its progress, as the
last was fast approaching the former. </p>

<p>I myself determined to cross the river, and to skirt the
marshes on the left, and in case they turned off to the north
east, as they appeared to do, it was my intention to pursue a
N.W. course into the interior, to learn the nature of it. With
these views I left the camp on the 31st of December, and did not
return until the 5th of January. Having found early in my
journey, from the change of soil and of timber, that I was
leaving the neighbourhood of the Macquarie, I followed a N.W.
course, from a more northerly one, and struck at once across the
country, under an impression that Mr. Hume would have made the
river again long before my return. I found, after travelling
between twenty and thirty miles, the country began to rise; and
at the end of my journey, I made a hill of considerable <!--page 209 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->elevation,
from the summit of which I had a view of other high lands; one to
the S.W. being a very fine mountain. As I had not found any water
excepting in two creeks, which I had left far behind me, and as I
had got on a soil which appeared incapable of holding it, I made
this the termination of my journey, having exceeded 100 miles in
distance from the camp, on my return to which I found Mr. Hume
still absent. When he joined, he stated to me, that not making
the Castlereagh as soon as he expected, he had bent down westerly
for the Macquarie, and that he ended his journey at some gentle
hills he had made; so that it appeared we must either have
crossed each other's line of route, or that they were very near,
and that want of length must alone have prevented them from
crossing; but as such all assumption led to the conclusion that
the Macquarie no longer existed, I determined to pursue a middle
course round the swamps, to ascertain the point; as in case the
river had ended, a westerly course was the one which my
instructions directed me to pursue. </p>

<p>In the immediate neighbourhood of the marshes we were obliged
to sink wells for water, and it was thus early that we began to
feel the want of a regular supply. </p>

<p>Having made a creek about four miles from our position by
cutting through the reeds where there was a narrow space, we
pursued a westerly course over a plain, having every appearance
of frequent inundation, and for four or five days held nearly the
same direction; in the course of which we crossed both our tracks
on the excursions we had made, which had intersected each other
in a dense oak brush; thus renewing the few doubts, or rather the
doubt <!--page 210 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->we had as to the fate of the Macquarie, whose course we had
been sent to trace. Indeed, had I not felt convinced that that
river had ceased, I should not have moved westward without
further examination, but we had passed through a very narrow part
of the marshes, and round the greater part of them, and had not
seen any hollow that could by any possible exaggeration be
construed into or mistaken for the channel of a river. </p>

<p>It appears, then, that the Macquarie, flowing as it does for
so many miles, through a bed, and not a declining country, and
having little water in it, except in times of flood, loses its
impetus long ere it reaches the formidable barrier that opposes
its progress northwards; the soil in which the reeds grow being a
stiff clay. Its waters consequently spread, until a slight
declivity giving them fresh impulse, they form a channel again,
but soon gaining a level, they lose their force and their motion
together, and spread not only over the second great marsh, but
over a vast extent of the surrounding country, the breadth of
ground thus subject to inundation being more than twenty miles,
and its length considerably greater; around this space there is a
gentle rise which confines the waters, while small hollows in
various directions lead them out of the marshes over the adjacent
plains, on which they eventually subside. On my return from the
interior, I examined those parts round which I had not been, with
particular attention, partly in company with Mr. Hume, and this
statement was confirmed by what we saw. Thus, at a distance of
about twenty-five miles from Mount Foster to the N.N.W. the river
Macquarie ceases to exist, in any shape as a river, and at a
distance of between fifty and sixty, the marshes <!--page 211 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->terminate,
though the country subject to inundation from the river is of a
very considerable extent, as shown by the withered bulrushes, wet
reeds, and shells, that are scattered over its surface. </p>

<p>Having executed the first part of the instructions with which
I had been honoured, I determined on pursuing a west, or
north-west course into the interior, to ascertain the nature of
it, in fulfilment of the second, but in doing this I was obliged
to follow creeks, and even on their banks had to carry a supply
of water, so uncertain was it that we should meet with any at the
termination of our day's journey, and that what we did find would
be fit to drink. Our course led us over plains immediately
bordering the lower lands of the Macquarie, alternating with
swamp oak, acacia pendula, pine, box, eucalyptus, and many other
trees of minor growth, the soil being inclined to a red loam,
while the plains were generally covered with a black scrub,
though in some places they had good grass upon them. We crossed
two creeks before we made the hills Mr. Hume had ascended, and
which he called New Year's Range. Around these hills the country
appeared better&mdash;they are gentle, picturesque elevations,
and are for the most part, covered with verdure, and have, I
fancy, a whinstone base, the rock of which they are composed
being of various substances. I place New Year's Range in lat.
30° 21´, long. 146° 3´ 30´´. Our course next lying
north-west along a creek, led us to within twenty miles of the
hill that had terminated my excursion, and as I hoped that a more
leisurely survey of the country from its summit would open
something favourable to our view, I struck over for it, though
eventually obliged to return. From it Mr. Hume <!--page 212 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->and I rode to the
S.W. mountain, a distance of about forty miles, without crossing
a brook or a creek, our way leading through dense acacia brushes,
and for the most part over a desert. We saw high lands from this
mountain, which exceeds 1,300 feet in elevation, and is of
sandstone formation, and thickly covered with stunted pine, in
eight different points&mdash;the bearings of which are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was in vain, however, that we looked for water. The country
to the north-west, was low and unbroken, and alternated with wood
and plain. </p>

<p>The country from New Year's Range to the hill I had made, and
which I called Oxley's Table Land, had been very fair, with good
soil in many places, but with a total want of water, except in
the creeks, wherein the supply was both bad and uncertain; on our
second day's journey from the former, we came to the creek on
which we were moving, where it had a coarse granite bottom. The
country around it improved very much in appearance, and there was
abundance of good grass on the surface of it, in spite of the
drought. On the right of this creek, a large plain stretches
parallel to it for many miles, varying in quality of soil. Near
Oxley's Table Land, we passed over open forest, the prevailing
timber of which was box. I <!--page 213 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->have placed Oxley's Table Land in
latitude 29° 57´ 30´´, longitude 145° 43´ 30´´. </p>

<p>Finding it impracticable to move westward from the hill I
again descended on the creek, whose general course was to the
north-west, in which direction we at length struck upon a river
whose appearance raised our most sanguine expectations. It flowed
round an angle from the north-east to the north-west, and
extended in longitude five reaches as far as we could see. At
that place it was about sixty yards broad, with banks of from
thirty to forty feet high, and it had numerous wild fowl and many
pelicans on its bosom, and seemed to be full of fish, while the
paths of the natives on both sides, like well-trodden roads,
showed how numerous they were about it. On tasting its waters,
however, we found them perfectly salt, and useless to us, and as
our animals had been without water the night before, this
circumstance distressed us much; our first day's journey led us
past between sixty and seventy huts in one place, and on our
second we fell in with a numerous tribe of natives, having
previously seen some between two creeks before we made New-Year's
Range. At some places the water proved less salt than at others;
our animals drank of it sparingly: we found two small fresh-water
holes, which served us as we passed. After tracing the river for
a considerable distance, we came on brine springs in the bed of
it, the banks having been encrusted with salt from the first; and
as the difficulty of getting fresh water was so great, I here
foresaw an end to our wanderings. And as I was resolved not to
involve my party in greater distress, I halted it, on overtaking
the animals, and the next morning turned back to the nearest
fresh-water, at a distance of <!--page 214 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->eighteen miles from us. Unwilling,
however, to give up our pursuit, Mr. Hume and I started with two
men on horseback, to trace the river as far as we could, and to
ascertain what course it took; in the hopes also that we should
fall on some creek, or get a more certain supply of drinkable
water. We went a distance to which the bullocks could not have
been brought, and then got on a red sandy soil, which at once
destroyed our hopes; and on tasting the river water we found it
salter than ever, our supply being diminished to two pints. Our
animals being weak and purged, and having proceeded at least
forty miles from the camp, I thought it best to yield to
circumstances, and to return, though I trust I shall be believed
when I add, it was with extreme reluctance I did so; and had I
followed the wishes of my party, should still have continued
onwards. Making a part of the river where we had slept, we stayed
to refresh, and in consequence of the heat of the weather were
obliged to drink the water in it, which made us sick. While here,
a tribe of blacks came to us and behaved remarkably well. At
night we slept on a plain without water, and the next day we
regained the camp, which had been visited by the natives during
our absence. </p>

<p>We found the river held a south-west course, and appeared to
be making for the central space between a high land, which I
called Dunlop's Range, at Mr. Hume's request, and a lofty range
to the westward. It still continued its important appearance,
having gained in breadth and in the height of its banks, while
there were hundreds of pelicans and wild-fowl on it. Flowing
through a level country with such a channel, it may be presumed
that this river ultimately assumes either a greater character, or
that it adds <!--page 215 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->considerably to the importance of some other stream.
It had a clay bottom, generally speaking, in many places
semi-indurated and fast forming into sandstone, while there was
chrystallized sulphate of lime running in veins through the soil
which composed the bank. </p>

<p>This river differs from most in the colony, in having a belt
of barren land of from a quarter of a mile to two miles in
breadth in its immediate neighbourhood, and which is subject to
overflow. This belt runs to the inland plains, where a small
elevation checks the further progress of the flood. There is
magnificent blue gum on both sides the river, but the right bank
is evidently the most fertile, and I am mistaken greatly if there
is not a beautiful country north of it. </p>

<p>Of the country over which we have passed, it is impossible for
me to have formed a correct opinion under its present melancholy
circumstances. It has borne the appearance of barrenness, where
in even moderate rain, it might have shown very differently,
though no doubt we passed over much of both good and bad land;
our animals on the whole, have thrived on the food they have had,
which would argue favourably for the herbage. Generally speaking,
I fear the timber is bad&mdash;the rough-gum may be used for
knees, and such purposes, and we may have seen wood for the
wheelwright and cabinet-maker, specimens of which I have
procured, but none for general or household purposes. </p>

<p>The creeks we have traced are different in character from
those in the settled districts, inasmuch as that, like the river,
they have a belt of barren land near then and but little
grass&mdash;they have all of them been numerously frequented
by the natives, as appeared from the number <!--page 216 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->of muscle-shells on
their banks, but now having scarcely any water in them, the fish
having either been taken, or are dead, and the tribes gone
elsewhere for food, while the badness of the river water has
introduced a cutaneous disease among the natives of that
district, which is fast carrying them off. Our intercourse with
these people was incessant from the time we first met them, and
on all occasions they behaved remarkably well, nor could we have
seen less than than two hundred and fifty of them. </p>

<p>Our return is to be attributable to the want of water alone,
and it is impossible for me to describe the effects of the
drought on animal as well as vegetable nature. The natives are
wandering in the desert, and it is melancholy to reflect on the
necessity which obliges them to drink the stinking and loathsome
water they do&mdash;birds sit gasping in the trees and are
quite thin&mdash;the wild dog prowls about in the day-time
unable to avoid us, and is as lean as he can be in a living
state, while minor vegetation is dead, and the very trees are
drooping. I have noticed all these things in my Journal I shall
have the honour of submitting through you, for the Governor's
perusal and information, on my return. Finally, I fear our
expedition will not pave the way to any ultimate benefit;
although it has been the means by which two very doubtful
questions,&mdash;the course of the Macquarie, and the nature
of the interior, have been solved; for it is beyond doubt, that
the interior for 250 miles beyond its former known limits to the
W.N.W., so far from being a shoal sea, has been ascertained not
only to have considerable elevations upon it, but is in itself a
table land to all intents and purposes, and has scarcely water on
its surface to support its inhabitants. <!--page 217 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page--> </p>

<p>I beg you will inform His Excellency the Governor, that I have
on all occasions received the most ready and valuable assistance
from Mr, Hume. His intimate acquaintance with the manners and
customs of the natives, enabled him to enter into intercourse
with them, and chiefly contributed to the peaceable manner in
which we have journeyed, while his previous experience put it in
his power to be of real use to me. I cannot but say he has done
an essential service to future travellers, and to the colony at
large, by his conduct on all occasions since he has been with me;
nor should I be doing him justice, if I did not avail myself of
the first opportunity of laying my sentiments before the
Governor, through you. I am happy to add that every individual of
the party deserves my warmest approbation, and that they have,
one and all, borne their distresses, trifling certainly, but
still unusual, with cheerfulness, and that they have at all times
been attentive to their duty, and obedient to their orders. The
whole are in good health, and are eager again to start. </p>

<p class="right"><i>Mount Harris</i>, 5<i>th March</i>, 1829. </p>

<p>SIR,&mdash;It having appeared to me, that after discovering
such a river as the one I have described in my letter of yes<!--page 218 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->terday,
His Excellency the Governor would approve of my endeavouring to
regain it. There being a probability that it ultimately joins the
Southern Waters, I thought of turning my steps to the southward
and westward; and with a view to learn the nature of the country,
I despatched Mr. Hume in that direction on Saturday last. He
returned in three days, after having gone above forty miles from
the river, and states, that he crossed two creeks, the one about
twenty-five miles, the other about thirty-two distance, evidently
the heads of the creeks we passed westward of the marshes of the
Macquarie. He adds, that, to the second creek the land was
excellent, but that on crossing it, he got onto red soil, on
which he travelled some miles further, until he saw a range of
high land, bearing from him S.W.. by W., when, knowing from the
nature of the country around him, and from the experience of our
late journey, that he could not hope to find a regular supply of
water in advance, and that in the present dry state of the low
lands, a movement such as I had contemplated would be
impracticable, he returned home. I do myself the honour,
therefore, to report to you, for His Excellency's information,
that I shall proceed on Saturday next in a N.E. direction towards
the Castlereagh, intending to trace that river down, and
afterwards to penetrate as far to the northward and westward as
possible; it being my wish to get into the country north of the
more distant river, where I have expectations that there is an
extensive and valuable track of country, but that in failure of
the above, I shall examine the low country behind our N.W.
boundaries, if I can find a sufficiency of water to enable me to
do so. </p>

<p>I am to inform you that in this neighbourhood the <!--page 219 APPENDIX&mdash;No. V. /page-->Macquarie
has ceased to flow, and that it is now a chain of shallow ponds.
The water is fast diminishing in it, and unless rain descends in
a few weeks it will be perfectly dry. </p>

<p>I am also to report, that the natives attempted the camp with
the supplies before my arrival at Mount Harris, but that on the
soldier with the party firing a shot, after they had thrown a
stone and other of the weapons, they fled. It was in consequence
of their fires, which I saw at a distance of forty miles, and
which they never make on so extensive a scale, except as signals
when they want to collect, and are inclined to be mischievous,
that I made forced marches up, and I am led to believe my arrival
was very opportune. The natives have visited us since, and I do
not think they will now attempt to molest either party when we
separate. </p>

<p>The expedition of which we have just detailed the proceedings
was so far satisfactory in its results, that it not only set at
rest the hypothesis of the existence of an internal shoal sea in
southern Australia, and ascertained the actual termination of the
rivers it had been directed to trace, but also added very largely
to our knowledge of the country considerably to the westward of
former discoveries. And although no land had been traversed of a
fertile description of sufficient extent to invite the settler,
the fact of a large river such as the Darling lying at the back
of our almost intertropical <!--page 2 OBJECTS OF THE EXPEDITION. /page-->settlements, gave a fresh importance
to the distant interior. It was evident that this river was the
chief drain for carrying off the waters falling westerly from the
eastern coast, and as its course indicated a decline of country
diametrically opposite to that which had been calculated upon, it
became an object of great importance to ascertain its further
direction. Had not the saline quality of its waters been
accounted for, by the known existence of brine springs in its
bed, it would have been natural to have supposed that it
communicated with some mediterranean sea; but, under existing
circumstances, it remained to be proved whether this river held
on a due south course, or whether it ultimately turned westerly,
and ran into the heart of the interior. In order fully to
determine this point, it would be necessary to regain it banks,
so far below the parallel to which it had been traced as to leave
no doubt of its identity; but it was difficult to fix upon a plan
for approaching that central stream without suffering from the
want of water, since it could hardly be expected that the Lachlan
would afford such means, as it was reasonable to presume that its
termination was very similar to that of the Macquarie. The
attention of the government was, consequently, fixed upon the
Morumbidgee, a river stated to be of considerable size and of
impetuous current. Receiving its supplies from the lofty ranges
behind Mount Dromedary, it promised to hold a longer course than
those rivers which, depending on periodical rains alone for
existence, had been found so soon to exhaust themselves. <!--page 3 PREPARATIONS. /page--> </p>

<p>The fitting out of another expedition was accordingly
determined upon; and about the end of September 1829, I received
the Governor's instructions to make the necessary preparations
for a second descent into the interior, for the purpose of
tracing the Morumbidgee, or such rivers as it might prove to be
connected with, as far as practicable. In the event of failure in
this object, it was hoped that an attempt to regain the banks of
the Darling on a N.W. course from the point at which the
expedition might be thwarted in its primary views, would not be
unattended with success. Under any circumstances, however, by
pursuing these measures, an important part of the colony would
necessarily be traversed, of which the features were as yet
altogether unknown. </p>

<p>It became my interest and my object to make the expedition as
complete as possible, and, as far as in me lay, to provide for
every contingency: and as it appeared to me that, in all
likelihood, we should in one stage or other of our journey have
to trust entirely to water conveyance, I determined on taking a
whale-boat, whose dimensions and strength should in some measure
be proportioned to the service required. I likewise constructed a
small still for the distillation of water, in the event of our
finding the water of the Darling salt, when we should reach its
banks. The whale-boat, after being fitted, was taken to pieces
for more convenient carriage, as has been more particularly
detailed in the last chapter of the preceding volume. </p>

<p>So little danger had been apprehended from the natives <!--page 4 MR. KENT'S REPORT. /page-->in the
former journey, that three firelocks had been considered
sufficient for our defence. On the present occasion, however, I
thought it adviseable to provide arms for each individual. </p>

<p>Mr. Hume declined accompanying me, as the harvest was at hand.
Mr. George M'Leay therefore supplied his place, rather as a
companion than as an assistant; and of those who accompanied me
down the banks of the Macquarie, I again selected Harris (my body
servant), Hopkinson, and Fraser. </p>

<p>The concluding chapter of this volume, relative to the
promontory of St. Vincent, or Cape Jervis, has been furnished me
by the kindness of Mr. Kent, who accompanied the lamented officer
to whom the further exploration of that part of coast unhappily
proved fatal. There is a melancholy coincidence between Captain
Barker's death and that of Captain Cook, which cannot fail to
interest the public, as the information that has been furnished
will call for their serious consideration. I shall leave for
their proper place, the remarks I have to offer upon it, since my
motive in these prefatory observations has been, to carry the
reader forward to that point at which he will have to view the
proceedings of the expedition alone, in order the more
satisfactorily to arrive at their results. And, although he must
expect a considerable portion of dry reading in the following
pages, I have endeavoured to make the narrative of events, some
of which are remarkably striking, as interesting as possible. <!--page 5 REMARKS ON THE PRESENT WORK. /page--> </p>

<p>It only remains for me to refer the reader to the concluding
chapter of the preceding volume, for such general information as
I have been enabled to furnish upon the nature of the services on
which I was employed, and on the manner of conducting similar
expeditions. Indeed, I trust that this book (whatever be its
defects) will be found to contain much valuable information of a
practical character, and I may venture to affirm, that it will
give a true description of the country, and of the various other
subjects of which it treats. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding that I have in my dedication alluded to the
causes that prevented the earlier appearance of this work, I feel
it due both to myself and the public here to state, that during
these expeditions my health had suffered so much, that I was
unable to bear up against the effects of exposure, bodily labour,
poverty of diet, and the anxiety of mind to which I was
subjected. A residence on Norfolk Island, under peculiarly
harassing circumstances, completed that which the above causes
had commenced; and, after a succession of attacks, I became
totally blind, and am still unable either to read what I pen, or
to venture abroad without an attendant. When it is recollected,
that I have been unassisted in this work in any one particular, I
hope some excuse will be found for its imperfections. A wish to
contribute to the public good led me to undertake those journeys
which have cost me so much. The same feeling actuates me in
recording their results; and I have the satisfaction to know,
that my path among a large and savage <!--page 6 DELIVERANCE FROM DANGERS. /page-->population was a bloodless
one; and that my intercourse with them was such as to lessen the
danger to future adventurers upon such hazardous enterprises, and
to give them hope where I had so often despaired. Something more
powerful, than human foresight or human prudence, appeared to
avert the calamities and dangers with which I and my companions
were so frequently threatened; and had it not been for the
guidance and protection we received from the Providence of that
good and all-wise Being to whose care we committed ourselves, we
should, ere this, have ceased to rank among the number of His
earthly creatures.</p>

<p>The expedition which traversed the marshes of the Macquarie,
left Sydney on the 10th day of Nov. 1828. That destined to follow
the waters of the Morumbidgee, took its departure from the same
capital on the 3rd of the same month in the ensuing year. Rain
had fallen in the interval, but not in such quantities as to lead
to the apprehension that it had either influenced or swollen the
western streams. It was rather expected that the winter falls
would facilitate the progress of the expedition, and it was hoped
that, as the field of its operations would in all probability be
considerably to the south of the parallel of Port Jackson, the
extreme heat to which the party and the animals had been exposed
on the former journey, would be less felt on the present
occasion. <!--page 8 LEAVE SYDNEY. /page--> </p>

<p>As there was no Government establishment to the S.W. at which
I could effect any repairs, or recruit my supplies, as I had done
at Wellington Valley, the expedition, when it left Sydney, was
completed in every branch, and was so fully provided with every
necessary implement and comfort, as to render any further aid,
even had such been attainable, in a great measure unnecessary.
The Governor had watched over my preparations with a degree of
anxiety that evidenced the interest he felt in the expedition,
and his arrangements to ensure, as far as practicable, our being
met on our return, in the event of our being in distress, were
equally provident and satisfactory. It was not, however, to the
providing for our wants in the interior alone that His
Excellency's views were directed, but orders were given to hold a
vessel in readiness, to be dispatched at a given time to St.
Vincent's Gulf, in case we should ultimately succeed in making
the south coast in its neighbourhood. </p>

<p>The morning on which I left Sydney a second time, under such
doubtful circumstances, was perfectly serene and clear. I found
myself at 5 a.m. of that delightful morning leading my horses
through the gates of those barracks whose precincts I might never
again enter, and whose inmates I might never again behold
assembled in military array. Yet, although the chance of
misfortune flashed across my mind, I was never lighter at heart,
or more joyous in spirit. It appeared to me that the stillness
and harmony of nature influenced my feelings on the occasion, and
my mind forgot the storms of life, as nature at that moment <!--page 9 APPEARANCE OF THE PARTY. /page-->seemed
to have forgotten the tempests that sometimes agitate her. </p>

<p>I proceeded direct to the house of my friend Mr. J. Deas
Thomson, who had agreed to accompany me to Brownlow Hill, a
property belonging to Mr. M'Leay, the Colonial Secretary, where
his son, Mr. George M'Leay, was to join the expedition. As soon
as we had taken a hasty breakfast, I went to the carters'
barracks to superintend the first loading of the animals. Mr.
Murray, the superintendent, had arranged every article so well,
and had loaded the drays so compactly that I had no trouble, and
little time was lost in saddling the pack animals. At a quarter
before 7 the party filed through the turnpike-gate, and thus
commenced its journey with the greatest regularity. I have the
scene, even at this distance of time, vividly impressed upon my
mind, and I have no doubt the kind friend who was near me on the
occasion, bears it as strongly on his recollection. My servant
Harris, who had shared my wanderings and had continued in my
service for eighteen years, led the advance, with his companion
Hopkinson. Nearly abreast of them the eccentric Fraser stalked
along wholly lost in thought. The two former had laid aside their
military habits, and had substituted the broad brimmed hat and
the bushman's dress in their place, but it was impossible to
guess how Fraser intended to protect himself from the heat or the
damp, so little were his habiliments suited for the occasion. He
had his gun over his shoulder, and his double shot belt as full
as it could be of shot, although there was <!--page 10 LIVERPOOL&mdash;GOULBURN PLAINS. /page-->not a chance of his
expending a grain during the day. Some dogs Mr. Maxwell had
kindly sent me followed close at his heels, as if they knew his
interest in them, and they really seemed as if they were aware
that they were about to exchange their late confinement for the
freedom of the woods. The whole of these formed a kind of
advanced guard. At some distance in the rear the drays moved
slowly along, on one of which rode the black boy mentioned in my
former volume, and behind them followed the pack animals. Robert
Harris, whom I had appointed to superintend the animals
generally, kept his place near the horses, and the heavy Clayton,
my carpenter, brought up the rear. I shall not forget the
interest Thomson appeared to take in a scene that must certainly
have been new to him. Our progress was not checked by the
occurrence of a single accident, nor did I think it necessary to
remain with the men after we had gained that turn which, at about
four miles from Sydney, branches off to the left, and leads
direct to Liverpool. From this Point my companion and I pushed
forward, in order to terminate a fifty miles' ride a little
sooner than we should have done at the leisurely pace we had kept
during the early part of our journey. We remained in Liverpool
for a short time, to prepare the commissariat office for the
reception, and to ensure the accommodation, of the party; and
reached Brownlow Hill a little after sunset. </p>

<p>As I have already described the country on this line of road
as far us Goulburn Plains, it will not be considered ne<!--page 11 WALLANDILLY&mdash;TYRANNA. /page-->cessary
that I should again notice its features with minuteness. </p>

<p>The party arrived at Glendarewel, the farm attached to
Brownlow Hill, on the 5th. I resumed my journey alone on the 8th.
M'Leay had still some few arrangements to make, so that I
dispensed with his immediate attendance. He overtook me, however,
sooner than I expected, on the banks of the Wallandilly. I had
encamped under the bluff end of Cookbundoon, and, having been
disappointed in getting bearings when crossing the Razor Back, I
hoped that I should be enabled to connect a triangle from the
summit of Cookbundoon, or to secure bearings of some prominent
hill to the south. I found the brush, however, so thick on the
top of the mountain, that I could obtain no satisfactory view,
and and M'Leay, who accompanied me, agreed with me in considering
that we were but ill repaid for the hot scramble we had had.
Crossing the western extremity of Goulburn Plains on the 15th, we
encamped on a chain of ponds behind Doctor Gibson's residence at
Tyranna, and as I had some arrangements to make with that
gentleman, I determined to give both the men and animals a day's
rest. I availed myself of Doctor Gibson's magazines to replace
such of my provisions as I had expended, as I found that I could
do so without putting him to any inconvenience; and I added two
of his men to the party, intending to send them back, in case of
necessity, or, when we should have arrived at that point from
which it might appear expedient to forward an account of my
progress and ultimate views, for the governor's information. <!--page 12 BREADALBANE PLAINS. /page--> </p>

<p>On the 17th we struck the tents, and, crossing the chain of
ponds near which they had been pitched, entered a forest track,
that gave place to barren stony ridges of quartz formation. These
continued for six or seven miles, in the direction of Breadalbane
Plains, upon which we were obliged to stop, as we should have had
some difficulty in procuring either water or food, within any
moderate distance beyond them. The water, indeed, that we were
obliged to content ourselves with was by no means good.
Breadalbane Plains are of inconsiderable extent, and are
surrounded by ridges, the appearance of which is not very
promising. Large white masses of quartz rock lie scattered over
them, amongst trees of stunted growth. Mr. Redall's farm was
visible at the further extremity of the plains from that by which
we had entered them. It would appear that these plains are
connected with Goulburn Plains by a narrow valley, that was too
wet for the drays to have traversed. </p>

<p>Doctor Gibson had kindly accompanied us to Breadalbane Plains.
On the morning of the 18th he returned to Tyranna, and we pursued
our journey, keeping mostly on a W.S.W. course. From the barren
hills over which we passed, on leaving the plains, we descended
upon an undulating country, and found a change of rock, as well
as of vegetation, upon it. Granite and porphyry constituted its
base. An open forest, on which the eucalyptus mannifera alone
prevailed, lay on either side of us, and although the soil was
coarse, and partook in a great measure of the decomposition of
the rock it covered, there was no defici<!--page 13 THE LORN. /page-->ency of grass. On the
contrary, this part of the interior is decidedly well adapted for
pasturing cattle. </p>

<p>About 1 p.m. we passed Mr. Hume's station, with whom I
remained for a short time. He had fixed his establishment on the
banks of the Lorn, a small river, issuing from the broken country
near Lake George, and now ascertained to be one of the largest
branches of the Lachlan River. We had descended a barren pass of
stringy bark scrub, on sandstone rock, a little before we reached
Mr. Hume's station, but around it the same, open forest tract
again prevailed. We crossed the Lorn, at 2 o'clock, leaving Mr.
Broughton's farm upon our left, and passed through a broken
country, which was very far from being deficient in pasture. We
encamped on the side of a water-course, about 4 o'clock, having
travelled about fifteen miles. </p>

<p>On the 19th, we observed no change in the soil or aspect of
the country, for the first five miles. The eucalyptus mannifera
was the most prevalent of the forest trees, and certainly its
presence indicated a more flourishing state in the minor
vegetation. At about five miles, however, from where we had
slept, sandstone reappeared, and with it the barren scrub that
usually grows upon a sandy and inhospitable soil. One of the
drays was upset in its progress down a broken pass, where the
road had been altogether neglected, and it was difficult to avoid
accidents. Fortunately we suffered no further than in the delay
that the necessity of unloading the dray, and reloading it,
occasioned. Mr. O'Brien, an enterprising settler, who had <!--page 14 YASS PLAINS. /page-->pushed
his flocks to the banks of the Morumbidgee, and who was
proceeding to visit his several stations, overtook us in the
midst of our troubles. We had already passed each other
frequently on the road, but he now preceded me to his
establishment at Yass; at which I proposed remaining for a day.
We stopped about three miles short of the plains for the night,
at the gorge of the pass through which we had latterly been
advancing, and had gradually descended to a more open country.
From the place at which we were temporarily delayed, and which is
not inappropriately called the Devil's Pass, the road winds about
between ranges, differing in every respect from any we had as yet
noticed. The sides of the hills were steeper, and their summits
sharper, than any we had crossed. They were thickly covered with
eucalypti and brush, and, though based upon sandstone, were
themselves of a schistose formation. </p>

<p>Yharr or Yass Plains were discovered by Mr. Hovel, and Mr.
Hume, the companion of my journey down the Macquarie, in 1828.
They take their name from the little river that flows along their
north and north-west boundaries. They are surrounded on every
side by forests, and excepting to the W.N.W., as a central point,
by hill. Undulating, but naked themselves, they have the
appearance of open downs, and are most admirably adapted for
sheep-walks, not only in point of vegetation, but also, because
their inequalities prevent their becoming swampy during the rainy
season. They are from nine to twelve miles in <!--page 15 HOSPITALITY OF MR. O'BRIEN. /page-->length, and from
five to seven in breadth, and although large masses of sandstone
are scattered over them, a blue secondary limestone composes the
general bed of the river, that was darker in colour and more
compact than I had remarked the same kind of rock, either at
Wellington Valley, or in the Shoal Haven Gully. I have no doubt
that Yass Plains will ere long be wholly taken up as sheep-walks,
and that their value to the grazier will in a great measure
counterbalance its distance from the coast, or, more properly
speaking, from the capital. Sheep I should imagine would thrive
uncommonly well upon these plains, and would suffer less from
distempers incidental to locality and to climate, than in many
parts of the colony over which they are now wandering in
thousands. And if the plains themselves do not afford extensive
arable tracts, there is, at least, sufficient good land near the
river to supply the wants of a numerous body of settlers. </p>

<p>We left Mr. O'Brien's station on the morning of the 21st, and,
agreeably to his advice, determined on gaining the Morumbidgee,
by a circuit to the N.W., rather than endanger the safety of the
drays by entering the mountain passes to the westward. Mr.
O'Brien, however, would not permit us to depart from his dwelling
without taking away with us some further proofs of his
hospitality. The party had pushed forward before I, or Mr.
M'Leay, had mounted our horses; but on overtaking it, we found
that eight fine wethers had been added to our stock of animals. </p>

<p>To the W.N.W. of Yass Plains there is a remarkable <!--page 16 HILL OF POUNI. /page-->hill,
called Pouni, remarkable not so much on account of its height, as
of its commanding position. It had, I believe, already been
ascended by one of the Surveyor-general's assistants. The
impracticability of the country to the south of it, obliged us to
pass under its opposite base, from which an open forest country
extended to the northward. We had already recrossed the Yass
River, and passed Mr. Barber's station, to that of Mr. Hume's
father, at which we stopped for a short time. Both farms are well
situated, the latter I should say, romantically so, it being
immediately under Pouni, the hill we have noticed. The country
around both was open, and both pasture and water were abundant. </p>

<p>Mr. O'Brien had been kind enough to send one of the natives
who frequented his station to escort us to his more advanced
station upon the Morumbidgee. Had it not been for the assistance
we received from this man, I should have had but little leisure
for other duties: as it was however, there was no fear of the
party going astray. This gave M'Leay and myself an opportunity of
ascending Pouni, for the purpose of taking bearings; and how ever
warm the exertion of the ascent made us, the view from the summit
of the hill sufficiently repaid us, and the cool breeze that
struck it, although imperceptible in the forest below, soon dried
the perspiration from our brows. The scenery around us was
certainly varied, yet many parts of it put me forcibly in mind of
the dark and gloomy tracks over which my eye had wandered from
similar elevations on the former journey. This was especially the
<!--page 17 ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY. /page-->case in looking to the north, towards which point the hills
forming the right of the valley by which we had entered the
plains, decreased so rapidly in height that they were lost in the
general equality of the more remote country, almost ere they had
reached abreast of my position. From E.S.E. to W.S.W. the face of
the country was hilly, broken and irregular; forming deep ravines
and precipitous glens, amid which I was well aware the
Morumbidgee was still struggling for freedom; while mountains
succeeded mountains in the back-ground, and were themselves
overtopped by lofty and very distant peaks. To the eastward,
however, the hills wore a more regular form, and were lightly
covered with wood. The plains occupied the space between them and
Pouni; and a smaller plain bore N.N.E. which, being embosomed in
the forest, had hitherto escaped our notice. </p>

<p>We overtook the party just as it cleared the open ground
through which it had previously been moving. A barren scrub
succeeded it for about eight miles. The soil in this scrub was
light and sandy. </p>

<p>We stopped for the night at the head of a valley that seemed
to have been well trodden by cattle. The feed, therefore, was not
abundant, nor was the water good. We had, however, made a very
fair journey, and I was unwilling to press the animals. But in
consequence, I fancy, of the scarcity of food, they managed to
creep away during the night, with the exception of three or four
of the bullocks, <!--page 18 COURSE OF A HURRICANE. /page-->nor should we have collected them again so soon
as we did, or without infinite trouble, had it not been for our
guide and my black boy. We unavoidably lost a day, but left our
position on the 23rd, for Underaliga, a station occupied by
Doctor Harris, the gentleman I have already had occasion to
mention. We reached the banks of the creek near the stock hut,
about 4 p.m., having journeyed during the greater part of the day
through a poor country, partly of scrub and partly of open
forest-land, in neither of which was the soil or vegetation fresh
or abundant. At about three miles from Underaliga, the country
entirely changed its character, and its flatness was succeeded by
a broken and undulating surface. The soil upon the hills was
coarse and sandy, from the decomposition of the granite rock that
constituted their base. Nevertheless, the grass was abundant on
the hills, though the roots or tufts were far apart; and the
hills were lightly studded with trees. </p>

<p>In the course of the day we crossed the line of a hurricane
that had just swept with resistless force over the country,
preserving a due north course, and which we had heard from a
distance, fortunately too great to admit of its injuring us. It
had opened a fearful gap in the forest through which it had
passed, of about a quarter of a mile in breadth. Within that
space, no tree had been able to withstand its fury, for it had
wrenched every bough from such as it had failed to prostrate, and
they stood naked in the midst of the surrounding wreck. I am
inclined to think that the rudeness of nature itself in these
wild and uninhabited regions, <!--page 19 COUNTRY FROM UNDERALIGA TO MORUMBIDGEE. /page-->gives birth to these terrific
phenomena. They have never occurred, so far as I know, in the
located districts. Our guide deserted us in the early part of the
day without assigning any reason for doing so. He went off
without being noticed, and thus lost the reward that would have
been bestowed on him had he mentioned his wish to return to Yass.
I the more regretted his having sneaked off, because he had had
the kindness to put us on a track we could not well lose. </p>

<p>Underaliga, is said to be thirty miles from the Morumbidgee.
The country between the two has a sameness of character
throughout. It is broken and irregular, yet no one hill rises
conspicuously over the rest. We found ourselves at one time on
their summits beside huge masses of granite, at others crossing
valleys of rich soil and green appearance. A country under
cultivation is so widely different from one the sod of which has
never been broken by the plough, that it is difficult and
hazardous to form a decided opinion on the latter. If you ask a
stockman what kind of a country lies, either to his right, or to
his left, he is sure to condemn it, unless it will afford the
most abundant pasture. Accustomed to roam about from one place to
another, these men despise any but the richest tracts, and
include the rest of the neighbourhood in one sweeping clause of
condemnation. Thus I was led to expect, that we should pass over
a country of the very worst description, between Underaliga and
the Morumbidgee. Had it been similar to that midway between Yass
and Underaliga, we should, in <!--page 20 TUGGIONG. /page-->truth, have found it so; but it
struck me, that there were many rich tracts of ground among the
valleys of the former, and that the very hills had a fair
covering of grass upon them. What though the soil was coarse, if
the vegetation was good and sufficient? Perhaps the greatest
drawback to this part of the interior is the want of water; yet
we crossed several creeks, and remarked some deep water holes,
that can never be exhausted, even in the driest season. Wherever
the situation favoured our obtaining a view of the country on
either side of us, while among these hills, we found that to the
eastward lofty and mountainous; whilst that to the westward, had
the appearance of fast sinking into a level. </p>

<p>A short time before we reached the Morumbidgee, we forded a
creek, which we crossed a second time where it falls into the
river. After crossing it the first time we opened a flat, on
which the marks of sheep were abundant. In the distance there was
a small hill, and on its top a bark hut. We were not until then
aware of our being so near the river, but as Mr. O'Brien had
informed me that he had a station for sheep, at a place called
Tuggiong <!--comment {Jugiong} /comment-->, by the natives, on the immediate banks of the river, I
did not doubt that we had, at length, arrived at it. And so it
proved. I went to the hut, to ascertain where I could
conveniently stop for the night, but the residents were absent. I
could not but admire the position they had taken up. The hill
upon which their hut was erected was not more than fifty feet
high, but it immediately overlooked the river, and command<!--page 21 CROSS THE UNDERALIGA. /page-->ed not
only the flat we had traversed in approaching it, but also a
second flat on the opposite side. The Morumbidgee came down to
the foot of this little hill from the south, and, of course,
running to the north, which latter direction it suddenly takes up
from a previous S.W. one, on meeting some hills that check its
direct course. From the hill on which the hut stands, it runs
away westward, almost in a direct line, for three miles, so that
the position commands a view of both the reaches, which are
overhung by the casuarina and flooded-gum. Rich alluvial flats
lie to the right of the stream, backed by moderate hills, that
were lightly studded with trees, and clothed with verdure to
their summits. Some moderate elevations also backed a flat, on
the left bank of the river, but the colour of the soil upon the
latter, as well as its depressed situation, showed clearly that
it was subject to flood, and had received the worst of the
depositions from the mountains. The hills behind it were also
bare, and of a light red colour, betraying, as I imagined, a
distinct formation from, and poorer character than, the hills
behind us. At about three miles the river again suddenly changes
its direction from west to south, for about a mile, when it
inclines to the S.E. until it nearly encircles the opposite
hills, when it assumes its proper direction, and flows away to
the S.W. </p>

<p>We crossed the Underaliga creek a little below the stock hut,
and encamped about a mile beyond it, in the centre of a long
plain. We were surrounded on every side by hills, from which
there was no visible outlet, as they appeared <!--page 22 REACH THE MORUMBIDGEE. /page /page-->to follow the bend
of the river, with an even and unbroken outline. The scenery
around us was wild, romantic, and beautiful; as beautiful as a
rich and glowing sunset in the most delightful climate under the
heavens could make it. I had been more anxious to gain the banks
of the Morumbidgee on this occasion, than I had been on a former
one to gain those of the Macquarie, for although I could not hope
to see the Morumbidgee all that it had been described to me, yet
I felt that on its first appearance I should in some measure
ground my anticipations of ultimate success. When I arrived on
the banks of the Macquarie, it had almost ceased to flow, and its
current was so gentle as to be scarcely perceptible. Instead,
however, of a river in such a state of exhaustion, I now looked
down upon a stream, whose current it would have been difficult to
breast, and whose waters, foaming among rocks, or circling in
eddies, gave early promise of a reckless course. It must have
been somewhat below its ordinary level, and averaged a breadth of
about 80 feet. Its waters were hard and transparent, and its bed
was composed of mountain debris, and large fragments of rock. As
soon as the morning dawned, the tents were struck and we pursued
our journey. We followed the line of the river, until we found
ourselves in a deep bight to the S.E. The hills that had been
gradually closing in upon the river, now approached it so nearly,
that there was no room for the passage of the drays. We were
consequently obliged to turn back, and, moving along the base of
the ranges, by which we were thus <!--page 23 ADJACENT COUNTRY.-->apparently enclosed, we at
length found a steep pass, the extreme narrowness of which had
hidden it from our observation. By this pass we were now enabled
to effect our escape. On gaining the summit of the hills, we
travelled south for three or four miles, through open forests,
and on level ground. But we ultimately descended into a valley in
which we halted for the night. On a closer examination of the
neighbourhood, it appeared that our position was at the immediate
junction of two valleys, where, uniting the waters of their
respective creeks, the main branch declines rapidly towards the
river. One of these valleys extended to to the S.W., the other to
the W.N.W. It was evident to us that our route lay up the former;
and I made no doubt we should easily reach Whaby's station on the
morrow. </p>

<p>We were now far beyond the acknowledged limits of the located
parts of the colony, and Mr. Whaby's station was the last at
which we could expect even the casual supply of milk or other
trifling relief. Yet, although the prospect of so soon leaving
even the outskirts of civilization, and being wholly thrown on
our own resources, was so near, it never for a moment weighed
upon the minds of the men. The novelty of the scenery, and the
beauty of the river on which they were journeying, excited in
them the liveliest anticipations of success. The facility with
which we had hitherto pushed forward blinded them to future
difficulties, nor could there be a more cheerful spectacle than
that which the camp daily afforded. The animals browzing in the
distance, and the men talking over their pipes of the <!--page 24 WHABY'S STATION. /page-->probable
adventures they might encounter. The loads had by this time
settled properly, and our provisions proved of the very best
quality, so that no possible improvement could have been made for
the better. </p>

<p>On the morrow we pushed up the southernmost of the valleys, at
the junction of which we had encamped, having moderate hills on
either side of us. At the head of the valley we crossed a small
dividing range into another valley, and halted for the night, on
the banks of a creek from the westward, as we found it impossible
to reach Whaby's station, as we had intended, before sunset.
Nothing could exceed the luxuriance of the vegetation in this
valley, but the water of the creek was so impregnated with iron,
as to be almost useless. Being anxious to obtain a view of the
surrounding country, I ascended a hill behind the camp, just as
the sun was sinking, a time the most favourable for the object I
had in view. The country, broken into hill and dale, seemed
richer than any tract I had as yet surveyed; and the beauty of
the near landscape was greatly heightened by the mountainous
scenery to the S. and S.E. Both the laxmania, and zanthorea were
growing around me; but neither appeared to be in congenial soil.
The face of the hill was very stony, and I found, on examination,
that a great change had taken place in the rock-formation, the
granite ranges having given place to chlorite schist. </p>

<p>We reached Whaby's about 9 a.m. of the morning of the 27th,
and received every attention and civility from him. The valley in
which we had slept opened upon an extensive plain, to the
eastward of which the Morumbidgee formed <!--page 25 THE RIVER DUMOT. /page-->the extreme boundary;
and it was in a bight, and on ground rather elevated above the
plain, that he had fixed his residence. He informed me that we
should have to cross the river, as its banks were too
precipitous, and the ranges too abrupt, to admit of our keeping
the right side; and recommended me to examine and fix upon a spot
at which to cross, before I again moved forward, expressing his
readiness to accompany me as a guide. We accordingly rode down
the river, to a place at which some stockman had effected a
passage,&mdash;after a week's labour in hewing out a canoe. I
by no means intended that a similar delay should occur in our
case, but I saw no objection to our crossing at the same place;
since its depth, and consequent tranquillity, rendered it
eligible enough for that purpose. </p>

<p>The Dumot <!--comment {probably the Tumut} /comment--> river, another mountain stream, joins the
Morumbidgee opposite to Mr. Whaby's residence. It is little
inferior to the latter either in size or in the rapidity of its
current, and, if I may rely on the information I received, waters
a finer country, the principal rock-formation upon it being of
limestone and whinstone. It rises amidst the snowy ranges to the
S.E., and its banks are better peopled than those of the stream
into which it discharges itself. Of course, such a tributary
enlarges the Morumbidgee considerably: indeed, the fact is
sufficiently evident from the appearance of the latter below the
junction. </p>

<p>During our ride with Whaby down its banks, we saw nothing but
the richest flats, almost entirely clear of timber and containing
from 400 to 700 acres, backed by ranges that were but partially
wooded, and were clothed with ver<!--page 26 CROSS AND RE-CROSS /page-->dure to their very summits. The
herds that were scattered over the first were almost lost in the
height of the vegetation, and the ranges served as natural
barriers to prevent them from straying away. </p>

<p>On the following morning, we started for the place at which it
had been arranged that we should cross the Morumbidgee, but,
though no more than five miles in a direct line from Whaby's
house, in consequence of the irregularity of the ground, the
drays did not reach it before noon. The weight and quantity of
our stores being taken into consideration, the task we had before
us was not a light one. Such, however, was the industry of the
men, that before it became dark the whole of them, including the
drays and sheep, were safely deposited on the opposite bank. We
were enabled to be thus expeditious, by means of a punt that we
made with the tarpaulins on an oblong frame. As soon as it was
finished, a rope was conveyed across the river, and secured to a
tree, and a running cord being then fastened to the punt, a
temporary ferry was established, and the removal of our stores
rendered comparatively easy. M'Leay undertook to drive the horses
and cattle over a ford below us, but he did not calculate on the
stubborn disposition of the latter, and, consequently,
experienced some difficulty, and was well nigh swept away by the
current. So great was his difficulty, that he was obliged to
land, to his great discomfiture, amidst a grove of lofty nettles.
Mulholland, who accompanied him, and who happened to be naked,
was severly stung by them. The labour of the day was, how<!--page 27 THE MORUMBIDGEE. /page-->ever,
satisfactorily concluded, and we lay down to rest with feelings
of entire satisfaction. </p>

<p>A great part of the following day was consumed in reloading,
nor did we pursue our journey until after two o'clock. We then
passed over tracks on the left of the river of the same rich
description that existed on its right; they were much intersected
by creeks, but were clear of timber, and entirely out of the
reach of floods. At about seven miles from where we started, we
found ourselves checked by precipitous rocks jutting into the
stream, and were obliged once more to make preparations for
crossing it. Instead of a deep and quiet reach, however, the
Morumbidgee here expanded into a fretful rapid; but it was
sufficiently shallow to admit of our taking the drays over,
without the trouble of unloading them. There was still, however,
some labour required in cutting down the banks, and the men were
fully occupied until after sunset; and so well did they work,
that an hour's exertion in the morning enabled us to make the
passage with safety. On ascending the right bank, we found that
we had to force through a dense body of reeds, covering some
flooded land, at the base of a range terminating upon the river;
and we were obliged, in order to extricate ourselves from our
embarrassments, to pass to the N.W. of the point, and to cross a
low part of the range. This done, we met with no further
interruptions during the day, but travelled along rich and clear
flats to a deep bight below an angle of the river called Nangaar
by the natives; where we pitched our camp, and <!--page 28 THE MORUMBIDGEE. /page-->our animals
revelled amid the most luxuriant pasture. Only in one place did
the sandy superficies upon the plain indicate that it was there
subject to flood. </p>

<p>The Morumbidgee from Tuggiong to our present encampment had
held a general S.S.W. course, but from the summit of a hill
behind the tents it now appeared to be gradually sweeping round
to the westward; and I could trace the line of trees upon its
banks, through a rich and extensive valley in that direction, as
far as my sight could reach. The country to the S.E. maintained
its lofty character, but to the westward the hills and ranges
were evidently decreasing in height, and the distant interior
seemed fast sinking to a level. The general direction of the
ranges had been from N. to S., and as we had been travelling
parallel to them, their valleys were shut from our view. Now,
however, several rich and extensive ones became visible, opening
from the southward into the valley of the Morumbidgee, and, as a
further evidence of a change of country from a confused to a more
open one, a plain of considerable size stretched from immediately
beneath the hill on which I was to the N.W. </p>

<p>The Morumbidgee itself, from the length and regularity of its
reaches, as well as from its increased size, seemed to intimate
that it had successfully struggled through the broken country in
which it rises, and that it would henceforward meet with fewer
interruptions to its course. It still, however, preserved all the
characters of a mountain stream; having alternate rapids and deep
pools, being in many places encumbered with fallen timber, and
generally <!--page 29 GEOLOGY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. /page--> a shingly bed, composed of rounded fragments of every
rock of which the neighbouring ranges were formed, and many
others that had been swept by the torrents down it. The rock
formation of the hills upon its right continued of that chlorite
schist which prevailed near Mr. Whaby's, which I have already
noticed, and quartz still appeared in large masses, on the
loftier ranges opposite, so that the geology of the neighbourhood
could not be said to have undergone any material change. It
might, however, be considered an extraordinary feature in it,
that a small hill of blue limestone existed upon the left bank of
the river. The last place at which we had seen limestone was at
Yass, but I had learned from Mr. Whaby, that, together with
whinstone, it was abundant near a Mr. Rose's station on the
Dumot, that was not at any great distance. The irregularity,
however, of the intervening country, made the appearance of this
solitary rock more singular. </p>

<p>Although the fires of the natives had been frequent upon the
river, none had, as yet, ventured to approach us, in consequence
of some misunderstanding that had taken place between them and
Mr. Stuckey's stockmen. Mr. Roberts' stockmen* <span class="note">[These men had
lately fixed themselves on the river a little below Mr. Whaby's.]</span>,
however, brought a man and a boy to us at this place in the
afternoon, but I could not persuade them to accompany us on our
journey&mdash;neither could I, although my native boy
understood them perfectly, gain any particular information from
them. </p>

<p>In consequence of rain, we did not strike the tents so <!--page 30 BEAUTIFUL PROSPECT. /page-->early
as usual. At 7 a.m. a heavy thunder storm occurred from the N.W.
after which the sky cleared, and we were enabled to push forward
at 11 a.m., moving on a general W.N.W, course, over rich flats,
which, having been moistened by the morning's showers, showed the
dark colour of the rich earth of which they were composed. Some
sand-hills were, however, observed near the river, of about
fifteen feet in elevation, crowned by banksias; and the soil of
the flats had a very partial mixture of sand in it. How these
sand-hills could have been formed it is difficult to say; but
they produced little minor vegetation, and were as pure as the
sand of the sea-shore. Some considerable plains were noticed to
our right, in appearance not inferior to the ground on which we
were journeying. At noon we rose gradually from the level of
these plains, and travelled along the side of a hill, until we
got to a small creek, at which we stopped, though more than a
mile and a half from the river. The clouds had been gathering
again in the N.W. quarter, and we had scarcely time to secure our
flour, when a second storm burst upon us, and it continued to
rain violently for the remainder of the day. </p>

<p>From a small hill that lay to our left Mr. M'Leay and I
enjoyed a most beautiful view. Beneath us to the S. E. the rich
and lightly timbered valley through which the Morumbidgee flows,
extended, and parts of the river were visible through the dark
masses of swamp-oak by which it was lined, or glittering among
the flooded-gum trees, that grew in its vicinity. In the distance
was an extensive <!--page 31 NATIVES&mdash;THEIR SUFFERING FROM COLD. /page-->valley that wound between successive mountain
ranges. More to the eastward, both mountain and woodland bore a
dark and gloomy shade, probably in consequence of the light upon
them at the time. Those lofty peaks that had borne nearly south
of us from Pouni, near Yass, now rose over the last-mentioned
ranges, and by their appearance seemed evidently to belong to a
high and rugged chain. To the westward, the decline of country
was more observable than ever; and the hills on both sides of the
river, were lower and more distant from it. Those upon which we
found ourselves were composed of iron-stone, were precipitous
towards the river in many places, of sandy soil, and were crowned
with beef-wood as well as box. The change in the rock-formation
and in the soil, produced a corresponding change in the
vegetation. The timber was not so large as it had been, neither
did the hills any longer bear the green appearance which had
distinguished those we had passed to their very summits. The
grass here grew in tufts amidst the sand, and was of a burnt
appearance as if it had suffered from drought. </p>

<p>Some natives had joined us in the morning, and acted as our
guides; or it is more than probable that we should have continued
our course along the river, and got enbarrassed among impediments
that were visible from our elevated position; for it was evident
that the range we had ascended terminated in an abrupt precipice
on the river, that we could not have passed. The blacks suffered
beyond what I could have imagined, from cold, and <!--page 32 SMOKING AN OPOSSUM. /page-->seemed as
incapable of enduring it as if they had experienced the rigour of
a northern snow storm. </p>

<p>The morning of the 2nd December was cloudy and lowering, and
the wind still hung in the N.W. There was truly every appearance
of bad weather, but our anxiety to proceed on our journey
overcame our apprehensions, and the animals were loaded and moved
off at 7 a.m. The rain which had fallen the evening previous,
rendered travelling heavy; so that we got on but slowly. At 11,
the clouds burst, and continued to pour down for the rest of the
day. On leaving the creek we crossed the spine of the range, and
descending from it into a valley, that continued to the river on
the one hand, and stretched away to the N.W. on the other, we
ascended some hills opposite to us, and moved generally through
open, undulating forest ground, affording good pasturage. </p>

<p>One of the blacks being anxious to get an opossum out of a
dead tree, every branch of which was hollow, asked for a
tomahawk, with which he cut a hole in the trunk above where he
thought the animal lay concealed. He found however, that he had
cut too low, and that it had run higher up. This made it
necessary to smoke it out; he accordingly got some dry grass, and
having kindled a fire, stuffed it into the hole he had cut. A
raging fire soon kindled in the tree, where the draft was great,
and dense columns of smoke issued from the end of each branch as
thick as that from the chimney of a steam engine. The shell of
the tree was so thin that I thought <!--page 33 ACCIDENTS. /page-->it would soon be burnt
through, and that the tree would fall; but the black had no such
fears, and, ascending to the highest branch, he watched anxiously
for the poor little wretch he had thus surrounded with dangers
and devoted to destruction; and no sooner did it appear, half
singed and half roasted, than he seized upon it and threw it down
to us with an air of triumph. The effect of the scene in so
lonely a forest, was very fine. The roaring of the fire in the
tree, the fearless attitude of the savage, and the associations
which his colour and appearance, enveloped as he was in smoke,
called up, were singular, and still dwell on my recollection. We
had not long left the tree, when it fell with a tremendous crash,
and was, when we next passed that way, a mere heap of ashes. </p>

<p>Shortly before it commenced raining, the dogs started an emu,
and took after it, followed by M'Leay and myself. We failed in
killing it, and I was unfortunate enough to lose a most excellent
watch upon the occasion, which in regularity was superior to the
chronometer I had with me. </p>

<p>As there was no hope of the weather clearing up, I sent M'Leay
and one of the blacks with the flour to the river, with
directions to pile it up and cover it with tarpaulins, as soon as
possible, remaining myself to bring up the drays. It was not,
however, until after 4 p.m. that we gained the river-side, or
that we were enabled to get into shelter. Fraser met with a sad
accident while assisting the driver of the teams, who,
accidentally, struck him with the end of the lash of his whip in
the eye, and cut the lower <!--page 34 PONDEBADGERY. /page-->lid in two. The poor fellow fell to
the ground as if he had been shot, and really, from the report of
the whip, I was at first uncertain of the nature of the accident.
</p>

<p>We had gradually ascended some hills; and as the sweep of the
valley led southerly, we continued along it until we got to its
very head; then, crossing the ridge we descended the opposite
side, towards a beautiful plain, on the further extremity of
which the river line was marked by the dark-leafed casuarina. In
spite of the badness of the weather and the misfortunes of the
day, I could not but admire the beauty of the scene. We were
obliged to remain stationary the following day, in consequence of
one of the drays being out of repair, and requiring a new
axle-tree. I could hardly regret the necessity that kept us in so
delightful a spot. This plain, which the natives called
Pondebadgery <!--comment {Wantabadgery} /comment-->, and in which a station has since been formed, is
about two miles in breadth, by about three and a-half in length.
It is surrounded apparently on every side by hills. The river
running E. and W. forms its southern boundary. The hills by which
we had entered it, terminating abruptly on the river to the
north-east, form a semi-circle round it to the N.N.W. where a
valley, the end of which cannot be seen, runs to the north-west,
of about half a mile in breadth. On the opposite side of the
river moderate hills rise over each other, and leave little space
between them and its banks. The Morumbidgee itself, with an
increased breadth, averaging from seventy to eighty yards,
presents a still, deep sheet of water <!--page 35 PONDEBADGERY. /page-->to the view, over which the
casuarina bends with all the grace of the willow, or the birch,
but with more sombre foliage. To the west, a high line of
flooded-gum trees extending from the river to the base of the
hills which form the west side of the valley before noticed,
hides the near elevations, and thus shuts in the whole space. The
soil of the plain is of the richest description, and the hills
backing it, together with the valley, are capable of depasturing
the most extensive flocks. </p>

<p>Such is the general landscape from the centre of Pondebadgery
Plain. Behind the line of gum-trees, the river suddenly sweeps
away to the south, and forms a deep bight of seven miles, when,
bearing up again to the N.W. it meets some hills about 10 miles
to the W.N.W. of the plain, thus encircling a still more
extensive space, that for richness of soil, and for abundance of
pasture, can nowhere be excelled; such, though on a smaller
scale, are all the flats that adorn the banks of the Morumbidgee,
first on one side and then on the other, as the hills close in
upon them, from Juggiong to Pondebadgery. </p>

<p>It is deeply to be regretted that this noble river should
exist at such a distance from the capital as to be unavailable.
During our stay on the Pondebadgery Plain, the men caught a
number of codfish, as they are generally termed, but which are,
in reality, a species of perch. The largest weighed 40 lb. but
the majority of the others were small, not exceeding from six to
eight. M'Leay and I walked to the N.W. extremity of the plain, in
order to ascertain how we should debouche from it, and to get, if
pos<!--page 36 TRAVELLING DOWN THE RIVER. /page-->sible, a view of the western interior. We took with us two
blacks who had attached themselves to the party, and had made
themselves generally useful. On ascending the most westerly of
the hills, we found it composed of micaceous schist, the upper
coat of which was extremely soft, and broke with a slaty
fracture, or crumbled into a sparkling dust beneath our feet. The
summit of the hill was barren, and beef-wood alone grew on it.
The valley, of which it was the western boundary, ran up
northerly for two or three miles, with all the appearance of
richness and verdure. To the south extended the flat I have
noticed, more heavily timbered than we had usually found them,
bounded, or backed rather, by a hilly country, although one fast
losing in its general height. To the W.N.W. there was a moderate
range of hills on the opposite side of an extensive valley,
running up northerly, from which a lateral branch swept round to
the W.N.W. with a gradual ascent into the hills, which bore the
same appearance of open forest, grazing land, as prevailed in
similar tracts to the eastward. The blacks pointed out to us our
route up the valley, and stated that we should get on the banks
of the river again in a direction W. by N. from the place on
which we stood. We accordingly crossed the principal valley on
the following morning, and gradually ascended the opposite line
of hills. They terminate to the S.E. in lofty precipices,
overlooking the river flats, and having a deep chain of ponds
under them. The descent towards the river was abrupt, and we
encamped upon its banks, with a more confined view <!--page 37 TRAVELLING DOWN THE RIVER. /page-->than any we
had ever had before. There was an evident change in the river;
the banks were reedy, the channel deep and muddy, and the
neighbourhood bore more the appearance of being subject to
overflow than it had done in any one place we had passed over.
The hills were much lower, and as we gained the southern brow of
that under which we encamped, we could see a level and wooded
country to the westward. The line of the horizon was unbroken by
any hills in the distance, and the nearer ones seemed gradually
to lose themselves in the darkness of the landscape. </p>

<p>The two natives, whom the stockmen had named Peter and Jemmie,
were of infinite service to us, from their knowledge of all the
passes, and the general features of the country. Having, however,
seen us thus far on the journey from their usual haunts, they
became anxious to return, and it was with some difficulty we
persuaded them to accompany us for a few days longer, in hopes of
reward. The weather had been cool and pleasant; the thermometer
averaging 78 of Fahrenheit at noon, in consequences of which the
animals kept in good condition, the men healthy and zealous. The
sheep Mr. O'Brien had presented to us, gave no additional
trouble; they followed in the rear of the party without
attempting to wander, and were secured at night in a small pen or
fold. No waste attended their slaughter, nor did they lose in
condition, from being driven from ten to fifteen miles daily, so
much as I had been led to suppose they would have done.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>From our camp, the Morumbidgee held a direct westerly course
for about three miles. The hills under which we had encamped,
rose so close upon our right as to leave little space between
them and the river. At the distance of three miles, however, they
suddenly terminated, and the river changed its direction to the
S.W., while a chain of ponds extended to the westward, and
separated the alluvial flats from a somewhat more elevated plain
before us. We kept these ponds upon our left for some time, but,
as they ultimately followed the bend of the river, we left them.
The blacks led us on a W. by S. course to the base of a small
range two or three miles distant, near which there was a deep
lagoon. It was evident they here expected to have found some
other natives. Being disappointed, how<!--page 39 NATIVES&mdash;WILD GAME, &amp;c. /page-->ever, they turned in
towards the river again, but we stopped short of it on the side
of a serpentine sheet of water, an apparent continuation of the
chain of ponds we had left behind us, forming a kind of ditch
round the S.W. extremity of the range, parallel to which we had
continued to travel. This range, which had been gradually
decreasing in height from the lagoon, above which it rose
perpendicularly, might almost be said to terminate here. We fell
in with two or three natives before we halted, but the evident
want of population in so fine a country, and on so noble a river,
surprised me extremely. We saw several red kangaroos in the
course of the day, and succeeded in killing one. It certainly is
a beautiful animal, ranging the wilds in native freedom. The
female and the kid are of a light mouse-colour. Wild turkeys
abound on this part of the Morumbidgee, but with the exception of
a few terns, which are found hovering over the lagoons, no new
birds had as yet been procured; and the only plant that enriched
our collection, was an unknown metrosideros. In crossing the
extremity of the range, the wheels of the dray sunk deep into a
yielding and coarse sandy soil, of decomposed granite, on which
forest-grass prevailed in tufts, which, being far apart, made the
ground uneven, and caused the animals to trip. We rose at one
time sufficiently high to obtain an extensive view, and had our
opinions confirmed as to the level nature of the country we were
so rapidly approaching. From the N. to the W.S.W. the eye
wandered over a wooded and unbroken interior, if I except a
solitary double hill that rose in the midst of <!--page 40 CHARACTER OF THE RIVER /page-->it, bearing S.
82° W. distant 12 miles, and another singular elevation that
bore S. 32° W. called by the natives, Kengal. The appearance to
the E.S.E. was still that of a mountainous country, while from
the N.E., the hills gradually decrease in height, until lost in
the darkness of surrounding objects to the northward. We did not
travel this day more than 13 miles on a W. by N. course. The
Morumbidgee, where we struck it, by its increased size, kept
alive our anticipations of its ultimately leading us to some
important point. The partial rains that had fallen while we were
on its upper branch, had swollen it considerably, and it now
rolled along a vast body of water at the rate of three miles an
hour, preserving a medium width of 150 feet; its banks retaining
a height far above the usual level of the stream. A traveller who
had never before descended into the interior of New Holland,
would have spurned the idea of such a river terminating in
marshes; but with the experience of the former journey, strong as
hope was within my breast, I still feared it might lose itself in
the vast flat upon which we could scarcely be said to have yet
entered. The country was indeed taking up more and more every day
the features of the N.W. interior. Cypresses were observed upon
the minor ridges, and the soil near the river, although still
rich, and certainly more extensive than above, was occasionally
mixed with sand, and scattered over with the claws of crayfish
and shells, indicating its greater liability to be flooded; nor
indeed could I entertain a doubt that the river had laid a great
part of the levels around us under water <!--page 41 AND THE ADJOINING COUNTRY. /page-->long after it found that
channel in which nature intended ultimately to confine it. We
killed another fine red kangaroo in the early part of the day, in
galloping after which I got a heavy fall. </p>

<p>The two blacks who had been with us so long, and who had not
only exerted themselves to assist us, but had contributed in no
small degree to our amusement, though they had from M'Leay's
liberality, tasted all the dainties with which we had provided
ourselves, from sugar to concentrated cayenne, intimated that
they could no longer accompany the party. They had probably got
to the extremity of their beat, and dared not venture any
further. They left us with evident regret, receiving, on their
departure, several valuable presents, in the shape of tomahawks
&amp;c. The last thing they did was to point out the way to us,
and to promise to join us on our return, although they evidently
little anticipated ever seeing us again. </p>

<p>In pursuing our journey, we entered a forest, consisting of
box-trees, casuarinae, and cypresses, on a light sandy soil, in
which both horses and bullocks sunk so deep that their labour was
greatly increased, more especially as the weather had become much
warmer. At noon I altered my course from N.W. by W. to W.N.W.,
and reached the Morumbidgee at 3 in the afternoon. The flats
bordering it were extensive and rich, and, being partially mixed
with sand, were more fitted for agricultural purposes than the
stiffer and purer soil amidst the mountains; but the interior
beyond them was far from being of corresponding quality. We <!--page 42 TRAVELLING DOWN THE RIVER. /page-->crossed
several plains on which vegetation was scanty, probably owing to
the hardness of the soil, which was a stiff loamy clay, and which
must check the growth of plants, by preventing the roots from
striking freely into it. The river where we stopped for the night
appeared to have risen considerably, and the fish were rolling
about on the surface of the water with a noise like porpoises. No
elevations were visible, so that I had not an opportunity of
continuing the chain of survey with the points I had previously
taken. </p>

<p>As we proceeded down the river on the 8th, the flats became
still more extensive than they had ever been, and might almost be
denominated plains. Vegetation was scanty upon them, although the
soil was of the first quality. About nine miles from our camp, we
struck on a small isolated hill, that could scarcely have been of
200 feet elevation; yet, depressed as it was, the view from its
summit was very extensive, and I was surprised to find that we
were still in some measure surrounded by high lands, of which I
took the following bearings, connected with the present ones.</p>

<table border="0">

        <td>A High Peak . . </td>

</table>

<p>To the north, there were several fires burning, which appeared
rather the fires of natives, than conflagrations, and as the
river had made a bend to the N.N.W., I doubted not that they were
upon its banks. From this hill, which was of compact granite, we
struck away to the W.N.W., and shortly afterwards crossed some
remarkable sand-hills. <!--page 43 TRAVELLING DOWN THE RIVER. /page-->Figuratively speaking, they appeared like
islands amidst the alluvial deposits, and were as pure in their
composition as the sand on the sea-shore. They were generally
covered with forest grass, in tufts, and a coarse kind of rushes,
under banksias and cypresses. We found a small fire on the banks
of the river, and close to it the couch and hut of a solitary
native, who had probably seen us approach, and had fled. There
cannot be many inhabitants hereabouts, since there are no paths
to indicate that they frequent this part of the Morumbidgee more
at one season than another. </p>

<p>On the 9th, the river fell off again to the westward, and we
lost a good deal of the northing we had made the day before. We
journeyed pretty nearly equidistant from the stream, and kept
altogether on the alluvial flats. As we were wandering along the
banks of the river, a black started up before us, and swam across
to the opposite side, where he immediately hid himself. We could
by no means induce him to show himself; he was probably the
lonely being whom we had scared away from the fire the day
before. In the afternoon, however we surprised a family of six
natives, and persuaded them to follow us to our halting place. My
boy understood them well; but the young savage had the cunning to
hide the information they gave him, or, for aught I know, to ask
questions that best suited his own purposes, and therefore we
gained little intelligence from them. </p>

<p>Every day now produced some change in the face of the country,
by which it became more and more assimilated to <!--page 44 TRAVELLING DOWN THE RIVER. /page-->that I had
traversed during the first expedition. Acacia pendula now made
its appearance on several plains beyond the river deposits, as
well as that salsolaceous class of plants, among which the
schlerolina and rhagodia are so remarkable. The natives left us
at sunset, but returned early in the morning with an extremely
facetious and good-humoured old man, who volunteered to act as
our guide without the least hesitation. There was a cheerfulness
in his manner, that gained our confidence at once, and rendered
him a general favourite. He went in front with the dogs, and led
us a little away from the river to kill kangaroos, as he said. At
about two miles we struck on an inconsiderable elevation, which
the party crossed at the S.W. extremity. I ascended it at the
opposite end, but although the view was extensive, I could not
make out the little hill of granite from which I had taken my
former bearings, and the only elevation I could recognise as
connected with them, was one about ten miles distant, bearing S.
168 W. I could observe very distant ranges to the E.N.E. and
immediately below me in that direction, there was a large clear
plain, skirted by acacia pendula, stretching from S.S.E. to
N.N.W. The crown and ridges of the hill on which I stood, were
barren, stony, and covered with beef-wood, the rock-formation
being a coarse granite. The drays had got so far ahead of me that
I did not overtake them before they had halted on the river at a
distance of ten miles. </p>

<p>The Morumbidgee appeared, on examination, to have increased in
breadth, and continued to rise gradually. It is <!--page 45 INFORMATION FROM A NATIVE. /page-->certainly a noble
stream, very different from those I had already traced to their
termination. The old black informed me that there was another
large river flowing to the southward of west, to which the
Morumbidgee was as a creek, and that we could gain it in four
days. He stated that its waters were good, but that its banks
were not peopled. That such a feature existed where he laid it
down, I thought extremely probable, because it was only natural
to expect that other streams descended from the mountains in the
S.E. of the island, as well as that on which we were travelling.
The question was, whether either of them held on an uninterrupted
course to some reservoir, or whether they fell short of the coast
and exhausted themselves in marshes. Considering the concave
direction of the mountains to the S.E., I even at this time hoped
that the rivers falling into the interior would unite sooner or
later, and contribute to the formation of an important and
navigable stream. Of the fate of the Morumbidgee, the old black
could give no account. It seemed probable, therefore, that we
were far from its termination. </p>

<p>I had hitherto been rather severe upon the animals, for
although our journey had not exceeded from twelve to fifteen
miles a day, it had been without intermission. I determined,
therefore, to give both men and animals a day of rest, as soon as
I should find a convenient place. We started on the 11th with
this intention, but we managed to creep over eight or ten miles
of ground before we halted. The country was slightly undulated,
and much intersected by creeks, few of which had water in them.
The whole <!--page 46 NATIVES&mdash;THEIR UGLINESS. /page-->tract was, however, well adapted either for
agriculture, or for grazing, and, in spite of the drought that
had evidently long hung over it, was well covered with
vegetation. We had passed all high lands, and the interior to the
westward presented an unbroken level to the eye. The Morumbidgee
appeared to hold a more northerly course than I had anticipated.
Still low ranges continued upon our right, and the cypress ridges
became more frequent and denser; but the timber on the more open
grounds generally consisted of box and flooded-gum. Of minor
trees, the acacia pendula was the most prevalent, with a shrub
bearing a round nut, enclosed in a scarlet capsule, and an
interesting species of stenochylus. I had observed as yet, few of
the plants of the more northern interior. </p>

<p>In this neighbourhood, the dogs killed an emu and a kangaroo,
which came in very conveniently for some natives whom we fell in
with on one of the river flats. They were, without exception, the
worst featured of any I had ever seen. It is scarcely possible to
conceive that human beings could be so hideous and loathsome. The
old black, who was rather good-looking, told me they were the
last we should see for some time, and I felt that if these were
samples of the natives on the lowlands, I cared very little how
few of I them we should meet.</p>

<h5>VIEW ON THE MORUMBIDGEE RIVER.</h5>

<p>The country on the opposite side of the river had all the
features of that to the north of it, but a plain of such extent
suddenly opened upon us to the southward, that I halted at once
in order to examine it, and by availing myself of a <!--page 47 EXTENSIVE PLAINS. /page-->day of rest,
to fix our position more truly than we could otherwise have done.
We accordingly pitched our tents under some lofty gum-trees,
opposite to the plain, and close upon the edge of the sandy beach
of the river. Before they were turned out, the animals were
carefully examined, and the pack-saddles overhauled, that they
might undergo any necessary repairs. The river fell considerably
during the night, but it poured along a vast body of water,
possessing a strong current. The only change I remarked in it was
that it now had a bed of sand, and was generally deeper on one
side than on the other. It kept a very uniform breadth of from
150 to 170 feet&mdash;and a depth of from 4 to 20. Its
channel, though occasionally much encumbered with fallen timber,
was large enough to contain twice the volume of water then in it,
but it had outer and more distant banks, the boundaries of the
alluvial flats, to confine it within certain limits, during the
most violent floods, and to prevent its inundating the country. </p>

<p>With a view to examine the plain opposite to us, I directed
our horses to be taken across the river early in the morning, and
after breakfast, M'Leay and I swam across after them. We found
the current strong, and could not keep a direct line over the
channel, but were carried below the place at which we plunged in.
We proceeded afterwards in a direction W.S.W. across the plain
for five or six miles, before we saw trees on the opposite
extremity, at a still greater distance. We thus found ourselves
in the centre of an area of from 26 to 30 miles. It appeared to
be <!--page 48 HAMILTON'S PLAINS. /page-->perfectly level, though not really so. The soil upon it was
good, excepting in isolated spots, where it was sandy. Vegetation
was scanty upon it, but, on the whole, I should conclude that it
was fitter for agriculture than for grazing. For I think it very
probable, that those lands which lie hardening and bare in a
state of nature, would produce abundantly if broken up by the
plough. I called this Hamilton's plains, in remembrance of the
surgeon of my regiment. The Morumbidgee forms its N.E. boundary,
and a creek rising on it, cuts off a third part on the western
side, and runs away from the river in a southerly direction. This
creek, even before it gets to the outskirts of the plains,
assumes a considerable size. Such a fact would argue that heavy
rains fall in this part of the interior, to cut out such a
watercourse, or that the soil is extremely loose; but I should
think the former the most probable, since the soil of this plain
had a substratum of clay. I place our encampment on the river in
latitude 34° 41´ 45´´ S., and in East longitude 146° 50´,
the variation of the compass being 6° 10´ E. </p>

<p>On our return to the camp we found several natives with our
people, and among them one of the tallest I had ever seen. Their
women were with them, and they appeared to have lost all
apprehension of any danger occurring from us. The animals were
benefited greatly by this day of rest. We left the plain,
therefore, on the 13th with renewed spirits, and passed over a
country very similar to that by which we had approached it, one
well adapted for grazing, but intersected by numerous creeks, at
two of which we <!--page 49 INTERCOURSE WITH THE NATIVES. /page-->found natives, some of whom joined our party. Our
old friend left us in quest of some blacks, who, as he informed
Hopkinson, had seen the tracks of our horses on the Darling. I
was truly puzzled at such a statement, which was, however,
further corroborated by the circumstance of one of the natives
having a tire-nail affixed to a spear, which he said was picked
up, by the man who gave it to him, on one of our encampments. I
could not think it likely that this story was true, and rather
imagined they must have picked up the nail near the located
districts, and I was anxious to have the point cleared up. When
we halted we had a large assemblage of natives with us, amounting
in all to twenty-seven, but I awaited in vain the return of the
old man. The night passed away without our seeing him, nor did he
again join us. </p>

<p>We started in the morning with our new acquaintances, and kept
on a south-westerly course during the day, over an excellent
grazing, and, in many places, an agricultural country, still
intersected by creeks, that were too deep for the water to have
dried in them. The country more remote from the river, however,
began to assume more and more the character and appearance of the
northern interior. I rode into several plains, the soil of which
was either a red sandy loam, bare of vegetation, or a rotten and
blistered earth, producing nothing but rhagodiae, salsolae, and
misembrianthemum. </p>

<p>We fell in with another tribe of blacks during the journey, to
whom we were literally consigned by those who had <!--page 50 SCANTINESS OF THE POPULATION. /page-->been previously
with us, and who now turned back, while our new friends took the
lead of the drays. They were two fine young men, but had very
ugly wives, and were for a long time extremely diffident. I found
that I could obtain but little information through my black
boy,&mdash;whether from his not understanding me, or because
he was too cunning, is uncertain. One of these young men,
however, clearly stated that he had seen the tracks of bullocks
and horses, a long time ago, to the N.N.W. in the direction of
some detached hills, that were visible from 20 to 25 miles
distant. He remembered them, he said, as a boy, and added that
the white men were without water. It was, therefore, clear that
he alluded to Mr. Oxley's excursion, northerly from the Lachlan,
and I had no doubt on my mind, that he had been on one of that
officer's encampments, and that the hills to the north of us were
those to the opposite base of which he had penetrated. I was
determined, therefore, if practicable, to reach these hills,
deeming it a matter of great importance to connect the surveys,
but I deferred my journey for a day or two, in hopes, from the
continued northerly course of the river, that we should have
approached them nearer. </p>

<p>In the evening we fell in with some more blacks, among whom
were two brothers, of those who were acting as our guides. One
had a very pretty girl as a wife, and all the four brothers were
very good-looking young men. There cannot, I should think, be a
numerous population on the banks of the Morumbidgee, from the
fact of our <!--page 51 CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY. /page-->having seen not more than fifty in an extent of more
than 180 miles. They are apparently scattered along it in
families. I was rather surprised that my boy understood their
language well, since it certainly differed from that of the
Macquarie tribes, but nevertheless as these people do not wander
far, our information as to what was before us was very gradually
arrived at, and only as we fell in with the successive families.
Moreover, as my boy was very young, it may be that he was more
eager in communicating to those who had no idea of them, the
wonders he had seen, than in making inquiries on points that were
indifferent to him. </p>

<p>We passed a very large plain in the course of the day, which
was bounded by forests of box, cypress, and the acacia pendula,
of red sandy soil and parched appearance. The Morumbidgee
evidently overflows a part of the lands we crossed, to a greater
extent than heretofore, though the alluvial deposits beyond its
influence were still both rich and extensive. The crested pigeon
made its appearance on the acacias, which I took to be a sure
sign of our approach to a country more than ordinarily subject to
overflow; since on the Macquarie and the Darling, those birds
were found only to inhabit the regions of marshes, or spaces
covered by the acacia pendula, or the polygonum. We had not,
however, yet seen any of the latter plant, although we were
shortly destined to be almost lost amidst fields of it. </p>

<p>We were now approaching that parallel of longitude in <!--page 52 CHANGE IN THE COUNTRY. /page-->which
the other known rivers of New Holland had been found to exhaust
themselves; the least change therefore, for the worse was
sufficient to raise my apprehensions; yet, although the
Morumbidgee had received no tributary from the Dumot downwards,
and was leading us into an apparently endless level, I saw no
indication of its decreasing in size, or in the rapidity of its
current. Certainly, however, I had, from the character of the
country around us, an anticipation that a change was about to
take place in it, and this anticipation was verified in the
course of the following day. The alluvial flats gradually
decreased in breadth, and we journeyed mostly over extensive and
barren plains, which in many places approached so near the river
as to form a part of its bank. They were covered with the
salsolaceous class of plants, so common in the interior, in a red
sandy soil, and were as even as a bowling green. The alluvial
spaces near the river became covered with reeds, and, though
subject to overflow at every partial rise of it, were so
extremely small as scarcely to afford food for our cattle.
Flooded-gum trees of lofty size grew on these reedy spaces, and
marked the line of the river, but the timber of the interior
appeared stunted and useless. </p>

<p>We found this part of the Morumbidgee much more populous than
its upper branches. When we halted, we had no fewer than
forty-one natives with us, of whom the young men were the least
numerous. They allowed us to choose a place for ourselves before
they formed their own camp, and studiously avoided encroaching on
our ground so as <!--page 53 DESCRIPTION OF THE NATIVES. /page-->to appear troublesome. Their manners were those
of a quiet and inoffensive people, and their appearance in some
measure prepossessing. The old men had lofty foreheads, and stood
exceedingly erect. The young men were cleaner is their persons
and were better featured than any we had seen, some of them
having smooth hair and an almost Asiatic cast of countenance. On
the other hand, the women and children were disgusting objects.
The latter were much subject to diseases, and were dreadfully
emaciated. It is evident that numbers of them die in their
infancy for want of care and nourishment. We remarked none at the
age of incipient puberty, but the most of them under six. In
stating that the men were more prepossessing than any we had
seen, I would not be understood to mean that they differed in any
material point either from the natives of the coast, or of the
most distant interior to which I had been, for they were
decidedly the same race, and had the same leading features and
customs, as far as the latter could be observed. The sunken eye
and overhanging eyebrow, the high cheek-bone and thick lip,
distended nostrils, the nose either short or acquiline, together
with a stout bust and slender extremities, and both curled and
smooth hair, marked the natives of the Morumbidgee as well as
those of the Darling. They were evidently sprung from one common
stock, the savage and scattered inhabitants of a rude and
inhospitable land. In customs they differed in no material point
from the coast natives, and still less from the tribes on the
Darling and the Castlereagh. They ex<!--page 54 MANNERS AND CUSTOMS /page-->tract the front tooth,
lacerate their bodies, to raise the flesh, cicatrices being their
chief ornament; procure food by the same means, paint in the same
manner, and use the same weapons, as far as the productions of
the country will allow them. But as the grass-tree is not found
westward of the mountains, they make a light spear of a reed,
similar to that of which the natives of the southern islands form
their arrows. These they use for distant combat, and not only
carry in numbers, but throw with the boomerang to a great
distance and with unerring precision, making them to all intents
and purposes as efficient as the bow and arrow. They have a
ponderous spear for close fight, and others of different sizes
for the chase. With regard to their laws, I believe they are
universally the same all over the known parts of New South Wales.
The old men have alone the privilege of eating the emu; and so
submissive are the young men to this regulation, that if, from
absolute hunger or under other pressing circumstances, one of
them breaks through it, either during a hunting excursion, or
whilst absent from his tribe, he returns under a feeling of
conscious guilt, and by his manner betrays his guilt, sitting
apart from the men, and confessing his misdemeanour to the chief
at the first interrogation, upon which he is obliged to undergo a
slight punishment. This evidently is a law of policy and
necessity, for if the emus were allowed to be indiscriminately
slaughtered, they would soon become extinct. Civilized nations
may learn a wholesome lesson even from savages, as in this
instance of their forebearance. For <!--page 55 OF THE NATIVES. /page-->somewhat similar reasons,
perhaps, married people alone are here permitted to eat ducks.
They hold their corrobories, (midnight ceremonies), and sing the
same melancholy ditty that breaks the stillness of night on the
shores of Jervis' Bay, or on the banks of the Macquarie; and
during the ceremony imitate the several birds and beasts with
which they are acquainted. If these inland tribes differ in
anything from those on the coast, it is in the mode of burying
their dead, and, partially, in their language. Like all savages,
they consider their women as secondary objects, oblige them to
procure their own food, or throw to them over their shoulders the
bones they have already picked, with a nonchalance that is
extremely amusing; and, on the march, make them beasts of burden
to carry their very weapons. The population of the Morumbidgee,
as far as we had descended it at this time, did not exceed from
ninety to a hundred souls. I am persuaded that disease and
accidents consign many of them to a premature grave. </p>

<p>From this camp, one family only accompanied us. We journeyed
due west over plains of great extent. The soil upon them was soft
and yielding, in some places being a kind of light earth covered
with rhagodiae, in others a red tenacious clay, overrun by the
misembrianthemum and salsolae. Nothing could exceed the apparent
barrenness of these plains, or the cheerlessness of the
landscape. We had left all high lands behind us, and were now on
an extensive plain, bounded in the distance by low trees or by
dark lines of cypresses. The lofty gum-trees on the river <!--page 56 MIRAGE. /page-->followed
its windings, and, as we opened the points, they appeared, from
the peculiar effect of a mirage, as bold promontories jutting
into the ocean, having literally the blue tint of distance. This
mirage floated in a light tremulous vapour on the ground, and not
only deceived us with regard to the extent of the plains, and the
appearance of objects, but hid the trees, in fact, from our view
altogether; so that, in moving, as we imagined, upon the very
point or angle of the river, we found as we neared it, that the
trees stretched much further into the plain, and were obliged to
alter our course to round them. The heated state of the
atmosphere, and the sandy nature of the country could alone have
caused a mirage so striking in its effects, as
this,&mdash;exceeding considerably similar appearances noticed
during the first expedition. The travelling was so heavy, that I
was obliged to make a short day's journey, and when we struck the
river for the purpose of halting, it had fallen off very much in
appearance, and was evidently much contracted, with low banks and
a sandy bed. It was difficult to account for this sudden change,
but when I gazed on the extent of level country before me, I
began to dread that this hitherto beautiful stream would
ultimately disappoint us. </p>

<p>I had deferred my intended excursion to the hills under which
I imagined Mr. Oxley had encamped, until we were out of sight of
them, and I now feared that it was almost too late to undertake
it, but I was still anxious to determine a point in which I felt
considerable interest. I was the more desirous of surveying the
country <!--page 57 EXCURSION TOWARDS A RIDGE OF HILLS. /page-->to the northward, because of the apparent eagerness with
which the natives had caught at the word Colare, which I
recollected having heard a black on the Macquarie make use of in
speaking of the Lachlan. They pointed to the N.N.W., and making a
sweep with the arm raised towards the sky, seemed to intimate
that a large sheet of water existed in that direction; and added
that it communicated with the Morumbidgee more to the westward.
This information confirmed still more my impressions with regard
to Mr. Oxley's line of route; and, as I found a ready volunteer
in M'Leay, I gave the party in charge to Harris until I should
rejoin him, and turned back towards the hills, with the intention
of reaching them if possible. No doubt we should have done so had
it not been for the nature of the ground over which we travelled,
and the impossibility of our exceeding a walk. We rode to a
distance of 18 miles, but still found ourselves far short of the
hills, and therefore gave up the point. I considered, however,
that we were about the same distance to the south, as Mr. Oxley
had been to the north of them, and in taking bearings of the
highest points, I afterwards found that they exactly tallied with
his bearings, supposing him to have taken them from his camp. </p>

<p>On our way to the river, we Passed through some dense bushes
of casuarinae and cypresses, to the outskirts of the plains
through which the Morumbidgee winds. We reached the camp two or
three hours after sunset, and found it crowded with natives to
the number of 60. They were extremely quiet and inoffensive in
their demeanour, <!--page 58 QUIET DEMEANOUR OF THE NATIVES. /page-->and asked us to point out where they might
sleep, before they ventured to kindle their fires. One old man,
we remarked, had a club foot, and another was blind, but, as far
as we could judge from the glare of the fires, the generality of
them were fine young men, and supported themselves in a very
erect posture when standing or walking. There were many children
with the women, among whom colds seemed to prevail. It blew
heavily from the N.W. during the night, and a little rain fell in
the early part of the morning. Our route during the day, was over
as melancholy a tract as ever was travelled. The plains to the N.
and N.W. bounded the horizon; not a tree of any kind was visible
upon them. It was equally open to the S., and it appeared as if
the river was decoying us into a desert, there to leave us in
difficulty and in distress. The very mirage had the effect of
boundlessness in it, by blending objects in one general hue; or,
playing on the ground, it cheated us with an appearance of water,
and on arriving at the spot, we found a continuation of the same
scorching plain, over which we were moving, instead of the stream
we had hoped for. </p>

<p>The cattle about this time began to suffer, and, anxious as I
was to push on, I was obliged to shorten my journeys, according
to circumstances. Amidst the desolation around us, the river kept
alive our hopes. If it traversed deserts, it might reach fertile
lands, and it was to the issue of the journey that we had to look
for success. It here, however, evidently overflowed its banks
more extensively than heretofore, and <!--page 59 DREARINESS OF THE LANDSCAPE. /page-->broad belts of reeds were
visible on either side of it, on which the animals exclusively
subsisted. Most of the natives had followed us, and their
patience and abstinence surprised me exceedingly. Some of them
had been more than twenty-four hours without food, and yet seemed
as little disposed to seek it as ever. I really thought they
expected me to supply their wants, but as I could not act so
liberal a scale, George M'Leay undeceived them; after which they
betook themselves to the river, and got a supply of muscles. I
rather think their going so frequently into the water engenders a
catarrh, or renders them more liable to it than they otherwise
would be. In the afternoon the wind shifted to the S.W. It blew a
hurricane; and the temperature of the air was extremely low. The
natives felt the cold beyond belief and kindled large fires. In
the morning, when we moved away, the most of them started with
fire-sticks to keep themselves warm; but they dropped off one by
one, and at noon we found ourselves totally deserted. </p>

<p>It is impossible for me to describe the kind of country we
were now traversing, or the dreariness of the view it presented.
The plains were still open to the horizon, but here and there a
stunted gum-tree, or a gloomy cypress, seemed placed by nature as
mourners over the surrounding desolation. Neither beast nor bird
inhabited these lonely and inhospitable regions, over which the
silence of the grave seemed to reign. We had not, for days past,
seen a blade of grass, so that the animals could not have been in
<!--page 60 THE BLACK BOY DESERTS. /page-->very good condition. We pushed on, however, sixteen miles, in
consequence of the coolness of the weather. We observed little
change in the river in that distance, excepting that it had taken
up a muddy bottom, and lost all the sand that used to fill it.
The soil and productions on the plains continued unchanged in
every respect. From this time to the 22nd, the country presented
the same aspect. Occasional groups of cypress showed themselves
on narrow sandy ridges, or partial brushes extended from the
river, consisting chiefly of the acacia pendula, the stenochylus,
and the nut I have already noticed. The soil on which they grew
was, if possible, worse than that of the barren plain which we
were traversing; and their colour and drooping state rendered the
desolate landscape still more dreary. </p>

<p>On the 21st, we found the same singular substance* <span class="note">[Gypsum.
See Plate.]</span> embedded in the bank of the river that had been
collected, during the former expedition, on the banks of the
Darling; and hope, which is always uppermost in the human breast,
induced me to think that we were fast approaching that stream. My
observations placed me in 34° 17´ 15´´ S. and 145° of E.
longitude. </p>

<p>On the 22nd, my black boy deserted me. I was not surprised at
his doing so, neither did I regret his loss, for he had been of
little use under any circumstances. He was far too cunning for
our purpose. I know not that the term ingratitude can be applied
to one in his situation, and in <!--page 61 COUNTRY SUBJECT TO INUNDATION. /page-->whose bosom nature had implanted
a love of freedom. We learnt from four blacks, with whom he had
spoken, and who came to us in the afternoon, that he had gone up
the river,&mdash;as I conjectured, to the last large tribe we
had left, with whom he appeared to become very intimate. </p>

<p>A creek coming from the N.N.W. here fell into the Morumbidgee;
a proof that the general decline of country was really to the
south, although a person looking over it would have supposed the
contrary. </p>

<p>We started on the 23rd, with the same boundlessness of plain
on either side of us; but in the course of the morning a change
took place, both in soil and productions; and from the red sandy
loam, and salsolaceous plants, amidst which we had been toiling,
we got upon a light tenacious and blistered soil, evidently
subject to frequent overflow, and fields of polygonum junceum,
amidst which, both the crested pigeon and the black quail were
numerous. The drays and animals sank so deep in this, that we
were obliged to make for the river, and keep upon its immediate
banks. Still, with all the appearance of far-spread inundation,
it continued undiminished in size, and apparently in the strength
of its current. Its channel was deeper than near the mountains,
but its breadth was about the same. </p>

<p>On the 24th, we were again entangled amidst fields of
polygonum, through which we laboured until after eleven, when we
gained a firmer soil. Some cypresses appeared upon our right, in
a dark line, and I indulged hopes that a change was about to take
place in the nature of the coun<!--page 62 INTERCOURSE WITH NATIVES /page-->try. We soon, however, got on a
light rotten earth, and were again obliged to make for the river,
with the teams completely exhausted. We had not travelled many
miles from our last camp, yet it struck me, that the river had
fallen off in appearance. I examined it with feelings of intense
anxiety, certain, as I was, that the flooded spaces, over which
we had been travelling would, sooner or later, be succeeded by a
country overgrown with reeds. The river evidently overflowed its
banks, on both sides, for many miles, nor had I a doubt that, at
some periods, the space northward, between it and the Lachlan,
presented the appearance of one vast sea. The flats of polygonum
stretched away to the N.W. to an amazing distance, as well as in
a southerly direction, and the very nature of the soil bore
testimony to its flooded origin. But the most unaccountable
circumstance to me was, that it should be entirely destitute of
vegetation, with the exception of the gloomy and leafless bramble
I have noticed. </p>

<p>M'Leay, who was always indefatigable in his pursuit after
subjects of natural history, shot a cockatoo, of a new species,
hereabouts, having a singularly shaped upper mandible. It was
white, with scarlet down under the neck feathers, smaller than
the common cockatoo, and remarkable for other peculiarities. </p>

<p>Two or three natives made their appearance at some distance
from the party, but would not approach it until after we had
halted. They then came to the tents, seven in number, and it was
evident from their manner, that their <!--page 63 THE COLARE OR LACHLAN. /page-->chief or only object was to
pilfer anything they could. We did not, therefore, treat them
with much ceremony. They were an ill-featured race, and it was
only by strict watching during the night that they were prevented
from committing theft. Probably from seeing that we were aware of
their intentions, they left us early, and pointing somewhat to
the eastward of north, said they were going to the Colare, and on
being asked how far it was, they signified that they should sleep
there. I had on a former occasion recollected the term having
been made use of by a black, on the Macquarie, when speaking to
me of the Lachlan, and had questioned one of the young men who
was with us at the time, and who seemed more intelligent than his
companions, respecting it. Immediately catching at the word, he
had pointed to the N.N.W., and, making a sweep with his arms
raised towards the sky had intimated, evidently, that a large
sheet of water existed in that direction, in the same manner that
another black had done on a former occasion: on being further
questioned, he stated that this communicated with the Morumbidgee
more to the westward, and on my expressing a desire to go to it,
he said we could not do so under four days. We had, it appeared,
by the account of the seven natives, approached within one day's
journey of it, and, as I thought it would be advisable to gain a
little knowledge of the country to the north, I suggested to
M'Leay to ride in that direction, while the party should be at
rest, with some good feed for the cattle that fortune had pointed
out to us. <!--page 64 EXCURSION TOWARDS THE LACHLAN. /page--> </p>

<p>Our horses literally sank up to their knees on parts of the
great plain over which we had in the first instance to pass, and
we rode from three to four miles before we caught sight of a
distant wood at its northern extremity; the view from the river
having been for the last two or three days, as boundless as the
ocean. As we approached the wood, two columns of smoke rose from
it, considerably apart, evidently the fires of natives near
water. We made for the central space between them, having a dead
acacia scrub upon our right. On entering the wood, we found that
it contained for the most part, flooded-gum, under which
bulrushes and reeds were mixed together. The whole space seemed
liable to overflow, and we crossed numerous little drains, that
intersected each other in every direction. From the resemblance
of the ground to that at the bottom of the marshes of the
Macquarie, I prognosticated to my companion that we should
shortly come upon a creek, and we had not ridden a quarter of a
mile further, when we found ourselves on the banks of one of
considerable size. Crossing it, we proceeded northerly, until we
got on the outskirts of a plain of red sandy soil, covered with
rhagodia alone, and without a tree upon the visible horizon. The
country appeared to be rising before us, but was extremely
depressed to the eastward. After continuing along this plain for
some time, I became convinced from appearances, that we were
receding from water, and that the fires of the natives, which
were no longer visible, must have been on the creek we had
crossed, that I judged to be leading W.S.W. from the op<!--page 65 CONNECTION OF LACHLAN WITH MORUMBIDGEE. /page-->posite
quarter. We had undoubtedly struck below to the westward of the
Colare or Lachlan, and the creek was the channel of communication
between it and the Morumbidgee, at least such was the natural
conclusion at which I arrived. Having no further object in
continuing a northerly course, we turned to the S.E., and, after
again passing the creek, struck away for the camp on a S. by W.
course, and passed through a dense brush of cypress and casuarina
in our way to it. </p>

<p>Considering our situation as connected with the marshes of the
Lachlan, I cannot but infer that the creek we struck upon during
this excursion serves as a drain to the latter, to conduct its
superfluous waters into the Morumbidgee in times of flood, as
those of the Macquarie are conducted by the creek at the
termination of its marshes into Morrisset's Chain of Ponds. It
will be understood that I only surmise this. I argue from
analogy, not from proof. Whether I am correct or not, my
knowledge of the facts I have stated, tended very much to satisfy
my mind as to the <i>lay</i> of the interior; and to revive my
hopes that the Morumbidgee would not fail us, although there was
no appearance of the country improving. </p>

<p>We started on the 26th, on a course somewhat to the N.W., and
traversed plains of the same wearisome description as those I
have already described. The wheels of the drays sank up to their
axle-trees, and the horses above their fetlocks at every step.
The fields of polygonum spread on every side of us like a dark
sea, and the only green object within range of our vision was the
river line of trees. <!--page 66 COUNTRY COVERED WITH REEDS. /page-->In several instances, the force of both
teams was put to one dray, to extricate it from the bed into
which it had sunk, and the labour was considerably increased from
the nature of the weather. The wind was blowing as if through a
furnace, from the N.N.E., and the dust was flying in clouds, so
as to render it almost suffocating to remain exposed to it. This
was the only occasion upon which we felt the hot winds in the
interior. We were, about noon, endeavouring to gain a point of a
wood at which I expected to come upon the river again, but it was
impossible for the teams to reach it without assistance. I
therefore sent M'Leay forward, with orders to unload the pack
animals as soon as he should make the river, and send them back
to help the teams. He had scarcely been separated from me 20
minutes, when one of the men came galloping back to inform me
that no river was to be found&mdash;that the country beyond
the wood was covered with reeds as far as the eye could reach,
and that Mr. M'Leay had sent him back for instructions. This
intelligence stunned me for a moment or two, and I am sure its
effect upon the men was very great. They had unexpectedly arrived
at a part of the interior similar to one they had held in dread,
and conjured up a thousand difficulties and privations. I desired
the man to recall Mr. M'Leay; and, after gaining the wood, moved
outside of it at right angles to my former course, and reached
the river, after a day of severe toil and exposure, at half-past
five. The country, indeed, bore every resemblance to that around
the marshes of the Macquarie, but I was too weary to make any
further <!--page 67 ANXIOUS COGITATIONS. /page-->effort: indeed it was too late for me undertake anything
until the morning. </p>

<p>The circumstances in which we were so unexpectedly placed,
occupied my mind so fully that I could not sleep; and I awaited
the return of light with the utmost anxiety. If we were indeed on
the outskirts of marshes similar to those I had on a former
occasion found so much difficulty in examining, I foresaw that in
endeavouring to move round then I should recede from water, and
place the expedition in jeopardy, probably, without gaining any
determinate point, as it would be necessary for me to advance
slowly and with caution. Our provisions, however, being
calculated to last only to a certain period, I was equally
reluctant to delay our operations. My course was, therefore, to
be regulated by the appearance of the country and of the river,
which I purposed examining with the earliest dawn. If the latter
should be found to run into a region of reeds, a boat would be
necessary to enable me to ascertain its direction; but, if
ultimately it should be discovered to exhaust itself, we should
have to strike into the interior on a N.W. course, in search of
the Darling. I could not think of putting the whale-boat together
in our then state of uncertainty, and it struck me that a smaller
one could sooner be prepared for the purposes for which I should
require it. These considerations, together with the view I had
taken of the measures I might at last be forced into, determined
me, on rising, to order Clayton to fell a suitable tree, and to
prepare a saw-pit. The labour <!--page 68 SURVEY OF RIVER AND ENVIRONS. /page-->was of no consideration, and even
if eventually the boat should not be wanted, no injury would
arise, and it was better to take time by the forelock. Having
marked a tree preparatory to leaving the camp, M'Leay and I
started at an early hour on an excursion of deeper interest than
any we had as yet undertaken; to examine the reeds, not only for
the purpose of ascertaining their extent, if possible, but also
to guide us in our future measures. We rode for some miles along
the river side, but observed in it no signs, either of increase
or of exhaustion. Its waters, though turbid, were deep, and its
current still rapid. Its banks, too, were lofty, and showed no
evidence of decreasing in height, so as to occasion an overflow
of them, as had been the case with the Macquarie. We got among
vast bodies of reeds, but the plains of the interior were visible
beyond them. We were evidently in a hollow, and the decline of
country was plainly to the southward of west. Every thing tended
to strengthen my conviction that we were still far from the
termination of the river. The character it had borne throughout,
and its appearance now so far to the westward, gave me the most
lively hopes that it would make good its way through the vast
level into which it fell, and that its termination would accord
with its promise. Besides, I daily anticipated its junction with
some stream of equal, if not of greater magnitude from the S.E. I
was aware that my resolves must be instant, decisive, and
immediately acted upon, as on firmness and promptitude at this
crisis the success of the expedition depended. About noon I
checked my horse, <!--page 69 BOAT BUILDING. /page-->and rather to the surprise of my companion,
intimated to him my intention of returning to the camp, He
naturally asked what I purposed doing. I told him it appeared to
me more than probable that the Morumbidgee would hold good its
course to some fixed point, now that it had reached a meridian
beyond the known rivers of the interior. It was certain, from the
denseness of the reeds, and the breadth of the belts, that the
teams could not be brought any farther, and that, taking every
thing into consideration, I had resolved on a bold and desperate
measure, that of building the whale-boat, and sending home the
drays. Our appearance in camp so suddenly, surprised the men not
more than the orders I gave. They all thought I had struck on
some remarkable change of country, and were anxious to know my
ultimate views. It was not my intention however, immediately to
satisfy their curiosity. I had to study their characters as long
as I could, in order to select those best qualified to accompany
me on the desperate adventure for which I was preparing. </p>

<p>The attention both of M'Leay, and myself, was turned to the
hasty building of the whale-boat. A shed was erected, and every
necessary preparation made, and although Clayton had the keel of
the small boat already laid down, and some planks prepared, she
was abandoned for the present, and, after four days more of
arduous labour, the whale-boat was painted and in the water. From
her dimensions, it appeared to me impossible that she would hold
all our provisions and stores, for her after-part <!--page 70 COMPLETION OF ARRANGEMENTS /page-->had been fitted
up as an armoury, which took away considerably from her capacity
of stowage. The small boat would still, therefore, be necessary,
and she was accordingly re-laid, for half the dimensions of the
large boat, and in three days was alongside her consort in the
river. Thus, in seven days we had put together a boat,
twenty-seven feet in length, had felled a tree from the forest,
with which we had built a second of half the size, had painted
both, and had them at a temporary wharf ready for loading. Such
would not have been the case had not our hearts been in the work,
as the weather was close and sultry, and we found it a task of
extreme labour. In the intervals between the hours of work, I
prepared my despatches for the Governor, and when they were
closed, it only remained for me to select six hands, the number I
intended should accompany me down the river, and to load the
boats, ere we should once more proceed in the further obedience
of our instructions. </p>

<p>It was impossible that I could do without Clayton, whose
perseverance and industry had mainly contributed to the building
of the boats; of the other prisoners, I chose Mulholland and
Macnamee; leaving the rest in charge of Robert Harris, whose
steady conduct had merited my approbation. My servant, Harris,
Hopkinson, and Fraser, of course, made up the crews. The boats
were loaded in the evening of Jan. 6th, as it had been necessary
to give the paint a little time to dry. On the 4th, I had sent
Clayton and Mulholland to the nearest cypress range for a mast <!--page 71 FOR EMBARKATION. /page-->and
spar, and on the evening of that day some blacks had visited us;
but they sat on the bank of the river, preserving a most
determined silence; and, at length, left us abruptly, and
apparently in great ill humour. In the disposition of the loads,
I placed all the flour, the tea, and tobacco, in the whaleboat.
The meat-casks, still, and carpenters' tools, were put into the
small boat. </p>

<p>As soon as the different arrangements were completed, I
collected the men, and told off those who were to accompany me. I
then gave the rest over in charge to Harris, and, in adverting to
their regular conduct hitherto, trusted they would be equally
careful while under his orders. I then directed the last
remaining sheep to be equally divided among us; and it was
determined that, for fear of accidents, Harris should remain
stationary for a week, at the expiration of which time, he would
be at liberty to proceed to Goulburn Plains, there to receive his
instructions from Sydney; while the boats were to proceed at an
early hour of the morning down the river,&mdash;whether ever
to return again being a point of the greatest uncertainty.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The camp was a scene of bustle and confusion long before
day-light. The men whom I had selected to accompany me were in
high spirits, and so eager to commence their labours that they
had been unable to sleep, but busied themselves from the earliest
dawn in packing up their various articles of clothing, &amp;c. We
were prevented from taking our departure so early as I had
intended, by rain that fell about six. At a little after seven,
however, the weather cleared up, the morning mists blew over our
heads, and the sun struck upon us with his usual fervour. As soon
as the minor things were stowed away, we bade adieu to Harris and
his party; and shortly after, em<!--page 73 SUPPOSED JUNCTION OF LACHLAN. /page-->barked on the bosom of that
stream along the banks of which we had journeyed for so many
miles </p>

<p>Notwithstanding that we only used two oars, our progress down
the river was rapid. Hopkinson had arranged the loads so well,
that all the party could sit at their ease, and Fraser was posted
in the bow of the boat, with gun in hand, to fire at any new bird
or beast that we might surprise in our silent progress. The
little boat, which I shall henceforward call the skiff, was
fastened by a painter to our stern. </p>

<p>As the reader will have collected from what has already fallen
under his notice, the country near the depot was extensively
covered with reeds, beyond which vast plains of polygonum
stretched away. From the bed of the river we could not observe
the change that took place in it as we passed along, so that we
found it necessary to land, from time to time, for the purpose of
noting down its general appearance. At about fifteen miles from
the depot, we came upon a large creek-junction from the N.E.,
which I did not doubt to be the one M'Leay and I had crossed on
the 25th of December. It was much larger than the creek of the
Macquarie, and was capable of holding a very great body of water,
although evidently too small to contain all that occasionally
rushed from its source. I laid it down as the supposed junction
of the Lachlan, since I could not, against the corroborating
facts in my possession, doubt its originating in the marshes of
that river. Should this, eventually, prove to be the case, the
similar termination of the <!--page 74 EMUS&mdash;NATIVE TOMB. /page-->two streams traced by Mr. Oxley will
be a singular feature in the geography of the interior. </p>

<p>We were just about to land, to prepare our dinner, when two
emus swam across the river ahead of us. This was an additional
inducement for us to land, but we were unfortunately too slow,
and the birds escaped us. We had rushed in to the right bank, and
found on ascending it, that the reeds with which it had hitherto
been lined, had partially ceased. A large plain, similar to those
over which we had wandered prior to our gaining the flooded
region, stretched away to a considerable distance behind us, and
was backed by cypresses and brush. The soil of the plain was a
red sandy loam, covered sparingly with salsolae and shrubs; thus
indicating that the country still preserved its barren character,
and that it is the same from north to south. Among the shrubs we
found a tomb that appeared to have been recently constructed. No
mound had been raised over the body, but an oval hollow shed
occupied the centre of the burial place, that was lined with
reeds and bound together with strong net-work. Round this, the
usual walks were cut, and the recent traces of women's feet were
visible upon them, but we saw no natives, although, from the
number and size of the paths that led from the river, in various
directions across the plain, I was led to conclude, that, at
certain seasons, it is hereabouts numerously frequented. Fraser
gathered some rushes similar to those used by the natives of the
Darling in the fabrication of their nets, and as they had not
before been observed, we judged them, of course, to be a sign of
our near approach to that river. <!--page 75 ASPECT OF COUNTRY AND RIVER. /page--> </p>

<p>As soon as we had taken a hasty dinner, we again embarked, and
pursued our journey. I had hoped, from the appearance of the
country to the north of us, although that to the south gave
little indication of any change, that we should soon clear the
reeds; but at somewhat less than a mile they closed in upon the
river, and our frequent examination of the neighbourhood on
either side of it only tended to confirm the fact, that we were
passing through a country subject to great and extensive
inundation. We pulled up at half-past five, and could scarcely
find space enough to pitch our tents. </p>

<p>The Morumbidgee kept a decidedly westerly course during the
day. Its channel was not so tortuous as we expected to have found
it, nor did it offer any obstruction to the passage of the boats.
Its banks kept a general height of eight feet, five of which were
of alluvial soil, and both its depth and its current were
considerable. We calculated having proceeded from 28 to 30 miles,
though, perhaps, not more than half that distance in a direct
line. No rain fell during the day, but we experienced some heavy
squalls from the E.S.E. </p>

<p>The second day of our journey from the depot was marked by an
accident that had well nigh obliged us to abandon the further
pursuit of the river, by depriving us of part of our means of
carrying it into effect. We had proceeded, as usual, at an early
hour in the morning, and not long after we started, fell in with
the blacks who had visited us last, and who were now in much
better humour than upon <!--page 76 THE SKIFF STRIKES AND SINKS. /page-->that occasion. As they had their women
with them, we pushed in to the bank, and distributed some
presents, after which we dropped quietly down the river. Its
general depth had been such as to offer few obstructions to our
progress, but about an hour after we left the natives, the skiff
struck upon a sunken log, and immediately filling, went down in
about twelve feet of water, The length of the painter prevented
any strain upon the whale-boat, but the consequence of so serious
an accident at once flashed upon our minds. That we should suffer
considerably, we could not doubt, but our object was to get the
skiff up with the least possible delay, to prevent the fresh
water from mixing with the brine, in the casks of meat. Some
short time, however, necessarily elapsed before we could effect
this, and when at last the skiff was hauled ashore, we found that
we were too late to prevent the mischief that we had anticipated.
All the things had been fastened in the boat, but either from the
shock, or the force of the current, one of the pork casks, the
head of the still, and the greater part of the carpenter's tools,
had been thrown out of her. As the success of the expedition
might probably depend upon the complete state of the still, I
determined to use every effort for its recovery: but I was truly
at a loss how to find it; for the waters of the river were
extremely turbid. In this dilemma, the blacks would have been of
the most essential service, but they were far behind us, so that
we had to depend on our own exertions alone. I directed the
whale-boat to be moored over the place where the accident had
happened, <!--page 77 LABOUR IN RECOVERING ARTICLES LOST. /page-->and then used the oars on either side of her, to feel
along the bottom of the river, in hopes that by these means we
should strike upon the articles we had lost. However unlikely
such a measure was to prove successful, we recovered in the
course of the afternoon, every thing but the still-head, and a
cask of paint. Whenever the oar struck against the substance that
appeared, by its sound or feel to belong to us, it was
immediately pushed into the sand, and the upper end of the oar
being held by two men, another descended by it to the bottom of
the river, remaining under water as long as he could, to
ascertain what was immediately within arm's length of him. This
work was, as may be imagined, most laborious, and the men at
length became much exhausted. They would not, however, give up
the search for the still head, more especially after M'Leay, in
diving, had descended upon it. Had he, by ascertaining his
position, left it to us to heave it up, our labours would soon
have ended; but, in his anxiety for its recovery, he tried to
bring it up, when finding it too heavy, he let it go, and the
current again swept it away. </p>

<p>At sunset. we were obliged to relinquish our task, the men
complaining of violent head-aches, which the nature of the day
increased. Thinking our own efforts would be unavailing, I
directed two of the men to go up the river for the blacks, at
day-light in the morning, and set the reeds on fire to attract
their notice. The day had been cloudy and sultry in the
afternoon, the clouds collecting in the N.E.: we heard the
distant thunder, and expected to have <!--page 78 PILFERING OF NATIVES. /page-->been deluged with rain.
None, however, fell, although we were anxious for moisture to
change the oppressive state of the atmosphere. The fire I had
kindled raged behind us, and threw dense columns of smoke into
the sky, that cast over the landscape a shade of the most dismal
gloom. We were not in a humour to admire the picturesque, but
soon betook ourselves to rest, and after such a day of labour as
that we had undergone, I dispensed with the night guard. </p>

<p>In the morning we resumed our search for the still head, which
Hopkinson at length fortunately struck with his oar. It had been
swept considerably below the place at which M'Leay had dived, or
we should most probably have found it sooner. With its recovery,
all our fatigues were at once forgotten, and I ordered the
breakfast to be got ready preparatory to our reloading the skiff.
Fraser and Mulholland, who had left the camp at daylight, had not
yet returned. I was sitting in the tent, when Macnamee came to
inform me that one of the frying-pans was missing, which had been
in use the evening previous, for that he himself had placed it on
the stump of a tree, and he therefore supposed a native dog had
run away with it. Soon after this, another loss was reported to
me, and it was at last discovered that an extensive robbery had
been committed upon us during the night, and that, in addition to
the frying-pan, three cutlasses, and five tomahawks, with the pea
of the steelyards, had been carried away. I was extremely
surprised at this instance of daring in the natives, and
determined, if possible, <!--page 79 CONTINUE OUR VOYAGE. /page-->to punish it. About ten, Fraser and
Mulholland returned with two blacks. Fraser told me he saw
several natives on our side of the river, as he was returning, to
whom those who were with him spoke, and I felt convinced from
their manner and hesitation, that they were aware of the trick
that had been played upon us. However, as Fraser had promised
them a tomahawk to induce them to accompany him, I fulfilled the
promise. </p>

<p>Leaving this unlucky spot, we made good about sixteen miles
during the afternoon. The river maintained its breadth and depth
nor were the reeds continuous upon its banks. We passed several
plains that were considerably elevated above the alluvial
deposits, and the general appearance of the country induced me
strongly to hope that we should shortly get out of the region of
reeds, or the great flooded concavity on which we had fixed our
depot; but the sameness of vegetation, and the seemingly
diminutive size of the timber in the distance, argued against any
change for the better in the soil of the interior. Having taken
the precaution of shortening the painter of the skiff, we found
less difficulty in steering her clear of obstacles, and made
rapid progress down the Morumbidgee during the first cool and
refreshing hours of the morning. The channel of the river became
somewhat less contracted, but still retained sufficient depth for
larger boats than ours, and preserved a general westerly course.
Although no decline of country was visible to the eye, the
current in places ran very strong. It is impossible for me to
convey to the reader's mind an idea of the nature <!--page 80 CONTRACTION OF THE CHANNEL. /page-->of the country
through which we passed. On this day the favourable appearances,
noticed yesterday, ceased almost as soon as we embarked. On the
10th, reeds lined the banks of the river on both sides, without
any break, and waved like gloomy streamers over its turbid
waters; while the trees stood leafless and sapless in the midst
of them. Wherever we landed, the same view presented
itself&mdash;a waving expanse of reeds, and a country as flat
as it is possible to imagine one. The eye could seldom penetrate
beyond three quarters of a mile, and the labour of walking
through the reeds was immense; but within our observation all was
green and cheerless. The morning had been extremely cold, with a
thick haze at E.S.E. About 2 p.m. it came on to rain heavily, so
that we did not stir after that hour. </p>

<p>I had remarked that the Morumbidgee was not, from the depot
downwards, so broad or so fine a river as it certainly is at the
foot of the mountain ranges, where it gains the level country.
The observations of the last two days had impressed upon my mind
an idea that it was rapidly falling off, and I began to dread
that it would finally terminate in one of those fatal marshes in
which the Macquarie and the Lachlan exhaust themselves. My hope
of a more favourable issue was considerably damped by the general
appearance of the surrounding country; and from the circumstance
of our not having as yet passed a single tributary. As we
proceeded down the river, its channel gradually contracted, and
immense trees that had been swept down it by floods, rendered the
navigation dangerous and intricate. Its waters became so <!--page 81 ANOTHER ACCIDENT. /page-->turbid,
that it was impossible to see objects in it, notwithstanding the
utmost diligence on the part of the men. </p>

<p>About noon, we fell in with a large tribe of natives, but had
great difficulty in bringing them to visit us. If they had <i>heard</i>
of white men, we were evidently the first they had ever <i>seen</i>.
They approached us in the most cautious manner, and were unable
to subdue their fears as long as they remained with us.
Collectively, these people could not have amounted to less than
one hundred and twenty in number. </p>

<p>As we pushed off from the bank, after having stayed with them
about half an hour, the whaleboat struck with such violence on a
sunken log, that she immediately leaked on her starboard side.
Fortunately she was going slowly at the time, or she would most
probably have received some more serious injury. One of the men
was employed during the remainder of the afternoon in bailing her
out, and we stopped sooner than we should otherwise have done, in
order to ascertain the extent of damage, and to repair it. The
reeds terminated on both sides of the river some time before we
pulled up, and the country round the camp was more elevated than
usual, and bore the appearance of open forest pasture land, the
timber upon it being a dwarf species of box, and the soil a light
tenacious earth. </p>

<p>About a mile below our encampment of the 12th, we at length
came upon a considerable creek-junction from the S.E. Below it,
the river increased both in breadth and depth; banks were lofty
and perpendicular, and even the lowest levels were but partially
covered with reeds. We met with fewer <!--page 82 ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY, /page-->obstructions in
consequence, and pursued our journey with restored confidence.
Towards evening a great change also took place in the aspect of
the country, which no longer bore general marks of inundation.
The level of the interior was broken by a small hill to the right
of the stream, but the view from its summit rather damped than
encouraged my hopes of any improvement. The country was covered
with wood and brush, and the line of the horizon was unbroken by
the least swell. We were on an apparently boundless flat, without
any fixed point on which to direct our movements, nor was there a
single object for the eye to rest upon, beyond the dark and
gloomy wood that surrounded us on every side. </p>

<p>Soon after passing this hill, the whale-boat struck upon a
line of sunken rocks, but fortunately escaped without injury.
Mulholland, who was standing in the bow, was thrown out of her,
head foremost, and got a good soaking, but soon recovered
himself. The composition of the rock was iron-stone, and it is
the first formation that occurs westward of the dividing range.
We noticed a few cypresses in the distance, but the general
timber was dwarf-box, or flooded-gum, and a few of the acacia
longa scattered at great distances. In verifying our position by
some lunars, we found ourselves in 142° 46´ 30´´ of east
long., and in lat. 35° 25´ 15´´ S. the mean variation of the
compass being 4° 10´´ E. it appearing that we were decreasing
the variation as we proceeded westward. </p>

<p>On the 13th, we passed the first running stream that joins the
Morumbidgee, in a course of more than 340 miles. <!--page 83 AND OF THE RIVER. /page-->It came from the
S.E., and made a visible impression on the river at the junction,
although in tracing it up, it appeared to be insignificant in
itself. The circumstance of these tributaries all occurring on
the left, evidenced the level nature of the country to the north.
In the afternoon, we passed a dry creek also from the S.E. which
must at times throw a vast supply of water into the river, since
for many miles below, the latter preserved a breadth of 200 feet,
and averaged from 12 to 20 feet in depth, with banks of from 15
to 18 feet in height. Yet, notwithstanding its general equality
of depth, several rapids occurred, down which the boats were
hurried with great velocity. The body of water in the river
continued undiminished, notwithstanding its increased breadth of
channel; for which reason I should imagine that it is fed by
springs, independently of other supplies. Some few cypresses were
again observed, and the character of the distant country
resembled, in every particular, that of the interior between the
Macquarie and the Darling. The general appearance of the
Morumbidgee, from the moment of our starting on the 13th, to a
late hour in the afternoon, had been such as to encourage my
hopes of ultimate success in tracing it down; but about three
o'clock we came to one of those unaccountable and mortifying
changes which had already so frequently excited my apprehension.
Its channel again suddenly contracted, and became almost blocked
up with huge trees, that must have found their way into it down
the creeks or junctions we had lately passed. The rapidity of the
current increasing at the same <!--page 84 DANGEROUS NAVIGATION /page-->time, rendered the navigation
perplexing and dangerous. We passed reach after reach, presenting
the same difficulties, and were at length obliged to pull up at 5
p.m., having a scene of confusion and danger before us that I did
not dare to encounter with the evening's light; for I had not
only observed that the men's eye-sight failed them as the sun
descended, and that they mistook shadows for objects under water,
and <i>vice versa</i>, but the channel had become so narrow that,
although the banks were not of increased height, we were involved
in comparative darkness, under a close arch of trees, and a
danger was hardly seen ere we were hurried past it, almost
without the possibility of avoiding it. The reach at the head of
which we stopped, was crowded with the trunks of trees, the
branches of which crossed each other in every direction, nor
could I hope, after a minute examination of the channel, to
succeed in taking the boats safely down so intricate a passage. </p>

<p>We rose in the morning with feelings of apprehension, and
uncertainty; and, indeed, with great doubts on our minds whether
we were not thus early destined to witness the wreck, and the
defeat of the expedition. The men got slowly and cautiously into
the boat, and placed themselves so as to leave no part of her
undefended. Hopkinson stood at the bow, ready with poles to turn
her head from anything upon which she might be drifting. Thus
prepared, we allowed her to go with the stream. By extreme care
and attention on the part of the men we passed this formidable
barrier. Hopkinson in particular exerted himself, and more <!--page 85 OF THE MORUMBIDGEE. /page-->than
once leapt from the boat upon apparently rotten logs of wood,
that I should not have judged capable of bearing his weight, the
more effectually to save the boat. It might have been imagined
that where such a quantity of timber had accumulated, a clearer
channel would have been found below, but such was not the case.
In every reach we had to encounter fresh difficulties. In some
places huge trees lay athwart the stream, under whose arched
branches we were obliged to pass; but, generally speaking, they
had been carried, roots foremost, by the current, and, therefore,
presented so many points to receive us, that, at the rate at
which we were going, had we struck full upon any one of them, it
would have gone through and through the boat. About noon we
stopped to repair, or rather to take down the remains of our
awning, which had been torn away; and to breathe a moment from
the state of apprehension and anxiety in which our minds had been
kept during the morning. About one, we again started. The men
looked anxiously out ahead; for the singular change in the river
had impressed on them an idea, that we were approaching its
termination, or near some adventure. On a sudden, the river took
a general southern direction, but, in its tortuous course, swept
round to every point of the compass with the greatest
irregularity. We were carried at a fearful rate down its gloomy
and contracted banks, and, in such a moment of excitement, had
little time to pay attention to the country through which we were
passing. It was, however, observed, that chalybeate-springs were
numerous close to the water's <!--page 86 JUNCTION OF A LARGE RIVER. /page-->edge. At 3 p.m., Hopkinson called
out that we were approaching a junction, and in less than a
minute afterwards, we were hurried into a broad and noble river. </p>

<p>It is impossible for me to describe the effect of so
instantaneous a change of circumstances upon us. The boats were
allowed to drift along at pleasure, and such was the force with
which we had been shot out of the Morumbidgee, that we were
carried nearly to the bank opposite its embouchure, whilst we
continued to gaze in silent astonishment on the capacious channel
we had entered; and when we looked for that by which we had been
led into it, we could hardly believe that the insignificant gap
that presented itself to us was, indeed, the termination of the
beautiful and noble stream, whose course we had thus successfully
followed. I can only compare the relief we experienced to that
which the seaman feels on weathering the rock upon which he
expected his vessel would have struck&mdash;to the calm which
succeeds moments of feverish anxiety, when the dread of danger is
succeeded by the certainty of escape. </p>

<p>To myself personally, the discovery of this river was a
circumstance of a particularly gratifying nature, since it not
only confirmed the justness of my opinion as to the ultimate fate
of the Morumbidgee, and bore me out in the apparently rash and
hasty step I had taken at the depot, but assured me of ultimate
success in the duty I had to perform. We had got on the high
road, as it were, either to the south coast, or to some important
outlet; and the appearance of the river itself was such as to
justify our most sanguine <!--page 87 CHARACTER OF THE RIVER. /page-->expectations. I could not doubt its
being the great channel of the streams from the S.E. angle of the
island. Mr. Hume had mentioned to me that he crossed three very
considerable streams, when employed with Mr. Hovell in 1823 in
penetrating towards Port Phillips, to which the names of the
Goulburn, the Hume, and the Ovens, had been given; and as I was
300 miles from the track these gentlemen had pursued, I
considered it more than probable that those rivers must already
have formed a junction above me, more especially when I reflected
that the convexity of the mountains to the S.E. would necessarily
direct the waters falling inwards from them to a common centre. </p>

<p>We entered the new river at right angles, and, as I have
remarked, at the point of junction the channel of the Morumbidgee
had narrowed so as to bear all the appearance of an ordinary
creek. In breadth it did not exceed fifty feet, and if, instead
of having passed down it, I had been making my way up the
principal streams, I should little have dreamt that so dark and
gloomy an outlet concealed a river that would lead me to the
haunts of civilized man, and whose fountains rose amidst
snow-clad mountains. Such, however, is the characteristic of the
streams falling to the westward of the coast ranges. Descending
into a low and level interior, and depending on their immediate
springs for existence, they fall off, as they increase their
distance from the base of the mountains in which they rise, and
in their lower branches give little results of the promise they
had previously made. <!--page 88 ABSENCE OF NATIVES. /page--> </p>

<p>The opinion I have expressed, and which is founded on my
personal experience, that the rivers crossed by Messrs. Hovell
and Hume had already united above me, was strengthened by the
capacity of the stream we had just discovered. It had a medium
width of 350 feet, with a depth of from twelve to twenty. Its
reaches were from half to three-quarters of a mile in length, and
the views upon it were splendid. Of course, as the Morumbidgee
entered it from the north, its first reach must have been E. and
W., and it was so, as nearly as possible; but it took us a little
to the southward of the latter point, in a distance of about
eight miles that we pulled down it in the course of the
afternoon. We then landed and pitched our tents for the night.
Its transparent waters were running over a sandy bed at the rate
of two-and-a-half knots an hour, and its banks, although
averaging eighteen feet in height, were evidently subject to
floods. </p>

<p>We had not seen any natives since falling in with the last
tribe on the Morumbidgee. A cessation had, therefore, taken place
in our communication with them, in re-establishing which I
anticipated considerable difficulty. It appeared singular that we
should not have fallen in with any for several successive days,
more especially at the junction of the two rivers, as in similar
situations they generally have an establishment. In examining the
country back from the stream, I did not observe any large paths,
but it was evident that fires had made extensive ravages in the
neighbourhood, so that the country was, perhaps, only tem<!--page 89 WEATHER, TEMPERATURE, &amp;c. /page-->porarily
deserted. Macnamee, who had wandered a little from the tents,
declared that he had seen about a dozen natives round a fire,
from whom (if he really did see them) he very precipitately fled,
but I was inclined to discredit his story, because in our journey
on the following day, we did not see even a casual wanderer. </p>

<p>The river maintained its character, and raised our hopes to
the highest pitch. Its breadth varied from 160 to 200 yards; and
only in one place, where a reef of iron-stone stretched nearly
across from the left bank, so as to contract the channel near the
right and to form a considerable rapid, was there any apparent
obstruction to our navigation. I was sorry, however, to remark
that the breadth of alluvial soil between its outer and inner
banks was very inconsiderable, and that the upper levels were
poor and sandy. Blue-gum generally occupied the former, while the
usual productions of the plains still predominated upon the
latter, and showed that the distant interior had not yet
undergone any favourable change. We experienced strong breezes
from the north, but the range of the thermometer was high, and
the weather rather oppressive than otherwise. On the night of the
16th, we had a strong wind from the N.W., but it moderated with
day-light, and shifted to the E.N.E., and the day was favourable
and cool. Our progress was in every way satisfactory, and if any
change had taken place in the river, it was that the banks had
increased in height, in many places to thirty feet, the soil
being a red loam, and the surface much above the reach of <!--page 90 INTERCOURSE WITH NATIVES. /page-->floods.
The bank opposite to the one that was so elevated, was
proportionably low, and, in general, not only heavily timbered,
but covered with reeds, and backed by a chain of ponds at the
base of the outer embankment. </p>

<p>About 4 p.m., some natives were observed running by the river
side behind us, but on our turning the boat's head towards the
shore, they ran away. It was evident that they had no idea what
we were, and, from their timidity, feeling assured that it would
be impossible to bring them to a parley, we continued onwards
till our usual hour of stopping, when we pitched our tents on the
left bank for the night, it being the one opposite to that on
which the natives had appeared. We conjectured that their
curiosity would lead them to follow us, which they very shortly
did; for we had scarcely made ourselves comfortable when we heard
their wild notes through the woods as they advanced towards the
river; and their breaking into view with their spears and
shields, and painted and prepared as they were for battle, was
extremely fine. They stood threatening us, and making a great
noise, for a considerable time, but, finding that we took no
notice of them, they, at length, became quiet. I then walked to
some little distance from the party, and taking a branch in my
hand, as a sign of peace, beckoned them to swim to our side of
the river, which, after some time, two or three of them did. But
they approached me with great caution, hesitating at every step.
They soon, however, gained confidence, and were ultimately joined
by all the males of <!--page 91 INTERCOURSE WITH NATIVES. /page-->their tribe. I gave the <i>first</i> who swam
the river a tomahawk (making this a rule in order to encourage
them) with which he was highly delighted. I shortly afterwards
placed them all in a row and fired a gun before them: they were
quite unprepared for such an explosion, and after standing
stupified and motionless for a moment or two, they simultaneously
took to their heels, to our great amusement. I succeeded,
however, in calling them back, and they regained their confidence
so much, that sixteen of them remained with us all night, but the
greater number retired at sunset. </p>

<p>On the following morning, they accompanied us down the river,
where we fell in with their tribe, who were stationed on an
elevated bank a short distance below&mdash;to the number of
eighty-three men, women, and children. Their appearance was
extremely picturesque and singular. They wanted us to land, but
time was too precious for such delays. Some of the boldest of the
natives swam round and round the boat so as to impede the use of
the oars, and the women on the bank evinced their astonishment by
mingled yells and cries. They entreated us, by signs, to remain
with them, but, as I foresaw a compliance on this occasion would
hereafter be attended with inconvenience, I thought it better to
proceed on our journey, and the natives soon ceased their
importunities, and, indeed, did not follow or molest us. </p>

<p>The river improved upon us at every mile. Its reaches were of
noble breadth, and splendid appearance. Its cur<!--page 92 ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY, /page-->rent was stronger,
and it was fed by numerous springs. Rocks, however, were more
frequent in its bed, and in two places almost formed a barrier
across the channel, leaving but a narrow space for the boats to
go down. We passed several elevations of from 70 to 90 feet in
height, at the base of which the stream swept along. The soil of
these elevations was a mixture of clay (marl) and sand, upon
coarse sandstone. Their appearance and the manner in which they
had been acted upon by water, was singular, and afforded a proof
of the violence of the rains in this part of the interior. From
the highest of these, I observed that the country to the S.E. was
gently undulated, and so far changed in character from that
through which we had been travelling; still, however, it was
covered with a low scrub, and was barren and unpromising. </p>

<p>About noon of the 18th, we surprised two women at the
water-side, who immediately retreated into the brush. Shortly
after, four men showed themselves, and followed us for a short
distance, but hid themselves upon our landing. The country still
appeared undulated to the S.E.; the soil was sandy, and cypresses
more abundant than any other tree. We passed several extensive
sand-banks in the river, of unusual size and solidity, an evident
proof of the sandy nature of the interior generally. The vast
accumulations of sand at the junctions of every creek were
particularly remarkable. The timber on the alluvial flats was not
by any means so large as we had hitherto observed it; nor were
the flats themselves so extensive as they are on the Morum<!--page 93 AND OF THE RIVER BANKS. /page-->bidgee
and the Macquarie. Notwithstanding the aspect of the country
which I have described, no <i>positive</i> change had as yet
taken place in the general feature of the interior. The river
continued to flow in a direction somewhat to the northward of
west, through a country that underwent no perceptible alteration.
Its waters, confined to their immediate bed, swept along
considerably below the level of its inner banks; and the spaces
between them and the outer ones, though generally covered with
reeds, seemed not recently to have been flooded; while on the
other hand, they had, in many places, from successive
depositions, risen to a height far above the reach of inundation.
Still, however, the more remote interior maintained its sandy and
sterile character, and stretched away, in alternate plain and
wood, to a distance far beyond the limits of our examination. </p>

<p>About the 21st, a very evident change took place in it. The
banks of the river suddenly acquired a perpendicular and
water-worn appearance. Their summits were perfectly level, and no
longer confined by a secondary embankment, but preserved an
uniform equality of surface back from the stream. These banks,
although so abrupt, were not so high as the upper levels, or
secondary embankments. They indicated a deep alluvial deposit,
and yet, being high above the reach of any ordinary flood, were
covered with grass, under an open box forest, into which a
moderately dense scrub occasionally penetrated. We had fallen
into a concavity similar to those of the marshes, but successive
depositions had almost filled it, and no longer subject to in<!--page 94 THREATENED ATTACK. /page-->undation,
it had lost all the character of those flooded tracts. The kind
of country I have been describing, lay rather to the right than
to the left of the river at this place, the latter continuing low
and swampy, as if the country to the south of the river were
still subject to inundation. As the expedition proceeded, the
left bank gradually assumed the appearance of the right; both
looked water-worn and perpendicular, and though not more than
from nine to ten feet in height, their summits were perfectly
level in receding, and bore diminutive box-timber, with
widely-scattered vegetation. Not a single elevation had, as yet,
broken the dark and gloomy monotony of the interior; but as our
observations were limited to a short distance from the river, our
surmises on the nature of the distant country were necessarily
involved in some uncertainty. </p>

<p>On the 19th, as we were about to conclude our journey for the
day, we saw a large body of natives before us. On approaching
them, they showed every disposition for combat, and ran along the
bank with spears in rests, as if only waiting for an opportunity
to throw them at us. They were upon the right, and as the river
was broad enough to enable me to steer wide of them, I did not
care much for their threats; but upon another party appearing
upon the left bank, I thought it high time to disperse one or the
other of them, as the channel was not wide enough to enable me to
keep clear of danger, if assailed by both, as I might be while
keeping amid the channel. I found, however, that they did not
know how to use the advantage they <!--page 95 AMICABLE CONFERENCE. /page-->possessed, as the two
divisions formed a junction; those on the left swimming over to
the stronger body upon the right bank. This, fortunately,
prevented the necessity of any hostile measure on my part, and we
were suffered to proceed unmolested, for the present. The whole
then followed us without any symptom of fear, but making a
dreadful shouting, and beating their spears and shields together,
by way of intimidation. It is but justice to my men to say that
in this critical situation they evinced the greatest coolness,
though it was impossible for any one to witness such a scene with
indifference. As I did not intend to fatigue the men by
continuing to pull farther than we were in the habit of doing, we
landed at our usual time on the left bank, and while the people
were pitching the tents, I walked down the bank with M'Leay, to
treat with these desperadoes in the best way we could, across the
water, a measure to which my men showed great reluctance,
declaring that if during our absence the natives approached them,
they would undoubtedly fire upon them. I assured them it was not
my intention to go out of their sight. We took our guns with us,
but determined not to use them until the last extremity, both
from a reluctance to shed blood and with a view to our future
security. I held a long pantomimical dialogue with them, across
the water, and held out the olive branch in token of amity. They
at length laid aside their spears, and a long consultation took
place among them, which ended in two or three wading into the
river, contrary, as it appeared, to the earnest remonstrances of
the majority, who, <!--page 96 APPEARANCE OF THE NATIVES. /page-->finding that their entreaties had no effect,
wept aloud, and followed them with a determination, I am sure, of
sharing their fate, whatever it might have been. As soon as they
landed, M'Leay and I retired to a little distance from the bank,
and sat down; that being the usual way among the natives of the
interior, to invite to an interview. When they saw us act thus,
they approached, and sat down by us, but without looking up, from
a kind of diffidence peculiar to them, and which exists even
among the nearest relatives, as I have already had occasion to
observe. As they gained confidence, however, they showed an
excessive curiosity, and stared at us in the most earnest manner.
We now led them to the camp, and I gave, as was my custom, the
first who had approached, a tomahawk; and to the others, some
pieces of iron hoop. Those who had crossed the river amounted to
about thirty-five in number. At sunset, the majority of them left
us; but three old men remained at the fire-side all night. I
observed that few of them had either lost their front teeth or
lacerated their bodies, as the more westerly tribes do. The most
loathsome diseases prevailed among them. Several were disabled by
leprosy, or some similar disorder, and two or three had entirely
lost their sight. They are, undoubtedly, a brave and a confiding
people, and are by no means wanting in natural affection. In
person, they resemble the mountain tribes. They had the thick
lip, the sunken eye, the extended nostril, and long beards, and
both smooth and curly hair are common among them. Their lower
extremities appear to <!--page 97 INTERCOURSE WITH NATIVES. /page-->bear no proportion to their bust in point
of muscular strength; but the facility with which they ascend
trees of the largest growth, and the activity with which they
move upon all occasions, together with their singularly erect
stature, argue that such appearance is entirely deceptive. </p>

<p>The old men slept very soundly by the fire, and were the last
to get up in the morning. M'Leay's extreme good humour had made a
most favourable impression upon them, and I can picture him, even
now, joining in their wild song. Whether it was from his entering
so readily into their mirth, or from anything peculiar that
struck them, the impression upon the whole of us was, that they
took him to have been originally a black, in consequence of which
they gave him the name of Rundi. Certain it is, they pressed him
to show his side, and asked if he had not received a wound
there&mdash;evidently as if the original Rundi had met with a
violent death from a spear-wound in that place. The whole tribe,
amounting in number to upwards of 150, assembled to see us take
our departure. Four of them accompanied us, among whom there was
one remarkable for personal strength and stature.&mdash;The
21st passed without our falling in with any new tribe, and the
night of the 22nd, saw us still wandering in that lonely desert
together. There was something unusual in our going through such
an extent of country without meeting another tribe, but our
companions appeared to be perfectly aware of the absence of
inhabitants, as they never left our side. </p>

<p>Although the banks of the river had been of general <!--page 98 RAPID IN THE RIVER. /page-->equality
of height, sandy elevations still occasionally formed a part of
them, and their summits were considerably higher than the
alluvial flats. </p>

<p>It was upon the crest of one of these steep and lofty banks,
that on the morning of the 22nd, the natives who were a-head of
the boat, suddenly stopped to watch our proceedings down a
foaming rapid that ran beneath. We were not aware of the danger
to which we were approaching, until we turned an angle of the
river, and found ourselves too near to retreat. In such a moment,
without knowing what was before them, the coolness of the men was
strikingly exemplified. No one even spoke after they became aware
that silence was necessary. The natives (probably anticipating
misfortune) stood leaning upon their spears upon the lofty bank
above us. Desiring the men not to move from their seats, I stood
up to survey the channel, and to steer the boat to that part of
it which was least impeded by rocks. I was obliged to decide upon
a hasty survey, as we were already at the head of the rapid. It
appeared to me that there were two passages, the one down the
centre of the river, the other immediately under its right bank.
A considerable rock stood directly in own way to the latter, so
that I had no alternative but to descend the former. About forty
yards below the rock, I noticed that a line of rocks occupied the
space between the two channels, whilst a reef, projecting from
the left bank, made the central passage distinctly visible, and
the rapidity of the current proportionably great. I entertained
hopes that the passage was <!--page 99 DANGEROUS DESCENT OF THE BOATS. /page-->clear, and that we should shoot down
it without interruption; but in this I was disappointed. The boat
struck with the fore-part of her keel on a sunken rock, and,
swinging round as it were on a pivot, presented her bow to the
rapid, while the skiff floated away into the strength of it. We
had every reason to anticipate the loss of our whale-boat, whose
build was so light, that had her side struck the rock, instead of
her keel, she would have been laid open from stem to stern. As it
was, however, she remained fixed in her position, and it only
remained for us to get her off the best way we could. I saw that
this could only be done by sending two of the men with a rope to
the upper rock, and getting the boat, by that means, into the
still water, between that and the lower one. We should then have
time to examine the channels, and to decide as to that down which
it would be safest to proceed. My only fear was, that the loss of
the weight of the two men would lighten the boat so much, that
she would be precipitated down the rapid without my having any
command over her; but it happened otherwise. We succeeded in
getting her into the still water, and ultimately took her down
the channel under the right bank, without her sustaining any
injury. A few miles below this rapid the river took a singular
bend, and we found, after pulling several miles, that we were
within a stone's throw of a part of the stream we had already
sailed down. </p>

<p>The four natives joined us in the camp, and assisted the men
at their various occupations. The consequence was, <!--page 100 DESERTED NATIVE VILLAGE. /page-->that they were
treated with more than ordinary kindness; and Fraser, for his
part, in order to gratify these favoured guests, made great havoc
among the feathered race. He returned after a short ramble with a
variety of game, among which were a crow, a kite, and a laughing
jackass (alcedo gigantea,) a species of king's-fisher, a singular
bird, found in every part of Australia. Its cry, which resembles
a chorus of wild spirits, is apt to startle the traveller who may
be in jeopardy, as if laughing and mocking at his misfortune. It
is a harmless bird, and I seldom allowed them to be destroyed, as
they were sure to rouse us with the earliest dawn. To this list
of Fraser's spoils, a duck and a tough old cockatoo, must be
added. The whole of these our friends threw on the fire without
the delay of plucking, and snatched them from that consuming
element ere they were well singed, and devoured them with
uncommon relish. </p>

<p>We pitched our tents upon a flat of good and tenacious soil. A
brush, in which there was a new species of melaleuca, backed it,
in the thickest part of which we found a deserted native village.
The spot was evidently chosen for shelter. The huts were large
and long, all facing the same point of the compass, and in every
way resembling the huts occupied by the natives of the Darling.
Large flocks of whistling ducks, and other wild fowl, flew over
our heads to the N.W., as if making their way to some large or
favourite waters. My observations placed us in lat. 34° 8´
15´´ south, and in east long. 141° 9´ 42´´ or nearly so;
and I was <!--page 101 CONVERSING BY SIGNS. /page-->at a loss to conceive what direction the river would
ultimately take. We were considerably to the N.W. of the point at
which we had entered it, and in referring to the chart, it
appeared, that if the Darling had kept a S.W. course from where
the last expedition left its banks, we ought ere this to have
struck upon it, or have arrived at its junction with the stream
on which we were journeying. </p>

<p>The natives, in attempting to answer my interrogatories, only
perplexed me more and more. They evidently wished to explain
something, by placing a number of sticks across each other as a
kind of diagram of the country. It was, however, impossible to
arrive at their meaning. They undoubtedly pointed to the
westward, or rather to the south of that point, as the future
course of the river; but there was something more that they were
anxious to explain, which I could not comprehend. The poor
fellows seemed quite disappointed, and endeavoured to beat it
into Fraser's head with as little success. I then desired
Macnamee to get up into a tree. From the upper branches of it he
said he could see hills; but his account of their appearance was
such that I doubted his story: nevertheless it might have been
correct. He certainly called our attention to a large fire, as if
the country to the N.W. was in flames, so that it appeared we
were approaching the haunts of the natives at last. </p>

<p>It happened that Fraser and Harris were for guard, and they
sat up laughing and talking with the natives long after we
retired to rest. Fraser, to beguile the hours, proposed shaving
his sable companions, and performed that opera<!--page 102 LARGE CONCOURSE OF NATIVES. /page-->tion with admirable
dexterity upon their chief, to his great delight. I got up at an
early hour, and found to my surprise that the whole of them had
deserted us. Harris told me they had risen from the fire about an
hour before, and had crossed the river. I was a little angry, but
supposed they were aware that we were near some tribe, and had
gone on a-head to prepare and collect them. </p>

<p>After breakfast, we proceeded onwards as usual. The river had
increased so much in width that, the wind being fair, I hoisted
sail for the first time, to save the strength of my men as much
as possible. Our progress was consequently rapid. We passed
through a country that, from the nature of its soil and other
circumstances, appeared to be intersected by creeks and lagoons.
Vast flights of wild fowl passed over us, but always at a
considerable elevation, while, on the other hand, the paucity of
ducks on the river excited our surprise. Latterly, the trees upon
the river, and in its neighbourhood, had been a tortuous kind of
box. The flooded-gum grew in groups on the spaces subject to
inundation, but not on the levels above the influence of any
ordinary rise of the stream. Still they were much smaller than
they were observed to be in the higher branches of the river. We
had proceeded about nine miles, when we were surprised by the
appearance in view, at the termination of a reach, of a long line
of magnificent trees of green and dense foliage. As we sailed
down the reach, we observed a vast concourse of natives under
them, and, on a nearer approach, we not only heard their
war-song, if <!--page 103 THEIR HOSTILE DEMEANOUR. /page-->it might so be called, but remarked that they were
painted and armed, as they generally are, prior to their engaging
in deadly conflict. Notwithstanding these outward signs of
hostility, fancying that our four friends were with them, I
continued to steer directly in for the bank on which they were
collected. I found, however, when it was almost too late to turn
into the succeeding reach to our left, that an attempt to land
would only be attended with loss of life. The natives seemed
determined to resist it. We approached so near that they held
their spears quivering in their grasp ready to hurl. They were
painted in various ways. Some who had marked their ribs, and
thighs, and faces with a white pigment, looked like skeletons,
others were daubed over with red and yellow ochre, and their
bodies shone with the grease with which they had besmeared
themselves. A dead silence prevailed among the front ranks, but
those in the back ground, as well as the women, who carried
supplies of darts, and who appeared to have had a bucket of
whitewash capsized over their heads, were extremely clamorous. As
I did not wish a conflict with these people, I lowered my sail,
and putting the helm to starboard, we passed quietly down the
stream in mid channel. Disappointed in their anticipations, the
natives ran along the bank of the river, endeavouring to secure
an aim at us; but, unable to throw with certainty, in consequence
of the onward motion of the boat, they flung themselves into the
most extravagant attitudes, and worked themselves into a state of
frenzy by loud and vehement shouting. <!--page 104 PREPARATIONS FOR CONFLICT. /page--> </p>

<p>It was with considerable apprehension that I observed the
river to be shoaling fast, more especially as a huge sand-bank, a
little below us, and on the same side on which the natives had
gathered, projected nearly a third-way across the channel. To
this sand-bank they ran with tumultuous uproar, and covered it
over in a dense mass. Some of the chiefs advanced to the water to
be nearer their victims, and turned from time to time to direct
their followers. With every pacific disposition, and an extreme
reluctance to take away life, I foresaw that it would be
impossible any longer to avoid an engagement, yet with such
fearful numbers against us, I was doubtful of the result. The
spectacle we had witnessed had been one of the most appalling
kind, and sufficient to shake the firmness of most men; but at
that trying moment my little band preserved their temper
coolness, and if any thing could be gleaned from their
countenances, it was that they had determined on an obstinate
resistance. I now explained to them that their only chance of
escape depended, or would depend, on their firmness. I desired
that after the first volley had been fired, M'Leay and three of
the men, would attend to the defence of the boat with bayonets
only, while I, Hopkinson, and Harris, would keep up the fire as
being more used to it. I ordered, however, that no shot was to be
fired until after I had discharged both my barrels. I then
delivered their arms to the men, which had as yet been kept in
the place appropriated for them, and at the same time some rounds
of loose cartridge. The men assured me they would follow my
instruc<!--page 105 UNEXPECTED INTERFERENCE. /page-->tions, and thus prepared, having already lowered the sail,
we drifted onwards with the current. As we neared the sand-bank,
I stood up and made signs to the natives to desist; but without
success. I took up my gun, therefore, and cocking it, had already
brought it down to a level. A few seconds more would have closed
the life of the nearest of the savages. The distance was too
trifling for me to doubt the fatal effects of the discharge; for
I was determined to take deadly aim, in hopes that the fall of
one man might save the lives of many. But at the very moment,
when my hand was on the trigger, and my eye was along the barrel,
my purpose was checked by M'Leay, who called to me that another
party of blacks had made their appearance upon the left bank of
the river. Turning round, I observed four men at the top of their
speed. The foremost of them as soon as he got a-head of the boat,
threw himself from a considerable height into the water. He
struggled across the channel to the sand-bank, and in an
incredibly short space of time stood in front of the savage,
against whom my aim had been directed. Seizing him by the throat,
he pushed backwards, and forcing all who were in the water upon
the bank, he trod its margin with a vehemence and an agitation
that were exceedingly striking. At one moment pointing to the
boat, at another shaking his clenched hand in the faces of the
most forward, and stamping with passion on the sand; his voice,
that was at first distinct and clear, was lost in hoarse murmurs.
Two of the four natives remained on the left bank of the river,
but <!--page 106 JUNCTION OF ANOTHER STREAM. /page-->the third followed his leader, (who proved to be the
remarkable savage I have previously noticed) to the scene of
action. The reader will imagine our feelings on this occasion: it
is impossible to describe them. We were so wholly lost in
interest at the scene that was passing, that the boat was allowed
to drift at pleasure. For my own part I was overwhelmed with
astonishment, and in truth stunned and confused; so singular, so
unexpected, and so strikingly providential, had been our escape.</p>

<h5>JUNCTION OF THE SUPPOSED DARLING WITH THE MURRAY.</h5>

<p>We were again roused to action by the boat suddenly striking
upon a shoal, which reached from one side of the river to the
other. To jump out and push her into deeper water was but the
work of a moment with the men, and it was just as she floated
again that our attention was withdrawn to a new and beautiful
stream, coming apparently from the north. The great body of the
natives having posted themselves on the narrow tongue of land
formed by the two rivers, the bold savage who had so
unhesitatingly interfered on our account, was still in hot
dispute with them, and I really feared his generous warmth would
have brought down upon him the vengeance of the tribes. I
hesitated, therefore, whether or not to go to his assistance. It
appeared, however, both to M'Leay and myself, that the tone of
the natives had moderated, and the old and young men having
listened to the remonstrances of our friend, the middle-aged
warriors were alone holding out against him. A party of about
seventy blacks were upon the right bank of the newly discovered
river, and I thought that by land<!--page 107 PROVIDENTIAL DELIVERANCE FROM DANGER. /page-->ing among them, we should make a
diversion in favour of our late guest; and in this I succeeded.
If even they had still meditated violence, they would have to
swim a good broad junction, and that, probably, would cool them,
or we at least should have the advantage of position. I
therefore, ran the boat ashore, and landed with M'Leay amidst the
smaller party of natives, wholly unarmed, and having directed the
men to keep at a little distance from the bank. Fortunately, what
I anticipated was brought about by the stratagem to which I had
had recourse. The blacks no sooner observed that we had landed,
than curiosity took place of anger. All wrangling ceased, and
they came swimming over to us like a parcel of seals. Thus, in
less than a quarter of an hour from the moment when it appeared
that all human intervention was at on end, and we were on the
point of commencing a bloody fray, which, independently of its
own disastrous consequences, would have blasted the success of
the expedition, we were peacefully surrounded by the hundreds who
had so lately threatened us with destruction; nor was it until
after we had returned to the boat, and had surveyed the multitude
upon the sloping bank above us, that we became fully aware of the
extent of our danger, and of the almost miraculous intervention
of Providence in our favour. There could not have been less than
six hundred natives upon that blackened sward. But this was not
the only occasion upon which the merciful superintendance of that
Providence to which we had humbly committed ourselves, was
strikingly manifested. If these pages fail to convey <!--page 108 NEW RIVER, /page-->entertainment
or information, sufficient may at least be gleaned from them to
furnish matter for serious reflection; but to those who have been
placed in situations of danger where human ingenuity availed them
not, and where human foresight was baffled, I feel persuaded that
these remarks are unnecessary. </p>

<p>It was my first care to call for our friend, and to express to
him, as well as I could, how much we stood indebted to him, at
the same time that I made him a suitable present; but to the
chiefs of the tribes, I positively refused all gifts,
notwithstanding their earnest solicitations. We next prepared to
examine the new river, and turning the boat's head towards it,
endeavoured to pull up the stream. Our larboard oars touched the
right bank, and the current was too strong for us to conquer it
with a pair only; we were, therefore, obliged to put a second
upon her, a movement that excited the astonishment and admiration
of the natives. One old woman seemed in absolute ecstasy, to whom
M'Leay threw an old tin kettle, in recompense for the amusement
she afforded us. </p>

<p>As soon as we got above the entrance of the new river, we
found easier pulling, and proceeded up it for some miles,
accompanied by the once more noisy multitude. The river preserved
a breadth of one hundred yards, and a depth of rather more than
twelve feet. Its banks were sloping and grassy, and were overhung
by trees of magnificent size. Indeed, its appearance was so
different from the water-worn banks of the sister stream, that
the men ex<!--page 109 SUPPOSED TO BE THE DARLING. /page-->claimed, on entering it, that we had got into an
English river. Its appearance certainly almost justified the
expression; for the greenness of its banks was as new to us as
the size of its timber. Its waters, though sweet, were turbid,
and had a taste of vegetable decay, as well as a slight tinge of
green. Our progress was watched by the natives with evident
anxiety. They kept abreast of us, and talked incessantly. At
length, however, our course was checked by a net that stretched
right across the stream. I say checked, because it would have
been unfair to have passed over it with the chance of
disappointing the numbers who apparently depended on it for
subsistence that day. The moment was one of intense interest to
me. As the men rested upon their oars, awaiting my further
orders, a crowd of thoughts rushed upon me. The various
conjectures I had formed of the course and importance of the
Darling passed across my mind. Were they indeed realized? An
irresistible conviction impressed me that we were now sailing on
the bosom of that very stream from whose banks I had been twice
forced to retire. I directed the Union Jack to be hoisted, and
giving way to our satisfaction, we all stood up in the boat, and
gave three distinct cheers. It was an English feeling, an
ebullition, an overflow, which I am ready to admit that our
circumstances and situation will alone excuse. The eye of every
native had been fixed upon that noble flag, at all times a
beautiful object, and to them a novel one, as it waved over us in
the heart of a desert. They had, until that moment been
particularly <!--page 110 HOIST THE UNION JACK. /page-->loquacious, but the sight of that flag and the sound
of our voices hushed the tumult, and while they were still lost
in astonishment, the boat's head was speedily turned, the sail
was sheeted home, both wind and current were in our favour, and
we vanished from them with a rapidity that surprised even
ourselves, and which precluded every hope of the most adventurous
among them to keep up with us.</p>

<p>Arrived once more at the junction of the two rivers, and
unmolested in our occupations, we had leisure to examine it more
closely. Not having as yet given a name to our first discovery,
when we re-entered its capacious channel on this occasion, I laid
it down as the Murray River, in compliment to the distinguished
officer, Sir George Murray, who then presided over the colonial
department, not only in compliance with the known wishes of his
Excellency General Darling, but also in accordance with my own
feelings as a soldier. <!--page 112 INUNDATED AND ALLUVIAL COUNTRY. /page--> </p>

<p>The new river, whether the Darling or an additional discovery,
meets its more southern rival on a N. by E. course; the latter,
running W.S.W. at the confluence, the angle formed by the two
rivers, is, therefore, so small that both may be considered to
preserve their proper course, and neither can be said to be
tributary to the other. At their junction, the Murray spreads its
waters over the broad and sandy shore, upon which our boat
grounded, while its more impetuous neighbour flows through the
deep but narrow channel it has worked out for itself, under the
right bank. The strength of their currents must have been nearly
equal, since there was as distinct a line between their
respective waters, to a considerable distance below the junction,
as if a thin board alone separated them. The one half the channel
contained the turbid waters of the northern stream, the other
still preserved their original transparency. </p>

<p>The banks of the Murray did not undergo any immediate change
as we proceeded. We noticed that the country had, at some time,
been subject to extensive inundation, and was, beyond doubt, of
alluvial formation. We passed the mouths of several large creeks
that came from the north and N.W., and the country in those
directions seemed to be much intersected by water-courses; while
to the south it was extremely low. Having descended several minor
rapids, I greatly regretted that we had no barometer to ascertain
the actual dip of the interior. I computed, however, that we were
not more than from eighty to ninety feet above the level of the
sea. We found the <!--page 113 STATE OF PROVISIONS. /page-->channel of the Murray much encumbered with
timber, and noticed some banks of sand that were of unusual size,
and equalled the largest accumulations of it on the sea shore,
both in extent and solidity. </p>

<p>We would gladly have fired into the flights of wild fowl that
winged their way over us, for we, about this time, began to feel
the consequences of the disaster that befell us in the
Morumbidgee. The fresh water having got mixed with the brine in
the meat casks, the greater part of our salt provisions had got
spoiled, so that we were obliged to be extremely economical in
the expenditure of what remained, as we knew not to what straits
we might be driven. It will naturally be asked why we did not
procure fish? The answer is easy. The men had caught many in the
Morumbidgee, and on our first navigation of the Murray, but
whether it was that they had disagreed with them, or that their
appetites were palled, or that they were too fatigued after the
labour of the day to set the lines, they did not appear to care
about them. The only fish we could take was the common cod or
perch; and, without sauce or butter, it is insipid enough. We
occasionally exchanged pieces of iron-hoop for two other kinds of
fish, the one a bream, the other a barbel, with the natives, and
the eagerness with which they met our advances to barter, is a
strong proof of their natural disposition towards this first step
in civilization. </p>

<p>As they threw off all reserve when accompanying us as
ambassadors, we had frequent opportunities of observing their
habits. The facility, for instance, with which they pro<!--page 114 DEXTERITY OF NATIVES IN FISHING. /page-->cured fish
was really surprising. They would slip, feet foremost, into the
water as they walked along the bank of the river, as if they had
accidentally done so, but, in reality, to avoid the splash they
would necessarily have made if they had plunged in head foremost.
As surely as they then disappeared under the surface of the
water, so surely would they re-appear with a fish writhing upon
the point of their short spears. The very otter scarcely exceeds
them in power over the finny race, and so true is the aim of
these savages, even under water, that all the fish we procured
from them were pierced either close behind the lateral fin, or in
the very centre of the head, It is certain, from their
indifference to them, that the natives seldom eat fish when they
can get anything else. Indeed, they seemed more anxious to take
the small turtle, which, sunning themselves on the trunks or logs
of trees over the water, were, nevertheless, extremely on their
guard. A gentle splash alone indicated to us that any thing had
dropped into the water, but the quick eyes and ears of our guides
immediately detected what had occasioned it, and they seldom
failed to take the poor little animal that had so vainly trusted
to its own watchfulness for security. It appeared that the
natives did not, from choice, frequent the Murray; it was
evident, therefore, that they had other and better means of
subsistence away from it, and it struck me, at the time, that the
river we had just passed watered a better country than any
through which the Murray had been found to flow. <!--page 115 BREAK UP THE SKIFF. /page--> </p>

<p>We encamped rather earlier than usual upon the left bank of
the river, near a broad creek; for as the skiff had been a great
drag upon us, I determined on breaking it up, since there was no
probability that we should ever require the still, which alone
remained in her. We, consequently, burnt the former, to secure
her nails and iron work, and I set Clayton about cutting the
copper of the latter into the shape of crescents, in order to
present them to the natives. Some large huts were observed on the
side of the creek, a little above the camp, the whole of which
faced the N.E. This arrangement had previously been noticed by
us, so that I was led to infer that the severest weather comes
from the opposite quarter in this part of the interior. I had not
the least idea, at the time, however, that we should, ere we
reached the termination of our journey, experience the effects of
the S.W. winds. </p>

<p>We must have fallen considerably during the day from the level
of our morning's position, for we passed down many reaches where
the decline of country gave an increased velocity to the current
of the river. </p>

<p>I had feared, not only in consequence of the unceremonious
manner in which we had left them, but, because I had, in some
measure, rejected the advances of their chiefs, that none of the
natives would follow us, and I regretted the circumstance on
account of my men, as well as the trouble we should necessarily
have in conciliating the next tribe. We had not, however, been
long encamped, when seven blacks joined us. I think they would
have passed <!--page 116 NEW RIVER IDENTIFIED /page-->on if we had not called to them. As it was, they
remained with us but for a short time. We treated them very
kindly, but they were evidently under constraint, and were, no
doubt, glad when they found we did not object to their departing.
</p>

<p>I have stated, that I felt satisfied in my own mind, that the
beautiful stream we had passed was no other than the river
Darling of my former journey. The bare assertion, however, is not
sufficient to satisfy the mind of the reader, upon a point of
such importance, more especially when it is considered how
remarkable a change the Darling must have undergone, if this were
indeed a continuation of it. I am free to confess that it
required an effort to convince myself, but after due
consideration, I see no reason to alter the opinion I formed at a
moment of peculiar embarrassment. Yet it by no means follows that
I shall convince others, although I am myself convinced. The
question is one of curious speculation, and the consideration of
it will lead us to an interesting conjecture, as to the probable
nature of the distant interior, between the two points. It will
be remembered that I was obliged to relinquish my pursuit of the
Darling, in east long. 144° 48´ 30´´ in lat. 30° 17´ 30´´
south. I place the junction of the Murray and the new river, in
long. 140° 56´ east, and in south lat. 34° 3´. I must remark,
however, that the lunars I took on this last occasion, were not
satisfactory, and that there is, probably, an error, though not a
material one, in the calculation. Before I measure the distance
between the above points, or make any remarks <!--page 117 WITH THE DARLING. /page-->on the results of
my own observations, I would impress the following facts upon the
reader's mind. </p>

<p>I found and left the Darling in a complete state of
exhaustion. As a river it had ceased to flow; the only supply it
received was from brine springs, which, without imparting a
current, rendered its waters saline and useless, and lastly, the
fish in it were different from those inhabiting the other known
rivers of the interior. It is true, I did not procure a perfect
specimen of one, but we satisfactorily ascertained that they were
different, inasmuch as they had large and strong scales, whereas
the fish in the western waters have smooth skins. On the other
hand, the waters of the new river were sweet, although turbid; it
had a rapid current in it; and its fish were of the ordinary
kind. In the above particulars, therefore, they differed much as
they could well differ. Yet there were some strong points of
resemblance in the appearance of the rivers themselves, which
were more evident to me than I can hope to make them to the
reader. Both were shaded by trees of the same magnificent
dimensions; and the same kind of huts were erected on the banks
of each, inhabited by the same description, or race, of people,
whose weapons, whose implements, and whose nets corresponded in
most respects. </p>

<p>We will now cast our eyes over the chart: and see if the
position of the two rivers upon it, will at all bear out our
conclusion that they are one and the same; and whether the line
that would join them is the one that the Darling would naturally
take, in reference to its previous course.&mdash;<!--page 118 NEW RIVER IDENTIFIED /page-->We shall find
that the two points under discussion, bear almost N.E. and S.W.
of each other respectively, the direct line in which the Darling
had been ascertained to flow, as far as it had been found
practicable to trace it. I have already remarked that the
fracture of my barometer prevented my ascertaining the height of
the bed of the Darling above the sea, during the first
expedition. A similar accident caused me equal disappointment on
the second; because one of the most important points upon which I
was engaged was to ascertain the dip of the interior. I believe I
stated, in its proper place, that I did not think the Darling
could possibly be 200 feet above the sea, and as far as my
observations bear me out, I should estimate the bed of the
Murray, at its junction with the new river, to be within 100. It
would appear that there is a distance of 300 miles between the
Murray River at this place, and the Darling; a space amply
sufficient for the intervention of a hilly country. No one could
have been more attentive to the features of the interior than I
was; nor could any one have dwelt upon their peculiarities with
more earnest attention. It were hazardous to build up any new
theory, however ingenious it may appear. The conclusions into
which I have been led, are founded on actual observation of the
country through which I passed, and extend not beyond my actual
range of vision; unless my assuming that the decline of the
interior to the south has been satisfactorily established, be
considered premature. If not, the features of the country
certainly justify my deductions; and it will be found that they <!--page 119 WITH THE DARLING. /page-->were
still more confirmed by subsequent observation.&mdash;That the
Darling should have lost its current in its upper branches, is
not surprising, when the level nature of the country into which
it falls is taken into consideration; neither does it surprise me
that it should be stationary in one place, and flowing in
another; since, if, as in the present instance, there is a great
extent of country between the two points, which may perhaps be of
considerable elevation, the river may receive tributaries, whose
waters will of course follow the general decline of the country.
I take it to be so in the case before us; and am of opinion, that
the lower branches of the Darling are not at all dependent on its
sources for a current, or for a supply of water. I have somewhere
observed that it appeared to me the depressed interior over which
I had already travelled, was of comparatively recent formation.
And, by whatever convulsion or change so extensive a tract became
exposed, I cannot but infer, that the Darling is the main channel
by which the last waters of the ocean were drained off. The
bottom of the estuary, for it cannot be called a valley, being
then left exposed, it consequently remains the natural and proper
reservoir for the streams from the eastward, or those falling
easterly from the westward, if any such remain to be discovered. </p>

<p>From the junction of the Morumbidgee to the junction of the
new river, the Murray had held a W.N.W. course. From the last
junction it changed its direction to the S.W., and increased
considerably in size. The country to the south was certainly
lower than that to the north; for, al<!--page 120 CHANGE OF COUNTRY. /page-->though both banks had
features common to each other, the flooded spaces were much more
extensive to our left than to our right. </p>

<p>We started on the morning of the 24th, all the lighter from
having got rid of the skiff, and certainly freer to act in case
the natives should evince a hostile disposition towards us. As we
proceeded down the river, the appearances around us more and more
plainly indicated a change of country. Cypresses were observed in
the distance, and the ground on which they stood was higher than
that near the stream; as if it had again acquired its secondary
banks. At length these heights approached the river so nearly as
to form a part of its banks, and to separate one alluvial flat
from another. Their summits were perfectly level; their soil was
a red sandy loam; and their productions, for the most part,
salsolae and misembrianthemum. From this it would appear that we
had passed through a second region, that must at some time have
been under water, and that still retained all the marks of a
country partially subject to flood. </p>

<p>We had, as I have said, passed over this region, and were
again hemmed in by those sandy and sterile tracts upon which the
beasts of the field could obtain neither food nor water. We
overtook the seven deputies some time after we started, but soon
lost sight of them again, as they cut off the sweeps of the
river, and shortened their journey as much as possible. At 2 p.m.
we found them with a tribe of their countrymen, about eighty in
number. We pulled in to the bank and remained with them for a
short <!--page 121 INTRODUCED FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE. /page-->time, and I now determined to convince the blacks who had
preceded us, that I had not been actuated by any other desire
than that of showing to them that we were not to be intimidated
by numbers, when I refused to make them any presents after their
show of hostility. I now, therefore, gave them several
implements, sundry pieces of iron hoop, and an ornamental badge
of copper. When we left the tribe, we were regularly handed over
to their care. The seven men who had introduced us, went back at
the same time that we continued our journey, and two more
belonging to the new tribe, went on a-head to prepare the the
neighbouring tribe to receive us; nor did we see anything more of
them during the day. </p>

<p>We encamped on the left bank of the river, amidst a polygonum
scrub, in which we found a number of the crested pigeon. It was
late before the tents were pitched: as Fraser seldom assisted in
that operation, but strolled out with his gun after he had
kindled a fire, so on this occasion he wandered from the camp in
search of novelty, and on his return, informed me that there was
a considerable ridge to the south of a plain upon which he had
been. </p>

<p>I had myself walked out to the S.E., and on ascending a few
feet above the level of the camp, got into a scrub. I was walking
quietly through it, when I heard a rustling noise, and looking in
the direction whence it proceeded, I observed a small kangaroo
approaching me. Having a stick in my hand, and being aware that I
was in one of their paths, I stood still until the animal came
close up to me, <!--page 122 RIDGE TO THE SOUTH-EAST. /page-->without apparently being aware of my presence. I
then gave it a blow an the side of the head, and made it reel to
one side, but the stick, being rotten, broke with the force of
the blow, and thus disappointed me of a good meal. </p>

<p>During my absence from the camp, a flight of cockatoos, new to
us, but similar to one that Mr. Hume shot on the Darling, passed
over the tents, and I found M'Leay, with his usual anxiety,
trying to get a shot at them. They had, he told me, descended to
water, but they had chosen a spot so difficult of approach
without discovery, that he had found it impossible to get within
shot of them. </p>

<p>There was a considerable rapid just below our position, which
I examined before dark. Not seeing any danger, I requested M'Leay
to proceed down it in the boat as soon as he had breakfasted, and
to wait for me at the bottom of it. As I wished to ascertain the
nature and height of the elevations which Fraser had magnified
into something grand, Fraser and I proceeded to the centre of a
large plain, stretching from the left bank of the river to the
southward. It was bounded to the S.E. by a low scrub; to the S. a
thickly wooded ridge appeared to break the level of the country.
It extended from east to west for four or five miles, and then
gradually declined. At its termination, the country seemed to
dip, and a dense fog, as from an extensive sheet of water,
enveloped the landscape. The plain was crowded with cockatoos,
that were making their morning's repast on the berries of the
salsolae and rhagodia, with which it was covered. <!--page 123 DISTANT RANGES SEEN. /page--> </p>

<p>M'Leay had got safely down the rapid, so that as soon as I
joined him, we proceeded on our journey. We fell in with the
tribe we had already seen, but increased in numbers, and we had
hardly left them, when we found another tribe most anxiously
awaiting our arrival. We stayed with the last for some time, and
exhausted our vocabulary, and exerted our ingenuity to gain some
information from them. I directed Hopkinson to pile up some clay,
to enquire if we were near any hills, when two or three of the
blacks caught the meaning, and pointed to the N.W. Mulholland
climbed up a tree in consequence of this, and reported to me that
he saw lofty ranges in the direction to which the blacks pointed;
that there were two apparently, the one stretching to the N.E.,
the other to the N.W. He stated their distance to be about forty
miles, and added that he thought he could observe other ranges,
through the gap, which, according to the alignment of two sticks,
that I placed according to Mulholland's directions, bore S. 130
W. </p>

<p>We had landed upon the right bank of the river, and there was
a large lagoon immediately behind us. The current in the river
did not run so strong as it had been. Its banks were much lower,
and were generally covered with reeds. The spaces subject to
flood were broader than heretofore, and the country for more than
twenty miles was extremely depressed. Our view from the highest
ground near the camp was very confined, since we were apparently
in a hollow, and were unable to obtain a second sight of the
ranges we had noticed. <!--page 124 PASS THREE CREEKS. /page--> </p>

<p>Three creeks fell into the Murray hereabouts. One from the
north, another from the N.E., and the third from the south. The
two first were almost choked up with the trunks of trees, but the
last had a clear channel. Our tents stood on ground high above
the reach of flood. The soil was excellent, and the brushes
behind us abounded with a new species of melaleuca. </p>

<p>The heat of the weather, at this time, was extremely
oppressive, and the thermometer was seldom under 100° of Fahr.
at noon. The wind, too, we observed, seldom remained stationary
for any length of time, but made its regular changes every
twenty-four hours. In the morning, it invariably blew from the
N.E., at noon it shifted to N.W., and as the sun set it flew
round to the eastward of south. A few dense clouds passed over us
occasionally, but no rain fell from them. </p>

<p>Our intercourse with the natives had now been constant. We had
found the interior more populous than we had any reason to
expect; yet as we advanced into it, the population appeared to
increase. It was impossible for us to judge of the disposition of
the natives during the short interviews we generally had with
them, and our motions were so rapid that we did not give them
time to form any concerted plan of attack, had they been inclined
to attack us. They did not, however, show any disposition to
hostility, but, considering all things, were quiet and orderly,
nor did any instances of theft occur, or, at least, none fell
under my notice. The most loathsome of diseases prevailed through<!--page 125 DISEASES OF THE NATIVES. /page-->out
the tribes, nor were the youngest infants exempt from them.
Indeed, so young were some, whose condition was truly disgusting,
that I cannot but suppose they must have been born in a state of
disease; but I am uncertain whether it is fatal or not in its
results, though, most probably it hurries many to a premature
grave. How these diseases originated it is impossible to say.
Certainly not from the colony, since the midland tribes alone
were infected. Syphilis raged amongst them with fearful violence;
many had lost their noses, and all the glandular parts were
considerably affected. I distributed some Turner's cerate to the
women, but left Fraser to superintend its application. It could
do no good, of course, but it convinced the natives we intended
well towards them, and, on that account, it was politic to give
it, setting aside any humane feeling. </p>

<p>The country through which we passed on the 28th, was extremely
low, full of lagoons, and thickly inhabited. No change took place
in the river, or in the nature and construction of its banks. We
succeeded in getting a view of the hills we had noticed when with
the last tribe, and found that they bore from us due north, N. 22
E., and S. 130 W. They looked bare and perpendicular, and
appeared to be about twenty miles from us. I am very uncertain as
to the character of these hills, but still think that they must
have been some of the faces of the bold cliffs that we had
frequently passed under. From the size and number of the huts,
and from the great breadth of the foot-paths, we were still
further led to conclude that <!--page 126 POPULOUS DISTRICT. /page-->we were passing through a very
populous district. What the actual number of inhabitants was it
is impossible to say, but we seldom communicated with fewer than
200 daily. They sent ambassadors forward regularly from one tribe
to another, in order to prepare for our approach, a custom that
not only saved us an infinity of time, but also great personal
risk. Indeed, I doubt very much whether we should ever have
pushed so far down the river, had we not been assisted by the
natives themselves. I was particularly careful not to do anything
that would alarm them, or to permit any liberty to be taken with
their women. Our reserve in this respect seemed to excite their
surprise, for they asked sundry questions, by signs and
expressions, as to whether we had any women, and where they were.
The whole tribe generally assembled to receive us, and all,
without exception, were in a complete state of nudity, and really
the loathsome condition and hideous countenances of the women
would, I should imagine, have been a complete antidote to the
sexual passion. It is to be observed, that the women are very
inferior in appearance to the men. The latter are, generally
speaking, a clean-limbed and powerful race, much stouter in the
bust than below, but withal, active, and, in some respects,
intelligent; but the women are poor, weak, and emaciated. This,
perhaps, is owing to their poverty and paucity of food, and to
the treatment they receive at the hands of the men; but the
latter did not show any unkindness towards them in our presence. <!--page 127 JUNCTION OF THE RUFUS. /page-->
</p>

<p>Although I desired to avoid exciting their alarm, I still made
a point of showing them the effects of a gunshot, by firing at a
kite, or any other bird that happened to be near. My
dexterity&mdash;for I did not trust Fraser, who would, ten to
one, have missed his mark&mdash;was generally exerted, as I
have said, against a kite or a crow; both of which birds
generally accompanied the blacks from place to place to pick up
the remnants of their meals. Yet, I was often surprised at the
apparent indifference with which the natives not only saw the
effect of the shot, but heard the report. I have purposely gone
into the centre of a large assemblage and fired at a bird that
has fallen upon their very heads, without causing a start or an
exclamation, without exciting either their alarm or their
curiosity. </p>

<p>Whence this callous feeling proceeded, whether from strength
of nerve, or because they had been informed by our forerunners
that we should show off before them, I know not, but I certainly
expected a very different effect from that which my firing
generally produced, although I occasionally succeeded in
scattering them pretty well. </p>

<p>About 11 a.m., we arrived at the junction of a small river
with the Murray, at which a tribe, about 250 in number, had
assembled to greet us. We landed, therefore, for the double
purpose of distributing presents, and of examining the junction,
which, coming from the north, of course, fell into the Murray
upon its right bank. Its waters were so extremely muddy, and its
current so rapid, that it must <!--page 128 GEOLOGICAL EXAMINATION. /page-->have been swollen by some late
rains. Perhaps, it had its sources in the hills we had seen; be
that as it may, it completely discoloured the waters of the
Murray. </p>

<p>We made it a point never to distribute any presents among the
natives until we had made them all sit, or stand, in a row.
Sometimes this was a troublesome task, but we generally succeeded
in gaining our point; with a little exertion of patience. M'Leay
was a famous hand at ordering the ranks, and would, I am sure,
have made a capital drill-sergeant, not less on account of his
temper than of his perseverance. I called the little tributary I
have noticed, the Rufus, in honour of my friend M'Leay's red
head, and I have no doubt, he will understand the feeling that
induced me to give it such a name. </p>

<p>Not many miles below the Rufus, we passed under a lofty cliff
upon the same side with it. It is the first elevation of any
consequence that occurs below the Darling, and not only on that
account, but also on account of the numerous substances of which
it is composed, and the singular formation that is near requires
to be particularly noticed.* <span class="note">[See Appendix.]</span> The examination was
a task of considerable danger, and both Fraser and myself had
well nigh been buried under a mass of the cliff that became
suddenly detached, and, breaking into thousands of pieces, went
hissing and cracking into the river. </p>

<p>The weather about this time was extremely oppressive and
close. Thunder clouds darkened the sky, but no rain <!--page 129 THUNDER STORMS. /page-->fell. The
thermometer was seldom below 104 at noon, and its range was very
trifling. The wind shifted several times during the twenty-four
hours; but these changes had no effect on the thermometer. It was
evident, however, as the sun set on the evening of the 26th, that
the clouds from which thunder had for the last four or five days
disturbed the silence of nature around us, would not long support
their own weight. A little before midnight, it commenced raining,
and both wind and rain continued to increase in violence until
about seven in the morning of the 27th; when the weather
moderated. </p>

<p>Two or three blacks had accompanied us from the last tribe,
and had lain down near the fire. As the storm increased, however,
they got up, and swimming across the river, left us to ourselves.
This was a very unusual thing, nor can I satisfy myself as to
their object, unless it was to get into shelter, for these people
though they wander naked over the country, and are daily in the
water, feel the cold and rain very acutely. </p>

<p>Observing the clouds collecting for so many days, I indulged
hopes that we were near high lands, perhaps mountains; but from
the loftiest spots we could see nothing but a level and dark
horizon. Anxious to gain as correct a knowledge of the country as
possible we had, in the course of the day, ascended a sandy ridge
that was about a mile from the river. The view from the summit of
this ridge promised to be more extensive than any we had of late
been enabled to obtain; and as far as actual observation went, <!--page 130 LINDESAY RIVER. /page-->we
were not disappointed, although in every other particular, the
landscape was one of the most unpromising description. To the S.
and S.E., the country might be said to stretch away in one
unbroken plain, for it was so generally covered with wood that
every inequality was hidden from our observation. To the S.W. the
river line was marked out by a succession of red cliffs, similar
to those we had already passed. To the north, the interior was
evidently depressed; it was overgrown with a low scrub, and
seemed to be barren in the extreme. The elevations upon which we
stood were similar to the sand-hills near the coast, and had not
a blade of grass upon them. Yet, notwithstanding the sterility of
the soil, the large white amarillis which grew in such profusion
on the alluvial plains of the Macquarie, was also abundant here.
But it had lost its dazzling whiteness, and had assumed a sickly
yellow colour and its very appearance indicated that it was not
in a congenial soil. </p>

<p>We passed two very considerable junctions, the one coming from
the S.E., the other from the north. Both had currents in them,
but the former was running much stronger than the latter. It
falls into the Murray, almost opposite to the elevations I have
been describing, and, if a judgment can be hazarded from its
appearance at its embouchure, it must, in its higher branches, be
a stream of considerable magnitude. Under this impression, I have
called it the Lindesay, as a tribute of respect to my commanding
officer, Colonel Patrick Lindesay of the 39th regt. I place it in
east long. 140° 29´, and in lat. 33° 58´ south. Mr. Hume is <!--page 131 NATIVES BECOME TROUBLESOME. /page-->of
opinion that this is the most southerly of the rivers crossed by
him and Mr. Hovel in 1823; but, as I have already remarked, I
apprehend that all the rivers those gentlemen crossed, had united
in one main stream above the junction of the Morumbidgee, and I
think it much more probable that this is a new river, and that it
rises to the westward of Port Phillips, rather than in the S.E.
angle of the coast. </p>

<p>We found the blacks who had deserted us with a tribe at the
junction, but it was weak in point of numbers; as were also two
other tribes or hordes to whom we were introduced in rapid
succession. Taken collectively, they could not have amounted to
230 men, women, and children. The last of these hordes was
exceedingly troublesome, and I really thought we should have been
obliged to quarrel with them. Whether it was that we were getting
impatient, or that our tempers were soured, I know not, but even
M'Leay, whose partiality towards the natives was excessive at the
commencement of our journey, now became weary of such constant
communication as we had kept up with them. Their sameness of
appearance, the disgusting diseases that raged among them, their
abominable filth, the manner in which they pulled us about, and
the impossibility of making them understand us, or of obtaining
any information from them,&mdash;for if we could have
succeeded in this point, we should have gladly borne every
inconvenience,&mdash;all combined to estrange us from these
people and to make their presence disagreeable. Yet there was an
absolute necessity to keep up the chain of communication, to
ensure our own safety, <!--page 132 TEMPESTUOUS WEATHER. /page-->setting aside every other consideration;
but as I had been fortunate in my intercourse with the natives
during the first expedition, so I hoped the present journey would
terminate without the occurrence of any fatal collision between
us. The natives, it is true, were generally quiet; but they
crowded round us frequently without any regard to our
remonstrances, laying hold of the boat to prevent our going away,
and I sometimes thought that had any of them been sufficiently
bold to set the example, many of the tribes would have attempted
our capture. Indeed, in several instances, we were obliged to
resort to blows ere we could disengage ourselves from the crowds
around us, and whenever this occurred, it called forth the most
sullen and ferocious scowl&mdash;such, probably, as would be
the forerunner of hostility, and would preclude every hope of
mercy at their hands. With each new tribe we were, in some
measure, obliged to submit to an examination, and to be pulled
about, and fingered all over. They generally measured our hands
and feet with their own, counted our fingers, felt our faces, and
besmeared our shirts all over with grease and dirt. This was no
very agreeable ceremony, and a repetition of it was quite
revolting, more especially when we had to meet the grins or
frowns of the many with firmness and composure. </p>

<p>The weather had been tempestuous and rainy, for three or four
successive days: on the 28th it cleared up a little. Under any
circumstances, however, we could not have delayed our journey. We
had not proceeded very far when <!--page 133 SINGULAR FORMATION OF THE BANKS. /page-->it again commenced to rain and to
blow heavily from the N.W. The river trended to the South. We
passed down several rapids, and observed the marks of recent
flood on the trees, to the height of seven feet. The alluvial
flats did not appear to have been covered, or to be subject to
overflow. The timber upon them was not of a kind that is found on
flooded lands, but wherever reeds prevailed the flooded or blue
gum stretched its long white branches over them. The country to
the westward was low and bushy. </p>

<p>The left bank of the Murray was extremely lofty, and
occasionally rose to 100 feet perpendicularly from the water. It
is really difficult to describe the appearance of the banks at
this place; so singular were they in character, and so varied in
form. Here they had the most beautiful columnar regularity, with
capitals somewhat resembling the Corinthian order in
configuration; there they showed like falls of muddy water that
had suddenly been petrified; and in another place they resembled
the time-worn battlements of a feudal castle. It will naturally
be asked, of what could these cliffs have been composed to assume
so many different forms? and what could have operated to produce
such unusual appearances? The truth is, they were composed almost
wholly of clay and sand. Wherever the latter had accumulated, or
predominated, the gradual working of water had washed it away,
and left the more compact body, in some places, so delicately
hollowed out, that it seemed rather the work of art than of
nature. This singular formation rested on a coarse grit, that
showed itself in slabs. <!--page 134 LARGE TRIBE OF NATIVES. /page--> </p>

<p>From the frequent occurrence of rapids I should imagine that
we had fallen considerably, but there was no visible decline of
country. The river swept along, in broad and noble reaches, at
the base of the cliffs. Vast accumulations of sand were in its
bed, a satisfactory proof of the sandy character of the distant
interior, if other proof were wanting. </p>

<p>We did not see so many natives on the 28th as we had been in
the habit of seeing; perhaps in consequence of the boisterous
weather. A small tribe of about sixty had collected to receive
us, but we passed on without taking any notice of them,
Nevertheless they deputed two of their men to follow us, who
overtook us just as we stopped for the purpose of pitching our
tents before the clouds should burst, that just then bore the
most threatening appearance. The blacks seemed to be perfectly
aware what kind of a night we should have, and busied themselves
preparing a hut and making a large fire. </p>

<p>The evening proved extremely dark, and towards midnight it
blew and rained fiercely. Towards morning the wind moderated, and
the rain ceased. Still, the sky was overcast, and the clouds were
passing rapidly over us. The wind had, however, changed some
points, and from the N.W. had veered round to the S.S.W.; and the
day eventually turned out cool and pleasant. </p>

<p>We fell in with a large tribe of natives, amounting in all to
270. They were extremely quiet, and kept away from the boat; in
consequence of which I distributed a great <!--page 135 THEIR INDIFFERENCE TO FIRE-ARMS. /page-->many presents among
them. This tribe was almost the only one that evinced any
eagerness to see us. The lame had managed to hobble along, and
the blind were equally anxious to touch us. There were two or
three old men stretched upon the bank, from whom the last sigh
seemed about to depart; yet these poor creatures evinced an
anxiety to see us, and to listen to a description of our
appearance, although it seemed doubtful whether they would be
alive twenty-four hours after we left them. An old woman, a
picture of whom would disgust my readers, made several attempts
to embrace me. I managed, however, to avoid her, and at length
got rid of her by handing her over to Fraser, who was no wise
particular as to the object of his attention. This tribe must
have been one of the most numerous on the banks of the Murray,
since we fell in with detached families for many miles below the
place where we had parted from the main body. </p>

<p>I have omitted to mention that, while among them, I fired at a
kite and killed it; yet, though close to me, the blacks did not
start or evince the least surprise. It really is difficult to
account for such firmness of nerve or self-command. It is not so
much a matter of surprise that they were indifferent to its
effects, for probably they knew them not, but it is certainly odd
that they should not have been startled by the report. </p>

<p>The river inclined very much to the southward for some miles
below our last camp; at length it struck against some elevations
that turned it more to the westward. Before we <!--page 136 REFLECTIONS ON THE PROGRESS /page-->terminated our
day's pull it again changed its direction to the eastward of
south. The right bank became lofty, and the left proportionably
depressed. </p>

<p>In consequence of the boisterous weather we had had, we were
uncertain as to our precise situation, even in point of latitude.
But I was perfectly aware that we were considerably to the south
of the head of St. Vincent's Gulf. I began, therefore, to
contemplate with some confidence a speedy termination to our
wanderings, or, at least, that we should soon reach the extreme
point to which we could advance. The sun was at this time out of
my reach, since the sextant would not measure double the
altitude. Observations of the stars were, in like manner,
uncertain, in consequence of the boisterous weather we had had,
and the unavoidable agitation of the quicksilver. My last
observation of Antares placed us in latitude 34° 4´; so that we
were still 115 miles from the coast. </p>

<p>We had now been twenty-two days upon the river, and it was
uncertain how long we should be in compassing the distance we had
still to run. Considering all things, we had, as yet, been
extremely fortunate; and I hoped that we should terminate our
journey without the occurrence of any fatal accident. Had the
country corresponded with the noble stream that traversed it, we
should have been proportionably elated, but it was impossible to
conceal from ourselves its inhospitable and unprofitable
character, as far as we had, as yet, penetrated. If we except the
partial and alluvial flats on the immediate borders, and in the
neighbourhood of its tributaries and creeks, the Murray <!--page 137 OF THE EXPEDITION. /page-->might be
said to flow through a barren and sandy interior. The appearance
of the country through which we passed on the 29th, was far from
being such as to encourage us with the hopes of any change for
the better. The river was enclosed, on either side, by the same
kind of banks that have already been described; and it almost
appeared as if the plain had been rent asunder to allow of a
passage for its waters. The view of the distant interior was
unsatisfactory. It was, for the most part, covered with brush,
but, at length, cypresses again made their appearance, although
at a considerable distance from us. </p>

<p>The river continued to flow to the southward, a circumstance
that gave me much satisfaction, for I now began to feel some
anxiety about the men. They had borne their fatigues and trials
so cheerfully, and had behaved so well, that I could not but
regret the scanty provision that remained for them. The salt meat
being spoiled, it had fallen to the share of the dogs, so that we
had little else than flour to eat. Fish no one would touch, and
of wild fowl there were none to be seen. The men complained of
sore eyes, from the perspiration constantly running into them,
and it was obvious to me that they were much reduced. It will be
borne in mind, that we were now performing the earliest part of
our task, and were going down with the stream. I was sure that on
our return, (For I had no hopes of meeting any vessel on the
coast,) we should have to make every day's journey good against
the current; and, if the men were now beginning to sink, it might
well be doubted whether their strength would hold out. Both
M'Leay and <!--page 138 NATIVES BECOME UNRULY. /page-->myself, therefore, encouraged any cheerfulness that
occasionally broke out among them, and Frazer enlivened them by
sundry tunes that he whistled whilst employed in skinning birds.
I am sure, no galley-slave ever took to his oar with more
reluctance than poor Frazer. He was indefatigable in most things,
but he could not endure the oar. </p>

<p>We did not fall in with any natives on the 30th, neither did
we see those who had preceded us from the last tribe. On the
31st, to my mortification, the river held so much to the
northward, that we undid almost all our southing. What with its
regular turns, and its extensive sweeps, the Murray covers treble
the ground, at a moderate computation, that it would occupy in a
direct course; and we had a practical instance of the truth of
this in the course of the afternoon, when we found our friends
ready to introduce us to a large assemblage of natives. On asking
them how they had passed us, they pointed directly east to the
spot at which we had parted. By crossing from one angle of the
river to the other, they had performed in little more than half a
day, a journey which it had taken us two long days to accomplish.
After our usual distribution of presents, we pushed away from the
bank; though not without some difficulty, in consequence of the
obstinacy of the natives in wishing to detain us; and I was
exceedingly vexed to find, while we were yet in sight of them,
that we had proceeded down a shallow channel on one side of an
island instead of the further and deeper one; so that the boat
ultimately grounded. A crowd of the blacks rushed into the water,
and surrounded us <!--page 139 CHANGE IN THE GEOLOGY OF THE COUNTRY. /page-->on every side. Some came to assist us, others,
under a pretence of assisting, pulled against us, and I was at
length obliged to repel them by threats. A good many of them were
very much disposed to annoy us, and, after the boat was in deep
water, some of them became quite infuriated, because we would not
return. Had we been within distance, they would assuredly have
hurled their spears at us. Thirteen of them followed us to our
resting place. They kept rather apart from us, and kindled their
fire in a little hollow about fifty paces to our right; nor did
they venture to approach the tents unless we called to them, so
that by their quiet and unobtrusive conduct they made up in some
measure for the unruly proceedings of others of their tribe. </p>

<p>We had now arrived at a point at which I hoped to gain some
information from the natives, respecting the sea. It was to no
purpose, however, that I questioned these stupid people. They
understood perfectly, by my pointing to the sky, and by other
signs, that I was inquiring about large waters, but they could
not, or would not, give any information on the subject. </p>

<p>As we proceeded down the river, its current became weaker, and
its channel somewhat deeper. Our attention was called to a
remarkable change in the geology of the country, as well as to an
apparent alteration in the natural productions. The cliffs of
sand and clay ceased, and were succeeded by a fossil formation of
the most singular description. At first, it did not exceed a foot
in height above the water, but it gradually rose, like an
inclined <!--page 140 BANKS OF PETRIFIED SHELLS. /page-->plane, and resembled in colour, and in appearance, the
skulls of men piled one upon the other. The constant rippling of
the water against the rock had washed out the softer parts, and
made hollows and cavities, that gave the whole formation the
precise appearance of a catacomb. On examination, we discovered
it to be a compact bed of shells, composed of a common
description of marine shell from two to three inches in length,
apparently a species of turritella. </p>

<p>At about nine miles from the commencement of this formation,
it rose to the height of more than 150 feet; the country became
undulating, and a partial change took place in its vegetation. We
stopped at an early hour, to examine some cliffs, which rising
perpendicularly from the water, were different in character and
substance from any we had as yet seen. They approached a dirty
yellow-ochre in colour, that became brighter in hue as it rose,
and, instead of being perforated, were compact and hard. The
waters of the river had, however, made horizontal lines upon
their fronts, which distinctly marked the rise and fall of the
river, as the strength or depth of the grooves distinctly
indicated the levels it generally kept. It did not appear from
these lines, that the floods ever rose more than four feet above
the then level of the stream, or that they continued for any
length of time. On breaking off pieces of the rock, we
ascertained that it was composed of one solid mass of sea-shells,
of various kinds, of which the species first mentioned formed the
lowest part. <!--page 141 FACE OF THE COUNTRY. /page--> </p>

<p>It rained a good deal during the night, but the morning turned
out remarkably fine. The day was pleasant, for however
inconvenient in some respects the frequent showers had been, they
had cooled the air, and consequently prevented our feeling the
heat so much as we should otherwise have done, in the close and
narrow glen we had now entered. </p>

<p>Among the natives who followed us from the last tribe, there
was an old man, who took an uncommon fancy or attachment to
Hopkinson, and who promised, when we separated, to join us again
in the course of the day. </p>

<p>As we proceeded down the river we found that it was confined
in a glen, whose extreme breadth was not more than half-a-mile.
The hills that rose on either side of it were of pretty equal
height. The alluvial flats were extremely small, and the boldest
cliffs separated them from each other. The flats were lightly
wooded, and were for the most part covered with reeds or
polygonum. They were not much elevated above the waters of the
river, and had every appearance of being frequently inundated. At
noon we pulled up to dine, upon the left bank, under some hills,
which were from 200 to 250 feet in height. While the men were
preparing our tea, (for we had only that to boil,) M'Leay and I
ascended the hills. The brush was so thick upon them, that we
could not obtain a view of the distant interior. Their summits
were covered with oyster-shells, in such abundance as entirely to
preclude the idea of their having been brought to such a position
by the natives. They were in every stage of petrification. <!--page 142 REMARKABLE CLIFFS. /page--> </p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon the old man joined us, and got
into the boat. As far as we could understand from his signs, we
were at no great distance from some remarkable change or other.
The river had been making to the N.W., from the commencement of
the fossil formation, and it appeared as if it was inclined to
keep that direction. The old man pointed to the N.W., and then
placed his hand on the side of his head to indicate, as I
understood him, that we should sleep to the N.W. of where we then
were; but his second motion was not so intelligible, for he
pointed due south, as if to indicate that such would be our
future course; and he concluded his information, such as it was,
by describing the roaring of the sea, and the height of the
waves. It was evident this old man had been upon the coast, and
we were therefore highly delighted at the prospect thus held out
to us of reaching it. </p>

<p>A little below the hills under which we had stopped, the
country again assumed a level. A line of cliffs, of from two to
three hundred feet in height, flanked the river, first on one
side and then on the other, varying in length from a quarter of a
mile to a mile. They rose perpendicularly from the water, and
were of a bright yellow colour, rendered still more vivid
occasionally by the sun shining full upon them. The summits of
these cliffs were as even as if they had been built by an
architect; and from their very edge, the country back from the
stream was of an uniform level, and was partly plain, and partly
clothed by brush. The soil upon this plateau, or table land, was
sandy, and it was as barren and <!--page 143 NATIVE CHARACTER. /page-->unproductive as the worst of the
country we had passed through. On the other hand, the alluvial
flats on the river increased in size, and were less subject to
flood; and the river lost much of its sandy bed, and its current
was greatly diminished in strength. </p>

<p>It blew so fresh, during the greater part of the day, from the
westward, that we had great difficulty in pulling against the
breeze. The determined N.W. course the river kept, made me doubt
the correctness of the story of the little old black; yet there
was an openness of manner about him, and a clearness of
description, that did not appear like fabrication. He pointed to
the S.S.W. when he left us, as the direction in which he would
again join us, thus confirming, without any apparent intention,
what he had stated with regard to the southerly course the river
was about to take. Among the natives who were with him, there was
another man of very different manners and appearance. Our friend
was small in stature, had piercing grey eyes, and was as quick as
lightning in his movements The other was tall, and grey headed;
anxious, yet unobtrusive; and confident, without the least
mixture of boldness. The study of the human character on many
occasions similar to this, during our intercourse with these
people, rude and uncivilized as they were, was not only pleasing,
but instructive. We found that the individuals of a tribe partook
of one general character, and that the whole of the tribe were
either decidedly quiet, or as decidedly disorderly. The whole of
the blacks left us when we started, <!--page 144 TAKE BEARINGS. /page-->but we had not gone very far,
when the individual I have described brought his family,
consisting of about fifteen persons. We were going down a part of
the river in which there was a very slight fall. The natives were
posted under some blue-gum trees, upon the right bank, and there
was a broad shoal of sand immediately to our left. They walked
over to this shoal, to receive some little presents, but did not
follow when we continued our journey. </p>

<p>During the whole of the day the river ran to the N.W. We
stopped for the night under some cliffs, similar to those we had
already passed, but somewhat higher. From their summit, mountains
were visible to the N.W., but at a great distance from us. I
doubted not that they were at the head of the southern gulfs; or
of one of them, at all events. Our observations placed us in 34°
08´ south of lat., and in long. 139° 41´ 15´´; we were
consequently nearly seventy miles from Spencer's Gulf, in a
direct line, and I should have given that as the distance the
hills appeared to be from us. They bore as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0">

        <td>Southern extremity scarcely visible . . </td>
        <td>S. 58° W.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The country between the river and these ranges appeared to be
very low, and darkly wooded: that to the N.E. was more open. The
summit of the cliff did not form any table-land, but it dipped
almost immediately to the westward, <!--page 145 FEAST ON A TORTOISE. /page-->and the country, although, as
I have already remarked, it was depressed, and undulated. </p>

<p>I walked to some distance from the river, across a valley, and
started several kangaroos; but I was quite alone, and could not,
therefore, secure one of them. Had the dogs been near, we should
have had a fine feast. The soil of the interior still continued
sandy, but there was a kind of short grass mixed with the
salsolaceous plants upon it, that indicated, as I thought, a
change for the better in the vegetation; and the circumstance of
there being kangaroos in the valleys to the westward was also a
favourable sign. </p>

<p>Beneath the cliffs hereabouts, the river was extremely broad
and deep. My servant thought it a good place for fishing and
accordingly set a night-line, one end of which he fastened to the
bough of a tree. During the night, being on guard, he saw a small
tortoise floating on the water, so near that he struck it a
violent blow with a large stick, upon which it dived: to his
surprise, however, in the morning, he found that it had taken the
bait, and was fast to the line. On examining it, the shell proved
to be cracked, so that the blow must have been a severe one. It
was the largest we had ever seen, and made an excellent dish. The
flesh was beautifully white, nor could anything, especially under
our circumstances, have been more tempting than it was when
cooked; yet M'Leay would not partake of it. </p>

<p>The prevailing wind was, at this time, from the S.W. It blew
heavily all day, but moderated towards the evening </p>

<p>I was very anxious, at starting on the 3rd, as to the <!--page 146 CHART OF THE RIVER. /page-->course
the river would take, since it would prove whether the little old
man had played us false or not. From the cliffs under which we
had slept, it held a direct N.W. course for two or three miles.
It then turned suddenly to the S.E., and gradually came round to
E.N.E., so that after two hours pulling, we found ourselves just
opposite to the spot from which we had started, the neck of land
that separated the channels not being more than 200 yards across.
I have before noticed a bend similar to this, which the Murray
makes, a little above the junction of the supposed Darling with
it. </p>

<p>It may appear strange to some of my readers, that I should
have laid down the windings of the river so minutely. It may
therefore be necessary for me to state that every bend of it was
laid down by compass, and that the bearings of the angles as they
opened were regularly marked by me, so that not a single winding
or curve of the Murray is omitted in the large chart. The length
of some of the reaches may be erroneous, but their direction is
strictly correct. I always had a sheet of paper and the compass
before me, and not only marked down the river line, but also the
description of country nearest; its most minute changes, its
cliffs, its flats, the kind of country back from it, its lagoons,
the places at which the tribes assembled, its junctions,
tributaries and creeks, together with our several positions, were
all regularly noted, so that on our return up the river we had no
difficulty in ascertaining upon what part of it we were, by a
reference to the chart; and it proved <!--page 147 REMARKABLE CLIFFS. /page-->of infinite service to us,
since we were enabled to judge of our distance from our several
camps, as we gained them day by day with the current against us;
and we should often have stopped short of them, weary and
exhausted, had we not known that two or three reaches more would
terminate our labour for the day. </p>

<p>From the spot last spoken of, the river held on a due south
course for the remainder of the day; and at the same time changed
its character. It lost its sandy bed and its current together,
and became deep, still, and turbid, with a muddy bottom. It
increased considerably in breadth, and stretched away before us
in magnificent reaches of from three to six miles in length. The
cliffs under which we passed towered above us, like maritime
cliffs, and the water dashed against their base like the waves of
the sea. They became brighter and brighter in colour, looking
like dead gold in the sun's rays; and formed an unbroken wall of
a mile or two in length. The natives on their summits showed as
small as crows; and the cockatoos, the eagles, and other birds,
were as specks above us; the former made the valley reverberate
with their harsh and discordant notes. The reader may form some
idea of the height of these cliffs, when informed that the king
of the feathered race made them his sanctuary. They were
continuous on both sides of the river, but retired, more or less,
from it, according to the extent of the alluvial flats. The river
held a serpentine course down the valley through which it passed,
striking the precipices alternately on each <!--page 148 REJOINED BY OUR OLD NATIVE GUIDE. /page-->side. The soil on the
flats was better, and less mixed with sand than it had been, but
the flats were generally covered with reeds, though certainly not
wholly subject to flood at any time. The polygonum still
prevailed upon them in places, and the blue-gum tree alone
occupied their outskirts. From the several elevations we
ascended, the country to the N.W. appeared undulating and well
wooded; that to the eastward, seemed to be brushy and low.
Certainly there was a great difference in the country, both to
the eastward and to the westward. We had frequent views of the
mountains we had seen, or, I should have said, of a continuation
of them. They bore nearly west from us at a very great distance
all day. </p>

<p>We fell in with several tribes, but did not see our old
friend, although, from the inquiries we made, it was evident he
was well known among them. It would disgust my readers were I to
describe the miserable state of disease and infirmity to which
these tribes were reduced. Leprosy of the most loathsome
description, the most violent cutaneous eruptions, and glandular
affections, absolutely raged through the whole of them; yet we
could not escape from the persecuting examination of our persons
that curiosity prompted them in some measure to insist upon. </p>

<p>The old man, whose information had proved strictly correct,
joined us again on the 4th, and his joy at being received into
the boat was unbounded, as well as the pleasure he expressed at
again meeting Hopkinson. He had been on a long journey, it would
appear, for he had not then reached his tribe. As we approached <!--page 149 DELAYED BY STRONG WINDS. /page-->their
haunt, he landed and preceded us to collect them. We were, of
course, more than usually liberal to so old a friend, and we were
really sorry to part with him. </p>

<p>Soon after leaving his tribe, which occupied the left bank of
the river, and was very weak in point of numbers, we fell in with
a very strong tribe upon the right bank. They numbered 211 in
all. We lay off the bank, in order to escape their importunities;
a measure that by no means satisfied them. The women appeared to
be very prolific; but, as a race, these people are not to be
compared with the natives of the mountains, or of the upper
branches of the Murray. </p>

<p>We passed some beautiful scenery in the course of the day. The
river preserved a direct southerly course, and could not in any
place have been less than 400 yards in breadth. The cliffs still
continued, and varied perpetually in form; at one time presenting
a perpendicular wall to the view, at others, they overhung the
stream, in huge fragments. All were composed of a mass of shells
of various kinds; a fact which will call for further observation
and remark. </p>

<p>Many circumstances at this time tended to confirm our hopes
that the sea could not be very far from us, or that we should not
be long in gaining it. Some sea-gulls flew over our heads, at
which Fraser was about to shoot, had I not prevented him, for I
hailed them as the messengers of glad tidings, and thought they
ill deserved such a fate. It blew very hard from the S.W., during
the whole of the day, and we found it extremely laborious pulling
against <!--page 150 NATIVES FEAR OUR DOGS. /page-->the heavy and short sea that came rolling up the broad
and open reaches of the Murray at this place. </p>

<p>Four of the blacks, from the last tribe, followed us, and
slept at the fires; but they were suspicious and timid, and
appeared to be very glad when morning dawned. Our fires were
always so much larger than those made by themselves, that, they
fancied, perhaps, we were going to roast them. Our dogs,
likewise, gave them great uneasiness; for although so fond of the
native brute, they feared ours, from their size. We generally
tied them to the boat, therefore, to prevent a recurrence of
theft, so that they were not altogether useless.</p>

<p>It now appeared that the Murray had taken a permanent
southerly course; indeed, it might strictly be said that it ran
away to the south. As we proceeded down it, the valley expanded
to the width of two miles; the alluvial flats became
proportionably larger; and a small lake generally occupied their
centre. They were extensively covered with reeds and grass, for
which reason, notwithstanding that they were little elevated
above the level of the stream, I do not think they are subject to
overflow. Parts of them may be laid under water, but certainly
not the whole. The rains at the head of the Murray, and its
tributaries, must be unusually severe to prolong their effects to
this distant <!--page 152 DELIGHTFUL COUNTRY. /page-->region, and the flats bordering it appear, by
successive depositions, to have only just gained a height above
the further influence of the floods. Should this prove to be the
case, the valley may be decidedly laid down as a most desirable
spot, whether we regard the richness of its soil, its rock
formation, its locality, or the extreme facility of water
communication along it. It must not, however, be forgotten or
concealed, that the summits of the cliffs by which the valley is
enclosed, have not a corresponding soil. On the contrary, many of
the productions common to the plains of the interior still
existed upon them, and they were decidedly barren; but as we
measured the reaches of the river, the cliffs ceased, and gave
place to undulating hills, that were very different in appearance
from the country we had previously noted down. It would have been
impossible for the most tasteful individual to have laid out
pleasure ground to more advantage, than Nature had done in
planting and disposing the various groups of trees along the
spine, and upon the sides of the elevations that confined the
river, and bounded the low ground that intervened between it and
their base. Still, however, the soil upon these elevations was
sandy, and coarse, but the large oat-grass was abundant upon
them, which yielded pasture at least as good as that in the
broken country between Underaliga and Morumbidgee. </p>

<p>We had now gained a distance of at least sixty miles from that
angle of the Murray at which it reaches its extreme west. The
general aspect of the country to our right was beautiful, and
several valleys branched away into the <!--page 153 ADVERSE GALES. /page-->interior upon that side
which had a most promising appearance, and seemed to abound with
kangaroos, as the traces of them were numerous, and the dogs
succeeded in killing one, which, to our great mortification, we
could not find. </p>

<p>While, however, the country to the westward had so much to
recommend it, the hills to our left became extremely bare. It was
evident that the right was the sheltered side of the valley. The
few trees on the opposite side bent over to the N.E., as if under
the influence of some prevailing wind. </p>

<p>We experienced at this time a succession of gales from the
S.W., against which we, on several occasions, found it useless to
contend: the waves on the river being heavy and short; and the
boat, driving her prow into them, sent the spray over us and soon
wet us through. Indeed, it is difficult for the reader to imagine
the heavy swell that rolled up the river, which had increased in
breadth to the third of a mile, and in the length of its reaches
to eight or ten. I was satisfied that we were not only navigating
this river at a particularly stormy, perhaps <i>the</i> stormy,
season; but also, that the influence of the S.W. wind is felt
even as far in the interior as to the supposed Darling; in
consequence of the uniform build of the huts, and the
circumstance of their not only facing the N.E., but also being
almost invariably erected under the lee of some bush. </p>

<p>The weather, under the influence of the wind we experienced,
was cool and pleasant, although the thermometer stood at a medium
height of 86°; but we found it very dis<!--page 154 OBLIGED TO TAKE REPOSE. /page-->tressing to pull against
the heavy breezes that swept up the valley, and bent the reeds so
as almost to make them kiss the stream. </p>

<p>We communicated on the 6th and 7th with several large tribes
of natives, whose manners were on the whole quiet and
inoffensive. They distinctly informed us, that we were fast
approaching the sea, and, from what I could understand, we were
nearer to it than the coast line of Encounter Bay made us. We had
placed sticks to ascertain if there was any rise or fall of tide,
but the troubled state of the river prevented our experiments
from being satisfactory. By selecting a place, however, that was
sheltered from the effects of the wind, we ascertained that there
was an apparent rise of about eight inches. </p>

<p>It blew a heavy gale during the whole of the 7th; and we
laboured in vain at the oar. The gusts that swept the bosom of
the water, and the swell they caused, turned the boat from her
course, and prevented us from making an inch of way. The men were
quite exhausted, and, as they had conducted themselves so well,
and had been so patient, I felt myself obliged to grant them
every indulgence consistent with our safety. However precarious
our situation, it would have been vain, with our exhausted
strength, to have contended against the elements. We, therefore,
pulled in to the left bank of the river, and pitched our tents on
a little rising ground beyond the reeds that lined it. </p>

<p>I had been suffering very much front tooth-ache for the <!--page 155 CHRONOMETER BROKEN. /page-->last
three or four days, and this day felt the most violent pain from
the wind. I was not, therefore, sorry to get under even the poor
shelter our tents afforded. M'Leay, observing that I was in
considerable pain, undertook to wind up the chronometer; but, not
understanding or knowing the instrument, he unfortunately broke
the spring. I shall not forget the anxiety he expressed, and the
regret he felt on the occasion; nor do I think M'Leay recovered
the shock this unlucky accident gave him for two or three days,
or until the novelty of other scenes drove it from his
recollection. </p>

<p>We landed close to the haunt of a small tribe of natives, who
came to us with the most perfect confidence, and assisted the men
in their occupations. They were cleaner and more healthy than any
tribe we had seen; and were extremely cheerful, although reserved
in some respects. As a mark of more than usual cleanliness, the
women had mats of oval shape, upon which they sat, made,
apparently, of rushes. There was a young girl among them of a
most cheerful disposition. She was about eighteen, was well made,
and really pretty. This girl was married to an elderly man who
had broken his leg, which having united in a bent shape, the limb
was almost useless. I really believe the girl thought we could
cure her husband, from her importunate manner to us. I regretted
that I could do nothing for the man, but to show that I was not
inattentive to her entreaties, I gave him a pair of trousers, and
desired Fraser to put them upon him; but the poor fellow <!--page 156 APPEARANCE OF SOME /page-->cut so
awkward an appearance in them, that his wife became quite
distressed, and Fraser was obliged speedily to disencumber him
from them again. </p>

<p>We could not gain any satisfactory information, as to the
termination of the river, from these people. It was evident that
some change was at hand; but what it was we could not ascertain. </p>

<p>On the morning of the 9th, we left our fair friend and her
lame husband, and proceeded down the river. The wind had
moderated, although it still blew fresh. We ascended every height
as we went along, but could not see any new feature in the
country. Our view to the eastward was very confined; to the
westward the interior was low and dark, and was backed in the
distance by lofty ranges, parallel to which we had been running
for some days. The right bank of the valley was beautifully
undulated, but the left was bleak and bare. The valley had a
breadth of from three to four miles, and the flats were more
extensive under the former than under the latter. They were
scarcely two feet above the level of the water, and were densely
covered with reeds. As there was no mark upon the reeds to
indicate the height to which the floods rose, I cannot think that
these flats are ever wholly laid under water; if they are, it
cannot be to any depth: at all events a few small drains would
effectually prevent inundation. The soil upon the hills continued
to be much mixed with sand, and the prevailing trees were cypress
and box. Among the minor shrubs and grass, many common to the <!--page 157 APPROACHING CHANGE. /page-->east
coasts were noticed; and although the bold cliffs had ceased, the
basis of the country still continued of the fossil formation. At
a turn of the stream hereabouts, however, a solitary rock of
coarse red granite rose above the waters, and formed an island in
its centre; but only in this one place was it visible. The rock
was composed principally of quartz and feldspar. </p>

<p>A little below it, we found a large tribe anxiously awaiting
our arrival. They crowded to the margin of the river with great
eagerness, and evinced more surprise at our appearance than any
tribe we had seen during the journey; but we left them very soon,
notwithstanding that they importuned us much to stay. </p>

<p>After pulling a mile or two, we found a clear horizon before
us to the south. The hills still continued upon our left, but we
could not see any elevation over the expanse of reeds to our
right. The river inclined to the left, and swept the base of the
hills that still continued on that side. I consequently landed
once more to survey the country. </p>

<p>I still retained a strong impression on my mind that some
change was at hand, and on this occasion, I was not disappointed;
but the view was one for which I was not altogether prepared. We
had, at length, arrived at the termination of the Murray.
Immediately below me was a beautiful lake, which appeared to be a
fitting reservoir for the noble stream that had led us to it; and
which was now ruffled by the breeze that swept over it. The
ranges were more distinctly visible, stretching from south to
north, and were cer<!--page 158 TERMINATION OF THE MURRAY /page-->tainly distant forty miles. They had a regular
unbroken outline; declining gradually to the south, but
terminating abruptly at a lofty mountain northerly. I had no
doubt on my mind of this being the Mount Lofty of Captain
Flinders; or that the range was that immediately to the eastward
of St. Vincent's Gulf&mdash;Since the accident to the
chronometer, we had not made any westing, so that we knew our
position as nearly as possible. Between us and the ranges a
beautiful promontory shot into the lake, being a continuation of
the right bank of the Murray. Over this promontory the waters
stretched to the base of the ranges, and formed an extensive bay.
To the N.W. the country was exceedingly low, but distant peaks
were just visible over it. To the S.W. a bold headland showed
itself; beyond which, to the westward, there was a clear and open
sea visible, through a strait formed by this headland and a point
projecting from the opposite shore. To the E. and S.E. the
country was low, excepting the left shore of the lake, which was
backed by some minor elevations, crowned with cypresses. Even
while gazing on this fine scene, I could not but regret that the
Murray had thus terminated; for I immediately foresaw that, in
all probability, we should be disappointed in finding any
practicable communication between the lake and the ocean, as it
was evident that the former was not much influenced by tides. The
wind had again increased; it still blew fresh from the S.W. and a
heavy sea was rolling direct into the mouth of the river. I
hoped, notwithstanding, that we should have been enabled to <!--page 159 IN A LARGE LAKE. /page-->make
sail, for which reason we entered the lake about 2 p.m. The
natives had kindled a large fire on a distant point between us
and the further headland, and to gain this point our efforts were
now directed. The waves were, however, too strong, and we were
obliged to make for the eastern shore, until such time as the
weather should moderate. We pitched our tents on a low track of
land that stretched away seemingly for many miles directly behind
us to the eastward. It was of the richest soil, being a black
vegetable deposit, and although now high above the influence, the
lake had, it was evident, once formed a part of its bed. The
appearance of the country altogether encouraged M'Leay and myself
to walk out, in order to examine it from some hills a little to
the S.E. of the camp. From them we observed that the flat
extended over about fifty miles, and was bounded by the
elevations that continued easterly from the left bank of the
Murray to the north, and by a line of rising-ground to the south.
The whole was lightly wooded, and covered with grass. The season
must have been unusually dry, judging from the general appearance
of the vegetation, and from the circumstance of the lagoons in
the interior being wholly exhausted. </p>

<p>Thirty-three days had now passed over our heads since we left
the depot upon the Morumbidgee, twenty-six of which had been
passed upon the Murray. We had, at length, arrived at the grand
reservoir of those waters whose course and fate had previously
been involved in such obscurity. It remained for us to ascertain
whether the extensive sheet of water upon whose bosom we had
embarked, had any <!--page 160 DETAINED BY THE WIND. /page-->practicable communication with the ocean, and
whether the country in the neighbourhood of the coast
corresponded with that immediately behind our camp, or kept up
its sandy and sterile character to the very verge of the sea. As
I have already said, my hopes on the first of these points were
considerably damped, but I could not help anticipating a
favourable change in the latter, since its features had so
entirely changed. </p>

<p>The greatest difficulty against which we had at present to
contend was the wind; and I dreaded the exertion it would call
for, to make head against it; for the men were so much reduced
that I felt convinced they were inadequate to any violent or
prolonged effort. It still blew fresh at 8 p.m., but at that time
it began to moderate. It may be imagined that I listened to its
subdued gusts with extreme anxiety. It did not wholly abate until
after 2 a.m., when it gradually declined, and about 3 a light
breeze sprung up from the N. E. </p>

<p>We had again placed sticks to ascertain with more precision
the rise of tide, and found it to be the same as in the river. In
the stillness of the night too we thought we heard the roaring of
the sea, but I was myself uncertain upon the point, as the wind
might have caused the sound. </p>

<p>From the top of the hill from which we had obtained our first
view of the lake, I observed the waves breaking upon the distant
headland, and enveloping the cliff in spray; so that, independent
of the clearness of the horizon beyond it, I was further led to
conclude that there <!--page 161 GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. /page-->existed a great expanse of water to the S.W.;
and, as that had been the direction taken by the river, I thought
it probable that by steering at once to the S.W. down the lake, I
should hit the outlet. I, consequently, resolved to gain the
southern extremity of the lake, as that at which it was natural
to expect a communication with the ocean would be found. </p>

<p>At 4 we had a moderate breeze, and it promised to strengthen;
we lost no time therefore in embarking, and with a flowing sheet
stretched over to the W.S.W., and ran along the promontory formed
by the right bank of the Murray. We passed close under its
extreme point at nine. The hills had gradually declined, and we
found the point to be a flat, elevated about thirty feet above
the lake. It was separated from the promontory by a small channel
that was choked up with reeds, so that it is more than probable
that the point is insulated at certain periods; whilst in its
stratification it resembled the first cliffs I have described
that were passed below the Darling. It is a remarkable fact in
the geology of the Murray, that such should be the case; and that
the formation at each extremity of the great bank or bed of
fossils should be the same. Thus far, the waters of the lake had
continued sweet; but on filling a can when we were abreast of
this point, it was found that they were quite unpalatable, to say
the least of them. The transition from fresh to salt water was
almost immediate, and it was fortunate we made the discovery in
sufficient time to prevent our losing ground. But, as it was, we
filled our <!--page 162 PASSAGE ACROSS THE LAKE. /page-->casks, and stood on, without for a moment altering our
course. </p>

<p>It is difficult to give a just description of our passage
across the lake. The boisterous weather we had had seemed to have
blown over. A cool and refreshing breeze was carrying us on at
between four and five knots an hour, and the heavens above us
were without a cloud. It almost appeared as if nature had
resisted us in order to try our perseverance, and that she had
yielded in pity to our efforts. The men, relieved for a time from
the oar, stretched themselves at their length in the boat, and
commented on the scenery around them, or ventured their opinions
as to that which was before them. Up to this moment their conduct
had been most exemplary; not a murmur had escaped from them, and
they filled the water-casks with the utmost cheerfulness, even
whilst tasting the disagreeable beverage they would most probably
have to subsist on for the next three or four days. </p>

<p>As soon as we had well opened the point, we had a full view of
the splendid bay that, commencing at the western most of the
central points, swept in a beautiful curve under the ranges. No
land was visible to the W.N.W. or to the S.S.W.: in both these
quarters the lake was as open as the ocean. It appeared,
therefore, that the land intermediate was an island. To the north
the country was extremely low, and as we increased our distance
from it we lost sight of it altogether. At noon we were nearly
abreast of the eastern headland, or in the centre of the strait
to which I <!--page 163 ITS SHALLOWNESS. /page-->have alluded. At this time there was an open sea from
W.N.W. to N. by E. A meridian altitude gave our latitude 35°
25´. The land to our left was bold and precipitous; that to the
right was low and wooded; and there was evidently a considerable
space between the shores of the lake and the base of the ranges.
The country to the eastward was hidden from us by the line of
cliffs, beyond which from E.S.E. to W.S.W. there was an open sea.
We had kept the lead going from the first, and I was surprised at
the extreme shallowness of the lake in every part, as we never
had six feet upon the line. Its bottom was one of black mud, and
weeds of enormous length were floating on its surface, detached
by the late gales, and which, from the shallowness of the lake,
got constantly entangled with our rudder. </p>

<p>We tried to land on the eastern point, but found the water too
shallow, and were obliged to try the western shore. In passing
close under the head, we observed several natives upon it, who
kindled a large fire as soon as they saw they were noticed, which
was answered from every point; for, in less than ten minutes
afterwards, we counted no fewer than fourteen different fires,
the greater number of which were on the side of the ranges. </p>

<p>As we were standing across from one shore to the other, our
attention was drawn to a most singular object. It started
suddenly up, as above the waters to the south, and strikingly
resembled an isolated castle. Behind it, a dense column of smoke
rose into the sky, and the effect was <!--page 164 SHORES OF THE LAKE. /page-->most remarkable. On a
nearer approach, the phantom disappeared and a clear and open sea
again presented itself to our view. The fact was, that the
refractive power upon the coast had elevated the sand-hillocks
above their true position, since we satisfactorily ascertained
that they alone separated the lake from the ocean, and that they
alone could have produced the semblance we noticed. It is a
singular fact, that this very hillock was the one which Capt.
Barker ascended whilst carrying on the survey of the south coast,
and immediately previous to his tragical death. </p>

<p>It was not without difficulty that we succeeded in landing on
the western shore; but we did, at length, succeed, and prepared
our dinners. The shore was low, but above the reach of all
floods; the soil was rich, and superficially sandy. It was
covered with high grasses, and abounded in kangaroos; within the
space of a few yards we found five or six, but they were
immediately lost to us and to the dogs in the luxuriance of the
vegetation amidst which they were feeding. </p>

<p>As soon as we had finished our meal, we once more embarked,
and stood along the shore to the S.W., but the lake was so shoal,
that I was every moment apprehensive we should ground. I ran
across, therefore, to the south, towards a low flat that had just
appeared above the line of the horizon, in hope that, in
sounding, we should have found the channel, but there either was
none, or else it was so narrow that we passed over it between the
heaves of the lead. At this time, the western shore was quite
distinct, and the scenery was beautiful. <!--page 165 WARLIKE DEMEANOUR OF THE NATIVES. /page--> </p>

<p>The flat we were approaching was a mud-flat, and, from its
appearance, the tide was certainly at the ebb. We observed some
cradles, or wicker frames, placed far below high water-mark, that
were each guarded by two natives, who threatened us violently as
we approached. In running along the land, the stench from them
plainly indicated what they were which these poor creatures were
so anxiously watching. </p>

<p>We steered a S.W. course, towards some low and wooded hills,
passing a rocky island, and found that we had struck the mouth of
a channel running to the W.S.W. It was about half-a-mile wide,
was bounded to the right by some open flat ground, and to the
left by a line of hills of about sixty or seventy feet in
elevation, partly open and partly covered with beefwood. </p>

<p>Upon the first of these hills, we observed a large body of
natives, who set up the most terrific yells as we approached.
They were fully equipped for battle and, as we neared the shore,
came down to meet us with the most violent threats. I wished much
to communicate with them, and, not without hopes of quieting
them, stood right in with the intention of landing. I observed,
however, that if I did so, I should have to protect myself. I
hauled a little off, and endeavoured, by holding up a branch and
a tomahawk, to gain their confidence, but they were not to be won
over by my show of pacification. An elderly man walked close to
the water's edge unarmed, and, evidently, directed the others. He
was followed by seven or eight of <!--page 166 LOVELY EVENING. /page-->the most daring, who crept into
the reeds, with their spears shipped to throw at us. I,
therefore, took up my gun to return their salute. It then
appeared that they were perfectly aware of the weapon I carried,
for the moment they saw it, they dashed out of their hiding place
and retreated to the main body; but the old man, after saying
something to them, walked steadily on, and I, on my part, laid my
firelock down again. </p>

<p>It was now near sunset; and one of the most lovely evenings I
had ever seen. The sun's radiance was yet upon the mountains, but
all lower objects were in shade. The banks of the channel, with
the trees and the rocks, were reflected in the tranquil waters,
whose surface was unruffled save by the thousands of wild fowl
that rose before us, and made a noise as of a multitude clapping
hands, in their clumsy efforts to rise from the waters. Not one
of them allowed us to get within shot. </p>

<p>We proceeded about a mile below the hill on which the natives
were posted; some few still following us with violent threats. We
landed, however, on a flat, bounded all round by the continuation
of the hills. It was an admirable position, for, in the centre of
it, we could not be taken by surprise, and, on the other hand, we
gave the natives an opportunity of communicating with us if they
would. The full moon rose as we were forming the camp, and,
notwithstanding our vicinity to so noisy a host, the silence of
death was around us, or the stillness of the night was only
broken by the roar of the ocean, now too near to be mistaken for <!--page 167 EXTENT OF THE LAKE. /page-->wind,
or by the silvery and melancholy note of the black swans as they
passed over us, to seek for food, no doubt, among the slimy weeds
at the head of the lake. We had been quite delighted with the
beauty of the channel, which was rather more than half-a-mile in
width. Numberless mounds, that seemed to invite civilized man to
erect his dwelling upon them, presented themselves to our view.
The country round them was open, yet ornamentally wooded, and
rocks and trees hung or drooped over the waters. </p>

<p>We had in one day gained a position I once feared it would
have cost us infinite labour to have measured. Indeed, had we
been obliged to pull across the lake, unless during a calm, I am
convinced the men would have been wholly exhausted. We had to
thank a kind Providence that such was not the case, since it had
extended its mercy to us at so critical a moment. We had indeed
need of all the little strength we had remaining, and could ill
have thrown it away on such an effort as this would have
required. I calculated that we could not have run less than
forty-five miles during the day, a distance that, together with
the eight miles we had advanced the evening previously, would
give the length of the lake at fifty-three miles. We had
approached to within twelve miles of the ranges, but had not
gained their southern extremity. From the camp, Mount Barker bore
nearly north. The ranges appeared to run north and south to our
position, and then to bend away to the S.S.W., gradually
declining to that point, <!--page 168 CHANNEL TO THE SEA. /page-->which I doubted not terminated in Cape
Jervis. The natives kept aloof during the night, nor did the dogs
by a single growl intimate that any had ventured to approach us.
The sound of the surf came gratefully to our ears, for it told us
we were near the goal for which we had so anxiously pushed, and
we all of us promised ourselves a view of the boundless ocean on
the morrow. </p>

<p>As the morning dawned, we saw that the natives had thrown an
out-post of sixteen men across the channel, who were watching our
motions; but none showed themselves on the hills behind us, or on
any part of the south shore. We embarked as soon as we had
breakfasted, A fresh breeze was blowing from the N.E. which took
us rapidly down the channel, and our prospects appeared to be as
cheering as the day, for just as we were about to push from the
shore, a seal rose close to the boat, which we all regarded as a
favourable omen. We were, however, shortly stopped by shoals; it
was in vain that we beat across the channel from one side to the
other; it was a continued shoal, and the deepest water appeared
to be under the left bank. The tide, however, had fallen, and
exposed broad flats, over which it was hopeless, under existing
circumstances, to haul the boat. We again landed on the south
side of the channel, patiently to await the high water. </p>

<p>M'Leay, myself, and Fraser, ascended the hills, and went to
the opposite side to ascertain the course of the channel, for
immediately above us it turned south round the hills. We there
found that we were on a narrow tongue <!--page 169 ITS SHALLOWNESS. /page-->of land. The channel was
immediately below us, and continued to the E.S.E. as far as we
could trace it. The hills we were upon, were the sandy hills that
always bound a coast that is low, and were covered with banksias,
casuarina and the grass-tree. </p>

<p>To the south of the channel there was a flat, backed by a
range of sand-hummocks, that were covered with low shrubs; and
beyond them the sea was distinctly visible. We could not have
been more than two and a half miles from the beach where we
stood. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the sandy nature of the soil, the fossil
formation again showed itself, not only on these hills, but also
on the rocks that were in the channel. </p>

<p>A little before high water we again embarked. A seal had been
observed playing about, and we augured well from such an omen.
The blacks had been watching us from the opposite shore, and as
soon as we moved, rose to keep abreast of us. With all our
efforts we could not avoid the shoals. We walked up to our knees
in mud and water, to find the least variation in the depth of the
water so as to facilitate our exertions, but it was to no
purpose. We were ultimately obliged to drag the boat over the
flats; there were some of them a quarter of a mile in breadth,
knee-deep in mud; but at length got her into deep water again.
The turn of the channel was now before us, and we had a good run
for about four or five miles. We had completed the bend, and the
channel now stretched to the E.S.E. At about nine miles from us
there was a bright <!--page 170 BEACH OF ENCOUNTER BAY. /page-->sand-hill visible, near which the channel
seemed to turn again to the south; and I doubted not that it
terminated there. It was to no purpose, however, that we tried to
gain it. Shoals again closed in upon us on every side. We dragged
the boat over several, and at last got amongst quicksands. I,
therefore, directed our efforts to hauling the boat over to the
south side of the channel, as that on which we could most
satisfactorily ascertain our position. After great labour we
succeeded, and, as evening had closed in, lost no time in
pitching the tents. </p>

<p>While the men were thus employed, I took Fraser with me, and,
accompanied by M'Leay, crossed the sand-hummocks behind us, and
descended to the sea-shore. I found that we had struck the south
coast deep in the bight of Encounter Bay. We had no time for
examination, but returned immediately to the camp, as I intended
to give the men an opportunity to go to the beach. They
accordingly went and bathed, and returned not only highly
delighted at this little act of good nature on my part, but
loaded with cockles, a bed of which they had managed to find
among the sand. Clayton had tied one end of his shirt up, and
brought a bag full, and amused himself with boiling cockles all
night long. </p>

<p>If I had previously any hopes of being enabled ultimately to
push the boat over the flats that were before us, a view of the
channel at low water, convinced me of the impracticability of any
further attempt. The water was so low that every shoal was
exposed, and many stretched directly <!--page 171 CURIOUS EFFECT OF REFRACTION. /page-->from one side of the channel
to the other; and, but for the treacherous nature of the
sand-banks, it would not have been difficult to have walked over
dry footed to the opposite side of it. The channel stretched away
to the E.S.E., to a distance of seven or eight miles, when it
appeared to turn south under a small sand-hill, upon which the
rays of the sun fell, as it was sinking behind us. </p>

<p>There was an innumerable flock of wild-fowl arranged in rows
along the sides of the pools left by the tide, and we were again
amused by the singular effect of the refraction upon them, and
the grotesque and distorted forms they exhibited. Swans,
pelicans, ducks, and geese, were mingled together, and, according
to their distance from us, presented different appearances. Some
were exceedingly tall and thin, others were unnaturally broad.
Some appeared reversed, or as if they were standing on their
heads, and the slightest motion, particularly the flapping of
their wings, produced a most ridiculous effect. No doubt, the
situation and the state of the atmosphere were favourable to the
effect I have described. The day had been fine, the evening was
beautiful,&mdash;but it was the rarefaction of the air
immediately playing on the ground, and not the haze at sunset
that caused what I have noticed. It is distinct from mirage,
although it is difficult to point out the difference. The one,
however, distorts, the other conceals objects, and gives them a
false distance. The one is clear, the other is cloudy. The one
raises objects above their true position, the other does not. The
one plays about, the other <!--page 172 CRITICAL SITUATION /page-->is steady; but I cannot hope to give a
proper idea either of mirage or refraction so satisfactorily as I
could wish. Many travellers have dwelt upon their effects,
particularly upon those of the former, but few have attempted to
account for them. </p>

<p>Our situation was one of peculiar excitement and interest. To
our right the thunder of the heavy surf, that almost shook the
ground beneath us, broke with increasing roar upon our ears; to
our left the voice of the natives echoed through the brush, and
the size of their fires at the extremity of the channel, seemed
to indicate the alarm our appearance had occasioned. </p>

<p>While the men were enjoying their cockles, a large kettle of
which they had boiled, M'Leay and I were anxiously employed in
examining the state of our provisions, and in ascertaining what
still remained. Flour and tea were the only articles we had left,
so that the task was not a difficult one. It appeared that we had
not sufficient of either to last us to Pondebadgery, at which
place we expected to find supplies; and, taking every thing into
consideration, our circumstances were really critical. </p>

<p>The first view of Encounter Bay had convinced me that no
vessel would ever venture into it at a season when the S.W. winds
prevailed. It was impossible that we could remain upon the coast
in expectation of the relief that I doubted not had been hurried
off for us; since disappointment would have sealed our fate at
once. In the deep bight in which we were, I could not hope that
any vessel <!--page 173 OF THE PARTY. /page-->would approach sufficiently near to be seen by us. Our
only chance of attracting notice would have been by crossing the
Ranges to the Gulf St. Vincent, but the men had not strength to
walk, and I hesitated to divide my party in the presence of a
determined and numerous enemy, who closely watched our motions.
Setting aside the generous feelings that had prompted M'Leay to
participate in every danger with me, and who I am persuaded would
have deeply felt a separation, my anxiety not only on his
account, but on account of the men I might leave in charge of the
boat, made me averse to this measure; the chance of any
misfortune to them involving in it the destruction of our boat
and the loss of our provisions. My anxiety of mind would have
rendered me unfit for exertion; yet so desirous was I of
examining the ranges and the country at their base, that I
should, had our passage to the salt water been uninterrupted,
have determined on coasting it homewards, or of steering for
Launceston; and most assuredly, with my present experience, I
would rather incur the hazards of so desperate a step, than
contend against all the evils that beset us on out homeward
journey. And the reader may rest assured, I was as much without
hopes of our eventual safety, as I was astonished, at the close
of our labours, to find that they had terminated so happily. </p>

<p>Further exertion on the part of the men being out of the
question, I determined to remain no longer on the coast than to
enable me to trace the channel to its actual junction <!--page 174 INSPECTION OF THE CHANNEL /page-->with the
sea, and to ascertain the features of the coast at that important
point. I was reluctant to exhaust the strength of the men in
dragging the boat over the numberless flats that were before us,
and made up my mind to walk along the shore until I should gain
the outlet. I at length arranged that M'Leay, I, and Fraser,
should start on this excursion, at the earliest dawn, leaving
Harris and Hopkinson in charge of the camp; for as we were to go
towards the position of the natives, I thought it improbable they
would attack the camp without my being instantly aware of it. </p>

<p>We had, as I have said, intended starting at the earliest
dawn, but the night was so clear and refreshing, and the moon so
bright that we determined to avail ourselves of both, and
accordingly left the tents at 3 a.m. I directed Harris to strike
them at 8, and to have every thing in readiness for our departure
at that hour. We then commenced our excursion, and I led my
companions rapidly along the shore of Encounter Bay, after
crossing the sand-hills about a mile below the camp. After a
hasty and distressing walk of about seven miles, we found that
the sand-hills terminated, and a low beach spread before us. The
day was just breaking, and at the distance of a mile from us we
saw the sand-hill I have already had occasion to notice, and at
about a quarter of a mile from its base, we were checked by the
channel; which, as I rightly conjectured, being stopped in its
easterly course by some rising ground, the tongue of land on
which the blacks were posted, sud<!--page 175 FROM THE LAKE TO THE OCEAN. /page-->denly turns south, and, striking
this sand-hill, immediately enters the sea; and we noticed, in
the bight under the rising ground, that the natives had lit a
chain of small fires. This was, most probably, a detached party
watching our movements, as they could, from where they were
posted, see our camp. </p>

<p>At the time we arrived at the end of the channel, the tide had
turned, and was again setting in. The entrance appeared to me to
be somewhat less than a quarter of a mile in breadth. Under the
sand-hill on the off side, the water is deep and the current
strong. No doubt, at high tide, a part of the low beach we had
traversed is covered. The mouth of the channel is defended by a
double line of breakers, amidst which, it would be dangerous to
venture, except in calm and summer weather; and the line of foam
is unbroken from one end of Encounter Bay to the other. Thus were
our fears of the impracticability and inutility of the channel of
communication between the lake and the ocean confirmed. </p>

<p>I would fain have lingered on my way, to examine, as far as
circumstances would permit, the beautiful country between the
lake and the ranges; and it was with heart-felt sorrow that I
yielded to necessity. My men were indeed very weak from poverty
of diet and from great bodily fatigue. Hopkinson, Mulholland, and
Macnamee were miserably reduced. The two former, especially, had
exerted themselves beyond their strength, and although I am
confident they would have obeyed my orders to the last, I did <!--page 176 DIFFICULTIES OF THE RETURN. /page-->not
feel myself justified, considering the gigantic task we had
before us, to impose additional labour upon them. </p>

<p>It will be borne in mind that our difficulties were just about
to commence, when those of most other travellers have ceased; and
that instead of being assisted by the stream whose course we had
followed, we had now to contend against the united waters of the
eastern ranges, with diminished strength, and, in some measure,
with disappointed feelings. </p>

<p>Under the most favourable circumstances, it was improbable
that the men would be enabled to pull for many days longer in
succession; since they had not rested upon their oars for a
single day, if I except our passage across the lake, from the
moment when we started from the depot; nor was it possible for me
to buoy them up with the hope even of a momentary cessation from
labour. We had calculated the time to which our supply of
provisions would last under the most favourable circumstances,
and it was only in the event of our pulling up against the
current, day after day, the same distance we had compassed with
the current in our favour, that we could hope they would last us
as long as we continued in the Murray. But in the event of
floods, or any unforeseen delay, in was impossible to calculate
at what moment we might be driven to extremity. </p>

<p>Independent of these casualties, there were other
circumstances of peril to be taken into consideration. As I have
already observed, I foresaw great danger in again running <!--page 177 DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS OF THE RETURN. /page-->through
the natives. I had every reason to believe that many of the
tribes with which we had communicated on apparently friendly
terms, regretted having allowed us to pass unmolested; nor was I
at all satisfied as to the treatment we might receive from them,
when unattended by the envoys who had once or twice controlled
their fury. Our best security, therefore, against the attacks of
the natives was celerity of movement; and the men themselves
seemed to be perfectly aware of the consequences of delay. Our
provisions, moreover, being calculated to last to a certain point
only, the slightest accident, the staving-in of the boat, or the
rise of the river, would inevitably be attended with calamity. To
think of reducing our rations of only three quarters of a pound
of flour per diem, was out of the question, or to hope that the
men, with less sustenance than that, would perform the work
necessary to ensure their safety, would have been unreasonable.
It was better that our provisions should hold out to a place from
which we might abandon the boat with some prospect of reaching by
an effort a stock station, or the plain on which Robert Harris
was to await our return, than that they should be consumed before
the half of our homeward journey should be accomplished. Delay,
therefore, under our circumstances, would have been imprudent and
unjustifiable. </p>

<p>On the other hand, it was sufficiently evident to me, that the
men were too much exhausted to perform the task that was before
them without assistance, and that it would be necessary both for
M'Leay and myself, to take our share of <!--page 178 PATIENCE OF THE MEN. /page-->labour at the oars. The
cheerfulness and satisfaction that my young friend evinced at the
opportunity that was thus afforded him of making himself useful,
and of relieving those under him from some portion of their toil,
at the same time that they increased my sincere esteem for him,
were nothing more than what I expected from one who had
endeavoured by every means in his power to contribute to the
success of that enterprise upon which he had embarked. But
although I have said thus much of the exhausted condition of the
men,&mdash;and ere these pages are concluded my readers will
feel satisfied as to the truth of my statement&mdash;I would
by no means be understood to say that they flagged for a moment,
or that a single murmur escaped them. No reluctance was visible,
no complaint was heard, but there was that in their aspect and
appearance which they could not hide, and which I could not
mistake. My object in dwelling so long upon this subject has been
to point out our situation and our feelings when we re-entered
the Murray. The only circumstance that appeared to be in our
favour was the prevalence of the south-west wind, by which I
hoped we should be assisted in running up the first broad reaches
of that river. I could not but acknowledge the bounty of that
Providence, which had favoured us in our passage across the lake,
and I was led to hope that its merciful superintendance would
protect us from evil, and would silently direct us where human
foresight and prudence failed. We re-entered the river on the
13th under as fair prospects as we would have desired. The gale
which had blown with <!--page 179 RE-ENTER THE MURRAY. /page-->such violence in the morning gradually
abated, and a steady breeze enabled us to pass our first
encampment by availing ourselves of it as long as day light
continued. Both the valley and the river showed to advantage as
we approached them, and the scenery upon our left (the proper
right bank of the Murray) was really beautiful.</p>

<p>The valley of the Murray, at its entrance, cannot be less than
four miles in breadth. The river does not occupy the centre but
inclines to either side, according to its windings, and thus the
flats are of greater or less extent, according to the distance of
the river from the base of the hills. It is to be remarked, that
the bottom of the valley is extremely level, and extensively
covered with reeds. From the latter circumstance, one would be
led to infer that these flats are subject to overflow, and no
doubt can exist as to the fact of their being, at least
partially, if not wholly, under water <!--page 181 VALLEY OF THE MURRAY. /page-->at times. A country in a
state of nature is, however, so different from one in a state of
cultivation, that it is hazardous to give an opinion as to its
practical availableness, if I may use such a term. I should,
undoubtedly, say the marshes of the Macquarie were frequently
covered with water, and that they were wholly unfit for any one
purpose whatever. It is evident from the marks of the reeds upon
the banks, that the flood covers them occasionally to the depth
of three feet, and the reeds are so densely embodied and so close
to the river side that the natives cannot walk along it. The
reeds are the broad flag-reed (arundo phragmatis), and grow on a
stiff earthy loam, without any accompanying vegetation; indeed,
they form so solid a mass that the sun cannot penetrate to the
ground to nourish vegetation. On the other hand, the valley of
the Murray, though covered with reeds in most places, is not so
in all. There is no mark upon the reeds by which to judge as to
the height of inundation, neither are they of the same kind as
those which cover the marshes of the Macquarie. They are the
species of round reed of which the South-sea islanders make their
arrows, and stand sufficiently open, not only to allow of a
passage through, but for the abundant growth of grass among them.
Still, I have no doubt that parts of the valley are subject to
flood; but, as I have already remarked, I do not know whether
these parts are either deeply or frequently covered. Rain must
fall simultaneously in the S.E. angle of the island in the
inter-tropical regions, and at the heads <!--page 182 VALLEY OF THE MURRAY. /page-->of all the tributaries
of the main stream, ere its effects can be felt in the lower
parts of the Murray. If the valley of the Murray is not subject
to flood, it has only recently gained a height above the
influence of the river, and still retains all the character of
flooded land. In either case, however, it contains land that is
of the very richest kind&mdash;soil that is the pure
accumulation of vegetable matter, and is as black as ebony. If
its hundreds of thousands of acres were practically available, I
should not hesitate to pronounce it one of the richest spots of
equal extent on earth, and highly favoured in other respects. How
far it is available remains to be proved; and an opinion upon
either side would be hazardous, although that of its liability to
flood would, most probably, be nearest to truth. It is, however,
certain that any part of the valley would require much labour
before it could be brought under cultivation, and that even its
most available spots would require almost as much trouble to
clear them as the forest tract, for nothing is more difficult to
destroy than reeds. Breaking the sod would, naturally, raise the
level of the ground, and lateral drains would, most probably,
carry off all floods, but then the latter, at least, is the
operation of an advanced stage of husbandry only. I would,
however, observe that there are many parts of the valley
decidedly above the reach of flood. I have, in the above
observations, been particularly alluding to the lowest and
broadest portions of it. I trust I shall be understood as not
wishing to over-rate this discovery on the one hand, or on the
other, <!--page 183 CORDIALITY OF THE NATIVES. /page-->to include its whole extent in one sweeping clause of
condemnation. </p>

<p>On the 14th, the wind still continued to blow fresh from the
N.W. It moderated at noon, and assisted us beyond measure. We
passed our first encampment, but did not see any natives. </p>

<p>On the 15th, the wind was variable at daylight, and a dense
fog was on the river. As the sun rose, it was dissipated and a
light breeze sprung up from W.S.W. We ran up the stream with a
free sheet for six hours, when we stopped for a short time to get
the kettle boiled. Four natives joined us, but with the exception
of the lowest tribe upon the right bank, we had not seen any
number. We were extremely liberal to this tribe, in consequence
of the satisfaction they evinced at our return. We had alarmed
them much on our passage down the river by firing at a snake that
was swimming across it. We, at first, attempted to kill it with
the boat-hook, but the animal dived at our approach, and appeared
again at a considerable distance. Another such dive would have
ensured his escape, but a shot effectually checked him, and as
the natives evinced considerable alarm, we held him up, to show
them the object of our proceedings. On our return, they seemed to
have forgotten their fright, and received us with every
demonstration of joy. The different receptions we met with from
different tribes are difficult to be accounted for. </p>

<p>The country appeared to rise before us, and looked more <!--page 184 REMARKABLE CLIFF. /page-->hilly
to the N.W. than I had supposed it to be. Several fine valleys
branched off from the main one to the westward, and, however
barren the heights that confined them were, I am inclined to
think, that the distant interior is fertile. The marks of
kangaroos were numerous, and the absence of the natives would
indicate that they have other and better means of subsisting in
the back country than what the river affords. </p>

<p>In the evening, we again ran on for two hours and a half, and
reached the first of the cliffs. </p>

<p>On the 16th, we were again fortunate in the wind, and pressed
up the river as long as day-light continued. At the termination
of our journey, we found ourselves a day's journey in advance.
This inspirited the men, and they began to forget the labours
they had gone through, as well as those that were before them. </p>

<p>On the 17th, we again commenced pulling, the wind being at
north, and contrary. It did not, however, remain in that quarter
long, but backed at noon to the S.W., so that we were enabled to
make a good day's journey, and rather gained than lost ground. </p>

<p>Having left the undulating hills, at the mouth of the valley
behind us, we passed cliff after cliff of fossil formation: they
had a uniform appearance as to the substance of which they were
composed, and varied but little in colour. Having already
examined them, we thought it unnecessary to give them any further
special attention, since it was improbable we should find
anything new. <!--page 185 GEOLOGICAL REMARKS. /page-->In turning an angle of the river, however, a broad
reach stretched away before us. An alluvial flat extended to our
left, and a high line of cliffs, that differed in no visible
respect from those we had already passed, rose over the opposite
side of the river. The cliffs faced the W.N.W., and as the sun
declined, his beams struck full upon them. As we shot past, we
were quite dazzled with the burst of light that flashed upon us,
and which gave to the whole face of the cliff the appearance of a
splendid mirror. The effect was of course momentary; for as soon
as we had passed the angle of refraction, there was nothing
unusual in its appearance. On a nearer approach, however, it
appeared again as if studded with stars. We had already
determined on examining it more closely, and this second
peculiarity still further excited our curiosity. On landing, we
found the whole cliff to be a mass of selenite, in which the
various shells already noticed were plentifully embedded, as in
ice. The features of the cliff differed from any we had
previously remarked. Large masses, or blocks of square or oblong
shape, had fallen to its base, and its surface was hard, whereas
the face of the majority of the other cliffs was soft from the
effect of the atmosphere; and the rock was entirely free from
every other substance, excepting the shells of which it was
composed. We of course collected some good specimens, although
they added very considerably to the weight of our cargo. </p>

<p>The morning of the 18th was calm and cloudless. The wind, of
which there was but little, came from the north, <!--page 186 LABORIOUS ASCENT OF THE BOAT. /page-->and was as usual
warm. We availed ourselves of a favourable spot to haul our boat
on shore under one of the cliffs upon the proper left of the
river, and cleaned her well both inside and out. </p>

<p>The breezes that had so much assisted as from the lake
upwards, had now lost their influence, or failed to reach to the
distance we had gained. Calms succeeded them, and obliged us to
labour continually at the oars. We lost ground fast, and it was
astonishing to remark how soon the men's spirits drooped again
under their first efforts. They fancied the boat pulled heavily,
and that her bottom was foul; but such was not the case. The
current was not so strong as when we passed down, since the river
had evidently fallen more than a foot, and was so shallow in
several places, that we were obliged to haul the boat over them.
On these occasions we were necessarily obliged to get out of her
into the water, and had afterwards to sit still and to allow the
sun to dry our clothes upon us. The unemployed consequently
envied those at the oars, as they sat shivering in their dripping
clothes. I was aware that it was more from imagination than
reality, that the men fancied the boat was unusually heavy, but I
hesitated not in humouring them, and rather entered into their
ideas than otherwise, and endeavoured to persuade them that she
pulled the lighter for the cleaning we gave her. </p>

<p>A tribe of natives joined us, and we had the additional
trouble of guarding our stores. They were, however, very quiet,
and as we had broken up our casks, on leaving the <!--page 187 NATIVE BURIAL-PLACE. /page-->coast, we were
enabled to be liberal in our presents of iron hoop, which they
eagerly received. We calculated that we should reach the
principal junction in about fifteen days from this place. </p>

<p>The natives left us to pursue our solitary journey as soon as
the boat was reloaded. Not one of them had the curiosity to
follow us, nor did they appear to think it necessary that we
should be attended by envoys. We stopped for the night upon the
left bank; and close to a burial-ground that differed from any I
had ever seen. It must have been used many years, from the number
of bones that were found in the bank, but there were no other
indications of such a place either by mounds or by marks on the
trees. The fact, therefore, is a singular one. I have thought
that some battle might have been fought near the place, but I can
hardly think one of their battles could have been so destructive.
</p>

<p>We had now only to make the best of our journey, rising at
dawn, and pulling to seven and often to nine o'clock. I allowed
the men an hour from half-past eleven to half-past twelve, to
take their bread and water. This was our only fare, if I except
an occasional wild duck; but these birds were extremely difficult
to kill, and it cost us so much time, that we seldom endeavoured
to procure any. Our dogs had been of no great use, and were now
too weak to have run after anything if they had seen either
kangaroos or emus; and for the fish, the men loathed them, and
were either too indifferent or too much fatigued to set the <!--page 188 IMPEDED BY SHOALS. /page-->night-lines.
Shoals frequently impeded us as we proceeded up the river, and we
passed some rapids that called for our whole strength to stem. A
light wind assisted us on two or three of these occasions, and I
never failed hoisting the sail at every fitting opportunity. In
some parts the river was extremely shallow, and the sand-banks of
amazing size; and the annoyance of dragging the boat over these
occasional bars, was very great. We passed several tribes of
blacks on the 19th and 20th; but did not stop to communicate with
them. </p>

<p>I believe I have already mentioned that shortly after we first
entered the Murray, flocks of a new paroquet passed over our
heads, apparently emigrating to the N.W. They always kept too
high to be fired at, but on our return, hereabouts, we succeeded
in killing one. It made a good addition to our scanty stock of
subjects of natural history. It is impossible to conceive how few
of the feathered tribe frequent these distant and lonely regions.
The common white cockatoo is the most numerous, and there are
also a few pigeons; but other birds descend only for water, and
are soon again upon the wing. Our botanical specimens were as
scanty as our zoological, indeed the expedition may, as regards
these two particulars, almost be said to have been unproductive. </p>

<p>When we came down the river, I thought it advisable to lay its
course down as precisely as circumstances would permit: for for
this purpose I had a large compass always before me, and a sheet
of foolscap paper. As soon <!--page 189 COMPILATION OF THE CHART. /page-->as we passed an angle of the river, I
took the bearings of the reach before us, and as we proceeded
down it, marked off the description of country, and any
remarkable feature. The consequence was, that I laid down every
bend of the Murray River, from the Morumbidgee downwards. Its
creeks, its tributaries, its flats, its valleys, and its cliffs,
and, as far as I possibly could do, the nature of the distant
interior. This chart was, of course, erroneous in many
particulars, since I had to judge the length of the reaches of
the river, and the extent of its angles, but I corrected it on
the scale of the miles of latitude we made during the day, which
brought out an approximate truth at all events. The hurried
nature of our journey would not allow me to do more; and it will
be remembered that my observations were all siderial, by reason
that the sextant would not embrace the sun in his almost vertical
position at noon. Admitting, however, the imperfection of this
chart, it was of inconceivable value and comfort to us on our
return, for, by a reference to it, we discovered our place upon
the river, and our distance from our several encampments. And we
should often have stopped short of them had not the chart shown
us that a few reaches more would bring us to the desired spots.
It cheered the men to know where they were, and gave them
conversation. To myself it was very satisfactory, as it enabled
me to prepare for our meetings with the larger tribes, and to
steer clear of obstacles in the more difficult navigation of some
parts of the stream. </p>

<p>On the 21st, by dint of great labour we reached our <!--page 190 CURRENT OF THE MURRAY. /page-->camp of
the 2nd February, from which it will be remembered the Murray
took up a southerly course, and from which we likewise obtained a
first view of the coast ranges. The journey to the sea and back
again, had consequently occupied us twenty days. From this point
we turned our boat's head homewards; we made it, therefore, a
fixed position among the stages into which we divided our
journey. Our attention was now directed to the junction of the
principal tributary, which we hoped to reach in twelve days, and
anticipated a close to our labours on the Murray in eight days
more from that stage to the Morumbidgee. </p>

<p>The current in the Murray from the lake, to within a short
distance of this singular turn in it, is weak, since its bed is
almost on a level with the lake. The channel, which, at the
termination, is somewhat more than the third of a mile across,
gradually diminishes in breadth, as the interior is gained, but
is nowhere under 300 yards; while its depth averages from
eighteen to thirty feet, within a foot of the very bank. The
river might, therefore, be navigated by boats of considerable
burden, if the lake admitted of the same facility; but I am
decidedly of opinion, that the latter is generally shallow, and
that it will, in the course of years, be filled up by
depositions. It is not, however, an estuary in any sense of the
word, since no part of it is exposed at low water, excepting the
flats in the channel, and the flat between the lake and the sea.</p>

<h5>PALAEORNIS MELANURA <br>
BLACK TAILED PAROQUET.</h5>

<p>On the 23rd, we stove the boat in for the first time. I <!--page 191 ACCIDENT TO THE BOAT. /page-->had
all along anticipated such an accident, from the difficulty of
avoiding obstacles, in consequence of the turbid state of the
river. Fortunately the boat struck a rotten log. The piece
remained in her side, and prevented her filling, which she must,
otherwise, inevitably have done, ere we could have reached the
shore. As it was, however, we escaped with a little damage to the
lower bags of flour only. She was hauled up on a sand bank, and
Clayton repaired her in less than two hours, when we reloaded her
and pursued our journey. It was impossible to have been more
cautious than we were, for I was satisfied as to the fate that
would have overtaken the whole of us in the event of our losing
the boat, and was proportionably vigilant. </p>

<p>At half-past five we came to an island, which looked so
inviting, and so quiet, that I determined to land and sleep upon
it. We consequently, ran the boat into a little recess, or bay,
and pitched the tents; and I anticipated a respite from the
presence of any natives, as did the men, who were rejoiced at my
having taken up so snug a berth. It happened, however, that a
little after sunset, a flight of the new paroquets perched in the
lofty trees that grew on the island, to roost; when we
immediately commenced the work of death, and succeeded in killing
eight or ten. The reports of our guns were heard by some natives
up the river, and several came over to us. Although I was annoyed
at their having discovered our retreat, they were too few to be
troublesome. During the night, however, they were joined by fresh
numbers, amounting in all to about eighty, <!--page 192 MOLESTED BY THE NATIVES. /page-->and they were so
clamorous, that it was impossible to sleep. </p>

<p>As the morning broke, Hopkinson came to inform me that it was
in vain that the guard endeavoured to prevent them from handling
every thing, and from closing in round our camp. I went out, and
from what I saw I thought it advisable to double the sentries.
M'Leay, who was really tired, being unable to close his eyes amid
such a din, got up in ill-humour, and went to see into the cause,
and to check it if he could. This, however, was impossible. One
man was particularly forward and insolent, at whom M'Leay, rather
imprudently, threw a piece of dirt. The savage returned the
compliment with as much good will as it had been given, and
appeared quite prepared to act on the offensive. At this critical
moment my servant came to the tent in which I was washing myself,
and stated his fears that we should soon come to blows, as the
natives showed every disposition to resist us. On learning what
had passed between M'Leay and the savage, I pretended to be
equally angry with both, and with some difficulty forced the
greater part of the blacks away from the tents. I then directed
the men to gather together all the minor articles in the first
instance, and then to strike the tents; and, in order to check
the natives, I drew a line round the camp, over which I intimated
to them they should not pass. Observing, I suppose, that we were
on our guard, and that I, whom they well knew to be the chief,
was really angry, they crept away one by one, until the island
was almost <!--page 193 NATIVES BECOME TROUBLESOME. /page-->deserted by them. Why they did not attack us, I know
not, for they had certainly every disposition to do so, and had
their shorter weapons with them, which, in so confined a space as
that on which we were, would have been more fatal than their
spears </p>

<p>They left us, however; and a flight of red-crested cockatoos
happening to settle on a plain near the river, I crossed in the
boat in order to shoot one. The plain was upon the proper left
bank of the Murray. The natives had passed over to the right. As
the one channel was too shallow for the boat, when we again
pursued our journey we were obliged to pull round to the left
side of the island. A little above it the river makes a bend to
the left, and the angle at this bend was occupied by a large
shoal, one point of which rested on the upper part of the island,
and the other touched the proper right bank of the river. Thus a
narrow channel, (not broader indeed than was necessary for the
play of our oars,) alone remained for us to pass up against a
strong current. On turning round the lower part of the island, we
observed that the natives occupied the whole extent of the shoal,
and speckled it over like skirmishers. Many of them had their
spears, and their attention was evidently directed to
us.&mdash;As we neared the shoal, the most forward of them
pressed close to the edge of the deep water, so much so that our
oars struck their legs. Still this did not induce them to retire.
I kept my eye on an elderly man who stood one of the most
forward, <!--page 194 TREACHERY OF THE NATIVES. /page-->and who motioned to us several times to stop, and at
length threw the weapon he carried at the boat. I immediately
jumped up and pointed my gun at him to his great apparent alarm.
Whether the natives hoped to intimidate us by a show of numbers,
or what immediate object they had in view, it is difficult to
say; though it was most probably to seize a fitting opportunity
to attack us. Seeing, I suppose, that we were not to be checked,
they crossed from the shoal to the proper right bank of the
river, and disappeared among the reeds that lined it. </p>

<p>Shortly after this, eight of the women, whom we had not before
noticed, came down to the water side, and gave us the most
pressing invitation to land. Indeed they played their part
uncommonly well, and tried for some time to allure us by the most
unequivocal manifestations of love. Hopkinson however who always
had his eyes about him, observed the spears of the men among the
reeds. They kept abreast of us as we pulled up the stream, and,
no doubt, were anticipating our inability to resist the
temptations they had thrown in our way. I was really provoked at
their barefaced treachery, and should most undoubtedly have
attacked them, had they not precipitately retreated on being
warned by the women that I was arming my men, which I had only
now done upon seeing such strong manifestations of danger. M'Leay
set the example of coolness on this occasion; and I had some
doubts whether I was justified in allowing the natives to escape
with impunity, con<!--page 195 RE-PASS THE LINDESAY. /page-->sidering that if they had wounded any one of us
the most melancholy and fatal results would have ensued. </p>

<p>We did not see anything more of the blacks during the rest of
the day, but the repeated indications of hostility we perceived
as we approached the Darling, made me apprehensive as to the
reception we should meet from its numerous population; and I was
sorry to observe that the men anticipated danger in passing that
promising junction. </p>

<p>Having left the sea breezes behind us, the weather had become
oppressive; and as the current was stronger, and rapids more
numerous, our labour was proportionably increased. We perspired
to an astonishing degree, and gave up our oars after our turn at
them, with shirts and clothes as wet as if we had been in the
water. Indeed Mulholland and Hopkinson, who worked hard, poured a
considerable quantity of perspiration from their shoes after
their task. The evil of this was that we were always chilled
after rowing, and, of course, suffered more than we should
otherwise have done. </p>

<p>On the 25th we passed the last of the cliffs composing the
great fossil bed through which the Murray flows, and entered that
low country already described as being immediately above it. On a
more attentive examination of the distant interior, my opinion as
to its flooded origin was confirmed, more especially in reference
to the country to the S.E. On the 30th we passed the mouth of the
Lindesay, and from the summit of the sand hills to the north of
the Murray overlooked the flat country, through <!--page 196 RE-PASSED THE RUFUS. /page-->which I conclude
it must run, from the line of fires we observed amid the trees,
and most probably upon its banks. </p>

<p>We did not fall in with the natives in such numbers as when we
passed down to the coast: still they were in sufficient bodies to
be troublesome. It would, however, appear that the tribes do not
generally frequent the river. They must have a better country
back from it, and most probably linger amongst the lagoons and
creeks where food is more abundant. The fact is evident from the
want of huts upon the banks of the Murray, and the narrowness of
the paths along its margin. </p>

<p>We experienced the most oppressive heat about this time. Calms
generally prevailed, and about 3 p.m. the sun's rays fell upon us
with intense effect. The waters of the Murray continued extremely
muddy, a circumstance we discovered to be owing to the turbid
current of the Rufus, which we passed on the 1st of March. It is,
really, singular whence this little stream originates. It will be
remembered that I concluded it must have been swollen by rains
when we first saw it; yet, after an absence of more than three
weeks we found it discharging its waters as muddy as ever into
the main stream; and that, too, in such quantities as to
discolour its waters to the very lake. The reader will have some
idea of the force of the current in both, when I assure him that
for nearly fifty yards below the mouth of the Rufus, the waters
of the Murray preserve their transparency, and the line between
them and the <!--page 197 DIFFICULTIES AT THE RAPIDS. /page-->turbid waters of its tributary was as distinctly
marked as if drawn by a pencil. Indeed, the higher we advanced,
the more did we feel the strength of the current, against which
we had to pull. </p>

<p>A little below the Lindesay, a rapid occurs. It was with the
utmost difficulty that we stemmed it with the four oars upon the
boat, and the exertion of our whole strength. We remained, at one
time, perfectly stationary, the force we employed and that of the
current being equal. We at length ran up the stream obliquely;
but it was evident the men were not adequate to such exertion for
any length of time. We pulled that day for eleven successive
hours, in order to avoid a tribe of natives who followed us.
Hopkinson and Fraser fell asleep at their oars, and even the
heavy Clayton appeared to labour. </p>

<p>We again occupied our camp under the first remarkable cliffs
of the Murray, a description of which has been given in page 128
of this work. Their summit, as I have already remarked forms a
table land of some elevation. From it the distant interior to the
S.S.E. appears very depressed; that to the north undulates more.
In neither quarter, however, does any bright foliage meet the
eye, to tell that a better soil is under it; but a dark and
gloomy vegetation occupies both the near and distant ground, in
proof that the sandy sterile tracts, succeeding the river
deposits, stretch far away without a change. </p>

<p>A little above our camp of the 28th of January, we fell in
with a large tribe of natives, whose anxiety to detain us <!--page 198 OBSTACLES TO THE NAVIGATION. /page-->was
remarkable. The wind, however, which, from the time we lost the
sea breezes, had hung to the S.E., had changed to the S.W., and
we were eagerly availing ourselves of it. It will not be supposed
we stopped even for a moment. In truth we pressed on with great
success, and did not land to sleep until nine o'clock. As long as
the wind blew from the S.W., the days were cool, and the sky
overcast even so much so as to threaten rain. </p>

<p>The least circumstance, in our critical situation, naturally
raised my apprehensions, and I feared the river would be swollen
in the event of any heavy rains in the hilly country; I hoped,
however, we should gain the Morumbidgee before such a calamity
should happen to us, and it became my object to press for that
river without delay. </p>

<p>Although we had met with frequent rapids in our progress
upwards, they had not been of a serious kind, nor such as would
affect the navigation of the river. The first direct obstacle of
this kind occurs a little above a small tributary that falls into
the Murray from the north, between the Rufus and the cliffs we
have alluded to. At this place a reef of coarse grit contracts
the channel of the river. No force we could have exerted with the
oars would have taken us up this rapid; but we accomplished the
task easily by means of a rope which we hauled upon, on the same
principle that barges are dragged by horses along the canals. </p>

<p>As we neared the junction of the two main streams, the
country, on both sides of the river, became low, and its general
appearance confirmed the opinion I have already <!--page 199 DANGEROUS RAPIDS. /page-->given as to its
flooded origin. The clouds that obscured the sky, and had
threatened to burst for some time, at length gave way, and we
experienced two or three days of heavy rain. In the midst of it
we passed the second stage of our journey, and found the spot
lately so crowded with inhabitants totally deserted. A little
above it we surprised a small tribe in a temporary shelter; but
neither our offers nor presents could prevail on any of them to
expose themselves to the torrent that was falling. They sat
shivering in their bark huts in evident astonishment at our
indifference. We threw them some trifling presents and were glad
to proceed unattended by any of them. </p>

<p>It will be remembered that in passing down the river, the boat
was placed in some danger in descending a rapid before we reached
the junction of the Murray with the stream supposed by me to be
the Darling. We were now gradually approaching the rapid, nor did
I well know how we should surmount such an obstacle. Strength to
pull up it we had not, and I feared our ropes would not be long
enough to reach to the shore over some of the rocks, since it
descended in minor declivities to a considerable distance below
the principal rapid, in the centre of which the boat had struck.
We reached the commencement of these rapids on the 6th, and
ascended the first by means of ropes, which were hauled upon by
three of the men from the bank; and, as the day was pretty far
advanced, we stopped a little above it, that we might attempt the
principal rapid before we should be exhausted by previous
exertion. It was <!--page 200 PERILOUS ASCENT OF THE RAPIDS. /page-->fortunate that we took such a precaution. The
morning of the 7th proved extremely dark, and much rain fell. We
commenced our journey in the midst of it, and soon gained the
tail of the rapid. Our attempt to pull up it completely failed.
The boat, as soon as she entered the ripple, spun round like a
toy, and away we went with the stream. As I had anticipated, our
ropes were too short; and it only remained for us to get into the
water, and haul the boat up by main force. We managed pretty well
at first, and drew her alongside a rock to rest a little. We then
recommenced our efforts, and had got into the middle of the
channel. We were up to our armpits in the water, and only kept
our position by means of rocks beside us. The rain was falling,
as if we were in a tropical shower, and the force of the current
was such, that if we had relaxed for an instant, we should have
lost all the ground we had gained. Just at this moment, however,
without our being aware of their approach, a large tribe of
natives, with their spears, lined the bank, and took us most
completely by surprise. At no time during this anxious journey
were we ever so completely in their power, or in so defenceless a
situation. It rained so hard, that our firelocks would have been
of no use, and had they attacked us, we must necessarily have
been slaughtered without committing the least execution upon
them. Nothing, therefore, remained for us but to continue our
exertions. It required only one strong effort to get the boat
into still water for a time, but that effort was beyond our
strength, and we stood in the stream, powerless and exhausted. <!--page 201 ASSISTED BY THE NATIVES. /page--> </p>

<p>The natives, in the meanwhile, resting on their spears,
watched us with earnest attention. One of them, who was sitting
close to the water, at length called to us, and we immediately
recognised the deep voice of him to whose singular interference
we were indebted for our escape on the 23rd of January. I desired
Hopkinson to swim over to him, and to explain that we wanted
assistance. This was given without hesitation; and we at length
got under the lea of the rock, which I have already described as
being in the centre of the river. The natives launched their bark
canoes, the only frail means they possess of crossing the rivers
with their children. These canoes are of the simplest
construction and rudest materials, being formed of an oblong
piece of bark, the ends of which are stuffed with clay, so as to
render them impervious to the water. With several of these they
now paddled round us with the greatest care, making their spears,
about ten feet in length,(which they use at once as poles and
paddles,) bend nearly double in the water. We had still the most
difficult part of the rapid to ascend, where the rush of water
was the strongest, and where the decline of the bed almost
amounted to a fall. Here the blacks could be of no use to us. No
man could stem the current, supposing it to have been shallow at
the place, but it was on the contrary extremely deep. Remaining
myself in the boat, I directed all the men to land, after we had
crossed the stream, upon a large rock that formed the left
buttress as it were to this sluice, and, fastening the rope to
the mast instead of her head, they pulled upon it. The <!--page 202 GOOD CONDUCT OF THE MEN. /page-->unexpected
rapidity with which the boat shot up the passage astonished me,
and filled the natives with wonder, who testified their
admiration of so dextrous a manoeuvre, by a loud shout. </p>

<p>It will, no doubt, have struck the reader as something very
remarkable, that the same influential savage to whom we had
already been indebted, should have been present on this occasion,
and at a moment when we so much needed his assistance. Having
surmounted our difficulties, we took leave of this remarkable
man, and pursued our journey up the river. </p>

<p>It may be imagined we did not proceed very far; the fact was,
we only pushed forward to get rid of the natives, for, however
pacific, they were always troublesome, and we were seldom fitted
for a trial of temper after the labours of the day were
concluded. The men had various occupations in which, when the
natives were present, they were constantly interrupted, and
whenever the larger tribes slept near us, the utmost vigilance
was necessary on the part of the night-guard, which was regularly
mounted as soon as the tents were pitched. We had had little else
than our flour to subsist on. Hopkinson and Harris endeavoured to
supply M'Leay and myself with a wild fowl occasionally, but for
themselves, and the other men, nothing could be procured to
render their meal more palatable. </p>

<p>I have omitted to mention one remarkable trait of the good
disposition of all the men while on the coast. Our sugar had held
out to that point; but it appeared, when we <!--page 203 MOLESTED BY NATIVES. /page-->examined the stores,
that six pounds alone remained in the cask. This the men
positively refused to touch. They said that, divided, it would
benefit nobody; that they hoped M'Leay and I would use it, that
it would last us for some time, and that they were better able to
submit to privations than we were. The feeling did them infinite
credit, and the circumstance is not forgotten by me. The little
supply the kindness of our men left to us was, however, soon
exhausted, and poor M'Leay preferred pure water to the bitter
draught that remained. I have been some times unable to refrain
from smiling, as I watched the distorted countenances of my
humble companions while drinking their tea and eating their
damper. </p>

<p>The ducks and swans, seen in such myriads on the lake, seldom
appeared on the river, in the first stages of our journey
homewards. About the time of which I am writing, however, a few
swans occasionally flew over our heads at night, and their
silvery note was musically sweet. </p>

<p>From the 10th to the 15th, nothing of moment occurred: we
pulled regularly from day-light to dark, not less to avoid the
natives than to shorten our journey. Yet, notwithstanding that we
moved at an hour when the natives seldom stir, we were rarely
without a party of them, who followed us in spite of our efforts
to tire them out. </p>

<p>On the 15th, we had about 150 at our camp. Many of them were
extremely noisy, and the whole of them very restless. They lay
down close to the tents, or around our fire. I entertained some
suspicion of them, and when <!--page 204 FRASER IN DANGER. /page-->they were apparently asleep, I
watched them narrowly. Macnamee was walking up and down with his
firelock, and every time he turned his back, one of the natives
rose gently up and poised his spear at him, and as soon as he
thought Macnamee was about to turn, he dropped as quietly into
his place. When I say the native got up, I do not mean that he
stood up, but that he raised himself sufficiently for the purpose
he had in view. His spear would not, therefore, have gone with
much force, but I determined it should not quit his hand, for had
I observed any actual attempt to throw it, I should
unquestionably have shot him dead upon the spot. The whole of the
natives were awake, and it surprised me they did not attempt to
plunder us. They rose with the earliest dawn, and crowded round
the tents without any hesitation. We, consequently, thought it
prudent to start as soon as we had breakfasted. </p>

<p>We had all of us got into the boat, when Fraser remembered he
had left his powder-horn on shore. In getting out to fetch it, he
had to push through the natives. On his return, when his back was
towards them, several natives lifted their spears together, and I
was so apprehensive they would have transfixed him, that I called
out before I seized my gun; on which they lowered their weapons
and ran away. The disposition to commit personal violence was
evident from these repeated acts of treachery; and we should
doubtless have suffered from it on some occasion or other, had we
not been constantly on the alert. </p>

<p>We had been drawing nearer the Morumbidgee every <!--page 205 RE-ENTER THE MORUMBIDGEE. /page-->day. This was
the last tribe we saw on the Murray; and the following afternoon,
to our great joy, we quitted it and turned our boat into the
gloomy and narrow channel of its tributary. Our feelings were
almost as strong when we re-entered it, as they had been when we
were launched from it into that river, on whose waters we had
continued for upwards of fifty-five days; during which period,
including the sweeps and bends it made, we could not have
travelled less than 1500 miles. </p>

<p>Our provisions were now running very short; we had, however,
&ldquo;broken the neck of our journey,&rdquo; as the men
said, and we looked anxiously to gaining the depot; for we were
not without hopes that Robert Harris would have pushed forward to
it with his supplies. We were quite puzzled on entering the
Morumbidgee, how to navigate its diminutive bends and its
encumbered channel. I thought poles would have been more
convenient than oars; we therefore stopped at an earlier hour
than usual to cut some. Calling to mind the robbery practised on
us shortly after we left the depot, my mind became uneasy as to
Robert Harris's safety, since I thought it probable, from the
sulky disposition of the natives who had visited us there, that
he might have been attacked. Thus, when my apprehensions on our
own account had partly ceased, my fears became excited with
regard to him and his party. </p>

<p>The country, to a considerable distance from the junction on
either side the Morumbidgee, is not subject to inunda<!--page 206 FEAST ON A SWAN. /page-->tion.
Wherever we landed upon its banks, we found the calistemma in
full flower, and in the richest profusion. There was, also, an
abundance of grass, where before there had been no signs of
vegetation, and those spots which we had condemned as barren were
now clothed with a green and luxuriant carpet. So difficult is it
to judge of a country on a partial and hurried survey, and so
differently does it appear at different periods. I was rejoiced
to find that the rains had not swollen the river, for I was
apprehensive that heavy falls had taken place in the mountains,
and was unprepared for so much good fortune. </p>

<p>The poles we cut were of no great use to us, and we soon laid
them aside, and took to our oars. Fortune seemed to favour us
exceedingly. The men rallied, and we succeeded in killing a good
fat swan, that served as a feast for all. I imagine the absence
of mud and weeds of every kind in the Murray, prevents this bird
from frequenting its waters. </p>

<p>On the 18th, we found ourselves entering the reedy country,
through which we had passed with such doubt and anxiety. Every
object elicited some remark from the men, and I was sorry to find
they reckoned with certainty on seeing Harris at the depot, as I
knew they would be proportionally depressed in spirits if
disappointed. However, I promised Clayton a good repast as soon
as we should see him. </p>

<p>I had walked out with M'Leay a short distance from the river,
and had taken the dogs. They followed us to the camp on our
return to it, but the moment they saw us <!--page 207 LOSE ONE OF OUR DOGS. /page-->enter the tent, they
went off to hunt by themselves. About 10 p.m., one of them, Bob,
came to the fire, and appeared very uneasy; he remained, for a
short time, and then went away. In about an hour, he returned,
and after exhibiting the same restlessness, again withdrew. He
returned the third time before morning dawned, but returned
alone. The men on the watch were very stupid not to have followed
him, for, no doubt, he went to his companion, to whom, most
likely, some accident had happened. I tried to make him show, but
could not succeed, and, after a long search, reluctantly pursued
our journey, leaving poor Sailor to his fate. This was the only
misfortune that befell us, and we each of us felt the loss of an
animal which had participated in all our dangers and privations.
I more especially regretted the circumstance for the sake of the
gentleman who gave him to me, and, on account of his superior
size and activity. </p>

<p>With the loss of poor Sailor, our misfortunes re-commmenced. I
anticipated some trouble hereabouts, for, having succeeded in
their hardihood once, I knew the natives would again attempt to
rob us, and that we should have some difficulty in keeping them
off. As soon as they found out that we were in the river, they
came to us, but left us at sunset. This was on the 21st. At
nightfall, I desired the watch to keep a good look out, and
M'Leay and I went to lie down. We had chosen an elevated bank for
our position, and immediately opposite to us there was a small
space covered with reeds, under blue-gum trees. About <!--page 208 RE-ENCOUNTER WITH NATIVES. /page-->11,
Hopkinson came to the tent to say, that he was sure the blacks
were approaching through the reeds. M'Leay and I got up, and,
standing on the bank, listened attentively. All we heard was the
bark of a native dog apparently, but this was, in fact, a
deception on the part of the blacks. We made no noise, in
consequence of which they gradually approached, and two or three
crept behind the trunk of a tree that had fallen. As I thought
they were near enough, George M'Leay, by my desire, fired a
charge of small shot at them. They instantly made a precipitate
retreat; but, in order the more effectually to alarm them,
Hopkinson fired a ball into the reeds, which we distinctly heard
cutting its way through them. All was quiet until about three
o'clock, when a poor wretch who, most probably, had thrown
himself on the ground when the shots were fired, at length
mustered courage to get up and effect his escape. </p>

<p>In the morning, the tribe kept aloof, but endeavoured, by the
most earnest entreaties, and most pitiable howling, to gain our
favour; but I threatened to shoot any that approached, and they
consequently kept at a respectful distance, dogging us from tree
to tree. It appeared, therefore, that they were determined to
keep us in view, no doubt, with the intention of trying what they
could do by a second attempt. As they went along, their numbers
increased, and towards evening, they amounted to a strong tribe.
Still they did not venture near us, and only now and then showed
themselves. Our situation at this <!--page 209 APPARENT OBSTRUCTION OF THE CHANNEL. /page-->moment would have been much
more awkward in the event of attack, than when we were in the
open channel of the Murray; because we were quite at the mercy of
the natives if they had closed upon us, and, being directly under
the banks, should have received every spear, while it would have
been easy for them to have kept out of sight in assailing us. </p>

<p>It was near sunset, the men were tired, and I was looking out
for a convenient place at which to rest, intending to punish
these natives if they provoked me, or annoyed the men. We had not
seen any of them for some time, when Hopkinson, who was standing
in the bow of the boat, informed me that they had thrown boughs
across the river to prevent our passage. I was exceedingly
indignant at this, and pushed on, intending to force the barrier.
On our nearer approach, a solitary black was observed standing
close to the river, and abreast of the impediment which I
imagined they had raised to our further progress. I threatened to
shoot this man, and pointed to the branches that stretched right
across the stream. The poor fellow uttered not a word, but,
putting his hand behind him, pulled out a tomahawk from his belt,
and held it towards me, by way of claiming our acquaintance; and
any anger was soon entirely appeased by discovering that the
natives had been merely setting a net across the river which
these branches supported. We, consequently, hung back, until they
had drawn it, and then passed on. </p>

<p>The black to whom I had spoken so roughly, cut across <!--page 210 MANOEUVRES OF THE NATIVES /page-->a bight
of the river, and walking down to the side of the water with a
branch in his hand, in mark of confidence, presented me with a
fishing net. We were highly pleased at the frank conduct of this
black, and a convenient place offering itself, we landed and
pitched our tents. Our friend, who was about forty, brought his
two wives, and a young man, to us: and at length the other blacks
mustered courage to approach; but those who had followed us from
the last camp, kept on the other side of the river. On pretence
of being different families, they separated into small bodies,
and formed a regular cordon round our camp. We foresaw that this
was a manoeuvre, but, in hopes that if I forgave the past they
would desist from further attempts, M'Leay took great pains in
conciliating them, and treated them with great kindness. We gave
each family some fire and same presents, and walked together to
them by turns, to show that we had equal confidence in all. Our
friend had posted himself immediately behind our tents, at twenty
yards distance, with his little family, and kept altogether aloof
from the other natives. Having made our round of visits, and
examined the various modes the women had of netting, M'Leay and I
went into our tent. </p>

<p>It happened, fortunately, that my servant, Harris, was the
first for sentry. I told him to keep a watchful eye on the
natives, and to call me if any thing unusual occurred. We had
again chosen a lofty bank for our position; behind us there was a
small plain, of about a quarter of a mile in breadth, backed by a
wood. I was almost asleep, when my <!--page 211 TO ROB THE BOAT AT NIGHT. /page-->servant came to inform me,
that the blacks had, with one accord, made a precipitate retreat,
and that not one of them was to be seen at the fires. I impressed
the necessity of attention upon him, and he again went to his
post. shortly after this, he returned:
&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the natives are
coming.&rdquo; I jumped up, and, taking my gun, followed him,
leaving my friend George fast asleep. I would not disturb him,
until necessity required, for he had ever shown himself so
devoted to duty as to deserve every consideration. Harris led me
a little way from the tents, and then stopping, and pointing down
the river, said, &ldquo;There, sir, don't you see
them?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not I, indeed, Harris,&rdquo; I
replied, &ldquo;where do you mean? are you sure you see
them?&rdquo; &ldquo;Positive, sir,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;stoop and you will see them.&rdquo; I did so, and
saw a black mass in an opening. Convinced that I saw them, I
desired Harris to follow me, but not to fire unless I should give
the word. The rascals would not stand our charge, however, but
retreated as we advanced towards them. We then returned to the
tents, and, commending my servant for his vigilance, I once more
threw myself on my bed. I had scarcely lain down five minutes,
when Harris called out, &ldquo;The blacks are close to me,
sir; shall I fire at them?&rdquo; &ldquo;How far are
they?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Within ten yards,
sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then fire,&rdquo; said I; and
immediately he did so. M'Leay and I jumped up to his assistance.
&ldquo;Well, Harris,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;did you kill
your man?&rdquo; (he is a remarkably good shot.) &ldquo;No,
sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I thought you <!--page 212 NATIVES DESERT THEIR WEAPONS. /page-->would repent it,
so I fired between the two.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where were they,
man?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Close to the boat, sir; and when
they heard me, they swam into the river, and dived as soon as I
fired between them.&rdquo; This account was verified by one of
them puffing as he rose below us, over whose head I fired a shot.
Where the other got to I could not tell. This watchfulness, on
our part, however, prevented any further attempts during the
night. </p>

<p>I was much pleased at the coolness of my servant, as well as
his consideration; and relieving him from his post, desired
Hopkinson to take it. I have no doubt that the approach of the
natives, in the first instance, was made with a view to draw us
off from the camp, while some others might rob the boat. If so,
it was a good manoeuvre, and might have succeeded. </p>

<p>In the morning, we found the natives had left all their
ponderous spears at their fires, which were broken up and burnt.
We were surprised to find that our friend had left every thing in
like manner behind him&mdash;his spears, his nets, and his
tomahawk; but as he had kept so wholly aloof from the other
blacks, I thought it highly improbable that he had joined them,
and the men were of opinion that he had retreated across the
plain into the wood. On looking in that direction we observed
some smoke rising among the trees at a little distance from the
outskirts of the plain, and under an impression that I should
find the native at the fire with his family, I took his spears
and tomahawk, and walked across the plain, unattended into <!--page 213 INGENUOUS CONDUCT OF A NATIVE. /page-->the
wood. I had not entered it more than fifty yards when I saw a
group of four natives, sitting round a small fire. One of them,
as I approached, rose up and met me, and in him I recognised the
man for whom I was seeking. When near enough, I stuck the spears
upright into the ground. The poor man stood thunderstruck; he
spoke not, he moved not, neither did he raise his eyes from the
ground. I had kept the tomahawk out of his sight, but I now
produced and offered it to him. He gave a short exclamation as
his eyes caught sight of it, but he remained otherwise silent
before me, and refused to grasp the tomahawk, which accordingly
fell to the ground. I had evidently excited the man's feelings,
but it is difficult to say how he was affected. His manner
indicated shame and surprise, and the sequel will prove that both
these feelings must have possessed him. While we were thus
standing together, his two wives came up, to whom, after pointing
to the spears and tomahawk, he said something, without, however,
looking at me; and they both instantly burst into tears and wept
aloud. I was really embarrassed during so unexpected a scene, and
to break it, invited the native to the camp, but I motioned with
my hand, as I had not my gun with me, that I would shoot any
other of the blacks who followed me. He distinctly understood my
meaning, and intimated as distinctly to me that they should not
follow us; nor did they. We were never again molested by them. </p>

<p>I left him then, and, returning to the camp, told M'Leay <!--page 214 BREACH THE DEPOT. /page-->my
adventure, with which he was highly delighted. My object is this
procedure was to convince the natives, generally, that we came
not among them to injure or to molest them, as well as to impress
them with an idea of our superior intelligence; and I am led to
indulge the hope that I succeeded. Certain it is, that an act of
justice or of lenity has frequently, if well timed, more weight
than the utmost stretch of severity. With savages, more
particularly, to exhibit any fear, distrust, or irresolution,
will inevitably prove injurious. </p>

<p>But although these adventures were happily not attended with
bloodshed, they harassed the men much; and our camp for near a
week was more like an outpost picquet than any thing else. This,
however, terminated all attempts on the part of the natives. From
henceforth none of them followed us on our route. </p>

<p>At noon, I stopped about a mile short of the depot to take
sights. After dinner we pulled on, the men looking earnestly out
for their comrades whom they had left there, but none appeared.
My little arbour, in which I had written my letters, was
destroyed, and the bank on which out tents had stood was wholly
deserted. We landed, however, and it was a satisfaction to me to
see the homeward track of the drays. The men were sadly
disappointed, and poor Clayton, who had anticipated a plentiful
meal, was completely chop fallen. M'Leay and I comforted them
daily with the hopes of meeting the drays, which I did not think
improbable. <!--page 215 DISAPPOINTED OF SUPPLIES. /page--> </p>

<p>Thus, it will appear, that we regained the place from which we
started in seventy-seven days, during which, we could not have
pulled less than 2000 miles. It is not for me, however, to make
any comment, either on the dangers to which we were occasionally
exposed, or the toil and privations we continually experienced in
the course of this expedition. My duty is, simply to give a plain
narrative of facts, which I have done with fidelity, and with as
much accuracy as circumstances would permit. Had we found Robert
Harris at the depot, I should have considered it unnecessary to
trespass longer on the patient reader, but as our return to that
post did not relieve us from our difficulties, it remains for me
to carry on the narrative of our proceedings to the time when we
reached the upper branches of the Morumbidgee. </p>

<p>The hopes that had buoyed up the spirits of the men, ceased to
operate as soon as they were discovered to have been ill founded.
The most gloomy ideas took possession of their minds, and they
fancied that we had been neglected, and that Harris had remained
in Sydney. It was to no purpose that I explained to them that my
instructions did not bind Harris to come beyond Pondebadgery, and
that I was confident he was then encamped upon that plain. </p>

<p>We had found the intricate navigation of the Morumbidgee
infinitely more distressing than the hard pulling up the open
reaches of the Murray, for we were obliged to haul the boat up
between numberless trunks of trees, an operation that exhausted
the men much more than rowing. <!--page 216 COMPLETE EXHAUSTION OF THE MEN. /page-->The river had fallen below its
former level, and rocks and logs were now exposed above the
water, over many of which the boat's keel must have grazed, as we
passed down with the current. I really shuddered frequently, at
seeing these complicated dangers, and I was at a loss to conceive
how we could have escaped them. The planks of our boat were so
thin that if she had struck forcibly against any one branch of
the hundreds she must have grazed, she would inevitably have been
rent asunder from stem to stern. </p>

<p>The day after we passed the depot, on our return, we began to
experience the effects of the rains that had fallen in the
mountains. The Morumbidgee rose upon us six feet in one night,
and poured along its turbid waters with proportionate violence.
For seventeen days we pulled against them with determined
perseverance, but human efforts, under privations such as ours,
tend to weaken themselves, and thus it was that the men began to
exhibit the effects of severe and unremitting toil. Our daily
journeys were short, and the head we made against the stream but
trifling. The men lost the proper and muscular jerk with which
they once made the waters foam and the oars bend. Their whole
bodies swung with an awkward and laboured motion. Their arms
appeared to be nerveless; their faces became haggard, their
persons emaciated, their spirits wholly sunk; nature was so
completely overcome, that from mere exhaustion they frequently
fell asleep during their painful and almost ceaseless exertions.
It grieved me to the heart to see them in such a state at the
close of so perilous a service, <!--page 217 ONE LOSES HIS SENSES. /page-->and I began to reproach Robert
Harris that he did not move down the river to meet us; but, in
fact, he was not to blame. I became captious, and found fault
where there was no occasion, and lost the equilibrium of my
temper in contemplating the condition of my companions. No
murmur, however, escaped them, nor did a complaint reach me, that
was intended to indicate that they had done all they could do. I
frequently heard them in their tent, when they thought I had
dropped asleep, complaining of severe pains and of great
exhaustion. &ldquo;I must tell the captain,
to-morrow,&rdquo; some of them would say, &ldquo;that I can
pull no more.&rdquo; To-morrow came, and they pulled on, as if
reluctant to yield to circumstances. Macnamee at length lost his
senses. We first observed this from his incoherent conversation,
but eventually from manner. He related the most extraordinary
tales, and fidgeted about eternally while in the boat. I felt it
necessary, therefore, to relieve him from the oars. </p>

<p>Amidst these distresses, M'Leay preserved his good humour, and
endeavoured to lighten the task, and to cheer the men as much as
possible. His presence at this time was a source of great comfort
to me. The uniform kindness with which he had treated his
companions, gave him an influence over them now, and it was
exerted with the happiest effect. </p>

<p>On the 8th and 9th of April we had heavy rain, but there was
no respite for us. Our provisions were nearly consumed, and would
have been wholly exhausted, if we <!--page 218 DESPATCH TWO MEN TO PONDEBADGERY. /page-->had not been so fortunate as to
kill several swans. On the 11th, we gained our camp opposite to
Hamilton's Plains, after a day of severe exertion. Our tents were
pitched upon the old ground, and the marks of our cattle were
around us. In the evening, the men went out with their guns, and
M'Leay and I walked to the rear of the camp, to consult
undisturbed as to the moat prudent measures to be adopted, under
our embarrassing circumstances. The men were completely sunk. We
were still between eighty and ninety miles from Pondebadgery, in
a direct line, and nearly treble that distance by water. The task
was greater than we could perform, and our provisions were
insufficient. In this extremity I thought it best to save the men
the mortification of yielding, by abandoning the boat; and on
further consideration, I determined on sending Hopkinson and
Mulholland, whose devotion, intelligence, and indefatigable
spirits, I well knew, forward to the plain.</p>
<!--face 219 /face--><a name="i2.11"></a>

<h5>1. POMATORHINUS TEMPORALIS <br>
2. POMATORHINUS SUPERCILIOSUS.</h5>

<p>The joy this intimation spread was universal, Both Hopkinson
and Mulholland readily undertook the journey, and I, accordingly,
prepared orders for them to start by the earliest dawn. It was
not without a feeling of sorrow that I witnessed the departure of
these two men, to encounter a fatiguing march. I had no fears as
to their gaining the plain, if their reduced state would permit
them. On the other hand, I hoped they would fall in with our old
friend the black, or that they would meet the drays; and I could
not but admire the spirit and energy they both displayed upon the
occasion. Their behaviour throughout had been <!--page 219 ABANDON AND BURN THE BOAT. /page-->such as to awaken
in my breast a feeling of the highest approbation. Their conduct,
indeed, exceeded all praise, nor did they hesitate one moment
when I called upon them to undertake this last trying duty, after
such continued exertion. I am sure the reader will forgive me for
bringing under his notice the generous efforts of these two men;
by me it can never be forgotten. </p>

<p>Six days had passed since their departure; we remaining
encamped. M'Leay and myself had made some short excursions, but
without any result worthy of notice. A group of sand-hills rose
in the midst of the alluvial deposits, about a quarter of a mile
from the tents, that were covered with coarse grasses and
banksias. We shot several intertropical birds feeding in the
latter, and sucking the honey from their flowers. I had, in the
mean time, directed Clayton to make some plant cases of the upper
planks of the boat, and then to set fire to her, for she was
wholly unserviceable, and I felt a reluctance to leave her like a
neglected log on the water. The last ounce of flour had been
served out to the men, and the whole of it was consumed on the
sixth day from that on which we had abandoned the boat. I had
calculated on seeing Hopkinson again in eight days, but as the
morrow would see us without food, I thought, as the men had had a
little rest it would be better to advance towards relief than to
await its arrival. </p>

<p>On the evening of the 18th, therefore, we buried our specimens
and other stores, intending to break up the camp in the morning.
A singular bird, which invariably passed it <!--page 220 MEN RETURN WITH SUPPLIES. /page-->at an hour after
sunset, and which, from its heavy flight, appeared to be of
unusual size so attracted my notice, that in the evening M'Leay
and I crossed the river, in hope to get a shot at it. We had,
however, hardly landed on the other side, when a loud shout
called us back to witness the return of our comrades. </p>

<p>They were both of them in a state that beggars description.
Their knees and ankles were dreadfully swollen, and their limbs
so painful, that as soon as they arrived in the camp they sunk
under their efforts, but they met us with smiling countenances,
and expressed their satisfaction at having arrived so seasonably
to our relief. They had, as I had foreseen, found Robert Harris
on the plain, which they reached on the evening of the third day.
They had started early the next morning on their return with such
supplies as they thought we might immediately want. Poor Macnamee
had in a great measure recovered, but for some days he was sullen
and silent: sight of the drays gave him uncommon satisfaction.
Clayton gorged himself; but M'Leay, myself and Fraser could not
at first relish the meat that was placed before us. </p>

<p>It was determined to give the bullocks a day of rest, and I
availed myself of the serviceable state of the horses to visit
some hills about eighteen miles to the northward. I was anxious
to gain a view of the distant country to the N.W., and to
ascertain the geological character of the hills themselves.
M'Leay, Fraser, and myself left the camp early in the morning of
the 19th, on our way to them. Crossing <!--page 221 MEET WITH THE DRAYS. /page-->the sand-hills, we
likewise passed a creek, and, from the flooded or alluvial
tracks, got on an elevated sandy country, in which we found a
beautiful grevillia. From this we passed a barren ridge of
quartz-formation, terminating in open box forest. From it we
descended and traversed a plain that must, at some periods, be
almost impassable. It was covered with acacia pendula, and the
soil was a red earth, bare of vegetation in many places. At its
extremity we came to some stony ridges, and, descending their
northern side, gained the base of the hills. They were more
extensive than they appeared to be from our camp; and were about
six hundred feet in height, and composed of a conglomerate rock.
They were extremely barren, nor did the aspect of the country
seem to indicate a favourable change. I was enabled, however, to
connect my line of route with the more distant hills between the
Morumbidgee and the Lachlan. We returned to the camp at midnight.
</p>

<p>On the following morning we left our station before Hamilton's
Plains. We reached Pondebadgery on the 28th, and found Robert
Harris, with a plentiful supply of provisions. He had everything
extremely regular, and had been anxiously expecting our return,
of which he at length wholly despaired. He had been at the plain
two months, and intended to have moved down the river
immediately, had we not made our appearance when we did. </p>

<p>I had sent M'Leay forward on the 20th with letters to the
Governor, whose anxiety was great on our account. I remained for
a fortnight on the plain to restore the men, but <!--page 222 INSTANCE OF CANNIBALISM. /page-->Hopkinson had so
much over-exerted himself that it was with difficulty he crawled
along. </p>

<p>In my despatches to the Governor, from the depot, I had
suggested the policy of distributing some blankets and other
presents to the natives on the Morumbidgee, in order to reward
those who had been useful to our party, and in the hope of
proving beneficial to settlers in that distant part of the
colony. His Excellency was kind enough to accede to my request,
and I found ample means for these purposes among the stores that
Harris brought from Sydney. </p>

<p>We left Pondebadgery Plain early on the 5th of May, and
reached Guise's Station late in the afternoon. We gained Yass
Plains on the 12th, having struck through the mountain passes by
a direct line, instead of returning by our old route near
Underaliga. As the party was crossing the plains I rode to see
Mr. O'Brien, but did not find him at home. </p>

<p>While waiting at his hut, one of the stockmen pointed out two
blacks to me at a little distance from us. The one was standing,
the other sitting. &ldquo;That fellow, sir,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;who is sitting down, killed his infant child last night
by knocking its head against a stone, after which he threw it on
the fire and then devoured it.&rdquo; I was quite horror
struck, and could scarcely believe such a story. I therefore went
up to the man and questioned him as to the fact, as well as I
could. He did not attempt to deny it, but slunk away in evident
consciousness. I then questioned the other that remained, whose
excuse for his friend was <!--page 223 CONCLUDING REMARKS. /page-->that the child was sick and would never
have grown up, adding he himself did not <i>patter</i> (eat) any
of it. </p>

<p>Many of my readers may probably doubt this horrid occurrence
having taken place, as I have not mentioned any corroborating
circumstances. I am myself, however, as firmly persuaded of the
truth of what I have stated as if I had seen the savage commit
the act; for I talked to his companion who did see him, and who
described to me the manner in which he killed the child. Be it as
it may, the very mention of such a thing among these people goes
to prove that they are capable of such an enormity. </p>

<h5>CONCLUDING REMARKS</h5>

<p>To most of my readers, the foregoing narrative will appear
little else than a succession of adventures. Whilst the
expedition was toiling down the rivers, no rich country opened
upon the view to reward or to cheer the perseverance of those who
composed it, and when, at length, the land of promise lay smiling
before them, their strength and their means were too much
exhausted to allow of their commencing an examination, of the
result of which there could be but little doubt. The expedition
returned to <!--page 224 CONCLUDING REMARKS. /page-->Sydney, without any splendid discovery to gild its
proceedings; and the labours and dangers it had encountered were
considered as nothing more than ordinary occurrences. If I myself
had entertained hopes that my researches would have benefited the
colony, I was wholly disappointed. There is a barren tract of
country lying to the westward of the Blue Mountains that will
ever divide the eastern coast from the more central parts of
Australia, as completely as if seas actually rolled between them.
</p>

<p>In a geographical point of view, however, nothing could have
been more satisfactory, excepting an absolute knowledge of the
country to the northward between the Murray and the Darling, than
the results of the expedition. I have in its proper place stated,
as fairly as I could, my reasons for supposing the principal
junction (which I consequently left without a name) to be the
Darling of my former journey, as well as the various arguments
that bore against such a conclusion. </p>

<p>Of course, where there is so much room for doubt, opinions
will be various. I shall merely review the subject, in order to
connect subsequent events with my previous observations, and to
give the reader a full idea of that which struck me to be the
case on a close and anxious investigation of the country from
mountain to lowland. I returned from the Macquarie with doubts on
my mind as to the ultimate direction to which the waters of the
Darling river might ultimately flow; for, with regard to every
other point, the question was, I considered, wholly decided. But,
<!--page 225 GEOGRAPHICAL REMARKS. /page-->with regard to that singular stream, I was, from the little
knowledge I had obtained, puzzled as to its actual course; and I
thought it as likely that it might turn into the heart of the
interior, as that it would make to the south. It had not,
however, escaped my notice, that the northern rivers turned more
abruptly southward (after gaining a certain distance from the
base of the ranges) than the more southern streams: near the
junction of the Castlereagh with the Darling especially, the
number of large creeks joining the first river from the north,
led me to conclude that there was at that particular spot a rapid
fall of country to the south. </p>

<p>The first thing that strengthened in my mind this half-formed
opinion, was the fall of the Lachlan into the Morumbidgee. I had
been told that Australia was a basin; that an unbroken range of
hills lined its coasts, the internal rivers of which fell into
its centre, and contributed to the formation of an inland sea; I
was not therefore prepared to find a break in the
chain&mdash;a gap as it were for the escape of these waters to
the coast. </p>

<p>Subsequently to our entrance into the Murray, the remarkable
efforts of that river to maintain a southerly course were
observed even by the men, and the singular runs it made to the
south, when unchecked by high lands, clearly evinced its natural
tendency to flow in that direction. </p>

<p>Had we found ourselves at an elevation above the bed of the
Darling when we reached the junction of the principal tributary
with the Murray, I should still have had doubts on my mind as to
the identity of that tributary with the <!--page 226 GEOLOGICAL REMARKS. /page-->first-mentioned river;
but considering the trifling elevation of the Darling above the
sea, and that the junction was still less elevated above it, I
cannot bring myself to believe that the former alters its course.
It is not, however, on this simple geographical principle that I
have built my conclusions; other corroborative circumstances have
tended also to confirm in my mind the opinion I have already
given, not only of the comparatively recent appearance above the
ocean of the level country over which I had passed, but that the
true dip of the interior is from north to south. </p>

<p>In support of the first of these conclusions, it would appear
that a current of water must have swept the vast accumulation of
shells, forming the great fossil bank through which the Murray
passes from the northern extremity of the continent, to deposit
them where they are; and it would further appear from the gradual
rise of this bed, on an inclined plain from N.N.E. to S.S.W.,
that it must in the first instance, have swept along the base of
the ranges, but ultimately turned into the above direction by the
convexity of the mountains at the S.E. angle of the coast. From
the circumstance, moreover, of the summit of the fossil formation
being in places covered with oyster shells, the fact of the whole
mass having been under water is indisputable, and leads us
naturally to the conclusion that the depressed interior beyond it
must have been under water at the same time. </p>

<p>It was proved by barometrical admeasurement, that the cataract
of the Macquarie was 680 feet above the level of the sea, and, in
like manner, it was found that the depot of <!--page 227 GEOLOGICAL REMARKS. /page-->Mr. Oxley, on the
Lachlan, was only 500, there being a still greater fall of
country beyond these two points. The maximum height of the fossil
bank was 300 feet; and if we suppose a line to be drawn from its
top to the eastward, that line would pass over the marshes of the
two rivers, and would cut them at a point below which they both
gradually diminish. Hence I am brought to conclude that in former
times the sea washed the western base of the dividing ranges, at
or near the two points whose respective elevations I have given;
and that when the mass of land now lying waste and unproductive,
became exposed, the rivers, which until then had pursued a
regular course to the ocean, having no channel beyond their
original termination, overflowed the almost level country into
which they now fall; or, filling some extensive concavity, have
contributed, by successive depositions, to the formation of those
marshes of which so much has been said. I regret extremely, that
my defective vision prevents me giving a slight sketch to
elucidate whet I fear I have, in words, perhaps, failed in making
sufficiently intelligible. </p>

<p>Now, as we know not by what means the changes that have taken
place on the earth's surface have been effected, and can only
reason on them from analogy, it is to be feared we shall never
arrive at any clear demonstration of the truth of our surmises
with regard to geographical changes, whether extensive or local,
since the causes which produced them will necessarily have ceased
to operate. We cannot refer to the dates when they took place, as
we may do <!--page 228 GEOLOGICAL REMARKS. /page-->in regard to the eruptions of a volcano, or the
appearance or disappearance of an island. Such events are of
minor importance. Those mighty changes to which I would be
understood to allude, can hardly be laid to the account of
chemical agency. We can easily comprehend how subterranean fires
will occasionally burst forth, and can thus satisfactorily
account for earthquake or volcano; but it is not to any clashing
of properties, or to any visible causes, that the changes of
which I speak can be attributed. They appear rather as the
consequences of direct agency, of an invisible power, not as the
occasional and fretful workings of nature herself. The marks of
that awful catastrophe which so nearly extinguished the human
race, are every day becoming more and more visible as geological
research proceeds. Thus, in the limestone caves at Wellington
Valley, the remains of fossils and exuviae, show that their
depths were penetrated by the same searching element that poured
into the caverns of Kirkdale and other places. They are as gleams
of sunshine falling upon the pages of that sublime and splendid
volume, in which the history of the deluge is alone to be found;
as if the Almighty intended that His word should stand single and
unsupported before mankind: and when we consider that such
corroborative testimonies of his wrath, as those I have noticed,
were in all probability wholly unknown to those who wrote that
sacred book, the discovery of the remains of a past world, must
strike those under whose knowledge it may fall with the truth of
that awful event, which language has vainly endeavoured to
describe and painters to represent.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The foregoing narrative will have given the reader some idea
of the state in which the last expedition reached the bottom of
that extensive and magnificent basin which receives the waters of
the Murray. The men were, indeed, so exhausted, in strength, and
their provisions so much reduced by the time they gained the
coast, that I doubted much, whether either would hold out to such
place as we might hope for relief. Yet, reduced as the whole of
us were from previous exertion, beset as our homeward path was by
difficulty and danger, and involved as our eventual safety was in
obscurity and doubt, I could not but deplore the necessity that
obliged me to re-cross the Lake Alexandrina (as I had named it in
honour of the heir apparent to the British crown), and to
relinquish the examination of its western shores. We were borne
over its ruffled <!--page 230 ENVIRONS OF LAKE ALEXANDRINA. /page-->and agitated surface with such rapidity, that I
had scarcely time to view it as we passed; but, cursory as my
glance was, I could but think I was leaving behind me the fullest
reward of our toil, in a country that would ultimately render our
discoveries valuable, and benefit the colony for whose interests
we were engaged. Hurried, I would repeat, as my view of it was,
my eye never fell on a country of more promising aspect, or of
more favourable position, than that which occupies the space
between the lake and the ranges of St. Vincent's Gulf, and,
continuing northerly from Mount Barker, stretches away, without
any visible boundary. </p>

<p>It appeared to me that, unless nature had deviated from her
usual laws, this tract of country could not but be fertile,
situated as it was to receive the mountain deposits on the one
hand, and those of the lake upon the other. </p>

<p>In my report to the Colonial Government, however, I did not
feel myself justified in stating, to their full extent, opinions
that were founded on probability and conjecture alone. But,
although I was guarded in this particular, I strongly recommended
a further examination of the coast, from the most eastern point
of Encounter Bay, to the head St. Vincent's Gulf, to ascertain if
any other than the known channel existed among the sand-hills of
the former, or if, as I had every reason to hope from the great
extent of water to the N.W., there was a practicable
communication with the lake from the other; and I ventured to
predict, that a closer survey of the interjacent country, would
be attended with the most beneficial results; nor have I a doubt
that the pro<!--page 231 FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE COAST. /page-->montory of Cape Jervis would ere this have been
settled, had Captain Barker lived to complete his official
reports. </p>

<p>The governor, General Darling, whose multifarious duties might
well have excused him from paying attention to distant objects,
hesitated not a moment when he thought the interests of the
colony, whose welfare he so zealously promoted, appeared to be
concerned; and he determined to avail himself of the services of
Captain Collet Barker, of the 39th regiment, who was about to be
recalled from King George's Sound, in order to satisfy himself as
to the correctness of my views. </p>

<p>Captain Barker had not long before been removed from Port
Raffles, on the northern coast, where he had had much intercourse
with the natives, and had frequently trusted himself wholly in
their hands. It was not, however, merely on account of his
conciliating manners, and knowledge of the temper and habits of
the natives, that he was particularly fitted for the duty upon
which it was the governor's pleasure to employ him. He was, in
addition, a man of great energy of character, and of much and
various information. </p>

<p>Orders having reached Sydney, directing the establishment
belonging to New South Wales to be withdrawn, prior to the
occupation of King George's Sound by the government of Western
Australia, the <i>Isabella</i> schooner was sent to receive the
troops and prisoners on board; and Captain Barker was directed,
as soon as he should have handed over the settlement to Captain
Stirling, to proceed to Cape <!--page 232 CAPT. BARKER'S SURVEY. /page-->Jervis, from which point it was
thought he could best carry on a survey not only of the coast but
also of the interior. </p>

<p>This excellent and zealous officer sailed from King George's
Sound, on the 10th of April, 1831, and arrived off Cape Jervis on
the 13th. He was attended by Doctor Davies, one of the assistant
surgeons of his regiment, and by Mr. Kent, of the Commissariat.
It is to the latter gentleman that the public are indebted for
the greater part of the following details; he having attended
Captain Barker closely during the whole of this short but
disastrous excursion, and made notes as copious as they are
interesting. At the time the <i>Isabella</i> arrived off Cape
Jervis, the weather was clear and favourable. Captain Barker
consequently stood into St. Vincent's Gulf, keeping, as near as
practicable, to the eastern shore, in soundings that varied from
six to ten fathoms, upon sand and mud. His immediate object was
to ascertain if there was any communication with the lake
Alexandrina from the gulf. He ascended to lat. 34° 40´ where he
fully satisfied himself that no channel did exist between them.
He found, however, that the ranges behind Cape Jervis terminated
abruptly at Mount Lofty, in lat. 34° 56´, and, that a flat and
wooded country succeeded to the N. and N.E. The shore of the gulf
tended more to the N.N.W., and mud flats and mangrove swamps
prevailed along it. </p>

<p>Mr. Kent informs me, that they landed for the first time on
the 15th, but that they returned almost immediately to the
vessel. On the 17th, Captain Barker again landed, <!--page 233 INVITING COUNTRY&mdash;MOUNT LOFTY. /page-->with the
intention of remaining on shore for two or three days. He was
accompanied by Mr. Kent, his servant Mills, and two soldiers. The
boat went to the place at which they had before landed, as they
thought they had discovered a small river with a bar entrance.
They crossed the bar, and ascertained that it was a narrow inlet,
of four miles in length, that terminated at the base of the
ranges. The party were quite delighted with the aspect of the
country on either side of the inlet, and with the bold and
romantic scenery behind them. The former bore the appearance of
natural meadows, lightly timbered, and covered with a variety of
grasses. The soil was observed to be a rich, fat, chocolate
coloured earth, probably the decomposition of the deep blue
limestone, that showed itself along the coast hereabouts. On the
other hand, a rocky glen made a cleft in the ranges at the head
of the inlet; and they were supplied with abundance of fresh
water which remained in the deeper pools that had been filled by
the torrents during late rains. The whole neighbourhood was so
inviting that the party slept at the head of the inlet. </p>

<p>In the morning, Captain Barker proceeded to ascend Mount
Lofty, accompanied by Mr. Kent and his servant, leaving the two
soldiers at the bivouac, at which he directed them to remain
until his return. Mr. Kent says they kept the ridge all the way,
and rose above the sea by a gradual ascent. The rock-formation of
the lower ranges appeared to be an argillaceous schist; the sides
and summit of the ranges were covered with verdure, and the trees
<!--page 234 MOUNT LOFTY AND ITS ENVIRONS. /page-->upon them were of more than ordinary size. The view to the
eastward was shut out by other ranges, parallel to those on which
they were; below them to the westward, the same pleasing kind of
country that flanked the inlet still continued. </p>

<p>In the course of the day they passed round the head of a deep
ravine, whose smooth and grassy sides presented a beautiful
appearance. The party stood 600 feet above the bed of a small
rivulet that occupied the bottom of the ravine. In some places
huge blocks of granite interrupted its course, in others the
waters had worn the rock smooth. The polish of these rocks was
quite beautiful, and the veins of red and white quartz which
traversed them, looked like mosaic work. They did not gain the
top of Mount Lofty, but slept a few miles beyond the ravine. In
the morning they continued their journey, and, crossing Mount
Lofty, descended northerly, to a point from which the range bent
away a little to the N.N.E., and then terminated. The view from
this point was much more extensive than that from Mount Lofty
itself. They overlooked a great part of the gulf, and could
distinctly see the mountains at the head of it to the N.N.W. To
the N.W. there was a considerable indentation in the coast, which
had escaped Captain Barker's notice when examining it. A
mountain, very similar to Mount Lofty, bore due east of them, and
appeared to be the termination of its range. They were separated
by a valley of about ten miles in width, the appearance of which
was not favourable. Mr. Kent states to me, that Capt. Bar<!--page 235 MOUNT BARKER. /page-->ker
observed at the time that he thought it probable I had mistaken
this hill for Mount Lofty, since it shut out the view of the lake
from him, and therefore he naturally concluded, I could not have
seen Mount Lofty. I can readily imagine such an error to have
been made by me, more especially as I remember that at the time I
was taking bearings in the lake, I thought Captain Flinders had
not given Mount Lofty, as I then conceived it to be, its proper
position in longitude. Both hills are in the same parallel of
latitude. The mistake on my part is obvious. I have corrected it
in the charts, and have availed myself of the opportunity thus
afforded me of perpetuating, as far as I can, the name of an
inestimable companion in Captain Barker himself </p>

<p>Immediately below the point on which they stood, Mr. Kent
says, a low undulating country extended to the northward, as far
as he could see. It was partly open, and partly wooded; and was
every where covered with verdure. It continued round to the
eastward, and apparently ran down southerly, at the opposite base
of the mount Barker Range. I think there can be but little doubt
that my view from the S.E., that is, from the lake, extended over
the same or a part of the same country. Captain Barker again
slept on the summit of the range, near a large basin that looked
like the mouth of a crater, in which huge fragments of rocks made
a scene of the utmost confusion. These rocks were a coarse grey
granite, of which the higher parts and northern termination of
the Mount Lofty range are evidently formed; for Mr. Kent remarks
that it superseded the schistose formation at <!--page 236 AUSTRALIAN SALMON. /page-->the ravine we have
noticed&mdash;and that, subsequently, the sides of the hills
became more broken, and valleys, or gullies, more properly
speaking, very numerous. Captain Barker estimated the height of
Mount Lofty above the sea at 2,400 feet, and the distance of its
summit from the coast at eleven miles. Mr. Kent says they were
surprised at the size of the trees on the immediate brow of it;
they measured one and found it to be 43 feet in girth. Indeed, he
adds, vegetation did not appear to have suffered either from its
elevated position, or from any prevailing wind. Eucalypti were
the general timber on the ranges; one species of which,
resembling strongly the black butted-gum, was remarkable for a
scent peculiar to its bark. </p>

<p>The party rejoined the soldiers on the 21st, and enjoyed the
supply of fish which they had provided for them. The soldiers had
amused themselves by fishing during Captain Barker's absence, and
had been abundantly successful. Among others they had taken a
kind of salmon, which, though inferior in size, resembled in
shape, in taste, and in the colour of its flesh, the salmon of
Europe. I fancied that a fish which I observed with extremely
glittering scales, in the mouth of a seal, when myself on the
coast, must have been of this kind; and I have no doubt that the
lake is periodically visited by salmon, and that these fish
retain their habits of entering fresh water at particular
seasons, also in the southern hemisphere. </p>

<p>Immediately behind Cape Jervis, there is a small bay, in which
according to the information of the sealers who frequent Kangaroo
Island, there is good and safe anchor<!--page 237 SURVEY OF THE COAST. /page-->age for seven months in the
year, that is to say, during the prevalence of the E. and N.E.
winds. </p>

<p>Captain Barker landed on the 21st on this rocky point at the
northern extremity of this bay. He had, however, previously to
this, examined the indentation in the coast which he had observed
from Mount Lofty, and had ascertained that it was nothing more
than an inlet; a spit of sand, projecting from the shore at right
angles with it, concealed the month of the inlet. They took the
boat to examine this point, and carried six fathoms soundings
round the head of the spit to the mouth of the inlet, when it
shoaled to two fathoms, and the landing was observed to be bad,
by reason of mangrove swamps on either side of it. Mr. Kent, I
think, told me that this inlet was from ten to twelve miles long.
Can it be that a current setting out of it at times, has thrown
up the sand-bank that protects its mouth, and that trees, or any
other obstacle, have hidden its further prolongation from Captain
Barker's notice? I have little hope that such is the case, but
the remark is not an idle one. </p>

<p>Between this inlet and the one formerly mentioned, a small and
clear stream was discovered, to which Captain Barker kindly gave
my name. On landing, the party, which consisted of the same
persons as the former one, found themselves in a valley, which
opened direct upon the bay. It was confined to the north from the
chief range by a lateral ridge, that gradually declined towards
and terminated at, the rocky point on which they had landed. <!--page 238 BEAUTIFUL VALLEYS. /page-->The
other side of the valley was formed of a continuation of the main
range, which also gradually declined to the south, and appeared
to be connected with the hills at the extremity of the cape. The
valley was from nine to ten miles in length, and from three to
four in breadth. In crossing it, they ascertained that the lagoon
from which the schooner had obtained a supply of water, was
filled by a watercourse that came down its centre. The soil in
the valley was rich, but stony in some parts. There was an
abundance of pasture over the whole, from amongst which they
started numerous kangaroos. The scenery towards the ranges was
beautiful and romantic, and the general appearance of the country
such as to delight the whole party. </p>

<p>Preserving a due east course, Captain Barker passed over the
opposite range of hills, and descended almost immediately into a
second valley that continued to the southwards. Its soil was poor
and stony, and it was covered with low scrub. Crossing it, they
ascended the opposite range, from the summit of which they had a
view of Encounter Bay. An extensive flat stretched from beneath
them to the eastward, and was backed, in the distance, by sand
hummocks, and low wooded hills. The extreme right of the flat
rested upon the coast, at a rocky point near which there were two
or three islands. From the left a beautiful valley opened upon
it. A strong and clear rivulet from this valley traversed the
flat obliquely, and fell into the sea at the rocky point, or a
little to the southward of it. The hills forming the opposite
side of the valley had <!--page 239 OUTLET OF LAKE TO THE SEA. /page-->already terminated. Captain Barker,
therefore, ascended to higher ground, and, at length, obtained a
view of the Lake Alexandrina, and the channel of its
communication with the sea to the N.E. He now descended to the
flat, and frequently expressed his anxious wish to Mr. Kent that
I had been one of their number to enjoy the beauty of the scenery
around them, and to participate in their labours. Had fate so
ordained it, it is possible the melancholy tragedy that soon
after occurred might have been averted. </p>

<p>At the termination of the flat they found themselves upon the
banks of the channel, and close to the sand hillock under which
my tents had been pitched. From this point they proceeded along
the line of sand-hills to the outlet; from which it would appear
that Kangaroo Island is not visible, but that the distant point
which I mistook for it was the S.E. angle of Cape Jervis. I have
remarked, in describing that part of the coast, that there is a
sand-hill to the eastward of the inlet, under which the tide runs
strong, and the water is deep. Captain Barker judged the breadth
of the channel to be a quarter of a mile, and he expressed a
desire to swim across it to the sand-hill to take bearings, and
to ascertain the nature of the strand beyond it to the eastward. </p>

<p>It unfortunately happened, that he was the only one of the
party who could swim well, in consequence of which his people
remonstrated with him on the danger of making the attempt
unattended. Notwithstanding, however, that he was seriously
indisposed, he stripped, and after Mr. Kent <!--page 240 CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING /page-->had fastened his
compass on his head for him, he plunged into the water, and with
difficulty gained the opposite side; to effect which took him
nine minutes and fifty-eight seconds. His anxious comrades saw
him ascend the hillock, and take several bearings; he then
descended the farther side, and was never seen by them again. </p>

<p>For a considerable time Mr. Kent remained stationary, in
momentary expectation of his return; but at length, taking the
two soldiers with him, he proceeded along the shore in search of
wood for a fire. At about a quarter of a mile, the soldiers
stopped and expressed their wish to return, as their minds
misgave them, and they feared that Captain Barker had met with
some accident. While conversing, they heard a distant shout, or
cry, which Mr. Kent thought resembled the call of the natives,
but which the soldiers positively declared to be the voice of a
white man. On their return to their companions, they asked if any
sounds had caught their ears, to which they replied in the
negative. The wind was blowing from the E.S.E., in which
direction Captain Barker had gone; and, to me, the fact of the
nearer party not having heard that which must have been his cries
for assistance, is satisfactorily accounted for, as, being
immediately under the hill, the sounds must have passed over
their heads to be heard more distinctly at the distance at which
Mr. Kent and the soldiers stood. It is more than probable, that
while his men were expressing their anxiety about him, the
fearful tragedy was enacting which it has become my painful task
to detail. <!--page 241 THE LOSS OF CAPTAIN BARKER. /page--> </p>

<p>Evening closed in without any signs of Captain Barker's
return, or any circumstance by which Mr. Kent could confirm his
fears that he had fallen into the hands of the natives. For,
whether it was that the tribe which had shown such decided
hostility to me when on the coast had not observed the party,
none made their appearance; and if I except two, who crossed the
channel when Mr. Kent was in search of wood, they had neither
seen nor heard any; and Captain Barker's enterprising disposition
being well known to his men, hopes were still entertained that he
was safe. A large fire was kindled, and the party formed a silent
and anxious group around it. Soon after night-fall, however,
their attention was roused by the sounds of the natives, and it
was at length discovered, that they had lighted a chain of small
fires between the sand-hill Captain Barker had ascended and the
opposite side of the channel, around which their women were
chanting their melancholy dirge. It struck upon the ears of the
listeners with an ominous thrill, and assured them of the
certainty of the irreparable loss they had sustained. All night
did those dismal sounds echo along that lonely shore, but as
morning dawned, they ceased, and Mr. Kent and his companions were
again left in anxiety and doubt. They, at length, thought it most
advisable to proceed to the schooner to advise with Doctor
Davies. They traversed the beach with hasty steps, but did not
get on board till the following day. It was then determined to
procure assistance from the sealers on Kangaroo Island, as the
only means by which they could ascertain their leader's fate, and
they ac<!--page 242 ACCOUNT OF HIS MURDER. /page-->cordingly entered American Harbour. For a certain reward,
one of the men agreed to accompany Mr. Kent to the main with a
native woman, to communicate with the tribe that was supposed to
have killed him. They landed at or near the rocky point of
Encounter Bay, where they were joined by two other natives, one
of whom was blind. The woman was sent forward for intelligence,
and on her return gave the following details: </p>

<p>It appears that at a very considerable distance from the first
sand-hill, there is another to which Captain Barker must have
walked, for the woman stated that three natives were going to the
shore from their tribe, and that they crossed his tract. Their
quick perception immediately told them it was an unusual
impression. They followed upon it, and saw Captain Barker
returning. They hesitated for a long time to approach him, being
fearful of the instrument he carried. At length, however, they
closed upon him. Capt. Barker tried to soothe them, but finding
that they were determined to attack him, he made for the water
from which he could not have been very distant. One of the blacks
immediately threw his spear and struck him in the hip. This did
not, however, stop him. He got among the breakers, when he
received the second spear in the shoulder. On this, turning
round, he received a third full in the breast: with such deadly
precision do these savages cast their weapons. It would appear
that the third spear was already on its flight when Capt. Barker
turned, and it is to be hoped, that it was at once mortal. He
fell on his back into the water. The natives then <!--page 243 HIS CHARACTER. /page-->rushed in, and
dragging him out by the legs, seized their spears, and indicted
innumerable wounds upon his body; after which, they threw it into
deep water, and the sea-tide carried it away. </p>

<p>Such, we have every reason to believe, was the untimely fate
of this amiable and talented man. It is a melancholy satisfaction
to me thus publicly to record his worth; instrumental, as I
cannot but in some measure consider my last journey to have been
in leading to this fatal catastrophe. Captain Barker was in
disposition, as he was in the close of his life, in many respects
similar to Captain Cook. Mild, affable, and attentive, he had the
esteem and regard of every companion, and the respect of every
one under him. Zealous in the discharge of his public duties,
honourable and just in private life; a lover and a follower of
science; indefatigable and dauntless in his pursuits; a steady
friend, an entertaining companion; charitable, kind-hearted,
disinterested, and sincere&mdash;the task is equally difficult
to find adequate expressions of praise or of regret. In him the
king lost one of his most valuable officers, and his regiment one
of its most efficient members. Beloved as he was, the news of his
loss struck his numerous friends with sincere grief, but by none
was it more severely felt than by the humble individual who has
endeavoured thus feebly to draw his portrait. </p>

<p>From the same source from which the particulars of his death
were obtained, it was reported that the natives who perpetrated
the deed were influenced by no other <!--page 244 FEATURES OF THE COUNTRY, /page-->motive than curiosity to
ascertain if they had power to kill a white man. But we must be
careful in giving credit to this, for it is much more probable
that the cruelties exercised by the sealers towards the blacks
along the south coast, may have instigated the latter to take
vengeance on the innocent as well as on the guilty. It will be
seen, by a reference to the chart, that Captain Barker, by
crossing the channel, threw himself into the very hands of that
tribe which had evinced such determined hostility to myself and
my men. He got into the rear of their strong hold, and was
sacrificed to those feelings of suspicion, and to that desire of
revenge, which the savages never lose sight of until they have
been gratified. </p>

<p>It yet remains for me to state that when Mr. Kent returned to
the schooner, after this irreparable loss, he kept to the south
of the place at which he had crossed the first range with Captain
Barker, and travelled through a valley right across the
promontory. He thus discovered that there was a division in the
ranges, through which there was a direct and level road from the
little bay on the northern extremity of which they had last
landed in St. Vincent's Gulf, to the rocky point of Encounter
Bay. The importance of this fact will be better estimated, when
it is known that good anchorage is secured to small vessels
inside the island that lies off the point of Encounter Bay, which
is rendered still safer by a horse shoe reef that forms, as it
were, a thick wall to break the swell of the sea. But this
anchorage is not safe for more than five months in the year.
Independently of these points, however, Mr. Kent remarks, <!--page 245 AND CAPABILITIES OF THE COAST. /page-->that
the spit a little to the north of Mount Lofty would afford good
shelter to minor vessels under its lee. When the nature of the
country is taken into consideration, and the facility of entering
that which lies between the ranges and the Lake Alexandrina, from
the south, and of a direct communication with the lake itself,
the want of an extensive harbour will, in some measure, be
compensated for, more especially when it is known that within
four leagues of Cape Jervis, a port little inferior to Port
Jackson, with a safe and broad entrance, exists at Kangaroo
Island. The sealers have given this spot the name of American
Harbour. In it, I am informed, vessels are completely
land-locked, and secure from every wind. Kangaroo Island is not,
however, fertile by any means. It abounds in shallow lakes filled
with salt water during high tides, and which, by evaporation,
yield a vast quantity of salt. </p>

<p>I gathered from the sealers that neither the promontory
separating St. Vincent from Spencer's Gulf, nor the neighbourhood
of Port Lincoln, are other than barren and sandy wastes. They all
agree in describing Port Lincoln itself as a magnificent
roadstead, but equally agree as to the sterility of its shores.
It appears, therefore, that the promontory of Cape Jervis owes
its superiority to its natural features; in fact, to the
mountains that occupy its centre, to the debris that has been
washed from them, and to the decomposition of the better
description of its rocks. Such is the case at Illawarra, where
the mountains approach the sea; such indeed is the case every
where, at a certain distance from mountain ranges. <!--page 246 ADAPTION OF THIS PART OF /page--> </p>

<p>From the above account it would appear that a spot has, at
length, been found upon the south coast of New Holland, to which
the colonist might venture with every prospect of success, and in
whose valleys the exile might hope to build for himself and for
his family a peaceful and prosperous home. All who have ever
landed upon the eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf, agree as to
the richness of its soil, and the abundance of its pasture.
Indeed, if we cast our eyes upon the chart, and examine the
natural features of the country behind Cape Jervis, we shall no
longer wonder at its differing in soil and fertility from the low
and sandy tracks that generally prevail along the shores of
Australia. Without entering largely into the consideration of the
more remote advantages that would, in all human probability,
result from the establishment of a colony, rather than a penal
settlement, at St. Vincent's Gulf, it will be expedient to glance
hastily over the preceding narrative, and, disengaging it from
all extraneous matter, to condense, as much as possible, the
information it contains respecting the country itself; for I have
been unable to introduce any passing remark, lest I should break
the thread of an interesting detail. </p>

<p>The country immediately behind Cape Jervis may, strictly
speaking, be termed a promontory, bounded to the west by St.
Vincent's Gulf, and to the east by the lake Alexandrina, and the
sandy track separating that basin from the sea. Supposing a line
to be drawn from the parallel of 34° 40´ to the eastward, it
will strike the Murray river about 25 miles above the head of the
lake, and will clear the ranges, of which Mount Lofty and Mount
Barker are the respective <!--page 247 THE COUNTRY FOR COLONISATION. /page-->terminations. This line will cut off a
space whose greatest breadth will be 55 miles, whose length from
north to south will be 75, and whose surface exceeds 7 millions
of acres; from which if we deduct 2 millions for the unavailable
hills, we shall have 5 millions of acres of land, of rich soil,
upon which no scrub exists, and whose most distant points are
accessible, through a level country on the one hand, and by water
on the other. The southern extremity of the ranges can be turned
by that valley through which Mr. Kent returned to the schooner,
after Captain Barker's death. It is certain, therefore, that this
valley not only secures so grand a point, but also presents a
level line of communication from the small bay immediately to the
north of the cape, to the rocky point of Encounter Bay, at both
of which places there is safe anchorage at different periods of
the year. </p>

<p>The only objection that can be raised to the occupation of
this spot, is the want of an available harbour. Yet it admits of
great doubt whether the contiguity of Kangaroo Island to Cape
Jervis, (serving as it does to break the force of the prevailing
winds, as also of the heavy swell that would otherwise roll
direct into the bay,) and the fact of its possessing a safe and
commodious harbour, certainly at an available distance, does not
in a great measure remove the objection. Certain it is that no
port, with the exception of that on the shores of which the
capital of Australia is situated, offers half the convenience of
this, although it be detached between three and four leagues from
the main. </p>

<p>On the other hand it would appear, that there is no place <!--page 248 HINTS FOR FUTURE EXPEDITIONS. /page-->from
which at any time the survey of the more central parts of the
continent could be so effectually carried on; for in a country
like Australia, where the chief obstacle to be apprehended in
travelling is the want of water, the facilities afforded by the
Murray and its tributaries, are indisputable; and I have little
doubt that the very centre of the continent might be gained by a
judicious and enterprising expedition. Certainly it is most
desirable to ascertain whether the river I have supposed to be
the Darling be really so or not. I have stated my objection to
depots, but I think that if a party commenced its operations upon
the Murray from the junction upwards, and, after ascertaining the
fact of its ultimate course, turned away to the N.W. up one of
the tributaries of the Murray, with a supply of six months'
provisions, the results would be of the most satisfactory kind,
and the features of the country be wholly developed. I cannot, I
think, conclude this work better than by expressing a hope, that
the Colonial Government will direct such measures to be adopted
as may be necessary for the extension of our geographical
knowledge in Australia. The facilities of fitting out expeditions
in New South Wales, render the expenses of little moment, when
compared with the importance of the object in view; and although
I am labouring under the effects of former attempts, yet would I
willingly give such assistance as I could to carry such an object
into effect.</p>

<h5>GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS FOUND TO THE SOUTH-WEST OF PORT JACKSON.</h5>

<p>Considering the nature of the country over which the first
expedition travelled, it could hardly have been expected that its
geological specimens would be numerous. It will appear, however,
from the following list of rocks collected during the second
expedition, that the geological formation of the mountains to the
S.W. of Port Jackson is as various as that to the N.W. of it is
mountainous. The specimens are described not according to their
natural order, but in the succession in which they were found,
commencing from Yass Plains, and during the subsequent stages of
the journey. </p>

<p>Sandstone, Old Red.&mdash;Found on various parts of Yass
Plains, in contact with <!--page 250 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. I. /page--> </p>

<p>Limestone, Transition.&mdash;Colour dark grey; composes the
bed of the Yass River, and apparently traverses the sandstone
formation. Yass Plains lie 170 miles to the S.W. of Sydney. </p>

<p>Sandstone, Old Red.&mdash;Again succeeds the limestone, and
continues to the N.W. to a considerable distance over a poor and
scrubby country, covered for the most part with a dwarf species
of Eucalyptus. </p>

<p>Granite.&mdash;Colour grey; feldspar, black mica, and
quartz: succeeds the sandstone, and continues to the S.W. as far
as the Morumbidgee River, over an open forest country broken into
hill and dale. It is generally on these granite rocks that the
best grazing is found. </p>

<p>Greywacke.&mdash;Colour grey, of light hue, or dark, with
black specks. Soft.&mdash;Composition of a part of the ranges
that form the valley of the Morumbidgee. </p>

<p>Serpentine.&mdash;Colour green of different shades, striped
sulphur yellow; slaty fracture, soft and greasy to the touch.
Forms hills of moderate elevation, of peculiarly sharp spine,
resting on quartz. Composition of most of the ranges opposite the
Doomot River on the Morumbidgee, in lat. 35° 4´ and long. 147°
40´. </p>

<p>Quartz.&mdash;Colour snow-white; formation of the higher
ranges on the left bank of the Morumbidgee, in the same latitude
and longitude as above; showing in large blocks on the sides of
the hills. </p>

<p>Slaty Quartz, with varieties.&mdash;Found with the quartz
rock, in a state of decomposition. <!--page 251 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. I. /page--> </p>

<p>Granite.&mdash;Succeeds the serpentine, of light colour;
feldspar decomposed; mica, glittering and silvery white. </p>

<p>Sandstone, Old Red.&mdash;Composition of the more distant
ranges on the Morumbidgee. Forms abrupt precipices over the river
flats; of sterile appearance, and covered with Banksias and
scrub. </p>

<p>Mica Slate.&mdash;Colour dark brown, approaching red; mica
glittering. The hills enclosing Pondebadgery Plain at the gorge
of the valley of the Morumbidgee, are composed of this rock. They
are succeeded by </p>

<p>Sandstone.&mdash;Which rises abruptly from the river in
perpendicular cliffs, of 145 feet in height. </p>

<p>Jasper and Quartz.&mdash;Colour red and white. Forms the
slope of the above sandstone, and may be considered the outermost
of the rocks connected with the Eastern or Blue Mountain Ranges.
It will be remembered that jasper and quartz were likewise found
on a plain near the Darling River, precisely similar to the
above, although occurring at so great a distance from each other.
</p>

<p>Granite.&mdash;Light red colour; composition of a small
isolated hill, to all appearance wholly unconnected with the
neighbouring ranges. This specimen is very similar to that found
in the bed of New-Year's Creek. </p>

<p>Breccia.&mdash;Silicious cement, composed of a variety of
pebbles. Formation of the most <i>westerly</i> of the hills
between the Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers. This conglomerate was
also found to compose the minor and most westerly of the
elevations of the more northern interior. <!--page 252 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. I. /page--> </p>

<p>Chrystallized Sulphate of Lime.&mdash;Found embedded in the
deep alluvial soil in the banks of the Morumbidgee River, in lat.
34° 30´ S., and long. 144° 55´ E. The same substance was
found on the banks of the Darling, in lat. 29° 49´ S., and in
long. 145° 18´ E. </p>

<p>A reference to the chart will show that the Morumbidgee, from
the first of the above positions, may be said to have entered the
almost dead level of the interior. No elevation occurs to the
westward for several hundreds of miles. A coarse grit
occasionally traversed the beds of the rivers, and their lofty
banks of clay or marl appear to be based on sandstone and
granitic sand. The latter occurs in slabs of four inches in
thickness, divided by a line of saffron-coloured sand, and seems
to have been subjected to fusion, as if the particles or grains
had been cemented together by fusion. </p>

<p>The first decided break that takes place in the level of the
interior occurs upon the right bank of the Murray, a little below
the junction of the Rufus with it. A cliff of from 120 to 130
feet in perpendicular elevation here flanks the river for about
200 yards, when it recedes from it, and forms a spacious
amphitheatre that is occupied by semicircular hillocks, that
partake of the same character as the cliff itself; the face of
which showed the various substances of which it was composed in
horizontal lines, that if prolonged would cut the same substance
in the hillocks. Based upon a soft white sandstone, a bed of clay
formed the lowest part of the cliff; upon this bed of clay, a bed
of chalk reposed; this chalk was superseded by a thick bed of
saponaceous earth, whilst the summit of the cliff was composed of
a bright red sand. Semi-opal and hydrate of silex were found in
the chalk, and some beautiful specimens of brown menelite were
collected from the upper stratum of the cliff. <!--page 253 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. I. /page--> </p>

<p>A little below this singular place, the country again
declines, when a tertiary fossil formation shows itself, which,
rising gradually as an inclined plain, ultimately attains an
elevation of 300 feet. This formation continues to the very
coast, since large masses of the rock were observed in the
channel of communication between the lake and the ocean; and the
hills to the left of the channel were based upon it. This great
bank cannot, therefore, average less than from seventy to ninety
miles in width. At its commencement, it strikingly resembled
skulls piled one on the other, as well in colour as appearance.
This effect had been produced by the constant rippling of water
against the rock. The softer parts had been washed away, and the
shells (a bed of Turritella) alone remained. </p>

<p>Plate I, Figures 1, 2, and 3, represent the selenite
formation. </p>

<p>Plate II, represents a mass of the rock containing numerous
kinds of shells, of which the following are the most conspicuous:</p>

<h5>OFFICIAL REPORT TO THE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT.</h5>

<hr width="15%">

<h5 class="small">GOVERNMENT ORDER.</h5>

<p class="right"><i>Colonial Secretary's Office, Sydney, <br>
May</i> 10, 1830. </p>

<p>His Excellency the Governor has much satisfaction in
publishing the following report of the proceedings of an
expedition undertaken for the purpose of tracing the course of
the river &ldquo;Morumbidgee,&rdquo; and of ascertaining
whether it communicated with the coast forming the southern
boundary of the colony. </p>

<p>The expedition, which was placed under the direction of
Captain Sturt, of his Majesty's 39th Regiment, commenced its
progress down the &ldquo;Morumbidgee&rdquo; on the 7th day
of January last, having been occupied twenty-one days in
performing the journey from Sydney. </p>

<p>On the 14th January they entered a new river running from east
to west, now called the &ldquo;Murray,&rdquo; into which
the &ldquo;Morumbidgee&rdquo; flows. </p>

<p>After pursuing the course of the &ldquo;Murray&rdquo;
for several days, the expedition observed another river (supposed
to be <!--page 258 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page-->that which Captain Sturt discovered on his former
expedition), uniting with the &ldquo;Murray&rdquo; which
they examined about five miles above the junction. </p>

<p>The expedition again proceeded down the
&ldquo;Murray,&rdquo; and fell in with another of its
tributaries flowing from the south east, which Captain Sturt has
designated the &ldquo;Lindesay;&rdquo; and on the 8th
February the &ldquo;Murray&rdquo; was found to enter or
form a lake, of from fifty to sixty miles in length, and from
thirty to forty in breadth, lying immediately to the eastward of
gulf St. Vincent, and extending to the southward, to the shore of
&ldquo;Encounter Bay.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Thus has Captain Sturt added largely, and in a highly
important degree, to the knowledge previously possessed of the
interior. </p>

<p>His former expedition ascertained the fate of the rivers
Macquarie and Castlereagh, on which occasion he also discovered a
river which, there is every reason to believe, is, in ordinary
seasons, of considerable magnitude. </p>

<p>Should this, as Captain Sturt supposes, prove to be the same
river as that above-mentioned, as uniting with the
&ldquo;Murray,&rdquo; the existence of an interior water
communication for several hundreds of miles, extending from the
northward of &ldquo;Mount Harris,&rdquo; down to the
southern coast of the colony, will have been established. </p>

<p>It is to be regretted, that circumstances did not permit of a
more perfect examination of the lake, (which has been called
&ldquo;Alexandrina&rdquo;), as the immediate vicinage of
Gulf St. Vincent furnishes a just ground of hope that a more
practicable and useful communication may be discovered in that
direction, than the channel which leads into &ldquo;Encounter
Bay.&rdquo; <!--page 259 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page--> </p>

<p>The opportunity of recording a second time the services
rendered to the colony by Captain Sturt, is as gratifying to the
government which directed the undertaking, as it is creditable to
the individual who so successfully conducted it to its
termination.&mdash;It is an additional cause of satisfaction
to add, that every one, according to his sphere of action, has a
claim to a proportionate degree of applause. All were exposed
alike to the same privations and fatigue, and every one submitted
with patience, manifesting the most anxious desire for the
success of the expedition. The zeal of Mr. George M'Leay, the
companion of Captain Sturt, when example was so important, could
not fail to have the most salutary effect; and the obedience,
steadiness, and good conduct of the men employed, merit the
highest praise. </p>

<p class="right">By his Excellency's command, <br>
ALEXANDER M'LEAY.</p>

<hr width="15%">

<p class="right"><i>Banks of the Morumbidgee, April</i> 20<i>th</i>,
1830. </p>

<p>SIR,&mdash;The departure of Mr. George M'Leay for Sydney,
who is anxious to proceed homewards as speedily as possible,
affords me an earlier opportunity than would otherwise have
presented itself, by which to make you acquainted with the
circumstance of my return, under the divine protection, to the
located districts; and I do myself the honour of annexing a brief
account of my proceedings <!--page 260 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page-->since the last communication for the
information of His Excellency the Governor, until such time as I
shall have it in my power to give in a more detailed report. </p>

<p>On the 7th of January, agreeably to the arrangements which had
been made, I proceeded down the Morumbidgee in the whale boat,
with a complement of six hands, independent of myself and Mr.
M'Leay, holding the skiff in tow. The river, for several days,
kept a general W.S.W. course; it altered little in appearance,
nor did any material change take place in the country upon its
banks. The alluvial flats had occasionally an increased breadth
on either side of it, but the line of reeds was nowhere so
extensive as from previous appearances I had been led to expect.
About twelve miles from the depot, we passed a large creek
junction from the N.E. which, from its locality and from the
circumstance of my having been upon it in the direction of them,
I cannot but conclude originates in the marshes of the Lachlan. </p>

<p>On the 11th, the Morumbidgee became much encumbered with
fallen timber, and its current was at times so rapid that I was
under considerable apprehension for the safety of the boats. The
skiff had been upset on the 8th, and, although I could not
anticipate such an accident to the large boat, I feared she would
receive some more serious and irremediable injury. On the 14th,
these difficulties increased upon us.&mdash;The channel of the
river became more contracted, and its current more impetuous. We
had no sooner cleared one reach, than fresh and apparently
insurmountable dangers presented themselves to us in the next. I
really feared that every precaution would have proved unavailing
against such multiplied embarrassments, <!--page 261 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page-->and that ere night we
should have possessed only the wrecks of the expedition. From
this state of anxiety, however, we were unexpectedly relieved, by
our arrival at 2 p.m. at the termination of the Morumbidgee; from
which we were launched into a broad and noble river, flowing from
E. to W. at the rate of two and a half knots per hour, over a
clear and sandy bed, of a medium width of from three to four
hundred feet. </p>

<p>During the first stages of our journey upon this new river,
which evidently had its rise in the mountains of the S.E., we
made rapid progress to the W.N.W. through an unbroken and
uninteresting country of equal sameness of feature and of
vegetation. On the 23rd, as the boats were proceeding down it,
several hundreds of natives made their appearance upon the right
bank, having assembled with premeditated purposes of violence. I
was the more surprised at this show of hostility, because we had
passed on general friendly terms, not only with those on the
Morumbidgee, but of the new river. Now, however, emboldened by
numbers, they seemed determined on making the first attack, and
soon worked themselves into a state of frenzy by loud and
vehement shouting. As I observed that the water was shoaling
fast, I kept in the middle of the stream; and, under an
impression that it would be impossible for me to avoid a
conflict, prepared for an obstinate resistance. But, at the very
moment when, having arrived opposite to a large sand bank, on
which they had collected, the foremost of the blacks had already
advanced into the water, and I only awaited their nearer approach
to fire upon them, their impetuosity was restrained by the most
unlooked for and unexpected interference. They held back of a
sudden, <!--page 262 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page-->and allowed us to pass unmolested. The boat, however,
almost immediately grounded on a shoal that stretched across the
river, over which she was with some difficulty hauled into deeper
water,&mdash;when we found ourselves opposite to a large
junction from the eastward, little inferior to the river itself.
Had I been aware of this circumstance, I should have been the
more anxious with regard to any rupture with the natives, and I
was now happy to find that most of them had laid aside their
weapons and had crossed the junction, it appearing that they had
previously been on a tongue of land formed by the two streams. I
therefore landed among them to satisfy their curiosity and to
distribute a few presents before I proceeded up it. We were
obliged to use the four oars to stem the current against us; but,
as soon as we had passed the mouth, got into deeper water, and
found easier pulling, The parallel in which we struck it, and the
direction from which it came, combined to assure me that this
could be no other than the &ldquo;Darling.&rdquo; To the
distance of two miles it retained a breadth of one hundred yards
and a depth of twelve feet. Its banks were covered with verdure,
and the trees overhanging them were of finer and larger growth
than those on the new river by which we had approached it. Its
waters had a shade of green, and were more turbid than those of
its neighbours, but they were perfectly sweet to the taste. </p>

<p>Having satisfied myself on those points on which I was most
anxious, we returned to the junction to examine it more closely. </p>

<p>The angle formed by the Darling with the new river is so
acute, that neither can be said to be tributary to the other; but
more important circumstances, upon which it is <!--page 263 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page-->impossible for me
to dwell at the present moment, mark them as distinct rivers,
which have been formed by Nature for the same purposes, in remote
and opposite parts of the island. Not having as yet given a name
to the latter, I now availed myself of the opportunity of
complying with the known wishes of His Excellency the Governor,
and, at the same time, in accordance with my own feelings as a
soldier I distinguished it by that of the
&ldquo;Murray.&rdquo; </p>

<p>It had been my object to ascertain the decline of the vast
plain through which the Murray flows, that I might judge of the
probable fall of the waters of the interior; but by the most
attentive observation I could not satisfy myself upon the point.
The course of the Darling now confirmed my previous impression
that it was to the south, which direction it was evident the
Murray also, in the subsequent stages of our journey down it,
struggled to preserve; from which it was thrown by a range of
minor elevations into a more westerly one. We were carried as far
as 139° 40´ of longitude, without descending below 34° in
point of latitude; in consequence of which I expected that the
river would ultimately discharge itself, either into St.
Vincent's Gulf or that of Spencer, more especially as lofty
ranges were visible in the direction of them from the summit of
the hills behind our camp, on the 2nd of February, which I laid
down as the coast line bounding them. </p>

<p>A few days prior to the 2nd of February, we passed under some
cliffs of partial volcanic origin, and had immediately afterwards
entered a limestone country of the most singular formation. The
river, although we had passed occasional rapids of the most
dangerous kind, had maintained a sandy character from our first
acquaintance with it to the lime<!--page 264 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page-->stone division. It now forced
itself through a glen of that rock of half a mile in width,
frequently striking precipices of more than two hundred feet
perpendicular elevation, in which coral and fossil remains were
plentifully embedded. On the 3rd February it made away to the
eastward of south, in reaches of from two to four miles in
length. It gradually lost its sandy bed, and became deep, still,
and turbid; the glen expanded into a valley, and the alluvial
flats, which had hitherto been of inconsiderable size, became
proportionally extensive. The Murray increased in breadth to more
than four hundred yards, with a depth of twenty feet of water
close into the shore, and in fact formed itself into a safe and
navigable stream for any vessels of the minor class. On the 6th
the cliffs partially ceased, and on the 7th they gave place to
undulating and picturesque hills, beneath which thousands of
acres of the richest flats extended, covered, however, with
reeds, and apparently subject to overflow at any unusual rise of
the river. </p>

<p>It is remarkable that the view from the hills was always
confined.&mdash;We were apparently running parallel to a
continuation of the ranges we had seen on the 2nd, but they were
seldom visible. The country generally seemed darkly wooded, and
had occasional swells upon it, but it was one of no promise; the
timber, chiefly box and pine, being of a poor growth, and its
vegetation languid. On the 8th the hills upon the left wore a
bleak appearance, and the few trees upon them were cut down as if
by the prevailing winds. At noon we could not observe any land at
the extremity of a reach we had just entered; some gentle hills
still continued to form the left lank of the river, but the right
was hid from us by high reeds. I consequently land<!--page 265 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page-->ed to survey
the country from the nearest eminence, and found that we were
just about to enter an extensive lake which stretched away to the
S.W., the line of water meeting the horizon in that direction.
Some tolerably lofty ranges were visible to the westward at the
distance of forty miles, beneath which that shore was lost in
haze. A hill, which I prejudged to be Mount Lofty, bearing by
compass S. 141° W. More to the northward, the country was low
and unbacked by any elevations. A bold promontory, which
projected into the lake at the distance of seven leagues, ended
the view to the south along the eastern shore; between which and
the river the land also declined. The prospect altogether was
extremely gratifying, and the lake appeared to be a fitting
reservoir for the whole stream which had led us to it. </p>

<p>In the evening we passed the entrance; but a strong southerly
wind heading us, we did not gain more than nine miles. In the
morning it shifted to the N.E. where we stood out for the
promontory on a S.S.W. course. At noon we were abreast of it,
when a line of sand hummocks was ahead, scarcely visible in
consequence of the great refraction about them; but an open sea
behind us from the N.N.W. to the N.N.E. points of the compass. A
meridian altitude observed here, placed us in 35° 25´ 15´´ S.
lat.&mdash;At 1, I changed our course a little to the
westward, and at 4 p.m. entered an arm of the lake leading W.S.W.
On the point, at the entrance, some natives had assembled, but I
could not communicate with them. They were both painted and
armed, and evidently intended to resist our landing. Wishing,
however, to gain some information from them, I proceeded a short
distance <!--page 266 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page-->below their haunt, and landed for the night, in hopes
that, seeing us peaceably disposed, they would have approached
the tents; but as they kept aloof, we continued our journey in
the morning. The water, which had risen ten inches during the
night, had fallen again in the same proportion, and we were
stopped by shoals shortly after starting. In hopes that the
return of tide would have enabled us to float over them, we
waited for it very patiently, but were ultimately obliged to drag
the boat across a mud-flat of more than a quarter of a mile into
deeper water; but, after a run of about twenty minutes, were
again checked by sand banks. My endeavours to push beyond a
certain point were unsuccessful, and I was at length under the
necessity of landing upon the south shore for the night. Some
small hummocks were behind us, on the other side of which I had
seen the ocean from our morning's position; and whilst the men
were pitching the tents, walked over them in company with Mr.
M'Leay to the sea shore, having struck the coast at Encounter
Bay, Cape Jervis, bearing by compass S. 81° W. distant between
three and four leagues, and Kangaroo Island S.E. extremity S.
60° W. distant from nine to ten. </p>

<p>Thirty-two days had elapsed since we had left the depot, and I
regretted in this stage of our journey, that I could not with
prudence remain an hour longer on the coast than was necessary
for me to determine the exit of the lake. From the angle of the
channel on which we were, a bright sand-hill was visible at about
nine miles distance to the E.S.E.; which, it struck me, was the
eastern side of the passage communicating with the ocean. Having
failed in our attempts to proceed further in the boat, and the ap<!--page 267 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page-->pearance
of the shoals at low water having convinced me of the
impracticability of it, I determined on an excursion along the
sea-shore to the southward and eastward, in anxious hopes that it
would be a short one; for as we had had a series of winds from
the S.W. which had now changed to the opposite quarter, I feared
we should have to pull across the lake in our way homewards. I
left the camp therefore at an early hour, in company with Mr.
M'Leay and Fraser, and at day-break arrived opposite to the
sand-bank I have mentioned. Between us and it the entrance into
the back water ran. The passage is at all periods of the tide
rather more than a quarter of a mile in width, and is of
sufficient depth for a boat to enter, especially on the off side;
but a line of dangerous breakers in the bay will always prevent
an approach to it from the sea, except in the calmest weather,
whilst the bay itself will always be a hazardous place for any
vessels to enter under any circumstances. </p>

<p>Having, however, satisfactorily concluded our pursuit, we
retraced our steps to the camp, and again took the following
bearings as we left the beach, the strand trending E.S.E. 1/2
E.:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0">

<p>Before setting sail, a bottle was deposited between four and
five feet deep in a mound of soft earth and shells, close to the
spot on which the tent had stood, which contained <!--page 268 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page-->a paper of the
names of the party, together with a simple detail of our arrival
and departure. </p>

<p>It appeared that the good fortune, which had hitherto attended
us was still to continue, for the wind which had been contrary,
chopped round to the S.W., and ere sunset we were again in the
mouth of the river, having run from fifty to sixty miles under as
much canvass as the boat would bear, and with a heavy swell
during the greater part of the day. </p>

<p>The lake which has thus terminated our journey, is from fifty
to sixty miles in length, and from thirty to forty in width. With
such an expanse of water, I am correct in stating its medium
depth at four feet. There is a large bight in it to the S.E. and
a beautiful and extensive bay to the N.W. At about seven miles
from the mouth of the river, its waters are brackish, and at
twenty-one miles they are quite salt, whilst seals frequent the
lower parts. Considering this lake to be of sufficient
importance, and in anticipation that its shores will, during her
reign, if not at an earlier period, be peopled by some portion of
her subjects, I have called it, in well-meant loyalty,
&ldquo;The Lake Alexandrina.&rdquo; </p>

<p>It is remarkable that the Murray has few tributaries below the
Darling. It receives one, however, of considerable importance
from the S.E., to which I have given the name of the
&ldquo;Lindesay,&rdquo; as a mark of respect to my
commanding-officer, and in remembrance of the many acts of
kindness I have received at his hands. </p>

<p>Having dwelt particularly on the nature of the country through
which the expedition has passed in the pages of my journal, it
may be unnecessary for me to enter into any <!--page 269 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page-->description of it in
this place, further than to observe, that the limestone continued
down to the very coast, and that although the country in the
neighbourhood of the Lake Alexandrina must, from local
circumstances, be rich in point of soil, the timber upon it is of
stunted size, and that it appears to have suffered from drought,
though not to the same extent with the eastern coast. It is
evident, however, that its vicinity to high lands does not
altogether exempt it from such periodical visitations; still I
have no doubt that my observations upon it will convince His
Excellency the Governor, that it is well worthy of a closer, and
more attentive examination, than I had it in my power to make. </p>

<p>In a geographical point of view, I am happy to believe that
the result of this expedition has been conclusive; and that,
combined with the late one, it has thrown much light upon the
nature of the interior of the vast Island; that the decline of
waters, as far as the parallel of 139° E., is to the south, and
that the Darling is to the N.E. as the Murray is to the S.E.
angle of the coast, the main channel by which the waters of the
central ranges are thrown or discharged into one great reservoir.
</p>

<p>Our journey homewards was only remarkable for its labour: in
conclusion, therefore, it remains for me to add that we reached
the depot on the 23rd of March. </p>

<p>Our sugar failed us on the 18th of February, and our salt
provisions, in consequence of the accident which happened to the
skiff, on the 8th of March; so that from the above period we were
living on a reduced ration of flour; and as we took few fish, and
were generally unsuccessful with our guns, the men had seldom
more than their bread to eat. <!--page 270 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page--> </p>

<p>I regretted to observe that they were daily falling off, and
that although unremitting in their exertions they were well nigh
exhausted, ere we reached the Morumbidgee. </p>

<p>We were from sunrise to five o'clock on the water, and from
the day that we left the depot to that of our return we never
rested upon our oars. We were thirty-nine days gaining the depot
from the coast, against a strong current in both rivers, being
seven more than it took us to go down. From the depot to this
station we had seventeen days hard pulling, making a total of
eighty-eight, during which time we could not have travelled over
less than 2000 miles. I was under the necessity of stopping short
on the 10th instant, and of detaching two men for the drays,
which happily arrived on the 17th, on which day our stock of
flour failed us. Had I not adopted this plan, the men would have
become too weak to have pulled up to Pondebadgery, and we should
no doubt have suffered some privations. </p>

<p>This detail will, I am sure, speak more in favour of the men
composing the party than anything I can say. I would most
respectfully recommend them all to His Excellency's notice; and I
beg to assure him that, during the whole of this arduous journey,
they were cheerful, zealous, and obedient. They had many
harassing duties to perform, and their patience and temper were
often put to severe trials by the natives, of whom we could not
have seen fewer than 4000 on the Murray alone. </p>

<p>I am to refer His Excellency the Governor to Mr. M'Leay for
any more immediate information he may require,&mdash;to whom I
stand indebted on many points&mdash;and not less in the
anxiety he evinced for the success of the <!--page 271 APPENDIX.&mdash;No. II. /page-->undertaking, than in
the promptitude with which he assisted in the labours attendant
on our return, and his uniform kindness to the men. </p>

<p class="right">I have the honour to subscribe myself, <br>
Sir, <br>
Your most obedient humble Servant, <br>
CHARLES STURT, <br>
Captain of the 39th Regt. </p>

<p><i>The Hon. the Colonial Secretary.</i></p>
