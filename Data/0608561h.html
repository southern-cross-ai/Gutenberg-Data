  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE new-laid harvest straw beneath the faded red carpet
  rustled crisply under Martha's shapeless felt slippers as she padded across
  the living-room to the cluttered mantel.</p>

  <p>With the quizzical grimace of long-neglected astigmatism she adjusted the
  steel-bowed spectacles that had been her mother's, had of a notion peddler
  for two dozen eggs and a pound of butter.</p>

  <p>The wooden-wheeled clock&mdash;a noisy but amazingly accurate and
  exquisitely ornamented product of old Ferd's, while laid up one winter with a
  broken leg that had kept him two months sober&mdash;clacked irascibly at
  Martha that another blistering August morning was nearly five hours old. High
  time, indeed, that the day's work began. Not much wonder the Millers were
  poor.</p>

  <p>Dragging her slipper-heels to the door of the spare bedroom which, in
  spite of her continued protests, Susan and Greta had insisted on occupying of
  late, Martha vigorously rattled the latch.</p>

  <p>Glumly appeased by assurances from within, she returned to the dingy
  kitchen and peered into the kettle to see if there was enough water to prime
  the parching pump under the pear tree.</p>

  <p>Then, kettle in hand, she plodded to the foot of the narrow stairs, and
  petulantly called:</p>

  <p>"Julia!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Outstretched on velvet moss so soft and deep it yielded to
  every curve of her supple young body, Julia knew that if she stirred, the
  least bit, she would never be able to recapture the complete satisfaction of
  this luxurious languor.</p>

  <p>Doubtless it was too much to expect that an experience so strangely sweet
  could be quite real. Sooner or later, something or somebody would invade her
  peace. A tall giraffe would saunter up and thrust his long nose into the top
  of the banana tree. Giraffes ate bananas, didn't they?... Or a big man with a
  blue coat and shiny buttons would order her off.... Or there would be a
  peremptory summons from afar to come at once!</p>

  <p>Julia's unbuckled consciousness was already troubled by the persistent
  echo of a distant call. It had seemed to come from the depths of this
  tropical forest&mdash;a faint but urgent cry for help. The voice had sounded
  tired, plaintive, persecuted&mdash;just like Martha's.</p>

  <p>But what would Martha be doing away out here in... in Tasmania? Julia now
  readily identified her location by recalling a picture in <i>The Pictorial
  Atlas,</i> her omnivorous memory obliging her with phrases from the adjacent
  descriptive text: "Mountains heavily forested... magnificent scenery... peaks
  of crystalline rock showing pink and blue... frequent showers... luxuriant
  vegetation." If this wasn't Tasmania, it was someplace else too far off for
  Martha to find. Martha never went anywhere, not even to Ligonier on
  Saturdays. She always saw them off, standing there under the big maple,
  mopping her tanned forehead with the corner of her brown apron.</p>

  <p>"Wish you was a-goin' along, Mat," Hiram would drawl, conscious that he
  only, by virtue of his clumsy championship of her dour eccentricities, could
  nickname her without rebuke.</p>

  <p>"No," Martha would reply, sacrificially, "somebody's got to stay on th'
  place&mdash;what with them young turkeys and all."</p>

  <p>Whoever was calling, Julia had an uneasy sense of guilt over her failure
  to respond. Whether required to go or not, she at least should have the
  courtesy to answer. Of course, if it did actually turn out to be
  Martha&mdash;a most improbable event&mdash;she would have to obey. One always
  came when Martha called. Sometimes one came scowling and grumbling, but one
  always came.</p>

  <p>Martha had an uncanny instinct for knowing when one must on no account be
  disturbed. Had one reached the most exciting episode in a story, Martha
  needed a few dry chips immediately to revive an expiring fire. Let the sunset
  be at that phase where vermilion was beginning to be laced with purple,
  Martha's accusing voice inquired from the kitchen door whether one expected
  to gather the eggs, or must she go out later and do it herself in the dark
  and all?... But this couldn't be Martha!</p>

  <p>In just a moment, now, Julia would reply to the entreaty. She would draw a
  deep breath&mdash;though deep breaths were rather disconcerting, lately, for
  they seemed to make her plump round breasts so much more mature than she was,
  herself&mdash;and try to exhale "Coming!" so effortlessly as not to disturb
  this delightful lethargy. She would wait until the cry sounded a little more
  distinctly, and then she would answer, "Yes, Martha... Coming!"</p>

  <p>Evidently someone else had gone to the rescue, for everything was
  blissfully quiet again. That was good. So nice not to be bothered. Julia
  sighed contentedly as a big drop of warm dew dripped from the tip of a
  sheltering fern-frond and rolled slowly down her cheek.</p>

  <p>She opened one eye cautiously&mdash;a mere tiny slit&mdash;to make sure
  the tall, slim, slanting date-palm was still there. It was; plainly visible
  through the vertical bars of her long black lashes.</p>

  <p>Was this the one in the <i>Elementary Geography</i> or the <i>Child's
  Natural History?</i> No&mdash;it couldn't be; for the date-palm in the
  Geography had a grey monkey in the top, and the one in the Natural History
  was being climbed by a brown boy with arms as long as his legs, and sharp
  heels, scampering up out of the tiresome paragraph that read: "The Malay is
  of pigmy stature, averaging 148-149 cm., with black skin and short woolly
  hair."... No&mdash;this date-palm must be the one in the magic-lantern
  lecture, last winter, over at Hinebaugh's Schoolhouse.</p>

  <p>As for the dripping rubber trees, with the waxy leaves that shaded her
  like hands folded above her eyes, Julia could locate them certainly. They
  were from the little conservatory at Fort Wayne... out in Spring Fountain
  Park... the day she didn't go to the show. And here they were in this immense
  conservatory&mdash;for this really was a conservatory. Julia smiled over her
  silly mistake. She had fancied herself out in the open... in Tasmania, maybe;
  and all the time she had been lying here on the moss in this conservatory,
  exactly like the one in Spring Fountain Park&mdash;only twenty times
  bigger!</p>

  <p>But there was no mistaking those moist rubber trees. She had sat under
  them for a whole hour on a sticky green iron bench, that day last summer,
  when their family&mdash;all but Martha, what with the plums and all&mdash;had
  gone to Barnum and Bailey's circus; only she hadn't seen the show. She had
  indignantly left them standing there giggling foolishly on the crowded
  courthouse steps, craning their necks to follow the last of the little
  elephants at the tail of the pompous parade&mdash;the little elephants whose
  bulbous, bobbing, nodding heads seemed to be saying, "Yes, yes&mdash;we're
  coming."... (Yes, Martha... Coming!)</p>

  <p>Hiram and Elmer had been so noisy and silly, and had attracted so much
  unpleasant comment, that she had suddenly rebelled against the further
  humiliation of going out to the show-grounds with them.</p>

  <p>"Aw&mdash;come on!" Elmer had shouted, against the deafening shrieks of
  the steam calliope. "Don't be a sissy!"</p>

  <p>"S'matter with yuh?" growled Hiram. "'Shamed o' yer folks?"</p>

  <p>Greta was laughing uproariously over Susan's comment, "Wouldn't it kill
  yuh, Gret?... Father a-scoldin' the boys fer drinkin' so much, and him just
  able to stand up."</p>

  <p>Julia had been very sorry for her father that day, swaying unsteadily in
  the broiling sun as he morosely watched the clanking, jingling, garish,
  pungent parade&mdash;his tanned face screwed up into tight little wrinkles,
  his shaggy grey hair curled in tight little ringlets on his temples, his blue
  eyes, deep-set, swimming with vertigo. She couldn't bear to see him
  ridiculed. He belonged to her.</p>

  <p>"Please, Greta!"</p>

  <p>Greta had grinned, and cracked her chewing-gum.</p>

  <p>Julia had been strongly impulsed to slip her arm through her father's, and
  make off with him; to offer him a hand exactly like his, only smaller and not
  so brown; to smile into his eyes with eyes exactly like them, only younger
  and not so weary; to take him along with her&mdash;anywhere to be away from
  these unfeeling people who were not related to either of them except by the
  mere unfortunate accident that they all happened to belong to the same
  family. At that very moment, however, he had turned on her reproachfully,
  stifled a hiccough that hinted at impending nausea, and muttered, "You'd
  better let yourself go and have some fun once."</p>

  <p>"Fun?"</p>

  <p>"Yes: their kind o' fun. It won't do you no good to be haughty. You might
  as well cave in&mdash;an' like it! I done it! So kin you! I even larnt to
  talk like 'em. If you don't want to be lonesome all yer life, you'd
  better&mdash;"</p>

  <p>That quite settled it!... Promising to meet them at the Pennsylvania
  Station at seven-fifteen (they had left old Florrie and the dilapidated
  surrey at Larwill and had come the rest of the way by rail), Julia had
  slipped through the sweaty crowd, her cheeks aflame.</p>

  <p>Three blocks away she took the street-car&mdash;No. 52, a policeman had
  told her&mdash;an almost empty little green street-car that banged its bell
  furiously at the now demobilizing throng, demanding it to drag its roly-poly,
  waddling wife and gawky children and their yellow balloons and pink popcorn
  balls off the rails; had ground dizzily around sharp corners, and lost its
  few passengers&mdash;all but Julia&mdash;finally reaching almost open
  country, where it took the bit between its teeth, tucked its chin against its
  neck, and galloped over a rusty, hummocky track, the trolley-wheel singing a
  painfully shrill note, until it brought up with a jerk at the shabby
  station-shed in Spring Fountain Park.</p>

  <p>The grass was seared and badly trampled, and the dahlias were dusty and
  frowsy in their prim round beds. A black-lettered board pointed an
  index-finger toward "The Conservatory."</p>

  <p>Julia had had the steamy, sweaty, stuffy, little greenhouse all to
  herself, that afternoon. Everybody else had gone to the circus. She had sat
  there on the sticky iron bench, hoping it wouldn't come off on her new pink
  gingham, dreamily transporting herself to the equatorial regions where all
  this rank, lush, stifled vegetation belonged, finding a strange kinship with
  it. She sympathized with these cramped, dwarfed, imprisoned rubber trees, and
  the gigantic ferns with dejected, drooping arms and wings.</p>

  <p>And now, to Julia's annoyance, the cry for help was repeated. It came from
  just outside the conservatory door, this time. Would she, or would she not,
  come immediately?</p>

  <p>The huge dome of the conservatory lifted and disappeared. It was exactly
  like the glass cover that protected the plate of soggy doughnuts from the
  flies on the high counter in Ruggles's Restaurant and Pool Hall at
  Cromwell.... Martha had taken the conservatory by the handle, and lifted it
  off. One could hear what she was saying now, ever so distinctly. Would she
  come, this instant, and help get breakfast for Susan and Greta, who, as she
  very well knew, had promised to be ready at half-past five to go with the
  other huckleberry-pickers to Wadham's marsh? And wasn't it little enough for
  her to do, seeing she had begged off from the berryin' to study her algebry,
  or whatever it was, so she would be prepared for that there County Institute,
  week after next, which everybody knew she hadn't any right to waste their
  money on&mdash;even if it was her'n, a-teachin' silly paintin' lessons to
  women as ought to been a-keepin' their children's buttons on&mdash;what with
  them so hard-up and all? And didn't she have any natural feelin's
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Martha. I'm <i>coming!"</i></p>

  <p>Julia sat up, drenched with perspiration, stretched, inhaled an
  unsatisfactory draught of sultry, humid air, and gazed out through the east
  window at a chrome yellow sun that already threatened to break an August
  record. Next Thursday's <i>Ligonier Weekly Banner</i> would probably say, in
  big black headlines, "HOTTEST DAY FOR TEN YEARS!... Highest Temperature Since
  1885 Recorded on August the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>August the whath?... August the tenth? Her birthday! Would anyone else
  remember?</p>

  <p>She reached out a long, slender hand for her stockings, dangling over the
  back of a chair, and tugged them on. After all, shouldn't she be glad she had
  a good excuse not to go into Wadham's snake-infested huckleberry marsh and
  have her arms and legs scratched with briars and nettles while she fought
  deer-flies with an exasperation close to tears, and shuddered with loathing
  at the sight of enormous caterpillars, and wiped the slimy cobwebs out of her
  eyes with sun-blistered, juice-smeared wrists?... Blessings on the pesky
  algebra!</p>

  <p>"J-u-l-i-a!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Martha. I'm coming!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Her entrance into the grim little dining-room was effected
  with much difficulty. She could have wished that her first appearance before
  her household, as an adult in good and regular standing, might have been
  somewhat more impressive.</p>

  <p>Circumstances had decreed that Julia must bump her way crabwise through
  the obstinate swinging-door from the smoky kitchen with a precariously poised
  platter of bacon in one hand and the big battered coffee-pot in the other,
  while the family, glancing up from its first round of fried mush and sorghum
  molasses&mdash;with which munitions Martha had preceded her&mdash;wondered,
  not without warrantable anxiety, whether she would make port with all her
  cargo.</p>

  <p>It was not to be expected that her lazy and surly brothers, much less
  absent-minded old Ferd&mdash;whose fork trembled in a long, slim hand that
  had been obviously intended for more esteemed employment than shingling barns
  and blowing stumps&mdash;would spring to her rescue. That would have been
  "a-puttin' on style," an affectation held in snarling contempt by Hiram and
  Elmer. Indeed, their sentiment on this subject was commonly shared by the
  entire male species, so far as she had been able to observe.</p>

  <p>As for Greta, who, at twenty-two, had already well developed an impish
  talent for the enjoyment of other people's discomfiture; and as for Susan,
  whose twenty-seven virginal years and one hundred and sixty-seven pounds gave
  such alarming promise of unarrestable progress in both dimensions that she
  was frankly envious of her willowy young sister, Julia's predicament was
  clearly no concern of theirs.</p>

  <p>Martha, seated with her angular back to the door, which now capitulated
  with a savage swish and a sullen bang, cleared a place at her elbow for the
  brown-stained coffee-pot, and dutifully remarked that this was Julia's
  eighteenth birthday.</p>

  <p>While still in her teens, Martha had accidentally lost an upper canine.
  Morbidly self-conscious, her misfortune had worried her grievously; but there
  had been no necessity for replacing the missing tooth. By skilful practice,
  Martha had been able to conceal this disfigurement with the corner of her
  lip, a technique which had produced a meticulousness of articulation oddly
  inconsistent with the slovenly elisions and shockingly bad syntax demanded by
  her righteous passion to avoid "a-puttin' on airs."</p>

  <p>"Yes; your little sister," reiterated Martha, her choice of a pronoun
  indicating the maternal relationship she sustained to the family, "is came of
  age."</p>

  <p>Brief, bucolic felicitations from the boys were mumbled through the mush,
  to which old Ferd&mdash;so stung with remorse over having no gift for her
  that he did not even raise his eyes&mdash;added solemnly that Martha could
  always be depended on to remember the days.</p>

  <p>Depositing her awkward burdens, Julia stiffened to a martial stance,
  brought her full red lips to a determined pucker, tossed her curly head
  airily, and swept the breakfast-table with a look of pretended challenge, as
  if to say that she was quite grown up now and they must all have a care how
  they treated her.</p>

  <p>A moment later she was repentantly reflecting that previous experiences
  might have warned her against indulging in this bit of playful pantomime.
  Julia's sporadic efforts to dramatize some situation for the amusement of her
  family had been uniformly unsuccessful. It would have been very pleasant, she
  often thought, to belong to a household quick to interpret and enjoy a little
  good-natured clowning. It was not that their stodginess and lack of sparkle
  evoked her contempt: she was too naïve to be contemptuous. Indeed, she had
  never known&mdash;except in <i>Little Women,</i> long since read to rags and
  learned by heart&mdash;any such family as the rollicking, bantering,
  make-believe crew that constituted her ideal home.</p>

  <p>On one's birthday, however, it might reasonably be hoped that the family
  would waive its habitual taciturnity, and humour a whim; so, quite recklessly
  overplaying her premeditated skit, Julia glared at her brothers and sisters
  with a mock severity signifying her newly acquired dignity. But they had
  already returned to their bacon and mush; and, noting that no one of
  them&mdash;not even her father&mdash;showed signs of sharing her mood, she
  doffed her archness, rubbed a damp wisp of blue-black hair from her low
  forehead with the back of a shapely wrist&mdash;astonishingly like old
  Ferd's, only daintier&mdash;and slipped into her accustomed place on the end
  of the pine bench beside Susan.</p>

  <p>"Reckon you'll be too cocky to live with, now yer old enough t' be yer own
  boss," observed Hiram, who, on second thought, had decided not to leave Julia
  under the impression that he, at least, was too thick-witted to have taken
  note of her brief charade.</p>

  <p>Equally unwilling to be considered incapable of clever deduction, Greta
  remarked to her plate that Julia would probably be leaving home, one of these
  days, to go on the stage.</p>

  <p>Old Ferd hitched about in his chair, and for a moment Julia thought he was
  going to offer a comment.</p>

  <p>"Julia's always been a-playin' she was somethin' else besides what she
  is," said Susan.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;she ain't harmed no one by a-doin' that," growled Ferd. "She
  come by it honestly enough. When I was her age, or thereabouts&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"More coffee, paw?" inquired Martha, loudly, as if he were deaf.</p>

  <p>"It's sure a-goin' to be a scorcher, Gret," observed Susan,&mdash;fanning
  her goitre with the bib of her apron, and peering through the open doorway
  toward the road.</p>

  <p>"There goes old Len Bausermann with his pick 'n' shovel," reported Elmer,
  following his plump sister's eyes to the highway.</p>

  <p>"He'll be a-diggin' Granny Hartsock's grave today," explained Hiram,
  without turning to look.</p>

  <p>"A saint," murmured Martha, unctuously, "if they ever was one."</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;Len?" chaffed Elmer. "That consarned old chicken-thief?"</p>

  <p>Susan and Greta laughed immoderately. Martha, easily offended when her
  piety was ridiculed, drew down the corners of her mouth, and pouted. Elmer
  explored a defective wisdom-tooth with a pointed quill, and grinned.</p>

  <p>Old Ferd knew they didn't care to hear his story&mdash;none of them but
  Julia. He could always be sure of an attentive listener in Julia, though
  sometimes she asked too many questions.</p>

  <p>The family's rude indifference occasioned him no surprise. He had been on
  the defensive for so long in a home to which he contributed almost nothing,
  his small earnings claimed by Jake Heffel, that he had no right to be
  indignant over such discourtesies. He poured the thin coffee into his saucer
  with a shaky hand, crumbled bread into it, and sprinkled the dish with brown
  sugar, intent upon his occupation. Julia, toying absently with her food,
  studied his deep-lined, mobile face, confident that she was following his
  reminiscences as closely as if he had been given encouragement to recite
  them.</p>

  <p>He was, she knew, skipping hurriedly over the Dresden part of it; the part
  that most interested her; the part that really mattered. She had never been
  able to construct a very clear picture of his boyhood home. The blurry
  impression she had of it was an accumulated synthesis of chance remarks
  accidentally dropped, and laconic answers to her importunate queries in the
  rare moments when he seemed willing to talk about his youth.</p>

  <p>He would be out in his tiny shop under the big maple, standing at his
  home-made lathe, turning wooden pins for the mending of Squire Craig's
  harrow-teeth. The fine hickory shavings would come writhing and screaming
  from the point of his blue-hot chisel. He would pretend not to notice her,
  sitting on the old tool-chest, intently watching him.</p>

  <p>"Let me treadle it, father. I like to."</p>

  <p>The huge oak balance-wheel overhead would lumber to a creaking stop.</p>

  <p>"Mind you don't get yer foot caught under it, now!"</p>

  <p>Julia would snuggle it between his arms and stand so close, her back to
  his breast, pumping the broad pedal that made the patched belt go snapping
  and crackling on the great wooden fly-wheel, threatening to bring it down on
  their heads; her father's warm, hairy forearm, tense on the chisel, moist
  with sweat and powdered with fine sawdust, brushing her cheek, almost as if
  he caressed her.</p>

  <p>Panting with exertion, she would look up over her shoulder, and smile,
  when he signalled her to stop.</p>

  <p>"You're more like her every day, Julia!" he would murmur, as the machinery
  idled to a standstill.</p>

  <p>"Because my hair dips down to a point here in the middle?"</p>

  <p>"That&mdash;and the deep dimple in your chin."</p>

  <p>"And she had the same kind of eyes that we have."</p>

  <p>"Exactly; that's where we got 'em."</p>

  <p>"The others don't have them, father.... Funny&mdash;isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Thus drawn together in these brief intimacies, there would be some talk
  about her Grandmother Mueller&mdash;Ferd had changed his name to Miller, when
  coming to Indiana, because the people invariably mispronounced it; or was
  that the exact reason, Julia often wondered, when she had grown
  up&mdash;Grandmother Mueller who always seemed to be a mere slip of a girl,
  stooping over the flower-beds in the garden that was so&mdash;</p>

  <p>"How big was it, father&mdash;honestly: big as our potato-patch?"</p>

  <p>He would chuckle derisively.</p>

  <p>"Our potato-patch! Huh! Six&mdash;eight&mdash;ten times as big!"</p>

  <p>Then there would be some vigorous prodding of memory for more information
  about the house. It was a great, rambling, stone house with tall, broad
  chimneys and many gables. Yes&mdash;his own room had a gable, and there was a
  window-seat with a rose-coloured velvet cushion. Wrens nested in a little box
  under the eaves, and when it stormed, the branch of an elm swept the
  diamond-shaped panes of the mullioned window.</p>

  <p>"And was there honestly a fountain in the middle of a big pool,
  father?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and lily-pads."</p>

  <p>"And really goldfish, like you said?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, daughter&mdash;but don't you think you'd better go and help Martha
  now?"</p>

  <p>"And you would feed them in the mornings&mdash;and they always knew when
  you were coming, and swam close to the edge to meet you?"</p>

  <p>Of late Julia was becoming painfully aware of their lost heritage. Her
  day-dreams were bounded by the high stone wall, made warm and friendly by the
  tall hollyhocks his mother loved. On summer afternoons she fancied herself
  sitting in the rose-arbour, hard-by the large, half-timbered workshop and
  studio where distinguished guests were so often entertained to tea.</p>

  <p>"Tea!&mdash;in a shop!" she had exclaimed, the first time he had told her
  about it.</p>

  <p>"But it wasn't a little shop like this here, Julia. Seems to me like it
  had five or six big rooms. I disremember, exactly. The people came to see the
  carvings; almost every afternoon, somebody. And there would be exhibitions,
  couple o' times a year. Lots o' people came then, from long distances, Paris
  and London."</p>

  <p>"Would they talk to you, father?"</p>

  <p>"I was just a young feller."</p>

  <p>"Going to school?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I had a tutor.... But I was always a-hangin' around the shop,
  and I can't remember when I wasn't a-playin' with chisels, and a-makin'
  things.... Once I heard a Count&mdash;I disremember his name&mdash;a-tellin'
  somebody that <i>Mueller</i> on a rood screen made it worth more 'n' its
  weight in gold."</p>

  <p>And there was a river.</p>

  <p>Julia felt almost certain, as she sat watching her father's slow motions
  with his spoon, oblivious of the dull prattle of his family's table-talk,
  that he was dreaming of that river. You went through a thick oaken door set
  in the garden wall. The door had heavy wrought-iron hinges, and was always
  locked o' nights with a key that must have weighed all of a pound. You went
  through the door, and there was the river. The banks were rounded and grassy,
  and a long row of tall poplars grew on our side, "their leaves always
  a-flutterin' whether there was any wind or not." He disremembered the name of
  the river, but "one of the swans was called 'William Tell.'" There were
  boats, too; a couple o' canoes and a dory and a punt with a red and blue
  canopy&mdash;</p>

  <p>"How much did Lafe Shock git fer his gol-danged shoats?" Elmer was
  inquiring of Hiram.</p>

  <p>"Four cents, I heared," rumbled Hiram, puffing at his sputtering pipe.
  "'Bout enough to pay fer th' corn he'd chucked into 'em."</p>

  <p>"Corn&mdash;hell!" scoffed Elmer. "Them shoats never seen a grain o' corn.
  All they ever et was swill!"</p>

  <p>"Lot o' good the Shock swill woulda done' em," sneered Greta.</p>

  <p>"They was so gol-danged poor," expatiated Elmer, "that I bet Lafe had to
  soak 'em afore they'd hold slop."</p>

  <p>&mdash;and a punt with a red and blue canopy; and, sometimes, in the
  evening, his mother sat in the punt, with her guitar, and sang ballads to
  him, very sweetly. No&mdash;his father never joined them. No&mdash;he
  disremembered what the songs were.</p>

  <p>Now Julia was at sea with her father, standing beside him as he stoked his
  way, with blistered hands, on a slow boat; she was landing with him,
  bewilderedly, at Castle Garden. Much had happened since the swans and the
  ballads in the evening; but it was quite impossible to recover intervening
  events. His father had whipped him savagely when he was sixteen. He wouldn't
  tell her why; but it had something to do with his mother. She had cried
  desperately, and that night he ran away. The tutor had helped him get away.
  The tutor had gone away, too, that same night.</p>

  <p>Judging by the confident tightening of his lips, Julia knew he was in New
  York now, apprenticed to Lamb's Studios. Four years of that passed in a few
  seconds. Now he was hard at work on the big walnut eagle&mdash;his first
  important assignment&mdash;that was to be poised on a lectern for Saint
  John's in Philadelphia. Lamb's had taken him in on the strength of the
  Mueller tradition, and had given him every possible encouragement,
  undisguisedly rejoicing in his budding talent. Every day he was improving his
  skill; every night he was poring over his new books, determined to perfect
  his English.</p>

  <p>Then came the war. Julia saw the clouds gathering on the seamed old face.
  It was all over now. He had gone back to Lamb's in a faded uniform topped by
  the absurd little cap with the stiff visor that he still wore, rather
  rakishly, on Decoration Day&mdash;a day Julia dreaded, for he always marched
  unsteadily, and joked a good deal, when he should have been silent and
  dignified.</p>

  <p>Now he had returned to the Lamb Studios, stubbly, fuddled, and pungent,
  after a fortnight's spree. All was forgiven. Soldiers would be soldiers.
  Lamb's were disappointed, but hopeful. Why, Mr. Joseph Lamb,
  himself!&mdash;(Ferd had been too proud of that recognition to keep it a
  secret, even if its implications were not to his own credit)&mdash;Mr. Joseph
  Lamb, himself, had pleaded with him to straighten up, and be a man. Surely,
  nobody could have asked for a better friend, Ferd often remarked, than "Mr.
  Joseph," who, it was said, had given up his plans to enter the ministry
  because he thought he could do more for religion by adding something to its
  beauty. "Mr. Joseph Lamb was a great artist!" Ferd would say. "Yes
  <i>sir!</i>"</p>

  <p>No&mdash;it wasn't the fault of Lamb's Studios if he had drunk himself
  practically into the gutter at a time when a returned soldier's dissipation
  was easily pardoned, but not so easily capitalized in a profession demanding
  the utmost steadiness of eye and hand. Ferd was so proud of his erstwhile
  craftsmanship and its stern exactions that he was willing to admit his own
  inability to meet its requirements, shamelessly confessing the cause of his
  failure, as if his very drunkenness, at twenty-four, was to be talked about
  in tones of respect, seeing it had been important enough to collide
  successfully with an esteemed art.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;that chapter was finished, then, and her father had ceased being
  an artist. Julia recognized the exact moment when he "took to the road" en
  route to Pennsylvania in quest of a distant cousin who owned "a bit of a
  truck-farm." Oddly enough, no exigency of poverty had ever induced him to
  part with the books he had bought in the golden days when he was so
  brilliantly succeeding at Lamb's. He had stored them in New York; had kept
  himself sober long enough to save the money required for their transportation
  to his new home; for, now, he had a home. He had married the plump, shy,
  awkward, yellow-haired daughter of an improvident neighbour who indifferently
  operated a small sawmill, "mortgaged, by Golly, down to the last cleat in the
  old pulley-belt."</p>

  <p>Julia knew how it always amused him to repeat that phrase. He smiled, now,
  and glanced up furtively to make sure the family's attention was occupied.
  She dodged his eyes and took no further risks with them until she was sure he
  was in "pardnership" with his unthrifty father-in-law, who, hearing rumours
  of advantages to be had by moving to Northern Indiana, "where everybody was
  a-makin' big money loggin' and gettin' out railroad ties," had suggested the
  immediate migration of his populous, penniless tribe.</p>

  <p>Ferd grinned again, rather wryly. Julia was not quite sure where we were
  in the story, now. Perhaps he was thinking about something he had never told
  her&mdash;something not very pleasant, perhaps; something not much to our
  credit, she feared.</p>

  <p>He had taken along to Indiana their simple, mostly homemade, household
  gear, the precious books&mdash;English classics&mdash;which were to become a
  veritable Godsend to Julia!&mdash;and his only military trophy, his little
  brown jug. Occasionally, of a late Saturday night in Heffel's Saloon in
  Cromwell, when Ferd and his cronies had passed from the bragging stage to the
  distinctly maudlin, nose-trumpeting phase of bland confessions and remorses
  over their respective might-have-beens, he would pull himself together long
  enough to make a pathetic joke of his own disaster.</p>

  <p>"Yep"&mdash;Ferd would say, grinning drunkenly through his
  tears&mdash;"that was my only military trophy&mdash;that there little brown
  jug."</p>

  <p>He glanced up now, out of the tail of his eye, and found Julia regarding
  him with rapt interest. A bit disconcerted by this intense scrutiny
  (sometimes Julia's penetrating knowledge of his moods and meditations annoyed
  him, just a little), he pushed back his chair, and muttered, partly to
  himself, partly to her:</p>

  <p>"Yep&mdash;that's the way it goes."</p>

  <p>He gnawed off a large bite of Horseshoe chewing-tobacco from the plug he
  had rummaged from the depth of his overall-pocket, and, without a backward
  glance, strolled out through the doorway toward his shop.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he would continue his reminiscences while he worked on the Snell
  baby's pine coffin; but he had already covered everything in his story that
  had any interest for Julia. Except for such minor episodes as the births of
  his five children, and the death of Minnie, six years ago, his history was an
  unpunctuated monotony of trivial jobs&mdash;building corncribs, replacing
  timbers in the forebay at Austin's gristmill, planing and hanging Squire
  Craig's screen-doors every April, and stowing them in the loft of the
  woodhouse every November&mdash;a chronicle as sterile of novelty as the
  legendary minstrel's redundant report that now another locust came and
  carried away another grain of corn.</p>

  <p>Julia wondered, sometimes, whether her father ever missed her mother. It
  was obvious that he did not grieve for her. Minnie's biological contribution
  to Julia's character was no more in evidence than the influence of a hen on a
  golden pheasant's egg. Julia was all Ferd's.</p>

  <p>Minnie had been an ignorant, whining, colourless, unimaginative creature,
  her quite astounding bulk disproving the adage that stout people are
  invariably optimistic. Save for the fact that she had been an economical
  housekeeper (as she had plenty of reason to be), and was thought to put up
  the best green-tomato pickles in the Oak Grove neighbourhood, nothing
  important was remembered of her; not even by her own kin.</p>

  <p>A litter of empty, overturned, glass fruit-jars on her grave in the
  Baptist Cemetery which, on the anniversaries of her death, the melancholy
  Martha stuffed with garden flowers, ironically testified to Minnie's previous
  relation to other natural objects in a world where she had dully foozled a
  chance to present society with a rehabilitated wood-carver of exceptional
  virtuosity, and had contented herself with the excellence of her
  piccalilli.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A clatter of wheels and harness drew Greta to the door.</p>

  <p>"Fer Gosh sakes, Sue, if Bob ain't came with the hay-ladders on! Jolt the
  very stuffin' out of yuh!" She turned to the abstracted Julia. "You'd better
  come, too, Miss Stuck-up! Here's that Schrofe boy what's so crazy about
  yuh.... Hoo-hoo, Bob! We'll be out in a jiffy!"</p>

  <p>"Mebby you better go, Julia," advised Martha, maternally.</p>

  <p>Julia demurred. It was little enough time she had to review her algebra,
  even if she studied every minute.</p>

  <p>Old Ferd, returning for a tin of water to cool his grindstone, arrived in
  time to take a hand in the argument.</p>

  <p>"Give her a chance, Martha. I'd like to see one of us do somethin' to make
  our name a little more important than it's been."</p>

  <p>Martha picked up a double handful of dishes with a decisiveness of manner
  that promised an impressive exit, to be followed presently by a great clatter
  of pots and pans off stage.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;all I got t' say is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the threatened tantrum was played to a thinning house, Ferd had found
  his tin cup, and was off with it. Susan and Greta were on the way to the
  wagon. The boys slouched toward the barn. Julia carried her plate to the
  kitchen, where Martha was sniffing ostentatiously, and vanished with a
  promise to make the beds, her sister's plaintive whine trailing her all the
  way upstairs. "'Pears like nobody in this house cares what I think about
  anything. Just a hired girl... without any pay."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Standing before the severely plain but expertly crafted
  walnut desk that her father had given her, last Christmas, Julia unlocked a
  drawer and re-read the precious document it contained.</p>

  <p>The desk had become a symbol of the considerable difference between
  herself and her brothers and sisters. A source of anxiety and embarrassment
  at first, the desk had come to be a refuge and an inspiration.</p>

  <p>On Christmas morning, having presented each member of the family with a
  fine, large orange, Ferd had made a mysterious trip through the snow to his
  shop, returning shortly with the desk. Julia's exclamations of delight had
  intensified the sullen silence. At supper, that evening, Greta's smouldering
  indignation blazed forth in an irascible comment to which Ferd quietly
  replied:</p>

  <p>"She's the only one in this family that would have any use fer a desk. If
  any o' the rest o' yuh ever needs one, mebby I'll 'tend to it."</p>

  <p>This sarcastic explanation of the gift did little to conciliate them. So
  much constraint was traceable to the episode that Martha told Julia she had
  better take her new desk upstairs and keep it out of sight. Susan added that
  she, for one, would never darken the door of Julia's room while it was
  there.</p>

  <p>But, however painful the situation, at the outset, it developed for Julia
  a privacy she had never enjoyed before. By common consent, the family left
  her to herself, implying, a dozen times a day, that she considered the rest
  of them inferior, twisting her every remark into allusions to their
  ignorance.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do, father?" she inquired one day, in the shop. "They're
  always trying to act as if they're not as smart as I am."</p>

  <p>Ferd grinned, and blew the sawdust off his chisel-handle.</p>

  <p>"They don't have t' put on, very much, t' play that."</p>

  <p>"But it makes me so miserable!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;don't cry.... That's what yuh get fer a-bein' smart. Smart
  people's always miserable. Old man Solomon said that&mdash;er somethin' about
  like it."</p>

  <p>"Was he miserable?" asked Julia, with a tearful little smile.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, yes! He was the smartest man that ever lived!" Ferd sat down on the
  tool-chest, laid a dusty hand on her knee, and grinned mysteriously. "Julia,
  are yuh sure you've found all the drawers in that there little desk? One of
  'em ain't got no handle."</p>

  <p>Her eyes brightened.</p>

  <p>"No," she whispered, excitedly, "I haven't found it. Will you show
  me?"</p>

  <p>He had found it for her the next time the family was out of the
  house&mdash;a narrow drawer set in the centre of a row of six open
  pigeon-holes and faced by a little pilaster carved to imitate a longitudinal
  section of a Corinthian column.</p>

  <p>"That there's it," pointed Ferd, hugely enjoying Julia's flutter of
  excitement. "No&mdash;it don't come out that way," he said, when she had
  unsuccessfully grappled with the ornament which defied the best efforts of
  her finger-tips. "Nobody could ever get it out a-doin' that."</p>

  <p>"Do show me, father!"</p>

  <p>He had proceeded then in leisurely fashion, immensely relishing her
  suspense, to demonstrate the strange magic of the secret drawer.</p>

  <p>"Now, if you ever want to put anythin' out of sight, Julia," commented
  Ferd, with a comradely wink, "you'll know how to do it; and it'll take a heap
  o' tinkerin' with this here desk fer anybody else but you to find out how
  that drawer opens."</p>

  <p>Julia was ecstatic.</p>

  <p>Her close inspection of the desk had led to another discovery: Ferd had
  carved the name "Mueller" on the bevelled edge of the little receptacle for
  ink-bottles and pens.</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad you did that, father. That makes the desk still more
  valuable, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>Ferd flushed with pride.</p>

  <p>"It's the only time, Julia, since I cut the name under the wing of an
  eagle that holds the Bible in a big church in Philadelphia. It's the way my
  father cut his name&mdash;and his father&mdash;and his father's father....
  It's a good name, daughter."</p>

  <p>Standing now before the desk, Julia withdrew a document&mdash;much too
  long to fit into the secret drawer&mdash;bearing the impressive seal of the
  Great State of Indiana and signed with an affected flourish by the Noble
  County Superintendent of Public Instruction, authorizing her to teach an
  ungraded school for the term of One Year. Beside it, in the long envelope,
  was the covering letter containing a pressing suggestion that the recipient
  plan to attend a five-day Institute to be held in Albion, the county seat, in
  late August, chiefly for the benefit of inexperienced teachers.</p>

  <p>"Please, God," whispered Julia, wistfully but shyly, for they were not
  very well acquainted, "let me have a school!"</p>

  <p>Nobody in the Miller family exhibited any piety but Martha, who was
  presumed to have enough for all. Martha's conversation was sprinkled with
  scriptural allusions, her stock of texts featuring the punitive phrases
  promising the ultimate rebuke of the proud, the "froward" (whoever they
  were), and the stiff of neck. Julia, gifted in parody, occasionally employed
  these solemn exhortations herself, with <i>ex tempore</i> improvisations and
  amendments which amused her, and sometimes frightened her, too; for, she
  reflected, if there really was a hell, surely the fabricator of any such
  flippancies was reserving a warm berth.</p>

  <p>When Martha, in her thin, flat voice, carolled from the kitchen, "I'm
  washed in the blood of the Lamb," Julia invariably shuddered, swallowed hard,
  and muttered, "Ugh!&mdash;how nasty!"</p>

  <p>"Please let me have the Schrofe School," wheedled Julia, clutching her
  precious credentials tightly in one hand and with the other pressing her eyes
  hard to make sure they were closed firmly enough to satisfy the requirements
  of Deity, who was sure to be suspicious of her sincerity, "so I won't have to
  come home except on Sundays. But&mdash;any school will do. Please, dear God,
  let me hear from one of them pretty soon. It would be so nice to have word on
  my birthday. Please!"</p>

  <p>Somewhat startled by the inflection of this final word of entreaty, which
  hinted at an intimacy with the Almighty which, she was aware, impertinently
  presumed upon a very sketchy relationship, Julia added, humbly
  "&mdash;Unless, of course, it should not be in accordance with Thy Holy
  Will."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"What have yuh got yer Sunday hat 'n' dress on fer?"
  inquired Martha, when, a half-hour later, Julia passed through the kitchen,
  book and slate in hand, pausing to remark that she was going down by the
  creek where it was cooler.</p>

  <p>"I thought I might walk over to Oak Grove, when I am tired studying, and
  see if there is any mail&mdash;about a school, you know."</p>

  <p>"Mighty sight o' studyin' you'll get done with that on yer mind. Better to
  a-gone berryin', like I told yuh. Anyways, all the schools are a-took by now.
  'Pears to me like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for the rest of it, Julia walked out of the kitchen,
  quickened her steps immediately she was out of sight over the slope behind
  the barn, tossed her algebra and slate into the grass at the foot of the big
  willow that overhung the stream, climbed to the highway, and set out at a
  swinging stride toward the village two miles to the west&mdash;two miles by
  the road, but subject to considerable discount if one cut across Squire
  Craig's stubble-field, just beyond the Baptist Church, and took the path
  through the woods along the widening river, pent by the Austin milldam.</p>

  <p>There were two high fences and a padlocked gate to climb, and occasionally
  the Squire's ill-tempered ram contested the audacity of trespassers, but
  Julia was impatient to peer into the tiny pane of dirty glass&mdash;No.
  8&mdash;in the Post Office which occupied a few square feet in the front end
  of Baber's General Store.</p>

  <p>Halfway across the stubble-field, Julia's steps became shorter and less
  confident.</p>

  <p>Seated, with his back to her, on the top rail of the fence that bounded
  the woods, was a young stranger, fashionably dressed, his shoulders slumped
  as if he were lost in serious thought; in trouble, perhaps.</p>

  <p>Julia reflected that if he were to straighten himself out to full length
  he would be very tall.</p>

  <p>The stranger's perch must be quite uncomfortable. Julia surmised that he
  would not remain there long. If she dallied, he might proceed, unconscious of
  her approach. She stopped, toying with the idea of retracing her steps, but
  the sun beat pitilessly upon the dazzling yellow field, and the cool maples
  promised a relief irresistible. Her heart quickened as her pace slowed. She
  pulled off her dowdy hat, made of cheap lace over a wire frame, and patted
  the damp curls at her hot temples.</p>

  <p>Now the young stranger had turned, and, over his shoulder, was regarding
  her arrival with frank interest. He stepped down from the fence, on the grove
  side, consulted his watch, and smiled. It was almost as if he had been
  waiting for her, thought Julia; as if they had arranged to meet, and she was
  late. Had he decided to play, she wondered, that they were keeping an
  engagement? Could it be possible that there was anyone in the world like
  that? It would be such fun.</p>

  <p>Would he not think her a bit stupid if she stared stonily into his
  friendly eyes, pretending to be offended, pretending to be haughty? Was it
  not one's duty to be cordial to strangers? Even Martha, prude that she was,
  believed that one might be "entertaining angels unawares."</p>

  <p>Julia had never seen that sort of a smile on a boy's face. It signified
  nothing but a proffer of friendliness from one young human being to another.
  It left out of consideration the negligible fact that they were not of the
  same sex. How different from the awkward, crooked grin of the typical
  gum-chewing youngster who man&oelig;uvred to one's side at a boisterous
  barn-dance and paid one a clumsy compliment while turning to wink at some
  equally boorish bystander, as if to say, "I'm a-tryin' to see how fer I c'n
  git with her!"&mdash;as if their relationship implied that she was willing it
  should be rated an obscenity. She had often been half-ashamed she was a
  girl.</p>

  <p>Julia was within a few yards of the fence, now, making no pretence of
  indifference to the presence of the tall, athletic chap who awaited her,
  watch still in hand.</p>

  <p>His smile was so disarming that her red lips parted in an honest
  recognition of the first of its kind she had ever seen worn by a contemporary
  male. Her ingenuous response to it was quite free of self-consciousness or
  embarrassment. Toward this handsome, urbane, self-possessed boy&mdash;clearly
  not of her world at all, so far as outward appearances went&mdash;she sensed
  a strange kinship which, she believed, it would have been unworthy of her to
  deny either to herself or to him.</p>

  <p>It was what she had been longing for, all her life, wasn't it? Hadn't she
  dreamed of an acquaintance with some congenial spirit in whose company she
  might be... herself? Why dissemble? She owed something to that dream.</p>

  <p>"It's much cooler over here," he said, offering her both hands, when,
  having lightly climbed to the top of the fence, she sat facing him, fanning
  her flushed cheeks with her crumpled, frumpy hat.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Julia.</p>

  <p>She took his hands without hesitation or coyness, and joined him.</p>

  <p>"But we must keep an eye out for my Uncle Jasper's pet sheep, Otto the
  Seventh," he said, as they fell into step on the path. "Otto has a vile
  disposition, and the run of this grove."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Julia, "I know."</p>

  <p>He ventured a sidelong glance, as if to inquire whether his new friend had
  exhausted her conversational possibilities, and met an enigmatic smile.</p>

  <p>"Had I kept you waiting long?" she asked, with an earnestness that puzzled
  him.</p>

  <p>He turned about and faced her so soberly that Julia repented her whimsical
  audacity. Did nobody in the world know how to take a little joke? Was she the
  only one, after all, who had any instinct for impromptu drama? She took a
  step forward. He detained her with a light touch on her arm.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, rather huskily, "I have been waiting a long time... for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Don't spoil it," said Julia, entreatingly. "We were only playing, weren't
  we?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR the first time in the history of the Schrofe School it
  was being taught without benefit of whips and dunce-caps.</p>

  <p>The innovation caused some stir. Discipline had been much less savage in
  recent years under a succession of female teachers, but the present policy of
  complete disarmament was viewed with anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Fer the girl's own sake," agreed the younger mothers, whose support of
  her had been swiftly won by the affectionate interest bestowed on their
  little tots, "them bigger boys oughta be kept in hand. They'll run her out
  afore Thanksgivin'."</p>

  <p>Ham Ditzler, who had put in six exciting winters behind that desk, more
  than a decade earlier, and now divided his time between odd jobs of
  plasterin', paperin', paintin', an' butcherin', in the employ of his
  erstwhile pupils&mdash;("danged degradin' work")&mdash;offered to bet (amount
  of wager unspecified) that the Miller girl would never finish out her term, a
  prediction which came true, though not for lack of firmness in her
  schoolroom.</p>

  <p>Abner Schrofe, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, when joined in his barn
  by the four other members, one rainy Sunday forenoon in early October,
  silently shucked corn during their recital of the public's apprehension based
  on criticisms offered by the veteran pedagogue.</p>

  <p>Upon the conclusion of their remarks, Chairman Schrofe listed heavily to
  starboard and deftly poured a considerable quantity of tobacco-juice down a
  convenient rat-hole, thus setting himself at liberty to express the
  opinion&mdash;conciliatorily phrased in terms consonant with the dignity of
  his office&mdash;that Ham Ditzler was nothin' but a damned old sore-head.</p>

  <p>Encountering no opposition to this statement, not even from Zeke Trumbull,
  Ham's son-in-law, with whom he made his home, Abner further deposed that
  there was more brains in Julia Miller's little finger than Ham Ditzler had in
  his hull body, adding that he would respectfully entertain a motion a-sayin'
  it to be th' sense of this here board, duly and properly assembled, that Miss
  Miller's services was "sadisfactory."</p>

  <p>Hez Brumbaugh said he would so move, and suggested that the Chairman
  inform Miss Miller of their action.</p>

  <p>Jake Waters, who since last spring had owed Abner the final Eight Dollars
  on a Guernsey heifer, 'lowed that Ham Ditzler&mdash;after all's said and
  done, and a-takin' him by and large&mdash;was purty much of a gol-darned old
  blatherskike whose idears wasn't wuth hell-room.</p>

  <p>At Zeke's suggestion, this was taken by consent. He modestly demurred,
  however, when delegated to convey this sentiment to his father-in-law,
  feeling that it would have "more weight" coming from someone else. The
  decorum of the board being slightly disturbed by this remark, it grinningly
  adjourned to the hog-pen to inspect the new "Poland-Chiny" sow that Abner had
  purchased at the recent Whitley County Fair.</p>

  <p>"Please, Mr. Schrofe," pleaded Julia, next morning, after Abner,
  delightedly to have an official errand at the schoolhouse, had told her he
  was on his way to settle Mr. Ditzler's hash, "leave him to me. Don't hurt
  him. I'll think of some way to accomplish the same thing without humiliating
  him."</p>

  <p>Ham, already silenced by a hint from Zeke to the effect that if he knowed
  which side his bread was buttered on he would let up on the Miller girl,
  bewilderedly accepted her invitation to make a little talk to the school on
  the afternoon of Columbus Day, on which occasion he astounded himself and the
  assembled mothers by confessing the difficulty that an old-timer has in
  a-keepin' up with th' march o' progress.</p>

  <p>An able craftsman of home-made philosophy, Ham spent many meditative hours
  evolving what he thought was a brand-new theory for the achievement of this
  here thing they calls success, chattering so volubly about his discovery that
  it became a community joke.</p>

  <p>His convictions on this subject were never better expressed than on the
  late afternoon of an eventful day in May when, riding home from a service at
  the Oak Grove Baptist Church in company with Zeke and Lola and their
  swollen-eyed little daughter Goldie, Ham observed:</p>

  <p>"It all goes fer t' show that this here thing they calls success is the
  fruit of self-confydence.</p>

  <p>"If yuh know yer bigger 'n' yer job, and c'n drop the dang thing whenever
  yuh like and do somethin' better, the people yer a-workin' fer seems t' know
  it without yer a-tellin' 'em. They take orders as if they was a-spoke by
  Jehovah, so long as they know yuh know there's sumethin' in prospec' fer yuh
  a dang sight more important than a-foolin' away yer time with the likes o'
  them!</p>

  <p>"If a teacher, f'rinstance, thinks he's got about all that's a-comin' to
  him, and has to mind his <i>p</i>'s and <i>q</i>'s er the Board'll set on
  him, he just natcherly has t' whale hell outa the brats to make 'em
  behave.</p>

  <p>"If he c'n get along without rules er whips er threatenin's, it's because
  th' scholars knows that he don't have t' care a tinker's damn whether he
  keeps his job er not, seein' he c'n leave 'em, if they don't like it, and do
  somethin' better.... And I bet that's the secret o' success in all th' walks
  o' life, in ev'ry day an' generation."</p>

  <p>Ham leaned far out of the open surrey, where he shared the back seat with
  Goldie, and improved his impaired articulation by relieving himself of a
  large quid of tobacco, wiped his stubbly lips with the back of a brown hand,
  and continued:</p>

  <p>"You take this here parson, over in Wayne, what's been a-sayin' lately
  that th' story about Jonah ain't so, d'yuh reckon they'd let him stay there
  and be as honest as that if they didn't know the hull town knows as how he's
  had an invite to a big church in Chicago? Not by a dang sight! They just grin
  when he goes after the Old Testyment fer a-sayin' that th' Lord God drownded
  all them heathens fer spite... 'cause they know that if they holler he'll
  tell 'em t' take their danged ol' church b' th' bell-clapper, 'n' go t'
  hell!"</p>

  <p>"Sh!&mdash;Pap!" admonished Lola, without turning. "What kinda talk...
  right afore little Goldie, too!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I wisht I'd a-heared some talk like that when I was about her
  size," muttered Ham, remorsefully. "Mebby I'd amounted to somethin'."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," inquired Zeke, "why didn't this here smart preacher in Wayne
  take that there bigger job in Chi?"</p>

  <p>Ham was fidgety with eagerness to explain.</p>

  <p>"Now yer a-gettin' to it! That just goes fer t' show how smart this feller
  is! If he went to Chicago, where mebby he'd be exac'ly the size of his job,
  er mebby a little smaller, he wouldn't be able t' tell 'em where t' get off
  at. He likes a-bein' where he c'n tell 'em, if they object t' his preachin',
  that they c'n take their danged ol' church b' th' bell-clapper,
  'n'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pap&mdash;that'll do now!" snapped Lola, adding, growlingly, "Can't we
  never talk about nothin' else but things as riles Pap and makes him swear,
  right afore little Goldie?"</p>

  <p>"All the same," finished Ham, doggedly reverting to his original
  proposition, "if Julia Miller hadn't 'lowed, all th' time she was a-teachin',
  that she was a-goin' away purty soon t' be a rich man's wife, I bet she'd
  a-had t' larn them sassy young rake-hells all over th' schoolhouse, five
  times a day!"</p>

  <p>Little Goldie wept noisily.</p>

  <p>"Shet up, Pap!" commanded Lola. "Hain't yuh got no proper feelin's at
  all?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Sometimes, during those early autumn days, Julia's happiness
  almost suffocated her. As often, it terrified her. Was Martha's grim and
  hateful philosophy correct? Did people always have to pay the piper? Was this
  ecstasy the sort of thing you inevitably had to settle for with interest
  compounded?</p>

  <p>Sudden waves of black depression briefly but increasingly inundated her
  dream-world. Was she living in a fool's paradise? Would the clock presently
  strike twelve, and send the prancing horses scampering back to rejoin their
  fellow-mice? Nonsense! She must pull out of this! How silly! Was ever anyone
  more fortunate than she?</p>

  <p>She became very sensitive on the subject of her happiness, eager to keep
  her radiant spirits within bounds so that Fate would at least give her credit
  for all the humility and gratitude she would muster. Diligently occupied with
  the unaccustomed task of disciplining her emotions, sternly warning them to
  keep their distance from her eyes, her lips, her voice, her hands and feet,
  Julia was unaware of the outward effect of these suppressions.</p>

  <p>"Julia has growed up, almost overnight," muttered old Ferd.</p>

  <p>"Who'd a-thought that Julia Miller would age so fast?" remarked Mrs. Abner
  Schrofe. "She's a <i>woman!"</i></p>

  <p>The effect of Julia's self-discipline in the cause of propitiating Nemesis
  was an unconscious exhibition of that magnetic and covetable type of personal
  poise not to be had cheaper than at the price of a stoical imprisonment of
  kinetic energy bruising its fists against the bars and pleading for its right
  to shout and dance and sing.</p>

  <p>Eager to offer any forfeit to fend off the Day of Judgment, Julia had
  decided to room and board at home, involving a daily tramp of nearly six
  miles. It was a very real sacrifice, in anticipation; for, in looking forward
  to her new work, its most alluring promise had been the escape it offered
  from an irksome home environment.</p>

  <p>School had been in progress barely a week, however, before Julia began to
  doubt the efficacy of her splendid sacrifice. The atmosphere at home had
  improved. The boys were shaving now, every other day, in honour of the young
  school-mistress who appeared at their breakfast-table trimly clad for her
  day's work. Susan and Greta crimped their hair, starched their aprons, and
  conceded the boarder a right to the exclusive use of her own trinkets. Her
  father's gratitude for the money she had engaged to pay touched her. Martha's
  awkward tenderness and solicitude slightly embarrassed her. What a difference
  a little money made in the general line-up of human relations! Julia smiled,
  with new understanding, over the story that had gone the rounds about Widow
  Mercer, who lived near Bippus, ten miles east.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mercer, an enthusiastic Maccabee, had left her Two Thousand Dollars in
  fraternal insurance. There were four sons, all concerned that this large
  fortune should not be dissipated. They suggested that their mother divide the
  money among them, and spend her time living in their homes as an honoured
  guest.</p>

  <p>"No," she had replied, quietly. "'Pears to me like an elderly lady with
  Two Thousand Dollars would be a much more interestin' guest than an old woman
  with nothin'."</p>

  <p>It made all the difference in the world, money did!</p>

  <p>One day you were "Julia?... Julia!... <i>Julia!!</i> Come here, this
  instant, like I told yuh, and peel these potatoes!"</p>

  <p>One short week later you were "Julia, you just let Susan peel them
  potatoes, and you go set down till supper's ready."</p>

  <p>Nor was this refreshing change at home Julia's chief ground for
  satisfaction. She was grateful for the opportunity to be alone, two hours
  daily, with her enchanting memories and high expectations. The vigorous walk
  quickened her imagination. Fully a third of the trip to school was taken
  through tall timber on a picturesque wagon-road that negligently waived the
  right o' way to close-meshed clumps of flaming sumac, and an occasional
  obdurate oak&mdash;a narrow ribbon of a road, carpeted with freshly fallen
  leaves, frost-sensitized to autumnal rays filtered through the livelier half
  of the prism, and crisp under her nimble feet.</p>

  <p>On the return journey, Julia was always the school-teacher, it being part
  of her discipline to restrict her thoughts to her professional
  obligations.</p>

  <p>On the early morning trip, however, she was all Zandy's! Her capacity
  increased for the vivid recovery of her deliriously happy experiences with
  him. To the very minutia of detail, Julia reconstructed every tone, posture,
  and gesture associated with those dreamy, unreal afternoons under the shade
  of the river-willows behind the Baptist Cemetery, not more than a dozen yards
  from her mother's grave, and the few almost painfully rapturous hours that
  had transfigured dull and dusty little Albion into the City Delectable!</p>

  <p>The first half-mile of the out-bound trip, which brought her to the
  Baptist Church, where she turned to the left on the busy Larwill Pike, was
  invariably taken, at that early hour, without encountering any traffic,
  either on foot or wheel.</p>

  <p>Except for the shrill scream of some excited water-bird on the river, and
  the lonesome clangor of a cow-bell registering the impatience of horns
  entangled in a wild grapevine down in the glen, there would be no sound but
  the rhythmic crunch of frosty gravel under her competent heels.</p>

  <p>Julia's precious recollections proceeded in orderly sequence.
  Sometimes&mdash;let her do her utmost to concentrate on the opening chapter
  of the almost incredible story&mdash;her memory would insist on turning whole
  handfuls of pages; but, tugging herself free of the culminating episodes that
  mattered most, she would pursue events chronologically. She always wanted to
  be through with the early part of the story before she reached the busier
  mile of pike, for the full enjoyment of their first encounter demanded a few
  merry roulades of bantering laughter&mdash;her own: Zandy had been so
  serious. And, besides, she liked to be in the thick of the dark woods when
  she arrived at the Albion part of it!... Dear, dear Zandy! How tender! How
  precious!</p>

  <p>Julia's reminiscences always began at the fence where they had met on the
  morning of her birthday. Now they were ambling slowly through the grove. They
  had left the path, and were wandering toward the river. She was still en
  route to the Post Office, but they were off the path.</p>

  <p>"You have a first name, too?" (I have told him mine.)</p>

  <p>"Alexander."</p>

  <p>"Quite long and dignified." (I think I must not do that, any more. He
  doesn't like teasing. He is so serious.)</p>

  <p>"So was my grandfather. It was his name. Everyone calls me Zandy. My
  sister began it when she was a little tot, and I was a baby."</p>

  <p>"Do they call you Zandy at Dartmouth, too?"</p>

  <p>"Mmm." (Zandy says "Mmm" when he means yes; not "Umm-humm," the way our
  people do. Martha thinks it queer when I say "Mmm.") "College students are
  not very formal. Even the profs have nicknames."</p>

  <p>"Do they know it?"</p>

  <p>"In time. They don't seem to care. We had a big Scot in Math, last year,
  with an enormous moustache. He discovered that he was 'The Walrus', and pared
  it down. When that didn't help, he shaved it off."</p>

  <p>"And then he wasn't a walrus, any more?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, he was still a walrus.... I say, Julia, I'm going to like you,
  most awfully." (I knew, then, that it was true. Zandy was going to like me.
  He couldn't have said it, that way, and not mean it.)</p>

  <p>"What is your sister's name?" (I think it better we should talk about his
  sister. I'm afraid my face is red, and my heart is just pounding!)</p>

  <p>"Alison.... She's married."</p>

  <p>"Does she live in Cincinnati, too?"</p>

  <p>"She lives in a Pullman car. Her husband is Roland Forsythe."</p>

  <p>"The famous tenor?"</p>

  <p>"Mmm... and tanker."</p>

  <p>"You mean he drinks?"</p>

  <p>"Like a fish."</p>

  <p>"Is that why your sister goes along?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly&mdash;but Alison doesn't mind. She likes excitement. And she
  thinks Providence has appointed her to keep a great artist sober. She married
  him for that."</p>

  <p>"And she can't?"</p>

  <p>"Not much of the time."</p>

  <p>"But how can he sing?"</p>

  <p>"You don't have to be sober to sing? A good many people never do sing
  unless they're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't always work that way. Some people get glum and mean."</p>

  <p>"Roland doesn't. He's mean when he's sober. But it'll get him, some day.
  Leaky heart."</p>

  <p>"How I hate it!" (I almost tell him why, for he's sure to find out.)</p>

  <p>Now they had reached the gate at the farther side of the woods, and Julia
  had climbed it, leaving Zandy to wait her return from the Post Office. She
  had discouraged his going along, reluctant to amuse the loafers who would be
  sitting in front of Eph Mumaugh's blacksmith shop.... Now she was back.</p>

  <p>"Look, Zandy!" (How natural it seemed to call him Zandy.) "I've got a
  school!&mdash;the Schrofe one!&mdash;the one I wanted!" (He takes the letter,
  and our hands touch.)</p>

  <p>"Writes like a ten-year-old boy, doesn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He probably never went to school much."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet he can multiply bushels by dollars." (We are down at the river,
  again, sitting on the grass.)</p>

  <p>"That's where I'm weak... figures. I think algebra's awful!" (I tell him
  all about having to go to Albion for the Institute.)</p>

  <p>"I'll help you. It's easy.... Explain it to you in an hour."</p>

  <p>"Will you, honestly?" (Zandy gives my hand a little pat. That was the
  first time.)</p>

  <p>"This afternoon!"</p>

  <p>"But I mustn't take your time. You'll be busy!"</p>

  <p>"What would I be busy at? It'll save my life." (His father is sore at him
  because he's decided to be a writer, instead of making nails, and he's
  changed his course in college, and his father has sent him to the country,
  all summer, as a punishment, instead of taking him along to Europe, as he had
  promised.)</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Most of the early part of the story would have been covered
  by the time Julia reached the woods. She had walked rapidly on the pike, and
  could afford to take the rest of the trip more leisurely.</p>

  <p>Now they were sitting on the river-bank behind the Baptist Cemetery. It
  was Thursday, late afternoon. They had known each other three days. She was
  reclining against the bole of a maple, using the opened algebra to protect
  her back from the rough bark. Zandy had just finished reading her the
  <i>Rubáiyát.</i> What a wonderful voice he had! So tender! Her eyes were
  wet.</p>

  <p>"Let me have it a minute. I want to see that verse about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She reached for the book.</p>

  <p>He took her hand.</p>

  <p>"Anybody would know at a glance, Julia, that you were meant for some kind
  of creative art."</p>

  <p>"How would they?"</p>

  <p>"Your thumb!"</p>

  <p>"What's funny about my thumb?" she had asked, searching his deep-set
  grey-green eyes.</p>

  <p>"Bends back so far.... Open your hand, dear.... Wide.... See?"</p>

  <p>"Does yours?... Let me look... Why, the very idea!... Is that what makes
  you think you can write?... Our hands are very much alike, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>A little shiver of excitement always came over Julia when she reached this
  part of the story.</p>

  <p>"We're alike in more ways than that, precious!"</p>

  <p>She had made a little effort to retrieve her hands. Zandy had taken both
  of them in one of his. When he kissed her, she did not resist. How
  everlastingly right it seemed! She had shared his kiss, a bit clumsily. They
  were both quite stampeded for a moment. She hoped he would kiss her again:
  perhaps she could do better. It was rather embarrassing to feel that one had
  been so awkward. She had done much better, the next time, maybe because it
  was not so hurried.... Zandy's kisses! They made your heart so big there
  wasn't room in your chest to breathe!</p>

  <p>He had walked back with her, that day, until they could see the chimney of
  her house. When she stopped, meaning that he mustn't come any farther, he
  said, "What are you doing, tonight?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It proved to be an eventful evening. Julia volunteered to
  accompany Martha to prayer-meeting. At the door of the church, however, she
  said, "I think I'll run over to the Post Office, first. ... I've a letter
  that should be mailed to Albion, about my room, you know."</p>

  <p>"I thought you had did that," said Martha. "You'll not be back afore
  meetin' is out!"</p>

  <p>But Martha seemed relieved. Julia knew that her sister preferred not to
  have other members of the family present when she testified to the
  submissiveness of her burden-bearing. It reflected no credit on her home,
  where, it was implied, she took all the hard knocks with little to show for
  them but a chastened spirit.</p>

  <p>"You'll not go through them dark woods, will yuh?" Martha cautioned. Julia
  promised.</p>

  <p>Zandy was waiting for her, by the fence where she had first met him. He
  kissed her lips, her eyes, her hair.... They were made for each other,
  weren't they?... They would plan to spend their lives together.... Why
  not?... Didn't she love him?...</p>

  <p>Someone was blowing out the malodorous kerosene lamps in the church when
  Julia returned across the stubble-field with Zandy, the shrill rendition of
  "God Be With You Till We Meet Again" warning them their tryst was over. They
  stopped in the darkness for a final embrace.</p>

  <p>"It won't be long now, sweetheart."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Zandy; I'm so happy!"</p>

  <p>The little group on the church porch was separating, Martha's prim voice
  conspicuous above the others.</p>

  <p>They walked home almost in silence, Martha mentally putting into rehearsal
  the testimony she meant to give, next time; Julia wondering what Martha would
  be saying if she knew that Zandy Craig was going along with her to Albion
  where they were to be <i>married!</i></p>

  <p>Late in the night, Julia, wide-awake but calm, wondered if she were
  playing the game squarely with everybody; with her father, with Martha, with
  Zandy's father, who made nails and was so gruff and domineering; with Zandy's
  mother, who already had a girl selected for him.... But, as Zandy had said,
  they had their own lives to live. Her father, her sister, his father, his
  mother&mdash;had they not been given a chance to live their lives, as they
  liked?... Maybe not.... It was all very confusing. Life was complicated.</p>

  <p>"We will do what our hearts tell us is exactly right, darling," Zandy had
  said. "Nobody in the world has a right to keep us apart. We will keep it a
  secret, now, but, one of these days, when they see how happy we are, and how
  right it all was, they will be glad."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Old Ferd remarked at supper, one Saturday evening in early
  November, that he had met Abner Schrofe, that afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Ab says," reported Ferd, proudly, "that Julia is the best teacher they
  ever had. I'm a-goin' to tell her when she comes down. It's no more 'n' right
  she should hear it... What's a-keepin' her?"</p>

  <p>"She's been a-lyin' down most o' th' afternoon, paw," said Martha. "I'm
  afeard that long walk every day is a-pullin' Julia down, now it's come rainy.
  She hasn't looked good fer quite a spell."</p>

  <p>"She was a-cryin' when I looked in to call her t' supper," said Greta.
  "Funny fer Julia to be a-cryin'."</p>

  <p>"I'll go up," said Martha. "Here, Susan, dish them turnips."</p>

  <p>Julia recognized her sister's step on the stairs, raised up on one elbow,
  dabbed at her eyes with a soggy little handkerchief, tucked a letter under
  her pillow.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'm quite all right, Martha. Working pretty hard, you know.
  Just... sort of unstrung. No&mdash;I don't believe I could eat a bite, not
  now. Maybe, after a while. Run along. It's nothing."</p>

  <p>Martha clumped down the stairs, and the letter was unfolded again.</p>

  <p>"What a misfortune, darling, if things are as you fear. If it had happened
  a little later&mdash;wouldn't we have been glad? Maybe it isn't that. Try not
  to worry.</p>

  <p>"All one hears about now is the big game with the Chicago Athletic Club on
  Thanksgiving. Father and mother are coming East for it. How I wish you could
  be here! Big doings!</p>

  <p>"If it's what you think, darling, can you go on, a little while, as if
  nothing had happened? How long? Maybe I can have a heart-to-heart with my
  father. But he's pretty hard, you know. Savage old thing, when disappointed.
  I'm afraid he'd take me out of college. That would set us back. If I can get
  through this year, the rest will be easy."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Julia had fainted at the Friday afternoon programme with
  which school closed for the Christmas holidays. The room was packed with
  visitors and stuffy with festal decorations. When the exercises were all but
  over, Julia crumpled in a pathetic heap on the floor. Young Jason Schrofe,
  whose attentions she had regarded so casually that he had quite lost hope,
  drove her home in his sleigh.</p>

  <p>"That settles it," said old Ferd. "She's not a-goin' to tramp through them
  snowdrifts any more.... You must find a place to board, Julia, closer by th'
  school."</p>

  <p>She smiled wanly and shook her head. She would be all right. No use
  wasting the money.</p>

  <p>She had hoped that the cruel exertion might... somehow... solve the
  problem. In any event, the long walk daily helped to distract her mind. She
  might go mad, otherwise.... How long would it be until people noticed?...
  What would those all-knowing young mothers think of her fainting?... How much
  torture could she stand in these cruel stays?</p>

  <p>"It fairly breaks my heart, darling," Zandy had written. "There you are,
  worrying your dear little head off; and here I am, starting home for the
  holidays, unable to bear even a wee bit of your trouble ... and discomfort,
  too, I suppose. I don't know much about such things."</p>

  <p>"The dear boy," thought Julia. "He doesn't know, of course. He probably
  thinks a woman just knows it's going to happen, on a certain day,
  and&mdash;when the time comes&mdash;it happens. And I don't know much more
  about it, except that I'm afraid I can't keep it a secret much longer ... not
  even for Zandy's dear sake."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Zandy was in line for the Perkins Medal in oratory. On no
  account must that event be jeopardized.... Could Julia, he wondered, manage
  to carry on until the oratorical contest was over? February third, it was.
  How about it, Julia, darling?</p>

  <p>Julia would certainly try. Zandy must not be disqualified for that medal.
  Perhaps his father would be that much more kind, if he won it. But, dear boy,
  let's arrange to tell them the very minute the contest is over! It's getting
  serious! Please!</p>

  <p>It so happened that on the very night when Zandy was laboriously composing
  a letter which began, "My dear Father Miller (for I really want to call you
  Father Miller, because your Julia is my wife; though I'm afraid you will be
  annoyed, a little, that we haven't told you earlier about our
  wedding)"&mdash;Greta had whispered to Susan, and Susan, white-faced, had
  whispered to Martha, and Martha, trembling with fear and indignation, had
  entered Julia's room without knocking.</p>

  <p>Julia was outstretched, her dark-circled eyes were closed, her hands lay
  supine, palms upward, on the counterpane. Martha looked at her for a long
  time before she spoke. She swallowed, noisily.</p>

  <p>"You might as well make a clean breast of it," said Martha, hoarsely.
  Julia opened her eyes and smiled.</p>

  <p>"In the drawer of my desk, Martha. Here's the key. That long paper. That's
  it. My marriage licence."</p>

  <p>"So you run off and got married, did yuh?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;not exactly... run off. We were married during the County
  Institute."</p>

  <p>"And you was in Albion, a-livin' with a man, while we thought you was
  a-goin' to that school that cost all o' Thirty Dollars!"</p>

  <p>"He was my husband&mdash;and it was my money."</p>

  <p>"Humph! He don't seem to set much store by yuh... a-leavin' yuh to face
  the music. What's his name?" Martha adjusted her steel-bowed spectacles, and
  stooped under the lamp. "Alexander Craig... who's that? You don't mean t' say
  it's that rich Craig's boy what was here last summer a-visitin' at the
  Squire's?"</p>

  <p>Julia nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's a heap the Craigs would do fer a Miller! You wait till your father
  hears o' this. He'll make that young rascal sweat! He'll have th' law on
  him!"</p>

  <p>So&mdash;at long last, Julia had no further need to punish her desperately
  ill-treated body. Ungirded&mdash;physically, mentally&mdash;she felt that her
  worst troubles were behind her. They could say what they liked, they could do
  what they would&mdash;she had made her last agonizing trip to the
  schoolhouse. There was some comfort in that, at least.</p>

  <p>Old Ferd was torn between grief and anger. He wanted to pour out his rage
  without delay. He would write to that lousy whelp and tell him, for once,
  what somebody should have told him long ago&mdash;that he was a low-lived
  coward, a dirty blackguard, and&mdash;and&mdash;if he ever darkened their
  door, except to bring the money to pay for Julia's sickness, he would be
  pitched out!... And he did write that, and more, pounded a stamp on the
  envelope with a fist that looked amazingly like Julia's, only not so white,
  and stalked, half-blind with hate, to the Post Office, where he was regarded
  with fresh interest, the loafers in corduroy coats and felt boots noting his
  state of mind and winking at one another out of the tails of their eyes. He
  was aware of it. Everybody knew, damn them!... There was a letter for Julia.
  She always got the mail, herself.... He would tear it up, and throw it in the
  river. The sleety gale sobered him, somewhat, on the way home. He did not
  destroy the letter.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"A couple of years from now, darling," wrote Zandy, a week
  later, "we will have forgotten all about this. At the moment, things do look
  pretty dark, don't they? I was all ready to come when I had the letter from
  your father. He is in a great temper; hardly to be blamed, of course; talked
  of shooting. Anyone else but your father, I would debate that subject with
  him. But all I could do for you now would be to stir up a tremendous row and
  probably make everything more difficult for you.</p>

  <p>"I postponed writing to my father until last Saturday; couldn't think up
  just the right way to approach the matter. He is always so autocratic and
  hair-triggery. I did the best I could to make him see things. There is a wire
  from him this afternoon, hundred words, saying he is done with me. That, of
  course, only means he is very sore. He may come around all right. But not
  very soon. You have no idea how stubborn he can be.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;meantime, I can't stay in school. My mind is too upset, anyway.
  I shall be out of funds, too. In fact, I'm out of funds now. The month's
  allowance is just due, and he isn't even going to send that. I've made up my
  mind to bum my way through to the Coast. This twenty is all the money I have
  but five dollars. You can depend on me to send you some more as soon as I
  have it. Don't be discouraged, dear. I intend to succeed. Success is more a
  gift than an achievement. Some people are born to succeed. I am one of them.
  You will share. Keep that in mind through these hard days. I shall soon send
  for you, and we will be happy together forever."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">With confidence unshaken, for there was a peculiar contagion
  associated with Zandy's optimism that gave her courage, Julia watched the
  last of the snow disappear.</p>

  <p>Everything was going to come out all right, as Zandy had predicted. He had
  started West to find work and make a little home. Then he would send for
  her... for <i>them!</i></p>

  <p>Every few days there came another postal card... from Detroit, Chicago,
  Davenport, Denver, Spokane. Zandy was on the way.</p>

  <p>Presently the lilacs were opening, and the air was vibrant with the hum of
  all sorts of awakened winged things. Julia could hear the occasional scream
  of her father's chisel doing a shrill aria to the accompanying rumble of the
  big wooden fly-wheel.</p>

  <p>"Poor old darling," she thought, tenderly. "He's worried about me, and
  trying to keep his hands busy... dear, shaky, old hands."</p>

  <p>"What's father making, Martha?"</p>

  <p>"Will yuh let on yer surprised when he gives it t' yuh?"</p>

  <p>"Mmm&mdash;but maybe you'd better not tell me if it's a secret."</p>

  <p>"A little cradle," whispered Martha. "Mind yuh don't let on."</p>

  <p>Julia wept a few happy tears. Her father had forgiven her, then. That was
  ever so much better. It would come out all right, as Zandy had said.</p>

  <p>When Doctor Engle came, next day, he was shortly after joined by Doctor
  Marshall, a specialist from Fort Wayne. Jason Schrofe had driven him up from
  Larwill.</p>

  <p>Doctor Marshall had quiet blue eyes and wore a brown suit that fitted him.
  He did not talk much, and hardly asked any questions at all. Julia had great
  confidence in him and felt no shyness in his strong, competent hands.</p>

  <p>The charge was twenty-five dollars, and when Julia had counted it
  out&mdash;after Doctor Engle had handed her the pocket-book from her
  desk&mdash;she was pleased to find that there was just enough; a twenty, a
  two, and three ones. Doctor Marshall looked at the money and the empty
  pocket-book, and said not to bother about paying it until she was well. He
  would send her a bill, some day.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Julia, gratefully. "I'll pay you as soon as I'm up."</p>

  <p>"That will be soon enough," said Doctor Marshall. Martha came and sat on
  the edge of the bed, after the doctors were gone, holding Julia's throbbing
  fingers. Martha had shown the doctors out, and Julia had heard them talking,
  downstairs, for a disturbingly long time. Martha's face, always an open book,
  was troubled. It twitched, as it did when she was worried.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Martha? You talked to them. Do they think I'm very sick? They
  don't think I'm going to&mdash;they don't think maybe I'm not going to get
  well, do they?" Julia's words came slowly, and as from a considerable
  distance.</p>

  <p>Martha pressed her bony knuckles hard against her cheek and swayed slowly
  back and forth.</p>

  <p>"They're a-doin' everythin' they knows how, Julia. We must all put our
  trust in th' Lord 'n' His precious promises.... Can't yuh let yerself just
  rest on His Blessed Name?"</p>

  <p>Julia turned her face away and stared hard at the white wall, her eyes
  wide, frightened.</p>

  <p>"Would yuh like Brother Miner t' come over from Cromwell 'n' talk t' yuh,
  Julia? It might be quite comfortin'."</p>

  <p>Julia shook her head, and there was a little convulsive shudder of her
  shoulders. Sighing audibly, Martha drew up the sheet over the quivering
  shoulders, laid the back of her rough hand against the hot neck, and quietly
  left the room.</p>

  <p>A violent storm was rising in Julia's breast&mdash;a devastating tornado
  of rebellion. Why had Fate played this ghastly trick on her? What had she
  ever done to earn this dull tragedy? What chance had she had from the
  beginning? Why had Destiny set her down in this stupid house&mdash;her mother
  a whining fool, her father a shabby old drunkard, her brothers and sisters
  nothing but clods and dolts?</p>

  <p>And that wasn't the worst of it! Fate had opened the door a little way and
  pointed toward liberty. Love&mdash;great love&mdash;had come! Why hadn't Fate
  left her to the tiresome little drudgeries that were the common lot of people
  badly born? Why this mocking glimpse of freedom?</p>

  <p>In her broken-dyked passion, Julia's scorn swept over everything and
  everybody associated with her disaster. Her father! What right had this
  drunken old man and his slatternly wife to bring her into the world at all?
  And this smug, surly, ignorant, superstitious old sister&mdash;calmly
  inviting her, in this hour of break-up, to like it!... to put her trust in
  the Lord! Mighty little He cared! Nobody cared! Least of all&mdash;the Lord!
  If He saw it, at all, He probably grinned! Another good joke!&mdash;saith the
  Lord.</p>

  <p>Martha was back now, seated again on the edge of the bed, wetting her
  thumb and leafing the thin pages of a book. Julia dully turned her eyes and
  recognized the cheap little Bible she had earned for faithful attendance at
  Sunday School when she was nine or ten. Martha was doubtless hunting for some
  more of those precious promises. What a dull, uninteresting old thing those
  precious promises had made of her!</p>

  <p>Clearing her throat and settling her spectacles more firmly on her thin
  nose, Martha held up the Bible at an angle that would better the light on the
  fine print. "No, please, Martha," muttered Julia. "Not now&mdash;please!"</p>

  <p>"I'll just leave it here, then," said Martha, regretfully. "Mebby it'll be
  a sort o' comfort just t' have it under yer pillow."</p>

  <p>She was gone now, leaving Julia with the precious promises within easy
  reach. But the storm was by no means spent. With white-knuckled little fists
  and tightly clenched teeth, rigid lips wide apart, Julia stared up defiantly.
  In a moment she gave way to the passionate indignation that was all but
  driving her mad. The precious promises! Bah!... God&mdash;and the
  Bible&mdash;and prayer&mdash;and the angels&mdash;and miracles&mdash;and
  faith that would remove mountains! Bah!... She groped under the pillow,
  clutched the book, opened it in the middle, utterly blind with hot tears and
  crazed with desperate anger, and began to claw at the pages with her nails.
  She buried all her fingers in the book, and tore, and ripped, and crumpled,
  making snarling little mutterings deep in her throat.</p>

  <p><i>"That!... and that!... for You!"</i> she panted. (Rip!) <i>"And
  that!... and this!... for Your...</i> (Crunch!)... <i>precious...
  promises!... Look!... if You can see... You cruel Thing... what I'm doing to
  your Holy Word!... Now! There!... send me to hell!"</i></p>

  <p>Completely spent by her exertion, Julia lay as one dead under the litter
  of ragged, crumpled desecration, her shuddering sobs all but subsided; and,
  fatigued beyond endurance, drifted away from the shameful scene, and
  slept.</p>

  <p>When she woke there was a dim light burning on the table. Her father was
  sitting on the low rocking-chair by the bed, elbows on knees, his fingers
  tangled in his shaggy grey hair. Remembering dully, she felt about on the
  counterpane. Nothing there. So it was only a bad dream, after all. That was
  good. Her fingers touched a rumpled scrap of paper. It was not a dream. She
  laid her hand on the torn paper and closed on it.</p>

  <p>Roused by her stirring, Ferd glanced up, and their eyes met. Julia's were
  inquisitive.</p>

  <p>Ferd shook his head, and smiled wanly.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Julia. I cleared it up. Nobody seen it. Guess you was a
  little out o' yer mind fer a spell."</p>

  <p>"I'm dreadfully sorry, father," she murmured, penitently. "It was ... an
  awful thing to do."</p>

  <p>Old Ferd caressed the white hand nearest him. With the other, Julia
  absently rolled the fragment she had found into a tight little ball.</p>

  <p>She fell to wondering whether there was anything still legible on the
  scrap; and, if so, whether it would be some frightful forecast of doom for
  sinners. Well&mdash;she deserved it, didn't she? She recalled her curiosity
  about the sentimental mottoes that came on thin, narrow, sticky strips of
  paper wrapped around cheap taffy at the County Fair. ... Funny how people
  took stock in the silly fortunes told that way.... She remembered a
  discussion between Martha and Becky Slemmer, one day, over the "messages"
  they had had by tossing the Bible open at random and reading the first verse
  at the top of the page.... Martha had come by many a precious promise
  accidentally... poor Martha.... Becky had laughed over some of hers, and
  Martha had hush-hushed her, warningly. Becky said you couldn't make much out
  of it, anyway. One time, after a big quarrel with Zelma in which they had
  bit, scratched, and pulled hair, she had gone to the Bible for guidance, and
  the magic verse at the top of the column said, "She is loud and stubborn."
  Becky was sure, at first, that the Lord referred to her sister, but she
  wondered afterward. Martha said: "No&mdash;Becky. The Lord wouldn't send a
  message t' Zelma through you. He must 'a' meant somethin' personal."</p>

  <p>"Shall I get yuh a cold drink, Julia?" Ferd was inquiring.</p>

  <p>"Please, father... and turn up the light a little, won't you, before you
  go down?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"You're ever so much better this morning," said Doctor
  Engle, cheerily.</p>

  <p>Julia smiled contentedly, and nodded.</p>

  <p>"You're overcoming this toxine, Julia."</p>

  <p>"What's toxine, doctor?" she inquired, interestedly.</p>

  <p>"Poison."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Julia, thoughtfully, "I have overcome it."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;maybe not all of it yet," he cautioned, stroking his cheek,
  "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Julia's dry lips puckered determinedly, and she nodded her head with an
  air of deep conviction.</p>

  <p>"All of it," she said, firmly, "all the poison is gone."</p>

  <p>That afternoon, to Martha's astonishment and disapproval, Julia demanded
  pen, ink, paper, and privacy. Protestingly, the weary and worried woman
  propped her sister up with pillows, and closed the door.</p>

  <p>Summoning all her depleted energy, Julia wrote a long letter addressed to
  her unborn child. The writing was uneven and sprawling, and the lines sagged
  at the right end, more and more, until the last ones ran nearly off the pages
  in a pitiful little toboggan toward the corner.</p>

  <p>Everything she knew about Dresden was in it; high pride for the things
  that were Dresden; high hopes for the heir to the Dresden tradition.</p>

  <p>Everything she knew about Zandy was in it; poor, bewildered Zandy, so
  frightfully misunderstood, and showing up so badly when he really had it in
  his heart to do the right thing.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to hide this letter, and hope that you find it, some day, in
  case anything happens to me. You'll not find it, perhaps, until you're big
  enough to want to take things to pieces and see how they were put together. I
  hope you won't find it even then. I hope you won't find it until you're old
  enough to have had a few harder bumps than just falling out of your
  cradle.</p>

  <p>"I've discovered a secret. It's going to take me through what I have to
  face. If I live, it's going to make me over into something else than I've
  been. If I die, I'll die happy. I'm going to tell you what I've found. It's
  the only thing I have to leave you. If you'll take it, and make use of it,
  you may need no other fortune."</p>

  <p>It was a difficult letter to write. The uncanny experience that had been
  hers, during the preceding eighteen hours, was not easy to explain. But Julia
  did the best she could, and with the last physical resource left from the
  fatigue of writing, she groped her way dizzily to the little walnut desk,
  with a great effort opened the secret drawer, deposited her letter, and
  returned to her bed, exhausted.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">After her grinding agony was over, Julia slept, and woke,
  and slept, and dreamed.</p>

  <p>In the late afternoon, she became slightly delirious. Martha caught
  fragments of it, and wept quietly.... Roses overhanging a trellis at the
  doorway of a little bungalow... Zandy being welcomed with outstretched arms
  that quickly fell inert from fatigue. ... Then&mdash;there was a garden... a
  high, grey, stone wall... and in the wall there was a door... and beyond the
  door, a river. ... Martha sobbed chokingly, and turned the iced towel on the
  hot forehead.... And on the river there was a punt... with a red and blue
  canopy... and the sound of a tender voice, singing... and a guitar.</p>

  <p>When she awoke again, it was almost dark. It was apparent to the watchers
  that Julia was mildly curious about the presence of the whole family.</p>

  <p>Doctor Engle was seated at the bedside with his fingers on her wrist. Her
  father stood stiffly beside him, his hands clenched. Martha slowly waved a
  palm-leaf fan, supporting her weary weight on outspread fingers laid against
  the head of the bed. Susan and Greta stood at the foot, staring wide-eyed.
  Hiram and Elmer were in the doorway.</p>

  <p>Julia's eyes slowly travelled over the group, finally coming to rest on
  old Ferd whom she inspected with gravity. She attempted a little smile for
  him&mdash;a solicitous little smile that seemed to say, "What a lot of
  trouble I'm making you. So sorry." Ferd couldn't face the stiff little smile
  any longer; closed his eyes, walked to the window, wept.</p>

  <p>Julia had kept her secret too long. Through hot, parched lips she asked
  Martha if she would please take care of the baby. Greta drew a sudden racking
  sob, and sank to the floor. Susan raised her up and tugged her out into the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"His name," murmured Julia, valiantly battling with the oncoming fog, "is
  Alexander Ferdinand.... But&mdash;Martha&mdash;if that's too long a name...
  for such a little boy... you may call him Zandy."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was late afternoon. They had just returned from the
  service at Oak Grove Baptist Church, and its sequel in the Cemetery. The long
  row of hitching-racks had been quite inadequate. Barely a third of the people
  had been able to enter the church.</p>

  <p>Martha had whispered to the undertaker, and he had laid one of the sprays
  on their mother's grave, hard-by. Jason Schrofe, observing that his flowers
  had been chosen for this tribute, tarried, after the others had moved away,
  and replaced it.</p>

  <p>Susan and Greta were busying themselves in the kitchen, sympathetically
  assisted by neighbours whose voices, restrained but endeavouring to be
  cheerful, drifted up the stairs where Martha, having laid her borrowed bonnet
  and veil on Julia's primly made, white-counterpaned bed, was stooping over
  the cradle.</p>

  <p>Old Ferd tiptoed into the room, and Martha glanced up.</p>

  <p>"Look at them long fingers," she said. "Like her'n."</p>

  <p>Ferd handed her a yellow envelope.</p>

  <p>"One o' the Schrofe boys fetched this over from Cromwell."</p>

  <p>Martha opened it, read it through, silently, her lips forming the words,
  and gave it back. Ferd stared hard at the message from Seattle.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">COURAGE DARLING IT WILL NOT BE LONG NOW GOOD JOB
  ZANDY</p><br>

  <p>He tossed the telegram on Julia's bed, and stumbled out of the room,
  whimpering like a punished child.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That night&mdash;as if the Millers had not already furnished
  enough sensation to satisfy the community&mdash;Ferd hanged himself from a
  rafter in the vacant stall next to Florrie.</p>

  <p>Hiram had gone out to throw down some straw, and saw It, from the
  mow-ladder, slowly revolving. Martha, hearing a hoarse shout, ran from the
  kitchen and found her brother retching violently. It seemed a long time
  before they found a box high enough to stand on.</p>

  <p>"I was a-feared o' this, all along," groaned Martha.</p>

  <p>Greta kept screaming, hysterically, while she tugged at the rope of the
  dinner-bell that clanged ominously from its perch on the roof of the
  milkhouse.</p>

  <p>The barnyard filled with neighbours carrying lanterns. Milt Mumaugh
  volunteered to drive to Albion for the coroner, and put his three-year-old
  roan mare to a gallop.</p>

  <p>It was a warm night, but they felt chilly and built a fire to sit by while
  they waited. About midnight, the wives of the watchers served sandwiches,
  cake, and coffee.</p>

  <p>Abner Schrofe and Doc Engle sat on the doorstep of old Ferd's shop,
  smoking and slapping mosquitoes.</p>

  <p>"Baby a-goin' t' live, Doc?"</p>

  <p>"Looks like it.... Poor little devil.... Maybe better off if it died....
  Not much of a future for it, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;as fer that," drawled Abner, "yuh never c'n tell."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"AND now, Ferdinand"&mdash;Reverend Miles Brumm pursed a
  public smile&mdash;"perhaps you had better mount your new pony, and see how
  he sits."</p>

  <p>"Please, Uncle Miles, I don't want to."</p>

  <p>Ferdinand's voice was barely audible, but to the congregation assembled in
  the parsonage barn-lot there was no mistaking the determined shake of his
  curly head.</p>

  <p>Consternation prevailed in the audience, composed of half the children in
  Zanesdale, and what Mr. Brumm would have considered on Sunday morning as "a
  goodly company" of adults.</p>

  <p>A medley of encouragement, ridicule, insufferable patronage, and downright
  contempt volleyed at the embarrassed boy.</p>

  <p>"Aw, gwan! Ride him!"... "Don't be scairt of him, Ferdinand; he won't
  throw yuh!"... "He's yourn, hain't he? Git on 'im!"... "Shucks!&mdash;feared
  of a Shetland pony!"... "Yeah&mdash;tame as a kitten!"</p>

  <p>Ferdinand hung his head, abstractedly crushed an ant with his bare toes,
  and was painfully conscious of the rapid beating of a bulging vein in his
  neck.</p>

  <p>"Bet he cost a hundred dollars!" appraised Nathan Himes, who had joined
  the procession when it passed his drugstore.</p>

  <p>"Hundred dollars!" scoffed Bill Trask, the station agent; "that there
  saddle 'n' bridle cost more 'n' a hundred dollars!"</p>

  <p>"My land!" exclaimed Sophie Trask, proudly relaying her husband's
  versatility to the huddle of women by the big gate, "Mr. Trask says the
  saddle and bridle alone must 'a' cost more than a hundred dollars! What must
  the pony be worth?"</p>

  <p>Nobody paid any attention to the comment except young Mrs. Himes (her as
  was one o' them Sheriff Effendorfer girls from over beyond Maples; so stuck
  up&mdash;all of 'em&mdash;their noses was out o' joint), who, behind her
  hand, remarked to Clara Sellars, the lately-from-Wayne peroxide-blonde
  milliner (less said the better), that the Trasks always knew so much, to
  which Miss Sellars replied, in a disgusted undertone, "Don't they give yuh a
  pain?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Brumm, aware of the unanimous curiosity about the pony, to which his
  young nephew had now added spice by his reluctance to exhibit a natural
  interest in it, felt himself in an awkward situation. He had been unprepared
  for the episode that had plunged his family into the public eye. No chance
  had been given him to collect his thoughts or confer with Ferdinand in
  private.</p>

  <p>It was the lad's tenth birthday. At breakfast he had received a large,
  inexpensive pocket-knife from his uncle, a sticky, acrid-smelling,
  red-and-green <i>Child's Illustrated Bible</i> from his aunt, and three
  lead-pencils in a slim pasteboard box from Angela. He had put down the apple
  he was munching, and had gone about, as the custom was, dutifully kissing the
  donors&mdash;Uncle Miles, first; for Uncle Miles was always served first with
  whatever happened to be in distribution; and then Aunt Martha, who moistened
  a finger and brushed back the unruly lock that dipped to a point in the
  centre; and then Angela, whom he tried to kiss on the cheek, for Angela's
  kisses were wet, and he had a disinclination toward them which he hoped she
  would realize, one of these days, without too much injury to her
  feelings.</p>

  <p>At that mellow moment&mdash;for, however stiffly the family ties were
  habitually starched, there were festal occasions when something like
  spontaneous affection had its innings&mdash;there was a vigorous rap at the
  kitchen door. Straightening his frayed cravat, Mr. Brumm had answered the
  summons. A stranger's business-like voice was heard.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brumm?... How do you do, sir?... Very well, sir.... My name is
  Thompson. I'm from Chicago; that is, I'm from the Winnetka Stock Farm. Our
  people has had orders to deliver a pony here for Master Craig&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Through the open door came the rumble of many voices. Angela wiped her
  shapely lips on her sleeve and hurried to the window. Ferdinand stared hard
  at Aunt Martha, listening intently.</p>

  <p>"He lives with you, don't he?... It's a birthday gift from his father....
  It's Mr. Craig's instructions from Seattle.... I've just got in with it,
  expressed from our place in Winnetka.... The pony's out here in your lot,
  delivered in good shape, as you'll see, and if you, or the young gentleman,
  will sign these papers, I can catch the nine-seventeen back to the city....
  Right here you are, sir, on that line; and here, too, if you please.
  Thanks!... Quite a crowd we gathered up, coming through the village, eh?
  Guess it's the first time a pony ever came to this town on a passenger
  train."</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha had taken off her brown apron and joined her husband at the
  back door, nervously smoothing her hair with both hands.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand, blinking rapidly, and tapping his front teeth with a restless
  thumb, squeezed past his aunt, and ventured out upon the back porch, quite
  overawed by the gathering crowd.</p>

  <p>Uncle Miles, with a pumped-up air of heartiness, as if he himself were
  being presented with a thoroughbred Shetland pony by his admiring
  fellow-townsmen, breezed forth to the barnyard, delightedly intoning,
  "Well&mdash;well&mdash;indeed!... A great surprise, I'm sure!... A pony!...
  Well&mdash;well!"</p>

  <p>It was the crowd that remembered the pony was Ferdinand's.</p>

  <p>"Heigh! Ferdinand! Come on out! Look what yuh got!"</p>

  <p>"Must I, Aunt Martha?" asked Ferdinand, his face twitching.</p>

  <p>"Of course, silly!" shouted Angela, clutching his hand and dragging him
  along.</p>

  <p>"Fancy that great big boy having to be tugged out of the house to see a
  pony!" scoffed Clara Sellars.</p>

  <p>"He's only a kid," explained Mrs. Himes. "Awful big for his age; tall as
  his half-sister, and she must be all of fourteen. I s'pose he's just shy of
  so many people."</p>

  <p>Very much embarrassed, Ferdinand allowed himself to be propelled through
  the crowd. He drew a stiff, reluctant smile, reached out a slim hand, stroked
  the pony's velvet muzzle, and was generously rewarded for the tentative
  caress, the pony sniffing inquisitively at his pockets and licking his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Aw&mdash;look&mdash;ain't that cute?" The women cooed appreciatively, and
  beamed on Aunt Martha, who had joined them, murmuring apologies for her looks
  and all. They told her she looked quite all right, they were sure.</p>

  <p>Miss Sellars, pretending interest in the half-finished sweater that Mrs.
  Himes was carrying under her arm, whispered, "Did yuh ever see such an old
  frump?"</p>

  <p>"Awful pious, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Can't people be pious without&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mrs. Himes, "Sh!&mdash;Listen!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;Ferdinand&mdash;" said Uncle Miles.</p>

  <p>"No, Uncle Miles." His deep-set, grey-green eyes were perplexed, and his
  face was contorted as he gnawed his lips. He stepped back, and glanced about
  as if looking for a way of escape.</p>

  <p>Mr. Brumm wiped his brow with a large handkerchief. It would hardly do to
  send these parishioners of his away with so great a mystery to discuss.</p>

  <p>"Don't you like your pony?" he stammered, in a tone that affected to
  express the general surprise.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Ferdinand's voice was husky under the strain. "But I mustn't
  have it! I can't have it! You know why!" Hot tears sprang to his eyes, and he
  scurried through the speechless crowd, disappearing into the house.</p>

  <p>"Ferdinand's a little nervous and excited," explained Mrs. Brumm, primly,
  but obviously shaken by the unfortunate event. "He wasn't expecting a pony,
  you know, and what with so many good friends coming along, and
  all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's it&mdash;that's it," said Mr. Brumm, who, upon Ferdinand's
  retreat, had moved toward his wife to learn what explanation she was offering
  for this strange conduct. "Ferdinand will be quite himself, presently."</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I bet there's a skeleton in the Brumms' closet, all right, all
  right!" muttered Miss Sellars. "They're badly fussed&mdash;both of 'em!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Ferdinand, face downward on his bed, could hear the
  children's excited shouts as they took turns riding the pony about the
  barn-lot. ... It sounded now as if they had taken him out into the road.
  "Please let me next, Angela!"... "I said first, Angela!"... "These stirrups
  is too high!"</p>

  <p>He heard his uncle's heavy footsteps on the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Now, my boy, what's the trouble?" Uncle Miles was serious.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand stifled a racking sob.</p>

  <p>"You know I can't take anything from <i>him!...</i> Sure&mdash;I love the
  pony, and I want it awfully... but I wouldn't take anything from
  <i>him</i>&mdash;<i>not if he gave me a million trillion dollars!"</i></p>

  <p>"But you didn't have to show off like that before all our people! What do
  you suppose they'll think?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care what they think," growled Ferdinand into the damp pillow.
  "It's none of their business, is it?"</p>

  <p>"They'll make it their business to find out."</p>

  <p>Uncle Miles sat down on the edge of the bed, Ferdinand moving over with a
  great effort to make him room.</p>

  <p>"You are a strange child, Ferdinand, to feel this way about your father."
  Uncle Miles laid a hand on the twitching shoulder. "I hardly thought it
  possible for a child of your years to be capable of as much hatred as
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But <i>you</i> hate him, don't you, Uncle Miles? Aunt Martha hates
  him!"</p>

  <p>"Hate is an ugly word, Ferdinand. Neither your Aunt Martha nor I hate
  anybody in the whole wide world&mdash;not even your erring father. Whatever
  mistakes he may have made in letting your young mother suffer and be
  misunderstood and maligned... and die... it will do you no good to carry a
  grudge&mdash;especially now that he wants to be friendly."</p>

  <p>At this, Ferdinand broke down completely, and cried piteously.</p>

  <p>"He waited for ten years!... Not one word from him!... Even if you and
  Aunt Martha did hate him, I kept hoping he would write to me when I got big
  enough to read.... But I swore, last Christmas morning, I would hate him...
  forever!"</p>

  <p>"On Christmas morning!" Uncle Miles was horrified. "What a day to choose
  for a pledge to everlasting hate!"</p>

  <p>"Good as any," grumbled Ferdinand.</p>

  <p>Uncle Miles took a turn or two up and down the room, tugging at his black
  burnsides.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;if you're sure you don't want the pony"&mdash;Uncle Miles's
  tone was conciliatory&mdash;"we'll sell it. Perhaps that would be more
  prudent, anyway. You've shown pretty good judgment for a small boy. We can't
  afford a pony, and our people know it. You would only make the other children
  envious. It's out of keeping with everything else we have.... Suppose we sell
  the pony, and put the money in bank for your college education: how's
  that?"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;Uncle Miles!"&mdash;Ferdinand's voice rose shrilly. "That's all
  the same, isn't it? I don't want anything he's got! I won't have his ponies,
  or saddles, or colleges, or anything! He same as killed my mother! Aunt
  Martha said so! I'm going to write and tell him so! You see if I don't!"</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;now!" soothed Uncle Miles. "You wouldn't do that."</p>

  <p>He patted Ferdinand on the head and walked slowly out of the room and down
  the hall to his study, where he slumped into the shabby morris chair by the
  window and meditatively twisted the burnsides into pencil-points.</p>

  <p>Every three months since his marriage to Martha Miller, seven years ago,
  he had received a draft for two hundred and fifty dollars from his prosperous
  brother-in-law. It exceeded his salary.</p>

  <p>Indeed, his decision to marry Martha Miller&mdash;which he tried later to
  tell himself was based on the fact that she, albeit unsightly and eccentric,
  was an excellent housekeeper, a paragon of piety, and singularly devoted to
  his motherless little Angela&mdash;had been hastened upon her confiding to
  him that the baby Ferdinand was something other than a liability.</p>

  <p>"It's very sacrificial of you, Miss Miller," he had said, that April
  afternoon on his return to the Miller home for a brief glimpse of Angela,
  who, since the revival he had conducted at the Oak Grove Baptist Church in
  November, had been happily in Martha's care&mdash;"it's very fine of you to
  have assumed, so cheerfully, the burden of your unfortunate sister's child:
  very unselfish, indeed!"</p>

  <p>Martha had smiled, cryptically.</p>

  <p>"I must be honest with yuh, Brother Brumm. Of course, I would 'a' took
  care o' Julia's baby, like I promised, even if young Craig had disowned
  it.... But&mdash;he remembers."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?... Does him credit, I must say.... Does he remember
  substantially, may I ask, Miss Martha?"</p>

  <p>"Two hundred and fifty every quarter." Martha seemed satisfied with the
  effect of her announcement. "Reg'lar as the clock."</p>

  <p>"A thousand dollars a year, Martha, for the keep of a baby?"</p>

  <p>Martha nodded, smiled, folded her arms, rocked gently.</p>

  <p>"I had a promise from Craig"&mdash;she leaned forward and lowered her
  voice confidentially&mdash;"shortly after our poor Julia passed away. He had
  wrote a-sayin' was there anything he could do, though at the minute he hadn't
  much to do with, he said, and I reckon that was true.... Give the devil his
  due, I always say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you would, Martha!"</p>

  <p>He recalled Martha's prompt reaction to the note of tenderness in his
  voice. She had smiled appreciatively, puckered her lips self-deprecatingly,
  touched her hair, rather gingerly; for it was the first time she had done it
  up over a rat&mdash;not one of the larger rats, to be sure, such as the bulky
  Susan affected; a mere mouse, indeed, compared to Susan's&mdash;and was
  obviously not quite at ease with her greying foretop so heavily shadowing her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;and so&mdash;then&mdash;Oh, yes; then I wrote him as how poor
  Julia had gave me th' baby t' bring up, and that I meant t' do so, well as I
  could. If he ever wanted t' send me anything toward its keep, all well and
  good, I said, but the baby was mine. I told him as how it was Julia's last
  words, and it was, almost. I asked him t' promise he would never try t' take
  little Alexander away from me, or even write to him when he grew big enough
  t' understand; fer it might make him discontented and all... <i>and he
  promised!</i>"</p>

  <p>"Alexander? I thought the child's name was Ferdinand."</p>

  <p>"Well, you see Julia had wrote a letter, a couple o' days afore she died,
  and if the baby was a boy it was to be Alexander. So Craig always calls him
  Alexander.... We just couldn't; not after what he'd done, 'n' all....
  Anyways, that's the baby's other name."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brumm had proposed marriage to Martha, that evening, and had been
  accepted with a coyness he had hardly suspected her capable of in the face of
  her nun-like, ascetic piety.</p>

  <p>On the day of their wedding in December&mdash;Mr. Brumm had just returned
  aglow over the quite brilliant success of his three weeks' revival at
  Partridge Crossing, Illinois&mdash;certain small items of business were under
  discussion. He and Martha were out walking in the snow on the highway, safe
  from the hostile curiosity of the family in whose opinion that slick feller
  Brumm was a-tryin' t' lay his miracle-workin' hands on th' baby's money, an
  indictment they had hinted at, in his presence, and freely discussed within
  easy earshot.</p>

  <p>Martha had beamed over the prompt victory she had won in gaining his
  consent to look for a settled pastorate and discontinue his itinerant
  evangelistic career. Her solicitude over his endurance of cold beds,
  unwholesome food, and long journeys touched him, even if&mdash;as he
  suspected&mdash;there was another reason, quite as good, for her request. As
  the wife of a minister, Martha hoped to enjoy whatever refracted glory shone
  upon that office. There would be small comfort sitting at home, unrecognized,
  with the care of two small children&mdash;Angela was seven, Ferdinand
  three&mdash;while her crusading spouse spent blocks of weeks in distant
  parts.</p>

  <p>With this triumph scored, Martha was prepared to be generous when Miles
  (it was becoming easier to call him Miles) suggested that he would deeply
  appreciate it if their future negotiations with Alexander Craig might be
  conducted by himself. It would be much more pleasant, all 'round, if he, as
  head of the household&mdash;and would not little Ferdinand be the same as his
  own son, now?&mdash;were entrusted with this business.</p>

  <p>Pursuant to that agreement, Martha had promptly written to Seattle
  notifying her young brother-in-law of her marriage and stating that hereafter
  Mr. Brumm was to be considered custodian of the child's funds, adding that
  the arrangement would undoubtedly make Mr. Brumm even more interested in
  little Alexander. She hadn't said why.</p>

  <p>Shortly before little Ferdinand was eight, Mr. Brumm had received a letter
  from Craig&mdash;they had always referred to him as Craig; not Mr. Craig,
  which would have denoted an unearned respect for him, or Alexander, which
  would have seemed more friendly than they felt&mdash;inquiring whether it
  would be considered a violation of his covenant if he wrote to his son on the
  occasion of his next birthday. The letter was typed on the expensively
  embossed stationery of <i>The Puget Sound</i>&mdash;<i>Editorial
  Department.</i></p>

  <p>Mr. Brumm, who enjoyed letting himself go, a bit, with a pen, had written
  a reply which, after many revisions, pleased him.</p>

  <p>"We live very simply here, as becomes the family of a village clergyman,
  on small pay, ministering to a by no means well-to-do community composed of
  persons who for the most part make their own clothes and grow their own food.
  Your son's wants are few. As you are aware, we have thought it imprudent to
  inform him of your benefactions. Did he know that we are receiving generous
  amounts of money on his account, it would unquestionably alter his relation
  to our household, both in his mind and ours. It would make for constraint,
  and, perhaps, a breakdown of the discipline which every small boy, however
  tractable, requires."</p>

  <p>There was a great deal more of it, running into all of four pages,
  redundantly cautioning Mr. Craig that any affectionate gesture toward his
  son, at this time, would make the child restless in his humble home, and
  reminding Mr. Craig of his promise to Mrs. Brumm "never to disturb the
  existing relationship while she lives."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brumm had had no reply to that letter which, he felt, deserved
  adequate recognition, considering the amount of time and labour he had spent
  on its composition. The quarterly remittances continued to arrive
  unaccompanied by any personal message. On each occasion, Mr. Brumm receipted
  with a brief note, reporting on the boy's health and advancement in school,
  always optimistically. As for young Ferdinand's opinion of his father, they
  had tried to shape it properly by making the relationship seem as remote as
  possible. How else, indeed, were they to insure the child's contentment?</p>

  <p>Reflecting on it now, in the light of this morning's dismaying episode,
  Mr. Brumm wondered if they had not slightly overdone their efforts to portray
  Craig as a selfish, cowardly scapegrace who had fled in terror from the
  gravest of obligations. He was aware that Martha had spared no ugly words in
  recounting for Ferdinand the pitiful details of a tragedy which had become an
  obsession in her cramped mind. Would this hot-headed boy actually write to
  his father, provoking an open breach, perhaps an investigation? It was a
  comfort to remember that Ferdinand did not know his father's address beyond
  the bare fact that he lived in Seattle. But was that a comfort? Mr. Brumm
  wondered if a letter addressed to Alexander Craig, Seattle, might not be
  delivered.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Meantime, while Mr. Brumm toyed absently with his beard,
  there was a dull rumble of conversation drifting in from Ferdinand's room,
  where Aunt Martha was endeavouring to set everything right. From the boy's
  protests, it was to be gathered that she was not meeting with much
  success.</p>

  <p>"I was just a-sayin' to Ferdinand"&mdash;Aunt Martha rose from the low
  rocking-chair, and leaned against the foot of the bed as Uncle Miles strolled
  in&mdash;"that we mustn't have any more fuss now about this pony business.
  It's gone plenty far enough!"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Uncle Miles casually, "we'll think it over and decide what's
  the best thing to do. Ferdinand's going to be reasonable, I feel sure."</p>

  <p>His shoes squeaked as he went downstairs. Aunt Martha sighed audibly, and
  followed him. Ferdinand, fatigued by the emotional storm, yawned, stretched,
  slept.</p>

  <p>After a brief conference in the kitchen, Uncle Miles harnessed the glossy
  bay mare to the jump-seat buggy, while Aunt Martha, in their downstairs
  bedroom, changed to her white lawn with the black spray.</p>

  <p>"Angela," she called, "your father 'n' me are a-goin' to make a call on
  Sister Sprecker."</p>

  <p>In deference to Ferdinand's distress, Angela had cheerfully consented that
  the pony should be stabled, and was sitting on one foot in the porch swing
  deeply absorbed in <i>The Last Days of Pompeii,</i> which, after many
  unsuccessful attempts, she was devouring with interest. The book was lowered
  to her lap for a moment. Odd&mdash;making a visit on Saturday afternoon.
  Father always reserved Saturday for study.</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha did not explain that she herself was to be left with Sister
  Sprecker, who lived on the pike halfway to Bluffton, while Uncle Miles
  continued to town for the purpose of sending a telegram, which he could not
  prudently dispatch from Zanesdale, inquiring of the Winnetka Stock Farm
  whether they would buy back the pony and equipment. She tiptoed upstairs, and
  returned to the front screen-door, bonneted and black-mitted for her
  journey.</p>

  <p>"Ferdinand's asleep, Angela. He's been so stirred up 'n' all. Get him a
  piece when he comes down. We mayn't be back much afore sundown. You peel th'
  potatoes, 'n' make a good fire about five o'clock."</p>

  <p>Briefly disengaging herself from panic-stricken Pompeii, Angela mumbled
  acquiescence and hoped they would have a good time.</p>

  <p>She was a flaxen-haired, large-eyed, precocious youngster whom her father
  regarded as a valuable asset in his profession. A great deal of attention had
  been paid to Angela when she was a mere tiny tot by the adoring widows and
  elderly maidens in whose indulgent care she had been lodged, in at least a
  score of small towns, while her father was pursuing his evangelistic
  ministry, previous to his second marriage.</p>

  <p>Sometimes she sat beside him in the pulpit, an enraptured and undeniably
  touching picture of cherubic innocence. Not infrequently she was adverted to,
  with a tender gesture, when the preacher spoke feelingly of the uninquisitive
  faith to be found at its best in the heart of a child.</p>

  <p>At eight, Angela had sung, "I'll Meet Mother Over There," in a sweet,
  unaffected, little voice that had utterly devastated with emotion the large
  crowd on the last night of Mr. Brumm's memorable revival at Unger, shortly
  after accepting their call.</p>

  <p>More than a hundred souls were saved during that revival; and at least a
  score, already saved, experienced the second blessing. Little Angela herself
  had publicly professed a receipt of the second blessing, on that final night
  of the revival, somewhat to her parent's confusion; for this degree, while
  not explicitly restricted to an adult constituency, had not&mdash;at least
  within his own purview&mdash;been undertaken by anyone of Angela's immature
  years. There was nothing he could do about it, however; certainly not at the
  moment, seeing with what a spontaneous wave of hysterical exultation the
  child's bland announcement was accepted. In fact, it was Angela's second
  blessing that had brought the month's "big meetin'" to an almost painfully
  triumphant crescendo insuring her father's standing in the community for five
  successful years.</p>

  <p>As was to be expected, Angela, thereafter, was looked to, on occasions
  when emotion ran high, for a tender song, a fervid testimony, a sugary little
  prayer&mdash;demands which she met so adequately that even she herself could
  not have failed to realize the value of her talent, had she been infinitely
  more reticent than she was. Everybody predicted a bright future for Angela.
  It went without debate that she could expect to be mightily used by the Lord.
  Aunt Martha occasionally hinted to her husband that it would be a pity if
  Angela's head should be turned by so much praise; but, observing that his
  smug smile left something unsaid on the subject of envy, she did not venture
  to press the matter.</p>

  <p>No endeavour had been made to capitalize Ferdinand's piety which was of a
  much less showy type. He had displayed no prophetic gifts. At Christmas and
  on Children's Day he spoke short pieces and participated in dialogues, always
  without enthusiasm or promise of future distinction either as an apostle or
  platform orator. Privately he despised these exhibitions, and consented to be
  a party to them only when his loyalty to his uncle was challenged. Especially
  did he loathe the dialogues. Overtopping by a head all the other boys of his
  age, he appeared the dolt in a line-up of brighter juniors, albeit some of
  them might be older than he. It was a sore trial, indeed, when it came his
  turn to hold up a little white pasteboard card bearing the letter D, and
  recite, shamefacedly, amid the pardonable titters of the
  congregation:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"I am the Daisy that grows in the spring,<br>
  Sweetly adoring the love of our King."</p><br>

  <p>Presently all these letters would spell</p><br>

  <p class="sign">GODS LITTLE FLOWERS</p><br>

  <p style="text-indent: 0em;">and he could stumble awkwardly to his seat
  beside Aunt Martha, who, smiling benignly, would wet a finger and brush back
  the lock that had come all the way from Dresden.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand accepted Angela's opulent faith at face value. It never occurred
  to him to be jealous of the marked attentions she received, wherever they
  went, sometimes in quite glaring contrast to the attitude people manifested
  toward him. He rejoiced in her well-deserved popularity. He liked Angela. The
  hazard of childish quarrels between them had been reduced to a minimum by the
  fact that no question of property rights ever arose. Until recently, Angela
  had contented herself at play with her dolls and dishes. Ferdinand, when not
  whittling sticks, amused himself with his small set of smeary rubber-type.
  They kept out of each other's way.</p>

  <p>Of late, however, Angela had been taking more interest in Ferdinand. At
  first he had been flattered by these friendly attentions; though, on the
  whole, he rather liked her better when she left him to his own devices.
  Sometimes she came out to the bench, behind the woodhouse, and sat by him
  while he whittled toy furniture out of soft pine; sat very close, often
  hampering him.</p>

  <p>Angela confided in him very freely now, as if he were her own age. One of
  these days she was going to be an evangelist. She could do it now if they
  would let her. Not only would she do a great deal of good, but she could earn
  some money. She could have nice clothes. "And I'll get you a really good
  printing outfit, too, Ferdinand. You want one very much, don't you?"</p>

  <p>And when he said he certainly did&mdash;very much&mdash;she would kiss
  him, and say: "Never you mind. I'll get you one that you can print a little
  newspaper on. Wouldn't that be fun?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Ferdinand was roused by Angela's voice down in the parlour,
  singing, "That Will Be Glory For Me," to her own accompaniment on the
  melodeon. He was debating whether he should not go down and ask Aunt Martha
  for a piece of pie, now that he had slept through dinner-time. It was almost
  three.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the music stopped abruptly. Angela was calling from the foot of
  the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Ferdinand!"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es."</p>

  <p>"You awake now?"</p>

  <p>"Um-humm."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Lonesome?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but I'm hungry."</p>

  <p>"Want me to bring you a piece of cake and a banana?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;if you want to."</p>

  <p>She came presently and sat down beside him on the bed, licking sticky
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want any?" asked Ferdinand, his mouth full.</p>

  <p>"I just had some. Did you know that father and Aunt Martha have gone away
  for all afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"No.... Let's go down and play croquet."</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry you had such an unhappy birthday, Ferdinand." Angela's voice
  was husky. "I could have cried for you, this morning. Do you feel better
  now?" She put an arm around him and pushed him back on the pillow.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand made a brave show of not being annoyed when Angela bent over
  him, burying her hot face in his neck, and blinding him with her tousled
  hair.</p>

  <p>"Let me up, Angela. You're smothering me!" shouted Ferdinand. "I don't
  feel like romping."</p>

  <p>"I'm not romping," whispered Angela, trembling.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Ten minutes later, Angela, with very red cheeks, went to the
  melodeon and continued where she had left off at the third verse of "That
  Will Be Glory For Me," hoping that Ferdinand's stubbornness meant he was too
  dumb to understand, or, having understood, would not unintentionally give her
  away.</p>

  <p>The front doorbell rang loudly, and Angela, still scarlet and shaky,
  answered it. Mr. Trask had brought a telegram for Ferdinand. Whatever was
  Ferdinand doing with telegrams?</p>

  <p>She rushed upstairs with it. He was standing at the window, drumming
  absently on the pane with his knuckles. He did not turn.</p>

  <p>"Look what you got!" Angela hoped the message would be pleasant, at least
  diverting.</p>

  <p>He clumsily opened the envelope and mystifiedly read the telegram several
  times before its meaning became quite clear. It was signed by the Winnetka
  Stock Farm.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">WE HAVE BRUMMS WIRED PROPOSAL TO RESELL TO US PONY AND
  EQUIPMENT DELIVERED YOU TODAY STOP IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WIRE IMMEDIATELY
  COLLECT</p><br>

  <p>"What is it?" Angela was bursting with curiosity.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand crumpled the message in his first, and shuffled past her toward
  the stairway. There he paused, his face working, his eyes brimming with angry
  tears.</p>

  <p>"You're all a lot o' cheaters!" he screamed.</p>

  <p>Angela stood in open-mouthed amazement.... So unlike Ferdinand to explode
  like that!</p>

  <p>He clumped down the stairs, savagely shouting: "I hate all of you! Do you
  hear me? I hate everybody in th' whole damn world!"</p>

  <p>Angela brightened.</p>

  <p>"He won't tell, then," she reflected.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand flung himself out of the house, banged the front gate, pulled
  his cap far down over his red nose, dug his fists deep into the pockets of
  his pants (cut down from a pair of his uncle's), and stamped sullenly up the
  road toward the railroad track, only three hundred yards away. The east-bound
  Erie Flyer was just due. It always stopped at Zanesdale for water.</p>

  <p>Sometimes Ferdinand strolled down to the station and stood close beside
  the dripping water-tank when, at exactly three-thirty-six, the huge
  locomotive paused, gasping rhythmically, while the torrent poured into the
  capacious tender, the fireman on the coal-pile, holding the rope, calmly
  smoking his pipe, unmindful of his happy privilege.</p>

  <p>Most of the fast trains thundered through Zanesdale with a terrifying
  racket. Ferdinand never failed to experience a surge of hot indignation over
  this arrogant contempt for his town. He knew it wasn't much of a town; had
  contempt for it himself; but it was annoying to have the utter insignificance
  of Zanesdale thrust upon him nine times a day.</p>

  <p>He would not have time to run down to the station, now, even if he had
  been in a mood for running: besides, he didn't care to answer any questions
  that Mr. Trask might ask, so that he might be able to tell Mrs. Trask the
  sequel to the pony story which she would promptly explain to the town.</p>

  <p>He climbed on top of the gate-post at the corner of Harsh's
  melon-patch&mdash;his favourite vantage when watching the long, black, proud
  Pullmans flick by, each adding its own little "Psst!" of disdain; and watched
  Number Nine (he knew all the trains that way) slow to a screeching stop.
  There was a long hiss of escaping air from the brakes; an acrid smell of
  greasy, hot metal. The diner was directly in front of him. Little tables with
  candles on them. A man and a woman, with a black waiter hovering over them.
  Too late for dinner, too early for supper: this must be "tea." People in
  stories were always having "tea." Ferdinand drew down the corners of his
  mouth and hated the man and the woman, though he knew she was a pretty woman.
  He hated the obsequious waiter, and mumbled, audibly, "Damn nigger!"</p>

  <p>The train moved slowly on, so slowly that the locomotive was exasperated
  by the sluggishness of the heavy Pullmans, and barked a staccato of short,
  angry demands that it had better get to business, now, or we'd be late again
  pulling into Washington. Ferdinand climbed down from the post, made a detour
  around the rear of the melon-patch, and entered the barn through the back
  door. The pony looked around over its shoulder, stopped munching its mouthful
  of hay, and blew a long breath that made its soft nostrils flutter.</p>

  <p>He advanced slowly and laid a hand on the pony's flank which twitched as
  if the light touch had tickled; moved forward another step and took a wisp of
  tawny mane in his fingers; was about to pat the friendly pet on the nose.</p>

  <p>On sudden impulse he drew back and muttered, "No&mdash;I tell
  you<i>&mdash;No!"</i></p>

  <p>Retracing his steps through the back door, half-blinded by tears, he stood
  for a long time gazing abstractedly into the muddy water of the miasmic,
  green-scummed little pond that belonged to Flook's Tile Factory; amblingly
  circled the barn, and moved toward his little workbench behind the
  woodhouse.</p>

  <p>He took the new knife from his pocket, turned it over several times,
  opened it, closed it with a sharp click; and, deliberately drawing his long
  arm back to full torsion, he sighted carefully&mdash;his lower lip pinioned
  by a row of uncommonly straight teeth&mdash;and threw the knife all of forty
  yards with such velocity and precision that it landed with a mighty splash
  exactly when he had intended.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand grinned. It was an ugly grin that did something to him on the
  inside&mdash;a brand-new sensation which defied his childish analysis, but
  seemed to be made up of such ingredients as, "Damn them all!"... "I haven't a
  friend left in the world!"... "I've got to go it alone!"... "I <i>can</i> go
  it alone!"... "I <i>will</i> go it alone!"... <i>"You see if I don't!... Damn
  you all!"</i></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FERDINAND arrived home at five, gaily whistling an
  improvised tune.</p>

  <p>He was in unusually high spirits today; for Miss Carle, who had
  specialized in Creative English at Wellesley, and was hopeful of teaching it
  in a college, some day, had detained him again after school to discuss his
  latest composition as seriously as if they were equals in age and
  experience.</p>

  <p>"But, Ferdinand," she had cautioned, "really, you're quite shockingly
  cynical, I'm afraid... for fifteen!"</p>

  <p>He would have liked to leave the question of his age standing just that
  way, but when she added, "You're not any older, are you?" he felt obliged to
  tell the truth.</p>

  <p>"I'll be fourteen next May."</p>

  <p>"My word!" ejaculated Miss Carle. "Owlish as Omar, when you ought to be
  out playing marbles."</p>

  <p>"I guess I grew pretty fast," Ferdinand admitted, shyly.</p>

  <p>"And pretty sour, too," laughed Miss Carle. "But you can write, young
  fellow! Just be a bit careful how you whirl that battle-axe! You might hurt
  somebody, and be sorry."</p>

  <p>It was evident, at home, that something important was afoot.</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha had crimped her hair and was tidying up the house. Apparently
  all the major feats of putting to rights had been attended to, for she was
  now at the final stage of patting the sofa pillows and rearranging the
  trinkets on the mantel&mdash;the shepherdess he had carved, a year ago, the
  china cat that someone had given to Angela when she was five, the oval slab
  of polished stone that Uncle Miles had picked up on a vagabondish trip long
  ago in the Petrified Forest. A fire had been neatly laid in the grate, though
  it was only the second of October and unseasonably warm.</p>

  <p>"Mr. and Mrs. Joel Day are coming to call, this evening," explained Aunt
  Martha, impressively. "Mind yuh don't leave yer things a-lyin' around."</p>

  <p>Angela, softly humming while she pressed the skirt of her blue dress on
  the ironing-board in the kitchen, broke off to say, as Ferdinand thrust a
  long slim hand into the cooky-jar, "Mustn't scatter crumbs. The Days are to
  be here, tonight."</p>

  <p>Upstairs, Uncle Miles was found straightening books on the shelves in his
  study. Ferdinand paused in the doorway, half-minded to tell him that Miss
  Carle had encouraged him about his writing. He was bursting to tell somebody.
  On second thought, he decided that Uncle Miles might think him boastful.</p>

  <p>A neat stack of opened letters lay on the corner of the desk, otherwise
  bare except for an engagement-pad which occupied a conspicuous position in
  the middle. The letters were making-believe they were the current mail of a
  busy man of affairs, the edge of an old telegram protruding slightly from
  midway of the deceitful pile.</p>

  <p>Doubtless Uncle Miles meant to slip up here with Mr. Day for a half-hour's
  confidential chat about church business while Aunt Martha, in the parlour
  below, endeavoured to infect Mrs. Day with a more passionate interest in the
  missionary box, the ultimate unpacking and distribution of which Ferdinand
  grimly hoped, would put somebody in Paouting-fu [<i>sic</i>] to at least half
  the bother that the recruiting of its miscellaneous contents had already cost
  him.</p>

  <p>He was seldom inquisitive about Uncle Miles's activities, but the
  engagement-pad caught his eye. He felt the makings of a grin at the corners
  of his mouth, and dealt with it severely.</p>

  <p>A mere glance at tomorrow's crowded programme should be sufficient to
  inform a sharp-eyed deacon that the new minister was not only industrious and
  popular, but was a person of orderly mind and much experience.</p>

  <p>"Don't disturb anything, Ferdinand," remarked Uncle Miles, importantly.
  "Mr. Day is coming out, after supper... and Mrs. Day ... to make us a little
  visit."</p>

  <p>Ferdinand said he wouldn't, and retreated to his own room at the end of
  the hall, grinning broadly.</p>

  <p>There were a great many things about his transparent Uncle
  Miles&mdash;affectations, pretensions, petty deceptions&mdash;which, while
  they had shocked and distressed him at ten, were only amusing, now. He had
  quite outgrown his earlier illusions about absolute integrity as an
  indispensable to anyone engaged in the spread of religion. His observations
  had led him to suspect that there was as much duplicity practised in Uncle
  Miles's profession as in any other business, the main difference between
  sacred and secular callings being that in the latter a man had at least a
  sporting chance of getting something out of it worth the time and
  trouble.</p>

  <p>Still&mdash;Ferdinand was obliged to admit&mdash;they had done very well,
  as ministers' families went. The three years on the rim of Fort Wayne had
  been good for them. Uncle Miles&mdash;what with Angela's undeniably valuable
  co-operation&mdash;had been very successful. The two of them had made
  themselves known soon after their arrival in the big town. Together they had
  put on noon meetings in the large railroad-shops, where Uncle Miles had
  invited soot-smeared mechanics, munching their apple pie, to remember the
  faith of their mothers&mdash;all of whom were presumed to be dead and in
  glory&mdash;and Angela, assured of manner and easy to look at, had sung
  mellow ballads in keeping with her father's exhortations, accompanying
  herself on a portable organ which she played so effortlessly that many of the
  younger workmen wondered if she were actually pumping the thing with her own
  feet; and, having man&oelig;uvred their position to the satisfaction of their
  curiosity on this point, had remained steadfastly regarding the robust girl's
  well-turned ankles with an admiration she did not appear to resent.</p>

  <p>After that, it had been easy to book engagements at Young People's social
  affairs in the down-town churches. At first Uncle Miles had imagined that his
  sentimental little talks, replete with touching anecdotes, were coming into
  demand; that Angela's contribution merely provided a unique embellishment to
  his addresses&mdash;a delusion he was gradually relieved of, however, as more
  and more invitations were extended to his gifted daughter alone. But, for all
  that, Uncle Miles had prospered beyond all reasonable expectations, and the
  call to the small church in Indianapolis had been no more appreciated than
  deserved.</p>

  <p>They were still poor; not so poor as they had been, back in Zanesdale, but
  required to practise rigid economies. Aunt Martha, to whom frugality was a
  virtue, if not indeed an obsession, had succeeded in making poverty a noble
  estate.</p>

  <p>For a long time they had been paying for a "little piece of real estate"
  in Keokuk, Iowa. It had never occurred to Ferdinand to inquire what the
  "little piece of real estate" consisted of, whether houses, lands, or
  business blocks. It had always been a "little piece of real estate," which
  although involving much correspondence and many receipts of long envelopes
  from Keokuk, could not amount to very much on their wages, even though they
  skimped valiantly to make the payments on it.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand made almost no demands upon the family purse, considering it no
  more than his share of the burden to wear the cheapest of
  clothes&mdash;though Aunt Martha didn't try to make them herself any
  more&mdash;and went about, uncomplainingly, with empty pockets. A stated
  allowance had never been thought of in their family. If Ferdinand wanted a
  five-cent pencil-tablet, he asked Uncle Miles for a nickel, please, to buy a
  pencil-tablet; and, to Uncle Miles's credit, the nickel was always
  forthcoming without argument or reluctance.</p>

  <p>Angela had not yet achieved her ambition to appear as the head-liner in a
  revival. Uncle Miles, finding it quite impossible to leave his local duties
  for so long a time, and unwilling that Angela should attempt so responsible
  an undertaking by herself, had put her off; though he kept saying, when she
  pressed him, that they would surely do it, one of these days; or, if they
  couldn't, he would see what might be arranged for her "next
  winter&mdash;perhaps."</p>

  <p>She had been growing almost rebelliously restless when the call to
  Indianapolis had eased the tension. She would be making new
  "contacts"&mdash;Uncle Miles's redundant use of this word "contact,"
  especially when he made a verb of it, always annoyed Ferdinand, who was
  unconsciously becoming something of a stylist&mdash;and doubtless
  "opportunities would develop" if Angela would only bide her time; as indeed
  they had, for it had been barely a month now since their coming to
  Indianapolis, and Angela had already been pleasantly spoken of in the
  newspapers three times (and unpleasantly spoken to in the High School
  Principal's office twice for her bland nonchalance in respect to Cæsar's
  Gallic Wars). It had not yet occurred to the Music Committee in Uncle Miles's
  church that Angela, who had quickly assumed the position of leading soprano
  in the choir, deserved a cash competence, for no such appropriation had ever
  been considered; but, on every hand&mdash;or at least almost every
  hand&mdash;one heard her appreciatively mentioned as having had much to do
  with the unprecedented attendance at church services.</p>

  <p>Women declared at the Aid Society that they never had any trouble, now,
  getting their menfolks out of bed on Sunday mornings.</p>

  <p>A few of the more conservative were for putting vestments on the choir,
  something they had never discussed before Angela joined it. One woman,
  convinced that the congregation, which was almost militantly non-conformist,
  would not consent to gowns on the choir, wondered&mdash;though it took a good
  deal of courage to say it, even in the privacy of a group of
  three&mdash;whether it might not be tactfully suggested to Mrs. Brumm that
  Angela was really a bigger girl than she thought; to which another woman,
  equally moved to candour, replied, "No&mdash;we mustn't do that. It would do
  no good, anyway. Angela is just one of those people who, no matter how much
  they have on, always look as if they'd left something off."</p>

  <p>As for Ferdinand's attitude toward his uncle's bustling ministry, and the
  luxuriant Angela's aspirations, it stopped with merely wishing them well.
  Aunt Martha had long since discontinued her direct appeals to him to prepare
  himself vocationally to follow in his uncle's footsteps; and Uncle Miles, who
  had frequently besought the Lord, at family worship, to lead "this lad into
  the ministry of the gospel"&mdash;mostly to please Aunt Martha, Ferdinand
  always thought&mdash;had lately omitted this supplication from his invoice of
  the family's wants.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was no use pretending he had no interest in what went on
  at their church, for Uncle Miles's profession was singular in that neither he
  nor his household was ever for a moment free of it. The church was all they
  lived for. It was at once the hub and the rim, the corona and the periphery
  of their thoughts and conversation. Such friendships as they had, if not
  actually originating at the church, eventually brought up
  there&mdash;tentative, temporary, shallow-rooted friendships, for at any
  minute they might pack up and move elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Three years had made structural changes in Ferdinand. They had spread some
  substantial and nicely distributed flesh on his gangling frame, the
  additional weight seeming to have given him more self-confidence. He was
  still rather shy, but had almost outgrown his earlier tendency to a morbid
  self-dissatisfaction which, at ten, had made him painfully sensitive, touchy,
  and inclined to mope.</p>

  <p>It had been a long time, now, since he had participated in a family scene,
  contenting himself&mdash;when they glanced apprehensively in his direction on
  occasions brimming with the raw materials of argument&mdash;to draw a twisted
  smile, which, although he had never seen it, he suspected of being somewhat
  unpleasant. Situations that had once fetched out of him a squeaky and savage
  indignation, popping off to the ruination of a meal, and hurling him out of
  the room, and tossing him on to his bed where he would lie for hours hating
  all visible creation, including himself, were now handled with an
  indifference so closely akin to contempt that the family sometimes wished he
  had not tied down the safety-valve.</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha, particularly, viewed this change in Ferdinand with prayerful
  anxiety. Much as she had deplored the lad's occasional releases of volcanic
  protest&mdash;mostly protests against the quite irksome and unquestionably
  silly inhibitions which she herself laid upon him; for she insisted that at
  ten he should carry himself like an experienced saint of seventy, while she
  rigged him in babyish sailor-collars and fussy girlish waists not worn by any
  child over five, a manner of dress that promoted his misfortune in being
  oversized to a farce so ludicrous that even he, murderously angry as he was,
  sometimes laughed himself into wild hysteria over his own appearance in the
  mirror, a storm usually followed by a fit of rebellious weeping&mdash;he
  often wondered if Aunt Martha did not secretly enjoy such emotional
  hurricanes.</p>

  <p>On several memorable occasions she had knelt, with Ferdinand sourly
  crouched beside her (venomously despising them both), and prayed
  aloud&mdash;her wailing petitions punctuated with convulsive sobs&mdash;that
  "this wayward orphan, whom Thou in Thine Infinite Wisdom, hast entrusted into
  our care and keeping, may be just brought under the influence of Thy Blessed
  Spirit."</p>

  <p>All that was over, now. Aunt Martha had herself under much better control.
  Whether the benign rainbow that arched her had arrived to signal the biologic
  fact that she had graduated from her rip-roaring middle forties, or whether
  the promotion from a bucolic atmosphere of country-village piety into the
  relative sophistication of bigger towns and associated with "city folks" had
  pushed in a few of the shriller stops in her turbulent spirit, Ferdinand did
  not know.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was these early experiences of the utter breakdown of emotional
  discipline that had produced in Ferdinand a mounting contempt for home
  theatricals. Unquestionably, these unbridled seizures of Aunt Martha's had
  been bad for him. They had made him despise any sentiment that threatened to
  invoke tears. He had wept himself out in early childhood.</p>

  <p>At thirteen, plus, these deep lesions had healed, but not without leaving
  some impermeable scars on the lamina of young Ferdinand's soul at the very
  points of exposure most frequently bombarded in a home where prayer and
  piety, sentiment and emotion, were all in the day's work.</p>

  <p>Adversions and appeals to Deity were, in Ferdinand's opinion, merely an
  unscrupulous and unsportsmanly method of having your own way in dealing with
  people who might be so weak-minded as to believe that you and God were at one
  as to the soundness of your cause. If you couldn't get what you wanted out of
  the other fellow by wheedle and whimper, purchase or threat, vituperation or
  violence, you bade him listen while you took it up with the Lord in prayer.
  You closed your eyes, and, in the lugubrious tone of one making funeral
  arrangements over the telephone, prosecuted your case while your helpless
  victim knelt beside you hotly wanting the courage to say, "Either you're a
  fraud, or your God is a rascal!"</p>

  <p>Ferdinand no longer took any stock whatever in prayer&mdash;either in the
  family worship kind of prayer that besought the Almighty to make you
  sweet-spirited and obedient to His Holy Will, five minutes after you had
  stubbornly objected, at breakfast on Saturday, to spending the whole
  afternoon helping old Mullins clean out the church furnace, when you had been
  looking forward all week to a bit of carving on the fire-screen you meant to
  give Miss Carle on Christmas; or in the public kind of prayer that asked God
  to touch the generous hearts of this dear people (Gosh! how he loathed those
  smug antiques that stood in prim rows in Uncle Miles's prayers!)... and
  incline them to give sacrificially to some pet scheme they were being
  badgered into against their wishes.</p>

  <p>He had been trying lately not to think about it at all; saying to himself
  that in any other environment than his the whole matter of religion in
  general and the activities of the church in particular would be giving him no
  concern.</p>

  <p>Until recently, he had suffered frequent torments, as he watched his
  feverish disdain burning out to smoking cinders. Could it be that he had
  "quenched the Spirit"? Uncle Miles was forever warning his flock against the
  cold apathy that meant one had committed the "unpardonable sin." These past
  few weeks, he had almost left off torturing himself with these morbid
  reflections. The "unpardonable sin" was just so much more nonsense&mdash;all
  of a piece with everything else they ranted about and wept over and
  grudgingly subscribed to.... A lot o' bunk!... Tripe!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Ferdinand tossed his books on the bed and clatteringly
  rummaged in the disordered lower drawer of his battered, secondhand,
  taffy-coloured desk for a shoe-brush and the box of blacking. He, too, would
  be expected to help entertain these precious Days whose threat of a visit had
  set them all scouring and preening.</p>

  <p>Poising one foot on the edge of the untidy drawer, Ferdinand grimacingly
  recruited a mouthful of lubricant and spat viciously into the noisomely
  pungent blacking-box. He, too, would be required to come down, with his hair
  reached high to show he had an intellectual forehead, and smirk for this rich
  and brittle Mr. Day, who, because his deceased father had organized Uncle
  Miles's church and paid for most of it, was in a position to make them all
  jump through the hoop&mdash;and like it.</p>

  <p>He would have to sit there for an hour and a half, posing for an angel;
  just as if he gave a damn whether these wonderful Days liked him or not. He
  smeared the dauber side of the brush into the blacking, and anointed the toe
  of his shabby shoe.</p>

  <p>Angela, of course, would sing for them in her most luscious manner. If the
  guests didn't ask her promptly, Aunt Martha would direct the conversation
  into that quarter. "Yes&mdash;Angela has been a great help," she would say,
  in her precise, company voice, "what with her singin' 'n' all."</p>

  <p>"Won't you sing something for us now, dear?"&mdash;this Mrs. Day would
  beg, probably hoping she wouldn't. But you could count on Angela... .
  Well&mdash;so much the better. While that was going on, he wouldn't have to
  do anything.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand banged and bumped and smeared the shoe-brush against the
  desk-drawer as he insured himself against being sent back to "polish the heel
  as well as the toe"&mdash;meanwhile carrying on with his sour prognosis of
  the evening's entertainment.</p>

  <p>Angela, having more than satisfied the customers with her recital, closing
  it with an extended rendition of "Crossing the Bar," would smile, fold the
  music, push in the organ-stops, and slowly revolve on the hair-cloth stool to
  receive the inevitable "My!&mdash;ain't that grand?"</p>

  <p>And then this Mrs. Day&mdash;a feathery, fussy old dame, no
  doubt&mdash;would turn to him.... Ferdinand raised his other foot to the
  ledge of the drawer and again paid his respects to the vile blacking-box....
  Ducking her big-plumed head, coquettishly, and grinning as if she were
  peering under the hood of a perambulator, she would inquire, "And what do
  <i>you</i> do, Master Ferdinand?"</p>

  <p>That's what she would say, and the way she would say it. He had never seen
  her, but he knew. He had seen Mr. Day. Mr. Day had met them at the train.
  Uncle Miles had known he would, for he had written promising to do so. And
  there he was, sure enough, standing on the platform where the day-coach
  passengers alighted. Mr. Day had known they would be riding in the day-coach,
  though he himself wouldn't, of course.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand had had no difficulty picking him out of the crowd on the
  platform&mdash;a square man, with square shoulders, square hands, square
  feet, square head, square mouth. He was to be their boss, because he had lots
  of money. Mr. Day had shaken hands all round and led the way to a shiny new
  Cadillac. Ferdinand hadn't liked the back of Mr. Day's square head or his
  square knuckles on the steering-wheel, though he was bound to admit that Mr.
  Day inspired respect. Mr. Day owned them now, same as he owned his Cadillac.
  Uncle Miles sitting beside him, with his arm stretched along the top of the
  seat, as if he were getting ready to hug Mr. Day, was already saying, "Yes,
  yes; to be sure, Brother Day: ab-so-<i>lute-</i>ly!"</p>

  <p>Ferdinand transferred his suspenders to his Sunday pants and emptied his
  pockets on top of the desk.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you sing, too," Mrs. Day would suggest, "like your sister." And
  then Aunt Martha would heave the long sigh that meant she was going to
  explain how Angela wasn't his sister, a story that Angela would interrupt
  presently to reply to Mrs. Day's query.</p>

  <p>"Ferdinand whittles," she would say, crossing swiftly to the mantel for
  the little shepherdess. And Mrs. Day would gurgle, "You don't mean to tell
  me! Look, Mr. Day, at this perfectly ex<i>quis</i>ite, piece of carving!" And
  Mr. Day, deliberately finishing the long sentence he was on, and steadfastly
  looking at Uncle Miles from under his square eyebrows&mdash;just to show he
  was the kind of a man who mustn't be interrupted&mdash;but reaching out his
  square hand to signify that he would be pleased to take up Mrs. Day's case as
  the next order of business, would presently pinch his glasses on to his
  square nose, owlishly inspect the shepherdess, and say, as he handed it back,
  "Nicely done, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>Ferdinand was tumbling the contents of the top bureau-drawer, looking for
  a clean collar that had no frayed edges.</p>

  <p>"He prints, too," Aunt Martha would add, proudly, though she was forever
  chiding him for wasting his time with all that type-settin'. Before she and
  Angela went through with it, he would be sent upstairs for "that meenoo and
  programme" he had made for the Annual Canvass Dinner at Fort Wayne, last
  winter. And Mrs. Day would squint at it, and twist in her chair to get a
  better light on it, and borrow Mr. Day's glasses; and Mr. Day would suggest
  that Ferdinand might do a lot of the church printing, "just for good
  practice!"... Gosh!&mdash;how he hated these hellish exhibitions!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Ferdinand put his Harvey's Grammar face down on the desk and
  listened for the doorbell. It would soon ring, now, for he had heard the
  car-doors slam, opulently. It rang, sharply, as if Mr. Day were saying,
  "Don't keep us waiting! I paid for most of this house, myself!"... and Uncle
  Miles was opening the door, his hearty "Well&mdash;well!" meaning, "I know
  you did, Brother Day, and I came running fast as ever I
  could&mdash;ab-so<i>-lute-</i>ly!"</p>

  <p>They were all talking at once, now, and drifting through the hall into the
  parlour. Mr. Day was remarking dryly that the floors needed to be gone over,
  and Mrs. Day&mdash;who sounded quite elderly&mdash;was asking Aunt Martha, in
  a high key, how she was finding the house, anyway.</p>

  <p>Presently, Angela came to the foot of the stairs and called him. He would
  have to go. He gave his hair a final scrub with the brush, scowled into the
  mirror, and started. Hopeful of slipping into the room so quietly they would
  hardly notice his arrival, Ferdinand made as little noise as possible on the
  way down.</p>

  <p>Slowly negotiating the last few steps, he was able, by the location of
  their voices, and a panoramic glimpse through the wide doorway, to place
  their positions&mdash;Aunt Martha, first; then Mrs. Day, a white-haired,
  little old lady, old enough to be Mr. Day's mother (as indeed she was, he
  soon discovered); then Mr. Day, on the brussels sofa, polishing his glasses
  with a large silk handkerchief, Uncle Miles sitting close beside him with a
  hand on Mr. Day's knee.</p>

  <p>Another step located Angela, close to the melodeon, of course, talking
  animatedly, and, for her, rather affectedly, to some unidentified person not
  yet in the picture.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand cautiously moved forward and brought gradually into view a slim,
  modishly shod foot and a generous glimpse of the first silk stockings he had
  ever seen, a pair of gracefully crossed, tailored knees, a shapely arm
  negligently thrown back across the top of the chair&mdash;it was a
  dining-room chair, put there for him, and she had evidently preferred it to
  the patent rocker which stood vacant&mdash;her fur boa tossed back from her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>Nobody like that had ever been in their house before. Ferdinand hadn't yet
  seen her face&mdash;it would require some courage to do this next
  step&mdash;but he knew she did not belong to their world, at all. Something
  in her posture told him that.</p>

  <p>"Come on in, Ferdinand," called Angela, pleasantly, in the tone of thirty
  addressing six, which made him know the stylish stranger could not be very
  old, if Angela was playing grownup.</p>

  <p>Summoning all his valour, Ferdinand stepped to the door and found himself
  staring&mdash;open-mouthed, he feared&mdash;at the most beautiful woman he
  had ever seen. She smiled, a slowly widening smile, which seemed to mean they
  were already friends of long standing, bending her head forward and looking
  at him from under long black lashes, her lips puckered a little, teasingly,
  as if to say, "I know you don't want to come in here and be bored;
  but&mdash;let's have it over."</p>

  <p>Ferdinand's heart skipped a beat, and then made up for it with a hard bump
  that put him quite out of breath and made his voice unsteady when,
  reluctantly detained by Aunt Martha's hand on his arm, he paused to speak to
  Madam Day and Mr. Day, who obligingly made short work of him to resume their
  briefly interrupted remarks. All the previously inactive minerals in
  Ferdinand's blood responded to the first potential magnet he had ever
  approached, his natural shyness giving way to a new sensation of actually
  belonging to someone!</p>

  <p>She did not rise or offer her hand when Angela said, "This is Ferdinand,
  Mrs. Day." People, when introduced, always stood up and gravely shook hands.
  Eighty rose to shake hands with eight. Mrs. Day merely tipped back her pretty
  head, so he could see the fringe of glossy little black curls under her big
  picture hat, and smiled, with red lips parted.</p>

  <p>He could not speak for an instant. The routine phrase,
  "Pleased-t'-meetcha," which he had been obliged to mumble so often that it
  was all one word, would not come. It was inappropriate. He swallowed, rather
  noisily, and said, "I'm glad&mdash;I'm glad to&mdash;I'm very glad!"</p>

  <p>"By Jove, boy," she drawled, "I really believe you <i>are!"</i> She
  pointed to the vacant chair beside her. "Do you always say such delightfully
  nice things?"</p>

  <p>Angela, hopeful of smoothing over his unsuccessful attempt to manage the
  usual formula, explained maternally: "Ferdinand is so shy, Mrs. Day. He
  always hates being introduced.... You can sit in the rocker, Ferdinand. Mrs.
  Day thought she would like this straight chair better."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ferdinand, still in a trance, "she would."</p>

  <p>He sat down, and while wondering if it would be all right for him to look
  her straight in the eyes again&mdash;wanting to, but afraid he would stare at
  her&mdash;he gazed interestedly at her hands, wishing she did not have gloves
  on. She leisurely unbuttoned them and began slowly to take them off, tugging
  at one finger-tip after another. He glanced up, a bit abashed, and they both
  smiled, understandingly.</p>

  <p>"I'm always wondering about hands, too," she said, lazily. "Your sister
  has been telling me what interesting things you do with yours; but I think I
  could have guessed&mdash;now that I see them."</p>

  <p>Ferdinand instinctively spread them out, glad now that he had taken pains
  with his nails.</p>

  <p>"You make things, too," he ventured. "Maybe you paint."</p>

  <p>"Rather badly. I've been having better luck, lately, dabbling with
  wood-cuts. That's great fun!"</p>

  <p>"I expect you have lots of carving-tools."</p>

  <p>"Too many! I keep experimenting with all these different-shaped chisels,
  and never use any one of them long enough to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hard wood?" queried Ferdinand, professionally.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, no; not yet! I've just begun it, you see."</p>

  <p>"I have tinkered with some little designs," confessed Ferdinand, modestly,
  "but I don't know what they look like."</p>

  <p>Angela, recovering from her amazement over the taciturn Ferdinand's easy
  talk, put in, "He hasn't a press, Mrs. Day&mdash;nor hardly anything to work
  with."</p>

  <p>"Pine?" asked Mrs. Day, having briefly turned her head to acknowledge
  Angela's comment.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;oak and walnut."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Day's finely modelled eyebrows lifted a little in surprise.</p>

  <p>"How would you like to come over, some day, and see what I have been
  doing? Perhaps I might trade you a reamer or two for some good advice."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to!" Ferdinand flushed with pleasure. "But I don't think I could
  tell you anything that you don't know."</p>

  <p>"Saturday&mdash;maybe?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;after dinner?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'm to be out for dinner. Come about two."</p>

  <p>She belonged, Ferdinand realized, to a different world from his drab
  little island where the conversation never rose above the dull tittle-tattle
  of domestic drudgeries in homes like theirs, and the equally stupid prattle
  about rummage sales that were to finance a new cement sidewalk around the
  church and mend the plumbing in the basement. Hers was a world that had
  dinner at night instead of noon, an unselfconscious world that spoke
  correctly without stiffness, that moved with dignity but without
  embarrassment, a world that leisurely went out to the diner for "tea." The
  difference between her world and his swept over Ferdinand, not to his
  discontentment, but to his almost painful wistfulness. He felt that she had
  recognized him as eligible to citizenship in her world, and was glad.</p>

  <p>"That's agreed, then. I'll expect you," she said, rising as Aunt
  Martha&mdash;still talking primly to Madam Day, and nervously smoothing her
  shapeless black skirt&mdash;moved toward them, apparently intending to draw
  Mrs. Day, whom for excellent reasons she was obviously shy of, into the adult
  section. "Your father can tell you where we live," concluded Mrs. Day, with
  another smile that sent Ferdinand's damaged heart racing.</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha's curiosity spoke in her strained face. Aunt Martha's face was
  never under good control. Bulletins announcing her every doubt, anxiety,
  hope, and fear were posted about her restless mouth and myopic eyes
  immediately upon arrival. At the moment, Ferdinand knew what was going on in
  her mind as certainly as if she shouted it. She was engaged in a struggle,
  attempting to be obsequiously courteous to Mrs. Day because it was incumbent
  on her to be deferential to Brother Day's Mrs. Day, while endeavouring to
  warn Ferdinand&mdash;with one fleeting glare of stern disapproval&mdash;that
  he was on no account to be permitted to come under the influence of this
  frivolous, worldly creature whom Brother Day&mdash;so steady and sensible
  about everything else&mdash;had had the misfortune to marry.</p>

  <p>Conversation broke off, in the other corner of the room, in acknowledgment
  of Mrs. Day's arrival in their midst. Brother Day stiffly stood at attention,
  tapping his nose-glasses on his thumb-nail. Uncle Miles tardily scrambled to
  his feet, pulled down his vest, and said, "Well&mdash;well!" just as if Mrs.
  Day had quite taken them by surprise, dropping in unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>Madam Day snapped the massive silver latch of her black leather bag
  several times, and pursed her lips resignedly.</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha proffered her chair and drew up another. They were all ready
  now, it appeared, for Mrs. Day to explain why she had intruded.</p>

  <p>"Ferdinand has promised to come and see me," she said, in a tone that
  hoped she was giving his parents pleasure&mdash;"to talk about
  wood-cuts."</p>

  <p>"Very good of you, Sister&mdash;er&mdash;Mrs. Day," beamed Uncle Miles, in
  the voice he used when patronizingly commending a shy testimony offered at
  prayer-meeting.</p>

  <p>Mr. Day elevated his chin, stroked the back of his bald head, gazed
  critically at the ceiling, and tapped his lean knee with his glasses. There
  was the suggestion of a frown creasing his forehead. Ferdinand wondered if
  the frown did not mean that Mrs. Day should first have consulted Mr. Day
  before making her proposal.</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;said he, judicially&mdash;"perhaps the lad had better be
  encouraged to do something more useful than fiddling with wood-cuts."</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha, cannily reasoning that, while Brother Day might enjoy handing
  his wife a surly rebuff, he probably wouldn't thank anybody for being so
  impertinent as to applaud him, remarked: "Ferdinand comes natural by his
  taste fer wood-carvin'. His grandpa's folks in th' old country was all
  wood-carvers. When he come t' this country, he changed the name to Miller
  because his family name was hard fer folks t' say. Their name was
  Mueller&mdash;M-u-e-l-l-e-r."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if they were related to the very famous family of Muellers in
  Dresden. Do you know, Mrs. Brumm?"</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha, hugging her angular elbows and rocking gently, nodded with
  pride.</p>

  <p>"My father was born in Dresden in the house of Frederick Mueller. He was
  the great-grandson of Hans Mueller."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. Day. "What a heritage!"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es," agreed Mr. Day. "Very interesting."</p>

  <p>Angela had slipped over on to the chair recently vacated by the charming
  Mrs. Day.</p>

  <p>"Awfully odd, isn't she?" whispered Angela.</p>

  <p>"Hunnh?"</p>

  <p>Ferdinand was barely conscious of her comment, so intent was he on the
  developments in his own case, now under discussion on the other side of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Odd!" repeated Angela, guardedly, behind her hand.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand reluctantly detached his gaze from the object of his adoration,
  and regarded Angela with an inquisitive stare.</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;odd?" he said, absently. "I think she's the most
  wonderful person I ever saw!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"LOOK, Janet!" Ferdinand laid the limp proof on the
  imposing-stone, folded his smudged arms, and glanced over his shoulder for
  her approval. "Rather good, wouldn't you say? How fortunate we could use one
  of those quaint, diamond-shaped colons on the very first page."</p>

  <p>"Perfect!" Janet Day hovered close, snuggling a hand affectionately under
  his elbow, her cheek pressed lightly against his broad shoulder. "Old Thomas
  Caxton would be green with envy. Really, Dinny, you're marvellous!"</p>

  <p>"It's you that's marvellous, Janet. I would never have known anything
  about this, but for you."</p>

  <p>For a moment she neither responded nor turned away; stood soberly staring
  at the first page of what was going to be General Bryce's annual Memorial Day
  greeting to the diminishing survivors of his brigade&mdash;a sixteen-page
  brochure done in two colours on hand-laid Italian vellum, the price no
  object, for the General was rich. It was the most pretentious thing they had
  attempted.</p>

  <p>Janet had been very quiet and pensive today. Twice, as they had
  encountered each other, face to face, in the narrow quarters of the little
  printing-shop that cluttered the whole south bay of her attic
  studio&mdash;screened off to segregate its inevitable
  untidiness&mdash;Ferdinand had been made uneasy by the entreaty in her brown
  eyes. Janet wanted to ask him something, and didn't dare. Janet wanted to
  tell him something, but was afraid. Had he done something to grieve her? What
  could it have been? He had failed her somehow: in what? But no&mdash;it was
  rather as if she, herself, was on the defensive.</p>

  <p>Her competent fingers tightened their warm grasp on his arm. Perhaps she
  was going to talk about it now.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, preoccupiedly, "you would have done all this, anyway,
  sooner or later. However, I'm glad I have had a little part in it.... I want
  you always to think well of me, Dinny. You've been such a dear, and I'm so
  proud of you."</p>

  <p>Impulsively he lifted her hand to his lips, an act that surprised them
  both, a little. Ferdinand despised sentiment.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Janet?" he asked, gently. "Something bothering you?"</p>

  <p>"Now you've ink on your nose, Dinny," she laughed, a bit nervously, he
  thought. "No&mdash;it's nothing. Just moody, because it's raining and dark. I
  didn't intend it should rain, today."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;if you're sure that's all. I was afraid you were unhappy. I
  didn't do anything, did I, Janet?"</p>

  <p>Shaking off her dolorous mood, and facing him with a twisted little smile,
  Janet slipped her palms slowly upward on his well-muscled arms, grasped his
  ear-lobes in her slim fingers, made a gesture of chastising him, and
  murmured, "Of course not, simpleton."</p>

  <p>He had called her "Janet" from the first; ever since that enchanted
  Saturday, now more than three and a half years ago, when, shy and excited, he
  had followed the solemn butler over the deep-pile Oriental rugs from the
  impressive front entrance to the broad, winding stairs, and along a narrower
  corridor to narrower stairs leading into the huge attic room.</p>

  <p>"Master Brumm, ma'am," the man had said, leaving them.</p>

  <p>Under a large north skylight, young Mrs. Day&mdash;who had not been absent
  from Ferdinand's thoughts, waking or sleeping, since the night he had met
  her&mdash;sat on a tall three-legged stool before a composing-case,
  distributing type, her high heels hooked on a rung. Her heavy black hair was
  braided in one long plait. She wore a short skirt, and a long, green,
  open-throated jacket with capacious pockets, the costume diminishing her age
  and urbanity until she was quite another person than the queenly Mrs. Day
  whose black voile nearly touched the floor, whose white lace yoke had brought
  up in a tight, ribbed collar that almost reached to her dainty ears, her slim
  height emphasized by the big black hat with the orange velvet tips, on the
  night she had made their house, and all the people in it, outmoded and
  shabby.</p>

  <p>Except for the slow, half-teasing, puckery smile with which she turned to
  welcome him, this girlish Mrs. Day might have been someone else than the
  mysterious goddess who had been playing the deuce with his imagination and
  staling his appetite for dinner.</p>

  <p>Slipping down from her high stool, she had thrust her hands deep into the
  pockets of her smock, her head tilted as if in critical judgment of a
  picture.</p>

  <p>"You seem ever so much bigger, taller," she said. "How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"It's this collar, I think," Ferdinand had replied, soberly. "Going on
  fourteen.... Aunt Martha would have me wear it."</p>

  <p>"Who's Aunt Martha? Does she live with you?"</p>

  <p>"But you met Aunt Martha. Mrs. Brumm is not my mother."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Day's shapely arm was thrown up suddenly in a gesture of happy
  discovery emphasized by a vigorous snap of the fingers, her face alight.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" she shouted. "So&mdash;that's the answer to the riddle!"</p>

  <p>"My mother died when I was born," explained Ferdinand.</p>

  <p>"And your father&mdash;what became of him?"</p>

  <p>Ferdinand was very sorry that the subject had arisen. He had come, eager
  and inquisitive, hoping to see Mrs. Day's wood-working equipment; and here we
  were, wasting precious time.</p>

  <p>"He's living... out West... I never saw him.... You're putting the type
  back in their boxes; aren't you?" Ferdinand drew nearer the case. "May I
  watch you do it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;we're going to talk about wood-cuts," said Mrs. Day. "But,
  first, sit down. Tell me some more about yourself."</p>

  <p>"There isn't much," he replied, gloomily; but he took the big club chair
  she pointed to, and began to tell her what little he knew. Seated on a low
  ottoman at his feet, she listened intently, asking brief questions when he
  paused. There was, after all, a good deal of the story. It was a whole hour
  before Mrs. Day seemed satisfied, and they sat silently.</p>

  <p>"I think you should have kept the pony," she said, after a long pause.
  "That must have hurt him, dreadfully.... And you never wrote to him?"</p>

  <p>Ferdinand drew a long sigh, with a convulsive catch in the middle of it,
  and abstractedly twisted Mrs. Day's soggy little handkerchief into a slim
  rope. Her understanding sympathy and affection had loosed a long-pent flood
  of suppressed misery. He smiled, feebly.</p>

  <p>"That's the first time anybody ever defended my father," said Ferdinand.
  "Why should I have written to him? He never wrote to me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Day rose, and, walking slowly to the dormer window, stood looking
  down at the busy street.</p>

  <p>"I'm guessing that there's some more of that story... that you never
  heard," she said, impressively.</p>

  <p>Then there had been some hot chocolate and cakes, and Ferdinand became
  quickly absorbed in Mrs. Day's explanation of the new printing-press which
  her good friend, Mr. Oscar Zimmerman, had lent her. Mr. Zimmerman had made
  quite a hobby of art-craft printing; had done some beautiful things; now he
  had tired of it; had sent her his entire equipment for use while he was
  abroad.</p>

  <p>"He will be so interested in you, Ferdinand. I wrote him you were a
  Mueller descendant, and that I intended you should have a go at these
  things&mdash;wood-cuts, art printing, etchings."</p>

  <p>They became very well acquainted, that day. Ferdinand's name was too bulky
  and mature, and was abbreviated to "Dinny," which seemed to make him rather
  light-hearted, as if his name had weighted him.</p>

  <p>"You may call me Janet, if you like," she had suggested. "If we're going
  to play together with these things, you'll probably be teaching me, very
  soon, and I mustn't be much older than my teacher, you see, or it might
  discourage me."</p>

  <p>"I never knew anyone named Janet, before," said Ferdinand. "I'm glad."</p>

  <p>"Dinny, you say the most adorable things... and all unconsciously, too.
  That's the best part of it. You're developing into a young courtier; I can
  see that."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Ferdinand was also developing into a young liar, he feared,
  after he had answered all of Aunt Martha's pressing questions relative to
  that first visit with the problematical Mrs. Day. Naturally disposed to be
  suspicious of well-groomed femininity, Aunt Martha was troubled. Ferdinand
  was required to reproduce the afternoon, item by item. How was Mrs. Day
  dressed? Was Mr. Day at home? Was Madam Day present? What did she have to
  say? What all happened?</p>

  <p>Ferdinand promoted himself, that evening, from the mere happy estate of
  apprentice to a beautiful craftswoman. He achieved the dignity of a great
  story-teller. Baron Munchausen would have been proud of him. Amazing himself
  by the increasing glibness of his tale, he invented a conversation he had had
  with Mrs. Day that represented her as most ardently concerned about the
  welfare of the church, albeit she never attended, due to a slight heart
  affection which made it dangerous for her to expose herself to strong
  emotional appeals; garbed her in a sombre dress, laid a grey shawl about her
  shoulders, had the audacity to put her hair up in curl-papers; located her
  workroom in the busiest part of the great house; caused servants to stand by
  her, handing her the things she needed in her work&mdash;and wound up with an
  account of his hostess's admiration for Aunt Martha and Uncle Miles and
  Angela.... Fearing he had been extravagant in this, Ferdinand decided to risk
  nothing further and excused himself on the pretence of having to study.</p>

  <p>But Aunt Martha was never quite at ease with Ferdinand's two and three
  afternoons a week&mdash;and all day Saturdays&mdash;with Mrs. Day.</p>

  <p>"I never did like the looks o' that woman," she would say, anxiously, to
  Mr. Brumm. "You wait!... We'll see!"</p>

  <p>And when, at length, having waited, they saw, she muttered, grimly pleased
  that her forecast had been so prescient, "Didn't I tell yuh? Didn't I warn
  yuh? Where were yer eyes?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Dinny carefully unwound the inky string from the type-form
  and went about the extraction of an upper-case H that seemed a bit
  defective.</p>

  <p>"Rather rubbishy sentiment; wouldn't you say?" he called across to Janet,
  bent over a wood-cut with a big reading-glass in one hand and a slim reamer
  in the other, putting stripes in a wind-blown flag.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know," she replied, as from a considerable distance.
  "It's about what one would expect, isn't it, from a mellow old gentleman,
  trying to be lyrical about war; trying to remember and forget at the same
  time, like the proud but poor old lady in London who went out to sell papers,
  mumbling, 'Times, tuppence! Times, tuppence! Lord, I hopes nobuddy 'ears
  me!'... And no one will actually read this, anyway, you know. They'll be
  saying, 'What a <i>lovely</i> piece of printing! Whoever did it? And
  especially these bee-ootiful ornamental capitals, and this incomparable
  tail-piece! Just look at that <i>flag!'...</i> That's what they will be
  saying, Dinny."</p>

  <p>"That's rather cynical... for you, Janet," laughed Dinny. "I'm always the
  one that's scolded for being more concerned over the way things look than
  what they mean. You must be deteriorating."</p>

  <p>He ran the sticky, snapping, black brayer over the face of his corrected
  galley, and began pounding another proof-page on to it with a plane.</p>

  <p>"I think words get their definitions, not from the dictionary, but from
  the private sentiments of the people who use them," continued Dinny,
  philosophically. "Take the General's word 'misunderstandings.' That's what
  caused the war&mdash;'misunderstandings.' Fact is, they all understood one
  another too well. People are forever calling their quarrels
  'misunderstandings.' Nonsense! So long as they were misunderstanding, each
  one could give the other credit for a bit of ignorant honesty. But when they
  begin to understand each other, they call out the troops and distribute the
  gunpowder."</p>

  <p>"You amuse me, Dinny," drawled Janet, intent on her occupation. "You would
  never have thought about that, at all, if you hadn't been annoyed because
  'misunderstandings' is too long to look well in a line of twelve-point Caslon
  set to fourteen ems. It's just when they begin to inconvenience us that we
  find fault with words and have hot debates over them. We think up shorter
  synonyms that look better on whatever page we're making up, and then imagine
  we've discovered a new idea, or expressed a pleasanter thought. If
  'licentiousness' is too unwieldy, we change it to 'liberty.'"</p>

  <p>"'Parsimoniousness' <i>is</i> easier to set, if you call it 'thrift,'"
  agreed Dinny, willing to go on with the game, but a bit bewildered over
  Janet's choice of an illustration.</p>

  <p>"It all depends upon who's talking," she added, absently, "and when.
  'Liberty' is a pretty word, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I should think these old soldiers," pursued Dinny, didactically, "would
  never want to hear another word about war. It must give them the
  heebie-jeebies in the night. I saw a team of farm-horses run off with a
  mowing-machine, when I was a little boy. The man fell off the iron seat, and
  got tangled in the knives. The scared horses turned short when they came to a
  fence-corner and had their hind legs nearly chewed off, not having sense
  enough to stop. I see it yet, sometimes, when I'm slow going to sleep. It's
  the most reliable of all my pet horrors. Wouldn't you think these old
  veterans would be just as happy not to be reminded of screaming horses with
  eyes dangling on a string, dragging their insides after them in long muddy
  ropes; and neighbour boys with the white splintered ends of bones sticking
  through their bloody pant-legs, and sticky globs of warm brains&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I say! Dinny! Stop it! What a ghastly imagination!"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to fetch it to market, one o' these days."</p>

  <p>"Going to be a butcher?"</p>

  <p>"Going to write a book... called 'Balderdash.' Chapter
  one&mdash;patriotism; two&mdash;religion; three&mdash;I haven't quite decided
  on three yet, but it's to be something about the superstition that people
  with money have a right to play wheel-barrow with everybody who works for
  them or lives with them. Ever play wheel-barrow, Janet?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so. How do you play it?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you get down on the floor, on your hands, and I pick you up by
  the feet and push, and you either have to walk on your hands or bump your
  nose."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I've been playing that, all my life. Nice game!"</p>

  <p>For a little while, Dinny rattled on with his sour diatribe against war,
  Janet remotely keeping track of his excursion.</p>

  <p>It hadn't been quite true that she'd always been playing wheel-barrow.
  Father&mdash;God bless him&mdash;had been infinitely tender and considerate.
  How he had humoured her every wish&mdash;hers and her mother's. Maybe that
  was why he could leave so little when he died; almost nothing, indeed, but
  extravagant tastes. She could have seen it through; but not her mother. Mr.
  Day had proposed such an easy solution. "You'd be a fool, Janet," her mother
  had said. "It's a chance in a lifetime." What a pity her mother had died,
  seeing the sacrifice had been made to please her.</p>

  <p>"All this sweet hokum of the General's about 'shot-and-shell,'" Dinny was
  declaiming. "He's singing hymns about the varnished shot-and-shell piled in
  pyramids at the foot of the Soldiers' Monument. If he really wants to give
  the old fellows a thrill, why doesn't he remind them of the slippery
  shot-and-shell&mdash;all ooky and slimy with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I heard you, Dinny, the first time!... Hand me that slide-rule, will you,
  dear?... But, you see, that's the way to keep patriotism alive."</p>

  <p>"Patriotism's tripe!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Dinny.... Come over here and see my flag. Is that any better?"</p>

  <p>He bent his five-feet-eleven over her soft shoulder, leaning his weight
  against the table on an ink-smeared hand.</p>

  <p>"Fine, Janet! Much improved!... Now you take my Uncle Elmer; not meaning
  that he was worth a hoot before he went to Cuba, but just supposing he was.
  Gets himself all hotted up about his patriotic duty when somebody pounds a
  drum; sobs into his beer; hep-heps to Havana in boots two sizes too small for
  his big feet; curries the Colonel's horse; comes home with dysentery from
  eating spoiled meat that the get-rich-packers unloaded on them; and...
  Janet&mdash;perhaps you might give the eagle's left wing just a bit more
  spread... and expects to spend the rest of his life lying about in the shade
  at the Soldiers' Home. Patriotism&mdash;rot!... Look out for those stars,
  Janet! You'll have a deuce of a time putting them back in, you know, once
  they're out!"</p>

  <p>"I know, Dinny. By the way," she laughed, "that's what the General's
  little book is about; isn't it? He believed that. Once the stars were out, it
  would be hard to put them back in."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish! Sentiment!"</p>

  <p>"Then why are we doing this, at all?"</p>

  <p>"Because I'm earning money to go to college this autumn." Dinny turned
  back to his table and carefully peeled off a new proof.</p>

  <p>"Speaking of college&mdash;has your uncle relented?"</p>

  <p>"Him&mdash;relent? He's more convinced than ever. Says he has already
  assured old Dean What's-His-Name that I'd come to Magnolia; says it would do
  him a terrible lot of damage in the conference, or whatever it is, if I went
  to a godless State University. Everything's godless that Uncle Miles doesn't
  happen to know about. Odd jumble of conflicting ideas in Uncle Miles's head.
  I'd give something for a picture of the inside of it. Long ago, he was out in
  Arizona and visited the Petrified Forest. Never gets done talking about it.
  Picked up a piece and brought it home. Fondles it, and says, in a stage
  whisper, 'That's <i>a million years old,</i> my friend!'... But, on Sundays,
  it's only six thousand years old, so it won't antedate the sun, moon, and
  stars."</p>

  <p>"Don't be too hard on him, Dinny. He can't contradict Genesis, you know.
  His whole flock would stampede."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet Mr. Day wouldn't follow along in that stampede," said Dinny,
  eager as usual to find something meritorious in Mr. Day, seeing Janet had to
  live with him&mdash;a sore trial, he suspected. Or, was Dinny championing the
  cause of Mr. Day because he feared that Janet was thinking too much about Mr.
  Zimmerman, who was at home again, and so frequently visited her?</p>

  <p>"No," replied Janet, gravely. "Mr. Day wouldn't follow in that stampede.
  He never follows. He'd lead it."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;you don't mean to tell me Mr. Day believes that old Jewish myth
  about the universe being created in six days!"</p>

  <p>"On Sundays, when he's in church&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"And the yarn about Adam... and Eve made out of Adam's rib?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes; he believes that, every day and no matter where he
  is&mdash;especially about the rib."</p>

  <p>"Meaning... you're a rib, Janet?" queried Dinny, laughing, but
  half-wishing he had not said it.</p>

  <p>"One of the shorter ones, Dinny."</p>

  <p>"They're called 'floating' ribs."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;'floating'?... Loose?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," scoffed Dinny, pretending pride in his superior knowledge of
  physiology, "they never get loose."</p>

  <p>"I should have known that much; shouldn't I?"</p>

  <p>"You probably never thought about it, before."</p>

  <p>"Don't be too sure about that, my son," she said, in a tone that worried
  him a little. It wasn't like Janet to be so mysterious. He couldn't quite
  understand her, today. Even her immediate change of topic was not at all
  reassuring.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;I suppose you'll be going to Magnolia, then."</p>

  <p>"I'm in for it, all right. However, I am not particularly interested in
  science, so it doesn't matter much. The Lit. course at Magnolia is probably
  no thinner than in many a bigger school. Professors in English Comp. can't
  tell you how to write. If they knew how to do it, they'd be doing it;
  wouldn't they? All I want is a chance to do some reading, on my own hook, and
  plenty of time for scribbling. I can have that at Magnolia. They're much too
  hard up to enforce any discipline. I can go my own gait."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to miss you&mdash;terribly." Janet left her work, and stood
  beside him. Her eyes were troubled.</p>

  <p>"That's the only thing about it, Janet. I don't know how I'm to get along
  without you."</p>

  <p>She walked to the window and stood looking out.</p>

  <p>"There isn't very much more I could do for you, Dinny; is there?"</p>

  <p>"You're the only real friend I ever had, Janet." He put down the brayer
  and joined her at the window. "Sometimes, I've wondered if I wasn't leaning
  too heavily; monopolizing you."</p>

  <p>"It's been the other way about, dear," said Janet, soberly. "I've
  monopolized you. You haven't been interested in the girls of your class in
  school."</p>

  <p>"Pooh! They're nothing but silly little gigglers."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you wouldn't think so if you made any effort to know them."</p>

  <p>"You're all the girl I want, Janet," said Dinny, lightly.</p>

  <p>"That's just the trouble. It isn't good for you. I'm not your girl; nor am
  I your sister, or your mother." She faced about, and abruptly changed the
  subject. "Oscar&mdash;Mr. Zimmerman&mdash;wants you to have the stuff he lent
  us; all the Caxton and Cheltenham and the rest of it, and the seven-by-nine
  press, and this fancy Caslon, too. He says you're to take it along to college
  with you. He hopes you will set up a little shop and make it pay your way.
  Rather nice of him; don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"Very!" said Dinny, trying to sound grateful. "But weren't you going to
  use it, any more?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not after you leave, Dinny."</p>

  <p>He wasn't quite sure whether he wanted to be under such obligation to Mr.
  Zimmerman. True, it would be of no consequence to the rich bachelor
  globe-trotter whether Dinny used the printing-equipment or not. Otherwise it
  would probably be idle in a storage warehouse. But he disliked accepting
  anything from Mr. Zimmerman. He was candidly jealous of Mr. Zimmerman, of his
  easy grace, his urbane manners, his charming personality, his casual
  allusions to the places he had seen&mdash;Singapore, Calcutta,
  Moscow&mdash;mentioning them in about the same tone Dinny might have used
  when speaking of Oak Grove or Zanesdale or Unger. He often wondered if Mr.
  Day were jealous, too; not that he cared, greatly. Perhaps Mr. Day's private
  feelings were modified, somewhat, by the fact that Mr. Zimmerman was one of
  the heaviest stockholders in the Day Wholesale Provision Company. Money made
  a lot of difference.</p>

  <p>"Dinny"&mdash;Janet's voice was a bit uncertain&mdash;"we're getting
  awfully crowded and cluttered in this room. Lately, I've been thinking we
  might move our printing-stuff to larger quarters. I looked at a room
  yesterday. It's in the Woolford Block on Superior Street&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dinny remembered that Mr. Zimmerman owned the Woolford Block, and with
  difficulty suppressed a scowl.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and I can get it for a song. Suppose you run in, next time you're
  down-town, and see what you think of it."</p>

  <p>She took up her purse from the table, and handed him a key.</p>

  <p>"Number 306. Go in on Monday, after school, and look it over."</p>

  <p>Dinny was in no position to debate the matter. He nodded, and took the
  key. It was growing dark, though only five-thirty, and the rain was falling
  in torrents.</p>

  <p>"Take my umbrella, dear."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Janet. I'll telephone you, when I've seen the room."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, dear." She reached out her slim hand, and looked up,
  fleetingly, into his perplexed eyes. It was so unlike her to offer her hand.
  They never shook hands. Dinny took it, rather confusedly, and was at a loss
  what to say.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you're dreadfully worried about something." Dinny swallowed
  hard, and put his hands lightly on her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"'Bye, Dinny!" Impulsively she threw her arms tightly around his neck and
  kissed him on the lips; then, turning quickly away, walked toward the window,
  stood with both hands outspread on the broad sill, a mere silhouette in the
  gathering gloom.</p>

  <p>That was the picture he retained of Janet for a dozen years.</p>

  <p>With another long, anxious look, he reluctantly went out, and closed the
  door.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On Monday afternoon, he went to inspect the room in the
  Woolford Block; went without interest, and weighted by an unaccountable
  depression.</p>

  <p>The room was not empty, as he had expected. All their printing-equipment
  was there, installed in orderly fashion, ready for work.</p>

  <p>On the imposing-stone was a receipted bill for three months' rental. At
  the bottom of the paper, hurriedly written in pencil, were a few lines in
  Janet's tall, slim letters:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">God keep you always, dear Dinny. Forgive me for going away.
  I'm not really bad, Dinny. It's just that I'm tired playing
  wheel-barrow.</p><br>

  <p>He gazed woodenly at the message for a long time, with an aching throat
  and burning eyes. Then he tore it into small bits, savagely stuffed the
  scraps into his pocket, went out, locked the door, and clumped slowly down
  the stairs.... Janet was no better than the rest of them. They were all
  cheaters! Damn them!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER a wheezing ascent of four steep flights in the wake of
  his young employer and guide, the gruff expressman had un-shouldered
  Ferdinand's small, old-fashioned trunk, with a groan of relief and reproach,
  and had ambled off down the bare, resounding dormitory hall grumblingly
  fingering the four dimes and seven nickels that totalled his exact
  charge.</p>

  <p>Obedient to some atavism urging him to establish a claim to his new
  property without delay, Ferdinand laid his coat and collar on the sagging
  bed, and went through the preliminary gestures of making himself at home. The
  room was cramped, shabby, and incompletely furnished, but it was his, and the
  feeling of possession was pleasureable.</p>

  <p>The convex lid of the antiquated trunk was thrown back against the dingy
  wall, and the welcome task of unpacking proceeded; his meagre, outmoded
  wardrobe, a handful of books, a dozen cheap towels, and the case of
  carving-tools, over which there had been such a row, Aunt Martha's eloquent
  disapproval rending the Yuletide peace and reaching an impassioned climax in
  her unexecuted threat to carry the expensive gift back to that there
  high-'n'-mighty Mrs. Day with her own hands.</p>

  <p>"With love to Dinny from Janet."</p>

  <p>It was the engraving on the silver plate inside the velvet-lined lid that
  had detonated Aunt Martha's tightly corked resentment against a mysterious
  (and probably questionable) friendship which had ripened without benefit of
  her sanction, and was increasingly fulfilling her dire prediction that the
  attachment would wean Ferdinand away from his "humble home 'n' all that it
  stands fer."</p>

  <p>And what right had this Mrs. Day to be "Janet" to a mere half-grown boy,
  inexperienced, unworldly, and calfishly infatuated? What kind o' "love" was
  this, we'd like to know, that had the impudence to flaunt itself in the face
  of his family! And since when had his name been changed to "Dinny"?...
  "Dinny"&mdash;indeed!... <i>"Dinny!"</i>&mdash;well, we'd see about that!</p>

  <p>Ferdinand sat down on the edge of the weak-spined bed with the
  silver-mounted box in his hands.</p>

  <p>Queer&mdash;wasn't it?&mdash;how an inanimate thing, pieced together of
  wood and screws and glue, silver and velvet and steel, could take on a
  personality possessed of so many sensitive, changing moods? One day you
  couldn't bear to look at it for the worry and chagrin it had caused you. Next
  day you loved it so tenderly it made your throat thick. Another day you
  despised it for reminding you of a tragic disenchantment that had all but
  killed you.</p>

  <p>The box of carving-tools and his mother's little walnut desk; living
  things, they were!</p>

  <p>The desk!... One winter Sunday afternoon when he was seven, in a promptly
  repented unveiling of cankered memories, Aunt Martha had told him the story
  of the desk; just the bare, ugly, shameful facts about the storm of jealousy
  it had provoked, a storm which Aunt Martha deplored but partly justified.</p>

  <p>"I always said yer grandpa never should 'a' done it. He might 'a' knew it
  wouldn't set right with th' rest o' th' family; not that I ever cared,
  myself. I had t' work too hard, goodness knows, ever t' spend any time
  a-settin' at a desk. But Julia was always his favourite. It broke his heart
  when she died."</p>

  <p>"And grandpa died, too, that same night, Aunt Martha, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha had nodded, shuddered, and laid another stick on the fire.</p>

  <p>The desk had come along when Aunt Martha had left "th' old home," her
  brothers and sisters pressing no claim to a share in it. As a little lad, he
  saw it only when they moved from one house to another; and not even then, for
  it had remained thickly wrapped in the dusty burlap in which it had been
  shipped to Unger.</p>

  <p>Shrouded, it had lived in dark corners of attics, damp corners of cellars,
  a thing neither to be used nor thrown away. It was almost as if they carried
  his mother's corpse about with them. When they had moved to Indianapolis,
  Ferdinand had asked for it. Consent was rather grudgingly given. He had one
  desk, hadn't he? However, Aunt Martha supposed he had a right to it, if he
  wanted to crowd his room with it. Sometimes he wished he had not insisted. He
  almost never used it, and when he did he felt depressed.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he had better ask Uncle Miles to ship him the desk.... Dinny drew
  a wry smile. He could put the case of carving-tools in the drawer of the
  desk, and let them settle their problems between themselves. Now that he was
  in college, there would be plenty of other things to occupy his attention.
  New friends and fresh interests would lay his ghosts.</p>

  <p>But, what about these new friends; these fresh interests?</p>

  <p>The past three hours had been a disappointing surprise. "College" was not
  quite as he had pictured it, a comradely, democratic, open-hearted
  aggregation of irresponsible youngsters, bent on getting acquainted with one
  another by the shortest routes.</p>

  <p>At almost every station stop, en route from Indianapolis to
  Magnolia&mdash;so close to Cincinnati as to think of itself as a
  suburb&mdash;young people boarded the train. Doubtless they were going to
  college; perhaps to Magnolia. A few suitcases were adorned with pink and
  white stickers, pennant-shaped, cheering for the school. Already he was
  entertaining a growing sense of loyalty and pride.</p>

  <p>For the most part, however, the pilgrims bound for Magnolia, if they
  greeted each other at all, seemed shy and restrained; a mere nod, "Hello,
  Buster; back to the mill?"... "How 'r' yuh, Prichard; good summer?"</p>

  <p>But this was the day-coach, and these the day-coachers. The distinction
  gradually dawned on Ferdinand. For some time he had been curious, when the
  train stopped in the larger towns, over festive sounds on the platform well
  to the rear. At Richmond, he strolled to the steps, and, leaning out, saw a
  score or more of well-dressed, high-spirited people, old and young, bidding
  good-bye to a handful of students, gathered at the entrance to a Pullman, the
  white-jacketed porter busy with their baggage.</p>

  <p>He went back through his own car, and overheard their cryptic banter as
  they scrambled up the steps, the porter banging the vestibule doors behind
  them. These, too, were Magnolians&mdash;the real, traditional college
  students of song and story, larkish, noisy, devil-may-care. He wished he had
  committed the extravagance of riding in the Pullman. It would have made all
  the difference. Not quite, however, he reflected&mdash;not in these
  clothes.</p>

  <p>A month afterward, burning with hot resentment against the discrimination
  that had bled his pride white, Ferdinand marvelled that nearly four years of
  intimate association with a person so sophisticated as Janet Day had
  contributed almost nothing to his knowledge of that other world to whose
  citizenship he aspired.</p>

  <p>Analysing their relations, however, he saw that it was neither his fault
  nor hers that the friendship had done so little for him in this respect. Such
  community of interest as they had was based almost exclusively on their
  shop-work. Ferdinand had never taken a meal with her except the sandwiches,
  cakes and tea, casually enjoyed during a few minutes of recess from their
  occupation. Janet was always dressed in an inky, paint-daubed smock, her hair
  down her back; he was always in his working togs. They rarely talked of
  anything else than their immediate concerns. Janet had not given him a ticket
  to the world of smart people.</p>

  <p>Alighting from the train, Ferdinand confronted a gay scene. A spirited
  crowd&mdash;modishly dressed, bareheaded, beautiful girls, and
  white-sweatered, flannel-trousered, handsome fellows&mdash;cheered and
  chaffed the recruits descending from the Pullmans; their classmates, no
  doubt; old acquaintances: but no&mdash;fully half of them were obviously
  newcomers, like himself. Solicitously in tow of the old-timers, they were now
  being presented to the welcoming throng. A phalanx of motor-cars was drawn up
  along the platform, engines noisily churning and clamouring to be off,
  drivers' seats occupied by debonair greeters, sons and daughters of the other
  world, the world that rode in Pullmans and came to meet people who rode in
  Pullmans.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand had not been expecting anyone to meet him, and therefore had no
  occasion to be disappointed; but he was overcome with a feeling of such
  loneliness as had never afflicted him before. He took up his battered old
  suitcase, made some inquiries of a policeman whose amused attention was
  grudgingly distracted from the real people's festivities, boarded a
  street-car, reached the campus&mdash;a gently undulating grove of oaks and
  elms, zigzagged with winding paths of white, hard-tramped gravel-ribbons that
  negligently wandered about from one main entrance to another of the dozen or
  more nondescript buildings of brick, of stone, of cement, of wood, in
  attempted imitation of every known school of architecture and ranging in age
  all the way from raw newness to pathetic dilapidation.</p>

  <p>He had anticipated, without relish, the quiet chat he would probably have
  with Dean Sloke. He would be shown into Dean Sloke's office, when his turn
  came.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;so you are Ferdinand Brumm, the nephew of my esteemed friend,
  the Reverend Miles Brumm of Indianapolis, who has been a valuable supporter
  of Magnolia. We are glad to have you here, Mr. Brumm. Now what can we do for
  you to make you comfortable?"</p>

  <p>Ferdinand was pointed to the Registrar's office. He saw that there was no
  necessity for seeking an interview with Dean Sloke. There was a long line of
  bewildered freshmen, leaning an elbow against the long, tall counter. No one
  of them in any way resembled the urbane youths who had been so hilariously
  received at the station. Surely they had had time to arrive here, by now.
  Mailed advice had counselled freshmen to come to the Administration Building
  immediately upon arrival. Where were these others? But perhaps there was a
  special room for their accommodation. Maybe the freshmen who came to town in
  Pullman cars were handled in some distinctive manner, or at some other
  hour.</p>

  <p>He took his place in the line, and, advantaged by his height, surveyed his
  neighbours. The girl in front of him was a nervous, home-made, little thing;
  the boy whose broad, square back obstructed her view of the distant goal had
  the black-tanned neck of a farmer. The criss-cross furrows on the neck
  announced that their bearer was older than the others by four or five years.
  He'd been ploughing deep and saving his pennies against the day when he might
  come to college.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand was half-ashamed of himself over this critical invoice of his
  companions. Come to think of it&mdash;this was his own crowd, after all;
  wasn't it? By what right was he assuming a supercilious attitude, in his
  mind, toward these yokels?</p>

  <p>At length he had reached the impressively business-like, barricaded throne
  of the Registrar and his self-consciously competent assistants. He answered a
  few crisp, inquisitorial queries, wrote his name on three or four blanks
  which were promptly and soundly smacked with a big rubber stamp, counted out
  forty-two dollars at an adjoining wicket for which he received another
  emphatic whack on his credentials, moved forward to "Rooms," paid another
  fee, earned another whack, took his key, picked up the old suitcase he had
  been pushing along with his foot, and milled through the crowd to the
  doorway. It moved back, a little, to make room.</p>

  <p>Nobody had spoken to him except the perfunctory clerks, nor he to any;
  though there had been a few shy, bucolic grins accompanying the "Beg your
  pardon" which went along with sundry unintentional jabs of elbows in the
  jostling line-up of rookies.</p>

  <p>They were a very ordinary lot of people, he thought, on both sides of the
  counter. Those back of the counter were a bit more seasoned, had learned
  their tricks, had developed something of the arrogance so appropriately worn
  by petty officials peering through wickets and sourly handing dipped pens to
  the public for its signature; but there was no essential difference between
  the green clodhoppers on this side the barrier and the ripe clodhoppers on
  the other.</p>

  <p>As he had stood there waiting, Ferdinand wondered if Magnolia wasn't
  trying to impress the new arrivals; trying to make-believe she was a big
  university. Where was this warm, home-y friendliness that bubbled on the
  comradely pages of the college catalogue? Was all this swanky,
  big-business-y, card-index-y, cash-register-y atmosphere, this frowning
  fussiness, this cool official insolence, this elaborate hocus-pocus of
  labelled wicket-windows and ostentatious thud of rubber stamps a lot o' bunk?
  His instinct told him the whole affair screamed of insincerity.... "Just a
  friendly, home-y, little college"&mdash;hell!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Ferdinand answered a vigorous rat-a-tat-tat of knuckles and
  admitted one who, promptly identifying himself as Orville Kling, junior,
  resident across the hall, candidate for the ministry, leader of the college
  band in need of new material, and Religious Editor of <i>The Blossom,</i>
  requested pay, in kind, at his first full stop, for his generous tender of a
  biographical sketch.</p>

  <p>With less to tell about himself, Ferdinand made short work of his own
  story. Pressed for further disclosures, he admitted he had no idea what he
  would "take up." No&mdash;not the ministry; he was sure of that much....
  Well&mdash;he had no taste for it, no fitness for it, and, to be frank, no
  interest in it. Kling thought this odd, considering Ferdinand's home
  environment.</p>

  <p>"Hope you'll come down to the Y rooms, second floor, tonight at seven,"
  suggested Kling. "Just an informal little get-together of the fellows to meet
  the new Frosh; a sing-song, brief devotional service, some short prayers, a
  few snappy talks; all through by eight."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Ferdinand, graciously, but without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"That's the spirit," approved Kling, anxious to exhilarate Ferdinand's wan
  interest. "It makes all the difference, later, if you begin your college life
  right."</p>

  <p>Ferdinand nodded obligingly, and conceded that this must be true, but his
  acquiescence lacked fervour. Bent on saving a soul from anæmia, Kling rose to
  defend his moral precept.</p>

  <p>Hands deep in his coat pockets, and rhythmically elevating himself on his
  toes, he dealt seriously with Ferdinand's limp aspirations to make a right
  start.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;it makes all the difference, you'll find. The whole four
  years depend on the first week's contacts. Down there on Sunnyside Avenue,
  the upper classmen are teaching the new fraternity pledges to smoke a pipe,
  scorn the bars, and beat the profs.... Up here, we have different ideas.
  You'll start right, won't you, Brumm?"</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;at a prayer-meeting?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;that kind of a beginning would make for safety; wouldn't it?"
  queried Kling, slightly accelerating the tempo of his adroit bouncing up and
  down on his toes.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand grinned amiably, and walked to the window, leaning against it;
  long, rangy arms folded.</p>

  <p>"I'm pretty well up on prayer-meetings, Mr. Kling. I've been raised on
  them. And&mdash;as for safety, I have all my credits in that, too.... I mean
  to be friendly, and I'd like to meet the fellows, and I appreciate your
  asking me, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Kling stopped his bouncing and drew a long face.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;you won't be there."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so."</p>

  <p>Kling smiled bravely, shook his head regretfully, seemed reluctant to
  leave. His eye wandered about the room.</p>

  <p>"Play on anything?" he inquired, brightening.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'm not musical. Sorry."</p>

  <p>"Thought that might be a clarinet. We need another clarinet."</p>

  <p>"It's a case of carving-tools."</p>

  <p>"Carving-tools.... I never saw any. Mind if I look?"</p>

  <p>Ferdinand's consent and the snap of the latch occurred simultaneously.
  Kling glanced up and smiled.</p>

  <p>"They call you 'Dinny,' don't they?"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es."</p>

  <p>"Rah, rah, rah&mdash;Dinny Brumm! That's what we'll be hearing next
  autumn. You'll be going out for football, of course. They wouldn't let a big
  fellow like you escape.... Janet your sister?"</p>

  <p>"Yes.... Is the athletic field close?"</p>

  <p>Kling pointed north with his head, deeply interested in the shining
  tools.</p>

  <p>"'Most everybody's there now, watching the varsity warm up. Want to go
  over? I'm going."</p>

  <p>Ferdinand begged off with an excuse that he had a few errands in town.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;so long, Dinny. See you later."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Supper was at five-thirty, the tenants of the dormitory
  preferring it early. Ferdinand was not hungry, nor was he keenly disposed to
  risk further interrogations about his plans for the evening. Waiting until
  the clangour of the second bell and the last clatter of descending feet had
  subsided, he put on the rather yellow and battered straw hat that Aunt Martha
  felt would do quite well enough, though he had entertained some doubts,
  walked quietly down stairs, down the slope, and turned to the left on
  Sunnyside Avenue. The broad verandas of the fraternity houses were filled
  with bareheaded students, some standing, some lounging in the big wicker
  chairs, some sitting on the railings swinging white-flannelled legs.
  Ferdinand was conscious of their amused attention, as he passed the Beta
  House&mdash;the last on the row, opposite which one took the streetcar.</p>

  <p>A merry voice sang out, accompanied by good-natured chuckles, and followed
  by a mature growl. "Cut that out, Reddy! What th' hell!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Hey, Reuben! How's the weather up there?"</p>

  <p>Ferdinand scowled, flushed, and gave his full attention to the approaching
  street-car. He wondered if he wasn't going to hate Magnolia.</p>

  <p>After supper, at a downtown restaurant, for which he had little relish, he
  went to the office of <i>The Morning Star,</i> and made his way to the
  Managing Editor's desk. He was a little more sure of himself in this
  environment, and presented his cause without nervousness.</p>

  <p>"What experience have you had?" asked Mr. Brophy, tilting back in his
  chair, and scrutinizing Ferdinand not unpleasantly from under his green
  eye-shade.</p>

  <p>"I've been doing amateur and semi-professional art-craft printing for some
  time. Since early June, I was on the display ads with <i>The Ledger,</i>
  Indianapolis."</p>

  <p>"How could you work evenings, and go to college?"</p>

  <p>"I think I could manage, sir. No classes in the afternoon."</p>

  <p>"You'd have to be on from seven to ten-thirty, six nights a week... all
  but Saturday."</p>

  <p>"I could do that."</p>

  <p>"Take this out to the composing-room, and set it."</p>

  <p>Ferdinand nodded, took the ad-copy, and pushed his way through the
  metallic racket of linotypes to the row of cases in the corner. It was the
  first time he had felt at home in Magnolia. The smell of ink revived his
  spirits, straightened his broad shoulders. Mr. Brophy followed him along, and
  spoke laconically to the grizzled foreman who nodded without looking up or
  removing his pipe.</p>

  <p>"You may begin to-morrow evening, if you like," said Mr. Brophy, an hour
  later, glancing over Ferdinand's shoulder. "Ninety cents an hour. Six nights;
  seven to ten-thirty. Time and a half for overtime. Pay on Mondays.
  Right?"</p>

  <p>"Right!... Thank you, sir."</p>

  <p>After a while, the foreman strolled over.</p>

  <p>"Pretty fair, for a dub," he growled, fetching his <i>r</i>'s rolling up
  from far back under an Irish pharynx. "Mr. Brophy says you'll be goin' to
  college, day-times. Sure it won't be too much for ye, me boy?"</p>

  <p>Ferdinand lowered his half-filled stick, and warmed to the genial,
  ruddy-faced Timmy Fagan. No&mdash;he could do it, all right. Liked it.
  Besides&mdash;he needed the money. Couldn't stay here without some kind of a
  job.</p>

  <p>"You're luckier 'n most, t' have a trade," said Timmy. "Most uv 'em has to
  wait table and wash dishes at th' frats."</p>

  <p>"I'd see myself doing that!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;somebody's got t' wait on th' rich boys 'n' girls, 'n' see
  that they have enough t' eat, when they come in from their tennis, all tired
  and hungry," drawled Timmy, his eyes wrinkling with delight as he noticed the
  flexing of Ferdinand's jaw-muscles. "But," he added, "I can see that you'd
  rather somebody else 'tended to it... . And&mdash;now that we're speakin' o'
  meals, maybe you'd like to come over and have a bite o' honest Irish
  hospitality on Sunday, say, after the eleven o'clock Mass which you won't be
  to, bein' a heathen. The missus'll be glad, and th' kids, too. You'll be
  lonely like, for a while."</p>

  <p>Only an ungrateful snob could refuse such an invitation, thought
  Ferdinand. He accepted gladly, promptly; but, a moment later, and all the way
  back to thecampus, where the dormitory windows gleamed with a welcome he
  wished he might respond to with more warmth, he was uneasy over his promise
  to old Timmy. Timmy, God bless him, had him all wrong.... Right, of course,
  about thinking he would resent the necessity of a job to wait table for these
  precious young well-to-do's, but quite wrong in thinking that he wanted to
  hold himself in sour aloofness from them. It was the world they lived in that
  he most wanted to explore! And how was he ever to invade that world if he
  approached it via Sunday dinners at the Timmy Fagans'? Perhaps he'd better
  trump up some excuse.... But Timmy was no fool. Timmy mustn't be hurt.</p>

  <p>However&mdash;no use worrying about it. Nobody need know. The Fagans
  probably had no college connections, at all. The "kids" would be freckled
  little Micks&mdash;a half-dozen, maybe, who would show him their toy
  aeroplane... and that would be the end of it. "Such a nice time, Mrs.
  Fagan!... Thank you, Mr. Fagan.... Yes, indeed, Mr. Fagan, I'll be glad
  to!... Good-bye, little Fagans!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He couldn't help being so tall that his contemporaries
  presumed him able to get forecasts of the weather, but he could help looking
  like a Rube. Pursuant to that resolution, he went into town, the next day,
  strode up to the counter of the best clothing store, and possessed himself of
  a natty new suit of blue serge.</p>

  <p>His immediate college bills had been paid, and there was more than a
  hundred dollars in his pocket&mdash;earned by himself, every cent of it! Why
  shouldn't he do what he liked with it? His wages were assured. They would
  amply cover his expenses, with a comfortable margin.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand paid for the suit and spent the remaining forty-eight dollars of
  the hundred he had allotted to this adventure in a neighbouring haberdashery.
  Uncle Miles, he knew, would have scowled and remarked that even friendly
  little colleges have a "subversive" (pet word of his) influence on youth; and
  as for Aunt Martha, she would have had&mdash;if aware of his amazing
  profligacy&mdash;a fit.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Up early on Friday, arrayed in all his new finery&mdash;the
  blue, double-breasted suit that squared his shoulders, the soft grey fedora
  set at a sporty angle on his freshly groomed head, russet shoes, smart fawn
  shirt, tie a shade darker matching the handkerchief that peeped from his
  breast pocket&mdash;Ferdinand found he still had half an hour to spare before
  his first encounter with the class in English Composition.</p>

  <p>Yesterday there had been mere lesson-assignment sessions in Beginner's
  Greek with old Appleton, who promised to be a hard taskmaster; Algebra under
  nervous and self-conscious young Peters who would be lenient (it was devoutly
  to be hoped); and Latin under the meek and obsequious little Harwood,
  commonly spoken of as The Bearded Lady.</p>

  <p>He would bone in Greek not only because he really wanted to learn it but
  was afraid of Appleton&mdash;a sarcastic old savage. He would toddle along in
  Cicero, Latin being a cinch for him. And as for Algebra, it could go to the
  devil along with the inexperienced Peters who was clearly too frightened over
  his new responsibility to pay much attention to anybody else's dilemmas.</p>

  <p>But English Composition was quite another matter. This was going to be a
  bread-and-butter affair. Ferdinand knew he would be writing, all his life;
  writing for a career, writing for wages. No fooling, here.</p>

  <p>He could have wished that Professor Grover's sketch in the catalogue had
  hinted at a wider experience. A degree from some well-known university would
  have added lustre to his biography.</p>

  <p>That Professor Grover had not been much of a nomad was obvious. Never had
  he been taken up, in foreign parts, for vagrancy. He had stayed on home base
  and kept himself unspotted from the world.</p>

  <p>Topping the list of courses offered by the English Department was an
  impressive and extended survey of the Grover equipment.</p><br>

  <p class="sign">WILLIAM ERNST GROVER, A.B., A.M., PH.D., LITT.D.</p><br>

  <p>So far; so good. But the rest of it indicated that Professor Grover's
  mileage was disturbingly low.</p>

  <p>Three cheers for good old Magnolia; eh, Professor Grover? Ferdinand would
  have grinned had he been less disturbed over the prospect.</p>

  <p>The time came when he did grin; shouted with laughter; slapped his leg and
  yelled with delight. That was while engaged in composing the article on
  "Rhododendron College," midway of his junior year. He sold the article to
  <i>The Icono</i>c<i>last,</i> receiving, two months later, in the same mail,
  a cheque for one hundred dollars from the editor in New York, and a crisp
  request for an early interview with President Braithwaite of Magnolia.</p>

  <p>"It might have been more discreet," said President Braithwaite,
  endeavouring to suppress a twinkle, "had you gone to the fauna rather than
  the flora for a fictitious name. 'Rhododendron' made it a bit obvious, you
  know.... This about the Pyncheon chickens&mdash;facetious enough but cruelly
  unkind!"</p>

  <p>"I had had the chickens in mind for a long time, sir," said Ferdinand, on
  that occasion. "It simply had to be said."</p>

  <p>He did not say how long, but the fact was that this idea had first
  occurred to him on the morning early in his freshman year when, with a few
  minutes to spare before going down to his first class in English Composition,
  he had put aside <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i> which he had been
  reading, and had glanced at the college catalogue's sketch of Professor
  Grover.</p>

  <p>Apropos of "Rhododendron's" policy of recruiting her Faculty exclusively
  from the ranks of her own alumni, Ferdinand, the junior, wrote:</p>

  <p>"Concerned as this institution is over the mental and moral improvement of
  the outer world, particularly such parts of it as must be reached by water,
  it occurs to some of us that Rhododendron College might well consider a
  philanthropy nearer home.</p>

  <p>"Year after year, proud of her children, Alma Mater has refused to permit
  their acceptance of chairs in other schools.</p>

  <p>"Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Columbia&mdash;does Rhododendron not owe it to
  these institutions, all of them doing good work and undeniably excellent in
  their way, to encourage their efforts not only by consenting that a few of
  our alumni may join their faculties, but by inviting some of their more
  distinguished sons to accept minor posts on our instructional staff?</p>

  <p>"Not a Rhododendron alumnus on the faculty of any other college! Not a
  single professor at Rhododendron bearing a degree from any other school!</p>

  <p>"Should it be said that our policy of intellectual inbreeding insures the
  integrity of our academic tribe, and guarantees against the debilitating
  invasion of alien blood, it may be replied that dangers lurk in the way of
  such aloofness.</p>

  <p>"Witness, for example, the tragic plight of Hepzibah Pyncheon's poultry.
  Generation after generation, they had carried on, gloriously free of any
  exotic contamination, dourly scornful of the frivolous vulgarians in
  neighbouring coops. And did not the fateful day arrive at length when these
  same Pycheon chickens stalked about, spurless, combless, and without plumage;
  still proud, still grave, still haughty, but lacking the sense of humour
  necessary to the laying of an egg, to say nothing of the thermal dynamics
  required to hatch one?</p>

  <p>"Featherless, eggless&mdash;but not crowless. Even when they were too
  feeble to scratch, either for provender or reasons of personal hygiene, they
  still raised their voices in the old pæan of praise that they had been kept
  free of foreign taints. They had the pip, yes; but, thank God, they were not
  mongrels!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Discovering, to his dismay, that the new russet shoes were
  much too snug, Ferdinand hurriedly divested himself of the entire ensemble,
  resolved that he would wear none of it until he could wear it all.</p>

  <p>Professor Grover was kindly patronizing, playfully paternal. The class
  would begin by submitting, on Tuesday, a fifteen-hundred-word theme on "Early
  Impressions of Magnolia."</p>

  <p>As the class straggled out, Ferdinand overheard a colloquy in the hall.
  The Pullmans were talking it over, as they ambled toward the main
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"Freddy says the old boy always asks for that, the first day. He says if
  you dash off a lot o' rot about the great honour and privilege, and all that
  sort o' bilge, you're solid with him for keeps; says if you write that when
  you saw the campus for the first time you just sat down on the grass and
  cried out loud, you'll be a Phi Beta Kappa when you're a senior."</p>

  <p>"Phi Beta Kappa! D'you mean they've got a&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a silly ass!... Phi Beta Kappa, my eye!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The elder of the two Fagan kids was a girl with the blackest
  hair, the bluest eyes, the whitest skin, the evenest teeth, and the most
  heady smile that Ferdinand had ever seen done into one picture of glowing,
  high-school-girlish vivacity. Patrick, Kitty's brother, was fifteen.</p>

  <p>Timmy Fagan's elder kid was going to resemble her mother, one day, as to
  amplitude of charms; you could see that. At seventeen, however, this threat,
  that at forty-two Kitty's physique would probably be redundant, evoked no
  pity.</p>

  <p>The dinner was all that it had promised to be, and more; a gay meal,
  Ferdinand at his best, glad he had come.</p>

  <p>It was over now. Young Pat had left for a ball game. Timmy's eyes began to
  swim in response to custom's demand for the Sunday afternoon nap. Mrs.
  Fagan's house-wifely conscience had conveyed her to the kitchen, scorning the
  volunteered assistance of her attractive child.</p>

  <p>They sat in the swing on the little side porch overlooking the trim, tiny
  garden. Ferdinand was actively in the market for the companionship Kitty was
  so ready to bestow. He had been quite desperately lonely, almost ill of
  loneliness.</p>

  <p>"You haven't seen our beautiful park yet," said Kitty. "You'll like it, I
  think. It's very nice, and there's a big lagoon with boats. Lots of people go
  there, Sundays."</p>

  <p>They stood for a long time, at her gate, laughing, bantering, occasionally
  lowering their voices to brief seriousness, on their return at
  five-thirty.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand regretfully looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Kitty," he said. "Next Sunday, then."</p>

  <p>"Okay, Dinny... 'Bye."</p>

  <p>There was a deliciously lilting circumflex accent over the "'Bye" that
  rang and sang in Dinny's ears, all evening, as he stood at the case and
  struck large, boastful type certifying that Wembie's would be doing the city
  of Magnolia a good turn, tomorrow, with some unprecedented values in sheets
  and pillow-cases.</p>

     id="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"NO use," said the nurse, decisively. "He won't see
  you."</p>

  <p>"He's got to," growled Dinny.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know as he's got to," countered Miss Lash, suddenly defiant.
  "The police couldn't make him talk. What makes you think&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Sister"&mdash;Dinny drew an ominous frown&mdash;"you go back to Mr. Peter
  Andrews and tell him <i>The Star</i> knows all about it, anyway&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thinks it does, maybe," scoffed Miss Lash.</p>

  <p>"Which comes to the same thing, so far as tomorrow morning's report of the
  accident is concerned, he'll find. I'm here to let him correct us on any of
  the minor details. It's ten o'clock, and we've no time to fritter."</p>

  <p>"You certainly have a lot of crust&mdash;for a kid."</p>

  <p>"You ought to know," grinned Dinny, companionably. "Just a kid yourself."
  The accusation was ridiculous. Miss Lash was not seriously annoyed, however,
  and the little nose she made at him developed into a smile.</p>

  <p>"I'll try him again," she said, in the manner of a fellow conspirator.</p>

  <p>Dinny was covering his first assignment as a reporter. Mr. Brophy had
  urged him to work full time through the Thanksgiving recess, the display ads
  being particularly heavy at this season.</p>

  <p>"And if you have nothing better to amuse yourself with in the evenings,"
  added the editor, "you may share Anderson's police beat with young Maloney.
  Anderson's off to see his Alabama relatives. You've been hankering to try
  your hand at reporting: here's your chance."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brophy had been prompt to make his promise good. The Thanksgiving
  vacation had begun only today at noon, a general hegira leaving the campus
  all but deserted. Happy to have a congenial companion, Dinny worked on the
  ads all afternoon and early evening. At nine-thirty, Timmy Fagan called, "Mr.
  Brophy wants ye."</p>

  <p>"You're just leaving for the Protestant Hospital, young feller"&mdash;Mr.
  Brophy tossed him a memorandum scribbled on a card&mdash;"to interview an old
  man, mysteriously shot in the leg; has no police record, good citizen, but
  won't talk. Make him tell you.... Scatter along, now, and see what you're
  good for."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Andrews says you can come up," announced Miss Lash, amiably. "I told
  him he'd better get it off his chest; but don't pester him, will you? He's a
  fine old man, and wouldn't hurt a fly. I won't have him persecuted."</p>

  <p>"It seems he's told you," deduced Dinny.</p>

  <p>She raised her brows, smiled archly, and led the way, Dinny following with
  long, confident strides.</p>

  <p>"Very sick?" he inquired, as they traversed the third-floor corridor. The
  pungent reek of antiseptics and spent ether were doing odd tricks with
  Dinny's unaccustomed nostrils, and the hoarse, unhuman moans of some patient
  groping out of anæsthesia shortened his steps. Miss Lash grinned.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;or you wouldn't be seeing him; superficial wound, no infection,
  he can go home in a day or two. But"&mdash;she paused at the door&mdash;"I'll
  not have him hectored; understand? If he doesn't want to talk freely, that's
  that, and there's your hat. Promise?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Andrews's gaunt old frame was so slight that the bed seemed unoccupied
  except for the benign face on the pillow. He shyly projected a thin, white
  hand from beneath the sheet, cleared his throat nervously, and drew a timid,
  embarrassed smile.</p>

  <p>"Nurse thinks I may as well tell you," he murmured, with a weary sigh. "If
  I don't, you'll probably make it worse than it is, though it's none of the
  public's business, far as I can see."</p>

  <p>"The public," sympathized Dinny, taking the chair Miss Lash had pushed up
  for him, and sensing with satisfaction the revival of his self-confidence,
  "is an old hen.... And the newspapers are impudent gossips.... And reporters
  are a pest.... But&mdash;such things being as they are&mdash;how <i>did</i>
  you get shot in the leg?"</p>

  <p>"My next-door neighbour, out in Lambert Park, is Mr. Charles
  McCutcheon&mdash;" The old man sighed again, deeply, as he watched the name
  sprawling across the reporter's untidy wad of copy-paper; but, having burned
  his bridges, there was no retreat. "&mdash;A longtime friend of mine. We both
  work for the Buckeye Implement Company. We have a croquet-ground together, a
  small garden, and in the winter we play chess."</p>

  <p>"He has been to see you, I presume," encouraged Dinny.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;er&mdash;well, yes; but I had them say I was too sick.... I'll
  be coming to that, in a minute."</p>

  <p>The weary old voice droned on, reminiscently. Charlie was a widower, you
  know; he, a bachelor; nobody else mattered; went down town in the morning on
  the same car, lunched together, pretty nearly inseparable.</p>

  <p>"'Bout two weeks ago, Charlie's daughter&mdash;the one that lives in
  Pinckney, and doesn't like me very well because I monopolize
  Charlie&mdash;gave him a St. Bernard pup to keep him company, a big-footed,
  empty-headed, destructive beast that tore up Charlie's house, all
  day&mdash;what time he wasn't tearing up mine&mdash;and howled like the devil
  all night. I could see that Charlie was worried, but he kept saying the dog
  would settle down and feel at home presently.</p>

  <p>"And so, yesterday&mdash;wasn't it, nurse?&mdash;Charlie had gone down to
  Tiro to spend the night with William's folks; wedding anniversary, or
  something. You see, I hadn't slept for more 'n' week. Guess I was kinda out
  o' my head. Charlie had him out in a kennel at the far end of the lot; but,
  Gosh! that hadn't helped any.... I had an old revolver that hadn't been fired
  off for ten years or so. Three o'clock, I was pretty desperate, and put on my
  pants 'n' went out there. Somehow the hammer got caught in my
  pocket&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You could have made up a story, couldn't you?" inquired Dinny,
  solicitously.</p>

  <p>"I'm not very good at that," replied the old man. "Besides&mdash;my leg
  hurt pretty bad. I managed to get in before it had bled very much, and
  'phoned for the doctor. He brought me here&mdash;and that's all there is to
  it. You can print it, if you want to, and all the neighbours will despise
  me&mdash;and Charlie will never speak to me again."</p>

  <p>"What did you do with the gun?" asked Dinny.</p>

  <p>"Threw the darned thing in the cistern."</p>

  <p>"Excellent! Now don't you worry any more," soothed Dinny, patting the
  emaciated hand. "We'll see you through it."</p>

  <p>Dinny caught a car and hurried back to <i>The Star,</i> eyes bright with
  inspiration, so eager to document his scheme for the easement of good old
  Andrews that it never occurred to him there might also be some
  inquisitiveness on the part of <i>The Daily Eagle</i> concerning this
  mystery. That night, Dinny recognized for the first time unmistakable signs
  of his talent as a potential novelist. He warmed to his task. It was an
  unusual story, and toward the last of it they were snatching unfinished
  sheets out of his typewriter and rushing them, page at a time, to the
  lino-typist.</p>

  <p>Next morning, December twenty-second, subscribers to both papers were
  amazed at the difference between the two accounts of this strange affair.
  According to <i>The Eagle's</i> report&mdash;a mere stick on page
  seven&mdash;Mr. Andrews had accidentally shot himself while endeavouring to
  pot his absent neighbour's noisy dog, a minor injury from which he was
  rapidly recovering.</p>

  <p><i>The Morning Star</i>&mdash;(first page, with a carry to
  three)&mdash;offered a long, dramatic story of Mr. Andrews's heroic silence
  about the shooting. In his delirium, however, the brave old fellow had
  muttered, "Don't shoot again, lad.... I haven't any money except what's there
  in my pocket-book.... You can look, if you like.... Take it&mdash;and hurry
  before somebody comes.... I won't tell on you, boy.... It would break her
  heart."</p>

  <p>From these broken fragments, <i>The Star</i> had adroitly built up a tale
  of romance and adventure impressive enough to stand in the museum alongside
  the mastodon&mdash;all lath and plaster and imagination, except the third
  dorsal vertebra and two molars. Chivalrous old Andrews! Brave old Andrews!
  Attacked in his little home by a marauder, he had recognized the wayward son
  of an old friend.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew, nobody was likely ever to know&mdash;for Andrews seemed
  determined to keep his own counsel&mdash;what a wealth of romance lay
  undisclosed in the heart of this kindly old bachelor. Ambitious as she was to
  print all the news, <i>The Star</i> had quietly withdrawn from the bedside of
  this valiant knight, challenged to match his sportsmanship by declining to
  press the matter any farther.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, industriously distributing big type, Dinny, out of the
  tail of his apprehensive eye, observed the approach of his boss, paper in
  hand. He redoubled his zealous interest in his occupation. Mr. Brophy was at
  his elbow now, but Dinny did not look up. It was a very busy day.</p>

  <p>"My son," said Mr. Brophy, reproachfully, "<i>The Eagle</i> will probably
  try for a goal from the field with your Andrews story, tomorrow morning.
  They'll make us look like a cageful of monkeys."</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking a little about that, too, sir," admitted Dinny,
  confidentially, "but, you see, the tale they tortured out of old Andrews,
  late last night, was concocted in sheer self-defence. He was resolved not to
  tell the straight story, so he made one up, on the spot, to satisfy their
  greedy curiosity. He would have done the same for me, if I had badgered him.
  Takes all the blame on himself! Risks the good opinion of his neighbours,
  risks his job at the shop, throws away the lifelong friendship of Mr.
  McCutcheon.... Shoot McCutcheon's pet? Nonsense! You wait until the people
  see the picture of saintly old Andrews, in bed at the hospital, near death's
  door, staring up out of those big, wistful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hell!&mdash;they're going to discharge him this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I beg your pardon, sir. They had thought of it, but the nurse
  and I agreed it wouldn't do. I was out there and told them <i>The Star</i>
  would pay for all it cost to keep him a week, at least."</p>

  <p>"He won't stay. Even if he does, he'll talk."</p>

  <p>"No, sir. The nurse says his room is rapidly filling up with flowers and
  baskets of fruit. And Mr. Kellerman was there, making a fuss over
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean old man Kellerman?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;president of the Buckeye&mdash;he was there; and Norton of
  <i>The Eagle</i> tried to see him, but Andrews sent down word to him that
  they'd practically forced him to tell them the tale he'd made up. The nurse
  says he likes our version of the affair ever so much better, though he told
  Mr. Kellerman he didn't think it was very sporting of us to print what he
  said while he was unconscious."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'll be damned!"</p>

  <p>"So will Doctor Cummings," drawled Dinny, "for he told me he would. And,
  as for that&mdash;" He hesitated, grinning.</p>

  <p>"So will you, I presume," assisted Mr. Brophy.</p>

  <p>"<i>The Cincinnati Democrat</i> was there, taking pictures, when I
  left."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Brophy, "it's your affair. Carry on with it. This is
  going to call for a lot of expert lying, so I'll let you manage the campaign.
  I've been in the newspaper game for twenty years, my boy, and you're the
  biggest liar I have ever known."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," said Dinny. "D'you think maybe I'd better go out there
  again?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Mr. Brophy. "I think maybe you had; and if old Andrews
  weakens and tells the truth, you needn't ever come back."</p>

  <p>Timmy Fagan had silently joined the party, obviously enjoying himself.</p>

  <p>"Timmy," said Mr. Brophy, "I'm going over to headquarters for a chat with
  Chief O'Brien. I'll be back in half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Timmy, "but it's all right, Mr. Brophy. I was over there
  at noon, and he's called 'em off the case. He sent you this long, black
  cheroot, sir, and said to tell you those greasy Republicans on <i>The
  Eagle</i> could whistle for any more dope on the Andrews shootin'."</p>

  <p>"You editing <i>The Star</i> now, Timmy?" asked Mr. Brophy, lighting the
  gift, dubiously.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir"&mdash;Timmy lowered his voice, confidentially&mdash;"we
  couldn't let th' boy down, sir, seeing it was his first offence. I told the
  chief he was a fine lad, and I'd seen him at Mass, last Sunday."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, Timmy. Brumm's not a Catholic."</p>

  <p>Timmy smiled, omnisciently, and turned toward his stone table. "My Kitty's
  attendin' t' that, sir."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Dinny Brumm's freshmanhood at Magnolia which, at the outset,
  had threatened to be drab and uneventful, was not altogether
  unsatisfactory.</p>

  <p>Startled, after five days, by the realization that he was likely to become
  a lone wolf on a campus where everyone else had entered into budding
  friendships&mdash;his nightly employment, and his boarding at a restaurant in
  town having made it quite impossible for him to be sociable&mdash;Dinny
  resolved to mend matters by spending an hour, late afternoons, on the
  athletic field. He could at least relieve himself of the just accusation that
  he wanted no friends and preferred to go it alone.</p>

  <p>At three o'clock on Wednesday, therefore, he had presented himself at the
  freshman wing of the "training quarters" in the inadequate old gymnasium,
  where, without asking any questions or announcing his purpose, he was
  gleefully welcomed by young Assistant Coach Roberts and the awkward assembly
  of prospective gridiron heroes, the tallest of whom he overtowered.</p>

  <p>His whole time having been occupied by other more important matters, Dinny
  had never taken any active interest in high-school football, but from the
  first moment of his adventure with the pigskin he seemed to have an
  instinctive feel for the game.</p>

  <p>What came later to be referred to by sports writers as his "reckless
  courage", was in evidence that first day, possibly attributable to the fact
  that the savagery of hard tackling, on the open field, appealed to his mood.
  The utter futility of life had laid so low an estimate on the claims of
  personal safety that Dinny was indifferent to bruises or the hazard of broken
  bones.</p>

  <p>When, at five, two teams were lined up by Coach Roberts, Dinny observed
  that the personnel of the combating squads could easily be identified even in
  their muddy, handed-down toggery. As usual, the real people were on one side,
  giving battle to the people who didn't matter much. The real people had
  naturally gravitated, some chemical affinity pulling them together. He found
  himself playing right tackle on the team that didn't matter much. The Pullman
  cars were to recognize the Day Coaches to the extent of assisting them for
  experimental purposes&mdash;to try out their own strength, speed, and
  skill.</p>

  <p>There was quite an accumulation of sentiment in Dinny's mind on that
  subject, and in the ensuing thirty minutes of play he expressed it so
  convincingly that, toward the end of the game&mdash;which attracted a
  vociferous crowd of spectators who found the battle of the "frosh" more
  exciting than the experienced man&oelig;uvres of the varsity on the adjoining
  gridiron&mdash;there seemed to be a unanimity of consent, on the part of the
  opposition, when Dinny took the ball, that he might go down the field with
  it, undetained.</p>

  <p>Perspiring, and secretly exultant, Dinny divested himself of the
  tight-fitting old mole-skins that reeked with the acrid memories of many
  celebrated engagements, his team-mates and foes respectfully assisting. As he
  left the gymnasium, he found himself walking alongside Barney Vaughn, against
  whom he had played in the line. Barney was friendly, inquisitive. Where had
  Brumm been keeping himself?</p>

  <p>"You must drop in and see me," said Barney. "I'm at the Custer Cottage,
  Sunnyside Avenue. That's where the Sig pledges live, you know."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I didn't know where they lived," said Dinny. "I don't even know
  what 'Sig pledges' are," he added. "Red-headed ones, maybe?"</p>

  <p>Barney ran his fingers through his untidy mop of burnished bronze, and
  laughed. Then he was serious.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet somebody's been getting your goat, Brumm. You played like it. My
  Uncle! but you were a brute. Look at that elbow o' mine, will you?"</p>

  <p>They overtook a couple of seniors, strolling back toward the
  campus&mdash;seniors of the Pullman car variety.</p>

  <p>"Yeah," one was drawling, "the barbs were running circles around 'em. Who
  is this Brumm fellow, anyway? How come we heard nothing about him? Hell of a
  scouting committee we've got, this year."</p>

  <p>"That's what comes of letting the Sophs attend to it," replied the other.
  "We'd better have Bristol look this bruiser up, and tow him into camp."</p>

  <p>Barney winked, companionably, at Dinny, as they passed the self-assured
  strollers.</p>

  <p>"Stock going up, eh?" chaffed Barney out of the side of his mouth. "Couple
  o' my brethren, those ginks."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you speak to them?"</p>

  <p>"Frosh aren't supposed to: you knew that, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Democratic little school, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>At the foot of the slope, their ways separated. Barney urgently renewed
  his invitation. Dinny evasively mumbled excuses: no time to visit, nose to
  the grindstone. Thanks, all the same, old man. See you tomorrow.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On Friday morning, as Dinny entered the rapidly filling
  classroom of Professor Grover, and looked about for a vacant chair, the long
  arm and beckoning fingers of Barney Vaughn summoned him to a seat in the back
  row, where he was received with friendly smiles. He realized at a glance that
  he was in a Pullman car.</p>

  <p>Professor Grover, who did not have to eat a whole egg to determine whether
  it was bad&mdash;a quip he often repeated without bothering to enclose it in
  inverted commas&mdash;reported that the papers submitted on Tuesday were, in
  the main, satisfactory. They would be returned, with notations, to their
  makers, at the close of the hour. (On the back of the last page of his essay,
  in red ink, Dinny read, later, "well conceived, meritorious for perspicacity,
  clarity, and force.")</p>

  <p>However, pursued Professor Grover, deliberately, it was not to be supposed
  that all the papers were of equal value; and, for the benefit of those who
  hadn't quite caught the idea, he would ask that one of the more excellent
  themes be read at this time.</p>

  <p>Experience had taught him&mdash;Professor Grover pulled a benevolent
  smile&mdash;that it was usually embarrassing to the author when called upon
  to read his own piece aloud to the class. He would therefore request&mdash;he
  adjusted his glasses and glanced down at the unfamiliar roster&mdash;he would
  therefore request Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Adams to read the paper he had chosen
  as among the best.</p>

  <p>A bit flustered, Miss Adams detached herself from her immediate
  environment, rather self-consciously approached the sanctum with much nervous
  jingling of bracelets, bangles, and other light hardware, faced her audience
  rosily, and began to intone her unknown classmate's anthem of praise to
  Magnolia in a dulcet tone so cooingly mellifluous that covert grins were
  exchanged among the more sophisticated.</p>

  <p>Barney Vaughn leaned toward Dinny, pressed the back of his hand against
  the side of his mouth, and whispered, unctuously, "Gawd is love."</p>

  <p>Dinny grinned, feebly.</p>

  <p>The tender passion of the impromptu score which Miss Adams was fervently
  attaching to the sticky sweetness of the libretto produced a strange effect
  upon the class. By the time she had turned the first page, the dullest dolt
  in the room had his open palm against his mouth, apparently engaged in a
  battle for air.</p>

  <p>Professor Grover smiled, hopefully, as if promising that it would
  eventually come out all right, and moved slowly back and forth in his chair,
  his outspread hands rhythmically rubbing his knees. It was easy to see,
  however, that he was worried. He had only read into this piously grateful
  tribute to the college far enough to see that it was definitely committed to
  a loyalty of high degree. He hadn't noticed, at the moment, that it was quite
  so superlatively silly as it now appeared, set to the sloppily sentimental
  adagio affected by Miss Adams, whose mark for the semester's work in English
  Composition he had now determined upon in terms of three flats.</p>

  <p>Dinny's flair for satire was not an achievement, but a gift. He had not
  deliberately planned the early pages of his impressions of Magnolia with a
  view to disarming the reader in order, later, to smite him with a volley of
  ridicule.</p>

  <p>About midway of page four, it became evident in the mounting flush and
  occasional hesitations of Miss Adams that even she, herself, infatuated as
  she was with her elocution, had begun to suspect the increasing digression of
  the text from the melody, and realized the enormity of the farce to which she
  was unwittingly contributing the ultimate touch that gave it perfection.</p>

  <p>She was reading now the early impressions of the freshman as he watched
  the masterful manner in which the rubber stamp was affixed to impressive
  documents, the stony stare of experienced officials which heightened the
  newcomer's respect for a college of such magnitude that its most
  insignificant underlings felt the dignity and superiority of their honoured
  trust, the crispness of their laconic "Next window, please, for that."</p>

  <p>Barney inclined toward Dinny, at this juncture, and guardedly whispered,
  eyes intent upon the reader, "Somebody's been pulling the old man's leg," to
  which the awe-stricken Dinny added, absently, "The paralysed one."</p>

  <p>They were hearing now about the democracy of a friendly little college,
  the one place in the world where social caste was regarded with the scorn it
  properly deserved in the opinion of all people to whom the Almighty had
  vouchsafed even the bare elements of humour.</p>

  <p>Dinny sighed, rubbed his red cheek, and reflected that his essay was quite
  too long. The class must be frightfully tired of it by this time. He glanced
  at Professor Grover and imagined that the roving eye flashed him a baleful
  threat of hard times. Pulling himself together and affecting nonchalance, he
  turned cautiously to Barney and remarked, lips barely moving:</p>

  <p>"The old boy should have eaten one more spoonful of this egg before he
  served it."</p>

  <p>Barney thoughtfully dug deep in a trouser pocket and came up with a
  penny.</p>

  <p>"This says you laid it," gambled Barney.</p>

  <p>"Vulgar display," whispered Dinny, loftily.</p>

  <p>Professor Grover was fussily rummaging through the pile of papers.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Adams," he broke in, huskily.</p>

  <p>Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Adams lowered the paper and looked up for further
  orders.</p>

  <p>"I think we have heard enough of this essay, now, to gather what must have
  been in the mind of the writer. It seemed only fair that any slight
  irritation or disappointment should be recognized. Happily, such sentiments
  are held by a very small minority. Magnolia does not assume responsibility
  for the irascibility of newcomers who expect immediate preferments.... We
  have here another paper written in a better temper, which I shall ask Mr.
  Bristol to kindly read.... Thank you, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Adams."</p>

  <p>"'To kindly read,'" observed Barney, "shows the old thing to be human,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>Dinny wiped his brow, and nodded with the pensiveness of a convalescent
  consenting to a proffered pill; then rallied enough to reply, wanly:</p>

  <p>"This must be a rough day on the sea."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">During the first two months of Dinny's residence in
  Magnolia, Kitty Fagan frequently had occasion to come to <i>The Star,</i>
  early evenings, with important messages for her father, the delivery of which
  would be but the work of a moment.</p>

  <p>Not wishing to appear ungracious toward Timmy's lonesome young friend, she
  would wave a hand, fingers twinkling; and Dinny, resolutely blind to the
  amused interest of a score distracted from their gainful occupations in the
  composing-room, would meet her halfway to his case and amblingly accompany
  her to the door where they would pause and chat amiably for a moment. He
  always worked half an hour overtime, on his own hook, to make sure he had not
  visited with Kitty at the expense of the company.</p>

  <p>By the middle of November, Kitty's emergency messages for her father had
  all been delivered, and <i>The Star,</i> suddenly bereft of these pleasant
  interludes scheduled to be played about eight-thirty, twice a week, became
  mildly curious.</p>

  <p>Bert Snyder, on machine No. 1, observing Dinny emerging from the coat-room
  at ten, sharp, one night, dressed for the street, re-lit his corn-cob pipe,
  tossed a hot slug bearing the cryptic phrase "etaoin shrdlu" into the
  bubbling pot, and ventured his guess to Stub Harley, on No. 2, that Timmy had
  advised her not to come up any more. Stub thought it more likely that Mr.
  Brophy had set down on it. Pinky Gormer, assistant telegraph, hung a few
  smeary pages on each of their hooks, and bet there had been a quarrel.... But
  nobody knew and, after a little while, nobody cared.</p>

  <p>On the fourth consecutive Sunday at the Fagans', Dinny realized that he
  was being gradually, unprotestingly assimilated. Noting that the living-room
  which gave directly on to the front porch was unoccupied, he did not rap on
  the screen-door, but opened it and made his way through to the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"We heard you coming, Dinny," said Mrs. Fagan, too intent on the
  beautifully browned chicken she was taking from the oven to give him better
  attention than a fleeting smile. "I can't think what's come over that
  gate."</p>

  <p>"Where's the oil-can?" inquired Dinny. "I'll touch it up."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Kitty, putting down the bowl of whipping cream.</p>

  <p>"Let him find it himself.... It's up on the sewing-machine, Dinny, in the
  back room." Mrs. Fagan vigorously beat the potatoes. "Don't look around in
  there. It hasn't been picked up."</p>

  <p>Timmy met him halfway up the stairs, and said it was too warm for a
  coat.</p>

  <p>Kitty's attitude became proprietary.</p>

  <p>"Dinny doesn't want that much sugar in his tea.... Dinny mustn't have
  another piece of pie, father. It's bad for his wind. If we're going to make
  the team, we'll have to go easy on the pie.... Dinny, we really must look
  after those poor fingers: that nasty acid. Can't they use something else on
  their dirty old type?"</p>

  <p>On the fifth Sunday, Dinny met the four of them on the imposing front
  steps of Saint Vincent at eleven o'clock. It was his first experience in a
  Catholic church. He knew next to nothing about that institution, and
  suspected that what little he did know was untrue. Of course, he took no
  stock in his own family's estimate of it, aware that their passionate
  prejudice had been slowly percolated through a filter of ignorance and
  contempt&mdash;a musty old filter clogged with nearly four centuries of
  gritty deposits precipitated from neighbourhood brawls and border wars.</p>

  <p>In the questionable judgment of Uncle Miles, whose proud boast it was that
  his feet had never crossed the threshold of "Rome," the Pope was "the
  Anti-Christ." Dinny had but a vague idea who "the Anti-Christ" was, beyond
  his natural deduction that it was a cryptic epithet never employed in eulogy.
  Aunt Martha maintained that practically all Catholic churches were secret
  arsenals, their subterranean grottoes stuffed with rifles and ammunition. She
  wagged her head ominously when she predicted the day of "a great uprisin'
  that'll make th' rivers run red." This was, on the face of it, mere drivel
  and nonsense. You could tell, because the rivers were to run red. Aunt Martha
  was always quite definitely off the rails when she talked in terms of red or
  any of the collateral hues. She always got excited, hysterical, and
  incoherent when she discoursed on Sin, which was scarlet, or Salvation, which
  was crimson.</p>

  <p>As they mounted the church steps, pressed close on either side by pilgrims
  of all sorts, Dinny felt himself a member of the Fagan family. There was
  something tender and intimate in this new relationship. He would sit in the
  Fagan pew. He would belong to them, for an hour, in bonds of a common
  wistfulness. Not that he expected to get much out of it further than the
  satisfaction of sitting quietly with them. Doubtless he and Kitty would share
  a hymn-book. There would be a long, tiresome sermon, but they would not have
  to listen to it. Perhaps he would touch Kitty's fingers, when the clergyman
  inveighed against some sport or pleasure and they would steal a pious glance
  at each other, tongue in cheek.</p>

  <p>The instant they entered the dim, vasty nave, Dinny found himself quite
  alone. His Fagans had vanished, their places taken by four strangers who
  suddenly went about the business of dipping finger-tips in the huge marble
  shell, touching themselves with an adroitness that could not possibly have
  been achieved through experience, but must be accounted for by some instinct
  which Dinny knew he did not possess.</p>

  <p>The supple grace of their genuflections set them apart from him and all
  his kind. The only movement he had ever seen, comparable to it for artless
  dexterity, was the sweep of a lithe tiger's breast against the bars as it
  reached the end of its brief journey and turned to pad softly but
  determinedly to the other corner of the cage.</p>

  <p>He followed these people, dressed like the Fagans, halfway down the broad
  aisle, where, pausing, they dipped again, not by conscious effort, but as if
  each of them had been gripped by some current flowing from the wood of the
  pew-end, so that when their fingers touched it, they
  responded&mdash;galvanically.</p>

  <p>Kitty glanced sideways and offered him a fragment of a smile&mdash;a mere,
  transparently thin cross-section of a smile&mdash;as she slipped swiftly from
  the seat to her knees beside Pat and her parents. Dinny lumberingly joined
  her on the bare narrow rail on which they knelt, ashamed of his awkwardness.
  Adjusting his joints with much difficulty, he distributed his weight so that
  his elbows on the top of the pew might ease the discomfort of his knees. When
  all this had been attended to, he glanced down at the profile of the rapt
  face beside him. The smart little white hat with the blue ribbon looked very
  much like Kitty's hat. The firm, round, white chin was amazingly like Kitty's
  lovely chin. The steady fingers, gently moving from one bead to another on
  her rosary, resembled Kitty's competent fingers. But Kitty had escaped. This
  girl beside Dinny was a foreigner. Kitty and Pat and good old Timmy and
  hospitable Mrs. Fagan had left him forlorn, chagrined, and lonely on the
  beach while they, diving with the skill and precision of graceful seals, had
  whisked away into their Sea.</p>

  <p>Kneeling thus on the hard pebbled beach of that mysterious Sea in which
  the Fagans were so confidently at home, the sublimity of it all began to lay
  hold on Dinny Brumm. He realized now that something inside him had been
  calling, faintly but urgently, all his life, demanding exercise, sustenance,
  liberty; something aquatic that couldn't walk on the hard ground.</p>

  <p>They were back in their seats now, but the mesmeric spell did not lift.
  They rose, they sat, they bowed, they crossed themselves with sure, deft
  strokes, Dinny trying to keep pace with them in the rising, and sitting, and
  kneeling, feeling himself a mere stumbling baby trudging with short, drunken
  steps in the wake of experienced track-sprinters.</p>

  <p>Now the congregation hummed briefly with swiftly flowing, unintelligible
  fragments of liquid sentences, sentences prodded out of it by stately
  challenges addressed to the great white and gold and flickering altar by an
  ornately garbed figure. The celebrant was attended by small boys in
  vestments, who needed no telling what to do, boys who anticipated each
  impending phase of the ancient drama, boys whose very backs seemed to disdain
  such childish fripperies as marbles, tops, and kites, having forsaken all
  that was secular to pledge their life to all that was sacred.</p>

  <p>Presently it occurred to Dinny that these strangers whose pew he shared
  might be as well pleased with their guest if he made no further ridiculous
  attempts to imitate them in their worship. The next time they sat, he
  resolved to remain seated.</p>

  <p>He looked about. It was the first occasion on which the Gothic had ever
  spoken to him directly. The Gothic beckoned him to attempt a spiritual
  journey.</p>

  <p>Dinny's eyes rested on the beautiful window nearest him, a multi-coloured
  window crowded with brave events upheld and flanked by miniatures of enhaloed
  saints&mdash;enraptured saints bearing massive keys and open books, bearded
  saints leading submissive lions, beardless saints led by victorious lambs
  with a fore-foot sustaining a shouldered banner; crowns and crests, shields
  and swords, cups and censers, purple grapes and yellow wheat-sheaves, and
  hilltops tipped with spires.</p>

  <p>His eyes travelled up until the window narrowed to a pointed arch that led
  the way to the base of a flying buttress. He gave himself willingly to its
  graceful curve, and followed along past innumerable sign-posts&mdash;all
  pointing up... Up... <i>Up!</i>&mdash;each arch, and tip, and spire daring
  him to leap to another... higher... Higher... <i>Higher!</i>&mdash;until
  visibility was lost in the shadows overhead.</p>

  <p>Perhaps that was the way Religion really ought to be, thought Dinny. No
  wonder the Catholics had lasted so long without the necessity of change,
  reorganization, reappraisals. The old Church invited you to look up. That was
  all she asked. She made no promises that she could reveal the Ultimate. It
  was up to you... how far you could see. You looked up&mdash;and the Church
  carried you from one aspiring arch to another until you could go no farther,
  not because the arches ended, up there, but because your frail sight could no
  longer follow them into the Mystery whose depths they plumbed.</p>

  <p>Meantime, the rhythmic tide of the venerable ritual came rolling, rumbling
  on in strong, confident waves&mdash;music out of a Past that was also a
  Future; music that took no account of infinitesimal weeks and months, but
  dealt with a thousand years as if it were only a day; music that never even
  glanced down to see whether you were following an ox-drawn plough or
  addressing parliament from a throne, much less noticed whether you rode in a
  Day Coach or a Pullman; spoken music, drifting from within the chancel,
  chanted music, drifting from the choir overhead.</p>

  <p>For a period there was much made of a small jewelled case, set into the
  altar; hushed silences bounded by the silvery tinkle of a bell; deep, deep
  reverence between the silvery tinkle of the bell.</p>

  <p>The sweetish-brownish aroma of incense hung in the air, invisible in the
  nave, though above the heads of the celebrants it drifted like a torn
  tapestry&mdash;a very old, brownish-grey tapestry. To Dinny's unaccustomed
  nostrils the elusive scent was an indissoluble combination of mingled appeals
  to the most spiritual of all the senses. He tried without success to analyse
  its weird effects upon his imagination. At first it seemed to possess a
  certain medicinal quality&mdash;faintly stimulative. No&mdash;it was not a
  stimulant, but an exultant, insisting upon the exultation produced by calm
  acceptance, confident repose.</p>

  <p>There was something primitive about it, too; something woodsy, as if it
  exuded from the enshadowing trees beneath whose branches valiant men of old
  had knelt to worship&mdash;trees which the Gothic had preserved in stone....
  Dinny wondered what strange magic the incense was conjuring in the trained,
  consecrated nostrils of the transported Fagans.</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha had scorned the institution that tried to worship in a heathen
  language.</p>

  <p>"Nothing but gibberish!" declared Aunt Martha, who knew only her mother
  tongue, and that imperfectly.</p>

  <p>Dinny did not find it so. In the mounting radicalism of eighteen plus
  disillusionment, he was ready to do bumptious battle with any detailed
  invoice of "I believes," hawked in the language of the clearing-house and the
  market-place. But there was a sudden tightening of the throat, a burning of
  the eyelids, when the sonorous phrases came welling forth from the dimly lit
  chancel:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"><i>Et in Jesum Christum... Dominum nostrum... qui conceptus
  est de Spiritu sancto... natus ex Maria Virgine...</i></p><br>

  <p>You didn't have to believe it: you just knew it was true.</p>

  <p>His eyes groped into the vaulted roof. Up there, out there, beyond
  there&mdash;what? When you had it all explained for you in the patter of the
  machine-shop, the language of the garage, the department-store, the football
  field, you waved it away and muttered, "Stuff and nonsense!" It was a
  different matter when sung to you in an otherwise unused tongue, through an
  aromatic veil of incense:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"><i>carnis resurrectionem... vitam æternam!...</i></p><br>

  <p>That was the glory, then, of this Catholic religion. It didn't ask to be
  understood, as Chemistry asks to be understood.</p>

  <p>Perhaps that was the whole trouble with Uncle Miles's religion. It
  explained everything, succeeding only in making itself absurd. Its
  speculations were hard-and-fast facts to be weighed on the scales, poured
  into a test-tube, shaken over a flame.</p>

  <p>Not much wonder, thought Dinny, this Catholicism had carried on.... Every
  so often, turbulent little sects had spewed themselves out through the heavy
  bronze doors of cathedrals to quarrel and dogmatize; obliged, when their fury
  was spent, to build cheap and ugly little imitations of the eternal thing
  from which they in their wilfulness had fled.</p>

  <p>Every new generation of the self-outcast had revised the imitation. Never
  were they done tinkering with it, reconditioning it, modernizing it, making
  it over "to meet the new day." And&mdash;meantime&mdash;while their most
  progressive engineers dug deep under the thing to install new heating,
  climbed high on the thing to equip it with a tighter roof, repainted it,
  relandscaped it&mdash;The Everlasting Church stood fast!... <i>"sanctum
  Ecclesiam Catholicam!"</i></p>

  <p>That was the Sea!</p>

  <p>All the time the inquisitive and heady were busily building their little
  dams, and draining their miasmic ponds, and changing the courses of their
  impotent, muddy, little creeks, the Sea had steadily throbbed to the tune of
  the stars without so much as a by-your-leave to any earthly powers. That Sea
  did not even pause to smile at the snarls and fist-shakings of the engineers.
  The Sea did not know they existed!... Dinny Brumm devoutly hoped he could
  learn to navigate that Sea. He went out of Saint Vincent's, into the October
  sunshine, tentatively committed to the great experiment.</p>

  <p>"How did you like it?" asked Kitty, smiling a little, but wide-eyed with
  genuine concern.</p>

  <p>"I really can't talk about it, Kitty," he murmured.</p>

  <p>She grasped his arm for a moment, and patted his sleeve lightly.</p>

  <p>"<i>'Dominus vobiscum,'</i> Dinny!" recited Kitty, gently, gratefully.</p>

  <p>"What do I say now&mdash;anything?"</p>

  <p>"You say, <i>'Et cum spiritu tuo,'</i> Dinny."</p>

  <p>He repeated the words after her, adding, "dear."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That afternoon&mdash;a golden-russet, burnt-sienna
  afternoon&mdash;they climbed the high hill overlooking the city park. The
  southerly slope of the hill was a cemetery. It was a full quarter-mile to the
  nearest white stones; a half-mile to the broad granite arch of the
  old-worldish gateway flanked on either side with clumps of cypress trees.</p>

  <p>Dinny was reflective, eyes moody, lips pursed, as he reclined on an elbow,
  Kitty sitting cross-legged beside him, endeavouring to punctuate the long
  silences with sprightly talk.</p>

  <p>"Wise old owl," she pouted, "come out of your trance."</p>

  <p>Their eyes turned toward the cemetery gate, far below. Some secret order
  in uniform was creeping along, led by a brass band, en route to bury a
  brother... Chopin's Funeral March... As the band passed under the broad stone
  arch and through the cypress trees, a whole half-dozen measures were
  completely obliterated. Kitty supplied the missing passage, keeping time with
  martial bobs of her bare black head, her pretty cheeks distended as if she
  blew the notes on the big, shining tuba that presently led the way out into
  the sun.</p>

  <p>"Pumm, pum-te-pumm, pum-te-pum, te-pum, te-pum," pummed Kitty,
  soberly.</p>

  <p>The cortège was marching out into the glow, now, but the dirge was still
  in the gloom, candidly hopeless of anything to come of this dignified
  enterprise further than the wretched anti-climax of ropes and shovels and the
  bouncing of clods on a box.</p>

  <p>Dinny lay outstretched on his back, gazing straight up, listening to the
  wisps of the despairing march which Kitty continued to accompany, softly. Now
  it was quite stilled again for an instant, while the band rounded the other
  side of a massive cliff. Presently there swept up the hill a great wave of
  hope. "Nevertheless!" sang the dirge. <i>"Nevertheless</i>&mdash;I tell
  you!"</p>

  <p>Kitty scrambled to her knees, facing Dinny, her eyes bright, dancing, her
  pretty teeth sparkling, keeping time with both hands, fingers outspread,
  chanting, happily:</p>

  <p><i>"Tra-la</i>&mdash;<i>Tra-la</i>&mdash;<i>la-la-la-
  la</i>&mdash;<i>la</i>&mdash;<i>tra-la" ...</i></p>

  <p>"You actually believe that; don't you?"</p>

  <p>"That it's going to come out all right? Sure! Of course! Don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I think I do... when... when it's said in Latin."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite get you, Dinny."</p>

  <p>"Well," he drawled, dreamily, "I think the belief in everlasting life is
  silly... but <i>'vitam æternam'</i> is sound."</p>

  <p>"Funny boy!" laughed Kitty. "Old owl!"</p>

  <p>Then he told her almost everything he had thought about, that morning in
  church. On the way down the hill, she promised to ask Father Donovan for some
  little books he might read, though Dinny was not sure he wanted them.</p>

  <p>"I'm contented," he said. "Besides&mdash;I would have trouble reading
  them. Latin's tedious... in large quantities."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;but this will not be in Latin," explained Kitty.</p>

  <p>"Maybe we'd better leave well enough alone," said Dinny, thoughtfully.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Two disquieting books came into Dinny's hands, within three
  hours of each other, on the next Thursday night.</p>

  <p>The first was lent by Father Donovan and delivered into the hands of
  Dinny, at his case, by Kitty Fagan&mdash;a book he opened at one a.m., in his
  room, and perused for a scant five minutes. Then he closed it with a snap. He
  had read the English&mdash;the modern, workaday English, under the pitiless
  glare of electric light&mdash;the English explanation of The Mysteries.</p>

  <p>Here was the "Profession of Faith" for converts:</p>

  <p>"I., N. N., having before me the holy gospels, which I touch with my hand
  and knowing that no one can be saved without that faith which the Holy,
  Catholic, Apostolic Roman Church holds, believes, and teaches, against which
  I grieve that I have greatly erred&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dinny ran his eye down the page:</p>

  <p>"I believe in one only God in three divine Persons, distinct from, and
  equal to, each other&mdash;that is to say, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
  Ghost."</p>

  <p>How often he had heard Uncle Miles tangle himself up in the labyrinthian
  mazes of this incomprehensible "three in one" business&mdash;as if it
  mattered; as if anybody knew.</p>

  <p>"I believe in the true, real and substantial presence of the Body and
  Blood, together with the Soul and Divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
  most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist."</p>

  <p>That's what the little jewelled case was about. The Lord Jesus Christ was
  in there. They took Him out, and then put Him back in again.... Uncle Miles
  had some queer ideas, too; but&mdash;</p>

  <p>The rest of it Dinny merely glanced at.</p>

  <p>"I believe in the seven Sacraments...</p>

  <p>"I believe in Purgatory...</p>

  <p>"I believe in the Primacy, not only of honour, but of jurisdiction, of the
  Roman Pontiff, successor of Saint Peter, Prince of the Apostles...</p>

  <p>"I believe in the veneration of the Saints and of their images."</p>

  <p>"And"&mdash;the book was closing now, and in an instant it would be shut
  with a sharp slap&mdash;"I believe in everything else that has been defined
  and declared by the sacred Canons and the General Councils, and particularly
  by the Council of Trent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dinny didn't know what the "Council of Trent" was, but it was with the
  "Council of Trent" that his spiritual exploration terminated. It was seven
  years before he smelled incense again.</p>

  <p>He undressed, and went to bed with the book Mr. Brophy had lent him at
  midnight. Mr. Brophy had asked him along to lunch, for on Thursday nights he
  always worked overtime, ads being heavy in the Friday morning edition of
  <i>The Star.</i></p>

  <p>They went to Clancy's, which closed at eleven, in accordance with the law,
  and remained open until one to accommodate the Fourth Estate, certain other
  discreet, and Sergeant O'Shane, who paused at Mr. Brophy's table to exchange
  the customary:</p>

  <p>"Annything new, Misther Brophy?"</p>

  <p>"More fighting in Ireland, Sergeant; that's all."</p>

  <p>"And that's not news, Misther Brophy."</p>

  <p>"Dinny," said Mr. Brophy, when Clancy, himself, had put down on the bare
  table a plate of Swiss cheese, rye bread, and two steins of beer, "did you
  ever read Hardy's <i>Jude the Obscure?</i>"</p>

  <p>Dinny, his mouth full, shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'll lend it to you," said Mr. Brophy, taking the book from his pocket
  and pushing it across the table.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," mumbled Dinny. "What's it about?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Brophy made up a cheese sandwich, painstakingly.</p>

  <p>"It's about a tremendously ambitious youngster who wanted a college
  education, so he could be somebody, and threw a wrench into the machine by
  marrying out of his class."</p>

  <p>"And so he didn't get to be anybody?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't even get a college education."</p>

  <p>"Why do you want me to read it, Mr. Brophy?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Brophy shrugged a shoulder.</p>

  <p>"It will do you good to get acquainted with Thomas Hardy... vigorous
  style... sound workman."</p>

  <p>In bed, now, with the book, Dinny became absorbed in the tribulations of
  Jude's boyhood&mdash;strikingly like his own, in spots. He read until four,
  lowered the book, stared for a long time at the wall, sighed deeply, and
  turned out the light. It had been a long day. Dinny had grown much older,
  since sunrise.</p>

  <p>That no bones were made about the purely philanthropic nature of this
  affair was blandly certified by the technique of recruiting its guests. The
  bulletin boards, a few days in advance, announced that if these stranded
  would make themselves known to the Y.M. and Y.W. secretaries, they would
  receive personal invitations.</p>

  <p>It was easily to be deduced, from the character of the agencies thus
  serving as a clearing-house for this social function, that its guest-list
  would consist largely if not wholly of barbs; for, almost without exception,
  the fraternity and sorority element had no truck with the Y.M. or Y.W. beyond
  the dollar perfunctorily disgorged during the early October campaign for
  their maintenance. The Greeks were not, as a rule, religious.</p>

  <p>Tradition held that these Yuletide festivities, however praiseworthy in
  their altruistic intent, lacked brilliance. Indeed, when a seasoned
  Magnolian&mdash;whether Greek or barbarian&mdash;was hard pressed for a
  simile adequate to bound some experience of boredom <i>in extremis,</i> he
  was apt to liken it to the Braithwaites' Christmas Party, even if he had
  never attended one himself and might have added but little to its
  incandescence if he had. Dinny had missed the affair, a year ago, truthfully
  offering the excuse&mdash;though he could have invented one&mdash;that he was
  obliged to work at that hour.</p>

  <p>Nothing was more remote from his intention than attendance at this year's
  Christmas conviviality in the big, square, dormer-windowed, brick house which
  dominated this end of Sunnyside Avenue, dignifiedly aloof from the long row
  of Greek chapter houses&mdash;for it was set in spacious grounds&mdash;but
  obviously mothering them and sharing with them the same Strozzi lamp-posts in
  the broad green parking, four to the block, on either side, as if the Old
  Lady, upon installing hers, had said they might as well provide similarly for
  the children.</p>

  <p>But it now turned out that Dinny was to be one of the guests at the annual
  barbarian spread.</p>

  <p>Encountering President Braithwaite, whom he sincerely admired, Dinny
  impulsively pledged himself to attend the feast. They had met in the almost
  deserted hall of the Administration Building on the morning of the
  twenty-second. The college session had closed.</p>

  <p>"Not going home, Brumm?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; not this time, sir."</p>

  <p>Dinny did not feel it necessary to add that he was done going home; never
  expected to go home again; had, in fact, no home to go to since the receipt
  of Angela's astounding letter, a month ago, easing her burdened soul of a
  confession that, while rummaging in her father's desk, she had discovered
  evidences of long-continued misappropriation of funds rightfully
  Dinny's&mdash;a defalcation in which Aunt Martha was a silent but culpable
  accomplice. Angela, deeply stirred in a revival staged by the celebrated
  "Buster" Brown and the incomparable song-leader, "Merry" Merriweather, had
  experienced "the third work"&mdash;an altitudinous degree of sanctification
  involving the wholesale confession of sins, venial and mortal, in which
  salutary enterprise she had, after a manner of speaking, spilled the
  beans.</p>

  <p>"The money," wrote Angela, in an affected back-hand on reeking pink paper,
  "must have stopped coming about two years ago.</p>

  <p>"I think my father must have begun to be scared, about that time. Your
  father probably wanted to arrange to send you to college, though I couldn't
  find that letter in the package.</p>

  <p>"The only one on that was dated more than two years ago. It was written on
  a New York Central train. It said, 'If it is true my son has no inclination
  to go to college and has a good job and bitterly resents any further help
  from me, there is nothing more to do.'"</p>

  <p>Savage with indignation, Dinny rapidly composed and destroyed a half-dozen
  letters&mdash;three to the rascally old Uncle Miles; two, slightly less
  ironical, to pious Aunt Martha; concluding with a real masterpiece of
  shocking sacrilege to the thrice-blest Angela. Having thus documented his
  sentiments in regard to the elementary decencies, and the mysterious ways of
  Providence in delegating the propagation of sweetness and light to
  ambassadors so nonchalant on the subject of common integrity, he screwed the
  cap back on his fountain-pen, and called it a day's work.</p>

  <p>Presuming, correctly, that Angela's purgation demanded her having it out
  with Uncle Miles and Aunt Martha, Dinny thought he would wait until these
  unctuous defaulters had had time to concoct some ingenious explanation. But
  they, judging by their silence, were waiting for his offensive; so,
  communication was cut off. As Christmas neared, it occurred to him that,
  aside from the greeting cards he meant to mail to Mr. Brophy, old Peter
  Andrews, and the Fagans (whom he rarely visited now, Kitty having impatiently
  transferred her affections to young Mike Slattery, a handsome and promising
  department manager in the Crystal Laundry), he had no occasion for shopping.
  Dinny hoped Aunt Martha would not trouble herself to send him anything. But
  it would be quite like her to do so&mdash;a sappy book of preachments,
  perhaps, written, published, and peddled by the Reverend Bouncing Bilgewater,
  or some such moron.</p>

  <p>"Then you will be coming to our Christmas dinner," said the President,
  genially.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir," declared Dinny, with grateful enthusiasm. "Thank you very
  much, Doctor Braithwaite."</p>

  <p>Almost from his first day, Dinny had found himself wondering how little
  Magnolia, so narrow and reactionary, had invited a man of President
  Braithwaite's broad sympathies and urbanity to direct her affairs. And how
  had Doctor Braithwaite ever persuaded himself to lead a cause so
  unpromising?</p>

  <p>It was common knowledge on the campus&mdash;even the freshmen chattered
  it&mdash;that the President was in hot water, the conservatives furnishing
  the fuel. The President had been elected for his skill as a money-getter. But
  for that he would have been ousted long ago. But for that he would never have
  been called from the Financial Secretaryship of little Minton, in Wisconsin,
  a despairing toy college that he had rescued from the grave. Minton had
  called him to that job in the very nick of time to save him from a heresy
  trial at the instigation of his Conference. As a minister, he had been too
  modern, nobody but the young people following him.</p>

  <p>"Everybody knows&mdash;" Orville Kling, still Dinny's dormitory neighbour,
  and now President of the Y., had come over, last week, to borrow a pot of
  mucilage; for, as Religious Editor of <i>The Blossom,</i> he was always out
  of paste. "Everybody knows," declaimed Kling, fresh from a meeting of his
  cabinet, in which Doctor Braithwaite had been put in the pan, "that he's an
  out-and-out higher critic!"</p>

  <p>"Critic of what?" inquired Dinny, absently, intent on the trail of an
  irregular verb in his Greek lexicon, "Critic of <i>what?"</i> he repeated,
  "and higher than <i>who?"</i></p>

  <p>"You wait!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Disdaining the persiflage, Kling slowly closed one eye and tipped his head
  far back, hinting at inside information he dared not reveal.</p>

  <p>"You just wait until Braithwaite has finished this two-year drive for the
  Half-Million Endowment Fund. The Board will give him his walking papers!"</p>

  <p>"Not very sporting, I should say," observed Dinny.</p>

  <p>Kling hooked a leg over the corner of Dinny's table, rested an elbow on
  his knee, and beat time to his oracle with an impressive forefinger.</p>

  <p>"The conservation of Christian faith," he intoned, "is not a sporting
  proposition."</p>

  <p>"I had noticed that," drawled Dinny, not very pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"What I say is," continued Kling, warming, "if Braithwaite wants to make a
  dash for this so-called liberty of religious thought, let him do it&mdash;but
  not while he's on the pay-roll of an orthodox institution."</p>

  <p>"Like Martin Luther, for instance?" queried Dinny.</p>

  <p>"That's quite a different matter," growled Kling, pacing to the window and
  backing up defensively against the sill, "Luther, as it happened, was
  right!"</p>

  <p>"But the conservatives didn't think so," amended Dinny, "or did they? I'm
  not very well posted on that."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't suppose you are," muttered Kling, meaningly, "though you
  ought to be, considering your background."</p>

  <p>Dinny impetuously pushed back his chair, and was on the point of offering
  a sarcastic discrimination between "background" and "back-fire," but thought
  better of it, and turned again to his lexicon.</p>

  <p>Kling strode heatedly toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Here," said Dinny, "you've forgotten the mucilage."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Kling, stiffly, "I think I can find some."</p>

  <p>"Sure you can find your scissors?" teased Dinny, grinning.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think that's witty, son." Kling had his hand on the
  knob.</p>

  <p>"I think it's a scream, Brother Kling," retorted Dinny, <i>"all of
  it!</i>&mdash;the Board of Directors, Christian faith, home background, the
  Y.M.C.A., <i>The Blossom's</i> Religious Column, and&mdash;and the paste-pot
  and the scissors!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door banged with a resounding wallop.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and you, too," finished Dinny, addressing the infuriated footsteps
  in the hall. "You're a scream, too!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At three, still uncomfortable over his promise to attend the
  Christmas party, which was going to be dull with an exceeding great dullness,
  no matter how the Braithwaites might tear their hair to make it interesting,
  Dinny went skating in the park.</p>

  <p>There was nothing he enjoyed so much. The day was perfect, air crisp,
  tonic, the sky turquoise, the sun bright.</p>

  <p>He recognized no one on the pond, but it required no company to complete
  his satisfaction.</p>

  <p>With long, lazy strokes, he traversed the quarter-mile longitudinal
  stretch of the steel-blue lagoon, delighting in the ease of a locomotion that
  always gave him the sensation of flying. There was a unique exhilaration in
  the ability to let oneself go; to lean back confidently on the promise of
  that strange centrifugal energy developed by "the outer edge roll"&mdash;a
  confidence more exacting, and better rewarded, than the faith of the floating
  swimmer.</p>

  <p>He glanced without much interest at the indifferent skaters as he swept
  past them. Most of them were huddled in small parties, hacking away with
  short, stumbling steps, what time they were not clawing at each other for
  support, or spilling themselves, or shrieking hysterically over the
  misfortunes of their neighbours, or fussing with their straps. Magnolia was a
  bit too far south to breed able ice-skaters.</p>

  <p>Presently Dinny sighted a tall girl, apparently alone, who knew what she
  was there for. My word!&mdash;what a competent young eagle she was! He
  wheeled, and followed her at a respectful distance.</p>

  <p>She was slender, but beautifully formed; exquisite from the top of the
  brown fur toque that matched her curly hair to the flashing blades of the
  high-laced skating-boots which intriguingly disclosed attractive segments of
  gleaming silk between them and the short brown skirt. Her gauntleted
  hands&mdash;long, strong hands&mdash;were outspread at the tops of her hips
  as if they signalled the measured strokes like a coxswain. She clasped them
  behind her back, now, as if they had nothing whatever to do with it.</p>

  <p>The girl had leisurely slowed down, at the end of the pond, finishing the
  lap with a series of incomparable "eights."</p>

  <p>Observing that she was quite absorbed in her own affairs, Dinny did not
  linger to join the admiring circle that collected rapidly to view her skilful
  man&oelig;uvres, but drifted negligently away toward the farther end of the
  lagoon. Turning, there, he noticed with satisfaction that she had detached
  herself from her little theatre and was again on more extensive flights. He
  hoped she would come on. Pursuing a small orbit, in reverse, Dinny waited.
  His heart gave a hard bump as she swept closer. Her face was radiant with
  vitality&mdash;a patrician face, thought Dinny; a portrait face, finely
  modelled brows, sensitive nostrils, red lips curved like the bent bow of a
  medieval arbalest. Little curls peeped from under the fur toque, softening
  the lines of a gallant forehead.</p>

  <p>She smiled, as one artist to another.</p>

  <p>"Very good ice," she said, casually, in a tone that made Dinny think, if
  she sang&mdash;and surely she did&mdash;it would be contralto.</p>

  <p>"You skate beautifully," said Dinny.</p>

  <p>Her slightly raised brows and parted lips accepted the candid tribute.</p>

  <p>"You should know," she replied.</p>

  <p>"But you didn't learn it in Magnolia," Dinny hazarded, flushed a little by
  her bland compliment. He held out his hands, invitingly.</p>

  <p>"Shall we?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? I'd like to."</p>

  <p>She had hardly consented before they were beginning to drift, crossed
  hands clasped, into a long, indolent roll that inclined their tall, lithe
  forms so far off balance none but the expert could have trusted to it.</p>

  <p>Their wake was a double row of graceful fern-fronds, laid down almost end
  to end on the glassy lagoon. At first the fronds were twenty feet long and
  sixteen inches apart. Then they lengthened to thirty feet and narrowed to
  thirteen inches, for Dinny had drawn her closer, and she had instantly
  responded.</p>

  <p>They moved as one body, their rhythm perfect. Sometimes the long twin
  fronds seemed pointing directly toward a mighty collision with a group of
  wobbly-ankled gigglers; but, without signalling each other by so much as a
  pressure of the fingers, the welded pair of ice-artists would bend the arc of
  the fronds and sail past with the grace of a yacht acknowledging the sudden
  puff of a capricious breeze. Preferring to sense to the full the ecstasy of
  reckless swallows, they had not attempted conversation, but their thoughts
  had been active.</p>

  <p>It had required no deduction on Joan's part to identify her overtowering
  companion as a Magnolia athlete, for there was a huge pink <i>M</i> on his
  white sweater. Dinny was still in the dark, his curiosity mounting.</p>

  <p>"What's the letter about?" she asked, when they idled to the first stop at
  the eastern end of the pond where they had met.</p>

  <p>"Football&mdash;but this is a lot more fun, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she laughed, "but I never played football.... You must live
  here&mdash;or you would have started home."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Dinny, "do you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes.... Are you coming to our Christmas party?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly am!" said Dinny, fervently. "Whose party?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Joan Braithwaite."</p>

  <p>"I should have known," said Dinny. "But you're always away. University of
  Wisconsin&mdash;isn't it?... I'm Ferdinand Brumm, Miss Braithwaite."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" Joan's pretty mouth rounded in happy surprise. "So you're the lad
  that galloped the sixty yards with all Camford hanging on to you! I read
  about it.... You're 'Dinny'!"</p>

  <p>"Thanks!... But it was only the last three or four yards that they all got
  on.... Like to do it some more?"</p>

  <p>"How many of them were there&mdash;actually?" laughed Joan, taking his
  proffered hands.</p>

  <p>"I believe they had eleven on their team, that day," said Dinny,
  thoughtfully. "It may have been a few more. Camford is frightfully
  unscrupulous, you know."</p>

  <p>They chatted, amiably.</p>

  <p>Yes&mdash;she loved Wisconsin, but her father was insisting on her coming
  to Magnolia, next year. Dinny expressed his sincere regrets.</p>

  <p>"I mean, of course," he amended, "I'm sorry for <i>you,</i> having to
  leave your friends... and Magnolia will be quite a change, you know.... Not
  much doing here."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I won't mind&mdash;much," said Joan; adding, after a considerable
  pause, "The Gammas gave a nice party for me, last night&mdash;that's my
  sorority, you know.... By the way&mdash;where were <i>you?"</i></p>

  <p>"I'm a barb," drawled Dinny.</p>

  <p>"Oh... I didn't know.... Pardon me, won't you?" She endeavoured to cover
  her confusion with a contrite little laugh as she added, "I didn't know
  the&mdash;the non-fraternity men called <i>themselves</i> 'barbs.'... I
  thought they quite bitterly resented the word."</p>

  <p>"Why should they?" asked Dinny, dryly. "We know that when the fraternity
  men call us 'barbs,' it's just a bit of friendly chaffing&mdash;same as when
  we call them 'Greeks.' We haven't the courage and vitality to be barbarians,
  and they don't know any Greek. Why&mdash;if their badges weren't of different
  shapes and colours, they'd never know when they met a brother."</p>

  <p>"Frightfully satirical, aren't you?" Joan's tone was crisp.</p>

  <p>"It's the best thing I do," boasted Dinny, in mock seriousness. "I've been
  commended for it by Professor Grover, a couple of times. In fact, he gave me
  <i>E,</i> last semester, in Creative Composition. <i>E</i> stands for
  Excellent, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," consented Joan, "and it stands for some other things&mdash;when
  it's grading satire and sarcasm."</p>

  <p>The twin fronds on the ice behind them widened a little.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;for instance?" Dinny wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"No matter," said Joan, idly. "Forget it."</p>

  <p>"But I quite insist. You had something you wanted to say."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it isn't very polite," ventured Joan, "but doesn't <i>E</i>
  stand for Enraged&mdash;and Embattled&mdash;and Embarrassed&mdash;
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;what?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Envious."</p>

  <p>"You're quite frank," said Dinny, after an instant of recovery.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you would have it, you know.... I told you I didn't like
  irony."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;you like humour, don't you?... and if there's anything funnier
  than a bunch of college students taking on airs because they're 'Greeks,' I'm
  sure I don't know what it is. You'd think they would tumble all over
  themselves getting into old man Appleton's classes. We barbs have Homer all
  to ourselves. Oddly enough, old Appleton is a barb, himself!"</p>

  <p>Joan disengaged her hands, a little before they reached the end of the
  pond. Her face showed disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Does it make you happy," she asked, soberly looking him straight in the
  eyes&mdash;"to be... that way?"</p>

  <p>"I've had very little occasion to be happy," parried Dinny.</p>

  <p>"You mean here?... at Magnolia?"</p>

  <p>"I mean everywhere... and always," said Dinny, suddenly sincere. "If I
  were to tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you want to?" Joan's tone deepened, and her dark brown eyes searched
  his rugged face.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, brusquely, adding, suddenly contrite, "Thank
  you&mdash;all the same. I think I'd&mdash;I wouldn't mind telling
  you&mdash;if it weren't such a dull story."</p>

  <p>They simultaneously felt that their little visit was over. Joan glanced at
  her wrist-watch. Dinny squinted at the declining sun.</p>

  <p>She reached out her hand.</p>

  <p>"I'll be seeing you, then, on Christmas?" she said.</p>

  <p>Dinny felt very lonely as she glided away. She was the most superb
  creature he had ever seen.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">President and Mrs. Braithwaite were warmly effusive as they
  welcomed him in the wide doorway of their spacious parlour.</p>

  <p>Joan was standing a little to one side, within the room, talking
  animatedly with Barney Vaughn, who seemed in unusually high spirits. Dinny
  had forgotten that Barney, who had passed a dozen universities en route from
  Ph&oelig;nix, Arizona, to Magnolia&mdash;to the never-flagging curiosity of
  all, unaware that his father was a Magnolian&mdash;might be a guest
  tonight.</p>

  <p>He had not talked with Barney since last May. They had briefly informed
  each other about the weather, when they happened to pass on the street,
  unless they sighted each other early enough for one of them to cross over and
  avoid even this laconic exchange of cool civilities.</p>

  <p>The constraint that stiffened their previously close friendship dated from
  Dinny's refusal to become a Sig.</p>

  <p>The Sigs had not bidden him promptly. Within a week after his first
  appearance on the athletic field, the Delts had spent two hours with him,
  reciting the honoured names of alumni (none of them Magnolians, as it
  happened) who had gone forth to hold aloft the good old banner, and the Pies
  had offered to share their refined salt, but he had politely declined. Barney
  had urged him to wait.</p>

  <p>The Sigs were a good while getting around to it. His work at <i>The
  Star</i> kept him occupied, and made it difficult for him to be sociable. The
  preliminary overtures of the Sigs were made somewhat listless by the fact,
  which developed in casual conversation when Barney had him in as his luncheon
  guest, that he would be unable to conform to many of their regulations for
  the disciplining of "the frosh." The Custer Cottage was already crowded to
  capacity with their pledges.</p>

  <p>The bid was not issued until early December, Dinny learning, later,
  through an outburst of confidence on the part of Barney, who had had it from
  Curly Sprague, a soph, that Spike Davis had held out for some time,
  threatening to blackball Dinny, if it came to a vote. Spike had been talked
  into consent on the night after the Thanksgiving game with Camford in which,
  as fullback, he had kicked the goal that tied the score and rent the sky. He
  was feeling very much at peace with all mankind, and a bit drunk; so he
  waived his objections, and agreed to Dinny's election.</p>

  <p>Dinny was unsure whether he wanted to accept the belated invitation. He
  confided his dilemma to Mr. Brophy, one night.</p>

  <p>"You'd better, I think," counselled Mr. Brophy. "Otherwise you're rated a
  barb, and that will be awkward for you, not only while you're in college,
  but&mdash;always."</p>

  <p>So&mdash;Dinny had accepted the little button symbolic of the tardy honour
  the Sigs conferred, and merged into the pack, to his considerable
  inconvenience, for the new relationship levied irksome requirements. He
  bolted his six-thirty dinner at "th' House," dashed for a street-car, and
  arrived at <i>The Star</i> usually ten minutes late, requiring double-measure
  overtime at his own expense. He never had time to eat a dessert, except on
  Saturday.</p>

  <p>The fraternities initiated their freshmen during the first week of June.
  The Sigs did not initiate Dinny.</p>

  <p>Each candidate, according to custom, was assigned a special test of his
  nerve, or an earnest of his eagerness to become a Greek. Barney was to stand
  in front of The Palace Theatre, one night, from eight to eight-thirty, with a
  hand-organ and a monkey&mdash;a salutary lesson in humility, though he had
  been cuffed about almost enough to have cured him of any uppishness. Chuck
  Rawlins was to present, on the occasion of his initiation, a live sparrow,
  the Sigs offering no suggestions for its capture, but insisting that his
  approach to the classic shrine, minus a live sparrow, would be undesired.
  Porky Bennet was to attend the Pan-Sorority tea, that afternoon, as Carmen,
  the Sigs volunteering to furnish the tambourine from their property
  closet.</p>

  <p>Spike Davis was chairman of the committee on initiation. Most of the
  stunts had required no imagination on his part, having been bequeathed,
  through many generations of Hellenic forbears.</p>

  <p>Dinny's special assignment had cost Spike several contemplative hours.
  Cocky young Brumm had taken his honours too lightly; had dodged too many
  disciplines on the ground of his employment in town. Furthermore&mdash;though
  this factor Spike would have denied with fists and fangs&mdash;Dinny had
  played exceptionally good football at fullback on the frosh team. The local
  sports writers had made no riddle of their belief and hope that next autumn,
  when he was eligible, he would add lustre to the varsity. Even Woods,
  reviewing the season in <i>The Cincinnati Times-Telegram</i> (recently
  popularized and circulation-boosted through its absorption by The Craig
  Syndicate), had remarked, of next year's prospects, "Magnolia has an
  excellent chance at the Conference pennant, what with her strong line, and
  the long-legged Dinny Brumm, who will have reached the age of
  responsibility."</p>

  <p>All these things being as they were, Spike had something unique for Dinny
  to do as proof that he was worthy to wear a Sig pin.</p>

  <p>"What's eatin' you, Spike?"... "You can't have him do that!"... "Snap out
  of it, old son. That's much too thick." Thus did the seniors try to talk him
  out of it. But Spike held his ground. It was his show, wasn't it? He was
  running this affair, wasn't he? Brumm had it all coming to him, didn't
  he?</p>

  <p>Dinny was to carry a football under his arm, to all his classes, for a
  week. It was to be the one monumental pigskin on which Jim Faucett, the frosh
  captain, had vaingloriously inked the scores of their games with other
  classes&mdash;most of which triumphs had been freely conceded to Dinny's
  fleetness and ruthlessness at fullback.</p>

  <p>"I can't do that, Spike." Dinny shook his head, determinedly.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Spike, loftily. "That's that, then! If you want to be a
  Sig, you know what you've got to do. Think it over."</p>

  <p>Barney Vaughn came to Dinny's room, that afternoon, troubled.</p>

  <p>"Dinny&mdash;you've got to, you know," pleaded Barney. "They've talked to
  him, but he won't budge."</p>

  <p>Dinny sat toying with a paper-knife, his brows knitted in a brown
  study.</p>

  <p>"He told me to find you." Barney's voice trembled a little. "And come back
  with an immediate reply."</p>

  <p>Dinny rose, presently, tossed the paper-knife on the desk with a clatter,
  thrust his hands deep into his trouser pockets.</p>

  <p>"No, Barney; there isn't anybody at Magnolia who can give me such an
  order&mdash;and if there was anybody who could, it wouldn't be Spike
  Davis."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" Barney was half-frantic. "What am I to do?... What shall I
  tell him?"</p>

  <p>Dinny took the little button from his lapel, laid it in Barney's hand, and
  said, slowly, but without heat:</p>

  <p>"You can give this to Spike, with my compliments, and tell him to go to
  hell."</p>

  <p>"Do you realize, Dinny, what this is going to do to our
  friendship&mdash;no matter how I feel about it, personally?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I do," muttered Dinny. "That's the worst part of it, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"Want to sleep over it?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that's final. I shan't change my mind."</p>

  <p>"Awfully sorry, Dinny.... Good-bye."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Braithwaite, buxom, black-gowned, maternal, proceeded
  to adopt Dinny, who had been the last to arrive, engaging him in a
  conversation which she endeavoured to pivot around himself, somewhat to his
  anxiety, for any discussion of his home and his people was distasteful.</p>

  <p>Joan and Barney had moved away, joining the group clustered about Miss
  Gresley, whose parents were missionaries in India. She would rejoin them,
  after her graduation in June. Miss Gresley was always an object of interest,
  frequently appearing at missionary teas and church affairs in Hindu costume
  which became her more than the clothes she wore now.</p>

  <p>Dinny wanted very much to speak to Joan; hoped she would presently welcome
  him. But dinner was announced at that moment. Tall, genial, handsome Doctor
  Braithwaite excused himself to find Miss Gresley, who, as the farthest away
  from home, was clearly eligible to sit at her host's right hand.</p>

  <p>"I am going to take you with me, Mr. Brumm," said Mrs. Braithwaite. Dinny
  offered his arm.</p>

  <p>It was not until they were all standing with their hands on the tops of
  their chairs, waiting for whatever of ceremony was in order, that Dinny
  noticed the position of Joan at the right of Barney, who sat next to Miss
  Gresley. Their eyes met, briefly, and Joan accorded him a little nod of
  recognition.</p>

  <p>The President suggested that they sing a verse of "Holy Night," after
  which they sat, fully three fourths of the score of shy guests immediately
  and concertedly helping themselves to a nervous sip of water, as if to say
  that they knew what <i>that</i> was for, anyway, whatever baffling dishes
  might challenge their social experience later.</p>

  <p>"You met our Joan, didn't you, Mr. Brumm?" Mrs. Braithwaite had dipped a
  spoon into her fruit cocktail. "She told me. So nice you could skate
  together. She quite enjoyed it. See&mdash;she's looking this way
  now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dinny glanced in Joan's direction, not quite sure whether the smile was
  for him or her mother. Barney, at the moment, was speaking to Miss
  Gresley.</p>

  <p>"Of course you know Mr. Vaughn. You are classmates, aren't you? Joan met
  him, last night, at the Gammas' reception. I'm so anxious for Joan to make
  some good friends, for she's coming to Magnolia, next year. Her sorority
  sisters were so kind to her, last night."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;they would be, I should think," assented Dinny, hopeful that
  the conversation might soon veer away from the reception. Apparently it
  occurred to his hostess, at that moment, that Hellenic activities might not
  be of interest to him.</p>

  <p>"The Y.M. and Y.W. have just lovely parties, too," she said, "don't you
  think?"</p>

  <p>"So I'm told," replied Dinny, in a tone that evinced about as much
  personal knowledge as if she had remarked on the exceptionally large
  pineapple crop grown last season on the Island of Oahu.</p>

  <p>"You're a naughty boy," chided Mrs. Braithwaite, smiling. "I don't believe
  you go to them, at all, and they're really very pleasant affairs."</p>

  <p>"I work nights, Mrs. Braithwaite," explained Dinny; and, when she had
  inquired for particulars, he told her, their conversation broken, now and
  then, by her brief exchange of talk with Orville Kling&mdash;though he was
  mostly occupied with Miss Naylor, the Y.W. secretary&mdash;and Dinny's futile
  efforts to find some mutual interest with sallow, little Miss Upton. His eyes
  roved about the table, and when he reached Joan, they exchanged a steady look
  of inquiry, as if she still asked, "Does it make you happy&mdash;to
  be&mdash;that way?"... and as if he countered, "Why should you care?"</p>

  <p>"But you have almost no social life at all, Mr. Brumm," lamented Mrs.
  Braithwaite. "What a pity you are tied up to such an exacting schedule."</p>

  <p>"It's no great matter, Mrs. Braithwaite." Dinny lightly dismissed the
  dilemma with a slight shrug. "I rather enjoy my work on <i>The Star.</i>
  And&mdash;as for society&mdash;well, I'm not eligible to it, you see. As a
  matter of fact"&mdash;he lowered his voice, confidentially&mdash;"I came into
  this town in a day coach."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Braithwaite laughed a little, glanced about the table, fleetingly,
  and replied, "But so did most of us, I fancy."</p>

  <p>"I dare say," agreed Dinny; adding, "You understand." Again his eyes
  wandered toward Joan, who met him with a level gaze that continued to ask,
  "Does it make you happy?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do understand," said Mrs. Braithwaite, as if they were done with
  riddles, "and I'm sorry, and something ought to be done about it&mdash;but
  I'm sure I don't know what."</p>

  <p>After dinner, Kling announced&mdash;bouncing up and down on his
  experienced toes&mdash;that, at the request of the President, they would sing
  a few songs. Miss Noble, invited to the grand piano, carefully put her
  handkerchief down on the ledge of the key-board, and accompanied "On,
  Magnolia," to Kling's encouraging direction, all joining with loyal
  enthusiasm. Then they sang "America," with unusual heartiness, for patriotism
  was in the air, and "God Save the King," as a second verse, for the
  "neutrality" of early autumn had been buried under the falling leaves and the
  snow. Kling suggested "The Marseillaise," which they hummed, uncertainly, no
  one knowing the words very well.</p>

  <p>Dinny was not quite sure which wing of the party he belonged to, after the
  dinner. Mrs. Braithwaite had signed him to remain by her, just a little to
  his discomfiture, for perhaps she was making an effort to pay him special
  attention, in atonement for the indifference of her sort toward the social
  redemption of day-coachers. But Dinny felt remote. On the other side of her,
  the President, Joan, and Barney represented the kindly condescending element
  that viewed the party as finely bred settlement workers look on at the games
  promoted for the uplift of slum brats.</p>

  <p>In all fairness, Dinny reflected that he was super-sensitive on this
  subject; told himself that what appeared to be conscious superiority on their
  part was nothing but an acknowledged inferiority of his own. But the
  situation was awkward, and he wished himself well out of it. He felt like an
  overgrown child, sitting with adults, at a children's party.</p>

  <p>Kling, who appeared to be the spokesman for the guests, ventured upon a
  little speech of gratitude on behalf of them all. Pleased with the success of
  his remarks, he pulled out the tremolo stop, and, gradually increasing the
  tempo of his teetering up and down, jambed his stubby hands deeply into his
  coat pockets, achieving the posture and meter that presaged an early outburst
  of emotion.... Of course, none of us was forgetting, in the midst of our
  Christmas gaiety, the bereavement and suffering of our hard-pressed
  neighbours beyond the sea, waging valiant warfare to protect civilization
  against the ruthless selfishness of The Hun.... Kling was roundly
  applauded.</p>

  <p>"Terrible&mdash;isn't it?" Mrs. Braithwaite turned to Dinny, her brows
  knitted in painful reflection.</p>

  <p>"You mean the war?"</p>

  <p>"You're a bad boy," said Mrs. Braithwaite, reproachfully.</p>

  <p>Kling now suggested that they have a few words from the President, and sat
  down, smiling expectantly.</p>

  <p>Doctor Braithwaite rose, rather soberly, thanked them for coming, invited
  them to drop in when they liked, through the lonely vacation days.... It was
  true, as Mr. Kling had indicated, that our happiness should be tempered with
  sympathy for the millions defending themselves in an unnecessary war. We
  would be justified in extending sympathy, also, to the millions who, through
  no fault of their own, were being pushed into a conflict, as aggressors, for
  which they had no personal inclination.</p>

  <p>"The thing we want to avoid&mdash;or postpone as long as possible&mdash;is
  the attitude of hatred toward the Germans," went on Doctor Braithwaite,
  deeply earnest. "Germany has contributed too much to the enlightenment and
  beautification of the world to be dismissed, lightly, as an enemy of
  civilization.... These lurid tales of atrocities may, or may not, be true. I,
  for one, do not believe them!"</p>

  <p>Dinny pounded his hands, the others tardily and rather doubtfully joining
  in the applause for politeness' sake.</p>

  <p>"I see you agree with Doctor Braithwaite&mdash;about the war," said his
  hostess, upon the conclusion of the President's brief address. "It's not the
  popular thing, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>"I'd agree with Doctor Braithwaite&mdash;no matter what he said!" declared
  Dinny, fervently. "He's always right&mdash;and I know he's right about
  this."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Dinny!" she said, softly, adding, "You won't mind if I call
  you 'Dinny'?... I'm afraid Mr. Braithwaite will find only a minority willing
  to share his views."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't need to care&mdash;a man like him!" declared Dinny, with
  assurance.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Braithwaite shook her head, uneasily.</p>

  <p>"People are growing more and more militant," she said.</p>

  <p>The party was breaking up, now. The Braithwaites attended to their duties
  as hosts. Joan was shaking hands with the girls, as they filed out and up the
  stairs to recover their coats. Barney had escaped. He and Dinny had not
  exchanged a dozen words.</p>

  <p>"Going up the hill?" inquired Kling, breezily, still under the influence
  of his success as an impromptu speaker.</p>

  <p>Dinny assented, without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>Joan moved toward him, her eyes troubled. Overriding the antagonism that
  had developed between them there was a curious intimacy in their attitude as
  he bent to listen to her swiftly spoken confidence. It was as if they had
  known and trusted each other for years.</p>

  <p>"Don't say or do anything to encourage my father in his&mdash;his attempt
  at suicide!" pleaded Joan. "He's dead wrong, and he's going to get into
  trouble! Don't lead any more applause that might make him think he has
  backing. Please!"</p>

  <p>"How do you know he's wrong?" Dinny's grey-green eyes challenged her brown
  eyes with a steady look.</p>

  <p>"Indiscreet, then," she compromised, impatiently. "My father&mdash;" Joan
  lowered her voice almost to a whisper. "My father has quite enough problems
  on his hands, just now, without incurring any more. You like him, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"More than any man I ever met!" said Dinny, with fervour.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;so do I," murmured Joan, "and I'm not going to let him ruin
  himself if I can help it."</p>

  <p>Dinny offered his hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-night&mdash;Miss Braithwaite.... Sorry my little gesture of loyalty
  to your father has distressed you."</p>

  <p>Joan's brown eyes fired, angrily.</p>

  <p>"I don't like sarcasm," she muttered, "and I think you're perfectly
  hateful, Dinny Brumm!"</p>

  <p>Dinny's hand was still extended. She seemed determined to ignore it. Her
  hot eyes winked rapidly as she faced the faint traces of a conciliatory
  smile&mdash;half-reproach, half-indulgence&mdash;on Dinny's lips.</p>

  <p>Impetuously, she took his hand, for a fleeting instant, and turned
  away.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"What did I tell you?" exhorted Kling, as they trudged up
  the slope toward the dormitory. "The man's positively dangerous! You'll
  find"&mdash;Kling measured his syllables with a didactic hand&mdash;"that
  when a man's religious faith breaks down, it isn't long until his patriotism
  isn't much good, either!"</p>

  <p>"Looks like it's going to snow again," observed Dinny, with exasperating
  unconcern.</p>

  <p>"And <i>you</i> want to be careful, too, young fellow," warned Kling,
  ominously.</p>

  <p>"Meaning <i>what?"</i> growled Dinny, dangerously, with a savage clutch at
  Kling's sleeve that flung him almost off his feet.</p>

  <p>Amazed at this unexpected onslaught, Kling was speechless for a moment,
  and then said, nervously, "I'm not going to fight you, Dinny, if that's what
  you want."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;so you are a pacifist, after all," taunted Dinny.
  "Well&mdash;you needn't fight, this time, if the idea of it alarms you, or
  violates your convictions; but"&mdash;he clutched Kling's overcoat collar in
  the strong grip of his long fingers&mdash;"if I ever hear of you dishing out
  any more of your damned impudence about Doctor Braithwaite&mdash;ever
  again&mdash;in public or private&mdash;I'll beat hell out of you, whether you
  defend yourself or not! Have you got that, now, so you can remember it?"</p>

  <p>He left Kling standing there on the path.</p>

  <p>Without turning, he proceeded on up the hill, climbed to his room, slammed
  the door, disrobed, and wrote two letters, the second addressed to the
  Reverend Miles Brumm.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Sir:<br>
  <br>
  I have instructed the Speedway Moving and Storage Company of Indianapolis to
  call at your address for a small walnut desk of mine, formerly the property
  of my mother.<br>
  <br>
  You will be good enough to let the moving people have the desk for immediate
  shipment to me, at my expense.<br>
  <br>
  This, I think, will terminate our business and other relationships.<br>
  <br>
  Any fear you may entertain relative to the possibility of an effort on my
  part to recover the money you stole from me, can be safely dismissed.<br>
  <br>
  In view of the fact that my contempt for Mr. Alexander Craig is all of a
  piece with my contempt for you, I would not press the claim.<br>
  <br>
  No reply to this letter is expected or desired.<br>
  <br>
  Yours truly,<br>
  FERDINAND BRUMM</p><br>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MAGNOLIA COLLEGE was considered good copy during the
  academic year of 1915-16.</p>

  <p>It was a period when any recognition on the front page, crowded with heavy
  artillery, marine disasters, massacres of millions, and the multisonous
  clangor of a world on fire, required more racket than small church schools
  were accustomed to add to the cosmic din.</p>

  <p>Even the Associated Press, sated with sensation, conceded, at the close of
  her second semester, that Magnolia&mdash;for sixty-three placid years an
  earnest little violet, staking her last shy petal on the nobility of
  diffidence&mdash;had done her bit in leaded black-face.</p>

  <p>In the autumn, Magnolia spectacularly won nine smashing victories on the
  gridiron with scores that dizzied her competitors, no one of whom got within
  ten yards of her goal-line. Egged on by sports writers, she tentatively
  booked an exhibition game with Harvard to be played the next September, an
  engagement which was cancelled in the spring, Harvard having lost interest,
  Magnolia having lost Dinny Brumm.</p>

  <p>On New Year's Eve, the Recitation Hall burned to the ground,
  unquestionably the work of an incendiary, public opinion agreeing that some
  ardent "preparedness" fanatic had thus expressed his sentiments toward a
  college so spiritless as to permit an uncompromising pacifist to direct her
  destiny.</p>

  <p>On March tenth, the most widely known member of the undergraduate body,
  whose long legs and reckless courage had been primarily responsible for
  Magnolia's brilliant achievements in football, was expelled for adorning the
  President of the college Y.M.C.A. with two black eyes and a split lip.</p>

  <p>The prosecution, appealing to the increasingly popular cause of
  patriotism, made large capital of the fact that the plaintiff had come by his
  injuries as a result of an impassioned address in behalf of his country's
  injured pride. The defendant's spirit of disloyalty was further evidenced by
  the recent appearance of his article in <i>The Iconoclast,</i> a discordant
  organ of protest, in which the author had heaped contumely upon his Alma
  Mater, and shown a disposition to bite the hand that fed him.</p>

  <p>The defence endeavoured to show that the attack on Mr. Kling's person was
  an honest, albeit over-enthusiastic, reprisal for certain damaging remarks
  made in reference to Doctor Braithwaite. It further ventured to prove,
  politely as the circumstances permitted, that the statements of Mr. Brumm in
  <i>The Iconoclast</i>&mdash;though admittedly phrased in the pardonable
  superlatives of rampant youth&mdash;were unfortunately true. The faculty
  jury, Professor Grover, chairman, was out only five minutes.</p>

  <p>Had it been Kling who was being fired, the press might have passed over
  the matter with negligent observation. The expulsion of Dinny Brumm was quite
  another affair. <i>The Cincinnati Times-Telegram,</i> in particular, wanted
  to know all about it, and set forth Dinny's cause with so much unction that
  the Magnolia Board of Directors was deluged with letters and telegrams
  inquiring, in varying degrees of indignation, whether the college had lost
  her mind.</p>

  <p>On March thirteenth, a student mass-meeting was held. The use of the
  college chapel&mdash;Magnolia's only adequate assembly hall&mdash;having been
  denied for this purpose, the auditorium of the City Building was secured.
  Unwittingly, the promoters of the event thus recruited not only the
  attendance of almost the entire student body (the Sigs refusing to
  participate), but augmented the audience by several hundreds of interested
  towns-people whose concern for Magnolia's welfare was largely based on her
  athletic activities.</p>

  <p>Mightily cheered and heartened from the packed galleries, which included
  not only ardent football fans with nothing at stake beyond their own
  enjoyment, but anxious representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, the Better
  Business Association, and scores of influential resident alumni, the
  undergraduates, after an accelerating tempest of fervid oratory, voted as one
  man for the rescinding of the faculty's action and a prompt reinstatement of
  Dinny Brumm.</p>

  <p>A few of the more audacious wanted a trailer affixed to the peremptory
  resolution, threatening a general strike in the event of refusal on the part
  of the faculty to conform to student opinion. This, however, was voted down,
  the Magnolians, as a whole, recovering their habitual prudence even in the
  tumult of revolution vociferously fanned by the town.</p>

  <p>On March twentieth, after an all-night session of the faculty and the
  Board of Directors, Dinny Brumm was restored to his previous rating. A mild
  proviso was attached demanding that Mr. Brumm settle for Mr. Kling's personal
  repairs and the mending of sundry articles of furniture which had impeded the
  celebrated fullback in his task of chastising his neighbour&mdash;it having
  leaked out that Dinny had already made these reparations.</p>

  <p>On March twenty-first, Dinny left Magnolia to accept the position offered
  him by wire from Mr. Steinberg, the Managing Editor of <i>The Cincinnati
  Times-Telegram.</i></p>

  <p>The Athletic Association, getting wind of Dinny's offer and acceptance,
  hastily organized plans to see him off with a procession led by the college
  band, but he had already gone when the committee rushed to his room to
  disclose the nature of the vindication they had arranged for him; was, in
  fact, sitting in Mr. Steinberg's office, listening to the latter's
  expectations of him, at the very moment when the committee was scouring
  Magnolia in quest of him.</p>

  <p>The bone of contention having been thus providentially dragged from the
  arena, the Board of Directors again assembled to focus its attention upon the
  President and inquire diligently of itself whether, in view of all the
  controversy stirred by his pacifistic opinions, it might not be better to set
  him free to preach his unpopular gospel of non-resistance on his own hook,
  undetained by any further obligations to the college.</p>

  <p>The Board split squarely in two on this issue, the objectors maintaining
  that a considerable number of important "prospects" whose contributions to
  the Endowment Fund would depend upon the retention of Doctor Braithwaite,
  were awaiting the outcome of this affair with a concern that might affect
  Magnolia to the tune of a hundred thousand dollars, or so.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding this meeting was conducted <i>in camera,</i> every member
  under pledge to give out no interviews, the discussion, the decision, and the
  underlying cause thereof, were good for a first-page column with a throw to
  three, next morning, in the public prints.</p>

  <p>On May nineteenth, President Braithwaite delivered the address to the
  graduating class of the Theological Seminary, in which he lost the support of
  the well-to-do conservatives whose influence had previously fended off the
  attacks of the swashbucklers.</p>

  <p>Later, at the funeral, it was remarked on all sides that Doctor
  Braithwaite was not quite himself while delivering this "unfortunate" speech.
  He should have been in bed; was running a temperature of 101°.</p>

  <p>At the hour, however, no alibis were offered, and the address was judged
  on its demerits. Doctor Braithwaite proceeded vigorously to reappraise the
  preacher's job for the edification of the fledgling prophets.... We were
  entering upon a Reformation of the Church comparable to that of four
  centuries ago. The bulk of the old beliefs were irrelevant. The oncoming
  generation would be so disinterested in them that it would never even glance
  in their direction. The old credos were as dead as Queen Anne.... We had done
  with musty metaphysics, at least for the epoch with which we would have to
  do, and would concern ourselves so exclusively with kinetic energies that
  speculative philosophy could safely retire to the sanctuary of the museum....
  The only service any longer possible for the old theology would be rendered
  in the capacity of an ancient landmark from which explorers might plat the
  curve of Christian progress.</p>

  <p>The Board went into conference, late that afternoon, and passed a
  resolution requesting Doctor Braithwaite's resignation. But he was too ill to
  be handed the document, next morning, for he had developed a grave
  pneumonia.</p>

  <p>On the following Friday, he died. It was quite obvious that the minority
  who agreed with him would say he died a martyr. It was equally obvious that
  the majority, who had thrown him out, would refer to him as a sincere,
  misguided radical whose disaster was easily to be accounted for: he had
  broken loose from the old moorings. Let this be a lesson.</p>

  <p>A few of the elderly invincibles muttered that it was a judgment of God.
  One bushy-haired apostle, large of lung and expansive of gesture (eight years
  later elected Sublime Cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan in that region), ventured
  to preach, the following Sunday, on "Vengeance is Mine: I will repay, saith
  the Lord." Hopeful of riding into public notice on the shoulders of a corpse,
  he sent his manuscript to <i>The Star,</i> which, on the indignant Mr.
  Brophy's orders, was printed exactly as written, inclusive of all the bad
  spelling, bad grammar, and bad temper which distinguished it as a flagrant
  example of passionate ignorance.</p>

  <p>It was an eventful year at Magnolia College. Hitherto it had been her
  proud boast that in her quiet corner she had preserved the faith once
  delivered to the saints. Having bred no speedy hares, she had gone in for
  steady tortoises, promising that great merit occasionally accrued through a
  race won by the plodder whose brilliant competitors had gone to sleep, on the
  course, overcome by sheer boredom. The highest mark ever accorded the winner
  of a Rebecca Winters Dutton Medal had been scored by an essay entitled
  "Obscure Martyrs."</p>

  <p>Little Magnolia, in the fierce glare of tie spot-light, felt stark naked,
  and was ashamed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">But if the college year was a succession of dramatic events
  so interesting to the public that Magnolia's carryings-on were fetched in,
  every morning, off forty thousand doorsteps, along with the milk&mdash;events
  in which Dinny Brumm continuously figured either as an active principal or an
  unwitting accomplice&mdash;the season was replete with unpublished episodes
  vastly more upsetting to this junior's peace of mind.</p>

  <p>Having worked full time on <i>The Star</i> through the three months'
  vacation, Dinny's economically administered savings were augmented to the
  point where he felt safe in launching upon his junior year without a job.</p>

  <p>With more leisure in prospect, he had accepted the associate editorship of
  <i>The Blossom.</i></p>

  <p>Had the barbs been able to move concertedly, they might easily have had
  their way in all the college elections relating to non-academic activities,
  for they outnumbered the Greeks three to one; but, lacking such unity, they
  were usually trounced by the sophisticated minority. This time, the Sigs and
  the Pies had failed to get together on a slate for <i>The Blossom</i> staff,
  each offering a favourite son. The sororities took sides, the Gammas, as
  usual, lining up with the Sigs, the Lambies throwing their vote to the Pies.
  The barbs elected their ticket.</p>

  <p>Gates, the impecunious senior editor, less concerned about becoming famous
  as a journalist than for the commercial success of his paper (the staff
  receiving a modest rake-off, if the year's business justified a bonus),
  encouraged Dinny to assume unrestricted liberty on the editorial page.</p>

  <p>Faithful to its innocuous name, <i>The Blossom</i> had ever been a frail
  and shrinking organism, a mere amplified bulletin of collegiate announcements
  and uncritical comments. Its platitudinous editorials roused no breeze. Such
  spoofing as it indulged in usually applied to budding romances on the campus,
  calfish persiflage worthy of a high-school "annual."</p>

  <p>Grinning with satisfaction, Dinny milled the college paper into a giant
  cracker that went off, every Thursday afternoon, with a loud bang. After the
  first issue, <i>The Blossom</i> sold on the news-stands over in town, and was
  warmly discussed in the faculty meetings. Gates raised his advertising rates
  on unengaged space.</p>

  <p><i>The Cincinnati Times-Telegram</i> reproduced, in its Sunday supplement,
  <i>The Blossom's</i> first long editorial entitled, "What Every Freshman
  Ought to Know."</p>

  <p>Satirically featuring the unsurpassed spirit of friendliness, democracy,
  and smug insularity of Magnolia College, which rejoiced in its
  self-containment and its ability to make of its student-body "one happy
  little family," the editorial proceeded to explain the fraternity system for
  the benefit of bewildered newcomers.</p>

  <p>"Less than one fourth of our students," continued the editorial, "are
  domiciled in large, imposing residences on either side of two sacred blocks
  at the western end of Sunnyside Avenue. Here dwell the Greeks in dignified
  sequestration from the raucous shouts of the proletariat.</p>

  <p>"On each massive front door there are secrets carved in classic Greek, and
  on each roof is a mortgage presumably printed in the baser argot of the
  contemporary banking-house.</p>

  <p>"You are advised to ask no questions about these institutions or their
  tenants. If they recognize you as a Greek, they will tell you. In that case,
  their secrets will be entrusted to you, and you may be assured that they are
  secrets, and no mistake; for when a senior who knows no Greek confides a
  Greek secret to a freshman who knows no Greek, it is guaranteed to remain a
  mystery. You will also be encouraged to carry with you to your ancestral home
  a generous portion of the venerable mortgage and drape it a-straddle your
  father's chimney. If he is of a grateful mind, he will realize the honour
  thus brought to your tribe.</p>

  <p>"If, unfortunately, you are not of the stuff instantly identifiable as
  Hellenic, make no struggle to simulate a virtue which cannot be achieved by
  personal effort. In almost any pawnshop in town you will see jewelled
  fraternity badges on exhibition. To purchase and wear one of these emblems
  would not improve your rating.</p>

  <p>"Neither will it aid you, in this endeavour, to enrol in Greek courses
  with the hope of promoting your eligibility, for the tongue of Olympus is a
  native gift with our fraternity and sorority people, and you will rarely meet
  one of them in the inquisitive groups that cluster about the feet of
  Professor Appleton.</p>

  <p>"Pass quickly through the Delphian groves, when you must needs venture
  upon Sunnyside Avenue, lest you be blasted by anathemas from some Corinthian
  portico.</p>

  <p>"And when&mdash;as sometimes happens&mdash;you are snubbed and snooted by
  the Greeks, because you are a barb, if it so be that the gods have blest you
  with even the atrophied vestigial remains of any sense of humour, permit
  yourself the luxury of breaking forth with wild spasms of 'inextinguishable
  laughter.'</p>

  <p>"If you are a co-ed barb, so much the worse for you. It ill becomes a girl
  to be a barbarian. You are not built for it. Submissively accept your
  unkindly fate. Defer to your more sophisticated sisters when you encounter
  them on the campus. Step off the path, and humbly address them in their own
  language. Many of them have never learned to speak English correctly, and it
  will be a pleasant courtesy if you salute them in Greek.</p>

  <p>"While it may be superfluous, perhaps impertinent, to suggest a suitable
  amenity, <i>The Blossom</i> will cheerfully furnish upon request, a brief
  salutation to be employed on such occasions. We do not guarantee, however, to
  provide applicants with the English translation."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Of all the people who relished Dinny Brumm's sour diatribe,
  nobody more keenly enjoyed it than Professor Ernst Martin, for eighteen years
  master of Geology, Archaeology, Anthropology, and sundry other brittles.</p>

  <p>Professor Martin's odd gait, due to a club foot, and amazing tricks of
  facial expression, acquired through diligent dealing with a stammering
  tongue&mdash;(sometimes he hung on a dead centre in the middle of a sentence,
  and whistled himself out of it, to the utter devastation of persons
  unacquainted with his slight disability)&mdash;amply explained why, at
  fifty-two, he was a dry old bachelor.</p>

  <p>Long-time faculty wives could well remember when "Ernie" had lain frank
  and futile siege to every good-looking girl within hobbling distance.</p>

  <p>Convinced, at length, that he was at his best when in pursuit of inorganic
  objects of nature, Professor Martin had reluctantly renounced romance in so
  far as it related to himself, but he had never relaxed his interest in the
  heart attacks of other people. His library shelves were crammed with love
  stories, the more ardent of them re-read until he knew them by rote. He was a
  devotee of the movies, and at least twice a week followed the sinuous grace
  of his favourite stars with hungry eyes.</p>

  <p>But nothing afforded him more pleasure than to observe the brief and
  covert exchange of wistful, exploring glances in his class-room. He had
  become so adept as a heart-diagnostician that he believed he could tell,
  almost the first day of a new semester, what pairings-off were likely to
  develop.</p>

  <p>It was the shy ones who interested him most, the pairs who sat farthest
  apart, never entering or leaving the room together, until&mdash;one
  day&mdash;oh, joy!&mdash;the tortured stag would man&oelig;uvre to the side
  of the flustered doe, as the herd filed out of the room, and Ernie's secret
  forecast had come true.</p>

  <p>Sometimes he would mate a pair so sluggishly moving toward each other that
  he was exasperated beyond endurance.</p>

  <p>On one occasion, he had waited a whole year for signs of advancement on
  the part of two diffident young things, who were forever looking at each
  other, and, caught at it, would quickly busy themselves in some other
  quarter. Unable to be patient any longer, Ernie contrived an errand that
  would speed their affair.</p>

  <p>His class in Anthropology was taken to "the mounds," near Pinckney. The
  gate was locked. He sent the timid pair to the owner's house, a half-mile
  away, over a narrow, rocky path, and through a tangle of uncleared forest,
  for the key. They were gone an hour, and when they returned, they were no
  longer on foot, but floating in a gossamer golden cloud. The stag's shoulder
  was white with powder, and the doe's ears were pink with embarrassment. But
  they had remembered to bring the key. It was a great occasion.</p>

  <p>By far the most baffling problem that had yet engaged Ernie's attention
  was the annoying current case of Joan Braithwaite and Dinny Brumm who were
  now members of his junior section in Anthropology.</p>

  <p>In Professor Martin's expert opinion, if ever two handsome thoroughbreds
  had been destined from all eternity to find each other&mdash;even if they had
  to meet halfway round the globe&mdash;these tall, proud, self-sufficient
  personalities were that privileged pair.</p>

  <p>It was a small class, seventeen in all, accommodated by the first
  semi-circular row of chairs in the room whose walls were eventful with high
  glass cabinets stuffed with meteorites, stalactites, fossils, pottery, and
  plaster casts of extinct animals and approximate humanity of uncertain
  date.</p>

  <p>"If my l-lectures bore you," Ernie was accustomed to say, at the opening
  session of a class, "there are p-plenty of interesting trinkets to look at, a
  c-ca-casual inspection of which would do you no dis-s-s-service."</p>

  <p>Joan had chosen the chair at the extreme end of the curved row, Dinny had
  taken the seat nearest the door. The intervening chairs were occupied by
  average examples of <i>Homo sapiens</i> in its commonest variety, worthy and
  well-meaning young persons, no doubt, but clearly of a different biological
  category from the two who, at opposite ends of the row, were so definitely of
  a higher species of primate. The amusing, the infuriating thing about it was
  that neither of them seemed to know what anybody should have been able to
  observe at a glance.</p>

  <p>There was that good-looking young cub, Barney Vaughn, for example.
  <i>He</i> knew it. Vaughn was pathetically infatuated with Joan. Anybody
  could see that. But Vaughn avoided Brumm. Once Ernie thought Vaughn had
  purposely snubbed Brumm in a brief clash of opinion in a class discussion....
  Why did Vaughn have an aversion for Brumm? Obviously&mdash;Vaughn knew, by
  instinct, that Joan Braithwaite was Dinny Brumm's property!... Ernie was
  furious.</p>

  <p>After a few sessions of this class, Professor Martin became increasingly
  excited over his secret discovery that the calm disinterest of Joan and Dinny
  was more calculated than a mere mutual indifference. There was something
  between these two. Their avoidance of each other was intentional. They were
  not strangers, but enemies.</p>

  <p>At ease in his woollen dressing-gown, with his bad leg outstretched on a
  neighbouring chair, Ernie read the editorial, that Thursday night, in <i>The
  Blossom,</i> and laughed aloud. It was Brumm, of course. None of the others
  would have risked it. None of the others could have done it, had he been as
  audacious as the devil. It was Brumm! My Uncle!&mdash;what a savage
  disposition the young beast had!... Then the corners of Ernie's mobile mouth
  drew down, and his thin brows met.... The surly piece was funny enough, God
  knew, but Dinny shouldn't have done it. Wasn't Joan Braithwaite the
  acknowledged queen of the whole sorority outfit? What did the chap mean by
  jumping up and down with his big feet on the soft white neck of Joan's
  exclusive social tribe?</p>

  <p>For a full hour he sat tugging his lip, relighting his pipe, occasionally
  grinning, faun-like, sometimes shaking his head despairingly. At length he
  arose, limped to the gate, poked the fire, and muttered, grimly:</p>

  <p>"D-a-a-a&mdash;dammit... I'll t-t&mdash;try it! It w-w-worked
  w-w-w&mdash;once!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On the following Wednesday afternoon, the class in
  Anthropology made the annual excursion to view the mounds.</p>

  <p>It was a comforting late October day, hazy and lazy, blue and white on
  top, purple around the edges, brown underfoot. Blackbirds were noisily
  mobilizing for the southern expedition. Grey squirrels were working overtime
  storing their warehouses. Red-headed woodpeckers were drilling deep for
  drowsy hide-aways. The woods glowed with smouldering embers of a summer, and
  the narrow black stream that had carved a rough toboggan through the
  limestone cliffs ran swift and cold.</p>

  <p>The seventeen budding scientists, conducted by Professor Ernst Martin,
  were glad to be out in the country. At one they had met for the twelve-mile
  trip on a jerky, jangling, little accommodation train to Pinckney. The sexes
  had segregated in the dusty coach. Barney Vaughn, seated proprietarily beside
  Joan, made himself agreeable to the cluster of girls. Some of the men read
  newspapers, others stared out at the windows.</p>

  <p>Dinny sauntered to the rear platform, where, watching the grass-grown ties
  and rusty rails squirm through the hills, he was presently joined by his
  preceptor, who nodded amiably and seemed, by the companionable twinkle in his
  sharp little eyes, to be threatening an intimacy. They stood for some time,
  swaying with the motion of the train, eyes intent on the reeling hills.</p>

  <p>"B-Brumm," shouted Professor Martin, against the racket, "as a s-sour old
  barb, permit me to c-c-congratulate you. It was very c-c-clever."</p>

  <p>"Thanks." Dinny grinned down into the bright, beady eyes. "Great scenery,
  down this way, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Especially at this season.... B-but it would have been even more
  c-c-clever if you hadn't done it."</p>

  <p>"Somebody had to," defended Dinny, suddenly clutching the thin arm of his
  master as the train whip-cracked around a hairpin curve. "It was long
  overdue."</p>

  <p>"T-too bad it had to be you," shrilled Martin. "Y-you might have
  c-c-capitalized your p-popularity.... N-n-no use baiting the d-d-damn
  frats.... And there are some m-m-mighty fine girls in the s-sororities....
  T-t-take a g-girl like Mmmm-iss Braithwaite, for example. W-well w-worth
  c-c-cultivating, I should say. N-n-not mmm-any like her!"</p>

  <p>"Plenty of nuts, this year," observed Dinny, pointing to a clump of tall
  hickories, vanishing around the screeching bend.</p>

  <p>"Y-y-yes... j-just what I was s-saying!... N-not all of 'em on t-trees!...
  I'm g-going back inside. T-too c-c-cool out here for me."</p>

  <p>Dinny turned, and regarded his professor with fresh interest.</p>

  <p>"It's a rough road," he said smiling.</p>

  <p>"I-i-it always was for m-me," rejoined Martin, meaningly. "B-but it ought
  to be easier f-for you." One little eye winked, sardonically.</p>

  <p>Dinny felt that something was expected of him, though if the fantastic
  little geologist thought a confidence was in order, he was going to be
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>"You're fond of riddles; aren't you, Professor Martin?"</p>

  <p>Martin chuckled, nodded vigorously, and shouted over his shoulder as he
  retreated:</p>

  <p>"Y-y-yes&mdash;and I've s-solved a f-f-few!"</p>

  <p>Now what did the uncanny little devil mean by that?... Something up his
  sleeve, no doubt.... Had women on his mind.... Unhealthy imagination....
  Meddling matchmaker.... Damn fool.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the dingy wooden station in Pinckney, they straggled off toward
  the path that led a mile toward the grove of the Indian mounds, Martin
  hobbling ahead, cane-whisking at brittle milkweed pods, the girls single-file
  behind him, Barney Vaughn leading the male contingent, occasionally pressing
  solicitous attentions upon Joan as if she needed assistance on the rugged
  stone ledge of the ravine. Dinny brought up the tail of the procession, quite
  conscious&mdash;he had had one fleeting glance from her, as they entered the
  train&mdash;that he was in high disfavour with the only person in this party
  that mattered.</p>

  <p>At length a path diverged from the ravine and ambled toward the left,
  through a seared meadow strewn with huge boulders. In groups, the expedition
  crossed leisurely toward the high-fenced grove. At a considerable distance,
  keen young eyes learned that the place of interest was somewhat lacking in
  hospitality.</p>

  <p align="center">NO TRESPASSING! THIS MEANS YOU!</p>

  <p>"W-w-what's this?" exclaimed Professor Martin, indignantly, as they
  gathered in front of the padlocked gate. "Mr. B-Bowers assured me it would be
  left open for us. I m-must g-g-go for the k-key. The sh-short way to his
  house is d-d-down the ravine. N-n-no&mdash;I shall deputize a c-c-couple of
  you to go. It w-would take me too long. W-we must not be delayed."</p>

  <p>With the critical air of making a momentous decision, he deliberately took
  a careful invoice of the company, obviously contemplating the appointment of
  an important committee. His little eyes shone. They devilishly rested, for an
  instant, on the expectant face of Barney, wistfully posing for an Eagle Boy
  Scout who had not yet had a chance, today, to do a good turn.</p>

  <p>Dinny could hardly believe his ears. What had possessed the ugly little
  jackass to hurl them at each other's heads in this ruthless fashion? He
  glanced apprehensively at Joan, but she had quickly recovered. She smiled,
  graciously enough, left the group of girls, and joined him. Professor Martin
  had suggested that Mr. Bowers might be glad if the President's daughter and
  the 'varsity's best-known star were sent to ask the favour. If they had no
  objection, would they go and get the key?</p>

  <p>"Martin's a nice little arranger," said Dinny, when they were out of
  earshot.</p>

  <p>"Yes," returned Joan, frostily, "charming idea."</p>

  <p>"You don't have to talk to me, you know," explained Dinny,
  indifferently.</p>

  <p>"That's good," returned Joan, quickening her steps.</p>

  <p>In sullen silence, they retraced to the ravine. Joan briskly led the way
  along the narrow ledge, bending forward the stiff branches of intruding
  shrubbery, and not caring what became of them.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you'd better let me go first," called Dinny.</p>

  <p>There was no reply. Joan hurried on.</p>

  <p>"And look out for those loose stones!"</p>

  <p>It happened, presently. Joan, with a startled exclamation, disappeared
  over the edge. She was attempting to rise from her knees in the shallow,
  rock-strewn stream, when Dinny reached her.</p>

  <p>"Now you've gone and got yourself in a mess, haven't you?" scolded Dinny,
  reaching out both hands toward her. She ignored them, and tried to scramble
  to her feet.</p>

  <p>"You needn't bother," she protested, hotly. "I don't want your
  help&mdash;a bit!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you do," he drawled&mdash;"and quite a lot of it. You've hurt
  yourself. Haven't you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, reluctantly, like a defeated child, and reached up for Dinny's
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Help me over to that flat rock, won't you?... No&mdash;not that way!"
  Dinny was gathering her up in his arms. "Take my hands, please. I can manage,
  if you steady me."</p>

  <p>Joan took one short step and unsuccessfully tried another, shook her head,
  held out her arms. Her lips were white. Dinny lifted her clear of the water
  and deposited her gently on the little limestone island.</p>

  <p>"It's my knee.... It hurts dreadfully." She was trying to keep her voice
  steady, but she was trembling.</p>

  <p>"Think it's broken?" Dinny knelt beside her, anxiously. "Can you bend it?
  Try."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were tightly closed, and her face was drawn. She began slowly
  unrolling her stocking.</p>

  <p>"Rather I'd go away?" Dinny swallowed, nervously, and felt foolishly
  helpless.</p>

  <p>Joan eased back on both elbows, dizzy with pain, too sick to inspect the
  purpling bruise. Dinny wet his handkerchief in the cold stream, and was about
  to lay it on her forehead. Anticipating, she took the handkerchief, and
  dabbed at her temples, clumsily.</p>

  <p>"Does it&mdash;look broken?"</p>

  <p>Dinny carefully examined the damaged knee, resolutely telling himself he
  was a cad if he failed to concentrate his attention on the immediate field of
  Joan's injury. It was not broken, he reassured her, but it was frightfully
  bruised. Perhaps the sharp pain would ease up, presently.</p>

  <p>"But you mustn't stay here any longer," he decided promptly. "I'll take
  you to this Bowers place, and we'll have a doctor."</p>

  <p>"You can't," objected Joan. "Better leave me here, and get some help....
  Oh&mdash;what a beastly nuisance!"</p>

  <p>Had anyone been watching, thought Dinny, the pair of them must have made
  an amusing spectacle as he waded downstream, carrying Joan&mdash;huntsman
  fashion&mdash;on his back, her head drooping forward over his right shoulder,
  her curls tickling his ear, her warm cheek close against his. His left arm
  circled under her knees, his left hand firmly clasped her right. With
  difficulty he repressed a grin, and wondered if she was too uncomfortable to
  realize the absurdity of it all.</p>

  <p>For the first fifty yards, nothing was said, Dinny picking his steps,
  deliberately.</p>

  <p>"Am I jolting it too much?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"I can stand it," said Joan, "if you can.... I'm sorry.... I was
  hateful."</p>

  <p>"You were going pretty fast," reproved Dinny. "It was rather
  reckless."</p>

  <p>"I was furious!" Joan's voice registered directly into his ear a
  justification of her imprudent speed. "He had no business asking me to go...
  with you."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;why did you?" growled Dinny, sourly. "I'm sure I made no bid
  for it. I was surprised when you came along."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't make a scene&mdash;could I?" demanded Joan.</p>

  <p>"Of course you could... I don't believe you're above making a scene.... I
  never knew a woman who didn't like a&mdash;like a chance to exhibit her
  resentments."</p>

  <p>Dinny plodded along for several steps, conscious that he was carrying an
  explosive, and wondering how long it would be until the detonation
  occurred.</p>

  <p>"Yes," mocked Joan, acidly, "I expect it's a lot you know about
  women&mdash;as irresistible, and polite, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You see that little bridge ahead?" interrupted Dinny. "I'm going to put
  you down, if you can stand on one foot, and try to hoist you up.... Pardon
  me&mdash;you were saying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was saying"&mdash;Joan bit her words into hot little
  shrapnel&mdash;"that you're a beast... and I don't like you!"</p>

  <p>"There's no reason why you should," muttered Dinny.</p>

  <p>Hostilities were briefly suspended during the process of mounting over the
  rocks to the foot-bridge. Joan independently made her way alone to the end of
  the railing, and looked wistfully in the direction of the stone house, a
  hundred yards away.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;here we go again," said Dinny, cheerfully, ready to resume his
  burden. "It won't be far now."</p>

  <p>"I can't see why you wanted to write that mean thing," complained Joan,
  after Dinny had lifted her to his back.</p>

  <p>"Just for devilment."</p>

  <p>"Sure it wasn't for revenge?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"'No,' it wasn't?&mdash;or 'no,' you're not sure?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure it wasn't."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence Dinny was almost to Mr. Bowers's little lawn,
  now.</p>

  <p>"I wish you weren't... that way," murmured Joan, in a tone of genuine
  regret.</p>

  <p>"Why should <i>you</i> care?" drawled Dinny, with cool indifference.</p>

  <p>He carefully lowered her to the porch steps, where she slumped down, spent
  with the fatigue and strain of their trying half-hour. Dinny stretched his
  arms at full length, drew a deep breath, readjusted his scarf, ran his long
  fingers through his damp hair.</p>

  <p>Late that night, as he sleeplessly reviewed the afternoon, alternately
  glowing with the memory of Joan's physical warmth and chilled by her
  hostility, he wondered what he might have said in reply to her tardy
  rejoinder had the front door not opened, at that moment, with Mrs. Bowers
  hurrying out, all sympathy and concern.</p>

  <p>"Why should <i>you</i> care?" Dinny heard himself saying, in a tone of
  sarcastic self-depreciation.</p>

  <p>Joan had looked up, wide-eyed, lips parted, searching his face with the
  undisguised candour of a child inspecting a total stranger.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know," she said, slowly, her lips trembling a little.
  Then she glanced toward the opening door. "Thanks, Dinny, for helping
  me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bowers had rung down the curtain on this disturbing scene, murmuring
  solicitous little cries of motherly interest, and Dinny felt his immediate
  responsibility transferred to her competent hands. He waited until the
  telephone conversation assured the early arrival, by motor, of President
  Braithwaite and a physician.</p>

  <p>The men were playing ball in the meadow, when Dinny returned with the key.
  The girls were seated in the shade. Martin was consumed with curiosity, the
  brief explanation failing to satisfy.</p>

  <p>He endeavoured to corral Dinny into a corner, later, on the train. When
  all hints and subtleties of inquiry had been adroitly parried, he threw
  delicacy aside and asked a direct question. "D-d-did you have to c-c-carry
  her?"</p>

  <p>Dinny's eyes narrowed as he stared absently into the questing little grey
  beads that flashed a hungry wish.</p>

  <p>"Miss Braithwaite said she needed no assistance," he replied, dryly.</p>

  <p>Ernie gave it up then, mumbled something about the stuffiness of the
  atmosphere, and hobbled aimlessly out to the sooty back platform, where he
  hung on to the begrimed iron railing and gazed moodily into the gathering
  dusk. "H-h-hell!" he muttered. "D-d-damned ungrateful c-c-cub!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">So few swans had fledged in the Magnolia duck-run that the
  approaching visit of Congressman Philemon Bascom, '98, resident of Washington
  and Dubuque, was an event demanding celebration.</p>

  <p>The Honourable Mr. Bascom had consented to deliver the principal address
  at the formal opening of the new Science Building on the afternoon of March
  thirtieth.</p>

  <p>That the reception in his honour, on the night previous, might be loyally
  backed by undergraduate interest, the faculty had appointed a student
  committee of five to co-operate with their elders and betters in making
  arrangements.</p>

  <p>Wesley Tinker, President of the Hellenic Council, was to represent the
  fraternities. Dinny Brumm was easily the most conspicuous figure among the
  barbs. Sophia Wise, temporarily in the public eye as winner of the recent
  essay contest, would speak for the girls who knew no Greek secrets. Joan
  Braithwaite naturally epitomized the sorority element at its best. Orville
  Kling was asked to appear in behalf of the theological students.</p>

  <p>At the committee meeting, held in the library at the President's Mansion,
  lent to Joan for the occasion, an hour and a half was spent, that first
  Thursday night of March, in a rubber-stampish approval of the "tentative
  suggestions" sent from the faculty "as a basis of discussion."</p>

  <p>Hopeful of enlivening the stupid and perfunctory chatter of obsequious
  acquiescence, Dinny ventured the opinion that a reception was no place for a
  long programme of speeches. Would it not be sufficient for Doctor Braithwaite
  to welcome the honoured guest, briefly, and let the guest say "thanks." Why
  all these amateurish student harangues. There would be plenty of oratory
  touched off next day, at the impressive dedication.</p>

  <p>Kling, whom Dinny suspected was over-eager to represent the seminary on
  the reception programme, promptly sustained the policy of offering the
  student body a chance to express itself.</p>

  <p>"Speaking for the theologues," he declared, determinedly, "I think the
  faculty's wish in this matter should not be questioned."</p>

  <p>Unable to resist the temptation to tease, Dinny soberly remarked:</p>

  <p>"One might imagine the theologues would be quite relieved if they were not
  pressed to participate."</p>

  <p>"How so, may I inquire?" demanded Kling, bristling.</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;explained Dinny, with a nonchalant gesture&mdash;"this
  reception impinges on the opening of the Science Building, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>Kling truculently protested that he didn't care to enter into any
  controversy, but could assure Mr. Brumm that the Church was heart-and-soul in
  sympathy with Science&mdash;"of the right sort."</p>

  <p>Dinny wished, a moment later, that he had been content to let the matter
  rest there; but, resentfully remembering Kling's impudent attacks on Doctor
  Braithwaite's liberalizing beliefs, he decided to jab the harpoon a bit
  deeper.</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;'the right sort of Science'?&mdash;the kind taught
  in Genesis, maybe?"</p>

  <p>Kling's ears were red, and he folded and refolded his note-paper,
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"I did not come here, sir, to debate theology with a&mdash;an
  atheist."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Dinny, conciliatorily, "I withdraw my suggestion....
  Let the theologues express themselves, by all means.... I would like to
  propose that Mr. Kling be asked to speak on 'The Contribution of Orthodoxy to
  Scientific Research.'"</p>

  <p>"You're trying to be funny.... Aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;<i>I</i> think it is funny. But I wasn't sure that
  <i>you</i> would. May I apologize for underrating your capacity for
  humour?"</p>

  <p>Tinker, the chairman, rapped on the table with his knuckles.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;if you two will hire a hall, sometime, the rest of us will be
  happy to attend. For the moment, you're both out of order, I think. Let us
  proceed with our business."</p>

  <p>The meeting adjourned, presently. As Dinny passed Joan, who stood in the
  doorway of the parlour, she whispered, "Wait."</p>

  <p>When the others had gone, she returned to the parlour, where Dinny,
  standing by the table, was leafing a magazine.</p>

  <p>"Dinny&mdash;I wish you wouldn't."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said contritely. "But the chap's always needing a
  trimming... and never getting it... not properly."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I think I know why you feel that way." Joan motioned toward the
  divan, and they sat. "Mr. Kling has been very annoying in his attitude
  towards my father.... I think you like my father, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"You know I do, Joan. I would do anything for him!"</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;don't try to fight his battles. I don't want this to sound
  ungrateful, Dinny, but it won't help my father for you to be on his side....
  Because&mdash;well, you see, you're too often on the <i>wrong</i> side! And
  you are so dreadfully savage and sarcastic that you infuriate people!"</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Dinny, slowly, "if you think it annoys your father...
  for me to be loyal to him, I'll not intrude again."</p>

  <p>Impulsively Joan laid her hand on his, and exclaimed, impatiently:</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;there you go!... That's just what I mean... that ironical...
  cruel&mdash;" Hot, angry tears welled in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Dinny rose, glanced at his watch, smiled.</p>

  <p>"We won't quarrel," he said, indulgently.</p>

  <p>Joan stood, facing him, eyes flashing.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we will, Dinny Brumm! You've been perfectly hateful! I don't know
  what all's happened in your life to poison you so, but if you don't get rid
  of it&mdash;somehow&mdash;you'll be wretched forever!... And so will
  everybody else that... that's interested in you... at all."</p>

  <p>Unable to think of an appropriate reply, and stirred to frank admiration
  of her militant pose, Dinny grinned, appreciatively.... Gad&mdash;she was a
  superb creature!</p>

  <p>Joan turned away, utterly exasperated.</p>

  <p>"I won't keep you!" she snapped out, hotly. "Good night.... The maid will
  show you out."</p>

  <p>Dinny followed her toward the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Joan," he called, "please&mdash;don't be angry."</p>

  <p>She hesitated, turned, waited.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean to hurt your feelings," he said, gently.</p>

  <p>He reached out both hands, and looked down repentantly into her
  reproachful eyes. She took his hands, and regarded him with an expression of
  pity.</p>

  <p>"Why do you do it&mdash;Dinny?" she said, pleadingly.</p>

  <p>"Because"&mdash;Dinny was serious, sincere, contrite&mdash;"because I
  can't help it!... I was started&mdash;all wrong.... The world's full
  of&mdash;full of bunkum, and I can't help laughing at it.... I fancy I shall
  keep on laughing at it, until I die.... That's the way I'm made.... I'm
  sorry, sometimes, and wish I wasn't that way.... But&mdash;you mustn't
  trouble yourself about it."</p>

  <p>She loosed her hands, slowly, and stood looking down at the floor.</p>

  <p>"Good night, then," she said, huskily, with a wan little smile.</p>

  <p>"Good night&mdash;Joan&mdash;dear."</p>

  <p>Very tenderly, Dinny drew her, unresisting, into his arms. She laid a soft
  palm on his cheek, and looked up into his face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dinny," she whispered, "please... please!"</p>

  <p>He bent to kiss her. She shook her head, buried her face in his breast.
  Dinny gently touched her hair with his lips. His voice trembled a little when
  he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I'll try, dear, to be good," he said, sincerely.</p>

  <p>"Honest?" Joan was smiling through her tears. She raised her head slowly,
  rather shyly, cheeks aflame.</p>

  <p>"Honest!" promised Dinny, tightening his embrace.</p>

  <p>Joan closed her eyes. The hand that was laid against his cheek moved
  slowly upward, caressed his hair, circled his neck.</p>

  <p>Very gently, Dinny's lips sought hers. It was a chaste, comradely kiss
  that he offered her, symbolic of a resolution to cultivate a more amicable
  spirit. Only on such terms, he felt, would Joan permit this intimacy.
  Passionately in love with her, it was difficult to discipline that kiss.</p>

  <p>To Dinny's amazement and exultation, Joan met the endearment in quite
  another attitude than that of a pleased reformer enheartening a penitent to
  keep his vows. At the touch of his lips, she responded as to an electrical
  contact, drew a long, convulsive breath that confessed the depth of her
  emotion, and the kiss she gave suffused him with an ecstasy he had never
  known.</p>

  <p>They clung to each other for a full minute before Joan, her lips still on
  his, shook her head ever so slightly, and then, with a contented sigh, laid
  her cheek affectionately against his shoulder.</p>

  <p>After he had gone to his room, that night, Dinny sat for a long time on
  the edge of his bed staring straight ahead, trying to reconstruct each
  separate instant of that exultant experience. Had any other girl than Joan
  Braithwaite consented to&mdash;much less joined him in&mdash;a kiss like
  that, he might have wondered a little about her.</p>

  <p>But, because the girl was Joan, the warm, tingling memory of it carried a
  peculiar possessive, protective tenderness. His eyes were wet. Joan belonged
  to him! He walked to the window and looked out, down the hill, at the big
  house, loving it because it sheltered Joan. ... Dear Joan!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The next afternoon at the Athenian Literary Society, which
  Dinny rarely attended, believing it worth a fifty-cent fine to spare himself
  the irksomeness of sitting through a protracted session of parliamentary
  wind-bagging, Kling made a patriotic speech.</p>

  <p>As an alumnus, he was there on invitation, and glad to be back in the
  spacious room, where, he averred, he had learned to speak on his feet.</p>

  <p>His attacks on Doctor Braithwaite were ostensibly cryptic, at first, but
  as he warmed to his theme, the clumsy devices of indirect accusation were
  abandoned. It was an insolent address. Dinny hotly scowled through it,
  promising himself that Kling would have to pay for his surly impudence.</p>

  <p>That night, he executed the threat he had held over Kling, so blind with
  indignation he gave no thought to consequences. What Joan might think of it
  did not occur to him.</p>

  <p>Next day, the campus hummed with the story. Dinny called up Joan, but she
  was not at home.</p>

  <p>On Monday, current copies of <i>The Iconoclast</i> were in circulation.
  Dinny had sold it many weeks earlier; had almost forgotten it. But Joan,
  without considering how much time must have elapsed between the composition
  and publication of this brutal effrontery, avoided him when they met in the
  hall; ignored him in the class-room.</p>

  <p>He dropped her a note, attempting explanation, but was indiscreet enough
  to jest about the article as "a hang-over" from his "unredeemed estate." The
  note, plus the spreading rumour that Dinny had made savage war on Kling, so
  distressed Joan that she was at a loss to know what to reply. While she
  debated, the faculty moved in the direction of punishment for Dinny. Her
  father's affairs were already sufficiently complicated. Any attempted
  reconciliation with Dinny, at this moment, might add to the President's
  problems. She waited.</p>

  <p>Almost before she realized the swiftness with which Dinny's case had
  become a <i>cause célèbre,</i> he had left town. He telephoned to her. Mrs.
  Braithwaite answered.</p>

  <p>"May I speak to Miss Braithwaite?"</p>

  <p>"Who is speaking, please?"</p>

  <p>"This is Dinny Brumm."</p>

  <p>"Miss Braithwaite is not in, Mr. Brumm."</p>

  <p>Her voice was not unkind, but Dinny interpreted.</p>

  <p>Considering how much variegated disaster menaced Doctor Braithwaite, from
  all sides, it was obvious that the family was better off without any further
  traffic with Dinny. He appreciated the situation, and felt almost sympathetic
  with Joan's mother. She had done the right thing.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LOUNGING with athletic arms negligently disposed along the
  back of a slatted, sun-drenched iron seat in Central Park, overlooking
  undulous acres of verdant velvet, the prosperous young creator of the column
  capped "Green Cheese" absently twirled an inventive pencil between thumb and
  finger-tips; but he was worried.</p>

  <p>His deep-set, grey-green eyes, shaded by a brim-turned felt hat of the
  same colour, were half-closed against the bright distractions, the tiny
  crow's-feet at their outer corners registering an habitual, detached
  amusement which he daily sent to market in forty newspapers.</p>

  <p>On the broad gravel path immediately before him, perambulators that had
  cost thrice the price of Uncle Miles's jump-seat surrey leisurely trundled
  smug, superior kewpies whose interest in the narrow ribbons dependent from
  their lace bonnets seemed an earnest of future adroitness in the fingering of
  ticker-tape.</p>

  <p>A hundred yards down the slope, kneeling around the lip of a gigantic
  concrete saucer, small scions of the well-to-do alternately righted
  unseaworthy sloops and wiped April noses on monogrammed coat-sleeves. Farther
  down and to the left of this mimic ocean, clumps of tourists, undistressed by
  the discomforts of their caged kin, idled from the monkey-house toward the
  bear-pits, pausing briefly to glance up through the untidy steel netting of
  the squawking, acrid aviary.</p>

  <p>Sometimes&mdash;as today&mdash;the manufacturer of Green Cheese glumly
  wished he had chosen another vehicle for his syndicated satires than these
  fantastic "conversations in the moon"; but they had proved immensely popular
  and profitable&mdash;even more so than his earlier, riskier series of
  "Unfrosted Persimmons," whose astringent quality had so unexpectedly piqued
  the public palate, jaded by a quadrennium of sentimental superlatives ranging
  all the way from lush and morbid pathos and the agony of hair-tearing despair
  to the loud and hysterical hallelujahs of Utopianism at its ultimate peak of
  drooling idiocy.</p>

  <p>Still young in years but prematurely seasoned by cumulative disillusion,
  Dinny Brumm had been among the earliest to venture a bit of whimsical
  spoofing, indulgently phrased in the soothing "Now, now; there, there; come,
  come," of the psychiatrist making his afternoon rounds in a genteel madhouse.
  Dinny approached his increasing constituency gently, regarding them as
  convalescing victims of a pestilential neurosis superinduced by a long
  debauch under potent emotional stimulants.</p>

  <p>At the outset, his covert fun-poking at the perfervid apostles of idealism
  who, watch in hand, galloped to catch trains that hurled them from platform
  to platform, where daily and nightly, they beckoned and bellowed&mdash;saving
  the world for democracy, for civilization, for altruism, for our children and
  our children's children, for God the Father and Christ His Son&mdash;had been
  as shocking as a ribald joke told in a funeral address at the expense of the
  corpse.</p>

  <p>But presently it began to appear that a considerable section of the
  public&mdash;weary unto death of the unconscionable nonsense brayed and
  bleated from ten thousand pulpits, lecture halls, luncheon clubs, women's
  clubs, open forums, and whithersoever the tribes of salvation-hucksters went
  up&mdash;found itself grinning over the audacities of a youthful cynic who,
  with no reputation to lose, offered comic relief in the midst of the
  wearisome epilogue following the final act of a tragedy that had spun itself
  out overlong.</p>

  <p>Two years later, there was none so timid for whom it was not entirely safe
  and righteous to damn war and invent wry jokes to caricature the apostles and
  slogans of the noble cause that aspired to world-brotherhood and the Golden
  Age; but, at the hour, only the venturesome dared apply for such hazardous
  employment.</p>

  <p>Dinny had promised himself the luxury of sweet revenge. Plenty of times he
  had staggered under the garbage and scoured the latrines for failing to wear
  the right expression of empty-eyed awe when stiffening to salute the
  self-conscious lieutenant who, only last winter... or was it the year
  before?&mdash;no matter... used to mince, limp-wristed, to the light of the
  department-store door, a bolt of silk under his arm, trailed by the plumber's
  haughty spouse, murmuring, meekly:</p>

  <p>"It's a real mauve, madame, as you shall see&mdash;and prettuh, very
  prettuh."</p>

  <p>But the lieutenants and the captains and the majors were not permitted to
  come to bat every day in the column of "Unfrosted Persimmons." The civilian
  orators had their innings. Dinny was at his best when pitching them a fast
  one.</p>

  <p>The ubiquitous civilization-savers, to whom everybody had listened
  spell-bound, in a desperate state of finger-gnawing fright, as they luridly
  depicted the crash and clatter of a blown-up world, were now become somewhat
  of a nuisance. With the arrogance of Jonah they had howled disaster into the
  ears of the populace until they, themselves, were fallen afoul of a nasty
  psychosis unpleasantly akin to sadism.</p>

  <p>The war was over that had been so great a Godsend to the large of mouth
  and small of faith, but the frantic ink and screech of the calamity-merchants
  was unabated.... Ethical journals of opinion wagged an ominous pen. Prophetic
  fists pounded verbally inspired Bibles, and cited Jeremiah the empty-umpth
  chapter beginning at the orty-erth verse. Journey-man seers stamped the
  rostra of village chautauquas pointing bamboo fish-poles at the seething hot
  spots on the reconstructed map of Yurrup.... Could civilization survive?...
  Was not the whole social order on the rocks?... What shall we do to be
  saved?... (What's become of the treasurer who was supposed to hand me my
  cheque?)... Let us humble ourselves before God!... Socialize! Evangelize!
  Fraternize! Organize! Do your bit! Till it hurts! The ushers will now
  distribute the pledge-cards. Dinny had a good time.</p>

  <p>It pleased his whim, one day, to set the clock back to the closing hours
  of the fifteenth century. Indulgences were on sale at the tail of a cart....
  Step up, terror-stricken, and bail your bloody brothers out of hell!...
  Yesterday, with valour shining in their eyes, they went forth to make the
  supreme sacrifice for you and yours.... Christ leading on... who had come not
  to bring peace, but a sword.... Come, now, wipe out this stain... for war is
  crime, and soldiers are murderers&mdash;shame on them!</p>

  <p>The more devastating of these ironical gas-bombs, charged from the
  corroded coils of Dinny Brumm's bitter laboratory, were thrown from the pages
  of the candidly caustic magazines of protest, the sour humour of the
  "Unfrosted Persimmons" being somewhat less diabolical. "Green Cheese" was
  even more gentle and conciliatory.</p>

  <p>Dinny yawned, and resharpened his pencil. He was tiring of his product.
  However&mdash;one could endure a certain amount of drudgery and boredom over
  the daily output of Green Cheese, seeing its present market value was two
  hundred and fifty dollars a week, just as one had endured the tedium of
  plucking and hurling the Unfrosted Persimmons whose spontaneous acceptance at
  the hands of the disenchanted had liberated him from his nightly desk at
  <i>The Philadelphia Ledger,</i> and set him loose to live where and as he
  pleased.</p>

  <p>He was not a conscious apostle of common-sense. Had anyone asked him if,
  in the spirit of a crusader, he were not aware of his mission to a public
  whose emotions had been scarified and cauterized by the lancets and blisters
  of the sensation-smiths and calamity-quacks until there wasn't another kick
  left in them, Dinny would have denied it with a scowl.... "Crusade?...
  Mission?... Me?... Hell!"</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he daily polished the mirror so that the people might see
  themselves almost exactly as they were&mdash;a pitilessly honest glass it
  was, that neither convexed to them a reflection of cherubic amiability nor
  concaved them to misanthropy.</p>

  <p>In these genially mocking "Green Cheese" columns, synchronous in two
  scores of widely read papers, the Man in the Moon, ancient, wise, sated as
  Solomon, drowsily replied to the imbecilic queries and comments of Luna, the
  Lady of the Moon, an effervescent flapper.</p>

  <p>A few experimental lines, raw material to be fabricated for today's
  output, had been scribbled on the bulky wad of paper reposing on Dinny's
  lanky knee.</p>

  <p>"Lookit, Gramp!" pointed Luna, wetting a finger and setting a curl.
  "Lookit what they got now!"</p>

  <p>"More progress, I dare say.... Another epoch-making invention. ...
  Civilization at the cross-roads... now marching on, eh?... Heads up...
  nothing to fear... <i>altus et altior....</i> What's this, Luna; an electric
  banana-peeler?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be ridiculous, Gramp!... It's a new cigarette-lighter. They're all
  quite mad about it!"</p>

  <p>"Out of matches?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!&mdash;but this automatic lighter's so much more
  convenient.... It's a little metal lamp&mdash;all the way up to sixty
  dollars. You unscrew at the bottom and pour in a special kind of oil. When
  you want a light, all you have to do is snap a small iron wheel a few times
  with your thumb&mdash;it doesn't seem to hurt the thumb very much unless you
  have to do it too often&mdash;and it scratches a flint that quite frequently
  strikes an electric spark that sets off a little wick that's soaked in the
  oil, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;it's more convenient?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be so grumpy, Gramp!... Aren't you interested in progress, at
  all?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Very shortly after Dinny Brumm, fresh from the pandemonium
  that was Magnolia, had walked into the office of Mr. Steinberg to inquire
  what <i>The Cincinnati Times-Telegram</i> expected him to do, interesting
  things began to happen.</p>

  <p>The first month&mdash;he had been told to "sub" for Clint Mitchell on
  "police and fires" until he learned at least the points of the
  compass&mdash;was too routinish and uneventful for his liking; but presently
  life was galvanized by the enlivening hubbub stirred when it was announced
  there would be a visitation from Zandy Craig&mdash;<i>the</i> Craig, of the
  Craig Syndicate&mdash;first week of May.</p>

  <p>The "T-T"&mdash;employees of <i>The Times-Telegram</i> always abridged the
  name&mdash;was in a grand state of excitement. Everything was speeded up,
  soaped, scraped, scoured, scrubbed, sponged, shined. High efficiency
  prevailed.</p>

  <p>Reporters put fresh ribbons on their machines (it was in the uncoddled
  days when reporters were still able to do that for themselves), cleared their
  desks, bought a new hat. The girls at the Want Ads counter stopped doing
  their nails in the presence of customers. Linotype operators tried valiantly
  to break themselves of the reprehensible habit of tossing pied slugs back
  into the pot. Windows were washed in the composing-room. The devil wore a
  clean shirt.</p>

  <p>For Zandy Craig saw everything; eyes of a hawk and nose of a hound....
  Last time he was here, the entire Circulation was fired in a body, every
  man-jack of them. Forty salaries were raised. <i>The Enterprise</i> was
  bought in and swallowed up. A new off-set press was installed. Four pages of
  funnies were added.... The very building had rocked on its bricks for six
  dizzy days. God only knew&mdash;certainly no one else, not even Mr.
  Steinberg&mdash;what might happen this time.... You just kept out of the way,
  and hoped for the best. If what you were doing satisfied Craig, all he wanted
  out of you was silence&mdash;and damn' little o' that!... So went the tribal
  chatter out of apprehensive mouth-corners.</p>

  <p>It had not occurred to Dinny that the omnipotent Zandy Craig could be of
  more intimate concern to him than as the Dread Jehovah of Journalism, his
  absentee boss. He was related to the great Craig as a blade of grass to a
  forty-acre meadow. The dim, far-away figure of the contemptible fugitive who
  had left in the lurch an unsophisticated, over-trustful, little
  school-teacher, had never been spoken of in his presence as "Zandy" Craig. He
  did not even reflect upon the unlikelihood of his unknown parent's
  achievement of so great prominence. The name roused in him no curiosity, at
  all.</p>

  <p>Everybody spruced up for the big dinner at the Barstow, with Zandy Craig
  as both host and guest, and all hands present, as was the custom, from the
  Managing Editor's office down to the coal-bins. The dinner was always an
  inspiration. Besides, Craig was not niggardly with the fare. You heard what
  was good for you, and what you'd&mdash;By God&mdash;better do if you wanted
  to work for <i>The T-T,</i> but you also ate the food of a gentleman, and
  plenty of it.</p>

  <p>Dinny sat by Mitchell, whom he easily liked, far down the T-shaped table
  seated for six score. The common herd had been settled and was fussing with
  its spoons.</p>

  <p>"You never saw him," remarked Mitchell, offering a cigarette; "quite
  strikin' personality."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Dinny, furnishing a light. "He would be, of course."</p>

  <p>"Straight as the scales&mdash;and hard as hell."</p>

  <p>A slight commotion at the door of the banquet-room signalled the arrival
  of the important guest and his retinue. Dinny followed with intent,
  inquisitive eyes the progress of the tall, dynamic, early-frosted figure, as
  he strode to the seat of honour, preceded by the Mayor and Mr. Steinberg, and
  trailed by Mr. Latimer, the City Editor, and Mr. Orton, of the Circulation
  Department. A genuine outburst of applause acknowledged Zandy Craig's advent.
  Chairs were pushed back and the company stood, still pounding its hands.
  Dinny joined in the clapping, through sheer animal reflex to the racket,
  hardly conscious of what he did.</p>

  <p>The big man signed to his slaves with a downward push of the heel of his
  long, strong hand, and they sat. The orchestra was off at full gallop. A
  battery of white-jacketed waiters trooped in, with soup aloft, a buzz of
  conversation broke out, and the dinner was in high gear.</p>

  <p>"Dinny," oracularly observed Mitchell, who was short and chubby, "it takes
  beef to make a big man. You've gotta be tall if you're ever goin' to look
  down on 'em."</p>

  <p>"Napoleon was rather&mdash;brief, wasn't he?" suggested Dinny,
  encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Not on a horse," defended Mitchell. "Napoleon never hollered at his tall
  grenadiers unless he was walkin' on four legs."</p>

  <p>"How about us getting a horse, Clint?"</p>

  <p>"Us? Me&mdash;you mean. You're rangy enough. Tall as Craig, himself....
  Damned if you don't look a little like him. Same eyes; sort o' navigator
  eyes&mdash;if you know what I mean."</p>

  <p>Dinny, leaning far forward to gaze down the long table, was only
  half-conscious of Mitchell's prattle. Tugging suddenly out of his mesmerism,
  he returned to Clint with an abstracted stare, apologizing for his
  inattention.</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, old man; you were saying something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yeah," drawled Clint, indifferently, "you better come to, and munch your
  fodder."</p>

  <p>Handsome Bob Moore, Municipal Building and The Courts, leaned across Dinny
  to inquire: "Know if he brought the angel along, this time, Clint?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't heard. She's probably in school, some place." Then, for Dinny's
  enlightenment, Mitchell added: "Craig's got a girl, seventeen or eighteen,
  that left a trail o' destruction behind her, last July. Moore's never been
  the same man. They told him off to show her the finish of a dramatic lawsuit
  in Circuit Court&mdash;she'd never seen a trial&mdash;and he was so stampeded
  by her amazin' pulchritude that he forgot where they were goin' and took her
  to a ball-game. It was reported the old man asked her, that night, who won
  the case, and she said, 'The Sox.'... But, even at that, Bob had his pay
  raised, when he thought he'd be fired."</p>

  <p>Young Welland, Clubs and Theatres, nosed in from Mitchell's left.</p>

  <p>"Yeah, she's here, all right. Saw her in the lobby with Mrs. Steinberg,
  Mrs. Forsythe, and some other swells. All dolled up to kill and cripple. Very
  easy to look at.... Guess they were going to a show."</p>

  <p>Dinny was having difficulty keeping his eyes away from the head of the
  table. It was a curious, unaccountable fascination. Never had he been so
  engrossed by a personality. He wished he could be close enough to hear
  Craig's voice as he turned from one to the other of his immediate companions,
  occasionally putting down his fork to make short, expressive gestures with
  both hands.</p>

  <p>Successive courses came, and clattered away on sagging white shoulders.
  Coffee arrived, smoke curled upward, chairs diagonalled.... "Pardon my back,
  old son."... Legs crossed, comfortably. Eyes roved to the gavel-zone.</p>

  <p>Steinberg hitched about, stroked his chin, rose slowly, pulled down his
  waistcoat, told an old yarn about Henry Watterson, teased the Mayor
  discreetly, waited for the polite chuckle, waved a John-Baptist hand toward
  Craig, and backed out of the picture.</p>

  <p>Craig was on his feet quickly.... No stories, no felicitations, no
  preamble. He strode swiftly, confidently, to the end of the plank and dived
  off. Dinny never forgot that first sentence&mdash;crisp, curt, cold,
  impudent, kinetic, arresting! With bushy black brows contracted, and
  narrowing his grey-green eyes, Craig bit his opening sentence into five
  ragged chunks and spat it, growled it:</p>

  <p>"The only chemicals&mdash;imperative to evolution&mdash;are water, blood,
  and ink&mdash;and the greatest of these&mdash;is ink!"</p>

  <p>Craig talked for an hour, his voice rarely rising from the deep,
  searching, commanding, dynamic diapason of the dogmatic credo with which he
  began.</p>

  <p>He was speaking to a hard-boiled, blasé crowd, not only fully aware of its
  thick hide, its cynicism, its fish-eyed challenge that dared any man to speed
  its heart, tighten its throat, or flush its temples; but unafraid of it.
  Dinny viewed him as a reckless lion-tamer, stalking arrogantly into the cage,
  blacksnake whip confidently flicking bristling manes into a corner.... Shades
  of Nietzsche&mdash;but Craig was hard!</p>

  <p>Now he had eased up on the old brutes with the long, yellow fangs, and was
  growling at the cubs; trying to make lithe lions of them... . Dinny responded
  to the tug. Gad&mdash;but life seemed potential, the way Craig talked about
  it! In his hands, a driving, obsessing ambition seemed august! You wanted to
  thrust out impatient elbows, crackle your chrysalis, and take wing!</p>

  <p>One life!... One chance!... One enchanted youthtime!... Make it pay!...
  Hurl into it!... Take the cash, and let the credit go!... Be
  something&mdash;quickly!... Let the dead bury the dead!</p>

  <p>Dolts and dawdlers, pull up along the right kerb and let the unscared
  strong go by. If you haven't the nerve to pass your sluggish leader, don't
  hog the middle of the road, but clear the way!... Live
  precariously!&mdash;and like it!... Be sportsmanly; gamble with Life; play
  for big stakes!... Choose now&mdash;whether to scoop or be scooped&mdash;all
  the way to the box that latches on the outside!... My God&mdash;but Craig was
  cruel!</p>

  <p>And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;Dinny Brumm was drawn to him with an uncanny
  yielding. Craig had the idea. Craig was a superman, made of superstuff. It
  was impossible to withstand the attraction of the man's kinetic energy.
  Dinny's pulse pounded with an admiration close to idolatry.</p>

  <p>He shuffled along with short, impeded steps, thick in the ruck that jammed
  the exits, and cramped with a chunk of the pack into the noxious elevator.
  The passengers were silent, a bit constrained. Dinny wanted only to hurry to
  his room, twenty blocks away and up the hill, to beat out a few hot
  resolutions while they were still malleable with the glow of the Craig
  forge.</p>

  <p>The lobby swarmed. The revolving, leather-lipped street-door
  spun&mdash;plop, plop, plop, plop&mdash;as the animals, in line, left for the
  kennels; the grizzled and mangy, the playful and cocky, the yawning and
  gamboling.... Dinny squared his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Mitchell was calling from the rear, somewhere. Annoyed, but complacent, he
  left the line, sauntered back, inquired.</p>

  <p>"Moore's met the Craigess, Dinny.... We're asked to watch her nibble a
  rarebit in the grill, and do her a little genuflection. Want to?"</p>

  <p>"Sure.... Thanks, Clint."</p>

  <p>The princess was already at court, and presiding uncommonly well. No need
  to have her identified as the daughter of Craig; it was on her face, in her
  eyes, in her hands. She was Craig&mdash;young Craig, drawn to about
  three-fifths scale. The Craig <i>savoir faire</i> pleasantly veneered what
  promised to be&mdash;when it matured&mdash;a ligneous substratum of
  will-to-power. She was not haughty, not arrogant, not vain; but consciously
  assured. Whatever-it-was-she-had seemed to be saying: "It's mine: give it me:
  thanks."</p>

  <p>Nobody needed to guess which was the head of the round table, seated for
  six. All were standing, for the moment, surrounded by twice as many more,
  half of them collected by Mitchell, en route to the grill. In the polite
  bedlam of introductions and renewals of acquaintance, Dinny, with no
  responsibilities, stared appraisingly at the self-possessed blonde, frankly
  envying her birthright to a magnetic personality that dominated from her
  grey-green eyes and firm, red mouth, and pink palms.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mr. Brumm?" She gripped his hand like a man, and gave him
  a steady, smiling look of honest welcome, same as she had done for young
  Fitzgibbon, who had come along with <i>The Enterprise</i> since her last
  visit.</p>

  <p>"It must be nice to come back," said Dinny, "and find everybody so happy
  to see you, Miss Craig."</p>

  <p>She had not released his hand. Her smile had vanished. Her eyes had
  contracted slightly, and shuttled from his brows to his chin, as if
  attempting to recover a long-forgotten acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"You're new, too; aren't you?" she said. "I'm sure I never met you.... Did
  I?" She shook her head, still searching his eyes. "Funny," she added, half to
  herself.</p>

  <p>He made way for the others behind him. She released his hand slowly.</p>

  <p>"Auntie Alison, Mr. Brumm would like to meet you. Mrs. Forsythe, Mr.
  Brumm." Her eyes momentarily dropped to the hand he extended, and again swept
  inquisitively to his face, before she turned to listen to Mitchell's next
  presentation.</p>

  <p>"My son&mdash;Mr. Victor Forsythe, Mr. Brumm," murmured the tall, rather
  imperious lady in mourning.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Steinberg, this is Mr. Brumm," reiterated Victor, whose sleek, black
  hair was extraordinarily long. The tip of a white handkerchief peeped from
  the sleeve of his dinner-coat.</p>

  <p>Mitchell's recruits were insisting that the diners resume their seats, and
  most of them, waving good nights with smiles, were drifting away. Dinny
  followed, laggard, ostensibly lingering a little for Mitchell and Moore, in
  the process of tearing themselves away from the girl who paid flattering
  attention over her white shoulders. Something she was saying now made them
  glance in his direction.</p>

  <p>"Dinny!" beckoned Moore.</p>

  <p>He obediently joined them, inquiry in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Miss Craig wants you," explained Clint, adding, with pretended pique and
  as if the remark were <i>sotto voce,</i> "lucky devil!"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brumm," she asked, almost inquisitorily, "did you ever work for any
  of my father's other papers?"</p>

  <p>Dinny shook his head, regretfully.</p>

  <p>"Should I have?"</p>

  <p>She did not join in the chuckle with which his colleagues rewarded his
  naïve query.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind telling me where all you have lived?" she persisted, as to a
  witness under cross-examination.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;we'll leave you now," interjected Mitchell, breezily, laying a
  propelling hand on Moore's shoulder. "It would be like you, Dinny, to
  discover that you and Miss Craig had been schoolmates, or something.... This
  chap has more lives than a cat, Miss Craig... . Got fired from college for
  knockin' the steeple off the Y.M.C.A., and made 'em take him back and pay him
  for lost time.... Good-night!... See you some more, I hope."</p>

  <p>"Nowhere you're likely to have been," said Dinny, when the clamour had
  subsided. "Indiana&mdash;and Magnolia College.... We never met before, Miss
  Craig.... But"&mdash;recklessly&mdash;"now that we have, let's pretend we're
  old friends."</p>

  <p>He had laid his hand on the back of her chair, and when she looked up with
  still serious eyes to reply, her warm, supple body glowed against his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"I have never seen the Rookwood Pottery," she said.</p>

  <p>"Would tomorrow be convenient?"</p>

  <p>"About eleven, preferably. You work at night, don't you?" She was looking
  squarely into his eyes, sheltering her voice a little from her table
  companions.</p>

  <p>"And luncheon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I think so."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand, like a man, without coyness.</p>

  <p>"Good-night&mdash;Miss Craig," said Dinny, deferentially, as became an
  obscure employee taking leave of the magnate's daughter.</p>

  <p>"My name is Alison." Her lips barely moved, as she spoke, making no effort
  to disguise the fact that their conversation was private. Slowly she
  disengaged her long, strong hand, gave him another swift, serious scrutiny
  that circled his face and came to rest, for an instant, on his lips; and
  rejoined her company.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Alison was amazingly direct. The bland candour with which
  she ignored all the age-old subtleties of her sex, proclaiming in every look,
  tone, and gesture that Dinny Brumm was hers, by priority claim, all but took
  his breath away.</p>

  <p>It was not brazen, but transparently ingenuous. Dinny was neither amused
  nor annoyed. Her attitude was that of a wilful child daring all-comers to
  dispossess her of a toy. She had lost no time defining her convictions,
  indifferent alike to their possible effect on Dinny or any who might discover
  them.</p>

  <p>Even on that first morning, strolling beside an impressed executive, who,
  learning her identity, had volunteered to guide them through the celebrated
  pottery, she put herself to no bother of pretence that their interest in art
  accounted for their visit.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dabney would reverently hold up an exquisite vase, turning it, slowly,
  kaleidoscopically, inviting her to luxuriate in its mellow, parti-coloured
  translucence; but, with a nonchalance so unconcerned that Dinny was half
  sorry for the fine old pagan, Alison's eyes&mdash;briefly, abstractedly
  regarding the treasure&mdash;returned to search his face. She held tightly to
  his arm. Employees grinned, slyly; exchanged an appreciative wink....
  Honeymooners... second day out... utterly dippy... at least, the bride
  was.</p>

  <p>They lunched downtown at the Hofbrau, where Alison expressed no
  preferences when their fingers touched on the menu-card, and seemed unaware
  what she was eating. Dinny was surprised to find himself quite unembarrassed
  by this devotion. It was too genuine to provoke a smile.</p>

  <p>When she talked of herself, it was of herself and Geneva, herself and
  Montreaux, herself and Paris, as if she hadn't had an existence prior to her
  school-days in Switzerland, begun at fifteen, a few months after her parents'
  separation. When she talked of Dinny, it was all in the future&mdash;hot
  burning fires of ambition for Dinny. She all but suffocated him with it.</p>

  <p>The goal of success was leisure to live, write, and play in Europe. That's
  what Dinny must live for, look to, as the reward of genius multiplied by hard
  work. That's what she lived for, looked to&mdash;Europe! She implied they
  were both going there, one day. She did not say they were going on the same
  ship, but she described moonlit nights on the boat-deck in a dulcet tone and
  ecstatic mood whose implications were almost shockingly direct.</p>

  <p>Whether Zandy Craig was so confident of his dynamic daughter's
  self-sufficiency or so infatuated with his own business affairs that he gave
  her no thought, Dinny Brumm could not divine. It was enough to know that
  Alison's society, for ten memorable days, was not only accessible to him at
  all hours but flatteringly urgent.</p>

  <p>She casually disclosed that Mrs. Forsythe, who lived in New York, was
  visiting in Cincinnati, hopeful of interesting the well-to-do music-lovers of
  the city in the budding talent of young Victor, whom Alison catalogued,
  briefly, brutally, as "a bit of a cad, too dumb to succeed, and too lazy to
  bluff"; though she spoke almost tenderly, for her, of Tommy, the eldest, and
  Grace, who were forever stepping aside to make way for the callow prodigy in
  whose thin, listless fingers their ambitious mother had placed a fiddle
  almost before he was able to stand alone.</p>

  <p>Alison's disgust and distaste for Victor apparently had wrought somewhat
  of constraint between her and Mrs. Forsythe. In view of this circumstance,
  and also the exigent desire of her aunt to promote Victor among Cincinnati's
  art-patrons, perhaps it was natural that the girl should be independent of
  much restriction.</p>

  <p>After three crowded days in Cincinnati, almost constantly tied up in
  business conferences, Craig had scurried to Louisville. If Alison had been
  mistress of her own fate before, she was now even more completely in charge
  of her time. That time was Dinny's.</p>

  <p>At Alison's suggestion, they procured saddle-horses and rode all day in
  the hills. They ferried to Covington, and strolled in the country. She even
  had the audacity to call up Mr. Steinberg, late one afternoon, from some
  undesignated outpost, reporting that she had asked Mr. Brumm to entertain her
  for the evening, and he would not, therefore, appear at six, as was his
  custom; to which information Mr. Steinberg replied, dryly, that he hoped she
  would return him, eventually, to <i>The T-T,</i> unspoiled by the honour.</p>

  <p>Mulling over the whole tragic affair, later, Dinny found a little comfort
  in the fact that he had made no effort to capitalize Alison's devotion to the
  discredit of either of them. Nor was it easy to maintain his attitude of
  chivalry in the face of her quite abandoned, ruthless, reckless disclosure of
  a fascination for him to which she had yielded utterly.</p>

  <p>Every day tightened their intimacy. Often she hinted of a story she meant
  to tell him; he would be "quite frightfully" interested in it, as a
  scribbler, she knew; a long story, it was; she would let him have it when
  there was time. Dinny did not press her for it. She had implied that the tale
  impinged somehow on her family affairs.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was Saturday afternoon.... Craig had wired he was
  returning that night. Alison was to be packed and ready to leave with him for
  New York, next morning, at ten.</p>

  <p>They had tied their horses at the edge of a grove; had sauntered to a
  favoured rendezvous on the rocky lip of a glen; were promising each other
  more happy days when she returned with her father in the autumn.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you that story, now, Dinny," she said, snuggling close
  to him, and childishly tracing patterns on his lapel with a possessive
  finger.</p>

  <p>"Do," said Dinny. "Don't leave anything out."</p>

  <p>They leaned comfortably back against the warm rock, his arm around her,
  and the story began; just a bit diffidently, at first, for the story was not
  hers, really, but her father's.</p>

  <p>After ten minutes of Alison's calm narrative, paving the way for the most
  pleasant possible interpretation of her father's youthful tragedy by
  recalling many of his college experiences, the story abruptly shifted to
  another locale.</p>

  <p>Dinny relaxed his affectionate hold, and fumbled awkwardly in his coat
  pockets for cigarettes and matches.</p>

  <p>"You smoke too much, dear," said Alison, rather petulantly, annoyed at the
  distraction. "It isn't good for you.... Your hands are trembling.... Look!"
  She gripped his fingers. He did not reply or smile, but obdurately lighted
  the cigarette.</p>

  <p>"And then," continued Alison, sinking back against the rock, with a little
  sigh of disappointment not to find his arm there, "the most natural thing
  happened.... You know my father.... He's always been that way.... What he
  wants, he wants&mdash;that same day!"</p>

  <p>Dinny sat with eyes half-closed, listening, smoking; lighted another
  cigarette off the hot end; averted his face, savagely ran his fingers upward
  through his hair.</p>

  <p>Too disconcerted over his unaccountable mood to continue without some
  explanation, Alison broke off, presently, in the midst of a sentence, groped
  for his hand outspread on the rock between them, and asked, anxiously: "What
  is it, Dinny?"</p>

  <p>He did not turn to her or respond to the pressure of her fingers.</p>

  <p>"Dinny!" she entreated, pressing her face against his shoulder, "tell me,
  dear!... What did I do?... What's come over you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid"&mdash;he said, hoarsely, after some delay&mdash;"I can't tell
  you."</p>

  <p>She sat for a moment half-stunned and silent; then, with a little sob, she
  wrapped both arms tightly around his neck, and murmured, thickly: "I can't
  bear it, Dinny. You must be good to me. You've made me love you. I'm mad
  about you!"</p>

  <p>She raised her face, eyes closed, and offered him her parted lips.</p>

  <p>Suddenly haggard, Dinny gripped both her hands and drew them down, holding
  them vice-like against his knee. He swallowed, convulsively, and when he
  spoke, his voice was hollow.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't, Alison," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Don't you love me&mdash;even a little, Dinny?" she pleaded, with brimming
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't!... We can't!" he whispered, staring into her face, the muscles
  of his cheeks twitching.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked, inaudibly, her lips forming the query.</p>

  <p>He drew her head tightly to him, with a gesture of protection, as if to
  shield her from a blow, and, after a long minute, measured out the words,
  dully, one at a time:</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;are&mdash;my&mdash;sister."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Dinny never pretended this was the reason for his almost
  immediate decision to join the artillery unit mobilizing at Gettysburg, where
  the only artillery to be had, at that moment, was in the cemetery, slightly
  outmoded, as such things went.</p>

  <p>Neither did he ever explain to himself&mdash;much less to
  others&mdash;that he had waived the exemption Craig had provided somehow for
  "necessary members of editorial departments" (meaning everybody on the
  payroll) out of a sense of patriotic duty.</p>

  <p>He wryly, profanely, squirmed into an ill-fitting, ludicrous suit of khaki
  solely to save his face, and because he was quite too fit a specimen of
  physical vitality to be at large in civilian clothes at a time when so many
  hundreds of thousands of inspired patriots were rushing about extolling "the
  supreme sacrifice" as a noble privilege dangled before the enchanted eyes of
  "our valiant boys."</p>

  <p>Most of this exultant talk was offered by prophets and soothsayers of
  forty-five and up, who, albeit unable to make such renunciation themselves,
  were obviously uplifted by the thought that they were not standing in the way
  or taking the place of some other brother, hungering and thirsting for such
  righteousness as might be had by blowing a Teuton's head off with a handful
  of blasting-powder.</p>

  <p>Dinny's long, monotonous months in camp never benefited his native land by
  so much as a feather's weight; and, as for what he himself got out of it,
  either in discipline, experience, or stimulating friendships, the total
  result was exactly nil; unless his increasingly bitter cynicism, later
  capitalized to a monetary advantage, might be said to have fermented a little
  more through those hateful days.</p>

  <p>Even with unpleasant memories as his chief stock in trade, memories
  fetched to market and savoured by the similarly disillusioned, Dinny did not
  like to cogitate too much about his life at Gettysburg. The revulsion made
  him ill.</p>

  <p>As for "heroism," the most heroic act anybody in that camp was expected to
  perform consisted of the valiant refusal to commit the half-dozen murders for
  which Justice clamoured. Uniforms played weird tricks on people who, in
  civies, must have been halfway decent. It seemed to make very little
  difference about a man's previous character or relation to society, once he
  had been required to perfect the debasing art of revolving himself stiffly on
  one heel, by some reflex to a growl that brought the flat of his hand smack
  against the brim of his cap, the only way he could square with his own soul,
  for this indignity, was to look promptly for somebody else, even more debased
  than he, who might be rank-badgered to do him a kow-tow.</p>

  <p>Nobody ever saluted Dinny Brumm. Nobody would have saluted Dinny Brumm had
  he remained in the army until the Dawn of Everlasting Peace. He wasn't the
  type. According to the letter, he went through all the motions, which largely
  consisted in offering sustenance to the vanity of suddenly ordained
  Plattsburgers and surly non-coms; but Dinny's spirit&mdash;such as it
  was&mdash;refused to participate. His contempt glared in his eyes, against
  his will. It was chiselled in the deep lateral cleft between his lower lip
  and chin, quite beyond his control.</p>

  <p>They nearly let him die, during the flu epidemic, for offering frank
  comments, when half-delirious, relative to the institution with which he was
  connected, and the important members of its personnel. Before he was able to
  pull his trousers on again, he had learned a disheartening thing or two about
  the only profession for which he retained the slightest degree of respect.
  Always had he venerated the medical profession. Now he had discovered,
  regretfully, that a few metal buttons, a squeaking new belt, and a pair of
  spurred boots would frequently play the same amount of hell with the
  Hippocratic oath that they so incomprehensibly wrought in the disordered
  minds of formerly gracious grocery clerks and collegiate sons of honest
  farmers. He saw many a competent, generous, integrity-loving physician
  degenerate into a pompous, puffy, arrogant ass.</p>

  <p>Even the nurses went about, stiff-necked and consciously professional,
  mouthing the phrase, "War is no tea-party!"</p>

  <p>Dinny Brumm never went over the top, in France, at four a.m., but he spent
  six weeks in a military hospital, during the flu contagion, which called for
  almost as much patriotism, and lasted longer.</p>

  <p>On the day he went back into civilian togs, he promised himself he would
  get even with eight anthropoids, to wit; one captain, one lieutenant, two
  sergeants, two doctors, one orderly, and a nurse. He expected to hunt them
  down, in their postwar haunts, and pummel them to a jelly&mdash;all but the
  nurse, who was to be enticed to some public place and spanked in the presence
  of a large, appreciative audience.</p>

  <p>The determination to do these animals physical harm cooled, after a while,
  to an acidulous contempt which he occasionally tapped with a pen for the
  approval of demobilized thousands who, with ungodly glee, found in his
  devastating satires a vicarious vengeance.</p>

  <p>Alison wrote to him almost every week while he was "in the service."</p>

  <p>"I am not going to tell father," she stated, in her first note. "Poor man
  couldn't do anything about it, could he?... But, Dinny, darling, it is a
  frightful thing he's done to us."</p>

  <p>In sober truth, Dinny was incapable of viewing their tragedy with the same
  despair. Much as he admired Alison, their brief and unfortunate affair had
  not been of his own contriving. As for permanently linking his life with
  hers, he would as soon have married a hoisting-engine. Indeed, he had already
  begun to wonder, before discovery of their blood relationship, by what
  pleasant, painless process he might adroitly excuse himself from an impending
  attachment brimful of agony.</p>

  <p>He replied to her letters at the rate of one to three, painstakingly
  shifting their mood, by a calculated katabasis of affection which, within
  three months or so, had&mdash;at least so far as he was
  concerned&mdash;placed their relations on an approximately normal and sound
  footing.</p>

  <p>Angela wrote from the midst of a great revival in Hamilton that the Lord
  was blessing her labours in a miraculous way. It was not her first important
  revival, but the first in which she had starred. From now on, she expected to
  be at the head of her own company. Angela made no effort to disguise her
  natural gratification over the material features of her success. Dinny was
  pleased at this honest, albeit unintended, confession, and thought a little
  better of Angela. She didn't mind admitting that she was in the show
  business... on behalf of The Lord, to be sure, but&mdash;well&mdash;the show
  business.</p>

  <p>Joan Braithwaite was much in his thoughts. Upon the death of her father,
  he had written her a note. Her reply, some six weeks later (though he had
  promptly received a black-edged card from her mother, acknowledging his
  flowers), was postmarked New York. Whether she was there temporarily, or to
  stay, he did not know. That she expected no further correspondence was
  implied by the absence of a specific address. There was no one of whom he
  cared to inquire.</p>

  <p>Mr. Steinberg occasionally wrote to him, as became the employer of a
  volunteer hero, and there was a letter from his father, shortly after he
  enlisted, commending him on the splendid thing that he had done. The letter
  was dictated, and signed in a feminine hand, doubtless the same hand that had
  done a score of them.</p>

  <p>"Take this, Miss Rabbit, and make twenty originals for our enlisted
  employees. Miss Hare has the list of names."</p>

  <p>"Wish to see them, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;you can sign 'em."</p>

  <p>Dinny had chuckled while composing samples of conversation between his
  father and the stenographer, relative to the issue of Craig sentiments <i>in
  re</i> the war to end war, and save civilization.</p>

  <p><i>The T-T</i> confidently expected Dinny to come back and resume his
  place, wrote Mr. Steinberg, immediately after the Armistice; but there was to
  be no more of the family salt eaten; starve first!</p>

  <p>With surprising ease, he found a place on <i>The Philadelphia Ledger.</i>
  And then, with no more effort, the bright idea came, the "Unfrosted
  Persimmons" offered to be plucked, the mounting wave of prosperity rolled in,
  and Dinny was at liberty from clocks, bells, and whistles.</p>

  <p>He resolved to live in New York. Why not? It was the mecca of journalism
  and such as do syndicated columns. He did not go there saying to himself that
  Joan might be accidentally encountered; but, every bus that passed him, as he
  strolled Fifth Avenue, was thoroughly raked with a questing eye, the roll was
  swiftly called in the subway-train, traffic-blocked taxis were peered into
  with undefended impudence, the peacock-alley of the hotel, stuffily scented,
  was daily, gravely, tallied off&mdash;for Joan.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, though he was not given to worrying, naturally, Dinny found
  himself distressed over imagined predicaments in which she was posed in a
  tragic rôle. He was not quite able to reconstruct the face of a sad or beaten
  Joan; but, annoyingly often, he had a vision, at night, of lovely shoulders
  slumped in grief or pain, and the back of a curly head bowed in serious
  trouble.</p>

  <p>It became a mild obsession. He had no use for telepathy, and the slightest
  hint of any mystical thought-conveyance was, in Dinny's opinion, the sign of
  a weak mind. But&mdash;he was looking for Joan, and the longer and farther he
  looked, the more deeply he felt that when he found her she would be vastly in
  need of help.</p>

  <p>Dinny wished her well, but honestly wondered whether his anxiety might not
  be the product of an undefined hope that he could find Joan in a mood to
  accept his affection, even if at the price of some substantial favour of
  which she stood seriously in need. Indeed, he brooded so much over the matter
  that it became a definite fixation. Joan was in some kind of a scrape. Joan
  was hungry. Joan was walking the streets, looking for a cheap lodging-house.
  Joan was being imposed upon by some predatory rascal who controlled her
  rations.</p>

  <p>He even tortured himself with fears of which he was ashamed. Joan was, he
  had discovered, possessed of a pretty active "temperament." Could she take
  care of herself if ruthlessly stampeded?</p>

  <p>Today he was weary of the job that almost anyone might have envied him;
  wearied and worried.</p>

  <p>He interlaced his long fingers behind his head, closed his eyes, and
  re-canvassed all the expedients he had contemplated for the recovery of his
  Joan.</p>

  <p>Budding April in Central Park left him unstirred. Life was stale, flat,
  and unprofitable.</p>

  <p>He began to toy with the idea of a vagabond trip through some foreign
  country.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"HAD it ever occurred to you," elaborated Dinny, as the
  speakeasy waiter made off with their luncheon order, "that my gifted cousin
  Victor comes perilously near being an ass?"</p>

  <p>Tommy Forsythe traced a brief design on Joe Lombroso's white tablecloth
  with the tip of his spoon, and grinned wryly. It was not the amiable smile
  that so readily curved Tommy's lips. The grin threatened a bit of irony.</p>

  <p>"I've known that," he said, slowly, "for a long time; but&mdash;I hadn't
  supposed <i>you'd</i> ever find it out."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," returned Dinny, dryly, not a little surprised at the satirical
  come-back. Tommy was always so direct, so honest, so transparently
  sincere.</p>

  <p>"And may I inquire," pursued Tommy, with an excellent imitation of his
  cousin's calculated ridicule, "just when and how you contrived to make this
  belated discovery of my brother's asshood?... He arrived home only yesterday.
  You haven't seen him, have you?"</p>

  <p>Dinny nodded, sipped his cocktail.</p>

  <p>"Last night&mdash;down in the Village.... Tommy, he was just a little this
  side of unbearable."</p>

  <p>"'This side'?&mdash;looking from where?" Tommy's sour query rasped and
  crackled.</p>

  <p>"Who's been feeding you raw meat, Pollyanna?... My God&mdash;I didn't know
  you had it in you!" Dinny stared at his cousin with honest amazement.</p>

  <p>The Damon-and-Pythias comradeship of Dinny Brumm and Tom Forsythe, which
  was to rake fore and aft the whole gamut of emotion, from high delight to
  frantic misery, dated from the latter's receipt of a letter from Alison
  Craig, written from Seattle in June.</p>

  <p>Reticence impulsively discarded, Tom's dynamic young cousin had told him
  everything, even to confessing an affection for Dinny out of all proportion
  to their blood relationship; declared she "never expected to be the same
  woman again"; urged her beloved Tommy to lose no further time in hunting down
  this attractive collateral to their tribe.</p>

  <p>Before sunset, that day, telephone communication had been established
  between Tommy's office in the huge department store on Thirty-Fourth Street
  and Dinny's bohemian three-room suite in Greenwich Village, the shabby
  equipment of which&mdash;save for his sturdy typewriter-table, and his
  mother's little walnut desk&mdash;consisted of ill-related rubbish that had
  passed from one impecunious artist's keep to another's, each piece with a
  story to tell of battered ambitions, pitiful frugalities, and somewhat of
  despair.</p>

  <p>They spent the evening together in Dinny's rooms; and when, at midnight,
  they parted at his street-door, each felt the other an old friend.</p>

  <p>From the first, they were conscious of having little in common, as to
  temperament and outlook, Dinny finding his steady-going cousin amusingly
  naïve, boyishly enthusiastic over the elementary simplicities, a "typical
  case of arrested adolescence," though Tommy was nearly four years his senior,
  and had been extraordinarily successful in business.</p>

  <p>Tommy, encountering for the first time a determined cynic, obviously proud
  of his versatile collection of disbeliefs, distrusts, and disenchantments,
  regarded his new acquaintance with fascinated interest. Dinny Brumm didn't
  appear to belong to this world, at all. He had merely dropped in, as a
  spectator. He stood on the side-lines, paper and pencil in hand, watching the
  human race plod by, making ironical notes and grinning when it stumbled.</p>

  <p>In general appearance, the two were strikingly alike; of approximately the
  same height, weight, carriage, and pigments. They had the Craig eye,
  deep-set, searching, flanked by innumerable, faintly traced crow's-feet. They
  shared many an odd little trick of gesture and posture.</p>

  <p>Alison's suggestion that Dinny's relation to their clan should not be
  disclosed was approved by both of them. Tom promptly took his handsome new
  acquaintance home with him, the next Sunday evening, to the Forsythe
  apartment in White Plains; was pleased to observe how easily his mother
  accepted him; was surprised at Victor's enthusiasm, for Victor rarely had any
  use for Tom's friends; was anxious over the eager Grace's frank display of
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;you two things actually <i>look</i> alike!" commented Grace,
  with the half-impudent candour she had learned at the feet of Victor. "Aren't
  you afraid you'll quarrel?"</p>

  <p>Victor&mdash;at that time temporarily home from Italy at the suggestion of
  his mother, who, as his <i>impresario,</i> thought it prudent to have the
  talented violinist back, occasionally, "to conserve his contacts," and give
  the papers a chance to stir his potential public to remembrance of his
  existence, progress, goings and comings&mdash;instantly attached himself to
  Dinny with a proprietary air that threatened to elbow Tommy out of the
  picture.</p>

  <p>He couldn't conceive how his unimaginative old dray-horse of a brother,
  who knew everything about leather baggage and nothing about the creative
  arts, had captured the friendship of this sophisticate. He must see more of
  this Dinny Brumm. Brumm had the good sense to live in the Village, too, where
  everybody who was anybody in the field of the arts found freedom, stimulating
  companionship, encouragement, inspiration. It had taken Dinny only ten
  minutes to discover that the Forsythe establishment operated exclusively to
  serve the high destiny of Victor.</p>

  <p>Grace&mdash;dark, swarthy, shiny, with a button popped and loose
  hairpins&mdash;lived solely for the talented fiddler, fetching and carrying
  for him like an earnest retriever. Tom, nearing thirty, had apparently
  accepted it as his manifest destiny to devote the bulk of his salary to this
  lofty emprise.</p>

  <p>Once, after three months of increasing intimacy had broken down all
  reserve, Dinny ventured an expression of his feelings on this matter. He and
  Tommy were dining together at The Astor. Victor had sailed, that morning,
  returning to Ghili in Milan, bon-voyaged by a score of friends from the
  general vicinity of Washington Square, the family, and not quite enough
  inquisitive reporters to satisfy Mrs. Forsythe.</p>

  <p>"If I were you, Tommy, and Victor my brother, I'd request him to
  unstraddle himself from around my neck, and try walking on his own feet."</p>

  <p>Tommy had been tardy with a reply, shook his head, slowly.</p>

  <p>"Victor," he said at length, deliberately, "was born without feet. ...
  Victor's all soul."</p>

  <p>"But he eats!" persisted Dinny, indignantly.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand. It's a long story. You see&mdash;my
  mother&mdash;God bless 'er&mdash;managed to make quite an important personage
  of my father. She married him to make him, and succeeded. She was so
  ambitious for his success that for thirteen years she gave him twenty-four
  hours a day; became just a bit obsessed, maybe.</p>

  <p>"He died early&mdash;as you know&mdash;just as her hopes had been fully
  justified, and the rewards were rolling in.... It nearly finished her. I was
  only eleven, at the time, but her condition was serious enough to worry me,
  dreadfully, though just a kid. I'll not inflict you; but&mdash;she was in a
  sanitarium for six months.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;with the patience of a spider, she began all over. With a kind
  of fierce determination, she set about building Victor up for a career with a
  fiddle. Father had left practically nothing but the royalties on his
  phonograph records. This income was pretty good, at first; large enough to
  warrant expensive foreign study for Victor.... Afterwards, when the records
  of my father's voice began to slip&mdash;well&mdash;I couldn't let my mother
  down; could I?</p>

  <p>"Besides"&mdash;added Tommy, brightening&mdash;"Victor might put it
  over.... I sincerely hope so&mdash;for my mother's sake."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That had been in late September. It was November, now, of
  the succeeding year.</p>

  <p>Tommy Forsythe had just returned from a month in Mexico, full of
  interesting experiences, though not of the specific business errands that had
  taken him there. They rarely discussed Tommy's business. His phenomenal rise
  at Lacey's, from the shipping department up to the leather goods, and from
  successful salesman to assistant manager of the department, and from
  assistant to Department Chief, had been achieved in seven years; but Tommy
  did not often talk about it.</p>

  <p>Dinny rather regretted now that he had spoken his thoughts about the
  asininity of the parasitical Victor. Tommy had enough to bear. It would have
  been more gracious to keep off it. However, the subject had been pushed into
  the open: it would have to be discussed.... The picture of last night's
  affair in the Village drifted unpleasantly across Dinny's memory.</p>

  <p>He had been surprised to find Victor at the midnight arty-party in the
  untidy kitchen of The Red Bear. He had not known Victor was back. But, of
  course, he would lose no time coming to collect adulation from the art colony
  to which Dinny, at his fervent request, had earlier introduced him.</p>

  <p>Victor&mdash;still boastfully giddy from eight nauseous days of hurdling
  home over a shrieking sea which, he was averring, had put the doctor to bed
  in his cap and boots, and shattered not only a thirty-year Atlantic
  storm-record and the captain's elbow, but all the <i>Vendome's</i> crockery
  (not&mdash;he languidly chortled&mdash;that the latter had been much missed
  after the first twelve hours out)&mdash;had come to The Red Bear in tow of
  Diane Wimberly, a lanky, pink-haired, lower-case poetess who needed a dickey
  and a thousand dollars' worth of dentistry.</p>

  <p>Dinny had gone late to Felice's party. Once he had thought Felice quite
  interesting; but, in recent months, she had begun to weary him. In
  fact&mdash;the whole outfit, now that their novelty had worn off, lacked the
  originality and sparkle he had earlier imputed to the Villagers when, as a
  lonely stranger in New York, he was in need of quick and easy friends.</p>

  <p>Last night's bizarre affair had palled on him. The thing had been carried
  on in murky gloom feebly tinctured with magenta by a sooty lantern suspended
  from a peg in one of the massive, ancient, weathered-oak rafters&mdash;made
  of half-inch pine, and installed the previous summer.</p>

  <p>Victor&mdash;whose voice Dinny instantly recognized, even before his eyes
  had adjusted to the thick fog into which he groped&mdash;was seated in the
  dilapidated wheelbarrow intended for the "fagots," when there were
  any&mdash;The Red Bear, with reckless leanings toward Communism, pretended to
  be a Russian peasant's hovel&mdash;loathsomely detailing his recent
  discomforts at sea.</p>

  <p>Dinny's tardy arrival had not interrupted the undulating flow of his
  cousin's obnoxious reminiscence, nor was the company much distracted from its
  wan interest in the nautical narrative.</p>

  <p>Felice (Mamie) Manners (Johnson), the hostess, seated on the floor near
  the doorway, on an outspread newspaper, moved over a little to make room;
  and, pursing her scarlet mouth in apology for the humble offering, handed
  him, with her fingers, a large, pallid cream-puff which she ruefully
  extracted from the bottom of a brown-paper bag wherein the dessert course had
  been served.</p>

  <p>Dinny gingerly surveyed the gift, in the manner of a fastidious dowager
  examining a freshly exhumed skull, to the considerable amusement of Felice,
  who, a little drunk, was finding Victor tediously verbose, and wished to be
  playful.</p>

  <p>Wanting Dinny to know that she shared his carnival attitude toward her
  party, Felice strangled the empty bag, put the neck of it to her blood-red
  mouth, and with many long, cheek-distending, eye-bugging exhalations,
  proceeded to the task of its inflation; or nearly so, the final blast proving
  abortive due to her sudden conviction that her employment was ridiculous
  enough to merit a shocking explosion of suppressed mirth.</p>

  <p>Victor reproachfully glanced in the direction of the disorder, but calmly
  continued his monologue in a marcelled, affected baritone that inspired
  Dinny&mdash;a little drunk, also&mdash;to nudge Felice to attention while he
  feigned to take careful aim at the self-infatuated minstrel with the soggy
  token of her vanished hospitality.</p>

  <p>"Dare you!" whispered Felice, cupping her mouth with her hand, but Dinny
  reprovingly shook his head, pretending shocked regret that she would
  entertain the thought of such an effrontery.... Then he had stretched out his
  long legs, and tried to listen.</p>

  <p>Victor had finished with his disgusting <i>mal-de-mer</i> and was now in a
  messianic mood concerning the martyrdom of all true artists, and the
  tribulations of cat-gut and horse-tail artists in particular. Evidently
  somebody with a bit of money had recently stepped on Victor's slim,
  expressive fingers, for he was swishing about with a bare rapier that
  threatened to annihilate the well-to-do.</p>

  <p>Dinny wondered if this were the formal opening of Victor's campaign to
  impress his friends that he had a good excuse for failure; wondered if Victor
  was frightened, now that he had finally caught up with his exceedingly bright
  future, and had it to demonstrate.</p>

  <p>"Old Victor," reflected Dinny, as he sat listening to the makings of an
  alibi&mdash;"good old Victor knows time's up. He's either got to catch fish,
  or cut bait, or bail the boat."</p>

  <p>Abstractedly, Dinny had let his heavy eyes rove about the room while his
  blasé cousin deprecated the necessity for living in a world propelled by the
  almighty dollar.</p>

  <p>He was acquainted with all but two&mdash;the youth with the black velvet
  jacket and negligent Windsor tie, and the thin girl beside the youth, a blue
  beret drawn down over one eye, and a limp, home-made cigarette dangling
  precariously from her lip. The rest of them he knew quite well. Gregory,
  thirty-five and tuberculous, had confided freely. Gregory was writing an
  important novel; quite a bit daring, it was; might have to be privately
  printed. He had been at it now for upwards of three years. It was his first
  novel, though there had been a slim, mauve, deckle-edged (Gregory was ashamed
  of the deckle&mdash;but Aunt Agatha, of Phoenix, Arizona, who was financing
  it, quite insisted) volume of unpunctuated verse. Dinny had one of these, a
  presentation copy, autographed with a scrawl that beckoned the beneficiary to
  consult the title-page for verification of the little book's parentage.</p>

  <p>Vivacious Anne Pelham, who, to better her credit at the expense of her
  artistic integrity, had confessed her degeneration to drawing for commercial
  purposes&mdash;though what or for whom she drew Dinny had never
  learned&mdash;caught his vagrant eye, smiled, twinkled friendly fingers. The
  salute would cost him five dollars, thought Dinny. Anne already owed him
  thirty, not that he cared: the poor little fellow was always hungry.</p>

  <p>Sylvia (what the devil was her other name?&mdash;He had always thought of
  her as Carmichael) sang, or was going to... in opera... once she got a
  chance. Squat and shaggy Carmichael, next her, did portraits&mdash;quite
  atrocious ones, Dinny thought, though it was out of his line&mdash;which
  Sylvia, who lived adjacent on the fourth floor of a cheap and dirty,
  gas-reeking, bug-infested tenement house, and shared the bow-legged painter's
  kitchen, bath, studio, and fatuous ambitions, considered masterpieces.</p>

  <p>They had never struck Dinny Brumm quite this way before. He had
  sympathetically appraised them as a wistful tribe of aspirants to success in
  creating something interpretative of their thoughts. They had become suddenly
  ridiculous. There wasn't one of the dozen present, he reflected, who had ever
  done anything worth a second look. With the possible exception of the gloomy
  Victor, whose career was unpredictable, not a man or woman of the lot was
  likely ever to get to first base in the game whose lingo they prattled with
  such glib familiarity.</p>

  <p>At long last, Victor's monotonous harangue was concluded. The audience
  untangled its legs, milled about the room, yawned toward the door. Felice led
  Dinny to the little group still clustered about the wheelbarrow.</p>

  <p>Victor extended a limp, soft, slim hand.</p>

  <p>"'Lo, Dinny.... So you're here.... Who told you I was home?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody... I didn't know you were back."</p>

  <p>Somehow&mdash;the raw impudence of the chap annoyed him. His egotism was
  insufferable.</p>

  <p>"In fact," drawled Dinny, "we've ventured to have several little social
  affairs much like this, in your absence; just to keep our spirits up until
  you returned.... Hope you don't mind."</p>

  <p>No&mdash;Victor didn't mind. He smiled, indulgently, and said it was quite
  the proper thing to do, he was sure; and turned to luxuriate in the twitter
  of the new girl with the blue beret.</p>

  <p>Dinny had slipped out, presently. The Village was beginning to bore
  him.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Tommy impatiently shattered one of Joe Lombroso's crusty
  rolls with his fingers, a bit heated by Dinny's spoofing.</p>

  <p>"Ordinarily," replied Tommy, "I don't permit myself to become disturbed
  over anyone else's damned foolishness besides my own; but, now you've invited
  it, I'd like to tell you something that will be good for your soul&mdash;if
  you still have one."</p>

  <p>"Attaboy, Tommy!" applauded Dinny, merrily. "Skin 'em alive!"</p>

  <p>Tommy drew a heavy frown that Dinny had never seen him wear before.</p>

  <p>"This isn't going to be funny," he muttered. "After lunch, we're going
  over to your squalid hole in Daubville, where you're to listen to something
  I've got for you.... And here's hoping you won't get sore."</p>

  <p>Dinny threw back his head and laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'd really like to see you on the war-path, Tommy."</p>

  <p>The subject was not resumed until, having climbed the dirty stairs, and
  tossing their hats on the littered table, Dinny, amused and expectant,
  lighted his pipe, and signed Tommy to "turn it on."</p>

  <p>"As I understand it," began Tommy, didactically, "you are one of the most
  venomous&mdash;certainly the noisiest&mdash;of all the animals now in revolt
  against everything your betters have built up over a period of five thousand
  years, or so.</p>

  <p>"You've distinguished yourself as a kicker, knocker, scorner, spoofer, and
  snarler. Your sour comments on faith, piety, and patriotism are worth a
  dollar a line.... And, incidentally, I bet you anything you care to put up
  that the time will come&mdash;not long from now&mdash;when you've repeated,
  over and over, all the smart and surly words you know&mdash;your stuff won't
  be worth ten cents a garbage-pailful.... Some of it's beginning to run a bit
  thin already, Dinny, if you don't mind my speaking of it. I just noticed in
  the last issue of <i>The Emancipates</i> that you used the word 'moron' nine
  times. Better get yourself a new thesaurus.... You're writing too much,
  anyhow, my son. Your rhetorical disbursements are so far ahead of your
  intellectual income that you'll be bankrupt, presently. However&mdash;that's
  your affair.</p>

  <p>"You've been the great champion of sincerity. You've thumbed your nose at
  the hypocritical Bible-whackers, and the gavel-swingers, and the
  sword-toters. Everybody's an ass but you&mdash;and the Villagers;
  you&mdash;and your little hand-picked minority of freedom-fanatics....
  Parsons and professors, doctors and lawyers, senators and judges,
  philanthropists and missionaries&mdash;you've had 'em on the grill in a dozen
  contemptible magazines. You've roasted 'em whole, brought 'em back in a stew,
  served 'em cold in a salad with sulphuric acid dressing.</p>

  <p>"And yet&mdash;you'll live down here in this poisonous rat-hole, chumming
  up with a bunch of third-rate, would-be artists, yodelling about liberty to
  express themselves!</p>

  <p>"You rant about hypocrisy! Hypocrisy!... My God!... Can you imagine
  anything more utterly rotten with pretence than the rubbish that's written
  and daubed and sculped by these&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Have a light, Tommy," interrupted Dinny, offering a match, "and don't
  yell so loud.... It's Sunday."</p>

  <p>"You wipe that smile off your face, and sit down! I'm not through yet. I
  mean to tell you some more, and if you don't like it you can go straight
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, Tommy, what you have in mind.... Proceed.... I'm liking it."</p>

  <p>"The new art! Bah! I've been supporting art since I was a youngster;
  missed college to become an art-patron; had the house littered with artists
  for years.... Ninety per cent of 'em too incompetent to hold a job, too lofty
  to earn a living, and too lazy to wash their ears.</p>

  <p>"The new literature&mdash;realism! Tripe! A lot of dirty stories
  dignifiedly told by dirty-minded little shrimps, and solemnly discussed by
  pretenders who make-believe they are enduring the dirt so they can capture
  the beauty of the 'style,' when it's plain they're only enduring the 'style'
  for the sake of the dirt.... Kidding themselves!</p>

  <p>"Modernism&mdash;modernistic painting!... Cubist stuff!... Nobody can tool
  me, any more, about that.... This latest whelp of modernism is nothing but an
  idiot begotten of Gin and Geometry.</p>

  <p>"And <i>you</i>&mdash;cramming the magazines full of high-browed sarcasm
  about the dull slaves of superstition!... chanting about freedom!... yowling
  about the unpardonable sin of stupidity! Haven't you any sense of humour, at
  all?... These birds have imposed on you, down here. They've made you believe
  they were artists&mdash;most of 'em clumsy dubs who couldn't draw an honest
  picture of a long-tailed rat.... Try it out, if you don't believe me. Ask one
  of these paupers to draw you a picture. Offer this Felice person a hundred
  dollars to draw&mdash;not paint&mdash;but <i>draw</i> a picture of those two
  hats on your table, and see what you'll get.... Hypocrisy&mdash;hell!"</p>

  <p>"Tommy&mdash;I've an idea!... Just came to me.... I'm going to write a
  novel... about the Village.... It's marvellous! Wonder I never thought of it
  before."</p>

  <p>Tommy scowled, relighted his pipe, puffed moodily.</p>

  <p>"What you'd far better do is to let up on mean and surly criticism for a
  while. There ought to be some kind of a mental laxative on sale for chaps
  like you. Why don't you treat the world as if you weren't too superior to
  live in it? Pity there isn't some neighbouring planet for you scoffers to go
  to, once in a while, for a vacation."</p>

  <p>Dinny suddenly recalled himself from the absorbing reverie into which he
  had drifted. Tommy had been chiding him pitilessly, and he had missed much of
  the latter part of it. He reproached himself for his wool-gathering at such a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"You're quite outspoken, Tommy.... But&mdash;Boy&mdash;you've given me a
  whopping inspiration... for the novel, you know. I mean to do it, without
  delay.... It will be a wow!"</p>

  <p>There was no further withstanding the contagion of Dinny's enthusiasm; no
  use bristling against Dinny's conciliatory smile. Tommy capitulated with a
  sigh. The chap was incorrigible, utterly inaccessible to reproof.</p>

  <p>"Let's go do something," he said, restlessly, reaching for his hat.</p>

  <p>"Young Vladimir Polovsky's talking at three in the Village theatre,"
  suggested Dinny. "Shall we hear him?"</p>

  <p>"Rot!" exploded Tommy. "Hell of a lot of amusement that would be! More
  dribble about Communism; eh?"</p>

  <p>"It might improve your mind," exhorted Dinny, paternally. "I'll bet you
  never heard a real Communist talk?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe I haven't. Just got done firing one&mdash;a female
  one&mdash;from the store.... Talk? That girl could talk down a Senate
  filibuster!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Dinny wagged his head, knowingly, "that's the answer of capital...
  big business... to any independent opinion offered by the slaves!... Poor
  girl airs her theories&mdash;and gets fired!"</p>

  <p>Tommy chuckled, reminiscently.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;this happened to be the answer of big business to a young
  slattern who refused to act on the broad hint that she'd be improved by a
  shampoo. Nobody at Lacey's cared a damn about Sophie's bad opinion of the
  capitalistic system. It was her revolt against soap."</p>

  <p>Dinny remained loftily sceptical, but willing to grin.</p>

  <p>"Lacey's may have pretended that was the reason, but Sophie would probably
  have been given the sack, just the same. Sophie"&mdash;Dinny feigned a
  sympathetic tear&mdash;"Sophie wanted to be a little candle of
  liberty&mdash;and you snuffed her out!"</p>

  <p>Tommy shook his head, laughing.</p>

  <p>"We sniffed her out."</p>

  <p>"You've a mean tongue, Tommy.... Suppose we go up to The Capitol and see
  Hollywood canonize some racketeer who's just come home with his pockets full
  of money to lift the mortgage off his widowed mother's cottage.... That's
  about your speed."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Dinny began to work on his novel, that night. It was his
  first long story, and he meant to spread it on a huge canvas that would
  provide plenty of room for the minutiæ of detail.</p>

  <p>He knew he could draw Victor&mdash;to the life&mdash;and meant to make him
  lead the ludicrous procession of enchanted bums across an elaborate stage set
  for Art passionate with Revolt.</p>

  <p>He believed he would let Victor succeed, at least measurably, and return
  from time to time collecting laud, honour, and glory from his satellites. As
  an affected, arrogant ass, Victor would be hard to beat.</p>

  <p>There would be room in the story for a bit of honest pathos, too, he
  thought. These people's ambitions would be vapid enough, and their
  pretensions no end silly; but there was nothing fictitious about their hunger
  and heart-break. Dinny paused in his swift typing of the rough memorandum for
  the first chapter, and wondered if he would be able to do the <i>lento</i>
  movement, when he came to it. Hadn't he debarred himself from any such
  excursions into the "human interest" zone of sincere yearning mixed with
  tears? He had so consistently mocked at everything savouring of the
  sentimental that he doubted his ability to write about the deep emotions
  without inviting a hilarious "haw-haw" from his cynical constituency.</p>

  <p>He settled back in his chair, long hands dangling inert over its arms, and
  gave himself to sober reflection on this dilemma.</p>

  <p>His field had always seemed so pleasantly inexhaustible. Why&mdash;a man
  could keep on spoofing current movements forever! There was positively no
  limit to the materials at one's elbow. So long as there was an absurd human
  race, competing in silliness, there would be daily something new to grin at.
  The satirist's mine had barely been scratched.</p>

  <p>Tonight, Dinny's ironically amusing profession seemed suddenly to have
  walled him in. His field of exploration was quite restricted, after all.
  Tommy Forsythe had given him an anxious moment, that afternoon, hinting that
  certain pet phrases of ridicule and contempt, which had served him well, were
  in danger of becoming tarnished ornaments.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he had better stop using the words "moron" and "imbecile." It was
  a fact that he had called them in to explode disparaging comment rather more
  frequently than he should.</p>

  <p>For a long time he sat meditatively tugging at his left ear-lobe, absently
  fingering the key-board with the other hand.... Nonsense! He couldn't do a
  novel! He had had so much highly lucrative sport in ridiculing every phase of
  tender sentiment&mdash;the sickly slobber of penitence, the mawkish drool of
  the meddling doers-of-good, the exultant imbecility of idealism, the owlish
  asininity of philanthropic fuss-budgets and sniffling uplifters who loped
  about crying aloud over the plight of carefree people who desired only to be
  left alone&mdash;that he seriously doubted whether he dared risk a forthright
  invasion of "heart issues."</p>

  <p>Viewed from a slightly different stance&mdash;Dinny, adroit in metaphor,
  was fond of considering his problems in the algebra of his craft&mdash;the
  section of the woods where he claimed the right to swing his axe was limited
  to a very small tract of the forest. It was his job to cut down, chop up,
  stew, and distil astringents, bitters, and lethals from henbane, hemlock, and
  wormwood&mdash;a sophisticated employment. He would only seem ridiculous
  tapping maple trees, or sawing down hollow sycamores for their wild
  honey.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that staid old Tommy would pip off like that?...
  Talked a little like Joan.... Tommy and Joan would have a good time together,
  if ever they met.... Dear Joan!</p>

  <p>Slowly disrobing and easing himself into dressing-gown and slippers, Dinny
  recapitulated the strategic might-have-beens of his arrested romance with
  Joan; relived that passionate half-hour when he had sat, fists clenched, in
  his dormitory room at Magnolia, debating whether to punish the insufferable
  Kling.</p>

  <p>Suppose he had cooled off, and decided to let Kling go unrebuked. ...
  Suppose the piece in <i>The Iconoclast</i> had not appeared at that unlucky
  moment.... Suppose Doctor Braithwaite had been secure enough in his position
  for Joan to risk a response to his honest overtures of reconciliation.... He
  might have had Joan!</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;what? Joan would have insisted on his living in a Fool's
  Paradise, no doubt. She would have coaxed and nagged him into a pretence of
  sharing her ingenuous optimism. He would have spent his life driving spiles
  into maples, and boiling the sap down to syrup and selling it to the
  fudge-makers. Ye gods&mdash;what a career!... Thirty-five or forty dollars a
  week, riding up and down elevators, interviewing candidates, magnates, and
  redeemers who would impressively keep him waiting in their outer offices
  while they sat hungrily watching the clock, lusting to let him in for a
  padful of their oracles.... No&mdash;it wouldn't have done. There would have
  been no "Unfrosted Persimmons." Joan would have seen to that. The
  "Persimmons" would have been brought to market ripe&mdash;sticky&mdash;sicky
  sweet&mdash;rottenly soft.</p>

  <p>And yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>Dinny sighed, turned on his bed-lamp, rolled in, and tried to read the
  current Lawrence; pretty clever dirt, that.... Rather amusing&mdash;Tommy's
  appraisal of erotica. Tommy was more than half right, of course. Previous to
  the recent emancipation from superficial prudery, the male youths had climbed
  up into the haymow to exchange convictions on the ever-exciting subject, and
  the girls, in three-somes, their arms twined around each other, had taken a
  nice long walk, whispering with red cheeks.... Something unhealthily furtive
  about that, of course.</p>

  <p>Now the talk was all out in the open.... Lecturers packed hotel
  convention-halls with rosy-faced, eager, wide-eyed customers who owed it to
  themselves to post up on psychology as it related to the old, old problem....
  No longer was it necessary for the inquisitive youngster to hide his nasty
  little paper-backed shocker in a corner of the oats-bin.... The subject had
  been milled up into "literature," now.... There need be no further hypocrisy
  or furtiveness about this matter. Dinny audibly expelled a contemptuous
  "Pish!"... Old Tommy was dead right!</p>

  <p>All these college boys and girls swarming into classes on "Abnormal
  Psychology"... all these altruistic women elbowing into the Court of Domestic
  Relations... all these questors of culture, hunting for rhetorical gems in
  the new, breathtakingly frank, censor-baiting literature of
  libidinousness!... Same old story... same old furtiveness. But&mdash;while
  the earlier crop of curious youngsters had deceived their parents, the new
  outfit were deceiving themselves!</p>

  <p>Dinny turned a few pages, and pushed the book off the bed on to the floor;
  snapped the light, closed his eyes, scowled.</p>

  <p>And yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>Whatever Joan might have been able to do to him and his literary
  aspirations, it might have been worth the sacrifice.... Gad&mdash;what a
  thoroughbred!</p>

  <p>Vivid pictures of her came, lingered, and made way for others even more
  luminous.... Joan&mdash;radiant, supple, agile, tantalizing, generously
  blending her splendid body with his, that first afternoon on the ice...
  Joan&mdash;demurely eyeing him, and denying it with an indignant toss of the
  head when he caught her, in silly little Ernie's fussy museum...
  Joan&mdash;warm across his shoulders, her cheek against his, scolding into
  his ear and hating him with all her might while she drove him nearly mad with
  her rampant vitality... Joan&mdash;gently chiding, tenderly, wistful, in his
  arms!... Joan's kiss. He must find Joan. Suddenly, the slumbering,
  half-hopeless, half-abandoned yearning for her almost suffocated him.
  Whatever it might cost&mdash;even to the ruinous price of degrading himself
  to the maple-sugar business&mdash;he must see Joan. They were made for each
  other. How often he had said "Rot!" in comment on some such observation made
  in reference to a congenial pair. But, it wasn't rot. Joan was his&mdash;and
  he meant to have her.</p>

  <p>Item by item, Dinny recovered her in every remembered posture, expression,
  mood, each delicious recollection confirming his decision to track her down
  and have it out with her.</p>

  <p>He reinvoiced all the tentative projects that had occurred to him,
  earlier, for quests of the vanished Joan. This time he would see it through.
  He would pocket his prudence, and ask questions of people who might know.</p>

  <p>A light suddenly broke. Dinny grinned, nodded, rose, went across to his
  mother's desk, and began to scribble. For a half-hour he wrote and tore and
  flung away. At length he was determined to be satisfied with his production,
  addressed an envelope to <i>The Times,</i> Want Ads, enclosed his copy and a
  five-dollar note.</p>

  <p>Dressing hurriedly, he went downstairs, telling himself he was silly to be
  so precipitate, seeing there was nothing to be gained by posting his letter
  at two-thirty a.m., but eager to relieve his impatience, somehow.</p>

  <p>Wide-awake, mentally turbulent, he walked all the way to The Battery,
  seeing nothing en route but a stuffy little coffee-shop where he stopped and
  gulped a cup of scalding brown stuff that had been stained by the original
  grounds described in the lease.</p>

  <p>Now that he had made the adventure, Dinny wondered if he could wait until
  Tuesday. His ad would appear then. Joan would probably read it before the day
  was out.... And then what?</p>

  <p>Time dragged very slowly, all Monday. It was impossible to concentrate.
  Dinny was thankful he was a few instalments ahead of the game in the
  manufacture of his "Green Cheese."</p>

  <p>At seven, Tuesday morning, he rushed over to The Brevoort, bought a
  <i>Times,</i> went in to breakfast, rummaged deep in the advertising pages,
  found the column of "Female Help Wanted," and searched for his request.... It
  looked a bit crazy.</p><br>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HIS decision, a fortnight later, to see Angela in action was
  one of the most unaccountable caprices to which Dinny Brumm had ever
  yielded.</p>

  <p>The sudden resolve to go to Dorchester, New York, and watch Angela heal
  the sick and cast out devils, was arrived at one Wednesday evening shortly
  after a casual little dinner with four neighbours at the Purple Pig.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the first insistent bleat of desire to do this eccentric thing had
  whimpered from the depths of Dinny's mind during the dinner conversation when
  Felice Manners had moodily mooned over her early adventures with religion
  back in Gimmel, Illinois.</p>

  <p>Felice, to judge from the blue circles under her heavy eyes, and the
  smeary elisions of her thick talk, had been steadily tippling all day. She
  was now making a muddy landing from her ascension into the upper ether of
  Bacchanalia.</p>

  <p>On such occasions, Felice shamelessly turned her soul inside-out for the
  edification of whosoever happened to be within range of her appalling
  self-disclosures.</p>

  <p>This time, a brief&mdash;and, to Dinny, unwelcome&mdash;conversation about
  Angela, now well on the way to becoming a national figure, had set Felice
  going about the ponderous piety of Grandfather Johnson's home in frowsy
  little Gimmel where, at nine, she had been dutifully taken in, after the
  death of her mother, and had remained until, at sixteen, she had fled
  unfounded and unpursued.</p>

  <p>And while Felice rumbled heavily on, recovering fugitive scraps of a
  stormy girlhood that had creased the brow and whitened the whiskers of
  Grandfather Johnson&mdash;"and Grandmothersh, too," she had added, with an
  irresistible touch of realism&mdash;Dinny, possessed of memories not
  dissimilar, twirled his own reel back to weedy little Zanesdale.</p>

  <p>Now and again, and at briefer intervals, Dinny had been aware of momentary
  surges&mdash;something very like nostalgia. Increasingly given to
  self-analysis, as life became more and more stale and unpromising, he found
  this the most singular of his mental phenomena.</p>

  <p>It was quite natural, reflected Dinny, that a fortunate man who, in youth,
  had lived in a congenial home from which he had emerged, at length,
  reluctantly, would so cherish his memories that there would ever be a strong
  tug in that direction. It was easy to understand how, across a widening chasm
  of miles and years, such a man might so long for home and a recovery of its
  endearments that the yearning would obsess him.</p>

  <p>But&mdash;as in his own case&mdash;for a man who, in youth, had fretted in
  his home, counting the days which must elapse until he could escape its
  intolerable irksomeness, eventually rushing out of it without one backward
  glance, asking nothing but to be spared the necessity of a return, these
  occasional tidal-waves of homesickness were inexplicable.</p>

  <p>Dinny found himself wondering if it might not be true that the homing
  instinct is universal, omnipresent, inevitable; not very much conditioned by
  any individual's immediate reactions to his native environment while in it.
  Why, he even had fleeting seizures of desire to see frumpy old Aunt
  Martha!</p>

  <p>Frequently he told himself that the next time he had an errand in Chicago,
  he would start a day early and drop off in Zanesdale; he would sit on the
  fence at the corner of Harsh's melon-patch, and watch the Erie "fast-lines"
  whiz by.</p>

  <p>These attacks did not last long, however, and when he had regained his
  sober senses, Dinny would accuse himself of a growing tendency toward
  weak-mindedness. It would be entirely consistent with his unhappy career, he
  thought, if at about forty, he would have to be carted off to a
  funny-house.</p>

  <p>He had rarely thought of Angela for several years. Lately she was much on
  his mind. Angela was becoming famous&mdash;or notorious&mdash;the choice of
  an adjective depending on the mood of the reader who found her startling
  exploits, at the behest of Heaven, demanding larger space in the
  newspapers.</p>

  <p>The first important tidings of her spectacular ministry had broken from
  Spottswood, Pennsylvania, where for six hectic weeks she had had that smoky
  mill-town by the ears.</p>

  <p>The revival had begun in the custody of the biggest church in Spottswood;
  had rapidly outgrown its quarters and migrated to the city auditorium; and,
  because it was September, had swarmed to the County Fair Grounds where the
  Holy Ghost had obliged Angela with a recurrence of Pentecost.</p>

  <p>Hundreds&mdash;screamed the big black headlines&mdash;had rushed about,
  babbling "tongues" which sounded strangely even in the ears of a polyglot
  foundry-town composed of a little of everything all the way from Mesopotamia
  and the parts of Libya about Cyrene to the uttermost jungles of Siam and the
  suburbs of Babel.</p>

  <p>Still other hundreds, unblest with tongues, had ecstatically rolled in the
  sacred sawdust, popping out of one trance into another. In the hilarious
  "after meetings," happy converts milled up and down the aisles,
  affectionately embracing their fellow-lunatics without regard to age, sex, or
  colour.</p>

  <p>After a short interval of recuperation, Angela was reported at Wrayville,
  Tennessee, from whence the news proceeded of a miraculous restoration of
  sight to an elderly woman, nine years blind. A local doctor had verified the
  miracle, though there had been some difficulty verifying the doctor, who, the
  Wrayville Medical Association insisted, was not an oculist, but a specialist
  in botts and glanders.</p>

  <p>Presently Angela was again on the hook in twenty score of composing-rooms,
  this time at Stillman, Iowa, whither excursion trains from neighbouring towns
  hurried with yearning cargoes of sick and afflicted.</p>

  <p>"Thish Ashula Brumm"&mdash;Felice had thickly inquired, that Wednesday
  evening, at the Purple Pig&mdash;"sisher o' yoursh, Dinny?"</p>

  <p>The Carmichaels, and the Strothers boy who played Sylvia's accompaniments,
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"Do I strike you as having come from a family of deities?" countered
  Dinny, rather annoyed that the question had come up.</p>

  <p>Felice nodded, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Such ash you, Dinny, alwaysh come f'm holy hillsh."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Dinny's a fallen angel," suggested Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I mean 't," persisted Felice, with an expansive gesture. "If all
  th' atheish and agnoshish in thish rotten villish were honesh, nine out o'
  ten would shay... born pioush home."</p>

  <p>"Let's begin with you, then," proposed Strothers, indulgently. "You're an
  atheist, aren't you, Felice?"</p>

  <p>"Ever' mornin'," went on Felice, woodenly, "Grandfa'r took twenty-poun'
  Bible on hish lap, an' read long chapter f'm Deuteromony er
  Ebeneesher&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No such book as Ebenezer," corrected Dinny.</p>

  <p>Felice grinned, cannily, over having scored a point.</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh!&mdash;jushesh I sushpected, Dinny Brumm.... You were brought up
  on 't. You're f'm holy hillsh&mdash;jush like me."</p>

  <p>"Go on, Felice," urged Carmichael. "What did Grandfather do next?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;after he had read longesh chapter he could find, 'bout th'
  Amalekitesh an' th' Stalactitesh, all eight o' ush schwoop' faish-down into
  our chair cushionsh, an' tied an' untied an' retied th' yarn knotsh while our
  Heav'ly Fa'er wush thanked that He had shpared ush to shee th' light o'
  'nother day... hell of a compliment f'r Heav'ly Fa'er... Heav'ly Fa'er hadn't
  murdered ush all in our bedsh."</p>

  <p>Aware, from previous experience, that Felice, at such moments, was very
  sensitive, Dinny had done his honest best to keep a straight face during this
  recital; but, having clamped down a bit too hard on his feelings, he now
  regretfully blew up with a loud report which sent Felice into a pitiable
  drizzle of maudlin tears.</p>

  <p>Dinny had never been party to an event at once so tragic and so
  devastatingly ridiculous. Felice, barely intelligible, poured out a story
  that might have made the angels weep while they laughed. As a child, the
  lonesome little thing had gone out by herself into a far corner of the garden
  and looked bravely up into the blue, telling God she didn't believe a word of
  it, and hoping He'd please excuse poor old Grandfather Johnson, who didn't
  know any better, and meant all right.</p>

  <p>"An' God ushe t' talk t' me... Nosshir, I mean 't!... He would jush grin,
  and shay, 'Thash all ri', li'l' Felish. You run an' play!'"</p>

  <p>Sylvia had taken Felice home when it was generally agreed that she had
  talked enough, and was attracting too much attention.</p>

  <p>Leaving the mussy little restaurant, Dinny had gone to his room somewhat
  depressed. Felice had stirred some quite vivid recollections of his own
  boyhood. There had been a time when he, too, had been acutely conscious of
  something&mdash;something winged, inside himself&mdash;looking up
  inquiringly, hopefully. Felice had apologized to God in behalf of Grandfather
  Johnson. Dinny remembered having had much the same feeling as a little boy.
  God had been maligned. God was their Father... and they had gone down on all
  fours, twice a day, grovelling like heathen.</p>

  <p>But, strangely enough, Dinny wanted to see what was this peculiar energy
  that Angela had laid hold on. Angela might be no end a
  mountebank&mdash;probably was nothing less or else than that&mdash;but
  thousands were finding something at her hands. Surely she hadn't inherited
  anything from his smug and stupid Uncle Miles that would stampede city after
  city into orgies of repentance and hysterias of joy.</p>

  <p>At ten-thirty, that night, he was in his berth, listening to the trucks
  pound the rail-ends as his train scampered up the right bank of the Hudson,
  and wondering what had possessed him to spend any time or money on such a
  silly adventure.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Thursday afternoons&mdash;Dinny learned at <i>The Dorchester
  Sun,</i> where he had been cordially welcomed when applying for a press
  ticket to the Angela Brumm Revival&mdash;were set aside for the healing of
  children.... Lucky, he thought... couldn't have struck a better day!</p>

  <p>He lunched with Fred Channing, the editor, after having met a few of the
  boys at the office, where, as was inevitable, he had been chaffed about his
  gifted "relative."</p>

  <p>Channing had slowly closed one eye, impressively, in the midst of the
  banter.</p>

  <p>"You wait!... Some woman!... May be a quack and a faker&mdash;but, you
  take it from me&mdash;Angela's got a lot o' <i>It!"</i></p>

  <p>They went to the stage door of the big public auditorium at two-thirty.
  Literally hundreds of people stood about the entrances, hopeful of crowding
  in to secure standing-room after the ticket-holders had been accommodated. In
  tow of Channing, Dinny followed through a long concrete corridor, swarming
  with the surpliced choir, busy functionaries, reporters, parsons, and up the
  stairs to the large stage, set for three hundred.</p>

  <p>The auditorium was packed to suffocation. A tense feeling seemed to
  pervade the place, as if some astounding event&mdash;some sickish tragedy,
  perhaps&mdash;were imminent. Dinny's eye swept the huge hall; raked the
  galleries into a vertiginous smear of wide-staring, open-mouthed, morbidly
  curious expectants. Then he analysed the crowd&mdash;small sections of
  it&mdash;item by item; nervously thumbing their paper-backed hymn-books with
  mechanical fingers, gnawing their lips, apprehensively, as if they had come
  to a hanging.</p>

  <p>The great choir filed in, confident and conscious of its importance, and
  stood, as in a tableau, until the celebrated Maurice Manwaring, lithe,
  athletic, leonine of head, an extraordinarily handsome brute, strode on,
  raised both modishly white-flannelled arms, and with a commanding gesture
  that seemed to reach far forward and grab the first triumphant note out of
  their obedient open mouths, he summoned them to the great declaration that
  the affair was on, and Heaven was being called in to witness. The piece was
  Gounod's "Unfold, Ye Portals." Dinny had not been so stirred to the
  depths&mdash;ever! He had come as a spectator; rather a cold-blooded
  spectator, too. Now he felt himself vigorously pushed into the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Un&mdash;fo-o-o-o-l-l-ld!... <i>Unn&mdash;fo&mdash;o-o-o-ol-l-ld!...
  UNNN-FO-O-O-O-OL-L-LD!!</i>&mdash;YE POR-TALS EV-ER-LAAAST-ING!"</p>

  <p>The great crowd couldn't resist the pull of it another minute; came up out
  of its seat in response to something gripping that reached out, and took
  hold, and lifted up. Dinny found himself on his feet, his heart pounding, his
  eyes smarting, his throat dry.</p>

  <p>Angela came on, passing him so nearly he could have reached out a hand and
  touched her black velvet gown. She was an insuperably regal figure,
  exquisitely formed, incredibly beautiful, with the carriage of a goddess and
  the rapt eyes of a mystic. Except for the white silk stole which depended
  almost to her knees, she wore no ornament. Walking confidently to the centre
  of the stage, she rested an expressive white hand on the pulpit and gazed
  over the multitude with a sort of inspired compassion. Dinny would have given
  his all for a faithful picture of what was actually going on, at that
  instant, in Angela's mind.... It was utterly impossible, preposterous, that
  this woman could stand there, before this yearning crowd, swept by the
  nerve-tingling influence of such music&mdash;and be calmly plotting a
  hoax!... Angela should have the benefit of every doubt. <i>Angela was not a
  fake!</i></p>

  <p>The anthem rose to a great <i>crescendo.</i> The multitude sat. Angela
  stood. There was a heavy hush. She prayed. It was a quiet voice, but
  commanding. Angela maternally gathered up the three thousand in her soft,
  strong arms, and, having affectionately held them to her ample breast and
  wiped their tears and fears away, tenderly handed them over into the
  infinitely stronger arms of their Father. It was not God's wish that any of
  these little ones should suffer, or face life unable to savour its
  sweetness.... Dinny remembered it was a "Children's Healing Day," and,
  glancing about, became aware of babies in arms, little cripples in arms,
  big-headed, empty-headed, pallid, grotesque <i>monsters</i> in arms. Never
  had he seen such a conglomeration of juvenile misfortune. They seemed
  suddenly to spring into existence. He had not noticed them before.</p>

  <p>God did not want these little ones to suffer.... By faith, they would be
  healed.... God had promised.... It was enough. We could take Him at His
  word.</p>

  <p>Spontaneously, the choir, as if unable to restrain its pent-up emotions,
  quietly hummed the old hymn-tune which Dinny recognized as "My Faith Looks Up
  to Thee."</p>

  <p>Angela, face uplifted, blue eyes wide, enraptured, called upon her Father,
  these little ones' Father, to keep His word with her&mdash;with
  them&mdash;with us.... Then there began to come from the depths of the
  auditorium a surge, a sobbing surge of questing song, as if it was welling up
  out of hearts rather than throats. Dinny's eyes filled. He didn't sing;
  couldn't have sung; but he was conscious of being in and of that longing
  multitude whose honest faith&mdash;or whose desperate hope, at
  least&mdash;was reaching up.</p>

  <p>Dinny never liked to remember, afterwards, the procession that came down
  the aisles, and up the stairs to the stage, bearing its pitiable freight to
  the Lamb of Calvary and His calmly confident representative.... Pale,
  twisted, little children... blind babies... hare-lipped... club-footed...
  hunch-backed.</p>

  <p>Angela laid her potent hands upon each of them, raised her eyes, murmured
  a prayer, and a motherly woman in white gently propelled them on, across the
  stage, to another stairway leading back into the auditorium.</p>

  <p>At the foot of this stairway, a huddle of young women, also in white, were
  receiving the bewildered mothers with encouraging smiles, distributing gifts
  to the children&mdash;gay trinkets, oranges, little dolls for the girls,
  mechanical toys for the boys.</p>

  <p>Dinny began to understand the reason for this quite dismaying anti-climax
  to Angela's wholesale conferment of God's grace. It was a shock-absorber to
  provide distraction of the hapless victims' minds from their disappointment
  in case the power of God was not immediately manifest. There was no question
  about Angela's excellent intent. Her faith looked up to the Lamb of Calvary.
  She sincerely hoped&mdash;more than hoped; expected&mdash;that the Lamb of
  Calvary would take pity on these wretched. But if, for some baffling reason
  unknown to Angela, the Lamb of Calvary let her down, there would still be
  dolls and oranges and toy automobiles, and a red, red rose for mother.</p>

  <p>The long procession kept coming on. Dinny was seated where he could
  observe the faces of the mothers at the moment Angela was in the act of
  bearing their anxieties to the Throne. He winced as if witness to surgery
  performed without benefit of anæsthesia. The faces of the mothers seemed
  strangely alike, the tense, stiff, open lips showing tips of teeth in
  half-open mouths, as if expectant of sharp and sudden pain; as if Angela were
  a surgeon, and they had come to have her lance some deep, dangerous
  infection; waiting, now, for the plunge of the knife. The faces were all set
  in masks&mdash;masks through whose stiff vents, round, wide eyes, and open,
  straining mouths&mdash;the mothers were prepared to shout for joy or scream
  with despair.</p>

  <p>Not often did the mothers immediately inspect their children, after the
  supplication. They dared not tarry to do that. The thing was to hurry on, as
  bidden. Dinny suspected the management did not encourage any loitering on the
  stage, any looking to see.</p>

  <p>One mother's trembling hand ran swiftly down the thin leg of her
  six-year-old boy, and felt for the crooked little foot. The crooked little
  foot was still there, just as she knew it would be, her tightly pursing lips
  seemed to say. Perhaps her faith had not been very robust.</p>

  <p>One young mother paused, momentarily blocking the traffic, while she
  lifted her blind baby shoulder high and gazed hungrily into the child's
  opaque eyes. All the sickening grief of a sickeningly grieving world spread
  across her face as she slowly turned her head and made a pitiful little
  sucking noise with her lips as if she had been stabbed. A compassionate hand
  was laid under her elbow, and she resumed her tramp to the stairs, consulting
  each step for safe footing as she descended from Calvary's Fountain to have
  pressed into her trembling fingers an amiable, smiling, wide-eyed, blue-eyed,
  china doll&mdash;the gift of the white-organdied angels, and the
  black-velveted Angela, and the blood-red Hands, nailed to a Tree. They also
  handed her a red rose-bud. Dinny hoped the management had had the forethought
  to snip off the thorns.</p>

  <p>A bit of unusual stir about Angela detached his gaze from the retreating
  figure of the blind baby's mother. A nine-year-old boy, with steel braces on
  his emaciated legs, was being gingerly put down from his father's arms, at
  Angela's command. She prayed&mdash;audibly, this time&mdash;in a tone of
  assurance, of gratitude, as if the boon she asked was already a <i>fait
  accompli.</i></p>

  <p>The silence was absolute, as Angela unbuckled the boy's braces. The
  clatter they made, as she cast them aside on the floor, had the effect of
  heavy chains dropped by a prisoner freed. She took the child by the hand, and
  bade him walk.</p>

  <p><i>He walked!</i> There was a sudden, concerted intake of breath in three
  thousand open mouths. The father of the boy, an embarrassed farmer, smiled
  self-consciously, smoothed his tawny moustache, and followed along. The
  mother stooped and picked up the braces. Angela darted a swift glance, noting
  the act. She betrayed a faint, fleeting trace of annoyance, but instantly
  regained her grateful smile, put the skinny little hand of the lad into the
  big red hand of his unstirred father, and quickly returned to her post beside
  the pulpit.</p>

  <p>Dinny's quick intuition suggested that the little drama had gone bad. The
  boy's father was a dolt, and his mother was a woman of little faith.
  Doubtless both of them knew the boy could take a few faltering steps without
  his braces if someone held his hand. To the vast crowd, however, the miracle
  was genuine enough. Anyway&mdash;the crowd had come to see miracles, and was
  definitely on Angela's and the Lord's side.</p>

  <p>The meeting was drawing to an abrupt close now. The choir had risen and
  was leading the congregation in praising God From Whom All Blessings Flow,
  with an unction that certified to the complete success of the demonstration
  of grace outpoured.</p>

  <p>Angela, with face a bit drawn, evidencing that the neural strain of the
  hour had cost something, raised a graceful, hand, pronounced a brief
  benediction, and left the pulpit. As she passed Dinny, she glanced straight
  into his staring eyes, stopped, searched his face, and spoke:</p>

  <p>"Ferdinand!"</p>

  <p>Dinny extended his hand soberly, almost deferentially. Angela did not take
  it.</p>

  <p>"Come to the hotel&mdash;the Savoy&mdash;at five."</p>

  <p>She did not pause for a reply to her command. When Dinny turned, somewhat
  disconcertedly, to observe what Channing might have made of this revealing
  episode, his friend had taken prompt advantage of the priestess's exit, and
  was rapidly escaping. Channing glanced back over his shoulder, drew a quick,
  non-committal smile, and pointed significantly in the direction of the stage
  door, as if indicating they would meet there.</p>

  <p>He had vanished, however, when Dinny, thick in the exodus, reached the
  pavement.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They did not call her "Miss Brumm," but "Angela Brumm," as
  if it were a four-syllable word accentuated on the ultimate.</p>

  <p>When the girl at the Information Desk turned to the switchboard operator,
  relaying Dinny's request to see "Miss Brumm," she said.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ferdinand Brumm has an appointment with Angela Brumm."</p>

  <p>She did not say, "Mr. <i>Ferdinand</i> Brumm has an appointment with
  <i>Angela</i> Brumm." There was only one authentic Brumm, and that Brumm was
  Angela <i>Brumm.</i></p>

  <p>The bell-hop, whom he trailed to the elevator and over the padded carpet
  of the seventh floor, did not ring, but opened the door to the first room of
  what proved to be an extensive suite. This first was a very business-like
  reception office where Dinny stated his errand to a white-gowned
  secretary.</p>

  <p>"Angela Brumm is expecting you, sir. Come with me, please."</p>

  <p>They passed through another room, equipped for secretarial purposes and
  occupied by three typists zealously tapping noiseless machines. The large
  sitting-room adjacent was brightly appointed, clearly the boudoir of a woman
  who knew how to surround herself with the indispensables of the well-to-do;
  everything in excellent taste, Dinny thought, as his conductress signed him
  to a rust-silk davenport, and retired.</p>

  <p>Angela sauntered in presently, from the opposite door, her shimmering gold
  hair plaited down her back, dressed in a flowing négligée of unrelieved black
  silk, black silk stockings, black silk slippers. The high heels added a touch
  to her regal carriage. Dinny stood, wondering what manner of take-off this
  conversation might have, after a lapse of more than eight years. Would Angela
  begin with something conventional&mdash;"unexpected pleasure"&mdash;and that
  sort of thing?</p>

  <p>"People call you 'Dinny,' now; don't they?" she asked, negligently, as she
  approached. "I would have told you to come at once, dear," continued Angela,
  putting both hands on his broad shoulders and lifting her face for the kiss
  which speeded his heart a little&mdash;"but I'm frightfully uncomfortable
  until I've had a bath and a mauling by my masseuse."</p>

  <p>Dinny understood and expressed his amazement that she could go through so
  much nerve-wrecking business, daily, without breaking.</p>

  <p>"But you're the picture of vitality," he added, honest admiration in his
  eyes. They sat, at her inviting gesture, on the luxurious davenport.</p>

  <p>"Well?"&mdash;Angela glanced up brightly, smiling inquisitively&mdash;"now
  you've seen it, what do you think?... Is the Man in the Moon disgusted, or
  amused, or&mdash;amazed?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't quite made up his mind yet, Angela," returned Dinny
  thoughtfully. "He's always reserved, you know; probably a bit
  over-cautious.... Maybe due to his age."</p>

  <p>Angela puckered her full, red lips into a playful tease.</p>

  <p>"I presume Luna thought it a good show," she ventured, blue eyes widening
  roguishly.</p>

  <p>"Luna leaps at conclusions, of course," parried Dinny, Angela's
  woman-of-the-world air and tone mystifying him: he hoped he was keeping his
  surprise out of his voice. "However"&mdash;weighing his words&mdash;"instinct
  maybe more trustworthy, in such matters, than shear intellect.... If you
  don't mind leaving the Moon out of it, for a moment, I'll admit I was never
  so uplifted, and&mdash;expectant, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and shot down, tumbling, wings broken, scattering a trail of
  bloody feathers&mdash;" prompted Angela, when he paused, groping for the
  right word.... "Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Dinny soberly studied her face, somewhat perplexed by her candour.</p>

  <p>"Not quite," he said, indecisively. "Not shot down, exactly, a little more
  as if one had risen rapidly, dizzily, in a balloon&mdash;and it had sprung a
  leak.... One had to come down, then."</p>

  <p>"And it was a rough landing," sympathized Angela. "I knew by your
  face."</p>

  <p>"Quite!" admitted Dinny&mdash;"but one still has the balloon. Whether it
  is beyond repair remains to be seen. I'm afraid I haven't had the courage to
  look.... Anyway&mdash;there's been no time. This sort of thing deserves
  some&mdash;some thinking over."</p>

  <p>She nodded, comprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"You may find you've lost nothing by your cruise, Dinny.... Judging from
  the things you've been writing&mdash;and I follow them closely, dear,
  laughing and crying, laughing at them and crying for you&mdash;it seems you
  haven't even known you <i>had</i> a balloon.... Perhaps it's been worth a
  trip to Dorchester, just to find that out."</p>

  <p>Which of his sardonic, satirical cronies, thought Dinny, would have had
  the effrontery to predict that, some day, he might sit in a confessional,
  unreservedly pouring his sincere wistfulness into the dainty pink ear of an
  itinerant woman evangelist and miracle-worker! His mood amazed him.</p>

  <p>"Honestly, now, Dinny!" Angela had murmured, intertwining her fingers with
  his. "Let yourself go&mdash;a bit.... It'll be good for you."</p>

  <p>"It has come&mdash;only twice"&mdash;said Dinny, dreamily&mdash;"in about
  fifteen years&mdash;this strange, brief, uncanny tug; this afternoon, and
  another time, in a Catholic Church, when I was a freshman.... But&mdash;when
  I was a small boy, Angela, I frequently experienced big, suffocating waves
  of&mdash;of exultation. They never came in winter, as I recall, and never
  except when I was alone."</p>

  <p>Dinny reclined, staring at the ceiling, and reflected.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;go on," said Angela, quietly, patting his hand.</p>

  <p>"Only on summer afternoons, flat on my back, looking up into the blue and
  white, a gentle breeze stirring, bees humming, birds singing, squirrels
  scampering about&mdash;I used to get it, then&mdash;just a big wave of it,
  and it would be gone.... I didn't know what it was, and I can't describe it
  now, but&mdash;I suppose brave old Walt came about as nearly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Walt?" queried Angela.</p>

  <p>"Whitman."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I never knew him that well," confessed Angela. "Somebody gave me
  a book of his poems. I've always meant to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dinny glanced in the direction of a well-filled book-case.</p>

  <p>Angela, following his eyes, rose, and crossed the room.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you can find the place, Dinny, and read it to me. I think I'd like
  to hear it," she said, returning with the book.</p>

  <p>"It's pretty long," warned Dinny, leafing rapidly. "I'll try to give you
  just an idea of it.... Of course"&mdash;he laid the open book face downward
  on his knee&mdash;"I'm not meaning to say that I had precisely these thoughts
  when I was a little chap, but the thoughts I had have never been put into
  words more adequate to describe my feelings than these."</p>

  <p>Angela impatiently took up the book, and confronted him with it, nodding
  her head.</p>

  <p>"Just a minute, Angela&mdash;and then I'll read some of it for you... . I
  think I hated religion, from the start. As I try to recover my boyish
  opinions, I think I always knew that religion was a selfish, ignorant,
  hole-in-a-corner affair perpetuated by small people.... God had instantly
  fallen out with the world, soon as He'd made it. But He was glumly allowing
  the Whole Thing to go on, despising It, deploring It, enduring It, and
  wondering how long it would be yet until all the people became Baptists; and
  the Baptists, aware of His impatience, shouted back, 'How long, O Lord, how
  long?'... Previously&mdash;ages before the Baptists&mdash;God had wondered
  how He was going to put up with everybody but the Jews, who seemed to have
  caught His fancy.... I knew, by instinct, that all such stuff as that was
  rubbish!... Adam!&mdash;and Adam's 'fall'!&mdash;I think I knew, even as a
  freckle-nosed, barefooted, little boy, that it was nothing but a fairy-tale,
  and not a very pleasant one, at that. It didn't ring true.... And all that
  tiresome story of early Jewish magic left me cold. I hated it!</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;sometimes&mdash;on summer days, a wave-like surge
  of&mdash;gladness, of&mdash;of understanding, would sweep over me. I would
  suddenly <i>belong!</i>&mdash;if you get what I mean. The Whole Thing was all
  of a piece, and I was part of it, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dinny took up the book.</p>

  <p>"Whitman says he had heard a great deal of talk about the beginning and
  the end; and he writes&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"There never was any more inception than there is now,<br>
  Nor any more youth or age than there is now,<br>
  And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br>
  Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.<br>
  <br>
  In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,<br>
  And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.<br>
  <br>
  I know I am august.<br>
  I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood.<br>
  I see that the elementary laws never apologize.<br>
  <br>
  I think I could turn and live with animals, they're so placid and
  self-contain'd.<br>
  I stand and look at them long and long.<br>
  They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br>
  They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,<br>
  They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God.<br>
  <br>
  They show me their relations to me and I accept them,<br>
  They bring me tokens of myself...<br>
  <br>
  I wonder where they get these tokens.<br>
  Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?"</p><br>

  <p>Angela sat, with brooding eyes, venturing no comment, when Dinny
  paused.</p>

  <p>"Just for a moment&mdash;today&mdash;I had one more strong, quick
  <i>tug</i> of that... whatever-it-is! Perhaps you know. Of course you
  know!"</p>

  <p>"Exactly when&mdash;Dinny?" murmured Angela, scarcely above a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'd like to say&mdash;it would be the most gracious thing to
  say&mdash;that I got it through something you said or did; but that wouldn't
  be quite true.... It came while your choir was singing that opening
  anthem&mdash;the Gounod thing&mdash;'Unfold!'... Angela&mdash;did you ever
  catch a big, fighting trout?&mdash;I mean a huge, muscled, determined,
  <i>savage</i> trout?... No?... Well&mdash;you've been casting for three
  hours; quite confidently, at first, having been told there's trout in the
  pool; rather impatiently and exasperatedly, after an hour; and then dully,
  unhopefully, mechanically, half-inclined to quit, scorning yourself for going
  to the bother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm following, Dinny," prodded Angela. "Do catch one!"</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;suddenly&mdash;there's a <i>strike!...</i> I don't mean
  there's a timid little nibble of some sluggish, grubby four-inch
  blue-gill.... I mean a swift reaching and grabbing and a <i>tug</i> that
  bends the rod to a horseshoe, and the reel goes 'Zzzing'!"</p>

  <p>"Great!" shouted Angela, eyes shining.</p>

  <p>Dinny stilled her enthusiasm with an outspread palm.</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;the line falls limp&mdash;and whatever-it-was had given
  you that instant's exultant thrill&mdash;is gone!... But"&mdash;pursued
  Dinny, meditatively&mdash;"just to know you're still capable of a fleeting
  exultation like that, even if it's only for an instant&mdash;well, as you
  say, it's worth a trip to Dorchester."</p>

  <p>"Can't you stay a few days, Dinny?" pleaded Angela.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'd probably not get it again. In fact, I'm quite sure.... The
  physical healing&mdash;you know.... It was&mdash;do you mind if I speak
  plainly, Angela?... It was the most shockingly cruel affair I ever saw.... My
  dear&mdash;<i>how can you?"</i></p>

  <p>Angela's voice trembled when she replied.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I help them," she said, hoarsely. "I&mdash;I thought I could at
  first. I was honest, Dinny... And then&mdash;they just expected it, and
  insisted, and there'd been so much talk about it... But, Dinny, sometimes I
  do help them... a little... Really!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head, with a faint, incredulous smile.</p>

  <p>"I didn't come here to rebuke you, Angela. You know your own business, and
  you handle it<i>&mdash;superbly!</i> God knows I've no right to offer you any
  counsel&mdash;but&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

  <p>Angela gripped his hand in both of hers.</p>

  <p>"Say it!" she commanded, soberly.</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;I think you're making a cheap and grotesque thing out of
  a mystery that's too big for you&mdash;too big for anyone!... It's a great
  pity."</p>

  <p>Dinny rose, laid his long hands under Angela's elbows, looked her squarely
  in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm quite proud of you&mdash;all but <i>that!'</i></p>

  <p>"Must you go? Have dinner with me. I don't eat&mdash;much&mdash;but I'll
  watch you. Please?"</p>

  <p>When she saw he was quite determined to leave, Angela gave him her hand,
  gave him her lips, smiled, pushed a bell. Dinny left without a further
  word.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the morning, he found among the many letters waiting in
  his box, another package&mdash;they came daily&mdash;from <i>The Times.</i>
  He opened them without interest, tossing them aside, half-read. Here was one
  addressed from Pine Hill, Wisconsin. Dinny's curiosity was stirred.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Sir:<br>
  <br>
  This is in reply to your recent advertisement for a "Research Secretary." I
  formerly worked in New York, and the clipping was sent me by a friend.<br>
  <br>
  As to age and physical dimensions, I could qualify for your position, if it
  is still open.<br>
  <br>
  I know almost nothing about Indian mounds, but am willing to learn from
  you.<br>
  <br>
  Very respectfully,<br>
  JOAN BRAITHWAITE.<br>
  <br>
  P.S.&mdash;I do need a job, Dinny, quite frightfully!<br>
  JOAN.</p><br>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the pursuit of his singular trade, Dinny Brumm's
  requirement of a "research secretary" was about as urgent as his professional
  need of a trap-drummer or a tea-taster.</p>

  <p>At the moment of his frantically impetuous decision to advertise for news
  of Joan, it had not occurred to him that he might soon be put to the
  necessity of inventing an occupation for her.</p>

  <p>As for the expense involved in taking on an employee, the prospect of
  assuming such a responsibility, with Joan as the incumbent, filled Dinny with
  proud delight. He had plenty of money. His residence in cheap Bohemian
  quarters and his association with friends mostly of simple tastes and meagre
  means, while not an intentional frugality, had made but small demands upon
  his mounting income.</p>

  <p>He had preferred that manner of living. Had he possessed a fortune
  yielding a million a year, his sense of humour would have stood in the way of
  its distribution by any of the customary tactics employed by the gilded whose
  alleged exploits in quest of pleasure would, he believed, have bored him to
  an early and welcome grave.</p>

  <p>With the exception of mild extravagances for books, theatres, and
  clothing&mdash;for while Dinny always dressed conservatively, he dressed
  well&mdash;his personal outlay was so trifling that for more than two years
  his disbursements per month had rarely exceeded his income per week; nor was
  that quite all of the story, for he had been very fortunate in his discreet
  speculations.</p>

  <p>Tommy Forsythe, whose natural flair for prognosticating movements in the
  stock market had been capitalized to his own very considerable advantage, was
  generous with timely tips. Without making much more than an interesting
  avocation of his investments, at Tommy's canny suggestion, Dinny had been
  doubling his income. If, therefore, he should find himself disposed to take
  on a "research" or any other kind of a secretary, it would be no
  inconvenience.</p>

  <p>It was quite evident from the plaintiveness of her little distress-signal
  that Joan was in straitened circumstances. Dinny tried to imagine the
  glorious satisfaction he would experience at sight of the superb creature,
  exquisitely groomed, smartly gowned, happily independent, with pride in her
  eyes and money in her purse&mdash;himself responsible for her well-being.</p>

  <p>For the first hour after his receipt of her letter, Dinny's entire
  attention had been devoted to the pleasant daydream of wrapping a probably
  half-starved Joan around an expensive collation of Vitamins A, B, and C, to
  the accompaniment of haunting melodies dispensed by the Hungarian orchestra
  at Dexter's. Joan, stifled and staled by who knew what drudgeries out in
  little Pine Hill, Wisconsin, should have a sunny, gaily equipped apartment,
  high up, somewhere on Riverside Drive, with a beautiful view. He would show
  her how a successful young syndicate writer thought his secretarial help
  ought to be treated. It would be great fun.</p>

  <p>But when he tried to construct a tentative portrait of Joan's patrician
  face, in its response to a detailed statement of his happy plans for her
  comfort, he found himself dismayed. Joan would not fit into that picture.
  Joan would not consent to become his beneficiary, nor would she accept a
  penny more than such secretarial services were worth on the open market....
  And, by the way, just what would be the nature of such services? Any flimsy
  subterfuge he might ingeniously invent would only invite Joan's indignation,
  once she discovered herself in a mere sinecure.</p>

  <p>Only one tenable suggestion offered itself. Dinny, as an ardent student of
  Pepysian lore and the Restoration which he considered the most interesting
  period of English history, had lately amused himself by tinkering with an
  idea for a magazine article to be entitled "Pepys on Lord's Day." His only
  reason for not proceeding to the first draft of it, at once, was explained by
  his own distaste for the considerable drudgery involved in digging out of the
  diary all of Samuel's chronicles in reference thereunto.</p>

  <p>He could set Joan at that. Surely she need not suspect that such
  employment was mere make-believe. By Gad, he wanted that information. Dinny
  found himself becoming rather indignant in his imaginary debate with Joan,
  who had looked him squarely in the eye and accused him of giving her
  something to do that nobody in his proper senses would ever want done....
  What do <i>you</i> know about what I want? Maybe I'll ask you to mole out
  some further data about other people's observance of the Sabbath. Maybe I'm
  going to write a book&mdash;two or three books&mdash;on this subject. Maybe
  I'll want to know how all the characters in Dickens, Scott, Thackeray,
  Hawthorne, and a lot more, entertained themselves on the Lord's Day....
  That's what a research secretary is about! Funny you didn't know that!</p>

  <p>By evening, Dinny felt himself prepared to answer Joan's letter. His
  manner of approach was friendly but dignifiedly businesslike. He needed
  secretarial help, and it had occurred to him that Joan, if footloose and
  attracted by such employment, would admirably adapt herself to that
  position.</p>

  <p>He didn't mind admitting&mdash;this sheet had to be torn up, several
  times, before it carried just the right degree of restraint&mdash;that it
  would give him more personal pleasure to be working with Joan than with
  anyone else of his entire acquaintance. (Joan mustn't be frightened off by
  hints that he hoped their association might be a bit closer than the business
  relationship contemplated.)... And he was looking forward with keen
  anticipation to her arrival; and when might he expect her&mdash;for the Pepys
  matter would not stand much putting off&mdash;and might he hand her the
  enclosed draft to cover travelling expenses?</p>

  <p>Eight days elapsed before there was a reply. Dinny's face fell when the
  money he had sent her dropped out of the letter.</p>

  <p>She had not expected, she said, that Dinny would personally engineer a job
  for her on his own staff. She had written that she needed work, hoping that
  if Dinny happened to know of anything he would tell her. Her reply to the
  advertisement in <i>The Times</i> "really couldn't be resisted." It had so
  pointedly signalled her out as its object.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">You have kindly inquired what I have been doing. Shortly
  after Father left us&mdash;we were quite out of funds, mother and I&mdash;it
  seemed best for me to apply for work. That was not so easy, for I had not
  been trained for any specific kind of employment.<br>
  <br>
  Barney Vaughn's father&mdash;he was very kind to mother and me through all
  that dreadful time&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>Dinny scowled, wondering apprehensively what might be the nature of the
  obligation Barney's father felt he owed to Joan.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">&mdash;knew a man of influential position with Minch &amp;
  Grimsby's in New York. I got my position that way; started as a saleswoman;
  was soon advanced to the Personnel Department. I liked that very much.<br>
  <br>
  How I came to leave there is too long a story, but you will know it wasn't
  because I stole anything or slighted the work in which I was greatly
  interested. Is it sufficient to say that I walked out, late one afternoon,
  nose in air, on receipt of a significant hint that I might have a much larger
  income by assuming other tasks than I had bargained for? (Now please don't go
  plunging into Minch &amp; Grimsby's waving a hard fist and offering to kill
  somebody.)<br>
  <br>
  Mother was far from well. She had gone to live with Aunt Patty and Uncle Jim
  at Pine Hill, Wisconsin. Uncle Jim Bailey has a furniture store and is the
  town undertaker. He had wanted me to help him in the store.<br>
  <br>
  So I came to Pine Hill. Mother continued to decline. She was never well after
  father's death. Three months ago, she passed away.<br>
  <br>
  Since then, my life here has seemed almost unendurable. There is nothing to
  do that interests me. Uncle Jim and Aunt Patty are very kind and want me to
  stay, but know that I am restless and consent to my going to New
  York.</p><br>

  <p>"By Gad!" shouted Dinny. "She's coming! She's coming!"</p><br>

  <p class="letter">I am returning the money. It was good of you to offer it. I
  have saved enough to pay my expenses. If you really think I can be of use to
  you as a member of your organization&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>"My organization," chuckled Dinny, a bit worried. "Wait till she sees it!
  What could I have said to make her think that?"</p><br>

  <p class="letter">&mdash;I'll do my level best. If it doesn't work out, maybe
  you can help me find something else.<br>
  <br>
  I expect to leave here about the middle of next week. I shall call you up
  about ten o'clock Friday morning, and get my orders.</p>

  <p class="letter">Gratefully, <br>
  JOAN.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">She did not expect to be met at the train, but he would
  surprise her. Deducing from the time-tables, Dinny hypothetically routed Joan
  to arrive at six-thirty on Thursday evening. Short of funds, she would not
  patronize an extra-fare train. Neither would she linger in Chicago.
  Six-thirty was the time.</p>

  <p>Thursday was the longest day he had ever spent. In the forenoon he went up
  to The Roosevelt and reserved a room "for a lady who is to be my guest for a
  couple of days, at least," the clerk, recognizing Dinny's name, promising
  every attention and giving definite assurance that the bill would not be
  presented to Miss Braithwaite. Yes&mdash;and he would personally see to it
  that the flowers would be in her room when she arrived.</p>

  <p>A few moments after six o'clock, Dinny was wandering about the huge
  concourse of the Grand Central, nervous as a cat. He tried to kill time by
  inspecting the various wares at the news-stand; bought an expensive box of
  chocolates and the latest <i>L'Illustration.</i> At the quarter-hour, he
  strolled toward the gate. As the minutes slimmed down to four, three, two,
  Dinny found his heart beating rapidly. The suspense was eating him up.</p>

  <p>The straggling group of welcomers began lining up along the ropes. The
  gate was open now. The train was in. The vanguard of the day-coachers plodded
  up the incline, bumping their legs with their fat, frumpy luggage.</p>

  <p>Here came Joan!... She was carrying her own bags. She looked weary. Now
  they had found each other's eyes, and her half-reproachful, half-pouting
  little smile seemed to be saying, "You really shouldn't have gone to the
  trouble. I didn't expect it."</p>

  <p>Dinny reached for her baggage and passed it along to a redcap. Joan put
  both her hands in his, as his welcoming gesture invited, and lifted her brown
  eyes inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"How did you know?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I meet all the trains," said Dinny. "Sometimes people come to
  New York alone&mdash;and appreciate a little friendly greeting."</p>

  <p>"Taxi, sah?" inquired the red-cap.</p>

  <p>"No," snapped Dinny&mdash;"The Roosevelt."</p>

  <p>"Yassah... At the desk, sah."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;Dinny!" protested Joan, as she watched her bags bobbing away
  through the crowd, "I can't afford to go to The Roosevelt&mdash;even for
  tonight."</p>

  <p>"We're going there for dinner." Dinny took her arm, and signified by his
  manner that there was to be no debate about this.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I've had my&mdash;really, Dinny, I'm so mussed and the train was
  so dirty. All I want is to go some-place where I can clean up." Joan halted,
  obdurately.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;she had made this long journey in day-coaches, and was worn to a
  frazzle!</p>

  <p>"Where had you thought of going?" demanded Dinny.</p>

  <p>"Out to the place on Eighty-Sixth&mdash;where I lived before."</p>

  <p>"You come with me, and do as I say.... You're my employee, now, and this
  is an order." Dinny tried to be very stern.</p>

  <p>"I don't begin work until tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless... Let's have no nonsense. You're tired."</p>

  <p>Rather confused and reluctant, Joan demurely consented to be propelled
  through the throng in the brightly lighted station. Dinny paused at the desk,
  spoke to the room-clerk, and, turning to Joan, said, in a tone that expected
  her prompt compliance:</p>

  <p>"Follow the boy... Give yourself plenty of time... If there's anything you
  want, ask for it... I've an errand. I'll meet you here in the lobby at
  eight."</p>

  <p>Joan shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to, Dinny." Her eyes were troubled.</p>

  <p>"It would be quite embarrassing&mdash;if you didn't."</p>

  <p>She stood for a moment, debating, and then said, her voice lowered almost
  to a whisper&mdash;"I can't pay for it... I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>Dinny looked her soberly in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Please do as I tell you!" he said, biting his words into a crisp
  command.</p>

  <p>She drew a tired little smile, and followed the boy.</p>

  <p>"Strike <i>one!"</i> said Dinny, triumphantly, to himself, as he watched
  her enter the elevator... "The darling!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Joan's hour and a half had done wonders for her. When she
  came down, Dinny, who had been pacing about, restlessly, watching the clock
  and counting the minutes, quickly joined her, wondering if other people were
  not thinking him a lucky dog. She was simply dressed in black crêpe, but
  carried herself with all the poise and confidence of a queen in ermine.</p>

  <p>Dinny's admiration shone in his face. He was recklessly ecstatic.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you grown some more, Dinny?" she asked, taking up her napkin.</p>

  <p>"I hope not.... I wasn't exactly frail before, if you recall.... Remember
  the trip we took through the ravine, the time Ernie sent us for a key?"</p>

  <p>Joan smiled, nodded, flushed a little.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I wasn't a very pleasant companion," she said,
  regretfully.</p>

  <p>"You had good reason, Joan... I had been behaving very badly. You'll find
  I've changed... Vastly improved&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dinny broke off to order their dinner, consulting her wishes, but making
  it evident that her negatives were not taken seriously when she demurred
  against unnecessary items.</p>

  <p>"What's the nature of this vast improvement, Dinny?" queried Joan, when
  the waiter had retired. "I've been reading your articles."</p>

  <p>"Have you?" Dinny's eyes sparkled, appreciatively. "Then that means you
  like them!"</p>

  <p>Joan pursed a doubtful smile.</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily... One doesn't always have to like what one reads...
  But&mdash;I'm an optimist, you know. I keep on hoping you'll write something
  I'll like, sometime."</p>

  <p>"For instance?"&mdash;Dinny was too happy to be dashed by her
  criticism&mdash;"If you'll tell me what sort of thing you'd enjoy, I'll make
  a special effort, dear."</p>

  <p>There was a considerable delay before Joan replied, and when she lifted
  her eyes they did not immediately meet his own.</p>

  <p>"Dinny"&mdash;she said, as if announcing a resolution that had required
  some debate, and might not be warmly received&mdash;"let's start right...
  I've come here to work for you... Please dont make it awkward for me.
  Or&mdash;I'll not be able to do it, you know."</p>

  <p>"But you <i>are</i> my dear, Joan!... You needn't try to reciprocate, the
  least bit. I'm not expecting it. I'll not worry you with it. You're to think
  of me as your employer, and you can be assured of the sort of treatment that
  would be desirable by an employee... But&mdash;you will be my dear Joan...
  just the same!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Dinny," she replied, respectfully grateful. "Now let's talk
  about something else... Where is your office? Do I come at nine? Are there
  other&mdash;help? How much of my work will be done in the library? I hardly
  know what you want me to do, you know."</p>

  <p>Neither did Dinny know. He suggested that they eat their dinner untroubled
  by dull care: plenty of time for that. Her hours would be of her own
  choosing. There was no office. There were no other secretaries. Joan was to
  make the researches for him, and report "from time to time."</p>

  <p>"Once in the morning&mdash;and once in the afternoon, maybe?" guessed
  Joan, vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Something like that&mdash;or once a week, anyhow," agreed Dinny,
  indecisively&mdash;"unless, of course, you were working on an assignment like
  this Pepys affair, which will probably take you a month, at the least."</p>

  <p>"Then I won't see you for a month&mdash;after you've told me exactly what
  you want?"</p>

  <p>Dinny made a quick gesture of protest.</p>

  <p>"See me! Of course! Every day! We'll be having dinner together, and there
  are at least a dozen good shows you'll have to see without delay.... You
  didn't think I would let you perish of loneliness, did you?... Shall we
  dance?"</p>

  <p>Joan was thoughtful for an instant; bit her pretty lip, and reflected,
  seriously. Then, apparently coming to an impulsive decision, she nodded
  brightly, rose, and offered herself to his arms. Dinny held her very close,
  and whispered: "You precious darling!"</p>

  <p>She brushed his cheek lightly with her hair, and murmured, entreatingly,
  rather breathlessly:</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dinny&mdash;please&mdash;let's don't&mdash;I mustn't."</p>

  <p>But her fingers tightened on his shoulder, and Dinny's happiness was
  almost more than he could bear.</p>

  <p>"You <i>are</i> my darling... aren't you, Joan?"</p>

  <p>She did not reply, but glanced up into Dinny's eyes, searching them
  soberly&mdash;and smiled.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Dinny was aroused at eight from sleep, profound because
  belated, and felt a great wave of happiness breaking over him.</p>

  <p>The messenger at his door handed in a letter bearing the device of the
  Roosevelt Hotel.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Dinny:<br>
  <br>
  I've been thinking things over. I don't see how I can work for you. Maybe you
  will help me find something else to do. Please don't try to dissuade me. I'll
  meet you in the hotel lobby at one, as we agreed. Would you like to take me
  to the Metropolitan Art Museum after luncheon? I'd love it. Thanks for
  everything.</p>

  <p class="letter">JOAN.</p><br>

  <p>So&mdash;that was that. Joan insisted on having something else to do.
  Perhaps she was right. He would consult Tommy. He would tell Tommy all about
  it&mdash;everything! No&mdash;Joan wouldn't like that. He would approach
  Tommy as if the applicant for work were a casual acquaintance.</p>

  <p>At ten, he had Tommy on the telephone. Would Tommy do him a favour? Very
  capable young woman, daughter of the late president of his little college in
  Ohio, was in town seeking employment. Yes&mdash;she had had good experience
  at Minch &amp; Grimsby's. Did Tommy know of an opening anywhere?</p>

  <p>"Might possibly place her here with us, if she's all you say," replied
  Tommy, obligingly. "Tell her to come in at once. I'll talk to her."</p>

  <p>Splendid! Dinny called Joan, who was in&mdash;and delighted. She would go
  over to Lacey's at once. Mr. Forsythe? Thanks!... Dinny should hear all about
  the interview when they met. Yes&mdash;at once. She'd be waiting. Thanks
  again, Dinny!</p>

  <p>"Such a busy morning!" exclaimed Joan, breathlessly, when he joined her.
  "I'm moving back to my old place on Eighty-Sixth, where I lived before. My
  trunk has gone out there already."</p>

  <p>"How did you make out with Tommy Forsythe?" queried Dinny.</p>

  <p>"Beautifully!" Joan was radiant. "He was so friendly. I'm to be in his
  department for a month, beginning Monday; and then, after I've learned my way
  about, as he put it, I'm to be given a chance in the Personnel... I'm so
  happy... What all did you tell him, Dinny?"</p>

  <p>He gave her a proud smile.</p>

  <p>"Just that you were an acquaintance, daughter of my college president,
  fine girl. I didn't add that you were an adorable, lovely&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut!" cautioned Joan, softly.</p>

  <p>"The taxi-driver won't tell&mdash;and, as for Tommy, he'll discover it.
  Tommy's one of the best there is, Joan. I hope you'll like him."</p>

  <p>She was sure she would. Tommy had treated her as an old friend. She was
  going to like it at Lacey's.</p>

  <p>"And so"&mdash;regretted Dinny, dolefully&mdash;"you're not to be my fair
  employee, after all. I'd quite counted on it, you know."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I can help you, anyway. I wouldn't mind digging out the story of
  what Sam Pepys did on Sundays. I might do it, evenings... Any more work on
  the novel, today?"</p>

  <p>"Very little... No composition; just a few more rough notes, and a short
  cross-section of conversation between Cecil and Margery, who've got
  themselves in no end of a scrape."</p>

  <p>"You mean <i>you've</i> got them into a scrape," accused Joan. "You
  created them; didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"It's a fairly accurate picture of real life, I think," said Dinny,
  defensively. "Such things happen every day."</p>

  <p>They had arrived at a little French restaurant on Forty-Fifth, a favourite
  of his, and were investigating&mdash;Joan with curiosity&mdash;their
  variegated assortment of <i>hors d'&oelig;uvres.</i> She had insisted on
  knowing something more about the new story which Dinny had begun to tell her
  last night. Throughout the luncheon he talked and she listened attentively,
  without more comment than little murmurs of encouragement and interest.</p>

  <p>When, however, he had brought the narrative up to date with the stark
  outline of an episode considerably to the discredit of his principal
  characters, Joan frowned&mdash;a little flushed.</p>

  <p>"It had never occurred to me before," remarked Joan, when their taxi had
  reached Fifth Avenue and had turned north en route to The Metropolitan, "what
  a heavy responsibility rests on the shoulders of a story-writer."</p>

  <p>"In what way, dear?... Let's have your theory."</p>

  <p>She hesitated, groping for adequate phrases.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I can't express it, but it's something like this: when a man
  builds a bridge, or a tower, or paints a picture, or composes a song, he
  really isn't a creator in the sense that a novelist is a creator....
  You&mdash;for example&mdash;created Cecil and Margery, just as Jehovah
  created Adam and Eve&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dinny laughed, teasingly.</p>

  <p>"That Garden of Eden affair points no moral, Joan. That was just a
  story&mdash;about Adam and Eve."</p>

  <p>She nodded, victoriously.</p>

  <p>"Exactly!&mdash;and so is this just a story&mdash;about Cecil and Margery.
  Who's ever going to estimate the wholesale damage done to human personality,
  through the ages, by that Eden tale?.... No&mdash;I don't believe it, and I
  know you don't, but millions have believed it, and do believe, at this
  moment! Think of the centuries of unfair, unjust, belittling appraisals of
  God&mdash;all derived from some ancient shepherd-minstrel's fantastic story,
  told at an evening camp-fire on some desert oasis!"</p>

  <p>"Bravo&mdash;Joan! Proceed! God!&mdash;that's good!"</p>

  <p>"One of the best things you've done, Dinny, is to sneer and scowl at that
  old story, and its monstrous implications. Many times, in your ridicule of
  orthodoxy, you've pointed the finger of scorn at a crafty Jehovah who would
  bring an innocent pair of inquisitive people into the world, and immediately
  direct their attention to some experiment brimming with tragedy.... But
  aren't you doing the same thing to Cecil and Margery?"</p>

  <p>"How absurd!" laughed Dinny.</p>

  <p>"It's too serious to be absurd," persisted Joan, soberly. "Your new book
  will be on the stands in a few months. It will have a great sale among all
  the restless, scornful, idol-smashers in the land. They follow you as if you
  were a new messiah. You've never done a novel for them, and they'll grab at
  this one while it's still damp from the binders."</p>

  <p><i>"Laus Deo!"</i> exclaimed Dinny, fervently. "I hope you're right!"</p>

  <p>"It's a very pretty picture you draw of Margery, innocently yearning for
  an expanded life. Little Glenville, Missouri, offers security, three meals a
  day, and a minimum of struggle; but Margery isn't quite satisfied with her
  easy Eden. She wants a larger life. Well&mdash;why in Heaven's Name, don't
  you give it to her?"</p>

  <p>The taxi drew up at the kerb. They sauntered up the steps, momentarily
  diverted from their serious theme, traversed the spacious foyer, and
  continued through to the huge chamber of replicas and models of classic
  buildings.</p>

  <p>"Let's sit here for a moment, Dinny... I think I want to finish what I was
  saying... It's quite important&mdash;to me, at least."</p>

  <p>She laid her hand lightly on his arm, and swept his face with an
  entreating query.</p>

  <p>"This Cecil&mdash;he was so discontented, too, in Sparrow, Minnesota;
  wanted to go places and do things. Why didn't you let him?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't I?" protested Dinny.</p>

  <p>"What makes it all seem so pitifully tragic," Joan went on, unheeding, "is
  just the fact that a hundred thousand young Cecils and Margerys, fretting and
  steaming in their little Glenvilles and Sparrows, are sure to identify
  themselves with this pair of revolutionists. Can't you think of some better
  destination for these people of yours, who are sure to be trailed by a
  nondescript army of admirers, than this degrading wallow you've planned for
  them?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;it isn't quite that bad, Joan... Come now!"</p>

  <p>"Dinny&mdash;you've a great chance! There isn't a priest or a preacher or
  a poet or a professor in the whole world who has the opportunity that you
  have.... You haven't gone in for sentiment. You haven't had any use for
  religion. You've been a fire-eating iconoclast. Every cynical young fellow,
  bent on freedom from the old frustrations, is hanging on your words. There
  isn't one single idealist, in the whole crew of modern apostles, able to
  command the attention of these discontented people&mdash;people like you and
  me.... Why don't you capitalize this peculiar grip you've got on the
  imagination of your&mdash;your Cave of Adullam, and show them the way out!...
  <i>What a chance!"</i></p>

  <p>"Nonsense, Joan!" scoffed Dinny, superiorly. "What sort of a figure d'you
  think I'd cut? I'm not writing Rollo books. There'd be a laugh go up that you
  could hear to the poles!... Besides&mdash;I'd rather draw honest pictures of
  life as it is, no matter how ugly, than to paint frescoes and friezes of the
  heavenly host. I'll leave that job to the parsons."</p>

  <p>Joan smiled a little, her expression reminding him of the gentle dejection
  she had shown, one eventful night, in her parlour at Magnolia. She snapped
  the latch of her bag, absently, a few times, and rose.</p>

  <p>"Let's forget it&mdash;then," she said, strolling over to the model of the
  Acropolis.</p>

  <p>Dinny joined her, silently, and not a little troubled.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He had not seen Joan for five days. She had begged off from
  engagements on the ground of fatigue. Her hours were long, her new work was
  exacting because unfamiliar, a great deal depended upon the record she might
  make for herself at Lacey's, especially through these probationary days. The
  excuse was valid, and Dinny had tried to be patient.</p>

  <p>Tonight they had dined at Dexter's and were now en route to a musical show
  at The Strand.</p>

  <p>"Been seeing much of old Tommy?"</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;every day.... We lunched together, yesterday."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that was customary," commented Dinny, with a surprised
  little chuckle. "You might as well have worked for <i>me."</i> He tried to
  make this sound like a pleasantry.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. Tommy thinks I've the makings of a buyer, and wanted to
  tell me a lot of things there's no time for, when we're working. It was very
  interesting."</p>

  <p>Dinny pretended interest in the traffic-jam, ahead.</p>

  <p>"That's quite reasonable. Tommy can do a great deal for you, if he wants
  to&mdash;and evidently he does. You've got on well with him.... Calling him
  'Tommy' now, eh?"</p>

  <p>"He's just a big boy." Joan's tone was maternal. "It's awfully easy to
  call him 'Tommy,' don't you think? It was you got me into it. ... Rather I'd
  not?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I care?" Dinny's magnanimity was almost militant. "I just
  asked out of curiosity. I had hoped you two would like each other....
  Well&mdash;here we are, dear."</p>

  <p>The show was good; tuneful, colourful. Joan seemed to enjoy every minute
  of it. Gad&mdash;how vital she was! Dinny tried to share her enthusiasm, but
  had to confess to himself that the piece was dull and tedious. Annoying
  little dissonances rasping from deep inside him, shrilled the ensemble until
  the clamorous yelp of it tore at his nerves. He was glad when it was done,
  and inhaled the first tonic draught of the outer air with reinvigorated
  spirits.</p>

  <p>Joan was graciously remote, almost too interested in her distractions to
  be giving much thought to the new phase of their comradeship. Whether she was
  still sensing the slight constraint which had slowed them up, on that
  afternoon at The Metropolitan, or had some other reason for mentally fending
  him off, Dinny could not make sure. They were on the way to her quarters,
  now&mdash;she had insisted, because of her work&mdash;and within another five
  minutes Dinny would be headed for home tormented by forebodings.</p>

  <p>"Can't we take a little spin in the park before we put in?" suggested
  Dinny. "It isn't late."</p>

  <p>"If you like."</p>

  <p>He spoke to the driver, who nodded, and slackened the speed.</p>

  <p>"Life has become very important, darling, since you came." Dinny's voice
  was tender. He reached for her hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I came, too, Dinny," she responded, promptly. "I never was so
  happy before... almost as happy as I'd like to be."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I'm supposed to know what that means&mdash;about
  your&mdash;your wish to be happier.... Is it&mdash;anything I can do?"</p>

  <p>Joan did not immediately reply.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know, dear," she said, at length, doubtfully. "I
  rather hoped you could, but&mdash;maybe not."</p>

  <p>He drew her to him.</p>

  <p>"Joan, dear&mdash;we do belong to each other, you know."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes&mdash;I've thought that, too, Dinny." There was a weary little
  sigh. "But&mdash;you see&mdash;I have to live. I need air, light, sunshine!
  You don't seem to require it. Sometimes we really do belong&mdash;just for a
  moment... and then... well&mdash;we don't belong any more than&mdash;than
  rocks and petunias belong!"</p>

  <p>"But, darling, we needn't try to be alike! That's the real beauty of a
  comradeship like ours. Neither has to sacrifice personality, opinions, or
  individuality of outlook."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;we needn't try to be alike," repeated Joan, thoughtfully, "but
  it would be preferable if we belonged to the same kingdom of nature. I'm for
  the world! I like it! It warms me, and I respond to it.... You're at war with
  it, Dinny."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Joan, dear&mdash;can't you forget this silly little difference in our
  viewpoint.... I love you, darling."</p>

  <p>"I know," murmured Joan, laying her cheek lightly against his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"And you?" he whispered. "You do care&mdash;don't you, Joan?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Dinny&mdash;I care.... I care so much that I simply couldn't
  bear to live that close to perfect happiness&mdash;and&mdash;and be robbed of
  it."</p>

  <p>"I'll try&mdash;very hard&mdash;Joan," promised Dinny, sincerely.</p>

  <p>"Do&mdash;please&mdash;Dinny!"</p>

  <p>Joan's cheeks were wet with tears when he kissed her. He was stirred to an
  almost painful ecstasy by her response to that kiss.</p>

  <p>For a long moment she clung to his lips; then, nestling her face against
  his arm, with a tremulous little sigh, she said, with passionate
  insistence:</p>

  <p>"Don't fail me, Dinny.... You know&mdash;now&mdash;how much I love
  you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JOAN, who had been crying, was mechanically collecting the
  remains of their picnic; the mockingly gay paper plates, the paper cups, the
  half-emptied little bottles of olives, artichoke hearts, anchovies, the
  sandwiches, the devilled eggs, the chicken, the ingenious French
  pastries.</p>

  <p>"Don't bother, Dinny," she said, pensively, as he ventured to assist.</p>

  <p>He put down the salad plate and made quite a task of lighting his pipe,
  uncomfortably wondering if Joan felt herself not only an object of compassion
  but of chagrin, too, as she sat, tousled and swollen-eyed, gathering up the
  pitifully absurd litter of the feast she had spread, an hour earlier, with
  such a bright, confident air, archly mystifying him with the delicacies she
  conjured from her wicker basket.</p>

  <p>It was rather debasing to Joan, wasn't it, to sit here and owlishly watch
  her attend to these little drudgeries? Perhaps it was even more humiliating
  to her if he tried, awkwardly, to share them.</p>

  <p>"Go take a stroll and smoke your pipe," she suggested, divining his
  perplexity. "I'm not very nice to look at, anyway." She smiled, with a sort
  of childish contrition. "I'm sure my nose is red.... Awfully sorry,
  Dinny."</p>

  <p>"It was a crime for us to quarrel on a day like this," growled Dinny. "All
  my fault, Joan."</p>

  <p>She shook her head, preoccupiedly.</p>

  <p>"I'll divide the honours with you.... Run along, dear. I'd so much rather
  you did... And we won't talk about it again&mdash;ever!... Anyone would think
  we might have learned better&mdash;by now."</p>

  <p>"My God&mdash;yes! We're a couple o' fools!" Dinny unfolded his long legs
  and scrambled to his feet. "I'll be back presently, then. You've the book....
  Think I'll saunter down and see the chap's sailboat."</p>

  <p>They had left shortly before eight, that June morning, bound for the
  country in Dinny's new sport roadster which he had bought with just such
  excursions in view. They had had the streets to themselves. Dinny had called
  the tubby old Hoboken ferry their private yacht.</p>

  <p>Shady, lawn-clipped Montclair was still asleep when they rolled softly
  through. Except for an ambling group of little girls with long curls and
  short skirts, three of them walking backwards, obviously bound for Sunday
  School, and a slim, sedate lady of forty-plus, carrying a black parasol
  loftily over a high-perched black hat, who was being overtaken and passed by
  a square, craggy, determined man with a Bible, the residence streets were
  deserted.</p>

  <p>Joan had furnished most of the talk, gaily offering an unpunctuated flow
  of light persiflage, undaunted by Dinny's silent and studious attention to
  the road, for he was still far from a competent driver. It was clear, though,
  that he had something on his mind besides his responsibility at the
  wheel.</p>

  <p>Greenwood Lake, their objective, was all that Joan had hoped it might be
  when, last night, they had touched heads over the road-map in her little
  parlour.</p>

  <p>The shiny blue car was parked in the grove, at eleven.</p>

  <p>Suddenly shaking loose from his dourly reflective mood, Dinny made up for
  his taciturnity on the road by exhibiting a noisy hilarity as he unloaded
  their festival cargo and spread the new motor-rug on the grass, fifty yards
  from the lake-shore. But his impetuous jollity bubbled by artifice, thought
  Joan. It was not quite spontaneous... Perhaps he would tell her.</p>

  <p>They were nearly finished with their luncheon when, Joan having come to a
  full stop in her narrative of recent events at Lacey's, Dinny, who had been
  fixedly staring at her face without hearing a word she said, suddenly blurted
  out:</p>

  <p>"I've some news for you."</p>

  <p>Joan nodded, understandingly.</p>

  <p>"I knew you had," she said, playfully, but a little anxious.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure you will approve," he warned, "but I've accepted the
  editorship of <i>Hallelujah...</i> Begin in September."</p>

  <p>She recoiled as if he had struck her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dinny&mdash;how could you&mdash;after what you'd promised? There
  isn't a magazine in the whole lot of them that's been so mean&mdash;and
  cynical&mdash;and fault-finding... It has hurt me when you even contributed
  to it. Now you're to operate it!... I'm sorry you told me."</p>

  <p>Dinny did not meet her eyes, but gazed glassily at the lake, scowling.</p>

  <p>"Don't my feelings count, at all, dear?" persisted Joan, tenderly
  reproachful.</p>

  <p>He recalled himself, then, as from a distance, and regarded her
  critically.</p>

  <p>"I've never undertaken to discipline your thoughts, Joan," said Dinny,
  crisply, "and&mdash;I hope this isn't going to sound too surly&mdash;I
  dispute your right to regulate mine."</p>

  <p>"In other words&mdash;it isn't any of my business."</p>

  <p>Dinny leaned back on one elbow, toying with the fringes of the rug.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have thought of using that phrase, Joan, but&mdash;is it?...
  You see"&mdash;Dinny's brows contracted as he felt for his words&mdash;"it's
  very difficult to refashion another's mind, even if both the&mdash;the
  redeemer and the sinner are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think that's very kind, Dinny... And I dislike being talked to
  that way," interrupted Joan, her lips trembling.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;putting the mere choice of words aside&mdash;you've honestly
  and lovingly wanted to make me over into something other than I am.... And I
  have honestly and lovingly tried to accommodate you. But it's no good. It
  won't work. I can't do it. If our difference of taste were&mdash;Look here:
  if I hated golf, and you liked it, I would go with you and play it&mdash;just
  because it brought you pleasure. I'd learn to like it for that reason. But
  this is a different matter, dear. This is a problem of work and wages, bread
  and butter. I'm a journalist. That's my profession. I'm not omniscient, and I
  can't write about just anything and everything. My line is criticism. And
  when you ask me to leave off criticism, and go in for hymn-writing and sappy
  little twitters set to the score of 'Buttercups and Daisies,' you've asked
  too much!"</p>

  <p>Joan, with mounting indignation, made an impatient little cry, but Dinny
  raised a hand, briefly, and went on doggedly:</p>

  <p>"There's a whole battalion of sugary smilers, rocking and knitting and
  purring on the front porches of 'Houses Built By the Side of the Road.' I
  doubt if there's room in the journalism of loving-kindness for one more
  dulcet coo; and, if there were, I'm mighty sure I haven't the voice for it. I
  know you've set your heart on my doing it; and, because I wanted to please
  you, I've made some sincere experiments in that direction; bought a little
  volume of verse entitled 'Just Folks,' and tried to set my big feet in those
  dainty tracks, but it was hopeless, darling. I put on my starchy white
  pinafore, tied my little pink sunbonnet under my chin, and went skipping
  merrily down the road with a nice basket of pansies for rheumatic old Granny
  MacDoodle, but before I had gone very far I found myself grinning again. I
  can't help grinning, Joan. You'll either have to get used to that
  grin&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or&mdash;<i>what?"</i> queried Joan, soberly.</p>

  <p>Dinny was tardy with his reply.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the alternative is&mdash;up to you."</p>

  <p>"May I talk now?"</p>

  <p>"Please do. It's your turn."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I never asked you to scribble soft sentimentalities. I hate
  them, too. There's been too much of it. But there's a pretty wide gap between
  'Pollyanna' and <i>Hallelujah.</i> It's easy enough to understand why people
  crowd about the news-stands to buy <i>Hallelujah.</i> They've been fed up to
  the throat on the other thing.... But <i>Hallelujah</i> isn't the right
  answer to their demand for something more sturdy and sensible than mawkish
  slush.</p>

  <p>"There are a few things that deserve better than to be ridiculed. I looked
  through the last issue of <i>Hallelujah</i>&mdash;because you asked me to.
  One article was a reprint of a little booklet some man had written for
  private circulation among his friends and neighbours. It was dedicated to the
  Kiwanis Club. He was its president in Littlegrass, or somewhere, Oklahoma. He
  and his wife had just returned from a six-weeks' trip to Europe, and he
  wanted to tell his friends what they had seen. It was badly written, and full
  of childish comments; but the man hadn't prepared it for the smart young
  spoofers who read <i>Hallelujah.</i> It was intended for simple-hearted,
  inexperienced people who own the houses they live in, and pay their bills,
  and go to church on Sunday, and have only one wife.... And
  <i>Hallelujah</i>&mdash;that's always ranting about the bad manners of yokels
  who eat with their knives, and don't know whether Chekhov won the last Irish
  sweepstakes or swam the Channel or designed the dome for Saint
  Peter's&mdash;printed that friendly little booklet&mdash;mistakes and
  all&mdash;to fetch a chuckle from the really cultured people, the smart
  people who've been about, and know which spoon comes first&mdash;and who
  wrote 'Ulysses.'... I don't believe I could bear it to see your name at the
  top of the staff in a magazine so&mdash;so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;so self-consciously clever! So pompously superior! So insolently
  vulgar!... If that's the kind of company you find yourself at home with,
  Dinny Brumm, I'm sure you'd never be very happy with me!... You've said you
  aren't 'omniscient,' and mustn't be expected to write about everything.
  That's just where we disagree. You <i>do</i> think you're omniscient!
  <i>Hallelujah</i> is omniscient! There isn't anything that <i>Hallelujah</i>
  doesn't know, far better than anyone else. It cackles at theology for being
  dogmatic, and calls all the preachers idiots and all the creeds
  rubbish&mdash;and after it's through ridiculing them, the all-wise
  <i>Hallelujah</i> proceeds to be just as dogmatic and arbitrary as the people
  it reviles.... It's always poking fun at Jehovah.... You'd think, from the
  way it hands down sublime oracles about Art, the Drama, Music, Literature,
  that it expected the whole world to reserve its opinion about any art-form
  until <i>Hallelujah</i> had spoken.... After that, the wise would know just
  what it would be safe for them to think.... And now you're going to be the
  Solomon who supervises the schooling of the sophisticates....
  No&mdash;Dinny!&mdash;I don't believe I could live comfortably quite that
  close to the summit of Olympus. I'm afraid the bright light would hurt my
  eyes. I'd always be at a terrible disadvantage!"</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," rasped Dinny, "that's that&mdash;and now we know where
  we stand.... It would be tragic for us to go on with it."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you see it, at last," agreed Joan, in the same tone.</p>

  <p>Dinny's lip curled, unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"By the way," he drawled, dryly, "speaking of sarcasm and ridicule, you're
  fairly good at it yourself. I may be bitter enough, but I'd never talk that
  way to anyone I loved.... And I don't believe you could, either."</p>

  <p>Joan hung her head, and put both hands over her eyes, and wept like a
  little child.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dinny, forgive me," she pleaded, brokenly. "I didn't mean to hurt
  you."</p>

  <p>For an instant, he was moved to join her with assurances, but still
  smarting under the sharp raps, he delayed; and the longer he delayed the
  harder it was to conciliate.</p>

  <p>Joan's little storm of emotion cleared. She wiped her eyes, and tried to
  smile. Dinny stole a quick glance, and solemnly looked away, heavy-eyed. With
  a long sigh, broken by little sobs, she began to gather up the fragments,
  Dinny watching her automatic movements dully. She was a typical picture, he
  thought, of Woman&mdash;instinctively carrying on with the tasks Nature had
  assigned to her, regardless of what tragedy might rake her heart.... No man
  would have done it. A man would stalk away&mdash;and let the damned dishes go
  to hell!</p>

  <p>He pitied her, and his pity was tinctured with a trace of vicarious
  mortification. He could have wept, himself. He picked up the smeary little
  paper plate on which his salad had been served him, and was in the act of
  passing it across to her.</p>

  <p>"Don't bother, Dinny," she said, pensively.</p>

  <p>He walked down to the shore where a tanned youth was untangling some new
  white ropes in his little sailboat, and was surprised at the steadiness and
  nonchalance of his own voice as he chatted, amiably, with the young stranger.
  Here he was&mdash;only three minutes and one hundred and fifty feet away from
  a disaster that had pulled his very house down about his ears&mdash;calmly
  puffing his pipe and inquiring whether the yacht's ropes were the same thing
  as sash-cord.</p>

  <p>Did that mean, he asked himself, that his love for Joan was of less
  consequence to his happiness than he had thought? Or was his quick recovery
  due to the fact that he was taking the instinctive course of Man? Woman,
  anchored to dishes and brooms and beds and babies, always had had time to
  think&mdash;to grieve, to regret, to mope and grow morbid. Man, whacked over
  the head with a battle-axe, had had no chance to sit down and nurse his
  hurts. He must instantly be on the alert for another wallop from some other
  direction.... He and Joan were faithful to their respective atavistic
  responses to their mutual disaster. She was sitting there on the grass,
  crying softly, and telling herself her world had gone to smash. He was
  smoking his pipe, and talking to a stranger about different weights and
  weaves of rope.... But that didn't mean his little Paradise hadn't been
  hurled to Purgatory&mdash;same as Joan's.... Odd&mdash;reflected Dinny....
  Elemental forces!&mdash;he had never felt their grip, or appraised their long
  reach, quite so discriminatingly before.</p>

  <p>She joined him, after a little; sauntering down to the shore with all the
  evidences of her grief discarded. While he had been philosophizing over the
  easy resilience of the male&mdash;the quick, decisive rebound of the male
  who, no matter how straight the gate, how charged with punishment the scroll,
  would remain the master of his fate, the captain of his soul&mdash;the moody,
  brooding female had deftly repacked the hamper, stowed it in the car, combed
  her hair, adjusted her swanky little hat at a jaunty angle, powdered her
  nose, reshaped her lips, donned a smile, and had now slipped a hand through
  his arm as much as to say to the boy in the boat, "I've tamed this Animal to
  drive single or double; rack, pace, trot, run&mdash;or what gait would you
  like to see him do?... I've been training him for fifty thousand years.... He
  doesn't know it, of course. The silly ass thinks he's the warden of the
  asylum instead of a patient."</p>

  <p>Dinny wasn't sure he liked to have his theories tossed about in this
  reckless fashion.</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking," he said, after they had driven a mile without much
  talk. "I've had my nose to the grindstone for a good while&mdash;in my work,
  you know&mdash;and I believe a change of air would be good for me. I'm going
  abroad for a few weeks."</p>

  <p>"Splendid!" enthused Joan. "I wish I could."</p>

  <p>He laid a hand gently on her arm.</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;I'll take you."</p>

  <p>"No, Dinny&mdash;we've settled that!" Her voice was casual now.</p>

  <p>"I'd be glad to, you know."</p>

  <p>"I believe you would&mdash;but it's quite impossible."</p>

  <p>The long silence that followed gave her words a chance to chisel their way
  quite deeply into her memory. She recalled them, with a start, one September
  evening, when, in response to a similar invitation as sincerely offered, she
  used them again, <i>verbatim.</i></p>

  <p>A swarthy gypsy girl, one afternoon, last summer, had padded softly back
  to the little office in Uncle Jim Bailey's dimly lighted, varnish-reeking
  furniture store, and, pausing before Joan's high desk, had said:</p>

  <p>"Your fortune&mdash;for four bits?"</p>

  <p>Joan had declined.</p>

  <p>"Please&mdash;I'm hongry."</p>

  <p>The girl had slipped the half-dollar into a dirty, beaded purse attached
  to her belt, and reached for her client's hand.</p>

  <p>"Make it short," advised Joan. "I'm busy."</p>

  <p>The girl had stooped over the extended palm, scrutinizing it intently,
  Joan, with equal interest, marvelling at the black, straight, coarse hair on
  the bowed head, seeming to belong to a well-groomed horse rather than a young
  woman.</p>

  <p>"You are going on a far jorney... on a beeg boat... with a tall man."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" asked Joan, as the girl moved off, with the slinky gait of
  something born in the woods.</p>

  <p>She paused, spread one brown hand high on her hip, tossed her head
  arrogantly, and retorted, her white teeth gleaming in the twisted,
  half-envious smile:</p>

  <p>"Ees that not enough?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">According to Dinny's weekly letters, the cynical amusement
  he had expressed in his first laconic, staccato, dash-sprinkled note,
  scribbled on his return from viewing the changing of the guard at Buckingham
  Palace, was giving way to an unexpected admiration for monarchy.</p>

  <p>Joan needed never to have been in England to guess what might be Dinny's
  instant reaction to the ancient shrines and tombs of the departed great. He
  had a flair for making history vital, and was extraordinarily well posted on
  the lives of British sovereigns.</p>

  <p>As for the bronze and marble memorabilia of departed kings and queens,
  Dinny's interest was assured, and Joan confidently expected him to relay
  observations faithfully, interestingly reflecting the half-dreamy mood in
  which he would saunter through the gloom of the cathedrals.</p>

  <p>She was quite unprepared, however, for his comments on contemporary
  pageantry.</p>

  <p>"It will have to go, of course," ruminated Dinny, in mid-July, writing
  from the Victoria Hotel in London. "The general drift is toward republics,
  and the last of the kings have already been born. There will be no
  revolution, no choppings-off, no slow tanning of royal heads on iron-spiked
  towers. The British manage to express themselves with but few gestures. They
  are not a yelping, mobbish, excitable race. When the time comes, the king
  will be retired on half-pay and allowed to keep his horses, dogs, and
  grouse-gun.</p>

  <p>"But it will be a great pity when 'the captains and the kings depart';
  especially the kings, though I presume you couldn't very well have kings
  without captains. They'll leave the stage together.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've become quite a tory, Joan. I have had time and
  opportunity for a lot of thinking about this. Humanity hasn't evolved out of
  the king phase. It's a wise, practical government. Republics sound promising
  enough in their constitutions, highfalutin slogans, apostrophes to 'liberty,'
  senatorial oratory, and patriotic verse, but it's no good in practice.</p>

  <p>"I'm for the king! I'm for the divinely ordained king who can do no wrong,
  no matter what capers he cuts. America would be vastly better off topped by a
  real, honest-to-goodness king, with twenty million dollars' worth of diamonds
  in his hat, bells on his fingers and rings on his toes, than a harried,
  worried, temporary president whom any sleek-haired little squirt,
  paragraphing and cartooning for some impudent, wisecracking editor, can smear
  with his smartaleckisms."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;Dinny!" exclaimed Joan, happily, to his photograph on her
  table. "Whatever's happened to you?"</p>

  <p>"The whole king business is on the skids, no doubt; but it's a great
  misfortune. So's the Established Church close to the end of the last inning.
  Nobody on bases, two men cut, and two strikes already called on a feeble
  bat.... But it's a pity. The thing's had a sort of majestic dignity. It's
  never been in a suppliant attitude, penhandling the brethren and sisters for
  sixpences to pay the parson's coal-bill. It has been guaranteed by The State,
  okayed by The Crown. It's been lofty, confident, time-worthy!</p>

  <p>"Maybe it hasn't been quite so fussily, busily, frantically energetic, and
  maybe the rank and file of the people have accepted it rather
  perfunctorily&mdash;about the way they accepted breathing and the circulation
  of their blood&mdash;but it has stood there calmly certifying to an Eternal
  Fact (or at least an Everlasting Wish). It will be voluntarily supported,
  pretty soon, I suppose. And that will be the end of its greatness....
  Oh&mdash;it will still go through the motions; but its dignity will have
  departed.</p>

  <p>"That's what ails the nine score different sects in the States. No
  dignity; because voluntarily financed by people whose Sunday dime has given
  them the right to dictate its policies. Even they&mdash;especially
  they&mdash;who presume to manage the thing have no respect for it. How could
  they? Don't I know? Didn't I grow up in it?</p>

  <p>"Wormy, shiny-elbowed, little Jonas B. Pring, lifetime errand-boy and
  cuspidorian for some fusty old firm of lawyers, snubbed by his betters,
  henpecked at home, hectored by bill-collectors, a measly little nobody,
  contemptuously snooted by his own dog&mdash;he's quite a tremendous fellow at
  The First Church of Christ.... Only place in the whole world where Jonas can
  let himself go, and be somebody... . Gets up at the annual business meeting
  and tells the thirty-six women, nine old men, and four little girls, that the
  Reverend Blubb is no executive and had best be asked to move along.... And on
  what meat hath this our nasty, contemptible, little Jonas fed? How came he so
  important?</p>

  <p>"Jonas was a subscriber. For fifty cents a week, Jonas had bought the
  right to swagger up and down the aisles, distributing hymn-books, himself
  yelping the tune at the top of his lungs. At the small cost of twenty-six
  dollars annually, Jonas B. Pring, who everywhere else was dodging sharp
  elbows, shoe-tips, snarls, and skillets, could fold his important arms high
  over his inflated chest, tuck in his forceful chin, draw a sagacious frown,
  and tell 'em all where to get off at when the Lord's business was under
  discussion at The First Church of Christ."</p>

  <p>Odd, reflected Joan, Dinny's concern about the Church of England. The only
  comment she'd ever heard him make about the Anglicans was a sour remark to
  the effect that their chief job was "to apologize for the Reformation."</p>

  <p>She did not commend him for his slightly altered attitude toward
  "institutions," fearing her approval, however casually phrased, might sound
  I-told-you-so-ish; evaded discussion of his new ideas; filled her letters
  with current news, and doings at Lacey's.</p>

  <p>There was a great deal in her letters about Tommy, inevitable because her
  busy life was now bounded by Lacey's, and Tommy was Lacey's so far as Joan
  was concerned.</p>

  <p>She wrote much too much about Tommy without realizing what conclusions
  Dinny might come to. Tommy's luggage department had been augmented by a line
  of motor-rugs and other whim-whams relating to cars. Tommy had had a raise.
  Tommy had been to Chicago, but was back now.</p>

  <p>Tommy's brother Victor hadn't been at all pleased with the reception he
  had received on his Western tour, and was thinking of giving up the fiddle
  and studying voice. Someone had told him he could sing. Tommy had said he
  wasn't sure yet whom the joke was on, but suspected it might be on
  himself.</p>

  <p>Tommy had a new eight-cylinder car, very pretty and very easy riding.</p>

  <p>After she had mailed her longest and last letter, the second week of
  August, and recalled what an inordinate amount of Tommy had found its way
  into her chronicle of current activities, Joan heartily wished she could have
  it back for revision. However, Dinny would understand. Besides, he liked
  Tommy; didn't he?</p>

  <p>But it was an unfortunate letter to be her last to Dinny, seeing he was so
  far away, and alone. Joan had expected to write at least once more.</p>

  <p>Then the September issue of <i>Hallelujah</i> appeared. She bought it
  hoping to find nothing in it about Dinny's accession to its tripod. The
  announcement was there&mdash;on page one. <i>Hallelujah</i> stated, with a
  swagger, that, from henceforth and until further notice, the increasing
  success of the magazine was assured, and gave the reason that had all but
  broken her heart.</p>

  <p>Leafing with distaste and disgust through the condescendingly superior
  titles, Joan presently came upon Dinny at his worst in a venomous attack on a
  certain great newspaper syndicate.</p>

  <p>It was capped "Greck."</p>

  <p>Soon after her coming to New York, Dinny, in a mellow moment, had confided
  his story to Joan. It was not told to solicit her sympathy, or to interpret
  his maladjustment to the normal ways of viewing human relationships; but,
  with the whole picture of Dinny's frustrated, disillusioned, and embittered
  childhood, she had tried to understand the savagery of his cynicism.</p>

  <p>Sympathetic as she was, however, toward his disaffection in regard to his
  father, there was no excuse, she thought, for this unconscionable
  onslaught.</p>

  <p>It seemed that some prominent editorial writer in the employ of "The Greck
  Syndicate" had caustically criticized <i>Hallelujah</i> on much the same
  grounds as she herself had based her disastrous comments on the magazine in
  discussing it at Greenwood Lake.</p>

  <p>The Craig Syndicate, as everybody knew, had in its employ, at the top, a
  considerable number of keen, clever, high-powered Jews. They were forever
  playing to the prejudices of the vast, unintegrated, dissatisfied, general
  riff-raff.</p>

  <p><i>Hallelujah</i> was in the same business, of course, but bidding for the
  interest of a different clientèle. <i>Hallelujah</i> and the Craig Syndicate
  were as nearly alike as identical twins, except for this: <i>Hallelujah</i>
  appealed to the prejudices and dissatisfactions of some fifty thousand
  self-confessed intelligentsia; the Craig Syndicate appealed to about the same
  invoice of aversions possessed by ten millions of illiterate... How natural
  that they should hate each other!</p>

  <p>Some editorial writer for "Greck"&mdash;Joan presumed it must have been
  the chief incendiary, Enoch Birnbaum&mdash;momentarily forgetting, according
  to Dinny, that he had been divinely ordained to minister unto the
  feeble-minded, had remarked of <i>Hallelujah</i> that it suffered of
  "grandiose paranoia in the penultimate phase of that malady, with paresis
  indicated as the unhappy sequela."</p>

  <p>Dinny, breathing out slaughter, had assumed championship of the besieged
  <i>Hallelujah.</i> Joan, who knew him as well as or better than he knew
  himself, could easily picture with what lip-smacking, demoniacal glee he had
  hauled up the drawbridge, dropped the portcullis, and heated the oil he meant
  to pour down upon the haughty head of "Greck."</p>

  <p>She did not read it all. Undeniably clever, fantastically cruel, Dinny's
  indictment of "Greck" described him in terms of Moses; Moses the law-giver,
  Moses the sea-cleaver, Moses the manna-man, Moses the medicine-man.</p>

  <p>"Greck," assisted by all Israel, and trailed by millions of uncircumcised,
  untutored, and largely unwashed hicks and yokels, was headed for the Promised
  Land. True, he hadn't got any farther than the wilderness, but Jehovah would
  doubtless look after His People, as was His pleasant custom.</p>

  <p>The last paragraph&mdash;the one that gave Joan a sickish feeling as if
  she had witnessed parricide&mdash;was a masterpiece of brutality.</p>

  <p>"If the great Greck ever made a mistake, he does not recall it. This, too,
  was a Mosaic gift&mdash;forgetfulness. In his youth, Moses ran away and hid
  himself after having killed a young neighbour; but if he ever remembered, or
  was regretful, the Good Book&mdash;which almost never omits anything
  resembling contrition&mdash;fails to document his misgivings. It is said that
  Moses' victim was a young man. Had he killed a young girl, he would of course
  have forgotten the incident utterly, and remembered it against himself no
  more."</p>

  <p>Joan tossed the nasty thing into the waste-basket and washed her
  hands.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Tommy Forsythe was sailing tomorrow for Lisbon on the
  <i>Vulcania.</i> It was a business trip. He would go to Italy, also returning
  to New York in late November.</p>

  <p>Joan had lunched with him at Dexter's. He had seemed distraught, probably
  due to his anxiety that all the last-minute duties should have attention. He
  had little to say, Joan furnishing most of the talk.</p>

  <p>At six, he bade her good-bye as she left the store. It was a casual
  farewell; a brief handclasp, a bit of banter.</p>

  <p>At eight-thirty he called her on the telephone. Might he see her for a
  moment about something rather important?... Would she object to a short
  drive?... He would call in ten minutes.</p>

  <p>They headed for Central Park. Tommy was nervous and moody. Joan's
  curiosity mounted.</p>

  <p>"What's on your mind, Tommy?... Anything I can do?"</p>

  <p>He was a long time finding words.</p>

  <p>"Joan"&mdash;the car slowed down to five miles an hour&mdash;"I'm to be
  away quite a while. There's something I'd like to know before I leave. I have
  become very fond of you, as you can't help knowing.... Are you engaged to
  Dinny Brumm?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Then I've a right to tell you that I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, Tommy, please don't!"</p>

  <p>"Will you think about me sometimes, Joan?"</p>

  <p>"You know I will, Tommy. You've been such a dear friend. And I hope you're
  going to have a wonderful trip."</p>

  <p>"I wish you were going along.... I'd take you if you'd go, dear."</p>

  <p>"I believe you would&mdash;but it's quite impossible."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence.</p>

  <p>"Joan&mdash;tell me this much. Are you in love with Dinny?"</p>

  <p>"Must I say?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;you needn't say. I understand."</p>

  <p>Joan patted his arm gratefully.</p>

  <p>"Tommy&mdash;you are a dear."</p>

  <p>He drove her home then, as he had promised, and soberly said good-bye
  again at her door. Joan felt very much depressed. Early in the evening one of
  the girls where she lived had suggested their going to a movie. She should
  have gone. It was too bad&mdash;about Tommy. She had known he liked her, but
  she hadn't been prepared for this.</p>

  <p>Now she could not work for Tommy any more. She would have to leave
  Lacey's. It was rough sledding... for a girl... in business; difficult to
  retain the proper balance. If you were up-stage and untouchable in your
  attitude toward your employer, you had no chance of promotion. If you were
  friendly, he made love to you.</p>

  <p>Old Mr. Abercrombie, of Denver, with business at Lacey's in July, had
  spent an hour with Tommy. Evidently something pleasant had been said to Mr.
  Abercrombie about her, for when Tommy introduced him, he said:</p>

  <p>"If you're ever tired of New York, and want to live in a really good town,
  where the air is pure and the wages are right, wire me."</p>

  <p>"Maybe I'll do that, Mr. Abercrombie," she had said, accepting it as a
  gracious little courtesy.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Abercrombie had met several others of the department, and was
  about to leave, but had returned to her, saying, seriously:</p>

  <p>"I meant that, Miss Braithwaite.... We would like to have you at
  Abercrombie's.... Here's my card."</p>

  <p>By midnight, Joan had dismantled her room of everything that belonged to
  her, and was ready to be off, pending instructions. She called a taxi at
  midnight and went to the nearest Western Union branch on Broadway. After
  dispatching the night-letter to Denver, she returned to her room and
  slept&mdash;badly.</p>

  <p>At ten-thirty, next morning, there was a wire telling her to come at once.
  The telegram expressed delight. Joan was cheered.</p>

  <p>"Where shall we send your mail, Miss Braithwaite?" asked the mystified
  Mrs. Higgins.</p>

  <p>Joan hesitated, and impetuously resolved upon a bit of bridge-burning.</p>

  <p>"I'm not looking for any," she said.</p>

  <p>"Are you going far?" inquired Mrs. Higgins.</p>

  <p>"Very&mdash;and I shall not be back for a long time."</p>

  <p>The train left at noon. Joan, feeling like a fugitive, was glad when it
  was in motion. Once through the tunnel and out into the sunshine, she had a
  pleasant sensation of freedom from an accumulation of perplexities. She
  dallied long over her lunch. They had passed Poughkeepsie before she had
  finished.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The <i>Berengaria</i> docked at ten on Friday. Dinny, who
  had never asked himself whether he felt at home in New York, was glad to be
  back. England had done his mind a few small services. The passionate
  impatience with which he had viewed nearly all the traditional
  reliances&mdash;now that they were outgrown, outworn, and anachronistic in a
  new, mechanized era&mdash;had tempered considerably.</p>

  <p>There was an assuring solidarity in the massive grey stones of England,
  poise in the recumbent, armoured effigies that lay in single-file through the
  vaulted transepts of her quiet cathedrals, peace in her tranquil
  greensward.</p>

  <p>On the homeward voyage, with much time for thinking, Dinny had determined
  upon certain changes in his manner of living. He would take life a little
  more comfortably, for one thing. He would live less feverishly, as became a
  balanced mind. The thought of returning to his shabby little suite in the
  Village was distasteful. He would move uptown, equip his bachelor apartment
  with a few solid comforts, and make a less hectic and hurried thing of his
  life.</p>

  <p>Now that he was actually home again&mdash;his light baggage had been
  quickly inspected by customs&mdash;he was eager to carry out his resolution.
  He would proceed to it without delay. Joan would be happy to see him well out
  of the Village and its associations. How pleased she would be when he told
  her!... He had quite abandoned his novel. Joan would be gratified.</p>

  <p>The rooms were shabbier than ever. The few pieces of furniture that were
  his should be sent out for redressing. His mother's walnut desk had had no
  attention ever, for all that it had been knocked about from pillar to post
  for a quarter-century. Its legs were scratched and scored and its body bore
  many scars. He must not trust its rehabilitation to any but an expert in such
  matters.</p>

  <p>Why not get going on it at once? He called up Becker's, who dealt in
  antiques, and inquired for Mr. Becker himself; explained who he was, what he
  had, what he wanted. The elderly Becker, with an errand in the vicinity of
  Washington Square, said he would run in and have a look at the desk
  himself.</p>

  <p>Dinny was sorting over his books when old Becker arrived, having found it
  important to occupy his mind with such diversion as was to be had. He knew
  Joan did not like to be called to the telephone during business hours. It
  would be a long day.</p>

  <p>Old Becker was a thin, wiry, little man with a grey beard and pale blue
  myopic eyes that peered at you in an absurdly childish fashion.</p>

  <p>"Lofely!" murmured Becker, caressing the rich wood with an appreciative
  palm.</p>

  <p>"My grandfather made it a long time ago for my mother, when she was a
  young girl," explained Dinny. "The old fellow was quite handy with tools,
  I've been told; though, of course, the value of the desk is largely
  sentimental."</p>

  <p>Becker drew down the lid, almost reverently.</p>

  <p>"Handy mit tools!" he muttered, ironically. "Handy mit tools? Mein Gott! A
  greadt ardtist! Und you say&mdash;handy mit tools; hein?"</p>

  <p>He peered inside the desk.</p>

  <p>"Vas iss dat?... Mueller?... Mueller!" His pale little eyes searched
  Dinny. He poured out a torrent of queries. Where did this grandfather live?
  Was that his name&mdash;Mueller? Indiana? Gott in Himmel&mdash;no!... Where
  had he lived before that?</p>

  <p>Dinny said his grandfather had migrated from Dresden as a youngster.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;so!" Becker wagged his head and tugged at his straggling
  whiskers. "Der Muellers made no desks... but your grandvadder
  Mueller&mdash;he made a desk for his childt.... It iss very lofely!"</p>

  <p>So&mdash;Aunt Martha's occasional vague, proud references to the glory
  that was Mueller, back in "th' old country," had some substantial basis of
  fact. He had always thought the story an exaggeration&mdash;one of Aunt
  Martha's pipe-dreams.</p>

  <p>Old Becker was grinning mysteriously, and Dinny regarded him
  inquisitively.</p>

  <p>"Leedle secret, too; hein?" He significantly tapped the exquisitely
  crafted little pilaster between the centre pigeonholes with an understanding
  thumb.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't understand," said Dinny, stooping to inspect the
  pilaster critically. "Secret?"</p>

  <p>Becker's expression was a study. He had stumbled upon two secrets&mdash;a
  secret drawer&mdash;a mystified owner.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think so?" inquired Dinny.</p>

  <p>The old man was slow with his reply; looked Dinny up and down,
  searchingly, as if wanting to satisfy himself that his client was really
  entitled to know what an owner of such a treasure should have known.
  Apparently assured on that point, he explained that the central pigeon-holes
  were an inch wider apart than any of the others. Back of the ornamented
  pilaster there was a narrow drawer.</p>

  <p>Dinny was on the point of suggesting that they experiment, but on second
  thought decided to make the exploration alone. He quickly came to terms with
  Becker about the expense, and the old man left, saying: "Ve vill treadt it
  vell.... Mein Gott!... a <i>Mueller!"</i></p>

  <p>With the point of his knife-blade, Dinny endeavoured to loosen the
  pilaster and start the alleged secret drawer. The little pilaster was
  unbudgable. Doubtless something else had to be pushed, pulled, moved, before
  the drawer would open. He inquired of every nook and cranny for a suspicious
  knob, button, or unexplained gadget. The desk remained calmly innocent of any
  duplicity. He would have to fall back on old Becker, after all.</p>

  <p>Tommy Forsythe would hardly have gone out to luncheon by now. He wondered
  if they might not go together. Perhaps he might find Tommy free to do so. He
  called Lacey's and connected with Tommy's department.</p>

  <p>No&mdash;Mr. Forsythe was not in. Mr. Forsythe was out of town. Who was
  this&mdash;please? Oh&mdash;Mr. Brumm. Mr. Forsythe sailed for Europe on
  Wednesday. Yes&mdash;Wednesday noon.</p>

  <p>Dinny decided to risk asking for Joan, so long as he had the
  connection.</p>

  <p>"May I speak to Miss Braithwaite?"</p>

  <p>There was quite a little pause.</p>

  <p>"Miss Braithwaite isn't with us, any more, Mr. Brumm."</p>

  <p>"You mean she's not with Lacey's? Since when? Where's she gone?" Dinny
  tossed his prudence aside, and fired his questions as if he'd the right to
  ask them.</p>

  <p>"She's not been here since Tuesday&mdash;closing time. We do not know
  where she is."</p>

  <p>"That's strange!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir... Is that all, Mr. Brumm?"</p>

  <p>Dinny's hands trembled as he hunted for the telephone number of Mrs.
  Higgins. His voice was unsteady when he asked his questions.</p>

  <p>No&mdash;Miss Braithwaite wasn't there any more... Yes, she had taken all
  her things and left shortly before noon on Wednesday.... No&mdash;she hadn't
  said.... No&mdash;they positively did not know!... And who was this,
  talking?</p>

  <p>Dinny slammed the receiver back on the hook, and sat for a long time, lost
  in moody thought, wondering if it were really so. He brought both long hands
  down with a despairing slap on his knees, rose with a sigh, caught up his
  hat, went downstairs, and strolled down the street, hands deep in pockets,
  his mind in a tumult. He had lost Joan!... Damn Tommy Forsythe!... Damn
  Greenwich Village!... Damn <i>Hallelujah!...</i> To hell with Everything!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A RAGGED, rumpled, yellowed scrap of paper, solidly printed
  on both sides in nonpareil, fluttered to the floor.</p>

  <p>Dinny picked it up and held it between his fingers while he unfolded the
  bulky letter from which it had fallen. The fragment could wait. He laid it on
  the desk. It had taken him an hour, that night, to open the narrow little
  drawer faced with the miniature Corinthian pilaster.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon he had dragged the desk to the window and painstakingly
  inspected every square inch of its surface. Nothing had come of it. At nine
  he had laid aside his coat, emptied the desk of its meagre contents&mdash;for
  he almost never used it&mdash;and set about his task determined to see it
  through.</p>

  <p>The long, shallow drawer below the lid which, when let down, was the
  writing-table, he removed. This operation promised little, for the drawer was
  a full fifteen inches below the pilaster and clearly unrelated, but he had
  done everything else and had now arrived at the phase of his exploration
  where the incredibilities were being examined.</p>

  <p>Taking up this skilfully mortised drawer in his hands, Dinny scrutinized
  it, inch by inch. In the centre of the back panel there was a notch in the
  top, half an inch deep and three-eights of an inch wide. It excited his
  curiosity. Perhaps there was some small projection in the depths of the desk,
  at the rear of the aperture from which this drawer had come, something
  articulating with the unobtrusive little notch.</p>

  <p>Aware of his inability to thrust a well-muscled forearm into this shallow
  drawer-space, he inserted a walking-stick and probed about with the tip of it
  until he found a small, squared, wooden tongue. He pushed up on it gently. It
  instantly responded with a sharp metallic click that seemed to come from
  higher up in the region of the pigeon-holes. The quick, decisive tap,
  unquestionably the release of a spring, startled him; for upon having reached
  the path of discovery, Dinny's nerves had keyed to the sensitiveness of
  fiddle-strings.</p>

  <p>Lowering the hinged writing-table, which he had been supporting on his
  arm, he glanced toward the little pilaster. It was protruding about three
  inches. Attached to it was a narrow upright drawer. He drew it farther out.
  It contained a thick letter which all but filled its limited space.</p>

  <p>With rapidly beating heart, Dinny held it closer to the desk-lamp, for the
  writing on the sealed envelope was faded almost to illegibility, and read the
  words written in a sprawling feminine hand: "Confidential&mdash;to my
  child&mdash;from Julia Miller Craig." The letters were so large, and growing
  larger as the end of the sagging line was reached, that there had been no
  room on it for the "Craig," which was written below "Miller," almost as if it
  were an afterthought.</p>

  <p>Dinny drew up a chair to the desk, sat down, and, with a strange sensation
  of having stepped into the presence of a disembodied spirit, he carefully
  opened the brittle old envelope with his paper-knife. A ragged, crumpled
  fragment of paper fell out. He picked it up from the floor without regarding
  it closely. Doubtless the letter would explain.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to read even the first page on which his girl-mother had
  clearly spent the best of her waning energy. This fact she recognized at the
  outset. She was writing in bed; she was very ill; she would do her best. She
  was burning up with fever, and things were all "out of drawing."</p>

  <p>"God!" muttered Dinny.</p>

  <p>She had seemed rather remote&mdash;a mere sacred symbol&mdash;until he
  came upon that little phrase.</p>

  <p>Why&mdash;that was exactly the way he would have said it, himself! He and
  this girl, nearly ten years his junior, were not only of the same flesh and
  blood; they were mentally, temperamentally kin!</p>

  <p>For the first time in Dinny's life, his mother assumed definite reality.
  She came alive in this letter&mdash;in this single phrase&mdash;and spoke as
  clearly as if she were at his side. He had a curious feeling that he was not
  alone. He drew a quick breath, and slowly turned his head, glancing up over
  his left shoulder. Then, pulling himself together, resolutely, he returned to
  the letter. A wave of tenderness swept over Dinny; something other than a
  feeling of filial reverence; rather the sense of desire to lend her his
  strength, as if she were a young sister in dire need of his protection.</p>

  <p>Things were all "out of drawing" because she was so hot and weak.
  Yesterday she had been quite excitable from the fever, and had wandered a
  little. She would speak of that, later, if her strength held out, she
  said&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">I'm not out of my head now. In fact&mdash;my wits seem to
  be speeded up by the fever. Everything's so much brighter and louder. Father
  is working, out in his shop, and when he lays his chisel down on the bench, I
  can hear it drop, both ends of it, the wooden end and the iron part. Each
  leaf on the maple&mdash;I see the three through the window&mdash;is twins,
  after I have looked awhile. One of the twins is blue, the other yellow. At
  first, when I look out, each leaf is green. After I have looked hard, for a
  minute, the leaves are twins, like I said, one blue, one yellow. Then my eyes
  hurt, and I stop looking. At noon I heard the cracked school-bell over at
  Hinebaugh's. That's four miles. You can't hear it this far. That's how sick I
  am, and that's how this kind of sickness sharpens you till you're sharper
  than you want to be, and it hurts. You don't hear things with your ears, when
  you're this way, but with your eyes. Every tiny noise is big, and pounds in
  your eyes, deep behind them.<br>
  <br>
  So, if I say anything queer, you will know why, if you're old enough. But I'm
  not crazy, and I know what I'm doing. I hope you believe this, for I'm going
  to tell you something very important before I am through, if I can still hold
  my head up that long. It's pretty dizzy.</p><br>

  <p>"God!" muttered Dinny, half-sick.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">If I only knew how to talk to you, dear, it would be
  easier. I can't quite place you. You're not a baby. I know that. I'm never
  going to have a baby. One minute, you seem a boy about fourteen that looks
  ever so much like Zandy, and next minute you're a girl about my age, and look
  a little like me. I expect they will put me by mother, near the fence, close
  to where Zandy first told me. There will be some comfort in that&mdash;at
  least there is now.</p><br>

  <p>Dinny's eyes were smarting; his throat ached.... "God!&mdash;what a cruel
  thing for the dear little chap to endure!" He read on.</p>

  <p>The Dresden part of it was difficult to interpret. It demanded hours of
  study, later, and the utmost concentration, for Dinny to disentangle the
  crashed and telescoped detail of the jumbled memories. The narrative
  resembled nothing so much as a cycloned house, with the refrigerator
  upside-down on top of the piano, and a large, ragged chunk of identifiable
  dining-room plastering&mdash;wall-paper holding it together&mdash;in the
  kitchen-sink alongside a gift copy of Maeterlinck's <i>The Life of the
  Bee</i> and an old wreath of immortelles. The stuff was all there, but out of
  normal juxtaposition, by no means easily put to rights.</p>

  <p>But for the fact that Dinny had already been given reasons for respectful
  credence in the Mueller tradition, his mother's confused reference to Dresden
  would have been too fantastic. The things he most wanted to know about that
  were absent. The superficial detail was highly elaborated; the garden, the
  garden-wall, hollyhocks, the door in the wall and the wrought-iron hinges on
  the door, the grassy-banked river, the boats, and a punt with a red-and-blue
  canopy&mdash;but almost nothing about the life of the place.... The cushion
  on the window-seat in father's room was of rose velvet, but there was not a
  word about father's reason for running away from home to America or what had
  become of the people left behind.... There were lily-pads on the pool in the
  garden and goldfish under them.</p>

  <p>The part about his own father was in keeping with the lyrical quality of
  the Dresden story&mdash;a girlishly romantic reminiscence of tender things
  said and done. Dinny felt, at this point, that the letter had drifted
  slightly away from the original intention of confiding to a child, and had
  taken on the style of a personal journal quite too private for any other eyes
  than the writer's. He was reluctant to read certain parts of it.</p>

  <p>Dinny found it very difficult to reverse the career of the spread-eagle,
  dictatorial, dominant Zandy Craig, of the Craig Syndicate, and return him to
  the bewildered, gentle, downy fledgeling that had been the "dear, dear Zandy"
  of his mother's memoirs.... He would have given ten thousand dollars for the
  unpublished manuscript of "Greck."</p>

  <p>Perhaps he had misjudged his father. After all, Zandy&mdash;Dinny found
  himself thinking of this man as "Zandy"&mdash;had been but a youngster when
  it happened. If he had had it to do over again, five years later, he might
  have shown up better. There was no doubt Julia&mdash;Dinny was thinking of
  her as "Julia" now&mdash;loved him, trusted him. Surely that was worth
  something. You could mark that up to Zandy's credit.</p>

  <p>But&mdash;all the same&mdash;By God!&mdash;Craig had killed her! You had
  that to remember, too.... Well&mdash;we could think that
  over&mdash;later.</p>

  <p>Dinny turned to the next page, and continued. The writing was even less
  legible now. What with the cloudiness of the composition, and the almost
  indecipherable script, his mother's attempt at a discussion of an apparently
  bizarre theory she had arrived at, in her dishevelled mental condition, was
  not a thing to be read with full understanding.</p>

  <p>The curious metaphysics she seemed trying to express, phrased in whatever
  naïve terms a country school-teacher might catch up hastily in the exigency
  of her fatigue and fever, was still further enshadowed by the increasing
  uncertainty of the nervous pen. The faded letters were so ill-formed that a
  given character might be <i>h, n, u, r,</i> or <i>v,</i> with the adjacent
  vowel offering you your pick of <i>a, e,</i> or <i>o.</i></p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was nearly three o'clock before Dinny had reached the
  reference to the little scrap of crumpled paper which, in the stress of
  translating the letter, he had all but forgotten. He took it up, and read it
  now, but it seemed strangely irrelevant to the matters his mother was
  treating with such a valiant struggle to make herself understood.</p>

  <p>Dinny went back a few paragraphs, and re-read. Julia had written this at
  mighty cost. She deserved his best efforts to interpret it.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Long before this trouble came to me... don't feel badly,
  child, it wasn't your fault... I had been frightfully bitter about lots of
  things. I was lonesome, and didn't belong in this house. I had never been
  taught anything worth knowing. I didn't even know how to eat. If it hadn't
  been for the books I read about the habits and little courtesies of refined
  people, I would have known no more about how to do at the table than old
  Florrie.<br>
  <br>
  I got so I hated the sight of them. Father, poor old darling, I loved him
  with my pity, but that was about all. The girls&mdash;Martha never was a
  girl&mdash;were so silly and coarse and ignorant that I despised them with
  all my heart, hating myself for feeling better than they were. For I was not
  naturally conceited. I am shy and bashful, really. But I was always ashamed
  that I was related to Susan and Greta.<br>
  <br>
  I hated Martha. I got so I hated everything she said and did. Since I've been
  sick&mdash;up to yesterday... I'll tell you soon about that, dear... I
  couldn't bear even to have her touch me. The sound of her voice, down in the
  kitchen, made me want to get up and shout that she was nothing but a sour old
  simpleton, even when I couldn't hear a word of what she was
  saying&mdash;nothing but the nasty noise.<br>
  <br>
  I hated the boys. I think I had always hated them. They were dirty, inside
  and out. They were exactly the same as the rest of the loafers that sat along
  the porch at Baber's store, and got all quiet when you came, and, after you
  had passed, there would be a rough rumble of a dirty voice, and then they
  would all spit and laugh a dirty laugh. If you're a girl, maybe you'll know
  what I mean, though I hope not much. If you're a boy, and you ever laugh like
  that, I hope there'll be no chance for me to hear it wherever I'm going to.
  I'd rather die like a dog, and stay dead forever, than endure such shame.<br>
  <br>
  I don't know what's going to become of you, child, but I do hope you'll never
  have reason to hate things and people the way I have.<br>
  <br>
  Then&mdash;when this trouble came, and lately when it's seemed pretty
  doubtful&mdash;I got to hating the whole world until I was just as sick from
  that as this other trouble. It was just like a poison that was eating me,
  burning me on the inside. My hate hurt clear up in my throat. I hope you'll
  never know what that kind of hate feels like.</p><br>

  <p>"God!&mdash;don't I know?" muttered Dinny. "You poor little
  thing!"</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Well&mdash;yesterday a queer thing happened. Part of it was
  awful, and I hope you won't think less of me. Martha came and wanted to read
  the Bible to me, and I wouldn't let her. She put it under my pillow then, and
  went away. I was so angry at her and it that I tore it up. Maybe you'll be
  shocked. It was too bad, and I'm sorry. But I tore it up because it was full
  of what Martha called "precious promises"&mdash;and look what had happened to
  <i>me!</i> This was God's Book, and He had been mean to me. So I tore up His
  Book. I'm ashamed to tell you this, but it gave me a kind of terrible
  pleasure to do it&mdash;a kind of hot joy that I used to think the Devil had
  when I was a little girl and believed there was a Devil.... You don't believe
  there's a Devil do you, child? I'm thinking of you as a little girl, now,
  about the size I was when they used to frighten us at revival meetings. I
  hope you're not living with ignorant people who believe in hell and devils.
  Surely you've a right to a little better raising than that. I couldn't bear
  it if I knew you were that poor and degraded.<br>
  <br>
  I quit tearing at the Bible only when my hands were so tired I couldn't move
  a finger. Pretty soon I fell asleep. Father found the awful mess I had made
  and cleaned it up before anyone else saw. But there was a little piece left.
  The next time I was alone I read what it said, and it seemed so different,
  maybe because it was all there was left.<br>
  <br>
  It seemed to be intended for me. Maybe it won't mean just the same thing to
  you, because you're not all full of poison and hate and mean feelings toward
  almost everybody and everything, the way I was. At least I hope you're not,
  for it's dreadful and worse than any sickness. It really <i>is</i> a
  sickness!<br>
  <br>
  This little piece that I read wasn't like religion at all. I hated religion.
  You did something wrong, and had to go crawling on your hands and knees to be
  forgiven for it. You had to cry and beg and whine like a dog. But this wasn't
  like that. It wasn't anything to sniffle about the way they have to do in
  church when they are sorry for hating people who have wronged them. I always
  despised whiners. They said in church that God wanted you to whine, for He
  liked to hear sniffles from scared people. So I despised Him for that. He
  wasn't my sort.</p><br>

  <p>Dinny put down the letter, rubbed his tired eyes, and shook his head. His
  mother's reminiscences were his own. Again he felt that strange kinship
  between himself and this unhappy girl who had given him birth. Her blood
  coursed through his veins. Her queries were his. His criticisms were hers. It
  was in the blood-stream! His temperament was a biologic inevitability. You
  grew figs on fig-trees. You grew thorns on thistles. Didn't you?
  Well&mdash;there you are, then! Nothing to be done about it! Is there?</p>

  <p>Julia had despised whiners. God liked whiners. "The sacrifices of God are
  a broken spirit." God liked broken spirits; liked to hear 'em wail; liked to
  see 'em wring their hands, and pour ashes on themselves. That had been his
  own chief objection to the whole structure of traditional theology. He wanted
  to be a man. He wanted to stand upright and face the sun. God wanted him to
  grovel like a cowed animal. Dinny knew now how he'd come by his passionate
  aversion to such self-abasing, personality-destroying, soul-defiling
  ignorance! He wanted to reach across the Border and clasp the hand of this
  fearless, unfettered spirit. He was proud of his Julia. His eyes were wet
  with emotion.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">This little piece of religion that I had left, lying under
  my hand as if it was meant for me, doesn't whine at all. It doesn't ask you
  to whimper for mercy.<br>
  <br>
  It's just a business proposition same as if you owed a thousand dollars to
  Mr. Smith, and ten other people owed you a hundred dollars apiece, and Mr.
  Smith said, "Pay me that thousand dollars," and you said, "I can't&mdash;with
  all these people owing me."<br>
  <br>
  And Mr. Smith said, "I don't need the money so much, but I like you and want
  to be friends with you, and as long as you are owing me you'll be keeping
  away from me for fear I'll ask you for it and make you ashamed. And it won't
  do any good for me to tell you just to keep the money and forget it, because
  that would make you ashamed, too, and you would always feel in debt.
  So&mdash;I'll make you a proposition. If you will cancel all the debts of
  these people who owe you, and are afraid to face you, so that they can afford
  to cancel the debts of the people who owe them, I'll call it square with you.
  Then we can all be good neighbours again, and nobody will be afraid of anyone
  else, or shy, or ashamed."<br>
  <br>
  This all sounds so much more sensible to me, dear, than the way they talk
  about it at the meetings. It's just as if God wanted us to do business with
  Him about these things that have kept us strangers.<br>
  <br>
  Maybe this will sound silly to you, but I closed my eyes and said, down
  inside myself where there seemed a little spot that brightened up, "Please
  forget that I tore up Your Book, and help me to forget it too, for it makes
  me very sorry to remember." And God said, speaking from down inside of me,
  just as plainly as anything I ever heard, "Will you forgive your father for
  drinking up the opportunities you might have had, and Susan for refusing ever
  to come into your room on account of the desk, and the boys for being rude,
  and Martha for not wanting you to have any fun?"<br>
  <br>
  And I said, "Yes&mdash;I will."<br>
  <br>
  And then He said, "Will you forget everything they ever did that has made you
  disappointed and sorry&mdash;just as I'm going to forget everything you've
  done to disappoint and sadden Me?"<br>
  <br>
  And I said, "Yes&mdash;I will."<br>
  <br>
  Of course I can't expect you to understand the strange feeling that came over
  me, but it wasn't like anything else that ever happened. Please don't think
  I'm telling you something I dreamed. I was quite wide awake. The queer thing
  that happened was just as if some wonderful doctor who knew how to cure any
  disease instantly had given me a powerful medicine that cleared out all the
  poison! I felt all <u>clean</u> and <u>new!</u>... Then I found myself
  smiling, and I laughed. And&mdash;this was because I am so weak, I
  suppose&mdash;I cried a good deal; but not for being unhappy or afraid or
  ashamed. Maybe I can't explain this very well, but I felt proud, just as if I
  had been promoted or had won a great prize, or had discovered I was a
  princess or something!<br>
  <br>
  It's awfully hard to try to make this sound the way it actually was. For I
  don't know whether I'm talking to a little girl with a doll in her hand, or a
  big boy old enough to go to college, but this thing that I've got is a sort
  of <u>power!</u><br>
  <br>
  That's the best I can do to explain it. When you get it, you'll know. I want
  you to have it, for there's no other feeling like it. I believe that if I
  could get well, now, I could do almost anything!<br>
  <br>
  It's great to be able to talk to God, now, any time you want to, and say
  anything you like, and know that you're fast friends. It would be wonderful
  to get well, and see Zandy again; but if I don't, I'll see God exactly as He
  is; and I'm not afraid.<br>
  <br>
  I thought about it nearly all night&mdash;and kept talking to Him, and He
  would answer me. Please don't think I'm out of my head. I'm awfully tired.
  That's what makes the writing so bad. And I said I was dreadfully sorry I had
  misunderstood Him so, and he said, "Well&mdash;Hiram and Elmer misunderstand
  <u>you.</u> They think you consider yourself too nice to have anything to do
  with them. And Susan and Greta think the same thing, that you're above
  talking to them about their little troubles."<br>
  <br>
  This morning Susan came to the door and looked at me. She seemed so shy and
  scared, as if she had never seen me before, and I motioned to her to come in,
  and she sat down on the little chair by the bed. And it was just about as
  easy as it had been, last night, when God and I made up. I just reached out
  my hand and rubbed my fingers over Susan's face, softly. It was the first
  time I'd intentionally touched her for years, and we almost never had
  anything to say to each other, not for years and years. And Susan slipped
  down on her knees by the bed, and put her arms around me, and we both cried,
  but I was happy, and I loved Susan for the first time in my life.... Dear
  Child&mdash;the poison is all out of me now. Of course, I'm too sick of the
  other trouble to get well&mdash;but it doesn't really matter. I'm happy. I
  love the boys, too, and I'm going to let them know. And poor father&mdash;he
  does feel so badly about everything.</p><br>

  <p>Dinny put down the letter, and paced the room, unable to endure another
  line of it. Of course, poor Julia was labouring under intense emotion,
  terrific neural strain. A great deal of her experience could be charged to an
  hallucination easily explained. Naturally, the whole family would be wrought
  up. Susan would have been a beast to remain cold and aloof under the pitiful
  little tender of affection. Nobody was normal at the time....
  But&mdash;God!&mdash;suppose such relief and release were real! Suppose that
  for the mere act of unloading one's memory of all the bitter hatreds and
  cankered grudges, one might feel free to lift one's eyes and smile into the
  face of God&mdash;as dear Julia had&mdash;and be cleared of all the
  "poison!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly there came a definite surge of such painful wistfulness to lay
  hold upon some strength beyond his own as had never possessed him&mdash;not
  even for the instant when Angela's choir, bursting forth with an exultant
  "Unfold! Unfold!! Unfold!!!" had tugged at his soul&mdash;not even in that
  brief, boyish quest of The Mystery when he had sat in church with the Timmy
  Fagans.</p>

  <p>In those fleeting experiences Dinny had glimpsed the possibility, resident
  in him, for rapture and radiance. For these ecstatic instants, the Light had
  broken through, certifying to two facts: there was a Light, and he possessed
  the spiritual retina to see it. The shutter clicked&mdash;and for that one
  little split-second the Light poured in; but, afterwards, the darkness
  settled again.</p>

  <p>Maybe Julia had found the way to a permanent possession of that spiritual
  illumination which, rarely, he had sensed with a brief ecstasy that stirred
  him to the depths, and promptly left him cold.</p>

  <p>If Julia had found it, and in such high degree that she was undaunted even
  by the impending tragedy that stared into her girlish face, might he hope to
  capture that strange magic for himself? Why not? They were the same sort of
  people; weren't they? Julia and he were kin. Her queries were his queries.
  They had shared much the same dilemmas of frustration, disillusion,
  disappointment. They had shared the same hot hate of a world that had
  consistently let them down... . Julia had never "belonged," but, at last,
  <i>she had "belonged"!</i></p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Slumping down in his chair, taut with the emotional tension
  of the past half-dozen hours, Dinny covered his face with his outspread
  hands, and muttered, half aloud:</p>

  <p>"I'll give it a trial!... God!&mdash;I wonder if I'm losing my mind. ...
  I'm going to make the experiment, and see what comes of it."</p>

  <p>He reached for the crumpled scrap of paper, and sat staring at the
  well-remembered words which he had heard Uncle Miles read, monotonously,
  scores of times, words now highly charged with energy. He felt himself
  studying a formula in Physics. Again Dinny returned to his mood of deep
  meditation.</p>

  <p>God!&mdash;suppose the thing were real!... But, if it was real, why didn't
  more people know about it? If there was anything to it, surely the religious
  would have practised it. A man who possessed this dynamic joy that Julia had
  found&mdash;why, you could spot him at a thousand yards by the light in his
  eyes!</p>

  <p>That was the appalling obstacle in the way of Dinny's confident belief in
  the reality of the mysterious "lifting power" that had caught Julia up, and
  held her, in an hour of crisis.</p>

  <p>Would she have discovered it, at all, had she been well, mentally sound,
  physically fit? According to her own documented testimony, she was upset to
  the point of having to plead with her child for belief in her sanity. Was she
  any too sure of it, herself?</p>

  <p>Sane people had no capacity for permanently possessing this uncanny
  spiritual strength. They had brief experiences of ecstasy. He had had them.
  Doubtless everyone, according to his temperament, had felt these occasional
  tugs from Otherwhere. Perhaps every inquisitive person nourished the vague
  dream of making lasting connections with this strange energy of exultation.
  That's what the religious were out after. They wanted to "fix" their
  idealisms on the highly sensitized plate, and make them permanent...
  But&mdash;with what success?</p>

  <p>Dinny found himself recalling instance after instance, in the little
  churches he had known as a growing boy, when the activities of a congregation
  of alleged Christians seemed actually to interfere with the personal peace of
  the individuals thus brought together. Not only did their religion fail to
  illumine them: it quite definitely got in the way of their self-confessed
  aspirations.</p>

  <p>He remembered his own grinning, as a lad, over the celebrated rumpus that
  had rent Uncle Miles's little church at Zanesdale. Mrs. Bilger wanted the
  Sunday School chairs for the Eastern Star banquet on the same night that Lida
  Kronk had promised them to the Modern Woodmen of which her Claude was the
  Chief Axe-Swinger, or whatever it was. And before they had done with the
  acute phase of the battle, not only was the whole congregation lined up in
  two hostile camps, but the town itself was involved. Uncle Miles had raced
  frantically back and forth across No Man's Land, pleading for arbitration,
  meanwhile being himself potted from both sides. Even as a small boy in short
  pants, Dinny had considered the affair a howling farce.</p>

  <p>Now&mdash;in the light of what Julia said she had found, Dinny knew that
  the vulgar and noisy controversy over the church chairs hadn't been funny, at
  all. The whole matter had been tragic beyond the telling. Was it not just
  such small-minded jealousies and stupid little exhibitions of egotism
  brazenly flaunted by persons conspicuous in the business affairs of country
  and village churches that had made the general public laugh the whole
  institution to scorn? Surely, thought Dinny, he had done his bit toward
  making such <i>gaucheries</i> ridiculous. Conventional religion, in the
  custody of the typical church of his own acquaintance, was not merely banal,
  farcical, impotent. By Gad&mdash;that sort of thing was definitely blocking
  our evolution! It was shutting off even such fugitive glimpses of the Light
  as a man might find for himself if left to his own devices as an untaught
  pagan!</p>

  <p>Of course, reflected Dinny, here and there, even in the stifling
  antagonisms forever on display in Uncle Miles's little churches, a rare
  spirit contrived somehow to grow.</p>

  <p>There flashed across his mental screen the picture of "old man" Houk. They
  never referred to him in any other way: "old man" Houk, who kept the light
  hardware and notion store near their church on the edge of Fort Wayne. There
  was a peculiar light in the old fellow's eyes. There was the quality of
  thermo-dynamics in his smile. How good God was to him, "old man" Houk was
  always saying in that gentle voice of his. How "blest" he had been. And
  sometimes the people laughed a bit when they talked about "old man" Houk's
  gratitude, for if ever anybody had his nose to the grindstone with nothing
  tangible to show for it, Houk won the prize. The two girls had married early,
  one bringing a worthless husband home to live; the other had abandoned hers,
  returning with three small children. As for the boy, he was no end lazy,
  impudent, and always in trouble. But "old man" Houk had something!...
  However&mdash;he may not have been quite all there. Even Uncle Miles had said
  that the old chap had a loose screw.</p>

  <p>Now the question arose, in Dinny's mind; was "old man" Houk a bit unhooked
  mentally, or had he managed to "lay hold" on the energy that Julia had found?
  Were these occasional mystics inspired or demented?</p>

  <p>Pursuing his recollections of Uncle Miles's ugly little churches that
  seemed bent on nothing but trivial expedients to pay their insignificant
  bills, in the course of which silly endeavours&mdash;rummage sales, ice-cream
  socials, and shockingly dull home-talent plays&mdash;they generally stirred
  up fresh rows, Dinny's honesty forced him to concede that you really couldn't
  expect much fineness to develop in the weedy Zanesdales and Ungers, where
  there was nothing to think about but one's treadmill and the callosities worn
  thick and hard by one's ill-fitting harness. It wasn't quite fair to judge
  religion, as an institution, by what one observed of it in Zanesdale.</p>

  <p>But then&mdash;there was Magnolia! Magnolia had been the mecca for a
  religious cult whose constituency in that zone numbered well into six
  figures, a cult that regarded its neighbours with sour pity. Had not smug and
  pious little Magnolia excoriated and discharged the only Christ-like
  personality on her staff&mdash;the only man in the whole outfit who had had
  the valour to stand up and say that the Master he followed was an
  uncompromising apostle of peace?</p>

  <p>Dinny remembered how they all used to laugh over the perennial feud
  between the factions that backed Professor Strickler, who taught Hebrew, and
  Professor Munger, who taught Homiletics, each of whom had been trying for
  years to discredit the other in the opinion of the parsons over a region five
  hundred miles in diameter.</p>

  <p>But here, again, fairness demanded that Dinny take account of all the
  facts in the case. Magnolia, after all, was but a little tea-pot. You
  couldn't appraise religion at large by the disgusting envies that stood out
  awkwardly, like sore thumbs, interfering with everything the college and
  seminary aspired to do.</p>

  <p>Who were Professors Strickler and Munger&mdash;for all their unctuous
  mouthings and frock-coated pomposities&mdash;but grownup farmer lads,
  innocent of any experience whatsoever in an outer world of urbanity and
  culture? Dinny knew their story. Having graduated from the seminary, they had
  been fortunate enough to marry the daughters of well-to-do lay members of the
  Board. After a few years of inconspicuous paddling about in the mud and dust
  of small-town parishes, their fathers-in-law had engineered them into
  seminary chairs (rocking-chairs), where, between venomous thrusts at one
  another, they had taught the young fry what they ought to know about the Old
  Testament in the original, and the theory of preaching the gospel of peace
  and salvation. Admittedly, that was pretty bad; but you mustn't judge all
  institutionalized religion by the performances of fat and furtive little
  Stricklers or lean and malicious Mungers.</p>

  <p>No&mdash;to be decently fair, you had to look at The Thing higher up. But
  what results did you get from such investigation? What spirit had actuated
  the organization of the greater sects in Christendom? What ghost had haunted
  the passionate conclaves in which reformations, reappraisals, and
  re-evaluations had taken wing? Surely not the Holy Ghost! Which one of them
  had walked out of a Mother Church because it wanted a better chance to
  believe and exemplify the theory of whole-hearted forgiveness, tolerance,
  sympathy, and "second-mile-ish-ness," which had constituted the very solar
  plexus of the Galilean gospel? Stand 'em up in a long row and demand their
  reply to this question, and see what you get: "Do you believe in the
  celestial commerce whereby you, yourselves, come into the possession of
  permanent power and radiance, in exact proportion to your ability to condone
  and explain and forget other people's 'trespasses'?"</p>

  <p>And yet&mdash;here stood this Ancient Thing.... By Gad&mdash;everything
  else in the world, by comparison of age, reeked of fresh paint, green lumber,
  hot rivets, and perspiration. It had outlived every other institution on
  earth, despite the fact that its early death had been forecast by the
  wiseacres of each generation for nearly two millennia. A new day had come.
  The arm-wavers were saying that more had happened in the past twenty years
  than in the preceding five thousand. Radical changes were tearing down
  yesterday's customs, mores, laws, dogmas. Religion was on its last legs. But
  was it? Not so you could notice it. The Thing had as much vitality as
  ever.</p>

  <p>What, actually, did it stand for? You had to explain its enduring life
  somehow, didn't you? Had it arrived at this apparent guarantee of perpetuity
  by virtue of its high achievement in promoting the world's
  peace?&mdash;Nonsense. It had been a notorious fighter.... Had it offered
  notable service in encouraging scientific progress?&mdash;Ha! ha! Now you
  tell one!... Had Rome shown much inclination to walk a second mile? Had
  Calvinism presented the other cheek? Had Wesleyanism handed over its cloak
  when sued for its coat? Had the Anglicans agreed quickly with their
  adversaries, "whilst in the way with them?" ... Hosts of them were
  unquestionably excellent people, the majority wanting to improve themselves;
  occasional individuals, in all the cults and sects, contriving to "lay hold";
  but, considered as institutions&mdash;considered as An
  Institution&mdash;exactly what did it stand for? How, in the face of all the
  dismaying facts, had it earned its evident immortality?</p>

  <p>It had always done a bit of philanthropy, yes; but so had the
  "unredeemed," for that matter. Its sporadic efforts at charity were always
  being outranked in volume and administrative acumen by secular agencies. It
  had always pretended to educate, but was without caste in the opinion of
  high-powered schools. Sometimes the parsons made a great to-do about the
  imposing array of North American Universities, all of which had been founded
  by preachers, and backed by churches. Even so, at the beginning; but such of
  these institutions as had actually won high recognition had long since lost
  their original religious affiliation.</p>

  <p>In short&mdash;what was religion good for? What did the Ancient Thing
  stand for? What made it last? Dinny thought he knew. Organized religion stood
  for the people's <i>yearning!</i> It was a costly monument to the people's
  <i>wistfulness!</i> All the people, considered as individuals, felt
  occasional little clicks of the camera shutter: the Light poured in on them
  for an instant: they kept hoping to make these fleeting surges of ineffable
  luminosity permanent, good for all weathers!</p>

  <p>But, in the face of this testimony of religion&mdash;intolerant,
  irascible, pig-headed, hair-triggered&mdash;was it really worth the effort
  for a person so materialistic, so critical, so unsentimental as himself, to
  hope that he might find the spiritual dynamics which had come to the rescue
  of his disappointed and embittered girl-mother?</p>

  <p>Dinny looked at his watch. It was four o'clock. He had exhausted the last
  tag-end of his mental resources. Any further thought about these matters, in
  his present condition of fatigue, would be merely exasperating. He threw off
  his clothes, snapped out the light, and slept.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Street noises roused him at nine from a deep sleep, and he
  sat up dully trying to remember where he had left off. There was an odd
  sensation that the day promised to be eventful, though in what manner Dinny
  had no definite idea. The best he could make of it was a nervous tension of
  expectancy, anticipation, novelty, somewhat as he had felt when he awoke on
  the day he had sailed to England, and on the day Joan was to arrive.
  Something was going to happen.</p>

  <p>Tuning himself up with a cold shower and ten minutes of vigorous
  callisthenics, he dressed carefully and walked over to The Brevoort for
  breakfast. There were several important things he had planned yesterday to do
  today. He must go up to the <i>Hallelujah</i> office for a bit of conference,
  for one thing.</p>

  <p>On his homeward voyage, Dinny had looked forward to this new position with
  interest; hardly with pleasure, for it had been difficult to feel quite
  satisfied over it while haunted with the memory of the hurt look in Joan's
  eyes. And even now that she had run away, and didn't belong to him any more,
  and was probably pacing the deck of the <i>Vulcania,</i> at this very moment,
  fondly arm in arm with Tommy Forsythe, Dinny still sensed a feeling of unrest
  and dissatisfaction over the whole <i>Hallelujah</i> business, heartily
  wishing he had never gone in for it. Perhaps tomorrow would be soon enough to
  report there.</p>

  <p>He had planned also to go uptown and look at a few bachelor apartments
  somewhere in the west eighties, but there was really no hurry about it.</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;then&mdash;what <i>was</i> the important thing he had on his
  mind?&mdash;this something that had to be done without delay.</p>

  <p>Dinny never wearied of analysing his own mental processes. He had learned
  that it was no longer considered scientific to speak of one's "subconscious
  mind." The new Psychology said there wasn't any such thing. "Subconscious
  mind" was as obsolete as "Soul."</p>

  <p>But you could call it what you liked, or refuse to call it at all; the
  fact remained that two distinct mental processes could be carrying on at the
  same time in one individual's head. Dinny often marvelled at this queer
  phenomenon. Here he was, this morning, rumpling his hair with his fingers and
  trying to remember just what it was that so urgently demanded his attention,
  and, all the time he was wondering, his subconscious mind&mdash;which was
  mere nonsense, of course; for he didn't have a subconscious mind, there being
  no such organ now recognized by science&mdash;was quite certain that he would
  return promptly to his room and attempt an experiment based on Julia's
  letter.</p>

  <p>While he was drinking his second cup of coffee, Dinny rather reluctantly
  admitted to his subconscious mind&mdash;which he didn't have&mdash;that such
  had been his intention from the moment he had wakened, an hour ago, and that
  if it would just have the decent courtesy to wait until he had finished his
  breakfast, he would do as he had planned to do, anyhow, without benefit of
  such counsel. In these occasional interior conferences, Dinny's subconscious
  mind always seemed much older and more mature than the rest of him, which he
  was inclined to resent. There was something a bit too paternal and hortatory
  and all-wise in the advice offered from that quarter.</p>

  <p>This morning, the distinct identity of his two minds seemed more clearly
  defined than ever in his experience. Perhaps he had been thinking about that
  one matter, bringing both his conscious and subconscious minds to bear on it,
  until they had temporarily lost their capacity for integration, like the
  green leaves on Julia's maple tree that she had stared into twins&mdash;one
  blue, one yellow. It was almost as if he, himself, were facing a battle with
  a very mature and omniscient ghost who, normally benign and approximately
  acquiescent, had suddenly decided to say: "Yes&mdash;you will!... And I'll
  see to it that you do!"</p>

  <p>Dinny was determined, however, not to give in too promptly. On his way
  back to his rooms he decided not to take another look at the gripping letter
  until he had done at least one "Green Cheese" essay. He always tried to keep
  about three weeks ahead of the release date, and was now four days behind his
  schedule, due to indolence on shipboard.</p>

  <p>Taking every advantage of current and seasonal topics, Dinny's theme for
  this morning's composition would relate somehow to the national observance of
  Columbus Day. He had scribbled a few rough notes, yesterday; nothing of
  value, however. All he had was:</p>

  <p>"Lookit, Gramp!... They got the flags out again!... Some festival or
  other."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't mean anything, Luna. The Ku Klux have terrified them into
  buying flags. They're flying almost every day now. Hadn't you noticed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but the Knights of Columbus have run one up on their
  buildings."</p>

  <p>"Humph!&mdash;it must be something else, then. What happened on October
  twelfth, Luna? You wouldn't be likely to know, would you?"</p>

  <p>Dinny typed this much, and, thrusting his hands deep in his coat pockets,
  appraised it with a critical eye. What was the good of it? Many people would
  grin, no doubt. Some of them would be sore. All of them would again be made
  aware of the widening rift between the "One Hundred Per Cent Americans" and
  the field, embracing other pigments, other creeds, other nativities, than the
  increasing organization of sheeted patriots who had bought their right to
  hate their neighbours for Ten Dollars and the price of a white cotton
  disguise.</p>

  <p>He drew the paper out of the machine, and crumpled it in his fist. Why not
  try to do the thing constructively once. Surely the readers of his "Green
  Cheese" column would forgive him a wee digression from his habitual spoofing,
  scoffing cynicism. They might even enjoy just a touch of sincerity; not too
  sentimental, of course: that would spoil everything.</p>

  <p>Why not try it? It would be in line with the experiment he hoped he was
  going to make, wouldn't it?</p>

  <p>Dinny inserted a fresh page into the typewriter, and wrote the opening
  phrase which always distinguished his feature article. "Lookit, Gramp!"</p>

  <p>And then he sat for full five minutes, absently toying with the keys,
  utterly unable to proceed.</p>

  <p>But&mdash;I can't do anything like this, reflected Dinny. If there's any
  substantial fact in what Julia says, there are a few things you have to do
  first before you can take an affirmative position. You've got to "un-bitter"
  yourself. He grinned, rather foolishly.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mr. Smith," he soliloquized, half aloud, "we'll say I've owed
  you a lot of money; and Zandy Craig, and gloomy old Aunt Martha, and the
  Reverend Miles Brumm, and Spike Davis, and Major Clemens, M.D., and Barney
  Vaughn, and Orville Kling, and&mdash;and Tommy Forsythe&mdash;owe me. And
  you're prepared to call it square, and sweeten me up, if I stop despising
  these other people.... All right, sir, I'll take you up!" Dinny made a
  sweeping gesture of dismissal to the imaginary company of his enemies.</p>

  <p>"I'll forgive the outfit at one swoop. Or, if you'd rather, I'll forgive
  'em one at a time. Here they go. I'll forgive Uncle Miles, first&mdash;the
  damned old embezzler."</p>

  <p>Suddenly the sardonic grin left Dinny's face, and a wave of self-disgust
  swept him. What a cad!&mdash;to let his chronic cynicism defile a situation
  that had been brought about by a farewell message from the dear girl who had
  died to give him his life! There would be no more of this vulgar sacrilege,
  he could promise himself that much. He would give up all attempts to do the
  impossible thing, of course. It was not for people of his type. He had
  carried his load of aversions too long. It had grown fast to him. But, at
  least, he could honour Julia's faith by refusing to make a travesty of
  it!</p>

  <p>That much settled, then, Dinny lighted his pipe, and drew up to his
  machine, quite confident that he had shaken off this strange temporary
  psychosis that had been playing the devil with his thoughts. The page wasn't
  quite straight, and he made himself a great deal of bother adjusting it. The
  machine needed a drop of oil, and it took quite a while to find it. The
  ventilation in the room wasn't very good, and he opened both windows. Having
  sat down again, ready now to go at his task in earnest, he felt a draught and
  got up to close one window partly. His coat cramped him, and he took it
  off.</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;from far in the depths of himself, where his subconscious
  mind might have been, had he had one&mdash;there welled up a solid,
  substantial, mature thought, as definite as if it were actually phrased in a
  spoken command: "You may as well proceed with the thing you are going to do.
  You're wasting your time. You've lost your knack at Green Cheese. There'll
  never be any more; not from you. You've gone into this liberty-quest too far
  to back up! Admit you're beaten&mdash;and see what you can make of the other
  thing."</p>

  <p>Dinny rose, with a sigh, went to his mother's desk, and sat for a
  half-hour with his elbows on the writing-table, his head in his hands.</p>

  <p>Rousing, at length, with an air of determination, he went to the
  telephone, called a familiar number, and was almost startled by what he found
  himself saying.</p>

  <p><i>"Hallelujah?...</i> Mr. Brumm speaking.... Is Johnny Keaton there?...
  Please.... Johnny?... Dinny Brumm.... Very good. How are you?... I'd rather
  expected to be in, today, but I've just had word that I'm required to make a
  business trip West. May be all of a couple o' weeks. Wish you'd carry on
  without any co-operation from me until you hear from me.... That's fine....
  And Johnny&mdash;how would you like to do my Green Cheese stuff for a while.
  You can, you know. Better than I.... If you like it, and can get away with it
  so everybody's satisfied, it'll be a nice thing for you. I'm tired of it. And
  I may have to do quite a little travelling for a few weeks. Might even have
  to go to Europe. You take over all the editorial responsibility up there
  until you see me again.... No&mdash;this is something sudden; more or less
  personal business; emergency stuff.... Thanks, Johnny. I'll write you more in
  detail.... Yes&mdash;tonight; if I can get a reservation. Just now learned
  that I had to go.... Good-bye."</p>

  <p>Dinny turned to his clothes-closet, reached to a high shelf and threw down
  the bags he had put away yesterday.</p>

  <p>"There may be nothing in it," he muttered, as he began peeling his clothes
  off their hangers and tossing them on to the bed, "but I'm going to give it
  an honest work-out.... God!&mdash;if the thing should be true!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I'M a-goin' out that way myself soon as this here
  gol-darned loafer changes my oil," volunteered the middle-aged farmer, who
  had taken his foot off the hub and sidled up to help answer the query about
  transportation to Oak Grove. "Yuh c'n come along, if yuh don't object t'
  ridin' with a hawg."</p>

  <p>"Bet you'd raise hell if anybody else called yuh thet, Jase," drawled a
  voice that apparently belonged to the pair of legs protruding from beneath
  the truck's engine.</p>

  <p>Jase spat, nonchalantly, grinned, and rubbed a stubbly chin; then winked
  companionably.</p>

  <p>"If yuh ever wants t' take one o' them slow movin' pitchers," he advised,
  elaborating a confidential air, "yuh can't do better 'n t' come t' Larwill.
  These here fellers in Lije Hinebaugh's garage has been a-practisin' till
  they's purty good."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for the offer of a lift. I'm wanting to go out and see my Uncle
  Miles Brumm. That's my name, too&mdash;Brumm."</p>

  <p>The obliging farmer left off his bantering attitude, stared hard from
  under his shaggy brows, and rubbed his palm on his blue denim pant-leg before
  presenting it.</p>

  <p>"Yer Julia's boy, mebby?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Did you know her?"</p>

  <p>"Reckon I did. My name's Schrofe. We was neighbours like. She taught our
  school fer a winter&mdash;er a part of it. You ain't never been out here
  afore?"</p>

  <p>"Once," said Dinny, shoving his bags out of the way, as the legs began to
  wriggle out from under the engine, followed by a large pan of spent oil. "I
  was about seven. Aunt Greta was being married. We were here only for a day.
  How long have my Uncle Miles and Aunt Martha lived up here? I'm afraid I had
  almost lost track of them, for a while."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it's about two years, come Christmas. I've owned th' little
  place fer quite a spell. Angela writ a-askin' could her folks come back 'n'
  live there. 'Pears like th' ol' man 'd had a stroke, er somethin'."</p>

  <p>"How's he now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;he gits about."</p>

  <p>"And Aunt Martha?"</p>

  <p>"She's well as common. Makes a little garden, 'n' that. Chickens, 'n'
  that.... Yuh ain't seen 'em lately?"</p>

  <p>Dinny shook his head, waiving the opportunity to explain.</p>

  <p>"Guess we c'n go now," said Jase, pulling out a fat roll of soiled money.
  "Here's yer filthy lucre, Lije. I'll be gol-darned if that ain't what it is.
  Time a dollar bill's made a dozen trips t' one these here little
  garages&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We don't have no trouble a-gettin' people t' take 'em," drawled Lije.
  "Better have an understandin' with this feller, Mr. Brumm, afore yuh start
  north, er he'll charge yuh th' price of his dang truck fer th' ride."</p>

  <p>"Any time I'd take a dime offen Julia Miller's boy&mdash;" said Jase,
  soberly. "Climb in, won't yuh, and we'll go down t' th' express office fer
  that Berkshire shoat. Bought 'er last week over at th' fair in Wayne. Wasn't
  fixed t' take 'er home with me. Had th' family along&mdash;pap 'n' th' girls.
  Ain't got none o' my own. I'm a old batch."</p>

  <p>They were rattling down the dusty street toward the railroad station,
  Jason waving a hand to the hicks idling in front of the implement store.</p>

  <p>"I s'pose yer married, this good while, eh?" he shouted.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Dinny, adding, "The only girl I wanted wouldn't have
  me."</p>

  <p>Jason made a careful job of backing the truck up to the station platform,
  turned off his engine, and climbed down.</p>

  <p>"Same as me," he said, grinning mysteriously. "The gal was yer maw."</p>

  <p>There was a little surge of resentment in Dinny's mind over the impudence
  of this untutored old yokel. He didn't like the idea of Julia's having been
  admired to this extent by a person so far beneath her. What right did this
  fellow have to cherish the memory of Julia?</p>

  <p>The rough wooden crate scraped into the truck with a screech accompanied
  by the pig's shrill squeal of alarm. Jason climbed up, started the rackety
  engine, which added to the pig's consternation, and they rumbled through the
  village, and out upon the highway, driving at a snail's pace.</p>

  <p>"This damn pig cost four hundred and twenty-five dollars," explained
  Jason, "'n' she's got t' be handled with care. I spect yer quite anxious fer
  t' git up there, too, seein' it's been so long since yuh heared from
  'em."</p>

  <p>"I hadn't supposed pigs were so expensive," commented Dinny, hoping to
  distract attention from his obvious lack of knowledge about his relatives.
  "How much is pork worth now?" He tried to make the query sound as if he had
  at least a passing interest in such matters.</p>

  <p>Jason guffawed loudly.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;pork ain't a-bringin' much, just now; but this here shoat
  ain't pork, 'n' when she has pigs, 'bout a year f'm now, they ain't a-goin'
  t' be pork, neither. I got a Berkshire boar over t' our place that I'd like
  fer t' show yuh. By Golly&mdash;nobody's ever called that feller pork.
  Say&mdash;if yuh was t' slit that there big boy's belly up intuh bacon, I
  guess it 'd cost yuh 'bout fifty dollars a slice. It's easy fer t' see yuh
  ain't no farmer."</p>

  <p>Dinny listened with a pretence of interest, but conscious of an
  uncomfortable irritation over the fact that his Julia, once upon a time, had
  been the object of this crude old chap's attentions. Somehow it pushed Julia
  farther away from him, even if she had been unaware of this devotion. This
  pig-fancier had unwittingly thrust his rough, unrefined bulk between him and
  the idealistic image of his mother.</p>

  <p>"I've saw pieces o' yourn in th' papers," Jason went on, grinning broadly.
  "Seen 'em in <i>Th' Tribune,</i> when I've went t' Chicago. Our papers 'round
  here don't seem t' take t' 'em like. I brung a couple o' 'em home once f'm
  Chicago, 'n' I thought pap 'd laugh hisself t' death. Pap says, 'Gol-darned
  if that ol' feller in th' moon ain't about right.' I mind one time yuh writ a
  piece 'bout them flossy automobiles a-splashin' mud on people 'long th'
  sidewalk when there wasn't nothin' in th' car but a poodle dog a-ridin' by
  hisself in th' back seat. Yuh oughta heared pap holler 'n' laugh. He likes 't
  when yuh git 't on 'em, 'specially th' tony folks. Pap's always a-braggin'
  'bout yuh, 'cause yer Julia's boy, 'n' he set such store by her. He says,
  'Gol-darned if Julia's boy ain't a sharp feller that they's got t' leave
  alone, fer he's got a mean tongue, 'n' enough pizen in him t' start a bran'
  new hell.'"</p>

  <p>"Was that what he said&mdash;'poison'?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah... 'Course pap was only a-foolin'. He likes yer pieces. Pap didn't
  mean 't harmful. It was just a joke, 'n' that."</p>

  <p>"It's no joke with me, Mr. Schrofe." Dinny was surprised to find himself
  saying this. He had blurted it out, impulsively. Now he would have to
  explain, best he could. "Your father's quite right. And he meant what he said
  as a friendly joke. I know that. But&mdash;there's been too much poison in
  me, and it's not good for me. I don't mind telling you that I'm taking a
  little treatment for it."</p>

  <p>"Pills&mdash;'n' that?" inquired Jason, interestedly.</p>

  <p>"The equivalent of pills&mdash;yes. I'm going to look up a few of the
  people I've had occasion to despise, and see if I can't come to terms with
  them. Perhaps that will do the trick. Just confidentially&mdash;I haven't
  seen my uncle and aunt for many years; not since I started away to
  college."</p>

  <p>"Forget 'em&mdash;mebby?"</p>

  <p>No&mdash;Dinny hadn't exactly forgotten them. It was not easy to explain,
  but he had gone away to school, and then the war had come along, and then he
  had gone East, and always his time and mind had been occupied.</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I reckon," agreed Jason, indulgently. "But I bet there's more
  to 't than that. We always thought Preacher Brumm was a kind o' slippery ol'
  cuss. Mebby he done somethin'. As fer Martha, she prob'ly wouldn't a-done
  nothin', a-bein' what she is, so pious 'n' that."</p>

  <p>"I thought it would be good for me to see them again."</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;that's proper&mdash;'n' let bygones be bygones, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;that's proper like, if yuh can do 't. Pap's always a-sayin',
  'Fergive 'n' fergit, 'n' like th' ol' Indian says, "Always remember!"'"</p>

  <p>Dinny indulged in the first hearty, spontaneous laugh he had had for
  several days.</p>

  <p>"That's the only brand of forgiveness I've ever carried in stock, I'm
  afraid."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;there's only just one feller in th' world I ain't never
  a-goin' t' feel right about, I guess. They's lots o' people what I don't care
  fer, not special, but this here feller I hate. I ain't never got over 't.
  Long time ago, come winter, 'n' nothin' much t' do, nights, but set 'n'
  think, I used fer t' do a little plannin' how I c'd go out West where he
  lived, 'n' stick a knife in him."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose I could guess his name," ventured Dinny, half-suspecting
  Jason would not be averse to a confidential chat on the subject.</p>

  <p>"Reckon yuh could. That's th' feller, all right. He prob'ly never done
  nothin' fer t' help yuh. Gol-darned selfish brute! By Golly&mdash;I'd like t'
  kill him!"</p>

  <p>"It's been a sore spot with me, too, Mr. Schrofe, though I think it's only
  fair to say that he made an honest effort to show an interest in me. I
  suppose it was my own fault that his generosity was unrewarded. I didn't care
  to take anything from him. However&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By Golly&mdash;I honour yuh fer 't. So'll pap." Jason idled the truck to
  a stop on the grassy roadside, and pointed across the highway to a
  barbed-wire gate fronting the dense woods. "Mebby yuh'd like t' see th' ol'
  path. Let's git out, 'n' I'll show yuh."</p>

  <p>They ambled across the road, and Jason hooked an elbow over the top rail
  of the gate.</p>

  <p>"Julia used fer t' leave th' road, right here, 'n' take that there path
  through th' timber, when she was a-teachin' th' Schrofe school. It used fer
  t' b'long t' ol' Squire Craig, damned ol' hawg." Jason drew a bunch of keys
  from his pocket and unlocked the gate.</p>

  <p>"Apparently it belongs to you now," observed Dinny, as they entered the
  woods.</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I bought 't. Didn't rightly have no use fer 't, er nothin',
  but ol' Craig was purty hard up afore he died, 'n' was willin' t' sell."</p>

  <p>Jason stooped and picked up a dead branch that had fallen across the
  almost obliterated trail.</p>

  <p>"Right along here she come, ev'ry day."</p>

  <p>Dinny felt sobered in the chilly shade. Hardly conscious of his act, he
  removed his hat. His resentment over Jason's attitude toward Julia was quite
  gone now.</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;yer Julia's boy, all right," muttered Jason, candidly studying
  Dinny's face. "That there little point where yer hair sort o' grows down
  like, right in th' middle."</p>

  <p>"You have asked me several personal questions today, Mr. Schrofe," said
  Dinny, seating himself by Jason on a fallen log beside the grassy path.
  "Would you object to my asking you one?"</p>

  <p>Jason's eyes crinkled with understanding.</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I guess that's the reason I bought 't. That's what yuh was
  a-goin' t' ask, eh? I kep' 't secret from pap fer awhile. But when he found
  out I'd bought 't, he said, 'Glad yuh done 't, Jase. No use fer ev'ry Tom,
  Dick 'n' Harry to be a-trampin' through them woods.'"</p>

  <p>Dinny impulsively laid a hand on Jason's knee.</p>

  <p>"Julia would have appreciated it, I know," he said, a bit unsteadily.
  There recurred to him certain fragments of adroitly crafted ridicule he had
  hurled at the insensitiveness and general stupidity of the hicks and yokels
  who composed so large a percentage of America's population. What could you
  expect, he had often queried, of people who never went anywhere, never saw
  anything, never read anything? What did a ballot amount to in their hands?
  What did they know about the type of government that speeds the spread of
  culture?</p>

  <p>Here was a hick, sitting beside him on this log. He talked like a hick,
  dressed like a hick, and was on the way back from a hick town with a pig in a
  crate. The hick was just now in the act of rummaging in his overall pockets,
  with clumsy fingers. His big brown thumb had a purplish-black discoloration
  at the root of the nail. Now he was bringing up in one hand a huge jack-knife
  and in the other a soggy plug of chewing tobacco. Typical hick!
  Cow-companion! Pig-comrade!... But he had bought a twenty-acre tract of
  second-growth timber that he didn't need or want, because there was the faint
  trail of a path through it that a neighbour girl had travelled on the way to
  her school, more than a quarter-century ago... Ignorant hicks! Country full
  of them! And what could you expect&mdash;Dinny had often inquired,
  superiorly, in the smart journals of sophistication&mdash;of a civilization
  so loaded down with dull dolts who spent their lives wading about through the
  ooze of the barnyard?</p>

  <p>"Want a chew?" inquired Jason, hospitably.</p>

  <p>"I've never been quite brave enough to do that," grinned Dinny. "I'll
  smoke a cigarette. Would you like one?" He tendered his gold-lined,
  monogrammed, silver case.</p>

  <p>Jason chuckled quietly and shook his head.</p>

  <p>The unexplained chuckle was just a bit disquieting. Dinny had long been of
  the opinion that yokels possessed no sense of humour, at all. Evidently this
  one had what passed for that, though it was odd what things amused him.</p>

  <p>"I want to tell you a secret," said Dinny.</p>

  <p>For ten minutes, he reviewed the peculiar circumstances which had
  concealed Julia's letter from him, until now. Jason's eyes interestedly
  followed Dinny's long, slim, well-kept hands as they brought out the leather
  wallet containing the precious legacy. He took the letter, rather timidly,
  and turned it over and over in his calloused palms, before handing it
  back.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to read you some of it&mdash;all of it, if you wish. I believe
  Julia would want me to."</p>

  <p>"I'd like fer t' hear 't," replied Jason, huskily. "That is," he added,
  admonishingly, "if yuh don't think she'd mind&mdash;my knowin'. We was never
  close like, yuh unnerstand. It wasn't her, yuh unnerstand. It was just me.
  Julia never knowed, not proper like, 'bout my feelin's 'n' that."</p>

  <p>Dinny nodded, comprehendingly... Hicks and yokels couldn't be taught good
  taste, he had said, in the ultra-refined pages of <i>Hallelujah.</i> All
  these silly attempts to add anything to their culture were wasted time. You
  only made them restless, self-conscious, and ridiculous. They didn't have the
  <i>savoir-faire!</i></p>

  <p>"I know Julia would want you to share this secret, Mr. Schrofe,"
  reiterated Dinny, impressively. "Some of it I found just a bit difficult to
  understand&mdash;but you're the kind of a person to see through it... Much
  more clearly," he added, "than I."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">An hour had passed. They had been dimly conscious of dinner-
  bells. Through the latter part of Dinny's reading, Jason had made no further
  effort to conceal his emotion, trumpeting into his voluminous red bandanna
  with an abandon of restraint. It was as if Julia's tragedy had occurred only
  yesterday.</p>

  <p>"I s'pose there must 'a' been somethin' to 't, like she says," he
  remarked, thickly, as Dinny folded the letter. "She c'd forgive 'em all, and
  get th' power like, 'n' that. But Julia wasn't just ordinary folks. You 'n'
  me, we couldn't. 'Tain't in us. Leastwise&mdash;'tain't in me. D'yuh think
  yuh c'd do 't?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Dinny, soberly. "That's what I'm trying to find
  out."</p>

  <p>The wrinkles around Jason's eyes deepened as he candidly studied Dinny's
  face.</p>

  <p>"Not meanin' any offence," he ventured, "but I sure w'd never 'a' picked
  yuh fer th' part. Yuh don't 'pear t' be th' kind o' feller that c'd make a go
  of 't." He rubbed his knee and grinned, broadly, hinting that a new idea had
  struck him amusingly. "Say&mdash;if yuh do get this here big power t' be free
  'n' happy like, yuh'll sure have a hell of a time writin' them sassy pieces,
  won't yuh?"</p>

  <p>Dinny stared, amazed at the old chap's quick deduction.</p>

  <p>"You've touched a mighty live wire. I'll tell you something about that.
  It's a queer story."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't think that's s' gol-darned queer," decided Jason, after
  Dinny had spent some time explaining how, since finding Julia's letter, he
  had been unable to get himself into the mood for composition of "sassy
  pieces."... "Yer handlin' dynamite, by Golly! Julia said 't was a sort o'
  power, 'n' yuh c'd always count on what she spoke. She's put this stuff in
  yer hands, 'n' told yuh how t' shoot 't off. Gol-darned if yuh hadn't better
  do 't th' way she says."</p>

  <p>"You're joking. It's serious with me. I've ruined myself for my work. I've
  lost a taste for the only thing I know how to do."</p>

  <p>"Like hell I'm a-jokin'!" protested Jason. "It's just like I said. Julia
  has handed yuh some high explosive! Yuh c'n either blow stumps with 't, 'n'
  clear yer ground so yuh c'n raise somethin'&mdash;er yuh c'n leave 't a-lyin'
  around, and take th' risk o' a-blowin' yer brains out... Ain't there nothin'
  else yuh c'n do b'sides make snoots at people in the papers 'n' that?"</p>

  <p>This last was too much for Dinny, and he laughed, Jason joining,
  apparently well pleased that he had lifted his young friend from his gloomy
  mood.</p>

  <p>"I learned to handle a chisel, a little, when I was a lad," said Dinny,
  reminiscently. "I think I could make a living."</p>

  <p>"'Pears like th' more sensible thing t' do is t' carry on, now yuh've
  started out t' experiment with Julia's idear. Mebby, if yuh git that there
  power, what she talks about, yuh c'n write anything yer a-mind t'."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've a long way to go."</p>

  <p>"I know I couldn't do 't. That there one feller'd always be in th' road.
  I'd fergive 'n' that&mdash;but I wouldn't stop a-thinkin'. What he done t'
  our little white stone, what pap 'n' me put up&mdash;I'd never fergit that,
  not in a thousand years."</p>

  <p>"What was that?" asked Dinny, sympathetically.</p>

  <p>Jason busied himself for some time, breaking a handful of dead twigs into
  little pieces of equal length. "'Twouldn't do yuh no good t' know 't. Yuh got
  a big job afore yuh, anyways. 'Twouldn't help yuh none&mdash;yer
  knowin'."</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;if you'd rather not tell me."</p>

  <p>"Julia's name really was Mueller, after all," soliloquized Jason. "We
  thought they'd made a mistake on th' big stone what he had made fer her. But
  this here letter looks as if he was right. We always thought 'twas Miller...
  Well&mdash;sh'll we go now?"</p>

  <p>Jason had leaned forward to turn the ignition key, after they had boarded
  the truck, but, apparently impressed with a fresh idea, straightened to offer
  a further comment on Dinny's problem.</p>

  <p>"Just now come t' me&mdash;somethin' mebby yuh hadn't thought about much.
  If yuh did grab on t' this here power o' Julia's t' be steady 'n' happy like,
  'n' begun a-writin' afterwards, yuh c'd write about that! By Golly&mdash;I
  bet lots o' folks 'd read 't. Gol-darned if they wouldn't eat th' paper 'twas
  writ on, a-thinkin' 'twas medicine. 'Course&mdash;if yuh'd been a parson,
  always a-snifflin' 'bout fergiveness, 'n' that, 'n' a-gettin' paid fer bein'
  friendly with God like, that'd be differ'nt. Th' people'd all say,
  'Aw&mdash;hell!'&mdash;'n' turn over t' th' funnies... But if ever a feller
  like yerself took t' a-writin' that he'd rech up 'n' got some power f'm on
  high what had cleaned out all his pizen 'n' made him happy 'n' that, fer
  keeps, by Golly, there'd be a million folks a-wantin' th' recipe fer 't!"</p>

  <p>Jason felt satisfied with this long speech, finishing it with vigorous
  nods of his head and convincing smacks of his brown fist on the
  steering-wheel. He drove the truck back on to the road, and began making up
  for lost time without concern for the comfort of the indulged shoat. Dinny
  was thinking. The old fellow might be a hick, but he possessed extraordinary
  native sense.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes, they had turned to the right, and were nearing the
  little white Baptist Church. Jason pointed it out, as they approached, but
  did not slacken speed, nor did he turn his head as they passed it and the
  quiet cemetery that lay to the rear. Dinny suspected that the treasured path
  through the woods had come to be the hallowed ground in Jason's opinion,
  rather than the grave where, apparently, some misunderstanding about a
  monument had seriously embittered him.</p>

  <p>"Not very fer now," he shouted. "Just b'yond that there little holler. Yuh
  c'n see th' chimbly. There's yer Aunt Martha, a-pickin' up them winter
  pears... Well&mdash;I'll set yuh down. Wish yuh c'd come over 'n' see pap,
  whilst yer here. I c'd come 'n' fetch yuh."</p>

  <p>"I think I would like to," said Dinny, gratefully. "Could you come over in
  the morning? I want to see your father."</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha was shading her eyes with both hands, her inquisitive grimace
  distorting her face into an expression of naïve perplexity. The vanished
  years spun like a top. Dinny felt eight, as he lifted his bags down, and
  started toward the house. Uncle Miles, shaggy, seedy, and minus the short
  burn-sides of yesterday, appeared in the doorway. He had drawn the
  well-remembered, benevolently patronizing smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, well!" boomed Uncle Miles.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Would yuh care fer another piece, Ferdinand?" Aunt Martha
  was saying primly.</p>

  <p>"By all means, Ferdinand," heartily seconded Uncle Miles, taking up
  Dinny's purple-stained pie-plate. "Abso<i>lute</i>ly!"</p>

  <p>It had been amazing to Dinny with what ease and dispatch he had fitted
  back into the environment he thought he had outgrown.</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha was a little greyer, and laid her thin hand on the backs of
  the familiar chairs as she moved about. There were nice new teeth, but she
  still shielded with the corner of her lip the area where once there had been
  a missing right upper canine. One of Uncle Miles's legs was not quite so up
  and coming as the other. The shoulders sagged, the least bit, making the
  shiny black coat a size too large. Otherwise, they were the same people;
  mellower, perhaps; a little more subdued.</p>

  <p>Dinny had feared a painful constraint. As he had neared the house, bags in
  hand, his heart had pounded. For the moment he would have given much to
  efface himself from this awkward reunion. But there had been no dilemma.
  Uncle Miles was as openly cordial as if he were welcoming home a son in whom
  he had invested his all. Aunt Martha murmured little tendernesses as she
  nervously clutched at his sleeves.</p>

  <p>He had lied effortlessly when they inquired whether he had had his dinner,
  and responded with enthusiasm when they wanted to show him "th' place." He
  was shown the chicken-coops, the barn, the little shop that had been his
  grandfather's. Dinny lingered there for a time. It was long since it had been
  in use, but it smelt of good, sound wood in process of fabrication, as if
  fuddled old Ferd had just stepped out of it.</p>

  <p>They did not hint to know why Dinny had come. So far as he could observe,
  they were not craftily concealing that query. He was not asked where all he
  had been, or what he had been doing. They made no comments on his success.
  The fact that he had withdrawn to another world with which they were totally
  unacquainted, and now belonged to it as he had never for one moment belonged
  to them, gave them no apparent sensation of diffidence.</p>

  <p>Uncle Miles rigged two cane fishing-poles, later in the afternoon, and
  invited Dinny to go with him down the hill to the little stream where they
  caught a few small perch and talked freely about Angela, of whose celebrated
  exploits her father was gratefully proud.</p>

  <p>At supper, served shortly after five, to Dinny's high satisfaction, Aunt
  Martha accounted for the scattered family whose ghosts vaguely hovered about
  the well-worn door-steps, the old-fashioned thumb-latches, the paths to the
  shop, the pump, the barn. Poor Susan, of course, was dead. Ferdinand knew
  that, didn't he? Yes&mdash;she had worked fer the Squire Craigs, and died
  there. Greta was still out in Californy. They had an orange farm and three
  fine boys. Yes&mdash;Greta wrote, about twice a year. No&mdash;she had never
  came back. It was purty fer. Elmer was still down at Lafayette in "th' Home."
  Hiram was up in "th' Thumb," a-workin' at a sawmill... Dinny followed the
  Miller saga, at a distance, interested mostly in the fact that these people
  and their affairs were as remote as if Aunt Martha had reported on the goings
  and comings of a family in Zanzibar.</p>

  <p>He waived his proffered right to a second helping of huckleberry pie, and,
  having easily gained the floor in the process of graciously declining their
  hospitable entreaties, Dinny ventured, without preamble, to account for his
  unexpected visit.</p>

  <p>He had become convinced, he said, that his life was not being very well
  lived. The phrase struck him oddly, once he had uttered it. Doubtless it had
  been shaped by this environment. It was the way Uncle Miles might have said
  it, had he been in a mood of confession. Life had lately seemed to lack
  fulfilment, he said. He had felt a desire to make peace with the few people
  whose relations to him had been a source of "disquiet" to himself&mdash;and
  doubtless to them also. He paused.</p>

  <p>"So yuh've been 'n' got converted, Ferdinand," murmured Aunt Martha,
  sanctimoniously. "Bless th' Lord fer that!" She lifted the corner of her
  white apron, and, raising her spectacles, wiped her eyes. "Miles," she said,
  brokenly, "our prayers has been answered. Our wandering boy has at last saw
  th' light. Praise t' His Blessed Name!"</p>

  <p>"Abso<i>lute</i>ly!" ejaculated Uncle Miles, smiling approvingly, and
  hitching his chair back to cross his legs. "And your aunt and I are very glad
  you came. How long can you stay, Ferdinand? Hope you won't have to hurry
  away. There'll be lots to talk about, now you're here after such a long
  time."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Uncle Miles," returned Dinny, in a brief aside. "As I was saying,
  it has recently distressed me that I had permitted certain misunderstandings
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Ferdinand," broke in Uncle Miles, "and there's nothing
  to forgive. You're as welcome as&mdash;as the flowers in May."</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha was crying now, noisily. A sudden wave of distaste for the
  whole adventure flooded Dinny's spirits. His old repugnance claimed him. He
  might have known there would be just such a calamitous scene. It had been his
  hope that there might be a calm, conciliatory talk. The tension would be
  eased. But clearly it was hopeless. Uncle Miles wished only to dodge the
  issue that had hurled them apart, offering an effusive and blustery
  hospitality as an alternative to the air-clearing discussion which the
  situation so urgently called for. Uncle Miles was extravagant with his tender
  of huckleberry pie, but winced at the thought of an honest invoice of their
  disaffection. It was somewhat like Angela's gift of an orange and a doll to
  the baby whose eyes she could not open. Aunt Martha, as usual, had taken
  refuge behind a tear-drenched apron.</p>

  <p>"I shall be leaving, in about an hour," said Dinny, calmly, "and it would
  please me greatly if we three could have a quiet talk."</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha left off sobbing, wiped her eyes, and listened. Uncle Miles
  broke out with vigorous protests. Dinny raised a hand, insistingly, and the
  old man subsided, rather crestfallen.</p>

  <p>"I don't mean to make a long story of it," pursued Dinny, "but something
  has happened to make me quite seriously anxious to be on the very best of
  friendly terms with everyone. You have wondered, Aunt Martha, if I had been
  converted. Probably not&mdash;in the way you mean. I don't feel any more
  religious than before. It's only that I have discovered myself to be
  thoroughly poisoned with aversions, disgusts, and bitter memories, which are
  making a sorry mess of my life. I want now to rise above all that, if I
  can."</p>

  <p>"But that's conversion, Ferdinand!" exclaimed Aunt Martha, fervently.
  "It's th' workin' of th' Spirit! Blessed be His Holy Name!"</p>

  <p>Uncle Miles nodded, sagaciously, and his lips formed the large word that
  denoted unqualified endorsement.</p>

  <p>"And so&mdash;I'm here to ask you to forgive me, my dears, for putting
  myself completely out of your lives. I would like also to be forgiven for all
  the hot, hateful thoughts I have had in regard to you both&mdash;especially
  toward you, Uncle Miles, and for the bitter contempt that has swept through
  me whenever I thought of you. I'm asking for your pardon. I want to be at
  liberty. I'm weary of carrying that load."</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha was crying softly. Uncle Miles's face impulsively brightened,
  wreathed with an absolving smile. He cleared his throat, and stretching out a
  hand, patted Dinny assuringly on his coat-sleeve. Dinny took the old hand in
  his, and, observing that Uncle Miles was in the very act of booming out a
  volley of gallant "abso<i>lute</i>lys," leaned far forward, stared
  questioningly into his uncle's eyes, and slowly, meaningly, shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"No, Uncle Miles&mdash;not that! It's your turn to talk&mdash;but not
  that! Say what you're thinking! You'll feel much better afterwards&mdash;I
  can promise you!"</p>

  <p>The old fellow slowly withdrew his hand, and with the back of it rubbed
  his forehead, beaded with perspiration. Then he swallowed hard and essayed a
  grisly yawn. Dinny had once seen a man die who, after the exhalation of his
  last breath, had yawned just that way&mdash;a yawn with no breath either
  coming or going.</p>

  <p>They waited&mdash;and Uncle Miles spoke, hollowly.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it was like this, Ferdinand. At first, you were only a baby,
  and had no use for the money. Our salary was too little to live on,
  comfortably. What came in for you was a great help&mdash;a great help. Your
  income was larger than mine&mdash;than ours. I suppose I must have had a
  worldly pride, and dreaded to see the time come when you would be better off
  than the rest of us." He hesitated, rubbing his eyes with his knuckles.</p>

  <p>"I can understand that perfectly, Uncle Miles," declared Dinny. "It must
  have been a very real problem."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;then I saw how you felt toward your father, and knew you would
  never accept any help from him. That's when I should have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dinny nodded, comprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"It was a great temptation, I am sure, Uncle Miles."</p>

  <p>"Yer Uncle Miles kept a-sayin', when he went into that Holstein cattle
  business, out in Ioway&mdash;and lost ev'ry cent to that rascally,
  thieving&mdash;" Aunt Martha's voice was growing shrill.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I had the thought that perhaps I could invest your money so you
  could&mdash;" Uncle Miles groped for the right word.</p>

  <p>"Don't spoil it, Uncle Miles," admonished Dinny, hardly above a whisper.
  "It's a great sensation, let me tell you! I hope you can have it! You'll find
  it's worth it, sir!" Dinny's voice had risen to his exultant words. Aunt
  Martha murmured, "Bless th' Lord!"</p>

  <p>"No!" shouted Uncle Miles, in a tone that explained how much effort that
  one agonized little bark cost him. "The fact was&mdash;I wanted to put away
  something. I wasn't saving it for you... Now&mdash;you know all about it!...
  God&mdash;help me!" The brave old head sank, lower and lower, there came a
  sort of inhuman guttural cry from his tight throat.</p>

  <p>Aunt Martha rose, with a little whimper of alarm, and put her arm around
  him, pressing her cheek hard against his.</p>

  <p>"Miles&mdash;my <i>dear!</i> Yuh done it&mdash;at last! Bless th' Lord!
  Bless th' Lord!... Oh, Ferdinand, you've been sent f'm God to help your poor
  uncle&mdash;'n' me."</p>

  <p>Dinny was deeply moved. He did not attempt to analyse his strange
  sensations, but, eclipsing the surge of sympathy for these repentant,
  broken-hearted old people, there rose in him a consciousness of an almost
  uncanny vitality&mdash;the "will-to-power" consciousness, as nearly as he
  could define it at the moment. He felt suddenly matured! It was as if his
  permanent mind&mdash;what he was always thinking of as his "sub-conscious
  mind" in spite of anything the new Psychology might say&mdash;had not only
  ceased complaining at the decisions and intentions of his "conscious mind,"
  but had actually taken charge of the whole enterprise! He knew now what Julia
  meant, though he had fresh reasons for understanding her lack of words to
  explain her strange sensation. She had called it a <i>power!</i>
  Well&mdash;that's what it was. It would sound trite and sentimental if he
  attempted to elucidate. But&mdash;what he had come by was not a
  sentiment&mdash;any more than the roar of the turbines beneath Niagara is a
  sentiment. Julia was right! <i>This was a kind of power!</i> God only knew
  what all you could do with it&mdash;but here it was!... Power!</p>

  <p>Uncle Miles rose, his old face twisted in a pathetically tearful smile,
  and offered Dinny his hand, Aunt Martha still hugging his arm.</p>

  <p>"Seems like we ought to have a word of prayer," suggested Aunt Martha,
  when they had passed through the doorway to the little sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"We've just had that, Aunt Martha," said Dinny&mdash;"the real kind.
  Now&mdash;suppose we sit down and talk a little more about this. Did I
  understand you to say that some man, out in Iowa, had defrauded you
  of&mdash;of that money?"</p>

  <p>They told him the story in relays. Uncle Miles becoming so excited over
  the rank injustice they had suffered that Aunt Martha tried to calm him.</p>

  <p>"Yer uncle gets almost sick, sometimes, a-thinkin' and a-talkin' about it.
  I do wish he could ferget it."</p>

  <p>"That's why I asked," said Dinny. "Uncle Miles&mdash;whatever became of
  that fellow? Do you know?"</p>

  <p>"The last I heard," growled Uncle Miles, "he was back on a rented farm not
  far from Unger, where I first met the dirty skunk. He broke up, out there, as
  he deserved."</p>

  <p>"Broke up&mdash;did he? Perhaps he did not intend to cheat you. Probably
  he was a poor business man. Chances are he's burning up his insides hating
  the people who took his property away from him. Knowing what I do now, Uncle
  Miles, if I were you I'd write him a friendly letter&mdash;you and he were
  once good friends, weren't you?&mdash;and ask him to come up here, this
  autumn, and spend a Sunday. Tell him you and Aunt Martha have a big, fat hen
  that ought to be stewed. Noodles, too, and huckleberry pie.... Treat yourself
  to a thrill! Set yourself free!"</p>

  <p>"Ferdinand," said Aunt Martha, smiling pensively, "it sure does sound
  queer&mdash;yer a-talkin' like this&mdash;when yuh look so worldly like 'n'
  all."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't sound a bit queerer than it feels, I can assure you, Aunt
  Martha."</p>

  <p>"You'll stay the night with us now, won't you, Ferdinand?" entreated Uncle
  Miles.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Old Abner was leaning on both elbows, his boot on an
  inverted three-gallon tin swill-pail, gazing down into one of the pig-pens.
  He turned his head as Jason and Dinny approached. His jaw sagged, and chopped
  up and down, nervously, as he stared. The worn tabs of his ancient coon-skin
  cap lopped his ears. Had Dinny seen a faithful photograph of him, a week ago,
  he would have identified the subject as the patriarch and original founder of
  The Hicks.</p>

  <p>He came slowly to meet them, rubbing his gnarled hand on his short,
  stuffy, leather coat. There was no introduction.</p>

  <p>"Take off yer hat," requested Abner. "Jase says yuh've got that funny
  little point o' hair, like her'n."</p>

  <p>Dinny obliged.</p>

  <p>"Powerful funny 'bout that, Jase," drawled the old man, pointing a crooked
  forefinger at Dinny's head, as if inspecting an animal. "Her pap had that
  there, same as her, same as him. The old feller always had his cap on,
  mostly, 'n' I never rightly noticed 't until he was a-layin' on th' coolin'
  board, next mornin' after he hung hisself. Gol-darned if he didn't have 't,
  too! Danged if he didn't look like a 'ristocrat, a-layin' there!...
  Well&mdash;come in t' th' house, son, 'n' be welcome."</p>

  <p>"I never knew before that my grandfather had taken his own life." Dinny
  became aware that many mysterious silences and evasions of Aunt Martha's had
  now been explained.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it won't hurt yuh none t' know 't. Yuh c'n be proud o' your
  grand-pap, son. Gol-darned if 'twasn't purty fine 'n' brave o' th' old
  codger. I sure never'd a-thought he had 't in him. Ev'rybody was a-moonin'
  around, that night, a-feelin' scared like, 'n' kind o' shamed fer the
  Millers. Gol-darned if I wasn't proud o' th' old cuss!"</p>

  <p>"You have some unusual ideas on the subject of&mdash;suicide, Mr.
  Schrofe."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;o' course&mdash;I wouldn't 'xac'ly recommend 't t' nobody,
  but, all th' same, if I'd knowed yer grand-pap had 't in him, I'd 'a' had a
  lot more respect fer him whilst he lived."</p>

  <p>They drew up their chairs before the grate&mdash;stiff, prim, narrow
  rocking-chairs that had a tendency to creep about on the worn rag
  carpet&mdash;and spent two hours talking about Julia's monument.</p>

  <p>Old Abner's bitterness about Craig's shocking discourtesy in having their
  little stone cast aside had obviously become an obsession. Once he had
  launched upon the painful topic, there was no distracting him.</p>

  <p>"Guess we'll have t' start now," admonished Jason, consulting his big
  nickel-cased watch. "I'm a-drivin' him over t' Wayne, pap, to ketch a train
  fer Cincinnati."</p>

  <p>"'Pears like I done all th' talkin'," regretted Abner. "Lot o' things I
  wanted t' ask yuh, too. Seems like when I get a-goin' 'bout that there
  feller, I can't stop."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Dinny, "it's too bad. I'm sorry. I am on my way to see him,
  and I mean to ask him about it. I don't believe he ever knew the particulars.
  It must have been a terrible mistake. Would you be glad if you found out it
  was a mistake, and that he was not really to blame?"</p>

  <p>The old fellow slowly nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"Gol-darned if I wouldn't give ev'ry one o' them Berkshires, out there in
  them pens, t' hear that feller say he hadn't knowed, 'n' was sorry 'n'
  that!"</p>

  <p>"Like hell yuh would, pap! Half o' them hawgs b'longs t' me!" Jason,
  vastly pleased with his joke, gave the old man an affectionate whack between
  the shoulders.</p>

  <p>"All fun aside, Mr. Schrofe," said Dinny, seriously, taking his hand, "I
  hope to find out that my father never meant to do you generous people this
  harm. I believe it would hurt Julia, terribly, if she had known about the
  misery it's caused you."</p>

  <p>As they sauntered toward the sedan, standing by the old hitching-rack,
  Jason said, "Would yuh mind if I told pap?"</p>

  <p>"About the letter?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;th' letter 'n' that."</p>

  <p>"I believe Julia would want him to know about it, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I'll tell him."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ALTHOUGH aware of the curious phenomenon of familiar streets
  narrowing, during one's extended absence, to about three fourths their
  previous width, and tall buildings shrinking to a mere travesty of their
  former stateliness, Dinny Brumm was unprepared for the shock when, at
  midnight, he followed his bags from the taxi to the desk at The Barstow.</p>

  <p>Even allowing for the fact that when he had first timidly ventured through
  its spacious, shriekingly ornate lobby, as an untravelled youth, The Barstow
  was vain-gloriously, self-consciously new, it seemed impossible to believe
  that a few years could have so tarnished its gilt and frayed its
  cushions.</p>

  <p>The once impressive gargoyles still reared on their hind claws to support
  massive old-worldish lamps, but the awe-inspiring challenge of their "How
  dare you, worm?" that had darted from their shocked, staring eyes, was now
  replaced by a simpering, apologetic servility. Their orbs were dull, their
  flanks were lean, their talons had straightened out as if to ward off a
  slap.</p>

  <p>The desk, formerly to be approached hat in hand and with regret that one
  had not brought a joss-stick, had had its stinger pulled, too, its smile
  resembling the conciliatory smirk of the urgent driver upon invitation to
  pull up at the kerb and state his name and address for the augmentation of
  certain statistics in process of assembly at Police Headquarters.</p>

  <p>And yet, barring the normal wear and tear of a half-dozen prosperous
  years, The Barstow, Dinny knew, had not altered appreciably. The change was
  all in himself.</p>

  <p>But whatever of modified outlook had been gradually coming to pass in his
  mind, due to the liberating experiences of the years, to the tarnishment of
  earlier glosses and glitters, and the reduction of once astounding
  dimensions, it was nothing compared to the uncanny magic that had suddenly
  recreated him into something so different from the self whose habitual
  deductions and reactions had been stabilized&mdash;so utterly different that
  he found it difficult to recognize his attitudes and opinions as his own. His
  habitual responses were inactive, as if he had been smitten with an
  amnesia.</p>

  <p>Yesterday's experience of complete reconciliation with Uncle Miles and
  Aunt Martha had performed some queer tricks on Dinny's mind. He had not been
  surprised at the sound of his own words soliciting pardon for the bitter
  animosity he had nourished in regard to them. That was what he had gone there
  to do, and he had meant to see it through, hoping for no further results than
  the satisfaction of getting it off his chest. Down inside himself, whatever
  he might say to Uncle Miles, there would unquestionably remain the private
  opinion that the pompously pious old fellow was a piker.</p>

  <p>All that Dinny would have to show for his strange adventure in the
  voluntary enterprise of crow eating would be a sense of having made an honest
  experiment with Julia's theory for the purgation of poison. He did not expect
  that his estimate of Uncle Miles would be in any way reappraised.</p>

  <p>But when he had finished with them, last night, he had not only told Uncle
  Miles that he fully forgave the wrong he had done; he really had forgiven the
  old man and was in a mood of sympathy for him. Uncle Miles had faced an odd
  predicament as custodian of a child's annuity exceeding his own salary.</p>

  <p>Dinny could understand how his uncle had postponed doing the thing that
  required to be done, saying to himself, "Next year I must tell him," but
  always fearful of the consequences. What indeed would become of a small boy,
  living in a frugal home, were he suddenly handed an allowance in excess of
  the family's total income? Uncle Miles had drifted into an unhappy
  perplexity, but not because he had the instincts of a thief. And Aunt Martha
  had consented to it, ruefully, no doubt, believing that Uncle Miles knew
  best.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time Dinny had felt that if ever the occasion arose when he
  could back the old weasel into a corner and force him to confess himself an
  unmitigated fraud the sensation of seeing his despised pomposity shrivel and
  peel off like snake-skin would be worth all the mental torture he had
  suffered.</p>

  <p>Uncle Miles had crumpled to a degree surpassing the most extravagant hopes
  Dinny had sourly cherished, but there was no diabolical pleasure afforded by
  it; Dinny had shared the old man's sorrow with an understanding that seemed
  to enhance the value of his own personality. He began to appreciate what
  Julia had written concerning her altered estimate of herself, after sincerely
  making peace with Susan. She had felt "promoted." It was as if she "had won a
  prize." It was as if she had discovered herself to be "a princess."</p>

  <p>Throughout today Dinny had reviewed last night's strange experience in
  Julia's room where he had slept.</p>

  <p>At ten, Aunt Martha had lighted the way up the steep, narrow, uncarpeted
  stairs, piloting him with a reeking kerosene lamp.</p>

  <p>"Almost nothin's been changed in here since it was her'n," said Aunt
  Martha, turning down the patchwork quilt. "Hiram had a sale cried when him
  'n' Lucy moved to Michigan, but Jase Schrofe, who had previous bought the
  house, bid in these here things o' Julia's and had 'em left where they was.
  Exceptin' fer the desk, it's the same." Aunt Martha patted the pillows.
  "Yes," she sighed, reminiscently, "dear Julia died in this here old bed."</p>

  <p>So it was here that Julia had summoned her slimming strength to write the
  letter that was "promoting" Dinny to something of the lofty dignity that she
  had won "like a prize."</p>

  <p>Ordinarily, he thought, it would not be much of a recommendation for a bed
  to say of it, five minutes before one climbed in, that someone of
  far-reaching posthumous influence had died in it, in a lugubrious tone
  hinting that the departed spirit might be within earshot; but if Julia's
  ghost haunted the room, so much the better, thought Dinny.</p>

  <p>He was a long time going to sleep, and even when, from sheer fatigue
  produced by the emotional strain of the day, he drifted into
  semi-consciousness, there was a strange sense that Julia was coming along
  into his dreams.</p>

  <p>There never had been a photograph of her except a cheap little tintype of
  a group of girls taken at the county fair. The cheeks had been tinted to an
  unhealthy flush, and the mouth had been drawn into a prim little pucker. It
  was unfair to Julia, of course, as even Aunt Martha admitted, to whom beauty
  was but skin deep.</p>

  <p>In his half-somnolent state, Dinny conjured a portrait of Julia, the
  radiant. It was a satisfyingly clear picture, and, as he half-consciously
  brought it alive and put it through a variety of moods, he felt he was
  recovering his girl-mother.</p>

  <p>The dream, if it was a dream, was not altogether pleasant, however. Julia
  seemed to proceed into an attitude of entreaty as if he had done something to
  make her very unhappy. And when, at length, sitting opposite him on the
  grass, her feet folded under her short skirt, she began pensively gathering
  up the little paper cups and plates, her eyes downcast and swollen with
  crying, Dinny roused with a painful recurrence of the one tragic mistake that
  could not be mended.</p>

  <p>He had made peace with Uncle Miles to their complete mutual satisfaction.
  And tomorrow he would have an interview with his father who, he had learned
  by wire before leaving New York, was in Cincinnati for a week on one of his
  periodical inspection visits; doubtless that interview would lift the burden
  of misgiving he had carried in respect to Zandy Craig. He had it in mind to
  stop at Magnolia also, and attempt to revise his opinions of that
  institution, in the light of his new flair for sympathetic understanding.</p>

  <p>But there was nothing to be done in the case of Joan. She had made it
  quite impossible for him to repair the damage he had done to an affection
  which, instead of relaxing its grip, seemed to be mounting!</p>

  <p>He tossed about for an hour, worrying over the utter hopelessness of his
  longing for Joan. Conceding that their romance was a closed incident, what
  might still be done to insure her happiness? For, surely, Joan could not feel
  satisfied with the manner in which she had left him without a word when she
  had decided&mdash;quite impulsively, he presumed&mdash;to run away with
  Tommy. What a dismal honeymoon for Joan! And for Tommy, too, who couldn't be
  expected to be pleased with himself.</p>

  <p>If they weren't on the other side of the Atlantic, reflected Dinny, he
  would go to them with his comradely congratulations and the assurance that he
  not only bore them no ill will but sincerely wished them great and lasting
  joy. It would be worth almost any length of journey to replace, in his
  memory, a contented and joyful Joan for the torturing image of her
  tear-stained face as she collected the pitiful little remains of their picnic
  luncheon. It would be a quite dreadful thing to have that picture of Joan's
  dejection and disappointment increasingly menacing his peace.</p>

  <p>His decision to mend matters with Joan in so far as might be achieved
  through a friendly interview with her and Tommy involved a long series of
  imaginary circumstances in which they were brought together now at a little
  dinner he would give for them at Dexter's, now at their own table in an
  apartment somewhere up town. But&mdash;by Gad!&mdash;why wait? Lacey's had
  said Tommy was to be in Europe until early November, hadn't they? Why
  shouldn't he slip over there, directly, and give the poor things a chance to
  enjoy their honeymoon, undistressed by the remorse which Joan would
  inevitably feel? By Gad!&mdash;he would do it! As soon as he had finished
  with his father, and the intended visit to Magnolia, he would sail. He would
  make his relations to Tommy and Joan so pleasant for them and him that they
  could expect to be comrades for ever! That would take but a day. Then he
  would go to London for the winter, and try to write. He had no notion what he
  would be writing, but there was a sensation of desire. That was good: he had
  quite lost it.</p>

  <p>It was a great idea! He would sail next week. That would solve the
  problem. He couldn't have Joan back, but he could do his utmost to make her
  happy. Dinny had gone to sleep constructing scenes and dialogue for the
  little play that was to dispose of the paper dishes.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At ten, next morning, Dinny telephoned up to the suite which
  Zandy Craig occupied on the ninth floor, requesting an interview.</p>

  <p>A male secretary informed him that Mr. Craig's day was entirely engaged.
  If Mr. Brumm wished to confide the nature of his business to Mr. Craig's
  assistant, Mr. Effelbaum, an appointment could be arranged.</p>

  <p>Dinny sensibly refused to be irritated over this slight delay. It was
  consistent with good business that Zandy Craig should not be open to the
  importunities of any bore or beggar who happened to drift in. He said he
  would be glad to see Mr. Effelbaum and explain his errand. The time was set
  for eleven. That was excellent. Mr. Effelbaum would quickly clear the way for
  him. Perhaps he and his father might lunch together.</p>

  <p>With keen anticipation, and not a little nervous excitement, Dinny dressed
  carefully, and, at eleven sharp, took the elevator to the ninth floor, where
  he was shown into the suite, the secretary taking him immediately into the
  presence of the bright-eyed, urbane, little Jew who served as the last
  barricade between his exalted master and the public.</p>

  <p>"So you would see Mr. Greck?" began Mr. Effelbaum, tapping his desk
  lightly with a long steel paper-knife.</p>

  <p>Even making due allowance for Mr. Effelbaum's Hebraic handling of
  gutturals, there was something rather ominous in the manner of his
  pronunciation of "Greck."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Craig is my father," replied Dinny, suddenly, resolved to make his
  story short and come to the point without circumlocution.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Greck has no son," said Mr. Effelbaum, stiffly.</p>

  <p>Instantly Dinny understood. Effelbaum, resentful of the "Greck" article in
  <i>Hallelujah,</i> was treating himself to a helping of revenge.</p>

  <p>However, Effelbaum was acting according to his best knowledge, no doubt.
  He was honest in his belief that Zandy Craig had no son. Dinny was a mere
  impostor, so far as Effelbaum's information went.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you had better ask him. He is in, I presume?" Dinny was patient,
  respectful.</p>

  <p>"There is no needt I should inquire, Mr. Brumm."</p>

  <p>Dinny reached in his pocket for a card, scribbled a line on it, and handed
  it across the desk.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind giving this to Mr. Craig?"</p>

  <p>Effelbaum read the brief message and returned the card with a crooked
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Greck will nodt see you, sir. You may tell me whadt you want."</p>

  <p>Dinny flushed uncomfortably, and leaned forward with an elbow on the
  mahogany desk.</p>

  <p>"Is he in?" Dinny's tone hinted at an impatience that was rapidly getting
  out of hand.</p>

  <p>Effelbaum, savouring the situation, grinned sardonically and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Budt not to you&mdash;Mr. Brumm."</p>

  <p>Impetuously, Dinny rose, and observing that Effelbaum's hand was moving
  toward the row of ivory buttons on the left corner of the desk, quickly
  grasped him by the wrist.</p>

  <p>"You may think you're doing your duty," he growled, "but this time you're
  exceeding it. I came here to see my father, and I mean to! Understand? Which
  of us takes that card in&mdash;you or I?"</p>

  <p>To Dinny's surprise, Effelbaum glanced up with a taunting distortion of
  lip, and laughed.</p>

  <p>"You take idt in to Mr. <i>'Greck!'"</i> He wagged his head in the
  direction of the adjacent door and shrugged a shoulder, self-absolvingly. "I
  haf triedt to spare you a bainful moment. You are determinedt to haf it...
  Go&mdash;and haf idt!"</p>

  <p>Dinny released his grip on the unresisting hand and searched Effelbaum's
  sneer with eyes suddenly nonplussed.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to infer that my father has given instructions I am not to be
  admitted?"</p>

  <p>Effelbaum's brows, lips, shoulders and palms raised, concertedly, in a
  gesture that wished himself well out of the awkward <i>contretemps.</i></p>

  <p>"Mr. 'Greck' toldt me he had no son. If you can convinze him to the
  contrary, I shall nodt detain you." He rose, opened the door, and bowed Dinny
  in, with an elaborate gesture.</p>

  <p>"Mr. <i>'Greck'</i>&mdash;Mr. Brumm."</p>

  <p>The stenographer at Zandy Craig's elbow rose and retired. Craig pushed in
  the slide on which her notebook had rested, leaned back in his opulent
  swivel-chair, folded his arms, and regarded his intrusive caller from under
  lowered brows.</p>

  <p>"You may sit down, if you like," he said, coolly, dashing Dinny's
  intention to offer his hand. "I assume you are my son. In fact&mdash;now that
  I see you, I know you are. There is a certain likeness. And you have
  something of the facial lines of your mother."</p>

  <p>Dinny smiled, half-heartedly, wondering, as his father paused, whether it
  was time for him to speak.</p>

  <p>"May I inquire why you came, and how I may serve you?" continued Craig,
  steadily.</p>

  <p>"I came to ask your pardon." Dinny's voice was sincerely contrite.</p>

  <p>The big man slowly raised both long arms, clasped his hands behind his
  leonine grey head in a pose that Dinny recognized as a natural posture of his
  own when in a quandary, and closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry I have waited so long," added Dinny.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I'm afraid you waited... too long!" Craig looked squarely at
  the tardy prodigal, his expression severe.</p>

  <p>Dinny nodded.</p>

  <p>"I never thought I wanted to see you, sir, until lately. Something quite
  important has altered my opinion. I would like to tell you about it."</p>

  <p>"That can wait," said Craig, folding his arms on the desk. "I'll talk
  first, if you're agreed. I've probably thought more about this matter than
  you have; and, anyway, I'm your father. It's my right to speak first, is it
  not?"</p>

  <p>Dinny smiled approval.</p>

  <p>"When you were a lad, young fellow, I made many efforts to show you that I
  meant to do everything I could for you, in face of the circumstances that
  kept us apart. I could not hold it against you when you resisted my attempts
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I did not understand, sir. I had been led to think that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Craig signed that he did not wish to be interrupted. "Yes&mdash;I know, or
  can surmise, what you were led to think. Your Aunt Martha would have seen to
  that. And as for your parson uncle, I dislike to think of him. But&mdash;to
  continue&mdash;I did indulge the hope that once you were away from that
  atmosphere, it might please you to reflect that you had a father who had
  tried to do what is customarily thought of as the right thing.</p>

  <p>"After Mr. Brumm had informed me you had a job and were on your own, I
  still waited. Sometimes I hoped that you would be moved to write me at least
  a note of appreciation. I disliked to think that I had bred a child who, in
  his later teens, had not managed to develop as much common courtesy as would
  have seemed to demand some sort of response."</p>

  <p>Dinny's chagrin and remorse were painful. He lowered his eyes, and nodded,
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"Through that period when you would have been going to college like a
  gentleman, and backed by the full support of your father, I happened to be
  heavily worried by a variety of cares, by no means the least of
  which&mdash;though I'm damned if I know just why I'm telling you this, for
  you have no right to my confidence&mdash;was my wife's separation from me.
  She had found me incompatible, though I was very fond of her. My duties
  required a great deal of my time. I was much away from home. We drifted
  apart. She left me.</p>

  <p>"My daughter Alison was shortly sent abroad to school. Had you come to me,
  in those days, informing me that you had been an ass and an ingrate, I should
  have attempted to dissuade you of that estimate of yourself, I think, just
  from sheer loneliness and a natural wish for a reconstruction of my family
  ties.</p>

  <p>"Eventually, Alison comes home, and accidentally encounters you here,
  though I was not informed of that until much later. Why she did not tell me,
  at once, I do not know, though I have surmised, and if that unfortunate
  accidental meeting brought either of you unhappiness&mdash;and I rather
  suspect, from chance remarks of Alison's, that it did&mdash;I am sorry. She
  did not tell me until the appearance of your assault on me in that damned
  dirty little rag which, I am told, you are now editing."</p>

  <p>Craig's voice had risen, indignantly, with the last few words. His eyes
  were full of pain and his big fists clenched. He pushed back his chair, and
  rose, thrusting his long hands deeply into his trouser pockets.</p>

  <p>"That day," he shouted, savagely, "whatever desire I still had for a sight
  of you&mdash;my son&mdash;was utterly abandoned. God knows which one of your
  ancestors you may resemble, but you're not like your charming mother, and I
  have the self-esteem to think you're not like me!"</p>

  <p>Craig had flung the chair back against the wall, and was pacing up and
  down behind the desk, biting his words into hot bits.</p>

  <p>"If you had come here shabby and broke, I would instruct my secretary to
  draw you a cheque. That would be for the relief of my own mind. You do not
  appear to be in want. You are well dressed and apparently have had your
  breakfast. I presume your position as the editor of a filthy magazine devoted
  to sophisticated blackmail and parlour socialism puts you beyond the
  necessity of my alms.... So&mdash;there is nothing you are likely to want
  that I can give you. As for this belated request for pardon, suppose we don't
  go into that, at all. I am not a sentimental person, either by instinct or
  practice. Neither are you, if I have correctly interpreted your temperament
  as reflected in your writing. Whatever made you come here, I don't
  know&mdash;and I don't care to know! If you have any remorse run along with
  it! If I have any regret, it's my own business.... Now&mdash;I think that's
  all, and if you're sure you are in need of nothing but my pardon, may I ask
  you to excuse me. This is a busy day, and, as you know, this interview was
  unsolicited by me.... Mr. Effelbaum will show you out."</p>

  <p>He pushed a button, and Effelbaum appeared as if he had been waiting, hand
  on knob, for his cue.</p>

  <p>This sudden move of his father's had been so unexpected, so ruthlessly
  conclusive, that Dinny was at a loss to know what, if anything, to do.</p>

  <p>The door was wide open, Effelbaum was in the room waiting, Craig had
  readjusted his gold nose-glasses and was busying himself with the papers on
  his desk. Dinny had been definitely dismissed, and nothing remained for him
  to do but leave. He felt himself chastised like a half-grown boy. This man
  was his father, in very truth. Dinny's complete breakdown of self-possession
  was obviously an automatic response demanded by filial instinct suddenly
  recognizing the paternal authority of this man who, a stranger, had now
  loomed large as the sire.</p>

  <p>For a moment only Dinny hesitated, took one step forward, was on the point
  of entreating for a chance to be heard. His father did not look up. Effelbaum
  fiddled with his watch-guard. Dinny turned slowly away. At the doorway he
  paused.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, sir," he said, respectfully.</p>

  <p>There was no reply. Effelbaum was at Craig's elbow, receiving a handful of
  opened letters. The trim stenographer was waiting for the retiring caller to
  make his exit. Dinny's interview with his father seemed to be over.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Magnolia was only fifty minutes away, but in those fifty
  minutes Dinny carefully examined his own mind in respect to the adventure on
  which he had launched, a few days earlier, and was delighted to discover that
  the unfortunate meeting with his father had not dashed his interest and
  belief in the thing he had set out to do.</p>

  <p>A week ago his mind would have been tempestuous with bitter hate and
  stormy schemes for reprisals. He could easily picture the nature of his
  burning thoughts as he rehearsed, item by item, the progressive phases of his
  defenceless humiliation in his father's office. No!&mdash;By God! There
  wasn't a man alive who could put Dinny Brumm into such a debasing predicament
  and expect to get away with it unscratched! Least of all the man who had been
  responsible for so much of his mental torture, all through the years! Craig
  should have his pay with usury! Damn him! <i>Damn him!</i></p>

  <p>Dinny was surprised, this afternoon, at his mood; not surprised so much
  over his attitude of sympathetic understanding for Zandy Craig who had waited
  and hoped for some manner of response from his disaffected son&mdash;waited
  until the wound had healed and left an impermeable scar. The thing that
  amazed Dinny was the nature of this new serenity. It was not a mere
  hand-folding inertia. He tried vainly to define it in a phrase, and could
  arrive at nothing more adequate than "dynamic peace."</p>

  <p>As he sat looking out at the window of the club car which served as a hub
  for the revolving wooded hills, faintly tipped with early autumn tints,
  Dinny's mental state was a novelty to himself. Whatever description his mood
  deserved, it was certainly not apathy. There was something vital, vibrant,
  kinetic in it. Jason Schrofe had not been far afield when he thought of this
  peculiar energy as "dynamite."</p>

  <p>Always Dinny had entertained varying degrees of contempt for the
  unworkable theory of non-resistance. Sometimes he grinned when he saw the
  word in print. What sort of people were advocates of non-resistance? Strong
  men&mdash;likely to make some constructive contribution of skill or genius?
  Not at all. The non-resisters had had their frail, other-cheeking,
  boot-licking programme of life handed to them at birth. It was less a
  sublimity of soul than a feebleness of body.</p>

  <p>As for organized warfare, that was quite another matter. That was a
  mass-madness inspired by predatory bankers and swashbucklers, diabolically
  unconcerned about the cost of their greed and pomposity to the drafted and
  driven who were herded into the tragic hoax by the stimulating rattle of
  brave drums, stampeded into indifference to the likelihood of their being
  ushered out of it to the depressing tune of scalpels and saws and forceps
  tinkling metallically on glass-topped, rubber-castored tables. That was,
  indeed, another matter!</p>

  <p>But non-resistance, attemptedly practised by an individual, was sheer
  cowardice. How idiotic&mdash;for a church full of people to stand up, of a
  Sunday morning, and bellow their lungs out for a theory that none but the
  sick, crippled, and undersized actually believed in to the point of practical
  demonstrations.</p>

  <p>How deliciously absurd&mdash;when some hollow-cheeked, hollow-chested,
  dreamy-eyed, five-foot-four, one hundred and nineteen pound Christian boosted
  himself up at prayer-meeting to declare, in a thin, piping squeak, that, as
  for him, he believed in non-resistance.</p>

  <p>The only sane answer to that, offered by the people who really had the
  world's work to do, was a laughing "By Gad&mdash;you'd <i>better!"</i></p>

  <p>"But," shrills the altruistic little fellow, "this is my honest
  conviction! I sincerely believe that it's more sensible never to fight
  back!"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," grins the ham-handed six-footer. "You would! You're a wise
  little man. You just keep on thinking that, if you know what's good for
  you!"</p>

  <p>Invoicing his own feelings, today, Dinny marvelled that the hymns and
  liturgies and homilies of Christianity had taken so little account of the
  fact that non-resistance, far from being a state of supine lethargy, was a
  dynamic of high potentiality.</p>

  <p>Why didn't the Church leave off singing, "I am Jesus' little lamb," and
  recognize the very substantial and demonstrable power of <i>the spirit in
  action!</i> Dinny had never felt so alive, so alert, so energized in his
  life. His compliant understanding of his father's rudeness and refusal to
  conciliate was accompanied by a rising tide of personal poise and power.
  Perhaps this serenity was at least approximately denoted by the ancient
  phrase&mdash;"the peace that surpasseth understanding."... By Gad&mdash;it
  was a fact!</p>

  <p>For a moment there was a flash of belief, as if he had discovered a
  universal cure-all for every possible anxiety, that the potent sentence
  printed on Julia's salvaged scrap of scripture was possessed of magical
  properties. But, of course, even this formula for power was conditioned
  somewhat by circumstances. He could forgive Joan for running away from him
  without a word of regret or explanation. Doubtless he deserved it. She had
  given him his chance. By what right could he expect her to live interminably
  on the hope that he might wear himself out with hateful cynicism, and, having
  eventually burned up all his carbon, ask her to take charge of the ashes! The
  girl had her life to live; hadn't she?... Oh, yes&mdash;all that was plain as
  a pikestaff; but the fact remained that no length of his love, no depth of
  his understanding, no dynamic of forgiveness could restore Joan to him. Some
  mistakes were irrevocable!... He could forgive&mdash;had forgiven&mdash;his
  father for the savage rebuff, but that would not give him back his
  father.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Magnolia was a mere pocket-edition. The clangor of the gong
  on which the motorman cleared the track, as the Sunnyside Avenue car demanded
  her right of way at the corner of Main and Broad&mdash;busiest spot in
  town&mdash;was surely redundant, seeing how little traffic she coped with.
  All activity on the streets had been slowed down to the tempo of Zanesdale
  and Unger.</p>

  <p>Dinny watched the familiar shops amble by, smiling unconsciously at their
  decrepitude. Had the town built nothing new? Yes&mdash;here was an important
  replacement; a full half block of glossy yellow brick six storeys high! The
  car had stopped on the red, and there was ample time to read the names of the
  businesses that occupied the imposing new building. Some of the names he
  recognized. There was Hunter the Hatter which he had always considered a
  choice bit of alliteration, often wondering whether Hunter's selection of a
  vocation had been influenced thereby. Some of the names were unfamiliar. The
  whole transparent corner of the ground floor was occupied with swagger
  motor-cars&mdash;"Spencer Davis, Manager."</p>

  <p>Was it possible that this was "Spike"? That was his name&mdash;Spencer. It
  would be interesting to see what manner of man Spike had evolved to. Dinny
  impulsively strode to the rear platform as the car started forward, and swung
  himself off. He had all but forgotten Spike. Once upon a time, he had hated
  him with all his might, but in recent years nothing had been left of it but a
  dulled, dispassionate aversion.</p>

  <p>The place was empty except for the display cars, a workman with a
  chamois-skin, and a neat girl with an adroit nail-file who was advertised as
  ready to furnish "Information," in case&mdash;as appeared
  unlikely&mdash;anyone should desire it.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Davis is in," replied the girl, indifferently, as if the fact
  could scarcely be expected to interest anybody. "Through there," she added,
  pointing over her shoulder with the nail-file, and resuming her
  occupation.</p>

  <p>It was Spike; no question about that. There was a symmetrical bald spot on
  his crown about the size of a tonsure, but it would hardly have been mistaken
  for that if the picture of it had included the ears which, viewed from the
  rear&mdash;he was bent over a desk telephone&mdash;were built rather for
  enduring combats than confessions.</p>

  <p>Dinny waited, just inside the door, for Spike to finish and greet him.
  Becoming aware that the conversation was embarrassingly private, for Spike
  was in an attitude of frantic supplication, he quietly backed out, but in
  that moment he had accidentally heard enough to inform him that his erstwhile
  opponent was in difficulty.</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;but see here, Mr. Amberly, I simply can't do it today! Maybe I
  can by Monday or Tuesday, if I can make some collections. Give a fellow a
  break, can't you? Yeah&mdash;I know it's a sight draft, but I can't raise
  seventeen-fifty this afternoon, and that's all there is to it!... Hell! It's
  impossible!"</p>

  <p>The receiver had banged back on the hook, and Spike, considerably shaken
  and distraught, was moving toward the open door. Dinny was occupied with
  reading a large bulletin pasted on the glazed partition setting forth the
  merits of a new oiling system that had just made over the whole motor
  industry into something theatrically other than it had been. Spike looked his
  age&mdash;plus.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember me?" asked Dinny.</p>

  <p>Spike stared hard for a moment; then grinned as amiably as his
  perturbation would permit, and nodded, extending his hand.</p>

  <p>"Y-e-a-h!" he marvelled, as the light slowly filtered through. "Dinny
  Brumm! I'll be damned! What are you doin' here?"</p>

  <p>"A little business trip, Spike, and"&mdash;a sudden impulse prompted Dinny
  to rush on into an unintended remark&mdash;"I have decided to buy a car here
  and drive back to New York. Thought you might be willing to talk it over with
  me."</p>

  <p>"That's what we're here for, old-timer," rejoiced Spike, noisily. "About
  what are you looking for, Dinny? You're turning something in, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I disposed of my car some time ago when I was to be out of the
  country for a while."</p>

  <p>"That's good&mdash;and unusual."</p>

  <p>They stepped out into the show-room, where Spike, who knew his business,
  proceeded without delay to an energetic sales-talk, utterly oblivious of
  their earlier antagonism and the marked changes wrought upon each of them by
  the intervening years.</p>

  <p>Dinny was only a half-hour making up his mind to purchase the dark blue
  coupé with the grey whipcord upholstery. It was, he said, about what he
  wanted.</p>

  <p>"How soon can it be ready for the road, Spike?"</p>

  <p>"It's ready now!"</p>

  <p>"How about plates?"</p>

  <p>"I'll get 'em for you. You can take it along with the demonstration tags;
  they'll be all right for today."</p>

  <p>They returned to the office desk and sat down.</p>

  <p>"The usual terms&mdash;over ten months?" Spike straightened the carbon in
  his order-book and prepared to write.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'm going to pay cash for it." Dinny produced his cheque-book,
  and unscrewed the top from his pen. "Seventeen hundred and
  fifty&mdash;right?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;that's right," repeated Spike, with a combination gasp and
  sigh that struck Dinny as one of the most startling expressions of surprise
  and relief he had ever heard.</p>

  <p>"There you are," said Dinny.</p>

  <p>Spike fanned his shoulder with the unblotted cheque, and laughed
  nervously.</p>

  <p>"By God, Dinny, you don't know it, but you've damn' near saved my life. I
  don't mind telling you that if I hadn't sold you this car&mdash;right
  now&mdash;for cash&mdash;I likely would have lost my agency!"</p>

  <p>"Glad I happened in, then, at the opportune moment." Dinny tried to make
  the comment sound casual.</p>

  <p>Of a sudden, Spike's face grew serious and he gnawed his lip,
  reflectively.</p>

  <p>"Just when did you come in, Dinny?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Two-forty&mdash;from Cincinnati."</p>

  <p>"Yeah... No&mdash;I mean, how long had you been here when I found you
  outside the door?"</p>

  <p>"Only a moment... It's quite all right, Spike. I can use the car. I had
  expected to buy one, sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it's pretty damn' decent of you&mdash;I'll say," muttered
  Spike, in a tone of mingled gratitude and contrition.</p>

  <p>"You would have done the same thing, doubtless, if you had accidentally
  stumbled in on me and found me in a jam."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it!" confessed Spike, brusquely. "What's come over you, Dinny?
  You sure weren't that sort of a chap when we were in school, and"&mdash;he
  chuckled, dryly&mdash;"nobody would think you were a Fairy Godmother, to read
  your&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's all happened just lately, Spike. Like to hear about it?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;if it isn't private. I sure would... Wait till I tell that boy
  to put on a new spare. The one she's carrying has had couple o' hundred miles
  about town."</p>

  <p>It was not an easy task to confide the secret to Spike. He was quite
  unprepared for such thinking, and he had important matters on his mind. He
  had first to talk to Mr. Amberly. Dinny could not help being amused at the
  vast alteration of tone with which he informed Mr. Amberly, crisply, that he
  would be over presently to take up "that little matter" in full. It called to
  mind the story about the rabbit that found the whisky.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'm damned if I ever thought you'd get religion," observed
  Spike, after listening, rather absently, for some minutes. "You're the last
  man in the world."</p>

  <p>"I don't think it is that," said Dinny. "I've discovered that it's
  impossible for a man to be healthy and up on his toes with his system
  poisoned by old grudges. I suppose it's like arthritis. The poison's all
  through you, though the focal infection may be in one place and the pain in
  another."</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I see. You've got an infected back tooth, and a pain in your
  shoulder. Is that what you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely! You've an old grudge against your uncle, and&mdash;and take it
  out on your girl."</p>

  <p>"Married&mdash;Dinny?"</p>

  <p>Dinny shook his head without looking up.</p>

  <p>"You must have had a grudge against your uncle. Have you fixed it up?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but I waited too long."</p>

  <p>"Lost the girl, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Quite definitely." Dinny rose, and they went out to the kerb where the
  new car was parked.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll be driving over to the college," wondered Spike. "Lot of
  changes over there since you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Since I was fired," assisted Dinny, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted to see it again. They
  sure did give you a rotten deal."</p>

  <p>"I thought that, too, until just lately."</p>

  <p>"By God!&mdash;I believe you're in earnest! Do you honestly think that it
  would make a fellow more efficient in his business if he made friends with
  all the people he despised, and everybody that had got his goat, and not
  given him a break?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;if he went into it for the sole purpose of selling more
  cars&mdash;that's what you mean, don't you?&mdash;I doubt it very much. But
  if he made an honest stab at it, with the hope of cleaning out his poison and
  promoting himself to a higher class of animal, his increased efficiency would
  inevitably follow, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"It sure sounds sort o' moonshiny. God!&mdash;I'd feel silly going into
  old man Kennerly's place, for instance, to ask him to be friends. Couldn't,
  if I wanted to, now," added Spike, with apparent relief that a good excuse
  had occurred to him. "The old double-crosser's laid up at home, I understand,
  with some kind of a heart attack. Damned if I knew he had one!"</p>

  <p>Dinny smiled broadly.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he's poisoned. Why don't you go and help the doctor pull the old
  bird through?"</p>

  <p>"How would that help <i>old Kennerly</i> get rid of his poison, if I went
  to see him with the idea of getting rid of <i>mine?"</i></p>

  <p>Dinny shook his head, admitting his perplexity.</p>

  <p>"Funny thing about that," he said, thoughtfully. "It's true, though: this
  stuff's contagious, Spike.... You know"&mdash;he went on, after a momentary
  reflection&mdash;"I didn't come here today to do anything for <i>your</i>
  poison. I'm trying to be free of <i>mine.</i> If you go to old Kennerly to be
  free of <i>yours,</i> I dare say that before you're done with it, Kennerly
  will have unloaded <i>his.</i> Might save his life! Or&mdash;if it didn't, he
  might at least be able to die like a gentleman."</p>

  <p>Spike stood staring.</p>

  <p>"My God!&mdash;Dinny! Do you believe there's anything in this?"</p>

  <p>Dinny took Spike's coat lapel lightly between thumb and fingers, looking
  him steadily in the eyes. "Yes&mdash;and <i>so do you!"</i></p>

  <p>He opened the car door, and climbed in. The engine responded smoothly to
  the starter.</p>

  <p>"You remember the way, don't you?" called Spike.</p>

  <p>"Yes... But I'm not going out there, just now. How's the road down to
  Pinckney?"</p>

  <p>"Perfect! And pretty, too. Remember the cliffs and mounds, down
  there?"</p>

  <p>Dinny nodded, let in the clutch, rolled slowly down the familiar street.
  In his present state of mind, he wondered if he was really competent to
  drive. His hands were trembling. Old Jason was right. This
  stuff&mdash;whatever it might be&mdash;was like dynamite. You had to handle
  it with care... Sentimental moonshine? My God! The stuff acted like radium!
  It didn't go off with a bang&mdash;but you had to look out! There was no
  question but it would destroy a man who trifled with it! He decided he would
  think twice before he told anyone else. A conviction was taking form in his
  mind that hadn't occurred to Dinny before. An energy as potent as this
  mustn't be trusted in the hands of people without definite instructions
  concerning its nature. He must find out a little more about it before he
  passed it on any further. Canny old Jason had seen the dangers at a glance.
  <i>Anybody who tried to use this dynamic for his own material advantage would
  almost unquestionably burn his fingers!</i></p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Yes&mdash;poor old Clancy had to give up the battle,"
  drawled Mr. Brophy, pushing the mustard-pot across the table. "The beer was
  no good, any more, and cost too much, and, anyway, the old chap had a certain
  self-respect; didn't care to be associated with the young crop of
  bootleggers. So&mdash;he closed up."</p>

  <p>"If they could have had Clancys dispensing beer, all over the country,
  perhaps we would never have come to this pass," observed Dinny. "But the
  thing had got out of bounds, most places. The Clancys were in the
  minority."</p>

  <p>"But there were enough Clancys to justify a bit of steady thinking on that
  subject before the whole liquor industry was turned loose to be operated by
  pick-pockets and safe-crackers!... Well&mdash;it's too late to be owling over
  that tragedy. It's done; we're in for it!... Let's talk about <i>you!</i>
  What brings you here?"</p>

  <p>Dinny had strolled into <i>The Star</i> office at midnight, finding Mr.
  Brophy taking his coat off the peg preparatory to going out for lunch. After
  a warm welcome, or as warm as was to be expected of the unexcitable editor,
  who was not given much to hysteria, Dinny went back into the composing-room
  and renewed old acquaintance with the four or five who remained. Old Timmy
  Fagan had died.</p>

  <p>"Shall we go over and see Clancy?" asked Dinny, when they were out on the
  street.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that's a speakeasy now," growled Brophy. "I don't like the
  people who run it. They'd sell you a stroke of paralysis for a dollar. We'll
  drop in here at Ketolphus's place. You like Greeks, I recall."</p>

  <p>"I came out this way on several errands," said Dinny, replying to Mr.
  Brophy's inquiry. "I'm on a sort of peace commission."</p>

  <p>"Didn't suppose you went in for that kind of thing, Dinny."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it has been rather out of my line."</p>

  <p>Brophy grinned.</p>

  <p>"Out of your line!... You've been a young hell-cat! Whoever sent you out
  with the impression that you were a cooing dove? You've been a storm centre
  so far back as I can recall... Well&mdash;let's hear all about it."</p>

  <p>It would be interesting to try it out on Mr. Brophy. The chances of his
  accepting it, to his damage, were as nothing is related to everything. Dinny,
  somewhat obscure and hesitant with the preliminaries&mdash;for his auditor's
  impassive face held out no promise of sympathetic
  comprehension&mdash;reported quite fully on his strange legacy and his recent
  experiences in so far as he could without violating confidences.</p>

  <p>Brophy had smoked, stolidly, and listened.</p>

  <p>"My son," he said, gravely, when the narrative had reached the point of
  highest ecstasy for Dinny, and highest density for the white-haired Brophy,
  "you've been working too hard. It's a natural penalty for philosophizing.
  You've made it your job, for years, to find out how much is the matter with
  the world. You never tried to treat it for its diseases; you just diagnosed,
  and shook your head, and telephoned for the undertaker. Now you've tired of
  that and are looking for some kind of a patent medicine. I think you're crazy
  as hell, and ought to be in a sanitorium."</p>

  <p>Dinny laughed, heartily, and tapped the end of another cigarette on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"I never felt so well in my life, Mr. Brophy."</p>

  <p>"Any lunatic will tell you that. You'd better have a nice, long talk with
  a reputable psychiatrist. What do you suppose Beaton and those other chaps on
  <i>Hallelujah</i> would think if they knew you were cruising about in this
  state of mind? Why&mdash;you talk like this what's her name... My God!...
  she's no relation of yours, is she?"</p>

  <p>Dinny's attempt to defend himself and his theory was not very
  satisfactory, chiefly for lack of time. Brophy had pressing work to do before
  <i>The Star</i> was put to bed, and made no disguise of his urgent necessity
  to be off.</p>

  <p>When they parted, he was not only cordial but rather disconcertingly
  solicitous. Dinny must have a bit of rest. It was clear he had been working
  too hard, and had let things get on his nerves.</p>

  <p>Back in his room at the hotel, Dinny suffered a moment's reflection that
  people victimized by psychoses are usually unaware of their misfortune.
  However, Spike Davis didn't think him crazy... or did he? His father didn't
  think him crazy, or he would hardly have thrown him out so indifferently. Old
  Jason didn't think him crazy. By Gad&mdash;he was never so sane in his life!
  Of course Brophy couldn't see it. Suppose Brophy had come to <i>him,</i> a
  month ago, with a similar story: what would he have thought of
  <i>Brophy?</i></p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was an exquisite chapel, the gift of Mr. Joel Day in
  memory of his mother. Expense had not been considered. It was a work of
  art.</p>

  <p>Recalling the general stampede of the old days when the ten-fifty bell
  summoned all Magnolians to compulsory prayers in the barn-like,
  taffy-coloured assembly-hall, Dinny was amazed at the apparent reverence with
  which the students filed into the beautiful Gothic structure, dimly lit by
  mellow tints sifted through windows of unquestionable æsthetic value. He was
  struck by the fact that the current crop of Magnolia students was vastly
  superior in appearance and bearing to the hicks of his own collegiate
  generation; then promptly decided that the change was probably within
  himself. His appreciation of almost everything was on the rise; why not his
  respect for Magnolia? There was a rightful place for the little college,
  after all. His long-time disdain of it had been unjust.</p>

  <p>But, even allowing for his own alteration of outlook, Magnolia had
  broadened. There were candles on the altar, and when the college choir
  appeared in the stalls it was appropriately vested. The organ, concealed
  behind chaste grillwork, was playing <i>Ein Feste Burg</i> with skilfully
  conceived variations. It was a good place to be. All the old feeling of
  antagonism toward everything that was Magnolia had vanished. She had suddenly
  become Alma Mater.</p>

  <p>A tall chaplain in academic robes had followed the choir into the chancel,
  approaching the lectern where he stood for a moment with bowed head. Even in
  the uncertain light, Dinny recognized him at once. Doubtless Kling was a
  professor in the Seminary now; a commanding figure, obviously deserving of
  the confidence they had in him. After the service, Dinny would seek him out,
  and the old constraint would be lifted.</p>

  <p>The <i>a cappella</i> choir sang, very impressively, one of Tschaikowsky's
  haunting anthems. With dignity and feeling, Kling began to read the last
  chapter of Ecclesiastes.</p>

  <p>It was as if Dinny listened to the majestic thing for the first time.
  Often he had made some ribald joke that played on "the grasshopper" who,
  perhaps through over-indulgence, had become a "burden." That this ancient
  confession of a cynic was great literature had never occurred to him. What a
  superficial, heady fool he had been! What insufferable impudence! Speaking of
  hicks and yokels, who but an ignoramus could have been guilty of
  impertinences so raw?</p>

  <p>Here was an incomparable pen-portrait of the penalties of such
  sophistication as had all but quenched the springs of Dinny's life. In this
  drab picture, the shutters had been closed, the garden had dried up, the
  porters at the gate sat dully oblivious of the world's activity. In the
  adjacent mill, the sound of the grinding was low. Things were so quiet that
  the voice of a bird startled one. The great palace was all but dead.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, fountains had played, flowers had bloomed, the spacious
  corridors had been flooded with music. The whole institution had throbbed
  with vitality. The joy of life had been drawn up from the inner spring of the
  luminous spirit as if by a silver cord attached to a golden bowl.</p>

  <p>But the magic elixir had not been valued for what it was worth. The silver
  cord had slipped through unheeding fingers and <i>the golden bowl had been
  broken!</i> It was necessary now to go outside one's own gates and seek the
  fountain for one's water-of-life, using the communal pitcher that served
  other unfortunates who had broken their golden bowls. One day <i>that pitcher
  was found broken beside the fountain!</i> There was nothing left, now, but to
  go to the public cistern and stand waiting one's turn; and finally there came
  a day when <i>the wheel was found broken at the cistern!</i></p>

  <p>It was at that exact moment in Orville Kling's sonorous reading of this
  ancient cynic's lament&mdash;as Dinny often confessed, later&mdash;that the
  inspiration suddenly came which produced his monumental story,
  <i>Thirst</i>&mdash;a book so gripping that it was carried to the farthest
  corners of the literate earth; laughed over, wept over, prayed over by
  hundreds of thousands who, though hosts of them may have broken their golden
  bowls, or had been so unfortunate as to have found the pitcher broken at the
  fountain, resolved they would see to it that the wheel was not broken at the
  cistern!</p>

  <p>When Kling had finished his reading, and closed the Book, he prayed. Every
  head was bowed; Dinny's, too. He found himself simple-heartedly grateful for
  the mental guidance of the man for whom he had long nourished a sullen
  hatred. There was a benediction while they sat in reverence; then, after a
  moment's absolute silence, the congregation stirred, rose, and quietly
  departed. But Dinny was too deeply moved to lift his head. A feeling of great
  exultation swept the strings of his soul. There had been laid on him a
  commission. He had been appointed an apostle to them whose gardens were
  wilting, whose silver cords were slipping, whose golden bowls were in danger
  of breaking.</p>

  <p>The organ had returned to its versatile adventures with the courageous
  score of "A Mighty Fortress is Our God." Dinny's eyes were suffused with a
  rush of hot tears. His heart was pounding. His consciousness of his new
  responsibility was almost more than he could bear.</p>

  <p>"Lookit, Gramp!... at <i>Dinny Brumm!"</i></p>

  <p>"What's the matter... Did he upset his vinegar jug?"</p>

  <p>"No!... Lookit!... <i>Lookit!"</i></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was not an ideal evening for a stroll. The air was damp
  and uncomfortably chilly. Apparently it had been raining very hard, a little
  earlier, for the wet leaves on the sidewalks were laid in semi-circular
  festoons as if swept there at the turn of a tide, and the gutters were filled
  with tight-packed, soggy piles of them.</p>

  <p>But Dinny wanted to move about under his own power. The rough voyage had
  been tedious, and the trip from Cherbourg had tried his patience, for now
  that he was nearing his journey's end he was eager to have done with it and
  proceed to the singular errand that had brought him so far.</p>

  <p>It was too late to locate Tommy and Joan tonight. To-morrow, pursuant to
  the advice he had secured from Lacey's, he would endeavour to connect with
  Tommy through their Paris office. If lucky, he might have the contemplated
  visit with the honeymooners before the day was out. Next morning he would run
  up to Calais, and so to London, where he had already engaged a room at the
  Victoria.</p>

  <p>Descending the steps of the Continental, Dinny sauntered up and down the
  arcaded block, strolled over to the Place Vendôme and back again to Rue de
  Rivoli, wondering how he might amuse himself for the remainder of the
  evening.</p>

  <p>On impulse he took a taxi and drove across the river. On Raspail, a little
  below Saint-Germain, he decided to get out and walk. After ten minutes of
  aimless rambling, he sighted a café that seemed more active than any he had
  seen.</p>

  <p>Pleasurably recognizing its name, for he had often heard of "The Dome" and
  its popularity with Americans, he turned in among the little iron-legged
  tables that cluttered the sidewalk, found one unoccupied, ordered a glass of
  sauterne to ensure his welcome, and leisurely took stock of the amiable
  crowd, most of whom were youthful, many of whom were reminiscent of the
  Greenwich Village habitués, and all of whom&mdash;with one single exception
  in sight&mdash;appeared to be in a more or less festive mood.</p>

  <p>The unaccompanied woman who sat facing him, a little distance away, took
  no interest in her neighbours. She did not appear to be in acute trouble, but
  was downcast, meditatively toying with a half-empty glass of something that
  looked like cognac. Hers was not a problem of poverty, for she was the
  best-dressed person there. She could have pawned the silver mesh handbag on
  her table for enough to put her up at the Ritz for a few days, and the price
  of her black fur coat would have kept her in good comfort for six months.</p>

  <p>In a moment their eyes met briefly, and, because hers were unmistakably
  American eyes and full of loneliness, Dinny was faintly conscious that his
  face must have reacted a bit to his recognition of the fact that they were
  fellow-countrymen. If she noticed the fleeting smile in his eyes, she made no
  response to it, abstractedly returning to her pensive fingering of the
  glass.</p>

  <p>Dinny found it difficult to detach himself from her, and studied her face
  with interest. In her depression, she looked forty. Later, when she smiled,
  five years vanished magically. She was a lady&mdash;with a story; no doubt of
  that. But it was not necessarily a sordid or discreditable story, for though
  her face was sad, it was not hard and it was not ashamed.</p>

  <p>She glanced up now, smiled faintly as their eyes momentarily met again,
  drained her glass casually, and drew the collar of her fur coat more snugly
  about her neck. Doubtless she was on the point of leaving now, and Dinny was
  half-glad. Her dejection was dampening his own spirits, already low enough,
  for, as the distance lessened between him and the courage-testing event that
  had invited him to Paris, the more sensitive he became to his irreparable
  loss. He had moments when he wondered whether he would be able to go through
  with it.</p>

  <p>Rising slowly, she took up her expensive bag from the table, and, with
  eyes regarding him inquisitively, came over to Dinny, paused, laid a
  black-gloved hand on the back of the vacant chair. He rose instantly, and
  invited her to sit down. She did so, with entire self-possession, folding her
  arms on the table.</p>

  <p>"Were you surprised, Dinny, when you found my note?"</p>

  <p>"Janet!&mdash;my dear!"</p>

  <p>He reached out both hands to hers.</p>

  <p>"You didn't recognize me," she said, ruefully. "I must have changed more
  than I had thought."</p>

  <p>"But it has been so long, dear, and of course I wasn't expecting to see
  you, and&mdash;you've bobbed your hair, haven't you? It's quite becoming,
  Janet."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I've changed. I know that, Dinny. The game I've been playing
  alters one."</p>

  <p>"How does it compare with&mdash;wheel-barrow?"</p>

  <p>"Less exciting. Much slower than chess; and if you win, there's no
  prize."</p>

  <p>"It wears the players out, you mean?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, with just a faint recovery of the Janet look of quick
  understanding.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. The players are worn out, and it's after midnight, and finally
  one of them makes the last move, which both had seen coming for an hour,
  and&mdash;the game's over. The guest yawns and goes, and the drowsy host
  calls in the cat and puts out the milk-bottle. And that's all. Not very
  stimulating, would you say?"</p>

  <p>"Where is he now, Janet? Want to talk about it?"</p>

  <p>"As for wanting to&mdash;no. But I'll tell you. We separated more than a
  year ago. Oscar returned to the States for a while. He is in Florence now; or
  was, the last I heard from him."</p>

  <p>"Who won the game?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged slightly and dismissed the query with a lazy little flick of
  her fingers.</p>

  <p>"I believe I made the last move, but by that time we were both too
  indifferent to care, or to remember&mdash;certainly not with any pride of
  victory, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Humiliation of defeat," assisted Dinny, comprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure there wasn't some humiliation," confessed Janet, after a
  pause, "even for the winner&mdash;if I won."</p>

  <p>"The money part&mdash;maybe?" Dinny wondered.</p>

  <p>Janet nodded.</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask? The story will surely bore you, and it makes me unhappy
  to remember."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes it helps a little to talk things over, dear."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I fancy you know that Mr. Day divorced me, as of course he
  should. Along with word of that came notification that he had made over a
  great many valuable securities to me. I declined them, through our attorneys,
  but Mr. Day's decision remained unchanged. You may recall that Mr. Day's
  temperament was not to be described as&mdash;as vacillating, or
  volatile."</p>

  <p>Janet's drawling understatement left so very much unsaid that Dinny
  laughed, appreciatively. She had not changed, after all.</p>

  <p>"The dividends kept coming along," continued Janet, in an even tone, "and
  I used them, reluctantly at first.... And then, when Oscar and I
  parted&mdash;it was mostly my fault, for I think I was the one who remarked
  that we both knew we were weary of each other&mdash;he gave me his blessing
  and three thousand shares of T. and T."</p>

  <p>"You're well provided for, dear."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I have almost everything anyone would want except
  self-respect, and I've been doing without that for so long I hardly miss it."
  She had tried to make this last sound dryly cynical, and ended it with a
  twisted little smile.</p>

  <p>"Janet," said Dinny, soberly, "you've broken your golden bowl!"</p>

  <p>She lowered her eyes, and nodded; then glanced up, inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"What's this&mdash;about a golden bowl, Dinny?"</p>

  <p>"It was attached to a silver cord," he explained cryptically. "And
  whenever you wanted happiness, you drew it up from the spring. I'm afraid
  you've let the silver cord slip through your hands."</p>

  <p>"Is that what that means&mdash;'Or ever the silver cord be loosed, and the
  golden bowl be broken'? I never knew." She laughed, quietly. "Since when did
  you go in for such philosophy, Dinny? I've read enough of your hellish
  satires to know that you're not in the golden-bowl business."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to tell you all about it, Janet. You say you've changed. I
  wonder that you recognized me! It's quite a long story."</p>

  <p>She pushed back her chair.</p>

  <p>"Suppose we go over to the Crillon&mdash;I live there&mdash;and sit in the
  lounge. And you can begin at the beginning, and tell me everything.... But
  you won't scold me; will you, dear?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Dinny's heart was beating furiously, and his mouth was dry,
  as he paced nervously to and fro near the little elevator. The shaft of it,
  rising from the lobby, was a mere skeleton of ornamental wrought-iron
  curlycues, and one could see the descending occupants long before they
  arrived on the ground floor.</p>

  <p>At any moment now, Tommy would be coming down, and Joan, too, more than
  likely, for it was nearly ten and she would undoubtedly be up and dressed for
  the day.</p>

  <p>They would greet him with a brave show of cordiality, trying hard to cover
  their mystification with a rapid fire of questions. "Why&mdash;of all
  things!&mdash;Dinny Brumm!"... "How lovely to see you here!"... "Where are
  you stopping? When did you come? How nice of you to look us up!" But
  underneath all the friendly racket, how much of constraint would there be? It
  had not been difficult to locate them. At nine-thirty, Dinny had telephoned
  Lacey's office. Yes&mdash;Mr. Forsythe was in town, stopping at the Regina.
  Perhaps he had not left yet; might catch him there. It was only a step over
  from the Continental.</p>

  <p>"Down in two minutes, old chap!" Tommy had answered, on the house
  telephone. "Powerfully glad you're here! Delightful surprise!"</p>

  <p>Was it, really? Dinny wished he could be more certain of that.</p>

  <p>The little elevator had again slipped slowly upward through the gold
  ceiling. And now&mdash;a few frantic weeks of waiting having elapsed&mdash;it
  was coming down, bringing Tommy's long legs, broad shoulders, expectant
  smile. Dinny was steadied and comforted, a little, by the smile.</p>

  <p>"This is certainly a great treat, Dinny!" Tommy gave him a comradely thump
  on the shoulder, and beamed.</p>

  <p>"I'm on my way to London," explained Dinny, hastily, as if his train were
  waiting. "It occurred to me I'd like to have a glimpse of you and
  Joan&mdash;for old sake's sake&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Joan?" echoed Tommy, happily. "Is she here, too?"</p>

  <p>"My God&mdash;Tommy! You don't mean to tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tommy stared, uncomprehendingly, for a moment, and then grinned.</p>

  <p>"You didn't think we were here together, did you? The last I saw of Joan
  was the night before I sailed in September."</p>

  <p>They were standing near a little gilt and scarlet divan; and Dinny, whose
  knees were shaky, sat down, Tommy joining him, much amused by his sudden
  collapse.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," resumed Tommy, "Joan has been much on my mind, these past
  few weeks. She vanished, the same day I left. She did not show up at the
  store, next morning. They made inquiries without results."</p>

  <p>"Had anything happened," inquired Dinny, huskily, "to account for it? Do
  you suppose some harm has come to her?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you all I know," said Tommy, soberly, after a moment's delay.
  "I suppose you've a right to all the information there is."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Her Uncle Jim ought to know where she is!" shouted Dinny,
  excitedly. "Perhaps she's there! She went to him once before when she was in
  trouble. I'll cable!"</p>

  <p>"I'll go along. You're not fit to be at large, Dinny. You'll get yourself
  run over. Buck up now! You look like a ghost. We'll find her. Uncle Jim will
  know&mdash;if you can get it out of him."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He knew that Janet and Tommy were amusing themselves at his
  expense, as the boat-train started. Tommy had said something funny to her,
  and nodded toward him, as he waved from the window of his compartment. She
  had laughed, gaily. Had anyone ever heard of so good a joke? A round trip
  from New York to Paris for information about his girl!&mdash;information he
  might have had for ninety cents if he had queried Uncle Jim in the first
  place.</p>

  <p>The three of them had lunched together. Dinny well satisfied over the
  prompt congeniality of Janet and Tommy, whose amiable chatter left him
  without much responsibility for the talk. He had never been in such a state
  of utter rout, mentally. Uncle Jim's cable had not arrived until nearly four.
  After that there had been a great panic about getting Dinny aboard the first
  ship. The <i>Olympic</i> was due to call at Cherbourg at eleven. He could
  just make it.</p>

  <p>The train was increasing its strides now. Dinny's hands trembled as he
  took the cablegram from his pocket. Bless old Uncle Jim! He had come through
  without a moment's delay. The message was brief, but illuminating.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">ABERCROMBIES DENVER</p><br>

  <p>Tommy had fortunately been able to fill in the details. He remembered Mr.
  Abercrombie's call at Lacey's, and his unusual interest in Joan.</p>

  <p>It was a long trip to Cherbourg, and the <i>Olympic</i> was exasperatingly
  slow getting herself persuaded to draw up the anchor and amble on toward the
  west. Dinny wondered, as he stood at the rail, whether it would help things
  along if he volunteered assistance.... What? Another big netful of mail-bags?
  What did so many people have to write about that was so important?</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">There was a telegram from Janet at the purser's office when
  he called to arrange for his passage.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">TOMMY TELLS ME MUCH TO DO FOR SHOP GIRLS IN NEW YORK STOP
  PERHAPS CAN USE MONEY MENDING BROKEN BOWLS PITCHERS CISTERN WHEELS STOP THANK
  YOU DEAR FOR COMING STOP KISS JOAN FOR ME STOP TOMMY ADJACENT SAYS ME TOO
  STOP LUCKY DEVIL</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Every day en route Dinny composed radiograms to Joan by the
  dozen, informing her he was on the way and hurrying as fast as possible. None
  of them was sent. He couldn't explain, by radio, that he was ready now to
  keep his promises, several times broken, nor dare he risk frightening her
  away from Denver with the announcement that he was about to press his
  claim.</p>

  <p>The <i>Olympic</i> might have been an old square-rigged three-master from
  the way she wallowed and plodded as if it was of no concern to her whether
  she ever reached New York or not; but one morning, after ages and ages, she
  nosed her way into her berth, and at two Dinny was on the train, composing
  speeches for Joan... The <i>darling!</i></p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He had firmly decided, after much debate, that he would not
  attempt to see Joan at the store. He would call on Mr. Abercrombie, briefly
  explain his mission, and Mr. Abercrombie would give him Joan's street
  address. From what Tommy had said about the fine old fellow, that seemed
  quite reasonable.</p>

  <p>The train arrived shortly after three, and Dinny went directly to the big
  store. Mr. Abercrombie listened with interest.</p>

  <p>"We should be very sorry to lose Miss Braithwaite," he said. "But I'm
  afraid I couldn't stop you, even if I tried. So&mdash;find her, my boy, and
  good luck to you."</p>

  <p>He sent a message to her house from the Blackstone, asking her to give him
  a ring at the earliest moment, and waited in a state of near-lunacy.
  Six-twenty!&mdash;twenty-five!&mdash;thirty! Joan should be at home by this
  time. He sat near the telephone, ready to leap to it.</p>

  <p>At seven, unable to endure another minute of this torture, he called her
  house. The voice replied cheerfully, "Hold the line, please," and a little
  later said sympathetically, "Sorry&mdash;but Miss Braithwaite is out."</p>

  <p>He sat for a long time with the telephone in his hands, wondering what
  next to do. His hopes were tumbling to pieces.</p>

  <p>At eight, he resolved that nothing was to be gained by moping in his room,
  and was putting on his coat to go down when a letter was delivered by
  messenger. He opened it, in a panic of apprehension.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Dinny:<br>
  <br>
  You and I have caused each other a great deal of misery. And nothing could be
  easier for us to do than keep on making ourselves and each other utterly
  wretched until one of us died or ran away.<br>
  <br>
  I'm not going to pretend that I'm happy, but I'm busy, and I like my work. It
  cost a good deal to decide that it was better for us never to see each other
  any more. But, having made that decision, I know it is to your best interest,
  and mine, that I stick to it. You know I would love to see you; but, Dinny, I
  can't go through it again!<br>
  <br>
  Please don't try to persuade me. Here is once when I'm certain that I know
  what's best for us.</p>

  <p class="letter">Ever yours,<br>
  JOAN</p><br>

  <p>After a half-hour of suffering, Dinny resolved to play the last card in
  his hand.</p>

  <p>He went to the desk, and wrote:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dearest Joan:<br>
  <br>
  I'm not asking you to renew friendship with the Dinny Brumm of the Green
  Cheese and "Hallelujah." It may be hard for you to believe, but I'm
  definitely done with all that. I am just learning to walk. I need you as
  never before, and I love you desperately.<br>
  <br>
  You will find enclosed a letter that I found secreted in an old desk that was
  the property of my mother. Please read it, dear. I have made the experiment
  that Julia recommended to me. And it has worked!<br>
  <br>
  Do let me see you, if only for a moment, tomorrow!</p>

  <p class="letter">Loving you dearly <br>
  DINNY</p><br>

  <p>Having dispatched the letter to Joan's address, he went down and walked
  the streets for an hour. He remembered that he had had no dinner, but was not
  hungry enough to care. Returning at length to his room, he went to bed, and,
  utterly exhausted with the long strain, drifted off into a troubled
  sleep.</p>

  <p>How long the telephone had been ringing he could only guess. The insistent
  demand had been punctuating a series of dreams in which he was being
  entreated, urged, belaboured, to respond to some desperate situation.
  Half-awake, he groped for the instrument, noting, as he turned on the light,
  that it was half-past five.</p>

  <p>"Dinny!" Joan's voice was very low, and broken.</p>

  <p>"Yes, darling."</p>

  <p>"Dinny&mdash;I'm afraid I can't wait till morning."</p>

  <p>"Come on down here, then... I'll meet you in the lobby."</p>

  <p>"Would that be too dreadful?... What would people think?"</p>

  <p>"Hang the people!... Oh, Joan!... My dear!"</p>

  <p>There was a considerable pause.</p>

  <p>"Very well... I'll come... Half an hour... Good-bye."</p>

  <p>Dinny found himself laughing aloud, half-hysterically, as he dressed. He
  bet his last dollar nothing like this had ever happened before. His fingers
  were clumsy as he wrestled with his collar. Joan was coming! He glanced out
  of the window. There was a faint dawn-glow.</p>

  <p>The lobby of the hotel was deserted except for a sleepy clerk at the desk,
  and two old fellows with damp mops scrubbing the tiled floor.</p>

  <p>Dinny stood just inside the revolving door, and waited.</p>

  <p>A taxi drew up. He rushed out to meet it, opened the door, stepped in.</p>

  <p>After a while the taxi-driver closed the door with a bang, but whatever
  hint it was intended to convey had been too subtle for his passengers.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, he opened the door again, and said:</p>

  <p>"I'm goin' across here for a cup of coffee and a doughnut. And if the cop
  gives me a ticket for parkin', I'll expect you to pay for it!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">There was a very simple little wedding that afternoon at
  five. Joan had made no objection to its immediacy. She was beside herself
  with happiness, and whatever Dinny wanted to do, no matter how impetuously
  arrived at, was acceptable.</p>

  <p>At breakfast, Dinny said:</p>

  <p>"What would we be waiting for, I'd like to know, if we waited another
  day?"</p>

  <p>"That's so," agreed Joan. "It would be silly, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>"This afternoon, then?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"And go away&mdash;directly afterwards."</p>

  <p>"As you like, dear."</p>

  <p>"Far off... somewhere on a ship... around the world, maybe. That's a great
  thought, Joan. We'll go 'round the world... Want to? We can, you know."</p>

  <p>"I'd love to, Dinny."</p>

  <p>"Why are you smiling?"</p>

  <p>"I'm happy."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it was something more than happy. Tell me."</p>

  <p>"I was just remembering," said Joan, "what a gypsy girl told me, a few
  months ago. I was soon to go on a long 'jorney' with a tall man on a 'beeg'
  ship."</p>

  <p>"By Gad, Joan, I was afraid you had!... We'll take the first train out,
  after we're married. Right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;we couldn't go any sooner than that."</p>

  <p>"To San Francisco... and sail! Agreed?"</p>

  <p>"Let's!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The lobby of the Saint Francis was astir with dinner guests
  arriving for a banquet when Dinny and Joan came down from the room they had
  occupied for an hour. It was a newspaper affair, they learned. Zandy Craig
  was meeting the entire <i>Enquirer</i> outfit and a score of prominent
  citizens.</p>

  <p>"There's Alison, darling," exclaimed Dinny, as a half-dozen modishly
  gowned women stepped out of the adjoining elevator. "We must speak to
  her."</p>

  <p>She turned as if she had overheard her name spoken, and joined them with a
  little ejaculation of happy surprise.</p>

  <p>"Dinny!... You don't mean to tell me you've managed to persuade this
  lovely&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Joan, please meet my sister." Dinny was ecstatic.</p>

  <p>"I would give anything for a couple of minutes with you, Alison," murmured
  Joan. "But you're going to the dinner, and I mustn't detain you."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'm not. Father couldn't be bothered with mere women at his
  parties. Do you want to tell me something that won't keep another
  minute?"</p>

  <p>"We're sailing in the morning. I may not have another chance." Joan seemed
  much disappointed.</p>

  <p>Alison searched her eyes with an inquisitive glance, and fleetingly
  regarded Dinny with a similar inspection.</p>

  <p>"Very well. I'll talk to you now. We'll step over into the lounge. ...
  Will you wait for me, a few minutes, Mrs. Baumgarten? I'll not be long."</p>

  <p>They disappeared, Joan's hand tucked under Alison's arm. Dinny was very
  proud of them. They were thoroughbreds!</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later, when they rejoined him, they were smiling as if the
  interview had been mutually pleasant. Alison collected her party and hurried
  away.</p>

  <p>"Big secret, Joan?" queried Dinny, consumed by curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Don't try to make me tell you, dear; not yet."</p>

  <p>"I'll wait, but don't keep me at it too long!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Returning from the theatre, which they had found rather
  tame, for it had concerned itself with the tribulations of a pair who were
  put to tremendous bother and expense to find each other after a long
  misunderstanding, they went to their room and were bending over an array of
  cruise literature, outspread on the table, when the telephone rang.</p>

  <p>"It's for me," said Joan, taking up the instrument... "Yes, Alison...
  That's wonderful!... Now?... Nine-sixty-seven?... I'll be up in two minutes!"
  She put down the telephone on the table, and smiled into Dinny's eyes. "I've
  an engagement, dear, for a little talk with&mdash;can you guess?"</p>

  <p>"That's marvellous, Joan. Hope you'll not be disappointed."</p>

  <p>"May I take Julia's letter along?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know who has a better right to it."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Joan had been gone for more than an hour. Dinny had tried to
  pass the time by studying the itinerary of the long journey on which they
  were about to embark.</p>

  <p>Utterly unable to command his thoughts or concentrate his attention on the
  gaudy promises of the illustrated prospectus, he sat staring at the wall,
  wondering how Joan was making out with her strange adventure. It would be
  quite a monstrous pity if anything had happened to distress her. She had been
  barely touching the ground with her toes. Never had he seen anyone so
  radiant!</p>

  <p>There was a peremptory summons from the telephone. Joan's voice sounded as
  if she had been deeply stirred.</p>

  <p>"Come up here, dear, please... Room nine hundred and sixty-seven; I'll
  wait here for you."</p>

  <p>Joan and Alison met him at the elevator, when he arrived. They had both
  been crying recently, he thought. They parted as he came toward them and,
  turning, each took an arm. He waited for them to speak, but they had nothing
  to say as they piloted him down the long corridor.</p>

  <p>At the door they stopped, and released him.</p>

  <p>Dinny looked inquiringly from one to the other.</p>

  <p>Alison turned the knob, pushed the door open a little way, patted Dinny
  affectionately on the arm, and stepped aside.</p>

  <p>"He is waiting for you, Dinny," she said, softly.</p>

  <p>Joan put her arm about his neck, and, standing on tiptoe, whispered,
  brokenly:</p>

  <p>"Be very tender, dear."</p>
