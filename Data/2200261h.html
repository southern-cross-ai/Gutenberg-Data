<p class="first">JAMES FRANCIS DWYER (1874-1952) was an Australian writer. Born in Camden Park, New South Wales, Dwyer worked as a postal assistant until he was convicted in a scheme to make fraudulent postal orders and sentenced to seven years imprisonment in 1899. In prison, Dwyer began writing, and with the help of another inmate and a prison guard, had his work published in <i>The Bulletin</i>. After completing his sentence, he relocated to London and then New York, where he established a successful career as a writer of short stories and novels. Dwyer later moved to France, where he wrote his autobiography, <i>Leg-Irons on Wings</i>, in 1949. Dwyer wrote over 1,000 short stories during his career, and was the first Australian-born person to become a millionaire from writing. &mdash;<span class="smcap">Wikipedia</span></p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE BRONZE TIGER</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>The American Magazine</i>, June 1913</h3>

<p class="chaphead">A Story of American Men in the Valley  of Golan Ra and<br>
Their Encounter with the Tiger of Other Men's Gods.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">CURTIS, the American consul, took this story
down in longhand the day I staggered into his office. And Curtis
believed it, too. He brought me round to his club, bought me a
meal and a peg of brandy, gave me a suit of drill and a
hand-shake that nearly cracked my knuckles.</p>

<p>"Don't tell it too often when you get back to our country," he
said. "Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>Curtis laughed grimly and looked about him. "Well, they
wouldn't get the atmosphere," he said, "and atmosphere is
everything when it comes to believing a story. If you told that
yarn in a club on Fifth Avenue&mdash;No, I'm wrong. They'd
believe you! The darn thing drips truth!"</p>

<p>That was a compliment from Curtis. He doubted everybody, but
he believed me. He gave me clothes, a meal, and a hand-shake, and
he said that the yarn dripped truth. I don't know if it does, but
here's the story:</p>

<p>I met Masterson at Singapore. He was American on the father's
side, I'm sure of that. As to his mother&mdash;well, the consul
told me that day in his office, that Masterson's grandmother was
a Shan-Talok woman from the head of the Meinam. I don't know.
There may have been a streak of color in Masterson, but I didn't
notice it.</p>

<p>Masterson was going up into the hills above Kopah to collect
specimens, and I went with him as an assistant. I dislike
work&mdash;that is, hard work&mdash;but you can't panhandle the
Malay. The East is the real home of old Ma Poverty. Starvation
walks around with a <i>chawat</i> round its loins, and Mr. Death
works overtime. That's why I went to work helping Masterson
gather specimens of snakes, lizards, bugs, and other things in
the hills above Kopah.</p>

<p>"It's nice and interesting work," he said.</p>

<p>"For the lizards and bugs," I snapped. "They're being put in
bottles and sent to America; we've got to stay to do the
recruiting work."</p>

<p>That was a nasty bit of country round there. Body o' me! Yes!
There are some places in the world that are worse than opium. I
mean they're more dangerous. The blamed drug is in the air, in
the hot dawns, in the white sunlight, and the velvety nights. I
know it. And those hills above Kopah were worse than any other
spot I had struck. That place was too old. There were wandering
whiffs of perfume in those hills that got right into the back of
my head and rooted out memories that must have been there for
centuries&mdash;for a score of centuries most likely. They
stirred up desires and dreams that must have belonged to
ancestors of mine who lived when the mammoth was ornamenting the
landscape. Curtis, the American consul, understood when I told
him about it. Curtis had been in the East for fourteen years, and
he had lost a lot of the cocksureness that he had taken from
Washington.</p>

<p>"This country is hell," said I to Masterson. "It looks as dead
as Pharaoh's chariot mules, and yet it is alive."</p>

<p>He was bottling a krait, one of those deadly little snakes
that lie around in the sand with their heads out waiting to bite
anyone or anything that comes near, and he grinned at me.</p>

<p>"The Siyins say that the little grains of sand talk to each
other," he said, "and I believe the Siyins are right. Yes, it's
alive all right."</p>

<p>That place made me sick. It was the sort of place that the
Specters of the Lonely Places would pick for a convention ground.
It was so. I tried to whistle "Dixie" once or twice in that
Valley of Golan Ra, but I gave it up. That spot was too unhealthy
for whistling.</p>

<p>We were fixing our tents one afternoon when a real specter
came down from the hills above that valley. He was a Burmese
monk, and he was a fright. Body o' me! Yes! He was naked except
for a dirty waist-cloth; his hair stood out around his head like
a thorny halo, and his finger nails were twelve inches long. He
was in keeping with the surroundings all right. He was just the
sort of apparition you would expect to run across in a place like
that.</p>

<p>Masterson spoke to him in the Malay lingo, and he replied in
English. Good English, too. Said he was a Buddhist monk from
Moulmein, and lived in a little cave high up in the sandstone
rocks.</p>

<p>"And why do you stay in this place?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is a sacred place," he answered. "Buddha rested here on
the way to the Temple of Paklan."</p>

<p>"Huh!" I said. "Buddha must have done nothing else but rest.
I've seen about two hundred bo-trees that mark places where he
squatted."</p>

<p>"But there is more than a bo-tree here," said the monk.</p>

<p>"Why. what's here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The Man-eater of Golan Ra," he answered quietly.</p>

<p>Now I think that Masterson had heard something of that
man-eater before the monk mentioned him. I'm nearly sure he had.
The moment the apparition mentioned the thing, Masterson dropped
his specimen-box and came closer to the freak. His eyes were
mighty scared-looking too.</p>

<p>"Did that happen here?" he asked.</p>

<p>The freak nodded his head. "It happened right here," he
murmured.</p>

<p>"Let the story loose," I said. "I have never heard it."
Afterward I was sorry that I had asked that greasy monk to tell
the yarn, but feeling sorry for an action does no good.</p>

<p>That fakir was some story-teller. Holy St. Christopher, wasn't
he! That yarn went into my brain through every hair I had in my
head. He chanted it like a Batta chanting a war-song, and I just
gasped as I sat on the hot sand and listened. Masterson was
pop-eyed, too. That monk was a devil of a story-teller.</p>

<p>He said that Buddha had rested at that place on his way to the
Temple of Paklan. Budd was tired, mighty tired. He sat down in
the shade to rest himself, and while he was sitting there a big
man-eating tiger came down from the sandstone ridges and peeped
at him from behind a thorn bush. Peeped at Buddha, mind you!</p>

<p>Do you know that funny music the orchestra grinds out when
they want to give the audience cold shivers down its back? Well,
that monk could do that stunt with his voice. Wow, couldn't he
just! He soft-pedaled on the descriptive business concerning that
tiger peeking round the bush till he had Masterson and me
rubbering at the stunted cactus clumps, thinking that another
tiger might be peeping at us. The Oriental is the greatest
storyteller in the world. He puts shadows into his stories, and
those shadow masses stir your imagination just the way it should
be stirred. And that fakir in the Valley of Golan Ra was the boss
of all the narrators we had ever met. That tiger liked the look
of Buddha. Buddha was fat, and the tiger was hungry. The brute
was a bit of a gourmet, and he had grown tired of eating skinny
Negritos. They gave him indigestion. He licked his chops as he
watched the fat saint mumbling his prayers, and he breathed so
excitedly that old Buddha heard him and looked up.</p>

<p>The tiger sort of grinned at Buddha, but Buddha took no
notice. He was busy thinking out some mighty big problems, and he
had no time for grinning at tigers. That's what the fakir said.
The boss monk in the Temple of Paklan had been grafting a little,
and the saint was thinking out a plan to fix him.</p>

<p>That greasy monk was an actor of the first water. </p>

<p>Wow, wasn't he a dandy! He put up a piece of rock to represent
Buddha, while he took the part of Mr. Tiger, and all the time he
was pouring out the descriptive matter.</p>

<p>The tiger came out from behind the bush and walked forward a
little. He thought that Buddha might be a little short-sighted.
That brute had been in the habit of seeing Malays and Negritos
bolt in every direction when he poked his head around a corner,
and he was just a little bit surprised to see old Budd still
juggling with his prayer-cord. It hurt his vanity to see a
respectable old gentleman ignore him completely, and he gave a
little growl to show the saint that he was a real full-grown
specimen of a hill tiger.</p>

<p>That growl annoyed Buddha. At least, the fakir said that it
annoyed him. The tiger had a breath, and the growl sent the odor
of that breath under the saint's nose. He stopped praying and
waved the tiger away, but the tiger's stomach was troubling him
too much at that moment. Buddha looked fat and sweet to him. He
crept a little closer, and the saint got mad. I'm just telling
what that monk told to Masterson and myself in the Valley of
Golan Ra.</p>

<p>"Go back!" said Buddha, but the tiger only drew his lips back
in a sneer. I guess he thought that Buddha was having a little
joke before he handed in his checks.</p>

<p>"Go back to the hills!" cried the saint. "Go back at
once!"</p>

<p>But that tiger had no word like retreat in his dictionary. Not
much. He just walloped his ribs furiously with the end of his
tail and crouched on his haunches before making a spring at the
saint.</p>

<p>Buddha was as cool as a mudfish according to the story of the
monk. He just eyed the tiger, and the tiger returned the stare.
That fool brute was wondering why Buddha didn't pick up his gown
and bolt across the sand. That was what the Negritos used to do,
and it always amused the tiger to do a little run after them
before making an evening meal off them.</p>

<p>"Now," said Buddha, "if you spring you will be sorry, very
sorry."</p>

<p>The tiger, so the monk reckoned, stiffened his muscles and
licked his chops. Buddha's threats didn't frighten him much. He
gave one little growl as a signal to himself to be ready, another
little growl as a signal to be steady, and when he gave the third
little growl he lifted himself into the air. But Buddha did
something at that moment. Mind you, this part of the yarn is not
mine, I'm only telling what the monk said in that dead Valley of
Golan Ra. And that monk was a champion at telling a story. When
he got up to the part where the tiger was going to hop at Buddha,
he had us fairly creepy with curiosity. Yes, sir! That was no bit
of fiction as far as he was concerned. It was twenty-two carat
gospel, and that was why he was able to make us shiver like
frozen hoboes when he got to the climax.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," gasped Masterson, "what happened then?"</p>

<p>"Why," said the monk, sinking his voice till it was only a
whisper, "when Buddha lifted his hand the tiger's spring was
arrested. He stopped in midair. It was as if he were petrified
instantly, and as Buddha continued to pray the old man-eater was
turned slowly to bronze. Into bronze, sirs. He became a piece of
statuary, his body erect, his fore paws stretched out, and only
the pads of his hind feet on the ground."</p>

<p>I don't know whether it was the surroundings that made us
scared, or whether it was the manner in which that fakir told the
story, but when he finished we were pop-eyed. Wow, yes! There was
never a story-teller like that Buddhist monk, and there was never
a place that fitted so well as a background for such a yarn as
that weird Valley.</p>

<p>Masterson didn't speak for a few minutes after the freak had
finished his story, then he moistened his lips and put a
question.</p>

<p>"Where is the tiger that was turned into bronze?" he
asked.</p>

<p>I expected that monk to say that someone had stolen that
statue, but I got a surprise&mdash;a mighty big surprise. He just
turned and waved his skinny hand toward a patch of thorn that was
about five hundred yards away, and said simply, "He is out
there."</p>

<p>It's hard to make anyone feel what we felt in that wilderness.
Curtis, the American consul, understood, but he had been fourteen
years in that God-forsaken country.</p>

<p>"Show him to us," said Masterson.</p>

<p>It was dusk then, the curious tropical dusk that comes down
like a purple veil before the thick night swoops down. The monk
started to walk toward that patch of thorn, and Masterson and I
followed. Masterson was all nerves at that moment. The day had
affected him more than it had affected me. That air was like
opium to him, and after he had listened to the story he walked
like a man in a dream. If anyone could have canned that
atmosphere of Golan Ra, they could have sold it to dope fiends.
It was one of the most peculiar spots I had ever seen. There are
thousands of places in the tropics that look unhealthy and feel
unhealthy, but the Valley of Golan Ra was vicious. I don't know
if I make my meaning clear by saying that. Curtis understood when
I told him about it.</p>

<p>"I know the atmosphere," he said. "It's poisonous. The country
has been left too much to itself, and it doesn't want a white man
near."</p>

<p>The consul was right. That valley didn't want Masterson or me.
The monk fitted into the surroundings, but we didn't. We knew it,
but we followed that fakir across the sand that was still so hot
that you felt it through the soles of your shoes, and so dry that
you could hear a lizard rustling through it twenty feet away.</p>

<p>The monk circled the clump of cactus and stunted
camel's-thorn, then he stopped and pointed with his
thin hand.</p>

<p>"There he is," he whispered. "There is the Man-eater of Golan
Ra!"</p>

<p>Body o' me! I got a shock when I looked at the spot he pointed
out. The sight we saw hit us so hard that we stopped in our
tracks with our mouths open. I know a little about tigers, so
does Masterson, but the man who modeled the big bronze tiger at
Golan Ra knew more about tigers than all the naturalists between
Penang and Philadelphia. That's the truth. The Kachins of
Northern Burma tell of the tiger-men who live and hunt with the
tigers, and the man who made that statue must have been one of
that breed. He must have lived with tigers. He must have watched
them till he knew every muscle in their bodies. Wow, Wow, Wow!
What a statue it was! It flamed with life.</p>

<p>That was the genius in it. Genius! Why, when we came in front
of that thing we stepped aside in fear!</p>

<p>Someone will cry about Antoine Louis Barye when they read
this. Barye never did anything like that. Never! I've seen a lot
of Barye's work, but I have never seen anything like that tiger.
Holy St. Christopher! No! Barye's tiger in the Tuilleries is not
to be compared with that brute in the wastes of Golan Ra. Barye's
stuff is dead. That tiger in the valley between the hills was so
full of life that you crouched instinctively as you came in front
of him.</p>

<p>I didn't wonder about the Buddha yarn being woven about that
beast. Not much! It was beyond the intelligence of those hill
tribes to think that an artist modeled that thing. They gambled
on supernatural influence, and of course they picked Buddha.
Anyone with the smallest particle of imagination would think that
the brute had been turned into bronze as he was about to
spring.</p>

<p>Masterson looked at me, and swallowed like a pelican. In the
dim light the thing looked uncanny. It did so. And that walking
bag of bones knew that he had handed us a surprise packet.</p>

<p>"In the night," he said, turning to Masterson, "he is very
lonely. He calls to the tigers in the hills, and they come down
and keep him company."</p>

<p>"Who calls?" I snapped.</p>

<p>"Buddha's tiger," said the monk. "He calls to his brothers up
in the sandstone ridges, and they come down to him. There are a
hundred tigers here every night."</p>

<p>The East is a curious place. I wanted to laugh, and I couldn't
laugh. I thought I could rid myself of the irritating fear that
gripped me if I were able to ridicule that old naked fool's
story, but I couldn't raise a grin. The look of that tiger choked
back any laughs that I tried to put forward.</p>

<p>Masterson stooped and looked for tracks in the sand, then he
looked at me with a stupid look on his face. The atmosphere of
that valley had played the mischief with Masterson's nerves. He
looked like a man who has been hit with a sand-bag.</p>

<p>"They come every night," murmured the monk. "They come down to
him when he cries."</p>

<p>"Huh," I grunted, "they're real obliging tigers, ain't they?"
I don't know whether the story or the place upset my courage, but
I was scared&mdash;scared in that curious way when your courage
seems to be penned in a corner fighting against a fear that you
can't get a grip on.</p>

<p>"Do you know that no harm can come to one who is near him?"
asked the monk.</p>

<p>"How?" I growled.</p>

<p>"If anyone places his hand on him and cries out to Buddha, no
harm can come to him," he answered. "No tiger will touch him. The
Holy Buddha has willed it so. Only a few days ago a Malay,
pursued by a tiger, rushed down here from the hills and touched
the statue. When he did so the tiger that was pursuing him ran
away."</p>

<p>You would think that a remark of that kind would make us
laugh, but it didn't. It was getting dark, and that place had a
look that chilled our blood. But we didn't want to show the white
feather in front of that dirty Buddhist monk. Not much! We had
picked up our rifles when leaving the camp: it isn't safe to
wander round without a gun in those hills, and when that fakir
told the story about the tigers coming down from the hills I got
a fool notion into my head to draw his bluff.</p>

<p>Masterson must have got the same idea at the exact moment I
pounced on it. He looked around at a couple of stunted trees that
were about twenty yards from the statue, and then looked at
me.</p>

<p>"We might wait and see if there is any truth in the yarn," he
said. "I mean the tale about the tigers coming down from the
hills."</p>

<p>"Sure," I answered. "We'll wait by all means."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked the monk.</p>

<p>"We're going to stay around and see this tiger gathering," I
said. "We'll build a platform between those two stunted
trees."</p>

<p>"Can I stay?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Stay if you like," said Masterson. "Help us get some timber
together."</p>

<p>Masterson and I worked like madmen collecting timber to build
a platform between those two small trees, and the monk helped us
without speaking. And all the time it was getting darker in that
valley. Darker? Why, it was that dark when we finished the perch
that we felt as if we were crawling through something tangible as
we climbed onto the platform we had hurriedly put together.</p>

<p>We couldn't see the bronze tiger, but we seemed to feel him.
That's a curious way of putting it, but it's the only way that
can explain our sensations. That piece of work had made a mighty
funny impression on us, and we could easily understand how
stories had sprung up about it. In that dreary-waste of sand and
stunted thorn bush that tiger seemed to be the only thing alive.
Alive, mind you! The rocks were dead, the hills were dead, the
cactus and stunted trees, and even the monk, looked as if they
held on to existence by the skin of their teeth, as the saying
is, but the tiger seemed to flame with life.</p>

<p>Genius is a wonderful thing. They tell a story in the Shan
states of a man who made a hamadryad that was so wonderfully
lifelike that the natives died with fear after looking at it, and
I could believe that story after seeing the Tiger of Golan Ra. He
was alive to that greasy monk. Body o' me! Yes! Right in my heart
I knew that the fakir worshiped the thing, and as we crouched on
the shaky platform between the two trees I knew that he was
staring toward the spot where the tiger stood.</p>

<p>"It's devilish quiet," muttered Masterson, after we had been
squatting there for about an hour.</p>

<p>"Quiet?" I growled. "I'm praying for an earthquake to come
along and burst this infernal silence."</p>

<p>Wow, wasn't it quiet! I guess we could have heard a
British-India steamer hoot in the Bay of Bengal if that silence
strata had run all the way to the coast. That was how it seemed
to me. And every minute of that terrific silence seemed to act
like a vise that was squeezing out of me everything that was
human and vital. I don't know whether it was that way with
Masterson, but I had to wriggle my limbs occasionally just to rid
myself of the belief that I was becoming petrified.</p>

<p>We were on that platform about four hours before anything
happened. Then matters began to get lively. The monk touched our
sleeves with his long fingers, and we put our best ears to the
breeze.</p>

<p>"They're coming," whispered the fakir.</p>

<p>"Who?" gasped Masterson.</p>

<p>"The tigers," breathed the monk. "I can hear them coming down
from the hills. When they get on the sand, you will hear Buddha's
tiger cry out to them."</p>

<p>I felt inclined to knock that freak off the platform when he
said that. I felt that we had done a foolish thing in waiting
round that place, and I blamed the monk for making us build that
perch. A kind of fear gripped me at that moment that I had never
experienced before. Never!</p>

<p>A nigger can hear a tiger long before a white man can hear
him, and it was some minutes before I heard a noise. Masterson
heard them before I did. He was crouched close to me, and I felt
his muscles stiffen with excitement. Masterson was all nerves,
just then. The atmosphere of that valley, together with the story
of the monk, had upset him completely.</p>

<p>"They're coming," he breathed. "They're coming."</p>

<p>"Hush," I whispered. "Be quiet."</p>

<p>In the tremendous silence that was over that place, my skin
seemed to feel the soft padding of those brutes approaching.
Tigers? Of course they were tigers! And you can understand how it
struck us after listening to the story that the freak had told. I
pictured him grinning in the darkness. There is nothing pleases a
nigger better than to get the laugh on a white man, and that
fakir had sensed our skepticism when he unbottled that yarn.</p>

<p>I gripped my rifle and peered over the edge of the platform
into the darkness that heaved beneath us like masses of black
cotton wadding. Wow, wasn't it dark! And out of that infernal
thick night came little snuffles and snarls that made me put a
few pertinent questions to myself.</p>

<p>"What brings them to this spot?" I asked myself. "Why the
deuce do they come down from the hills to the bronze statue? What
fakery is at the bottom of it?"</p>

<p>Just as I was trying to puzzle the matter out, the monk
gripped my arm and brought his mouth close to my face.</p>

<p>"Now Buddha's tiger will cry out to them," he whispered.
"Listen!"</p>

<p>I got a chill down my spinal column when he said that. I was
listening with every inch of my skin. I wanted to hear that cry.
That naked monk had me scared right down to my shoes, and I knew
that Masterson was just as bad. Mind you, Masterson had plenty of
grit at most times, but all his grit had been sucked out of him
by the surroundings on that evening at Golan Ra.</p>

<p>"Listen!" whispered the monk. "Now he will cry out to them to
let them know that he is lonely."</p>

<p>The fakir timed it exactly. The cry came at the moment he
finished speaking. It split the silence like a projectile of
sound, and it nearly made Masterson leap from the platform. It
was a scream with a point to it. It knocked me so silly that I
couldn't think of a thing.</p>

<p>"Did you hear?" whispered the monk. "Buddha's tiger is
calling."</p>

<p>I tried to answer that freak, but I couldn't. That scream had
paralyzed my tongue. I damned myself for nine different kinds of
a fool as I crouched waiting. I knew how Masterson was. He was
about eighteen degrees worse than I was.</p>

<p>I peered into that darkness, feeling mighty angry and mighty
foolish. I pushed the rifle over the edge of the platform, and
waited for something that would let me know where one of those
brutes was prowling.</p>

<p>The monk sensed what I was about to do, and his long fingers
clutched my arm. "Don't!" he whispered. "Don't! You will annoy
Buddha's tiger if you shoot his kinsfolk here. Listen! He is
calling again."</p>

<p>That cry came again, and I was as stupid as a stuffed
mongoose. My, didn't it chill me! I wanted to let fly at one of
the brutes that snuffled and snarled in the dark, just because I
thought that the report of the rifle would bring back my courage.
Noise is a great spine-stiffener for the noise-maker, I can tell
you.</p>

<p>"Let him cry!" I gasped, and as I spoke the cry
went up again. It was an animal's cry, but it was a cry of
fear that would chill the heart of a road agent.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" cried the monk. "Don't!"</p>

<p>He made a grab at my arm, but I pushed him back. A huge pair
of emeralds appeared under the tree at that instant and I let
fly.</p>

<p>Body o' me! Didn't that shot start a rumpus! I'd give a few
dollars to know how many tigers were around that statue. Just to
satisfy my own curiosity, that's all. Those hills are famous for
tigers, and it was some convention that had assembled there. You
bet it was.</p>

<p>Masterson was pretty funky just then. I was scared, but he was
clean out of his wits with fright. I was looking for another pair
of green eyes to help my courage a bit, but he reached over and
gripped my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Let them alone!" he gasped. "Let them alone!"</p>

<p>"Shucks!" I spluttered, and just at that moment I caught sight
of another pair of blazing emeralds, and I let fly.</p>

<p>Suffering sinners! Didn't I get a shock when I banged at him!
That tiger must have been as big as the bronze statue. He must
have been. The bullet stirred his temper, and the brute sprang at
us.</p>

<p>He couldn't reach that platform, but he did as much damage as
if he had reached it. The big brute cannoned against one of the
stunted trees, and the trunk of that tree had been bored through
by the teredo ant! My hair prickled mighty badly as I felt that
heavy brute strike it. The tree started to crack near the ground,
and with a dickens of a hubbub the timbers of the platform,
Masterson, the mad monk, and myself flopped heavily to the
sand!</p>

<p>A piece of timber walloped me on the back of the head as I
struck the ground, and I guess it was some minutes before I
regained consciousness. It might have been an hour for all I
know. I tried to get up, but I couldn't. I listened to see if I
could hear the tigers, but there wasn't a sound. Something had
stampeded the brutes at the moment the platform fell, and they
had bolted for the hills. I was just wondering what had become of
Masterson and the monk when their voices came out of the silence,
and I listened. You bet I did. When I told this part of the story
to Curtis, the American consul, he nodded his head and told me
about Masterson's grandmother. I guess Curtis was right. If she
was a Shan-Talok woman, a night like that was the kind to bring
the breeding out of him. Do you know what that brace were doing?
They were praying to Buddha at the very top of their lungs.</p>

<p>"Keep your hands on the tiger and pray!" shouted the monk.
"Don't take your hands from him. He has saved you from the tigers
as the Holy One willed."</p>

<p>I tried to crawl toward them, but that smash on the back of
the head was too much for me. I fainted away again, and as I fell
on the sand I heard Masterson repeating a singsong prayer that
the Buddhist priest was chanting through his nose.</p>

<p>It was dawn when I came to my senses. I lifted myself up and
stared about me, but there were no signs of Masterson and the
monk. That big bronze tiger stood up in the dawnlight with his
paws stretched out in front of him, but the fakir and his
convert, they had both cleared out.</p>

<p>"Took him away before dawn, so that he wouldn't see anything,"
I muttered, and then I dragged myself over to the statue.</p>

<p>It was mighty plain to me what brought those brutes from the
hills when I reached the bronze tiger. There had been a little
feast there if I could judge by the look of things. Some
confederate of that greasy monk had sneaked up in the darkness
and left a live gibbon tied to the statue, and it was that gibbon
that had howled when he knew the tigers were on him. He had kept
quiet till he knew that they had winded him. I guess that little
feast had been spread for them every night for months, so the
monk had a sure guess when he told his little story to us.</p>

<p>That's mighty near all I have to tell. Two weeks afterward I
found the empty cave where the monk used to live. Under a stone
near the door was a note from Masterson asking me to tell his
employers at Washington that he had thrown up his job. That was
all. A leprous Negrito told me that Masterson and the monk had
gone to a Buddhist temple farther up the mountains, and I let him
go. I had enough of those hills.</p>

<p>I told Masterson's boss in Washington that he had thrown the
collecting job. The boss was a big fat man, so I didn't bother
telling him the story of that night at Golan Ra.</p>

<p>"Thrown it?" he cried. "Why, there's no one out there who
could give him more money than what we were giving him. Do you
think there is?"</p>

<p>"Search me!" I said, and with that I left him there to puzzle
the matter over. He wouldn't have believed me if I told him
everything. But Curtis, the consul, believed it. He took me to
the club, gave me a meal, a peg of brandy, and a suit of drill.
And he said that the yarn dripped truth. But Curtis had been out
there long enough to understand the country and to know what
effect the atmosphere of a place like Golan Ra would have on a
man who had a dash of color in his blood.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE SOUL TRAPPER</h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Collier's</i>, 25 November 1911</h3>

<p class="chaphead">
The Story of a Man Who Went Mad<br>
and a Woman's Fight for His Life.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">"BUT a white woman did come to this spot," said
the German naturalist, stretching himself on the plaited Dyak
mat. "There is no place on the earth where a man goes that a
woman will not follow if the necessity arises, and for that I
thank God. This Samarahan River is as near hell as you can go
without making a hole in the wall, yet a woman came here."</p>

<p>"A collector?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, no! I would hate to see a woman come to this place to
trap monkeys or gather bugs, or do anything like that. This woman
came to&mdash;well, she came to trap a man's soul."</p>

<p>"Tell me," I said.</p>

<p>Hochdorf, the greatest naturalist in the Malay Archipelago,
who knew more of the ways of animals than any of the seventy
collectors employed by the big Amsterdam firm, spoke soothingly
to a black monkey that whined in the shadow. The tropical night
had rolled down from Asia, and a tremendous silence had come in
its train. A new moon rode high over the tops of the jungle,
where sandalwood, teak, kaladang, and mohor, in league-wide
masses, resembled an ebony base upon which the dome of the
heavens was softly resting.</p>

<p>"I will tell you first of the man," said Hochdorf quietly. "We
will call him Hanslaw, that is as good a name as any, and he came
from Baltimore, over there in the United States. He had the
bungalow on the other side of the river, the one just below the
Dyak village that I showed you this morning, and after he was
here some time we became great friends. He was a fine naturalist,
none better. He loved his work, and he would not stop from dawn
till midnight.</p>

<p>"'Hanslaw,' I would say, 'you are a fool to work like that.
You are just what all you Americans are, just a bundle of nerves,
and if you go pounding along like that, something will stop all
of a sudden in your head, and you will go up like a rocket on the
Kaiser's birthday.'</p>

<p>"'I've got to make good, Hochdorf,' he would say. 'I've got to
make good, and make good quick. Work is nothing if you have the
right incentive to work, and by all that is holy, I have that
incentive.'</p>

<p>"That was all he would say. Just that. Work was nothing to
him. The hours that he spent in a wet singlet curing and fixing
things did not trouble him. I envied him. Who would not? Just
because there was a woman over there in the United States, six
thousand miles from this little hell in Borneo, he could not feel
tired. It is wonderful.</p>

<p>"'You are an old bachelor and you do not understand,' he would
say.</p>

<p>"'Bachelors have done some big things,' I would snap back at
him.</p>

<p>"'Perhaps so,' he would laugh, 'but by the bones of the great
Cuvier, Hochdorf, it is the man that the woman is watching who
has put the marks of his knuckles on this old mud ball.'</p>

<p>"He was only a big boy, but he was a great naturalist in spite
of his youth.</p>

<p>"It was no good speaking to him about taking it easy. Through
the smoke from that stinking slush lamp he saw her eyes looking
at him from way over in Baltimore, and he would not stop. In the
night sometimes I would get out of my bed and look across the
river, and no matter when I looked his light would be still
burning.</p>

<p>"Then one day the thing that I said came about. He snapped up.
Something in the back of his head gave way like a piece of
elastic. He was working on the skeleton of a <i>Simia
wurmbii</i>, the big orang-outang, and he laid down his knife
quietly, very, very quietly, and he went out and started to play
with the little pebbles on the bank of the river. <i>Gott steh'
uns bei!</i> It was so. It chilled my blood.</p>

<p>"'Hanslaw,' I said, 'what is up, my friend? Get up and leave
those pebbles alone.'</p>

<p>"But he would not get up. He sat there on his hams like a hill
Kyan, and he played with those little bits of stone like a
three-year-old baby. It is not nice to see anything happen like
that. Not to a man with brains. And Hanslaw had brains.
<i>Ja!</i></p>

<p>"What was I to do with a man in that condition in this little
hell? Seventeen miles down the river was Brechmann, but Brechmann
knew less about such things than I did. Hanslaw had blown
up&mdash;<i>puff</i>&mdash;just like that. It made me sick and it
made those Dyaks wonder a bit. It was the first example that
those fool niggers had ever seen of the quick-lunch methods you
have over there in the United States. They had never seen a man's
brain go <i>pop</i>, just because there was three hundred pounds
of pressure on a machine that was not strong enough to bear half
that amount.</p>

<p>"This place is not so bad if one is in the best of health, but
if you are sick&mdash;well, it is hell to be sick when you are
out on the rim of the earth. If Hanslaw had met with an accident
or if he were suffering from malaria it would have been
different. The Dyaks cured my leg with a plaster of blue mud when
I nearly cut it off with an ax. And I had much quinine if it had
been a fever. But it was neither a cut nor a fever. A belt had
slipped from one of the little flywheels in the back of Hanslaw's
brain, my friend, and a job like that is something that God
Almighty must attend to in His own good time.</p>

<p>"For eight days he loafed around the bungalow, doing no work
and talking little, and in those eight days something happened
that was peculiar. It was more than peculiar. When that little
belt slipped off the flywheel in his head, it made him lose
connection with that part of his brain that had been built up
through centuries of civilization. Do you understand? He just
crawled out of a husk that civilization had put around him. The
veneer of the centuries peeled off him like the skin of the milk
snake when he sloughs it in the rirro grass, and Hanslaw, the
greatest naturalist that had ever come to this infernal
archipelago, became a savage. It was what you might call a
backward migration of the soul. Or perhaps the soul left him
altogether. People say that we cannot see into those other lives
that we have left behind us, but Hanslaw went back into one of
them. <i>Ja!</i> The thing might not have happened if he was in
the city at the time the belt slipped off his mental flywheel,
but here the jungle was all around him, and the jungle is
impressive. It lays its hands on men who are in their right
senses, so you can guess how it gripped Hanslaw when he had
ripped off the protecting cyst that civilization had slowly
wrapped round him. Then there were the Dyaks to copy from. Do you
see?</p>

<p>"His brain was like a bit of new clay, and it picked up
impressions like a dry sponge sucks up water. He flung off his
clothes, tied a <i>chawat</i> of bark cloth around his waist and
did things native fashion, and it hurt me to see that. He broke
up specimen cases to make fish traps, and he did not know they
were specimen cases when he broke them up. Yet he had lectured me
about Humboldt a few nights before!</p>

<p>"On the eighth day Brechmann came up the river because I had
sent him a message telling him what had happened, and we held a
consultation about Hanslaw. He was fishing with the Dyaks in the
river while we talked, and he fished better than any of them. And
that is saying a lot. But the wonder of it was that he had never
spent any time fishing till that flywheel went wrong in his
brain. Do you see? In eight days he had learned all the tricks
that the niggers knew about fishing, and he had brought fivescore
new tricks out from the back of his brain where some ancestor of
his, dead a thousand years or so, had stored them. That was the
marvel to me. I knew that he had never seen a dozen crocodiles
till he came to Borneo, and I know that he never attempted to
catch one of those ugly devils in his life before that day he
started to play with the pebbles, yet he could beat all those
natives at the business after a few days. He tackled one of those
dirty monsters with as much composure as I tackle a glass of
beer, and it was not the Dyak fashion of killing it that he used.
<i>Nein!</i> It was a quicker and a better way, and it made those
niggers wonder. This little pinch of gray matter that we have in
our skulls plays some funny tricks with us at times.</p>

<p>"'We should take him down to the coast,' said Brechmann. 'It
is bad to let a white man run wild with the niggers.'</p>

<p>"<i>'Ja,'</i> I said. 'If we could get him on a tramp steamer
and get him up to Singapore, his consul might look after
him.'</p>

<p>"'Will we start now?' asked Brechmann.</p>

<p>"'No, we will leave it till the morning,' I said. 'We will
invite him on a trip down to your place, and if he gets
suspicious we must kidnap him.'</p>

<p>"Now I know that Hanslaw did not hear what Brechmann and I had
planned to do. We took good care to be out of hearing when we
talked the matter over, but instinct is better than hearing.
Hanslaw had his instincts sharpened when that flywheel went
wrong. You bet he had. That was how he knew which way to jump
when the crocodile lashed out with his tail. His skin felt things
the same as that of a wild animal. And he felt that Brechmann and
I were scheming something that concerned him. That is so. In the
morning when we were making preparations to go down the river he
bolted. Yes, he bolted into the jungle. I told you he had become
a better savage than the natives. Well, he was. We went in
pursuit of him with a crowd of Dyaks, and he made fools of us. We
were&mdash; what is that word you use? Ah, tenderfoot! We were
tenderfeet compared to him in his knowledge of the jungle.
<i>Mein Gott</i>, yes! He fooled us like as if we were so many
children. He chattered like the orang-outang, and he laughed when
he found that we could not tell his cries from the cries of the
monkeys. We had never heard such imitations.</p>

<p>"Brechmann got tired of chasing him after a day or two, and he
went back to his camp, leaving me with the difficulty on my
hands. It was not a nice thing to spend the day thinking over.
Not much! My brain is slow, and I act like an old woman in a
matter of that kind. I tried every way to get the madman back to
the bungalow, but it was no good.</p>

<p>"Three weeks after he had bolted, a mail came up from the
coast. There was a letter for Hanslaw from that place, Baltimore,
that he came from over there in the United States, and I opened
that letter. That is so. It was a beautiful letter. Never have I
read such a letter. It made me feel sorry to think that I had no
one to write me letters like that. I think I could have worked as
Hanslaw worked if I had. I think so. Hanslaw said that Love was
the big lever that moved the world. I believe him now. The day
before his brain threw the somersault he quoted some lines of
verse to me, and I did not understand those lines till I read
that letter. Yes, I remember the lines. Let me see, they ran like
this:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Methinks no leaf would ever bud in spring,<br>

But for the lovers' lips that kiss, the poets' lips that
sing.</p>

<br>

<p>"You think it is strange that I, an old bachelor who is
trapping animals in this wilderness, should remember those lines.
Wait till I tell you all of the story and then you will not think
it strange. You will understand why I remember.</p>

<p>"I read that letter eight, twelve, twenty times, then I sat
down and wrote an answer to it. It was the first time I had
written to a girl since I left Bonn. That is funny, is it not?
But I tried my best to write that girl a good letter. You are
wondering if I told her everything, are you not? Yes, I did tell
her all that I knew. <i>Ja</i>, I did. I told her how he had
worked through the days and through the tropical nights when the
hot smells get up off the ground and take you with their cursed
fingers till you drip with perspiration, and I told her how the
little belt had slipped from the flywheel in his brain.
It was no good trying to lie to the woman who
wrote that letter. Not one bit. I told her how we had chased him
into the jungle, and how he had mocked us by imitating the big
<i>Simia satyrus</i>. My, I never did such a bit of writing in
all my life. When I had finished it I sent it down to the coast
with two of the Dyaks, and then I went about my work. If Hanslaw
was crazy I could not give his craziness as an excuse to my
employers.</p>

<p>"But that madman tried to make me as much of a lunatic as the
Fates had made himself. He would come down here by the river at
night and howl at me. That was pleasant, wasn't it? He would howl
at me from the trees, and then he would sneak softly up to the
windows of the bungalow and send rocks flying among my specimens.
It was the devil.</p>

<p>"Brechmann came up the river and he grinned when I told him of
the tricks that Hanslaw was up to. It amused him because he was
seventeen miles away.</p>

<p>"'Shoot a charge of salt at him,' he said. 'Shoot it at his
bare legs, and I bet he knows enough to keep away from your
place.'</p>

<p>"'No, I will not do that,' I said. 'If Hanslaw was in his
right mind he would sooner cut off his head than harm one of my
specimens.'</p>

<p>"'Salt is a good thing,' said Brechmann. 'It is the best
persuader that you can find.'</p>

<p>"'You go back where you came from!' I screamed. 'It is not
your specimens that he is playing the mischief with. Clear out
and leave me to mind my own business!'</p>

<p>"And he did clear out, wondering whether I had snapped
something in the back of my head like Hanslaw had done.</p>

<p>"But Hanslaw kept me mighty busy in the nights that followed.
He bombarded this place till the volleys of stones took my memory
back to Gravelotte when the French Chasseurs tickled us some. One
would think that the mad devil had a hundred arms to judge by the
way he sent the stones down on this place. He made my life a
misery. I could not open a window to get a breath of air, and if
I sat in the dark with a door open he seemed to know. He had
cat's eyes. He ruined much of my best work, but when I would be
that angry that I could kill him, I would think of that girl's
letter.</p>

<p>"It went on like that for three months, then one morning while
I was skinning a crocodile down on the bank of the river, I saw a
boat coming up the stream. There were four Dyaks pulling it, and
someone else was sitting in the stern. I stood up and watched it,
and I don't know what I felt like just then. Something came up in
my throat that was bigger than the ball on Strasburg Cathedral.
<i>Ach Gott!</i> I took a new view of the world at that minute.
Just before I saw the boat everything looked bad and crooked. I
was as poisonous as a red-necked cobra, then everything was
changed. Hanslaw told the truth. The flowers would not bud in the
spring if it was not for love. I, an old bachelor, who has not
heard a good woman laugh for fifteen years, I tell you that. It
is the truth, and it is from the lookers-on that you get the
truth.</p>

<p>"I think I helped her out of that boat when it grounded on the
stinking mud. I am doubtful to this day if I did. I have an idea
sometimes that I stood there like a badly-stuffed specimen. Can
you think what a task that woman set herself in coming from
Baltimore to this hell? Can you imagine it? It made the sweat run
down my face when I thought of what she had put up with in coming
up the river with four dirty naked niggers. There are no Cook
excursions around Borneo, my friend.</p>

<p>"'You are Mr. Hochdorf,' she said, when she put her little
hand into my big, dirty paw. 'I want to thank you for your
letter.'</p>

<p>"That was all she said. You would think that I was expecting
her, and that it was not six thousand miles of a run between the
United States and Borneo. I cried. I cried to think that the
world is not as bad as some bilious devils make out. Out on this
God-forgotten place I was witnessing something that poets could
sing of. <i>Ja</i>, it was good to think that there were women
like her in the world. I cannot tell you of the feelings that she
stirred in me. A man may read of an act, but when he sees
it&mdash;<i>Ach!</i> It is different.</p>

<p>"She did not ask any questions, and that is the wonder of it.
Is it not? She just looked at me and at the cursed jungle that
was crushing in all around the bungalow, and she seemed to know
everything that I knew. I cannot make it clear to you, but she
understood things in a way that puzzled me.</p>

<p>"Do you know, she never mentioned Hanslaw all that day? Well,
she did not. She did not mention his name. She just sat by that
little window and stared at the trees. Once only she looked at
me, and I said: 'Some time before midnight,' before I could stop
myself. And she nodded when I said it.</p>

<p>"She did not eat anything much. She just nibbled like a
canary, and I knew that she was praying for the night. That
madman was somewhere up in the hills sleeping, but I knew that he
would be down to give my bungalow a bombardment when the night
came down thick.</p>

<p>"When the darkness fell like a blanket, she stood up and
walked to the door, and I stood up too.</p>

<p>"'Miss Leslie,' I said,' you must not go far. You are in a
wilderness.'</p>

<p>"'I am only going into the clearing,' she said. 'I promise you
that I will not go further.'</p>

<p>"She looked at me with those big blue eyes of hers that
Hanslaw used to see through the smoke of the slush lamp when he
was working, and then she went quietly out into the dark. The
moon was not up, and the night was so thick that you would think
it possible to cut up the darkness into cubes and build things
out of it. A tropical night has a breed of blackness that you
will not find anywhere else. It made me nervous to let her go,
but I knew it was no use trying to stop her, and I knew that she
wanted to go by herself. She had come six thousand miles to do
something, and I was nothing in the scheme of things. Nothing at
all.</p>

<p>"But I was nervous. You know how some nights are more silent
than others? Well, this was one of those silent nights. You
cannot get them in the city, but in the jungle they are
plentiful. The atmosphere was that heavy that you felt inclined
to put up your hand and push it off the back of your neck.</p>

<p>"About an hour after the girl went out I called to her, and
she answered me from that big tapang tree in the clearing. 'I am
all right,' she said. 'Please do not worry about me.'</p>

<p>"But I could not keep from worrying about her. I strained that
thick night for noises till my ears ached, and every time a twig
cracked in the jungle I was at the door with my neck poked
forward like a water snake. It was a night when you would expect
things to happen, and that graveyard silence made me perspire, I
tell you.</p>

<p>"I was just going to call out again to the girl when that
thick night air was set quivering. It was like as if little
threads of purple and silver and gold were being threaded in and
out of the dark patches, and I gasped. She was singing. She was
singing out there in the night, and I had never heard such
singing. No, I did not. I forgot that I was in Borneo when I
heard it. It just crushed out the darkness and the loneliness of
this inferno and lifted me up and took me ten thousand miles
away. Mother of me! Yes. It had that soft croon in it that a
mother breathes to a sick baby, and you cannot hear that every
day. I wish we could, don't you? It would keep us wholesome and
clean, perhaps.</p>

<p>"I moved out of the doorway and listened. Her voice was as
sweet as the silver tulip bell at the Dilwara Temple. It did not
spring at you like some voices. It swirled around and around like
silk lariats, and you could not tell whether she was in the
clearing or across the river. It was wonderful. I have never
heard such singing.</p>

<p>"She stopped for a second as if she wished to listen, and
before the notes of her song had died away, a stone crashed
against the window of the bungalow, and a hyena laugh went up
into the night like a brass blare. I was never more sick in my
life than at the moment I heard that devilish scream. It was
terrible. I had to sit down on the step because I had no strength
to stand. I was sick with the thoughts of what she was
suffering.</p>

<p>"The girl started to sing again, and there was no more
laughing. And there were no more stones. She sang and sang and
sang, and the jungle listened. <i>Gott</i>, it was weird! I never
felt the mystery of this place till that night. Somewhere in the
tree masses was a man whose soul had gone out of his body, and
she was trying to bring it back. Perhaps you cannot see how big
it was to me on that night, but I tell you that I never heard
anything like it. I am not the most emotional of men, but I have
never had such strange sensations in my life. Her singing went
into the very marrow of my being, and made me feel as if I had
come up against something that the world had overlooked in its
haste to make dollars. I don't know what it was. I cannot explain
it to you. But it was a soul calling to a soul. <i>Ach</i>,
yes!</p>

<p>"I stayed awake all through the night. There were no more
stones or no more laughter. But she sang on. Toward dawn, when
the first bit of baby pink came up out of Micronesia, I shook
myself and stumbled down through the clearing. She was standing
near the tapang tree where she had been eight hours before, and I
took her by the arm and led her inside the bungalow. Her dress
was all wet with the dew, and her face was as white as the snow
on the Himalayas. But she never spoke. Not one word about the
night. Not a single word.</p>

<p>"The next night it was nearly the same thing over again. But
there was one exception. That madman threw a stone at the
bungalow, but he did not laugh his infernal hyena laugh. He crept
away quietly after he had thrown the rock, and to me that was
wonderful. For three months he had been doing that nightly howl,
and suddenly he became dumb. It was strange, wasn't it?</p>

<p>"And the next night he threw stones, but it did not seem to
give him the devilish amusement that he got out of the business
before she started to sing. No, it did not. He did his little
cannonade and then he crept away or listened to her in the trees.
But the fact that he was somewhere near and yet not visible to
her, was making that girl suffer. I saw that. She was being
crucified by the black jungle that held him from her; but there
was nothing for me to do. Once I hinted at some scouting work,
but I dropped that hint in a hurry. It was not on her program.
All I could do was to sit and wait, and try and coax her to eat
something that would keep her strength up.</p>

<p>"Night after night she sang in different places around the
bungalow, and those big trees seemed to listen to her like so
many giants. And then, after about two weeks of that, Hanslaw
stopped throwing stones. But he was there in the dark. She knew
that, and I read the information in her face. I could see it, and
I could hear it in her voice.</p>

<p>"Then one night, it was a fine moonlight night, the miracle
happened. The Samarahan River looked like a belt of silver, and
the snags stood up like black spikes that were holding it down in
its bed. The girl was down near the bank singing softly to the
tapang trees, and I crouched here in the shadow of the bungalow
and wondered what would be the end of it all. I began to think
that I was a fool to write that letter to the United States. I
thought that it would have been better for me to have said
nothing or to have written a letter saying that Hanslaw had got
lost in making a trip into the interior.</p>

<p>"Presently she started to sing in a way that I had never heard
before. It was more wonderful than I had ever heard her sing. And
in that moonlight it had a witchery in it that was astounding. It
was a magic melody. I crept down through the bushes till I could
see her. She was standing right on the bank of the stream, and
she was looking across the river to that strip of sand that you
can see directly in front of the little landing.</p>

<p>"I followed the direction of her eyes, and then I saw. Yes, I
saw Hanslaw. <i>Ja!</i> I had never seen him fully since the day
he ran away. He was standing on the strip of bare sand, and he
was looking straight across at her. He stood like a statue. His
limbs were bare, and the only thing he had on him was the
bark-cloth <i>chawat</i> that he had put on when he threw away
his clothes.</p>

<p>"I laid down flat on my stomach and waited. There seemed to be
nothing in the world but those two people. That is so. It was
just a big empty globe in which a girl fought for the soul of a
man against the jungle. That was how it seemed to me. It is only
in a place like this that you could see a drama like that. There
was the silver stream in which the dirty, scaly-backed crocodiles
were sleeping, the madman on the other side, and the girl. And I
was the only spectator of a play that was bigger than anything
Shakespeare ever conceived.</p>

<p>"Hanslaw saw her. He could not help seeing her. She was right
down on the bank, and the big moon lit up the place like the
Unter den Linden on a festival night. For five minutes he stood
motionless, and all that time she sang a soft old ballad that
would tear the heart out of an image. That is so. She was singing
for her own life as well as for his. I knew that. Her voice never
had such melody in it as it had at that minute, and it will never
have it again. I am sure it will not.</p>

<p>"She stopped with a little choking trill, and Hanslaw moved
restlessly. I clawed the ground to keep from springing on to my
feet. Then that half-naked man moved around like a restless
panther, his body half turned toward the trees as if he was
inclined to spring into the dark depths.</p>

<p>"She started to sing again, and he was still till she had
finished. Then his nervousness gripped him again. It seemed as if
he was afraid of someone cutting off his retreat. It was terrible
to watch. Her singing seemed to hold him while she sang, but the
moment she finished he was ready to spring back into the trees at
the slightest sound.</p>

<p>"The girl stopped exhausted, and he made a quick move for the
shadows. He had crossed the sand when something happened. I do
not know if she threw herself into the water or if the rotten
bank gave way beneath her when she was leaning out. I think it
was the latter. But before I could get on my feet she was being
swept down the river!</p>

<p>"You know what this Samarahan River is? It is alive! In that
dirty mud there are thousands of crocodiles. It is so. I got to
my feet with the most awful feeling that I have ever felt, and,
as I did so, a cry like the cry of a lost soul came from Hanslaw,
and his long naked body shot out like a shaft into the silver
stream where the girl was battling. That was a horrible cry that
he gave. I can hear it now if I shut my eyes. I will always hear
it. I will never forget it. Do you know what I am talking of? It
was the cry of the soul coming back to the body it had left. And
I heard it!</p>

<p>"He reached her in three strokes, and he swam toward this side
of the shore. I prayed then. I did. I had not prayed for ten
years, but I prayed quick as he was striking out for this bank. I
knew then that God Almighty had done something in His own way,
and that He had made me a witness of the miracle.</p>

<p>"She had fainted when he reached the bank, and I crouched in
the shadow and watched him. Very gently he picked her up in his
long, sinewy arms and carried her up to the bungalow, and I
walked on air as I followed. I was stunned. I was incapable of
doing anything. That is so.</p>

<p>"He carried her in the door and placed her on the couch that
was just inside, and then she came to her senses and spoke to
him. I listened in the dark outside. For a minute he did not
answer, then he spoke as if the floodgates of his soul had been
suddenly ripped away, and I crawled away down to the Dyak
village. It was not for me to hear any more. I had heard enough.
<i>Ja!</i> I had heard enough to tell me that she was as safe as
if she was in her mother's home in Baltimore. That was all I
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"In the morning I came back here. Hanslaw had on a clean drill
suit of mine, and he had shaved himself with my razor. When I
came to the door he caught my two hands and held them for three
minutes without speaking. Then the girl came out from the other
room and put an arm around his neck, and the other arm around
mine. And the three of us cried. I am glad to think that I could
cry at such a time.</p>

<p>"'You are a good fellow, Hochdorf,' said Hanslaw. 'Ethel is
taking me home.'</p>

<p>"And that girl put her arms around my neck and kissed me then,
and that is the greatest reward I have ever got. I am sure it is.
She was one of God Almighty's angels, and Hanslaw and I were but
two pieces of mud alongside her. That is all we were. She was the
greatest woman I have ever known."</p>

<p>"And now?" I asked, as the German stopped speaking.</p>

<p>"I got a letter from them yesterday," he replied. "He is
lecturing in one of the European capitals, and he is making good.
He is a great naturalist, as I told you. But that
woman&mdash;<i>Ach Gott!</i> Hanslaw was right about the flowers.
They would not bud in spring if there were not women like her in
this world. That is so."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THIS is the first time I have put this story
upon paper, but twice before I have related it briefly to two
different persons. Once when I told it to the bumboat man at
Berbera in return for a bowl of flour and sweetened water, he
looked at the little statue of Mohammed in the corner of the room
and winked slowly three times. The other person to whom I
narrated the happening was a little wrinkled Hadesi, who sat by
the roadside where the great pilgrim trail to Mecca winds like a
white milk snake across the hills, and he walloped the sand with
the flat of his sword when I had finished.</p>

<p>"And what answer did you give the woman when she asked you
what are the greatest things in the world?" queried the little
Hadesi.</p>

<p>"This was my answer," said I: </p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Four things greater than all things are,

Women and horses and power and war.</p>

<br>

<p>"Wow, that was a great answer!" said the little Hadesi, and
when I walked on across the hot sand that glittered like crushed
diamonds, he was pounding the earth with his sword blade and
chanting the song of Mahbub the Muleteer to the desert winds.</p>

<p>Now this is the story. Three hours after the old
<i>Penlennon</i> dived into a thousand fathoms of water off the
coast of Somaliland, seven hundred miles northeast of Mombasa, I
struck a humpbacked patch of wet sand about half the size of the
parade ground at Aden. The coast line showed up like a smudge of
soot on a sky of brass, and I watched it as I rested. I knew that
I would have to swim the stretch of oily water between the sand
hummock and the shore before the tide rose.</p>

<p>I was on the sand bank about an hour when I sighted a fleet of
feluccas, catamarans, and dahabeahs coming out from the mainland
and making straight for the island, and I covered myself with a
tangle of seaweed so that I could see everything without being
seen. There were over thirty boats in the fleet, and they
completely surrounded the little hummock. Then the biggest
dahabeah drew out from the rest, and I watched a big, bearded man
on the deck yelling instructions to the crew. The naked Arabs
lowered a long, yellow box into the water, paddled the box to the
sand bank, fixed it on the highest point, and then splashed back
to the dahabeah. The moment they climbed aboard, the mixed fleet
turned and raced for the mainland, leaving me alone with the
mystery box.</p>

<p>"Now it's up to me to investigate," I said, and I clawed
myself out of the seaweed and went toward the big box. "Someone
has died of the plague," I muttered, as I stumbled toward it.
"This is an isle of the dead by the look of things, and they
bring the bodies out here for the current to carry them out to
sea."</p>

<p>The box was covered with a piece of coarse matting, and I
pulled this aside and looked in. Staring up at me were a pair of
topaz eyes that were deeper than the Guinea Basin, and those eyes
belonged to a brown woman who was prettier than the houris that
wait to open the pearl gates of the seventh heaven. The bumboat
man at Berbera said that couldn't be so, but the bumboat man was
a fool. He didn't see her.</p>

<br>

<p>"What is wrong?" I stammered, and when I put the question
<i>I</i> thought that the odds were a million to one against her
being able to understand it. But I got a surprise.</p>

<p>"The world is wrong," she answered, and when I stood staring
at her with my mouth open like a Shangalla beggar, she smiled
like the sun on an Easter morning.</p>

<p>"And what is wrong with the world?" I asked stupidly.</p>

<p>"When you cut the thongs on my wrists and ankles I will tell
you," she answered.</p>

<p>I cut the cords hurriedly, wondering as I did so what was at
the bottom of the mystery. She chafed her limbs till she was able
to stand upright, then she folded her silk sarong around her body
and looked at me with her big topaz eyes.</p>

<p>"What are the greatest things in the world?" she asked.</p>

<p>It was then that I gave the answer which so impressed the
little Hadesi. I had heard a sailor chanting the song in a
Portuguese boarding house at Mombasa, and the words came to my
lips as she asked the question. Said I:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Four things greater than all things are,<br>

Women and horses and power and war.</p>

<br>

<p>"You are wrong," she said.</p>

<p>"And what are greater?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Love and hate," she answered; then she walked down to the
water. "We had better make a start for the mainland," she
continued. "The tide is rising."</p>

<p>I pushed the yellow box into the water without speaking, the
woman slipped in behind me, and when she had got a grip with one
hand we struck out for the shore. That was a mighty big swim, but
at last we found ourselves high and dry on a stretch of pebbly
beach that looked lonelier than the ruins of Karnak.</p>

<p>The woman got her breath and turned toward me. "We're here,"
she said, "and now I'd like to know what you intend doing."</p>

<p>"I'll sleep here tonight," I answered, "and tomorrow I'll
strike south along the coast till I find a settlement. And you?"
I asked.</p>

<p>She was staring at the sea when I put the question, but she
turned suddenly and fired an interrogation at me.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of the Red Face of Feerish Ali?" she
asked.</p>

<p>I laughed when she said that. It was a fool question when you
put it to a man who has lived on the east coast of Africa. Every
sailorman from the Crozets to Holy Cross Bay has heard of the Red
Face, and she knew from my laugh that my ears had been open to
the stories told about it at night on deck, and along shore.</p>

<p>"Would you like it?" she asked, carelessly.</p>

<p>Then I laughed again. It sounded just as foolish as if anyone
had asked me if I would like the tail of Halley's Comet or the
Ring of Saturn! My, yes. The Red Face of Feerish Ali had been a
dream for thirteen hundred years. All the world trekkers that had
ever cut the East into strips had heard of the thing. The
Siahposh Kafirs know of it; the Basutos chant its power in their
war songs; the Druses whisper of it, and the Zimoors sing of its
beauty in the hills behind Fez. I had to laugh mighty hard at the
cool way she asked me if I would like it.</p>

<p>"As you are in a generous mood," I said, "you might get me
the mainsail of the <i>Flying Dutchman</i> and the&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned on me and I stopped. Her topaz eyes flamed in a way
that pushed my words back into my throat, and I just stared at
her as if I were hypnotized.</p>

<p>"You fool!" she cried. "Do you think I am a liar? I asked you
if you would like the Red Face of Feerish Ali, and I want an
answer."</p>

<p>"Sure I'd like it," I stammered. "I'd give my soul for it."</p>

<p>There was a light in her eyes that made me think of a woman
who had stabbed her husband at Kismayu, and it was that light
that enabled me to get a grip on things. I remembered having
heard that the men of the Gamant tribes have a habit of putting
away their wives when a prettier woman swings up on the horizon,
and I guessed that the sand hummock off the coast was a mighty
good place to put a woman who was not wanted. You bet it was. And
I guessed a bit farther than that. I came to the conclusion that
the guy with the black beard on the big dahabeah was the husband
of the lady with the topaz eyes, and then I got a hunch that she
knew of the hiding place of the Red Face of Feerish Ali.</p>

<p>Blackbeard was no ordinary Arab, and I thought that it was
mighty unlucky for him if her ladyship had a bunch of his secrets
up her sleeve.</p>

<p>A wide-faced moon swung up over the hills as we sat on the
beach, and all of a sudden the woman started to sing the Song of
the Red Face. I had heard bits of it before, but they were mighty
small bits when I compared them to her chantey. My, yes! Hers was
a song of songs. It seeped through my skin and intoxicated me. It
brought back the past and sent the horsemen of Feerish Ali
galloping down the pearly sky. I heard the Moslem warriors charge
and watched the desert tribes scamper madly across the hot sands
when the Face of Feerish spurted fire as he led his cavalry after
them.</p>

<p>It was a song full of blood and fire, of charging hosts and
thundering squadrons, of swinging axes and flashing swords, of
whizzing spears and crashing shields. There was never such a
song. And the wonder of wonders, I seemed to see everything that
she was singing of. I saw Feerish sweep down through Habesh, the
Arab name for Abyssinia, Feerish of the Red Face, the face that
no one could look upon. Wow! the thing scared me. I listened with
my nerves on a tension, and my throat got dry as she chanted
stanza after stanza. That song had been polished by desert bards
for thirteen hundred years. A thousand tongues had plaited into
it the <i>swit</i> of the swinging blade, the groans of the
dying, and the <i>kleeck</i> of the short ax on the shields of
brass. Lordy! what a poem it was!</p>

<p>The woman finished at last with the death of Feerish at the
Bahr-el-Azrek, which is the Blue River, and I gave a little
gurgle of wonder. It was a terrible story. My heart was thumping
madly with the thrill of the thing, and my ears were straining
the silence that seemed to close in around us when she finished.
There was never a song like that. All the sagas of the Vikings,
the ballads of the Sikhs, and the chants of the Afghans were weak
things compared to that. Skald or troubadour could never have
written that. Time had made it with a million tongues and the
white sunshine that makes the imagination bubble. And I knew as I
sat there like a man in a dream that the woman with the topaz
eyes had spoken the truth when she asked me if I would like the
Red Face. I was sure of it.</p>

<p>She turned on me suddenly and looked into my face. "Of what
are you thinking?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Of the power of hate," I said. Then, after a pause, I said
boldly: "What possessed the big fool to do it?"</p>

<p>I thought she was going to spring at me when I put the
question, but she controlled herself with an effort. "He loved a
Falasha woman from Mej Hana," she said quietly, "and she was
three times more beautiful than I. Lie down and sleep now, for
tomorrow we go up into the mountains."</p>

<p>But I couldn't sleep. I lay awake thinking of Feerish Ali and
his hordes sweeping down from Arabia, and the Arabs flying before
the Red Face that had become a legend. And the woman had offered
it to me! Fate and Hate were leading me to a thing that had been
hunted by all the iron-jawed adventurers that had ever spurred or
sailed into the unknown.</p>

<p>The dawn came up out of the Indian Ocean in a great wave of
flame, and the woman sprang to her feet. I don't think she slept
much either.</p>

<p>"Come along," she cried. "We have far to go today."</p>

<p>The mountains looked like blue chiffon tacked on to the bottom
of the wine-red sky as we turned toward them, and the woman
struck out with the easy swing of the desert born. I followed
without a murmur. I didn't wish to question her any further. All
through the night that song had rioted through my blood like
wine, and I was ready to follow her anywhere. I knew what love
could do, and now I was being shown what hate could do. The woman
with the topaz eyes was selling a secret that had been kept for
thirteen hundred years.</p>

<p>All through the hot morning we tramped and tramped, climbing
higher and higher over slaty ridges that stretched up and up till
I got the impression they would end suddenly and give us a
three-mile drop into the plains of Abyssinia. Wow, yes! Out of
the clumps of cactus and thorn an occasional jackal peered at us,
and once a batch of hyenas collected on a slope and laughed at us
like a mob of lost souls. The place got on my nerves, but the
woman walked on steadily, as if she saw nothing, only the picture
of that woman from Mej Hana who had taken her place in the
affections of the big man with the black beard. She had a look in
her eyes that made me start to think out plans for getting rid of
the Red Face after I got my grip on it. Every time I looked at
her I had the sort of hunch about my luck that you get sometimes
at a roulette table when you ask the croupier to raise the limit
to the skies.</p>

<p>"Huh," said I to myself. "Old Blackbeard was ten different
kinds of a fool to let this lady know his secrets and then try to
get rid of her in that slipshod way."</p>

<p>Handfuls of the red dust on those hills were caught up by
wandering puffs of air, and you'd swear they were crimson ghosts
dancing across the wastes. They made my blood run cold. The place
was dead. There were only the jackals and hyenas, vultures and
lizards, and the wraiths that danced mad sarabands across the
plains. I thought then that the woman had a purpose in singing me
the Song of the Red Face. Every time my nerves got shaky as I
looked around at the stripped horror of the place, I thought of
the great chant and my muscles stiffened. Only for that song the
devils that seemed to inhabit that place would have made me turn
tail and rush for the coast at full speed. The ocean is a mighty
clean affair when you compare it with bare hills that made you
feel that something terrible would crawl over them at any
minute.</p>

<p>We slept that night high up on the mountains, at least we
tried to sleep. I lay awake all through the night listening to
the peculiar noises made by the puffs of wind that hummed across
the hills, and the howling of the jackals, and the rustling of
lizards and crawling things. Besides, I was mighty hungry. We had
nothing but bitter berries and brackish water from the time we
had landed on the mainland, and berries are not satisfying to a
man who is very hungry.</p>

<p>We started on across the stony slopes the moment it was
daylight, and about midday we came to the great chasm in the
hills. That was the deepest abyss I have ever seen. I suppose it
is the deepest that anyone has ever seen. It looked as if the
heat of the place had baked the crystalline rocks till they
parted, and across the landscape there was a trench that was over
a mile deep. My, what a cleft that was! The rays of the sun were
like white lances as they dived into the depths thousands of feet
below. The Grand Canon of the Colorado, the quebrada of the
Apurimac in the Andes, and the big fissures in the Himalayas near
the Khaiber Pass are small affairs compared to that cleft in the
crystalline rocks of Somaliland. It was a terrible chasm. It
looks as if some giant had sliced the thing with a sword blade
ten miles long when the earth was cooling. That's so. It took my
breath. I panted like a winded buffalo when I stood and stared at
the thing, and the dizzy depths loosened the muscles of my knees
till I fell on the ground with terror.</p>

<p>"What is wrong?" asked the woman.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," I gasped. "I'm afraid of that!"</p>

<p>I pointed at the infernal trough and she laughed at my fear.
She picked up a rock and jerked it down into the thing, and I
gave a yell as I watched the stone dropping through space for a
mile. Gee, it was awful! There were no shelves or ledges like you
see in the Grand Canon. The sides of that devilish crevice were
perpendicular, and I clutched at the tufts of desert grass and
clawed myself back from the rim.</p>

<p>"Why," said the woman, "I thought you were willing to attempt
anything to get the Red Face?"</p>

<p>"So I am," I stammered, "but that thing took my breath."</p>

<p>She looked at me curiously, and I got to my feet and followed
her as she coasted the edge of the thing. It was weird, terrible,
awe-inspiring. The sunbeams, striking down into it, whitened the
walls and made them that snaky and slippery that you felt
inclined to scream out with terror every time you looked at
them.</p>

<p>We walked for about half a mile along the edge, then the woman
pushed her way through a clump of stunted thorn, and next minute
we came out in front of a spidery bridge of coarse hemp that
swung above the depths at a point where the huge gash was not
more than thirty feet from side to side. Oh! that bridge gave me
an awful sensation. It swayed backward and forward with the gusts
of wind that blew up out of the abyss, and I clutched the thorn
bushes lest the horrible fascination of the crevice would make me
take a dive into the place.</p>

<p>The woman looked at me and smiled, then she walked forward to
the end of the bridge. I felt seasick and worse. You bet I did.
She was stepping on to that bit of flimsy ropework that swung
over the chasm, and I yelled out to her as I glanced at the
mile-deep drop beneath the cobweb of hemp. Imagination pictured
her dropping through five thousand feet of air, and I got a
feeling that made my head swell.</p>

<p>"Come back!" I yelled. "You're mad!"</p>

<p>"It's perfectly safe," she laughed. "I have been over here
scores of times."</p>

<p>The bridge swayed beneath her as she walked slowly across, and
I laid down on the edge of the chasm and squirmed like a Tamil
with the cholera as I watched her. I never felt any sensation
like I suffered then. Not much!</p>

<p>She stopped when she had got halfway across and looked back at
me. "Come along," she said. "Follow me, there is no danger."</p>

<p>"I can't!" I screamed. "I can't! My head would swim if I
attempted to walk over that cobweb."</p>

<p>"Not for the Red Face of Feerish Ali?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," I stammered.</p>

<p>She remained silent for a while, then she started to chant a
part of that song that told of how Feerish rode alone at the head
of his riders, and how the desert hordes fled because they
thought that fire came from his face. She sang it standing upon
the bridge, and while she sang I crawled toward the place where
the hemp cables were tied to the rocks. I couldn't resist that
song.</p>

<p>I clutched the ropes and looked down at the depths that came
up against me like a cold hand. The place set me trembling as if
I had a fit of ague.</p>

<p>"Come on," said the woman, softly. "You are only half a mile
from it now. The Rocking Stone is on the opposite bank."</p>

<p>Now when she mentioned the Rocking Stone I was certain that
she spoke the truth when she said that she knew the hiding place
of the Face. Ras Allad, the blind Arab, who kept an opium joint
in the place of The Nine Devils at Mombasa, had often sung to me
of the Rocking Stone that hides the Red Face, and when she
mentioned the stone I got down on my hands and knees and crawled
out on the bridge. That song of hers made me drunk, and I wanted
to get my hands on that thing if I lost my life in the
attempt.</p>

<p>"Pass the guy ropes under your arms and shut your eyes," said
the woman. "I will tell you if you move an inch from the center
of the bridge."</p>

<p>I closed my eyes and started forward on that swinging, spidery
arrangement that swung above the depths. The woman's voice came
to me as I shuffled forward timorously. "Keep on," she said.
"You're going all right. Come on. You are more than halfway
across. A little to the right; to the right."</p>

<p>I stopped then and opened my eyes with fear, and my limbs were
paralyzed by the dread that gripped me. I tried to turn around to
make for the side I had left, but the woman rushed out on the
swaying structure and gripped my arm. "No, no," she cried. </p>

<p>"Don't go back! I cannot get it without help. You're nearly
over. Come along!"</p>

<p>She gripped my arm and pulled me with a strength that
surprised me, and as she pulled she chanted the song. I gathered
myself together and followed her, trying vainly to shut my eyes
to the quivering heat waves that filled the chasm.</p>

<p>"Keep moving!" she cried. "You are nearly over. Now you are
right." She gave me a final pull as I reached the other end of
the bridge, and I staggered to a safe spot and collapsed.</p>

<p>"Now we are right," said the woman. "Come along, we will be
there in no time."</p>

<p>We followed the edge of that terrific gash for about a mile,
crushing our way through clumps of cactus and stunted brushwood.
The woman was in the lead. She walked with tireless feet, and I
followed close behind her, leaving bits of my clothing on every
thorn bush that reached out to block the way. It was a devil of a
track. Every bush seemed to be all spines and hooks, and I was
just wondering if I would be flayed alive when I reached the
place, when we turned an elbow of the canon, and the woman
stopped.</p>

<p>"This is the Rocking Stone," she said quietly, and I wiped the
blood and perspiration out of my eyes and looked at the pillar of
basalt that was immediately in front of me.</p>

<p>The pillar was fully fifteen feet high and over ten feet in
circumference, and it stood upright in a bowl of rock. It
reminded me of a stunted fir tree in a shallow pot.</p>

<p>"It rocks backward and forward," said the woman. "Put your
shoulder to it and push."</p>

<p>I put my shoulder to it and pushed gently, and the pillar
started to rock in its socket of stone in a way that made me jump
back from it.</p>

<p>"It won't fall," said the woman, laughing softly at my fear.
"See, you must keep on pushing it till it swings as far as the
socket will allow. Do you understand? Behind this pillar is the
opening that leads to the passage where the Red Face lies hidden,
and one can only get into that opening when the pillar swings to
the farthest point that the bowl of rock will allow."</p>

<p>I understood then. I put my shoulder against the big basalt
column and set it rocking violently, and as it swerved out of its
upright position, it disclosed a round opening in the rocky wall
immediately behind. This opening was only visible for a few
seconds as the huge pillar swung away from it to either side, and
as I thrust the thing forward when it swung back to me, I
wondered how the woman would ever negotiate the entrance.</p>

<p>If she sprang and missed the hole in the wall she would be
crushed as the stone rolled back.</p>

<p>"Keep it going!" she cried. "Push harder. Harder!"</p>

<p>She wrapped her silk sarong tightly around her legs, and I
looked at her with a question in my eyes as I kept the pillar
moving.</p>

<p>"I am going to jump," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"You will be killed!" I cried. "You will be crushed between
the pillar and the wall!" The perspiration streamed down my face
as I looked at her.</p>

<p>"No, no," she cried. "Keep it going. If I get inside I will
signal you when I am ready to come out."</p>

<p>I would have stopped the thing, but I was afraid that the
woman would leap if she saw that I was slackening the speed of
the terrible pendulum, so I put all my strength into the task and
swung it backward and forward till I thought that it would leap
out of its socket and thunder into the chasm. The whole width of
the opening in the wall was disclosed now, and the woman gathered
herself together like a puma waiting to spring.</p>

<p>"Keep it going!" she cried. "Faster! Faster!
<i>Faster!</i>"</p>

<p>I flung my last ounce of strength into the task, and at that
moment the woman sprang!</p>

<p>It was a wonderful leap. My, yes! I saw only a flash of blue
silk, then the stone rolled back over the opening, and I knew
that she was through. She had measured the distance, timed the
movement of the murderous pendulum, and then hurled herself at
the opening with wonderful swiftness. If she had missed it I
would have been powerless to save her.</p>

<p>I flung myself down on the sand and watched the pillar as it
slowed down. I figured that she would be in that place for a few
minutes, and I endeavored to rest myself so that I would be able
to set the pendulum swinging to its full extent when she was
ready to make the return jump.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed, twenty minutes, thirty. I began to think
that something had happened, but just as my fears were becoming
uncontrollable, there came a faint pounding from behind the
pillar, and I again set the basalt pendulum in motion.</p>

<p>As the opening became visible, her voice came to me from the
darkness of the passage in which she was waiting. "You will have
to tell me when to jump," she cried; "I cannot see from here.
Tell me when the pillar is swaying most, and then scream out when
it passes the hole as it swings toward the chasm."</p>

<p>I set my teeth and pushed. The big boulder rocked and rolled,
making a terrific grinding noise as it swished to and fro in its
basin. Its swing became longer, and I watched it with bulging
eyes. The woman's life was in my hands, and the strain was
tremendous.</p>

<p>"Get ready to jump!" I shouted. "I am ready," she said.</p>

<p>The stone came toward me on its return swing, and I thrust it
back with all my strength.</p>

<p>"Jump!" I screamed. <i>"Jump!"</i></p>

<p>Out of the darkness of the opening she shot with the speed of
a bullet, stumbled headlong into the sand, then picked herself
up, and approached me. I was staggering blindly back from the
pillar, but as she came toward me I caught a flash of something
that nerved my weakened legs and set my heart pounding madly. Oh!
yes! A million lances of red fire darted from the breast of the
woman. Her bosom seemed to be on fire. The white blinding light
of the bare hills was sucked up by something that she clasped in
her arms, and was then flung back in spurts of red flame that
made me cover my eyes. It blinded me. It took my senses away from
me for a moment; then I looked again and saw. Bound across the
woman's breast with a piece of the silk sarong was the Red Face
of Feerish Ali!</p>

<p>I suppose that I was the first western man that had ever seen
that affair. Thousands had hunted for it, but they had never
found it. Desert tribes had kept the secret since the day when
Feerish and his Moslems had been butchered at the Bahr-el-Azrek.
It had figured through a hundred legends of the East, and had
been sung of from Loureno Marquez to Tabriz, and from the oases
of the Igidi Desert to the brick walls of Tashkend. Falashas,
Shangallas, Nubians, Agows, and Arabs had fled in terror before
the thing that the woman clasped in her arms, and I had a queer
feeling of dread as I stumbled forward and touched it.</p>

<p>It was a great mask of gold, with openings for the mouth,
eyes, and nostrils, but in the center of the forehead was the
real wonder of the affair. There was embedded a ruby greater than
the biggest ruby the world has ever heard of. The ruby that
Tamerlane wore in his crown and the one that Shah Jehan presented
to his bride were small and insignificant jewels compared to the
one in the Red Face. There was never a stone like that. Never! It
was a living, blazing heart of blood that seemed to swell as
one's blinded eyes watched the red fire stream out from it. It
gripped my brain with a band of iron, and I flung myself on the
ground beside it as the woman placed it on the sand.</p>

<p>"Is it worth the trouble?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Trouble?" I cried. "There was never anything like this. I
would go to perdition for it!"</p>

<p>She laughed at my remark, and I cried over the mask as I ran
my fingers over it. My, what a story that thing could have told
of fight and slaughter! That big ruby eye had struck terror into
the tribes that thought Feerish was a bloody-eyed Cyclops as
he galloped down on them. The treasure fascinated me. It hit
me in the emotional solar plexus, and I could do nothing but
fondle it and weep over it.</p>

<p>The woman touched me on the shoulder and brought me out of the
stupor into which I had fallen. She was looking nervously at a
clump of low brushwood at the rear of the wall that ran behind
the Rocking Stone, and when I sprang to my feet she pointed
toward it.</p>

<p>"We are followed," she whispered.</p>

<p>"How? Where?" I gasped.</p>

<p>She shaded her eyes with the palm of her hand, looked for a
minute at the brushwood clump, then turned and gripped my
arm.</p>

<p>"We must run!" she cried. "If we can reach the bridge across
the chasm we can stop them from pursuing us farther."</p>

<p>I seized the mask of Feerish Ali and rushed after her as she
turned back toward the spidery structure we had crossed on our
way. I didn't like being captured at that moment, and I cursed
the spy in the brushwood as I ran madly behind her. I wanted to
get away out of that cursed country and take the Red Face with
me. In my mental eye I saw the savants of Europe and the United
States blinking their eyes when I put before them an article that
they were certain was never in existence. My! what a shock it
would be!</p>

<p>The heat waves danced above the big crevice, and the dust
phantoms rose up and pursued us as we raced forward. Once I
looked behind, and then I ran faster. I caught a glimpse of a man
dodging from one clump of cactus to another, and I clutched the
mask tighter as I gasped the news to the woman.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" I cried as I raced beside her. "Hurry! He is gaining
on us!"</p>

<p>She staggered, and I grasped her arm and helped her forward.
Her feet were bleeding from the rocks and stones, but she showed
wonderful grit as she stumbled on. I had never seen a woman with
one-half her courage.</p>

<p>We reached the infernal spider's web across the abyss, and she
led the way. I had to give her the Red Face to hold while I
dropped on my knees and shuffled across with the guy ropes under
my arms, and my eyes closed against the horrors of the depths,
and all the time she screamed at me to go faster. When I
staggered on to the far side, she pushed the mask into my hands
and thrust me behind the thick bushes on the rim.</p>

<p>"Quick! Give me your knife!" she cried. "Hurry, he is
coming!"</p>

<p>I gave her the knife, and she rushed back to the middle of the
bridge and started to saw away at the little cross strands of
hemp that were knotted to the two big rope cables that spanned
the crevice.</p>

<p>She didn't touch the cables. She only sawed at the hemp lacing
that bound them to each other, so that a man running across would
step on a place that she had sawed and go through into the
abyss.</p>

<p>It turned me sick as I watched her, but when I looked at the
mask at my feet I forgot the murderous work she was doing. God,
yes! I wouldn't have cared if a thousand men had tumbled into
that place as long as I got safely away with the Red Face. Life
was a small matter compared to that treasure. You bet it was. I
screamed to her to hack the cross strands cunningly so that our
pursuer would not see, and I hugged the mask to my chest as she
obeyed.</p>

<p>The woman slipped back and dropped down beside me in the sand.
The silence was fearful. Our hearts were pounding mightily, and
the <i>kleck-kleck</i> of a sand lizard went out into the
stillness like the blows of a sledge hammer.</p>

<p>"Who could it be?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"I don't know," breathed the woman. "There are very few who
know of the Rocking Stone. Hush! Here he comes!"</p>

<p>There was a rustle in the bushes on the other side of the
gulch, then a man broke cover and made a wild dash for the
bridge. I think the heat blinded the woman for an instant, so
that she could not tell who it was, but it was only for an
instant. She rose to her feet with a scream of agony, and as she
screamed I saw the cross strands running from cable to cable
break through beneath the weight of the black-bearded man who had
skippered the dahabeah that had brought her to the sand bank!</p>

<p>He didn't go right through. His arms caught the cables that
were untouched by the knife, and as I looked at him swinging
there with five thousand feet of air beneath his kicking legs, I
saw the woman dashing across the bridge toward him. My! what a
woman she was! She had cut so many of those cross ropes that it
was a mighty risky job for her to venture back to help him, but
she went. My, yes! She went without thinking of her own danger.
She only saw him swinging by his arms, and those legs that had a
mile of space beneath them. Those legs turned me sick. I tried to
turn my head away, but he fascinated me&mdash;his legs clawing
for support. I dreamed of them for months after that day.</p>

<p>The woman reached the side of the man and put her muscular
arms around his chest. Then she started to lift with every muscle
in her body. It made the little Hadesi on the Mecca road cry when
I told him of that happening. "What a great woman!" he said, and
by the bones of Marco Polo she was great! That black devil had
left her out on a sand bank two days before, and she was risking
her life to save him.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">

</div>
<br>

<p>The bridge rocked and swayed as she lifted him slowly. I think
she could have lifted him if he weighed a ton. I am sure she
could. Up and up she lifted him till he got his knees upon the
strong cables, and I got a cold chill when I saw that he was
safe. I did some mighty quick reasoning at that moment. The
woman's hate that had made her take the Red Face from its hiding
place had turned to love when she saw that big brute slip through
the bridge, and it didn't take me two minutes to see how I'd fare
now that they had joined forces. You bet it didn't! I knew that
Blackbeard was not an amiable customer because she had told me
that it was a good job for my health that he did not catch a
glimpse of me on the sand bank; so when I saw them crawling
toward me, I got busy.</p>

<p>"This is where I do a fadeaway," I muttered, and, gathering
the Red Face of Feerish Ali in my arms, I dashed off full speed
into the cactus and thorn clumps that fringed the abyss.</p>

<p>All through the afternoon I ran without stopping. A score of
times I would have dropped from exhaustion, but each time I
glanced at the big ruby in the forehead of the gold mask I ran
faster. The sun sank into the West, shooting red lances at the
ruby, which the ruby returned, and still I staggered on. Every
bush seemed to shelter the Bearded Sheik and his wife, and I
guess I was half insane with terror when the night fell, and a
big moon climbed over the hilltops and looked at me.</p>

<p>I had no idea where I was. Sometimes I thought that I was
running toward the ocean, and at other times I seemed to get a
creepy feeling that told me that I was still close to the big
chasm. I sensed the thing like a Hindu senses the nearness of a
cobra. I staggered across a moon-washed slope, still clasping the
Red Face to my bosom. I was out of the cactus and thorn for a
moment, and I increased my speed. A mirage of the ocean came up
before my eyes, and I moved my tired legs faster.</p>

<p>"If I could get to the coast and get up to Aden," I muttered.
"Up to Aden. Up to Aden." I repeated the words over and over as I
raced down the incline. "Up to Aden. Up to&mdash;"</p>

<p>I gave a mighty yell just then and threw myself on my face. It
was the only way to save myself. I clawed with both hands at the
little patches of desert grass, and, when I finally stopped
sliding, I lay listening within twelve inches of the brink of the
chasm, listening to the tinkle of something that was falling
through the black depths that defied the moonbeams! And that
something was the Red Face of Feerish Ali, which had slipped out
of my hands when terror had made me fling myself face down and
claw madly at every little tuft of grass to stop myself from
being hurled over the rim!</p>

<p>I lay for an hour or more, unable to move, then I crawled
hurriedly into a shelter of brushwood. Voices came to me out of
the silence of the night, and as I listened I saw the woman and
the black-bearded man come over the rise. They walked slowly down
toward the brink of the crevice, and it was mighty evident to me
that they were hot upon my trail.</p>

<p>They reached the edge and stood for a moment talking quietly,
then the man turned down the bank while the woman walked slowly
toward the bushes where I was hiding. They had evidently agreed
to beat the clumps along the edge in search of me.</p>

<p>I held my breath as she came nearer. She passed within a yard
of me, then, as if she possessed the scent of a bloodhound, she
circled around the clump, and came directly toward the spot where
I was lying. I moved my leg lest she would trip over it, and the
movement made my presence known to her. She stopped and leaned
forward.</p>

<p>"You are there?" she said softly.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered.</p>

<p>"Where is the Face?" she asked.</p>

<p>"At the bottom of the abyss," I answered; then, as she stood
like a statue, I told her hurriedly of the happening.</p>

<p>When I had finished she stood for a few minutes without
speaking; but a faint halloo, that came from the direction in
which the man had gone, made her speak rapidly.</p>

<p>"I believe you," she said. "There is a curse on the thing. But
the Black Sheik would kill you if he found you. Stay where you
are till morning, and then make your way down the coast to Obbia.
Good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-by," I answered, and then I watched her hurry along the
rim of the chasm to meet her lord.</p>

<p>Next day I found my way to the coast, and five days afterward
I reached Obbia, and that is the story. The bumboat man said that
it would try the belief of an Englishman, and an Englishman will
believe anything the moment you get him out of the English
Channel; but the little wrinkled Hadesi said it was a good
yarn.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I had no copy of that song of the Red Face to
give to the Hadesi.</p>

<p class="first">
THE moonlight fell upon Schreiber's bald head
as he jerked his body out of the depths of the rough-hewn lounge
chair. His eyes were turned to the blue-black smear of jungle,
but his ears were absorbing the faint sounds that came from the
interior of the bungalow. The path, like a whitewashed strip,
reached fearfully toward the weird tree masses, and alongside it
the coarse rirro grass stood up haughtily as if protesting
against the man-made barrenness. The jungle resents a cleared
space; it speaks of the presence of human beings.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked softly.</p>
<br>

<p>"Nothing," murmured the naturalist, but his grip on
the unplaned pine limbs which formed the frame upon which the
Dyak mat was stretched did not relax. He gave one the impression
of a man sifting the noises of the night with his whole body.</p>

<p>Suddenly his head came sharply down between his shoulders, and
the chair groaned a protest as he left it with a spring. A black
line appeared upon the moon-whitened path, and the heavy German
pounced upon it with the agility of a cat.</p>

<p>"It is that damn vermilion snake," he grunted, holding the
wriggling thing up by the tail as he shuffled toward the door.
"This is the second time he has escaped."</p>

<p>When the chair had again received him with a long-drawn
creaking sound, I put a question.</p>

<p>"Did you see him before he started across the path?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"No," snapped Schreiber. "I just felt that things are not
right. That is easy. When he escaped it caused a little silence
and just a little change in the note of those that didn't keep
altogether quiet. Listen, please, now."</p>

<p>From inside the darkened bungalow came a peculiar wasp-like
buzzing that filtered unceasing into the mysterious night. The
surrounding jungle appeared to be listening to it. At first it
defied the attempts of the ear when it sought to analyze the
medley, then the different noises asserted themselves slowly. It
was the inarticulate cry of the German's prisoners. There was the
soft moaning of the wakeful gibbon, the <i>pat-pat</i> of the
civet, the whimper of the black monkey, the snuffling of caged
small things, and the rustle of snakes that crawled wearily
around their boxes. The sounds seemed to bring to the place a
peculiar aura that put the bungalow apart from the untrammeled
jungle that surrounded it on all sides.</p>

<p>"They are all right now," murmured the German, contentedly.
"They are quiet, so."</p>

<p>"But how did they know that the vermilion snake had escaped?"
I asked. "They're in the dark, and the snake made no noise."</p>

<p>The naturalist laughed, the pleasant laugh of the man to whom
a question like mine brings the thrill of subtle flattery.</p>

<p>"How?" he repeated. "My friend, the gibbon in there felt it in
his blood, <i>ja</i>. He whimper softly, oh, so softly, and the
news ran along the cages. The dark makes no difference to the
wild people. Every little bit of their bodies is an eye. Every
little hair listens and tells them something. That is as it
should be. I felt the change in their notes. I was dreaming of
Jan Wyck's place in Amsterdam just then, and I wake up mighty
quick. The black monkey stopped quiet, for the black monkey is
wise, but the tune of the others changed to pianissimo very, very
sudden. A snake is a fellow that can get in anywhere. Listen to
them now. I did not tell them that he was back, but they
know."</p>

<p>A feeling of nauseation crept over me as the German spoke
haltingly, groping for the words to express himself. To me the
bungalow appeared as a leprous spot in the jungle of wild, waving
tapang, pandanus, and sandalwood, laced together with riotous
creepers. The whimpering, snuffling, and protesting rustling made
me shiver, and I surprised myself by voicing my thoughts.</p>

<p>"It seems so infernally cruel," I stammered. "If you look
at&mdash;"</p>

<p>The naturalist interrupted me with a quiet laugh, and I
remained silent. The big meerschaum was being puffed
vigorously.</p>

<p>"It is not cruel," he said slowly. "Out there," he waved a
hand at the blue-black smear of jungle that looked like a
foundation upon which the pearly sky reared itself, "they are
dining on each other. My prisoners are safe and have plenty. Did
you not hear just now how it troubled them when the snake
escaped? So! The black monkey has a little one and she was
afraid. The jungle life is not a lengthy one for the weak. I was
at Amsterdam five years ago&mdash;<i>Ach Gott!</i> it seems fifty
years ago&mdash;and at Hagenbeck's I see a one-eared <i>mias</i>
that I trapped years ago. She looked well. Would she be alive
here? I do not know."</p>

<p>The irritating droning noise continued to pour out of the
bungalow. It floated out into the night that appeared to be all
ears in an effort to absorb it.</p>

<p>"No, captivity is not bad if they are treated right,"
continued the naturalist, "and can you tell me where they are not
treated well?"</p>

<p>I didn't answer. Confronted with a request for reasons to back
up my stammered protest, I found myself without any. Schreiber's
captives were well fed. The baby monkey was guarded from the
snake.</p>

<p>The big German smoked silently for several minutes, his eyes
fixed on the jungle belt in front.</p>

<p>"The zoological people treat their animals better than society
treats human beings," he said, gently. "And the naturalists?
Well, they treat them well. I never knew one who did not."</p>

<p>He stopped for a moment, and then gave a little throaty
gurgle. Memory had pushed forward something that displeased
him.</p>

<p>"I made a mistake," he remarked, harshly. "I did know of one.
The night is young, I will tell you of him. It happened a long
while ago when I first came to the Samarahan
River&mdash;Fogelberg and I came together. This man's name was
Lesohn&mdash;Pierre Lesohn&mdash;and he was a naturalist of a
kind. That is, his heart was not in his work. <i>Nein!</i> He was
always thinking of other ways of making money and no man who
calls himself a naturalist can do that. This business calls for
everything&mdash;heart, soul, brain, all. That is why I said
Lesohn was not a naturalist. The devil of discontent was gnawing
at him, and in this work there should be no discontent. No, my
friend.</p>

<p>"One day I pulled down the river to Lesohn's place, and he
pushed at me an illustrated paper from Paris. He laughed, too,
very excitedly. He was nearly always excited; the discontented
people always are.</p>

<p>"'What do you think of that?' he said.</p>

<p>"I read the piece in the paper, and I looked at the picture
that went with it. It was the picture of an orang-outang, and it
had under it the brute's name. He had two names, just like you
and me. There he was sitting at a desk smoking a cigar and making
a bluff that he was writing a letter. It turned me sick. It was
not good to me. I handed the paper back to Lesohn and I said
nothing.</p>

<p>"'Well?' he snapped, 'I asked you what you thought of it.'</p>

<p>"'Not much,' I said. 'It interests me not.'</p>

<p>"'You old fool!' he cried out. 'That monkey is earning two
hundred pounds a week at the Royal Music Hall in Piccadilly. He
is making a fortune for his trainer.'</p>

<p>"'I do not care,' I said, 'I am not concerned one little
bit.'</p>

<p>"'Ho, ho!' he sneered. 'You want to work in this stinking
jungle till you die, eh? I have other things in my mind,
Schreiber.' I knew he had, but I didn't interrupt him just then.
'Yes,' he cried out, 'I do not want to be buried out here with
the wahwahs singing the "Dead March" over my grave. I want to die
in Paris. And I want to have some fun before I die, Schreiber.
There is a little girl whose father keeps the Caf des
Primroses&mdash;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> Why did I come to this
wilderness?'</p>

<p>"'And how will that help you?' I asked, pointing to the paper
that had the picture of the smart monkey in it.</p>

<p>"'How?' he screamed. 'How? Why, you old stupid, I, Pierre
Lesohn, will train an orang-outang too.'</p>

<p>"'It is not good to make a brute into a human,' I said. 'I
would not try if I were you.'</p>

<p>"Lesohn laughed himself nearly into convulsions when I said
that. It was a great joke to him. He fell on the bed and laughed
for ten minutes without undoing his face. He was a smart man, was
Pierre Lesohn&mdash; too smart to come out of Paris. The smart
men should always stay in the cities. The jungle is not for them.
It agrees only with men who have made a proper assay of their
faculties. Lesohn never had time to make an assay. He was too
busy scheming."</p>

<p>Schreiber stopped and again leaned forward in the big chair.
Something had gone astray in the buzzing noise from the prison
house, and like a maestro he listened for the jarring note.
Softly he rose from his seat and slipped into the interior
darkness.</p>

<p>When he returned he relit his pipe slowly&mdash;the jungle
life makes a man's movements composed and deliberate&mdash;then
he settled himself back in the seat of his own manufacture.</p>

<p>"The little one of the black monkey is ill," he explained. "If
it was in the jungle it would die. Here it will live, I think.
But we will get back to Lesohn, the smart Frenchman who should
have stayed in Paris. He pasted that picture of the man-ape over
his cot, and he looked at it every day. It got between him and
his sleep.</p>

<p>"'Two hundred pounds a week,' he would cry out. 'Think of
that, you old, square-headed Dutchman. That is nearly five
thousand francs! That is four thousand marks! Could we not train
one too?'</p>

<p>"'Not me,' I said. 'I like the orang-outang just as he is. He
suits me like that. If he got so clever that he could smoke my
cigars and read my letters I would not like him one bit. He would
be out of the place that God gave him in the animal kingdom.'</p>

<p>"I annoyed Lesohn by telling him that. I annoyed him very
much. Three days afterward a Dyak trapped an orang-outang that
was just getting out of its babyhood, and the Frenchman bought it
quick.</p>

<p>"'It is just the size I want,' he said to Fogelberg and me. 'I
want to train it as quick as I can. Ho, ho! you two fools, just
wait. There is a little girl whose father keeps the Caf des
Primroses&mdash; wait, Dutchman, and see things. Professor Pierre
Lesohn and his wonderful trained orang-outang! Five thousand
francs a week! Is it not good?'</p>

<p>"But Fogelberg and I said nothing. We knew the status of the
orang-outang in the animal kingdom, and we were content to leave
him on his proper plane. Mother Nature fixes the grades, and she
knows that the orang is not the fellow that shall send notes to
his sweetheart or puff cigars when he is sitting in tight boots
that squeeze his toes that have been made for swinging him
through the palm trees. From the ant-eating manis with his horn
armor, right up to Pierre Lesohn, Mother Nature has settled
things very properly and very quietly.</p>

<p>"Lesohn was not the man for the wilderness. No, my friend. He
was all bubble, all nerves, and he wanted to feed on excitement
ten times a day. And there is no excitement here. Not a bit.
People in the cities think that there is, but they are mistaken.
This is a cradle where you get a rest if you sit quiet. Do you
understand? The Frenchman could not sit quiet. His imagination
made him a millionaire after he had that orang-outang two days.
It did so. It bought him a house at Passy, and a carriage and
pair, and the smiles of the ballet-girls at the Grand Casino.
Some men are like that. They make their imaginations into
gas-wagons and ride to the devil. And Lesohn was taking something
that didn't improve things. He kept a square bottle under his
cot, and he toasted the monkey and the good times that he was
going to have in Paris&mdash;toasted them much too often for my
liking.</p>

<p>"That monkey learned things mighty fast. He was a great mimic,
a very great mimic. Every time Fogelberg and I pulled down to
Lesohn's place, the Frenchman trotted the damn hairy brute out to
do things for our approval. Fogelberg didn't like it. I didn't
like it. <i>Nein!</i> We told Lesohn and he laughed and made fun
of us.</p>

<p>"'Oh, you two old Dutchmen!' he cried out. 'Oh, you two old
monkey-snarers! You wait! Professor Pierre Lesohn and his trained
orang-outang at five thousand francs a week! Five thousand
francs! Think of it! In the Caf des Primroses I will think
sometimes of you two fools on the stinking mud banks of the
Samarahan.'</p>

<p>"He was going mad thinking of the good times he would have on
the boulevards. He drank&mdash;<i>Gott im Himmel!</i> how he
drank. He saw himself strutting in Europe with the monkey
bringing in the money. He was mad, all right. And I think that
orang-outang began to think that he was mad. He would sit
alongside Lesohn and puzzle his old head to know what the
Frenchman was so excited about. The brute didn't know of the
dreams of Monsieur Pierre Lesohn. No, my friend. He didn't know
that the Frenchman was going to make a pedestal of his wisdom
upon which he could climb and kiss his fingers to the Milky Way.
Oh, no! He was only an orang-outang and he didn't know that
people would pay four thousand marks a week to see him stick his
blue nose into a stein and puff at a cigarette. <i>Ach!</i> it
sickens me.</p>

<p>"Then one day the monkey got sulky and would not do a single
thing. I think Lesohn was drunk that day. He must have been. The
brute was sulky and the Frenchman was drunk. Pierre told me of it
afterward. The <i>mias</i> knocked over the specimen cases and
went cranky. Lesohn went cranky, too. He saw the boulevards and
the house at Passy and the ballet-girls and the Caf des
Primroses floating away on the monkey's tantrums, and he got
sick. He got very sick. He swigged away at the flat bottle till
he went nearly mad, and then he done something."</p>

<p>The bluey depths of the jungle appeared to pulsate as
Schreiber halted in his story to listen again to the sounds that
came from within. There was witchery in the soft night. It
touched one with mysterious fingers. It watched outside the
lonely bungalow, wondering, inquisitive, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"He must have been mad," continued the German, "mad or very
drunk. The Samarahan flowed right by Lesohn's bungalow, and the
Samarahan was alive at that place. Dirty, ugly, scaly-backed
crocodiles slept in the mud there all day long. Ugh! I hate
crocodiles. They turn me sick. The Frenchman he was mad,
though&mdash;mad with drink and mad because he thought the
orang-outang was turning stupid."</p>

<p>"Well?" I gasped, "what happened?" The night was listening to
the story. The buzzing noise from the prisoners died down to the
faintest murmur.</p>

<p>"Well," repeated the naturalist, "Pierre Lesohn taught that
orang-outang a lesson in obedience. He tied the animal to the
trunk of a tree near the mud banks&mdash;yes, near the stinking,
slimy mud banks that smell like assafoetida and then he, Pierre,
laid himself down on the veranda of his bungalow with his
Winchester rifle in his lap.</p>

<p>"The orang-outang whimpered, and Lesohn laughed. He told me of
this afterward. The orang whimpered again and again. Then he
cried out with fear. A bit of the mud started to move, and the
big <i>mias</i> was afraid, very much afraid. You know the cold
eye of the crocodile? It is the icicle eye. It is the eye of the
monte sharp. No animal has such a cold eye. The shark?
<i>Nein!</i> The shark has a fighting eye. The crocodile doesn't
fight. He waits till all the cards are his way. He is a
devil.</p>

<p>"That tied-up pet of Lesohn's attracted the dirty brute in the
mud, and the orang-outang had been fool enough to tell him by
that whimper that he was helpless. See?</p>

<p>"The crocodile watched him for one hour&mdash;for two
hours&mdash;for three hours. He thought it might be a trap.
Lesohn watched, too. He was teaching the monkey what mighty smart
fellows come out of Paris.</p>

<p>"The crocodile knocked the mud off his back to get a better
view, and the orang screamed out to Pierre to save him. He
screamed mighty hard. He chattered of the things he would learn
if Lesohn came to his aid quick, but Lesohn smiled to himself and
sat quiet.</p>

<p>"The crocodile dug himself out of the mud and looked at the
<i>mias</i>, and the <i>mias</i> shivered in every bit of his
body. Lesohn told me all about it afterward. He said the monkey
cursed him when the crocodile flicked the water out of his eye
and moved a little farther up the bank. That icicle eye had the
orang-outang fascinated. He lost his nerve. He shrieked and he
prayed in monkey gibberish, and that gave the crocodile plenty
heart. <i>Ach</i> yes! He thought that he held four aces in the
little game with the orang, and he thinks it good to take a
chance. He made a big rush at the tree, but Pierre was waiting
for that rush. He threw the rifle forward quick, the bullet took
the brute in the eye, and he flopped back into the stinking mud
with a grunt of disgust.</p>

<p>"You see what Lesohn was? He was a madman. Next day when
Fogelberg and I went down there he told us all about it, and he
laughed a lot. The orang-outang was so mighty afraid that Lesohn
would repeat the stunt that he was hopping round doing everything
that he could. <i>Gott!</i> he was much afraid, was that monkey.
I bet he dreamed of nights of that icicle eye of that crocodile.
Every time Lesohn looked at him he shivered as if he was going to
take a fit, and he whimpered like a baby. That crocodile had
watched him for three hours. See?</p>

<p>"'Look at him!' screamed the Frenchman. 'No more sulks from
him! I tamed him! Here!' he yelled to the orang, 'bring me my
bottle!'</p>

<p>"Didn't that monkey rush to get it? You bet he did. He went as
if it was a matter of life and death to him, and I suppose it
was, to his thinking. And Lesohn shrieked with laughter till you
could hear him at Brunei. He reckoned that the cold eye of a
crocodile was the very best thing in the world to bring a monkey
to his senses.</p>

<p>"'I will take him over to Singapore next week,' said Lesohn,
'and from there I will get a boat to Colombo, and then ship by
the Messageries Maritime to Paris. Five thousand francs a week,
Dutchman! You will read of me. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> Yes! You will
read of Pierre Lesohn&mdash;Professor Pierre Lesohn and his
trained orang-outang.'"</p>

<br>

<p>Schreiber halted in his recital. A wind came out of the China
Sea, charged down upon the jungle and slashed the fronds of the
big palms like a regiment of cuirassiers thundering through
space. It died away suddenly, leaving an atmosphere of weird
expectancy that put one's nerves on a tension. The night seemed
to listen for something that it knew was coming.</p>

<p>"Go on!" I cried, excitedly. "Tell me! Tell me what
happened!"</p>

<p>"Four days after that night," said Schreiber, quietly, "I
pulled down the Samarahan. When I came in front of Lesohn's
bungalow I called out to him, but I got no answer. 'He is in the
forest,' I said to myself; 'I will go up to the hut and get a
drink.' It was a mighty hot day, and the Samarahan is not a
summer resort. <i>Nein!</i> It is not.</p>

<p>"Did you ever feel that a silence can be too much a silence?
Sometimes in the jungle I feel a hush that is not nice. It was
here tonight when the vermilion snake escaped. Often in the
forest it chokes the whistle of the cicada and it seems to stop
the little blades of grass from waving. <i>Ja!</i> It is strange.
Whenever I feel that silence I am careful. I am not afraid, but
I know that other things that can feel in a way that I cannot
feel are much afraid.</p>

<p>"It was that kind of a silence that I feel when I was going up
the path to Lesohn's bungalow. It was like ice upon my spine. It
came around me and touched me like ten thousand cold hands. I am
not imaginative, no, but in the jungle one gets a skin that feels
and sees and hears. And my skin was working overtime just then.
It was telling my brain something that my brain could not
understand.</p>

<p>"I walked on my toes through the mangrove bushes at the top of
that path. I know not why, but I did. I was near to making a
discovery. I knew that. I stopped and peeped through the branches
and I saw something. <i>Gott!</i> Yes! I saw something that made
me reach out for the news that my skin was trying to tell me. I
knew, and I did not know. Do you understand? I chased that thing
all around in my brain and I was getting closer to it each
minute. The things I thought of made it come closer, and my lips
got dry. I thought of what Lesohn had done to that orang, how he
had tied him to the tree and frightened him into a fit with the
cold stare of that scaly-backed crocodile, and while I thought of
that I watched the veranda of the bungalow. I seemed to see that
monkey tied to the tree and that icicle eye looking at him from
the mud, and then&mdash;why, I knew! It came on me like a flash.
I felt as if I was hit with a sandbag.</p>

<p>"For three minutes I could not move, then I staggered toward
the veranda. Do you know what was there? <i>That big ugly brute
of a mias was fumbling with the Frenchman's rifle, and he was
crying like a human.</i></p>

<p>"'Where is Lesohn?' I cried out. 'Where is he?' And then I
laughed like a madman at my own question. My skin, that was all
eyes and ears, had told me where Lesohn was. <i>Ja!</i> It was
so.</p>

<p>"The big <i>mias</i> sprang up on his feet and he looked at me
just as if he understood every word I said. My legs were as weak
as two blades of grass. I had not seen the thing done.
<i>Ach!</i> It was strange. I thought I had dreamed about it, but
then I knew I hadn't. It was the silence, and the crying
<i>mias</i>, and something inside me which told me it is not good
to teach a brute too much. 'Where is he?' I cried out again.
'Show me where he is?'</p>

<p>"The orang wiped the tears from his ugly blue nose and touched
me with his big, hairy arm, and then he started to shamble toward
the mud banks where the Frenchman had tied him to give him that
little lesson in obedience.</p>

<p>"I was sick then. That atmosphere turned me all upside down. I
knew what had happened. Yes, I knew. My mind had pieced things
together like the pieces of a picture puzzle. I knew what Lesohn
had done to the brute, I knew the imitative ways of the
<i>mias</i>, and I knew that Pierre was often drunk&mdash;very
often drunk. And then there was the knowledge which my skin had
strained out of the silence. A cold sweat ran from me as I
followed the orang, and I clutched the rifle tight as I got near
the mud bank and looked around for something to confirm the
horror that my soul had sensed. And the proof was there. It was a
coat sleeve tied to the tree where the Frenchman had tied the
<i>mias</i> a week before, and the sleeve wasn't empty.
<i>Nein!</i> The cords had been tied around the wrist of Pierre
Lesohn, and the cords were very strong. They had stood the strain
of the pull, and&mdash; and it was there as a proof of what had
happened.</p>

<p>"It was all so plain to me. Lesohn must have been drunk, see?
Well, while he was drunk it had come into the ugly head of that
brute to let Pierre get a thrill from the icicle eyes of the
scaly-backed devils in the mud. He had tied Lesohn to the tree,
and then he got the rifle and copied the Frenchman by sitting on
the veranda to watch for the first one of those things that would
find out that Pierre was helpless. It was plain&mdash;oh, so
plain to me. But the Frenchman, in educating that orang, had
forgotten to teach him how to load a rifle. It was unfortunate,
was it not? The rifle was empty, and when the dirty brutes came
out of the mud, the <i>mias</i> could do nothing. <i>Gott!</i>
no! He just fumbled with the breech and cried like a human being
till I came along, and then it was too late."</p>

<p>"What did you do then?" I cried, as the German's heavy bass
tones were pursued and throttled by the palpitating silence.</p>

<p>"I did nothing," said Schreiber, quietly. "Lesohn had told me
what he had done to that brute. Fate&mdash;Nemesis&mdash;call it
what you will&mdash;has funny ways. I looked at the orang-outang,
and he backed away from me, crying. And he looked back a dozen
times, still crying, till the jungle swallowed him up. Somewhere
out there"&mdash;the German waved a hand at the dark forest that
was watching and listening&mdash;"there is an orang-outang with a
tragedy on his mind."</p>

</div>
<br>

<p class="first">THE tropic sun, looking like a flaming
truck-wheel, lurched behind the blue smear of jungle that marked
the horizon, and the heat-smitten trees waved their tops
languidly, as if congratulating each other on the fact that the
blazing afternoon had come to an end. A soft purring note came
from the underbrush where the panting birds felt the first breath
of cool air from the ocean. The purple haze of the dusk filmed
the landscape, softening the outline of the distant hills that
the rays of the westering sun had made wonderfully distinct.</p>

<p>Ford, the tall American, lifted himself upon one elbow and
looked across the clearing. He called Hochdorf, the naturalist,
by name, and, receiving no answer, sprang from the hammock and
ran to the end of the veranda that extended the full length of
the lonely bungalow. Here he stopped with a grunt of astonishment
and gazed toward a clump of mohor trees to the right of the
little dwelling. Hochdorf was kneeling in front of the clump, his
rifle pointed at the shadows beneath the great trunks, and
Ford watched him intently. Three times the German naturalist
removed the rifle from his shoulder, and three times whipped it
sharply back into place. The American was puzzled. He could see
nothing, and he muttered to himself as he watched the kneeling
marksman.</p>

<p>"It must be a wild boar," he breathed. "There's nothing&mdash;
Gee! did you get it Hochdorf?"</p>

<p>Ford had sprung from the veranda as the German fired, and the
curiosity with which he had viewed the actions of the naturalist
was increased a thousand times as he raced across the clearing.
Hochdorf had dropped the rifle on the grass the moment he had
fired, and when the American reached his side he was mopping the
perspiration from his forehead with a large bandanna. He was pale
and sick looking, and his deep-sunken blue eyes were fixed on the
spot he had fired at.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Ford. "What did you shoot at?"</p>

<p>The German pointed at the underbrush with a shaking
forefinger. "See, did I&mdash;I get him?" he cried. "Do not show
him to me! I cannot look at such a thing!"</p>

<p>Wondering much, Ford approached the bushes, kicked them aside
with the point of his shoe and disclosed a huge black rat, vainly
attempting to drag its mutilated carcass to safety.</p>

<p>"Why, it's a rat!" he cried. "A rat as big as a prairie
dog!"</p>

<p>"<i>Ja</i>, I know!" gasped the German. "Do not bring it out!
<i>Himmel!</i> no! I cannot look at a rat without being sick. I
am sick as the devil now!"</p>

<p>Ford dispatched the injured rodent and followed the big
naturalist to the veranda of the bungalow. Hochdorf called for a
glass of gin, and when the Dyak boy had brought a stiff nobbier,
he drained it hastily and sank back in the big desk chair as if
exhausted by the happening. For a few minutes he did not speak,
then he turned to the wondering American.</p>

<p>"A rat is the only living thing that I cannot handle," he said
slowly. "I would sooner handle a king cobra or one of those
little poisonous kraits that can put you in Charon's ferryboat
inside three hours. I have been made sick by that rat.
<i>Ach!</i> yes! Did I ever tell you of the Phantom Ship of Dirk
Van Tromp? <i>Nein?</i> Well, it is hot indoors, and if you like
I will tell it to you now. There is a countryman of yours in that
story, and it might interest you."</p>

<p>Ford pulled his chair closer, and the German continued.</p>

<p>"He was a fine fellow was that American. His name was Delnard,
and I owe him my life. He thinks I have paid him back, but I am
not sure.</p>

<p>"Delnard and I were going from Trengganu to Pathia, and we had
a passage on the <i>Lost Peri</i>, a schooner owned by a
Singapore pearl buyer. The mate of that schooner was as much like
me as one mangosteen is like another, and that was unlucky. It
was mighty unlucky. The Malay boatswain had a grudge against the
mate, and one evening when I was looking over the rail something
fell on the back of my head, and before my knees had time to sag
I was lifted up and tipped overboard. Before I lost my senses I
had come to the conclusion that it was the mast that had fallen
on my head. I did so!</p>

<p>"When I got my wits back I found that the schooner had waddled
off into the night, leaving me and the man who had rescued me to
look after ourselves. And I knew that it was Delnard, the
American, who had rescued me. Fill up your glass and we will
drink to him. By the bones of St. Philip of Neri, he was a brave
man!</p>

<p>"After awhile we struck a fringe of mangrove trees, and
Delnard hauled me ashore.</p>

<p>"'How are you?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'My head aches,' I said. 'Did the mast fall on me?'</p>

<p>"Delnard laughed when I asked that question. 'That Malay
boatswain thought that you were the mate,' he said. 'He walloped
you on the head with a jack-block and hoisted you overboard.'</p>

<p>"I started to thank Delnard, but he clapped his hand over my
mouth, and I was quiet. I was mighty quiet.</p>

<p>"'There is someone talking on the other side of this clump of
trees,' he whispered. 'Don't make a noise till we see who it
is.'</p>

<p>"That American started to climb through the slimy trunks of
the mangrove trees, and I followed him. For about ten yards we
crawled on our hands and knees, then we peered out through the
branches. The moon was full and immediately in front of us was a
patch of white sand that glittered like diamond dust.</p>

<p>"It was then that we saw the Green-eyed Woman and the monk. I
shall always call her the Green-eyed Woman, <i>Ja</i>. I will! As
we peered through the bushes her face was turned toward us, and
her eyes shone like the two emeralds in the face of the cat-eyed
goddess, Pasht, that they worshiped at Bubastis thousands of
years ago. <i>Himmel!</i> they were wonderful eyes! When I saw
them shining like that I thought of the stories that the Shans
tell of the Queen of the Leopards who takes the shape of a
beautiful woman so that she can torture the men who hunt the
leopard folk. For that woman was beautiful. She looked like a
naiad taking a rest on that strip of white sand, and Delnard and
I stared with all our eyes.</p>

<p>"She wore the most wondrous sarong that we had ever seen. It
was the most wonderful sarong that ever was made. It was
purple&mdash;the peculiar wicked purple that they can make at
Srinager and Saharanpur, and it suited that woman. She was
wicked-looking. She was so. She was lithe and tigerish, and those
green eyes and that mane of gold that fell down over her breasts,
made her look unreal. Many a day have I wondered how she came by
those green eyes and that golden hair. I have seen nearly every
breed of woman between Blair Harbor and Okhotsk, but I have never
seen one like her. Never!</p>

<p>"'Look at the man,' whispered Delnard. 'Look at him!'</p>

<p>"I tore my eyes away from the woman and looked at her
companion. He was a monk, a long, lean, bare-polled monk, wrapped
in a yellow robe, and he stood in the center of that sand patch
with one arm stuck out like the statue of Friedrich Wilhelm in
the Knigstrasse. And he was talking. It was his voice that we
heard when we were on the other side of the mangrove clump, but
we could not hear him speaking when we were looking at the
Green-eyed Woman. Her beauty had made us deaf to noises. It had
so.</p>

<p>"But when we had wrenched our eyes away from the purple sarong
and the curtain of golden hair, our ears got a chance to listen
to what the monk was saying. He had some leaves of the talipot
palm in his hand, and he was reading that woman a story. He was
reading her a story, my friend, a story that was more wonderful
than any that Scherezade told to the sultan. He would read a
little and then he would explain it to her, and we listened to
that story with every fiber of our beings. We could follow him in
what he said, and we listened like two hill tigers waiting for
the deer to come down to the watering place.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard anything of the Phantom Ship? <i>Ja</i>,
you have heard a little; I know. You have heard the stories that
the old maids tell on the veranda of the Minto Mansions Hotel at
Rangoon. I heard those stories when I first came to the East.
They will tell you of the phantom ship that beats up and down the
China Sea from Pulo Tiuman to Koh Pennan, but that bare-polled
monk knew more than those old women. He knew why that ship was
kept in the South China Sea. Ay, he did so. He knew the history
of the whole business, and he was telling it to the Green-eyed
Woman when Delnard and I found them on the sand patch. My
friend, there are things happening in the Orient today that are
just as wonderful as the things that took place in the reigns of
Omar and Osman and the gay old Haroun.</p>

<p>"That was a wonderful story that we heard. Dirk Van Tromp, a
big-nosed Dutchman from Amsterdam, rocked round the Cape of Good
Hope in his old high-pooped ship and came up to the China Sea
with his nose sniffing the south wind to get the scent of gold.
That was a few days ago. It was before Buxar, and before Plassey.
The Dutch were great rovers in those days, and Dirk Van Tromp and
his bunch were the toughest that ever crept out of the fogs of
the Zuyder Zee.</p>

<p>"That Dutchman had a nose for gold that was sharper than the
snout of a Colombo Chetty. He could smell a piece of treasure a
hundred leagues away, and once he got a whiff of the yellow metal
he would circle round like a vulture swinging over carrion till
he got his big hands on the stuff.</p>

<p>"Van Tromp heard that there was much treasure in an old gray
monastery that was tucked away in the hills above Tahkechi, and
he swore an oath on his big flat blade that the treasure would be
his in a mighty short time. He was a determined gentleman was
Mynheer Van Tromp. Delnard and I lay in the shadow of those
mangrove trees, and we listened to the bare-polled monk telling
the Green-eyed Woman how the Dutchman went backward and forward
in his old high-pooped ship trying to think out a plan to get at
that hoard. And the monks in that monastery knew that the
big-nosed pirate was waiting to get a chance at the gold and
jewels in the vaults. You bet they did. They looked out from
their towers and saw that Dutch ship go up and down like a big
white-winged bird of prey, and they didn't say any prayers for
Mynheer Van Tromp. Not any prayers that would do him good.</p>

<p>"Now the keeper of the keys of the treasure vault was a young
monk who had never seen a woman. Never! Mind you, this is the
story that the bare-polled monk read from the leaves of the
talipot palm. He told her that the treasure keeper had been found
in a paddy-field by the monks of the monastery when he was a
little baby, and they had reared him inside the walls till he
grew up and became one of them. He had never seen a woman at a
distance even. That place was quite some distance from a village,
and that youngster was not allowed to stray. But the monks liked
him, and when he grew up they gave him the keys of the vault and
made him the guardian of all the wealth that was stored there
from the time of Tamerlane.</p>

<p>"For three months that thieving Dutchman rolled up and down
the coast, and the monks stayed inside their walls and waited.
The head priest gave an order that the big gate should not be
opened while Van Tromp was on the coast, and, to make matters
more secure, he asked that young monk to stay in his cell and
keep the keys with him. They were afraid of the Dutchman, and
they had good reason to be. He was a fiend. He waited for an idea
to get into his big, round head, and at the end of three months
that idea came. And it was a devil of an idea. <i>Ja</i>, it
was.</p>

<p>"Can you guess what that Dutchman did? He went down to Sebah,
and he got a temple dancing girl who was as beautiful as the
singing houris in the seventh heaven. She was more beautiful than
Mura, whose loveliness killed the seven Nubians who dared to look
upon her. She had eyes that she stole from Helen of Troy, and
hair that was of the bronze tint that you see on the wing of the
bird of paradise. That was what the monk told the Green-eyed
Woman. Her little feet were so small that the children's slippers
in the bazaar fell from them, and her hands were like the petals
of a flower.</p>

<p>"When the bare-polled monk was telling of her hands and feet,
the woman with the green eyes stopped him and put a question.</p>

<p>"'Was she more lovely than I?' she asked.</p>

<p>"'I am only reading what is written on the palm leaves,' said
the monk.</p>

<p>"'But was she?' persisted the woman. 'Tell me at once.'</p>

<p>"'No,' stammered the monk, 'she was lovely, but not as lovely
as you!'</p>

<p>"When he said that to the woman she laughed in a way that
chilled my blood. She gave Delnard a chill too. It was a devil of
a laugh. It was a laugh of scorn, a laugh of contempt. If a man
laughed in the same way you would have killed him with the
nearest thing you could get your hands on. <i>Ach!</i> I have
never heard anyone laugh in the way that woman laughed.</p>

<p>"The monk went on with his story, and Delnard and I listened
in the shadows. Dirk Van Tromp and his crew took that girl up to
the monastery one night when the moon was at the full, and I
choked with temper as I listened. The window of the cell in which
the young guardian of the treasure slept looked out over the
wall, and when that young monk got up from his prayers on that
night he looked out on the moonlit hillside. <i>Gott im
Himmel!</i> It was a dirty trick to play on that youngster. When
he looked through the bars of his cell window he saw that temple
dancing girl pirouetting in the middle of that grassy patch, and
she looked like a silvered houri!</p>

<p>"That Dutchman was a cunning devil, was he not? He was hiding
with his men in the bushes, and that girl was dancing the Dance
of the Seven Delights before the eyes of that monk who had never
seen a woman till that moment. He pressed his lean face against
the bars and watched with eyes of astonishment. She was the first
woman that he had ever seen, and she was one of the loveliest of
her kind. It was not a fair trick, my friend. It was not!</p>

<p>"That girl danced and danced. That bare-polled monk described
that dance to the Green-eyed Woman, and he described it so well
that I could picture everything. I saw that moonlit hillside, and
I saw the girl dancing that intoxicating dance to the poor devil
in the cell, and I saw Dirk Van Tromp and his crew waiting in the
shadows for the climax of that little performance. I never felt
like smashing the bones of a dead man as I did on that night when
we listened to that yarn.</p>

<p>"And the climax came to that affair. The dancing girl stopped
dancing after she had driven that young monk half crazy, and she
beckoned to him to come out to her. Beckoned to that poor devil
who was wondering if she was a spirit from another world. He
forgot all the orders of the head priest when she did that. He
forgot everything. He only knew that someone more beautiful than
the white orchids of the valley was waiting for him outside the
walls, and he rushed madly into the corridor.</p>

<p>"It was then that the Lord Buddha took pity on that poor fool.
He performed a miracle by stretching a silver wire across the
corridor as the treasure guardian was hurrying along. A silver
wire, my friend. But that monk was not in a fit state to see a
miracle when it was performed right under his nose. His brain and
his blood were aflame with the sight of the vision that he had
seen in the moonlight, and he hacked that wire through with his
knife. That is how the monk read it from the palm leaves to that
witch-woman lying on the sand.</p>

<p>"The treasure guardian dropped his knife in his hurry, and he
did not wait to pick it up. He ran on like a madman. But it was
clean love that was drawing him to that girl, my friend. Ay, it
was! And just because his love was good and sweet, Buddha
performed another miracle. The Great One stretched a gold wire
that blazed like a flaming thread across that corridor. The
treasure guardian had no knife, but he had his two hands. He
gripped that thread of gold and snapped it. Then he rushed down
the dark passage.</p>

<p>"The blood pounded through my head as I listened to that part
of the story. I believed that yarn! If you had heard that
bare-polled monk read it to the woman you would have believed it,
too. It was one of those stories where the truth shines through
the little places between the words.</p>

<p>"The treasure guardian ran across the courtyard toward the big
gates that the High priest had ordered to be closed while Dirk
Van Tromp was on the coast, and as he raced across the yard,
Buddha made another attempt to save him. The Holy One flung a
rope in front of that youngster, a rope whose ends went up into
the clouds, but that monk could not be stopped by anything just
then. <i>Nein!</i> He had no knife, and he could not break that
rope with his hands, so what do you think he did? He gnawed that
rope through with his teeth, then he opened the big gates and
rushed out to the dancing girl who was standing like a silver
statue of Aphrodite in the moonlight!</p>

<p>"In the morning the monks of the monastery found the treasure
guardian trussed up like a capon, and they also found that the
treasure chamber was empty. Dirk Van Tromp and his crew of
cutthroats did not leave an ounce of gold behind them, and you
can just guess what sort of a temper the head priest was in. The
treasure guardian told him of the dancing girl in the moonlight,
and the old ancient went crazy with temper. He sentenced that
young monk to be buried up to the neck in the sand at the point
where the girl stood, and when that was done they left him there,
bareheaded, and the sun licked at him like the hot tongue of a
dragon.</p>

<p>"Every morning for six mornings the monks paraded past that
poor devil who was buried in the sand. His tongue and his lips
were black and swollen, but they could see that he was praying
for forgiveness. They could see that. He was sorry for what he
had done, but he blamed himself. He did not blame the girl that
had lured him outside so that the Dutch pirates could pounce on
him.</p>

<p>"On the morning of the seventh day the head priest and the
rest of the monks got a surprise. Ay, a big surprise. When they
went out to look at that poor wretch they found the temple
dancing girl lying on the sand close to the spot where he was
buried, and she was dead. Dead and cold. She had become sorry for
what she had done in bringing him to his ruin and death. She knew
that it was love and not lust that had brought him out to her,
and she had come back to tell him that she was sorry. But it was
too late to tell him that. She found him dying in the sand, and
when he would not let her dig him out of that pit she killed
herself beside him.</p>

<p>"The young monk was still alive, and as he looked as if he
wished to say something they put water on his swollen tongue so
that he was able to speak a little. Then he told them something
that made their flesh creep. He said that Buddha had appeared to
him in the night, and that the Great One had told him that Dirk
Van Tromp would never take the treasure out of the China Sea.
Never! He said that it was written that the Dutchman's ship would
beat up and down between Pulo Tiuman and Koh Pennan for all time.
At every full moon it would rock past the monastery, and if there
was a monk in that place who was brave enough to swim out to the
ship and recover the treasure, the souls of the treasure guardian
and the temple dancing girl would find peace. When the young monk
told them that he uttered a little prayer to Buddha and died.</p>

<p>"That was a strange story to listen to in the moonlight, was
it not? The bare-polled monk looked at the Green-eyed Woman when
he had read all that was on the palm leaves, and the woman looked
at the big moon that was swinging over the hills. Delnard and I
watched her green eyes flash, and we thought things. All the
wonder of the East was in those eyes. They were as cold as the
icicle eye of a crocodile at times, and then they would soften
suddenly so that one felt that he was being dragged toward that
witch on the sand.</p>

<p>"'And you believe that the Dutchman's ship goes up and down
the coast to this day?' asked the woman.</p>

<p>"'It is written here,' said the monk, tapping the palm leaves.
'They say that it goes by on the night of the full moon. The
monks of the monastery looked out many times after that
happening, and they saw that ship go rocking by, the moonlight
flashing on her gilt figurehead.'</p>

<p>"'And now?' she questioned.</p>

<p>"'I have waited for eight nights,' answered the monk,' and I
am certain that she will go by tonight.'</p>

<p>"'And you will swim out?' queried the witch-woman.</p>

<p>"'If you go with me,' muttered the monk. 'My heart would turn
to water if you were not near me.'</p>

<p>"She laughed again, that cursed sneering laugh that made one
wish she was a man so that one could strike her dead, and just as
she laughed I did something that caused a sensation. A mighty big
sensation. There were some wild capsicum bushes under those
mangrove trees, and those bushes made me sneeze. <i>Ja!</i> I
sneezed loud enough to wake the dead, and before I had stopped
sneezing, Delnard was out in the clearing explaining to the woman
and the monk how we came to be there.</p>

<p>"That American had a smooth tongue. You bet he had. The monk
looked right mad, but the Green-eyed Woman was not disturbed one
bit. She listened to Delnard's story with a smile on her face,
and when he finished she started to question him.</p>

<p>"'So you heard the story that he read to me?' she said,
pointing to the monk as she spoke.</p>

<p>"'Yes, I heard,' said Delnard. 'It was a mighty good story,
too.'</p>

<p>"'Do you think the ship will come?' she asked.</p>

<p>"'I do not know,' said Delnard, grinning at her, 'but if it
does come along I'd like to go out with you when you board
it.'</p>

<p>"She smiled when he said that, but  cursed him for a fool.
That was not our business at all, and there was something in the
night that I did not like.  I had that sort of gooseflesh feeling
that makes people say that someone has jumped over their grave.
'You can come with us,' said the woman. 'Sit down and wait.'</p>

<p>"Delnard and  sat down on the white sand, and I kept thinking
of that story as I watched the woman with the emerald eyes. I was
afraid of her. I was so. She had the appearance of a sphinx, a
sphinx that had just come to life, and who would laugh as she
crushed one beneath her feet.</p>

<p>"'Why do you want to stay here?' I asked Delnard. 'It is
foolishness.'</p>

<p>"'We will stay for the fun of the thing,' he said, and he
laughed because he saw that I was nervous of the woman. 'We will
have to stay till dawn to find our way from this place, so we
might as well stay close to a mystery.'</p>

<p>"'You are a fool,' I said. 'That woman's eyes remind me of the
eyes of the hamadryad.'</p>

<p>"The night was a silent night, one of those nights when you
feel that the <i>lieber Gott</i> has slowed up the wheels of the
planet before doing something that will make you sit up and take
notice. The silence came around us like a cloak, and the longer
we waited the more annoyed  was with Delnard. I did not believe
in phantom ships, but I thought as I sat there on the sand that
it was the kind of night that you would expect ghostly things of
that class to go wandering around.</p>

<p>"A wispy fog came creeping in from the Gulf of Siam, a
creeping, low-lying fog that was wet and cold like the hand of a
corpse. It swept over us, touching our faces as if it had a
million invisible fingers, and it surged up the estuary. I was
shivering then with cold and suspense, and I cursed under my
breath.</p>

<p>"'This is foolishness,' I said to Delnard. 'It is nonsense to
wait here any longer.'</p>

<p>"That woman with the emerald eyes turned her head as if to
listen to what I said, and then she gave a little suppressed
scream that made my blood run cold. It was not a scream of fear.
<i>Nein!</i> It was a scream of amazement and wonder.</p>

<p>"'Look!' she cried. 'Look!'</p>

<p>"She was pointing up the estuary, and we looked. <i>Ja</i>, we
looked. We stared with our eyes popping out. That fog was thin
and broken, and through a break in that curtain we saw something
that startled us. The monk and Delnard, the Green-eyed Woman and
I saw, my friend. Now you can laugh when I tell you what we saw,
but I did not laugh that night. Waddling down through that rent
in the fog, her broken masts thrust up like black fingers, and
her high poop tilted up like the tail of a Muscovy drake, was a
ship that was out of fashion a hundred years before!</p>

<p><i>"Himmel</i>, didn't we stare! I rubbed my eyes and I looked
and looked, thinking that it was a mirage, but it was no mirage.
It was an old Dutch ship that was of the same type that Van Edels
and Pelsart and Dampier and Van Deiman used when they first
stirred the foam of the Eastern seas with bull-snouted craft that
were built at Antwerp!</p>

<p><i>"'Aie! Aie'</i> gurgled the monk, as he climbed to his feet
and stared at the old ship that was heading for the open sea. 'It
is she! It is she!' he cried.</p>

<p>"That monk was a mighty scared man at that minute. It was all
right to read about the phantom ship, but it was a different
business to watch that black hulk breaking through the wispy fog.
You bet it was. That bare-polled storyteller looked as if he was
inclined to sneak away into the mangrove trees, but the
Green-eyed Woman looked him up and down, and he seemed to stiffen
under her eyes.</p>

<p>"'Shades of Caesar!' cried Delnard. 'Did you ever see the like
of that?'</p>

<p>"'I did not,' I snapped, and my lips were dry as I spoke to
him.</p>

<p>"That woman was the only one of us who did not lose their
wits. While we were staring at the apparition that was drifting
down toward the point where we were standing, she was calculating
the distance and thinking which would be the best place to
intercept that ship. That woman had nerves of steel. She was like
that jade who was married to Menelaus of Sparta; she could stand
by and see battle and bloody murder without turning a hair. She
could do anything.</p>

<p>"'We'll swim out from here,' she said, pointing to the water.
'Get ready or we will miss her.'</p>

<p>"Delnard looked at me, and I glared back at him. I was mighty
mad with him at that moment.</p>

<p>"'What will we do?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'Do?' I snapped. 'We will do nothing! What has this fool
business to do with us?'</p>

<p>"That woman was standing in front of me when I said that. She
was twisting that purple sarong around her hips, and she heard
what I said. <i>Ja</i>, she heard. She took three steps into the
water, and then she turned her head and laughed at Delnard and
me. Laughed that cursed sneering laugh that she had turned on the
monk when he was telling the story. Holy St. Catherine! I have
never heard a laugh in all my life like that! It was like a whip
of scorn. It would drive men to their death quicker than anything
I know of. She called us curs with that laugh! Do you understand?
It was a lash that made us feel like worms, and the next moment
we were in the water, swimming beside her and the bare-polled
monk.</p>

<p>"We were swimming in a line, the four of us. I guess we were
mad, my friend. It is foolish to sit out on the sand on moonlight
nights and listen to stories of the kind that we had listened to
that night. There is witchery in the air of this Orient, and one
does foolish things under its influence.</p>

<p>"The fog closed in on us and blotted out the black shape of
the ship, and I stopped swimming. I had what you call cold feet
just then, but that laugh was ringing in my ears. I was tired of
that business, and my head was aching from the blow that the
Malay boatswain of the <i>Lost Peri</i> had given me. I could not
see Delnard just then, and I shouted out to him.</p>

<p>"'Where are you, Delnard?' I cried.</p>

<p>"'Here,' he answered, speaking out of the fog, and just as he
spoke, that thick curtain was split apart and I saw the black
hulk of the old Dutch ship rolling down on us. <i>Ach!</i> I can
see her now as I saw her that night. There was a little smother
of foam at her forefoot, and she had a coating of barnacles that
the Kiel shipyards could not peel off in a week. Then the fog
closed in again, and I heard the voice of the Green-eyed Woman
calling from above me. That witch-woman had got a grip on the
side of that craft and she was calling the three of us to
her.</p>

<p>"I made a clutch at the rotten timbers as the ship lurched
past me, but my fingers slipped on the slime. I made another grab
at her, and this time I caught the rotten timbers of a porthole,
and I clawed myself up out of the water. That woman was calling
out to us, and I knew by the shouts that came from the fog that
Delnard and the monk had got a footing on the old hulk as she
slewed by. Driving my toes into those barnacles and scratching
with my fingers at the rotten wood I climbed higher, and
presently that woman's fingers gripped my shoulder and dragged me
over the side. Delnard and the monk were close behind me, and
when we hauled them aboard we stood a moment to get our
breath.</p>

<p>"It was just as we stood there near the rotten bulwarks that
the old boat drove out of the bank of fog. She lurched out of it
suddenly, and the moon washed us in a bath of silver. That was
when the monk gave the yell. He gave a yell that you could hear
down at Sebah where the temple dancing girl came from, and he
pointed to the deck in front of us. For a moment we did not see
what he pointed at, then our throats went dry like as if we had
been swallowing lime. That deck was alive! It was alive with
rats!</p>

<p>"That is the reason why that rat turned me sick a few minutes
ago. I think of those rats on the Dutch ship every time I see
one. And those rats on that hulk were the biggest rats I have
ever seen. The Paris sewer rats, the gray rats of the Orinoco,
and the big black rats you see on the canals at Bangkok were
small things compared to those devils on the rotten deck of that
old craft. They were huge brutes, and there were thousands of
them. Thousands! They were crawling up from the hold in armies
that moved across the deck so that we could not see an inch of
the rotten boards!</p>

<p>"'Look out!' I cried. 'They are attacking us!'</p>

<p>"I made a movement to drop over the side of the ship, but that
woman was too quick for me. She was too quick for me.
<i>Nein</i>, she did not block me with her hands. She laughed at
me. I tried to fight against the feeling that came over me, but I
could not. I would not have been a man if I ran when she laughed
as she did. It would take a mighty good coward to run away when
that sneer came from her red lips. You bet it would. Delnard had
turned to the rail when I turned, but she stopped both of us. I
do not know how the piece of wood got into my hands, but I guess
she gave it to me. She was the only one who could think and act.
She thrust that stick into my hands, and then I struck at the
army that was circling toward us.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen rats attack men? Once before I had seen
it, but I had never seen anything like the charge I saw on that
deck. Those rats were mad with hunger. That old boat had been
stranded up that estuary for a century, and she had become a
castle for those big rats. I do not know how the tide had shifted
her, perhaps she had broken loose from the trunks of the mangrove
trees, but that rat army had come with her, and when we boarded
her they were hungry. They were mighty hungry. There were
thousands of them there, and they were eating each other when
that witch-woman brought three fools aboard, <i>Gott!</i> The
sight of that brute brought it all back this afternoon, and I am
sick yet. I will be sick for a week. I know I will.</p>

<p>"'Fight them!' cried the woman. 'Fight them!'</p>

<p>"It was our only hope, my friend. We had to fight like demons
to hold those squeaking things off. The deck was covered with
them, yet they were still crawling up through the rotten planks
from below. It was a nightmare, and a terror struck into my
bones. As I swung that stick I thought that the whole business
was some devilish plan to get us on board that hulk, and I fought
like a madman. So did Delnard. So did the monk, and the
Green-eyed Woman. As I watched her for a few seconds I knew that
I was wrong in thinking that it was a plot against Delnard and
myself. She was a crazy woman. She had become possessed with the
idea that the old hulk was really the ship that Dirk Van Tromp
had sailed in, and that monk was of the same opinion.</p>

<p>"'Fight them back!' screamed the woman. 'The treasure will be
on the lower deck.'</p>

<p>"'We are insane,' I cried to Delnard, but he did not hear me.
That laugh had made him lose control of himself, and he was
slaughtering rats with a plank that it would take a Samson to
lift.</p>

<p>"The rats broke before us, and the woman led us on. Led us on
across the rotten deck where the cross beams had crumbled beneath
the three-inch planks of oak. You can hardly believe it, can you?
I was sweating with fear, but I could not turn and run as I
wanted to. There was a squeaking in the bowels of the ship that
made me feel sure that anyone that ventured down there would go
to his death, yet every time that woman gave one of her steely
laughs I swung that lump of wood harder than ever. She was a
witch, I am sure she was. 'Take a rest!' she cried, and we
stopped for a moment to get our breath.</p>

<p>"But those rats were waiting for us to take that rest. They
swept over the deck in one thick mass, and we were at it again. I
stuck my foot in a hole and fell down, but Delnard lifted me to
my feet again. Lifted me to my feet after three score of those
things had rushed over me. And she laughed and rushed us forward
against the swarms that were pouring out of the holes in the
planks.</p>

<p>"It was then that the Almighty heard the prayer that I was
making. <i>Ja</i>, he heard me then. As I picked my club from the
deck after I slipped, my hand clutched some oakum, and when I
stumbled on after that mad jade I got an idea. I got an idea that
meant salvation to Delnard and me. You cannot guess what that
idea was? I stuffed that oakum in my ears, my friend. I stuffed
it in with one hand while I fought with the other. <i>Ja! Ja!</i>
I knew that I could not turn back while that jade was laughing
her laugh of scorn, so I made myself so that I could not hear her
laugh. I fixed myself in just the same way that old Ulysses fixed
his sailors a few thousand years before. I plugged my ears so
that I could not hear the squeaking of the rats or her laugh, and
then I dropped my stick and rushed at Delnard. I ran him to the
side of the ship, and when he fought with me I hit him a crack on
the jaw and toppled him overboard as the Malay boatswain had
toppled me some hours before.</p>

<p>"I had luck then. I sprang over and found him in the shadow of
the hulk, and, grabbing him by the hair of the head I struck out
for shore. Once I looked back, and I saw that old black ship
moving towards the open sea and I swam faster. Fear was in my
marrow just then. My teeth were chattering together, and I could
hardly speak when I pulled Delnard ashore.</p>

<p>"'Where is she?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'She has gone to sea with the rats and the mad monk,' I
said.</p>

<p>"'Glory be to God!' he said and then he broke down and cried.
And my nerves were that bad that I cried with him. I have been in
a thousand tight places, but I was never in one that made me feel
so queer as I felt on that night.</p>

<p>"We fell asleep on the sand, and we slept there till the sun
climbed out of the sea and pricked our faces and hands. There was
not a sign of a hulk. We stared at the sea for ten minutes or
more, then Delnard got to his feet and shook himself.</p>

<p>"'We had better strike toward the south,' he said, and I went
with him without making any protest.</p>

<p>"We walked about two miles without speaking, and then we found
her. The Green-eyed Woman. <i>Ja!</i> We found her on the beach,
her mane of gold covering her face as if the sea had tried to
hide the staring eyes. In her left hand she had a tiny statue of
Siva that had a Mogok ruby in its breast, and I wanted badly to
get that little statue. But Delnard would not let me take it from
her hand. He would not. We made a grave on the beach, and we
buried her there."</p>

<p class="verse">
Her eyes were blue, and her soul was white;<br>

His soul had sunk to the soul of a beast.<br>

Yet her love was so great that she found him at last<br>

In the sun-smitten, sin-stricken East.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">HOCHDORF, the German naturalist, sat with Ford,
the tall American, upon the veranda of the little bungalow in
which the German lived, and they looked down at the stretch of
rice-white sand upon which the rollers of the China Sea flung
themselves incessantly.</p>

<p>Along the white sand walked a slim Dyak girl, and Ford,
nodding towards her, put a question to the naturalist.</p>

<p>"What is wrong with her?" asked the American. "I have been
watching her for days, and I have noticed her stoop down
occasionally as if she was listening when an extra big roller
sweeps up the beach."</p>

<p>"She is listening&mdash;listening to the voice of a dead man,"
replied Hochdorf. "Five years ago a Dyak boy whom she loved was
snapped up by a shark out beyond the reef, and since that time
she has been listening to the waves because she thinks they bring
messages to her."</p>

<p>"By Jove, that's sad," muttered Ford.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is sad," said the naturalist slowly. "Today you said
something about dollars ruling the world. You are wrong, my
friend. It is love that rules the world. Would you like me to
tell you a story to prove what I say? It is a story that is a
little bigger than the story of that girl whom you see walking
along the beach listening to the messages from a boy that a tiger
shark gobbled up five years ago."</p>

<p>Hochdorf took his big meerschaum from his mouth and nodded
towards the beach. The slim native girl was stooping down, her
head upon one side, as a giant wave came bounding from the China
Sea to sprawl upon the silvery sands.</p>

<p>"I will tell you this story from the start," said the
naturalist. "About seven years ago I was collecting specimens in
the Malay Peninsula. Some crazy fool at Berlin had given a big
order for different breeds of monkeys to my house at Amsterdam,
and I was kept busy. I was after those monkeys night and day. And
those things that I was hunting were the means of bringing me in
contact with the girl whom I am going to tell you of.</p>

<p>"A French naturalist at Hue told me of a Shan who knew the
jungle so well that he could sit in a clearing and make a noise
with his mouth that would bring those monkeys that I was seeking
to him. So I went one night into a place that was not a nice
place, looking for that Shan. It was a place that had only a
tissue paper between it and hell. It was a place where the
foulest brutes on the coast congregated, and you were sucking in
big mouthfuls of soul-poison every time you drew a breath.</p>

<p>"I was sitting there in that reek of opium when the door of
the place opened and someone came in out of the velvety night.
Someone came in from the alley and walked up the middle of the
room, and it seemed to me that the Almighty had sent a breath
from heaven into that place.</p>

<p>"The visitor was a girl. She was wondrously beautiful. For
five-and-twenty years I never remember seeing any woman who did
such credit to her Maker. My pipe dropped from my mouth, and I
sat and looked at her as she walked slowly up the center of the
room, where four score eyes that showed lust and devilry were
looking at her. All the fires of hell were in the eyes of those
devils as they gazed at her in a silence so great that the little
noises of the night came into that room where three minutes
before there was a chatter of tongues that made my ears ache.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a person walking in their sleep? Well, that
girl looked as if she was walking in her sleep. But she had her
eyes open, and there was a look in those eyes that made me think
that her soul was peering out of them, as if seeking something
that she desired with a great desire. Those eyes were searching
that room for someone, someone whom she thought to find amongst
the brutes that leered and stared at her. She was not aware of
the eyes of lust and devilry that were turned on her like flames.
She walked as if she was in a trance, and I clutched the table
and looked at her.</p>

<p>"I got upon my feet and  gripped the revolver that I carried
in my pocket. A Malay whose nose was flattened all over his face
was walking towards the girl with his arms outstretched, and I
went mad as  looked at the brute. I went crazy because I was
afraid that he would put his fingers on her.</p>

<p>"'Keep off,' I yelled. 'Keep away.'</p>

<p>"The brute looked at me and laughed.</p>

<p>"'Why?'he cried.</p>

<p>"'Keep off, you dog!' I roared. And then I drew my revolver
and pointed it at him.</p>

<p><i>"Himmel!</i> It was a crazy business to draw a gun in a
place like that. But I was not myself then. My common sense had
been swept away the moment I saw her face show up through a rift
in the opium smoke, when the night wind that followed her into
that room swept away the yellow cloud as if to purify the place
for her presence.</p>

<p>"But the Malay with the flat face saw nothing of a miracle in
the coming of the girl into that vile place. He walked right up
to her and I upset the table in front of me in rushing to prevent
him touching her.</p>

<p>"I struck at the brute as his hands reached out to the girl. I
struck at him like a madman, and he went down upon the floor. I
must have gone mad. Something snapped within my skull, and I was
a fighting lunatic.</p>

<p>"Those yellow and brown devils rushed at me, and I kicked and
fought and yelled. I was trying to balk them of a prize which
they thought their respective little gods had sent into that
place of sin. They came at me like a wave. My interference
maddened them, and they were willing to tear me to pieces and
toss me out to the dogs that were in the alley.</p>

<p>"I fought and kicked and emptied my pistol at the mob that
rushed me. Afterwards, when I had time to think, I had a feeling
that I was as strong as ten men as I fought with those
devils.</p>

<p>"After what seemed a century, I found myself running down a
side alley away from that den, and on one side of me was the girl
who had come into that place, and on the other side of me was the
Shan whom I have told you of&mdash;the Shan who could sit in the
jungle and talk to those monkeys that made me tired chasing them.
I wanted to pull up, but the Shan, who knew a little about wild
animals, and who knew what that crowd behind me would do if they
caught me, urged me forward.</p>

<p>"'Go ahead,' he cried, speaking in his own tongue. 'They are
after us!'</p>

<p>"And the girl tried to keep me running, too.</p>

<p>"'Run!' she murmured. 'They are coming after us! Listen to
them!'</p>

<p>"I looked at her face as we passed beneath a lamp, and I saw a
change in her. The trance-like look that had been in her eyes
when she entered that little hell had disappeared, and there was
a look of fear there that tore at my heart. It made me wonder as
I ran.</p>

<p>"'Don't stop,' she gasped. 'Run! Run!'</p>

<p>"And I knew when she cried out in that way that she had
awakened out of her trance in time to see the looks of devilry on
the faces of those brutes.</p>

<p>"Their yells came down on the night wind, and we ran on. I was
faint with the loss of blood. I had a cut over my eye and I was
blinded with the blood that came from it. I staggered as I ran,
and the girl put out her hand and gripped my arm, and urged me to
run faster.</p>

<p>"We raced down little alleys and dodged through places that
were like by-ways in hell. And all the time we seemed to hear the
yells of that mob pursuing us&mdash;that mob of brutes who were
cursing their little gods and josses for taking away the prize
that had drifted into that den of filth.</p>

<p>"After a long run we came out on a street that was clean and
well lighted, and we stopped to get our breath. The Shan left us
there. He thought that he was not wanted any more, and he
disappeared up a side street before the girl had time to thank
him.</p>

<p>"Then the girl found a street fountain and she wet her
handkerchief and bathed the wound that I had over my eye. I
protested, but she would do it, and all the time she was babbling
thanks for what I had done.</p>

<p>"'It was good of you,' she sobbed. 'It was very good of you.
You stopped those brutes from touching me. I came to my senses in
time to see their awful faces.'</p>

<p>"'Then you were not in your senses when you went into that
place?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'Yes, I was in my senses, but I did not know where I was
going,' she answered.</p>

<p>"I wondered much at what she told me, but I did not ask any
more questions. She told me that she was staying with a
missionary, and I took her to the missionary's house. And when I
was leaving she asked me to call and see her the following
morning.</p>

<p>"I called next morning, and now I will tell you the story she
told me. It is a story that has made me think very much. When I
think over it I laugh at the man who says that dollars rule the
world as I heard you say not so very long ago. No, my friend, it
is love that rules the world.</p>

<p>"This is the story that she told me. Five years before, her
lover had come out from America to make his fortune. He had sworn
to her father that he would not come back till he had made it.
Her father did not want him back. Do you understand?</p>

<p>"That young fellow was a dreamer who was not the sort of a man
to make his fortune out here. I think the girl's father knew that
much. Perhaps he knew what this country is. He had sized up the
young fellow, and he thought he was not the person who would be
able to fight himself clear of the tentacles of the Orient.
Perhaps he laughed to himself when the youngster started out for
this spot to make the money with which to marry the girl with the
blue eyes.</p>

<p>"When the girl was telling me of the boy who had come out
here, I pictured him. She told me what he was like, and she
described him with the eyes of love so that she pointed out his
weaknesses without knowing that they were weaknesses.</p>

<p>"And it made me feel sick as I listened. My imagination
pictured that young fellow coming out to this place. I pictured
him with the face that was not the face of a fighter coming out
here where the atmosphere and the century-old smells that come
from the ground throttle a young man's morals and damn his
soul.</p>

<p>"I have seen hundreds go the path that my imagination told me
that young fellow had gone. For three years the young man wrote
letters to the girl away over there in America. For three years
he wrote letters to her, always telling her what he was going to
do, for he was one of those men who dream of big jobs which they
have not got the strength to do. She showed me his letters, and I
read them through with a pain in my heart. She couldn't see what
I saw. They were the letters of a man who was fighting a losing
battle, and who was trying to make himself think that it was a
winning one by putting foolish words on paper and looking at
them.</p>

<p>"I could not tell the girl what I thought. I could not fling a
shadow on those blue eyes that were like little bits of the
heavens on a May morning. I could only shake my head as she
unfolded her story bit by bit.</p>

<p>"'You see he was always fighting to get on,' she said. 'That
is why he went from place to place looking for an opening.'</p>

<p>"For three years the young fellow wrote letters to her. Then
his letters stopped. I wonder how many mothers, and sisters, and
sweethearts there are in the world who know the heart pain that
comes when the letters of young men, like the letters of that
girl's young man, stop all of a sudden.</p>

<p>"For two years he did not write a single word. Then the girl's
father died. He died, and his death gave the girl a surprise. She
had thought that he was poor. He had told her that he was poor.
He had told her that he could not give the boy a penny piece to
start him in business in America. But she found that he had been
wealthy, and she prayed that she might not remember him with
bitterness for sending away from her the boy whom she had loved
with all her soul.</p>

<p>"Now, you will understand a little bit of what I want to tell
you. She came to Calcutta, which was the last place from which
the young man had written, and she sought him there. It makes my
heart sick to think of it. She searched for him up and down, and
after she had given up all hope of striking a trail, a curious
thing happened to her. It is an unbelievable thing to a man who
does not know the East. While she was hunting for that boy in the
slums of Calcutta with her nerves upon a great strain, she passed
one day a place where she thought he had once been. She had no
proof that he had ever visited that place, but as she was going
by the door, she had a desire to enter it to see if he was there.
She had a great desire&mdash;a desire that was so great she could
not overcome it.</p>

<p>"She went in and searched for him. And after she came out, she
was amazed at what she had done. She was amazed to think that she
had ventured into that little opium hell on the Chitpore
Road.</p>

<p>"She went from Calcutta to Rangoon, from which place he had
written her some two and a half years before. And she had the
same experience at Rangoon. She was attracted to a place, and she
felt sure that the boy had been there at some time. And she was
right on that occasion at Rangoon. She might have been right the
first time, but she had no proof. But she got proof on the second
occasion. Behind the bar of that <i>samshu</i> shop in Rangoon
she found a fly-specked letter addressed to the boy whom she had
not heard of for over two years. It had been waiting in that
place for over eighteen months.</p>

<p>"She left Rangoon and she came on to Singapore, following the
trail left by his letters. She told me what happened at
Singapore. She had two experiences that were similar to those I
have just told you of. And when I questioned her on those two
experiences I felt sick. If she was right in her belief that she
had been drawn to places where he had been, I felt certain that
he was a little lower than I had thought. I was certain that the
tentacles of the Orient had caught him and throttled him.</p>

<p>"In one of those places she had found a man who knew him. A
man who was drugged with the black smoke twenty-three hours out
of twenty-four. In the few minutes that he was in his senses he
told her little things, and she told them to me. And she told
them to me not thinking that there was any harm in what was in
them. Great love never sees a fault, my friend. That girl
wondered over those strange desires to visit places just as much
as I wondered over them.</p>

<p>"'Do you understand why I have entered those places?' she
asked, when she had finished her story. 'Can you explain it?'</p>

<p>"'No, I cannot explain it,' I said. 'There are many things
here that I do not understand.'</p>

<p>"'But you think he might have been in those places?' she
asked.</p>

<p>"'I think he might have been,' I said. 'He might have gone
into them.'</p>

<p>"'To look at them?' she said, and her blue eyes were upon my
face.</p>

<p>"'To look at them,' I repeated. 'Just so.'</p>

<p>"I was sick with a soul sickness when I said that. I am an old
general, and I have been in this East so long that I am able to
go to sleep at night without troubling myself over temptations
that are in the atmosphere that you sniff, and in the silence of
the night, and in the whispers of the trees. I am a German, and
the feet of the Germans are screwed to the ground, so that we are
not knocked over with temptations that upset men who have not our
phlegmatic spirit.</p>

<p>"When she had finished I spoke to her.</p>

<p>"'Go home and forget him,' I said. 'I am an old man and I
know.'</p>

<p>"The pain that showed upon her face hurt me. She looked at me
as if I had struck her a blow. I could have kicked myself for
saying those words.</p>

<p>"'I cannot forget him!' she cried.</p>

<p>"Then I steeled my heart and spoke again to her.</p>

<p>"'You must forget him,' I said. 'I tell you that you must
forget him.'</p>

<p>"She shook her head and looked at me with those blue eyes as
if she was trying to see into my soul to know if I really meant
what I said.</p>

<p>"'I must find him!' she cried.</p>

<p>"I was crazy then to end her search.</p>

<p>"'He might be dead,' I said. 'If a man does not write in two
years from the Orient you must think him dead.'</p>

<p>"And there was truth in what I said. It is dangerous for a man
to forget his relations and friends when he is living here.
Letters are the little anchors. I have seen a man who was on the
verge of insanity made sane by a long letter which came to him
from a girl he loved.</p>

<p>"'He is not dead!' she cried, and her eyes flamed at me till I
thought I was being pricked by rapier points. 'I know that he is
alive! I feel it every day. Sometimes I feel that I am very near
to him, and there are times when I feel that he is far away, but
never have I felt that he is dead.'</p>

<p>"I left Hue that evening and she was the last one I spoke to.
When I was going to the wharf, I called at the little house of
the missionary, and the girl came out on the veranda to say
good-by to me. She knew that I was troubled about her, and she
tried to smile so-that I would think that she was all right.</p>

<p>"'You mustn't worry your head about me.' she said. 'I have
caused you enough trouble already. You will always carry that
mark over your eye to remember me by.'</p>

<p>"'I will remember you without a mark,' I said. 'I will
remember you always.'</p>

<p>"I went up to Shanghai and from there I went up the Wusung
hunting for specimens for my employers in Amsterdam. But the joy
with which I had found things before did not come to me now that
the face of the girl was before my mind. I could think of nothing
but her, and her search for the man who had not written to her
for two years.</p>

<p>"I came back to Shanghai and from there I went to Canton and
spent three months in catching things to ship to Amsterdam. I was
very busy, but still I would think every day about that girl who
was searching for the man who had been caught in the grip of this
infernal Orient.</p>

<p>"I went from Canton to Bangkok. Scheibel was at Bangkok, and I
spent much of my time smoking with him in the hot evenings. And
one night I told him of the girl, and how she had walked into
that place at Hue where there were forty-seven first cousins of
the devil watching her. Scheibel sat quiet for a minute and then
turned to me.</p>

<p>"'What is the man's name?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'His name is Falkner,' I said. 'Henry Falkner.'</p>

<p>"He looked at me for a few minutes without speaking, and I
knew that I had found someone who could tell me if my suspicions
were true.</p>

<p>"'You know him?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'I <i>knew</i> him,' he said slowly.</p>

<p>"'Is he dead then?' I questioned.</p>

<p>"'He is worse than dead,' said Scheibel. 'You must write to
her, Hochdorf, and tell her to go home. Send her home, man!'</p>

<p>"'I don't know where she is,' I snapped. 'She was staying with
an American missionary at Hue, but she did not intend to stay
long there. Tell me what you know.'</p>

<p>"'I told you that he is worse than dead,' said Scheibel.
'Three years ago he was a clerk in my office, but I found out
things as the days rolled by. When I found that he had been opium
smoking I threw him out of my office. After that I would see him
now and again. He was no longer a man. He was a thing&mdash;a
thing that yellow men and brown men looked at with contempt. They
would pass him by on the street and laugh.</p>

<p>"'And he would do things to get money that they would not do.
He was the lowest of the low. Send her home, Hochdorf! Send her
home! There is no hope for him. If he is not dead he is so near
to it that it would not be nice for her to see him.'</p>

<p>"I looked at Scheibel and I thought of the girl as I had seen
her on that night.</p>

<p>"'She would not go back,' I said. 'She will not go back till
she finds him.'</p>

<p>"'But she must not find him now,' said Scheibel. 'She will not
be able to do anything for him. Hochdorf, he is as low as it is
possible for a man to get. I have never seen a thing like him
since I have come to this country. It is three months since I
have seen him, and I bet he is now a hundred feet lower in sin
and filth than he was the last time I put my eyes on him.'</p>

<p>"That story made my heart sick. I could not tell the girl. I
could only hope that she would get tired and would go back home
to a clean country where there is no fierce sunshine and no
curious odors that stir desires like there are in this land.</p>

<p>"The fear that she might come across the wreck of a man that
Scheibel had pictured became a horror to me. It kept me awake at
night. I am little better than a pagan, but I prayed that she
might never come face to face with the man she sought. I had not
prayed for years, but I prayed that she might be spared that
horror. It would be better for her to search for him for the
rest of her days than to find him the wreck that I knew him to
be.</p>

<p>"I went up the Meinam and I trapped there for four months. I
went back to Shanghai, and I sent a consignment of specimens to
Amsterdam, and then I came back again on a bull-nosed lugger up
the Gulf of Siam to Bangkok. It was sixteen months since I had
seen the girl, but I had not forgotten those eyes of blue that
had a spiritual look in them that I have never seen in the eyes
of a human being.</p>

<p>"Now, I will tell you something that makes me feel sure that
as many miracles take place today as in the days when they ran
short of wine at the marriage feast in Canaan. One day I was
walking along near the Golden Temple of Wat Sutat when I saw a
white man coming towards me. He was nothing but skin and bone. He
was shambling along by the temple wall, holding himself up by
clutching the rough stone when he stumbled. And the first glance
which I gave him made me feel certain that I had found the man
that the girl with the wonderful blue eyes was seeking. The thing
that was coming towards me with the eyes that had gone back into
the caverns of the skull, and the face drawn with all the lines
that vice could put upon it, was Falkner!</p>

<p>"He came up to me whining like a whipped cur.</p>

<p>"'Give me money,' he cried. 'For the love of God give me
money.'</p>

<p>"'Who are you?' I asked. 'What is your name?'</p>

<p>"He could not answer me. He could only mumble the word
'money,' and his mouth slobbered as I looked at him.</p>

<p>"I caught him by the shoulder and I shook him gently.</p>

<p>"'Your name is Falkner,' I said. 'Henry Falkner.'</p>

<p>"A look of fear came into his face when I said that. He tried
to wrench himself free from my grip, and when I would not let
him, he clawed at me with his thin fingers and spat curses at
me.</p>

<p>"He fought me till he was exhausted. The opium-pipe had
drained him of his strength, and he was like a baby in my grip.
His thin hands were so transparent that you could nearly see
through them, and he did not weigh more than a child of ten
years. When he was too exhausted to struggle with me, I took him
in my arms and carried him to the room that I rented over the
shop of a German who dealt in pearls and Burmese rubies.</p>

<p>"After three days, when I had brought him a little to his
senses, I told him about the girl who was going up and down the
land looking for him. I told him how she had visited places
because she thought he had been there, and I found when I told
him the story, that although he had lost everything that a man
prizes in gratifying his desire for the cursed opium, he had not
lost shame. When I told him she had searched for him, he became
mad with a fear lest she might find him.</p>

<p>"It was a terrible fear. He would not go into the street, even
when the desire for the drug was biting him with a million
tongues. He would not go near the window to look out on the
street. A step upon the stairs would send him like a whipped cur
under the table for fear it was the step of the girl who was
searching for him. It was terrible. He knew what he was, and what
he would look like to that girl if she put her eyes upon him, but
even then he did not have the power to fight against the craving.
He was one of those dream persons who lack the power to fight.
The drug was as necessary to him as the air he breathed, and
after two months of fighting I came to the conclusion that he
would never throw off the tentacles that gripped him. I was
certain that he could not.</p>

<p>"Falkner's fight against those cravings was a mighty big
fight. I would get him and hold him and tell him of that girl
till he would cry like a child, but I had no sooner finished
speaking, when up out of the back of his head would hop those
cravings that had to be appeased.</p>

<p>"I took him with me to Saigon, and there we continued that
fight, he and I. We fought that thing night and day, but it was
no use. The disease had a grip on him that I could not break. It
had a grip on him that was so powerful that it would make him
climb into the depths of hell to get to the drug he wanted. And I
saw that it was no use to struggle with him, with the intention
of bringing him near that girl. I am not a sentimental fool. I
knew that he was too deep in the mud to be the proper company for
a girl who was as pure as one of the angels who sit at the
footstool of God. And he knew it! He knew that he had been bad
clean through, and when I would tell him about the girl, he used
to squirm in agony.</p>

<p>"'I could never look at her, Hochdorf,' he would say. 'I could
never look at her after what I have been.'</p>

<p>"'Try,' I would say. 'You can never tell.' </p>

<p>"'But I can tell!' he would say again and again. 'I might pull
myself out of the mud, but it is not right that I should go
before her to try and recover the place I have lost by my own
actions.'</p>

<p>"Day after day as I talked with him I began to see that he was
right, I began to see that no matter what that woman's love was
for him, it would be wrong for him to marry her. Three years in
the stew of wickedness in which he had been had made him a man
who was not fit to marry her.</p>

<p>"'Try and fight for your own sake,' I would say to him.</p>

<p>"'I will, Hochdorf,' he said. 'I will, but do not mention her
to me again. It will only bring my sins up before my eyes!'</p>

<p>"So I did not speak of the girl again because I thought it
would not be right. I took his view of it Some people might think
it would be nice for me to put a clean suit of clothes on him,
and brush his hair and shave him, and lead him up before that
girl and say: 'Here is your sweetheart back again.' But I am not
that kind. I knew that I would be handing her a wreck that had
been poisoned by the devils of the Orient By those purple devils
that are in the breezes, and the hot nights, and the silence! He
was soaked through and through with the poison of that place, and
it would take a lifetime to free him of the desires and the
cravings that had come to him during the time that he had dallied
with the vice that had him in its clutch.</p>

<p>"I had to go down to Singapore, and he cried to come with me.
He was like a baby who dreaded to be left alone.</p>

<p>"'I want to be near you, Hochdorf,' he cried.</p>

<p>"'All right,' I said. 'Come along with me.'</p>

<p>"I paid his passage for her sake. I had seen that girl
searching for him in a place where a brave man would think three
times before walking into it. So I paid his fare to Singapore. I
put him in my cabin and I locked the door. Then I went up on deck
and watched the passengers come on board.</p>

<p>"Now, I am going to tell you the strangest part of this story.
Just at the last minute before that boat threw off her ropes, I
saw something that made my heart stop. I happened to look down
upon the gangway, and coming up it was the girl with the
wonderful blue eyes and the pure face whom I had spoken to at Hue
sixteen months before. It was she, and it was strange that when I
looked at her, she had the same peculiar look in her eyes that
she had when she walked into that den where the Malay tried to
put his dirty hands upon her.</p>

<p>"I was more afraid at that moment than I had ever been. I was
telling myself that the Almighty had made me a buffer between
that girl and the wreck that was in my cabin, and as I watched
her coming up the gangway, I felt that all my plans would be
overthrown.</p>

<p>"A steward at the bottom of the gangway put out his hand as if
he would stop her, but he dropped it quick and stared at her as
if he had seen a ghost. And one or two others who were in her way
got out of her path and looked at her as she went by.</p>

<p>"I had a creepy feeling when I looked at her at close
quarters. I. was thinking of the thing in the cabin that I had
locked in there before I came on deck. <i>'Himmel!'</i> I said to
myself, 'she feels that he is near, and she will go to him!' And
I was determined to shake her out of her trance lest she might
find him.</p>

<p>"I walked over to her and I spoke, and she came to herself
with a start. A flush swept over her white face like the flush
upon the snow of the Himalayas when the sun peeps up out of the
China Sea.</p>

<p>"'It is Mr. Hochdorf,' she said quietly. 'I had a strange
feeling just now. I was drawn aboard this boat
because&mdash;'</p>

<p>"I knew without being told that the girl had come aboard that
boat without baggage or anything else solely because she had a
feeling that the man she loved was on board. I asked her all
sorts of questions, foolish questions, and she tried to answer me
as the <i>Ka Lang</i> turned her nose southward.</p>

<p>"She said that she had been hunting up and down the coast
since the day that I had left her at Hue. She had collected a
thousand little bits of information, but she had not weakened one
little bit. I could tell that by the way she told me of the
places into which she had gone searching for him, places that
would have brought ten million suspicions to the mind of a girl
who did not love as she loved.</p>

<p>"'And I&mdash;I do not know why I came aboard,' she murmured.
'I was drawn aboard. Oh, Mr. Hochdorf, I felt that he was close!
Could it be possible? Could it be possible that he is on
board?'</p>

<p>"She looked at me with those wonderful blue eyes of hers till
I thought that the lie which I stammered out was printed big
across my face.</p>

<p>"'I have just looked over the passenger list,' I stammered,
'and there are only five white people aboard. You and I and three
missionaries.'</p>

<p>"The tears trickled down her cheeks as she sat looking at me
as the old tub ploughed through the waters that were smeared with
gold from the afternoon sun.</p>

<p>"'I shall go on searching till I find him,' she said simply.
'I shall surely find him, if it is only for the space of ten
minutes before he dies. I am sure of it.'</p>

<p>"I went back to the cabin and I told Falkner that she was
aboard the <i>Ka Lang</i>, and he became a crazy man. He tried to
climb under the berth for fear that she might pass by the cabin
and see him. He wanted me to get hold of the passenger list and
scratch his name off, and he made a dash at the door with the
intention of springing overboard when I refused to do what he
wanted me to do. He was not like the proud sinner who gets out on
the street corners and tells of all the wickedness that he has
done as if it was something to brag about. I had to lock that
cabin door and fight with him to stop the fool from jumping into
the waters of the China Sea.</p>

<p>"I calmed him at last, and made him see that it was impossible
for her to discover that he was on board. I told him that she
would never know. But although he lay quiet, he had his eyes
fixed on the door as if he was afraid that she might enter at any
minute. He would not sleep. He just lay on the bunk and watched
the door. And I watched it, too, because I had a feeling that
something might happen that would upset my plans.</p>

<p>"And something did happen. I think it must have been about two
o'clock in the morning when I heard a cry of fire. I sprang from
the berth and a chill crept over me as I thought of that old
sun-bitten steamer with her dry planks, and how she would burn
when once the fire got a grip of her.</p>

<p>"And it had a grip on her when I rushed through the saloon.
Clouds of smoke were coming down the companionway, and when I
fought my way on deck, I saw in one glance that the old <i>Ka
Lang</i> was doomed. Little red snakes of fire were racing along
the planks and biting at the rail, and there was a roaring hell
gnawing at the stomach of that old craft. The purr of the fire
went out into the silence of the night, and I was sick as I
looked at the devilish little whips of flame that licked at the
planks of the old tub.</p>

<p>"I thought of that girl first. I forgot Falkner. I only
thought of saving her. And I was mad with myself, although I did
not know why I should be mad. I thought that it was my fault that
she was aboard, but of course my thought was wrong.</p>

<p>"I knew where the girl was sleeping, and I ran along the
passage towards her cabin. But the fire that was eating up the
timbers of the <i>Ka Lang</i>, beat me back. The smoke throttled
me with a million fingers. I fell on my knees and tried to crawl
forward but I could not.</p>

<p>"I was rushing towards the companionway with fear biting at my
heart when I stumbled against Falkner. He caught me by the
shoulders and thrust his face close to mine. He had the face of a
devil at that moment. I have never seen anything like it. And he
had grown stronger in a way that surprised me.</p>

<p>"'Where is she?' he roared. 'Quick, you fool! Tell me where
she is!'</p>

<p>"I pointed to the passage out of which I had come in a hurry,
and from which the smoke was rolling as if the passage was the
funnel of a Bibby liner.</p>

<p>"'What is the number of her cabin?' he shrieked.</p>

<p>"'Twenty-seven,' I roared. 'But you cannot get to it!'</p>

<p>"The flames were singing their song with a throaty bass just
then. The red snakes of fire seemed to know that it was
impossible for anyone to save that old tub, and they sang a song
of triumph as they ate her up. And those great masses of smoke
rolled over the boat and clutched at our throats with the fingers
of death. But Falkner did not care. He was a madman just then. He
sprang into the smoke that rolled out of the passage, and I lost
sight of him. He dived into the black clouds, and I stumbled up
the companionway on to the deck.</p>

<p>"All hell had been unloosed on that deck. The <i>Ka Lang</i>
had a crew that had been raked together in places where a decent
sailorman will take precious good care that he is not stranded.
They were black, and brown, and yellow, and they were children of
the devil, every one of them.</p>

<p>"The English skipper had made an attempt to stop those
niggers, but he had failed. He was knocked down and trampled on,
and when I stumbled on deck they were trying to launch the second
boat of the <i>Ka Lang.</i> They had swamped the first in trying
to get it into the water, and it looked as if they would swamp
the second by the way they were going on. They were clawing, and
shouting and screaming like lunatics.</p>

<p>"I turned to run back to my cabin for my revolver, but as I
turned I ran into Falkner. He plunged up the stairs, carrying in
his arms something&mdash;something that I knew to be the girl I
had failed to rescue! He had her in his arms, and I knew that she
was unconscious.</p>

<p>"Falkner seemed to understand everything with the one glance
he took at those devils who were struggling to launch the boat He
thrust the girl into my arms, and made a dash at them. There must
have been thirty of those mad fiends, but he dashed at them
without thinking of numbers.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen a fight where the fighting devil that was
in one man went out and put the fear of God in the hearts of a
score? That is what I saw then. That opium smoker who had sunk
into the depths of hell was a madman who could beat five hundred.
He picked up an oar and he swung it round his head with a
strength that I would never have thought was in him.</p>

<p>"The flames that were eating up the <i>Ka Lang</i> made the
deck as light as day, and as I stood there looking with
astonishment at Falkner dealing with those brutes, the girl came
to her senses. And she saw! She saw the man for whom she had been
searching through weary months, watched him with those wonderful
eyes of hers that were brimming over with admiration and
love.</p>

<p>"I have seen men fight, men with big muscles and big bodies,
but I have never seen a fighter like Falkner. There was something
supernatural about him that made those niggers shrink back from
him, and I looked at him in wonder as he swung that oar and kept
them at bay.</p>

<p>"The English captain and the half-caste mate got to their
feet, and after one look at Falkner, they started in a hurry to
get the boat into the water. I stood with the girl in my arms,
but Falkner woke me up then. He screamed at me to put the girl
into the boat, and when I did not move quick enough, he screamed
at me again.</p>

<p>"'The boat!' he cried. 'Get into the boat, you fool!'</p>

<p>"And I obeyed, still holding the girl in my arms with her eyes
watching him.</p>

<p>"I do not know how I got into that boat, but I know that I
did. The girl cried out to Falkner as I fell into the boat with
her in my arms; and he looked down at her then. He looked down at
her for a single second, and I saw his face in that second. It
was not the Falkner that I had talked with in my cabin the
evening before. It was a new Falkner. His face was transfigured
in a way that made me wonder about it for many a long day
afterwards. I did not see the lines of vice upon it at that
moment. It seemed good to look upon, and in those few seconds
that they looked at each other I felt that I witnessed a miracle,
yes, a miracle because of her great love.</p>

<p>"A cloud of black smoke rolled over Falkner and blotted him
from our view. That girl screamed again and again, and cried out
to the captain to save Falkner, but the captain knew that the
thing was impossible. He knew and I knew that the black smoke
which had swept over Falkner would make those brown devils blind
to the power which had held them off from him. As we pulled from
the <i>Ka Lang</i>, I caught a glimpse through a rift in the
smoke of that horde sweeping across the deck where he had held
them at bay.</p>

<p>"We had little time to puzzle over what had happened to
Falkner. We had not pulled fifty yards from the <i>Ka Lang</i>
when the old boat gave a sudden tilt forward, and plunged. And
that was the last of her. She went down with a single plunge, and
the darkness that had been thrust back by those snaky flames came
down upon us so thick and heavy that we felt we were being
choked.</p>

<p>"The whole business had happened so quickly that I wondered if
I was dreaming. I shook myself, and then as I sat in the stern of
the boat, listening to the sobbing of the girl, I blessed the
<i>lieber Gott</i> for the way He had planned things. For two
minutes He had transformed that wreck of a man into a demi-god,
and the girl had in her mind a picture that was a good picture
for her to keep&mdash;a picture of her lover fighting like a
Viking against odds of thirty to one.</p>

<p>"That is about all of my story. We were picked up at daybreak
by a French steamer and carried down to Singapore. I wish you
could have heard the girl describe to the mate of the steamer the
way that Falkner had met his death. It made that mate cry, and he
was not a tender-hearted person either.</p>

<p>"I took her to the home of a missionary at Singapore and I
left her there. She had made up her mind to take a boat up to
Yokohama, where she would ship home. She said good-by to me
without asking me any questions as to whether Falkner had
accompanied me aboard the <i>Ka Lang.</i> And I was glad of it. I
should have had to tell lies, and I was afraid her blue eyes
would see the word 'liar' on my face. I am not a good liar.</p>

<p>"Sometimes now as I sit and look at that Dyak girl who puts
her head down to the waves so that she can hear the messages
which she thinks her dead lover is sending to her, I think that
the Almighty has tried to ease her grief as he tried to ease the
sorrow of the girl whom I met in that little hell at Hue, the
girl with the eyes of blue."</p>

<p class="first">MONSIEUR DE TROLLE looked out of a little window
in the Hospital of The White Nuns. He looked out upon the
sun-bitten desert. The hospital was built on the very fringe of
the gray sand wastes that stretched away to El-Shafa.</p>

<p>Monsieur De Trolle was puzzled. He had hurried to the hospital
in response to an urgent message sent to him by the good nuns. A
dying man wished to see him, a dying man who would not give his
name.</p>

<p>A soft-footed sister came hurrying along the corridor and
bowed to De Trolle. De Trolle was the French consul, and the nuns
treated him with the greatest respect.</p>

<p>"I will take you to him now," murmured the sister. "It is
dangerous for him to talk, but he says that he must speak to
you."</p>

<p>"Is he very ill?" asked De Trolle.</p>

<p><i>"Oui,"</i> she said sadly, "he is very ill. Dr. Huignon
has done everything but&mdash;" She shrugged her shoulders and
turned to lead the way.</p>

<p>The consul followed. The corridor was wonderfully cool.
The thick stone walls kept out the hot blasts that
swept across the great gray wastes. A score of palms that stood
like sentinels on the eastern side of the building waved their
fronds as if trying to ward off the sand-laden winds. The djinns
of the desert warred against the long stone building.</p>

<p>There was an atmosphere of repose within the hospital, an
atmosphere which made the consul think that death might come easy
to one within those walls. Clean odors came to the nostrils of De
Trolle as he followed the nun, clean aseptic odors that fought
with the century-old smells that drifted in through the windows.
Here on the very fringe of the wastes the good sisters struggled
to save the lives of those who fell in the battle with the
desert.</p>

<p>The nun opened the door of a room at the extreme end of the
cool corridor, and motioned Monsieur De Trolle to enter. Another
white-robed sister, the double of her who had acted as guide,
stood beside a little iron bed in the center of the room, and she
bowed low to the consul. Monsieur De Trolle bowed in return, then
he fixed his small black eyes upon the man on the bed.</p>

<p>Monsieur De Trolle moved toward the bed and addressed the
occupant.</p>

<p>"You wish to speak to me?" he said gently.</p>

<p>The sick man looked at the round good-natured face of the
consul. "I do," he said quietly. "I have a story to tell you. It
is a long story, so you had better sit down."</p>

<p>The nun who had been standing beside the little bed slipped
out of the room, leaving the consul alone with the stranger who
had begged for a visit. De Trolle, sitting beside the bed,
studied the face of the sick man. It was a remarkable face. The
man on the bed was in the prime of life, and De Trolle, observing
him quietly, felt convinced that he had never seen a face which
expressed such force. The nose was a fighting, imperious nose.
The eyes were black and flashing, fearless eyes with a cruel
hawklike gleam in their depths. The mouth, although drawn with
pain, was still possessed of a firmness that amazed De Trolle.
The lips made a straight gray line, and the iron jaws were
clamped as the sick man returned the quiet stare of the
consul.</p>

<p>De Trolle was fascinated by the face. The whole countenance
exhibited a strength which seemed to resent the approach of
death. The mouth, the nose and eyes might have been those of an
emperor, and the very nearness of the Reaper could not rob the
features of their superb insolence.</p>

<p>De Trolle was interrupted in his study by a question which the
sick man put to him, a question which made the consul thrust his
face down close to that of the stranger. He had put a query in a
soft voice.</p>

<p>"You don't remember me, Jean?" he asked.</p>

<p>De Trolle opened his mouth, shut it again, thrust his head a
little closer to the sick man, and then, as if he found within
the flashing black eyes a light which lit up the dim records of
the past, he said quietly:</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;it is Pierre Lepre!"</p>

<p>The gray line of the mouth relaxed in a half smile.</p>

<p>"It is Pierre Lepre," repeated the man upon the bed. "It is a
long while since we met. Yesterday&mdash;yesterday the nun
mentioned that you were consul here, and so I sent for you."</p>

<p>De Trolle's hand reached out and touched the brown muscular
fingers of the man upon the bed. And the consul winced as those
iron fingers closed upon his white and somewhat flabby hand. The
fingers were possessed of a remarkable strength, and the consul
could hardly choke a cry of pain as they closed around his
own.</p>

<p>Pierre Lepre spoke after a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"You have heard of me since our school days at Dijon?" he
questioned.</p>

<p>The consul nodded his head slowly. "I have heard a little of
you," he said. "Now and then there have come to my ears
interesting little stories about you."</p>

<p>Again the gray lines of the mouth relaxed in a smile. It was a
smile that told De Trolle that Pierre Lepre was fully aware of
the kind of stories which the consul had heard. And Monsieur De
Trolle made no effort to alter the impression which the sick man
had drawn from his answer. The stories which he had heard of
Pierre Lepre were stories that men told in whispers in quiet
places. From Tangier to Damietta the doings of Pierre Lepre, or
Pierre the Devil as he was better known, were whispered of in
little wine-shops and Arab cafs. Now as the consul's fingers
recovered from the terrific grip, De Trolle wondered what mishap
had brought the fighting daredevil to the door of death.</p>

<p>The consul waited for Lepre to speak. The flashing, fearless
eyes of the sick man were upon De Trolle's face, studying it as
if doubtful whether the consul was really the person to hear the
story which he desired to unburden himself of before death came
to him. After a long pause he decided in De Trolle's favor. His
hands gripped the bars at the head of the bed and he drew himself
up till he rested upon his elbow.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell you something, De Trolle," he said.
"Something which I must tell before I die. Do you know that I am
going to die?"</p>

<p>The consul swallowed hurriedly. "<i>Non</i>, I do not," he
answered.</p>

<p>"Well, you know now," said Pierre the Devil. "I am going to
die before the night is out, and I want to tell you something
before I go."</p>

<p>Once again there came a hush upon the little room. A soothing
silence was upon the place. De Trolle wondered if he had ever
felt such an intense peace.</p>

<p>"You have heard little stories of me, you say," said Lepre,
breaking the silence, "and I know they were stories that were not
to my credit. But they were true&mdash;too true. I am doing no
death-bed repentance, and I am going to face the end without any
regrets. I have not been a saint and  have not brought you here
to contradict anything that you have ever heard of me. I have
asked you to come so that I might tell you of one happening which
you must listen to because I cannot die without telling it. It is
the story of a miracle, De Trolle. A miracle, do you hear?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>, I hear," said the consul.</p>

<p>"I must tell you the story from the beginning," said Lepre,
"right from the beginning. I have got to tell you everything. I
have got to tell you of the girl, and of Galische, and of the old
devil of a holy man who made my life a hell. I must tell you all
and you must listen because I am going to die, De Trolle, and I
cannot die with this on my mind. Last night I tried to die but I
could not, and this morning I sent for you.</p>

<p>"This began at Sidi-Bel-Abbs, the headquarters of <i>La
Lgion trangre</i>. It began with a girl, De Trolle, a girl
verging into womanhood. You have got to listen to what I tell you
about that girl. I have got to tell you of her so that you will
understand. She had eyes that would light a man's soul down to
hell, eyes that at one moment flashed like the eyes of Antiope
and at another moment had all the softness within them that we
used to see in the eyes of the big picture of St. Agnes of
Beaupriere in the church at Dijon. I have never seen such
eyes.</p>

<p>"The Kabyles tell of the Green Snake of Ain-Sefra that the
dancing women pray to for the suppleness which is their charm.
That girl had it. By the Bones of the Little Corsican, she had
it! She was beautiful, De Trolle! She had hair that the devil
could have plaited into a ladder to lower men's souls into the
deepest depths. She had moist little lips the like of which I
have never seen, and she had arms&mdash;lithe rounded arms, De
Trolle, that, locked around a man's neck, would drag him to hell
and further. Are you sick of this talk, <i>mon ami</i>?"</p>

<p>De Trolle shook his head. "I will listen," he said quietly. "I
will listen to anything you have got to tell me."</p>

<p>"You must listen," said the sick man. "You must listen to this
part of my story because it explains the end. If I could have
died without telling it, I would have held my tongue, but I
cannot die, I cannot.</p>

<p>"A holy man&mdash;a Moslem&mdash;brought that girl to
Sidi-Bel-Abbs, a holy man with a heart like a Gaboon viper. He
brought her to Sidi-Bel-Abbes to sell her, to sell her for a
monthly sum that would keep him in luxury.</p>

<p>"He found a purchaser. You think I am bad, De Trolle, but let
me tell you that <i>le bon Dieu</i> would not pause a moment in
deciding between me and Lieutenant Galische. If ever the devil is
overthrown, it will be Galische who will head the insurrection.
Perhaps he has overthrown him now. <i>Oui</i>, he is in hell in
front of me, De Trolle.</p>

<p>"Galische bought her. His father was a banker on the Rue de
Ferriol at Marseilles, and he had gold to throw away. He had
killed a man on the Vieux Porte and he could not go back to
prance up and down the Cannebire.</p>

<p>"He bought her for that old wrinkled devil who, while living
on the money the girl earned, prayed for ten hours a day in the
courtyard of the Mosque of the Green Tiles. Galische bought her
and took her to the little house where he lived beneath the
cluster of silver beech trees on the white road from the
barracks.</p>

<p>"De Trolle, I wanted that girl. I had an unconquerable longing
to get possession of her. I thought that I had been waiting for
years and years to meet her, and I went mad when I found that
Galische had bought her.</p>

<p>"Every night I would walk out on the sand-stretches beyond the
white barracks and I would fling myself down on the sand and
stare at the little house where she lived with Galische. I
thought that my very desire for her would bring her to me. You
know what the Arabs say? They say that the little grains of sand
talk to each other and that they carry a story for miles and
miles. And I, Pierre the Devil, whispered of my love to the hot
sand. I babbled nonsense to it, De Trolle. I told the sand of the
mystery of her eyes, of the sheen upon her hair, of her red lips
that were redder than the poinsettias in the colonel's garden, of
the little teeth that were smaller and whiter than any teeth that
I had ever seen. I babbled of her arms, of her little
henna-stained fingers, of her shapely feet.</p>

<p>"You wonder how long I acted like this, De Trolle? For three
months! Every night for three months I went out there on the sand
and stared at the little house and whispered of my love to the
hot sand&mdash; for three months during which I never spoke a
word to her. Galische was too cunning to allow anyone to speak to
her.</p>

<p>"That old devil of a wrinkled holy man knew that I was there
night after night. It was there that he first made me wonder at
his power. He found me there one evening when a big white-faced
moon hung above the barracks, and when he spoke to me I cursed
him.</p>

<p>"'Would you like to see your end?' he asked. 'Would you like
to see what Allah has planned for you?'</p>

<p>"'Begone, you pig!' I cried, and my eyes were fixed upon the
house as I spoke. Each night I craved her more than ever. The
desire in my heart grew with each hour that she was in the
possession of Galische.</p>

<p>"That toothless devil of an Arab took up a handful of dry sand
and lifted his arm.</p>

<p>"'Look!' he cried. 'Look and you will see a picture of the end
that Allah plans for you, as the sand drifts between us and the
moon!'</p>

<p>"He tossed the sand into the air, De Trolle, and there,
between me and the big moon, I saw a fleeting picture of a
scaffold with a dead man swinging on a rope. <i>Sapristi!</i>
that is what I saw! It was like a shadow picture, and it was gone
in a second.</p>

<p>"'It is your end,' he said. 'It is what Allah has
planned.'</p>

<p>"I flung a knife at him but he dodged away and hobbled swiftly
toward the town.</p>

<p>"I did not miss a night, not one. The moment the darkness came
down upon the desert I would sneak out there and fling myself
down on the sand. As far as I knew, that girl did not know of my
existence, and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pierre the Devil gripped the iron bars and drew himself up
till his face was on a level with the face of the absorbed
consul. His voice became a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"And yet on one moonlit night she came out to me across the
sand stretch," he gasped. "Lying there on the sand I watched her
coming. That little house where Galische lived was a quarter of a
mile from the spot where I lay each night, but on that evening
the desert sands were whitened by a big moon so that I saw her
from the moment she left the door. I lay and watched her as she
came toward me. I lay and watched her, and my hands clawed the
sand as she walked straight toward the spot as if she knew that I
was there. As if she knew, De Trolle! Listen, Monsieur Consul!
It is desire that brings everything to us. Do you hear? If our
longing is great enough, we can bring the world to us. If our
longing is big enough, we can bring heaven to our very door. Aye,
and hell with it!</p>

<p>"She came across the sand straight toward the spot where I was
lying, and when she was within a dozen yards of me she halted.
Then I stood up and walked toward her. She stood as straight as a
Normandy poplar and in the moonlight she looked like something
that was not of this world.</p>

<p>"'Why do you wait and watch?' she asked.</p>

<p>"'Because I love,' I answered.</p>

<p>"'You are a patient lover,' she murmured.</p>

<p>"'Patient because I knew that you would come,' I answered.</p>

<p>"I was close to her then. I was close enough to see the wonder
in her eyes, the eyes that were made to fire men's souls. I saw
the great mass of black hair that fell over her bosom, the hair
in which I wanted to bury my face, and I forgot Galische. I
forgot everyone. I was Pierre the Devil, and I reached out and
took her in my arms.</p>

<p>"It was a low cough that woke me out of the trance that was
upon me. That girl pushed me from her and looked over my
shoulder. And I turned. Standing not more than six feet away from
us was Galische, Lieutenant Henri Galische, who was ten times a
bigger devil than I am, De Trolle.</p>

<p>"He could have killed me while my back was turned to him, but
he would not. Galische was afraid of no man that ever walked. He
was not a coward. Did you ever hear of the affair at Tizi-Ouzou?
That was the work of Galische. And the red job in the <i>souk</i>
at Figuig? Galische again. He was a limb of Satan.</p>

<p>"'So,' he said, glaring at me, 'it is the little Pierre who is
playing tricks on me. I am sorry. I will have to cut the little
Pierre into pieces for the kites to eat!'</p>

<p>"He drew his knife and I drew mine. That girl stepped back to
give us room. I hate knives. I hate to kill a man with a knife. A
sword, <i>oui!</i> A gun, <i>oui!</i> But a
knife&mdash;<i>sacre!</i> a knife is a dog's weapon! But we had
only knives and there could be no delay. <i>Non</i>, we had to
fight. Nothing could stop us then. And as we circled round each
other that girl crouched on the sand and watched us. I am
wondering, De Trolle, how many thousand women since the world
began have crouched as she crouched and watched men fight.</p>

<p>"That was a fight! <i>Mon Dieu!</i> yes. Galische was a devil,
but to my right arm there came a strength that startled me. Every
minute that I had spent on the hot sand staring at that house had
added strength to my arm. I fought with the whips of desire
urging me on. Upon my lips were the kisses which she had given
me, and I laughed like a wolf as I circled round Galische. He was
going to cut me into little pieces and feed me to the kites. Me!
De Trolle, I could have fought a regiment then. I could have
fought a score of the greatest devils that <i>La Legion</i> ever
enlisted. She knew it. That is why she sat like an image and
watched me, watched me with her flashing eyes as I closed in on
Galische whose temper made him move clumsily over the sand.</p>

<p>"We left Lieutenant Henri Galische there on the white sand,
his blood making a stain that looked like a shadow patch when I
glanced back after we were two hundred yards away. And it was
then that I remembered what that old devil of a holy man had done
with the handful of sand, and I shuddered. I thought of that
gallows, but the girl kissed me&mdash;kissed me on the lips, and
I forgot Galische as we turned southward.</p>

<p>"We fled to Saida. From there we went to Moufa. We had to keep
moving, De Trolle. The arm of France is long. <i>Oui</i>, it is
long. They wanted me. They wanted me for the murder of Galische.
The sand that had told the girl of my love told them that I had
committed the crime. And one must move swiftly to escape the
clutch of the legionaries.</p>

<p>"We moved on and on. And then during those first days of
flight I knew that that old dog of a holy man was helping the
bloodhounds. He had been robbed of his monthly income which
Galische paid him, and he sent out the desert marconigrams that
brought the arm of France reaching after us across the
desert.</p>

<p>"It was the old wrinkled holy man who brought the legionaries
on me at Naama. They caught me one night as we slept in the house
of a coppersmith in the <i>souk.</i> The holy man was there to
see the capture. They dragged me out at dawn and they started
with me back to Sidi-Bel-Abbes. The arm of France is far-reaching
and like the tentacle of an octopus. When it twists itself around
its victim, it brings him with all speed to the spot where he
must suffer.</p>

<p>"That girl ran after me as we rode into the desert, out of
which the hot sun leapt as if anxious to light the path that led
me back to the gallows. And as they flogged my camel and jeered
at me because they had caught me while I slept, I twisted my head
and stared at her as she followed. She was running, De Trolle,
running after me across the hot sand and behind her hobbled the
holy man. <i>Dieu!</i> I went mad as I looked! My muscles swelled
until the cords cut through my skin and the blood ran down my
arms and chest. As I looked, I saw her fall and I saw him hobble
faster to catch up with her. When his claws were reaching out to
her, something happened to my eyes and I could see nothing but a
red mist&mdash;a red mist of murder!</p>

<p>"That night I strangled the man who had jeered at me most
during the day. Lying in the darkness I strained and strained
till I burst the thongs of green hide that bound me, and I had my
fingers on his windpipe before he knew what had made the little
clicking sound when the bonds snapped.</p>

<p>"I killed him like I would kill a rat. I crept out of the
camp, stole the fastest camel and rode back to Naama. I went up
and down the <i>souk</i> hunting for information. They told me
where that old man had taken her, and I crept into the house with
a knife in my hand. He escaped me, De Trolle. My blade slashed
his dirty robe as he dashed down an alley at the back of the
<i>souk.</i> And she helped to save his life. Her arms were round
my neck and her lips were clinging to mine as I tried to chase
the old hound who wanted to send me to that gallows that he had
pictured with the handful of sand which he tossed into the air.
He ran faster that night than he ever ran in his life.</p>

<p>"Those bloodhounds of France unnerved me. I took her that
night and we went northward across the desert. We rode up across
the great sandy stretches to Chellala, and from there to Boghar.
Ours was a great love, De Trolle. I wanted her and she wanted me.
Galische was a thing which Destiny had put between us and I had
put him out of the way. Yet France could not see it in that
light. They wanted to tear me away from that woman that I loved
with all my body and soul.</p>

<p>"I came up to Dellys and from there we took ship back to
Algiers. We lived there in the Arab <i>Kasbah</i>, hiding like
rats in a hole, and then we came on to Tripoli and from there to
Alexandria.</p>

<p>"I cursed my reputation as we fled. Her beauty I could cover,
but I could not hide my own face. A veil hid her red lips and
pearly teeth and the strange beauty of her blazing eyes, but I
was Pierre Lepre, Pierre the Devil, out of whose way men dodged.
A bumboat man at Tripoli knew me and he tried to sell my head at
a price. Look! He gave me this little memento in exchange for
what I gave him."</p>

<p>The sick man pulled up the linen sleeve that covered his
muscular arm. Across the magnificent biceps was a terrible scar
some eighteen inches in length, and De Trolle shuddered as he
looked at it. Pierre the Devil was well-named!</p>

<p>"I went mad with fear. I was not afraid to die. I had never
been afraid of death, but I did not want them to drag me from her
whom I loved. And always before me was the shadow picture which
that old dog of a marabout pictured for me when he flung the
handful of sand into the air as I lay on the white waste watching
the house beneath the silver beech trees at Sidi-Bel-Abbes.</p>

<p>"Do you know that I became afraid of the shadow picture, De
Trolle? It haunted me. <i>Oui!</i> It came to me in my sleep. I
saw myself dancing on air for the murder of Galische! I began to
be afraid of every man who looked at me. I, Pierre Lepre, who had
faced Galische with a laugh when he came at me; Galische whose
hands were red with blood that ran at Tizi-Ouzou and at Figuig!"</p>

<p>Pierre Lepre paused to examine the face of the consul. De
Trolle was watching the light in the eyes of the
<i>ex-lgionnaire</i>. Although not an imaginative man, he
understood what Lepre had suffered during that pursuit.</p>

<p>"Now I must tell you of something else," continued the sick
man. "I had a strange feeling as we fled from place to place, De
Trolle. I fancied that I could tell in what direction that old
wrinkled holy man who sold that girl to Galische was coming. Do
you understand?</p>

<p>"I felt that he was always upon my heels and that I had been
given some peculiar power which told me the direction that he was
coming from. It was strange. It was very strange. Sometimes in
the morning, sometimes in the hot noons, and again in the velvety
nights I would feel a cold breath which came to me from some
point of the compass and I would fly in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>"Afterwards I proved that this was no fancy, De Trolle. Days,
weeks after I had that first belief regarding the direction he
was coming in, I proved to my own satisfaction that it was not a
foolish fancy on my part. I took notice of these peculiar
warnings that came to me. I would run like a jackal whenever I
felt that cold breath which told me he was coming. I knew that
those premonitions were right. No matter where we were, no matter
how secure I thought we were, I would take the girl by the arm
and run. Sometimes I would spring up in the night, feeling
certain that he was close to me, certain that his clawlike
fingers were reaching out to hand me over to the jeering
legionaries that I knew were still after us. The arm of France is
long, De Trolle. I have been part of that arm when it went out
after others, and I knew. This Africa is big, but it is not big
enough to hide a soldier who has put a knife into the heart of a
lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Fear drove us out into the desert. We went out over the great
sand-stretches far to the west. Out there, De Trolle, where the
red sun is diving into the sand like a newly minted
<i>louis</i>."</p>

<p>Lepre nodded toward the little window of his bedroom. The sun
was flaming down the western sky, bathing the dunes in a flood of
crimson.</p>

<p>"We fled out into the wastes to a little oasis miles away from
Shual, and there she died. She died. What of? you ask. She died
in childbirth, De Trolle. The Arab woman came too late,
and&mdash;and she died. Mother of Mary!&mdash;she died. She
gave a little sigh, looked at me with her wonderful eyes, kissed
me on the lips once and died. It was hard, De Trolle. If I had
been close to some place where I could have got a doctor I could
have saved her, but I was miles away from a doctor. I had been
driven out into the desert by that old fiend and the arm of
France.</p>

<p>"Now I am going to tell you of the miracle. As I stood there
at the door of the tent looking toward the east, there came to me
that cold feeling of danger which I always felt when the old
wrinkled holy man was close to me. It came to me then as I stood
there with her lying dead upon the little bed. It came to me out
of the east and I laughed as I felt it. I walked back to her,
kissed her dead lips and started out in the direction from which
I felt sure he was coming. I was not afraid of him then. She was
dead. She would not have to run after me across the desert when
the legionaries started to drag me back to Sidi-Bel-Abbes. I was
Pierre Lepre again, the Pierre Lepre that had faced Galische. I
knew no fear on that night.</p>

<p>"A jackal howled out on the desert, and I howled back at him.
I was an animal. I was a wolf, a wolf thirsting for blood. I
howled as I ran, and I chanted the mad blood song that the hill
tribes, of the Sagheru mountains chant as they charge down the
slopes. Have you ever felt like that, De Trolle? You have not! My
fingers ached to grip the throat of an enemy, and I ran across
the sands feeling certain that coming toward me was a person I
hated more than the devil himself."</p>

<p>Pierre Lepre paused for a few moments and gazed at his brown
muscular fingers that crooked themselves as if to show the consul
how they looked on that night of which Lepre spoke. The shadows
of late afternoon invaded the Hospital of The White Nuns. The
night started to spin its cobwebs of gloom in the corners of the
little room.</p>

<p>"Are you tired?" asked Lepre. "Are you tired of my story?"</p>

<p><i>"Non, non!"</i> cried the consul. "I am wondering what
happened."</p>

<p>The door of the bedroom opened softly as the consul answered
the question put by Lepre, and the white face of the nursing
sister looked into the room. Pierre Lepre's sharp eyes noticed
her before she could draw back.</p>

<p>"You may come in, sister," he said quietly. "You can hear the
rest of the story that I am telling to our good friend, the
consul. I&mdash;I told him much that I would not like you to
hear, but this which I am going to tell is the story of a miracle
and it will not offend. It will explain why I was found in the
desert five days' march from here and brought to this little
hospital of peace to die."</p>

<p>The soft-footed sister entered the room and closed the door.
She put pillows at the back of Pierre Lepre to rest his
shoulders and she stood behind him as he continued his story.</p>

<p>"It was a moonlight night. A big scared-looking moon had come
up in a hurry out of the sands, a moon that looked as if afraid
of what it might see. I ran on and on toward the east, ran like a
bloodhound that scents its quarry. And as I ran I knew that the
quarry was close. My fingers felt that they were already upon the
wrinkled throat of the old man.</p>

<p>"Up out of the sand-stretches he came at last. I saw him with
his hands outstretched as I saw him that morning when his
grasping fingers reached out after the girl who tried to follow
me when I was taken a prisoner from Naama. He was stumbling
across the sands toward me, and I howled with delight as I caught
sight of him. I had a desire to kill him, to break every little
bone in his body, to tear him in pieces. The blood pounded in my
head till the thumping of my arteries reminded me of the
<i>thud-thud</i> of the condensing engine near the parade-ground
at Sidi-Bel-Abbs.</p>

<p>"He turned when he saw me, turned and tried-to run.
<i>Dieu!</i> I was on him in three leaps. I sprang upon his
shoulders like a wolf and hurled him to the ground. I had him at
last. But I had to drag my fingers away from his wrinkled throat.
I did not want to kill him in a hurry. <i>Non</i>, I wanted to
make him suffer for a little while the damnable torment that I
had suffered as I fled before him. She was dead, and all the
bottled hate of weeks flooded my brain and made me mad.</p>

<p>"I think he fainted with fear when my fingers were at his
throat. I know he could not speak when I dragged him into a
sitting position and started to tell him what he had done. I
started to tell that old fiend the torment he had brought to that
girl and myself in his efforts to get her back to earn for him a
few paltry francs which someone else like Galische would have
willingly handed over. I screamed to him as he mumbled prayers in
his beard. He knew that I was going to kill him. Ay, he knew! His
old snake-like eyes, that glittered like the eyes of a horned
viper, saw Death stalking toward him across the desert. He
pleaded with me. He prayed to me. His teeth chattered as I held
him with one hand and pinched his throat with my fingers, pinched
him daintily with my fingers.</p>

<p>"'Now,' I cried, 'now where is the gallows?'</p>

<p>"'I was wrong,' he muttered. 'I was wrong. You will not die by
the gallows.'</p>

<p>"'And how will I die?' I cried.</p>

<p>"'Allah knows,' he muttered. 'Allah alone knows. Blessed be
Allah!'</p>

<p>"I held him there wondering which would be the best method to
kill him by. I wanted to get every thrill I could from his death.
I did. It was joy to me to hear him mumbling prayers and pleading
to me as my fingers burrowed into his flesh. And it was while I
pondered over the manner in which I should kill him that I asked
him a question. <i>Sacre!</i> What a fool I was! I cursed myself
for asking him that question. A million times have I cursed
myself. Ay, with my fingers on his throat I questioned him about
that trick with the handful of sand which he had played on me at
Sidi-Bel-Abbes.</p>

<p>"'How is it done?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'The sand knows everything,' he mumbled. 'Upon the sand are
the shadows of everything that has ever passed over it.'</p>

<p>"'Is that so?' I questioned.</p>

<p>"'Ay, it is so,' he answered. 'Allah has willed it. Here
across this desert a million feet have passed, and the sands
still hold the shadows of those people.'</p>

<p>"I looked at him and I looked at the bare sands. A madness was
on me then, a madness to find out how he worked his deviltry. I
should have choked him without listening to him, but I was a
fool. I, Pierre Lepre, was a fool!</p>

<p>"'Show me!' I cried. 'By the beard of Mohammed, if it is not
true I will throttle you without letting you speak another
word!"'</p>

<p>Pierre Lepre stopped and drew a great breath into his lungs.
The consul was leaning toward him, his eyes fixed upon the face
of the story teller. The white hand of the nun supported the
shoulders of the sick man.</p>

<p>"Now I will tell you of the miracle," said Lepre, speaking in
a tense whisper. "Now I will tell you what that wrinkled fiend
did out there in the desert. I am dying, and I must tell it
before I die. He scooped up sand with his withered fingers and
tossed that sand up against the big scared-looking moon that was
watching us. He tossed it up in a shower and I saw. <i>Mre de
Dieu!</i> I saw! He said that the shadows of everything that had
passed that way had fallen upon the sand and could be seen again
when he flung the sand up against the big moon. He was right. I
am dying, De Trolle, and I would not let my last words be false.
I would not. There, as he tossed up handful after handful of the
desert sand, I saw shadow pictures of those that had passed that
way through the centuries!</p>

<p>"Do you think I am mad? <i>Non</i>, you do not! I am sane! I
am as sane as you or this good nun who has been kind to me. My
brain is clearer today than it has been for months and months,
and I am telling you the truth.</p>

<p>"North and south across that desert they passed, and I saw
them. I saw them, De Trolle! Swordsmen and spearsmen, traders and
archers! Caravans of endless length. I saw them go by, saw them
go by as I crouched on the sand and watched with fear in my eyes!
I saw black-shawled men that I think must have been the shawled
butchers of Feerish of the Bloody Face. I saw them! They rode at
a gallop, their swords held high. <i>Wow!</i> what a sight it
was! I saw a brigade on swift-running Bisharin camels, a brigade
that must have passed that way three thousand years before. Never
have I seen such camels as those lean-flanked Bisharins.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen a moving shadow upon a white blind? Well,
that procession was something like that. There was an endless
procession of camels, traders, fighting men, slaves, pilgrims,
everything. That wizard knew that he was prolonging his life by
throwing up those pictures before my eyes and he worked magic as
he had never worked it before. He had felt the grip of my fingers
on his wind-pipe and he clawed at the sand and tossed it up so
that it fell in an endless shower between me and the big moon, an
endless shower of which, in falling, showed me the pictures of
the past and chilled my blood as I watched.</p>

<p>"Are you listening, De Trolle? He flung up those pictures for
five minutes, ten, fifteen, and I watched like a crazy man. I saw
sights that took my breath, sights that made me crouch in fear!
Magic? What kind of magic? Tell me, De Trolle? Tell me what kind
of magic he possessed to throw up before me a shadow picture of
spearsmen with the great big-shanked spears of a long-dead past.
There were Syrian bow-men, long lean swarthy brutes, and tall
brown men armed with Damascus blades that would take a giant to
handle. What kind of magic did he possess to make me see all
these things? What kind of magic, De Trolle?"</p>

<p>The fingers of Pierre Lepre reached out and gripped the
shoulder of the consul. The white-faced nun lowered her head as
if she was afraid that she would miss a word of the strange
story. There was a tensity in his voice that made his two
listeners feel certain that the climax was near.</p>

<p>"It was then that I saw the great wonder," continued the sick
man, speaking in a whisper that was so low that the nun's face
was close to his as he spoke. <i>"It was then&mdash;it was then
that I saw God!"</i></p>

<p>The white-faced sister gave a little cry of fear and put her
two hands together. De Trolle, leaning forward, forgot the pain
which the iron fingers of Lepre caused him as they clutched his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"In my little room at Dijon when I was a boy," whispered the
sick man, "there was a picture, a little picture that hung above
my cot. It was a picture of a woman and a child riding upon a
donkey with a man walking by their side. It hung above my cot
from the days of early childhood. It was the first picture
that I ever remember seeing. I would look at it
each night as I said my prayers before going to bed, and I would
look at it each morning when I said the 'Our Father' on
awakening. I remember on the night when I packed my little bundle
and ran away to become a drummer boy, that picture held me for a
moment before I jumped out of the window into the rose garden at
the back of the house. That picture was called the 'Flight into
Egypt.'"</p>

<p>De Trolle moistened his lips and gave a low gasp of wonder.
The face of the nun was whiter than her spotless linen habit.</p>

<p>Pierre Lepre continued. "They came before my eyes like a
fleeting shadow," he whispered. "Out of the north they came, the
woman and the child upon the donkey, the man hurrying by their
side. They were alone, moving southward swiftly, ever so swiftly.
I gave a cry of astonishment as I saw them. I thrust out my head
and stared, stared like a madman. By the bones of great St.
Pierre of Avignon who is my patron saint, I was stunned by the
sight! I forgot the wrinkled devil that I wanted to kill. I let
go of his throat and thrust my hands out to those three and cried
out as they passed hurriedly. I cried out to them. I screamed at
them! I got upon my feet and staggered after them like a drunken
man as they fled southward.</p>

<p>"They had their backs turned to me, their backs, mind you! In
the little picture over my cot at Dijon, the face of the child
looked down on me, and there&mdash;there out on that desert, I,
Pierre the Devil, who had not thought of that picture for a score
of years, wanted to see the face of that child turned to me as I
had seen it in the dream days of childhood. Do you understand me,
De Trolle? Do you understand what I mean? I wanted to look at his
face, to look at the face that I had watched as I whispered my
childish prayers beside the little cot in my mother's home. I
forgot that wrinkled wretch I had sworn to kill. I forgot her who
lay dead. I forgot everything. I was lifted out of myself and I
ran like a madman across the desert after a shadow, De Trolle. I
ran after a shadow that had overwhelmed me with a million
memories of childhood, memories that made me see that I was
filthy and unclean in the sight of God!"</p>

<p>The startled nun put her arms around the shoulders of the
dying man. The story had told upon the strength of Pierre Lepre.
For full three minutes he remained gasping, unable to proceed,
then once again he took up his wonder tale.</p>

<p>"I ran on and on," he gasped. "I pursued them over the white
sands. I screamed out to them. I screamed out to them as they
fled. They would not stop! They fled from me! They fled from me,
Pierre Lepre, because&mdash;because I was a devil who had robbed
and plundered and&mdash;and killed. I had killed the
<i>legionnaire</i> who jeered at me at Naama and I had killed
Galische and others! My hands&mdash;these hands&mdash;have
killed, and&mdash;and those three would not look. Do you hear me?
They would not look, although&mdash;although in the little
picture above my cot at Dijon He&mdash;He was always looking down
upon me!"</p>

<p>Pierre the Devil fell back exhausted upon the bed. He had
screamed out the last words of his story as if he wished every
person in that silent hospital to hear what he had to say. The
consul was on his feet now. The soft-voiced nun had her cool
fingers upon the heated brow of the <i>ex-legionnaire.</i> She
was whispering to him, and Lepre, with his eyes upon her,
listened.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" he breathed.</p>

<p>"He never runs away from anyone who seeks Him," murmured the
nun. "He never turns His head from those who are sorry for their
sins."</p>

<p>"But He turned His head from me!" gasped the dying man. "He
turned His face from me! I followed for hours. For hours, I tell
you! I ran on and on till I fell exhausted. I fell exhausted and
I lay there for three days before they found me and brought me
here, but He&mdash;He turned His head away from me
because&mdash;because I had the blood of Galische and a dozen
others upon my hands!"</p>

<p>"But He never turns His head away from those who are sorry,"
repeated the sister softly.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," whispered Pierre Lepre. "But it is too late."
The faint tones strengthened with agony.</p>

<p>The nun made a sudden gesture to De Trolle and stole from the
room. Pierre the Devil lay breathing painfully in the silence.
Then the door opened and the nun slipped in. She carried a small
framed print of the "Flight into Egypt."</p>

<p>Death was close to Pierre Lepre. De Trolle, bending over him,
saw that the flashing insolence had left the black eyes. The
nostrils of the nose looked pinched.</p>

<p>As the nun came to the bedside, Pierre Lepre spoke.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said again.</p>

<p>"Then He will turn to you," murmured the sister. "He will turn
to you with forgiveness in His eyes."</p>

<p>"It is too late," gasped Pierre the Devil.</p>

<p>"No!" cried the little nun with fervor. "He will turn His face
to all who are sorry. He did not turn His face from you. Ah no,
you are mistaken. You are His child now just the same as when you
slept in your little cot at Dijon. He is looking at you now. See!
He has forgiven you!"</p>

<p>The nun and consul bent over Pierre Lepre and the nun held the
picture before his dying eyes. The level sun rays struck through
the window and made the picture luminous. To the two who leaned
above the little cot it seemed as if the face of the adventurer
underwent a marvelous change. All the fighting deviltry seemed to
be gradually swept away by a smile of joy.</p>

<p>"Say it again," murmured the dying man.</p>

<p>"You are His child," murmured the nun. "You are His child now
as well as when you lived with your good mother at Dijon."</p>

<p>The last moments had come to the dying man. The lips of the
white-faced nun were moving softly, ever so softly, and the
consul's straining ears caught the prayer which she murmured. And
he repeated that prayer with her. Softly, ever so softly, the nun
and the consul repeated the prayer for the dying.</p>

<p>The shadows in the corner of the room increased. The silence
of the desert came over the Hospital of The White Nuns, a strange
silence that throttled the slightest noise. But the two watchers
repeated the prayers and, as they watched the sick man, the lips
of Pierre Lepre moved softly as if there had come to him in the
last few moments of life a boyhood prayer which he had forgotten
for years and years.</p>

<p>The white-faced nun lowered her head after many minutes. The
lips of Pierre Lepre were still. The calm of death was upon his
face. Gently the nun folded his arms upon his broad chest. Her
eyes were moist as she turned to the consul. "He is with God,"
she said softly.</p>

<p class="first">HOCHDORF, the German naturalist, sat in his big
chair upon the veranda of the lonely bungalow, and peered at the
narrow path that showed faintly in the gloom. A female monkey
within the house was scolding her offspring, and the ceaseless
chatter flowed out into the tropical dusk, a thin trickle of
noise that was sucked up by the silence of the encompassing
jungle. Down from Asia rolled the night, thick and oppressive,
and the massed trees conjured up a vision of many-limbed giants
assisting at some mysterious ceremony.</p>

<p>Presently Hochdorf spoke. "I am ten times a big fool," he
growled. "I had a letter that I wanted Gung to take down the
river to Brechmann, and I forgot to give it to him."</p>

<p>Gung, the Malay with the withered arm, had left the bungalow
some twenty minutes before Hochdorf spoke, and it was reasonable
to suppose that he had placed considerable distance between
himself and the home of the naturalist.</p>

<p>"I suppose he would not hear us if we ran down to the river
and shouted?" I questioned.</p>

<p>"No, no!" snapped the German. "He is out of hearing by this.
There is only one chance of his coming back: he might feel that I
want him."</p>

<p>The mother monkey stopped her chatter at that moment, and the
night seemed to be relieved. One pictured that noise as something
that was wounding the all-embracing quiet. Jungle and sky were
one, a soft, deep black, and as I tried to make out the path
down which the Malay had gone, my mental gizzard asked for some
solvent to help along the digestion of the naturalist's remark.
He had coolly stated that Gung might "feel" that he was wanted,
and the observation puzzled me.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" I asked. "How will he know?"</p>

<p>"I said that he might feel that I wanted him," said Hochdorf
quietly. "Gung has got a marvelous skin. <i>Ach!</i> yes. He can
feel things like a stalking leopard. I do not know how. I can
only say what I think, and I do not want to be asked for proofs.
I hate to give proofs. This jungle is not a court of law."</p>

<p>He spoke irritably and I made no comment. When Hochdorf was in
an ill humor it was wise to remain silent. And as we sat without
speaking, the oppressive quiet of the place became more apparent.
The silence seemed to rear up, a menacing, palpable thing that
was ready to pounce down upon human being or animal that dared to
make a sound.</p>

<p>But the sound came. From the direction of the river came the
faint <i>plut-plut</i> of bare feet; the rough steps creaked, and
someone halted upon the veranda. Hochdorf struck a match, and the
light revealed Gung, his withered arm hanging loosely by his
side.</p>

<p>He stood without moving, his brown body, with its
<i>chawat</i> of bark cloth, fitting in with the background. The
jungle was old, old as the Blue Rocks of Bintulu, and the brown
figure that had rippled the dark seemed part of it.</p>

<p>Hochdorf broke the silence. He drew himself out of the depths
of the big chair and spoke in an even, quiet voice. "There is a
note on the table that you must take down the river to
Brechmann," he said. "I forgot to give it to you before you
left."</p>

<p>The Malay gave a grunt and moved towards the door of the
bungalow. A slush lamp faintly illuminated the big room that was
filled with specimens. Near the door the native turned and
spoke.</p>

<p>"I had some nuts for the black monkey," he said, speaking in
his own tongue. "I forgot to give them to her, so I came
back."</p>

<p>Hochdorf sank back in his chair without making any comment.
Gung picked up the note, put a handful of nuts upon the pine
table and faded swiftly into the darkness. The <i>plut-plut</i>
of his feet became one with the soft breathing of the jungle.</p>

<p>For a long time the naturalist remained silent; then he
spoke.</p>

<p>"He said that he came back to bring nuts to the black monkey,"
he growled. "Perhaps he did. I do not know. Sometimes I think
that the greatest <i>savant</i> that ever came out of Leipzig is
a child compared with Gung&mdash;that is, on some things. Listen,
and I will tell you something. It concerns Gung. <i>Ja.</i> It
concerns him very much.</p>

<p>"Ten years ago I was on the Rejang River at a place that the
<i>lieber Gott</i> made when he was in a temper; and to that
place came a man named Herriott and his wife. They were Americans
who had come across Balabac Strait from Palawan. It was not a
nice place to bring a woman to, but Herriott's wife did not seem
to mind. There are times in the lives of some of us when the big
centers of the world do not look as nice as these spots on the
outer rim. And the Rejang River did not seem lonely to Herriott
and his wife. Not a bit of it! They loved each other with a love
that was big, and where love is, there is no room for loneliness.
This world is mighty small for lovers. They can look over space
from their little hills of bliss. They can see Teheran on one
side and see Papeete at the other, and they think a crowd is a
big nuisance.</p>

<p>"Herriott was a big man in a place like this. I gave him work
collecting specimens, and he was a mighty good collector. The
fault with nine men out of ten in this infernal archipelago is
their unreliability, but Herriott was different. He had no desire
to rush away to the big spots, and he would do things that he was
told to do.</p>

<p>"They had been here about seven months when I sent him up the
river on a trip to get some specimens that I wanted, and he had
been gone three days when his wife rushed into my bungalow
screaming like mad. <i>Gott!</i> didn't she scream!</p>

<p>"'What is wrong?' I roared. 'Quick! Tell me!'</p>

<p>"'Clinton!' she shrieked. Clinton was the first name of her
husband, and when she said it she looked as if she had seen his
ghost.</p>

<p>"'What is wrong with him?' I asked. And I wondered how she
could have got any word of him when he was away in the
jungle.</p>

<p>"'He is in danger!' she screamed, and when she had said that,
she fell down in a faint.</p>

<p>"It was an hour before I could get at the bottom of that
business. Do you know what had startled her? One of the Malays
had seen a strange white man going up the river, and the native
had told her. That was all. Her husband was up the river, too. Do
you see? She felt danger. <i>Ja</i>. I did not know their
history. This is not the place to cross examine anyone about his
past, but that woman's fear was not nice to see. It was the
essence of fear. All my arguments did nothing. A white man, who
was a stranger to the natives, had been seen going up the river,
and Herriott was up the river. I tried to prove to her that it
was some trapper that we knew, but she brought Gung, and Gung
said that the man was a stranger. So it was no use arguing. I had
to go out and hunt for her husband or sit still and watch her
going from one hysterical fit into another, and she was so good
at that business that I thought it would be better to hunt for
Herriott.</p>

<p>"That woman would insist on coming with me, and that made more
trouble. Taking a woman to her husband in this jungle is not like
taking her from Wall Street to Harlem in one of those burrows
that you have over there in the United States. <i>Nein</i>. That
place on the Rejang River was a little annex to Sheol. You bet it
was. I was as mad as a hungry cobra when I ordered the Dyaks to
get out the boat, and she crying for her Clinton all the time
they were getting it ready. I thought it was a nice piece of
foolishness, and I damned Gung for telling her that he had met a
stranger.</p>

<p>"'Why did you tell her about the man?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'I do not know,' he snarled. 'I just told her and that is
all.'</p>

<p>"Well, we started up the river in pursuit of Herriott, and I
was just bubbling with temper all the time. Six Dyaks, Gung, Mrs.
Herriott and myself were in the boat&mdash;nine of us, and we
were starting out to bring a man back from a collecting trip
simply because his wife had got a nervous feeling about his
safety! It was enough to irritate any man, was it not? Though
sometimes when I was swearing quietly to myself I would look at
that woman, and I would see again the terror in her eyes that I
had noticed when she rushed into the bungalow. Once or twice I
had seen terror like that, and it puzzled me to see it then. That
fool Gung saw the fear too&mdash; you bet he did. When the Dyaks
loafed, he walloped them with the flat of his oar, and all
through the next three days we pulled up the Rejang, fighting our
way through the nipa-palm growths in a heat that made us
gasp.</p>

<p>"We found out something in those three days. <i>Ja</i>. That
strange man that Gung had seen was no one that I knew. He was
not. The few men that were within a hundred miles of my camp were
collectors and naturalists, but this man was neither. I was
certain of that. The natives told me that they had shown him
everything they had, but he was not interested. He wanted to keep
right on. He had evidently something more attractive in sight
than specimens, and that puzzled me some. I kept the result of my
inquiries to myself, but that woman read the look of wonder on my
face. The more I questioned the Dyaks about the matter, the more
she urged haste, and the more that fool Gung walloped the boatmen
when he looked at the terror in her eyes. I felt that there was a
mystery in the business, but it was not for me to ask her
questions about the reasons why a strange man should be hunting
for her husband. <i>Nein</i>. I told you that it is a fool's
business to question people who get out on the fringe of the
earth. There are a lot of people in this infernal archipelago who
chopped their family tree down the day they started for these
islands. You can gamble mighty heavy on that.</p>

<p>"On the fourth day we got out of the boat and found the trail
of Herriott and the Kling guide that was with him, and we
followed that trail into the jungle. And we found something else
that made me mighty mad with the look of things. Yes, mighty mad!
We found that someone else had followed that trail, and that
someone had shoes on. Of course that proved that the trailer was
not a native, and that was news that upset my digestion.</p>

<p>"I did not tell the woman about the follower. Not much! She
was nearly crazy with the danger that her instinct told her of,
and I did not wish to send her clean off her head by telling her
of the marks of the other pair of shoes. A woman is a mighty
unreasonable person, and I was sick of the hysterical stunts that
she had played at my bungalow.</p>

<p>"On the afternoon of the fifth day we lost Herriott's track,
and that was unfortunate. Somehow we had got away from it in a
swamp patch where the black mud was so soft that it had filled up
the tracks of himself and the Kling the moment they passed, and I
got sick when I found that we could not find that trail again.
That woman was mighty near insane with fear just then.
<i>Mein</i> <i>Gott!</i> yes! Her nervousness about her husband's
safety was getting bigger with each step that she took through
that place, and she was all to pieces. I could not say anything
that would do her good. Not a thing! She felt that the danger to
Herriott was big, and when I thought of those shoe prints I felt
that she was right. But we could not find the trail, and we
floundered about like fools. When the night came down upon us I
was thinking that the best thing we could do was to make for the
Rejang in the hope that Herriott would turn back, but I knew that
the woman would never agree to return. Now I am going to tell you
about Gung. I said that the greatest <i>savant</i> that ever came
out of Leipzig would be a fool to him on some things. And it is
true.</p>

<p>"We camped that evening in the thickest bit of that infernal
jungle. The trees wedged themselves around us like the big
grenadiers at Potsdam, and the lianas hung from limbs like the
cobwebs of spiders. It was a nasty place. We managed to light a
fire to keep off the sweaty dampness, and we were huddled around
that fire when something happened to Gung. <i>Ja.</i> Something
happened to Gung! Do you think that he came back here tonight to
bring the nuts to the black monkey? Perhaps he did. I do not
know. This is Borneo, and just when a man thinks that he knows
something he finds that the bottom has been torn out of his
knowledge knapsack, and that everything has fallen out.</p>

<p>"But to get back to Gung: He was sitting on his hams near the
fire, and all of a sudden he pushed his head slowly forward and
stared at the darkness as if he had seen the three-headed specter
of Bak Trang. Have you ever seen a man look at a little square of
blackness with his eyes popping out? It gives you a funny
sensation, does it not? Well, Gung stared at the night as I had
never seen anyone stare before. It is a fact. He stared at it as
if he was trying to see something up in Singapore, five hundred
miles away. He looked so hard that the Dyaks who were busy
blowing the fire, and who had their backs turned to him, felt
that he was doing something out of the common, and they lifted
their heads to look at him. Shades of Friedrich Heinrich
Humboldt&mdash;didn't he stare!</p>

<p>"It was quite a minute before I was able to fire a question at
that idiot, but when I got my voice I fired one mighty loud. The
way he was looking at the dark, and the way he was gurgling, gave
me cold chills.</p>

<p><i>"'Gott im Himmell!'</i> I roared. 'What is the matter with
you?'</p>

<p><i>"'Wah!'</i> he groaned. <i>'Wah!'</i> He groaned just like
a sick orang-outang.</p>

<p>"'Speak!' I shouted. 'Speak!' I was that angry that I reached
over and grabbed him by the neck and shook him till the shark
teeth on his bracelets played a tune.</p>

<p>"I did not like the look on his face. I could not stand it.
Not much! A little of that kind of poppy show went a mighty long
way with me, and I could see that the woman and the six Dyaks had
seventeen different kinds of nightmare from the stare that he was
sending into the black patches between the <i>kaladang</i>
trees.</p>

<p>"'I will choke you if you do not speak!' I yelled. 'Tell me,
Gung! Tell me!'</p>

<p>"He opened his mouth and shut it again; he could not get
words. He wet his lips and tried again.</p>

<p>"'The Black Horsemen!' he moaned. <i>'The Black Horseme of Mir
Jehal!'</i></p>

<p>"I have never been as frightened as I was at that moment.
Never! I have been in a few tight corners in my time, but I have
never experienced the same kind of fear as the fear that gripped
me then. It was devilish fear. It seemed to me that a million
cold hands were reaching out of the darkness to choke me. That is
a fact. It might seem funny when I tell it to you now, but to me
at that moment <i>&mdash; Ach!</i> I am sick now when I look back
and think how I felt as I watched him.</p>

<p>"Herriott's wife and those six Dyaks had the squirmy feeling
mighty bad, too. And it was no wonder. The look on Gung's face
would cool one's blood quicker than an ice chamber. I have never
seen a man look like he did at that moment. And he looked at
nothing, mind you. Nothing!</p>

<p>"The woman sprang to her feet and stared at the trees, and
those six Dyaks did the same. Those natives had heard something
of those Horsemen that Gung had mentioned. This East is a
peculiar place. These people have mystery in their blood, and the
very look on the Malay's face told that half-dozen more than you
and I could read out of a book in a month.</p>

<p>"'Where are the Horsemen?' I stammered. 'Where are they?' It
was stupid to ask a fool question like that, but that little
incident had stampeded my wits.</p>

<p>"'They are going by,' whispered Gung. 'They are passing by
over there.'</p>

<p>"He spoke in the dialect, and he pointed into the thickest bit
of that darkness as he spoke. And it was like looking into a pot
of ink to stare at that patch. <i>Himmel!</i> Yes! All I could
hear was the jungle breathing as it is breathing now, with every
minute or so one of those queer little puffs of wind that seemed
to say 'Ssh!' as it slipped through the leaves.</p>

<p>"Herriott's wife clutched me by the arm, and the six Dyaks
huddled together. We had little chills running races up and down
our spines just then. Gung was still doing the pop-eyed stunt,
and he was doing it with all the energy he had to spare.</p>

<p>"'What does he see?' gasped Herriott's wife. 'Tell me!'</p>

<p>"'I do not know,' I said. 'I have heard much, but I know
little.' I was mighty mad with the woman and with Gung and with
everything.</p>

<p>"That Malay was squatting on his hams, quivering like a monkey
when a snake is climbing up the limb of the tree it is sitting
on, and he was listening with all his body. Not with his ears,
mind you. He was straining the night with his skin. I would like
to have a model of him in plaster as he sat there that
night&mdash;that is, if a sculptor could put the feeling into it.
It could be exhibited as something typical of this old world out
here.</p>

<p>"Those six Dyaks had shuffled round till they had their backs
to each other, and their faces turned towards the night. They
could not see or hear anything, but they were satisfied with the
look on Gung's face. They read that look. Their ancestors must
have looked like that when the ghost <i>mias</i> that the Kyans
speak of, the big white orang-outang that has lived a thousand
years, came crashing through the branches of the <i>tapang</i>
trees.</p>

<p>"'Oh, what does he hear?' cried Herriott's wife. 'What
horsemen are passing?'</p>

<p>"'He says that he hears The Black Horsemen,' I stammered, and
I kept my eyes on Gung as I spoke to her. I had heard something
of those same Horsemen, but I had kept what I heard to myself. It
is stupid to talk of everything that you hear in a place like
this. It is only the people with the sensitive cuticle that can
believe properly. I would just as soon tell this story to some
people as I would tell it to Jan Winklekop, who ran the little
beer house in the Kaiserplatz at Frankfurt. And Jan Winklekop was
as deaf as the statue of Friedrich Wilhelm.</p>

<p>"Gung's muscles relaxed when I answered Herriott's
<i>Frau</i>, and he looked up at us with a curious expression on
his face. He looked as if he had been hit with a sandbag.</p>

<p>"'Tell me!' shrieked the woman. 'Tell me what you heard!'</p>

<p>"'I heard The Black Horsemen,' whispered Gung. 'They passed by
in the trees over there.'</p>

<p>"I tell you that the mystery that the Malay put into his
answer took the breath from that woman. It took the breath from
me, too. I have heard people say things, and the tone of their
voice has given their assertions the lie, but with
Gung&mdash;<i>Ach!</i> when he said that I got gooseflesh all
over my body.</p>

<p>"'But what are they?' gurgled the woman.</p>

<p>"'They are the appointed of Buddha,' breathed Gung. 'They
collect the souls of the dead!'</p>

<p>"That was a nice thing to tell to that woman, was it not? She
was thinking of her husband and the danger he was in, and that
fool Malay informs her in a whisper that The Black Horsemen of
Mir Jehal, that had just ridden by, are Buddha's messengers whose
duty it is to collect the souls of the dead! It was terrible. I
tried to kick that native so that he would hold his tongue, but
the woman pushed me away.</p>

<p>"'I want to know!' she screamed: 'I must know!'</p>

<p>"And that idiot Gung was only too ready to tell her. His
breath had been shut off so long with the horror that had pinched
his windpipe, that he wanted to see if he had got his speech
back. That was the case. And the woman was crazy with fear as she
listened to him. There is no fear like the fear that comes from
the things that you cannot see, and we were getting some of that
just then.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of The Black Horsemen of Mir Jehal? You
have not? That is strange. You can hear of them from the gates of
Kandahar, to Bangkok, and from Cape Comorin to the Lanak Pass. I
had heard the story before that night, but it had never impressed
me as it impressed me then. My, no! It bit into my body like
acid when Gung started to tell it to Herriott's wife in that
jungle. It made my hair prickle. Right in the middle of the
telling, a wet branch of a cinnamon tree touched my neck, and I,
Hermann Hochdorf, who has lived in this jungle till I have become
a part of it&mdash;I felt inclined to yell out with terror.</p>

<p>"Gung was the devil of a story-teller. He was an expert. Your
Oriental can put in all the little shivery business that is
beyond our art. He told that yarn in a way that hit her in the
emotional solar plexus. And it was a terrible story. He told her
how The Black Horsemen of Mir Jehal were the greatest butchers
that India had ever known. They had made rivers out of the blood
they had spilled. They were devils for slaughter. Down from the
Karakoram Hills they had swept through Kashmir into the Punjab,
and men, women, and children were killed without any cause. They
slashed and hacked with their crooked swords, and they galloped
down the fugitives that tried to get away from them. They were
fiends. The Red Butchers of Zafir Khan and the bodyguard of
Tamerlane were so many greenhorns compared to Mir Jehal's
batch&mdash;that is, if Gung's story was a true one. As he told
it, he jumped from pigeon English into the Malay dialect, and
from the Malay into the lingo of the Bugis, but the woman
followed him. It was not hard to follow him. He was a master of
all that fool wriggling business that Frenchman do when they are
telling a story. He was telling half of it with his shoulders and
eyes, and half with his tongue.</p>

<p>"Then that Malay told what happened to The Black Horsemen.
They fell in with a bunch of Pathans at Kabul River, and those
Pathans were some fighters. You bet they were. They were big,
hairy devils that would have taken on a batch from Sheol, and
they went for Mir Jehal's batch like hungry leopards at a bunch
of mountain goats. I would have liked to see that fight. It must
have been something like the charge of the cavalry of Prince
Friederich Charles at Froschweiler. <i>Himmel!</i> Yes! Those
Pathans had a blood thirst that did not cool till the last one of
The Black Horsemen was wiped out. The Pathans didn't leave a
single one of them to tell the story, so Gung said.</p>

<p>"The imagination of the East got busy after that little
happening. A Yogi of Benares had a vision, and he must have had a
newspaper man's eye for something sensational, <i>la.</i> In his
dream he saw the Death Angel standing in front of Buddha, and he
listened to the conversation.</p>

<p>"'What can I do for you?' asked Buddha.</p>

<p>"'You can give me a rest,' said the Death Angel. 'I have grown
weary collecting the souls of those that The Black Horsemen of
Mir Jehal have butchered.'</p>

<p>"'And who will fill your place?' asked Buddha.</p>

<p>"'Give the work to The Black Horsemen now that they are dead,'
answered the Death Angel. 'Let them go out and collect the souls
of the dead, because it has been their butcheries that have made
me tired.'</p>

<p>"Buddha saw the wisdom of the argument, according to the Yogi,
and he gave the Death Angel's job to The Black Horsemen for all
time. Now you will see how that stunt of Gung's affected us in
the jungle near the Rejang. The Black Horsemen had to be on hand
when anyone was dying so that they could collect the soul, and
when they passed us by we were thinking of the danger that
threatened Herriott. It was a nice story for a woman who was
nearly crazy with fear to listen to, was it not? The Dyaks had no
lost relations, but their jawbones started to rattle; and I had
no one that I thought was near death, and I was mighty scared;
but that woman&mdash;By the wisdom of Cuvier! she was in a nice
state!</p>

<p>"'What direction have they gone?' she screamed, when Gung had
finished his story. 'Which way did they go?'</p>

<p>"'That way,' said Gung, and he pointed into the darkness
towards the north.</p>

<p>"'Then we'll go that way!' she shrieked, and she started to
push that terrified Malay into the thick night.</p>

<p>"Gung did not want to leave the fire just then. You bet he
didn't. Your frightened native will cling to a live coal like a
crocodile to a mudbank. But that woman of Herriott's was a
determined woman. That story had made all her fears bubble over.
Her imagination made her see Herriott's finish after that nigger
had told her what The Black Horsemen went out for. She was
insane. I tried to convince her that the fool Malay had been
chewing opium, but she said that opium would not bring that look
of fear to his face when he was staring at the night. And I guess
she was right. I have never seen a look of terror like the one
that was pasted on that native's face.</p>

<p>"'Wait till morning,' I said. 'We cannot find any trail
now.'</p>

<p>"'I will not wait!' she screamed. 'I will go now!'</p>

<p>"She grabbed hold of Gung like a mad woman, and she pushed him
towards the spot that he had been looking at. Gung did not like
it one bit. He thought that he had enough of those Black Horsemen
for one night without setting out on their trail, but he did not
know what a woman who loves her husband can do when she thinks
that he is in danger. That woman had the strength of three men
just at that moment. She took that husky native and rushed him
forward as if he were a baby, and I followed them. Those six
Dyaks followed too. They were too scared to stay behind. They
snatched some lighted branches from the fire and scampered along
behind us.</p>

<p>"Belief, my friend, is just a question of presenting the thing
that you want a person to believe. That is all. You might be
inclined to laugh at this story of The Black Horsemen, but you
would not have laughed that night in the jungle. The thing would
have bit through the coating of scepticism that you have put over
your bump of credulity. I am an unbelieving person sometimes, but
on that night I was different.</p>

<p>"The woman started to cry out the name of her husband, and her
shrieks went out into the silence. 'Be quiet,' I said. 'You will
stampede the niggers.'</p>

<p>"'But The Black Horsemen!' she sobbed. 'My husband is dead or
dying! Follow them! Follow them! Hurry!'</p>

<p>"Sometimes now, on quiet evenings, I sit here and look back on
that night I try to analyze the feelings that gripped me. I am a
German, and I am not easily excited, but on that night I flung my
mental ballast overboard and did crazy things. I rushed along
with the woman and Gung, plunging through the thick undergrowth,
and behind me came the Dyaks, waving the fire sticks they had
plucked from the fire. I was as scared as the Dyaks. I was
frightened more than I can tell you. At Gravelotte, my friend, I
did not get scared when the French were giving us something hot;
but the French were flesh and blood, and they made mighty good
marks to aim at. Those things that Gung was chattering about were
somewhat different.</p>

<p>"I cannot describe that night to you very well. I mean the
part of it between the time we left the fire and the time that
the dawn came out of the Celebes Sea. I am in doubt about little
parts of it, and it annoys a scientific mind to find that things
are a little hazy. It was a fiendish night&mdash;a terrible
night! I thought that the darkness was a blanket that was wrapped
around us, and out of which we were trying to claw ourselves.
Claw ourselves, mind you! Did the night ever feel that thick to
you that you were certain you had a lump of it in your hand when
you shut your fist? Well, that night was one of the thick kind.
It smothered us. We choked in it. Sometimes, when an infernal
snaky liana gripped my throat and nearly jerked me off my feet, I
was in doubt if it was a creeper or an invisible hand. I was a
confounded old fool that night. I was silly. That is why I say
that belief is only a matter of presenting the thing that you
want the person to believe in.</p>

<p>"We must have been running about two hours when that fool Gung
got another of his pop-eyed turns. He fell on his knees and
started groaning like the devil, and when the woman shrieked a
question at him, he said that they were right in front of us. He
meant The Black Horsemen were just in front of us. You can smile,
but you would not have smiled in that place. I would have given
something to be back in my bungalow at that moment. I was full up
of that circus. You bet I was. I got that mad that I kicked the
Malay in my temper, and I dragged him to his feet and pushed him
forward. I was as mad as the woman to see what was in front of
us, and to find out if that fool could really hear something. All
I could hear was the sighing of the jungle and those little puffs
of wind that the Kyans call 'the breath of God.' Gung was nearly
insane with fear, and those six Dyaks were mighty crazy too. What
with the woman calling for her husband, and the Malay gasping out
the news of The Black Horsemen it was mighty tough. It was enough
to send a man out of his head.</p>

<p>"'Gung,' I said, 'if you do not stop your tricks I will strap
you to a tree and leave you there.'</p>

<p>"'But they are here!' he moaned.</p>

<p>"'Shucks!' I roared. 'Do you think that I am an old fool?'</p>

<p>"'But, master,' he cried, 'I heard them go by, and they are
just ahead of us now!'</p>

<p>"I gave that fool a bang in the ear; and just as I did that, I
fell over something and tripped on my face. <i>'Himmel!'</i> I
yelled. 'I will be mad before this business is finished. Bring me
a light till I see what I have tripped over.'</p>

<p>"One of the Dyaks ran up with a torch that he had carried from
the fire, and I poked around in the jungle grass. I found that
something pretty soon. It was the body of the Kling guide that
had gone out with Herriott, and there was a little hole in the
back of his head where a rifle bullet had caught up to him when
he was running. And Herriott did not have a rifle. He had only a
shot gun.</p>

<p>"You can understand the row that Herriott's wife kicked up
when she saw that dead Kling. You can guess how she went on. She
was a mad-woman for certain then. Someone had shot that nigger
from behind, and that satisfied me that the fellow who was
following Herriott was not a friend of his. I knew then that he
was an enemy who had probably trailed him from the United States
to the Philippines, and from Palawan to the Rejang River.</p>

<p>"It was too dark to see the trail of anyone leading away from
that body, and I implored the woman to wait until morning so that
we could pick it up and follow it, but she was gambling on the
intelligence of the Malay. She reckoned that the finding of the
body proved that Gung had made good, and she would not wait. She
was convinced that the fool nigger had seen or heard The Black
Horsemen. My, yes! She was beseeching him to go on, and that
shivering native was that scared that he didn't know whether he
was going frontwards or backwards. And I was an old fool too. I
had not one ounce of sense at that minute. When she pushed Gung
forward I followed, and away we went again, the Dyaks waving
their fire sticks as we ran.</p>

<p>"You know how you sense a danger in the dark. Well, once I
thought that we were running along the edge of a precipice, and
that chilled me too. I stooped and picked up a stone, and I
jerked the stone into the darkness to the right. I did not hear
the stone strike anything. It just went into the dark, and not a
sound came to me.</p>

<p>"'Gung!' I shouted. 'Where are you going? Stop or I will kill
you!' My nerves had gone to pieces then, and I was as mad as a
crocodile that has lost its tail.</p>

<p>"It was the woman that answered my question. She was insane,
too; but it was a different kind of insanity. You bet it was. She
was insane with the thoughts of the danger that threatened her
husband, while I was crazy over my own danger. 'Gung must not
stop!' she screamed. 'I feel that I am near Clinton!'</p>

<p>"'You are mad!' I yelled back. 'That fool nigger will be the
death of all of us!'</p>

<p>"I could not catch the answer she flung back at me. I think
she called me a coward. I am not sure.</p>

<p>"I threw another stone into that spongy darkness to my right
as I raced along, and I could not hear that stone drop. It made
me sweat good and plenty. And I threw one more stone, and it was
the same thing. If I could have got my fingers on Gung at that
moment I would have throttled him. I would so.</p>

<p>"'Stop! Stop!' I screamed. 'We are running on the edge of a
precipice!'</p>

<p>"The terror that came to me out of the dark made me throw
myself on my face then, and as I fell I heard Gung and the woman
crashing on through the undergrowth. But I had enough of that
running business. Holy St. Anthony! Yes! I was determined I would
not run another yard into that darkness. Not one yard.</p>

<p>"'You old fool!' I said to myself. 'You have not lost your
wits altogether. Stay right where you are till morning and then
follow the trail of those two lunatics when the dawn comes.'</p>

<p>"My knees knocked together every time I thought of those
stones that I had thrown. If you jerk a rock into the dark and
you do not hear it strike the ground, it gives you a chill. Is
not that so?</p>

<p>"I stopped in my tracks, and I screamed out to the six Dyaks.
I told them that I was going to stay where I was till the dawn,
and those niggers were only too pleased to wait. They had enough
of that insane run through the night, and from the way they
chattered to each other I guess that they had sensed danger from
that ravine.</p>

<p>"Those Dyaks clustered round me in a little group, and after
the sounds made by Gung and Mrs. Herriott had been eaten up by
the night, a silence fell on that place that was damnable. It was
so. It was worse than any silence I have ever known, and when I
put a question to those natives they were that scared that they
would not answer. I was wishing that Gung was within reach of my
fingers as I stood there waiting.</p>

<p>"I stood there till the darkness in the east became a coppery
tint, and then I started to creep forward again. You know the
quiet of a tropical morning? It seemed as if the whole world was
waiting for something&mdash;and into that terrific quiet came a
sound that startled me. It was the report of a rifle, my friend.
Yes, a rifle! I knew that Gung and Mrs. Herriott had no rifle,
and as that sound came to my ears I called myself every kind of a
fool for letting that pair get away from me. I damned myself for
an idiot as I dashed forward with the Dyaks at my heels. A
million questions were turning handsprings in my brain. What had
happened? Who had fired the shot? What had Gung felt that had
brought him in that direction? <i>Himmel!</i></p>

<p>"That coppery tint in the east turned into pearl and then into
baby pink. Then we could see just a little. The ravine that I had
sensed in the dark was there all right. My, yes! It was filled
with dawn mists that were like ghosts, and I wondered as I
clawed myself along the edge how Gung and the woman had dodged
it. And those Dyaks were wondering too. It was something to
wonder about, I tell you.</p>

<p>"The sun came up with a hop like he does here in the tropics,
and as I clawed my way through a clump of rattans and reached a
clearing on the edge of the ravine, there came the report of
another shot. It came from the big gash in the ground, and the
place was so full of fog clouds that I could not see anything.
Not a thing! The mist filled that chasm like big lumps of cotton
batting, and I raced along the edge trying to peer down into it.
There is nothing so mysterious as a big trench in the earth that
is filled with fog&mdash;nothing. That place made me shiver.</p>

<p>"Those Dyaks were running up and down too. They wanted to see
what was going on down there in the banks of mist. <i>Gott</i>,
yes! And it was one of those natives that made the discovery. He
had flung himself on his stomach, and he was peering down through
the rifts of the fog bank. The heat of the sun was drawing the
mist up, and when the Dyak made a soft noise and pointed with his
hand, I dropped down beside him. I could see underneath that
curtain. <i>Ja.</i> Down into the ravine I looked, and nearly
three hundred yards down the bank I saw something that I thought
was a bleached <i>tapang</i> log. Then I saw that I was wrong.
The thing was moving, crawling along a ledge. It was going slow,
very slow. It was creeping from one little clump of brush to
another, and I held my breath as I looked. That crawling figure
made me swallow with excitement, and as I stared I sensed who it
was. You bet I knew. I could not see the face, but I felt who it
was. It was Mrs. Herriott!</p>

<p>"Someone has said that imagination is but concentrated race
experience. I think it is. Something in that woman's actions tied
my tongue. My race experience stopped me from calling out to her.
My ancestors had seen a person crawl like that, and I kept quiet.
Every muscle in my body stiffened as I lay there and watched her.
I clawed the ground till my fingers were bleeding. In the quiet
of that place I seemed to feel the strain that she was under. I
seemed to feel the hate that was sending her along that dizzy
ledge. I knew everything, my friend. I looked at the big clump of
bush about ten feet in front of her and I prayed. I knew she was
making for that clump, and the Dyaks knew. They had flung
themselves down and were staring at her with all their eyes. They
had done a little stalking in their time, and they were
calculating the odds.</p>

<p>"A puff of smoke came out of that clump that the woman was
making for, and we heard the report of another shot. I nearly
drove my nails through my palms then. Of course you know why? The
man that had shot the Kling was in the clump, and he was sniping
at Herriott, who was somewhere down in the ravine!</p>

<p>"The woman stopped for a second when the rifle popped; then
she crawled hurriedly forward. I have seen a leopardess crawl
like she crawled then. Yes, I have. She slipped over those few
feet of bare ground like a rock snake; then she gathered herself
together and sprang!</p>

<p>"The mist covered that place the next moment, and with a mad
cry I sprang to my feet and started to slip and slide down into
the ravine. I beat those natives at that game. I was crazy to get
to the woman to see if she had been successful. Somehow I felt
that she had, and yet I cursed myself for letting her get away
from me in the night.</p>

<p>"It was nearly twenty minutes before we reached that spot, and
then we saw her. And we saw Herriott too. She was trying to lift
him to his feet, but he had got a bullet in the hip and he could
not stand. I looked at the woman and she looked at me. I think
the wife of the primitive man must have looked like her when she
helped her mate to kill the she bear that had invaded their cave.
I think so. There was a look on her face that was new to me, and
Gung's knife was stuck into her belt, and it had blood on it.
When she saw me look at that knife, she dropped her eyes and
kissed Herriott.</p>

<p>"That is all I have to tell you. I doctored Herriott, and we
carried him back to the Rejang. I didn't ask questions. Not one!
Mrs. Herriott gave Gung about five hundred dollars worth of
presents, and when Herriott got on his feet they packed up their
things and went back to the Philippines.</p>

<p>"But it was peculiar about Gung and The Black Horsemen of Mir
Jehal, was it not? I wish I had a plaster cast of him as he
squatted in that jungle when he said that he heard them riding
by. I would think a lot of it. Never have I seen a man listen
like he listened then. Never!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE ORANG-OUTANG FIGHT ON THE PAPUAN QUEEN</h2>

<h3>ILLUSTRATED BY M. LEONE BRACKER (1885-1937)</h3>

<h3>First published in <i>The American Magazine</i>, June 1910</h3>

<p class="chaphead">The Story of a Fourteen Day and Night Vigil</p>
<br>

<p>THERE is a guarantee behind this story. You will read of it at
the end, and the Amsterdam address of Herr Scheibel will be
furnished on application. It is Scheibel's story, and he told it
one night in a little <i>caf chantant</i> at Port Kennedy, when
the peculiar purple twilight of the tropics was washing out the
sharp outlines of the pearling boats in the harbor.</p>

<p>Scheibel was a stooped German naturalist, and he had spent the
greater part of his life in those ports of the outer fringe above
which Dame Adventure still waves her golden flag. He chattered in
all the lingoes of the Archipelago, and Kyan and Kling, Orang
Laut and Malay swore by his knowledge. In the nipa-palm hut
clusters between Banguey and Mabudauan he was always welcome, and
his knowledge of the lower creation was extensive. He was
familiar with the habits of the green water snake, and he
understood the family relations of every other living creature
between that reptile and the <i>Simia wurmbii</i>, the big, hairy
orang-outang of Borneo.</p>

title="Illustration">

<p>Letters from his employers at Amsterdam followed him up and
down the islands, and he carried out the orders which those
letters contained. Implicit obedience brought him a yearly salary
of eight thousand marks. He gathered everything from the jumping
mudfish to the human heads which the genial Kyan tied up neatly
with rattan fiber and smoked over his family fireplace, and
occasionally he shipped his loads in bullnosed tramps that went
cargo hunting up and down the tracks of the outer rim.</p>

<p>Delnard, once captain of a B.I. boat, who lost his certificate
when he ran the <i>Prince of India</i> aground in Sunda Strait,
had been speaking of the length of time a man could keep awake in
the face of great danger, and he was telling of a sleepless watch
of six days and nights when the naturalist interrupted.</p>

<p>"Dot was noddings," he grunted. "Dot was what you call one
easy stunt. But of course der man you tell of had nodding to keep
him awake. I mean he had no big stake, no grade incentive, an'
derefore we may call it goodt. It is not a question of a man's
strength, it is a question of what he will lose by going to
sleep."</p>

<p>"Well, this fellow would have lost his life," growled
Delnard.</p>

<p>"His life?" repeated the German. "Of course he would! But what
of dot? <i>Puff!</i> What does a man care for his life when he is
very tired? Noddings. It is somedings greater dan life dot makes
men do big deeds. But speaking of sleep I will tell you a story
of a man. It is shust a leedle story but it will show what I
mean.</p>

<p>"Dis man, we will call him Adolph, he was a naturalist, an' he
loved his work. He went after der big orang-outangs of Borneo,
der <i>wurmbii</i> an' der <i>satyrus</i>, an' for a whole year
he trap dem on der Simujan River. It was der devil of a place.
Der mist hung over der river like der fogs on der German Ocean,
an' he drank quinine like I drink beer. He took it mit each meal,
an' he nip at it in between. Hell is shust one degree worse dan
dot river. But dere were orang-outangs dere, an' he trap, trap,
trap for one year. He was shust obeying orders. He was what you
call it, one tall private, eh?"</p>

<p>"A high private," murmured Merrin.</p>

title="Illustration">

<p>"Dot is it! He was shust a high private. Der generals were
over in Amsterdam. Dey got letters from all der zoological beeple
in der world telling dem what was wanted, an' den dey tell Adolph
an' a hundred odder men scattered all over der earth what der
zoological beeples ask for. Der generals didn't know of dot
Simujan River. Dey didn't know about der fog. Dey didn't know dot
Adolph haf to drink so much quinine, or dey did not know how he
haf to wade droo der mud under der screw palms an' risk der
chance of losing his leg when he poked his toe in der eye of a
crocodile taking der mud bath treatment. Dey would not haf cared
if dey did know, so he did not write about it. Oh, no! Dey told
him to get somedings an' he got dem. His peezness was shust to do
as he was told."</p>

<p>"But we were talking about sleep," grumbled Delnard.</p>

<p>"Shust so, but I was spik to you first of der causes dot keep
a man awake. You talk of life. Do de men dot get dere livings in
der islands tink of dere lives? No, mine friendt. But dis Adolph
haf somedings else. He was told to trap alive ten of der finest
specimends of der <i>Simia wurmbii</i>, an' he did it. Dey were
der very finest specimends. You never saw such orang-outangs as
dose. No one ever did. <i>Gott im Himmel!</i> No! Dey was grade
hairy devils mit chests on dem like beer barrels. Dey was
glorious specimends. Adolph drink dere health efery night in
quinine, an' he was feel mighty proud of himself. He had done
what no one else haf done. He shust sit an' talk to dose
orang-outangs an' wish dot der boat would come along to take dem
over to Singapore.</p>

<p>"Der <i>Papuan Queen</i> was der first boat to come along,
an' Adolph was in such a hurry dot he makes an agreement mit der
captain to take dose orangs over to der Peninsula. Der <i>Papuan
Queen</i> was shust one rotten ship. She haf all der <i>Simia
wurmbii</i> seasick der moment der China Sea get under her and
gif her a bounce. Efery one of der timbers cry out an' groan, an'
der orangs chatter one to anodder an' say dey was not in a bretty
safe place. Dey was rather intelligent, mine friendts. Efery time
one of dose big waves slapped himself over der side dey would
yell an' scream jus' like der women, an' dot captain laugh an'
tink it funny. Adolph ask him did his ship always rock like dot,
an' den he fall down mit laughing. 'She is chronic,' he was say;
'we stop once for a year in Santander in der Bay of Biscay an'
she contract der habit.'</p>

title="Illustration">

<p>"Adolph tried to tell der <i>Simia wurmbii</i> dot tings were
not as bad as dey look, but der orangs were not fools. Not much.
Dey tink different. Der boat was buckshumping like a mad broncho,
an' dose grade hairy devils watch her an' say tings to each odder
dot was not complimentary to der owners an' captain.</p>

<p>"An' dose missing links was bretty right. Dot old sailing tub
starts in to drink up der China Sea droo some cracks in her
bottom on der second morning out from der Simujan, an' der
captain stopped laughing mighty sudden. Der <i>Simia wurmbii</i>
listen to him yelling out orders an' dey guess he was afraid. Dey
is bretty observant, dose hairy devils. Dey screamed an'
chattered a lot when dey see how tings were going, an' der
captain got mad. 'Keep it up, you pigs,' he said to dem,' if you
do not scream now you will not get anodder chance,' an' dey seem
to understand. He was order out der boats an' dey guess at tings
mighty quick. Den Adolph start to cry, an' dose orangs cry mit
him all together."</p>

<p>"Huh!" grunted a greasy beachcomber, "What was he yelping
about?"</p>

<p>"Not from fear, mine friendt!" snapped the naturalist.
<i>"Mein Gott!</i> No! I tell you he was one high private. Well?
He had not finished doing shust what he was told to do. Dot was
all. See? He was told to get ten <i>mias chappin</i>, as der
Malay call dem, but instead of going to Singapore dey was going
to der bottom of der China Sea. An' dere was never such
specimends of the <i>Simia wurmbii</i> as he haf on de deck of
dot rotten tub. Dey was der kings of dere beeples, an' dey haf
hair hanging from der shoulders eighteen inches long. Never was
dere such specimends in captivity.</p>

<p>"Der captain caught hold of Adolph when der boats were ready.
'Come on, you poor, blubbering Dutchman,' he say, 'we was haf to
leave der menagerie.' But Adolph cursed him an' got away. Den der
captain shout out to der men. 'Der Dutchman is gone mad cause we
won't take his monkeys,' he says; 'lend a hand here.' Den some
of der sailors grip hold of der naturalist an' dump him into der
boat, an' der <i>Simia wurmbii</i> scream when dey see him go
over der side.</p>

<p>"Dot scream did somedings. Der Irish mate was der last to come
down der rope, an' dot scream of dose orang-outangs was touch his
heart. He picked up der axe, an' he ran along in front of der
cages an' smash off der locks; den he spring for der rope. 'I do
not know if dey can swim,' he gasps, 'but, by jiminy I gif dem a
chance!'</p>

<p>"Shust at dot moment Adolph got away from der captain who was
holding him in der bottom of der boat. I told you dot he was one
high private. Very goodt. He grab der rope down which der Irish
mate was swing himself, an' he went up it shust as der first
orang got out of his cage an' look over der side of der ship to
see how deep der water was. Der captain tink dot fellow was going
to shump. He yells out to pull like der devil, an' dey did, an'
dey leave Adolph clutching der side of der <i>Papuan Queen</i>
which was haf ten <i>mias chappin</i> walking round her
deck."</p>

<p>"Served the blame fool right," growled Delnard.</p>

<p>"Shust so! Served der blame fool right," echoed Scheibel. "But
he could not help himself. His life he did not tink of.
<i>Ach!</i> No! He was tink of dose ten. Dey were der
gradest specimends der world haf ever seen, an'
he haf written his employers to say dot he was ship dem from
Singapore. Dot was why he come back on dot tub. Dose ten was so
splendid dot he never tink the <i>lieber Gott</i> would take dem
from him again after he trap dem, dot was all. An' he was born to
do as he was told, an' dose men who are born so do not tink of
life."</p>

<p>"Well? What happened then?" asked Merrin, as the naturalist
remained silent.</p>

<p>"Now I come to der sleep question," said Scheibel slowly.
"Dere was no chance of getting dose <i>Simia wurmbii</i> into
dere cages again. Dot Irish mate was a goodt man mit der axe.
Adolph did not know what to do shust for a minute, but he do one
ting dot was bretty lucky. He got der wheel, an' he keep der
<i>Papuan Queen</i> before der wind, an' der wind was blowing to
der west. Singapore was in der west. He know dot an' no more. He
was not a sailor; he was study der lower creation. Der ship was
bretty low in der water den, but she was still afloat, an' Adolph
haf been trained to hang on mit his teeth skins while dere was a
chance of somedings turning up.</p>

<p>"Dose <i>Simia wurmbii</i> was stand an' look at him after dey
see dot dere was no land near dem. Dey was not fools. Dey know
dot Borneo was in der east, an' dey know dey was going in der
wrong direction. Dey smell der Simujan River on der breeze dot
was come across der ocean, an' dey talk a lot in monkey
gibberish. Dey sniff der pandanus palms, an' der durians, an' der
mangosteens an' dey was sad, mine friendts. Dey hold a
consultation an' dey decide dot der leedle steering wheel dot
Adolph was turning was der cause of all der trouble, an' a big
hairy devil was make a suggestion. He was tell dem to take der
leedle wheel an' break it up an' drop it over der side, an' dey
scream out an' clap him.</p>

<p>"Dot was quite a little fight shust den. Adolph was lash der
wheel an' go to meet dem at der ladder. He was haf a revolver but
he did not want to shoot. Oh, no! Dey was der finest specimends
dot der world ever see. He shust wanted to give dem a leedle bit
of discouragement, an' he do it mit a bar of iron. He banged dem
on der head an' der arms, an' dey clawed at him mit dere big arms
an' bit mit dere teeth. But dey was haf no discipline. Dey was
not come together, but one after der odder an' dey get dot big
crowbar on der head efery time. But it was quite a leedle fight.
Dose missing links spend der rest of der day feeling der lumps
upon themselves, an' Adolph was do a bit of doctoring on himself.
One of dose orangs was tear his leg open mit his big hand, an'
anodder had nearly knocked out his eye mit a piece of wood. Dey
wanted dot wheel bretty bad.</p>

<p>"Now I was talk about sleep. <i>Ach!</i> I was talk it blenty
now. Dose orang-outangs know dot Adolph was take a leedle snooze
some time, an' dey wait. Der <i>Papuan Queen</i> she was lay down
bretty low in der water, but some timber in der hold keep her
from sinking. Der <i>Simia wurmbii</i> pick der big hairy devil
as dere leader, an' dey rush on Adolph in der dark. He had been
waiting for dot rush, an' dey got a surprise or two. He laid a
leedle powder train in dere track, an' der fireworks upset dem
mooch. But dey fought game. He laid one senseless an' broke der
hand of anodder mit a shot from his revolver. He cried when he
see dot fellow mit der broken arm next morning, but he had to do
it. Dey wanted der wheel, an' it was his peezness to see dot dey
get it not. Dis is where I simplify my argument. Dis is where I
show dot it requires somedings more dan love of life to keep
awake for der very long time. An' Adolph haf dot somedings. He
haf to get der ten finest specimends of der <i>Simia wurmbii</i>
to Singapore, an he was trying to do it. Dot is why he was haf to
keep awake.</p>

<img src="2200261h-images/TheOrangOutangFight-4.png"
style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p>"Der <i>Papuan Queen</i> was shust a water-logged hulk der
next day, but Adolph keep her nose to der west, an' der <i>mias
chappin</i> cry when dey smell Borneo on der wind. A lot of dem
haf-wives an' children on der bank of der Simujan River, an' dey
feel bretty bad rolling along der top of der China Sea. All der
day dey prowl round der ship an' cry out at him an' make faces at
him.</p>

<p>"Dot night dere was a devil of a fight. Dey would haf won if
dey haf any system, but dey haf not. Adolph fought like der
devil, an' when he haf dem on der run he chase dem down past der
cook's galley, an' he grabbed some biscuits an' water before dey
turn round. But dey use him bretty bad dot night. He was haf a
wound in der chest dot was bleeding mooch, an he tinks dey win in
der end.</p>


<p>"Der next day one of der <i>mias</i>, a grade ugly devil mit
black teeth, climb up der mast mit haf der carpenter's kit in his
hands. He fling der hammer at Adolph, an' Adolph dodge it. He
fling der saw, an' der end of it was take a leedle bit out of
Adolph's ear. Der orang-outang grin, an' he cry out to his mates
dot he was doing peezness up on der mast. Den dose devils toss
him up everydings dey could find, an' he bombard Adolph mit der
speed of a Gatling gun. Adolph was cry. He saw dot he could not
engourage such tricks, an' he sacrificed der animal as a warning
to der others. Dot stopped dot trick mit dem. Dey pull der dead
orang up to der front of der ship an' dey cry over him an' make
faces at Adolph, den dey dump him overboard."</p>

<p>Scheibel stopped and puffed vigorously at his pipe. A Lascar
yelled a boat song as he walked down towards the water, and the
naturalist seemed to be listening.</p>

<img src="2200261h-images/TheOrangOutangFight-5.png"
style="margin-right:20%; float:right"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p>"Do I want to tell you all dot happened on der <i>Papuan
Queen?"</i> he asked, when the sound of the Lascar's song had
died away. "Dose devils take turn an' turn about to watch Adolph
to see dot he do not sleep. Do you tink he did? You was not know
der <i>Simia wurmbii</i> if you tink so. <i>Ach!</i> No! Der man
dot Delnard tell you of shust now he could doze for der leedle
while now an' den, but Adolph could not. Once he shut his eyes
for one second, an' der axe go by his head like dot. It was
fierce. An' it keep up day an' night for&mdash;How long do you
tink?"</p>

<p><i>"Gee!"</i> gasped Delnard, "I couldn't guess."</p>

<p>"Fourteen days," murmured Scheibel. "Dot was not Adolph's
reckoning, mine friendt. Adolph did not reckon der days mooch. He
was too busy keeping dem devils away. But it was der difference
in der date dot der skipper of der <i>Papuan Queen</i> gif as der
day der old tub went down, an' der time der French steamer
<i>Montlucon</i> picked her up near Chantabun in der Gulf of
Siam. Adolph was shust doing his ninedeenth fight mit der
<i>Simia wurmbii</i>, an' he was shust one mass of blood an'
bruises. You can picture dose odder fights dot I haf not told you
of. Ninedeen dere was; Adolph haf cut der notches on der wheel.
But he shipped nine of der finest specimends of der big orang
from Singapore der week after, an' den he was go back to Borneo
to trap another one to take der blace of der one who was too
fresh mit der hammer an' der saw. Dot is what I mean by der cause
dot keeps a man awake. His life? <i>Puff!</i> His life was
noddings gompared to dose specimends. No one efer saw der like of
dem. <i>Mein Gott!</i> No!"</p>

<p>Scheibel drained his glass and stood up.</p>

<p>"I was wish you all goodt night," he said, and then he turned
to the door.</p>

<p>"Say!" cried Merrin. "If you ever meet your friend, Adolph,
tell him that I think he's a very picturesque liar. Don't forget
the word. Picturesque."</p>

<p>The naturalist turned with a snort of fury.</p>

<p>"Den you are a fool!" he screamed. "See!" He tore the thin
tropical shirt from his bosom and exposed a tremendous scar
extending from the throat to the waist. He turned himself around
to the light, and his eyes blazed. "Look here! An' here! An' dis!
An' dis!"</p>

<p>He dragged up the legs of his moleskin trousers, and a cry of
horror went through the room. He had evidently been terribly
mangled at some period of his life.</p>

<p>"I am like dot all over!" he cried, as Merrin muttered an
apology. "Do you want to see more? No, it is not nice. My middle
name is Adolph. I say goodt night again."</p>

<p>He kicked the baize door open and passed out into the
darkness.</p>

<p class="first">A BOSTON Sunday newspaper had arrived in the
mail of Harrison, the tall New Englander, and Hochdorf, the
greatest naturalist in the Malay Archipelago, sniffed
suspiciously as he glanced over its pages by the light of the
slush lamp.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful how interesting some small things are to your
people," he said slowly.</p>

<p>"Small things?" snapped Harrison. "Why, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"This," said the German, tapping the sheet. "Here are five big
articles on this page, and what do you think they are about? They
are written on buried treasure, my friend."</p>

<p>"Thunderation!" cried the New Englander. "Isn't that sort of
thing interesting to any sane person? I could read that stuff for
a month on end."</p>

<p>Hochdorf tossed the paper to the floor, and the soft breeze
that came out of the jungle played with its tattered pages.</p>

<p>"Did I ever tell you of the Blind Dog of El Corib? " he asked.
"No, I did not. Throw some thing at that whining <i>mias</i> and
I will tell it to you now. It is a story of gold, and you might
like it."</p>

<p>Harrison jerked a piece of wood at the orang-outang that cried
in the darkness of the hut, and the naturalist began.</p>

<p>"This happened before I came to this infernal archipelago. A
Peninsula and Orient liner dropped me at Aden one day, and from
Aden I wandered down the east coast of Africa on stinking Italian
passenger boats. I was at that age when a man does not care which
way he goes as long as it is a new way. That is the golden age of
life. <i>Ja.</i> Those skies of brass, and those soft, tropical
nights, and that oily water, that was like ten million colored
snakes wriggling out of the way of the steamer's blunt nose, was
good to me. You bet it was. I had been cursing the smallness of
the Kaiserstrasse for many years, and when those big combers of
the Indian walloped the blistering sides of those old coasting
trollops, I yelled with joy.</p>

<p>"At Mombasa I thought I would rest for a while, and in that
dirty hole I went to work for a Greek, who was trading in ivory
and other things. There I met Lenford and Hardmann, two
Americans, who were also working for that trader, and they were
both at the age when the honk of a wild goose or the sniff of a
spring wind would send them off on a new trail. <i>Himmel!</i>
Yes. They were a pair of devils. They said that the <i>lieber
Gott</i> had given them a world to see; and if they did not see
it He might be angry with them when they had run their little
race. They were good fellows. Mombasa is not a place where you
can find many people that you would like to speak to, and I
blessed my stars for bringing me to the same place as those two
boys.</p>

<p>"That Greek trader was dealing with countrymen of his, that
lived up and down the coast, and it was one of those little
trades that roused the curiosity of those two Americans and
myself. You do not know El Corib? It is a section of filth and
fever and poverty about fifty miles from Mombasa, and a
countryman of the man that employed us lived at that patch of
iniquity. And that countryman was handing us a surprise once a
week. A mighty big surprise, too. He was sending up to Mombasa a
weekly packet of something that we did not think could be found
at El Corib.</p>

<p>"You would not expect elephant tusks to come from New York,
would you? Or you would not think it likely that crude rubber
would come from Chicago? Well, that Greek at El Corib&mdash;his
name was Poulogos, and I shall never forget that name&mdash;he
was sending up gold, and gold was something that El Corib was not
famed for. <i>Nein!</i> We did not think that there was an ounce
of gold in that village till Poulogos got busy with his weekly
shipments. And they were not little bits of gold he was sending,
my friend. They were big cakes of it: twenty-five, thirty, and
thirty-five ounce lumps of gold. The stuff had been melted in a
pot, and melted mighty roughly.</p>

<p>"Those two Americans lived with me in a big room, over the
shop of an Arab who dealt in perfumes. We wanted some perfumes to
keep out the smells of the street. <i>Ach</i>, yes! Those smells
were terrible, and in the hot nights, when we would sit and swear
at Mombasa, we would wonder over those packets of gold that the
Greek, Poulogos, was sending up from El Corib. Those packets
puzzled us. Poulogos was finding gold, and it seemed that
Poulogos was the only one that was finding it. You can guess how
that annoyed those two Americans. They had no great respect for
Greeks, and yet a Greek was beating them to it. And they belonged
to a nation that generally gets to the tape before the others
when gold is the prize.</p>

<p>"'The greasy brute must have struck a treasure box,' said
Lenford one night, as we sat cursing those smells that came up
from the narrow streets.</p>

<p>"'And he is a confounded Levantine fish peddler,' said
Hardmann. 'How far away is the place?'</p>

<p>"'Only about fifty miles,' said Lenford, 'and we might as well
go south as north.'</p>

<p>"The next day something happened that made us mighty eager to
get on the track. You have read the 'Arabian Nights,' my friend?
Well, I am thinking that all those stories are true stories. They
were scare-head yarns down in Persia, when my ancestors were
running around the Black Forest and fighting each other with the
leg bones of the hairy Aurochs. Do you remember how Mrs. Cassim
was worrying her head to find out what Mrs. Ali Baba was
measuring, and how she rubbed the fat on the bottom of the
measure? Well, we were like Mrs. Cassim; but we did not know how
to solve the puzzle; and just because we did not know how, why,
Fate took a hand.</p>

<p>"I told you that those lumps of gold were melted roughly.
Well, the one that came the morning after we had been discussing
the distance had been melted more hurriedly than any of the
others. A piece of mud was stuck to one side of the lump, and
when I knocked that piece of mud off, before putting it in the
scales, I saw that the clay had protected the design on a gold
coin, so that it was still quite plain to the eye. And when I saw
that design I nearly fell in a faint. It made me gasp and made my
limbs weak.</p>

<p>"You do not understand anything of the science of numismatics?
Well, I cannot brag over the little I know of the subject. When I
was a boy I worked for a money-changer at Sachsenhausen, and I
picked up a little knowledge of coins&mdash;just enough to make
me feel startled when I saw the design on that coin. That symbol
was an archer, kneeling upon one knee; and it struck me like a
blow in the face. Do you know why? The coin was a Daric
<i>stater</i>, named from Darius Hystaspes, the father of Xerxes.
Darius ruled over Persia five hundred years before the birth of
Christ. You might have heard of that gentleman. It was him that
the Greeks defeated at Marathon when he was trying to get a
footing in Europe.</p>

<p>"You can guess how I felt when I saw that design. And you can
guess what those two Americans thought when I told them of it in
the evening. They wanted to start down the coast that night,
which is the way of you Americans; but I made them wait till the
next day. Then we resigned our positions, hired a native boat and
set sail for El Corib. Mother o' me! they were two wild devils.
That boat had holes in it that let the Indian Ocean in on us at
the rate of a gallon a minute; but those two mad Americans would
not delay by running for the shore.</p>

<p>"It was hell. I baled till my arms were so stiff that I could
not feel them, and we raced down the coast as if seven devils
were after us. An American in a hurry is a nightmare to a German,
who has been brought up to go about business in a quiet manner.
<i>Gott!</i> Yes.</p>

<p>"We struck El Corib just as that boat was falling to pieces,
and El Corib was about the ugliest spot that I had ever seen. It
was a devil of a place. You think that Borneo is not a place to
be in, and you think that this Samarahan River is particularly
bad; but this place is a section of heaven, if you compare it to
that filthy spot below Mombasa. I dream of that place now. I
dream of its stinks, and its slime and its rottenness. It was
founded when the Phoenicians were the big noise, as you say, in
the north of Africa, and it had started to rot from the first
day. I know it was very old. There are the ruins there of a
temple built to Astarte, who was worshiped in Sidon some few
centuries before Herod came to Judea. It was built on a little
peninsula of sand, and those dirty houses seemed to be crouching
in terror, lest the waves would leap over the big red wall on the
seaward side.</p>

<p>"Those two Americans were pleased to find that place so old
and dirty. If it had been clean and new, they would have thought
I had made a mistake about the golden <i>stater.</i> To them it
looked just the place where a buried treasure would be.</p>

<p>"'It looks like a graveyard,' said Lenford; 'but it is just
the sort of place to find buried bullion in.'</p>

<p>"'Sure,' gurgled Hardmann, and that boy was so overjoyed at
the prospect of a treasure hunt that he whistled 'Yankee Doodle'
as we tramped across the sand stretch to the opening in the red
wall.</p>

<p>"We rented a little room that reeked of oil and fish, and then
we started out to find what sort of a person was this Mr.
Poulogos, who was melting down gold <i>staters</i> that were
worth ten times their weight in Berlin or New York.
<i>Himmel!</i> It made me hot when I thought of the ignorance of
the man.</p>

<p>"It was an easy hunt to find Poulogos, or, at least, to find
out all about him. We did not want to speak to him. My, no! We
only wanted to find his anchorage, so that we could follow him
round and see where he found those yellow <i>staters</i>.</p>

<p>"Poulogos was a fish peddler, and he lived in a dirty alley
that was called the Passage of Thirteen Evil Winds. I guess those
thirteen evil winds were always at home in that place, too. Our
noses told us that much. Nine out of every ten people in El Corib
had empty bellies, yet Poulogos was thought to be one of the
poorest. It made us laugh to hear that story. He peddled rock
fish for a living, and he was that thin and starved looking, that
his eyes had burrowed back into his head as if they were afraid
of seeing old Mynheer Death at one of the alley corners.</p>

<p>"'He knows his business in bluffing this batch that he is a
poor man,' said Hardmann.</p>

<p>"<i>'Ja!'</i> I said, 'if he told this mob that he was worth
three marks they would tear him to pieces!'</p>

<p>"They would, too. That mob fought for the scraps in the
streets like dogs. I have seen famine-starved Hindus that were no
worse than they.</p>

<p>"We elected Lenford our leader in that little business of
trailing Mr. Poulogos, and Lenford decided that we should work in
three shifts, so that our friend, the <i>stater</i> melter, would
always have a shadow on his heels. I did not like that spying
business, but the thought of that design of the archer kneeling
on one knee made me put my scruples aside. Those coins, I felt
sure, did not come to Poulogos in the way of business; and I
argued that if he had made a treasure find, it would not hurt him
much if an honest German and two young Americans got a few of
those ancient pieces.</p>

<p>"Trailing Poulogos was the devil of a stunt. It was so. That
Greek was playing the poverty game down to the ground. Every day
he carried his cursed fish basket into the lowest quarters of
that place.</p>

<p>"'We mustn't leave him for a minute,' said Lenford. 'When he
goes home we must sit near the doorstep till he comes out
again.'</p>

<p>"And that is what we did, my friend. There was no back door to
that place in the Passage of Thirteen Evil Winds, and when
Poulogos went inside we took care that he did not come out
without our knowledge.</p>

<p>"We were crazy to get a share in the treasure. When I
explained to Lenford and Hardmann that each one of those
<i>staters</i> was worth about five dollars, just for their gold
value, they could hardly sleep during their time off duty; and
when I told them what they could get from collectors and from
museums, they felt inclined to get hold of that greasy Greek and
shake him till he led the way to his treasure chest. You bet they
did.</p>

<p>"We shadowed Poulogos night and day for seven weeks. Not for
one minute did we let up. And it is not easy work, following a
person. I would sooner skin crocodiles than do it. <i>Ach</i>,
yes! And in a place where the smells rose up and hit you like
clenched fists it was worse than it would be in a civilized
spot.</p>

<p>"'I think he is suspicious of us,' said Lenford. 'What do you
say if we pretend to go away and then slip back on him?'</p>

<p>"<i>'Ja,'</i> I said;' that is a good plan.' That young
American was a pretty smart man.</p>

<p>"That night we got into an old <i>dhow</i> that we had
purchased and slipped down the coast; but we did not go far. We
beached her about fifteen miles down the coast; then we took off
our clothes, stained our faces, put on tattered burnooses and
started back to El Corib. We were going to try a surprise on
Mynheer Poulogos.</p>

<p>"It was a devil of a tramp to that place. The swamps along the
coast made me think that it would be best to go back to the
<i>dhow</i> and go up to Mombasa, but those two Americans would
not listen. They knew that Poulogos had a little secret of his
own, and they had made up their minds to get that secret. The
American, is a devil when he sets his mind on doing a thing. Now,
the German is a philosopher. If he finds that the difficulties
are too great, he will light his pipe and forget all about it.
With the American it is different, much different.</p>

<p>"I was tired of treasure hunting, when we saw the lights of
that stinking town show up through the fever mists that made my
bones ache. I could not speak the Arab lingo, and I was thinking
that I would get a knife in the ribs before I was finished with
that business. You bet I did. But those boys were as merry as
crickets, as they splashed through the mud.</p>

<p>"'I bet he makes for the plant as soon as he finds out that we
have jumped the burg,' said Lenford. 'We'll go down to his camp
in the Passage of Thirteen Evil Winds and see if he is at
home.'</p>

<p>"It was midnight then, and it was so dark in those alleys that
we felt that we were choking. We were feeling our way with our
hands and with our feet as well. All the filth of that place was
tossed out into the middle of the alleys, and Hardmann and I made
some nice somersaults as we followed Lenford. And we could not
swear. It is dangerous to swear in either English or German, when
you have a burnoose over your head. <i>Gott!</i> Yes!</p>

<p>"We had reached the top of the passage where the Greek lived,
when Lenford, who was leading, sprang into a dark doorway, and we
hurried after him. We moved mighty quick at that moment. Someone
was coming up the alley, and a spear of light that came through
the broken shutter of an Arab caf had let Lenford see who that
someone was. It was Poulogos the Greek. It was so.</p>

<p>"He was hurrying like the devil, and the moment he passed us
by, we turned and followed him. You can bet we did. We had the
feeling that he was on some important business. We had&mdash;what
is the word you Americans use? <i>Ach!</i> Yes! A hunch! Well, we
had a hunch as we sneaked after that fish peddler.</p>

<p>"That was some tracking business. In and out of that cursed
network of lanes we went, till we were so tired that when we fell
we hardly had the strength to get up again. It was a mad night.
We went through all sorts of places. Once a big brute of a negro
jumped upon Lenford, but that youngster floored him with a punch
on the chin, and went on after the Greek as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>"After a long time we came out on the strip of sand in front
of the red stone wall. The Greek was in front of us, dodging in
and out of the shadows. We were breathing mighty hard just then.
The fish peddler was acting as if he wanted to make sure that no
one was on his trail, and we were certain that he did not know we
were behind.</p>

<p>"Presently he dived into a patch of shadow near the wall, and
we stopped and waited. We waited an hour, but he did not come out
of that shadow. He did not. And we were certain that he did not
climb the wall. He was somewhere in the dark near the wall, and
we wondered what he was doing there.</p>

<p>"'I'll go and see,' whispered Lenford. 'I will walk slowly by
and he will think I am a fisherman from the shore.'</p>

<p>"Lenford walked by the place that the Greek was hiding in;
then he turned and rushed back to us in a hurry. 'He has gone!'
he said. 'The greasy beggar has walked into the wall.'</p>

<p>"That was about the only solution to that business. Poulogos
had walked into the wall. <i>Ja!</i> He could not have got over
it, and we had watched to see that he did not come out of the
patch of shadow. And we could find no opening in that wall. Not
one. Hardmann had a dark-lantern that we had brought from
Mombasa, and with it we examined that stone barrier. It was an
old wall, but it had been well built. You bet it had. In one
place there was an inscription in raised letters, and I puzzled
those Arabic characters out by the light of the lamp. The two
lines read something like this:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Blessed be Allah! Remember his word,<br>

And the Blind Dog that watches will never be stirred.</p>

<br>

<p>"'What does that mean?' asked Hardmann.</p>

<p>"'The Lord only knows,' growled Lenford. 'We want to find that
Greek instead of worrying our heads with riddles on the
wall.'</p>

<p>"We went up and down that red wall for about an hour, and just
as we were beginning to think that Poulogos had slipped us,
something happened. It did so. Hardmann pulled us back into the
shadow, and when we stared at the point he pointed to, we saw
that Greek walk out of the wall. <i>Himmel!</i> It gave us a
start. We had been examining that wall for an hour, and we could
not find a hole big enough for a fat lizard to crawl into. Not
one!</p>

<p>"I could feel Lenford's muscles stiffen as he watched
Poulogos, who was standing still and looking around him to see if
anyone was about. Those two Americans saw Broadway and the gay
cafs and the pretty women on the avenues when they saw Poulogos
come out of the wall.</p>

<p>"The Greek stood still for about a minute; then he seemed
satisfied that he was not followed, and he slipped away into the
night. We moved mighty quick the moment he disappeared. My, yes!
We moved for the spot where he had appeared, but we got a
disappointment when we got there. There was no opening! Not a
sign of one. There was the red wall, and just at the spot where
we thought Poulogos came through, was the inscription about Allah
and the Blind Dog, that we had read a little while before.</p>

<p>"'But there must be an opening,' whispered Lenford. 'Let us
feel for a spring or a hinge.'</p>

<p>"We started to feel that wall mighty good. We rubbed it up and
down till our fingers were bleeding, and we damned that fish
peddler as we rubbed. We knew that we were close to the secret
place where those golden <i>staters</i> of Darius Hystaspes were
hidden, but we could not get in. And just then a wonderful thing
took place. Yes, a mighty wonderful thing! Lenford put his hand
on the first Arabic character of the word <i>Allah</i> in that
inscription, and we gave a gurgle when he did that. A slab of
stone, about three feet square, swung back, and when Lenford
thrust the lantern into the opening we looked with popping
eyes.</p>

<p>"There were steps leading from that opening, steps that were
wet and slimy. Do you know that the soles of my feet can feel
those steps now, and it is some years since I went down them? Do
you think that strange? You will not think so after I tell you
what happened in that place. But they were so slimy that it was
like treading on the oily body of a native or a snake. The
centuries had covered those stones with wet moss that seemed to
feel unclean under one's shoes. Yes, I can feel the sensation now
in my feet as I think about the two hundred steps that led to the
bottom. We were crazy as we raced down those steps. The seven
weeks of waiting had made us mad, and we did not stop to think of
anything.</p>

<p>"We got to the bottom at last, and we found ourselves in a
bare cavern that had stalactites hanging from the roof. And when
Lenford held up the lantern to have a look at the roof we got our
first glimpse of the Blind Dog of El Corib. <i>Ja! Ja!</i> I
would give my year's salary, and that is ten thousand marks, if I
could blot that beast out of my mind. I would so.</p>

<p>"He was a monster dog, carved out of stone, and he was bigger
than the elephants in front of the Temple of Bora. He was a
tremendous size, and as we stared at the monster we saw why the
inscription on the wall had alluded to him as the Blind Dog. You
have seen the picture of Justice with the bandage over her eyes?
Well, that dog had a stone bandage over his eyes.</p>

<p>"The Blind Dog stood at one side of the cavern, and beneath
one of its upraised paws there was a passage that led to an
adjoining cave. And, as there was nothing in the cavern that we
were in, we made for that passage. Lenford went through first;
then Hardmann, and I crawled through last. I got to my feet, and
then I looked&mdash;<i>Gott!</i> Sometimes I think of that night
and wonder if it was a dream. I wish it was, my friend.</p>

<p>"In the Hohenzollern Museum at Berlin there is a gold
<i>stater</i>&mdash; a Daric <i>stater</i>, in a glass case. The
curator of that museum showed it to me. If I went back there
tomorrow and told that old man that I had seen a million Daric
<i>staters</i>, he would think that I was mad. He would laugh at
me. But I saw them! A million? I saw five million of them! That
curator would have me arrested if I told him that. He would so.
The most exciting thing in his life is his Sunday walk in the
Tiergarten, so he would not believe. He could not be expected to.
Belief, my friend, is like a liking for caviar&mdash;one must be
trained to it.</p>

<p>"We fell on those piles of coins like wolves. There were a
dozen sacks lying about, sacks made out of palm leaf fiber, and
into those sacks we scooped the coins that were over twenty
centuries old. They were coined before Marathon, before Miltiades
swept the Persians into the sea at Vrana! I do not know how they
came to that spot. The Phoenicians, and the Medes, and the
Assyrians, went down that way after myrrh and balsam and jasper,
when they had few historians about. That is so. And I guess that
some big man in those days had a little private bank in that
wall. <i>Himmel!</i> It makes my eyes water to think now of that
place and what was in it.</p>

<p>"I don't think we spoke while we were scooping the coins into
the sacks. We just made noises like beasts. Gold is the devil of
a thing. It makes a man worse than the animals.</p>

<p>"Hardmann got his sack full, and he lifted it up in his arms.
Would you believe if I told you how much gold he had? Of course
you would believe. I am not telling this story for fun. He had a
hundred pounds or more! Yes!</p>

<p>"'I'm ready,' he said. 'Come on.'</p>

<p>"Lenford stood up and picked up the lantern, and Hardmann
staggered forward towards the opening beneath the paw of the
Blind Dog. I see him in my dreams as I saw him then. I do. I see
the big black shadows that danced around as Lenford swung the
lantern; I see the wet walls of the place and the piles of gold
we were leaving. But I see Hardmann most of all. I shall see him
in my dreams till I die. Mother o' me! Yes!</p>

<p>"That boy stooped to go through that passage beneath the
upraised paw of the Blind Dog. I saw him stoop; then&mdash;why,
he was gone! Have you ever seen a fly crushed by a sledge? Well,
that is what happened. That stone paw came down with a force that
was tremendous, and before it had lifted again, we were listening
to the noise made by the gold coins as they hit against the rock
walls of the place. Hardmann's coins, mind you! The bag on his
back had just missed the paw as it smashed against the body of
the big carving. There was no Hardmann there. That is, there was
nothing there that I would like to think was Hardmann. No, there
was not!</p>

<p>"At the moment that the paw struck that boy I thought I heard
a laugh that came from the other cavern, and Lenford thought so,
too. He was paralyzed for a minute; then he made a spring at the
passage. But I gripped him by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"'Stop!'I cried. <i>'Stop!'</i></p>

<p>"'There is someone out there!' he screamed. 'Let me go!'</p>

<p>"'Drop the gold!' I shouted. 'Drop the gold! Don't you see
that it is the extra weight on the stone beneath the paw that has
caused Hardmann's death?'</p>

<p>"Have you ever noticed how a lot of small things will be
welded together in an instant? In the instant that I witnessed,
that tremendous stone crash down on that boy, I understood why it
was that the gold was sent up to Mombasa in small lumps. I
understood the meaning of the inscription, too. You bet I did.
The Blind Dog was the watcher of that gold. Poulogos, the Greek,
knew that you could not steal a sackful of that metal, because
the stone beneath the paw was so fixed that it would stand the
weight of a man, but not the weight of a man and a bag of coin.
That is why the Greek stole in small amounts. Perhaps some friend
of that fish peddler had met such a death as Hardmann had
met.</p>

<p>"'Drop the gold!' I roared. 'Throw it on the floor!'</p>

<p>"Lenford was so horrified at what had happened that he did not
understand what I meant for a few seconds; then he flung the gold
on the floor and sprang at the opening. He was game, game as the
best of them. The paw was back in its old place then, and I
watched him with staring eyes. I was wondering if my theory of
the action of that murderous stone hammer was the right one.</p>

<p>"I was right. The boy went through, and the next moment I
heard his revolver in the outer cave; and I dived through that
passage and caught up to him. Up the wet, slimy steps we went
side by side, and in front of us in the darkness we heard someone
running&mdash;running mighty fast. My skin told me who that
someone was. Poulogos had come back again, and he had just
reached the outer cave in time to see Hardmann killed. And the
devil had laughed at that happening. Laughed at it! You can guess
how Lenford felt as he blazed away with his gun. He was insane.
He wanted to kill that Greek. And I wanted to kill him, too. I
was sick from the sight I had seen, and I wanted to do something
to get even with the stone thing in the cave.</p>

<p>"Lenford got close to Poulogos as we reached the top of the
stairs, and the boy fired again. That shot saved our life. It
must have wounded the Greek. He let out a yell and bounded
through the opening in the wall, and he was that scared that he
would not stop to slam that slab on us. If he had fastened it we
would have been prisoners with the Blind Dog and the
<i>staters</i> and&mdash;and the memory of Hardmann.</p>

<p>"Poulogos fled down the path leading to the marshes at the
back of that cursed place, and we went after him. We were crazy
men. My, yes! We ran through that thick night after the figure
that was in front of us, and we thought of nothing else but the
killing of that man. On and on we went. I don't know how far we
ran. It must have been leagues. And always in front of us was a
phantom we thought was Poulogos. Yes, it must have been a
phantom. When the dawn sprang out of the east we found ourselves
in a swamp miles away from El Corib, and there was no sign of the
Greek. That hyena had dodged us in the darkness. Mind you, we did
not think that Poulogos had anything to do with the death of
Hardmann. <i>Nein.</i> But he had laughed when the paw of the
Blind Dog crushed the boy, and you would have killed your own
father if he had laughed at that moment.</p>

<p>"We were three days fighting our way back to El Corib. I don't
remember what we lived on, and I don't remember what we said to
each other. When we reached the hell-hole we were nearly insane
with the want of food and with the bites of insects. And our
clothes were in tatters. My, yes! We were the two sorry looking
specimens as we crawled back to that place.</p>

<p>"We went round toward the wall, and Lenford held his revolver
in his hand as we approached it. That boy had grown old in a
night, His jaw stuck out, and his mouth was a gray line.</p>

<p>"'I will stand guard at the opening, and you will go down and
see,' he said. 'I am going to bury Slim if I shoot the town
up.'</p>

<p>"I was going to tell the boy that there was little there to
bury, but I said nothing. Side by side we tramped along, and an
occasional Arab that we passed would stand and look at us. We
were the only two white men in that town, and we must have looked
strange with our tattered burnooses.</p>

<p>"We reached the wall at last, and then we stood and stared at
each other. The inscription that mentioned Allah and the Blind
Dog had been chiseled off, and the wall had been covered with a
coat of thick red paint so that it was impossible to find where
it had been! That was what met us in that fever-smitten place.
Wasn't it enough to drive us mad?</p>

<p>"All through that day we fingered the wall. We did so. Arabs
and negroes came and stared at us, but we took no notice. Our
fingers were bleeding, but we kept at it.</p>

<p>"'Lenford,' I said, when the night came down on us thick and
lonely, 'I am full up of it. I am going away from this cursed
place. Come; we will get a boat and go up the coast.'</p>

<p>"'Not me,' he snapped. 'I am going to get into that place if
it takes me ten years.'</p>

<p>"'Come; don't be a fool,' I said. 'Come with me.'</p>

<p>"'Go by yourself,' he shrieked. 'Do you think I would let a
Greek beat me to it? I will stay till I get into this hole and do
things that I want to do.'</p>

<p>"I tried to dissuade him, but it was no use. And
I was nearly insane. <i>Himmel!</i> Wasn't I sick of that
place. I remember that I staggered down to the water, stole a
boat and pulled into the night. I kept pulling till dawn, then an
Italian freight steamer sighted me and picked me up. I was in bed
for three days; then they put me ashore at Dar-es-Salam."</p>

<p>Hochdorf stopped speaking, and the only sound that disturbed
the silence was the rustling of the Boston newspaper as the
breeze played with its tattered pages.</p>

<p>Presently the tall New Englander spoke. "And Lenford?" he
asked. "Did you&mdash;did you ever hear how he got on?"</p>

<p>The German naturalist stepped into the bungalow and returned
with a small camphor-wood box in his hands. He dragged the slush
lamp closer, trimmed the wick; then he opened the lid of the box.
Inside, reposing on a piece of cotton wool, were ten gold coins,
and on the face of four we saw the design of the archer on bended
knee.</p>

<p>"Lenford sent me those fourteen months after the night I left
him in El Corib," said the naturalist gently. "He sent them in
care of my father in Frankfort, and he sent them to me. They are
my most treasured possessions, my friend. That boy made good.
<i>Gott!</i> yes! Every day I drink to his health. With those ten
Daric <i>staters</i> was a little note. It said: 'From Lenford,
on his way to Broadway.' That was all. Wasn't he a hellfire boy?
I don't know how much he got, but I bet he took his own share and
the share that belonged to Hardmann. I bet he did. Fill up my
glass and I will drink his health again. He was a great boy."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">HOCHDORF, prince of animal collectors, laughed
softly when I put my question. I had asked for proof of a jungle
story, and the query brought a chuckle that had the razor edge of
a <i>parang</i>.</p>

<p>"Proof?" he cried. "Why, you find proof in the atmosphere
after you come through Bab-el-Mandeb. That is, if you have a
receptive cuticle. <i>Ja!</i> Sometimes I am in want of proof
myself, and then I use my skin. That is so. I ask of it a
question, and it gives me all the proof I want in quick time.
Don't you feel the night fingering your face? And are not the
trees listening? And is there not something in the air that
strips your soul so that your first love affair comes up before
your eyes? That is the feel of Asia, my friend, and it proves a
lot of things. There is no atmosphere in the world like this.
<i>Nein!</i> And it is worse than the poppy habit&mdash;you
cannot get away from it. Sixteen years ago I went back to
Germany, and Borneo came after me in the nights. My, yes! It
fished for my soul in my dreams&mdash; fished for it with a net
that was all crimson and lilac, and shot-gold and peacock blue,
and in the morning I would be weak from the fight. I could not
stand that struggle. Not I. In six weeks from the day I landed in
Amsterdam, I was pounding down the Red Sea on the old
<i>Valetta</i>, of the Peninsula and Oriental line, and my nose
was sniffing at the east wind. <i>Ach!</i> Yes."</p>

<p>In the hot, punkah-lashed air of the nipa-palm thatched
bungalow the odors fought for supremacy. The smell of the jungle
rolled in boldly on the strange little puffs of air that the
Orang-Laut call "the breath of God;" the sour stench of the
black slime on the river bank formed an under stratum that
advanced furtively, and to combat these two invaders, a
penetrating odor came from the cages in the adjoining hut, where
the German's prisoners, monkeys and tiger cats, orang-outangs and
serpents, snuffled and moaned, snarled and hissed in the velvety
darkness.</p>

<p>"Are you sleepy?" asked Hochdorf.</p>

<p>"Never less so," I answered.</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you a story if you do not ask for proof," he
said quietly. "Proof? Ho, ho! I have given up looking for proof.
To the East everything is possible, and that is why the East will
live. It expects, my friend, and expectation is soul.</p>

<p>"You have never heard of the False Buddha of Paknam? Well,
there are thousands that lived within one hundred miles of him
that never heard of him. But he was something out of the common.
Much out of the common. He was a Laos priest from the head of the
Me Ping River, and he took himself mighty seriously. He reckoned
that he was the reincarnated Gautama, and he created a little
flurry from Bangkok down to Singapore. A pretty big flurry when I
come to think about it. The East is always waiting for something
to happen, and that makes it easy for a fakir. <i>Ja.</i> He can
get a following before their excitement wears down so thin that
the knife analysis comes through. That is so.</p>

<p>"I was gathering specimens on the Telubin River in the
southern part of the Malay peninsula, and I wanted to go to
Bangkok. And that is how I met Bruden. He owned <i>The Red
Spider</i>, a bull-nosed schooner that was going up the Gulf of
Siam, and I took a passage on her. If ever a fiend came on earth
to cool his skin it was Bruden. You can laugh, but I mean it. He
stood six-feet-four; he weighed two hundred pounds, and he had no
more morals than a hammerhead shark. And a hammerhead will bite
the tail off its own mother.</p>

<p>"Up to the day of sailing I was the only passenger. Then there
was a rush. <i>Ja!</i> There was a big rush. Five score disciples
of the False Buddha of Paknam had been gathered up along the
coast, and Bruden gave them deck passage up the Gulf. When they
came aboard I got my first look at the golden woman of Kelantan.
She was the one who had gathered up the bunch. That is so. She
was some relation to the False Buddha. Some said she was his
sister, some said she was his daughter, but I think she was his
wife. I am sure she was his wife. The Gautama stunt was one that
she, being a woman, could not play, so she put him to the front.
She was not the first woman of brains who has stood behind a mate
who did not have a big share of gray matter in his skull.</p>

<p>"Never have I seen a colored woman like her. Never! I could
not make your eyes see her if I talked to you all night. There
are some things that the brushes of imagination cannot paint, and
that woman was beyond imagination. She was that. Just now I would
give a thousand marks to know her breeding. And I would give a
thousand marks to know where she had got her golden skin and her
eyes that were deeper than the Tengpeng Well. I would so. She was
not Malay or Negrito, Siamese or Shan Burman or Karen. She was
something different, <i>ja!</i> very different. I have never seen
a brown woman with a hundredth part of her beauty. She was like
Van Eyck's Madonna del Lucca that was in the Stadel at Frankfort
when I was a boy. She was wrapped in a <i>sarong</i> of
rose-colored silk that looked as if it had come out of the vat in
which the dawn clouds are tinted. It was figured all over with
the wanderings of Buddha that were worked in threads of silver
and gold, and it was caught up with a brooch of Burmese jade. Her
bare arms and ankles were ringed with bracelets of hammered
silver, and these bracelets looked as if they had been old when
Tamerlane came riding into the Punjab. <i>Mein Gott!</i> she was
a wonder woman!</p>

<p>"Have you ever pigeon-holed people that you have met with
people that you have never met? Well, I pigeon-holed that woman
with her golden skin, and her rounded limbs and her
ten-thousand-fathom-deep eyes. I put her with Sappho of Lesbos,
with Helen, with Hypatia, and Saint Monica. She was a flame. That
is so. She was a flame that could make that bunch of pilgrims
blaze like the very devil when she got going.</p>

<p>"Bruden came into collision with her before we had the anchor
up. <i>Himmel!</i> Yes! He had not seen her when she came aboard,
but just as <i>The Red Spider</i> started to butt her way into
the open sea, he saw something of her that made him splutter. One
of her five score recruits took it into his thick head to fall on
his knees as Bruden was running across the deck, and the big
skipper tripped over him and nearly broke his neck. You can guess
how that brute felt when he got to his feet. He was mad clean
through. He sprang at that nigger and he kicked him till he
jerked yells into space that were like hot wires. Bruden was a
devil&mdash;a devil of devils.</p>

<p>"The golden woman was at the other end of the ship when she
heard the first yell, but she got to the spot before the other
pilgrims had sensed what was wrong. She was an unleashed fury
just then. You bet she was. But she was beautiful in her temper.
Flames of Gehenna! Yes! Her eyes blazed like the eyes of a Bengal
tiger, and her face was like a drawn blade.</p>

<p>"As she faced Bruden I noticed her bare left foot, and I saw
that the second toe was missing. Afterwards I learned that she
had been bitten by a <i>krait</i> while recruiting that mob, and
that she had coolly ordered one of the niggers to chop her toe
off. I believe it. I would believe anything of her. But that
little defect was the only blemish in her beauty. In her beauty,
mind you. I have been out here six and twenty years come next
October, and never have I seen a brown woman who was more
beautiful. She had all the witchery of Asia, the witchery that
you can sniff in the dawn air, and in the swooning noondays and
the velvety nights&mdash;she had it in herself.</p>

<p>"Bruden looked at her when she came blazing down on him, and I
could see that she had made an impression. You bet she had! He
opened his bleary eyes when she flung a shower of questions at
him, and for quite two minutes he could not speak. Mission bred
she was, and she spoke English without an accent.</p>

<p>"'What do you mean by kicking that man?' she cried. 'How dare
you?'</p>

<p>"'He dropped down in front of me and I fell over him,' snarled
Bruden.</p>

<p>"'But you had no right to kick him!' screamed the woman.</p>

<p>"'And he had no right to trip me,' roared Bruden. 'If he wants
to kneel down and slam his wishbone to please old Budd he must
not do it in front of me when I am running.'</p>

<p>"'You are a low brute!' said the golden woman.</p>

<p>"I think it was the way she said it that pleased Bruden. I
think so. It was seldom that anyone had enough grit in them to
fire a verbal bomb at him. Not much. When he got mad he was like
a hooded snake, and men and women got out of his way. If he
kicked a nigger the nigger made for what you call the tall timber
pretty damn quick, but that woman was different from all the
people that Bruden had ever met. She did not care ten
<i>Pfennigs</i> for him, and she let him see she did not.</p>

<p>"'I am a brute, am I?' he growled.</p>

<p>"'A low brute!' she hissed. 'You have maimed that man.'</p>

<p>"'That is nothing,' snapped Bruden. 'I have maimed dozens, and
I have forgotten about them ten minutes afterwards.'</p>

<p>"'You fiend!' cried the golden woman. 'It is a wonder that you
are allowed to defile the sweet earth!'</p>

<p>"She put her shining arms under that dirty Malay when she said
that, and helped him up into the shadow of the galley, leaving
that big brute of a skipper to stare after her as if he were
hypnotized. She had handed him something that staggered him for a
minute or two. Ho, ho, yes!</p>

<p>"Every time he came on deck after that he looked in her
direction, and she glared back at him like a wounded <i>mias.</i>
I wished myself on any other boat but <i>The Red Spider</i> when
I saw that devil's face. My, yes! He was as strong as ten men,
and I told you that he had no more morals than a hammerhead
shark. He had less. And he thought that his strength could get
him anything. Do you understand? There were no ten men on that
boat that could fight with him. No, nor twenty men. There is an
anchor at the Victoria Docks at Singapore that Bruden carried.
<i>Ja.</i> No five men can move it. I heard of that anchor when I
went down to Penang from Bangkok. He was a big, fierce devil, and
he looked at that woman with the eyes of a cheetah watching a
muntjak. And every man on that boat understood his look. Out in
this part of the world there is no need to tell people things.
They feel them. That is, all people except the English. That is
why the English rule. If they had the receptive cuticle they
would have vacated India the day after they grabbed it. I tell
you that because I have sat here for six and twenty years with
this atmosphere feeling my face as it is doing tonight.</p>

<p>"Those five score pilgrims felt what I felt. <i>Mein Gott!</i>
Yes! They saw the look on that brute's face, and they knew that
the hate in the woman's eyes would only make him more determined.
I could not tell you enough about Bruden to let you know what he
was. I could not. There were no laws for him. <i>Nein!</i> He was
one of those primitive brutes that you find on the rim of the
earth. In a city he would have been hanged mighty quick, but out
here&mdash;Well, Justice is a fat <i>Frau</i>, and the likes of
Bruden are left to the judgment of the <i>lieber Gott.</i> That
is all I know.</p>

<p>"He looked at that woman in a way that turned me sick. And it
turned those pilgrims pretty sick, too. They found that they had
shipped with a demon, and their eyes sent out hate sparks
every time Bruden crossed the deck. They looked to me like five
score cobras that were waiting to sting a big, tawny tiger who
treated them with contempt.</p>

<p>"That golden woman held a prayer meeting when <i>The Red
Spider</i> was well to sea, and the way she handled that batch
was a revelation. My, yes! It was uncanny. She had psychic force.
I told you that she was a flame. Well, she was. She worked on
that batch till she slammed fire-crackers and rockets out of
them. They were drunk with their own emotions, and when she
chanted to them in the Malay dialect they saw scaling ladders
going right up to the door of their own particular heaven. All
your little revivalist speakers were small cakes compared to her.
I know what I am saying. When she finished they would have jumped
overboard if she held up one of her shapely fingers, and I got a
creepy feeling in my skin. I did so. It did not require much
intuition to smell trouble on that boat. No, it did not.</p>

<p>"All the damn riffraff of half-castes, beachcombers, and
beach-bummers that Bruden had for a crew, were impressed by that
performance, but it did not impress the big skipper. His skin was
too thick. He only saw a woman who was more beautiful than the
Lorelei, and he was not afraid. It is the fools who have not the
<i>antennae</i> to feel danger who are considered brave. Somebody
has said that a coward is a man who sees a little farther than
his fellows, and that is right. I was with Prince Friederich
Charles at Spichern, and I know. Bruden could not feel danger.
His skin was thicker than the pelt of a Ganges gavial.</p>

<p>"After that prayer stunt he went up to the woman and tried to
talk to her. <i>Ach!</i> If looks could have killed him she would
have killed him ten times while he was walking towards her. She
had bayonets in her eyes, but he laughed at her when she tried to
glare him off.</p>

<p>"'Am I still a fiend, pretty one?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'I do not wish to speak to you,' she answered.</p>

<p>"'Say that I am not a fiend,' he said, grinning at her like a
baboon.</p>

<p>"'You are a fiend!' she cried. 'Go away. I do not wish to
speak to you!'</p>

<p>"'But I wish to speak to you,' grinned Bruden. 'This is my
ship, and I guess I can speak to passengers if I like.'</p>

<p>"That big brute had no respect for man or woman. He had no
respect for God. That is so. He was a cave-man who thought that
muscles were everything. He turned me sick just then. That woman
started to walk away, and he put out his big hand that was like
the claw of a gorilla, and he gripped her bare arm.</p>

<p>"'I want to say a word to you,' he said. 'I have a little
proposition to make that is better than chanting to old
Budd.'</p>

<p>"She turned with the swiftness of a rock snake and struck him
in the face with her open hand, and then hell broke loose on that
deck. That bunch of long-haired pilgrims came at Bruden like
wolves. <i>Himmel!</i> Yes! They had been waiting for that
moment, but they did not know what a devil they were up against.
No, they did not. If they thought it was going to be an easy
fight they were mistaken. <i>Ja!</i> Bruden turned around in time
to escape a drive from a <i>kris</i> that a lean Malay made at
his back, and the next moment he had gripped the wrists of the
<i>kris</i> man and was whirling him round and round his head.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>"I told you that he was as strong as a bull elephant, did I
not? Well, he used that skinny-legged nigger as a club, and he
knocked down half a dozen of the mob every time he swung him
around. I think that devil was itching for a fight like that,
<i>ja!</i> He howled like a gray wolf as he twirled that Malay
like a piece of teakwood. That is so. He was enjoying it like I
would enjoy a glass of iced lager. That circle of insane niggers
rushed round and round him, but every time that they tried to
clinch with him it was smash, crash, bang. It was frightful. I am
not a baby, but that deck made all my nerves as tight as the
backstays. Not one of the crew made an attempt to help Bruden.
That demon did not want help. It was fun to him to smash up those
poor wretches. It was great fun. When he was tired of it he just
fought his way to the companion stairs, flung the senseless
nigger at them with a laugh and went below to his cabin.</p>

<p>"They did not make an attempt to follow him down. Not they. He
had taken all the fight out of them at that moment. They stood
around chattering like so many <i>wah-wahs</i> till the golden
woman ordered them to look after the half score that Bruden had
injured. It was nice, wasn't it? One has to stay with his color
in the East, white with white, and black with black, but I
fingered my revolver just then. Yes, I did so. I wondered what
was coming in the days that lay between us and Bangkok. You bet I
did. I knew that the business had only started as far as Bruden
was concerned.</p>

<p>"The mate of <i>The Red Spider</i>, a flat-faced animal who
had a Maori father and a white mother, thought the same as I did.
He edged up close to me when the chatter of the niggers had
stopped, and he told me his opinion. He smelt trouble&mdash;tons
of trouble. He was half native, and his skin was helping his
eyes.</p>

<p>"'Skipper better leave the woman alone,' he said. 'Think
mighty dangerous business.'</p>

<p><i>"'Ja!'</i> I said.</p>

<p>"'She mighty smart witch-woman,' he grunted. 'She put whole
ship on the blink.'</p>

<p>"I felt that she would put Bruden on the blink if he did not
watch out. I did that same. I did not know how the danger would
come, but I thought that the fool was playing with fire. That
woman was not the sort that Bruden was in the habit of speaking
to. Not much. She was as far removed from him as the Zuyder Zee
is from the Run of Cutch. She was not an ordinary woman at all. I
did not care if she was recruiting for a fakir; that was nothing
to do with it. But I knew that she was a good woman, and that was
enough for me to know. <i>Ja</i>, I knew that. She was a woman
who could not be anything else but good. And that big, ugly fool
thought that he could do what he liked just because he was the
skipper of a blamed old bull-nosed schooner. I have seen others
like him. They have thick skins and no imagination. They forget
that this Asia is so old that it comes out against you like a
clenched fist if you do anything that it disapproves of. It has a
personality, my friend, that is what it has. I have seen fools
knocked off their legs in this quarter. <i>Mein Gott!</i> Yes! I
knew that I was a fool to take a passage with that pig of a
skipper. You bet I did.</p>

<p>"'They will kill him,' said the Maori mate.</p>

<p>"'I hope they do,' I snapped.</p>

<p>"I stood on the deck and watched the oily water that looked
like a million colored snakes, and I sniffed the smell of Asia as
it came out to me on the breeze. That golden woman seemed to be
as old as Asia&mdash;not in years but in wisdom. She was
something that seemed to be gifted with perpetual youth. That is
so. She did not look to be more than five and twenty, but those
eyes of hers were as old as the crystalline rocks of Cape
Comorin.</p>

<p>"Bruden came up on deck early in the afternoon, and he yawned
and stretched himself like a lazy tiger. Half of that batch of
pilgrims were lying full length on the deck, but the moment they
saw him they moved towards the spot where the woman was sitting.
And that made Bruden laugh. He took it to be a compliment to
himself. That is so. He laughed so loud you could hear him a mile
away. He was a stupid, big fool.</p>

<p>"'Ho, ho!' he cried. 'Do not be afraid of me, my little brown
pets. I will not hurt your beautiful princess. Not me. I am as
gentle as a wood dove in the springtime.'</p>

<p>"He walked across the deck to where they were gathered in a
bunch that looked as ugly as a nest of scorpions. The golden
woman was in the middle of them, and when Bruden came close she
spoke.</p>

<p>"'Keep away,' she said to him quietly. 'I do not wish you to
come near me.'</p>

<p>"'But I like you,' grinned Bruden. 'Holy St. Christopher!
can't the skipper of a boat flirt a little with his star
passenger?'</p>

<p>"'Keep off,' she said. 'It will be better for you to go away
and leave me alone.'</p>

<p>"'Not it!' cried Bruden. 'I like you, woman. It's a fact!
You're the loveliest brown woman between the Choi Bazar and
Yellow Dick's at Hakodate.'</p>

<p>"He tried to push in near her, and that batch sprang at him
again. <i>Ja!</i> They came at him like mad dogs, and in a minute
he was fighting again.</p>

<p>"And the brute loved a fight. He did so. He laughed like a
madman as his big fists, that were larger than the hams that come
out of Westphalia, knocked down those rice-fed wretches like
ninepins. He was a fiend for sure. He battered them till they
squealed, and they broke and ran from him like the cuirassiers
did at Sadowa.</p>

<p>"Suddenly Bruden stopped and glared around the deck. I looked
around, too. You bet I did. The golden woman was not in sight.
She had disappeared while he was fighting!</p>

<p>"Bruden dashed across the deck and let out a yell. 'Where did
she go?' he cried. 'Where the mischief has she got to?'</p>

<p>"The pilgrims did not speak, and you can bet <i>I</i> did not.
He turned to the Maori mate and roared his question again, but
the mate shook his woolly head. And I had not seen where she had
gone, and neither did the mate. No, my friend. That woman seemed
to have melted from in front of our eyes, and at first I thought
she had dropped overboard. But I did not think that for long. The
faces of those pilgrims put that notion out of my mind. They were
watching Bruden, and they were very quiet. They would not have
been so quiet if she had gone over. Not them. They would have
clinched with that demon mighty quick.</p>

<p>"Bruden turned to the mate and he cursed like an Afghan horse
dealer. <i>Gott!</i> didn't he curse? He damned everything within
sight, and he kicked like a madman at every nigger that came
within range of his big sea boots.</p>

<p>"'Search the boat!' he yelled. 'I want to speak to her! Find
her, you hounds! Find her!'</p>

<p>"The mate set the rest of the crew hunting for that woman, and
I waited with a pretty sick feeling in my insides. That is so. If
I have ever seen a fiend it was Bruden. He was mad. He rushed
around shouting out orders till he was hoarse. And all the time
he rushed around and roared, those five score Malays crouched on
the deck and sprayed him with their hate. That is it. They
sprayed him with the hate that they had in their eyes.</p>

<p>"I could not tell if they were afraid that she would be found.
No, I could not. There are not many hiding places on a schooner,
but that mob had the stoicism of the East, and their faces told
me only of the hate they felt for the big brute who was harrying
the woman. That hate was mighty plain. <i>Ach</i>, yes!</p>

<p>"When the night rolled down on <i>The Red Spider</i> they were
still searching for the woman. They had searched the schooner
from end to end, and they had searched in vain. And that was a
miracle. Don't you think so? I thought it was at the time, and I
have been thinking so ever since. In some things the English are
wise. They say that they do not want to understand the East.
<i>Gott im Himmel!</i> They say that they only want to rule. It
is funny, is it not? The East makes my brain dizzy when I think
of making an attempt to understand it. I am blind and deaf before
it. That is so.</p>

<p>"But that search made me sick. To see that big brute rushing
round the deck made my skin creep. Sometimes my fingers curled
themselves around my revolver, and I would have to tear them
away. The five score pilgrims in the white wrappers said nothing.
Not a word. They just huddled themselves together and used their
eyes only. They were hating Bruden with every ounce of soul
pressure. You could feel it well out from them. It came out like
a wave, but that brute did not feel it. He had a thick skin, and
he could not feel anything.</p>

<p>"When the moon came up, one of the pilgrims stepped out from
the bunch and handed Bruden a little wooden box.</p>

<p>"'What is this?' asked the skipper.</p>

<p>"'She sent it to you,' said the nigger, and then he slipped
back amongst the others.</p>

<p>"Bruden was going to open that little box, but he changed his
mind. He might have felt the wave of hate at that moment. I do
not know. It was curious for him to act as he did. He gave the
box to a Dyak sailor to open. It was just a little box about
three inches square, and it had a nick in the cover so that you
could put your thumb nail in and draw back the sliding lid.</p>

<p>"The Dyak put his nail in the little nick and pushed, and the
lid flew open. But the Dyak dropped the box with a yell. My, yes!
A little steel point had curved up out of the box as the lid was
drawn back, and the point of the steel pricked the sailor's hand.
Down he flopped on the deck, and in five minutes he was dead. I
guess that the fright helped the poison that was on the end of
the point. The box is an old trick in the East, and the Dyak knew
that he had drawn a ticket for the next world when it touched
him.</p>

<p>"That little incident maddened Bruden. He went clean off his
head. He could not find the man who had given him the box, so he
jumped at the whole mob. Round and round the deck he chased that
batch, howling like a wolf. It was terrible. At last he fell down
from exhaustion, and the Maori mate and three of the crew carried
the brute down to his cabin. That ended the search for the night,
and I was mighty glad, too. My, yes! I watched those pilgrims
after Bruden had been dragged below, and I felt a chill as I
looked at them. You could gather up that atmosphere and analyze
it, and it would assay ninety-nine per cent, pure hate.</p>

<p>"It was about nine o'clock on the following morning when I got
a surprise. Much of a surprise. <i>Ja.</i> Bruden was below in
his cabin, and just as I turned in my walk on the poop, that
golden woman walked across the deck as cool as an iceberg and
started to put that batch of niggers through their morning
prayers as if nothing had happened. It made me cold right down to
my heels. My spine was just like a little strip of ice. It seemed
as if she had tumbled out of the skies. It did so. <i>The Red
Spider</i> was not as big as a Bibby liner, and Bruden and his
crew had overhauled every inch of the boat. And, the wonder of it
was that she looked as fresh as a daisy. Her <i>sarong</i> of
rose-colored silk had not a crease in it, and she had not the
look of a person who had been in a cramped space all night. Not
a bit of it. Her hair was as glorious as ever, and her skin
shone in the morning sunlight. It was wonderful to me, mighty
wonderful.</p>

<p>"She started those niggers praying, and no one ever prayed
like they prayed. <i>Gott!</i> didn't they pray! It was not that
they made any noise. They prayed quietly. But the
intensity&mdash;My, I cannot tell you of the feeling it gave me.
You could <i>feel</i> them praying. That is a fact. They just
wriggled and twisted their bodies as if they were in labor with
the hate they wished to get out and fire at Bruden, and I felt
sick as I watched them. And I am not easily made sick. I have
lived out here a pretty long time, but never have I seen natives
act like that batch on <i>The Red Spider.</i> They were so quiet
that I wanted to yell out because the silence was choking me.
That is so.</p>

<p>"The praying business took the wind out of the Maori mate. He
started to run down the stairs to tell Bruden that the woman had
come back, but instead of doing so he stood with his mouth open
till she had finished. Then he picked himself up and tumbled down
into the cabin screaming out the news, and my fingers crawled
around that revolver butt again. The subconscious mind is
wonderful. It is that.</p>

<p>"I could hear Bruden screaming out questions as he raced up,
and he sprang out on the deck with his bleary eyes blinking.</p>

<p>"'Where is she?' he roared. 'Where did the cunning witch stow
herself?'</p>

<p>"I gripped my revolver when I saw his face. I was mighty mad
just then. I am a German and I do not get mad at little things,
but when I get mad I am&mdash;<i>mad.</i> And I was mad at that
time. <i>Himmel!</i> Yes! The way that big brute was going on
would make an angel lose his temper. It would so. As he rushed
towards the woman I pulled my revolver out of my pocket and stuck
it in his ugly face.</p>

<p>"'If you touch her I will put a hole in you!' I said, and I
was mighty scared when I said it He could have cracked my neck
with two of his big fingers, and he looked at me like a big,
hairy gorilla when he stopped for a minute in front of my
gun.</p>

<p>"'Put it down!' he roared.</p>

<p>"'When you leave that woman alone,' I said.</p>

<p>"He looked at me for a minute, and then he sprang. He was an
animal all right. It was the leap of a <i>mias.</i> I fired while
he was in the air, but I missed him, and the next moment he had
cuffed me on the side of the head and I did not take much
interest in affairs on that boat for the next five minutes. Not
much.</p>

<p>"When I came to my senses I found that I had been dragged into
the scuppers, and I knew from the row and the rumpus that
something had happened that was not pleasing to the skipper.
Bruden's voice rose above everything else, and as I pulled myself
up I saw him dash across the deck yelling out instructions.</p>

<p>"'Hunt for her!' he screamed. 'Hunt for her, you blind-eyed
bats! She just walked away while you were gaping at her!'</p>

<p>"I looked at the pilgrims, who were sitting like marble
statues, and I knew what had happened. I did so. The golden woman
had disappeared again!</p>

<p>"That second hunt made me wonder a bit. You bet it did. I lay
there on the deck and watched them do everything but tear the
schooner to pieces, but they could not find a trace of her. Not a
trace. While all their eyes were watching Bruden spring at me,
she had slipped away. It was enough to make one feel creepy, was
it not? Out there in the Gulf of Siam with not a sail in sight,
that woman had disappeared like a ghost. It was wonderful. I do
not think we will ever know anything about this place. I am sure
we will not.</p>

<p>"All through the morning that brute hunted for her. He was a
lunatic then. The wonder of the thing had got into his thick
head, and he was insane. Once he stopped in front of me and
kicked me in the ribs like he had kicked the nigger.</p>

<p>"'Which way did she go?' he roared. 'You confounded
Dutchman&mdash;you gave her the chance to slip from me!'</p>

<p>"'And you can go to the devil and find her!' I screamed, and
he gave me another kick for my insolence as he rushed away.</p>

<p>"I have never met such another fiend like him. Never! All
through the hot afternoon he kept the crew on the jump, but they
could not find a trace of the woman. I have thought a lot of that
since that day. She was on the boat, mind you, but where she hid
herself is a mystery to me now. It is that. It was wonderful to
think that she could find a place on that schooner that Bruden
overlooked.</p>

<p>"Night came down on us again, and a big moon came up out of
Annam and silvered the Gulf. There was hardly a puff of air.
<i>The Red Spider</i> was not making a knot an hour. And it was
mighty lonesome on that boat. You can just imagine it was.
Bruden was still hunting with his crew of scoundrels, and the
pilgrims sat together and moved their lips in prayers that they
offered up in the hope that the big bully would break his
neck.</p>

<p>"A fog came over the Gulf about midnight, a sort of luminous
haze that made the things on the deck indistinct. I stayed on the
deck, mind you. I did not want to go below. I could not go. I
wanted to stay to see if anything would happen.</p>

<p>"And something did happen. <i>Ja!</i> Just a little after
midnight I heard a scream. It came up out of the cabin, and my
blood ran cold. I had been expecting that scream all day. I had
so. I knew that Bruden would not stop searching till he had found
that woman, and the scream told me that she had been found. My,
yes! That cry went up into the mist like as if it was in a hurry
to get to the door of heaven to let the good God know what had
happened, and I made a dash for the companion stairs. The fog
made it hard to see anything, but as I ran I heard those
pilgrims. You bet I did. They were coming after me, running
towards the companionway, and the <i>pat-pat</i> of their bare
feet on the deck made me think of a pack of wolves. It made me
shudder when my imagination pictured what would happen when they
got near Bruden this time. I guessed there would be murder all
right. My blood was as cold as the fog that had swept down on
us.</p>

<p>"Just as I reached the head of the stairs, the Maori mate who
was on the poop, let out a yell to fool the niggers.</p>

<p>"'She's here!' he screamed. 'She's up here on the poop!'</p>

<p>"The pattering of their bare feet stopped when they heard the
mate's yell, and while they were debating which way to run, I
dived down the stairs.</p>

<p>"There was no lamp there, and as I felt my way, someone brushed
by me. I could not see if it was man or woman, and when I cried
out I got no answer. I kept straight on, but I was scared. There
was only one scream. After that there was a silence that you
could feel with your hands. It was terrible. The fog and the
silence made me think that <i>The Red Spider</i> was a ghost ship
and that all the wonders of the two days were dreams that had got
into my brain. My, it was queer.</p>

<p>"I started to run along the little passage towards Bruden's
cabin, but I did not run far. It was dark there, mind you, and I
had not taken a dozen steps when I tumbled over something on the
floor, and Bruden's big hand gripped my ankle as I fell.</p>

<p>"'I have you, you witch!' he roared. 'I have you!'</p>

<p>"'It is I, Hochdorf!' I yelled, and then he swore.</p>

<p>"I nearly cried out to tell him that I was glad. I knew that
the woman had got away from him again, and I was pleased.
<i>Ja</i>, wasn't I pleased?</p>

<p>"'Get a lamp!' he roared. 'Get a lamp. I'm wounded!'</p>

<p>"I got a lamp out of the cabin, and when I rushed back with it
Bruden was trying to get to his feet. The brute had a knife wound
in the side of his throat, and he had bled a lot on the floor.
She had nearly fixed him that time.</p>

<p>"He snatched the lamp from my hand when he got to his feet,
and he held it close to the pool on the floor. Someone had put a
bare foot in that blood, and when I saw the imprint of that foot
I knew that it was the golden woman. That is so. There was a
small space between the print of the big toe and the third toe,
and that small space showed that the second toe was missing. Yes!
She had knifed him and run.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>"'Where did she go?' screamed Bruden. 'Get out my way, you
Dutch fool!'</p>

<p>"He held the lantern close to the floor and rushed up the
stairs to the deck. And I raced after him. He had taken my
revolver from me when he knocked me down that morning, but I had
bought a knife from a Lascar sailor, and I knew that I was going
to kill him if he caught up with that woman. I felt that.</p>

<p>"He reached the deck, and still holding the lantern low, he
rushed to the rail. I got the creeps when I saw him do that. I
knew that the faint imprint led to the side of the schooner, and
I was frightened of what had happened. The Maori mate and the mob
of pilgrims were charging down on us through the fog, and I stood
like a frozen man and watched Bruden. I felt that she had gone
over the side, and he felt it too. He brushed his big hand along
the rail, and then he held it to the light of the lantern. There
was a faint smear of blood on the palm that told me she had stood
on the rail before leaping, and my heart came up in my mouth. I
gripped the knife and took a step towards that brute. Then I
stopped, and the blade dropped out of my hand. Do you know why?
That big devil sprang upon the rail, balanced himself there for a
moment as if he were listening to some sound that came out of the
fog, and then dived into the water!</p>

<p>"I yelled to the Maori mate. The mate knew his business. He
had a boat in the water inside three minutes, and I found myself
in that boat. <i>Ja.</i> There were three others of the crew in
it, and as they started to row into the fog, I could hear those
five score niggers on the deck screaming. It was terrible. They
had discovered that the woman had gone over the side, and they
were shrieking like fiends.</p>

<p>"That fog was like cotton batting. It was thick and moved in
lumps. And I hate a fog. It is a nuisance when you cannot see
where you are going. And that fog that we struck that night in
the Gulf of Siam seemed to be the most peculiar fog I had ever
met. It was low on the water, and here and there we struck a
clear patch where the moon's rays came down full on us. And it
was moist and cold. <i>Ach!</i> It was as cold as a tomb.</p>

<p>"The Maori mate was yelling out as we pulled around in that
white blanket, and every time he would yell out those niggers on
the schooner would send a wail back to us. I tell you it was
mighty weird. And you know how a fog fools you. Sometimes we
would think that <i>The Red Spider</i> was in front of us, then
we would think she was abreast of us, and then the yells of the
niggers would make us think she was up in the air above our
heads. Every time I see a fog I think of that night, and I shiver
like a sick Kyan.</p>

<p>"Presently a cry came out of the mist, and the mate yelled
back an answer to it. 'It is the skipper!' he cried. 'He's
straight in front of us! Pull, you riff-raff, pull!'</p>

<p>"And just then another cry came from the same direction, and I
got up and shouted to the three sailors. 'It is the woman,' I
screamed. 'It is the golden woman. Pull, confound you, pull!'</p>

<p>"My, that fog was queer. It was alive. It made my blood as
cold as ice water as we burrowed into it. That is so. And every
yard we went we could hear the cries of Bruden and the golden
woman, but we did not seem to be getting nearer to them. And that
was a mystery. The three niggers were pulling like mad, but we
made no gain. It was the biggest mystery that I had ever
struck.</p>

<p>"Suddenly the Kling and the two Dyaks stopped rowing and let
out a yell that you could have heard five miles away. They had
solved the mystery. We had been caught in a whirlpool, and the
current was taking us along at a ten knot gait!</p>

<p>"You bet that those three sailors yelled. They thought it was
all up with us at that moment. We were sure that we were in one.
The boat was going round in a circle that seemed to be half a
mile or more around, and its speed was increasing every minute.
It gave me a cold sweat. We were just off Koh Samuie, and we had
never heard of such a thing there. Round and round that boat went
like a merry-go-round, and we could not see an inch in front of
us. Not an inch. It is not nice to be swished along like that.
Every minute I expected the boat to take a dive into the middle
of the earth, and I blessed Bruden. You can bet all you have got
that I said some sweet prayers for him just then. That whirlpool
had given me what you call cold feet.</p>

<p>"Suddenly the mate jumped and let out a yell, and the Dyaks
and the Kling yelled too. <i>Ja.</i> The fog broke for a minute
to the right of us, and we saw something. We saw Bruden, and he
was swimming like a madman. That is so. He was swimming in the
opposite direction to the one we were moving in, and then we knew
for sure that we were in a whirlpool. Bruden was nearer the
center of the thing, and he was moving at a swifter rate than we
were going.</p>

<p>"The Kling tried to turn the boat, and he mighty near upset
us. You could not turn in that flood. You had to go with the
current, and we went. We went like mad. Did we not? Bruden was
taken away from our eyes in three seconds, and we began to think
of our prayers. At least I did.</p>

<p>"We saw the big skipper about five minutes after, and he was
still swimming. It puzzled us to know why he did swim. We thought
that we were going to the other world at a speed that was fast
enough, but Bruden was helping the current. It was curious. That
water was as smooth as glass&mdash;I told you it was a calm
night, and there wasn't a sound. It was mighty quiet just then.
We had got away from the schooner and the screams of the
pilgrims, and the swirl of the current on the boat was the only
noise that came to our ears.</p>

<p>"The Maori mate yelled out to Bruden, and the big giant
answered him.</p>

<p>"'Swim towards us!' yelled the mate. 'Make for the boat!'</p>

<p>"What do you think Bruden answered? You would never guess.
<i>Nein.</i> He yelled out: 'She&mdash;she&mdash;in front. Can't
stop!'</p>

<p>"That was all he said. The fog closed in on him again, and he
was out of sight. We could not guess what he meant. And when we
tried to guess it made our blood go cold. The circles that
the boat was making were getting smaller, and we guessed our end
was mighty close. That was so. I pulled a few prayers out of the
back of my head, and I said them quick, and those niggers
chattered to their gods as hard as they could chatter. They knew
that we were up against it good and plenty. When they tried to
paddle against that mill race it whipped the oars out of their
hands.</p>

<p>"I guess we were going round and round for twenty minutes
before we saw Bruden again. Perhaps it was twice twenty minutes.
I do not know. The brain is not a good calculator at moments like
that. But when we saw him again he was still swimming. Swimming,
mind you. We could see his arm go up and down, and this time he
did not turn his head when the mate yelled out to him. He kept
right on. He kept on as if he were swimming after something that
was just ahead.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>"'He's mad,' I said. 'He's mad!'</p>

<p>"'Sure,' muttered the mate. 'Bruden! Bruden! Ahoy!'</p>

<p>"The Kling gripped my arm at that moment, and he pointed to
the thin fog bank into which the big skipper was swimming.</p>

<p>"'Look!' he screamed. 'Look!'</p>

<p>"'What is it?' I cried.</p>

<p>"'The witch!' he screamed. 'The golden witch!"' I felt
inclined to scream too when he said that. You bet I did. I looked
but I could see nothing, only the fog. But those niggers guessed
that they could see. They screamed out together, and then they
fell down on their faces in the bottom of the boat and groaned
like the mischief. It was a nice fix, was it not? And I had got
myself into it on account of a mad brute. You can bet I was not
praying for him at that minute. No, I was not. I kicked the Maori
off my legs, and I said some mighty hot things about that ruffian
of a skipper till my throat was sore. That boat was traveling as
fast as a torpedo destroyer, and the niggers were smashing the
silence into little pieces with their yells. It was terrible.</p>

<p>"Now I come to tell you of the things of which I can give you
no proof. Not one little bit. That is why I told you not to ask
me for any. You may ask your skin, that is all I can say. That
accursed whirlpool stopped whirling just as I thought I had flung
my last curse at Bruden. It was so. It stopped like you would
stop a roulette wheel, and I kicked those niggers till they got
out their oars and started to pull. And then we saw Bruden again.
He was not swimming this time. He was floating in a little eddy
at what seemed to be the very core of that maelstrom, and we
pulled towards him.</p>

<p>"We dragged him in over the side of the boat and laid him on
the bottom. He was not dead, but it would have been better for
him if he had been. That is so. He had hit his head against a
rock or something, and he was paralyzed. He could not move hand
or foot, and he babbled like a baby. And now I will tell you the
most wonderful thing of all. That big skipper had something
gripped tightly in his left hand, and you would not guess what it
was in a thousand years&mdash;no, nor ten thousand years. It was
one of the hammered silver anklets of the golden woman, and it
had not been in his hand when he jumped from the rail of <i>The
Red Spider</i>.</p>

<p>"I do not know how he got it. I wish I did. But I could not
pull it out of his grip, and he held on to it when we pulled back
to the schooner as the fog swept away.</p>

<p>"Mind you, <i>I</i> did not see that woman in the water. Those
niggers <i>said</i> they did, but I could <i>not</i>, and
yet&mdash;Well, the East is a big proposition, and it grows
bigger the longer you stay with it."</p>

<p>A monkey whimpered in the adjoining hut, and Hochdorf plunged
into the darkness. In a few minutes he returned with a baby
<i>mias</i> in his big arms.</p>

<p>"And the golden woman?" I asked. "Did she&mdash;was she ever
heard of afterwards?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ja!</i> That is the greatest wonder of all. I would give
my year's wages, and that is ten thousand marks, if I could have
it all explained to me. When that Maori mate managed to navigate
<i>The Red Spider</i> to Bangkok, I went ashore, and at the gate
of the Temple of Wat Sutat I saw her speaking to a crowd. I was
not astounded. Somehow I expected it. When we lifted that
paralyzed brute onto the deck of the schooner on the night of the
fog; those niggers were as quiet as mice. And that made me
wonder.</p>

<p>"I went up to the golden woman, and when she had finished
speaking I addressed her in English. What do you think she did?
She turned and spoke to a Shan priest that was at her side, and
he spoke to me. He translated what she said. Ho, ho, yes! He told
me that she did not speak English, and that she was not allowed
to speak to an unbeliever. And I laughed. I did so. I looked down
at her left foot where there was a toe missing. <i>Ja.</i> And I
looked at her instep where there was a big scratch as if one of
her silver anklets had been torn off by force, and then I laughed
again. And she stared after me with those eyes that were deeper
than the Tengpeng Well, as I walked down the street. I have tried
to put it from my mind, but it will not go. It is foolish to
think too much about a thing like that. It is so. Are you sleepy
now? I will give the baby <i>mias</i> a drink, and then we will
turn in."</p>

<p class="first"><i><b>ULYSSES E. SLINGSBY was a typical New Yorker (he lived in Hoboken), who was plunked down in the slime of the Suez Canal, and caught in a whirlpool of mystically Eastern adventure. His story makes us rejoice that Mr. Dwyer has ceased globe-trottinh for the time, and started that marvelous imagination of his on more wonder tales for you.</b></i></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THIS is the story of Ulysses E. Slingsby, a
one-time resident of Hoboken, N.J., but now a permanent boarder
at Al-Kasim's sour-smelling little boarding house in Pasaca
Street, Port Said. It is a true story. The Arabs say that a lie
has no legs, and if one pursues a falsehood it will collapse like
the one-eyed robber who attempted to steal the wonderful emerald
breastplate of Mohammed. A truth, however, has wings that can
take it out of the reach of the incredulous ones who would
strangle the wisdom-laden words of the Prophet himself. The story
of Slingsby has lived through five years of bazaar gossip, and
its wings grow stronger day by day.</p>

<p>Ulysses E. Slingsby was an engineer in the employ of the
Holworth, Hyde and Heppler Construction Company of New York City.
Slingsby was a capable man and he was held in high esteem by the
company. He was a conscientious, hard-working employee, and when
the H.H. &amp; H. Company gained the contract for the El-Nar Dam
by underbidding their great rival, the Malbar, Fincham Company,
Holworth, the senior member of the firm, called Slingsby into his
private office.</p>

<p>"Slingsby," he said, "would you like to see the East?"</p>

<p>"The East?" repeated Slingsby.</p>

<p>"Yes, the East," said Holworth. "Would you like to see
palm-trees and elephants, flying fish and&mdash;-and things like
that? Temple bells a-tinklin' while you work; sunny skies, Sand,
and the El-Nar Dam?"</p>

<br>
<div align="center">

</div>
<br>

<p>Slingsby took a great breath and looked at the senior partner.
"Would you give the chance?" he cried. "Would you?"</p>

<p>"It's yours," answered Holworth. "It is a big thing, Slingsby.
Every minute counts, and if we fall down on this stunt the
Malbar, Fincham crowd will gather in everything in that part of
the world for the next ten years. Pack your grip and get your
instructions; you will have to drive them night and day to get it
through."</p>

<p>Three weeks after that interview, Ulysses E. Slingsby, dressed
in immaculate ducks, and wearing a new topee, stood upon the
hurricane deck of the Peninsula &amp; Oriental steamship
<i>Maloja</i>, as that vessel glided along the big breakwater and
tied up to a buoy off the landing jetty at Port Said. Slingsby
was impressed. Already he felt the glamour of the East, although
he had not yet entered the gateway. But from the moment he donned
the white suit and magnificent topee he felt that he had sailed
into the regions of Romance, and unexplainable thrills came to
him as he watched the statue of the great De Lesseps, who, with
arm outstretched, points to the massive trench which he dug
through the sands to Suez.</p>

<p>"Gee! it's great!" muttered Slingsby. "It's fine! Why, it is
snowin' back in old New York, an' this burg is as warm as
Atlantic City in the summer time."</p>

<p>Slingsby went ashore by himself. Port Said nowadays is one of
the best policed cities in the East. Lord Cromer has cleaned the
town so that it is possible for a three-year-old child to walk in
safety from the landing stage to the sand stretches beyond the
Arab town&mdash;and Slingsby was a little more than three.</p>

<p>Ulysses E. did the usual tourist stunts. He visited the
mosque, drove through the Arab quarter, and sipped cold drinks on
the colonnade of the Continental as he watched the jugglers do
amazing tricks. He bought curios that had been imported from
Birmingham, Yokohama, and other far-away places, and he posted
three dozen cards to friends in New York. Each one of the three
dozen cards carried the message:</p>

<p class="cp"><i><b>This is the greatest place ever. Me for the heat!</b></i></p>

He posted three dozen cards to friends in New York. All carried the<br>
same message: "This is the greatest place ever. Me for the heat!</p>
</div>

<p><br>
As the shades of evening fell upon the town he walked down to
the jetty, and with the firm belief that he knew Port Said from
title page to back cover, he stepped into a boat and pointed to
the P. &amp; O. steamer that lay a few hundred yards from the
jetty.</p>

<p>"Get a move on, Steve," was his jocular remark to the Arab
boatman. "Let me see something lively in this burg before I shake
its dust off my shoes."</p>

<p>Slingsby's ducks and topee, so he assured himself, made him
look like an experienced traveler, and he felt quite pleased with
himself as he lolled back in the boat and listened to the soft
chant of the Arab.</p>

<p>"And it's snowing in old New York," he muttered. "'Gee whiz!
Snowing? And here it's warm and comfortable, with nice soft
breezes and odors that make you forget everything and
everybody."</p>

<p>It was just at the moment when Slingsby delivered himself of
this little romantic speech that something happened.</p>

<p>A hawser stretched between the stern of the <i>Maloja</i> and
a snubbing-post ashore, caught the Arab boatman beneath the chin.
The Arab made a brave effort to preserve his balance, but he
found it impossible. He fell against Slingsby, who had half risen
from his seat when the wet hawser struck the oarsman, and the
next moment, Ulysses E. Slingsby was struggling in the somewhat
dirty water of Port Said harbor.</p>

<p>Slingsby could never explain what really happened to him after
the upset. He had a belief that the boatman was strangling him.
He tried to fight himself free of the brown hands that gripped
his throat, but he found it impossible. He felt that he was being
carried down into watery depths, and during the seconds that
elapsed before he became unconscious, he remembered that an inner
self was protesting madly against his stupidity in leaving New
York to come to a place where it was possible for an Arab boatman
to strangle a saloon passenger within hail of the big steamer
upon which he was voyaging.</p>

<p>Ulysses E. Slingsby returned to consciousness at dawn on the
following morning. For ten minutes, he lay with his eyes open,
trying hard to recall the happenings of the previous evening. He
remembered how the Arab had dragged him down, but he knew as he
stared at the ceiling above his head that he had been rescued in
time. He was alive, but where he was, he could not tell.</p>

<p>Slingsby lifted himself upon his elbow and examined his
surroundings. He was lying on a small white-enameled bed in a
little room that was furnished in Oriental fashion. There were
rugs and cushions, tapestries and articles of curious workmanship
that convinced Slingsby that he was in a house whose owner was
not European.</p>

<p>"Where the dickens am I?" he muttered. "I'm not on the boat,
but why the mischief didn't they&mdash;" He lifted himself up and
sent a yell into the silence. "Waiter!" he screamed. "Steward! Is
there anybody about? Hey, there! Waiter! Steward!"</p>

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="2200261h-images/TheLittleGoldEarsOfSleth-4.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"Waiter!" he screamed.</p>
</div>

<p>In response to Slingsby's wild yell, there was a quick
pattering of feet along the passage leading from the door of the
little room. The door was flung open and Slingsby stared at the
wonderful apparition that appeared. Slingsby's own account of her
looks, which he has retailed to four or five people, would lead
one to believe that the woman who appeared in the doorway was
more beautiful than Marna or the dark-eyed Zela whom the Prophet
picked to welcome the faithful into the Seventh Heaven. Slingsby
says that she was the most wonderful looking creature in the
whole world, and no one can contradict Slingsby. No person can be
found who saw the woman previous to that morning, and Slingsby
has, since parting with her, spent five years at Al-Kasim's
stuffy little boarding-house in an effort to locate her.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" cried Slingsby, after he had stared for a few
minutes at the glorious tinted face turned towards him. "Where
the dickens am I? I'm not on the <i>Maloja</i>; where am I?"</p>

<p>"You are safe," murmured the apparition. "You are perfectly
safe."</p>

<p>Slingsby asserts that the voice of the woman was as musical as
the waters of the El-Nath waterfall which flows over a bed of
smooth rock 'way up beyond Temsal, and, once again, Slingsby's
word must be taken because there is no one to contradict.</p>

<p>"But the steamer?" cried the engineer. "The <i>Maloja!</i> Why
am I not aboard the steamer?"</p>

<p>"The steamer has sailed," murmured the woman. "She sailed last
night."</p>

<p>"But why wasn't I put aboard?" cried Slingsby. "Why didn't
they take me aboard when they pulled me out of the water? Why did
the fools bring me here? Who&mdash;who rescued me?"</p>

<p>The dark-eyed woman came softly across the room, and her face
was close to Slingsby's as she stood near. He was looking up into
eyes in which all the mystery of the Orient lay concealed, and
for a single moment, Slingsby of Hoboken felt strangely
indifferent to the fate which had brought him to the little room.
But that indifference was only momentary. Thoughts of Holworth
and of the great dam flooded his mind, and he repeated his
question in a louder tone.</p>

<p>"Quick! Tell me! Who was it rescued me?"</p>

<p>The red lips moved ever so slightly. "I did," murmured the
woman. "I saved your life when the boatman had nearly strangled
you."</p>

<p>Slingsby remained speechless for three minutes, and in that
short space of time, the East placed its velvet fingers upon the
engineer from New York City. It seemed as if soft little lariats
were being plaited around the soul of Ulysses E. Slingsby.</p>

<p>To his nostrils there came a whiff of strange perfume which
intoxicated him. His eyes feasted upon the beauty of the woman
who stood close to him. He noted the strange jewelry on her
rounded arms and finely modeled neck. A curious sense of delight
at being left behind by the steamer fought with the loyalty which
Slingsby had for the H.H. &amp; H. Company which employed
him.</p>

<p>"But why did you bring me here?" he asked feebly. "I should
have been put on the steamer. I'm&mdash;I'm a first saloon
passenger. I am Ulysses E. Slingsby of Hoboken, New Jersey."</p>

<p>"No one knew you," said the woman, slowly shaking her head.
"No one knew your name, so I had you brought here. How do you say
it?"</p>

<p>"Say what?" asked Slingsby.</p>

<p>"Your name," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Ulysses E. Slingsby," repeated the engineer.</p>

<p>"Isses E. Slingsby," said the woman. "I like your name,
Isses."</p>

<p>"Ulysses," said Slingsby.</p>

<p>"Isses," said the soft lips that charmed Slingsby by the
manner in which they endeavored to pronounce his name. "Isses.
Yes, I understand."</p>

<p>Slingsby gave up the attempt. It didn't much matter whether
she called him "Isses" or "Ulysses," and, as she had rescued him
from drowning, he could not be particular about little matters
like the pronunciation of his name.</p>

<p>Slingsby tried to collect his thoughts. Holworth would imagine
that he was at that moment moving down the Suez Canal on his way
to take charge of the great dam at El-Nar. Holworth, in his
twentieth-story office back in New York, would have his finger
upon the atlas, fully aware of the exact spot where his engineer
was at any particular moment. Holworth had a wonderful mind for
details, and Slingsby knew how important it was that he should
reach El-Nar at the earliest possible moment. The great dam had
to be pushed forward with the utmost speed to avoid the penalty
clauses in the contract.</p>

<p>"I must get there!" he cried. "I want to get to El-Nar as
quickly as I can! I must get there at once!"</p>

<p>"El-Nar?" repeated the woman, whose wonderful eyes were upon
the engineer.</p>

<p>"Yes, El-Nar!" cried Slingsby. "I am an engineer! Do you
understand? I am the engineer in charge of the big dam, and
I've got to get there as quickly as possible!"</p>

<p>She nodded the shapely head upon which the raven black hair
was piled in a fashion that made Slingsby marvel. "I understand,
Isses," she said softly. "I understand. You want to go to
El-Nar?"</p>

<p>"You've got me," said Slingsby. "I want to get there as
quickly as possible. Say, send in my clothes and I will dress. I
must find out when the next boat will be along."</p>

<p>The woman, who was as beautiful as Zela, disappeared with a
smile, and inside of three minutes, a Somali boy brought into the
room the white duck suit which Slingsby had on when he was
capsized from the boat in the harbor. The suit had been washed
and ironed. The white silk socks also had been laundered, and the
deck shoes dried and cleaned. It was only the topee that showed
signs of the immersion. The topee was a crumpled mass, and
Slingsby laughed grimly as the Somali boy held it up for
inspection.</p>

<p>"It's all right, my boy," said the engineer. "I'll buy another
one. I guess my wallet&mdash;" Slingsby broke off and sprang for
the white jacket. A horrible thought had come to him. Perhaps his
wallet had dropped out of the coat pocket during his struggle
with the boatman, and he might even then be penniless in a
strange town.</p>

<p>The chilling surmise turned out to be a certainty. There was
no wallet in the pocket of the coat. Neither was there any news
of its discovery. After Slingsby had dressed himself, the
dark-eyed woman assured him that there was no money or papers in
his clothes when he was rescued from the water.</p>

<p>Slingsby was fearfully excited. He was at a loss what to do.
The steamer had gone on without him, and he had no money with
which to pay his passage on another boat. He had not even the
price of a cable that would inform Holworth of his position.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" he cried, turning upon the woman whose
shapely hands had pulled him out of the water. "What the dickens
will I do?"</p>

<p>The black-eyed woman remained silent, watching Slingsby, whose
face showed the consternation he felt at finding that his wallet
had disappeared.</p>

<p>"What shall I do? I haven't got a dollar to cable with."</p>

<p>She understood then, and to Slingsby's surprise, she produced
two sovereigns and tendered them to him.</p>

<p>"You can use those," she cried. "Take them. I will loan them
to you."</p>

<p>Slingsby started to stammer out protests, but she would not
listen. She assured him that he was welcome to the money, and, at
last, he decided to accept her offer.</p>

<p>"I want to cable my bosses," he said&mdash;"the Holworth, Hyde
&amp; Heppler Company, 'way over in the United States. I want to
tell them how I am fixed. They will cable me money right here and
then I will be able to repay you."</p>

<p>The woman clapped her hands, and an aged Arab appeared to
guide Slingsby to the office of the Eastern Cable Company.
Slingsby was much excited. In his hurry to send a cable he forgot
to address one word of thanks to her for saving him from
drowning. He could only think of the position in which the
unfortunate accident placed his employers, who had carefully
reckoned up every minute of the time it would take to construct
the El-Nar Dam. Even with Slingsby pushing the work, they doubted
if they could avoid the penalties which would be inflicted if the
job was not finished by contract time; and Slingsby, in a mad
fever of excitement, ran at a jog trot towards the offices of the
Cable Company.</p>

<p>He sent the cable, and then, somewhat soothed, it dawned upon
him that he hadn't offered one word of thanks to the woman who
had rescued him. He was relieved to find that the Arab guide was
still with him, and he immediately turned back to the house to
offer thanks and apologies for his somewhat brusque departure. He
told himself that she would understand when he explained that he
was the engineer in charge of a great work which could not be
delayed.</p>

<p>And Slingsby was correct. The black-eyed lady understood and
sympathized. Slingsby wondered at her powers of understanding. He
wondered as he listened to her consoling words. In fact, at that
moment she was to Slingsby a source of consolation that made him
truly thankful. Port Said was foreign to the engineer from
Hoboken. The whole city was strange and unreal, yet his good
fortune was wonderful.</p>

<p>"Holworth will cable at once," said Slingsby. "He'll send me
the coin the moment he gets the news. The dam has got to be
pushed with all speed."</p>

<p>When night came down upon Port Said, the dark-eyed rescuer
made a further loan. Slingsby refused the use of the room in
which he had awakened that morning; and the woman, smiling at his
refusal, advanced him the money to pay for a room at the
Continental.</p>

<p>"But you will come and see me?" she murmured. "Tomorrow,
Isses?"</p>

<p>"Yes, tomorrow," said Slingsby. "I'll come to pay you back and
say good-by tomorrow. The German boat will be here by noon and
I'll get a passage on her. Hoi worth will send the coin."</p>

<p>But Holworth sent no coin. A long day passed without any cable
from H.H. &amp; H. Company, and Slingsby's nerves went to pieces.
It was the soft voice of the dark-eyed woman that soothed him
during that long day. She told him that everything would be all
right, that he must be patient. The Company would surely send him
the necessary funds, and, till then, she would think it a
pleasure to advance him enough for board and lodging.</p>

<p>Slingsby found it hard to accept the loan, but it was tendered
in a manner that soothed the qualms he felt. Slingsby, thinking
much of the El-Nar Dam and of the dilatory Holworth, tried now to
form a proper estimate of the woman who had befriended him. He
tried to guess at her nationality. There was color in her veins,
but it was so slight that Slingsby told himself it wasn't enough
to make a fuss about. She told him that she was the widow of a
French officer, and Slingsby believed.</p>

<p>Slingsby borrowed another sovereign and sent another cable. He
was angry with Holworth. He, Slingsby, was not to blame. He had
been knocked overboard by the Arab boatman who had collided with
the hawser in the dusk of the evening. He had nearly lost his
life as well as his money, and he could not understand why
Holworth refused to send sufficient funds to hurry him on his
way.</p>

<p>"He's mad!" he repeated over and over again. "He's a lunatic
to delay things like this! Every minute counts, and he knows how
we will lose other contracts if we can't get through this in the
time we promised." Slingsby was thinking of the Malbar, Fincham
people, and how they would be overjoyed at hearing of any delay
in connection with the contract for the big dam.</p>

<p>It was on the third evening after his immersion that the
dark-eyed woman told Slingsby the story of Sleth of the Wonderful
Ears. Perhaps she did it with a view of diverting Slingsby's mind
from his misfortunes. Anyhow, Slingsby was interested.</p>

<p>It is an old story, the story of Sleth. It is told from
Abulaba to Obok, and from Ain Hamed to Mesnah. It has been told
for seventeen hundred years. It has come down through the
centuries, a pathetic little tale concerning the waiting maid of
the Princess Azra, whose hearing was so keen that she could hear
a whisper uttered by a person miles and miles away. Her hearing
was so acute that she could hear the whispers of desert lovers
far out beyond the Bitter Waters; and the fame of Sleth went up
and down the land. To her the little grains of sand spoke with
soft voices. To her the night breezes carried the faintest
murmurings. To her wonderful ears came everything; but Sleth,
gifted with this power, was not wise. She heard the Captain of
the Guard whisper soft words to the Princess, and she was stupid
enough to tell. The Princess was angry, very angry. She ordered
the Captain of the Guard to cut off Sleth's wonderful ears, and
the Captain of the Guard was only too willing to comply.</p>

<p>It was then that Allah performed the miracle that gave Sleth
undying fame. Two tiny gold ears were brought to Sleth by a
winged <i>peri</i> who came from the Paradise of the Faithful,
and with these delicate ears, which were wonderfully modeled, she
could hear even more distinctly than she had heard with the ears
of which she had been deprived.</p>

<p>The whole world became a sounding-board to which she listened.
The breezes that blew across from Mecca brought to her the
chanting of pilgrims, the sounds of festivals and the songs of
the desert shepherds. The winds that came from the sea brought
her the chanteys of sailor-men out on the deep waters, the songs
of the pearl fishers from far-off Bahrein, and the fierce yells
of the pirates who prowled up and down the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>It was all a wonderful story to Slingsby&mdash;Slingsby, who
was upset and irritated by the delay. As he listened to it, he
forgot Holworth. He forgot the dangers which threatened the H.H.
&amp; H. Company through his misfortune. His mind built up a
picture of the wonderful ears, as the woman with the voice that
was as soft as the murmur of the El-Nath waterfall told him the
story. The dark-haired woman was a wonderful story teller.</p>

<p>"Gee, that's a yarn! Reads like a yellow-press Sunday story,"
he cried.</p>

<p>"It is true," murmured the woman.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Slingsby. "I bet if I doubted it that you could
show me the little gold ears."</p>

<p>The dark-eyed woman stared at Slingsby for a few minutes as if
his remark caused her some surprise; then she stood up slowly
and walked towards him. "I could show you the ears," she said,
her voice keyed soft and low. "If you would help me, we could get
them. See, I have the plans which tell me the exact spot where
Sleth is buried. They were given to me by Zuphra the Wise, and no
one else has the information. You are learned in such things,
Isses, and you will be able to understand. It is somewhere within
two days' journey of this place, but my poor little brain cannot
grasp the details."</p>

<p>She placed before Slingsby several rolls of parchment on which
were many drawings and much writing in Arabic; and Slingsby of
Hoboken, flattered by her appeal to his intelligence, started to
pore over the curious drawings which filled the sheets.</p>

<p>In the hours that followed, the woman with the soft, musical
voice was at Slingsby's elbow as he pored over the chart. A
strange, heady perfume came from her filmy garments; her eyes
shone with a light that had a peculiar effect upon Slingsby each
time he glanced at her.</p>

<p>"The little gold ears were buried with Sleth," she murmured.
"All my life I have thought of finding them, Isses, but I have
never found anyone who could read the chart."</p>

<p>"It is something of a puzzle to read," said Slingsby.</p>

<p>"But you can do it, Isses," she murmured. "You can do it."</p>

<p>And Slingsby, fed with flattering words, stared at the chart
and used his engineering skill in an effort to puzzle out the
position of the tomb of Sleth.</p>

<p>Next morning Slingsby sent another cable, the fourth. In the
afternoon, he sent another. The dark-eyed woman paid. Slingsby
felt that his indebtedness to her was mounting up. She advanced
the money for his meals and his room.</p>

<p>The following day, Slingsby sent two more cables, but no reply
came from Holworth. Slingsby stormed. He looked towards New York
and cursed Holworth and the H.H. &amp; H. Company for refusing to
answer his messages. Slingsby had an idea that Holworth was so
disgusted with him that he wouldn't honor him with a cable to say
that his messages had been received.</p>

<p>And during those days, when Slingsby's mind was in a ferment,
the dark-eyed woman soothed it by telling him stories of the
wonderful Sleth and inducing him to help her in her effort to
locate the exact position of the tomb. And Slingsby became
curiously interested in Sleth of the Wonderful Ears. Day after
day, to divert his mind from the fix he was in, he would pore
over the curious parchment charts, and he would listen with
wonder to the stories the woman told.</p>

<p>"If I could find the place, Isses!" she would murmur softly.
"If I could only find the tomb! Do you see what they have written
here? It tells that the ears of Sleth, the little gold ears,
Isses, were buried with her. They laid them on her breast when
she died."</p>

<p>And Slingsby, listening day after day, as he waited for the
cable which never came, became more and more interested in the
finding of the tomb of the wonderful Sleth.</p>

<p>There came a morning, at last, when Slingsby cursed the H.H.
&amp; H. Company to the uttermost ends of perdition. He damned
Holworth and Heppler and Hyde, with their subchiefs and office
staff. He damned the El-Nar work and prayed that the penalty
clauses in the contract would ruin the company by whom he was
employed. Three weeks of waiting in Port Said had upset the mind
of Ulysses E. Slingsby. The atmosphere of the place had a
peculiar effect upon him. He was dazed and stupid. The inaction
had brought upon him a mild form of insanity. And one morning he
rode into the desert, side by side with the dark-eyed woman.</p>

<p>"We will find the tomb, Isses," she murmured as they rode on
into the white sunshine. "I know we will, Isses."</p>

<p>"I think so," said Slingsby. "Why, yes, I believe we
will."</p>

<p>The desert swallowed up Slingsby and the woman, and the two
Arab servants who rode with them. The great sand stretches
unrolled before them, and the dunes, like the graves of gods,
rose behind them in countless numbers.</p>

<p>Slingsby forgot that he was Slingsby. The desert blotted out
his individuality. Sometimes he felt certain that he had never
seen New York, that no such company existed as the H.H. &amp; H.
and that the fat Holworth was but the figment of a dream.</p>

<p>Men who see for the first time great stretches of smooth sand
upon which the sun beats till it looks like a bed of crushed
diamonds, often suffer from the strange form of aphasia which
attacked Slingsby. In those days in the desert he forgot
everything but the fact that he had promised the dark-eyed woman
to locate the tomb of Sleth by means of the chart which she had
given him.</p>

<p>"We will find it, Isses," she would murmur again and again,
her voice coming to Slingsby like sweet music from afar.</p>

<p>"Yes, we shall find it," Slingsby would mutter. "I have
calculated everything correctly and I know that we will strike
the right place."</p>

<p>And Ulysses E. Slingsby was safe in making his boast. He had
made his calculations with care and precision. There came an
afternoon when the little cavalcade halted near an oasis, and
Slingsby, slipping from his camel, turned to his companion.</p>

<p>"If the tomb exists, it is within a hundred yards of where I
am standing," he said. "I am certain of that."</p>

<p>"Oh! Isses!" murmured the woman. "Oh, if you are really
right!"</p>

<p>Slingsby was right. Holworth had always said that Slingsby's
soul was composed of blue prints, and the manner in which he had
gathered his information from the parchment charts made one think
that Holworth was correct in his diagnosis. Slingsby had located
the exact spot. Ten hours after their arrival at the little oasis
in the desert, the two Arab servants were busy shoveling the
sand from a great slab of stone which Slingsby felt was the door
of the tomb he sought.</p>

<p>That was a wonderful morning for Slingsby and for his
companion. With much trouble they displaced the stone which
formed the entrance to the rock tomb, and side by side, they
entered. The tomb was hewn out of the solid rock, and resting on
the floor was a stone sarcophagus upon the lid of which were
Arabic characters which the woman deciphered while Slingsby held
a light for her to read.</p>

<p>Slingsby thrilled as he listened. It was the tomb of Sleth
that he had discovered. From the marble slab the dark-eyed woman
read the story of the wonderful ears. Beneath the slab lay Sleth
of the gold ears&mdash; Sleth, for whom Allah had worked a
miracle when the anger of the Princess had deprived her of the
organs which gathered the faintest whispers from the desert
air.</p>

<p>Slingsby rigged up a hoist, and with the aid of the two Arabs,
he swung the great slab from the sarcophagus. Slingsby was drunk
then, intoxicated by the sunshine and the desert and the stories
which he had heard concerning the person whose mummified figure
lay before their eyes when the big slab had been dragged aside.
He hadn't a thought of Holworth or the Construction Company. He
was afire with the excitement produced by the discovery.</p>

<p>Slingsby and the woman ordered the two Arabs out of the
chamber. Then they proceeded very carefully to unwind the linen
cloth which covered the mummied form. They did not speak. Their
lips could not utter a sound, and Slingsby breathed heavily as he
helped his rescuer to unwind the long strips which crumbled
beneath their fingers. The woman was murmuring something which
seemed to Slingsby to be a cross between a chant and a prayer,
something which he took to be an invocation to the Lords of Death
to protect them from any punishment which might come to them for
desecrating the tomb of the dead.</p>

<p>And then, halfway in the work of unrolling the mummy, the
woman stopped with a shout of joy and gladness. She sprang
forward with hands outstretched, and Slingsby thrust his head
close to view the object which had attracted her.</p>

<p class="caption">
Halfway in the work of unrolling the mummy, the woman stopped with a<br>
shout of joy and gladness. She sprang forward with hands outstretched.</p>
</div>

<p>A fold of linen which the engineer had turned, disclosed two
tiny ears of beaten gold, and the dark-eyed woman clutched at
them. They lay upon the breast of Sleth; and Slingsby, the blood
pounding madly through his head, knelt and stared. The woman's
face was alight with a great joy. The black eyes were flaming
with excitement. Her face was wonderful to look upon as she took
up the two little gold ears and held them close to her bosom.</p>

<p>"They are the wonderful ears, Isses!" she cried. "The
wonderful ears!"</p>

<p>Slingsby turned again to the figure from which they had
stripped the linen wrappings. For a moment he stared at it; then
he, in turn, gave a cry and stepped forward. In turning to look
at the little ears, he had dragged aside a thick fold of cloth;
and now, as he looked, the light from the torch was gathered up
by a shining mass and thrown back to him in beams of all the
colors of the rainbow. Slingsby put out his hands and touched the
glittering mass. His lean fingers touched precious stones that
flamed as he lifted them up.</p>

<p>As he disturbed the heap, single stones of wondrous beauty
rolled along the linen, yellow with age, making spots of colored
fire as they rolled. They were wonderful gems, gems that seemed
to flash now with extraordinary brilliancy as if they were hungry
for the light that had been denied them for centuries and
centuries.</p>

<p>Slingsby couldn't tell how long he and the woman Stared at the
precious stones. He thinks it must have been hours. He is sure it
must have been hours. It was midday when they pulled the slab of
stone from off the sarcophagus, and night had fallen upon the
desert when they came to their senses. During these hours, they
had done nothing else but fondle the magnificent gems and
endeavor stupidly to calculate the worth of each.</p>

<p>There were stones of every kind: great rubies that resembled
monster drops of Congealed blood; emeralds more brilliant than
the big stone that was set in the turban of the Prophet; pearls
that had come from the Arabian Sea when the pearl fisheries were
new; diamonds that threw out shafts of white light when they
brought the torch near them.</p>

<p>The great pile of gems held them spellbound, and it was only
the coming of the night that brought them back to their
senses.</p>

<p>The dark-eyed woman, more practical than Slingsby, suggested
that they cover up the stones lest the two Arab servants should
obtain a glimpse of them. Hurriedly she took off a silk scarf
which she wore and placed upon it the glittering stones. Then,
tying it carefully, she took it in her hand and led Slingsby out
onto the sand that was still warm from the hot breath of the
afternoon sun.</p>

<p>It was then that the woman remembered the wonderful ears of
Sleth. She had placed the little ears of beaten gold within her
bosom when Slingsby had drawn her attention to the shining mass
of gems; and now as they stood outside the tomb, she took them
out and lifted them to her ears.</p>

<p>Slingsby was staring at the desert. Far across the sands, a
great bar of light was traveling eastward, and Slingsby watched
it. The shaft of light drew his attention, and he questioned his
companion.</p>

<p>"What is that?" he cried.</p>

<p>"It is the searchlight of the German mail-boat," answered the
woman. "The canal is out there. And the big German boat is going
down it from Port Said to Suez."</p>

<p>For a moment Slingsby forgot the ears of Sleth. He was
fascinated by the great beam of light which shone through the
night. It seemed to drag him out of the stupor which had held him
during the preceding hours. The searchlight seemed to be a great
finger that threatened him as he stood and watched it. It seemed
to tell him that he was Ulysses E. Slingsby of Hoboken, and that
he didn't belong to the desert. Somehow or other, it brought back
to him his pride in the profession to which he belonged. It made
him think that he was kin to the great Frenchman who had dug that
tremendous trench through four-score miles of shifting sand.</p>

</div>

<p>The woman interrupted his thoughts. She was speaking to him
and Slingsby turned towards her. She was holding to her ears the
tiny pieces of beaten gold which she assured Slingsby were the
wonderful ears of Sleth. "I can hear, Isses!" she cried. "I can
hear!"</p>

<p>A madness came over Slingsby. He gripped her arm and pointed
to the great beam of light which marked the slow passage of the
mail-boat.</p>

<p>"You can?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I can," she breathed. "Yes, Isses, I can hear whispers from
miles away across the desert."</p>

<p>Slingsby's grip tightened on her arm. He was in great
excitement. Hastily he calculated the time that had elapsed since
the evening he was upset in the waters of Port Said. Three weeks
and three days had gone by, and Slingsby wondered at that moment
if there was not a possibility of someone connected with the H.H.
&amp; H. Company being aboard the big boat whose great electric
eye swept the canal waters. Sufficient time had elapsed to allow
the Construction Company to send out a successor to take his
place upon the El-Nar Dam.</p>

<p>Slingsby, in telling of this incident an hour later, took oath
that he didn't mention his thoughts to the woman who stood beside
him. He is certain of this. They were his own thoughts and he did
not breathe them to her as he stood there. But his meditations
were interrupted by words that thrilled him, and he turned
fiercely upon the woman.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he cried.</p>

<p>"'Olworth!" she whispered. "'Olworth, Isses! He is aboard the
boat!"</p>

<p>She was holding the two little gold ears close to her head,
and Slingsby wet his dry lips and screamed at her.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" he cried. "I can hear!" she murmured, her
eyes shining as Slingsby thrust the torch close to her face. "I
can hear, Isses! I can hear the whispers on the boat!"</p>

<p>Slingsby flung another question at her. "What&mdash;what is he
saying?" he cried.</p>

<p>"He is telling someone about you, Isses," she answered. "He is
telling someone that you took money from someone else, and
betrayed him. Wait! Wait! I will hear the name! Yes, yes, Isses!
He is telling the other that you took money from the
Malbar&mdash;Malbar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, go on!" shouted Slingsby.</p>

<p>"From the Malbar, Fincham Company," she continued. "He says
that you took it as a bribe and that it ruined him on the El-Nar
Dam."</p>

<p>Slingsby gave a cry of rage as he turned towards the great bar
of light which moved slowly across the desert. The engineer was
making hurried calculations. He knew that the steamers were
compelled to steam slowly through the big trench, and he flung a
question at his companion.</p>

<p>"Which is the nearest track to the canal?" he cried. "How far
is it from here?"</p>

<p>The woman thrust her bare arm out towards the southeast. "Over
there," she murmured, "the canal is only three miles away."</p>

<p>Before she had finished speaking, Ulysses E. Slingsby, crazed
with the belief that Holworth of the H.H. &amp; H. Company
considered him a traitor, dashed away across the sands.</p>

<p>It was the quartermaster of the big German liner who heard the
cry that came up out of the waters as the boat crept quietly
forward, and who flung a buoy and a rope in the direction from
which the cry came. Passengers and stewards rushed from every
part of the ship and the slowly turning screw stopped as the
officer on the bridge heard the second yell which came from the
dark waters.</p>

<p>The quartermaster hauled upon the rope which he had thrown
into the canal, and by the aid of willing hands, both of
passengers and crew, who came to his assistance, a dripping
figure was hauled upon the well-deck. The rescued one stood
beneath an arc lamp and stared at the group that surrounded
him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Holworth!" he cried. "Where is Mr. Holworth?"</p>

<p>For a moment no one answered; then the assistant purser pushed
his way to the front of the group. "Who is it you want?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Mr. Holworth!" answered the man who had come up out of the
night. "Mr. Holworth, of the Holworth, Hyde &amp; Heppler Company
of New York!"</p>

<p>A young man with a clean-cut face and firm jaw took a cigar
from his mouth the moment he heard the name and elbowed his way
towards the half-drowned man who stood beneath the light.</p>

<p>"Holworth isn't aboard," said the young man. "He's in New
York. That's my Company, the H.H. &amp; H. I am their engineer
going out to the El-Nar Dam. What is it you wanted to see
Holworth about? Why, it's Slingsby!"</p>

<p>He sprang forward and gripped the hand of the dripping
Slingsby, and Slingsby, gasping weakly, blinked as he returned
the handclasp.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and Holworth isn't on board?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," answered the young man. "He's in New York, Slingsby.
What put that into your head? He sent me out to&mdash;to take
your&mdash;you know, Slingsby. Something went wrong, didn't it?
Something went wrong at Port Said?"</p>

<p>"Holworth wouldn't answer my cable," said Slingsby.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't answer?" cried the other.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't answer," repeated Slingsby. "I sent seven cables and
didn't get an answer."</p>

<p>The young man gave a whistle of astonishment. "Why, there's
some mess up somewhere," he cried. "Holworth sent you a score of
cables. I know he did. I was in the office, Slingsby, and I know.
He cabled you money and instructions, and why the devil you
didn't get them, I cannot tell. Where did you come from now?"</p>

<p>Slingsby forgot the crowd. He forgot the circle of passengers
and stewards. He saw only the representative of the company for
which he had worked for years, and to the young man with the
strong jaw who was going out to do the work on the El-Nar Dam
which he, Slingsby, should have done, he stammered out the story.
In a high-pitched voice, he told of the upsetting of the boat in
Port Said harbor, and of the dark-eyed woman who had advanced him
the money for cables and for board and lodging. He told the story
of Sleth of the Wonderful Ears, of the tomb that contained the
treasure and the little ears of beaten gold; and last of all, he
told how the dark-eyed woman, with the little ears pressed to the
sides of her head, had told him that she heard remarks which she
assured him were made by Holworth on board the big German
liner.</p>

<p>"She said that Holworth said that I sold the H.H. &amp; H. to
the Malbar, Fincham crowd!" he cried. "She said she heard him! I
ran three miles across the desert to get here to tell
him&mdash;to tell him that it was a lie!"</p>

<p>The young man stepped closer and gripped Slingsby's hand.</p>

<p>"Holworth didn't say it," he said. "I don't know what he
thought, Slingsby, but he didn't say it. But the woman, Slingsby?
What&mdash;what did she know of the Malbar, Fincham crowd? Eh?
And those gems? Don't you think she wanted to get rid of you just
now, Slingsby, and&mdash;faked up all that fool business about
hearing Holworth's voice? Don't you&mdash;Stop him! <i>Stop
him!</i>"</p>

<p>Slingsby had made a mad rush for the rail, and three stewards
flung themselves upon him. He tried to fight himself free, but
his efforts were futile. Despite his kicking and struggling, they
carried him into a cabin, with the young man of the H.H. &amp; H.
Company and the ship's doctor giving directions as they walked
alongside.</p>

<p>"I don't care, Slingsby," said his successor. "I don't care
what you lose. You can't do another swimming stunt tonight. And
you'd lose your way, you fool! We'll be at Suez in the morning,
and you can do what you like then."</p>

<p>Slingsby, much excited, left the German boat at Suez and came
back up the canal in an old tramp steamer bound for Alexandria.
He induced the captain of the tramp to put him ashore at the spot
where he had boarded the German boat on the previous evening, and
then Ulysses E. Slingsby started out across the desert.</p>

<p>Slingsby found the tomb and the half unwrapped form which had
been lifted from the sarcophagus on the previous day. But he
found nothing else. The dark-eyed woman and the two Arab servants
had disappeared, and with the dark-eyed woman went the mass of
blazing gems which had stupefied Slingsby through the long hours
that passed after their discovery.</p>

<p>Slingsby walked back to the canal and came up to Port Said on
a dredge belonging to the company. He was a changed man. He was
silent and bad-tempered, and answered in monosyllables the
questions that were put to him by the man aboard the dredge.</p>

<p></p>

<p>FIVE years have passed since then, and Slingsby's story has
drifted into the bazaar. He lives in the little dark room at
Al-Kasim's smelly boarding house in Pasaca Street; and there,
like an owl sitting in the semi-darkness, he passes the long day.
But when night comes down upon the "Gateway of the East,"
Slingsby goes abroad. He goes up into the Arab quarter and walks
through street after street till dawn. When Allah dips his
fingers in living chrome and draws his hand across the Eastern
sky, Slingsby returns to his room. The bazaar gossips say that he
is looking always for the woman who robbed him of his share of
the wonderful gems he found in the tomb of Sleth.</p>

<p>The Holworth, Hyde &amp; Heppler Company lost a considerable
sum of money on the El-Nar Dam. The delay caused by the
unfortunate happening to Slingsby when the hawser upset the boat
brought innumerable penalties upon them, and the Malbar, Fincham
Company have wrested from them a score of contracts  since that
time. Holworth, senior partner of the H.H. &amp; H., snorted
contemptuously when he read the story which Slingsby's
successor wrote of the meeting on board the German liner.</p>

<p>"Precious stones!" growled Holworth, on reading the letter. "I
know! That woman was in the employ of the Malbar, Fincham crowd,
and she bulldozed the fool. Glory be! What idiots men are!"</p>

<p>But Holworth may not be right. What is set down here is a
story that has lived for five years, and the life of a lie,
according to the Koran, is only as long as the life of one of the
red cactus beetles that flit for an instant in the sunshine
before they die.</p>
