<p>Production Notes:</p>
<p>Two virtual chapter headings, XIII and XIV, have been added
here to more clearly separate several distinct topics and create
links to them, while preserving the appearance of the book.</p>
<p>Two newspaper articles, one of them by Leichhardt and both
published shortly after the return of this expedition, have been
added as an Appendix to show two versions of the expedition.</p>
<p>No attempt has been made to fix inconsistencies in Bunce's
spelling of geographical or botanical names. Boecking (the cook)
is also referred to as "Bucking" and "Buckin".</p>

<hr class="2">
<p align="center"><span class="a"><u>Introduction</u></span>:</p>
<p>A biographical sketch of Ludwig Leichhardt, in "Dictionary of
Australian Biography" by Percival Serle at Project Gutenberg
Australia, is found <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogL.html#leichhardt1"><strong>
here.</strong></a> Leichardt was born 200 years ago (1813), and
arrived in Australia in 1842.</p>
<p>Leichhardt's first expedition left the Darling Downs in early
October 1844 and arrived at Port Essington in mid December 1845,
an epic overland journey of some 3000 kilometres. Leichhardt's
journal of this expedition is at Project Gutenberg Australia,
<a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks/e00030.html"><strong>here.</strong></a><br>

<br></p>
<p>Leichhardt returned to Sydney to honours and accolades in late
March 1846 and immediately began preparations for his next
expedition, intending to overland to the recently-established
colony on the Swan River in W.A. For this second expedition, he
recruited (<a href="#list">list</a>) and left from Sydney in October 1846.</p>
<p>Leichhardt's party departed the Darling Downs in December, but
only reached as far as the Peak Range (near Emerald, about 600km
NW of Brisbane) in May, 1847, where many members of the party
became ill. On petition from some of them (there being dissension),
the expedition returned in July 1847.</p>
<p>From Cecil Plains station on the Darling Downs, Leichhardt
immediately started planning his third expedition, west to the
Maranoa River, and left from there some 5 weeks later, with a
smaller party, which included Bunce. Bunce provides an account by
Leichhardt of this third expedition (virtual Chapter XIII); it
comes more or less verbatim from an article Leichhardt provided
to the <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em>, published on 11 October
1847.</p>
<p>The main interest in the present work is Bunce's account of
the Second Expedition. Apart from Bunce's, there are two more or
less contemporary accounts: one by Leichhardt himself and another
by Hovenden Hely. Travel diaries by both these men,
comprehensively edited, were published in 1989 as part of "Proud
Intrepid Heart..." by Dan Sprod. From this book, Leichhardt's
diary is now available online at <a href=
"http://leichhardt.sub.uni-goettingen.de/content/pub.html.en">Hans
Finger's comprehensive website</a>, as "Log of my Journey from
Port Stevens to Peak Range (20.10.1846-28.7.1847)", with
commentary, edited by Dan Sprod (~12Mb).</p>
<p>John Mann also wrote an account, but did not publish it until
more than forty years later.</p>
<p>Also of interest and presented here as an Appendix, are two
newspaper articles (available online at National Library of
Australia's "Trove" website), showing two versions of events. The
first, probably originating from Hely or Mann or both, was
published in the <em>Moreton Bay Courier</em> on 14 August.
Published a week later in <em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em> was
a copy of private letter Leichhardt wrote to his staunch friend,
Lt. Robert Lynd, outlining his version of events.</p>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">In</span> submitting the present work to the
notice of the public, the Author tenders his warmest thanks to
his numerous subscribers, and his apology for the delay which has
unavoidably taken place in its publication.</p>
<p>He would, also, take the present opportunity of claiming the
usual indulgence for any little shortcomings that may be apparent
in the course of its perusal. As its title imports, it is simply
a record of the incidents of travel, during a period of
twenty-three years, over a great portion of Australasia.
Statistics and dry detail have been avoided, as being more
peculiarly the task of the historian. Should it, however, afford
a few hours' amusement to the reader, the Author's object will
have been amply attained.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p align="center">TASMANIA.</p>
<p><span class="a">In</span> commencing the first chapter of the
"Reminiscences", we shall abandon the old and hackneyed style
universally adopted by all previous writers on the colony, who
usually commence with, "Tasmania is an island;" or, "This
interesting island lies between the parallels of 41 degrees 20
minutes and 43 degrees 40 minutes south, and between the
meridians 144 degrees 40 minutes, and 148 degrees 20 minutes, of
east longitude." Of course, Tasmania is an island, &amp;c. To
tell all the world this is to tell all the world what all the
world already knows, or, at least, ought to know; and, as we have
no desire to compete for the prize offered by some eccentrically
disposed individual for those who could furnish the oldest
possible news, we shall at once commence with our own
experiences.</p>
<p>It will be sufficient for our purpose, then&mdash;and, in
adopting this course, we are induced to believe that we shall the
more readily fall in with the views of our readers&mdash;if we
confine ourselves to the incidents of travel which have fallen
under our own especial observation, during a period of
twenty-three years. During the whole of this time, we have been
actively employed in developing the resources of a country more
peculiar in all its characteristics, both as regards its animal
and vegetable productions, than any other country on the face of
the globe&mdash;to furnish a narrative as novel as we anticipate
it will prove interesting to our readers.</p>
<p>We left Gravesend on the seventeenth day of October, in the
year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, in the good ship
"Ellen", of London, George Dixon, master, and reached Tasmania on
the second day of March, in the year following&mdash;that is, 2nd
March, 1833; when we cast anchor in the beautiful estuary of the
Derwent.</p>
<p>From the length of time occupied in this passage, our readers
will observe that, as we touched at no port from the commencement
to its termination, we are writing of times anterior to the
clipper ships and circle sailing, and some time prior to the tide
of emigration having set in towards the Australian shores. Among
the passengers were Mr. Eyre, since celebrated for his
exploratory exertions in South Western Australia; and Mr. Thomas
Wilkinson, late M.L.C. for the Portland Bay district, but whose
name, we anticipate, will be more permanently associated with the
annals of that and the adjoining districts as having been the
projector, proprietor, editor, printer, and pressman of the
<i>Portland Bay Guardian</i>.</p>
<p>Having landed our readers on the Tasmanian shores, we must beg
to be permitted to retrograde, for the purpose of furnishing
records of a series of important and interesting events which
occurred previously to our arrival; and, although we wish not to
be tedious, we at the same time feel that we should neither be
doing justice to our readers, to the colony, or to ourselves, if
we omitted. In doing this we shall, of course, have to be
dependent upon other testimony than our own; still, we can safely
aver that the authority will be taken from a gentleman long
deceased, who, while living, was an intimate and personal friend
of Colonel Arthur, Governor of the Colony, as well as his
successor, Sir John Franklin, and whose exertions and
lucubrations, during his residence in the colony and prior to his
melancholy death, will be long remembered. The gentleman was Dr.
James Ross; our next chapter will, consequently, have rather the
character of a compilation of events. This is, however,
necessary, from the reasons already expressed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p>A.D. 1646, <span class="a">December 1st</span>.&mdash;Abel
Jansen Tasman discovered Van Diemen's Land, and anchored the
ships "Hemskirk" and "Zeehan" in a bay to the south of Maria
Island, which he named Frederick Hendrick's Bay, and called this
country Van Diemen's Land, in honor of Athony Van Diemen, at that
time Governor-General of the Dutch possessions in the East
Indies, residing at Batavia, from which place Tasman sailed. He
also named Maria Island in memory of this Governor's daughter, to
whom he was attached. Storm Bay was so named by Tasman from his
having been nearly lost in a storm, a few days previous to his
anchoring off Maria Island.</p>
<p>1773, March 9th.&mdash;Captain Furneaux was the first
Englishman who visited Van Diemen's Land. He accompanied Captain
Cook in his second voyage round the world, from whom he was
separated, in a very thick fog, off St. Paul's Island, on the 4th
February.</p>
<p>Captain Cook, in the "Resolution", bore up for New Zealand,
and Captain Furneaux, in the "Adventure", anchored in the Bay now
so named, on the eastern side of Bruné Island, which he then
considered to be the main land, on the 11th of March. After
sailing along the eastern coast to 33 degrees south, and
discovering a cluster of islands in Bass's Straits, which now
bear his name, he left the coast for New Zealand, when he
rejoined his commander.</p>
<p>1777, January 25th.&mdash;Captain Cook, in his third voyage,
anchored in Adventure Bay, and remained five days taking in wood
and water. On his departure, he left a couple of pigs on Bruné
Island, which the natives afterwards destroyed.</p>
<p>1792, April 20th.&mdash;Admiral Bruné D'Entrecasteaux, in the
"Research", accompanied by Captain Huon Kermander, in the
"Esperance", on an expedition in search of La Perouse, anchored
in Recherche Bay. They remained upwards of a month exploring the
south-eastern coast of the island. They discovered that Bruné
Island was separated from the main land by a channel, both of
which were named after the Captain of the "Research".</p>
<p>1793, January.&mdash;The same ships again arrived from the
south coast of New Holland and Amboyna, and anchored in Recherche
Bay. They remained some time exploring the country; and, on the
14th of February, they sailed to explore D'Entrecasteaux Channel.
On the 23rd of February, both vessels anchored in Adventure Bay,
where they remained five days before sailing for the South Sea
Islands. The admiral landed a male and female goat on Bruné
Island; and also, near a remarkable tree, he deposited a bottle,
containing an account of his voyage as far as it had gone. This
bottle was afterwards found by Captain Bunker, of the ship
"Venus", in 1809. Captain Bunker, not well understanding French,
and seeing the name of La Perouse, erroneously concluded that
these papers had been deposited there by that unfortunate
nobleman. In the same year, on the 7th of May, Captain Huon died
of a fever, and was interred in the island of Pudonza, near New
Caledonia. He was succeeded in command of the "Esperance" by M.
D. Auribeau, who also died at Batavia, on the 22nd of August,
1794. Admiral D'Entrecasteaux died of cholic, near the coast of
La Louisiade, on the 21st of June, 1793. The two ships were taken
by the Dutch, and the officers and men were placed under arrest
at Samarang, in the island of Java, on the 16th of February,
1796. They were kept in confinement for upwards of a year, and
many of them died. The few who remained alive took their passage
in a small vessel for the Isle of France, and ultimately reached
Paris on the 12th of March, 1796. The only officer of note,
belonging to the voyage, who arrived home after an absence of
four years, five months, and eleven days, was Labillardiere, the
naturalist of the expedition. He afterwards published an
interesting account of this voyage, in two volumes, in which is
contained the best history of the animals and vegetables of Van
Diemen's Land that has hitherto appeared.</p>
<p>1798, February.&mdash;Dr. Bass discovered that Van Diemen's
Land was an island, being separated from New Holland by the
strait which bears his name.</p>
<p>1803, October 9th.&mdash;The ships "Calcutta" and "Ocean",
with Colonel Collins on board, arrived at Port Phillip, on the
north side of Bass's Strait, with officers and provisions, in
order to form a settlement. This position was, however,
necessarily abandoned for want of water; and, in consequence of
instructions from Governor King, at Sydney, it was determined to
transfer the expedition to Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>1803, August.&mdash;Lieutenant Bowen, in the brig Lord Nelson,
with a party from Port Jackson, was the first to take possession
of the island at Risdon, or Best Down, on the east bank of the
Derwent.</p>
<p>1804, February 19th.&mdash;Colonel Collins, the first
Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land, in the ship Ocean, from
Port Phillip, arrived in the Derwent, and soon after removed the
seat of Government from Risdon to where it now is, on the
opposite side of the river. He named it Hobart Town, after Lord
Hobart.</p>
<p>The following are the names of the officers of the Civil
Establishment originally sent out to form the settlement at Port
Phillip:&mdash;</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Collins, of H.M. Royal Marine Forces,
Lieutenant-Governor.</p>
<p>The Rev. Robert Knopwood, A.M., Chaplain.</p>
<p>Benjamin Barbauld, Esq., was appointed Deputy Judge Advocate,
by the Home Government, but did not arrive.</p>
<p>Mr. W.J. Anson, Surgeon; Mr. Matthew Bowden,
Assistant-Surgeon; and Mr. William Hopley, Second
Assistant-Surgeon. All these three gentlemen are since dead, and
their remains are interred beside each other in the churchyard in
Hobart Town.</p>
<p>Leonard Fosbrook, Deputy Assistant Commissary General. This
gentleman did not, however, long remain in the colony, but
returned home to England.</p>
<p>George P. Harris, Esq., Surveyor, dead.</p>
<p>Adolorius W. Henry Humphrey, Esq., Mineralogist, also
dead.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Clark and Mr. William Patterson were the two
Superintendents of Convicts, at a salary of £50 a-year each; both
dead.</p>
<p>Mr. John Ingle was also appointed to act in the same capacity
at Port Phillip, at the same salary. He is now residing in
England on a handsome property, which he realised in the early
period of the colony.</p>
<p>The officers who were on board H.M. ship "Calcutta", on her
voyage to Port Phillip were, Daniel Woodriff, Esq., Post Captain,
R.N.; Mr. James Tuckey, first Lieutenant; Mr. Richard Donovan,
second do.; Mr. Nicholas Paleshall, third do.; Mr. W. Doers,
fourth do.; and Mr. John Houston, fifth do.; Mr. Richard Wright,
Master; E.T. Bromley, Esq., Surgeon; and Mr. Edward White,
Purser. And of the Royal Marine Forces, Mr. Charles Menzies,
first Lieutenant, and Mr. James M'Culloch, second do.; as also
Colonel Collins, who arrived at Van Diemen's Land, with whom were
Mr. W. Hadden, first Lieutenant, Mr. J. M. Johnson, second do.,
and Mr. Edward Lord, third do. Three Sergeants, and three
Corporals, one Drummer, one Fifer, and thirty-nine Privates.</p>
<p>1804, September 25th.&mdash;The limits of the counties of
Northumberland, of Cornwall, and of Buckinghamshire, in Van
Diemen's Land, were defined by a Government order published in
the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>1804, October 15th.&mdash;Colonel Patterson sailed from Sydney
to form a new settlement, and took the command at Port Dalrymple.
On his arrival he pitched his tent at a plain on the west bank of
the Tamar, near its entrance, which he named York Town; since
abandoned.</p>
<p>1807.&mdash;During this and the previous year there was a
great dearth of provisions in this colony. Kangaroo flesh was
sold for one shilling and sixpence a pound, and that species of
sea weed, or salsolaceous plant (<i>atriplex halimus</i>), called
Botany Bay Greens, being the chief support of the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>1810, March 24th.&mdash;Lieutenant-Governor Collins died at
Hobart Town, and was buried under the altar of the church. From
this period until 1813, the Government of the colony was
administered in succession by Lieutenant Edward Lord; Captain
Murray, of the 73rd Regiment; and Lieutenant-Colonel Geils, of
the same Regiment.</p>
<p>1811, November 23rd.&mdash;Governor and Mrs. Macquarie, in the
"Lady Nelson", arrived at Hobart Town, on a visit from New South
Wales.</p>
<p>1813, February 4th.&mdash;The second Lieutenant-Governor of
this island. Colonel Thomas Davey, arrived and took command.</p>
<p>1813, June 19th.&mdash;The ports of Van Diemen's Land were
first opened for commerce, and put on the same footing as those
in New South Wales; merchant ships having, until that time, been
prohibited from entering the harbors under severe penalties.</p>
<p>1817, April 2nd.&mdash;Colonel Sorell, the third
Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land, succeeded Colonel
Davey. The latter gentleman, after remaining some years in the
colony, returned to England, where he died. Colonel Sorell was
ably assisted by Major, now Colonel Bell, C.B., of the 48th
Regiment. About the year 1819, the character of Van Diemen's Land
began to be known in England, and the emigration of free settlers
first commenced to any extent. The practice of bushranging, or
the absconding of prisoners into the woods, who subsisted by
plunder on the settlers in the interior, was, however, a serious
drawback to the progress of the colony during this
administration. Roads began to be cut through the woods, across
the island to Port Dalrymple, and the other chief settlements in
the interior. Previous to Colonel Sorell's arrival, there were no
regular roads.</p>
<p>1824, May 14th.&mdash;Colonel Arthur, the fourth
Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land, arrived, and succeeded
Colonel Sorell. The horrid practice of bushranging continued to
rage until 1826, when it was completely annihilated by the
spirited exertions of the Government. Emigration, not only of
individuals, but of considerable companies, took place from
England, and the cultivation of the island has continued to
prosper.</p>
<p>1825, May 18th.&mdash;His Majesty appointed the Rev. Thomas
Heber Scott to be the first Archdeacon of New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land. The penal settlement, afterwards called
Darlington, at Maria Island, was established this year. The Van
Diemen's Land Company's establishments at Circular Head, were
commenced about this time.</p>
<p>1825, November 24th.&mdash;Lieutenant-General Ralph Darling
arrived at Hobart Town with a despatch, dated Carlton House, June
14th, proclaiming Van Diemen's Land to be independent of the
Government of New South Wales.</p>
<p>1827.&mdash;The colony was divided into nine police districts,
and a magistrate appointed over each, with adequate salaries; in
place of every magistrate in the colony, as before that time,
having a salary of eighty pounds a-year, whether he acted or
not.</p>
<p>1830, April 16th.&mdash;Archdeacon Broughton, the second
Archdeacon of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, delivered
his first charge in St. David's Church. October.&mdash;A
steam-engine was first introduced into the colony, and
successfully set a-going as a flour-mill, on the wharf, by Mr.
John Walker. November.&mdash;White runaway convicts found among
the blacks in the woods, leading and directing them to commit
outrages on the white population.</p>
<p>Having now furnished what we consider to be an ample
chronological view of colonial events up to this period, and
which was absolutely necessary in carrying out our Tasmania
history, we will, with the reader's permission, commence the next
chapter with our own experiences.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p><span class="a">On</span> landing, our first step was to
produce our credentials, or letters of introduction, among
others, to Captain John Montague, the Colonial Secretary;
Governor Arthur; and one to a Wm. Cleavy Browne, Esq., who had
just commenced a large and extensive timber and saw mill, at the
foot of Mount Wellington, called Sassafraz Valley. This gentleman
kindly furnished me with a letter to his overseer. Thus provided,
we were enabled to examine the botanically interesting features
of Mount Wellington. We were accompanied with one or two of our
fellow-passengers, who, being like myself, new chums, were
desirous of seeing something of the country. Our objects in the
journey were, however, different: mine being to obtain specimens
and seed of the flora; and theirs to shoot</p>
<p class="poem">"That emblem of Australia,<br>
Genus <i>macropus</i>, class mammalia"&mdash;</p>
<p>colonially speaking, "Kangaroos flying".</p>
<p>To reach Mr. Browne's establishment, we passed through
Providence Valley, where Mr. Shoebridge had a healthy young hop
plantation, to Kangaroo bottom; and thence to Sassafraz Valley,
having on our right hand the New Town rivulet, whose banks were
lined with shrubs and plants of surpassing luxuriance. The most
conspicuous was the sassafraz tree, of a tall pyramidal growth,
and whose leaves emitted a most agreeable aromatic odour on the
crushing the pustules of volatile oil with which they were
surcharged. We observed that, in many cases, large flakes of bark
had been stripped from the trunks of the largest trees. On
inquiry, we discovered that the inhabitants were in the habit of
thus collecting and boiling the bark, and using the decoction as
an antiscorbutic, as a substitute for the sarsaparilla. This
beautiful tree, <i>Cryptocarya glaucescens</i> belongs to the
class <i>Enneandria</i>; order, <i>Monogynnia</i>, of Linnæus;
and <i>Lauracea</i>, of <i>Jussieu, Dodonea, Decaspora, Pimeliâ,
Cyathodes, Prostanthera, Lomatia, Indigofera, Banksia, Correa,
Pomaderris, Sida, Pittosporum, Phebalium, Ozothamnus,
Leptospermum</i> were the leading genera or family of the shrubs
which fringed the banks and dipped their lower branches in the
pure fast-running stream of the rivulet. In many cases, there
were several species of the genera named, but which we need not
recapitulate, as our readers can have access to the "Botany",
which accompanies the "History", and will be published in a
separate form. On the dry barren hills over which we had to
travel, the trees were principally gum, or several species of the
<i>eucalyptus</i>; but these trees, in their growth, formed a
remarkable contrast to the sassafraz and other trees, growing in
the immediate neighbourhood of the rivulet. The appearance of the
former was rather that of a series of large inanimate trunks,
around which were clinging that dainty plant, or ivy green, of
Charles Dickens. This was found to be owing to the periodical
bush fires, which prevented a free growth of the tree; and the
current of the sap being thus checked, produce a numerous progeny
of small branches, which, being attached to the butts and stems
of the tree, present a most unusual and singular appearance.
Common also to the poor, rocky patches of soil, was a singularly
beautiful and interesting race of dwarf shrubs, annuals, and
herbaceous plants: <i>Daviesia latifolia</i> (native hop),
<i>Hibbertia, Pimelia, Hypoxis, Goodinovia, Xyrus, Lobelia</i>.
This little, beautifully cerulian blue, flowering annual, has the
singular property of dying gradually from the roots upwards; and,
although absolutely dead below, the upper part of the plant is in
full bloom and healthy. <i>Cynoglossum, Dillwynnia, Stylidium,
Pultnea, Stackhousiâ, Anthobulus, Leucopogon, Diannella,
Disandriâ,</i> with <i>Pterostylus, Acianthus</i>, and sundry
other of the terrestrial <i>Orchidacæ</i>.</p>
<p>During the time I was examining and putting by some of the
most interesting specimens of the plants named into my portfolio,
one of my companions had selected a small hillock of dry soil,
intending to rest himself in the interim. He had scarcely seated
himself, when he felt a numbing sensation; and, on rising, it was
discovered that he had mistaken his position, having selected and
besieged the dormitory of a nest of old soldier ants, and was
bitten by one of these pugnacious insects, in return for his
temerity. On reaching Sassafraz Valley, we were kindly received
by Mr. Browne's overseer; and every preparation was made for a
nocturnal excursion, in which they anticipated some little
amusement in opossum shooting, and killing the devil, as an
animal peculiar to this island was colonially termed, but
scientifically known as a species of <i>Dasyuris</i>. One of
these animals we subsequently saw at the Government Gardens, near
the banks of the Derwent. It had been taken in a trap, by one of
Mr. Davidson's, the superintendent's, men. This animal was
confined in an iron cage, and fed with a stable fork, as it was
unsafe to approach it. Although many attempts had been made to
tame it during the course of eleven months, they did not succeed;
and it was afterwards sent home, under the care of Captain
Riddell, of the "Duckenfield", as a present to the Surrey
Zoological Gardens, where it lived for many years, and may
perhaps be still alive. The devil is carnivorous, and its habits
otherwise resemble the English badger. Browne's huts were
admirably situated for the kind of sport that my friends
anticipated. A few hours after moon-rise, they sallied forth,
with deadly intent, and on "evil purpose" bent against the poor
harmless opossums and other game; one pouch bearing brute would
doubtless have missed the number of his mess but for the kind
interference of one of the feathered race; for, just as our
sportsman, fresh from the legal precincts of Grey's Inn Square,
was taking a probably deadly aim, the solitary and melancholy
note of "More pork! more pork!" from the Cyclopean or Australian
owl, interposed most opportunely in warding off the shot, as,
while Mr. S. lowered his gun, and made nervous enquiries as to
the cause of the sounds, the opossum disappeared into some hollow
part of the gum-tree, and was lost sight of. Although our
companions brought back <i>nothing</i> as the result of their
night's exertions, one of our dogs had made a dead set at
<i>something</i>, at which he continued barking. Our disappointed
sportsman made a grab at what he considered to be a prostrate
opossum; but quickly withdrew his hands, at finding that his
digits had alighted upon nothing less than the "the quills upon a
fretful porcupine." (<i>Echidna Australis</i>.) At this
additional dilemma to the ant-hill, and the loss of the opossum,
he appeared to entertain but an indifferent opinion as regarded
the colonial game. One of Mr. Browne's men, who accompanied us
(after a manner peculiar to himself), succeeded in capturing and
taking back with him the porcupine, which, on again reaching the
huts, was very nicely roasted or baked in a coating of mud, and,
when cooked in this manner, was most delicious, with the addition
of green peas, the produce of the gardens at Sassafraz
Valley.</p>
<p>On the following morning, we made a clear start for the top of
Mount Wellington, to reach the summit of which we had to
accomplish an elevation of four thousand feet. For the first half
mile, the ascent was difficult, and rendered it necessary to hang
on (to use a nautical expression) by the eyelids, when we reached
a flat open spot of moist rich alluvial soil, rich in many plants
not seen at the foot of the Mount. <i>Gaultheria hispida</i>
(wax-cluster)&mdash;this plant was laden with its beautiful
clusters of pure white semi-transparent wax-like berries.</p>
<p><i>Euphrazia, Billarderia scandens</i>, with its perpetually
covered masses of blue spindle-shaped fruit or berries, was
hanging in festoons around the branches of the neighbouring
shrubs, which rendered it at times difficult to determine the
character of plant to which it was attached. This beautiful
climber is easily cultivated. The blueish purple berries hang in
elegant festoons for several months during the latter part of the
season; while, during the earlier months, its pretty cylindrical
blossoms make it a desirable acquisition as a climber about a
verandah, or wall of a house. During the course of our ascent
towards the top of the mountain, we observed a marked difference
in the character of the vegetable features; and in the middle
regions, the plants totally differed from those at the base, and
the vegetation which clothed the top-summit. Among the broken
declivities, commencing at about 1500 feet to that of 3000 feet,
where we met with running waters, its sure accompaniment was the
smaller tree fern, <i>Cibotium, Billarderia</i>, mixed with many
plants of the larger arborescent fern, <i>Alsophilla
Australis</i>, from <i>alsos</i> and <i>phileo</i>, because it
delights in groves. The latter plant had stems from twenty to
thirty feet high, clear and straight, from the top of which
issued a circular series of fern-like foliage, giving to the
landscape a somewhat tropical appearance. <i>Telopia
Tasmaniana</i>, Tasmanian warratah, with gorgeously showy crimson
flowers and foliage, resembling the rhododendron. The name of the
genus is from <i>telopos</i>, seen at a distance, as the
brilliancy and quantity of the blossoms makes it an object
discernable from a distance in the bush. With much difficulty we
reached the summit, where my legal companion anticipated a
release from the annoyance of leeches, which had attacked and
annoyed him considerably during our passage through the swampy
and dank atmosphere of the tree-fern locality.</p>
<p>On arriving at the top of the mount, we found ourselves on an
extensive table-land, with nothing but a stunted vegetation and a
continued interruption of pools of water, abounding in aquatic
plants. The. general surface was covered with a great variety of
the yellow flowering <i>Composite</i> order of plants; and a new
species of <i>Craspedia</i> had, but a short time previously,
been taken from hence, and forwarded for the determination of Sir
William Jackson Hooker, of Kew Gardens. To this species he gave
the specific name of <i>Grandiflora, Bellendina</i>, mountain
rocket; <i>Leptospermum prostrata</i>, a prostrate species of
tea-tree. This procumbent character appeared, however, to be
rather the consequence of the continued blowing of strong winds,
than from a natural growth. Among the Alpine pastures were
<i>Bellis, Lycopodium</i> (club-moss), <i>Asplenium assimile</i>
(maiden hair-fern), <i>Asplenium alcicorne</i> (hartshorn leaved)
<i>asplenium, Nastirtium, Sempinnatifidum, Cardamine</i> (smell
mock), <i>Galium, Stenanthera, Xerotes longifolia, Xiphopteris
heterophylla</i> (various-leaved fern), <i>Viola, Veronica</i>
(two pretty species of speedwell), <i>Euphrazia alpina</i> (a
pretty, small-growing annual), <i>Isolepis</i>, and many others
of the rush tribe; <i>Fimbristylus</i>, and many species of the
sedgy plants. From the top, an extensive view was obtained of the
harbor, with the shipping, and, indeed, a bird's eye view of the
surrounding country. On travelling over the top, in the direction
of the head of the Huon river, we passed two remarkable-looking
boulders of rock, of considerable elevation. On the top of them
rested another stone, of magnificent proportions; thus forming a
kind of Druidical archway. Shortly after passing this remarkable
object, we commenced a sort of leap-frog journey over three or
four miles of large disjointed granite boulders; and at an
unknown depth, we could hear the roaring of a mighty torrent of
waters immediately beneath us. I am altogether lame at
description, although anxious to describe scenes in nature
sublime and unusual as the present. It will be sufficient to say
that, for the distance named, we hopped, leaped, and jumped over
a continued series of gigantic pebbles, among which was running a
large and boiling stream of water, occasioned by the melting of
snows, and which we found, on descending the Browne's river side
of the mountain, formed into one continuous stream, called the
Huon river. About two miles before reaching the head of this
river, we subsequently discovered that another branch of these
waters formed the source of Browne's river. On reaching the Huon
river, we camped for the night, amid dark <i>Cryptogamic</i>
vegetation, abounding in leeches, who paid their respects to our
unfortunate companion. Among the boulders of rock, we obtained
some interesting specimens of the <i>Orchidia</i>; three
different specimens of <i>Dendrobium</i>; lichens innumerable;
mosses and ferns abundantly attached to the face of the rocks. A
few months prior to our visit, a party of officers and gentlemen
belonging to the Steamer, 'Sea Horse' had taken an excursion to
Mount Wellington; and one of the junior officers was missed, and
has never since been heard of. At the time of their visit, these
rocks must have been clothed with their winter's covering of
snow; and, in all probability, the unfortunate youth may have
slipped through one of the many fissures of the rock, and into
the boiling torrent of waters below.</p>
<p>On commencing our next day's journey, we travelled for a short
distance, following the course of the Huon Kiver, being desirous
of seeing the tree, which has been long used, and still furnishes
the handsomest colonial material for veneering and other fine
cabinet-makers' work. This wood takes a fine polish, and is an
improvement on the bird's-eye maple. Its botanical name is
<i>Dacrydium cupressimum</i>, or cypress-like; its generic name
is derived from <i>dakru</i>, a tear, because the gummy
exudations drop like tears from the tips of the little branches.
We saw many samples of this beautifully pyramidal tree, which had
attained to the height of from between ninety-five to one hundred
feet, and thirty feet in circumference, extending its limbs to a
great distance, from which hang slender branchlets of the
liveliest green, from one to six feet long, giving the trees a
richness and elegance of appearance seldom equalled.</p>
<p>The rare plant, and only to be found in this particular
neighborhood, was here met with in all its grandeur. I mean the
<i>Richia dracophylla</i>, or tall grass tree. These trees have
many straggling branches, and numerous smaller heads at the
termination of each shoot. From the centres of these spring its
beautiful spikes of white flowers, with shades of white, pink and
green, upon the larger <i>bracteæ</i>, which are interspersed
among them in their early stages. It is decidedly the most
strikingly beautiful of all the Van Diemen's Land plants. Here
also the <i>Betula antarctica</i>, or Australian myrtle, as it is
most incorrectly called (it is not a <i>Betula</i> or birch; it
appears that the young shoots in their earlier stage had been
mistaken for the male blossom by the English botanists), is seen
to advantage. On our way back to Hobart Town, it was necessary to
abandon the Huon River, and as well as also to avoid having to
cross Browne's River, we had to hug that side of the mountain
which faced the town, an operation which my fat and uncomfortable
friend decided to be a difficult operation, and in his progress
downwards his movements were somewhat like those of an eel upon
ice. After falling down sundry declivities and through a flat
floor of tree-fern leaves, which he had mistaken for solid moss
and lichen-covered ground, we succeeded in reaching the upper
cascade, or springs would be the more proper appellation. It is
from this that the Hobart Town rivulet takes its rise, which,
after running through the property of Mr. Peter Degraves, and
acting as a motive power to his saw-mills and other machines,
quietly pursues its way past the Female Factory, and subsequently
through the town of Hobart, affording to the inhabitants a
plentiful supply of water. On reaching the upper cascade, we
camped among the butts of the <i>Acacia affinis</i>, or silver
wattle, which here attained a growth of great magnitude, and
rivalling in height and far exceeding in beauty the stupendous
gum-trees among which they grow. The butts of these trees, as
well as those of the gum, sassafraz, and myrtle-trees, bore
initials and names of former travellers who had succeeded in
reaching thus far in their ascent from Hobart Town. This was a
distinction which we considered due to our fellow-traveller, in
consequence of the injuries sustained in his journey on this
occasion; and he was induced to carve his own initials, J.B.S.,
on the butt of a stupendous silver wattle-tree. These initials
may still be remaining, although we regret to say that the
gentleman himself has passed into another and, we trust, a better
world. His death occurred about fifteen months since, in Hobart
Town. On our downward course, we passed through forests of the
black and silver wattle, around which was clinging the clematis;
<i>Flamula</i>, or white virgin's bower. Their rope-like stems
varying in size from that of a small quill to a man's arm and, in
the latter case, suspending its fine wide-spreading blossoms like
a white cloth on the top of the highest trees, with the rope, or
cable-like jointed stems, hanging down to, or rather growing out
of, the ground. In these situations, as it does not embrace the
tree, it would seem to have arisen and grown along with it. The
whirl-leaved or prickled accacia (<i>A. verticillata</i>), so
called from its sharp-pointed leaves standing out in whirls round
its stem like the spokes of a wheel, was common, wherever a
moist, sheltered situation was to be obtained. <i>A.
lancifolia</i>, and many other species of the entire or integral
leaved wattles, around which was clinging and hanging, in elegant
festoons, our old friend of the Browne's huts' side of the
mountain, the <i>Billarderia scandens, Pimelia linifolia</i>, or
flax-leaved <i>pimelia</i>. We afterwards found that, in the
course of preservation of these specimens, the leaves and stems
turned of a deep vitriol greenish blue. <i>Veronica labiata V.
formosa</i>, were also met with in the vicinity of the water. The
blue gum trees here are of a stupendous growth, attaining the
height of from 100 to 150 feet, with tall, straight, cylindrical
barrels, until within a few feet of the top.</p>
<p>This noble genus, on the whole, may be said to have taken
undisturbed possession of these Australian regions, clothing, as
it does, with its stupendous mantle, the surface of both Van
Diemen's Land and Australia. For the intermixture which the
lordly tribe occasionally permits, compared with its great
extent, is but small and partial. Where-ever you go, the
gum-tree, of one species or other presents itself. The wood of
all the species is highly useful for domestic and other purposes.
They are soft at first, and very easily cut down and sawed or
split up when green; but when thoroughly dry are as hard as oak.
They are all of a remarkably quick growth, and many of the
species attain an enormous growth, as previously described.
<i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> and some other species have file
remarkable property of casting off the grey or whitish bark in
longitudinal strips or ribands, which sometimes hang down from
the branches, and are shaken about with a singular effect, until
stripped off by the winds. The leaves are thus seen on both
sides, and present their edges to the body of the trunk or
branches to which they belong. The leaves grow in size with the
wood, being at first small and scarcely formed, with a reddish
yellow tinge, giving to the leaves of young trees, even in.
spring, the landscape tints of an English autumn. Several of the
species yield an exudation in the spring and summer months, which
coagulates, and drops from the leaves to the ground in small
irregular particles, often as large as an almond. They are sweet
and pleasant to the taste, and greedily devoured by the birds,
ants, and other animals, and used to be carefully picked up and
eaten by the aborigines. This is a sort of manna. The genus is
named from <i>eu</i> (well), and <i>kalupto</i> (to cover), from
the circumstance of the blossom being covered with a lid, which,
when the flower expands, falls off and discloses a five-celled
capsule, or seed-vessel, each filled with numerous small seeds.
The common name of gum-tree was given the genus from the large
quantities of strong astringent juice which the trees contained.
In cutting down a stringy-bark tree, for instance (<i>E.
robusta</i>), we often find large cavities between the annual
concentric circles of the trunk, filled with a most beautiful
red, or rich vermillion-colored liquid gum, which flows out as
soon as the saw has afforded it an opening. The gum yielded by
<i>E. resinifera</i> is considered by druggists as not in the
least inferior to the kind which the <i>pterocarpus</i>, or red
Saunder's wood of India produces.</p>
<p>In approaching through the wattle forest, again, towards
Degrave's establishment, we found that the long, hollow,
cylindrical barrels had been converted into water-pipes for the
use of the saw-mills, and through which ran a clear stream of
water. These pipes also afforded excellent substitutes for
bridges, where-ever it was necessary for a road to be made for
the timber-trucks, and thus prevented any injury to the
mill-stream or current, which supplied the mills. Clinging to the
butts of the large fern trees which formed avenues on either hand
of the water-courses, about the middle regions of the mount,
there were many small but interesting parasitical plants, as well
as <i>Epiphites, Dendrobium, Lingueformi</i> (tongue-leaved),
named from <i>dendron</i>, a tree, from its peculiar habit of
being mostly attached to trees, instead, as is the case with many
of the orchides, to moss-covered blocks of rocks; <i>Asplenium
flabelliformis, Polypodium, Billardieria</i>, climbing polypody;
<i>P. rugulosum</i>; rough ditto <i>Ferns</i>, with the
fructification in circular naked dots, which climb over rocks,
and the stems of trees, like ivy; <i>Psilotum truncatum</i>,
among the rocks; <i>Pteris vespertilionis</i>, a fern, with
leaves resembling the wings of a bat; P. esculenta, edible
rooted, and many others, belonging to the twenty-fourth class of
Linnæus. On our way to the town, we passed Degrave's saw mills;
and from thence, having the Hobart Town rivulet on our left-hand,
we passed the newly-built female factory, or penitentiary; Mr.
Hodgson's tannery; and the villa of Dynnyrne, the residence of
Mr. Robert Lathrop Murray; and parallel with Liverpool-street,
the flour-mills of Mr. Bruford. Although the rivulet or creek had
now commenced its course through the metropolis, its banks still
furnished an interesting and luxuriant growth of shrubs and other
plants, the principal being the <i>Leptospermum lanigerum</i>, or
hoary tea-tree, a genera of <i>myrtaceous</i> plants, of which
Van Diemen's Land numbers several species. <i>L. lanigerum</i> is
the one which, in the earlier period of the colony, was used as a
substitute for tea, and the long straight stems were used by the
aborigines for making their spears; hardening their points in the
fire, and sharpening them with a flint or shell.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p><span class="a">Hobart Town</span> was so named by Colonel
Collins, the first Lieutenant-Governor, in compliment to Lord
Hobart, at that time Secretary of State for the Colonies.
Collins-street, named after Colonel Collins, was the first street
that was begun to be built.</p>
<p>Macquarie-street was named by Governor Macquarie after
himself; Elizabeth-street and Campbell-streets were named after
the maiden name of Mrs. Macquarie, daughter of General Campbell.
He also named Argyle-street, in memory of his native county of
that name, in Scotland. He named Murray-street after Captain
Murray, of the 73rd Regiment; and Harrington-street, after the
Earl of Harrington, who was Colonel of that Regiment; the name of
Barrack-street, as leading to the Military Barracks. Molle-street
commemorates the name of Colonel Molle, of the 48th; and
Antill-street beyond, that of Major Antill of the same Regiment,
and Brigadier-Major to Governor Macquarie. Davey-street was named
in memory of the late Colonel Davey, Lieutenant-Governor;
Liverpool-street, after the late Earl of Liverpool;
Bathurst-street, after the Earl of Bathurst, at that time
Secretary for the Colonies; Melville-street, after: Lord
Melville; Brisbane-street, after Governor Brisbane. St.
Patrick-street was so named at the request of the Rev. P.
Conolly, the Roman Catholic chapel being situated in it.
Warwick-street was named by Mr. Evans, late Surveyor-General, in
memory of Warwick Castle, in which that gentleman first saw the
light.</p>
<p>The ground on which the town is built is of unequal surface:
the rivulet running through the centre of it extends over seven
hills, as many as ancient Rome, and covers upwards of a square
mile. The Government Garden was approached through the Government
Domain, at Macquarie Point, a promontory of that name so called.
The Gardens were pleasantly situated on the banks of the river
Derwent. A hot-house and green-house had been erected some few
years previous to our arrival in the colony, containing many new
and useful exotic plants; and the whole of the grounds were ably
managed by the Superintendent, Mr. Davidson; and it was on this
occasion that Mr. Davidson submitted to our notice the
<i>Dasyuris</i>, or native hyæna, or devil, alluded to in a
former chapter. On leaving Hobart Town we reach New Town and
Glenorchy, having the bluff sides of Mount Wellington frowning
upon us about five miles distant, on our left-hand. About a mile
and a half or two miles from here, a small road turned off to the
right-hand, leading to the lower part of New Town; we, however,
made a detour to the left-hand, to inspect the flora peculiar to
the level of Hobart Town, and how far the washing of Mount
Wellington may have affected the sub-Alpine vegetation. On the
pasture lands were many of the pretty bulbous plants called Star
of Bethlehem by the colonists, but by botanists known as
<i>Anguillaria</i>, of which two species clothed the pasture;
namely, <i>A. di&oelig;cia</i> and <i>A. uniflora</i>, or one
flowered; <i>Stylidium</i> (native Jack in a box). Three species
were abundant. This genus is remarkable for the singular
elasticity of the column <i>styles</i>, which support the
anthers, and which, being irritable, will spring up if touched
with a pin, or other little substance, below the joint, before
the pollen, or male powder, is shed, throwing itself suddenly
over, like a reflex arm, to the opposite side of the flower.
Hence the colonial designation of Jack in a box. <i>Stackhousia
viminea</i> and <i>S. monogynia</i>, pretty dwarf plants, having
long spikes of sweetly-scented. Hyacinth-like blossom. <i>Viola,
Betonicafolia, Betony</i>, leaved, and <i>V. Hederacea</i>,
trailing, stemmed violet; both species have light-colored
scentless blossoms; Veronica calycina, <i>V. plebia</i>, two
dwarf species of speedwell, <i>Craspedia glauca, C. plebia</i>,
two composite plants, which we subsequently discovered to form a
universal ornament in all parts of the colony where a similarity
of soil presented itself; <i>Clematis gentianoides; Gentian</i>,
like clematis, a dwarf, erect-growing species, with entire or
slightly-toothed leaves, and white four or five-leaved fragrant
blossoms, of the size of a white anemone; <i>Convolvulus
erubescens</i>, maiden's blush convolvulus, or morning glory;
<i>Boronia variabilis</i>, a small heath-like plant, covered with
pink, and sometimes faint-white blossoms during a greater part of
the year. The aborigines, or human baboons, as they have, on many
occasions, been most inhumanly, termed, by the English writers,
were in the habit of naming their wives and daughters after it,
from its rare beauty; in the same manner as we, their more
cultivated brethren, have done with the rose and other favorite
plants. <i>Ranunculus</i>, (crows-foot, or buttercups of the
colony), adorned the pastures with their brilliant yellow
blossoms; many of the orchis family were also common&mdash;the
native potatoe (<i>Gastrodia sessamoides</i>). This is a curious
plant, belonging to the <i>Orchis</i> tribe, the tubers of which
when it obtains a favorable situation about the root of a decayed
tree, are often found in large clusters. The pretty bluish white
flowering annuals, <i>Euphrazia</i>, or <i>Eyebright</i>;
Geranium <i>potentilloides potentilla</i>, like geraniums, with
small inconspicuous blossoms; <i>Hyopoxis hygrometrica</i>,
weather-glass <i>Hypoxis</i>, and <i>H. pratensis</i>, meadow
<i>Hypoxis</i>, small plants, with bright, yellow, gem-like,
six-petalled blossoms; <i>Kennedia procumbens</i>, a three-leaved
trailing plant, with bright scarlet pea flowers. Along the banks
of this lower course of the creek or rivulet were Goodenia, three
species, a genus of singular, irregular, bright yellow flowering
plants, growing in damp places, and by the sides of streams. The
corolla is five-cleft, and are longitudinally split, pushing
forth the stamens in a cluster outside. The free growing verdant
leaves of the first species, bearing yellow blossoms almost all
the year, have made it a favorite in the gardens of Hobart Town.
<i>Goodia pubescens</i> native laburnum; <i>Decaspora
disticha</i> and <i>Thymifolia</i>, the first two-leaved, and the
latter the thyme-leaved <i>Decaspora; Dipplarh&oelig;na
morea</i>, a flag-leaved plant, with iris-like blossoms;
<i>Zierria arborescens</i>, tree Zierria, This is a tall handsome
shrub, with pretty, four-petalled white and pink blossoms, and
trifoliate spear-shaped verdant leaver. The leaves, especially
when rubbed, have a strong, rank, aromatic smell, like hemlock,
which at first is rather unpleasant, but, when repeated, becomes
refreshing, and will serve, in some degree, to relieve a nervous
headache. <i>Culcitium linariafolium</i>, a shrub with woolly
leaves, and clusters of composite yellow blossoms, smelling like
honey.</p>
<p>About four miles and a half from Hobart Town, on the
Launceston Road, is O'Brien's Bridge, and the beautiful little
stream called Humphray's rivulet; and, a little beyond the
seventh mile-stone, we crossed Roseneath Ferry, where Mr. Austin
kept an inn and an excellent garden for the accommodation of
visitors and travellers. After travelling sixteen miles from
Hobart Town, we reached the town of Brighton, whose original name
was Stony Plains. There was a branch-road from this leading to
the coal river, passing through the tea-tree brush. This
branch-path joined the Coal river-road from Richmond, through
Jerusalem to Jericho. To the left of Brighton lay the black
brush, watered by the river Jordan, whose banks were covered with
small farms, in a high state of cultivation. By following this
road, we reached the river Jordan, where there was a settlement
called Broadmarsh; and, a short distance beyond Mr. Murdock's
farm, the road ceased to be passable for a wheeled vehicle. After
leaving Brighton, the traveller passes through about eight miles
of level country, through the fertile district of Bagdad, until
reaching the foot of Constitution Hill. From thence to the very
neat farm and garden of Mr. John Espie, of Bagdad, our road was
through a number of small and well-cultivated farms. After
leaving the valley of the Jordan, we crossed Constitution Hill.
The small stream which waters the vale of Bagdad takes its rise
almost ten miles to the eastward of this hill. Near its source it
is precipitated down a perpendicular fall of at least seventy
feet. There is a remarkable high stony eminence, called the
Barren Kock, close to the waterfall. On descending the north side
of Constitution Hill, there are two lofty sugar-loaf hills, one
on each hand, which may be seen from Hobart Town. To accomplish
this ascent and descent, you have three miles of hard and
difficult travelling, which brings you to a valley called the
Green Ponds.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine miles from Hobart Town, you reach the Cross marsh,
where was an inn called the Royal Oak. Close by this inn a road
turned off to the right, and passing through the romantic valley,
or rather ravine, called Serpentine Valley, with sandstone rocks
overhanging on each side. Among these rocks and the sandy soil,
which was the natural characteristic here of the country for some
miles, we found the usual difference which characterises the
botanical features. <i>Xanthorria</i>, or grass-tree, three
species of which enlivened the landscape with their scapigerous
white blossoms. <i>X. Australis</i>, <i>X. humilis</i>, and <i>X.
arborea</i>, or larger grass-tree, with its remarkable strong,
grassy, or bent-like leaves, sending up a very long scape, or
club-like head, to the height of four to five feet, and exuding a
resinous gum, said to possess, in a great degree, the virtue of
the dragon's blood of the <i>Pterocarpus</i> and <i>Calamus</i>.
As it grows from year to year, this gum continues to exude, so as
to be easily collected in large quantities. In 1825, when Captain
Smith, of the "Caledonia", was at Western Port, he discovered a
quantity of it, and, by boiling it with oil, made a very good and
cheap composition for covering the bottom of his vessel, instead
of pitch. The aboriginal natives were in the habit of cutting out
and eating the heart or pith. <i>Leucopogon, Xerotes</i>, and
<i>Veronica</i> were beautifully in bloom at the time we visited
this place. Cats are very fond of this plant, <i>Drosera
peltata</i>, shield-leaved sundew, throwing up a stem about a
foot high, terminated by a few pink blossoms. Its stem is clothed
with shield-shaped leaves, upon footstalks inserted into the
backs of the leaves, which are covered with hair, bearing on
their points small pellucid bulbs, like drops of dew
(<i>drosos</i>). In most of the species, their leaves are very
irritable, closing upon small insects that touch them, after
which the leaf bends and holds them fast. <i>Diuris,
Pterostylus</i>, and others of the orchis tribe, were common
among the soil between the rocks, and upon the small bulbs of
which the little bandicoots had evidently been regaling, from the
disturbed appearance of the soil which they had rooted up with
their small-pointed noses, or snouts, in search of the small
bulbous roots, their favorite food. <i>Anthericum semibarbata</i>
was here in bloom, as well as the <i>Dianella</i>. The flag-like
leaves of this plant are made into baskets by the aborigines.
They are prepared by being drawn over a fire, which softens and
renders them more flexible for the purpose. <i>Cynoglossum
Australis</i>, a plant from one and a half to two feet high, with
blue flowers, resembling the forget-me-not of England, named from
<i>kano</i>, a dog, and <i>glossa</i>, a tongue, because the long
soft leaves are thought to resemble the tongue of a dog. The
<i>Bursaria spinosa</i> was also to be met with on the dryer
parts of the valley. This beautiful shrub, however, is common
throughout this island. It has already been introduced into the
conservatories in England, to which its elegant odoriferous
blossoms are a great ornament. The capsules, or seed-vessels,
resemble those of the common weed, <i>Thlaspi bursa pastoris</i>,
of Britain, so much that Labillardiere fancied he had found a
cruciferous tree, when he first discovered it at Recherche Bay.
<i>Astroloma humifusum</i>, a native cranberry, was frequent,
with a few species of the <i>Aster</i>. The ferns were
<i>Allantodia Australis</i>, with oblong "sori", as the dots or
patches of fructification are botanically called, covered with an
enclosed membrane (<i>involucrum</i>) opening from the veins, and
also, when situated near the margin or back of the frond or leaf,
opening inwards. It derives its name from <i>allantos</i>, a
sausage, to which the arched quality gives it some resemblance.
This romantic road led us to the main Launceston-road, near the
thirty-seventh milestone.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<p><span class="a">Passing</span> through the country called
Lovely Banks, over Spring Hill, which we found to be a
continuation of a high range, stretching across from the Jordan
river to the east; and the ground appeared to be tolerably well
clothed with grass and herbs, and many plants, which we soon
discovered to be of a different genus to those previously seen.
<i>Leucopogon</i>, three species; <i>Cryptandria, Disandria,
Leptomeria</i>, a low broom-like shrub with white blossoms, and
green acid berries; <i>Epacris</i>, and many others, of which the
last-named genus form the type. From the country of the river
Jordan we reached Jericho, and crossed the Jordan upon a rude
wooden bridge of two arches. By following up the river to our
right hand, we reached the source of this Orientially-named
stream, passing, on our way, several well cultivated farms.</p>
<p>The river Jordan takes its rise from a large lagoon, eight
miles and a half in circumference, formerly called Lemon's Swamp,
from a noted bushranger of that name, who haunted the
neighbourhood. On the borders of this lagoon the unfortunate Mrs.
Gough and child, with Ann Gray, were killed by the blacks.</p>
<p>This lagoon was covered with rushes and reeds, and, among
them, many interesting acquatic plants&mdash;<i>Valisneria
spiralis, Valisneria nana</i>. The former is a singular plant,
growing at the bottom of the shallowest part of the lagoon. Its
flowers were not striking for their beauty; but they are produced
on spiral footstalks, which contract like a spring, after
flowering and carrying the seed to the bottom of the water.
<i>Villarsia reniformis</i> and <i>V. parnassifolius</i>, plants
with handsome yellow-fringed blossoms and round leaves, several
species of the <i>Sedge</i> tribe, &amp;c. Jericho was merely a
small hamlet, consisting, at the time of our visit, of eight
houses and of three grants, and no more. About a mile from the
inn we arrived at the beautiful circular plain called
Fourteen-tree Plain, so named from fourteen gum-trees growing in
a clump in the centre.</p>
<p>At the distance of fifty miles from town, we reached Oatlands,
a township situated on the borders of a fine lagoon, called Lake
Frederick. Half way between Jericho and Oatlands we found Lemon's
Springs, contiguous to which we observed a small-peaked hill,
where the bushranger, Lemon, from which the place was named, used
to lie in ambush, and make his attacks upon the passengers. Five
miles to the west of Oatlands, was Michael Howes's Swamp, or
Marsh, formerly the resort of that desperado, and where he
resided for many months with the native black girl, Mary, whom he
afterwards barbarously shot. About two miles from Oatlands, we
entered upon a beautiful tract of country called York Plains, and
from which, for three or four additional miles, the road was
delightful. The land was thinly timbered, and presented to the
eye picturesque groups of trees in the midst of verdant valleys
and lawns. The trees forming the most interesting groups were the
<i>Casuarina torulosa</i> she-oak; and <i>C. stricta</i>, he-oak.
It is needless to say that these trees are in no way allied to
the true oak, <i>Quercus</i>, of Britain. The name of the first
is said to have been derived from "sheeac", the name of an
American tree, producing the beef-wood like our she-oak. <i>C.
stricta</i>, or he-oak, has been named in contradistinction to
the sexes, as if they constituted one di&oelig;cious plant, the
one male and the other female, whereas they are two perfectly
distinct species. In many cases, among the groups of the
<i>Cassuarina</i>, the <i>Exocarpus cupressiformis</i> (native
cherry), had intruded itself, as if to obtain shelter.</p>
<p>The prospect was bounded by a series of hills, which added
greatly to the interest of the landscape, presenting generally
the appearance of conical-shaped mounts, covered with luxuriant
herbage to their summits. The principal one of these was called
Handsome Sugar Loaf.</p>
<p>We should have remarked that, on leaving Oatlands, the
traveller had the choice of two roads to Launceston: the new road
leading through Albury Vale to St. Peter's Pass; and the other,
the branch road to the right, which we have just described.
Passing through the Dust Holes, or Spring Plains, we reached the
Salt Pan Plains, by taking the road to the right, down a steep
declivity, where one of the finest scenes which the island could
possibly afford was presented to us. The eye ranges many miles
over a beautiful tract of level country, bounded in the distance
of from forty to fifty miles by ranges of towering hills and
mountains, the most striking being Ben Lomond, which directly
fronted the view. The Salt Pan Plains extends over an expanse of
ten or twelve miles in diameter. On our descent from the rapid
declivity just named we crossed a small stream known as Anthill
Ponds. In the centre of the plain, we crossed Black Man's river,
over a rude bridge of six arches. This river derives its names
from the circumstance of a number of herdsmen having been
murdered by the natives; and the graves of the murdered shepherds
may be seen at the end of the bridge. The two salt pans which
give the name to these plains are at the distance of about five
miles to the east of this township. The larger contains forty
acres; and the smaller, and the best of the two, twenty acres. In
winter they are filled with rain water, which is dried up during
the summer months, when they become covered with a crust of
excellent salt, fit for any ordinary culinary purpose, presenting
a surface as white as snow, from a quarter to half an inch thick.
Several tons are annually collected for the use of the
neighbourhood; and, when summer rains happen to be succeeded by a
few days of hot weather sufficiently powerful to evaporate the
water, the salt is renewed; but the firsts or spring gathering,
is always the best. The country from Black Man's bridge is now
nearly of a level, until reaching Ross&mdash;indeed, generally
speaking, for the remaining distance to Launceston. The township
of Ross was situated near the bridge over the Macquarie River.
Campbell Town was the next place we met, after travelling over
country tolerably level, crossing the Elizabeth river, over a
rude bridge or causeway of 200 yards, and at the north end of
which was the township. A remarkable tier of ranges, called the
Eastern Tier, well covered with timber, is seen in an easterly
direction. This is the source of the Elizabeth river, which falls
between very steep and rocky banks. Some miles from hence we
passed through Wanstead Park, the seat of Mr. Willis, and were
conducted, for ten miles further, into the heavily-timbered tract
of level country called Epping Forest. About a mile after leaving
Campbell Town there is a track turning off to file right of the
main Launceston road, and through the eastern end of Epping
Forest, this road leads to St. Paul's and Break o' Day Plains.
Following this road for about ten miles from Campbell Town, it
touches the South Esk river, at its most southern bend; and after
continues up its southern bank amid a large variety of
interesting trees, shrubs, and smaller growing plants. At the
distance of five to seven miles there is another stream joins
this river from the north, flowing from Ben Lomond, whose bluff
and magnificent proportions would appear to be about twelve miles
distant, which waters the fine tract of country called Buffalo
Plain. Here were situated the farms of Mr. Bonney and Mr. John
Batman, whose enterprise and intelligence led subsequently to the
discovery and development of the unprecedently fine colony of
Port Phillip, now known as Victoria, and of which we shall have
occasion to say much, on that part of our reminiscences and
travels in that colony. Seventeen miles distant from Campbell
Town, and about half a mile on the left of the river, is the
junction of St. Paul's with the South Esk river. A bridle-road
leads from Mr. Hepburn's station, on the St. Paul's river, to
Oyster Bay. After crossing the St. Paul's river, the road still
follows the course of the South Esk, on its southern bank,
through a fine grazing district. At twenty-seven miles from
Campbell Town, we reach Tullochgorum The marsh all along the
course of the river is upwards of two miles in width, and
composed of a strong alluvial soil, producing fine pasturage for
cattle; and, were it protected from the effects of sudden floods,
would be evidently well calculated for cultivation. Here the road
passed round Vinegar Hill; and three miles further, we came upon
Fingal; another mile brought us to the junction of Break o' Day
river with St. Paul's, at the distance of 113 miles from Hobart
Town. On each side there is a fine tract of country: that to the
south, on the banks of the South Esk, extending for several
miles; and that to the east presented a fine tract for grazing
purposes, called Break o' Day Plains, and extending for many
miles on either bank of that river, which here formed a fine
stream, until it reached within ten miles of the Eastern Sea,
from which it is divided by a lofty range of hills near St.
Patrick's Head. Continuing along the bank of the stream, we
passed the farms of Mr. Betts and two others. This terminates the
part of the country known as the Break o' Day Plains. The land in
general lies at an elevation of 1,000 feet above sea level. From
this to Frankland's Lagoon and George's river, the traveller had
only marked trees to guide him through a thick, scrubby road,
utterly impassable for carriages. There are two paths to proceed
by: the one over a hill, on the further side of which there is a
fearfully rapid descent from a height of at least 2000 feet; the
other is more gradual and gentle in its descent, but is rough and
stony. Then travelling through a dreary country for a few miles,
a wide-spread prospect of the sea bursts upon the view.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<p><span class="a">Having</span> brought the reader to the sea
coast, in the branch line of road, through the Break o' Day
Plains, &amp;c., we will now retrace our steps to where we left
the main Launceston road, at Epping Forest, at the distance of
100 miles from Hobart Town.</p>
<p>Following the road through the snake banks and pleasant banks,
we reached the village of Perth, which is built on either bank of
the South Esk river, and to cross which there is a commodious
punt for the accommodation of travellers. From thence, and at the
distance of 124 miles from Hobart Town, we entered Launceston,
the chief town of the county of Cornwall, and the second of
importance in the island. It is conveniently situated, at the
head of the navigation of Port Dalrymple, standing between the
North Esk and South Esk rivers, where they meet, and form the
junction, or Tamar.</p>
<p>The South Esk falls into the Tamar through a chasm between
very rocky, steep hanks, called the cataract. On our visit to
this place we were accompanied by Mr. J.E. Underwood, of
Launceston, an old and respected colonist, and a close disciple
of the botanical profession. Many very interesting plants here
presented themselves, which were not common to the southern side
of the island. <i>Prostanthera</i>, with blue <i>labiate</i>
blossom; <i>Leptospermum, Leptomeria, Leptocarpus,
Pittosporum</i> (bicolor) was growing in the most sheltered
parts. The seed-vessels open as they hang on the trees, and
exhibit a number of bright red resinous seeds, from which the
name is derived&mdash;<i>Pitto resin</i> and <i>sporos</i> seeds.
<i>Phebalium montana, P. olieafolium, Platylobium, Pleurandria,
Pomaderris, Ozothamnus, Neottia, P. terostylus</i>, and the fly
orchis adorned the upper edges of the basin of water, which is
formed by the river, prior to its descent, in the shape of the
Cascade. It was at this basin of water where the inhabitants of
Launceston were in the habit of washing their clothes and linen.
<i>Leucopogon, Boronia, Eriostemon</i>, three species of acacia;
<i>Exocarpus</i>, a dwarf-growing species; Aster, four species of
the daisy tree; <i>Veronica labiata</i>, an herbaceous growing
species, producing spikes of pale lead-colored blossoms, in
pyramidal spikes, and in blossom during three months throughout
the year. In its character of growth it resembles the
<i>Solidagos</i>, or Aaron's rod, of Britain. <i>Ranunculus,
Gunnianus</i>, and two other species of the buttercup of the
colony; <i>Drosera arcturi</i>, Arthur's sundew <i>Clematis
gentianoides, Gentian</i>, like Virgin's bower; <i>Epacris,
Goodenia, Craspedia</i>, and many others of the yellow flowering,
composite plants. The white, large, blossoming ox-eye daisy
(<i>Chrysanthemum leucanthemum</i>) was also common, in moist
pastures, with <i>Helichrysum dealbata</i>, or white-flowered
everlasting. <i>Guaphalium</i>, three species of the cudweed;
<i>Zierria, Lithrum spicatum</i>, with its brilliant and showy
spikes of reddish pink blossoms; <i>Plantago plantain</i>, or rib
grass; <i>Daviesia</i>, or native hop, two species; <i>Lomatia
tintoria</i>, or dyer's weed; <i>Bulbine, Semibarbatum</i>,
half-bearded <i>Bulbine, Nastirtium semipinnatifidum</i>, half
pinnated mustard, forming a good salad; with the Cardamine, and
two other species of native cress. <i>Apium prostratum</i>, or
native parsley, was also abundant on the bank of the stream, and
forms an excellent ingredient in soup, and otherwise may be used
as a pot-herb. <i>Westringia dubiaefolia</i>, a rosemary-leaved
plant; <i>Styphelia adscendens</i>, a light green shrub,
belonging to the <i>Epacridaceæ; Solanum laciniatum</i> (kangaroo
apple) a quick-growing shrub, with large blue blossoms, succeeded
by apples like the common potato, which, when boiled or baked,
may be eaten. <i>Polygonum adpressum</i>, or Macquarie harbor
grape vine. This plant has long been an inhabitant of the gardens
around Launceston and Hobart Town, where it is grown for the
purpose of covering harbors and verandahs, for which its quick
growth, dense foliage, and white blossoms, succeeded with
clusters of waxy transparent fruit, slightly acid, renders it a
desirable ornament.</p>
<p>From Launceston we travelled to Norfolk plains, taking the
branch road to the south-west. For the first few miles we
travelled through a level, poor, sandy, and heavily timbered
country. We crossed the South Esk river at its junction with the
Western river, and thence to Westbury, through the same level
character of country, but in many cases interspersed with small
farms, the cultivation of which owed its origin to a number of
Norfolk island emigrants, who arrived here at the breaking up of
that island. Westbury is a small township, situated on the
eastern bank of a winding stream called Quamby's creek, which
runs in a serpentine direction for many miles through a fine
grazing country. We were informed that the grasses indigenous to
this district were of a highly nutritive character; and that the
milk produced from the cows fed upon them furnished cream so
thick that it was often cut with a knife, and consequently
yielding butter of an excellent quality and flavour. Continuing
our journey along this western road, we passed through some fine
open plains, with occasional belts of forest, consisting
principally of the genus Eucalypti, and an undergrowth of
<i>Dodonea, Correa, Accacia, Lomatia, Leucopogon, Leptospermum,
&amp;c.</i>, to which were clinging the <i>Cassytha</i>, or wire
grass, one of the Tasmanian representatives of the race of
emblems of ingratitude to the vegetable kingdom, as, being a
parasite, it takes root and derives all the sustenance from the
plant on which it grows, and subsequently kills the source from
whence it was indebted for its growth. The country we discovered
to be well watered by the river Meander, with its various
tributary streams. To the east and west, at about ten miles
distance, was the great basaltic wall, or chain of mountains,
whose average height was 4000 feet above sea level, covered, to
within 200 feet of their summits, with trees of the most stately
description, and affording a great and varied field to the
botanist. Midway between the road and the main range was a
solitary and detached mountain, called Quamby's bluff. The top of
this hill, from the position in which we viewed it, had the
appearance of being serrated, like the teeth of a saw, or, to
borrow a simile, like a cockscomb, on the head of which was a
flat rocky table. There was a very interesting anecdote connected
with this hill or mount, and which led to its name from the
circumstance of a black native who was found near it by a party
of men who were in search of kangaroos, in the early period of
the colony, when kangaroo flesh formed the principal article of
food in the shape of meat diet. Upon the party calling to the
native to stop, and on one of them presenting his gun at him, he
is said to have fallen on his knees, and exclaiming in a
melancholy accent, "Quamby! quamby!" which was the native
language for "Mercy! mercy!" or, "Spare me! spare me!" After
crossing the ford at the Meander river, the country continued
level, and generally varied by gentle rises, moderately wooded.
We found the property belonging to the Van Diemen's Land Sheep
Grazing Company situated on the south side of the river. Here we
found that, during the lambing season, the shepherd's duties were
both arduous and difficult, in consequence of having either to
fold his flocks, or watch them during the night. This step was
necessary to protect the sheep from the destructive visits of the
native devil, or hyæna, which were common in the mountains, and
were in the habit of prowling from their cavernous abodes from
thence, to the sheep folds below on the plains. One of the
animals had been caught a short time prior to our visit. It
measured six feet, from the snout to the tail. The skin was
beautifully striped with black and white on the back, while the
belly and sides were of a white color. Its mouth resembled that
of a wolf, with huge jaws, opening almost to the ears. Its legs
were short in proportion to the body, and it had a sluggish
appearance; but, in running, it bounds like a kangaroo, though
with far less speed than that animal. The female carried the
young in its pouch, like most other quadrupeds of this country.
The Meander afforded fish of a good size; and that called the
black fish was sometimes caught of from one to three feet in
length; a vast advantage in size as compared to the fish known by
that name which are caught in the Yarra Yarra river of Melbourne.
After passing through very rich and highly cultivated farms and
cattle runs, in nineteen miles from Westbury, we reached the bank
of a small stream, falling into the Mersey, near two very
remarkable-looking hills, called Gog and Magog. At the distance
of about three miles and a half from this, we ascend a range of
two hills, which here forms the natural boundary to the west of
an extensive country called Dairy Plains. On ascending the ridge
of this series of hills, a magnificent view presented itself
suddenly to the delighted traveller, of rich and fertile surface,
with purple-tinged romantic hills in the distance. After
descending this ridge, already named, for the distance of five or
six miles, we crossed the Moleside rivulet, so called from the
circumstance of its occasionally disappearing and flowing
underground, like the river Mole in England. The whole of this
neighbourhood is of limestone, with beautiful white veins, and
the strata is nearly horizontal. There is a small circular plain,
about the distance of five miles from where we crossed Moleside.
The character of this country was most remarkable, and appeared
to be intercepted for many miles by numerous underground streams,
flowing in different directions and at various depths. The effect
of these streams thus flowing underground had the effect of
undermining the superincumbent earth, which, being thus left
without a foundation, has fallen in in many places, forming pits
and basins of the most singular kind, varying in depth of from 20
to 300 feet, and shaped like a funnel. (Many instances of this
kind may be observed in the neighbourhood of Mount Gambier, and
many parts of the country near the Glenelg river, in Victoria.)
In the bottom of most of them is a small circular pool of water,
of unmeasureable depth. A party on one occasion descended one of
the deepest of them, and at the bottom found a cavern, extending
both ways, into which they entered. After following its course
for some distance, a sound of running water was heard; and,
although they were without light, the reflection from the
entrance was sufficient to enable them to distinguish a large
body of water rushing from a height, and flowing away, as it
were, beneath their feet. Some of the smallest of these pits must
have fallen in recently. Among them might be found some not more
than a couple of yards in diameter, to the edge of which the
traveller would suddenly come as he walked along the level grass.
There might be seen with the corresponding piece of level grass,
a green sward lying at the bottom, while the wet, clayey, and
circular sides continued cylindrically perpendicular. In
travelling over this plain, the journey was of a circuitous
character, to avoid the holes and inequalities; but after
emerging from thence, in about four miles, the country becomes
hilly and steep, until reaching the banks of the river Mersey, a
broad stream of 200 feet wide, and the bottom a bed of rocks. At
the crossing-place, the water was shallow, not more than two feet
deep. This river takes its rise from the high chain of mountains,
from the great lake at the head of the river Ouse and Shannon,
already named. A little below where we crossed the river was a
long bar of limestone rock, running across the stream; and this
would appear to form the line of demarcation of that character of
rock in this direction.</p>
<p>After crossing this river, there is a small well-grassed
plain, fringed on all sides by lofty timber trees. One of these
trees was measured by means of a pocket-sextant, and found to be
205 feet high; and the trunk of another, five feet from the
ground, was thirty-nine feet in circumference. On a visit which
we subsequently made to the summit of the western tier of ranges,
we had an opportunity of inspecting the supposed sources of the
Mersey, from the Great Lake, and which we discovered was
connected with a chain of smaller bodies of water. The banks were
fringed with Alpine plants and shrubs, producing flowers of great
beauty. The most common of them was, however, the <i>Telopia
Tasmaniensis</i>, or waratah, or scarlet tulip tree, as it has
been occasionally termed by stock-keepers, a race of bushmen who
had greater facilities for paying these Alpine regions more
frequent visits than the ordinary traveller, in consequence of
the nature of their employment in mustering stray cattle. The
wax-cluster, <i>Gaultheria hispida, Cyathodes</i>, a race of
plants having waxy-looking berries, of a pale pink to a deep
crimson, and thus affording an agreeable contrast to the white
and numerous heroes of the wax-cluster. <i>Ozothamnus
montana</i>, or mountain <i>ozothamnus</i>, rare in other places,
was here abundantly scattered, its small and numerous thread-like
fibres clinging to the wet, mossy rocks for the necessary support
and nourishment to the plant. <i>Bellandena</i>, or mountain
rocket; <i>Craspedia grandiflora; Cardamine</i>, or mountain
smell smock, and many other little annuals and herbaceous, with
shrubs of <i>Correa</i> of several species; but <i>C.
ferruginea</i> and <i>C. Backhousiana</i> were the two species
most frequently met with over the Western tier, although they are
also common on Mount Wellington, near Hobart Town. The leaves of
<i>C. ferruginea</i> are covered on the under side with a
rusty-colored down. The flowers are greenish, and tinged with the
same. <i>C. Backhousiana</i> was named by Dr. Hooker, in honor of
Mr. James Backhouse, a member of the Society of Friends, who
discovered it at Cape Grim. In about the distance of three miles
from crossing the Mersey, we ascended a ridge of from 1000 to
1600 feet elevation, which divides the waters of the Mersey and
the Forth. The track through the upper part of the ridge was
crooked, from the difficult character of the country in regard to
ascent; and for almost a mile we travelled through a dense
forest, composed principally of myrtle, sassafraz trees, gum
trees of stupendous growth, forming altogether a concentrated
mass of foliage, through which it was difficult to obtain a
glimpse of the sun's rays. On these trees, situated at the
junction of the larger stems with the parent trunk, were many
large masses of <i>Ephiphites</i>, or air plants; <i>Acrosticum,
Dendrobium</i>, and others of the orchid aceons. On reaching the
summit, there is a small plain , scantily grassed, called Emu
Plain; and this is the only road on which the myrtle tree will be
met with. At the bottom of this hill, on the opposite side, was
the river Forth; but to reach it was a sort of break-neck journey
over the steep and precipitous side of the mountain. The distance
between the river Mersey and the river Forth was about ten miles,
between which the ridge called Gad's Hill, over which we had
travelled, formed a kind of saddle. The Forth runs at the base of
the ridge, whose sides were rocky and steep, overhung with the
deep, dark, and sombre foliage of the myrtle and sassafraz trees,
which dipped their lower branches into the water. Occasionally
through the foliage thus laved in the stream was a number of
dwarf shrubs and plants, peeping and pushing their way through,
as though to enliven with their livelier-colored blossoms the
retired and otherwise melancholy of the scene. Among the latter
were the permanently-flowering <i>Goodenia</i>, with their bright
yellow and singularly-shaped blossoms; three species of integral
and lance-shaped leaved acacia, or wattle; Prostanthera, or mint
tree; <i>Zierria arboresens</i>, with their bright white
blossoms. The water of the Forth was beyond measure pure, clear,
and limpid, as is the usual character of rivers deriving their
source and supply from melted snows. The river itself is of the
same size and character as the Mersey; and, immediately after
crossing, we had to commence another grappling ascent for at
least four miles, until we had again made up in elevation upon
this side what we had lost in the descent on the other side,
namely, 1600 feet. We then followed the track, or road, along the
ridge, or a sort of tongue, or shoulder, projecting at right
angles from the main hill. The soil was of the poorest
description, although, as usual in such cases, extremely rich in
plants, principally of a heathy character. The
<i>Epacridaceous</i> order was plentifully represented, by
various species of <i>Epacris</i>, which forms the type of the
order. <i>Leucopogon, Cryptomaria, Leptospermum</i>, and many
others of the order <i>Myrtacea</i>, whose leaves, when touched,
as they frequently were from necessity while effecting our
ascent, emitted the most agreeable odour from the crushing of the
little postules of aromatic oils. Of the trees also belonging to
this order, were many of the <i>Eucalyptus resinifera</i>, or
cider tree of the lakes. This tree, at certain seasons, yields a
quantity of slightly saccharine liquor, resembling treacle, which
the stockkeepers were in the habit of extracting, and using as a
kind of drink. The natives had also a method, at the proper
season, of grinding holes in the tree, from which the sweet juice
flowed plentifully, and was collected in a hole at the bottom,
near the root of the tree. These holes were kept covered over
with a flat stone, apparently for the purpose of preventing birds
and animals coming to drink it. When allowed to remain any length
of time, it ferments and settles into a coarse sort of wine or
cider, rather intoxicating if drank to excess.</p>
<p>Here we also met with the <i>Blandfordia nobilis</i>, or noble
Blandfordia, named in honor of George Marquis of Blandford, son
to the second Duke of Marlborough. This splendid plant bears a
head of brilliant crimson blossoms, tipped with yellow, one inch
long, rising out of a stalk of from two to three feet long, from
between two opposite series of strapped-shaped leaves. It belongs
to the sixth class, <i>Hexandria</i>, and the first order,
<i>Monogynia</i>, of Linnæus, and ranks among the
<i>Liliacieæe</i> of the natural system of Jussieu.
<i>Tetratheca</i>, with its pretty pink four-petalled blossoms,
adorned the surface, with <i>Astroloma, Eriostemen, Baeckia
diosmafolia</i>, and many other plants of the same heathy
character, which the reader will find systematically noticed in
the work shortly to be published, in a separate form, under the
head of "Botany and Plants of Tasmania and the Australias." From
the top of this hill a grand view is obtained of a remarkable
hill called Roland's Repulse, as it was from that point that, in
the year 1823, Captain Roland, of the 3rd Regiment of Buffs, who
was engaged in exploring the country, was stopped in his course,
and obliged to return. After travelling for the distance of six
or seven miles, abounding in kangaroos, we entered upon an
exceedingly open tract of country called Middlesex Plains, which
were watered ,by numerous small rivulets, and a considerable
stream called the Isis, running through their centre, in a
northerly course. A range of lofty but barren mountains bounds
the horizon to the south. From above this level are seen, in the
distance, two remarkable high points, one of which is called the
Ribrock, and the other the Bam Bluff. These two mountains could
not have been less than 6000 feet in height, as a patch of snow
was reclining calmly and unthawed in the valley between the two,
in the middle of summer. After a few hours travelling we ascended
a small eminence, which gave us a fine view of a pretty valley of
about three miles in width, and composed of various gentle rises
covered with grass. Here again the limestone occurred; and, as at
Moleside, several of the water courses and creeks running into
the principal stream, lose themselves for a time underground, and
re-appeared. The valley was barren of trees, although they grew
in clumps along its edge, and were principally myrtle. Kangaroos
were seen feeding in the valley in various parts. The extreme
northern point of the range of hills, which formed the western
side of the valley, called Belvoir Vale, terminating in a high
naked green hill called May Day Mount, from the circumstance of a
number of dark coloured rocks, or basaltic columns, having the
appearance of chimney sweepers climbing on a May day. The Black
Bluff mountain terminates the northern extremity of the range,
and is about seven miles distant. A ridge of high land, covered
with heathy plants, and thinly wooded, connected the two
mountains, May Day and Bluff. The ascent to the top of this ridge
was difficult, although the sense of smell was relieved by the
crushing of the leaves of what is called the lemon plant, which
is here abundant. It is not a true <i>Lemonia</i>, In the centre
of this ridge stands a remarkable and curious block of granite,
from whence we obtained a fine view of the Surrey hills, lying in
a north-westerly direction. The whole expanse presented a level
surface of trees to the eye, and is considered to be the most
extensive tract of level country in the island. The only
mountains which bound it are St. Valentine's Peak to the north,
and Mount Cleveland to the west. Some time previously, two carts,
belonging to the Van Diemen's Land Company, had passed over this
ridge, each drawn by six oxen, with their drivers. It appears
that some natives had observed this; and, a short time
afterwards, one of the company's servants passing that way, found
in one of their rudely-constructed huts, a piece of the bark of a
tree, with a rough drawing of the whole scene. The wheels of the
carts, the bullocks drawing them, and the drivers with their
whips over their shoulders, were all distinctly depicted in their
rude but interesting manner. To reach the Surrey Hills, we had to
effect a heavily-timbered descent, and full of bogs and
quagmires, until reaching a forest of myrtles, through which the
company had cut a track, leading through a confined plain of a
mile in width, covered with prostrate trunks of decayed and
decaying trees, and over-head by brushes and dense foliage. On
our way from May Day Mount plain, we passed through a grove of
the <i>Tasmania fragrans</i>, or Tasmania pepper trees, from
eight to ten feet high, with Daphne-like foliage; and the flowers
of which produce a male powder (farina) of so pungent a nature as
to occasion an immediate and violent fit of sneezing; and the
black berries, which it produces in abundance, when ripe, form a
good substitute for the pepper of commerce. This shrub is also
common to the middle regions of Mount Wellington. The country
continued to gradually descend, and we, for many miles travelled
through an uninteresting, cold, and chilly country, until
reaching the company's establishment at the Hampshire hills,
through which runs the river Emu and its tributaries, their
margins clothed with many interesting <i>Myrtaceus,
Rutaceous</i>, and other aromatic shrubs.</p>
<p>At this place was a remarkably large tree, of the string/bark
species, which had been hollowed out by numerous fires in former
ages. In this hollow, for some time, lived eight men belonging to
the company. From this place to Emu Bay, the journey was
principally through a forest of myrtles; and the river Emu
empties itself into the centre of it. The whole course of this
river, from the Hampshire hills to Bass's Straits, is through a
thick and dense forest of myrtle and other trees. Circular Head
may be reached from this place by taking advantage of low tides
to cross the mouth of the various rivers, when you reach
Highfield, the chief residence of the Circular Head Company's
Manager.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<p><span class="a">The</span> road from Launceston to the most
northerly settlement in the island is 40 miles from Launceston,
and 164 from Hobart Town, called George Town; to reach which we
had to cross the North Esk river by a punt, and travelled through
poor, uninviting, sandy, scrubby, heathy country, until reaching
George Town, which is pleasantly situated on the northern bank of
the Tamar, within four or five miles of Bass's Strait, near the
entrance to Port Dalrymple.</p>
<p>New Norfolk is twenty-two miles from Hobart Town, from whence
it is reached by crossing Roseneath Ferry. After crossing the
river at this township by a punt, our road to the Macquarie
district lay, for several miles, through a highly cultivated
country, until reaching a track leading to the Upper Clyde,
called the Marked Tree Road, which we followed through a
settlement called Hollow Tree, whence we again joined the main
road to the Upper Clyde, which we reached at a point where Mr.
Roadknight had a flour mill established. Passing through Sorell
Plains the township of Hamilton, Spring Hill, we passed the
extensive grazing country of Abyssinia, and entered the town of
Bothwell. This township was very picturesquely situated, and many
streets formed most judiciously, and tolerably lined with
buildings. It was the residence of an officer in the command of
the forces, with a detachment of troops. At the time of our
visit. Major Schaw was the officer in command; and the office of
Police Clerk was ably represented in the person of Mr. A.
Wheatley, now of this city. A finely-constructed and
well-regulated inn was also established, and the duties of host
was represented by Mr. W.J. Sugden, also a present resident of
the City of Melbourne.</p>
<p>From Bothwell we paid a visit to the Upper Clyde, with letters
of introduction to Mr. Axford, who had a corn mill. We were also
kindly entertained by Mr. Hovell, who had also a corn mill
constructed on this river. From hence we visited the source of
the Clyde, by following up a steep, broken, rocky track on its
eastern bank, and having on our right hand two remarkable
eminences, called respectively the Quoin and the Table mountains,
near Jericho. These mountains formerly formed places of great
resort for the aborigines. At the distance of twenty-two miles
from the township of Bothwell, the road crossed the source of the
Clyde, where it falls out of the southern end of Lake Crescent.
From thence a track, leading on the western edges of Lake
Crescent and Lake Sorell, brought us to a log hut. Lake Crescent
and Lake Sorell have a small, slow-running stream, which forms a
connecting lake of half a mile in length.</p>
<p>In crossing the Clyde from Bothwell, the traveller passes
Cluny Park, where is a beautiful plain called Bark Hut Plains,
and having on one hand a lofty hill, called the Blue Hill, about
four miles distance on the left hand. Shortly after crossing the
river Shannon, we passed through Weavell's Plain, and afterwards
over another extensive plain called Hunterston, situated on the
banks of the river. This is the spot where the notorious
bushranger, Michael Howe, was apprehended, and where he perished
in the struggle, and now lies buried. From the last resting-place
of Michael Howe, by following a track on the left hand, we passed
close under the beautiful hill called Mount Pleasant; and from
thence to the romantic and original residence of the late
lamented and universally-respected Dr. James Ross, LL.D.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<p><span class="a">We</span> are now reminded that it is time to
bring our travels in Tasmania to an end. The foregoing excursion
through that interesting island will, we trust, present a fair
outline of its general character, both geographically and
otherwise. One very interesting feature, peculiar to all new
countries, was the absence of the aboriginal inhabitants. These
people had been collected, through the conciliatory exertions of
Mr. G.A. Robinson, before our arrival in the colony; and a short
time subsequent to that event had been removed to the
establishment which had been set apart for them at Flinders
Island&mdash;the total number of blacks being 110. They were said
to be a happy and contented race, gradually acquiring industrious
and useful habits. Each little family had a hut built by their
own hands, with a fire-place and a window to each. They had
tables, chairs, and bedsteads, rudely manufactured of the timber
of the island, imitating, as closely as they could, the customs
of their white associates.</p>
<p>The females gave their attention to the domestic duties, in
keeping their little hovels clean, and mending and washing
clothes. In their hunting excursions, they brought home skins of
wallabies and kangaroos, which they stretched out with pegs on
the grass to dry. These they afterwards sent to Launceston to be
exchanged for knives, handkerchiefs, and other useful little
European articles.</p>
<p>They cultivated one large garden in common, using the hoe to
the tune of one of their wild melodies.</p>
<p>The last of this unfortunate race of beings (now extinct) was
brought in (except four) by Mr. Robinson, in May, 1834, and to
whom, in April, 1836, a splendid silver vase was presented by the
inhabitants of the Bothwell district, in testimony of their
acknowledgement of the benefits which the colony had derived from
his successful conciliation of the aborigines.</p>
<p>The following very graphic description of these people in
their wild state is from the pen of Dr. Ross:&mdash;</p>
<p>"On looking round, we were not a little surprised to see
several small parties of blacks, some strolling about, while
others sat in little families, as it were, round small fires. We
found they were a tribe of about sixty or seventy, whom I had
occasionally seen before, and who had occasionally visited Hobart
Town, where they had been kindly treated by the Government and
the inhabitants, who had supplied them with provisions, clothing,
and blankets. Here we slackened our pace, willing to waste a few
minutes on the new scene which had presented itself. As we were
walking towards one of the small parties, a tall fellow overtook
us with a bunch of seven fat but strong-smelling opossums slung
on his back and round his neck. We followed him to the fire; and
he very deliberately chucked them all upon it, one after the
other, just as he had caught them. The company seemed to have
very little to say, for but few words passed between them; and
what was rather mortifying to gentlemen of our rank of life, they
scarcely deigned to look upon us!</p>
<p>"On our parts, however, we could not help admiring their
upright, and even elegant, gait, which would be a pattern to any
Bond-street lounger. It was quite indicative of persons who had
little to do, with their pleasure only to seek. Their air of
independence was quite charming, and, upon reflection, I know no
race of people who have greater claims to that property. So
perfectly indifferent were they of dress and clothing, that
several of them had cast away their blankets they had had in
Hobart Town as an unnecessary incumbrance. What a host of
super-vacareous tinkers, tailors, dressmakers, shoemakers,
bottle-blowers, shopkeeper, storekeepers, and manufacturers of
all kinds and sorts of things, ore thrown into the shade by these
aboriginal ladies and gentlemen. Diogenes with his tub was a man
of luxurious life compared to them. The only symptom of weakness
which they betrayed, was the pains that some of them (no doubt
dandies in their community) took with their heads. They had
smeared their hair with a red pigment, mixed with grease; and one
gentleman had decorated himself with two white cockatoo feathers.
In this respect they resembled some of the civilised race, whom I
have known to besmear their heads with perfumed pomatum, or some
of the four-legged canine species, whom, I hear, sometimes, when
they come across some putrified or strong-smelling substance, rub
their cheeks against it until they have thoroughly imbibed the
stench.</p>
<p>"As soon as the opossums were singed and well-heated on one
side, our cook turned them upon the other; and then dragging them
by the leg from the fire, he scraped off the fur, and, with a
sharp flint, cut out the inside, and again threw it on the fire,
from which it was soon after taken and eaten, without the trouble
of knife or fork, in a half raw state. Occasionally they would
take a short walk to the lagoon, and, laying themselves on their
breasts and dipping their mouths into the water, drank, without
cup or chalice, the pure element of nature. They then returned to
their rural hearth, and, sitting or reclining on the ground, they
dozed as deliciously as if they had reposed on a velvet
couch."</p>
<p>Upon another occasion, the humane doctor says, in regard to
these people:&mdash;</p>
<p>We had not penetrated far into this scrub, when we
accidentally met one of Mr. Lord's stockmen, sitting on the stump
of a tree, nearly starved to death. He told us that, three days
before, a black woman whom he had caught and <i>chained</i> to a
log with a bullock chain, and whom he had dressed in a very fine
linen shirt (the only one he had), in hopes, as he said, to tame
her, had contrived somehow to slip the chain from her leg, and
run away, shirt and all. She had already got a quarter of a mile
off, when he saw her, and, without reflecting, he pursued her for
upwards of five hours, through copse, vale, and thicket, up-hill
and down-hill, led by the occasional glimpses of his own white
shirt, still upon her back, as seen through the trees. At last he
was obliged to abandon the chase; and he had not been able since
to rejoin his companions, to whom we now directed him, first
giving him from our own slender supply two biscuits.</p>
<p>"I fear that his object in chaining the girl was not exactly
as platonic, or pure and as disinterested, as could be wished.
There is little doubt, indeed, but such, and even worse treatment
than this by the white stock-keepers, in the earlier periods of
the colony, was the chief and original cause of the hostility
which the aborigines have since indiscriminately shown to the
whites."</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>
<p><span class="a">Many</span> years have elapsed since our
departure from the shores of Tasmania, and, during that period,
many changes have taken place. A Natural History and Royal
Society have been established; and the members have published the
results attending the discoveries both of subsequent travellers
and other parties engaged in developing the resources of that
island; and whose exertions are published in the "Transactions of
the Royal Society", to whom we refer our readers for information
on these topics. It is but justice to add that, at the time of
our arrival, it was in every sense of the word a "penal colony";
and, as a natural consequence, the state of persons and
properties was represented to us as being insecure in the highest
degree. On our arrival here, we found that the reputation thus
acquired was undeserved, as nothing could have afforded a better
guarantee of the safety of property in the town of Hobart than
the utter carelessness observed by the inhabitants, in leaving
the doors unlocked during the night time. The system of
<i>unshingling</i>, or taking a hat from the traveller's head in
the darkness of night, during his wanderings through the streets,
did not fall to our lot to experience.</p>
<p>In the "Ross's Van Diemen's Land Almanac for 1836," among the
chronological order of events, appears the following
notice:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center">"ROSS'S VAN DIEMEN'S LAND ANNUAL FOR 1885.</p>
<p>"A nursery fruit and seed garden, on a scientific and
extensive scale, is commenced at Mr. Lightfoot's, on the New Town
Road. Mr. Lightfoot also deserves credit as having been the first
to introduce the present choice stock of pear trees.</p>
<p>"The plants, of which there is already a very extensive
collection, both exotic and indigenous, are arranged by Mr. Bunce
in two departments: the one according to the classification of
Linnæus; and the other agreeably to the natural orders of
Jussien.</p>
<p>"The establishment is highly deserving the support of the
public."</p>
<p>This establishment we subsequently purchased, and opened as
the Denmark Hill Nursery; and the same year we introduced the
first importation of English forest trees, and other choice
British shrubs and plants, from the well-known establishment of
the Messrs. Whitley and Osborne, of Fulham, London. We may take
credit to ourselves, as having been the first to commence the
arrangement of our indigenous and exotic plants, agreeably to the
Linnæan and natural systems, to which we had large cross wooden
labels attached, indicating their class, order, and natural
relationships. After three years close observation of the
climate, and its effect upon garden produce, we composed a
monthly magazine, or periodical, to be completed in twelve
monthly parts, under the title of "Bunce's Manual of Practical
Gardening." This work was very favorably received; and finished
in due course at the printing office of the <i>Hobart Town
Courier</i>, the property of Mr. W.G. Elliston, who succeeded Dr.
James Ross as the proprietor of that establishment. We must also
conscientiously admit that, with unshingling, and other
interesting peculiarities which we had been led to expect on our
arrival, we also appear to have escaped the epoch when the
shopkeeper's profits would not afford the indulgence to
purchasers of paper wherein to enclose or wrap whatever may have
been the kind or character of commodity.</p>
<p>We were more particularly struck with the character and
various kind of currency; and, in receiving change for a pound
note or sovereign, it was difficult to ascertain, with any degree
of certainty, whether you had obtained your right change or
otherwise. Our first change for a pound consisted of two dumps,
two holy dollars, one Spanish dollar, one French coin, one
half-crown, one shilling, and one sixpence. The last three were
the only legitimate British currency with which we were then
acquainted. There were at that time loud complaints from the
country districts regarding the rapid increase of the wild dog,
partly owing to the departure of the aborigines to their
settlement at Flinders Island, leaving behind them several which
had bred in the bush, but more through the carelessness of
persons engaged in the distant out-districts.</p>
<p>In May, 1836, intelligence was received that his Majesty had
been pleased to release Colonel Arthur from the Government of
this Colony; and, in the August following, the intelligence
arrived that Sir John Franklin had been appointed as his
successor.</p>
<p>Almost contemporaneously with Colonel Arthur's departure from
the Government of the island, Tasmania was honored by the arrival
of some distinguished visitors from Port Phillip, which had been
just discovered by Mr. John Batman, in the persons of two of its
princes, or chiefs: Derrimut, King of the Werriby district; and
Betbenjee, of the adjoining district, two brothers; and with whom
was the tall and gigantic prototype of Robinson
Crusoe&mdash;Buckley, whom Batman had discovered among the
natives on his first visiting Port Phillip, where he had resided
for thirty-three years. Among others, we, in company, paid our
respects to the renowned Buckley, in company with the late Dr.
Ross. Our visit was not absolutely void of self-interest, as we
had contemplated the probability, or rather possibility, of
obtaining from the great semi-barbarian materials of his long
residence among the aborigines in Port Phillip, for an
interesting shred of autobiography. Our visit, however, proved a
failure, as we could obtain no information from the party whose
memoirs we were desirous of perpetuating, and whose conversation
consisted merely of a few monosyllabic words. Since that time,
however, a most elaborate, and as interesting as elaborately
written work has been published by Mr. John Morgan, of Hobart
Town. Of this production, we know not which most to admire, the
extreme facility of acquiring information from a to us dumb man,
or his remarkable powers of imagination. Of the two native
chiefs, a singular instance of the effects of strong drinks may
be related. On their arrival, they both got extremely
intoxicated, and they both felt the sickening effects the
following morning. Poor Derrimut was induced to taste "a hair of
the dog that bit him," and recommenced his debauch, and still
continues a drunkard to this day. But his brother Betbenjee was
so heartily disgusted, that he never could be induced to taste
spirits since. Betbenjee is now dead; Buckley is dead; and
Derrimut we saw on Sunday evening, April 27th, 1856, at
Moordyyallack, and who, we may as well state, was the first to
greet us on our first arrival in Port Phillip, in 1839; from
which date our "Reminiscences of Van Diemen's Land" must end, and
those of Victoria commence.</p>

<h3>AUSTRALIA.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p align="center"><span class="u">MELBOURNE.</span></p>
<p><span class="a">We</span> bade farewell to Tasmania in the
early part of the month of October, in the year 1839, and reached
Port Phillip after a protracted and rough passage of nearly three
weeks, in the Lord Hobart, Thomas Nichol, master.</p>
<p>As was usual with those who arrived for the first time in
Hobson's Bay, the captain of our vessel took the ship's boat up
the Yarra Yarra. The river was then densely covered on both banks
with mellaeuca or tea-tree, and the monomeeth parbine. This
latter was called by the aborigines "the good mother", from the
seed pods, or receptacle for the developing process of the seeds,
being attached in whirls to the stems or branches on which they
are produced years after the trees at those parts have shed their
blossoms. The long heavy branches of the monomeeth parbine hung
in massive graceful arches over the river's side. Flocks of wild
ducks were disturbed by our boat, as we glided up the stream. The
notes peculiar to the ornithorinchus paradoxus, or platipus,
wattle bird, and leather-head or old soldier bird, added in no
small degree to the novelties which on every side thrust
themselves upon our awakened attention. The wattle bird has been
not inaptly termed the "what's-o'clock?"&mdash;the leather-head,
the "stop-where-you-are." Lofty eucalyptus or flooded-gum trees
formed a back ground to the natural plantation of tea-tree. As we
approached the site whereon Melbourne has been built, the
reverberating echoes from a blacksmith's shop, and the
unmistakeable odour of a fellmonger's yard, reminded us that the
elements of civilization had preceded our arrival. In the latter
part of the year one thousand eight hundred. and thirty-nine, we
landed on the low muddy bank on the north side of the river, the
site known as the wharf. Proceeding eastward, we passed a neat
and tasteful building, situated on a small hillock, called
Batman's Hill. Wandering over the undulating ground in the
locality, the place where Melbourne now stands, we noticed two or
three hotels, which had recently been erected in different
quarters of the township, a few stores, and an auction mart. We
also noticed a small brick building in Little Collins-street,
opposite the spot where Temple Court has since been erected,
which was called the Treasury. There was a small wooden house
used for a Police Court, and another for a Post Office. Mr. La
Trobe was the Superindent [sic] of this newly-formed settlement
of Port Phillip, or "the Settlement", as it was then termed. Wild
fowl were very plentiful both in the swamp, near Batman's Hill,
and at the Salt Water River. On the hill where the Supreme Court
stands we gathered large quantities of mushrooms. The lagoon
formed by the back waters of the Yarra Yarra abounded in snipe.
Proceeding up the river by the bank, passing through what is now
the Richmond Paddock, we found that a gentleman, named Arden, had
erected a residence in that locality. The hill on the eastern
side of Melbourne was then thickly wooded. In the streets of the
township there were numerous stumps of the eucalypti, or gum
trees; here and there a whole tree,&mdash;a solitary example,
which may be termed the last of its race, may be seen by the
fence of the Roman Catholic Church in Elizabeth-street, and to
which we apply the words of the song) in serious earnestness,
"Oh, Woodman! spare that Tree."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>
<p align="center"><span class="u">AN EXCURSION TO WESTERN
PORT.</span></p>
<p><span class="a">Having</span> been introduced by one of their
number to a tribe of aborigines, I formed the intention of
proceeding to the Dandenong ranges, and thence to Western Port.
Among the natives were Derrimut, Yammabook or Hawk's-Eye, and
Benbow. The latter is he who gave information of an evil design
which some of his companions had conceived, and thus prevented
what might have been a fatal encounter between them and the first
white settlers. Benbow invariably rejected all solicitations to
partake of spirituous liquors, and is the only teetotaller I ever
met with among the aborigines. In a corner of Mr. Batman's
garden, Benbow and his wife, Kitty, dwelt in a small hut of his
own constructing. Within everything was cleanly, and in good
order. Benbow was often consulted by the settlers concerning
various matters; and he was always willing to impart what
information he possessed. He was not only an intelligent native,
but a really worthy fellow: an evidence that the aborigines of
Australia are not, as has been so frequently stated by various
writers, incapable of being civilized.</p>
<p>Proceeding on our projected excursion on foot, we crossed the
Yarra Yarra by a punt, at the place where Prince's Bridge has
been built, and passed up the river to Gardiner's Creek. The
ground on our right has been surveyed, and sold in allotments of
various sizes, and the rising township of Prahran has grown up.
Mr. Arden's house was the only building we saw on the spot where
Richmond now stands. On that side of the river there was a swamp
or marsh, edged with a natural plantation of swamp broom.
Gardiner's Creek, at its confluence with the river, rushing
through a dense mass of tea-tree, like water bubbling from the
neck of a bottle. In this neighbourhood I saw many new plants, of
a totally different character from those which I had previously
had an opportunity of observing in Tasmania. <i>Dodonea,
goodenia</i>, and the brilliant spikes of reddish-purple blossom,
of the lithrum spicata, enlivened the banks of the creek. With
the exception of a small wattle-and-dab hut, the only house in
the locality was a building of stone, which was in the course of
erection by Mr. W.G. Robinson, the protector of the aborigines.
After crossing Gardiner's Creek, leaving the river on our left,
we travelled over a piece of rising sandy ground, which formed a
belt between the Yarra Yarra and the sandy heath which we found
in the neighbourhood of Brighton. This place was richly covered
with low shrubs, and plants of a heathy nature;
<i>Leucopogon</i>, several species; <i>Astroloma</i>, or native
cranberry; <i>Epacris</i>, white and red; a dwarf species of
<i>Casuarina; Tetratheca; Eriostemon</i>; several species of
dwarf integral-leaved Acacia, or wattles; <i>Leptospermum;
Hippuris</i>, or mare's tail; <i>Daviesia; Pultnea</i>; and
<i>Pleurandria</i>, were among the most prominent. On our way to
the base of the first mountain, in an easterly direction, we
crossed some clear, running streams of water, all tributaries of
the Yarra, their banks being well covered with trees, and
interesting shrubby herbaceous plants, which my readers will find
described in a separate work on the plants of these colonies. We
encamped the first night between Gardiner's and Babee Jim creeks,
where the country was extremely rich, undulating,
thinly-timbered, and thickly-grassed. Our camp was about the
distance of four miles from the southern bank of the river, on
which was then a station belonging to Messrs. Walpole and Goggs.
The latter gentleman we had the pleasure to meet during our
wanderings with Leichhardt, Mr. Goggs and his brother having
followed upon our new track on the Condamine river.</p>
<p>This was the first time I had ever camped for the night in
company with aborigines. Having at that time but a very imperfect
acquaintance with their language and customs, my first
impressions concerning these singular and inoffensive people were
by no means favorable. It being clear and star-light, we were
sufficiently sheltered for the night by a few branches from the
neighbouring gum trees.</p>
<p>As an additional protection for me, my new Mends covered the
spot where I was to lie with a sheet of bark, supported upon
wattles. They cooked an opossum for our evening meal. Although
delicate in appearance as an English rabbit, the flesh was not so
agreeable as I had been led to anticipate, it being very strongly
tinctured with the volatile peppermint smelling oil, common to
the leaves of the <i>eucalyptus piperita</i>, or peppermint tree,
in which tree the opossum finds its chief food.</p>
<p>In searching for and catching the opossum, the natives display
acute observation and much skill. Indications of the presence of
their game, quite imperceptible to the white man, are by them
instinctively recognised. They examine cursorily all the large
trees likely to afford shelter to the animal. If, from
observation of any particular tree, the hunter has conceived it
probable that the opossum has taken refuge amongst its branches,
he, by making a series of notches in the bark for his feet,
ascends to what altitude he pleases. Should the opossum have
taken refuge in a hollow, a small stick is used to dislodge him.
On emerging from his retreat, he is caught dexterously by the
tail, and swung rapidly round twice or thrice, until his head is
made to come in contact with the tree and stunned.</p>
<p>After retiring to my berth, I lay awake a great part of the
night, watching the natives, who were seated around the camp
fire, endeavouring to catch the meaning of the language in which
they conversed cheerfully with each other.</p>
<p>We were afoot again by early dawn. At my request, my
companions tarried a short time, while I collected specimens of
the <i>flora</i> of the place; and, as soon as they perceived the
reason of our delay, rendered willingly what assistance they
could, by bringing to me various leaves, herbs, &amp;c. They had
names for many of them, which I carefully noted, for future
reference. When the sun was fairly up, the short, rich notes of
the native thrush, the sweet warble of the magpie, and the jocund
cadence of the laughing jackass, reverbrated through the woods.
We made for Mount Koronth Marabool, a small mountain, divided
from the main chain of ranges. Pursuing our journey over the
gently undulating country, we stayed for refreshment beside a
small streamlet, known as Babee Jim Creek. This creek has
well-defined banks, with a great variety of subalpine shrubs and
plants. I found the <i>Prostanthera lasianthus</i>, pencil cedar;
<i>Pomaderris apetala</i>; and <i>Parvifolia</i>, the large and
small-leaved, which the natives called <i>callerwood</i>; and the
colonists dogwood. Occasionally, where the volcanic blocks of
bluestone abutted along the edges of the creek, were two species
of <i>Hakea</i>, or native walnut, with others of the
<i>Proteaceæ, Grevillia, Lomatia</i>, and a dwarf species of
<i>Banksia</i>, or native honeysuckle. The large arborescent
<i>Banksia Australis</i> was abundant, and sprinkled occasionally
over all parts where the soil was sandy. Three species of the
<i>Euphrasia</i>, or native eyebright, and <i>Stilidiums</i> of
various species, were common to the pasture lands. <i>Clematis
gentianoides</i> and <i>Ranunculus</i>, of various species, were,
with many other plants, brilliantly in flower. Upon reaching the
creek, some of my companions walked into a neighboring lagoon,
for the purpose of catching eels (<i>eeoke</i>). With a small
spear in his hand, the aboriginal eel-catcher walks slowly and
cautiously about the shallow water, until he has trodden so
gently upon the object of his search as not to awaken its
attention. Although half-buried in the mud, its position is
judged with such accuracy, that, with one blow, the eel is
pierced by the native. Immediately he takes it out of the water,
and disables it by giving it a crush between his teeth. We
arrived at the foot of the mountain about sunset. In reaching it
we had been delayed while some of our friends secured a fine
kangaroo, which was shot by one of them, named Jemmy, in a small
patch of grass. It would appear that the kangaroo cannot, or does
not, notice objects directly ahead; and by Jemmy, with his gun
under his arm, cautiously creeping, under cover of a large bough,
which he carried in his hand (some others having placed
themselves in the rear), he was allowed to approach, shoot, and
secure his prey without difficulty. It was a noble specimen,
although not full-grown, and was carried in triumph to the camp
over the shoulders of Jemmy. In skinning the kangaroo, one of the
natives made his feet serve him very usefully. I have often had
occasion to remark how dexterous these people are in making use
of their feet. The kidney-fat they ate as soon as the entrails
were taken out. The hinder part roasted made us an excellent
evening meal. The tail, which is regarded as a great delicacy,
was cooked separately; and I do not remember ever having eaten
anything with greater gusto than the two joints of tail which
fell to my portion. The fore-quarter was given to the dogs, and
the bones and other portions of the tail, which the black fellows
could not eat, were thrown over their shoulders, and caught by
their wives, with less concern than they observed in feeding
their canine companions. The ladies received these scraps with a
quiet humility, which it was really quite charming to observe in
them, although I could never see such indifference manifested on
the part of the blacks towards their wives without aversion.</p>
<p>Our camping-place was on the rise of the mountain, behind
which flowed a small gurgling brook, with banks lined with the
tree-fern, <i>Billarderia</i>, and which the blacks call Quambee
Jack. The heart of the tree was cut out and eaten by the natives,
in the same manner as we have subsequently seen the aborigines in
north-eastern tropical Australia appropriate the crown or heart
of the <i>Corypha</i>, palm tree, as well that of the larger fern
tree, <i>Alsophilla elegans</i>, which in those parts assume a
height and size of stupendous magnitude. Here we stayed for the
night. Rising earlier in the morning than the rest, I took a
stroll up the valley of the creek, among a forest of fern trees.
Occasionally the climbing plants, which were thickly interspersed
with ferns, with the <i>Dodonea, Sassafraz, Leptospermum</i>, and
<i>Ozothamnus</i>, formed scrub so dense as merely to leave a
small opening, enabling me to take a sidelong peep, at intervals,
into, the valley of the creek below. In most cases, I observed
that the ground had been torn or scratched up. On our visit in
company with Jemmy, we afterwards learned that this was the work
of the Bullen Bullen, or lyre bird, in its search for large
worms, its favorite food.</p>
<p>When the rest of the party arose, one of them caught a native
porcupine, which abound at the foot of Koronth Marrabool. When
properly cooked, it is a dish by no means to be despised. The
country here being thickly wooded, the experience of Jemmy, who
acted as the guide to our party, was invaluable to us. He was an
excellent marksman, and often brought me birds of various kinds
which he had killed. Amongst them were several lyre birds. He
pointed out to us the disturbed patches of ground where these
birds had been seeking their prey; he also led us to various
spots where we could hear the ridiculous sounds of mimicry raised
by this truly Australian mocking bird. It possesses the power of
mimicing, with wondrous fidelity, the notes of the various other
birds, as well as the chuckle of the flying squirrel, and other
animals. It is so extremely shy that we could never get near
enough to examine one of them alive. The tails of those brought
to me by Jemmy were of great beauty, and I therefore preserved
them as specimens.</p>
<p>The native women sometimes went out by themselves, and
returned with a quantity of the liquid amber gum, which exudes
from the <i>Acaciæ decurrens</i>, or black wattle tree. This gum
they call <i>korong</i>. They prepare it as a relish for their
food in the following manner: having formed, of a sheet of wattle
bark, a trough to hold water (<i>willum</i>), the women soak the
gum until it assimilates with the water, and forms a thin
glutinous liquid; a little sugar, or manna, is then added to make
it palatable.</p>
<p>Some of the women brought large white grubs, the larvae of the
gigantic moth, which they considered as a dainty not easily to be
rejected. These grubs were slightly grilled before being eaten.
Some long tuberous roots, of a composite plant, were also
brought, and of which we partook. These plants produced a bunch
of tubers like the fingers on the hand, from whence they were
called <i>myrnong-myrnongatha</i>, being the native word for
"hand".</p>
<p>As we were returning towards the camp one evening. Jemmy
captured a native bear, or sloth, from among the branches of a
huge gum tree. None but a native would have observed the
creature, as the color of its wool so nearly resembled that of
the bark of the tree.</p>
<p>During the excursion, our diet consisted chiefly of opossum
and kangaroo, varied occasionally with the flesh of the porcupine
and wombat. The heart or crown of the fern tree, slightly
roasted, furnished us an acceptable dish, the taste of which
reminded me of the flavor of the cocoa-nut. Native potatoes, or
roots of the <i>Orchidaceæ</i>, were not wanting; those of the
<i>Gastrodia Sessamoides</i> were especially plentiful, large,
and well-flavored. One evening we took three wombats, and next
day the natives held a banquet, preceded, as a matter of course,
by a grand corroborree.</p>
<p>Proceeding upon our journey, we crossed several creeks and
streams, and eventually ascended the highest part of the Western
Port ranges. Each day I was enabled to add some fresh varieties
to my herbarium. The western mountains abound in healthy timber.
In this locality, too, there is plenty of a light, white wood,
which the natives call <i>weenth kalk kalk</i> (fire stick), as
they obtain a light from it, by means of friction, very readily.
This kind of wood is also called <i>thaal kalk</i> (sounding
stick), because a solid, ringing sound can be produced by two
round billets being beaten together. When the natives hold a
corroborree, a festival in which dancing forms the chief element,
those who do not join in the dance beat time with the sounding
stick, while they sing continually, "Yah-yabba, yah-yabba,
yah."</p>
<p>After remaining in this locality long enough to enable me to
obtain all the species of plants which I found desirable, and
with a wombat, a porcupine, a native bear, and a kangaroo, which
my companions intended as presents for some of their friends whom
they had left behind at the settlement, we turned homewards.</p>
<p>We determined upon our return the following morning, by way of
Dandenong Creek, near, the station then belonging to the Rev. Mr.
Clowe, but now the property of Mr. Beilby. Unfortunately, shortly
after sundown, there were signs of rain, the sky became overcast,
thunder was heard in the distance, and forked lightning played
among the branches of the trees. The women were busy with their
tomahawks in stripping large flakes, or sheets of bark, from the
stringy-bark trees, and setting forks and saplings whereon to
place the bark for the erection of willams, or dwellings, as a
shelter. The only parties disengaged were the black fellows,
whose duties appeared to be to pray for fine weather by a
continued melancholy chant. This office they continued for a
short time after the rain commenced, and when all the rest of us
had retired under shelter; but finding that their good divinity,
in the present instance, was deaf to their appeals, they
exclaimed, "Marmingatha bullarto porkwadding: quanthueeneera?"
"Marmingatha is very sulky, and why?" and commenced throwing
ashes in the direction in which they believed she resided; and
saying, "T'see waugh!" an exclamation of contempt and defiance,
they returned to the willams. In this instance they did not
believe in her. The storm raged for a short time, but, like all
other occurrences, whether of divine or human agency, ceased, and
towards midnight all was again calm, and a clear moon and
brilliant starlight night succeeded. Sleep had sealed the eyes of
most of our party, when a gruff, "Noo-jee, noo-jee" (Anglice,
"That will do, that will do") was heard in response to the sharp
whizzing bark of poor old "Go-away", the dog, upon which the camp
was fully awake, and greeting the new comer. Our nocturnal
visitor was "Big Jack" (a notice of whose death from cholera was
noticed, a few weeks since, in the Melbourne journals), the
husband of the plump, curly-haired, pleasing, and musical-voiced
Mary Anne, of Yore, but now decrepid with pains at
Moordy-Yallock. After helping himself, without "by'r leave", to a
plentiful supply of the various viands, he coiled in, and we were
soon all asleep.</p>
<p>Shortly after breakfast all the older men disappeared, leaving
me, and Jemmy, and two or three youths, to take charge of the
camp and its interesting and astonishing lovely female occupants.
On this occasion, my desire to acquire a knowledge of their
language appeared to have been observed, and little Sally Sally,
the affianced bride of Jemmy (two most faithful likenesses of
whom we observed the other day in a window in Elizabeth-street,
by Mr. Haseldon), undertook the part of instructing me, and I
consequently commenced taking my first lessons in the language.
My clumsy attempts at pronouncing their soft Italian, although
somewhat guttural idiom, was the occasion of loud bursts of
laughter from Sally Sally, in which she was joined by the other
females, and occasionally by the young men.</p>
<p>The first lesson consisted, as usual, in. making me acquainted
with the names for the various parts of the body; and commencing,
first, with the hand, "Myrnong-atha"&mdash;foot,
"Geenong-ah-tha"&mdash;leg, "Thorrong-ah-tha"&mdash;the boots,
"Geenong-alook," or, covering for the foot&mdash;trowsers,
"Thorong-alook," or covering for the legs&mdash;gloves,
"Myrnong-alook"&mdash;head, "Gowong-atha"&mdash;hat, "Cobbera
Cowong"&mdash;eyes, "Myrring-ah-tha"&mdash;mouth,
"Worong-ah-tha"&mdash;ear, "Kidnong-ah-tha,"&mdash;hair, "Yarra
gondackahtah." We observed that every substance of a flowing
character was accompanied by the word "Yarra," in its various
forms and modifications. The name of salt-water, rolling in on
the beach, was "Yarrain"&mdash;the river Yarra Yarra, "flowing
flowing"&mdash;the beard and whiskers, "Yarragondook," &amp;c.
For further information touching their language, the readers
should refer to my work on the aboriginal language, printed at
the <em>Argus</em> office in 1851, the production of which work
was the result of the present lesson. This morning we observed
that they practised some little amusements among themselves, and
some were playing with a puzzle made of string&mdash;"cudgi,
cudgick"&mdash;made from the fibre of a tree (<i>Sida
pulchella</i>) common on the banks of the mountain streams, as
well as occasionally on the banks of the Yarra. This puzzle was
played between two individuals, and required two pairs of hands,
in the same manner as the juvenile game of "cats' cradle", common
to our own country. Many opossums had been caught during our
excursion, and the skins were now pegged out on sheets of bark,
and stretched to their fullest tension with wooden pegs of the
<i>Pomaderris apetala</i>, or dogwood. The points of the pegs had
been previously scraped with a piece of broken bottle, and
hardened in the fire so as to enable them to act as a substitute
for European tacks and nails; and a quantity of them was the
never-failing accompaniment of a "Baggerooks", or black woman's
basket, or "Beenack". After the opossum skins are sufficiently
stretched and dried, they are very curiously marked, the work of
the men; animals, kangaroos, emus, as well as the human figure,
are frequently represented by ft piece of broken glass bottle,
or, when not to be obtained, the bowl of a metal spoon, with one
side filed sharp, for the purpose of scratching the skin when in
the soft state. Prior to the introduction among them of needles
and thread, they used the finer tendons and sinews of the
kangaroo and opossum for thread, and the sharp-pointed bone of a
fish or kangaroo for a needle, in sewing their rugs. In those
days they needed not the aid of foreign ornament, but were amply
adorned with strings, and a necklace called "Coornburt", composed
of a number of short pieces of reed, strung together, and hanging
pendant from the neck. Through the septa of the noses of the
young dandies of the male sex were large pieces of bone running
transversely through, and forming a kind of spritsail-yard. The
young ladies wore around them a kind of bustle, composed of a
ropeyarn-like substance, which hung in pendant waves halfway down
to the knees. With their hair they took great pains, and, to
judge from the extreme anxiety observed in carefully using and
putting by into their baskets every string or other decorative
material, it would seem to have been connected with one of their
rude superstitions; and, as I subsequently discovered, such was
the case. Pomade and grease of opossum fat was rubbed abundantly
on the hair, a piece of gaily-colored rag being afterwards tied
around the head. Fortunately for us, we had taken our first day's
lesson in languages before their elaborate toilette of the day,
otherwise we should have committed a breach of aboriginal
etiquette, in leaving a neighborhood whose perfume resembled not
the aroma of the mignionette or jasmine.</p>
<p>Towards sundown the old warriors returned, as warriors of any
nation should, with shield, helimar, spear, jagged geraor, and
the "wommera", or throwing-stick, an instrument necessary in
giving the proper impetus to the spear. The helimar, with many
other of its ornamental companions, is now extinct. It was made
of the thin piece of wood which may be occasionally seen forming
protuberances from the large trees; and, in being removed, the
outer portion of the bark was taken off, and the whole affair
finished into an excellent shape, with a handle through the
middle of the under portion, whilst on the outer surface was cut
or carved a number of zig-zag characters or stripes, on which, in
whatever way the spear of the enemy alighted, its point was
caught. Our friends had brought with them, in addition to the
shields, a plentiful supply of some other particularly
formidable-looking implements of warfare. They appeared to be in
a high state of excitement, as compared with the usually
philosophic and well-bred bearing which in general characterised
this sooty generation. A hive of native bees had been discovered
by one of the children&mdash;a yan yean, or boy&mdash;who had
caught one of the little insects, not much larger than a
musquito, while dipping its little proboscis into the blossom of
a native honeysuckle, <i>Banksia</i>, extracting from the
nectaries of the flower its sweet juices. The little fellow was
caught and marked by the boy with the feather-like seed of a
composite plant, and followed to its home in a neighboring gum
tree; thus betraying the little industrious community of which it
formed a member. The boy returned to the camp, and communicated
the result of his discovery, when two large hollow sheets of bark
were procured, thus forming bowls, which were carried to the tree
and speedily filled with pure honey.</p>
<p>The native bees are very small, half the size of the common
house-fly, and are stingless.</p>
<p>The bellicose intentions of the warriors appeared to lead them
in the direction of the Plenty ranges, and the Goulburn river, as
they took that direction in leaving the camp; and, as I had not
yet visited that part of the country, I determined upon
prevailing upon Jemmy and one or two of his companions to
accompany me in that direction.</p>
<p>My desire met with a ready response, and the next morning was
determined on as the time for setting out. The warriors made
their exit simultaneously, during the silence of the night, as is
their wont. In taking the direction of the ranges, we were in
some measure actuated by a desire to see to what use they would
apply the spears at the fight, if fight was intended; and we had
now gained sufficient knowledge of the natives as induced us to
place the strictest reliance upon their good faith of respecting
our claim as a non-combatant, to prevent any fear of being
compromised in the results of the campaign.</p>
<p>On starting next morning, we travelled for some distance
through a forest composed of several sorts of bushy species of
the acacia, of which the most prominent and troublesome were the
prickly wattle, <i>Acacia verticillata</i>. After emerging from
this, we had for some distance an open country, until reaching a
part of the creek on which now stands the station of Mr. Turner,
where we camped at noon to take luncheon. A porcupine and a
wollabee had been caught during this morning's stage. From this
creek we travelled in a direction bearing to the left, and found
large clusters of the Daviesia latifolia, or native hop; and
wherever this plant was common, the neighborhood abounded in
crab-holes. We soon reached what was afterwards called Thomson's
Station (now Frencham's), near the Anderson's Creek diggings. We
camped here for the night, and, after travelling a few miles the
following day in the direction of the ranges, learned that
peaceful overtures had been made by the Plenty blacks, and
accepted by our advanced plenipotentiaries; we again returned to
Thomson's Station, and from thence commenced our final return to
the settlement. Passing through the scrubby ground and
thinly-timbered and undulating country about Heidelberg, we
reached the settlement, after an absence of a few days.</p>
<p>We shall now endeavour to vary our narrative with the results
of our travels with Dr. Leichhardt, in the north-eastern tropical
portions of the tropics of the Colony.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<p class="negindent"><small>NARRATIVE OF DR. LEICHHARDT'S
EXPEDITION: ITS OBJECT BEING TO EXPLORE THE INTERIOR OF
AUSTRALIA, TO DISCOVER THE EXTENT OF STURT'S DESERT, AND THE
CHARACTER OF THE WESTERN AND NORTH-WESTERN COAST, AND TO OBSERVE
THE GRADUAL CHANGE IN VEGETATION AND ANIMAL LIFE, FROM ONE SIDE
OF THE CONTINENT TO THE OTHER.</small></p>
<p><span class="a">Dr. Leichhardt</span> did not expect to be
able to accomplish this overland journey to Swan River in less
than two years and a half.</p>
<p>He purposed to travel over his old route as far as Peak
Ranges, and then to shape his course westward; but thought it not
impossible, as his course depended on water, that he should be
obliged to reach the Gulf of Carpentaria, and follow up some
river to its source.</p>
<p>It now becomes our duty to let our readers know with what
success these intentions were carried out.</p>
<p>There are, perhaps, few names more closely associated with the
rise and progress of the Australian colonies than that of the
lamented Br. Ludwig Leichhardt, whether we consider the success
attendant on his first expedition to Port Essington, and the
valuable addition made to the geographical and scientific
departments of the hitherto <i>terra incognito</i>, or tropical
portions of the colony; or the hardships attending the two
subsequent expeditions, in which he contemplated nothing less
than the exploration of the whole of the island lying between
Sydney and Swan River, with its animal and vegetable productions.
The author acted in the capacity of naturalist and botanist to
the expedition, and collected upwards of one thousand plants,
with, where practicable, their specimen papers in triplicate; and
among which were some, forming new genera, species, and
varieties, in the Botanical Gardens, Melbourne, which have been
determined by the Government botanist, Dr. Ferdinand Mueller.</p>
<p>Until our arrival in Sydney, we were personally unknown to Dr.
Leichhardt, although, with others, we formed one of those who
admired the steadfast and courageous manner in which he had just
terminated an undertaking that rendered his name, from one end of
the continent to the other, as familiar as household words. My
arrangements with the doctor were effected through a written
correspondence; one of our conditions on joining the party was an
equal share of any specimens in natural history which might be
collected during the journey, and this threatened to be the cause
of my not joining in the interesting movement of the forthcoming
expedition. In a few days I received a reply favorable to my
expectations,, with instructions to be in Sydney in time to start
on the first of October. On the receipt of this letter, I made
instant preparations for my departure, and took my passage in the
"Himmalaya", under the command of Captain Burn. I bade farewell
to this good city at a time memorable in the annals of Australia
Felix, as on that day Dr. Palmer, the present respected Speaker
of our Legislative House of Assembly, but who at that time
occupied the civic chair of our then infant municipality, had the
pleasing duty of reading the Riot Act to the playfully but
mischievously-disposed citizens of Melbourne. I trust this
interesting and important epocha may not be overlooked by the
compilers of almanacs, in manufacturing their next chronological
summary of <i>remarkable events</i>. But to proceed.</p>
<p>We left Melbourne on a Tuesday, in September, in the year of
grace 1846, and, after a pleasing passage of six days, reached
the picturesque entrance to the celebrated harbor of Port Jackson
early on the Sunday morning following; and a gentle breeze wafted
us slowly into the harbor, near the Circular Wharf, where we
anchored in the evening. Our slow progress up the river gave us
ample time to admire what has been on so many occasions, and by
able writers, graphically described. The apparently
artificially-cut semi-circular inlets on either side, and in the
back-ground scenery the most picturesque, relieved with
innumerable villa residences, built from the natural free-stone,
the abundance of which, combined with prison labor in former
years, conduced materially in rendering Sydney, in point of
buildings and architecture, one of the most important cities in
the Austral Asiatic colonies.</p>
<p>On the following morning, we paid our respects to Dr.
Leichhardt, by whom we were kindly received. We found him busily
engaged in packing up, arranging, and putting by the various
collections in natural history, the result of his former travels,
in which he was being assisted by his faithfully attached friend
(of the 63rd), Lieutenant Lynd, barrackmaster, and with whom we
had been personally acquainted some years previously, during our
botanical travels in Tasmania. Dr. Leichhardt expressed his
satisfaction at our speedy arrival, as it enabled us to accompany
his personal staff overland to Darling Downs. Had our arrival
been delayed, we should have had the alternative of reaching
Moreton Bay by sea, in which case we should have been deprived of
the pleasure of an inspection of the Hunters River, the table
land of New England, and the fertile district of Darling Downs,
one of the most celebrated squatting localities in either
northern or southern Australia. This lovely country was
discovered by poor Cunningham, the botanist, who has long since
paid his debt at the altar of science, during one of Sir Thomas
Mitchell's expeditions, in which he took the part of naturalist;
his disappearance and death occurred most mysteriously, during a
botanical reconnaisance from the camp. The only remains of this
unfortunate gentleman was the remnant of a coat which he was
known to have worn when be absented himself from his companions.
This melancholy circumstance occurred on the Bogan, a tributary
of the Darling, which, next to the Murray, forms one of the great
arteries of the western system of waters. How many botanists and
naturalists have met with a similar fate to poor
Cunningham!&mdash;Gilbert, Kennedy, Leichhardt, and lastly poor
Strange, collector for Gould, the celebrated ornithologist, of
London. Mr. Strange was one of our oldest and most constant
contributors and correspondents: he had just returned from a
visit to Europe, by the "Vimiera". Two months before seeing the
melancholy account of his death by the blacks,. in the <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i>, which occurred in the Wide Bay district, he
called for the purpose of seeing us in Melbourne, and for the
first time, after a series of years in which we were
correspondents, to effect a <i>personal</i> acquaintance. We did
not meet, and in two or three short months he was numbered with
the dead; and let us hope that, "after life's fitful fever, he
sleeps well,"&mdash;if a man can be said to have had time to
arrange his mind for that great event while suffering from the
effect of several barbed spears, which had entered his body in
various places. "Peace to his manes." And now to again proceed
with the more legitimate subject of Leichhardt's movements.</p>
<p>It was proposed to leave Sydney on the following evening; and
from tie multiplicity of bis arrangements, and the many calls on
his time, which under present circumstanced he could so ill
afford to spare, he was desirous of concealing his intentions
from the public. It is needless to say that in this attempt he
was disappointed; as one who occupied so much of the notice of
the people, a kind and attentive surveillance followed his every
movement; and, on reaching the steamer "Thistle" at 10 p.m. a
large concourse of the citizens was in attendance, offering their
congratulations and good wishes for the successful termination of
his intended and arduous undertaking. Among those who wished for
an introduction, were some friends of our own. Excepting,
however, to two or three who accompanied us on hoard, we did not
encroach upon the doctor's attention.</p>
<p>Our passage up the Hunter as far as Newcastle being performed
in the night time, we had no opportunity of observing the
character of the adjoining country. We stepped upon deck at six
o'clock the next morning, and found ourselves abreast of the
harbor at Newcastle. We saw little to admire in this township,
and believe its principal recommendation to be an abundant supply
of indifferently-good coal. We reached the pretty township of
Raymond Terrace in time to partake of a sumptuous breakfast with
the Rev. Mr. Spencer, the officiating minister of that place. We
waited for the arrival of the "Cornubia", on board of which
vessel was our baggage, horses, and another group of our future
<i>compagnons de voyage</i>&mdash;Mr. James Perry, saddler; Mr.
Boecking, cook; and a Mr. Myers (as far as we remember),
professor of music&mdash;to which we were introduced.</p>
<p>The next morning we started for Irrawing, the residence of
James King, Esq., long celebrated for his growth and manufacture
of colonial wine, as well as having been the first to establish a
pottery for the manufacture of delf. Here we took the remainder
of our horses, which had been grazing in Mr. K.'s paddock.
awaiting our arrival; after which we proceeded to the residence
of Lieutenant Caswell, where we were again kindly received, and
our whole party most hospitably entertained until the following
morning. From hence we made a start for the village of Stroud, at
Port Stevens, the head station of the Australian Agricultural
Company, at that time under the management of Captain P.P. King,
of the Royal Navy. Dr. Leichhardt was anxious to reach that
establishment, as he wished to see the twelve mules he had bought
from the company, being apprehensive that some delay would be
necessary in breaking in these playful animals. He had also
purchased from William Charles Wentworth, Esq., M.L.C., the flock
of Thibet goats, consisting of 270 head, at five shillings each.
The doctor's object in this purchase was that he conceived they
would easily travel, and furnish a supply of meat during the
early part of the expedition, in which case they would not impede
our progress; and by the time that portion of our live stock was
consumed, our mainstay, the bullocks, would be quiet, and carry
us to Swan river, even should the time exceed the period of three
years.</p>
<p>We made an early start, as the distance from hence to Stroud
was of a somewhat hilly character. In the course of the day's
journey, we had an opportunity, for the first time, of seeing
some fine specimens of the apple-tree gum (<i>Angophera
latifolia), Sterculia heterophylla (Corryong</i> tree of the
northern districts), and, among crevices in the sandstone-rock,
the <i>Dwarf zamia</i>.</p>
<p>On reaching the end of our journey, we were, as usual, kindly
met and welcomed by the inhabitants, who furnished accommodation
to the whole of the party during our sojourn, which exceeded a
fortnight.</p>
<p>At Stroud, the various little gardens were divided by hedges
of rose-trees, geraniums, olives, lemon and orange trees; the
latter were of luxuriant growth, and had been clipped in the same
manner as the larch, yew, and similar trees in Britain. The
doctor was not wrong as regarded the mules, which proved to be
stubborn to the fullest extent of the proverb&mdash;"stubborn as
a mule", and as active as monkeys. Not to tire the reader with
what might be appropriately termed "a chapter of accidents", the
consequence of the attempt at breaking in the mules, and in the
course of which an indelibly-impressed mark of an acute crescent,
the result of a kick on the shin, fell to our share, it will be
sufficient to state that Dr. Leichhardt purchased from the
company fourteen, for which he paid fourteen pounds ten shillings
per head. Many of these animals were of a cross from the
Cleveland breed of horses, and in some cases were upwards of
seventeen hands high. Mr. Hovendon Hely was despatched, in
company with Wommai, a black fellow, native of Port Stephens, to
Windermere, one of Mr. Wentworth's stations, for the purpose of
bringing in the flock of goats. In three days they returned with
their interesting flock of live stock. The prevailing color of
the goats was white, the lot consisting entirely of ewes and
wethers, and did not include a single billy. Fortunately,
however, we were very kindly presented with a quiet and perfect
male specimen by a gentleman at Gloster. This animal was a great
pet with Wommai, the native, who, at his urgent request, was
allowed to accompany us in the expedition; and, during its
continuance, the reader will discover that he did "yeoman's
service."</p>
<p>Everything being now, as the doctor imagined, in readiness,
and as he wished to reach the bounds of civilisation as early as
possible, we made another start for the table land of New
England.</p>
<p>It must have been extremely gratifying to Dr. Leichhardt's
feelings to witness the many very liberal offers made to himself
and party by the various residents at this interesting village,
each person vieing with the other in pressing upon our acceptance
articles which they considered might be of service to us during
our long and solitary journey through the wilderness; but as the
main feature of the expedition was to take only such articles as
could not be dispensed with, they were politely declined.</p>
<p>Perhaps in no part of the work could an outline of the very
limited amount of stores, and other matters, which our means of
carriage allowed, be more appropriately famished to our
readers.</p>
<p>It is, of course, generally understood that our only way of
transporting our supplies was on the backs of the mules taken
from Stroud; each mule carrying one hundred weight and a half.
The loads were so arranged as to be packed in three separate
lots, fifty pounds in each leathern bag on either side of the
animal, and the third placed on the top, so as partly to rest on
the side loads; and over all was thrown and buckled a strong
leathern belt, or circingle. The quantity of flour taken was just
sufficient to admit of a daily allowance of three ounces and a
half to each man for a period of eight months, by which time it
was supposed that they would have become sufficiently abstemious
in their habits to enable them to dispense with that "staff of
life" during the remainder of the journey, which it was expected
would terminate in two years from that period. The party
consisted of nine individuals: this quantity was usually made
into a damper, and subdivided into nine parts; and we can assure
our readers that to nine hungry fellows it appeared to be a
mighty small affair. As regarded the meat department, that was
allowed to carry itself in the shape of bullocks. Of clothing,
each man took two pairs of spare trousers, one pair of blucher
boots, one blanket, and other articles upon the same ratio; we
had also each a light oiled calico poncho, through which in wet
weather we were enabled to poke our head; and the bottom part of
that article thus protected our lower limbs, as well as forming a
shelter to our saddle-bags and blankets, which were strapped over
the horse's withers; we had also thereon fastened, by their
double wire handles, two pannikins, which were so made as that
the smaller fitted into the larger one where it was fastened. We
had also two small tents made (unfortunately) of the same (by far
too thin and light) material as the ponchos, into which we, so
long as they continued tenable, crept and sheltered ourselves
from the wet and inclement weather, for which the year that we
commenced our journey (1846) was remarkable.</p>
<p>During our journey from Stroud to Gloster, we passed over some
fine,, rich, but broken country; and among the crevices of the
moss and lichen-covered blocks of rock, we saw some beautiful
species of <i>Epiphites, Dendrobium linguiformis, Dendrobium
speciosum</i>, and a smaller glaucous-leaved species; with
<i>Acrosticum alcicorne, Cymbidium sauveolens</i>. The glutinous
but sweetly-tasted berries appeared to be much relished by the
aborigines, as well as by ourselves subsequently during our long
journey in the wilderness, as by that time there was not the
slightest degree of fastidiousness remaining among us, We were
kindly entertained at this place by Mr. Darby, whose residence
was beautifully situated near the base of two remarkably
bluff-looking mountains, called the Buckens. Here we had the
pleasure of meeting, for the first time, a gentleman who has
since made himself, or has been made, the subject of a world-wide
reputation, and for some time formed an ample field for colonial
discussion. It is needless to say that the party to whom we
allude is Mr. Hargraves, who, on that occasion, certainly could
lay no claim to the precept held out in the much-quoted line,
"Coming events cast their shadows before," as he was then looking
for timber, in which he was a dealer; and not for what has since,
by an extraordinary accident, laid the basis of a magnificent
fortune&mdash;<span class="u">Gold</span>.</p>
<p>We still continued our journey, through small farms and
stations, the property of the company, and through which ran many
free-flowing streams and rivers. At all of these places we were
kindly treated; and on the Monday following the time of leaving
Stroud, we commenced the ascent of Hungry Hill, whose top forms
the table land of New England.</p>
<p>In the course of our ascent up the hill, we observed, for the
first time, the large hillocks made by the white ant; many of
them three to four feet in height, and, being constructed of the
deep red clay common to the locality, they presented a singular
and imposing appearance. Where they are situated near a hut, the
hutkeepers convert them into ovens for baking bread; and in any
case they form, if properly managed, floors as firm as Roman
cement. We reached the top of Hungry Hill early in the evening,
and were heartily welcomed by Mr. Lowry, the superintendent of
the station, which also belonged to the A.A. Company.</p>
<p>After spelling one day at Mr. Lowry's, on the following
morning we commenced our descent on the other side of the hill.
We reached the residence of Mr. Thomas Rusden, at Salisbury
Plains, New England, where we were kindly entertained until the
arrival of the rest of the party in charge of the goats.</p>
<p>The nights here were very cold. The elevation, taken by the
boiling water apparatus of the Rev. W.B. Clarke, of St.
Leonard's, was 3,127 feet.</p>
<p>From Salisbury Plains, we continued our journey over New
England, through Falconer Plains, at an elevation of 4,386 feet,
until reaching Rosenthall, the station of Mr. Bracker, at Darling
Downs. Here we remained a few days, and made our final departure
for Jimba, the furthest advanced station, and from where we
intended entering upon our travels through the wilderness.</p>
<p>Not to tire the reader, it will be sufficient to remark that
our journey from Rosenthall to this station was over a country
unequalled in any other part of Australia, either as regards
beauty of scenery, variety of surface, or the rich character of
its grazing capabilities. All the intervening stations are
situated on creeks and watercourses, falling from the western
slope of the coast range, meandering through rich extensive
plains until they join the Condamine river, which appears to form
for a great distance the separation of the sandstone country to
the westward from the rich volcanic plains to the eastward. These
plains have become remarkable as the depositories of the remains
of extinct species of animals of a gigantic size&mdash;the
<i>marsupial</i> representatives of the <i>Pachydermal</i> order
of other continents.</p>
<p>The station of Messrs. Hughs and Isaacs (Gowrie) has proved to
be wonderfully prolific in the production of these gigantic
remains; indeed, fresh specimens generally offer themselves after
an unusually high flood, when portions of the banks of the creek
and water-courses have given way. We believe Mr. Isaacs deserves
credit for having sent the first perfect specimens for the
examination of Professor Owen, of London, who devoted a pamphlet
to that especial subject. It is, perhaps, remarkable that similar
remains should have been discovered in the vicinity of the
Hopkins, Lake Colac, and other parts of the Port Phillip
district.</p>
<p>Among the herbage, which was luxuriant, were many plants of
the <i>Leguminous</i> order, consisting of several species of
<i>Swainsonia</i>, whose blossoms were both large and showy, and
of the most brilliant colors; amidst which, in the richest soil
and most sheltered situations, the <i>Glycine bimaculata</i>, and
large groups of the <i>Crinum</i>, white lily. The <i>Mimosa
terminalis</i> (native sensitive plant) was most abundant, its
densely <i>pinnatifid phyllodia</i> collapsing at the slightest
touch. In places which were slightly elevated, many species of
Acacia made their appearance, including the celebrated Weeping
Myall (<i>A. pendula</i>), with an erect-growing species, known
as Coxen's Myall. The timber was principally composed of the box
and apple-tree, together with the Moreton Bay ash and three
species of the <i>Eucalypti</i>.</p>
<p>On reaching Jimba, we had the satisfaction of finding that Mr.
John Mann had arrived from Moreton Bay with our stores, which he
had brought from Sydney by sea, as also a Mr. Turnbull, from Port
Stevens.</p>
<p>Our party now consisted of nine individuals. Dr. Ludwig
Leichhardt, leader; Daniel Bunce, botanist and naturalist; John
Mann, draftsman; Hovenden Hely; James Perry, saddler; Henry
Boecking, a German cook; Mr. Turnbull, assistant stock-keeper:
Wommai (<i>alias</i> Jemmy), and Harry Brown, both aboriginal
natives of Port Stevens. The latter had accompanied Dr.
Leichhardt in his former expedition to Port Essington. Of stock,
we had 108 sheep, which had been presented to the party by the
various gentlemen through whose stations we had travelled; Mr.
Dennis, of Jimba, having very liberally given twenty out of the
number. Our goats were 270, bullocks forty, horses fifteen, mules
thirteen.</p>
<p>On December 7, 1846, having made every necessary preparation,
we left Jimba, and, following the course of the Condamine river,
which now presented a mere chain of water holes, we made a
station which had been lately taken up by a Mr. Goggs, formerly
of the firm of Goggs and Walpole, whose station was on the Yarra
Yarra, near the Survey Paddock, Richmond, now called
Hawthorne.</p>
<p>December 8.&mdash;Left for Mr. Stephens', another advanced
station on the Condamine, the doctor and myself driving the goats
and sheep. This was a tedious day's journey to the party in
charge of the cattle and stores, as well as ourselves, owing to
the frequency of <i>Brigalowe</i> scrub, which rendered the
course very circuitous. The <i>Brigalowe</i> is a species of
hard-wooded <i>Acacia</i>, apparently identical with the rosewood
<i>Acacia</i> of Moreton Bay. At the latter place it assumes the
character of a tree of considerable height, and isolated. Its
leaves are long and slightly falcate, and of a silvery grey
color. In addition to the scrub, the long, tangled tussocks of
grass and <i>Polygonum</i>, offered great impediments to the
sheep and goats; and we were compelled to camp for the night.
Having no provisions, we had to fast until the following
morning.</p>
<p>December 9.&mdash;We made an early start this morning for the
station of Mr. Stephens, where we found that our companions had
arrived late the night before, with the cattle, mules, and
stores. Owing to the fatigue attendant on yesterday's stage, the
doctor determined on remaining a day to rest the sheep and goats,
as well as to enable the party to wash what clothes they might
have dirty. We, of course, made up for our long fast of the
preceding day and night. Peculiar to the scrub through which we
passed, was a species of <i>Lemonia</i>, producing a fruit the
size of a small apple. The stem is famished with small
privet-like leaves, and armed with thorns, or spines, of
considerable length, very sharp, and consequently, however
agreeable their produce, the shrubs themselves formed an
unpleasant obstruction to our movements while travelling through
the scrub in which they abounded.</p>
<p>The weeping Myall was here literally overgrown with a very
pretty and showy species of <i>Loranthus</i>, This parasite was
at the time in blossom, and of which we obtained specimens.
<i>Pentophyllum elatum</i> and <i>Ranunculus inundatus</i> were
common in and around the melon holes, which were frequent, and of
a tenacious and calcareous nature. The horses ate greedily of a
species of <i>Eryngium</i>. A new composite, with white blossoms,
made its appearance. The banks of the river were lined with the
dark, sombre-colored <i>Casuarina</i>, of a tall pyramidal
growth, These trees presented the nearest approach to the fir
tribe of any we had as yet seen. The heaps of a large kind of
muscle shell (<i>Unio</i>.) were apparent on the banks of the
river and in the scrubs, to which they had probably been carried,
cooked, and eaten by the natives, whose tracks were plainly to be
seen. We disturbed many of the short, knobby-tailed sleeping
lizard (<i>Agama</i>); Jemmy killed one, from which he took a
number of eggs with soft shells, which he cooked and ate; he very
kindly invited us to partake of his dainty repast. Kangaroo and
Wallabee tracks crossed the scrubs in various directions.</p>
<p>December 10. Left Stephens' station, which proved to be the
last between us and the wilderness, and from the time of leaving
whence we expected to be confined to our own little party until
we succeeded in reaching the "land of the west," namely, Swan
River; and in order to effect which the doctor conceived would
take at least between two and three years. The reader may easily
imagine the cordial and friendly parting we took of our friends
the Stephens prior to leaving the station.</p>
<p>We continued a north by west course, following the valley of
the Condamine, until half-past two p.m., when we camped, having
accomplished, as we supposed, a distance of ten miles. About
seven miles from Stephens' station, and thirty-two from Jimba, we
found the skull of a horse, which on showing to Dr. Leichhardt,
he at once pronounced as being the remains of the one formerly
left by Mr. Pemberton Hodgson, while prosecuting the search for
the doctor, during the time he was supposed to have been lost,
while engaged in exploring the country between Moreton Bay and
Port Essington. His alleged death created no ordinary sensation
at the time, and was the theme of some very elegant and touching
verses by his friend Lieutenant Lynd and others.</p>
<p>At a short distance from were we found the skull, a heap of
bones was also seen; they had been partly burnt, and evidently
formed a portion of the same animal.</p>
<p>The white lily grew here in patches, on the red puffy soil,
producing a large coated bulb like the onion; its seeds are
spongy and resemble the human testes, and from this circumstance
the natives call it Byarrong, their name for that part of the
body. They made us understand that the bulbs were a deadly
poison. For dinner a fat cake was made of two pounds of flour,
and afterwards divided into nine portions; and to avoid anything
like partiality in the distribution, one of the party turned his
back while another (Mr. Mann) called out to know to whom the
pieces he then touched were to be given. This system was
continued during the whole term of the expedition. Our night
watching was divided into four parts, two persons in each watch
of two and a half hour's duration. Latitude of our camp, 26 deg.
46 sec. 23 min.</p>
<p>December 11.&mdash;This day, for the first four or five miles,
our course was N.W. and by N. when we came suddenly upon a large
patch of boggy soil, into which the mules would persist m going,
and several of them became bogged up to their girths. The spade
that we had brought with us for the twofold purpose of either
digging wells or graves, as either became requisite was brought
into use in extricating them from the mud. After catching and
reloading the mules we made another starts changing our course to
west and by north. The country was a red, puffy sand, and very
wet, and laborious travelling for the horses and mules. We
encamped at three p.m., at what the Doctor called Charley's
Creek. We had scarcely succeeded in unloading the mules, when L
were visited by a very heavy shower of rain, accompanied by
thunder and lightning. After the weather had cleared up, we
rigged our two thin calico tents, and a sheep was killed for the
first time in preference to another goat, the latter being the
best travellers. On unpacking our kitchen utensils, we found that
the handle of our only fryingpan was unfortunately broken, this
was a source of great vexation to Bucking, the cook. From the
number of tracks of black fellows seen during the day's stage, we
had every reason to apprehend the close proximity of those sable
gentry, and a close watch was ordered to be kept during the
night.</p>
<p>About ten o'clock there was a great commotion in the camp,
many parties imagining that they saw a small fire in the
distance, of course supposed to proceed from a camp of blacks. At
eleven p.m., during the doctor's watch, the whole of our stock,
excepting three horses, and the sheep and goats, gallopped off
simultaneously at great speed through the mud up the creek, nor
could we account for this unusual commotion, unless by supposing
that they had either seen or smelt the black fellows, who, for
the remainder of the night were supposed to be, as our two black
fellows remarked, <i>close up</i>.</p>
<p>December 12.&mdash;It was not until daylight this morning that
we discovered we had the three horses remaining, on two of which
Mr. Hely and Brown were dispatched in search of the missing
cattle. At noon a number of blacks made their appearance, to whom
we perhaps unjustly attributed the loss of our stock, for which
reason they met with a very cool reception; indeed, the doctor
waved them off with his hand. This was a hint they could not or
would not understand, as they continued for some time to advance
towards us; they at length, however, turned in the direction of a
small patch of scrub, where they made a small fire and camped. In
a short time the doctor visited them, taking with him the handle
of the fryingpan, which he presented to them. They did not appear
to appreciate this gift very highly, as after looking at it they
threw it carelessly on the ground. Among their number was a fine
chubby little boy, who caught hold of my hand, in which I had a
small piece of tobacco: "Bacco by &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,"
exclaimed the little urchin, shewing they had not only seen
whites before, but had picked up as usual some of the worst words
used in our language, and what was more remarkable, it proved to
be the extent of their knowledge of English, as we endeavoured to
obtain from them some information respecting our missing stock,
but we could not succeed in making ourselves understood. Many of
these blacks appeared to have a habit of closing one eye, or that
organ was wanting altogether; they appeared to suffer much from
ophthalmia, and each individual carried a small branch for the
purpose of brushing off the flies which were both numerous and
troublesome, and settled in large numbers around their eyes.
Their bodies were horribly scarified, evidently inflicted by
sharp weapons. We afterwards learned that they were in the habit
of fighting hand to hand, inflicting on each other deep and
dangereous wounds with pieces of stone, wood, bones, and other
articles made sharp, and used for fighting instruments. I was
much struck by the similarity of many of their words to those
used by the aborigines at Melbourne, as instance the following,
which are precisely the same: head, cowong; foot, geenong; eyes,
myrring; nose, cong; leg, thirrong; mouth, worong; hair,
yarragong; whiskers, yarra-gondock; teeth, leeang; fire, weenth;
water, baanth; bark, willam; sun, nowing; moon, menia; this word
slightly differs, as the blacks at Melbourne call that planet
Meeniyang. There is also a trifling difference in their name for
stars, tutbiern, the Melbourne word, being toothyroong. Mr.
Turnbull and Wommai, who had al§o been in search of the cattle,
returned in the evening without success. They tracked them to a
dense brigalowe scrub; among the cattle tracks they observed
those of two blackfellows, who had very probably been the cause
of the dilemma. Neither Mr. Hely nor Brown returned this night.
The thermometer at two p.m., 104, while hanging under the shade
of a large gum tree. Latitude 26° 44'.</p>
<p>December 13.&mdash;Sunday.&mdash;Mr. Turnbull and Wommai were
again despatched for the cattle, &amp;c., with instructions to
follow on the tracks left yesterday.</p>
<p>The weather being oppressively hot, Mr. Mann and myself
entered the creek for the purpose of bathing, but our aquatic
gambols were of very short continuance, as we observed many
snakes in the vicinity. Their heads were the only parts at first
observable, and we imagined they were nothing more than small
aquatic insects, until one landed on the opposite bank, when his
whole length was displayed, and we were no longer in doubt as to
their character. We lost no time in getting ashore, and gave the
reptiles absolute possession of the creek. The mosquitoes were
very numerous, and we were not long in finishing our
toilette.</p>
<p>Took a stroll along the bank of the creek, when I found its
course to be from E.N.E. to W.S.W.; it abounded in the small
tortoise. I found the following plants: <i>Zornia</i>, a small
trailing species with orange-coloured blossoms, and rough
articulated seed-pods. Two species of <i>Solanum</i> or Kangaroo
apple. <i>Stenochilus</i>, two species: the one a dwarf shrub,
the other growing to the size of a small tree. One very
odoriferous Cassia: three species of <i>Grewia</i>, These plants
have leaves exactly resembling the filbert nut trees; their fruit
is a three-celled capsule, the flavour being that of the raisin
of commerce. This agreeable taste is only extracted, however, by
means of pounding or crushing the fruit between the teeth or
otherwise. We afterwards, when in the tropics, were in the habit
of collecting, crushing between stones, and afterwards boiling
this fruit in water, which yielded a very pleasant and agreeable
beverage, not to be despised by those who, like ourselves, were
not in a position to become even as abstemious as teetotallers;
as a very short time after leaving civilisation sugar was a
forbidden article to all but the leader; of tea, however, we had
plenty, but without sugar even that was not much appreciated.
Speaking for myself, I, in the absence of sugar, preferred the
pure element, cold water. In the evening Turnbull and Wommai
returned with some of the mules and horses. Meteoric appearances
or falling stars were very frequent this night to the northward
and westward. Lightning very vivid was also seen from the
westward. Thermometer at noon, 98; half-past three p.m., 110. I
here commenced a practice which I afterwards followed at every
convenient opportunity where the soil and situation was suitable,
of sowing seeds of the most useful fruit and vegetables. The
snakes here were both numerous and large; they were also bold and
fearless in proportion to their size. Mr. Turnbull and Wommai
were attacked to-day while following the track of the cattle
through a thick Brigalowe scrub, by one of these monsters of the
brown kind!</p>
<p>December 14.&mdash;In the course of the night some of the
horses and mules again escaped, and Wommai was sent in search of
them; he returned about noon, having found those for which he was
looking as well as some that had strayed previously. Dr.
Leichhardt, Mr. Turnbull and Mr. Bucking, went also to look for
the mules. About four p.m. Mr. Hely and Brown returned with all
the cattle, they had tracked them through a dense Brigalowe scrub
to Mr. Gogg's station. At seven p.m. the doctor and his
companions returned after a fruitless search. I collected seeds
of a new <i>Glycine</i>, saw also another scarlet flowering
species of the same genera, seeds not ripe. Along the banks of
the creek I found a new species of bean, with long round
dagger-like pods, and the blossoms large and richly scented, with
many species of grasses, which I believe have not as yet been
described; very common among the other plants was the little
Australian Sensitive Mimosa (<i>Acacia terminalis</i>); this
plant possesses contractility and the power of mimicking animal
sensibility in as great a degree as the sensitive plant
(<i>Mimosa pudica</i>) of South America. I also collected seeds
of a very handsome <i>Swainsonia</i>. The natives here collected
and eat the bulbous root of a pretty species of <i>Atrodium</i>.
The day until four p.m. was cloudy, and the glass stood at
81.</p>
<p>December 15.&mdash;The only stock missing at this time were
eleven horses and mules, to obtain, which Mr. Hely and Wommai
were despatched in one, and Mr. Turnbull and Brown. in another
direction. The two former returned at four p.m. after an
unsuccessful search. Took another stroll down the creek to
relieve the monotony of our long sojourn at this camp, and found
a species of <i>Jasminum</i>, with blossoms white, waxy, and very
sweet, and an interesting plant belonging to the <i>Hedysareæ</i>
of Jussieu. Dr. Leichhardt had also taken a stroll up the creek
and returned with specimens of the very remarkable pendulent and
arborescent Hakea Lowria, and native daffodil or
<i>Callostemma</i>, a bulbous plant belonging to the
<i>Amaryllideæ</i>, Charlie's Greek joins the Condamine river
about nine miles from our camp. At six p.m. two messengers
arrived on horseback with a letter to the doctor, intimating the
return of Sir Thomas Mitchell, and as an inspection of Sir
Thomas's despatches were likely to form an important feature in
our expedition, Dr. L. made arrangements for returning to Darling
Downs on the morrow for that purpose. Thermometer four p.m., 98
in the shade.</p>
<p>December 16.&mdash;The doctor sent Mr. Hely to Darling Downs,
instead of performing that journey himself. Mr. Turnbull and
Brown returned after a useless search. After dinner the doctor
and two native black fellows went in search of the missing stock;
his two companions never having been on a horse before, mounted
with caution. They returned with four; Wommai shot some ducks.
Several birds of the Ibis kind, having beautifully
bronze-coloured plumage, made their appearance. Weather very
close and hot. The saddler very busy altering the pack-saddles;
the party taking turn-about herding cattle. There was a great
quantity of a succulent species of <i>Portulacca</i>, growing at
this place on the banks of the creeks, which was boiled and eaten
as a vegetable.</p>
<p>December 17.&mdash;Having been tolerably successful yesterday
with his naked body guards, the doctor continued their
acquaintance and went again in quest of the horses, &amp;c., but
returned, having been less fortunate than on the former occasion;
he brought with him specimens of the <i>Capparis Mitchellii</i>,
having large fruit, with a long stalk, the size of an apple, and
leaves like the orange; the fruit was very pungent. Also a plant
with leaves and thorns like the <i>Bursaria</i>, but producing a
fruit as large as a plum. In the afternoon we were visited by a
heavy thunder-storm, which was very agreeable, as the weather
previously had been hot and sultry.</p>
<p>December 18.&mdash;Mr. Mann, myself, and Wommai went up the
creek to select a crossing-place, and found one at the distance
of three miles; found a very pretty species of <i>Symphetum</i>
and one <i>Cassia</i>. Our old friends, the blacks, whom we had
seen on first making the creek, returned, bringing with them
their gins, as well as my young friend who had so great a
<i>penchant</i> for tobacco. They made their camp close to ours,
much against the wish of Dr. Leichhardt. In the evening, much
thunder, lightning, and heavy rain, which continued until
midnight, when my watch commenced.</p>
<p>December 19.&mdash;This morning two of the black fellows had
breakfast with us, on the understanding that they were to
accompany Mr. Turnbull and Brown to look for the mules. I say on
the understanding, as far as we were concerned, but the fact was
that they themselves understood nothing more than that they were
getting a good feed. They went, however, and returned, having
found one mule and one horse. Preserved specimens of
<i>Phillanthus, Cassia, Fimbristylus, Justitia, Sida</i>, and
another smaller kind of bean with yellow blossoms. Thunder and
lightning again in the evening, accompanied with rain.
Thermometer, 6 a.m., 66; at 3 p.m., 90; sunset, 71. Wind from the
S.W.</p>
<p>December 20.&mdash;Sunday.&mdash;The doctor. Brown, and the
two black fellows again went in search of the mules. At one
o'clock they returned, the doctor suffering from diarrh&oelig;a.
I give a few more words of these natives (Charlie's Creek):
Bockara, boy; Condamine river, Yandukal; a' a' da, wood; Thonee,
woman; Thanthi, no good; Booathanth, stinking; Boging, dog;
Gothong, cloud; N'yan n'yan, pot; Pard'ng, grass; Koranga, reed;
Knownong, f&oelig;ces; Powang, opossum. Thermometer, sunrise, 66,
2 p.m., 88; half-past five p.m. 82, in the shade. The pumpkins
and some of the other seeds sown on the 13th made their
appearance above ground.</p>
<p>December 21.&mdash;Mr. Turnbull and Brown were again
despatched for the mules. Among the blacks who returned,
yesterday was one more intelligent than any we had as yet seen;
and he made his <i>debût</i> at our camp in the character of a
wandering minstrel, singing as he went, or rather as he
approached, for want of thought, the old English
ballad&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemw">He promised to buy me a bunch of blue
ribbons,<br>
He promised to buy me a bunch of blue ribbons,<br>
He promised to buy me a bunch of blue ribbons,<br>
To tie up my tiddelle lol de dol de dol de da.</p>
<p>The last, words appeared to be sung, or added, more from his
having forgotten, or never having known, the finish of the verse
in English, than as a chorus to the song. It was not until he had
sung it two or three times, that we became aware of the name of
the song, and we were even then more indebted to the air, which
he was very perfect in, than to the words. His sable friends
appeared to be much delighted at our enjoyment of Mr. Dennis'
song. The said Mr. D. proved to have a very perfect knowledge of
the geography of his own and the adjoining country. He drew a
rough sketch on the sand, showing the number and bearings of the
different water-courses for a distance, as we afterwards
discovered, of 150 miles. He represented the Condamine river as
being joined a long way lower down by many more creeks, when it
at times formed a vast body of water. This we afterwards, on our
Fitzroy Downs' expedition, found to be the case, as the river is
then called the Balonne, which, in the season of floods, leaves
the surrounding country inundated for many miles; we saw
watermarks on the large trees, six feet at least above the
ground, at a considerable distance from, the river. Thermometer
at sunrise, 65; noon, 85; sunset, 72.</p>
<p>December 22.&mdash;The creek had risen much within the last
twenty-four hours. Our friend, the musical Dennis, took his
departure. I gave him an old penny-piece, on which I had
engraved, as neatly as I could, his name. This would appear to be
the first piece of British currency he had ever handled, and he
was apparently pleased with the Queen's head. Being in a state of
nudity, and innocent of pockets, I put it in a small bag for him,
after which he departed. Before going, however, he expressed a
strong desire that we should follow the course of the Condamine,
as far as we could judge by his signs, until we had made one of
the water-courses which he had marked in the sands, and which we
afterwards discovered to be Bottle Tree Creek. He appeared to
signify that, by going in a north or north-easterly course, we
should fall in with much <i>Brigalow</i> scrub, and many wild
black fellows. I took rather a long stroll to-day over the red,
sandy, puffy plains, and obtained specimens of three fresh
<i>Leguminous</i> plants, a (to me) new species of
<i>Stackhousia</i>, and a yellow, flowering <i>Senecio</i>. The
goats' flesh appeared not to agree with any of the party
excepting the doctor and myself, causing a laxity in the bowels.
Nothing more having been heard of the stray mules, the doctor
began to despair of finding them; and, in the event of their not
being forthcoming before Mr. Hely's return with Sir Thomas
Mitchell's despatches, he determined on using a large portion of
the flour and sugar as fast as possible, leaving the more
necessary kind of stores to be carried by the mules at present at
the camp.</p>
<p>From the heat of the weather and the large number of flies,
great part of our mutton was generally spoiled before it was
eaten, although we tried both smoking it by the fire, and burying
it underground. Thermometer, sunrise, 65; noon, 89; sunset,
80.</p>
<p>December 23.&mdash;In addition to the common flies, we were
this day much annoyed by the small sand-flies, whose bite was as
sharp as the mosquito's. Thermometer, sunrise, 60; noon, 88.</p>
<p>December 24.&mdash;The doctor and Mr. Mann rode to Kent's
lagoon, and in travelling through a Brigalowe scrub he found and
brought me a rare specimen of <i>Hibiscus</i>, They also found a
duck's nest containing nine eggs, a rather singular number, being
exactly one for each of the party. They were reserved for
to-morrow, which being Christmas day, we were promised a tapioca
pudding. In the evening Mr. Perry, the saddler, who was out
herding the cattle, did not reach the camp at dark, and fearing
that he had lost himself, or that some accident had befallen him,
the doctor and Wommai went in search, the leader taking a horn
with him which he blew with all his might, and Wommai firing a
gun continually. At the distance of a mile from the camp, they
heard him cooeying, in answer to the horn and gun. He was driving
the cattle up instead of down the creek, having, as we had
anticipated, lost his way. The party were in high spirits, which
was evidently pleasing to the doctor's feelings. Thermometer at
daybreak, 60; noon, 82; sundown, 79.</p>
<p>December 25.&mdash;Christmas day, and a smoking hot one;
tapioca pudding, each man having as much as he could eat, and had
no occasion, like Oliver Twist, to ask for more. Thermometer at
daybreak, 69; noon, 89; four p.m., 86.</p>
<p>December 26.&mdash;Early this morning two more black fellows
paid us a visit. They were quite strangers, and to judge from
their having no knowledge of a single word of English, and their
timid manner of approaching our camp, had evidently seen but
little, possibly nothing of white people before; they were
ushered into our presence by those already camping near us. As
far as we could make out by their signs they had seen two of our
missing mules, as they mimicked the actions of these animals in
hobbles, and held up two fingers, evidently meaning that as being
the number they had seen.</p>
<p>The doctor had gone this morning with Wommai to have another
search for the mules, and returned at noon, having found some of
them in a small richly pastured opening, surrounded by Brigalowe
scrub. He had taken with him the bugle, from which he blew a long
and loud blast to announce his successful return. Some of us went
to meet him, and we were followed by the whole of the black
fellows; on our giving the leader three cheers, they joined to a
man, and the noise was almost deafening. Thermometer, two a.m.,
66; noon, 92; five p.m., 88.</p>
<p>December 27.&mdash;Sunday. This morning the doctor and Wommai
went with the two wild natives to look for the mules, which we
supposed by their signs they had seen when on their way to our
camp. They returned, however, at noon, after a long and useless
ride. It was evident that they had either misled ns with the
belief of having seen the mules, with the view of obtaining some
damper and meat, or we had altogether misunderstood them: the one
conjecture was just as probable as the other. Their ride,
however, was not altogether without its use, as the doctor found
and brought me some very fine specimens of the <i>Logania</i>,
growing to the size of a small tree, with semi-pinnatified
foliage. Our dog Spring caught a fine brush Kangaroo.
Thermometer, sunrise, 64; noon, 89. It is to be understood that
the glass was always kept in the shade.</p>
<p>December 28.&mdash;The doctor despatched the two wild black
fellows with a letter stuck in a cleft stick, to be taken or
forwarded by them to Mr. Dennis or Mr. Bell, at Jimba, the object
of the letter being to request either of those gentlemen to
engage one of their civilised natives to interpret for those who
delivered the letter, with the view of learning something
respecting our missing stock, as we had altogether failed in
making ourselves understood. Another diseased goat was killed,
the flesh of which had the effect of giving the whole of our
party a violent attack of vomiting and dysentery. In addition to
which, they suffered much (myself excepted) from ophthalmia,
occasioned by the flies perpetually settling around their eyes,
where they so firmly attached themselves as to be readily killed,
a dozen at one time. After crushing these insects, a most
unpleasant and f&oelig;tid smell remained on the hand. So
numerous were they, that it was utterly impossible to keep the
eyes more than half open. A solution of nitrate of silver was
used as a dressing for the eyes affected. Thermometer, noon, 92;
4 p.m., 93; sunset, 82½.</p>
<p>December 29.&mdash;The doctor and Wommai returned to the camp
at noon, from an excursion undertaken with the view of
ascertaining if it was possible, on leaving this camp, to travel
in a direct course without the intervention of <i>Brigalowe</i>
scrub. The weather being oppressively hot, we erected a kind of
arcade, covered with boughs, which served in some measure to
protect us from the heat of the sun. Wommai shot two ducks, which
we had for tea, and found them a most desirable improvement upon
the diseased goat's flesh. Saw, for the first time, some
whistling ducks, which were common here; they were smaller than
the common black duck, and their plumage resembled the sparrow
hawk. Thermometer at sunrise, 64; noon, 85; 6 p.m., 90; sundown,
83. Collected, from curiosity, to-day, upwards of thirty distinct
kinds of grasses, highly nutritious, and eaten greedily by our
cattle within a circuit of three miles of our camp. On mentioning
this fact in a letter written and addressed to the <i>Argus</i>,
sent with the two black fellows in a cleft stick with the
doctor's, I afterwards, on my return, read in one of the Adelaide
papers, where it had been copied, the number of distinct grasses
being, by mistake, stated as 250.</p>
<p>December 30.&mdash;As none of the missing mules, after the
most diligent search and inquiry, were forthcoming, and as many
of the others had sore backs, the doctor, with the view of
lightening the loads, and moreover being determined to travel
with those we at present possessed, he determined on eating 150
lbs. of flour as speedily as possible; and when it is considered
that, since leaving the settled districts, we had been restricted
to the ninth part of a two-pound damper daily, it was no wonder
that we were somewhat elated at the prospect of having this
addition to our daily quantity of bread, although we were fully
aware that our rejoicing was premature, and we should feel its
effects ultimately. What with the flies, bad eyes, musquitos, and
our inactive position, the party were waiting anxiously for Mr.
Hely to return with the despatches, when we should be enabled to
make a fresh start, and progress on our long and mysterious
journey. Thermometer, sunrise, 60; noon, 89; sundown, 82.</p>
<p>December 31.&mdash;This day a fine fat sheep was killed as a
change to the goat's flesh, which appeared to disagree with the
party, and in consequence of new year's day, to-morrow, when, in
addition to the mutton, we were promised by the leader a suet
pudding, with the additional indulgence of sugar. Thermometer,
sunrise, 60; noon, 89; sundown, 83.</p>
<p>January, 1, 1847.&mdash;New year's day, and like Christmas, it
was a smoker. For dinner we had our promised suet and sugar
pudding. After dinner, I took a walk with Wommai, crossed the
creek, and went towards Kent's Lagoon to look for plants and
duck's eggs; found a few of the former, but none of the latter.
Thermometer, sunrise, 64; nine a.m., 89; noon, 98; sunset,
80.</p>
<p>January 2.&mdash;A number of black fellows again paid us a
visit, and among them our old, intelligent, and musical friend,
Mr. Dennis. They reported the safe delivery of the letter sent by
the two wild fellows to Mr. Dennis and Mr. Bell, as well as that
we might speedily expect the return of Mr. Turnbull and Brown,
and another white fellow (Mr. Hely), who were, they said,
bringing plenty more sheep and the missing mules. We soon
discovered that they were in error in regard to the sheep and
mules, as in the afternoon Mr. Turnbull and Brown returned
without bringing any sheep, and had heard nothing of the mules.
He also said that a report was current on the Downs that we had
been rushed by the blacks, and one of the party killed. Had for
dinner, by way of change, a dish of skillagalee, instead of
bread. Mr. Mann shot two enormous guanas, measuring each five
feet. They were given to our sable friends and visitors, our time
for indulging in these luxuries not having yet arrived.
Thermometer, midnight, 70; sunrise, 64; 10 a.m., in the sun, 90;
from noon till half-past 4 p.m., 93 in the shade.</p>
<p>January 3 Sunday.&mdash;Our camp this day was one continued
scene of mirth and activity, quite a change to our long,
monotonous style of living, occasioned by the arrival of a great
number of blacks of both sexes and all ages, from the child in
its mother's arms, to men at least six feet in height, and stout
in proportion. Among them were, without exception, some of the
finest men I had ever seen as aborigines of this colony. As the
men were large in comparison to other tribes, so were the women
as proportionably small. To add to their decrepid and' miserable
appearance, they had adopted the singular fashion of not allowing
a single hair to grow on any part of their bodies. Over their
heads they frequently run a fire-stick, to burn the hair the
moment it appeared. Under the armpits, &amp;c., I have seen a man
engaged in pulling it. Occasionally he takes between his fingers
more than one at a time, which gives / pain to the patient, and
causes her to express as much by saying, in a plaintive tone,
"Yucca! yucca! eeburra!" All the Australian natives, as far as I
have observed, have some singular and superstitious customs in
regard to the hair.</p>
<p>In my late expedition to Adelaide, my black fellow. Jemmy,
preserved every single hair until his return to Melbourne, where
he intended burying it in some particular locality. Indeed, it is
this very remarkable custom which leads them into the still more
erroneous belief that none of their people die a natural death.
No sooner is one of their number taken ill, than he appeals to
the Kooloolook, doctor or conjuror, who tells him that a black
fellow of a neighboring tribe has visited the camp of the
invalid, and stolen some of his or her hair. If, after this, the
patient dies, the thief is said to have burnt the hair he had
formerly stolen, and was the cause of death.</p>
<p>Among them was a very young woman, who had several white spots
on her skin, from which circumstance she was called by our party
the Piebald. This was a problem in physiology by no means
difficult to solve, it being nothing more than an absence of the
usual quantity of pigment, or coloring matter; when this humor is
wanting in a white person, the spots are black, or what are
usually called moles. The whole of these people were on their way
to the Bunya Bunya country, for the purpose of obtaining that
very remarkable fruit, the product of the <i>Araucaria
Bidwellii</i>. Perhaps I shall be better understood by
representing it as a species of the Norfolk Pine, <i>Araucaria
excelsa</i>. The present species is, however, much larger than
the latter kind, with large, feather-like branches; altogether,
perhaps a more magnificent tree it is difficult to conceive.</p>
<p>The fruit is as large as a common-sized cocoanut, and, then
roasted, the taste is equal, if not superior, to a mealy potato.
It is only produced in large quantities every third year, when
the various tribes meet for many miles round to collect and eat
it. It is also said, although I am not in a position to vouch for
its truth, that the eating of this fruit gives them a strong
relish for human flesh, and that many people are killed, for the
purpose of appeasing their unnatural and degraded appetites.</p>
<p>The <i>Bunya bunya</i> tree is confined to a narrow belt of
elevated country on the. coast range, averaging from twelve and a
half miles wide by twenty-five in length, and in no other part of
Australia has this plant been found. Thermometer, 2 a.m., 65;
noon, 93; 5 p.m., 88.</p>
<p>January 4.&mdash;Having. found all our mules, the doctor
determined not to wait longer, for Sir Thomas Mitchell's
despatches; and, for this purpose, he sent Mr. Turnbull and Brown
for Mr. Hely, with instructions to the latter gentleman to return
to the party immediately. I believe the doctor to have been led
to adopt this measure from the fact of another and a larger body
of black fellows having arrived, all being on their way for the
<i>Bunya</i> fruit. The number of these people at our camp at
this time could not have been less than two or three hundred.
Their presence gave us considerable trouble in. the management of
our cattle, as they could not abide their close neighborhood.
Thermometer, noon, 92; 6 p.m., 88.</p>
<p>January 5.&mdash;By eleven o'clock this morning we had all the
mules loaded, and everything prepared for a fresh start. At
half-past eleven, we took leave of our sable friends, who
appeared, as far as we could judge by their looks, to be somewhat
astonished at our taking a course still further from civilised
life. Our journey was pretty generally over low, puffy, boggy
flats, intersected by small patches of rising ground, very
scrubby, principally Cypress pine trees (<i>Callaetris</i>),
having an undergrowth of <i>Dodonea Ozothamnus Logania,
Prostanthera</i>, and another very handsome pyramidal-growing
tree, which we called white <i>Vitex</i>, The leaves were of a
lively green, and, when rubbed, emitted a strong bitter smell. We
camped in the evening on a small creek, a tributary of what the
blacks called Koim, Baby Creek; the bed was rotten-stone and
pipe-clay. Saw many tracks of emus and kangaroos in the bed of
the creek, where they had gone for water.</p>
<p>January 6.&mdash;Left the camp at 10 a.m., and travelled a
N.W. and W. course. The country a loose, rotten sandstone, and
very puffy. A new species of Eucalyptus made its appearance,
having foliage, very large and bright green,&mdash;a great relief
to the landscape, contrasted with the dark, sombre, and
melancholy-looking cypress pines. About six miles after leaving,
we again came to a bend of the creek we had left, and which
proved to be a tributary of Charlie's Creek, or the northern
branch of Koimbaboy. Camped at 4 p.m., on a fine chain of
waterholes, called by the Doctor Thermometer Creek, Mr. Roper
having broken one of these instruments at this place on his first
expedition. Thermometer, on camping, 109 in the shade.</p>
<p>January 7.&mdash;Made an early start this morning, at
half-past eight; our course being N.W. by N. Passed some
finely-grassed country, crossed Acacia Creek twice, and, at two
p.m., camped on the banks of Dogwood Creek, about two miles
higher up than Dr. Leichhardt's old camping-place, where the soil
was light and puffy, in latitude 36 deg., 24 min., 32 sec. Found
in the red loose soil an interesting species of <i>Crassula</i>,
with blossoms blue, large, and showy. The banks of this creek
were in many places lined with plants of the native Dogwood
(<i>Jacksonia</i>); hence its name.</p>
<p>January 8.&mdash;Our course this day was N. by W. The country
was indifferent, but well watered. We crossed two creeks, running
to the eastward, and camped at three p.m., on a third. The party
were busy drying mutton in the sun. I collected seeds of two
species of <i>Swainsonia, Ashonemonie, Cassia</i>, and an
<i>Amaranthaceous</i> plant. Mr. Buckin expressed a slight
disinclination to the performance of a part of his duties as
cook, but was immediately silenced by the doctor, whose motto,
like that of the great and immortal Nelson, was: Leichhardt
insists that every man shall do his duty.</p>
<p>January 9.&mdash;We remained at the camp all day, for the
purpose of drying the meat. The doctor took Wommai with him on a
reconnoitering trip. He fell in with the tracks of Mr. Pemberton
Hodgson's party. The weather was oppressively hot, and the flies
troublesome. In the evening, Wommai caught some fish very like
the English perch. Along the banks of the creek was another and
remarkable kind of gum tree, having leaves large and laurel-like,
with long, oval <i>Kalyptra</i>. The stem was a deep brown, and
the bark fell off in small scales, which, laying in large masses
at the roots, had, at first sight, a very singular effect.
Latitude, 26 deg. 16 min.</p>
<p>January 10.&mdash;Sunday.&mdash;Course, north; 29 deg. west.
Country very fine, interesected in every direction by waterholes,
deep and plentiful, all running into Dogwood Creek. We camped at
half-past four, p.m. On the banks of the creek were some fine
specimens of the <i>Mallaleuca</i>, or tea tree.</p>
<p>January 11.&mdash;Here we remained until the return of Mr.
Hely, Mr. Turnbull,;and Brown. Weather very hot; saw many wood
ducks. Latitude, 26 deg. 11 min. 12 sec.; longitude, 151 deg. 30
min. Here we saw two new species of gum; the one. having the
singular property of ejecting the bark from the stems in small
shell-like pieces, which lie in large heaps at the butts of the
trees, giving the stems of the trees the appearance of having
been stripped of the bark by the natives. The other kind was very
handsome: the flowers were large and abundant; the leaves were
glaucous and laurel-like; the stems scaly, but closely attached
to the trees. There were also, here and there, trees like the
quince, but smaller, producing a fruit like a small peach, but of
a bright orange color; the taste was very pungent, and would
appear to be a very great favorite (as, indeed, are all bitter
fruits) with the emus. For this reason we were in the habit
afterwards of calling it the emu peach.</p>
<p>January 13.&mdash;Mr. Turnbull, Hely, and Brown returned
without bringing letters or information of any kind respecting
Sir Thomas Mitchell's expedition. In the afternoon, some black
fellows approached our camp, bringing in their hands branches of
an integral-leaved wattle, or <i>Acacia</i>, as tokens of peace.
They did not, however, come nearer than one hundred yards or so.
I obtained the following words from them, by pointing to
different parts of my body and by signs:&mdash;Bobboyarra,
Dogwood Creek; mea, eyes; somborong, mouth; geenong, foot;
keering, arms; maang, hand; maong, hair; mea, nose; deang, teeth;
peenong, ears; ma-a, head; moo, stomach; bannanoobrim, breast. By
comparing these words with those I have formerly given, and which
I obtained from the natives of Charlie's Creek, it will be seen
how closely their language assimilates with that of the Melbourne
natives. I also obtained their names for the following species of
plants, which I had then in my hand:&mdash;Tharrum,
<i>Capparis</i>, or caper trees; N'yangan, <i>Cymbidium</i>. This
plant is an <i>Epiphite</i>, and common in the forks of the dead
or diseased gum trees. Its blossoms are a rich waxy peach white,
very sweet, and pendulant, succeeded by clusters of fleshy-like,
oblong, and octangular seed pods, which are collected and eaten
by the natives; N'yerroomburra, an <i>Asceplidaceous</i> plant,
which clings to the larger trees, and produces large bags of
cotton-like seed pods; <i>Parree</i> nettle, Coodjarra, swamp oak
(<i>Casuarina paludosa</i>), Meen meerijarra, <i>Erythrina</i>,
or fire tree, as it is sometimes called; N'gneera, a plant
belonging to the <i>Laurinea</i>. They represented that, by
making an incision into the stem of this tree, a violently
poisonous juice exuded, which was dangerous to be touched by the
tongue. Wommai said they meant "Cobbon, saucy fellow;" Bookoroo
cassytha, a parasite, and a very troublesome one. This plant very
much retarded our progress while travelling through the
<i>Dodonea</i> scrub. It produces a number of large, unwholesome,
viscid-looking berries. Booboira, another species of the
<i>Capparis</i>, with long, thorn-like tendrils clinging to the
neighboring trees. The fruit is large and edible. Booyilling, a
handsome shrub, belonging to the Corymboseæ. Geeinjee geeinjee, a
name common, or rather applied by them to all the parasitical
mosses and lichens.</p>
<p>January 14.&mdash;Made another, and, as we then thought, a
final start, steering N.N.E. course for the first part of the
day's stage, through tolerably good country, which, shortly
before our camping, however, changed to rather thick, but low
scrub, composed principally of white <i>vitex, Ozothamnus,
Dodonea, Metrosideros</i>, and occasional clumps of
<i>Mellaleuca</i>, or tea tree, in the highest, driest, and
poorest situations, which was something remarkable, as these
trees generally delight in wet, marshy places. Caught a very
large and beautifully-marked mantis, or animated straw, which was
crawling over Mr. Perry's shirt. Its length was, from head to
tail, ten inches. Our kangaroo dog. Swift, caught a fine
kangaroo, which was cooked and dressed for the dogs. At the
distance of a mile and a half from where we camped, we passed a
remarkably-formed conical hill, of sandstone formation, called by
the doctor, on his former expedition, Roper's Peak, in honor of
Mr. Roper, who was one of his persevering companions on that
occasion. We encamped at noon on a small creek near the grave of
a black fellow, for which reason it was called Dead Man's
Creek.</p>
<p>15th January.&mdash;Course to-day, west, 66 deg. north,
through the most magnificent volcanic and undulating plains-like
country, equal to Darling Downs. We camped at half-past two p.m.,
at the head of the River Dawson. Saw, for the first time, a fine
specimen of the Bottle tree, a Sterculiaceous plant, which, at
the suggestion of Sir Thomas Mitchell, has been determined as a
new genus, called <i>Dela Bechia</i>, in honor of a friend of Sir
Thomas of that name. This tree grows to the height of from forty
to sixty feet, and the stems have precisely the form of a
sodawater bottle. The blacks appear to be in the habit of cutting
through the bark, and eating the soft pulpy stem, which is almost
as soft as a turnip. With the bark itself they make nets and
twine. The Doctor got a kick in the stomach from Parramatta Jenny
(one of the mules). It commenced raining heavily yesterday
afternoon, shortly after camping, and did not clear up until
twelve o'clock this day. On the banks of the Dawson I collected
specimens of a (to me) new and spineless species of <i>Bursaria,
Commelina, Convolvulacæ</i>, another species of bean, mimosa with
very large pendulant and closely pinnatified leaves.
<i>Glycine</i>, and on the rich open plains, <i>Sida, Anthericum
or Bulbine</i>, with very large blossoms, <i>Ruellia, Phytolacco,
Cassia, Symphetum Phillanthus, Justitia</i>, and a very graceful
and abundant flowering <i>Sida</i>, five and six feet high.</p>
<p>16th January.&mdash;The same fine rich open country continues;
our course was west by north. Another kangaroo was killed. The
dogs gave chase to two large emus, but they took to the scrub,
which put an end to the chase.</p>
<p>17th January.&mdash;The country to-day rich confined plains,
and belts of <i>Brigalowe</i> and <i>Dodonea</i> scrubs
alternately. Our course was north-west. Found a very beautiful
species of <i>Pimelia</i>, with large globular-headed blossoms of
a deep crimson; saw also in the scrubs for the first time some
very beautiful trees of the <i>Bauhinia</i>; they were covered
with long leguminous pods of seeds, which, hanging among the dark
and somewhat sombre-colored twin-like leaves, had a pretty
effect. About two o'clock p.m., we camped on a tributary of the
Dawson, among a small forest of silver box saplings.</p>
<p>January 18.&mdash;Country nearly the same as yesterday; our
course was north. Two hours after leaving the camp, we came upon
a very large boggy flat, surrounded by silver box, <i>Brigalowe,
Dodonea, Bauhinia</i>, and white <i>Vitex</i> trees. About
half-past three p.m., we again made the river Dawson, and camped'
on its bank. ,The river had a great fresh in it, that augured
badly for our chance of crossing it lower down. Latitude, 25
deg., 54 min. Thunder again this afternoon, but no rain.</p>
<p>January 20.&mdash;Travelled through a fine open country
to-day; undulating plains, with trees in the distance. About noon
we ascended a slight elevation, from whence we obtained a view of
Lynd's and Gilbert's range in the distance, the former bearing
N.W., the latter N. by W. On this patch of elevated land, was a
group of seven of the remarkable looking bottle-trees, the
largest we had yet seen. Heavy thunder again in the afternoon.
The Doctor suggests as an improvement to our flour diet, that
instead of damper or Johnny cake, each person makes his three
ounces of flour into a dish of skillagalee, as being likely to go
farther, or, to use his own words, "it would be more satisfying."
After making each man his "mess of pottage", the great difficulty
was to eat it, without swallowing with every spoonful of skilly
about twenty flies; indeed, there was no alternative but to take
a fair share of each. These were not times for being fastidious,
and, after finishing, the parties could not fail to bear
testimony to the truth of the Doctor's words, that it was more
satisfying than the same quantity of damper or fat cake. For a
great part of the satisfaction I have no doubt we were indebted
to the number of flies we had compulsorily swallowed. The Doctor
complained of rheumatic pains and palpitation of the heart.
Collected a dish of <i>portulacca</i>, which was boiled and'
eaten, and acted on the whole of the party in the same manner as
a dish of jalap. We all suffered much from opthalmia, occasioned
by the flies. Thermometer, 8 p.m., 104 in the shade. The day's
course was north-west.</p>
<p>January 21.&mdash;This day the heat was excessive; the glass
at noon, 108. The flies were more numerous than on any former
occasion. The leader and Wommai walked down the bank of the river
to select a crossing-place. The banks were clothed with a belt of
silver box saplings, of from a quarter to half a mile in width. I
took a stroll up the river through this miniature forest, and
saw, in the most sheltered and shady parts, large heaps of
bivalve shells, the remains of aboriginal feasts. Many of these
shells were as large as the usual sized cheese plates. Saw, also,
hanging from the branch of a large tree, a string of some seven
or eight breast bones of emus. On my mentioning this fact to
Wommai, on my return to the camp, he expressed much pleasure on
hearing that I had not in any way disturbed them. He represented
them as having been placed there by the natives in strict
observance of some religious rite or ceremony; the same, or very
nearly the same custom being followed by his own tribe at Port
Stephens, of which place he was a native. In the evening, Wommai
and Brown, the other black fellow, absented themselves from the
camp; and, on going to the scrub, we found that Wommai was taking
another degree as a young man. The blood was trickling rapidly
from his breast. Brown having inflicted thereon, with a sharp
knife, some sixty or seventy wounds. On healing up, these
incisions would leave as many swollen lumps or vesicles, which
are considered by them as adding greatly to the beauty of their
personal appearance.</p>
<p>January 22.&mdash;We travelled down the banks of the river for
the distance of five miles, when we came to a part where we
observed that a large tree had fallen across the entire width of
the stream. This was too favorable a chance to be thrown away,
and we lost no time in availing ourselves of such unlooked-for
means of getting our stores over dry. Here, it may be truly said,
that our expeditionising commenced in earnest. To carry over our
luggage with anything like safety, we found it was necessary to
do the work barefooted; and, as the bark and other inequalities
presented a surface very different to that of a Turkey carpet,
and, independent of the log, we had to walk some distance before
reaching our primitive bridge, and the same being the case after
crossing over, ours was no pleasant task in perspective.
Necessity, they say, has, no law, and as "needs must when the
d&mdash;&mdash;l drives,"we had no alternative but to set to with
a good will. The first task was for two of the party, to place on
the head of a third the load which it was his duty to carry over.
On reaching the log, it required a considerable share of nerve to
preserve the necessary balance during the critical journey
across, the river roaring like a torrent below. After getting
fairly under weigh, it was not a little amusing to see the
caution exhibited by each individual in trying to place his feet
on the smoothest part of the log; and was a forcible verification
of the adage, "walking circumspectly". After effecting the
transit of our baggage, the next job was to cross over the goats
and sheep, neither of which would face the log. Wommai at this
juncture offered himself as architect, and succeeded in making,
with saplings, boughs, and mould, a very ingenious substitute for
a jetty running gradually down to the river. By this means, many
of the animals took to the water, and we were progressing
<i>swimmingly</i>, when, unfortunately, poor Wommai's very
cleverly conceived affair gave way, and we had much difficulty in
crossing the remainder. "Perseveranda et prospera", says
Leichhardt, in the midst of his employment; and, by following the
precept conveyed in the proverb, we had everything finished by
dusk, as the cattle, mules, and horses gave us but little
trouble; the only deaths which it is my melancholy duty to record
on that occasion being five goats and two sheep. I am sorry to
say, however, that this day's work was the cause of the fever and
ague which, a few days afterwards, attacked, first, myself, and
subsequently the whole of the party. In consideration of our
exertions, we were rewarded at night by the doctor with the true
pastry of the bushman, a fat cake, to which was added an extra
pot of tea with sugar.</p>
<p>January 23.&mdash;Left the camp at ten a.m., and travelled a
north by east course, through a very indifferent and scrubby
country, until reaching Palm-tree Creek, where we arrived just in
time to catch the benefit of a heavy storm, before we had time to
erect our two miserable calico apologies for tents. This creek
was named from the <i>Corypha</i> palm-trees which adorned its
banks, and than which nothing could be more beautiful than their
tall, upright, nearly cylindrical stems, and wide-spreading
umbrageous palmate leaves. The .unexpended leaves found at the
heart of the tree were very pleasant eating; the taste being that
of the Spanish chestnut.</p>
<p>From the heat of the day, and difficulty in driving the sheep
and goats through the scrub, poor Norval, our sheep-dog, was
knocked up.</p>
<p>I tried my luck in the evening, after the rain had abated,
at fishing for eels; but was not favored with as much as a
nibble.</p>
<p>January 24.&mdash;The country improved to-day, but still
continued scrubby. Our course was W.N.W. We had Gilbert's Range
in sight the greater part of the day, bearing N.E. Encamped
within two miles of its base, on the head of Palm-tree Creek.
Latitude, 25 deg., 83 min., south. During the course of the day's
stage, as Wommai and I were following with the goats and sheep (I
may as well say that we were always some miles behind those of
the party with the mules and cattle) we passed a very large sheet
of water, hall lake, half lagoon, on the opposite side of which
we saw, as I imagined, a fine bay horse, but to make assurance
doubly sure, I dispatched Wommai to the spot. He shortly
afterwards returned; he had not seen the horse, but said there
was a large quantity of horse-dung and tracks of hoofs.; he
brought a portion of the dung with him.</p>
<p>This being Sunday, it was again suggested to the Doctor that
he, as leader, should read the service of the Church of England.
To this request he replied that it was better for each individual
to do his share of that solemn and very necessary duty.</p>
<p>January 25.&mdash;We made a long stage of fifteen miles. The
greater part of the distance the country was low, flat, and
swampy, very rich diluvium, covered with a rank growth of
<i>polygonum</i>, sedges, rushes, and such like rank-growing,
semi-aquatic plants. As though we had not experienced sufficient
misery from the sandflies, common flies, and musquitoes, we had
now to commence war with a more determined enemy than any which
had as yet beset us, in the shape of hornets of a large size, and
whose bite or sting was more painful for a time than that of a
snake, and left an immense swelling that took two or three days
to allay. These hornets were as treacherous as their sting was
violent. They build their nest in the hollows of trees, and
generally just such a height from the ground as left the head of
a man on horseback on a level with their domicile, thus bringing
literally a hornet's nest about his ears. Several of the party,
as well the horses, were this day stung. The horses and mules had
no sooner felt the violence of the sting than they commenced
bucking, and one or two of their riders were unseated. Even my
old Number 8 tried this game, which somewhat surprised me, as,
judging from his generally quiet demeanour, I did not suppose, as
Mr. Hely remarked, he had a kick in him. Our course was west and
south-west.</p>
<p>January 26.&mdash;This morning we had to commence the ascent
of the ranges of the Robinson, which were, in many parts, steep
and precipitous; and, to avoid the chasms in the rocks, we were
under the necessity of tracing them up to their commencement.
This style of travelling, combined with the extreme heat of the
sun, rendered our day's stage a long and tedious one. In one of
these broken, rocky bites of land, we saw a clump of very large
bottle trees. They had all been stripped, in many parts, of the
bark, and a large quantity of the stem itself taken by the
natives, very probably for food&mdash;indeed, many of our party
were in the habit of eating the wood of this tree, which had very
much the taste of a turnip. This remarkable tree belongs to the
natural order of Jussien <i>Stirculeaceæ</i>, and has been
determined as a new genera <i>De Labechia</i>, in honor of a
friend of Sir Thomas Mitchell's of that name. Sir Thomas was the
first to introduce a specimen of the plant to England; and I
believe I may take the credit of having sent the first seeds,
which I found at a camp from whence the wild blacks bolted on our
appearance. We only obtained, on that occasion, twelve seeds. In
the course of the day's stage, while passing through a small
patch of scrub, I saw and obtained seeds of a magnificent crimson
flowering species of <i>Passiflora</i>, the seed pods were as
large as pigeons' eggs and the flavor good; but as the quantity
obtained was limited, they were too valuable to be used as an
article of food. We camped in the afternoon on the bank of a
small but well-watered creek, a tributary of the Robinson. We
pitched our camp near a beautiful grove, composed of
sweetly-scented <i>Myrtaceous</i> plants, and a species of
<i>Tristanea</i>; many of the latter were as tall as the usual
sized silver-leaf box gum. Clinging to these trees was a species
of <i>Clematis</i>, or Virginian bower, having foliage different
from any I had previously seen. They were not in blossom. We soon
discovered that our camping ground was infested with ants of two
or three kinds, whose bite was very violent, and kept the party
on the move the whole night. Owing to the broken and mountainous
character of the country, this day our course was much broken and
indirect.</p>
<p>January 27.&mdash;It was no very gratifying sight to look at
the apparently inaccessible chain of mountains, one tier peeping
over another, laying directly in our line of route, and which we
knew we must in consequence, pass over. We made an attempt, and
left our camp at 10 a.m.; and by dint of dodging round the large
boulders, and following up or down the fissures, or ravines, we
eventually succeeded in reaching the summit of the highest part
of the group. Here we had a fine view of the peaks of Expedition
Bange in the distance. This was a broken chain of mountains, over
which we should also have to march. On the top of the ranges
passed over to-day, saw some fine trees of <i>Fusanus</i>, and a
new arborescent species of <i>Hakea</i>, having leaves large and
serrated at the edges, like the native honeysuckle (<i>Banksia
Australis</i>), Shortly after descending the ranges, the country
opened into fine rich flats, of no great extent, however,
intersected by water-courses, but many of them dried up. The
trees were&mdash;the rusty gum, <i>Tristanea, Sterculea
(Corrijong</i>), and emu peach. The greater part of the forenoon
was showery, which made it bad travelling by the side of the
gulleys, so common on the ranges. We camped late in the afternoon
again on the river Robinson, where it assumes a very singular
character, being of extreme breadth, with a deep bed of white
sand, through which ran a chain of water-holes. Saw among the
grass on the flats a great many different kinds of Mantis, with
some large and gorgeously-marked butterflies. We followed, as
nearly as the nature of the country would allow, on the westerly
course. Latitude of our camp, 25 deg. 25 min.; elevation, 1,028
feet. I omitted to state the elevation of the head of the river
Dawson, which was 1,461 feet.</p>
<p>January 28, 1850[sic].&mdash;One of the horses having met with
an accident by staking his leg, occasioned us to remain at the
camp the whole of the day. The weather was cloudy, and so far
pleasant, as compared to the heat of the last few days. The grass
and herbage were literally covered with innumerable varieties of
the <i>Mantis</i> and locusts, presenting a fine field for the
entomologist. Obtained a new species of <i>Aster</i>, The doctor
and Wommai reconnoitered for our next day's camping place, and
found a suitable one at the distance of ten miles. I sowed some
more vegetable seeds on the banks of the river.</p>
<p>January 29.&mdash;Made an early start, and travelled a N.W. by
N. course over rocky ridges, and loose sandy confined plains, on
which were some fine trees of <i>Metrosideros</i> and
<i>Xylomelon</i>, or, as it is generally called, native pear; the
large woody seed pods being as large, and very like that fruit.
Crossed a small creek twice, containing but little water, and
encamped upon a fine chain of water-holes, at the head of the
Robinson, among a group of the beautiful, palm-like aborescent
<i>Zamias</i>, many of them in full fruit. This fruit is
collected by the natives, soaked in water, pounded and roasted
after a fashion peculiar to themselves, and eaten. Wommai dressed
and eat some of it; but, I imagine from not properly
understanding the process of preparation, he was ill for some
days afterwards. Much of the soil passed over to-day was soft and
puffy, and the gulleys and intersections were of limestone
formation. On the puffy ground the dogwood (<i>Jacksonia</i>) and
Cypress pine (<i>Callaetris</i>) made its appearance again. The
wood of the <i>Jacksonia</i>, when burnt, gives out a
disagreeable, f&oelig;tid smell, from whence it has derived the
name of stink-wood.</p>
<p>January 30.&mdash;The early part of this day's stage was of a
breakneck description, which by noon brought us clear of the
ranges of the Robinson. We entered, after the descent, a
beautifully-confined valley, richly grassed, and where
water-holes were plentiful; on one of these we camped about two
p.m. Observing a remarkably broken-looking, rocky hill, or
boulder, at the distance of about a mile and a half from our
camp, Mr. Mann and myself wended our steps thither; he to take a
sketch of the country, and myself to look for plants. On
ascending this place, my companion had a delightful field for his
labors, as we had a full and uninterrupted survey of the
surrounding country in every direction. Mount Aldis and Mount
Nicholson were plainly to be discerned; and, on casting our eyes
in d north-westerly direction, we observed an unbroken chain of
apparently perpendicular rocks, forming a double wall, the one
peering over the other. Among the broken crevices in the rocks, I
found a pretty, shrubby species of <i>Phyllanthus</i>, with an
abundance of small, coral-like seeds, each about the size of a
pea, as also a large species of <i>Asclepius</i>, and a great
number of <i>Rutaceous</i> plants.</p>
<p>The weather being fine at the time of camping, we omitted to
rig up our tents: and as, in the night, we were visited by a
heavy storm of rain, we had the pleasure of being most completely
saturated. Our course was N.W. by N. Elevation, 1,648 feet.</p>
<p>January 31.&mdash;Sunday.&mdash;Shortly after leaving the
camp, we entered a narrow and picturesque rocky valley, which
gave us much trouble to descend, the large stones following close
upon our horses' heels in our progress. After travelling in this
manner for the distance of five miles, we entered upon closely
timbered country, which continued until meeting an apparently
inaccessible bank of rocks. Here it was deemed desirable to camp,
although it was early in the day, to enable the doctor,
accompanied by Wommai, to take a <i>reconnoisance</i>. From the
broken character of the country, our course was very indirect:
first, N.N.W., and subsequently N.E. by N.</p>
<p>February 1.&mdash;The first part of the day's stage was
through poor scrubby country, much interrupted by gulleys, many
of them containing water. After passing through one of these
gulleys, more than usually deep, we came upon the edge of an
immense precipice, extending further than the eye could reach. On
the opposite side of this was another wall, equally precipitous.
Between these gigantic enclosures was a deep and, as it would
seem, fertile valley; and through the centre ran a fine
water-course. These gigantic natural walls, or boundaries,
presented appearances the most fantastic; occasionally your
imagination would picture a large castle, which again changed to
some of the old abbeys and nunneries, common in England and on
the Continent. In fact, every style of architure, [sic] as you
continued to gaze, was presented, from the old abbey in ruins, to
the more modern cottage <i>ornée</i>. With much difficulty we
effected an entrance to the valley below. We travelled for some
distance along the edge of the creek we had formerly seen,
although we frequently met with interruptions, until three p.m.,
when we encamped on what the doctor named, from the romantic
scenery around, the <i>Creek of Ruined Castles</i>. On following
up a glen amid broken rocks, I found two new species of
<i>Acacia</i>, with pendulent, viscid, horse-tail like foliage,
three <i>Dodonea</i>, one <i>Notolea</i>, two <i>Hovea
Boronia</i>, and three of the <i>Grevillia</i>, one species very
handsome. Towards nightfall, it commenced raining heavily, and,
as the grass was long, made it unpleasant watching at night.</p>
<p>February 2.&mdash;Left the camp at half-past ten a.m., but
were not able to travel more than three miles, the horse with the
sore fetlock being knocked up. Just as we were unloading the
mules, we experienced a heavy thunder storm, which drenched us
all to the skin, and made it difficult to kindle a fire. As we
followed up the course of the creek, we found this remarkable
valley to open out on either 'side, the country still being
confined and walled in. The extent of the valley was sufficient
for four large cattle stations at least; and a few rods of
fencing would have secured the whole area, from which it would
have been difficult for the cattle to have strayed.</p>
<p>The timber was the emu peach, native pear, and silver-leaved
box gum. Mr. Hely was very unwell. Latitude, 26 deg. 11 sec;
elevation, 1,750.</p>
<p>February 3.&mdash;This morning was showery, and we remained at
the camp. Mr. Mann, Hely, and myself visited a rocky eminence,
and found another new species of prickly <i>Mimosa, Dodonea</i>,
and the rock <i>Mitrosacme</i>.</p>
<p>February 4.&mdash;The lame horse being unable to travel, we
made another start without him. We followed up this Ruined Castle
Creek to its source, among a series of elevated ranges, through
which we, with difficulty, succeeded in making our way. I found
the country interesting, botanically, and collected the following
plants, one remarkable shrub having a false
corolla:&mdash;<i>Pittosporum</i>, a new kind of vine, having
fruit like the black cluster grape, and pleasant eating: the
slightly pungent <i>Eustrephus</i>, the <i>Cassia</i>, and
several berry-bearing shrubs. On descending the ranges, we had to
avoid deep gulleys, containing water in many places. Camped at
four p.m. on a small, sheltered creek, with sandy and rocky bed.
Our course was, as nearly as it was possible to judge, N.W. by N.
The creek on which we camped was called Zamia Creek, there being
many of these plants on its banks. Elevation, 1,406.</p>
<p>February 5.&mdash;Continued following down Zamia Creek in a
northerly direction. Crossed and re-crossed several times in the
course of the day. The scenery was pretty, but in many parts very
scrubby. Collected a new Cassia and one <i>Acacia</i>, trees
<i>Bauhinia, Cyprus</i> pine, silver box, and three other species
of the <i>Eucalyptus</i>, The Zamia adorned the banks of the
river in many places. Thermometer at half past two p.m., in the
shade, 93. Mr. Hely suffered much from <i>toothache</i>, and had
his gums lanced previous to having one drawn. The operator was
Dr. Leichhardt, and the instrument a bullet-mould. I need not say
that, after a sharp jerk with this instrument, the tooth remained
as firmly in the mouth as ever, although the doctor happily, or,
as poor Hely thought, unhappily remarked, it broke or shook the
nerve, which of itself was likely to give him ease. Pitched our
tents at a small water hole, at 3 p.m., when Mr. Mann and myself
ascended a hill, from whence he took another sketch of the
country, including our camping grounds.</p>
<p>February 6.&mdash;We found this morning that one of our mules,
Don Pedro by name, and one who had crossed the Cordilleras, in
South America, on many occasions, had taken it into his head to
wander from the camp; and we consequently made a late start, and
continued following down Zamia Creek, whose many windings gave us
the same trouble in crossing and re-crossing as yesterday. After
travelling the distance of five miles, we again camped on its
banks; the weather was oppressively hot, and the flies
troublesome. We were, in the early part of the evening, visited
with another thunder storm.</p>
<p>February 7.&mdash;We made a long stage this day, following a
north north-easterly course; passed Mount Aldis on our left
hand&mdash;country scrubby in places.</p>
<p>February 8.&mdash;From the time of starting this morning until
camping in the afternoon, we were travelling through swamps.
Camped, at three p.m., on the banks of Erythrina Creek;. course,
N.E. by N.; elevation, 914.</p>
<p>February 9.&mdash;This day we commenced the ascent of
Expedition Range. The country broken, and in many places boggy.
Passed thorough much scrub and closely timbered country. Saw many
interesting plants. Our course was N.N.W. We encamped, about four
p.m., on the bank of a small creek, where there were many plants
of the dwarf <i>Zamia</i>, with a tolerable show of pine-apple
like fruit.</p>
<p>February 10.&mdash;Continued travelling over the same range,
and effected a clear descent by five in the evening, when we
encamped on a finely-watered creek, the banks on either side
being clothed with a great variety of shrubs. Saw, on the tops of
the range, a large variety of the <i>Acacias</i>, obtained three
(to me) new species, as well as two <i>Hoveas</i>, one
<i>Glycine</i>, two <i>Hakea</i>, three <i>Boronia</i>, two
<i>Eriostemon</i>, many new species of the genus <i>Acacia</i>,
two of which adorn the Botanical Gardens, Melbourne; among them
one with the stems compressed, after a very singular fashion,
very like the <i>Anceps</i> common near Sydney. Our course was
westerly.</p>
<p>The doctor named the pretty creek on which we had camped
Expedition Creek, from taking its rise on the ranges bearing that
name.</p>
<p>February 11.&mdash;Our course was W.N.W. In the course of the
day's stage, crossed no less than four creeks, all running
parallel with each other, and taking their sources from
Expedition Range. The intervening country was boggy in the
extreme, and the whole of the mules became fixed in the mud up to
the girths; and we were under the necessity of taking off their
loads to set them at liberty.</p>
<p>This morning I was scarcely able to mount my horse, having a
violent attack of fever, which, in a few days subsequently,
attacked the whole of the party, more or less. As the weather
looked bad, and indicated a wet night,, we rigged up our two thin
and almost useless calico tents. This was done in respect to my
illness; indeed, my fever increased, and, to add to the misery of
my situation, shortly after dark, it commenced raining in
torrents, which soon swamped us out of our tents.</p>
<p>In consideration of my sufferings, Mr. Hely, my companion
(allotted by Dr. Leichhardt), kindly undertook my share of
watching the cattle for the night.</p>
<p>February 12.&mdash;The rain continued the whole of the night,
and made the ground, which was naturally loose and puffy, in such
a muddy and boggy condition, as to render it quite impossible for
the mules, with their small feet and heavy loads, to travel; and
we were necessitated to remain at the camp the whole of the day.
Three or four of the party, in addition to myself, complained of
being unwell. Wommai, one of the black fellows, was positively
ill.</p>
<p>February 13.&mdash;We this day entered a dense
<i>Brigalowe</i> scrub, through the centre of which ran the Comet
River, so named by Dr. Leichhardt from the fact of the comet
having made its first appearance while he was travelling along
its banks on his former expedition, and from whence we did not
clearly emerge until after the lapse of many days. During the
whole time it was a continuance of wet weather, and travelling
was wretched; sometimes passing through a sheet of muddy water
for the distance of a quarter of a mile, into which we had
frequently to dismount to relieve the horses, who constantly got
bogged. Sometimes the back water would nearly surround our
camping ground, which was a place we had generally some
difficulty in selecting, a little above the level of the
inundated country around. On this mud we had every night to make
our couch, which was simply a few handfuls of boughs broken off
the <i>Brigalowe</i> trees. Our only covering for many
consecutive nights was the half of a wet blanket; and this, from
the frequency of showers, and the dank; unwholesome, confined
atmosphere of the <i>Brigalowe</i> scrub, we had not often an
opportunity of drying. Watching the stock at night, the greater
part of the time up to our knees in mud, was eventually
sufficient to lead to a general sickness. Such was the opinion
entertained at the time, and such was, in a few days, the result.
We followed, as nearly as the scrub would admit, a north-westerly
course; the only relief to the sombre <i>Brigalowe</i> scrub
being a few trees of the <i>Bauhinia</i> and silver-leaved box
gum.</p>
<p>February 14.&mdash;This was, perhaps, one of the best day's
specimens we had of expeditionising. The country, for the greater
part of the day's stage, was through muddy and boggy water-holes,
up to the horses' girths. They were so frequently bogged, that we
preferred walking the greater part of the morning. Course again
pretty nearly N.W.</p>
<p>February 16.&mdash;Still roaming through the scrub&mdash;the
ground a little more firm than formerly, and the travelling far
better. We had, however, one large sheet of water to travel
through, of at least half a mile in extent. It was very difficult
for me and Wommai to follow in the tracks of the party ahead,
through this scrub, we being generally a considerable distance
behind, with the sheep and goats&mdash;our only guide being the
ripples where the water had been disturbed. About noon this day,
I was nearly drowned in crossing a sheet of water, the horse,
poor old Number 8, having been bogged; and, owing to my late
suffering from fever and ague, I was unable, until assisted by
Wommai, who was in truth nearly as ill as myself, to extricate my
feet from the stirrup-irons. With much difficulty, however, we
managed to get clear of the water; but we were both so completely
exhausted that we were compelled to lie down, and the sheep and
goats were allowed to wander among the scrub at their leisure.
About five p.m., the doctor, on account of our not appearing at
the camp, became apprehensive that something had occurred, and
despatched Bucking, with the black fellow. Brown, as his guide,
to look for us; and they found us in the helpless condition
already mentioned. On reaching the camp (a bed of soft mud, over
which had been spread a few Brigalowe boughs). Dr. Leichhardt was
at last convinced that I was really and truly very ill; and
expressed some little sympathy, by having boiled for me and poor
Wommai a little gelatine soup. I only managed to swallow a few
spoonsfull. Small as the quantity was, it was the first food of
any kind I had eaten for several days. In the course of the
night, much and heavy rain fell, and I was lying half-covered
with water during the whole of the time; but of this fact I was
not aware until the following morning. As the crisis of my
disease took place during the night, I was unconscious of all and
everything around me. I was told that I was very kindly attended
by the doctor and Mr. Perry during the night. The doctor
afterwards remarked that I had forcibly verified the old proverb
of, "The ruling passion strong in death," as the only remark made
by me during the night was, "Mr. Perry, take care of my
specimens." Elevation, 1,048 feet.</p>
<p>February 17.&mdash;Shortly after leaving the camp this
morning, the country began to open a little, but still continued
scrubby. Saw a very fine species of <i>Datura</i>, or
<i>Stramomium</i>, with large white, trumpet like blossoms. The
doctor having made a long stage to-day, we continued travelling
with the sheep and goats, which were knocked up, until nearly
dark; and we were just on the eve of camping by ourselves as
Wommai sighted the smoke of the camp fire, when we pushed on to
the party, the doctor sending Turnbull and Brown to fetch the
sheep and goats. Course, W.N.W.</p>
<p>February 18.&mdash;Before the middle of the day We had the
pleasure of finding ourselves clear of the scrub, and travelled
over open flats of considerable extent; the soil being puffy, and
very wet, made it harassing travelling for the loaded mules. We
camped on what Dr. Leichhardt called Deception Creek, where the
sandflies and musquitoes were numerous and extremely troublesome.
Collected in the course of the day's stage specimens and seeds of
<i>Trichodesma, Lasiopetalon</i>&mdash;a new <i>Stenochilus</i>,
with beautifully-pendulant fuschia-like blossoms; and, among the
silver-leafed box gum trees which adorned the banks of the creek,
I found a handsome species of <i>Hibiscus</i>, with large,
rose-colored blossoms; with several <i>Leguminous</i> plants
having pink blossoms. Latitude, 24 deg. 27 min.; course,
W.N.W.</p>
<p>February 19.&mdash;From the scarcity of grass, and the labor
necessarily undergone in getting the stock through the
<i>Brigalowe</i> scrub for the last few days, the doctor
determined upon remaining a day at this place.</p>
<p>February 20.&mdash;We this day reached the Comet River, or, I
should rather say, we were, for the first time, enabled to
approach and camp on its banks, as the river, in fact, ran
through the scrub from whence we had just, with so much
difficulty, emerged, and where we had once or twice caught sight
of it. The musquitoes continued to be. troublesome at night, and
prevented the party from obtaining their usual allowance of
sleep.</p>
<p>February 21.&mdash;This day the sandflies were so excessively
troublesome as to render it necessary to ivrap our hands and
faces in our pocket-handkerchiefs; so annoying did they become,
about noon, as to cause the mules to buck and unship their loads.
Unfortunately I overtook the party at this juncture, and was, of
course, called upon to assist the others in the operation of
holding and reloading them. This work could not be done, however,
until a number of small fires were ignited, in the centre of
which the mules were led while being loaded, as the smoke arising
from the fires drove away the insects, and the mules were, of
course, quiet.</p>
<p>This work of loading was a severe trial to our tempers; and
even Mr. Perry, the most religious young man of the party, was,
on several occasions, in the act of swearing a few oaths, but
caught himself in the middle of each oath, and sought forgiveness
for his half-committed offence; thus clearing his way and his
conscience at the same time. We crossed and recrossed the Comet
River twice before camping. The country was scrubby until noon,
when we made some fine open plains; these were called Sandfly
Downs, in commemoration of the trouble we had experienced in that
locality from sandflies. Among the patches of scrub in the
vicinity of the river, we saw, for the first time for many days,
several black fellows gunyas. The timber on the plains was
principally box gum. Course, north-west and westerly.</p>
<p>February 22.&mdash;Brown returned late this forenoon, with
only a few of the horses and mules, the others having strayed;
and we were compelled to remain all day in the camp. Saw, on the
banks of the river, some fine trees, of the beautiful aborescent
<i>Cassia</i>; but, unfortunately, they were neither in blossom
nor in seed. Elevation, 920 feet.</p>
<p>February 23.&mdash;This was a day of accidents: two of the
mules were nearly drowned; what little sugar and flour we yet
possessed got saturated; and we lost our spade, as well as a
portfolio, containing a few of the most interesting insects which
had been collected on the expedition. Our course was
north-easterly, through scrub, along the bank of the river. On
arriving at the camp. Bucking and Brown were despatched for the
lost spade, with a promise of a reward of a two-pound flat cake,
if they were successful in their search. They returned in about
an hour and a half with the spade, and received their cake, which
they generously divided with their companions. Latitude, 24 deg.
10 min. south.</p>
<p>February 24.&mdash;Course N. by W., still following the course
of the Comet River, which continues to be scrubby, and of the
same character as yesterday.</p>
<p>February 25.&mdash;Course the same as yesterday, following the
course of the river. About noon we came suddenly upon a number of
blacks, who appeared to be much frightened, as they held up their
hands, screamed, and ran away as fast as their legs could carry
them. Found among the patches of scrub a very large and beautiful
shrubby species of <i>Abutylon</i> in full blossom, yellow, and,
when expanded, as large as a rose. Towards evening we were driven
by the scrub to the distance of two or three miles from the
river, where we camped on a large creek or backwater of the river
itself.</p>
<p>We had scarcely been camped two hours, when it commenced
raining in torrents, and continued pouring down the whole of the
night. The soil being black and tenacious, it clung to our boots
in large flakes or clods, and made it difficult in walking round
and watching the cattle during the night.</p>
<p>February 26.&mdash;It still continued raining; but from the
trampling of the cattle during the night, the place was so muddy
as to render it necessary to "up sticks!" and start for another,
and, as we hoped, a better and firmer camping ground. We
travelled for about three miles, when we came to a wide sheet of
water, where, as it continued to rain, we again encamped. We had
not remained long, however, before this place, like the one we
had left, from the trampling of the cattle, was soon a bed of
mud.</p>
<p>We were all completely soaked, and were for a long time trying
before we could succeed in lighting a fire to warm ourselves.
Fortunately, about noon, it began to clear up, end we were
enabled to dry our clothes and blankets. It kept tolerably fine
until midnight, which was the time for me and my companion, Mr.
Hely, to commence our watch, when it again came down thick and
fast, and continued in that manner for the remainder of the
night. We were still encamped in a scrub composed of
<i>Brigalowe, Dodonea</i>, and <i>Stenochilus</i>, with a few
scattered box trees. We heard some black fellows cooeing, in the
night, during our watch.</p>
<p>February 27.&mdash;We were again compelled to remain at the
camp, the continued rains during the night having rendered the
country too muddy for travelling. The dogs gave chase to a brush
kangaroo; but did not succeed in catching it.</p>
<p>February 28.&mdash;Sunday.&mdash;This morning I was early
astir with Wommai, having been disturbed by the repeated and
continual bleating of a young calf, proceeding apparently from
the confines of a thick patch of scrub at a little distance from
the camp. After a diligent search we found in the midst of the
aforesaid scrub a young calf which had been deserted by its
mother. We had not the slightest idea that our only cow was so
hear giving us an addition to our stock. It was, however, a
gratifying fact, as we were in hopes that we should from this
circumstance be furnished for some little time to come with a
supply of milk; but on this matter we were egregiously mistaken,
inasmuch as we could not succeed in erecting a bail sufficiently
strong to hold her during the operation of milking.</p>
<p>From the time lost in the attempt at milking the cow and in
fixing the calf on one of the mules, it being unable to travel,
we did not succeed in leaving the camp until near midday. We had
not travelled for more than a mile when the calf commenced crying
for its mother; this so alarmed the mule, on the back of which it
was placed, that it became frightened and commenced bucking; this
practice was followed by its companions, and in a short time we
had the trouble of catching and reloading the whole of them.</p>
<p>The doctor was determined that the mule should carry its live
burden, and this time he (it was a bull calf) fastened it under
the tarpaulin, a slit being cut, through which it could put out
its head and breathe. Another start was made, and we had
travelled this time for not more than three quarters of a mile
when the calf again commenced crying, and the mule to buck as
before; the same trouble in catching would have been necessary,
but after some persuasion the doctor agreed to camp at the place
as we happened to be, on the bank of the Comet River, which, from
the late rains, we found to be much flooded.</p>
<p>March 1.&mdash;This day we had heavy travelling through
patches of scrub, composed principally of <i>Brigalowe</i> and
<i>Dodonea</i>. Had also to cross many backwaters of the Comet
River. We travelled about eight miles, when we camped on the bank
of the river, which was evidently rising. On unpacking our traps,
we found that we had lost a small bag of sugar, one of tea, and
one of salt. Bucking and Brown were again despatched for them,
with a promise of being allowed to retain the sugar, and to which
the doctor was to add some tapioca for a pudding on our reaching
the Mackenzie River, if they were fortunate in their search. We
were in expectation of reaching this river the day after
to-morrow. Saw in the patches of scrub some fine trees of the
<i>Santalum</i> (bastard sandal wood), and a new leguminous
plant, from which I obtained both seeds and specimens.</p>
<p>March 2.&mdash;This morning we had to use all imaginary
despatch to load our mules, as the river was rising rapidly, and
the back current of water was surrounding our camping ground.
Some of our cattle were missing, and Brown was despatched for
them. Mr. Hely and Turnbull were ordered to remain until his
return to the camp. This day the doctor made a very long stage,
and Wommai and myself, with the goats and sheep, and the party
with the cattle, had much difficulty in making the camp; indeed
hut for the report of firearms, we should for the night have
formed three separate parties, although we knew by tracks in the
mud, and the repeated cooeing, that a number of wild blacks were
at no great distance. We travelled until late, owing to the
crooked course which the scrubs and backwaters rendered it
necessary for us to adopt, although we did not make more than
nine miles in distance, our average course being E. I did not
observe an inch of ground on the Comet River that could by any
possibility be turned to any account, although I think it
probable that plains of some extent may exist a few miles back.
Brown reported that while looking for the cattle he observed the
tracks of black fellows who had been following his and the course
of our tracks yesterday, and very probably they had found our bag
of sugar, &amp;c., as Brown and Bucking returned without them.
Mr. Perry was this evening taken suddenly ill. We camped on the
bank of the Comet. Latitude 23 deg. 41 min.</p>
<p>March 3.&mdash;Mr. Perry much worse, and we remained all day
in camp.</p>
<p>March 4.&mdash;To-day the whole of the horses could not be
found until late in the afternoon, when we made a start for a
place indicated by Brown as being clear of scrub, dry, and not
more than a mile distant. We travelled, however, a distance of
three miles, when we again camped on the banks of the Comet.</p>
<p>March 5.&mdash;We made the Mackenzie River at mid-day, and
camped on a fine patch of open country, but not far distant from
a thick patch of scrub. The river was much flooded, and there was
every prospect of our remaining for at least a fortnight. This
evening Mr. Turnbull was attacked with fever. The doctor also
complained. Mr. Perry much worse. Mr. Hely had the toothache. The
doctor recommended bathing.</p>
<p>March 6.&mdash;The weather being oppressively hot, and as the
invalids, more particularly Mr. Perry and Mr. Turnbull, continued
ill, we erected, with much labor, (owing to our weak state of
health,) a sort of arbour or bower, to shelter them from the sun.
The cow would not take the slightest notice of the young calf,
and to prevent its dying of starvation, Mr. Hely killed it. It
was afterwards cooked, and made into a kind of jelly. The doctor
commenced a new arrangement, and allowed us to have two meals a
day, and our three ounces of fat cake for luncheon;
unfortunately, many of the party were too ill to eat, and had but
little appetite, and consequently the worthy leader's very humane
system commenced, like many other good intentions in this world,
too late to benefit the greater part of his companions.</p>
<p>March 7.&mdash;Sunday.&mdash;This morning, the doctor, Mr.
Hely, and Brown, the black fellow, were added to the list of
invalids. The others worse, and myself again very unwell. We were
situated within four miles of the tropics, and the weather
consequently very hot. Latitude, 23 deg., 34 min. To add to the
misery of our situation, the musquitoes and sandflies were beyond
measure troublesome, and prevented the poor fellows who were
suffering from the fever getting anything in the shape of
wholesome slumber, which was so necessary to them under the
circumstances.</p>
<p>The duties of watching the cattle at night, and attending upon
the others, devolved upon myself and three others, two of whom
were barely able to crawl about. In the evening, Mr. Mann, who
had, up to this time, retained his health better than the others,
complained of feeling some symptoms of the fever.</p>
<p>March 8.&mdash;The doctor and the other invalids better.
Turnbull and Perry were, however, but a little better. The river
going down rapidly. I attributed our sickness, in a great
measure, to our so long travelling down the Comet River, which,
as the waters receded from the back waters, as the river
continued to fall, left a mass of vegetable matter, which,
becoming putrid, a very unpleasant effluvium arose, and may have
had some effect on the constitutions of the party who had already
suffered so much from the bad weather and wet blankets. In such
situations as the above, I observed always a greater number of
musquitoes and sandflies. The black fellows, however, attributed
it to our drinking the water in such places. Unfortunately, Dr.
Leichhardt, acting upon the fact of having escaped sickness in
his Port Essington tour, omitted to bring the necessary quantity
of medicines, and we were completely helpless. Some of the party
had fortunately brought a few papers of rhubarb, calomel,
&amp;c., which, with one small bottle of quinine supplied by the
doctor himself, was all the medicines we had. This omission led
to much grumbling on the part of the invalids. The only thing we
possessed, as being palatable to the poor fellows, was tapioca
and gelatine; but, as he would allow no sugar with the tapioca,
their stomachs were too weak to take it. Shortly after sundown,
the sky became overcast, and every appearance of a tropical
storm; nor were we deceived in its aspect, as it commenced
raining hard, accompanied by heavy thunder and very vivid flashes
of lightning. Our tents being useless, no attempt was
made&mdash;indeed, we had not strength or time to get the
necessary forks and poles for erecting them, and the sick had to
bear the storm with all its force. The doctor, in the evening,
gave us all a dose of calomel and scammony, which, he said, he
trusted would allay the effects of the fever.</p>
<p>March 9.&mdash;Mr. Mann, myself, and Wommai were the only
persons in the party who were able to crawl about. In the
morning, it was discovered that one of the goats had kidded
during the night; and we took advantage of the circumstance to
furnish the sick with a little milk. It was no trifling job, sick
and weak as we were, to catch the brute. Having succeeded, Wommai
managed to extract a quart of milk. To prevent a recurrence of
the party suffering from the effect of another thunder-storm, we
managed to erect the two tents, previously sewing up the parts
that were torn. The invalids' regimen now was gelatine, boiled
with a little tapioca, seasoned with pepper and salt. Mr.
Boecking was seized with a violent rash, which broke out all over
his body, occasioned, the doctor thought, from his drinkly too
freely of cold water. Mr. Mann and Wommai were the only sound
persons in the party. From the number of sandflies by day, and
musquitoes at night, the situation of the invalids was truly
pitiable. In the middle of the night, during my watch, I heard a
strange noise, very like the howling of a native dog, and, on
looking round, I was surprised to find Wommai by my side greatly
alarmed. He had been awoke by the same noise, which, he said, was
a kind of signal used among the natives when they were bent on
any mischievous undertaking. On walking in the direction of the
river from whence the noise proceeded, we distinctly heard them
talking in a low hut hurried manner. I went and informed the
doctor of this fact, who awoke Mann and Boecking, the others
being unable to keep their feet. We loaded our pieces, and made a
breastwork, or defence, with the pack-saddles and stores, behind
which we kept watch for some time; everything, however, continued
quiet, and morning appeared without bringing the threatened
danger. Probably the noise of ourselves and goats may have
alarmed them. Elevation, 787 feet.</p>
<p>March 10.&mdash;The greater part of the invalids were much
better this morning. The weather was overcast and cloudy, with
every appearance of rain. Should it again fall in any quantity,
it will cause the Mackenzie River to rise, and prevent our
crossing for some time to come.</p>
<p>March 11.&mdash;Our situation to-day was truly painful; the
invalids, who were better yesterday, having relapsed, and Mr.
Boecking and Wommai, the black fellow, were added to the list.
There were, consequently, only two of us able to go about and
attend upon the others&mdash;namely, Mr. Mann and myself. The
doctor suffered from the fever and ague, and lowness of spirits.
I believe the latter feeling arose from his having brought no
medicine, and seeing the helpless condition of the
party&mdash;surrounded as we were by wild black fellows, who,
although not visible, we knew, from their tracks, and
occasionally overhearing them, that they were not far distant.
The whole of the watching at night consequently devolved on Mr.
Mann and myself. During my watch this night, the dogs were very
uneasy, barking and running in the direction of a patch of scrub,
at a short distance from the camp, sufficient to afford shelter
to a whole tribe of blacks; and, being within spear-shot of our
camp, we were completely at their mercy, had they been inclined
to attack us. We, however, had taken the precaution of having
very small fires, covered with cow dung to hide the blaze, while
the smoke drove away the mosquitoes, greatly to the relief of the
invalids. Mr. Hely had recovered wonderfully; and it was arranged
that, in the event of our being able to cross the river (which
had fallen considerably the last day or two), to catch and load
the mules, cross, and camp above the junction of the Comet River
with the Mackenzie, where there was no flood, as the whole of the
water came from the Comet. Our black fellows assured us that we
might attribute our sickness to the <i>miasma</i>, arising from
the decayed vegetable matter left or deposited in the gullies
from whence the floods had receded, and to drinking the water in
such localities. They consequently highly applauded the intention
of Mr. Mann, Mr. Hely, and myself, as to our removal to above
where the river was flooded.</p>
<p>Until removing, at the suggestion of the blacks, we used the
water from a small water-hole in the scrub, in preference to the
river water, although it was rather muddy. The doctor allowed the
party to have a three-ounce allowance of damper, made into toast
and water, and highly relished by the invalids. It was fortunate
for us that our cattle, mules, and horses were tolerably tame,
and went out to feed and return of themselves without herding;
for this, however, we were indebted to the sandflies and
musquitoes, which generally attacked the cattle about ten or
eleven o'clock in the forenoon, when they immediately rushed home
to the camp, where we had several small fires lighted to keep the
insects off. The fish in this river must livery large and
numerous, judging by the noise caused by their leaping up above
the surface during the night, and may, perhaps, be the occasion
of its being so much resorted to by the blacks. To add to our
distress, we were again visited by another violent tropical
shower, and, so sudden was its approach, that we had not time to
remove the invalids to the tents before it commenced;
fortunately, however, it was not of long continuance, but
sufficient to prevent the sick from removing from their tents
during the whole night, where they were nearly driven mad by the
mosquitoes, as there was no possibility of lighting a fire and
causing a smoke in the tent.</p>
<p>March 12.&mdash;Mr. Hely had a relapse to-day, which put an
end to the possibility of crossing and removing higher up the
river. In the night. Dr. Leichhardt was very ill, and complained
much. Wommai also had a relapse, so that Mann and myself were the
only parties to keep watch and attend to the other duties.</p>
<p>March 13.&mdash;No visible improvement in the party, except
Perry, who ate a whole quart of skillygalee, which he managed to
retain in his stomach for the first time for many days; and I was
rejoiced at the circumstance.</p>
<p>Boecking, Hely, and Wommai took each an emetic. We were very
uneasy this day, at finding that the cattle, horses, and mules
did not return to the camp at the usual time. Both the blacks
being ill, the duty of looking for them, of course, devolved on
Mr. Mann or myself; and, as he was stronger than I, he kindly
undertook the job, and started in the afternoon, and returned in
the evening with the intelligence of having tracked them to a
dense scrub, when he returned to the encampment. Our scrub
water-hole becoming too thick and muddy, we were compelled again
to have recourse to the river.</p>
<p>March 14.&mdash;Sunday.&mdash;This morning was ushered in by
fine cooling and refreshing breezes from the southward; and, in
consequence, Dr. Leichhardt, Perry, Turnbull and Boecking felt a
little better. Wommai also felt the effects of the cool breezes,
and, although very ill, kindly undertook to ride and look for the
cattle. We killed another sheep, although Mr. Mann and I were the
only consumers. The doctor felt much better in the evening.
Wommai returned about four p.m. with the whole of the cattle.</p>
<p>Three other goats had kids. We had, however, much trouble in
catching the rascals to milk them. Wommai succeeded, at length,
with the lasso, which he had learned to throw from the Spaniards,
at his native place. Port Stephens.</p>
<p>It was not a little amusing to witness the various wants and
wishes of the different invalids. Poor Perry wished me this
morning to furnish him with a pinch of snuff. Mr. Boecking, who
was suffering more from the fever and ague than any of his
companions, would persist in eating his share of damper,
immediately it was cooked, in preference to having it afterwards
toasted, and made into toast and water. The only excuse to be
offered for him was, that he invariably took his meals kindly
under any circumstances. Mr. Turnbull's weakness was, a
determination to eat the sop from the toast and water. I would
not allow him to do so. The cattle came in of their own accord
this morning about eleven a.m. Mr. Perry wished for a piece of
grilled goat's flesh, which I cooked and gave to him. At the
present time we had scarcely a mule or a horse in hobbles, they
having broken them, from our inability to attend to such matters;
and I desired to see Mr. Perry sufficiently recovered to attend
to his duties. Dr. Leichhardt also took a small portion of
grilled goat's flesh for his breakfast. It struck me that under
the present circumstances a tonic would be advantageous to the
invalids, and with this view I sowed early this morning some
vegetable seeds.</p>
<p>Two more goats kided, making altogether five milkers. On
retiring to my blanket at night, I found a snake coiled between
its folds. Fortunately there was sufficient light from the Are to
enable me to observe it; indeed, I am generally cautious in
examining my blankets when I go to rest at a late hour. I was of
course anxious to dispose of so dangerous a bedfellow as quickly
as possible, and was in the act of shaking or kicking him into
the Are, but Dr. Leichhardt (who occupied the opposite side)
insisted on my not killing it, as it might prove a new species. I
remarked, that if he wished the gentleman secured it was highly
necessary for him to assist; he readily responded, and seized our
boiler, which he held on its side until I with much difficulty
managed to put the snake into the mouth, when the doctor
immediately placed on the lid, where we left him regularly potted
until daylight in the morning, when we discovered that it was one
of the common brown kinds, and as the boiler was required to boil
the water for tea, the snake was ejected, and the pot full of
water placed on the fire. This little incident shews how little
fastidious are bushmen when engaged in these expeditions.</p>
<p>March 16.&mdash;From the heat of yesterday, the invalids
appeared not to present any signs of improvement. The mustard and
cress seed sown yesterday morning made its appearance to-day
above ground. Early this morning a large congregation of crows
came and settled near the camp, and continued for the whole
day.</p>
<p>March 17.&mdash;The invalids were better this morning, except
Mr. Boecking, and his remaining worse was on account of his
humouring his voracious appetite. The doctor issued an order
yesterday that he in particular should be allowed to eat nothing
of a heavy nature. In despite, however, of this order, he went to
Mr. Mann, the storekeeper, for enough flour to make himself a
cake. Mr. Mann, however, refused to give him flour for any other
purpose than for making skillagalee. Boecking took some flour on
these conditions, but instead of converting the same into skilly,
he made himself a half-cooked heavy cake. Fortunately the doctor
observed the "dodge" before he had eaten it, and took it away
from him. On being denuded of his cake, the poor fellow gave such
a melancholy look as could only have been equalled by Adam when
expelled from the gates of Paradise. So deeply did he appear to
feel his loss, that, although I knew him to be wrong, I could not
do less than pity a man who appeared to be fated to carry with
him so destructive an appetite. The history of the cake was not
allowed to stop here. One of the others, who was not so sick as
Boecking, took it and fried it in the pan in fat with the view of
eating it. In this matter, however, he was as much mistaken as
was poor Boecking when Leichhardt deprived him of it; for while
the cake was swimming and phizzing away in the pan, and while the
party occupied in its cooking turned, for a moment only, his back
from his occupation, Boecking whipped his hand into the pan,
walked off with and after all enjoyed the pleasure of eating the
cake of his own making. In consequence of this transaction the
doctor issued an order that none of the invalids should be
allowed to have flour diet in any way for the next three days. A
two pound damper had been cooked before the leader had issued the
order, which consequently fell to the lot of Mr. Mann and myself,
as being the only parties able to get about. The sight of so much
bread falling to us nearly proved fatal to poor Boecking. We had
now thirteen or fourteen goats in milk, and we found it a great
improvement to our tea. The doctor was much better, but Mann and
myself were the only two capable of keeping watch.</p>
<p>March 18.&mdash;"Many happy returns of the day to you," were
the salutations I received on rising from my blanket this
morning, on which I commenced my thirty-fourth year of a crooked
and somewhat eventful life. The morning was dull and cloudy, and
being surrounded by so many invalids, whose spirits partook in a
great measure of the melancholy character of the weather, their
salutations were received by me in a very different manner than
when uttered in the midst of social life, and under other than
the present circumstances.</p>
<p>March 19.&mdash;From sundown last evening until sunrise this
morning the weather was cool and agreeable, and the invalids
obtained a little wholesome repose, the effect of which was
agreeably perceptible this morning, as they arose with better
spirits. Dr. Leichhardt, availing himself of this improvement,
had a horse saddled, on which we lifted the worst of the
invalids, who took a little exercise in that manner, alternately.
Brown (the blackfellow), considerably better, rode out with the
doctor, and shortly returned with the whole of the cattle. This
was a great relief to our minds, the cattle being our main stay.
Mr. Hely suffered much from constipation and had no relief for
nine days, nor had Boecking for eight. I attribute this in a
great measure to our being destitute of the necessary
medicines.</p>
<p>March 20.&mdash;Not the slightest improvement in any of the
party; and to add to our misery, we found that the only palatable
article we had was turned sour, namely our flour, and the doctor
issued an order that none of the invalids should be allowed to
eat any. Of course this order did not affect Mr. Mann or myself,
as we continued the only two convalescents. Poor Turnbull begged
hard for a portion of my three ounce cake, and I gave him a small
grain, not much larger than a penny piece, with which he appeared
much pleased.</p>
<p>March 21.&mdash;No improvement in the invalids. No medicines
of any kind, save calomel and quinine; the only stimulants being
fat mutton, goats' flesh, and sour flour. If they recover, they
will have reason to thank the Almighty for the possession of good
constitutions, and a more than usual share of human patience and
endurance. This continued sickness has driven many of them to
their bibles and prayer-books, a practice that I trust they may
continue.</p>
<p>The doctor gave the party a feed of skillygalee, made of
flour, which had been previously roasted in a pan with the view
to remove the acidity.</p>
<p>This delicacy was enjoyed by the whole of the party, invalids
and otherwise. He also promised us a similar treat on the
following day.</p>
<p>March 22.&mdash;Much disappointment was expressed this day by
the party from Dr. Leichhardt having broken faith with them as
regarded the feed of skillygalee similar to that of yesterday.
Wommai was much better; this was fortunate, one black fellow
being worth two, or I may say half-a-dozen white men, from their
sagacity, and capacity in tracking and finding cattle, and
general knowledge of locality.</p>
<p>March 23.&mdash;The invalids were a little better this
morning. I went down the banks of the Mackenzie river with a tin
plate, and knife, to cut a dish of the mustard and cress which I
had sown, and which I promised them as being ready for use this
day. On arriving, however, at the spot, judge of my surprise and
disgust at finding that the whole of it had been cut, and that
too by some one wearing European boots. Now, I knew that we were
surrounded by wild blackfellows, who might have cut it, although
it was not probable, but when I considered that they were not in
the habit of making or wearing boots, my suspicion rested on
three persons only, namely. Dr. Leichhardt, Mr. Mann, or myself,
the others being too ill to get about. Of course I was in a
position to account for my own innocence in the matter, and as I
had an equally good opinion of Mr. Mann, I was compelled to
appeal to Dr. Leichhardt for a solution of the mystery, who at
once admitted that he had cut and eaten it. This admission on the
part of the doctor was a sore disappointment to the poor helpless
invalids, who were unable to eat anything as substantial as meat,
And had been led by me for the last few days to expect on this
particular day a dish of this salad. Dr. Leichhardt observed,
that there would be more fit for cutting in two or three days,
and if the invalids liked to cut it themselves they might have
it, but not otherwise. This was tantamount to saying that they
should not have it, as they were not capable of moving twenty
yards from their blankets without assistance.</p>
<p>March 24.&mdash;Last evening, Mr. Mann, for the first time
exhibited symptoms of fever and ague, and took an emetic. We
commenced early this morning to make a kind of pen of boughs for
the purpose of swimming the sheep and goats to the opposite side
of the river. Mr. Mann (who was by profession a Civil Engineer
and Surveyor) was architect on the present occasion, but was,
shortly after commencing his labors, attacked by the fever and
ague, and compelled to take to his blanket. I was consequently
the only one to keep watch from dark until midnight; this I
considered to be necessary, owing to the patch of scrub which
left us at all times open to an attack from the natives. The
evenings, about eleven p.m., began to get cool and pleasant, and
from midnight to sunrise positively cold. The sheep pen on the
bank of the river was finished this evening by Dr. Leichhardt,
Boecking, and myself. A sheep's head was skinned, cleaned with
much trouble, and boiled. Each of the poor unfortunate invalids
was, in imagination, apportioning to himself a part. One was
going to secure a piece of the cheek&mdash;another a little of
the brain&mdash;another a small portion of the tongue. The whole
matter was, however, very shortly set at rest, greatly to the
disappointment of their prematurely formed expectations, by the
following accident:&mdash;Mr. Boecking, who had, as cook, the
management of the boiler, turned bis back for a short time, and
by the sudden falling-in of a log, the pot was capsized, and the
broth, for which many of their numbers had been waiting, was
spilled and lost. Dr. Leichhardt very coolly picked up the
sheep's "jemmy" from the sand» and placed the same on his plate;
and, deaf to the remonstrances of the patients, very quickly and
quietly swallowed the whole, bones excepted. None of the horses
returned to the camp to-day; and, as we had neglected to retain
one on the tether last evening for riding, much anxiety was
manifested on that account.</p>
<p>March 25.&mdash;Wommai was this morning despatched for the
missing horses, and Brown was compelled to accompany him in the
search, although the poor fellow was afraid it would either kill
or make him worse than ever. A few of the sick having passed the
crisis of their disorder, had an appetite, and complained
bitterly at the thinness of the skilly and tapioca.</p>
<p>The moment they had an appetite to eat, the allowance was
shortened. With the exception of Mr. Mann, they were all a little
better, which was, considering their treatment, a miracle. As we
intended crossing the river shortly, if the party were well
enough, I dug a hole at the butt of a large gum tree, on which
Dr. Leichhardt marked the word "dig". Here, as it was a problem
if we should ever reach this side of the river again, we buried a
powder cannister, containing a letter from Leichhardt,
representing the miserable and helpless condition of the party;
one from myself, addressed to the Melbourne <i>Argus</i>, and one
or two from the party. As Dr. Leichhardt has taken the same route
in his present expedition, should a party be organised to
ascertain his fate, it would be as well for them to note the
present remark. The tree is very large and isolated, at an angle
of the Mackenzie River, formed by the junction of the Comet; at
the hack is a dense patch of scrub, at a distance of probably one
hundred yards.</p>
<p>March 26.&mdash;We this morning made an attempt at crossing
the sheep and goats; hut I first buried the powder cannister, as
mentioned yesterday. After placing it in the hole, I strewed a
quantity of charcoal all around the cannister as a preservative.
The doctor, Wommai, myself, and Boecking were the only parties
able to assist in the work; poor Boecking was knocked up,
however, in half an hour. The heat of the sun, before getting the
whole of them across, was intense, and Wommai was nearly knocked
up.</p>
<p>March 27.&mdash;This morning Dr. Leichhardt issued orders for
all the people to rise and be in readiness for crossing the
river, as he strongly recommended exercise and violent exertion
under a tropical sun, as a substitute for medicine. I had
scarcely crossed and re-crossed the river, leading the pack mules
a second time, when I had a relapse, and was once more as
helpless as some of the others.</p>
<p>March 28.&mdash;In consequence of the exertions of yesterday,
the whole of the party were much worse, myself nearly dead. We
had not as yet had time or strength to erect a bower of any kind
to shelter us from the heat of the sun, which had thrown us into
a violent fever. The only sound persons now were Dr. Leichhardt
and Wommai. Altogether, our situation was at this moment truly
alarming&mdash;worse than on any former occasion.</p>
<p>March 29.&mdash;Towards daylight we were visited with a heavy
fall of rain, soaking the whole of the party excepting the
doctor. He, being well, had rigged up and occupied one of the
calico tents. A cat fish was caught and cooked, and we all ate a
small piece. From the heavy rains of this morning, the whole of
the party, as the night closed in, were worse than ever, and,
from their continued sickness, began to lose all heart and
confidence, fancying they would never recover.</p>
<p>March 30.&mdash;Was ushered in with another fall of rain. It
was really heartrending to see the debilitated position of our
little party, principally, I am sure, from the absence of
medicines, seven out of nine not being able to stand on their
legs for fifty seconds together, and reeling like drunken men. We
had every reason to believe that our sheep were lost. As the
evening threatened rain (and from my extreme sickness), I was
invited by the doctor to occupy a part or his tent. Dr.
Leichhardt and Wommai took a ride, and fortunately returned with
the whole of the cattle.</p>
<p>On the day preceding that on which we crossed the river, there
was some more mustard and cress fit for cutting, and of which I,
on this occasion, took care that they partook.</p>
<p>March 31.&mdash;The weather continued to he oppressively hot,
and the situation of the invalids was rendered more unbearable
from their inability to erect a bower to shelter them from the
heat of the sun. I regret to remark that many of the party, from
various circumstances, expressed a desire to return, and indeed
made an application to the doctor to that effect, requesting that
he would allow them to do so under the conduct and guidance of
Brown, one of the blackfellows, who was as anxious for this step
as any of the others. In this matter of trusting themselves to
the guidance of Brown, they were acting, in my opinion, with very
poor judgment, as a blackfellow in a new country is one of the
most helpless and stupid companions imaginable. Ill as I was, I
strongly objected to returning, after having progressed so long a
distance on the expedition.</p>
<p>April 2.&mdash;Continued grumbling at being debarred the use
of sugar.</p>
<p>April 3 and 4.&mdash;It never rains, they say, but it pours.
On the first of these days Dr. Leichhardt gave the party a
quantity of dough-boys, or, as we called them, dips, and on the
following day a suet pudding.</p>
<p>April 5.&mdash;Whether arising from the quantity of dough
taken for the last two days, in the shape of dough-boys and suet
pudding, or from the heat of the weather, I know not, but they
were much worse this morning, and in consequence the doctor very
wisely came to the determination of taking the worst of the
invalids a few days' stages towards Peak Range, where the country
was more elevated.</p>
<p>April 6.&mdash;We were early astir this morning, catching and
loading some of the mules to take with us to carry stores for the
invalids. We started early, and took with us Brown, Boecking,
Perry, and Wommai. We took the latter, however, merely for the
purpose of bringing the cattle, in which duty he was assisted by
Boecking. We encamped on a back water, or tributary of the
Mackenzie river. Much anxiety was manifested on account of
Boecking and Wommai not making their appearance until after dusk,
and only bringing with them a portion of our herd of cattle,
namely 26 out of 38.</p>
<p>April 7.&mdash;We made a short stage, and camped on the bank
of the Mackenzie, at a hole where the water was very clear and
good. Our black fellow, Brown, on observing the goodness of the
water, pronounced his opinion that we should soon recover. After
assisting in unloading the mules. Dr. Leichhardt returned, with
Wommai, to the camp he had left, promising to rejoin us in a few
days with the remainder of the party and stores.</p>
<p>April 8.&mdash;Brown and Turnbull exhibit signs of
improvement, which Brown attributes to the goodness of the water
at this place.</p>
<p>April 9.&mdash;We were this day visited by a large school of
crows, who not only annoyed us by their unpleasant croaking, but
flew off with pieces of our meat.</p>
<p>April 10.&mdash;Boecking was better this morning, and
undertook to go in search of the horses and goats. We mounted him
on the horse which we had tethered at the camp. As he did not
return in the evening we commenced firing guns; but no signs of
Boecking all night.</p>
<p>April 11.&mdash;Boecking not having returned last night, and
as Brown was too ill to go and track him, I myself took a walk
along the bank of the river, where I observed his trail for some
distance. I continued on his track until I was knocked up, and
being fearful that I might be required at the camp, after taking
a little rest, I returned, and left poor Boecking to his fate.
About 3 p.m. he made his appearance, and accounted for his
absence from having mistaken the gullies and backwaters of the
Mackenzie for the streams of the river itself. This is a mistake
very commonly made by parties who are not in the habit of
travelling, and taking notes of localities in the bush. He
complained bitterly of having forgotten to take his tinder-box,
which deprived him of the pleasure of a smoke or fire. There was
a great show of fruit or berries on various kinds of salsolaceous
plants, which were good to eat; of this fact poor Boecking was
fortunately aware, and he appears to have made so good a use of
his knowledge, that on travelling down the river in that
direction afterwards, there was scarcely a berry to be seen.
These fruits appeared to act on Boecking as a powerful tonic, and
oil reaching the camp (although I cautioned him to the contrary)
I placed by the side of the blankets on which he was reclining a
leg of mutton; on my return to him shortly afterwards, what was
my surprise at finding that he had cleaned the meat to the bone,
and was swelling and straining his eyeballs like a frog in
convulsions. But the most remarkable feature in the whole affair
was, that after this very remarkable feat, which would have done
credit to the celebrated Dando, he continued to recover apace,
and he ever afterwards attributed his recovery to this leg of
mutton.</p>
<p>On our way from the old to the present camp, the country in
places opened with small patches of plains, surrounded by
<i>Brigalowe, Myall, Dodonea, Santalum</i>, and innumerable other
shrubs and trees, forming thick scrubs. On the surface of these
plains were large blocks of fossil or petrified wood, in some
cases whole stems of trees in this state of petrifaction, and
occasional blocks of bright-looking coal cropping out along the
banks of the river and back waters, might be seen. I am certain
that at this place coal of the best and most gaseous description
might be obtained, sufficient to supply the colony for centuries.
But how it is to be brought into requisition, unless the
Mackenzie river may prove to be navigable, is beyond my power to
show. It would not be practicable in the direction in which we
travelled, from the large belts of scrub, and broken ranges, to
take waggons even for the purpose of occupying the country for
grazing.</p>
<p>About four p.m.. Dr. Leichhardt returned with the remainder of
the party, in whom there was no improvement. Ours was now a sick
camp, indeed; myself and the doctor being the only two
individuals able to get about.</p>
<p>April 11 to 16.&mdash;The whole of my time, during this
interval, was devoted to searching for the horses, mules, goats,
sheep, and cattle. The sheep and goats were completely lost, and,
if not immediately forthcoming, the doctor intended abandoning
them, and depending, in future, upon the cattle for subsistence,
of which we had yet left thirty-eight head.</p>
<p>April 17.&mdash;We made another start this morning, leaving
the goats and sheep to their fate. Our day's stage was at no
great distance from the bank of the river, and the country was
much broken, uneven, and intersected with innumerable dry, or
nearly dried up, backwaters and lagoons of the Mackenzie. This
style of travelling was very trying to my poor fellow-sufferers,
who had to be lifted on their horses on starting in the morning,
and who were so exhausted from the exertion of having to hold on
by their horses' manes in rising and descending the numerous
gullies that, on sighting a lagoon containing a good supply of
water, the doctor was induced to camp. Adorning the edge of this
lake were some very magnificent trees of the <i>Bauhinia</i>,
from which I collected seed. These trees were growing among
<i>Brigalowe</i>, which formed a thick scrub in one direction. On
the immediate bank of the lagoon, they were but thinly scattered,
sufficient only to add to the beauty of the scenery. It is a
remarkable circumstance, that a tree so common in its growth, and
so generally distributed&mdash;so much so as to be one of the
greatest enemies to the settlers in the newly-formed countries in
the northern latitudes&mdash;should never have been known to have
produced either a seed or blossom. Among the <i>Brigalowe</i>
scrubs, as we drew nearer the tropics, I found the undergrowth of
smaller plants to change their features: instead of the various
kinds of <i>Dodonea</i>, frequently mentioned, and similar
plants, we had now many species of the <i>Myaporum</i>, very
dwarf, with bright, shining foliage, and waxen blossoms, highly
odoriferous. Three species of <i>Jasminum</i>, or sweet jasmine,
with blossoms plentiful, very large, and as fragrant as the
European species. These plants, were succeeded by large clusters
of black, brilliantly-shining berries, which the aborigines led
as to understand were poisonous.</p>
<p>Three new species of Cassia; one species was in full flower,
and very fragrant&mdash;indeed, all the plants, as we approached
the tropics, appeared to possess a richer and more powerful
perfume.</p>
<p>In the hollows, so common to the scrubs from whence the water
had receded, were a large species of <i>Anthericum</i>, or
<i>Bulbine</i>&mdash;a very remarkable sedge
(<i>Fimbristylus</i>), and a very pretty dwarf, growing densely
<i>pinnate</i>&mdash;species of <i>Ashonemonie</i>. On
approaching the lagoons, or water-holes, towards sundown, we
seldom failed to disturb large flocks of the little partridge
pigeon, which we were in the habit of shooting, and found an
agreeable variety to our very limited diet. Of kangaroos, emus,
and turkeys, we had seen but few since leaving the Dawson River.
Of snakes, however, and iguannas, we had no stint; the largest
specimen of the former myself, Mr. Boecking, and Dr. Leichhardt
saw while camping on the Mackenzie River. Its place of abode was
a very large, hollow tree, standing at a considerable distance
from our camp, and on the edge of the river. Mr. Boecking was the
first to observe and report the circumstance; but, from his
representation of its immense size, we gave little credence to
his statements. He had only seen two-thirds of the creature, as
it was in the act of entering the hollow of the tree.
Subsequently, however, both Dr. Leichhardt and myself saw it at
the same time, and precisely in the same position as described by
Boecking, with his head and part of his body in the tree; but,
having no gun at the time, we were unable to kill and take its
dimensions. It was certainly the largest snake I had ever seen,
and longer than I had imagined any of these kind of reptiles to
exist in Australia.</p>
<p>April 18.&mdash;One of the mules not being forthcoming this
morning, we were necessitated to remain at the camp for the day.
I took a stroll amongst the <i>Brigalowe</i> plantation, it was
not dense enough to be called a scrub; and I saw scattered in
various directions a number of very curious shells,
<i>convolute</i>, and flat like the <i>ammonite</i>, as well as a
fine specimen of the <i>Paludina</i>, with the <i>operculums</i>
perfect. These were, however, only seen in or near the little
water-holes, surrounded by aquatic weeds, of which I found one
that both Dr. Leichhardt and myself considered as a new species
of <i>Vallisneria</i>, with pyramidal, showy blossoms. I also saw
in this scrub the beautiful arborescent <i>Capparis
Mitchellii</i> in full blossom, for the first time. I endeavoured
to preserve a few of these large, graceful, and fragile blossoms;
but my specimens, on opening them some months afterwards, on my
return to civilisation, I found to be much injured, and very
imperfect. Wommai shot a wallaby; the specimen was much smaller
than the common kind, and had a dark brown stripe on either
cheek. It was skinned, and the skin preserved; but,
unfortunately, it was afterwards accidentally lost, with the
whole of our collection of animals and insects, of which he had
collected a great number.</p>
<p>April 19.&mdash;This day, shortly after starting, the
character of the country changed to large, open, and very
extensive plains of volcanic formation, over which was scattered
a variety of pretty-looking pebbles, mixed with broken fragments
of quartz and agates; many of the latter were very clear, and
presented a variety of colors. About two hours after leaving the
camp, Brown, the black fellow, caught sight of Peak Ranges. They
were merely two very remarkable-looking pyramidal hills. Having
again entered on the region of plains, we had a renewal of our
troubles with the mules. Very common to these plains, was a
large-growing <i>salsolaceous</i> plant, belonging to the
<i>Chenopodeaceæ</i>, of Jussieu. These weeds grow in the form of
a large ball, to the height of five or six feet, and, being
annuals, die away in the autumn, and, as they do not speedily
decay, lie loose on the surface. Whirlwinds were very common,
and, as these weeds came within its influence, they were taken up
to a considerable height, sometimes out of sight. Very frequently
these eddies took place within a few yards in advance of our
cavalcade. No sooner were a few of these balls (or, as we were in
the habit of calling them, "rolly-poleys") taken up with the
current of air, than the mules began to kick and buck, until they
had relieved themselves of their loads. The exercise necessary
for catching and reloading them again was very trying, when the
smallness of our numbers and the heat of the weather is
considered, we being now seven miles within the Tropics.</p>
<p>Continued travelling longer than usual, and began to apprehend
that we should have to camp without water, when Brown was heard
to cooee. We followed the direction of the cooee, and came upon a
fine lagoon of good water. The flies continued troublesome, and
we travelled with our eyes but half open, and the mosquitoes
to-night prevented any of us getting a fair share of sleep.</p>
<p>I forgot to remark, that on the Mackenzie we found a large
climbing papilionaceous plant, probably a glycine. The fruit was
a large pod, nine inches long. The beans contained in these pods
were, at the suggestion of Dr. Leichhardt, roasted and made into
coffee, in which character it was used; one dose of this beverage
was sufficient, as it created a violent vomiting and
diarrh&oelig;a.</p>
<p>April 20.&mdash;Left our encampment this morning about ten
a.m., and continued travelling over the same fine open country,
the soil being rich and of deep black color, covered with the
richest verdure, consisting of two grasses, much admired by
sheep-farmers, namely, <i>Panicum Leavinode</i>, or millet grass,
and <i>Anthistiria</i>, or kangaroo grass. The <i>Panicum
Leavinode</i> is the plant from which the natives make their
bread, and is called by the blacks of Liverpool Plains,
<i>coola</i> grass. This plant produces an abundance of a small
firm and heavy seed. which when ripe, is by them collected in
nearly the same manner as corn by the Europeans. It is cut,
dried, and threshed, and after the seed is properly winnowed from
the chaff, it is crushed and pounded to a pulp between two heavy
stones, after which it is made into bread. It has often puzzled
me to know how the wild blacks contrived to cut the grass,
having, as far as I have observed, nothing in the shape of sharp
instruments at all adapted for the purpose. We occasionally came
across very large heaps of the refuse, that had evidently been
cut by some sharp instrument. From the Hunter's river to the
Tropics, the aborigines appeared to have been fully aware of the
value and importance of this plant, and they all appeared to
adopt the same method in its preparation.</p>
<p>Among the grasses on these plains were a great variety of
aromatic herbs, which, from the trampling of our horses and
cattle, gave out a sweet refreshing perfume. Among them I found a
new species of marjoram, which we were sometime afterwards in the
habit of cutting, drying, and using in the liquor in which our
dried meat was boiled, and was a great improvement to the flavour
to our apology for soup. The only trees on these plains were a
few solitary individuals of the <i>Brigalowe</i>.</p>
<p>To this fine country, unfortunately, there appeared to be no
means of approach with a dray, which was in every way so
admirably adapted to the purposes of keeping either sheep or
cattle, as, in addition to the richness of the herbage, the
little clumps of shrubs first mentioned would form excellent
places of shelter during the heat of the day. The weather
continued hot, and the flies as troublesome as ever. We had
travelled until late in the afternoon without sighting water, or
anything like a water channel, and we began to fear that we
should have to camp without it. This was no pleasant prospect, as
the invalids, who were still suffering from the effects of fever
and ague, were beginning to complain much of thirst.</p>
<p>The cattle, also, from the excessive heat of the weather,
appeared to be suffering from the same cause. Brown, the
blackfellow, was dis-. patched to search for this much coveted
agent, with instructions to fire a gun in the event of his being
successful. Should we find water first we were of course to fire
a gun in the same manner, as a signal for him to join us.</p>
<p>Shortly after Brown departed we observed what appeared to be a
very small channel in wet weather; by following this down for a
little more than an hour, we came to a hole containing a small
quantity of liquid mud. We had much difficulty in keeping the
mules from rushing into it and getting bogged. Although we
succeeded in keeping the mules from it, we were not so fortunate
with some of the party, who, more stubborn than the mules, would
persist in drinking a small quantity of this lukewarm and muddy
deposit. We continued following the course of the channel until
sundown, when we came, as we expected, upon a fine creek at a
bend where there was a fine sheet of pure water, with sandy
banks. The party were much exhausted on reaching the camp. Just
as we came upon the creek. Brown rode up and joined us, with the
intelligence that he also had found a waterhole.</p>
<p>April 21.&mdash;In collecting the horses this morning, we
perceived that four were missing; and we were consequently
compelled to remain at the camp the whole day. It was fortunate
for us that along the hank of the creek were some fine green
spreading gum trees, which partly-sheltered us from the scorching
rays of the sun. Growing and twining round the branches of
<i>Dodonea</i>, bastard sandal wood, and other shrubs, which
clothed the bank of the creek, were a large number of the native
melon (<i>Cucumis mollis</i>), or downy cucumber, which, some
months subsequent to the present time, we were in the habit of
collecting and converting into an article of food, when we had
but little else to eat. We now, for the first time, began to feel
the loss of our sheep and goats. We had no meat, and it was too
late to kill a bullock. In this dilemma. Dr. Leichhardt ordered
the cook to mix up a lot of flour, and treated us all to a feed
of dips. These were made as follows:&mdash;a quantity of flour
was mixed up with water, and stirred with a spoon to a certain
consistency, and dropped into a pot of boiling water, a spoonful
at a time. Five minutes boiling was sufficient, when they were
eaten with the water in which they were boiled.</p>
<p>April 22.&mdash;Having no meat, and as the morning broke fine,
the doctor determined on killing and drying our only cow. As this
was the first beast we had dried after the South American
fashion, in the sun, perhaps a short description of the process
may not be considered uninteresting. The bull, or, as in our
case, the cow, being killed, it was first cut into quarters, or
large pieces, and placed on a stage erected for the occasion. In
this manner it was allowed to remain one night. I should have
said that we always killed in the evening. In the meantime, the
party&mdash;at least, such as were able to job about&mdash;were
engaged in various duties connected with the drying; some in
cutting saplings and forks, which others carried to the place
where they were wanted for the stage. After a sufficient quantity
of forks and poles were cut, and on the ground, they were rigged
up in the shape of a stage, on which the meat was hung. The stage
being erected, in readiness at daylight in the morning, the whole
of them were employed in sharpening their knives, and cutting off
the meat from the bones in long steaks, and not more than one
inch in thickness. As the meat was cut off in this manner, others
were employed in hanging it on the poles. Generally speaking, a
bullock would be cut up, and hung out by two or three p.m. It was
allowed to remain in this fashion until eleven o'clock on the
following day, when it was turned, much to the annoyance of
myriads of blow-flies, who had deposited thereon a tolerable
quantity of <i>larvæ</i>. On the third day, these <i>larvæ</i>,
or fly-blows, or maggots (it is best to speak in the vulgar
tongue), might be seen in full life and activity travelling and
exploring the piece of meat which had, for a time, become their
adopted home. In turning, we, of course, knocked off as many of
these gentry as possible. If the weather proved fine, a bullock
was dried, chopped up, and packed in four or five days.</p>
<p>We were doomed in this, as in everything else connected with
the expedition, to be unfortunate.</p>
<p>April 23.&mdash;The party were busily employed in cutting up
the beef; and a great portion was hung out to dry. Before,
however, they had finished cutting up, it commenced raining
heavily, and continued for the remainder of that day and the
following night. Having no tents, we were, of course, completely
saturated in our blankets; and this, we had every reason to
apprehend, would tend to a relapse with the invalids&mdash;who
had, for the last few days, exhibited signs of
improvement&mdash;as well as the destruction of our meat.</p>
<p>April 24.&mdash;The rain still continued until nearly noon,
when it cleared up, and the sun made its appearance, when we lost
no time in turning the meat. It continued fine, however, for a
very short time, when it commenced again raining in torrents;
and, as the party had no means of shelter, the fever and ague
again made its appearance.</p>
<p>April 25.&mdash;This morning broke fine, and the sun rose in
all its splendor. The meat was again turned, and was found to be
eatable, although, from the late rains, it was much and strongly
tainted. Several of our horses were missing.</p>
<p>April 26.&mdash;The weather was very warm; and many of the
party, from their late soaking, were very weak again, and moved
about with difficulty.</p>
<p>April 27.&mdash;The doctor had intended going this morning,
accompanied by Brown, to look for the stray horses, but they both
found themselves too unwell.</p>
<p>April 28.&mdash;The doctor and Wommai went in search of the
horses, but found two only. Great dissatisfaction was expressed
at the camp this day, from the doctor having reduced our rations
of tainted meat to two-thirds of a pound to each individual. It
was rather unfortunate that he should have done this just at the
time when they were most in need of nourishment.</p>
<p>April 29.&mdash;Both Dr. Leichhardt and Wommai went out this
morning to look for the horses. The former returned shortly after
starting, being too ill to continue the search; but the latter
did not return all night. From the last two fine days, the meat
was well dried, and was cut up with tomahawks into small pieces,
of about two inches in length, and packed in sacks for the
convenience of carriage. The entrails were dried and packed up in
a similar manner, for the use of our four canine
companions&mdash;namely, Spring, Norval, Camden, and Wasp; the
latter was a small terrier, and a great pet of the doctors.</p>
<p>April 30.&mdash;From the continued ill state of the doctor and
many of the party, a proposition was again made to him to return.
Upon hearing this second application, he came to me, and asked if
I was one of those for going back. I told him that I was not,
but, on the contrary, desirous of reaching Swan River; and I
thought that, by studying the wishes of his party, ha would find
them pretty much of my mind. And, in the first place, I suggested
an increase in flour, which was immediately granted.</p>
<p>May 1.&mdash;We were busy this day in packing up, and making
arrangements for another start. The increase of our flour diet
had already done wonders, and given a fresh impetus to the
invalids.</p>
<p>May 2.&mdash;This morning made another move from our camp.
Just, however, as we were leaving, our usual bad luck began to
show itself. Mr. Mann was taken seriously and suddenly ill. As
everything was in readiness for moving, the doctor commenced the
march, and left poor Mr. Mann behind with Brown, who was also
unwell, with instructions, as soon as Mr. Mann felt himself
sufficiently recovered, to follow upon our tracks. We continued
travelling over well-grassed plains, of great extent, until
nearly sundown, without finding water. Dr. Leichhardt caught
sight of a number of cockatoos; and, by tracking the course of
their flight, we, in a short time, reached a creek well supplied
With water. Scattered over these plains were some fine trees of
the laurel-leaved and box gum. We had the remarkable Peak Range
in view the greater part of the day, and, by evening, we had
approached it so closely as to be able to discern the outlines of
trees on the tops of the peaks. Neither Mr. Mann, Brown, or
Wommai appeared that night.</p>
<p>May 3.&mdash;About eleven in the forenoon Mr. Mann and Brown
reached the camp. They appeared to be much exhausted, having had
nothing to eat except a few very small fish, found in some small
shallow water holes, and were caught easily with a pocket
handkerchief. Night closed without Wommai making his appearance
with the cattle. This circumstance created much uneasiness at the
camp, as we had nothing but the cattle to fall back upon for
subsistence.</p>
<p>May 4.&mdash;Wommai reached the camp by breakfast time, but
without the cattle. The poor fellow was nearly starved, and
otherwise in a bad humour. He had tasted nothing since parting
with us, and having missed our track in consequence of Dr.
Leichhardt having made a sudden turn to the right, he had taken
the cattle back to the old camp, where he had left them, and had
since followed upon our track on horseback until reaching the
camp, to avoid (as he said) being starved to death. Before
leaving this morning, Mr. Hely and Brown were dispatched for the
cattle, with instructions to bring them in the direction of the
Peaks, as our stage Would be in that direction. Our day's journey
was over the same fine rich open plains, and we encamped in the
evening at one' of the doctor's old camps, when on his way to
Port Essington, at no great distance from the Peak.</p>
<p>May 5.&mdash;Made a short stage over a beautiful undulating
park-like country, better grassed if possible than any we had as
yet passed over. We saw many kangaroos and emus. We camped early
in the afternoon, at a fine waterhole. We fixed our camp on a
patch of elevated land, a kind of terrace, on which were some
fine patches of scrub. It was from this camp that we intended to
commence making our westing, or longitude, for Swan River.
Neither Mr. Hely or Brown made their appearance with the
cattle.</p>
<p>May 6.&mdash;Here we had to remain until the arrival of the
men who were absent, which was not until the evening, and then
their appearance was anything but of a gratifying character. They
had seen nothing of the cattle, and returned with but one horse
between them. Brown lost his, the day after leaving us, at the
camp where we had killed and dried the cow.</p>
<p>May 7.&mdash;Here we were again fixed for probably some time,
as it was not at all unlikely that the cattle may have taken
their journey homewards. Dr. Leichhardt went out to reconnoitre
the surrounding country, and Mr. Hely, Brown, and Wommai to find
the cattle and horses. They took two or three days provisions
with them. Mr. Mann shot a few small partridge-pigeons at a
waterhole this morning, Dr. Leichhardt did not return to the camp
at night, and much anxiety was manifested on his account. Of
course, neither Hely, Brown, or Wommai, were expected for two or
three days.</p>
<p>May 8.&mdash;The doctor did not join us until noon this day,
and accounted for his absence by having lost his way. He blamed
us for not firing guns, on his not appearing at the camp last
night. We of course expressed our regret at his having to sleep
all night without a blanket, food, or society. But after taking
his food he fortunately lost his appetite and ill humour
together. He spoke highly of the country to the westward, our
intended line of route. He had seen plenty of water. The country
was, however, rough and stoney, and bad travelling for
horses.</p>
<p>May 9.&mdash;Erected a kind of bower, as the doctor was
unwell. The other members of the party suffering from a violent
attack of diarrh&oelig;a.</p>
<p>May 10, 11, and 12.&mdash;The nights became cold. Thermometer
average&mdash;sundown, 64; sunrise, 42. Our latitude, 22.54
south; elevation, 1,038 feet. The cook, Boecking, put leaven in
our miniature damper&mdash;a great improvement.</p>
<p>May 13.&mdash;The nights continued cold. The doctor was
requested to fulfil his promise to the party in giving them some
flour and sugar to celebrate our reaching Peak Range. He refused.
In this matter he may have acted from a feeling of economy,
fearing that we may have lost our cattle, as well as several
horses; nothing as yet having been heard of the party gone in
search.</p>
<p>May 14.&mdash;This morning Dr. Leichhardt rode to a waterhole,
three miles from our camp, to ascertain the capabilities of that
place for killing another bullock, if the cattle are found.</p>
<p>May 15.&mdash;The party in search of the cattle had now been
absent nine days, and great anxiety was manifested for their
safety. Symptoms of fever and ague were again apparent with those
whom we had imagined to have recovered. Of what incalculable
benefit to the party would have been a package of those
invaluable pills manufactured by Dr. L.L. Smith, the infallible
properties of which are modestly represented by the inventor as
being capable of caring every disease incidental to humanity,
from a <i>corn</i> to a <i>consumption</i>. Dr. Smith was,
however, <i>non est</i>, and his pills consequently not
comeatable, so that it is now useless to lament their absence.
The moon changed, and the weather became cloudy and overcast in
the evening. I believe this, however, to be pretty generally the
case at every change of the moon in the northern latitudes.</p>
<p>May 16.&mdash;No signs of the cattle, or the party who were in
search of them. We had only dried meat enough to last us the day,
and the country being destitute of game, our position was not of
the most cheering character. If they are fortunate enough to find
and bring in the whole of the cattle, they will not he more than
sufficient to carry us to Swan River, which we cannot expect to
reach in less than eighteen months.</p>
<p>May 17.&mdash;Mr. Hely, Brown, and Wommai, returned with only
nine head of cattle, which they found in one mob by themselves,
having separated from the main herd. They had also seen two more
mobs, one consisting of four, and another of three, making
altogether eighteen head, and there were consequently twenty more
of which they had seen nothing. If we are fortunate in finding
the whole herd, it will be very difficult in future to prevent
their straying. They were fortunate in catching, with the
assistance of the dogs, an emu and a kangaroo, or they would have
suffered from want of food, having eaten their rations by the
fourth day after leaving the camp. They had come suddenly on a
camp of wild blacks, before either party were aware of it. They
endeavoured by signs to make themselves understood, but</p>
<p>May 18.&mdash;This day it was the doctor's intention to return
to the creek we had previously left, for the purpose of killing
and drying one of the nine bullocks, his object being to get the
benefit of water, as our present water hole was nearly exhausted.
But not being able to find the horses, and many of the mules also
having strayed, he determined on killing the bullock at our
present camp. We had been already two days without meat; and we
were not sorry to see Brown take aim with his rifle, and bring
down one of the fattest of the remaining nine. We were all very
hungry, and set to with a will in rigging up a stage, in order
that no time should be lost, while the weather proved fine.</p>
<p>May 19.&mdash;Mr. Hely and Brown were again despatched for the
cattle, with a stock of provisions for five days. Brown intimated
having found a fine camp at some distance from this place; and
Hely and Brown had instructions given to them by the doctor that,
if our present stock of water proved insufficient, we should move
on to the place indicated, where they were to rejoin us, if they
found we had left the present camping ground on their return. We
were all busy in cutting up and drying. A killing day was always
a grand day with us, as we had as much and, in fact, more than we
could eat. The boiler was never idle during that period, and the
cook had his hands full, as, in fact, had all the rest, with
grilled bones and Boup made from the head and other offal. I had
cut, dried, and rubbed to powder some of the new native marjoram,
which the cook mixed up with the blood and some fat; and with
this he made thirty-two black puddings.</p>
<p>Having been so long stinted to a small quantity of dried
tainted meat, we requested the doctor to allow us to reserve a
piece of the round for salting, the taste of which, we told him,
would remind us of old times. He consented, and a piece about
thirty pounds was salted and put by. From the time of killing the
last bullock up to the present moment, we had a succession of
beautifully fine weather. We had no sooner, however, got the meat
cut up and hung on the stage, when, about six p.m., it commenced
raining heavily. Poor Leichhardt appeared to be almost
heart-broken at the circumstance, remarking, that nothing but a
continued chain of misfortune appeared to attend the present
expedition. We covered the stage where the meat was hanging with
our two old tents, and crawled underneath for shelter, enjoying,
not only the rank smell, but receiving all the gravy as it exuded
from the meat. We were just on the eve of going to sleep, when we
were disturbed by hearing that the dogs had broken loose, and
were making free with our beautiful round of salt beef. This fact
was no sooner communicated to those who were under the stage,
than they immediately arose. But our discovery arrived too late;
as, after dragging it in the sand, they had eaten all the fat off
it, of which we were all particularly fond. The dogs were again
tied up, and the meat put by until morning, when it was washed
preparatory to being used. Another specimen, as the doctor
remarked, of the spirit of opposition and misfortune accompanying
our undertaking. "Misfortunes never come alone", says the
proverb. We had no sooner again taken to our cover, than
Turnbull, who was watching the cattle, gave the very unpleasant
intelligence that they had again bolted. This was a worse
misfortune than the loss of the round of beef, and sent us again
to our miserable quarters with heavy hearts.</p>
<p>May 20.&mdash;It was delightful to contrast the brilliant
rising of the sun this morning, with our dark and unhealthy
quarters of the previous night; nothing could exceed the balmy
fragrance of the air, and the chirping of the little feathered
choristers, as they approached to drink at the water hole then
fast drying up. We were all very busy in cutting up and turning
the meat. We had scarcely congratulated ourselves on the
favorable progress made in preserving the meat, when, about four
p.m., the sky again became overcast and cloudy, as also did the
countenances of my companions at the prospect of another wet
night. Fortunately, however, it cleared up in the evening, and a
fine clear night followed, thus enabling the whole of the party
to obtain a good night's repose around the fire. As the nights
were now getting cold, we began to fancy we could put up with an
additional half-blanket, as those in use were half worn out.
Before going to sleep, we became alarmed at the non-appearance of
Wommai; but our fears were allayed about midnight, when he made
his appearance with the cattle, having found his way to the camp
by moonlight. The instinct of some of the aborigines is
remarkable, as in this instance. Here was a black fellow, in a
new country, hundreds of miles from civilised life, with no
track, and no knowledge of the use of the compass, traversing
many miles of country, and, being in search of cattle, rendered
his course circuitous; and yet, without a landmark, and with a
mob of cattle driving, he managed to travel for hours by night
through a country, in many cases, thickly timbered and scrubby.
With all these impediments, is it not wonderful that, by an
instinct peculiar, I believe; to savages only, he was able to
steer directly to our camp, which occupied, comparatively
speaking, so small a space?</p>
<p>May 21.&mdash;The weather continued fine, and our meat was
drying beautifully. Much anxiety was manifested on account of the
lost stock. I looked over my botanical specimens, and was
rejoiced to find them uninjured, excepting some specimens of the
beautiful but fragile blossoms of the <i>Capparis Mitchellii</i>.
Wommai brought me, on his return, some green and dry pods of the
creeping plant to which we had given the name of the Mackenzie
Bean, having found it, in the first instance, growing on the
banks of that river. I subsequently found the same plant very
plentifully on the banks of the river Burnett, in the district of
Wide Bay.</p>
<p>May 22.&mdash;Another bright and glorious sunrise&mdash;a
finer day never broke. A great consolation to those labouring
under depression of spirits consequent on their long illness.
Yesterday the cattle contrived again to escape, and poor Wommai,
as a matter of course, was sent to bring them back. But for the
good tempered and willing disposition of Wommai on all occasions,
I know not what would have been the fate of the expedition. After
having eaten the fiour and sugar to a certain extent, the
remainder was put by, and it was laid down as a general rule, to
be only used on festivals and fast days, such as Christmas Day,
Good Friday, &amp;c. The following day being Whitsunday, was,
after some little discussion, declared as coming under the head
of festivals, it was determined we should have our accustomed
feed allowed on such occasions&mdash;a boiled suet pudding
weighing five pounds. This, when divided among nine individuals,
was a very great indulgence towards us on the part of the doctor,
our usual allowance of flour diet, whilst that article was in
general use, being only three ounces to each individual daily.
The anticipation of the forthcoming feed of pudding gave a
cheerful appearance to the countenances of each individual. The
party still continued very weak. I cannot help thinking that much
of our sickness was attributable to an over indulgence on killing
days, when each man had the privilege of eating as much as he
wanted. No small temptation certainly to men who were, during the
intervals, limited to a small allowance. These days were a kind
of jubilee in our reckoning,&mdash;cooking and eating, rolling
and smoking to any extent, and gnawing grilled bones as large as
one's arm,&mdash;this feeding on the spare bones and other parts
of the bullock, which would otherwise have been lost, continued
for four or five days, the time usually necessary in drying the
meat. This over eating and luxuriating, like other debauches,
had, in my opinion, a great influence in prolonging the
sickness.</p>
<p>Wommai returned with the cattle. During Mr. Perry's watch they
again made off, and Mr. P. very foolishly followed them, and lost
himself. In about four hours he returned. He had the good sense
to give the horse his head, or he would never have found the camp
at all. A sort of fatality appeared to accompany Mr. Perry, this
being the third time he had lost himself while on watch, and on
every occasion it was on the eve of a festival. It was hinted by
some of the party that Dr. Leichhardt should be applied to for a
little sugar in addition to the flour, as in that case Mr.
Turnbull volunteered his services as cook in making a bolster
pudding. Latitude of our camp, 22.54; elevation, 1,038 feet.</p>
<p>May 23.&mdash;All along the banks of the rivers and creeks, as
well as other low situations where the water occasionally
settled, forming a rich diluvian, we seldom failed to observe an
abundant growth of a species of <i>grewia</i>. The <i>grewia</i>
in general appearance and foliage is not unlike the filbert nut
tree: instead, however, of growing to the size of the latter, its
height seldom exceeded five feet, except in very sheltered and
favorable situations, where it occasionally attained a foot or
eighteen inches higher. The product of this plant was a small
fruit forming a three-celled capsule, about the size of the
common hazel nut of Britain. Its appearance to the hungry
traveller, at the first glance, was rather of a tempting
character, being a rich soft red, like that common to peaches,
apparently fleshy. On testing its qualities, however, it was
found to be of little use except to those who could boast of a
good set of teeth, which enabled them to crack the internal stone
of which it principally consisted, when a very pleasant and
refreshing taste was obtained, not unlike that of the raisin of
commerce. During our long sojourn at certain camps, which were
frequently in the neighbourhood of the <i>grewia</i> plantations,
we were in the habit of collecting the fruit, and afterwards
pounding them between stones or otherwise. This, when boiled in a
good quantity of water, afforded us a very wholesome and
agreeable beverage, very highly prized by us at our solitary and
weary tropical encampments. This being Whitsunday, and
consequently a festival, we had our promised pudding; the doctor,
on being asked, gave us some sugar, and Turnbull made a bolster
instead of a suet one. To counteract the effect of the heavy
feed, I took a walk with the gun in the expectation of shooting
some partridge-pigeons, which were often seen between the patches
of scrubs, but saw nothing worth powder and shot.</p>
<p>May 24.&mdash;This, the morn of the Queen's birth-day, was
ushered in with the death of poor Norval, our sheep and cattle
dog. This dog was always considered as one of the party, having,
prior to the loss of the sheep and goats, had his allotted duties
to perform, the same as the rest of us. And well and faithfully
he performed his part, when assisting myself and Wommai in
driving the sheep through the long grass and tangled scrubs; many
times, poor fellow, when the sun was shining and the thermometer
standing 120 and 124, in the confined patches of plains
surrounded by <i>brigalowe</i> scrubs, which prevented the
ingress of a breath of wind to assist respiration, have we,
although reluctantly, been compelled to leave him to recover
himself,&mdash;and he has frequently not overtaken us at the camp
until late at night. His services were now no longer needed, and
as there was a chance of our running short of provisions, he was
doomed to 'die the death', by the hands of Dr. Leichhardt, and
Boecking, the cook. An application had been made to the blacks
the previous evening, but they refused to have any hand in
killing Norval, who was a favorite with the party generally.</p>
<p>Soup was to have been made of the green hide of the last
bullock killed, but it was required to make tether ropes, in the
manufacture of which two or three of us were busy the whole of
the forenoon. The Queen's Birth-day was of course observed by so
loyal a subject as Dr. Leichhardt, as another festival, and we
had a repetition of yesterday's pudding. After despatching the
dinner, the doctor arose and proposed the Queen's health, which
we were requested to drink standing. The toast was drunk with as
much loyalty and ardour as could have been expected in cold tea,
without milk or sugar.</p>
<p>May 25.&mdash;We to-day tried the first dish of our new batch
of meat, which proved excellent, considering the rain during the
operation of drying.</p>
<p>The glass this morning at sunrise, was only one degree above
freezing point. This was a dull season for me in the way of
plants, the only ones now in blossom being a handsome species of
<i>acacia</i> and an <i>alstromeria</i>. Wommai was again sent
for the cattle this morning.</p>
<p>May 27.&mdash;The wind this day was very cold, and drove us to
our blankets.</p>
<p>May 28.&mdash;It was fortunate for us we had bagged and put by
the dry meat, as this morning it commenced raining heavily, and
continued the whole day and following night, a regular tropical
soaker, as different from a Scotch mist as is a south-west rain
in Melbourne to a water-spout.</p>
<p>About noon Hely and Brown returned to the camp like drowned
rats, after an absence of nine days, and what was very
remarkable, and by no means satisfactory, they returned on foot,
having lost their horses. They said that after travelling a day
and a half, they were again attacked by fever and ague, which
prevented their looking for the cattle, and was the cause of
their losing the horses they were riding. After in a measure
recovering from their sickness, they returned towards the camp,
and fell in with and drove to within two or three miles of the
camp our horses and mules; at this point they lost them, as well
as the horses they were riding. They had evidently suffered from
the effects of the fever and ague, as well as the fatigue of
walking to the camp. At 6 p.m. the rain was accompanied by heavy
thunder, and continued pouring down all night. Poor Wommai had
now been absent in search of the cattle for three days, and we
began to feel anxious for his safety, not having taken with him a
supply of provisions.</p>
<p>May 28.&mdash;This morning we were a very miserable looking
party indeed, moving with much difficulty. The rains of yesterday
and last night had extinguished our fire, and the wood and chips
being saturated, it was a difficult task to re-kindle it The
party squatting on their heels, taking their miserable breakfast
around the fire, was a picture to behold. Wommai returned to the
camp, but without the cattle, they having bolted from him during
the heavy rains and thunder of the previous night. The poor
fellow was nearly exhausted by exposure to the heavy rains and
want of food, having started, as I before observed, without
taking a supply. We were now in a truly unenviable position,
without horses, mules, cattle, sheep, or goats; so that our only
dependence now was the dried carcase of the last bullock
killed.</p>
<p>May 29.&mdash;Dr. Leichhardt now, with the assistance of
Wommai, undertook to search for the whole, or a portion of the
lost stock; as this was likely to be a work of time, they took
with them a sufficient supply of food to last for four or five
days. Mr. Hely also accompanied them to the place where he and
Brown had deposited the saddles, and from whence he returned
safely with those articles. About eight o'clock, the doctor and
Wommai returned to the camp without any of the cattle or other
stock they went in search of. They had, however, been fortunate
in catching an emu, with the assistance of the dogs. They had
eaten nearly the whole of their game before reaching the camp,
and we had consequently the poor satisfaction of sleeping upon
the expectation of having the remains for our breakfast the next
morning in perspective.</p>
<p>May 30, Sunday.&mdash;This morning, we made an early, and I am
sorry to say, retrograde movement with our remaining mules and
horses in the direction of our former encampment at "Cow-killing
Creek". Independent of the lowness of spirits, consequent on our
travelling in a home direction, the day's stage was tedious over
the plains of Peak Ranges; we passed a few small water holes with
sandstone beds, and camped about five p.m. on what appeared to be
a small creek containing a moderate supply of water, the bed of
the creek, like that of the water holes we had previously passed,
was of sandstone formation. Saw two trees of the very elegant and
beautiful <i>Hakea Lowria</i>, in full blossom, of which I
obtained specimens.</p>
<p>May 31.&mdash;We succeeded in reaching Cow-killing Creek, at
four p.m., where we camped after a very fatiguing journey to the
invalids, some of whom were getting worse. In the course of our
day's stage, we passed one or two clumps of shrubs, where I
obtained seed of an odoriferous species of mangrove
(<i>myaporum</i>, and a specimen of an interesting species of
<i>Tecoma</i>. It was also in one of these patches of scrubs that
Wommai shot a native turkey or bustard, which was very fat and
yielded us an excellent supper. It was cut into steaks and fried
in the pan.</p>
<p>June 1.&mdash;Last evening a cabinet council was held as to
the best means of obtaining our missing stock, and the result of
our deliberations was, that it would be desirable for the doctor
himself, accompanied by Wommai, to again undertake the search. As
this was likely to be a work of time, and as there were again
symptoms amongst us of a return of our former sickness, we
succeeded in rigging up a kind of bower as a protection from the
mid-day sun.</p>
<p>June 2.&mdash;It was evident, from the sinking state of the
sick, that exercise, as recommended by Dr. Leichhardt, proved but
an indifferent substitute for medicine. Dr. Leichhardt and Wommai
yesterday started in search of the cattle, and consequently seven
only were left in the camp. Out of these, six were again laid up,
or, perhaps, laid down would be the most correct manner of
expressing it, with fever and ague. The continued and long
suffering of Mr. Boecking had affected his mind. He was the
strongest and most muscular man in the party, and, in a state of
delirium, he arose from his blanket, reeling like a drunken man,
asking if the pudding was in the pot, and other extraordinary
questions. Mr. Perry, in addition to the fever and ague, suffered
from a violent attack of diarrh&oelig;a at the same time. Our
continued sickness, combined with an absence of medicine, and the
loss of stock, with all the other untoward circumstances, had
driven them to the conclusion that the most prudent course to be
taken, under the circumstances, would be to return while we had
the dried meat and few remaining stores; and although I was, up
to this time, anxious to reach the Swan, I did not consider
myself justified, any longer, in differing from the others in
their decision, as an opposite course now was likely to lead to
an eventual loss of life to many, if not the whole of the
party.</p>
<p>June 3, 4, and 5.&mdash;There was no improvement at the camp.
On the fifth I added myself to the list of invalids.</p>
<p>June 6.&mdash;This morning Mr. Turnbull took a short ride,
and, on his return, with the assistance of the dog Swift,
succeeded in catching a kangaroo. He was only able to bring the
tail with him; but Brown, the black fellow, jumped on the horse,
and, following Turnbull's tracks returned with the body, which
was at once cut into strips, and dried in the same manner as the
beef, as any addition to our stock of provisions was of great
importance, and not to be overlooked.</p>
<p>June 7.&mdash;This morning the doctor and his black companion,
Wommai, returned with only four head of cattle. He appeared to be
much distressed at the apparently helpless state of the party. He
came to me, as I was lying in my blanket, and inquired my opinion
respecting the party and its present prospects. After much
painful conversation, he said he also thought the best step to be
adopted was to go back; and that he would do so as soon as he
could find the missing mules and horses. Only four head of cattle
having been returned to the camp, they were anxious to make off
again to their companions, a double degree of vigilance was
requisite in watching; and for this purpose, the doctor offered,
as an inducement, a two-pound fat cake to those who were willing
to undertake the duty; considering the small quantity now on
hand, this was no common bribe, and it consequently elicited
offers from more than one candidate.</p>
<p>June 8.&mdash;In despite of all our caution in watching, the
cattle contrived to escape again: during the night. Wommai went
in search, and brought them back in the early part of the
day.</p>
<p>June 9.&mdash;The doctor and Wommai went again in quest of the
mules and horses. Having determined upon returning, he did not
intend troubling himself to look for more of the cattle, as he
considered that the four which were at the camp, with the dried
meat in store, would be sufficient to take us back to the
Condamine River, where we should find stations. To secure the
four we already possessed, it was unanimously agreed that the
party at the camp should take watches of two hours each during
the day and night. By some means, however, they again escaped in
the forenoon, during Mr. Turnbull's watch. In the course of his
search, the doctor fell in with some black fellows, who appeared
very shy. They would not allow him to approach. He cut from his
red woollen shirt two buttons, which he put. in a piece of paper,
and placed on the ground. On going to some little distance from
this spot, the black fellows: were observed to approach the
paper, which they picked up, and appeared to be much pleased with
the buttons.</p>
<p>June 10.&mdash;The party were earnestly employed to-day in
rubbing and scraping off the flakes of dirty flour adhering to
the bags. This very questionable-looking material was made into a
kind of dough, which from the quantity of woolly fibres mixed
with it from the bags, had, when cooked, pretty much the
appearance of balls of worsted, far from tempting to a
gourmand.</p>
<p>June 11.&mdash;For the last few nights the weather was
excessively cold, and accompanied by sharp frosts, which froze
the water or cold tea in our pannikins, at no great distance from
the Are, to the thickness of a penny piece.</p>
<p>June 12.&mdash;The doctor not returning, and having again lost
the four head of cattle, we became alarmed at the hole which our
daily consumption was making in our stock of dried beef, which
was intended as our principal supply to take us again to the
haunts of civilized life, a distance of 700 or 800 miles.</p>
<p>June 13.&mdash;The weather fortunately continued fine. By a
very singular and fortunate coincidence, as our horses at the
camp became knocked up, three mules and two horses made their
appearance of their own accord.</p>
<p>June 14.&mdash;A continuation of good luck appeared to be our
present destiny, for as yesterday we were blessed with the return
of some horses and mules, just as they were needed, to-day as Mr.
Mann was strolling on a rising ground at a little distance from
our encampment, he caught sight of our four missing bullocks.
These cattle were now far more wild and unmanageable than before,
and some little care was necessary in heading them round to the
camp, at a part where an angle was formed by the creek taking a
turn. After some consideration, it was deemed the safest plan to
shoot and secure one at least, as there was every probability of
their again bolting. To accomplish this object. Brown, who was an
excellent shot, placed himself behind the butt of a large gum
tree that was growing on the bank of the creek. Turnbull jumped
on a horse and headed the cattle round in the direction of the
tree behind which Brown was ensconced, and from whence he after
some trouble succeeded in shooting one: it was a beautiful shot,
considering that, he was aware in his own mind that our future
subsistence almost depended on his taking a correct aim. He
lodged a rifle bullet just in the centre of the forehead, in the
very spot which stockmen call the star. This beast was in
excellent condition, and we watched his falling with much
anxiety. We were now, comparatively speaking, a happy party. A
supply of meat secured for our return homewards, as well as an
immediate feast of marrow-bones, devilled-bones, and other choice
dainties, such as soup from the head, the tail, the liver and
lights&mdash;to say nothing of the black puddings. The party were
too weak to carry the meat, and it was consequently opened and
skinned, and in that manner left until the following day. We had
all a heavy feed off the fry for supper, and if none of those who
partook of it were visited with an attack of night mare it was a
mercy.</p>
<p>June 15.&mdash;We were all busy in cutting up and hanging out
our meat. We had scarcely half finished our work when the weather
became overcast and cloudy (as was the case generally every
change of the moon), and we began to fear we were to be visited
with a continuation of our usual bad luck. We were too weakhanded
to finish cutting up the beast to-night, and as the weather
looked had we were the less anxious ahout it</p>
<p>June 16.&mdash;This morning broke beautifully, and we
commenced a renewal of our duties of cutting up with redoubled
vigour. After the meat was hung up to dry, Mr. Hely, Mr.
Turnbull, and Brown, expressed a wish to go and look for the
doctor and Wommai, who had been absent eight days. About noon
they started, and as Brown was an excellent bushman and tracker,
we were in hopes they would succeed in their search.</p>
<p>June 17.&mdash;We were this evening agreeably surprised by the
reappearance of Dr. Leichhardt and the faithful and trusty
Wommai. They brought only a part of the mules and horses,
although they had travelled back on our former track a distance
of ninety miles, in fact to the Mackenzie river, where they found
some fine radishes, turnips, and other edible vegetables of my
sowing. This was gratifying news to us, as we expected to find
the same at all our old encampments on our return, where I never
failed to sow seeds, although at the time I had little thought or
expectation of either eating the produce or of seeing the places
again. Mr. Ferry, the saddler, was busy converting the straps of
the pack saddles, which we are compelled to leave behind, into
hobbles for the horses and mules. Indeed, it was at this camp
where the things of which I have formerly written were deposited,
and Dr. Leichhardt intended to call for them on his future
expedition.</p>
<p>June 18.&mdash;This was the anniversary of the Battle of
Waterloo, and was observed as a festival. From this time until
the 21st, Perry, the saddler, was busy in converting the straps
and buckles of the abandoned pack-saddles into hobbles for the
horses and mules.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, we reached the banks of the Mackenzie, and, on
the following morning, we made a start for the bounds of
civilization; and, in order to do so at the earliest possible
moment. Dr. Leichhardt intended making forced and hurried stages.
As we followed upon our outward track, it will be scarcely
necessary for me to give a detail of each day's proceeding. By
the second of July, we had reached the Christmas Ranges, instead
of the Expedition Ranges, owing to the doctor having kept too
westerly a course. On the 3rd, camped at the foot of Expedition
Range, on the bank of a pretty creek, lined with the trailing
branches of the <i>Cucumis mollis</i>, or native melon. There was
a plentiful supply of this fruit; and we grilled, boiled, and ate
a great quantity. Having made rapid stages since leaving the
Mackenzie, the doctor spelled here a day to rest the mules and
horses. It was on the banks of this creek that I discovered
(among others) the new and interesting plant, since dedicated to
Dr. Greeves, <i>Greevesia cleisocalyx</i>, Dr. Leichhardt was
good enough to name a mountain at the head of this romantic creek
after my unworthy self. The doctor gave us some sweet tea, and
the day was finished with that and a dish of boiled melons.</p>
<p>July 5.&mdash;We resumed our travels, and nothing occurred to
interrupt our progress to Charlie's Creek, where we saw; fresh
tracks of cattle. We again camped on its bank, and were on the
eve of going to sleep, when the barking of dogs was heard on the
opposite bank of the Condamine River. This was an intimation of
the close proximity of a station; and visions of damper, mutton,
and other sweetmeats, attended the slumbers of many of the party.
Early the following morning, Dr. Leichhardt crossed the river,
and followed the direction from whence the sounds from the dogs
proceeded. He had not been long absent, when he returned with Mr.
Chauvell and Mr. Ewer. The two gentlemen had followed on our
outward track, and settled upon this part of the Condamine. These
gentlemen expressed pleasure at our safe return, after noticing
the worn-out and haggard appearance presented by the party. We
remained two days at Mr. Chauvell's station, where we were kindly
supplied with every necessary, when we finally started for Jimba
and Darling Downs. Previous to leaving, I exchanged pipes with
Mr. C., receiving a new one for my old black veteran of the
wilderness, and to which Mr. C. appeared to attach considerable
value. Upon reaching Jimba, we were sorry to learn that, during
our absence, its worthy proprietor, Mr. Dennis, had been drowned
during a passage to Sydney by the "Tamar" steamer.</p>
<p>Dr. Leichhardt was now put in full possession of the result of
Sir Thomas Mitchell's expedition, and expressed a wish, before
going to Sydney, to make an excursion in the direction of the
Grafton Range and Fitzroy Downs, newly discovered by Sir Thomas,
in order to connect Sir Thomas's track with his own. Of this
excursion, we shall feel much pleasure in allowing the doctor to
speak for himself.</p>

<h4>DR. LUDWIG LEICHHARDT.</h4>
<hr class="2">
<br>
<blockquote>I started from Mr. Henry Stuart Russell's station on
the 9th of August, 1847, accompanied by Mr F.N. Isaacs, Mr.
Daniel Bunce, Mr. Perry, and Wommai (or Jemmy) the blackfellow.
We followed the dray track to Mr. Gogg's station, at the head of
Acacia Greek, which is a tributary of Dogwood Creek.<br>
<br>
On the 15th we travelled down Acacia Creek about twelve miles
W.N.W., and made Dogwood Creek on the 16th, at my old crossing
place, in latitude 26.24; and continuing for about ten miles N.W.
by W., following a small creek up to its head, and coming to
watercourses belonging to another creek, which I had called
Bottle-Tree Creek on my first expedition. The country was
scrubby, with a few patches of open forest; the latitude of our
camp being 26.20.<br>
<br>
On the 17th we followed the watercourses down to Bottle-Tree
Creek, which was well supplied with water. We crossed it, and
came on a fine rocky creek, with running water, about two miles
W.S.W. from the latter. The intervening country was, however, a
rotten, rusty, gum forest, with occasional patches of Cypress
Pine and Forest Oak. Passed another dry creek in the same course,
and came upon a fine open flat of undulating narrow-leaved
ironbark forest, which seemed to continue to the eastward.
Encamped upon a chain of fine water holes, about twelve miles
W.S.W. from our last camp.<br>
<br>
On the 18th we travelled about twelve and a half miles S.W. Two
and a half miles from our camp we came to a good sized creek,
with the water filtering through the sand and pebbles. In
following it up between hills and ledges of rock, we came upon a
tableland, with patches of shrubby underwood. To the S.W. there
were other creeks and gullies, which compelled us to keep to the
southward, to a more open country. Here the Brigalowe scrub
reappeared, which, with one exception, we had not seen since
quitting the left side of Dogwood Creek.<br>
<br>
Entered upon a box flat, which widened as we followed down its
dry watercourse, in a southerly direction, and even
south-easterly direction; and when the Brigalowe scrub ceased,
and allowed us to travel to the S.W., we passed, for four miles,
down most beautiful open box ridges, well grassed, and perfectly
sound. This open country extended to the S.E., as far as the eye
could reach. In latitude 26.32, we came to a fine creek, with
very large ponds of permanent water, surrounded with reeds, and
with Myall groves growing along its banks.<br>
<br>
The open box forest to the westward of this creek made me believe
that I could proceed in a westerly course, but after a few miles
travelling, we were checked by a scrub, which pushed us to the
S.E. until we came back to the creek we had left. Followed it
down for a few miles, and encamped in latitude 26.39. To the left
the country was still open, but on our right a Brigalowe scrub
approached very nearly the banks of the creek. The water holes,
though well provided with water, were all boggy, and our mules
went without rather than expose themselves to being bogged. The
creek turned to the south east, and E.S.E. In travelling westward
we soon entered into a dense Brigalowe scrub, which continued foi
nine miles, when the country again opened into fine box ridges
and undulations.<br>
<br>
Continued following a small creek, well provided with water
holes, for about five miles to the westward, where it turned to
the south; and having crossed a ridge, we came to another creek
of the same character, running north and south, on which we
camped, in latitude 26.43., having made about thirteen miles
W.S.W. from our last camp. A mile and a half to the westward of
this creek we met another small creek, and four miles farther we
crossed a large creek, with high flood marks, and high box
ridges, particularly on its right bank. I am inclined to believe
that this open box country of the four last mentioned creeks,
extends in an easterly direction, round the scrub we had crossed,
to the first box creek, and in a southerly direction to a large
creek or river, which is formed by the combined Dogwood Creek and
Bottle-Tree Creek. Soon after having crossed the largest of these
creeks, which we called Emu Creek, in consequence of numerous
tracks of emus on the young grass, we entered into a Brigalowe
scrub, which became so dense that, after five miles scrubbing, we
were glad to follow a very winding watercourse to the S.E., which
enlarged into a chain of large deep water holes, which seemed to
be the constant resort of numerous natives, who had constructed
their bark gunyahs at most of them. Having followed it down for
six or seven miles, we encamped in latitude 26.48. This creek
continues for ten miles E.S.E. Before meeting Dogwood Creek it
becomes rocky. The country opens, but the ground is rotten, and
timbered with Cypress Pine, Forest Oak, and Apple Tree, which is
here anything but an indication of a good country. The scrub
continues about two and a half miles above the junction, where we
turned to the westward, and after travelling about three miles,
came to the channel of a large creek, with floodmarks above its
banks. The latter were frequently formed by perpendicular rocks.
The last was sandy and rather boggy, in consequence of the slight
stream of water, which was filtering through the sand. A small
narrow leaved teatree was growing along the water's edge. Cypress
Pine and White Gum forming a tolerably open forest. Encamped on
the right bank of this creek, in latitude 26.55.<br>
<br>
Mr. Bunce and Jemmy, the Blackfellow, who had gone to shoot
ducks, did not return to the camp that night, nor next morning,
and fearing that some accident had happened, I returned to the
Winding Creek, we had left, and encamped. The following morning
the absentees joined us, and explained the cause of their delay,
by having come on the fresh tracks of another party which they
followed, until observing the want of mule tracks they determined
to return to the place where they had left us. They had seen a
great number of natives, amongst whom they recognised a
blackfellow and his gin by a white spot which the "lubra" had on
her neck. These two had visited us in our camp on Charlie's
Creek, when starting for Peak Range, where the latter was known
as the "Piebald". At that time many natives from the Balloone
River passed Charlie's Creek, on the way to the Bunya Bunya
country. We had travelled above the little creek to its junction
with Dogwood Creek, following the latter for one and a half miles
till where the Sandy Creek joined it. Below this junction Dogwood
Creek increases very much in size, and the high flood-marks on
the box trees that cover the flats indicate that large bodies of
water sweep down its channel during the rainy season.<br>
<br>
Continuing our westerly coarse, we left the river, which takes a
turn to the southward, but brigalowe scrub and sandstone gullies
compelled us to south a little, and we encamped on a small
scrubby creek about ten miles W. by S. from Sandy Creek. For the
next eleven miles to the westward, we travelled over a scrubby
Myall country, with patches of open puffy Ironbark forest, and of
Cypress Pine. At this stage we saw a conspicuous hill to the
southward, and came to a river from the northward, with high but
irregular banks, lined with large water Gum Trees. Its bed was
sandy, containing pebbles of fossil wood, broken pieces of agate,
and variously coloured flint and quartz. It was overgrown with
Tea Tree, and was well provided with water-holes. Judging from
its size its course could not be less than 180 miles, and the
presence of the fossil-wood and agate made us believe that it
came from a Downs country. I was inclined to think that it was
Robinson's Creek, which I had crossed in latitude 25.30. About
ninety miles above our present crossing-place the country along
its banks was closely timbered with Box and Box Saplings. Here we
saw the tracks of five horses from the westward, and apparently
coming down the river. Fourteen miles to the westward of this
stream, which we distinguished by the name of Horse-track River,
we came to a large creek, trending to the S.E., the intervening
country being generally scrubby, with occasional patches of open
forest and very puffy. In this puffy ground were clusters of
Cypress Pine, and here we observed burrows of a probably unknown
animal.<br>
<br>
The entrance is a large hole, four or five feet deep, from the
bottom of which the burrow passed horizontally under ground; it
being about a foot and a half in diameter, indicating an animal
of the size of the Beaver. Its tracks resembling those of a child
two or three years old, according to the observations of my
companions; its dung resembling that of the Kangaroo, indicating
a herbiverous animal. The creek was lined with Water-Gum and
Teatree, and was well provided with numerous large reedy
water-holes. My companions called it the "Yahoo River", which
name I adopted to distinguish it from other creeks.<br>
<br>
While sitting round our fire at night we heard a shrill
"pish-sh-sh", the disagreeable call of a night bird, which Wommai
watched and succeeded in shooting. It proved to be a species of
Cyclops.<br>
<br>
Ten miles west of the "Yahoo", we crossed another large creek,
with ample reedy water-holes in its sandy bed, the intervening
country being covered with a nasty Cypress Pine and Dodonea
Scrub, which when seen from the westward appeared like a low
range, the approaches from the east of the creek being fine and
open.<br>
<br>
Continuing our course to the westward for ten miles, over sandy
ridges covered with most wretched Pine Scrub, we came to a large
creek with reedy water holes and sandy bed, which I called
Bunce's Creek; its direction being from N.E. to S.W., the slopes
towards the creek being openly timbered with Box. Beyond it we
descried a low range extending from N. to S., which we crossed in
latitude 26.59. Scarcely two miles to the westward we came on
sandstone ridges covered with Scrub, Dodonea, Cypress Pine, and
Brigalowe, which extended fully ten miles to the westward. Here
another species of Acacia, akin to the Brigalowe, formed a scrub
worse than any we had yet met with. Dead timber made our course
extremely circuitous, and our progress slow, and the way being
overgrown with thick underwood, composed of various interesting
aromatic shrubs, it became dangerous for our horses and mules to
pass through.<br>
<br>
Being tired of an apparently never-ceasing succession of these
Acacia ridges, we followed a water course W. 80 S. for three or
four miles, where we found a good supply of water in a reedy
water-hole. Shortly after camping we had a visit from three
natives who walked boldly towards us after having coo-ed, and
having received our coo-ey in return. Mr. Isaacs and I met them
about fifty yards from our camp, to ascertain if possible whether
we were near the Colgoon, which we expected soon to see. However
they did not understand us, and we parted good friends, we having
presented them with three brass buttons each. No doubt they had
seen white men before. In coming down the little creek we had
seen a fine plain to the eastward, leaving which and travelling
westward, we passed over fine open Box ridges.<br>
<br>
Six miles from the little creek, and about twenty miles west of
Bunce's Creek, we came to a small river with a deep but dry bed,
having some ponds full of water, parallel to it. The country
continuing open for about three miles to the westward, when it
became of a scubby mountainous character. This river was the
Colgoon. We expected it, bat not finding Sir Thomas Mitchell's
track, I supposed I was out in my reckoning, and determined to
push on to the westward till we came upon his track. Journeying
for seven miles over scrubby mountains we were surprised to come
to a large creek, which flowed to the westward, on which we
camped in latitude 27. Following it for about four miles to the
northward, it preserved its mountainous character, and we
consequently left it, continuing our course to the westward.
Continued travelling over a succession of Acacia ridges and
creeks, which turned all to the N.E. and E.N.E. to join the North
Creek. Some of the creeks had patches of very fine Box and Myall
country.<br>
<br>
At that distance we met a water course running S.S.W., which we
followed for about ten miles before coming to water. Our
blackfellow Jemmy heard the neighing of a horse; a gun was fired
immediately, which was answered by the cracking of a stock whip,
and shortly afterwards Mr. Ewer came up, and gave us the
agreeable intelligence that we were near his station. We had seen
numerous cattle tracks several mules before, and were sure that a
station was close at hand.<br>
<br>
On my return to Sydney, Captain Perry kindly furnished me with
the inspection of Sir Thomas Mitchell's charts, maps, &amp;c. I
find that my supposition was correct, as his Fitzroy Downs
commence about ten to fifteen miles above the place where we
crossed the Colgoon. He could not have seen the river Balloone to
the east of his Grafton Range, when he was standing on Mount
Abundance. It was very probably Bunce's creek. I am inclined to
believe that similar patches of good open country exist at the
heads of Bunce's Creek, Frederick's Creek, Yahoo River,
Horsetrack River, and perhaps even Sandy Creek, but I do not
think that they form an uninterrupted belt of Downs above the
scrubs of their lower course. A dray road will be found
practicable in the dry season from Mitchell's track along the
Balloone and Condamine (which is one of its principal heads) to
Mr. Ewer's station and Darling Downs. Should stations be formed
on the heads of the various creeks, the respective roads will
have to follow down the creek, and from the main road along the
Balloone, which will be rendered extremely circuitous and
difficult by numerous gullies, back waters, and deep creeks which
join the river. And such stations would become very isolated in
consequence of the broad belts of scrubby country intervening
between the creeks.<br>
<br>
The natives appear to form powerful tribes along the Balloone and
its numerous lagoons, and would be dangerous enemies along the
scrubs, which would allow a secure retreat from their
aggressions.<br>
<br>
Considering the long and precarious land carriage, and the high
rate of wages&mdash;particularly on stations so remote&mdash;I do
not believe that sheep farming would pay even so far back as the
Horsetrack River. Cattle stations might be formed, perhaps, even
as fur back as the Maranoa, which at camp 80 of Sir Thomas
Mitchell, would be very eligible for that purpose. But the road
from the camp to Maitland will, in all probability, be found
shorter than that to Moreton Bay.<br>
<br>
I shall add a few distances, but I beg to remark that my
distances from Mr. Ewer's station, down the Condamine and the
Balloone, are estimated at straight lines, which in a dray road
might be occasionally doubled. The distance from Brisbane to the
Woolshed is about 160 miles; from the Woolshed to Mr. Ewer's 46
miles; from hence to the B, at the horseshoe bend of the
Condamine, 26 miles; from the B to Sandy River, 27 miles; from
Sandy River to Horsetrack River, 26 to 80 miles; from Horsetrack
River to the Yahoo River, about 12 miles; from the Yahoo River to
Frederick's Creek, and the J. C, about 16 miles; from the Colgoon
up to the Fitzroy Downs, between 40 and 60 miles. The distance
from Brisbane to the junction of the Colgoon with the Balloone,
would be according to this estimate 382 miles; but the dray road
would prove to be at least 400 miles.<br>
<br>
It is to be expected that creeks, corresponding to those from the
westward, will join the Balloone from the south and south-east,
taking their rise from the M'Intyre Ranges; and I have heard that
Mr. O'Connor has succeeded in finding a fine run upon one of
them.<br>
<br>
Should the country of Peak Ranges be settled upon, Sir Thomas
Mitchell's track will no doubt form the road on which stock will
move up to the latitude of that locality, thence turning to the
eastward. My track is too mountainous and scrubby for a dray
road; and I shall very probably choose Ms track on my next
starting for the westward.<br>
<br>
In judging of the country I have seen, I have availed myself
of the experience of Mr. Frederick N. Isaacs, who had such a
large share in the exploration of Darling Downs and its
confines.<br>
<br>
I shall take this opportunity of giving my best thanks to him, to
Mr. Daniel Bunce, and to Mr. Perry, for their kind assistance in
this expedition. I am personally obliged to Mr. Bunce for a fine
collection of seeds and plants which he made, not only on this
occasion, but on my expedition to Peak Range. Mr. Boecking,
another of my companions to Peak Range, though most willing to
accompany me to the Colgoon, had been compelled to return to the
Woolshed from an attack of fever; and I feel bound to recommend
him, as well as Mr. Perry, to any one who should wish to employ
them for their unimpeachable, moral conduct, and unceasing
activity and intelligence.<br>
<br>
In the extract of my letter, published in the Sydney newspapers,
it is stated that Sir Thomas crossed my track at expedition
Range. This is a mistake; he crossed Expedition Range to the
westward of my track.<br>
<br>
I shall here annex a series of observations on the elevations of
various points along the road from Port Stephens to Peak Range.
They are made with the boiling water apparatus, which the Rev.
W.B. Clarke had the kindness to lend me on this
expedition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In travelling from the junction of the Comet River
with the Mackenzie to Peak Range, I followed the Mackenzie up to
one of its heads; and ascertained that the waters which drain
from Peak Range to the south and west, collected into the channel
of that River; those to the north-west and west by south very
probably belong to the system of the Bellyando of Mitchell, or of
my Cape.<br>
<br>
On the upper part of the Mackenzie, which is well watered, we
found some large plains and downs, of the existence of which I
had not been aware. They extend about 60 miles from S.S.E. to
N.N.W., and are frequently from six to eight miles broad. They
are, however, hemmed in by a scrubby country to the west, south,
and east.<br>
<br>
In concluding these remarks, I shall add the agreeable
intelligence that five of the seven mules which I lost at Peak
Range have made their appearance at Darling Downs, after having
travelled six hundred miles by themselves, and have been secured
by the stockman of Mr. Goggs and young Mr. Headly, to whom I feel
deeply obliged for their exertions."</blockquote>

<p>On our return to Darling Downs he thus writes to Wm. Hull,
Esq., J.P., of Melbourne:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><span class="u">My Dear Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Bunce wished me to send his
share of dried plants, collected on our journey to Peak Range and
on the trip to the Maranoo, to your care. As he is himself
inclined to join me again on a new attempt to cross the continent
to the westward, and as Port Phillip was so distant from our
starting points, he determined upon remaining at Darling Downs,
and in the Moreton Bay District, to examine the Bunya Bunya
brushes, and to make, if possible, some collections of plants and
seeds.<br>
<br>
I have to thank you for your Essay on the Aborigines. I was in
the midst of my preparations for starting, and had not time
enough to pay it sufficient attention, but I shall take the first
opportunity of studying it, and should I find that my
observations made on the tribes to the northward should differ,
or should tend to other conclusions, I shall take the liberty of
communicating them to you.<br>
<br>
It is a very interesting fact, that the relationship of language
extends much farther to the northward, along the western waters,
than along the sea coast, and Mr. Bunce will have told you that
he met natives on Charlie's Creek, a tributary of the Condamine
and Balloone, whose language had many words in common with that
of several tribes at Port Phillip, with whom he seems to have had
long intercourse.<br>
<br>
The most interesting, and still most obscure, feature amongst the
tribes to the northward, are the Castes, which seem to be unknown
to the southward. Mr. F.N. Isaacs was either the first, or one of
the first, who discovered their existence among the natives of
Darling Downs, and Captain Macarthur, at Port Essington, told me
of them amongst the Monobar tribes of the Coburgh Peninsula.
These Castes are probably intimately connected with the laws of
intermarriage, which seem to be very general, and by which the
natives effect the proper crossing of blood.<br>
<br>
Mr. Bunce mentioned to me that a young friend of his, a Mr.
Dunbar, would be inclined to join me on my next expedition, and
that he would be a person well adapted for the purpose.<br>
<br>
Mr. Bunce has seen enough of our life in the bush, and of myself,
to judge of the necessary qualifications&mdash;activity, good
humour, and "sound moral principle", elasticity of mind and body,
and perfect willingness to obey my orders; "even if given
harshly,&mdash;are the principal requisites for my
expedition.<br>
<br>
I have been extremely unfortunate in the choice of my former
companions, and you well know that even one "sauve qui peut" is
sufficient to upset a whole army.<br>
<br>
Should you know the young man, I should feel deeply obliged if
you would examine him on these points, and give me a direct
answer about his intentions, shall be most willing to oblige Mr.
Bunce, who seems much attached to Mr. Dunbar.<br>
<br>
Excuse the liberty I take in asking such a favor. The interest
yon have taken in my proceedings of discovery has encouraged me
to do so.<br>

<p>Our readers will perceive, by the tone of the foregoing
particulars, that it was a settled arrangement, as regarded our
again accompanying the unfortunate doctor on the last, and by far
the most unfortunate, expedition; and that, during the completion
of his arrangements in Sydney, we employed ourselves in making
botanical excursions in the neighborhood of Darling Downs, and
especially in the dense brushes of the Moreton Bay, and northerly
ranges of Wide Bay.</p>
<p>When the doctor rejoined us at Darling Downs, we regretted to
discover that he objected to comply with the conditions on which
we undertook to again accompany him. It is needless to enter into
the nature of these conditions. They were such, however, as we
humbly conceived to be of the greatest importance to the success
of the expedition, and to which he readily complied at the time
of his going to Sydney. From his determination not to accede to
our proposals, we did not feel justified in again accompanying
him; and he finally started, with but a small party, in the month
of March, 1848. The following is the last letter he wrote, before
he plunged into the unknown wilderness, from whence no tidings
have since been received of him or his party:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>I take the last opportunity of giving yon an account
of my progress. For eleven days we travelled from Mr. Birrell's
station, on the Condamine, to Mr. Macpherson's, on the Fitzroy
Downs. Though the country was occasionally very difficult, yet
everything went on well. My mules are in excellent order; my
companions in excellent spirits. Three of my cattle are footsore;
but I shall kill one of them to-night, to lay in our necessary
stock of dried beef.<br>
<br>
The Fitzroy Downs, over which we travelled for about twenty-two
miles from east to west, is, indeed, a splendid region; and Sir
Thomas has not exaggerated their beauty in his account. The soil
is pebbly and sound richly grassed, and, to judge from the Myall,
of most fattening quality. I came right on Mount Abundance, and
passed over a gap of it with my whole train, My latitude agreed
well with Mitchell's. I fear that absence of water on Fitzroy
Downs will render this fine country, to a great degree,
unavailable. I observe the thermometer daily, at six a.m. and
p.m., which are the only convenient hours. I have tried the wet
thermometer, but am afraid my observations will be very
deficient. I shall, however, improve on them, as I proceed. The
only serious accident that has happened was the loss of a spade;
but we are fortunate enough to make it up on this station, where
the superintendent is going to spare us one of his.<br>
<br>
Though the days are still very hot, the beautiful clear nights
are cool, and benumb the mosquitoes, which have ceased to trouble
us. Myriads of flies are the only annoyance we have.<br>
<br>
Seeing how much I have been favored in my present progress, I am
full of hopes that our Almighty protector will allow me to bring
my darling scheme to a successful termination.<br>

<br>
<p class="foot">[* The only specimen in Victoria of this truly
elegant tree, may be seen in the garden of Wm. Weire, Esq., the
Town Clerk of Geelong, at Chillwell.]</p>
<p>Before taking our final departure, we made an excursion in the
direction of Wide Bay and Port Curtis, in which we were
accompanied by Mr. Thomas Archer of Dorondoa, and bis black boy,
Jacky Small. Upon this occasion we discovered some fine grazing
country, now taken up and fully occupied. A township called
Yeyndah has been formed on the Burnett River. On again reaching
Darling Downs we received the melancholy intelligence that Mr.
Isaacs, who bad followed and settled upon our track to the
Fitzroy Downs, had been annoyed by the natives, who had rushed
his station, and taken the whole of his sheep; <i>planted</i> his
horses, and killed the hutkeeper and one of the shepherds. A
party of us immediately started to Mr. Isaacs, assistance,
consisting of Messrs. Sheridan, M'Crae, Birrell, myself, and Mr.
John Dangar. Accompanied by three natives from Mr. Birrell's
station, called Terreboo, on Acacia Creek. Their names were Frank
or Brankee, as he pronounced his name, Blucher, Bully, with Mr.
M'Crae's black fellow Billy, from the Castlereigh River, Upon
reaching Mr. I's station, we found that the blacks had absconded
with the sheep several days before, and we lost no time in giving
chace. We overtook them near the Grafton Range; the blacks shewed
fight before allowing us to re-take possession of the sheep. They
had killed and eaten between 2 and 800 during the short time they
remained in their keeping. In the midst of the affray necessary
in capturing the sheep, an extensive group of at least seventy or
eighty naked females presented themselves, and while making signs
by pointing to their breasts, and other symbols to convince us
that they were women and not men, with the view of not being
molested, we were saluted with an occasional spear jerked from
the centre of the group, and Billy, M'Crae's blackfellow,
galloped his horse through the women, and caught the thrower of
the spears in the person of a powerful man, who, from sundry
marks on his person, Mr. Isaacs recognised as the leader of the
party who had attacked his station. As an expiation for his
offence, he was compelled to accompany us back, and mark a line
of trees, thus opening an easy means of approach to the lovely
country of Fitzroy Downs of Sir Thomas Mitchell. Before leaving,
our three Terreboo natives had selected from the group of women
three young girls whom they represented as having been prisoners
taken from their own tribe some time previously. After taking a
friendly farewell of our friends, we commenced our return route
towards Port Phillip. Passing through Darling Downs, M'Intyre
Brook, Liverpool Plains, until reaching M'Crae's station on the
Castlereigh River. In the course of our journey we observed on
the Millee Plains, myriads of pigeons flying in clouds across the
plains. I was informed by the natives that they only made their
appearance every six or seven years. These birds were larger than
the bronze wing,&mdash;plump, of a dark nankeen colour, with a
white spot on either side the head, above the bill and under the
throat; there were also four white spots on each wing, which were
slightly bronzed on the under side. They were called by the
blacks Yammayamamarra. Continuing our journey southward, we
passed through Wellington, Yass, and Bathurst. When at Mr. Hood's
at Boree Cobbon, we inspected the new Molong copper mines lately
opened, and were furnished with some fine specimens of the
various ores. From Boree Cobbon, we continued our journey; we
reached Monera Plains, and from thence continued our course over
the Snowy Mountains, until reaching Gipps Land, where we were
kindly received by Mr. Crook, whose station was known as Holey
Plains. From thence we passed over the Gipps' Land Ranges,
following a track abounding in crab holes, and whose surface
emitted a hollow sound like that of a rotten pumpkin. Having
reached the middle region of the Range, we were agreeably
surprised on meeting a number of the Melbourne natives, who
expressed much pleasure at our return. We had a long chat with
our old aboriginal friends, who gave me a long account of passing
events in Melbourne. Among other things, they informed me that an
Inn had been built and opened at St. Kilda during my absence, by
Mr. J. Howard, and that a vehicle which they described as being
"like a load of hay", and drawn by horses, visited Melbourne
twice a day. This proved to be a large square omnibus, which Mr.
Howard ran between the two places, and was indeed the first
vehicle of the kind started in Victoria. After smoking the "pipe
of peace", we parted from our friends, and reached the base of
the Ranges at Mr. Hooks' Inn, where we caught sight of Mr.
Warman, now of Little Collins-street, who invited us to spend the
night at his house which was close by. Mr. Warman was the leader
of the party who went in search of the white woman, said to be a
captive in the hands of the Snowy River and Gipps' Land natives.
Of the truth of this matter, however, I have some doubts; and
believe the story to have arisen from a person named Pack Bullock
Jack, the overseer of a station belonging to Mr. Terry Hughes,
called Gallanthropy, on the Snowy Mountains; and of which the
following is the version furnished us by the said Jack, at whose
station we remained one night:&mdash;He said that on one occasion
while searching for cattle, he suddenly surprised a number of
blacks who on seeing him took to the Snowy River. Upon jumping
into the water, the hair of one of the women expanded on the
surface like a horse's tail, as he expressed it, and from this
circumstance he concluded that it must have been a white woman.
We are reminded, however, that the space allotted to us is filled
up, or we would willingly have treated less cursorally of the
return journey. We reached St. Kilda after an absence of nearly
three years: After recruiting, we resumed our travels down the
Murray River, which we followed till it joined the sea through
Lake Alexandrina and Encounter Bay,&mdash;having by this means
followed the Great Western system of waters from their upper
sources in the tropics. As a full account of that excursion was
published in the <i>Argus</i>, under the head of "Journal of a
Naturalist", we need not now recapitulate in this work. Shortly
after our return from thence, gold was positively discovered at
Clunes; and we were dispatched as special correspondent for the
<i>Argus</i>, and had thus an opportunity of recording the
working of the first cradle by Messrs. Esmond and Hiscock. We
shall not delay the reader with an account here of the rise and
progress of the gold-fields, as that we conceive to be the duty
of the historian. It is not a little remarkable that as one
gentleman, named Campbell, claimed the authorship of the first
discovery in this district, so with equal justice may another
Campbell (the poet) be accredited with the discovery through the
realms of imagination. In the year, 1843, (nearly ten years
before the real discovery), that celebrated poet thus
writes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poemw">"Untracked in deserts lies the marble mine,<br>
Undug the ore that midst thy rocks shall shine;<br>
Unborn the hands: but born they are to be,<br>
Fair Australasia that shall give to thee<br>
Proud temples, domes, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p>
<p>Upon Mr. Campbell's return to this colony, he kindly presented
me with a handsomely bound copy of his work, entitled the "Grown
Lands of Australia", which Mr. Michie facetiously termed "The
acts of the squatters according to the gospel of St. Campbell;"
as also his pamphlet on "The discovery of Gold", for which he had
received a reward. Touching the disposal of this sum, Mr.
Campbell wrote me the following note, dated 4th March,
1857:&mdash;"On Mr. Campbell's return to the colony, he found
that a sum was awarded to him as the original discoverer, which
he divided amongst those who were with him when he made the
discovery; and his portion he handed over to the hospitals
throughout the country and the gold-fields."</p>
<p>In conclusion the author would refer the reader's attention to
what was the condition of Victoria at the commencement of the
work, and its flourishing character at the present time, 1867;
and would ask is not something due to the original founder of a
country which has afforded an asylum to hundreds of thousands,
and a comparatively princely fortune to many? And we earnestly
conclude with the hope&mdash;most emphatically expressed by a
previous writer on this colony&mdash;that "justice may be done to
<span class="u">Batman</span>" or his <span class=

<p align="center"><em>DR. LEICHHARDT'S EXPEDITION</em>.</p>
<p><span class="a">We</span> are informed that Dr. Leichhardt
arrived at Mr. Russell's station on the Condamine, about a a
fortnight since, and that he intends, as soon as he has recruited
himself, to proceed to the Fitz Roy Downs, in order to ascertain
its exact distance from Darling Downs, and whether there is a
good practicable route for stock, as there appears to be
considerable doubt whether the party alluded to in our paper of
the 30th ultimo, had reached so far in the interior. Mr. Mann and
Mr. Hely arrived in Brisbane on Thursday evening; both are
suffering very severely from the effects of the malady the party
were visited with on the Mackenzie River.</p>
<p>The expedition arrived at the Mackenzie on the 5th March,
having been detained for several days at the Comet River in
consequence of the floods. Two days prior to their arrival,
Perry, the saddler, was taken ill, and was unable to travel
without support. The next day several more of the party fell
sick, and finally all became perfectly helpless from fever and
ague, and continued in that state for three weeks. Some partially
recovered, and were enabled by turns to provide necessaries for
the party, and also to keep the stock tolerably well together;
occasionally milk was procured from the goats, and proved of the
greatest service to the invalids. The floods having at length
gone down, the party crossed the Mackenzie, and remained for
fourteen days on the north bank, where most of them had a
relapse, and underwent severe suffering.</p>
<p>Dr. Leichhardt seeing the helpless condition to which his
party was reduced, determined upon conducting all who were able
to travel to Peak Range, or some elevated land, where he imagined
they would have a better chance of recovery. Messrs. Hely and
Mann were, therefore, left in charge of the bulk of the stores
until the return of the party. Dr. Leichhardt then proceeded up
the river for about thirteen miles, where he encamped; but was
himself compelled to return the following day, in consequence of
some of the bullocks having strayed to the old encampment. It was
then resolved that Messrs. Hely and Mann should accompany him
back, bringing with them the mules and the packs containing the
stores. After remaining at the camp a few days, and the condition
of the party not having undergone any change for the better, the
Doctor resolved upon abandoning the goats, as it was found to be
impossible to attend to them; they were, therefore, allowed to
roam wherever they pleased.</p>
<p>After travelling for three days, the party arrived in a very
exhausted state on the Peak Downs, and encamped on a creek about
forty miles from Peak Range; sickness having prevented their
proceeding further. After staying about a fortnight at this
place, the party proceeded on their journey, leaving Mr. Hely and
Brown to follow on with the cattle[.] The cattle, moreover, had
gone astray, and Mr. Hely and a black went in search of them, but
were compelled to return to the camp for a fresh horse, and
provisions; one of the horses they took with them having strayed.
After being absent eleven days, they brought back nine out of
thirty six head. One of these was killed, but the others again
got away on the following night. Mr. Hely and the black started
on a third trip after them, but were again seized with fever and
ague, lost their horses, and it was with the greatest difficulty
they managed to crawl as far as the camp, after being absent nine
days. The Doctor now volunteered to go in search of the cattle
himself, and took Wommai, the black boy, with him. He returned
after an absence of seven days, bringing with him four head,
which he had with great difficulty recovered. Meanwhile, the
party at the camp found no alleviation of suffering, and were
quite incapable of exertion.</p>
<p>On the day of his return the Doctor went round and examined
the invalids, the result of which was that he declared it
impossible to proceed further with the expedition, and announced
his intention of returning to Darling Downs without delay, to
recruit himself, and form a fresh party.</p>
<p>At this time Dr. Leichhardt, and Wommai, the black, were the
only persons in the camp who could assist in doing what was
necessary for the support of life. After remaining one day at the
camp, he left the place with the intention of recovering the
mules, as he had observed their tracks a few days previous.
Shortly after his departure, the remaining bullocks got away, and
could not be found for four days, when luckily they were observed
on a ridge at some distance from the camp. One of the party
immediately went in pursuit, and brought them in. They then
deemed it prudent to shoot one of the animals, which was done,
and the meat was cut into strips and dried. This was a work of
the greatest labour and difficulty, owing to the extreme weakness
to which they were all reduced.</p>
<p>As the Doctor did not return so soon as was expected, Mr.
Hely, Mr. Turnbull, and Brown, the black boy, determined to go in
search of him, and started on the sixth morning of his absence.
They rode about ten miles on the Doctor's tracks, when Brown was
taken so unwell that he was unable to proceed further, and the
other two were compelled to remain with him. On the eighth day
Dr. Leichhardt appeared, and found the party lying down. After
staying with them a short time, he returned to the camp, and on
mustering the horses and mules, it was ascertained that eleven
were missing.</p>
<p>The party having been got together, then commenced their
journey homeward, leaving behind them several pack saddles, a
quantity of salt, tea, shot, and other articles, which were not
needed, and which might have encumbered them on their route. They
reached Mr. Bligh's station, on the Condamine, on the 21st
ultimo, in a most miserable plight, and suffering dreadfully from
sickness.</p>
<p>The party speak in glowing terms of the kindness and
hospitality they experienced from Mr. Bligh, and indeed from all
the squatters whose stations they visited on their return to the
Downs.</p>

<p align="center">LEICHHARDT'S EXPEDITION.<br>
<br>
(Extract of a letter from Dr. Leichhardt.)</p>
<p align="right">Russel's Station, Darling Downs,<br>
<br>
1st August, 1847.</p>
<p>The news of my return to the Downs will no doubt have reached
you by the last steamer from Moreton Bay. I had hoped to go by
her to Sydney, and that expectation, added to a very severe
rheumatism in my hands, prevented my writing by her. I wrote to
you last from Charley's Creek, mentioning the loss and recovery
of my mules, horses, and cattle. I had despatched Mr. Hely in
quest of intelligence of Sir T. Mitchell's expedition, of whose
return I had been informed, but by some accident of the post,
neither your letters nor Sir Thomas's despatches ever reached me.
Mr. Hely, Mr. Turnbull, and Brown joined me forty miles farther
on my journey, and we travelled quietly without accident down the
Dawson, then running so strong as to compel us to take advantage
of a large tree which had fallen across it, to convey our baggage
over. At Ruined Castle Creek I left one of my horses which had
become hopelessly lame. At Expedition Range, the rains set in,
and the ground soon became so boggy that our mules sank to their
bellies, and we made but slow progress. All the water-courses and
creeks between Expedition and Christmas Ranges became flooded,
and compelled us to make a long roundabout to head them.</p>
<p>Deception Creek and Comet Creek were swollen into immense
rivers, and all the surrounding country was inundated. I had
feared the Mackenzie would stop us, and on our arrival at that
river, after seven weeks' travelling from Dried-beef Creek, my
fears were but too fully realised, There had been several cases
of illness as we travelled through the scrub, but here the whole
party were attacked by fever, which subsequently assumed the
character of fever and ague. I suffered from it for nine days,
and it left me very weak for a long while after. We had to wait
for three weeks before the river was fordable, and after getting
over the party were so exhausted by illness, we found ourselves
wholly unable to proceed, and had to remain for three weeks
longer to recover our strength; no doubt the disease was very
depressing, though not of that dangerous character which the
party apprehended, most of whom had hitherto been unacquainted
with illness of any kind. Our energy, however, was much broken,
and our bodily strength entirely prostrated for the time. From
the idea that change of place and slight exertion would operate
beneficially on our health, I resolved to move on with the
strongest of the party, and accordingly proceeded with the stock
towards Peak Range, which I knew to be only sixty miles from the
junction of the Comet and Mackenzie rivers. After the first
stage, however, our helplessness became so apparent, that I saw
the impracticability of dividing our party, and returned with my
healthy black (poor Brown was quite knocked up), and brought in
the remainder of the party with all our luggage, to my halting
ground. Here our goats and sheep strayed away from the camp. No
one was able to watch them, and we were at length compelled to
leave them behind.</p>
<p>After a rest of three days we again moved on for three days
more, making about thirty miles in all, and reached the Downs of
the Upper Mackenzie and Peak Range. Here the loss of the horses
compelling us to stop, and as we had no more sheep, we killed the
first head of cattle. I had some hope that the change of diet,
from fat mutton to dried beef, might operate favourably on our
health, but in this also I was disappointed, as the rain set in
as the meat was drying, and it consequently become tainted and
unpalatable. After having stopped here for nearly a fortnight, we
again advanced about ten miles farther. The black whom I had sent
for the cattle, mistook our track and passed us when he had found
them, and after watching them, left them during the night to
rejoin us. During the interval they strayed away. I again sent
two of the party in pursuit, namely, Mr. Hely and Brown, and
moved on my camp towards Peak Range. Unfortunately, Brown lost
his horse the first night, and they were compelled to return to
us for fresh horses and provisions, without having found the
cattle. Thus the cattle got a long way in advance, became
dispersed in the scrub, and frightened probably by the natives,
became so wild that when Mr. Hely and the blacks again approached
them, they were so wild, they only succeeded in bringing back
nine out of thirty-seven, after a fortnight's absence from the
camp, Here we killed another bullock and dried the meat, and
endeavoured by using great vigilance to retain the others. But in
spite of all our efforts the wild brutes broke away every night,
and in five days we lost them altogether. Mr. Hely and Brown had
again started in pursuit of the others, but after an absence of
ten days, during which they had been overtaken by sickness, they
returned unsuccessful. Nothing now was left but to go myself upon
this errand, and accordingly I went with Jemmy, the black, to
that part of our track which I thought they were most likely to
have retreated to, and after a week's anxious search, I came upon
four, which I brought back to camp, where I found all my
companions ill with fever, and the mules and horses gone.</p>
<p>I now saw the thorough helplessness of our position, that all
further endeavour was vain, and that we had nothing for it but a
speedy return. I cannot express to you the extreme agony of mind
I endured when this distressing conviction came upon me.</p>
<p>I immediately set about collecting the mules and horses,
leaving the cattle in charge of the party. The mules had
separated, which they had not done since leaving Charley's Creek.
I followed six of them for ninety miles on our track towards
Expedition Range, but could not overtake them, and was compelled
to return to Camp, with seven others. On my arrival I found, as
indeed I had anticipated, that my companions had not been able to
retain the Cattle, which had gone off the morning after I left.
They had, however, again secured them, and had killed one and
dried the meat, which was of the greatest advantage to us. They
had also recovered three horses and three mules, which thus
increased our stock to ten horses and nine mules.</p>
<p>Leaving our tea, salt, shot, and other baggage behind, we
started on our road home, and after travelling thirty days
without any interruption we reached the camp of Messrs. Blyth and
Che[au]vel, on the Condamine, on the 21st July, and on the 28th
the station of Mr. H. S. Russel, on Darling Downs, where I
propose to leave my things till a new party is organized, which I
hope will be about the beginning of next May.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the many unforeseen hardships we endured, my
party behaved extremely well.</p>
<p>I am indeed sadly vexed by this disappointment: I find I have
lost a year of my life in effecting nothing, and have been
obliged to turn back from the very point at which I had proposed
to strike to the westward. At the Downs I read the account of Sir
T. Mitchell's discoveries. I find he has crossed, my track at
Expedition Range, but farther to the westward than I did; his
Mudge-kye is the most distant of my Christmas Range, his Mantuan
Downs are my Albinia Downs; his Nogoa is my Comet River, though I
did not go so far up as to see the junction of the Salvator and
the Claude; and I am afraid that as his Belyando turns out to be
the Cape, his Victoria will turn out to be the Clarke, the
largest tributary of the Burdekin from the westward.</p>
<p>I am desirous to examine the country between my track and Fitz
Roy Downs, which I shall do as soon as my rheumatism will allow
me, for at present I am laid up with it.</p>
