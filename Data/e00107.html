  <h2 align="center"><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction &mdash; <b>The Shearers</b></h2>
  <p>No&nbsp;church-bell rings them from the Track,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No pulpit lights their blindness&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis hardship, drought and homelessness<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That teach those Bushmen kindness:<br>
    The mateship born of barren lands,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of toil and thirst and danger&mdash;<br>
    The camp-fare for the stranger set,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first place to the stranger.</p>
  <p>They do the best they can to-day&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take no thought of the morrow;<br>
    Their way is not the old-world way&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They live to lend and borrow.<br>
    When shearing&rsquo;s done and cheques gone wrong,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They call it &lsquo;time to slither&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
    They saddle up and say &lsquo;So-long!&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ride&mdash;the Lord knows whither.</p>
  <p>And though he may be brown or black,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wrong man there or right man,<br>
    The mate that&rsquo;s honest to his mates<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They call that man a &lsquo;white man&rsquo;!<br>
    They tramp in mateship side by side&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protestant and &lsquo;Roman&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
    They call no biped lord or &lsquo;sir,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touch their hats to no man!</p>
  <p>They carry in their swags, perhaps,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portrait and a letter&mdash;<br>
    And, maybe, deep down in their hearts,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hope of &lsquo;something better.&rsquo;<br>
    Where lonely miles are long to ride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all days seem recurrent,<br>
    There&rsquo;s lots of time to think of men<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might have been&mdash;but weren&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>They turn their faces to the west<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave the world behind them&mdash;<br>
    (Their drought-dried graves are seldom green<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where even mates can find them).<br>
    They know too little of the world<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rise to wealth or greatness:<br>
    But in this book of mine I pay<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My tribute to their straightness.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SendRoundtheHat"></a>Send Round the Hat</b></h2>
  <p class="note">Now this is the creed from the Book of the Bush&mdash;<br>
    Should be simple and plain to a dunce:<br>
  &ldquo;If a man&rsquo;s in a hole you must pass round the hat&mdash;<br>
Were he jail-bird or gentleman once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is&nbsp;it any harm to wake yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was about nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and, though it was Sunday
    morning, it was no harm to wake me; but the shearer had mistaken me for a
    deaf jackeroo, who was staying at the shanty and was something like me, and
    had good-naturedly shouted almost at the top of his voice, and he woke the
    whole shanty. Anyway he woke three or four others who were sleeping on beds
    and stretchers, and one on a shake-down on the floor, in the same room. It
    had been a wet night, and the shanty was full of shearers from Big Billabong
    Shed which had cut out the day before. My room mates had been drinking and
    gambling overnight, and they swore luridly at the intruder for disturbing
    them.</p>
  <p>He was six-foot-three or thereabout. He was loosely built, bony, sandy-complexioned
    and grey eyed. He wore a good-humoured grin at most times, as I noticed later
    on; he was of a type of bushman that I always liked&mdash;the sort that seem
    to get more good-natured the longer they grow, yet are hardknuckled and would
    accommodate a man who wanted to fight, or thrash a bully in a good-natured
    way. The sort that like to carry somebody&rsquo;s baby round, and cut wood,
    carry water and do little things for overworked married bushwomen. He wore
    a saddle-tweed sac suit two sizes too small for him, and his face, neck,
    great hands and bony wrists were covered with sunblotches and freckles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope I ain&rsquo;t disturbin&rsquo; yer,&rdquo; he shouted, as
    he bent over my bunk, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a cove&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t shout!&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
    deaf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
    know I was yellin&rsquo;. I thought you was the deaf feller.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
    trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait till them other chaps is done swearin&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ll
    tell yer,&rdquo;  he said. He spoke with a quiet, good-natured drawl, with
    something of the nasal twang, but tone and drawl distinctly Australian&mdash;altogether
    apart from that of the Americans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, spit it out for Christ&rsquo;s sake, Long&rsquo;un!&rdquo; yelled
    One-eyed Bogan, who had been the worst swearer in a rough shed, and he fell
    back on his bunk as if his previous remarks had exhausted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that there sick jackeroo that was pickin&rsquo;-up at
    Big Billabong,&rdquo; said the Giraffe. &ldquo;He had to knock off the first
    week, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s been here ever since. They&rsquo;re sendin&rsquo; him
    away to the hospital in Sydney by the speeshall train. They&rsquo;re just
    goin&rsquo; to take him up in the wagonette to the railway station, an&rsquo; I
    thought I might as well go round with the hat an&rsquo; get him a few bob.
    He&rsquo;s got a missus and kids in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yer always goin&rsquo; round with yer gory hat!&rdquo; growled Bogan. &ldquo;Yer&rsquo;d
    blanky well take it round in hell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s doing, Bogan,&rdquo; muttered Gentleman
    Once, on the shake-down, with his face to the wall.</p>
  <p>The hat was a genuine &ldquo;cabbage-tree,&rdquo; one of the sort that &ldquo;last
    a lifetime.&rdquo; It was well coloured, almost black in fact with weather
    and age, and it had a new strap round the base of the crown. I looked into
    it and saw a dirty pound note and some silver. I dropped in half a crown,
    which was more than I could spare, for I had only been a green-hand at Big
    Billabong.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank yer!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now then, you fellers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d keep your hat on your head, and your money in
    your pockets and your sympathy somewhere else,&rdquo; growled Jack Moonlight
    as he raised himself painfully on his elbow and felt under his pillow for
    two half-crowns.  &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s two half-carers.
    Chuck &rsquo;em in and let me sleep for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gentleman Once, the gambler, rolled round on his shakedown, bringing his
    good-looking, dissipated face from the wall. He had turned in in his clothes
    and, with considerable exertion he shoved his hand down into the pocket of
    his trousers, which were a tight fit. He brought up a roll of pound notes
    and could find no silver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said to the Giraffe, &ldquo;I might as well lay a
    quid. I&rsquo;ll chance it anyhow. Chuck it in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got rats this mornin&rsquo;, Gentleman Once,&rdquo; growled
    the Bogan.  &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a blanky horse race.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I have,&rdquo; said Gentleman Once, and he turned
    to the wall again with his head on his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Bogan, yer might as well chuck in somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
    the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the jackeroo?&rdquo; asked the Bogan,
    tugging his trousers from under the mattress.</p>
  <p>Moonlight said something in a low tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The &mdash;&mdash; he has!&rdquo; said Bogan. &ldquo;Well, I pity
    the &mdash;&mdash;! Here, I&rsquo;ll chuck in half a &mdash;&mdash; quid!&rdquo; and
    he dropped half a sovereign into the hat.</p>
  <p>The fourth man, who was known to his face as &ldquo;BarcooRot,&rdquo; and
    behind his back as &ldquo;The Mean Man,&rdquo; had been drinking all night,
    and not even Bogan&rsquo;s stump-splitting adjectives could rouse him. So
    Bogan got out of bed, and calling on us (as blanky female cattle) to witness
    what he was about to do, he rolled the drunkard over, prospected his pockets
    till he made up five shillings (or a &ldquo;caser&rdquo; in bush language),
    and &ldquo;chucked&rdquo; them into the hat.</p>
  <p>And Barcoo-Rot is probably unconscious to this day that he was ever connected
    with an act of charity.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe struck the deaf jackeroo in the next room. I heard the chaps
    cursing &ldquo;Long-&rsquo;un&rdquo; for waking them, and &ldquo;Deaf-&rsquo;un&rdquo; for
    being, as they thought at first, the indirect cause of the disturbance. I
    heard the Giraffe and his hat being condemned in other rooms and cursed along
    the veranda where more shearers were sleeping; and after a while I turned
    out.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe was carefully fixing a mattress and pillows on the floor of
    a wagonette, and presently a man, who looked like a corpse, was carried out
    and lifted into the trap.</p>
  <p>As the wagonette started, the shanty-keeper&mdash;a fat, soulless-looking
    man&mdash;put his hand in his pocket and dropped a quid into the hat which
    was still going round, in the hands of the Giraffe&rsquo;s mate, little Teddy
    Thompson, who was as far below medium height as the Giraffe was above it.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe took the horse&rsquo;s head and led him along on the most level
    parts of the road towards the railway station, and two or three chaps went
    along to help get the sick man into the train.</p>
  <p>The shearing-season was over in that district, but I got a job of house-painting,
    which was my trade, at the Great Western Hotel (a two-story brick place),
    and I stayed in Bourke for a couple of months.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Giraffe was a Victorian native from Bendigo. He was well known in Bourke
    and to many shearers who came through the great dry scrubs from hundreds
    of miles round. He was stakeholder, drunkard&rsquo;s banker, peacemaker where
    possible, referee or second to oblige the chaps when a fight was on, big
    brother or uncle to most of the children in town, final court of appeal when
    the youngsters had a dispute over a foot-race at the school picnic, referee
    at their fights, and he was the stranger&rsquo;s friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The feller as knows can battle around for himself,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d
    say.  &ldquo;But I always like to do what I can for a hard-up stranger cove.
    I was a green-hand jackeroo once meself, and I know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always bothering about other people, Giraffe,&rdquo; said
    Tom Hall, the shearers&rsquo; union secretary, who was only a couple of inches
    shorter than the Giraffe. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in it, you can take
    it from me&mdash;I ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s a feller to do?&rdquo; said the Giraffe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    only hangin&rsquo;  round here till shearin&rsquo; starts agen, an&rsquo; a
    cove might as well be doin&rsquo;  something. Besides, it ain&rsquo;t as
    if I was like a cove that had old people or a wife an&rsquo; kids to look
    after. I ain&rsquo;t got no responsibilities. A feller can&rsquo;t be doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;.
    Besides, I like to lend a helpin&rsquo; hand when I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, all I&rsquo;ve got to say,&rdquo; said Tom, most of whose screw
    went in borrowed quids, etc. &ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve got to say is that you&rsquo;ll
    get no thanks, and you might blanky well starve in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no fear of me starvin&rsquo; so long as I&rsquo;ve
    got me hands about me; an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t a cove as wants thanks,&rdquo; said
    the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>He was always helping some-one or something. Now it was a bit of a  &ldquo;darnce&rdquo; that
    we was gettin&rsquo; up for the girls; again it was Mrs Smith, the woman
    whose husban&rsquo; was drowned in the flood in the Bogan River lars&rsquo; Crismas,
    or that there poor woman down by the Billabong&mdash;her husband cleared
    out and left her with a lot o&rsquo; kids. Or Bill Something, the bullocky,
    who was run over by his own wagon, while he was drunk, and got his leg broke.</p>
  <p>Toward the end of his spree One-eyed Bogan broke loose and smashed nearly
    all the windows of the Carriers&rsquo; Arms, and next morning he was fined
    heavily at the police court. About dinner-time I encountered the Giraffe
    and his hat, with two half-crowns in it for a start.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to trouble yer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but One-eyed
    Bogan carn&rsquo;t pay his fine, an&rsquo; I thought we might fix it up for
    him. He ain&rsquo;t half a bad sort of feller when he ain&rsquo;t drinkin&rsquo;.
    It&rsquo;s only when he gets too much booze in him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After shearing, the hat usually started round with the Giraffe&rsquo;s own
    dirty crumpled pound note in the bottom of it as a send-off, later on it
    was half a sovereign, and so on down to half a crown and a shilling, as he
    got short of stuff; till in the end he would borrow a &ldquo;few bob&rdquo;&mdash;which
    he always repaid after next shearing&mdash;&ldquo;just to start the thing
    goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were several yarns about him and his hat. &rsquo;Twas said that the
    hat had belonged to his father, whom he resembled in every respect, and it
    had been going round for so many years that the crown was worn as thin as
    paper by the quids, halfquids, casers, half-casers, bobs and tanners or sprats&mdash;to
    say nothing of the scrums&mdash;that had been chucked into it in its time
    and shaken up.</p>
  <p>They say that when a new governor visited Bourke the Giraffe happened to
    be standing on the platform close to the exit, grinning good-humouredly,
    and the local toady nudged him urgently and said in an awful whisper, &ldquo;Take
    off your hat! Why don&rsquo;t you take off your hat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; drawled the Giraffe, &ldquo;he ain&rsquo;t hard up, is
    he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And they fondly cherish an anecdote to the effect that, when the One-Man-One-Vote
    Bill was passed (or Payment of Members, or when the first Labour Party went
    in&mdash;I forget on which occasion they said it was) the Giraffe was carried
    away by the general enthusiasm, got a few beers in him, &ldquo;chucked&rdquo; a
    quid into his hat, and sent it round. The boys contributed by force of habit,
    and contributed largely, because of the victory and the beer. And when the
    hat came back to the Giraffe, he stood holding it in front of him with both
    hands and stared blankly into it for a while. Then it dawned on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blowed if I haven&rsquo;t bin an&rsquo; gone an&rsquo; took up a
    bloomin&rsquo; collection for meself!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>He was almost a teetotaller, but he stood his shout in reason. He mostly
    drank ginger beer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a feller that boozes, but I ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; agen
    chaps enjoyin&rsquo; themselves, so long as they don&rsquo;t go too far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was common for a man on the spree to say to him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here! here&rsquo;s five quid. Look after it for me, Giraffe, will
    yer, till I git off the booze.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His real name was Bob Brothers, and his bush names, &ldquo;Long-&rsquo;un,&rdquo;  &ldquo;The
    Giraffe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Send-round-the-hat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chuck-in-a-bob,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ginger-ale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some years before, camels and Afghan drivers had been imported to the Bourke
    district; the camels did very well in the dry country, they went right across
    country and carried everythink from sardines to flooring-boards. And the
    teamsters loved the Afghans nearly as much as Sydney furniture makers love
    the cheap Chinese in the same line. They love &rsquo;em even as union shearers
    on strike love blacklegs brought up-country to take their places.</p>
  <p>Now the Giraffe was a good, straight unionist, but in cases of sickness
    or trouble he was as apt to forget his unionism, as all bushmen are, at all
    times (and for all time), to forget their creed. So, one evening, the Giraffe
    blundered into the Carriers&rsquo; Arms&mdash;of all places in the world&mdash;when
    it was full of teamsters; he had his hat in his hand and some small silver
    and coppers in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, you fellers, there&rsquo;s a poor, sick Afghan in the camp
    down there along the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A big, brawny bullock-driver took him firmly by the shoulders, or, rather
    by the elbows, and ran him out before any damage was done. The Giraffe took
    it as he took most things, good-humouredly; but, about dusk, he was seen
    slipping down towards the Afghan camp with a billy of soup.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; remarked Tom Hall, &ldquo;that when the Giraffe
    goes to heaven&mdash;and he&rsquo;s the only one of us, as far as I can see,
    that has a ghost of a show&mdash;I believe that when he goes to heaven, the
    first thing he&rsquo;ll do will be to take his infernal hat round amongst
    the angels&mdash;getting up a collection for this damned world that he left
    behind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s so much to his credit, after
    all,&rdquo;  said Jack Mitchell, shearer. &ldquo;You see, the Giraffe is
    ambitious; he likes public life, and that accounts for him shoving himself
    forward with his collections. As for bothering about people in trouble, that&rsquo;s
    only common curiosity; he&rsquo;s one of those chaps that are always shoving
    their noses into other people&rsquo;s troubles. And, as for looking after
    sick men&mdash;why! there&rsquo;s nothing the Giraffe likes better than pottering
    round a sick man, and watching him and studying him. He&rsquo;s awfully interested
    in sick men, and they&rsquo;re pretty scarce out here. I tell you there&rsquo;s
    nothing he likes better&mdash;except, maybe, it&rsquo;s pottering round a
    corpse. I believe he&rsquo;d ride forty miles to help and sympathize and
    potter round a funeral. The fact of the matter is that the Giraffe is only
    enjoying himself with other people&rsquo;s troubles&mdash;that&rsquo;s all
    it is. It&rsquo;s only vulgar curiosity and selfishness. I set it down to
    his ignorance; the way he was brought up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few days after the Afghan incident the Giraffe and his hat had a run of
    luck. A German, one of a party who were building a new wooden bridge over
    the Big Billabong, was helping unload some girders from a truck at the railway
    station, when a big log slipped on the skids and his leg was smashed badly.
    They carried him to the Carriers&rsquo; Arms, which was the nearest hotel,
    and into a bedroom behind the bar, and sent for the doctor. The Giraffe was
    in evidence as usual.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It vas not that at all,&rdquo; said German Charlie, when they asked
    him if he was in much pain. &ldquo;It vas not that at all. I don&rsquo;t
    cares a damn for der bain; but dis is der tird year&mdash;und I vas going
    home dis year&mdash;after der gontract&mdash;und der gontract yoost commence!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was the burden of his song all through, between his groans.</p>
  <p>There were a good few chaps sitting quietly about the bar and veranda when
    the doctor arrived. The Giraffe was sitting at the end of the counter, on
    which he had laid his hat while he wiped his face, neck, and forehead with
    a big speckled &ldquo;sweatrag.&rdquo; It was a very hot day.</p>
  <p>The doctor, a good-hearted young Australian, was heard saying something.
    Then German Charlie, in a voice that rung with pain:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make that leg right, doctor&mdash;quick! Dis is der tird pluddy year&mdash;und
    I must go home!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor asked him if he was in great pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neffer mind der pluddy bain, doctor! Neffer mind der pluddy bain!
    Dot vas nossing. Make dat leg well quick, doctor. Dis vas der last gontract,
    and I vas going home dis year.&rdquo; Then the words jerked out of him by
    physical agony: &ldquo;Der girl vas vaiting dree year, und&mdash;by Got!
    I must go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The publican&mdash;Watty Braithwaite, known as &ldquo;Watty Broadweight,&rdquo; or,
    more familiarly, &ldquo;Watty Bothways&rdquo;&mdash;turned over the Giraffe&rsquo;s
    hat in a tired, bored sort of way, dropped a quid into it, and nodded resignedly
    at the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe caught up the hint and the hat with alacrity. The hat went all
    round town, so to speak; and, as soon as his leg was firm enough not to come
    loose on the road German Charlie went home.</p>
  <p>It was well known that I contributed to the Sydney&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>&nbsp;and
    several other papers. The Giraffe&rsquo;s bump of reverence was very large,
    and swelled especially for sick men and poets. He treated me with much more
    respect than is due from a bushman to a man, and with an odd sort of extra
    gentleness I sometimes fancied. But one day he rather surprised me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to trouble yer,&rdquo; he said in a shamefaced way. &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t know as you go in for sportin&rsquo;, but One-eyed Bogan an&rsquo; Barcoo-Rot
    is goin&rsquo; to have a bit of a scrap down the Billybong this evenin&rsquo;,
    an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bit of a what?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bit of fight to a finish,&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;An&rsquo; the
    chaps is tryin&rsquo; to fix up a fiver to put some life into the thing.
    There&rsquo;s bad blood between One-eyed Bogan and BarcooRot, an&rsquo; it
    won&rsquo;t do them any harm to have it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a great fight, I remember. There must have been a couple of score
    blood-soaked handkerchiefs (or &ldquo;sweat-rags&rdquo;) buried in a hole
    on the field of battle, and the Giraffe was busy the rest of the evening
    helping to patch up the principals. Later on he took up a small collection
    for the loser, who happened to be Barcoo-Rot in spite of the advantage of
    an eye.</p>
  <p>The Salvation Army lassie, who went round with the War Cry, nearly always
    sold the Giraffe three copies.</p>
  <p>A new-chum parson, who wanted a subscription to build or enlarge a chapel,
    or something, sought the assistance of the Giraffe&rsquo;s influence with
    his mates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Giraffe, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a churchgoer
    meself. I ain&rsquo;t what you might call a religious cove, but I&rsquo;ll
    be glad to do what I can to help yer. I don&rsquo;t suppose I can do much.
    I ain&rsquo;t been to church since I was a kiddy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The parson was shocked, but later on he learned to appreciate the Giraffe
    and his mates, and to love Australia for the bushman&rsquo;s sake, and it
    was he who told me the above anecdote.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe helped fix some stalls for a Catholic Church bazaar, and some
    of the chaps chaffed him about it in the union office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be taking up a collection for a joss-house down in the
    Chinamen&rsquo;s camp next,&rdquo; said Tom Hall in conclusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; agen the Roming Carflics,&rdquo; said
    the Giraffe. &ldquo;An&rsquo; Father O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s a very decent
    sort of cove. He stuck up for the unions all right in the strike anyway.&rdquo; (&ldquo;He
    wouldn&rsquo;t be Irish if he wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; someone commented.) &ldquo;I
    carried swags once for six months with a feller that was a Carflick, an&rsquo; he
    was a very straight feller. And a girl I knowed turned Carflick to marry
    a chap that had got her into trouble, an&rsquo; she was always jes&rsquo;  the
    same to me after as she was before. Besides, I like to help everything that&rsquo;s
    goin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hall and one or two others went out hurriedly to have a drink. But we
    all loved the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>He was very innocent and very humorous, especially when he meant to be most
    serious and philosophical.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of them bush girls is regular tomboys,&rdquo; he said to me
    solemnly one day. &ldquo;Some of them is too cheeky altogether. I remember
    once I was stoppin&rsquo; at a place&mdash;they was sort of relations o&rsquo; mine&mdash;an&rsquo; they
    put me to sleep in a room off the verander, where there was a glass door
    an&rsquo; no blinds. An&rsquo; the first mornin&rsquo; the girls&mdash;they
    was sort o&rsquo; cousins o&rsquo; mine&mdash;they come gigglin&rsquo; and
    foolin&rsquo; round outside the door on the verander, an&rsquo; kep&rsquo; me
    in bed till nearly ten o&rsquo;clock. I had to put me trowsis on under the
    bed-clothes in the end. But I got back on &rsquo;em the next night,&rdquo; he
    reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did you do that, Bob?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I went to bed in me trowsis!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One day I was on a plank, painting the ceiling of the bar of the Great Western
    Hotel. I was anxious to get the job finished. The work had been kept back
    most of the day by chaps handing up long beers to me, and drawing my attention
    to the alleged fact that I was putting on the paint wrong side out. I was
    slapping it on over the last few boards when:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to trouble yer; I always seem to be troublin&rsquo;  yer;
    but there&rsquo;s that there woman and them girls&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked down&mdash;about the first time I had looked down on him&mdash;and
    there was the Giraffe, with his hat brim up on the plank and two half-crowns
    in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Bob,&rdquo; I said, and I dropped in
    half a crown.</p>
  <p>There were shearers in the bar, and presently there was some barracking.
    It appeared that that there woman and them girls were strange women, in the
    local as well as the Biblical sense of the word, who had come from Sydney
    at the end of the shearing-season, and had taken a cottage on the edge of
    the scrub on the outskirts of the town. There had been trouble this week
    in connection with a row at their establishment, and they had been fined,
    warned off by the police, and turned out by their landlord.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is a bit too red-hot, Giraffe,&rdquo; said one of the shearers.  &ldquo;Them &mdash;&mdash;s
    has made enough out of us coves. They&rsquo;ve got plenty of stuff, don&rsquo;t
    you fret. Let &rsquo;em go to &mdash;&mdash;! I&rsquo;m blanked if I give
    a sprat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t got their fares to Sydney,&rdquo; said the Giraffe. &ldquo;An&rsquo;,
    what&rsquo;s more, the little &rsquo;un is sick, an&rsquo; two of them has
    kids in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How the &mdash;&mdash; do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, one of &rsquo;em come to me an&rsquo; told me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was an involuntary guffaw.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Bob,&rdquo; said Billy Woods, the rouseabouts&rsquo; secretary,
    kindly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you make a fool of yourself. You&rsquo;ll have
    all the chaps laughing at you. Those girls are only working you for all you&rsquo;re
    worth. I suppose one of  &rsquo;em came crying and whining to you. Don&rsquo;t
    you bother about &rsquo;em. You don&rsquo;t know  &rsquo;em; they can pump
    water at a moment&rsquo;s notice. You haven&rsquo;t had any experience with
    women yet, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t come whinin&rsquo; and cryin&rsquo; to me,&rdquo; said
    the Giraffe, dropping his twanging drawl a little. &ldquo;She looked me straight
    in the face an&rsquo;  told me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, Giraffe,&rdquo; said Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks, &ldquo;what have
    you been doin&rsquo;? You&rsquo;ve bin down there on the nod. I&rsquo;m surprised
    at yer, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; he pretends to be so gory soft an&rsquo; innocent, too,&rdquo; growled
    the Bogan. &ldquo;We know all about you, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Giraffe,&rdquo; said Mitchell the shearer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
    never have thought it of you. We all thought you were the only virgin youth
    west the river; I always thought you were a moral young man. You mustn&rsquo;t
    think that because your conscience is pricking you everyone else&rsquo;s
    is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t had anythin&rsquo; to do with them,&rdquo; said the
    Giraffe, drawling again. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a cove that goes in for that
    sort of thing. But other chaps has, and I think they might as well help &rsquo;em
    out of their fix.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a rotten crowd,&rdquo; said Billy Woods. &ldquo;You
    don&rsquo;t know them, Bob. Don&rsquo;t bother about them&mdash;they&rsquo;re
    not worth it. Put your money in your pocket. You&rsquo;ll find a better use
    for it before next shearing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better shout, Giraffe,&rdquo; said Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks.</p>
  <p>Now in spite of the Giraffe&rsquo;s softness he was the hardest man in Bourke
    to move when he&rsquo;d decided on what he thought was &ldquo;the fair thing
    to do.&rdquo;  Another peculiarity of his was that on occasion, such for
    instance as &ldquo;sayin&rsquo; a few words&rdquo; at a strike meeting, he
    would straighten himself, drop the twang, and rope in his drawl, so to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, look here, you chaps,&rdquo; he said now. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    know anything about them women. I s&rsquo;pose they&rsquo;re bad, but I don&rsquo;t
    suppose they&rsquo;re worse than men has made them. All I know is that there&rsquo;s
    four women turned out, without any stuff, and every woman in Bourke, an&rsquo; the
    police, an&rsquo; the law agen &rsquo;em. An&rsquo;  the fact that they is
    women is agenst &rsquo;em most of all. You don&rsquo;t expect &rsquo;em to
    hump their swags to Sydney! Why, only I ain&rsquo;t got the stuff I wouldn&rsquo;t
    trouble yer. I&rsquo;d pay their fares meself. Look,&rdquo; he said, lowering
    his voice, &ldquo;there they are now, an&rsquo; one of the girls is cryin&rsquo;.
    Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em see yer lookin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I dropped softly from the plank and peeped out with the rest.</p>
  <p>They stood by the fence on the opposite side of the street, a bit up towards
    the railway station, with their portmanteaux and bundles at their feet. One
    girl leant with her arms on the fence rail and her face buried in them, another
    was trying to comfort her. The third girl and the woman stood facing our
    way. The woman was good-looking; she had a hard face, but it might have been
    made hard. The third girl seemed half defiant, half inclined to cry. Presently
    she went to the other side of the girl who was crying on the fence and put
    her arm round her shoulder. The woman suddenly turned her back on us and
    stood looking away over the paddocks.</p>
  <p>The hat went round. Billy Woods was first, then Box-o&rsquo;Tricks, and
    then Mitchell.</p>
  <p>Billy contributed with eloquent silence. &ldquo;I was only jokin&rsquo;,
    Giraffe,&rdquo; said Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks, dredging his pockets for a couple
    of shillings. It was some time after the shearing, and most of the chaps
    were hard up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; sighed Mitchell. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help for
    it. If the Giraffe would take up a collection to import some decent girls
    to this God-forgotten hole there might be some sense in it. . . . It&rsquo;s
    bad enough for the Giraffe to undermine our religious prejudices, and tempt
    us to take a morbid interest in sick Chows and Afghans, and blacklegs and
    widows; but when he starts mixing us up with strange women it&rsquo;s time
    to buck.&rdquo; And he prospected his pockets and contributed two shillings,
    some odd pennies, and a pinch of tobacco dust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind helping the girls, but I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll
    give a penny to help the old&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said Tom Hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, she was a girl once herself,&rdquo; drawled the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe went round to the other pubs and to the union offices, and when
    he returned he seemed satisfied with the plate, but troubled about something
    else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do for them for to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;None
    of the pubs or boardin&rsquo;-houses will hear of them, an&rsquo; there ain&rsquo;t
    no empty houses, an&rsquo; the women is all agen &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; said Alice, the big, handsome barmaid from Sydney.  &ldquo;Come
    here, Bob.&rdquo; She gave the Giraffe half a sovereign and a look for which
    some of us would have paid him ten pounds&mdash;had we had the money, and
    had the look been transferable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Bob,&rdquo; she said, and she went in to speak to
    the landlord.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an empty bedroom at the end of the store in the yard,&rdquo;  she
    said when she came back. &ldquo;They can camp there for to-night if they
    behave themselves. You&rsquo;d better tell &rsquo;em, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank yer, Alice,&rdquo; said the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>Next day, after work, the Giraffe and I drifted together and down by the
    river in the cool of the evening, and sat on the edge of the steep, drought-parched
    bank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard you saw your lady friends off this morning, Bob,&rdquo; I
    said, and was sorry I said it, even before he answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they ain&rsquo;t no friends of mine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only
    four poor devils of women. I thought they mightn&rsquo;t like to stand waitin&rsquo; with
    the crowd on the platform, so I jest offered to get their tickets an&rsquo; told &rsquo;em
    to wait round at the back of the station till the bell rung. . . . An&rsquo; what
    do yer think they did, Harry?&rdquo; he went on, with an exasperatingly unintelligent
    grin.  &ldquo;Why, they wanted to kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. An&rsquo; they would have done it, too, if I hadn&rsquo;t been
    so long. . . . Why, I&rsquo;m blessed if they didn&rsquo;t kiss me hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s truth. Somehow I didn&rsquo;t like to go on the platform
    with them after that; besides, they was cryin&rsquo;, and I can&rsquo;t stand
    women cryin&rsquo;. But some of the chaps put them into an empty carriage.&rdquo; He
    thought a moment. Then:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some terrible good-hearted fellers in the world,&rdquo; he
    reflected.</p>
  <p>I thought so too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a single man. Why don&rsquo;t
    you get married and settle down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no wife an&rsquo; kids,
    that&rsquo;s a fact. But it ain&rsquo;t my fault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He may have been right about the wife. But I thought of the look that Alice
    had given him, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Girls seem to like me right enough,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it
    don&rsquo;t go no further than that. The trouble is that I&rsquo;m so long,
    and I always seem to get shook after little girls. At least there was one
    little girl in Bendigo that I was properly gone on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t she have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it seems not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ask her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I asked her right enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and what did she say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She said it would be redicilus for her to be seen trotting alongside
    of a chimbley like me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps she didn&rsquo;t mean that. There are any amount of little
    women who like tall men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought of that too&mdash;afterwards. P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps she didn&rsquo;t
    mean it that way. I s&rsquo;pose the fact of the matter was that she didn&rsquo;t
    cotton on to me, and wanted to let me down easy. She didn&rsquo;t want to
    hurt me feelin&rsquo;s, if yer understand&mdash;she was a very good-hearted
    little girl. There&rsquo;s some terrible tall fellers where I come from,
    and I know two as married little girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He seemed a hopeless case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;sometimes I wish that I wasn&rsquo;t
    so blessed long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that there deaf jackeroo,&rdquo; he reflected presently. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    something in the same fix about girls as I am. He&rsquo;s too deaf and I&rsquo;m
    too long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got three
    girls, to my knowledge, and, as for being deaf, why, he gasses more than
    any man in the town, and knows more of what&rsquo;s going on than old Mother
    Brindle the washerwoman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, look at that now!&rdquo; said the Giraffe, slowly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d
    have thought it? He never told me he had three girls, an&rsquo; as for hearin&rsquo; news,
    I always tell him anything that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on that I think he doesn&rsquo;t
    catch. He told me his trouble was that whenever he went out with a girl people
    could hear what they was sayin&rsquo;&mdash;at least they could hear what
    she was sayin&rsquo; to him, an&rsquo; draw their own conclusions, he said.
    He said he went out one night with a girl, and some of the chaps foxed &rsquo;em
    an&rsquo; heard her sayin&rsquo; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; to him, an&rsquo; put
    it all round town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did she say &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; for?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell me that, but I s&rsquo;pose he was kissin&rsquo; her
    or huggin&rsquo; her or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; I said presently, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you try the little
    girl in Bendigo a second time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What was the use. She was a good little
    girl, and I wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to go botherin&rsquo; her. I ain&rsquo;t
    the sort of cove that goes hangin&rsquo;  round where he isn&rsquo;t wanted.
    But somehow I couldn&rsquo;t stay about Bendigo after she gave me the hint,
    so I thought I&rsquo;d come over an&rsquo; have a knock round on this side
    for a year or two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you never wrote to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. What was the use of goin&rsquo; pesterin&rsquo; her with letters?
    I know what trouble letters give me when I have to answer one. She&rsquo;d
    have only had to tell me the straight truth in a letter an&rsquo; it wouldn&rsquo;t
    have done me any good. But I&rsquo;ve pretty well got over it by this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few days later I went to Sydney. The Giraffe was the last I shook hands
    with from the carriage window, and he slipped something in a piece of newspaper
    into my hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope yer won&rsquo;t be offended,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;but
    some of the chaps thought you mightn&rsquo;t be too flush of stuff&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
    been shoutin&rsquo; a good deal; so they put a quid or two together. They
    thought it might help yer to have a bit of a fly round in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was back in Bourke before next shearing. On the evening of my arrival
    I ran against the Giraffe; he seemed strangely shaken over something, but
    he kept his hat on his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would yer mind takin&rsquo; a stroll as fur as the Billerbong?&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;I got something I&rsquo;d like to tell yer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His big, brown, sunburnt hands trembled and shook as he took a letter from
    his pocket and opened it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got a letter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A letter from
    that little girl at Bendigo. It seems it was all a mistake. I&rsquo;d like
    you to read it. Somehow I feel as if I want to talk to a feller, and I&rsquo;d
    rather talk to you than any of them other chaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a good letter, from a big-hearted little girl. She had been breaking
    her heart for the great ass all these months. It seemed that he had left
    Bendigo without saying good-bye to her. &ldquo;Somehow I couldn&rsquo;t bring
    meself to it,&rdquo; he said, when I taxed him with it. She had never been
    able to get his address until last week; then she got it from a Bourke man
    who had gone south. She called him &ldquo;an awful long fool,&rdquo; which
    he was, without the slightest doubt, and she implored him to write, and come
    back to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And will you go back, Bob?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! I&rsquo;d take the train to-morrer only I ain&rsquo;t got
    the stuff. But I&rsquo;ve got a stand in Big Billerbong Shed an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
    soon knock a few quid together. I&rsquo;ll go back as soon as ever shearin&rsquo;s
    over. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to write away to her to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Giraffe was the &ldquo;ringer&rdquo; of Big Billabong Shed that season.
    His tallies averaged a hundred and twenty a day. He only sent his hat round
    once during shearing, and it was noticed that he hesitated at first and only
    contributed half a crown. But then it was a case of a man being taken from
    the shed by the police for wife desertion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always that way,&rdquo; commented Mitchell. &ldquo;Those
    soft, good-hearted fellows always end by getting hard and selfish. The world
    makes  &rsquo;em so. It&rsquo;s the thought of the soft fools they&rsquo;ve
    been that finds out sooner or later and makes &rsquo;em repent. Like as not
    the Giraffe will be the meanest man out back before he&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When Big Billabong cut out, and we got back to Bourke with our dusty swags
    and dirty cheques, I spoke to Tom Hall:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Tom,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That long fool, the Giraffe,
    has been breaking his heart for a little girl in Bendigo ever since he&rsquo;s
    been out back, and she&rsquo;s been breaking her heart for him, and the ass
    didn&rsquo;t know it till he got a letter from her just before Big Billabong
    started. He&rsquo;s going to-morrow morning. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>That evening Tom stole the Giraffe&rsquo;s hat. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;ll
    turn up in the mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the Giraffe. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    mind a lark,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but it does seem a bit red hot for the
    chaps to collar a cove&rsquo;s hat and a feller goin&rsquo;  away for good,
    p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps, in the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell started the thing going with a quid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to get rid of him. We&rsquo;ll
    have some peace now. There won&rsquo;t be so many accidents or women in trouble
    when the Giraffe and his blessed hat are gone. Anyway, he&rsquo;s an eyesore
    in the town, and he&rsquo;s getting on my nerves for one. . . . Come on,
    you sinners! Chuck &rsquo;em in; we&rsquo;re only taking quids and half-quids.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>About daylight next morning Tom Hall slipped into the Giraffe&rsquo;s room
    at the Carriers&rsquo; Arms. The Giraffe was sleeping peacefully. Tom put
    the hat on a chair by his side. The collection had been a record one, and,
    besides the packet of money in the crown of the hat, there was a silver-mounted
    pipe with case&mdash;the best that could be bought in Bourke, a gold brooch,
    and several trifles&mdash;besides an ugly valentine of a long man in his
    shirt walking the room with a twin on each arm.</p>
  <p>Tom was about to shake the Giraffe by the shoulder, when he noticed a great
    foot, with about half a yard of big-boned ankle and shank, sticking out at
    the bottom of the bed. The temptation was too great. Tom took up the hair-brush,
    and, with the back of it, he gave a smart rap on the point of an in-growing
    toe-nail, and slithered.</p>
  <p>We heard the Giraffe swearing good-naturedly for a while, and then there
    was a pregnant silence. He was staring at the hat we supposed.</p>
  <p>We were all up at the station to see him off. It was rather a long wait.
    The Giraffe edged me up to the other end of the platform.</p>
  <p>He seemed overcome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s&mdash;there&rsquo;s some terrible good-hearted fellers
    in this world,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t forgit &rsquo;em,
    Harry, when you make a big name writin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m
    blessed if I don&rsquo;t feel as if I was jist goin&rsquo; to blubber!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I was glad he didn&rsquo;t. The Giraffe blubberin&rsquo; would have been
    a spectacle. I steered him back to his friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you going to kiss me, Bob?&rdquo; said the Great Western&rsquo;s
    big, handsome barmaid, as the bell rang.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind kissin&rsquo; you, Alice,&rdquo; he said,
    wiping his mouth. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to be married, yer know.&rdquo; And
    he kissed her fair on the mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; like gettin&rsquo; into practice,&rdquo; he
    said, grinning round.</p>
  <p>We thought he was improving wonderfully; but at the last moment something
    troubled him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, you chaps,&rdquo; he said, hesitatingly, with his hand
    in his pocket, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do with
    all this stuff. There&rsquo;s that there poor washerwoman that scalded her
    legs liftin&rsquo; the boiler of clothes off the fire&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We shoved him into the carriage. He hung&mdash;about half of him&mdash;out
    the window, wildly waving his hat, till the train disappeared in the scrub.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And, as I sit here writing by lamplight at midday, in the midst of a great
    city of shallow social sham, of hopeless, squalid poverty, of ignorant selfishness,
    cultured or brutish, and of noble and heroic endeavour frowned down or callously
    neglected, I am almost aware of a burst of sunshine in the room, and a long
    form leaning over my chair, and:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me for troublin&rsquo; yer; I&rsquo;m always troublin&rsquo; yer;
    but there&rsquo;s that there poor woman. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And I wish I could immortalize him!</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From - <i>When
the World was Wide.</i></p>
  <p>The&nbsp;Salvation Army does good business in some of the outback towns
    of the great pastoral wastes of Australia. There&rsquo;s the thoughtless,
    careless generosity of the bushman, whose pockets don&rsquo;t go far enough
    down his trousers (that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter with him), and who
    contributes to anything that comes along, without troubling to ask questions,
    like long Bob Brothers of Bourke, who, chancing to be &ldquo;a Protestant
    by rights,&rdquo; unwittingly subscribed towards the erection of a new Catholic
    church, and, being chaffed for his mistake, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, I don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;ll matter a hang in the
    end, anyway it goes. I ain&rsquo;t got nothink agenst the Roming Carflicks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the shearer, fresh with his cheque from a cut-out shed, gloriously
    drunk and happy, in love with all the world, and ready to subscribe towards
    any creed and shout for all hands&mdash;including Old Nick if he happened
    to come along. There&rsquo;s the shearer, half-drunk and inclined to be nasty,
    who has got the wrong end of all things with a tight grip, and who flings
    a shilling in the face of out-back conventionality (as he thinks) by chucking
    a bob into the Salvation Army ring. Then he glares round to see if he can
    catch anybody winking behind his back. There&rsquo;s the cynical joker, a
    queer mixture, who contributes generously and tempts the reformed boozer
    afterwards. There&rsquo;s the severe-faced old station-hand&mdash;in clean
    shirt and neckerchief and white moleskins&mdash;in for his annual or semiannual
    spree, who contributes on principle, and then drinks religiously until his
    cheque is gone and the horrors are come. There&rsquo;s the shearer, feeling
    mighty bad after a spree, and in danger of seeing things when he tries to
    go to sleep. He has dropped ten or twenty pounds over bar counters and at
    cards, and he now &ldquo;chucks&rdquo; a repentant shilling into the ring,
    with a very private and rather vague sort of feeling that something might
    come of it. There&rsquo;s the stout, contented, good-natured publican, who
    tips the Army as if it were a barrel-organ. And there are others and other
    reasons&mdash;black sheep and ne&rsquo;er-do-weels&mdash;and faint echoes
    of other times in Salvation Army tunes.</p>
  <p>Bourke, the metropolis of the Great Scrubs, on the banks of the Darling
    River, about five hundred miles from Sydney, was suffering from a long drought
    when I was there in ninety-two; and the heat may or may not have been another
    cause contributing to the success, from a business point of view, of the
    Bourke garrison. There was much beer boozing&mdash;and, besides, it was vaguely
    understood (as most things are vaguely understood out there in the drought-haze)
    that the place the Army came to save us from was hotter than Bourke. We didn&rsquo;t
    hanker to go to a hotter place than Bourke. But that year there was an extraordinary
    reason for the Army&rsquo;s great financial success there.</p>
  <p>She was a little girl, nineteen or twenty, I should judge, the prettiest
    girl I ever saw in the Army, and one of the prettiest I&rsquo;ve ever seen
    out of it. She had the features of an angel, but her expression was wonderfully
    human, sweet and sympathetic. Her big grey eyes were sad with sympathy for
    sufferers and sinners, and her poke bonnet was full of bunchy, red-gold hair.
    Her first appearance was somewhat dramatic&mdash;perhaps the Army arranged
    it so.</p>
  <p>The Army used to pray, and thump the drum, and sing, and take up collections
    every evening outside Watty Bothways&rsquo; Hotel, the Carriers&rsquo; Arms.
    They performed longer and more often outside Watty&rsquo;s than any other
    pub in town&mdash;perhaps because Watty was considered the most hopeless
    publican and his customers the hardest crowd of boozers in Bourke. The band
    generally began to play about dusk. Watty would lean back comfortably in
    a basket easy-chair on his wide veranda, and clasp his hands, in a calm,
    contented way, while the Army banged the drum and got steam up, and whilst,
    perhaps, there was a barney going on in the bar, or a bloodthirsty fight
    in the backyard. On such occasions there was something like an indulgent
    or fatherly expression on his fat and usually emotionless face. And by and
    by he&rsquo;d move his head gently and doze. The banging and the singing
    seemed to soothe him, and the praying, which was often very personal, never
    seemed to disturb him in the least.</p>
  <p>Well, it was about dusk one day; it had been a terrible day, a hundred and
    something startling in the shade, but there came a breeze after sunset. There
    had been several dozen of buckets of water thrown on the veranda floor and
    the ground outside. Watty was seated in his accustomed place when the Army
    arrived. There was no barney in the bar because there was a fight in the
    backyard, and that claimed the attention of all the customers.</p>
  <p>The Army prayed for Watty and his clients; then a reformed drunkard started
    to testify against publicans and all their works. Watty settled himself comfortably,
    folded his hands, and leaned back and dozed.</p>
  <p>The fight was over, and the chaps began to drop round to the bar. The man
    who was saved waved his arms, and danced round and howled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-es!&rdquo; he shouted hoarsely. &ldquo;The publicans, and boozers,
    and gamblers, and sinners may think that Bourke is hot, but hell is a thousand
    times hotter! I tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; said Mitchell, the shearer, and he threw a penny
    into the ring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-es! I tell you that hell is a million times hotter than Bourke!
    I tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, look here,&rdquo; said a voice from the background, &ldquo;that
    won&rsquo;t wash. Why, don&rsquo;t you know that when the Bourke people die
    they send back for their blankets?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The saved brother glared round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hear a freethinker speaking, my friends,&rdquo; he said. Then,
    with sudden inspiration and renewed energy, &ldquo;I hear the voice of a
    freethinker. Show me the face of a freethinker,&rdquo; he yelled, glaring
    round like a hunted, hungry man. &ldquo;Show me the face of a freethinker,
    and I&rsquo;ll tell you what he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Watty hitched himself into a more comfortable position and clasped his hands
    on his knee and closed his eyes again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ya-a-a-s!&rdquo; shrieked the brand. &ldquo;I tell you, my friends,
    I can tell a freethinker by his face. Show me the face of a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At this point there was an interruption. One-eyed, or Wall-eyed, Bogan,
    who had a broken nose, and the best side of whose face was reckoned the ugliest
    and most sinister&mdash;One-eyed Bogan thrust his face forward from the ring
    of darkness into the torchlight of salvation. He had got the worst of a drawn
    battle; his nose and mouth were bleeding, and his good eye was damaged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look at my face!&rdquo; he snarled, with dangerous earnestness. &ldquo;Look
    at my face! That&rsquo;s the face of a freethinker, and I don&rsquo;t care
    who knows it. Now! what have you got to say against my face, &lsquo;Man-without-a-Shirt?&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
  <p>The brother drew back. He had been known in the northwest in his sinful
    days as &ldquo;Man-without-a-Shirt,&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>alias</i>&nbsp;&ldquo;Shirty,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
    Dirty Man,&rdquo; and was flabbergasted at being recognized in speech. Also,
    he had been in a shearing-shed and in a shanty orgie with One-eyed Bogan,
    and knew the man.</p>
  <p>Now most of the chaps respected the Army, and, indeed, anything that looked
    like religion, but the Bogan&rsquo;s face, as representing free-thought,
    was a bit too sudden for them. There were sounds on the opposite side of
    the ring as from men being smitten repeatedly and rapidly below the belt,
    and long Tom Hall and one or two others got away into the darkness in the
    background, where Tom rolled helplessly on the grass and sobbed.</p>
  <p>It struck me that Bogan&rsquo;s face was more the result of free speech
    than anything else.</p>
  <p>The Army was about to pray when the Pretty Girl stepped forward, her eyes
    shining with indignation and enthusiasm. She had arrived by the evening train,
    and had been standing shrinkingly behind an Army lass of fifty Australian
    summers, who was about six feet high, flat and broad, and had a square face,
    and a mouth like a joint in boiler plates.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl stamped her pretty foot on the gravel, and her eyes flashed
    in the torchlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Great
    big men like you to be going on the way you are. If you were ignorant or
    poor, as I&rsquo;ve seen people, there might be some excuse for you. Haven&rsquo;t
    you got any mothers, or sisters, or wives to think of? What sort of a life
    is this you lead? Drinking, and gambling, and fighting, and swearing your
    lives away! Do you ever think of God and the time when you were children?
    Why don&rsquo;t you make homes? Look at that man&rsquo;s face!&rdquo; (she
    pointed suddenly at Bogan, who collapsed and sidled behind his mates out
    of the light). &ldquo;Look at that man&rsquo;s face! Is it a face for a Christian?
    And you help and encourage him to fight. You&rsquo;re worse than he is. Oh,
    it&rsquo;s brutal. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s wicked. Great big men like
    you, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Long Bob Brothers&mdash;about six-foot-four&mdash;the longest and most innocent
    there, shrunk down by the wall and got his inquiring face out of the light.
    The Pretty Girl fluttered on for a few moments longer, greatly excited, and
    then stepped back, seemingly much upset, and was taken under the wing of
    the woman with the boiler-plate mouth.</p>
  <p>It was a surprise, and very sudden. Bogan slipped round to the backyard,
    and was seen bathing his battered features at the pump. The rest wore the
    expression of men who knew that something unusual has happened, but don&rsquo;t
    know what, and are waiting vacantly for developments.&mdash;Except Tom Hall,
    who had recovered and returned. He stood looking over the head of the ring
    of bushmen, and apparently taking the same critical interest in the girl
    as he would in a fight&mdash;his expression was such as a journalist might
    wear who is getting exciting copy.</p>
  <p>The Army had it all their own way for the rest of the evening, and made
    a good collection. The Pretty Girl stood smiling round with shining eyes
    as the bobs and tanners dropped in, and then, being shoved forward by the
    flat woman, she thanked us sweetly, and said we were good fellows, and that
    she was sorry for some things she&rsquo;d said to us. Then she retired, fluttering
    and very much flushed, and hid herself behind the hard woman&mdash;who, by
    the way, had an excrescence on her upper lip which might have stood for a
    rivet.</p>
  <p>Presently the Pretty Girl came from behind the big woman and stood watching
    things with glistening eyes. Some of the chaps on the opposite side of the
    ring moved a little to one side and all were careful not to meet her eye&mdash;not
    to be caught looking at her&mdash;lest she should be embarrassed. Watty had
    roused himself a little at the sound of a strange voice in the Army (and
    such a clear, sweet voice too!) and had a look; then he settled back peacefully
    again, but it was noticed that he didn&rsquo;t snore that evening.</p>
  <p>And when the Army prayed, the Pretty Girl knelt down with the rest on the
    gravel. One or two tall bushmen bowed their heads as if they had to, and
    One-eyed Bogan, with the blood washed from his face, stood with his hat off,
    glaring round to see if he could catch anyone sniggering.</p>
  <p>Mitchell, the shearer, said afterwards that the whole business made him
    feel for the moment like he felt sometimes in the days when he used to feel
    things.</p>
  <p>The town discussed the Pretty Girl in the Army that night and for many days
    thereafter, but no one could find out who she was or where she belonged to&mdash;except
    that she came from Sydney last. She kept her secret, if she had one, very
    close&mdash;or else the other S.-A. women were not to be pumped. She lived
    in skillion-rooms at the back of the big weather-board Salvation Army barracks
    with two other &ldquo;lassies,&rdquo; who did washing and sewing and nursing,
    and went shabby, and half starved themselves, and were baked in the heat,
    like scores of women in the bush, and even as hundreds of women, suffering
    from religious mania, slave and stint in city slums, and neglect their homes,
    husbands and children&mdash;for the glory of Booth.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl was referred to as Sister Hannah by the Army people, and
    came somehow to be known by sinners as &ldquo;Miss Captain.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t
    know whether that was her real name or what rank she held in the Army, if
    indeed she held any.</p>
  <p>She sold&nbsp;<i>War Crys</i>, and the circulation doubled in a day. One-eyed
    Bogan, being bailed up unexpectedly, gave her &ldquo;half a caser&rdquo; for
    a&nbsp;<i>Cry</i>, and ran away without the paper or the change. Jack Mitchell
    bought a&nbsp;<i>Cry</i>&nbsp;for the first time in his life, and read it.
    He said he found some of the articles intensely realistic, and many of the
    statements were very interesting. He said he read one or two things in the&nbsp;<i>Cry</i>&nbsp;that
    he didn&rsquo;t know before. Tom Hall, taken unawares, bought three&nbsp;<i>Crys</i>&nbsp;from
    the Pretty Girl, and blushed to find it fame.</p>
  <p>Little Billy Woods, the Labourers&rsquo; Union secretary&mdash;who had a
    poetic temperament and more than the average bushman&rsquo;s reverence for
    higher things&mdash;Little Billy Woods told me in a burst of confidence that
    he generally had two feelings, one after the other, after encountering that
    girl. One was that unfathomable far-away feeling of loneliness and longing,
    that comes at odd times to the best of married men, with the best of wives
    and children&mdash;as Billy had. The other feeling, which came later on,
    and was a reaction in fact, was the feeling of a man who thinks he&rsquo;s
    been twisted round a woman&rsquo;s little finger for the benefit of somebody
    else. Billy said that he couldn&rsquo;t help being reminded by the shy, sweet
    smile and the shy, sweet &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; of the Pretty Girl in the
    Army, of the shy, sweet smile and the shy, sweet gratitude of a Sydney private
    barmaid, who had once roped him in, in the days before he was married. Then
    he&rsquo;d reckon that the Army lassie had been sent out back to Bourke as
    a business speculation.</p>
  <p>Tom Hall was inclined to reckon so too&mdash;but that was after he&rsquo;d
    been chaffed for a month about the three&nbsp;<i>War Crys</i>.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl was discussed from psychological points of view; not forgetting
    the sex problem. Donald Macdonald&mdash;shearer, union leader and labour
    delegate to other colonies on occasion&mdash;Donald Macdonald said that whenever
    he saw a circle of plain or ugly, dried-up women or girls round a shepherd,
    evangelist or a Salvation Army drum, he&rsquo;d say &ldquo;sexually starved!&rdquo;  They
    were hungry for love. Religious mania was sexual passion dammed out of its
    course. Therefore he held that morbidly religious girls were the most easily
    seduced.</p>
  <p>But this couldn&rsquo;t apply to Pretty Girl in the Army. Mitchell reckoned
    that she&rsquo;d either had a great sorrow&mdash;a lot of trouble, or a disappointment
    in love (the &ldquo;or&rdquo; is Mitchell&rsquo;s); but they couldn&rsquo;t
    see how a girl like her could possibly be disappointed in love&mdash;unless
    the chap died or got into jail for life. Donald decided that her soul had
    been starved somehow.</p>
  <p>Mitchell suggested that it might be only a craving for notoriety, the same
    thing that makes women and girls go amongst lepers, and out to the battlefield,
    and nurse ugly pieces of men back to life again; the same thing that makes
    some women and girls swear ropes round men&rsquo;s necks. The Pretty Girl
    might be the daughter of well-to-do people&mdash;even aristocrats, said Mitchell&mdash;she
    was pretty enough and spoke well enough. &ldquo;Every woman&rsquo;s a barmaid
    at heart,&rdquo; as the&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>&nbsp;puts it, said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>But not even one of the haggard women of Bourke ever breathed a suspicion
    of scandal against her. They said she was too good and too pretty to be where
    she was. You see it was not as in an old settled town where hags blacken
    God&rsquo;s world with their tongues. Bourke was just a little camping town
    in a big land, where free, good-hearted democratic Australians, and the best
    of black sheep from the old world were constantly passing through; where
    husband&rsquo;s were often obliged to be away from home for twelve months,
    and the storekeepers had to trust the people, and mates trusted each other,
    and the folks were broad-minded. The mind&rsquo;s eye had a wide range.</p>
  <p>After her maiden speech the Pretty Girl seldom spoke, except to return thanks
    for collections&mdash;and she never testified. She had a sweet voice and
    used to sing.</p>
  <p>Now, if I were writing pure fiction, and were not cursed with an obstinate
    inclination to write the truth, I might say that, after the advent of the
    Pretty Girl, the morals of Bourke improved suddenly and wonderfully. That
    One-eyed Bogan left off gambling and drinking and fighting and swearing,
    and put on a red coat and testified and fought the devil only; that Mitchell
    dropped his mask of cynicism; that Donald Macdonald ate no longer of the
    tree of knowledge and ceased to worry himself with psychological problems,
    and was happy; and that Tom Hall was no longer a scoffer. That no one sneaked
    round through the scrub after dusk to certain necessary establishments in
    weather-board cottages on the outskirts of the town; and that the broad-minded
    and obliging ladies thereof became Salvation Army lassies.</p>
  <p>But none of these things happened. Drunks quieted down or got out of the
    way if they could when the Pretty Girl appeared on the scene, fights and
    games of &ldquo;headin&rsquo; &rsquo;em&rdquo; were adjourned, and weak,
    ordinary language was used for the time being, and that was about all.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, most of the chaps were in love with that Pretty Girl in the
    Army&mdash;all those who didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>worship</i>&nbsp;her privately.
    Long Bob Brothers hovered round in hopes, they said, that she&rsquo;d meet
    with an accident&mdash;get run over by a horse or something&mdash;and he&rsquo;d
    have to carry her in; he scared the women at the barracks by dropping firewood
    over the fence after dark. Barcoo-Rot, the meanest man in the back country,
    was seen to drop a threepenny bit into the ring, and a rumour was industriously
    circulated (by Tom Hall) to the effect that One-eyed Bogan intended to shave
    and join the Army disguised as a lassie.</p>
  <p>Handsome Jake Boreham (<i>alias</i>&nbsp;Bore-&rsquo;em), a sentimental
    shearer from New Zealand, who had read Bret Harte, made an elaborate attempt
    for the Pretty Girl, by pretending to be going to the dogs headlong, with
    an idea of first winning her sorrowful interest and sympathy, and then making
    an apparently hard struggle to straighten up for her sake. He mated his experience
    with the cheerful and refreshing absence of reserve which was characteristic
    of him, and is of most bushmen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d had a few drinks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and was having
    a spell under a gum by the river, when I saw the Pretty Girl and another
    Army woman coming down along the bank. It was a blazing hot day. I thought
    of Sandy and the Schoolmistress in Bret Harte, and I thought it would be
    a good idea to stretch out in the sun and pretend to be helpless; so I threw
    my hat on the ground and lay down, with my head in the blazing heat, in the
    most graceful position I could get at, and I tried to put a look of pained
    regret on my face, as if I was dreaming of my lost boyhood and me mother.
    I thought, perhaps, the Girl would pity me, and I felt sure she&rsquo;d stoop
    and pick up my hat and put it gently over my poor troubled head. Then I was
    going to become conscious for a moment, and look hopelessly round, and into
    her eyes, and then start and look sorrowful and ashamed, and stagger to my
    feet, taking off my hat like the Silver King does to the audience when he
    makes his first appearance drunk on the stage; and then I was going to reel
    off, trying to walk as straight as I could. And next day I was going to clean
    up my teeth and nails and put on a white shirt, and start to be a new man
    henceforth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, as I lay there with my eyes shut, I heard the footsteps come
    up and stop, and heard &rsquo;em whisper, and I thought I heard the Pretty
    Girl say  &lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo; or something that sounded like that;
    and just then I got a God-almighty poke in the ribs with an umbrella&mdash;at
    least I suppose it was aimed for my ribs; but women are bad shots, and the
    point of the umbrella caught me in the side, just between the bottom rib
    and the hip-bone, and I sat up with a click, like the blade of a pocketknife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The other lassie was the big square-faced woman. The Pretty Girl
    looked rather more frightened and disgusted than sentimental, but she had
    plenty of pluck, and soon pulled herself together. She said I ought to be
    ashamed of myself, a great big man like me, lying there in the dust like
    a drunken tramp&mdash;an eyesore and a disgrace to all the world. She told
    me to go to my camp, wherever that was, and sleep myself sober. The square-jawed
    woman said I looked like a fool sitting there. I did feel ashamed, and I
    reckon I did look like a fool&mdash;a man generally does in a fix like that.
    I felt like one, anyway. I got up and walked away, and it hurt me so much
    that I went over to West Bourke and went to the dogs properly for a fortnight,
    and lost twenty quid on a game of draughts against a blindfold player. Now
    both those women had umbrellas, but I&rsquo;m not sure to this day which
    of &rsquo;em it was that gave me the poke. It wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered
    much anyway. I haven&rsquo;t borrowed one of Bret Harte&rsquo;s books since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jake reflected a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The worst of it was,&rdquo; he said ruefully, &ldquo;that I wasn&rsquo;t
    sure that the girl or the woman didn&rsquo;t see through me, and that worried
    me a bit. You never can tell how much a woman suspects, and that&rsquo;s
    the worst of &rsquo;em. I found that out after I got married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl in the Army grew pale and thin and bigger-eyed. The women
    said it was a shame, and that she ought to be sent home to her friends, wherever
    they were. She was laid up for two or three days, and some of the women cooked
    delicacies and handed &rsquo;em over the barracks fence, and offered to come
    in and nurse her; but the square woman took washing home and nursed the girl
    herself.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl still sold&nbsp;<i>War Crys</i>&nbsp;and took up collections,
    but in a tired, listless, half shamed-faced way. It was plain that she was
    tired of the Army, and growing ashamed of the Salvationists. Perhaps she
    had come to see things too plainly.</p>
  <p>You see, the Army does no good out back in Australia&mdash;except from a
    business point of view. It is simply there to collect funds for hungry headquarters.
    The bushmen are much too intelligent for the Army. There was no poverty in
    Bourke&mdash;as it is understood in the city; there was plenty of food; and
    camping out and roughing it come natural to the bushmen. In cases of sickness,
    accident, widows or orphans, the chaps sent round the hat, without banging
    a drum or testifying, and that was all right. If a chap was hard up he borrowed
    a couple of quid from his mate. If a strange family arrived without a penny,
    someone had to fix &rsquo;em up, and the storekeepers helped them till the
    man got work. For the rest, we work out our own salvation, or damnation&mdash;as
    the case is&mdash;in the bush, with no one to help us, except a mate, perhaps.
    The Army can&rsquo;t help us, but a fellow-sinner can, sometimes, who has
    been through it all himself. The Army is only a drag on the progress of Democracy,
    because it attracts many who would otherwise be aggressive Democrats&mdash;and
    for other reasons.</p>
  <p>Besides, if we all reformed the Army would get deuced little from us for
    its city mission.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl went to service for a while with the stock inspector&rsquo;s
    wife, who could get nothing out of her concerning herself or her friends.
    She still slept at the barracks, stuck to the Army, and attended its meetings.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was Christmas morning, and there was peace in Bourke and goodwill towards
    all men. There hadn&rsquo;t been a fight since yesterday evening, and that
    had only been a friendly one, to settle an argument concerning the past ownership,
    and, at the same time, to decide as to the future possession of a dog.</p>
  <p>It had been a hot, close night, and it ended in a suffocating sunrise. The
    free portion of the male population were in the habit of taking their blankets
    and sleeping out in &ldquo;the Park,&rdquo; or town square, in hot weather;
    the wives and daughters of the town slept, or tried to sleep, with bedroom
    windows and doors open, while husbands lay outside on the verandas. I camped
    in a corner of the park that night, and the sun woke me.</p>
  <p>As I sat up I caught sight of a swagman coming along the white, dusty road
    from the direction of the bridge, where the cleared road ran across west
    and on, a hundred and thirty miles, through the barren, broiling mulga scrubs,
    to Hungerford, on the border of Sheol. I knew that swagman&rsquo;s walk.
    It was John Merrick (Jack Moonlight), one-time Shearers&rsquo; Union secretary
    at Coonamble, and generally &ldquo;Rep&rdquo; (shearers&rsquo; representative)
    in any shed where he sheared. He was a &ldquo;better-class shearer,&rdquo; one
    of those quiet, thoughtful men of whom there are generally two or three in
    the roughest of rough sheds, who have great influence, and give the shed
    a good name from a Union point of view. Not quiet with the resentful or snobbish
    reserve of the educated Englishman, but with a sad or subdued sort of quietness
    that has force in it&mdash;as if they fully realized that their intelligence
    is much higher than the average, that they have suffered more real trouble
    and heartbreak than the majority of their mates, and that their mates couldn&rsquo;t
    possibly understand them if they spoke as they felt and couldn&rsquo;t see
    things as they do&mdash;yet men who understand and are intensely sympathetic
    in their loneliness and sensitive reserve.</p>
  <p>I had worked in a shed with Jack Moonlight, and had met him in Sydney, and
    to be mates with a bushman for a few weeks is to know him well&mdash;anyway,
    I found it so. He had taken a trip to Sydney the Christmas before last, and
    when he came back there was something wanting. He became more silent, he
    drank more, and sometimes alone, and took to smoking heavily. He dropped
    his mates, took little or no interest in Union matters, and travelled alone,
    and at night.</p>
  <p>The Australian bushman is born with a mate who sticks to him through life&mdash;like
    a mole. They may be hundreds of miles apart sometimes, and separated for
    years, yet they are mates for life. A bushman may have many mates in his
    roving, but there is always one&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;mate, &ldquo;my mate;&rdquo;  and
    it is common to hear a bushman, who is, in every way, a true mate to the
    man he happens to be travelling with, speak of&nbsp;<i>his mate&rsquo;s mate</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s
    mate&rdquo;&mdash;who might be in Klondyke or South Africa. A bushman has
    always a mate to comfort him and argue with him, and work and tramp and drink
    with him, and lend him quids when he&rsquo;s hard up, and call him a b&mdash;&mdash; fool,
    and fight him sometimes; to abuse him to his face and defend his name behind
    his back; to bear false witness and perjure his soul for his sake; to lie
    to the girl for him if he&rsquo;s single, and to his wife if he&rsquo;s married;
    to secure a &ldquo;pen&rdquo; for him at a shed where he isn&rsquo;t on the
    spot, or, if the mate is away in New Zealand or South Africa, to write and
    tell him if it&rsquo;s any good coming over this way. And each would take
    the word of the other against all the world, and each believes that the other
    is the straightest chap that ever lived&mdash;&ldquo;a white man!&rdquo; And
    next best to your old mate is the man you&rsquo;re tramping, riding, working,
    or drinking with.</p>
  <p>About the first thing the cook asks you when you come along to a shearers&rsquo; hut
    is, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your mate?&rdquo; I travelled alone for a while
    one time, and it seemed to me sometimes, by the tone of the inquiry concerning
    the whereabouts of my mate, that the bush had an idea that I might have done
    away with him and that the thing ought to be looked into.</p>
  <p>When a man drops mateship altogether and takes to &ldquo;hatting&rdquo; in
    the bush, it&rsquo;s a step towards a convenient tree and a couple of saddle-straps
    buckled together.</p>
  <p>I had an idea that I, in a measure, took the place of Jack Moonlight&rsquo;s
    mate about this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Jack!&rdquo; I hailed as he reached the corner of the
    park.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, Harry!&rdquo; said Jack, as if he&rsquo;d seen me last
    yesterday evening instead of three months ago. &ldquo;How are you getting
    on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We walked together towards the Union Office, where I had a camp in the skillion-room
    at the back. Jack was silent. But there&rsquo;s no place in the world where
    a man&rsquo;s silence is respected so much (within reasonable bounds) as
    in the Australian bush, where every man has a past more or less sad, and
    every man a ghost&mdash;perhaps from other lands that we know nothing of,
    and speaking in a foreign tongue. They say in the bush, &ldquo;Oh, Jack&rsquo;s
    only thinking! &ldquo; And they let him think. Generally you want to think
    as much as your mate; and when you&rsquo;ve been together some time it&rsquo;s
    quite natural to travel all day without exchanging a word. In the morning
    Jim says, &ldquo;Well, I think I made a bargain with that horse, Bill,&rdquo; and
    some time late in the afternoon, say twenty miles farther on, it occurs to
    Bill to &ldquo;rejoin,&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I reckon the blank as sold it
    to you had yer proper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I like a good thinking mate, and I believe that thinking in company is a
    lot more healthy and more comfortable, as well as less risky, than thinking
    alone.</p>
  <p>On the way to the Union Office Jack and I passed the Royal Hotel, and caught
    a glimpse, through the open door, of a bed room off the veranda, of the landlord&rsquo;s
    fresh, fair, young Sydney girl-wife, sleeping prettily behind the mosquito-net,
    like a sleeping beauty, while the boss lay on a mattress outside on the veranda,
    across the open door. (He wasn&rsquo;t necessary for publication, but an
    evidence of good faith.)</p>
  <p>I glanced at Jack for a grin, but didn&rsquo;t get one. He wore the pained
    expression of a man who is suddenly hit hard with the thought of something
    that might have been.</p>
  <p>I boiled the billy and fried a pound of steak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Been travelling all night, Jack?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I camped at Emus yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He didn&rsquo;t eat. I began to reckon that he was brooding too much for
    his health. He was much thinner than when I saw him last, and pretty haggard,
    and he had something of the hopeless, haggard look that I&rsquo;d seen in
    Tom Hall&rsquo;s eyes after the last big shearing strike, when Tom had worked
    day and night to hold his mates up all through the hard, bitter struggle,
    and the battle was lost.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Jack!&rdquo; I said at last. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s up, Harry,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;What made you
    think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got yourself into any fix?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
    the Hungerford track been doing to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Harry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right. How are you?&rdquo; And
    he pulled some string and papers and a roll of dusty pound notes from his
    pocket and threw them on the bunk.</p>
  <p>I was hard up just then, so I took a note and the billy to go to the Royal
    and get some beer. I thought the beer might loosen his mind a bit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better take a couple of quid,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You look as
    if you want some new shirts and things.&rdquo; But a pound was enough for
    me, and I think he had reason to be glad of that later on, as it turned out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything new in Bourke?&rdquo; asked Jack as we drank the beer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;not a thing&mdash;except there&rsquo;s
    a pretty girl in the Salvation Army.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s about time,&rdquo; growled Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Jack,&rdquo; I said presently, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
    come over you lately at all? I might be able to help you. It&rsquo;s not
    a bit of use telling me that there&rsquo;s nothing the matter. When a man
    takes to brooding and travelling alone it&rsquo;s a bad sign, and it will
    end in a leaning tree and a bit of clothes-line as likely as not. Tell me
    what the trouble is. Tell us all about it. There&rsquo;s a ghost, isn&rsquo;t
    there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose so,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all got
    our ghosts for that matter. But never you mind, Harry; I&rsquo;m all right.
    I don&rsquo;t go interfering with your ghosts, and I don&rsquo;t see what
    call you&rsquo;ve got to come haunting mine. Why, it&rsquo;s as bad as kicking
    a man&rsquo;s dog.&rdquo; And he gave the ghost of a grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, Jack,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is it a woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a woman. Now, are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it a girl?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>So there was no more to be said. I&rsquo;d thought it might have been a
    lot worse than a girl. I&rsquo;d thought he might have got married somewhere,
    sometime, and made a mess of it.</p>
  <p>We had dinner at Billy Woods&rsquo;s place, and a sensible Christmas dinner
    it was&mdash;everything cold, except the vegetables, with the hose going
    on the veranda in spite of the by-laws, and Billy&rsquo;s wife and her sister,
    fresh and cool-looking and jolly, instead of being hot and brown and cross
    like most Australian women who roast themselves over a blazing fire in a
    hot kitchen on a broiling day, all the morning, to cook scalding plum pudding
    and redhot roasts, for no other reason than that their grandmothers used
    to cook hot Christmas dinners in England.</p>
  <p>And in the afternoon we went for a row on the river, pulling easily up the
    anabranch and floating down with the stream under the shade of the river
    timber&mdash;instead of going to sleep and waking up helpless and soaked
    in perspiration, to find the women with headaches, as many do on Christmas
    Day in Australia.</p>
  <p>Mrs Woods tried to draw Jack out, but it was no use, and in the evening
    he commenced drinking, and that made Billy uneasy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
    Jack&rsquo;s on the wrong track,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>After tea most of us collected about Watty&rsquo;s veranda. Most things
    that happened in Bourke happened at Watty&rsquo;s pub, or near it.</p>
  <p>If a horse bolted with a buggy or cart, he was generally stopped outside
    Watty&rsquo;s, which seemed to suggest, as Mitchell said, that most of the
    heroes drank at Watty&rsquo;s&mdash;also that the pluckiest men were found
    amongst the hardest drinkers. (But sometimes the horse fetched up against
    Watty&rsquo;s sign and lamppost&mdash;which was a stout one of &ldquo;iron-bark&rdquo;&mdash;and
    smashed the trap.) Then Watty&rsquo;s was the Carriers&rsquo; Arms, a union
    pub; and Australian teamsters are mostly hard cases: while there was something
    in Watty&rsquo;s beer which made men argue fluently, and the best fights
    came off in his backyard. Watty&rsquo;s dogs were the most quarrelsome in
    town, and there was a dog-fight there every other evening, followed as often
    as not by a man-fight. If a bushman&rsquo;s horse ran away with him the chances
    were that he&rsquo;d be thrown on to Watty&rsquo;s veranda, if he wasn&rsquo;t
    pitched into the bar; and victims of accidents, and sick, hard-up shearers,
    were generally carried to Watty&rsquo;s pub, as being the most convenient
    and comfortable for them. Mitchell denied that it was generosity or good
    nature on Watty&rsquo;s part, he said it was all business&mdash;advertisement.
    Watty knew what he was doing. He was very deep, was Watty. Mitchell further
    hinted that if&nbsp;<i>he</i>&nbsp;was sick he wouldn&rsquo;t be carried
    to Watty&rsquo;s, for Watty knew what a thirsty business a funeral was. Tom
    Hall reckoned that Watty bribed the Army on the quiet.</p>
  <p>I was sitting on a stool along the veranda wall with Donald Macdonald, Bob
    Brothers (the Giraffe) and Mitchell, and one or two others, and Jack Moonlight
    sat on the floor with his back to the wall and his hat well down over his
    eyes. The Army came along at the usual time, but we didn&rsquo;t see the
    Pretty Girl at first&mdash;she was a bit late. Mitchell said he liked to
    be at Watty&rsquo;s when the Army prayed and the Pretty Girl was there; he
    had no objection to being prayed for by a girl like that, though he reckoned
    that nothing short of a real angel could save him now. He said his old grandmother
    used to pray for him every night of her life and three times on Sunday, with
    Christmas Day extra when Christmas Day didn&rsquo;t fall on a Sunday; but
    Mitchell reckoned that the old lady couldn&rsquo;t have had much influence
    because he became more sinful every year, and went deeper in ways of darkness,
    until finally he embarked on a career of crime.</p>
  <p>The Army prayed, and then a thin &ldquo;ratty&rdquo; little woman bobbed
    up in the ring; she&rsquo;d gone mad on religion as women do on woman&rsquo;s
    rights and hundreds of other things. She was so skinny in the face, her jaws
    so prominent, and her mouth so wide, that when she opened it to speak it
    was like a ventriloquist&rsquo;s dummy and you could almost see the cracks
    open down under her ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They say I&rsquo;m cracked!&rdquo; she screamed in a shrill, cracked
    voice.  &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not cracked&mdash;I&rsquo;m only cracked on
    the Lord Jesus Christ! That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m cracked on.&rdquo; And
    just then the Amen man of the Army&mdash;the Army groaner we called him,
    who was always putting both feet in it&mdash;just then he blundered forward,
    rolled up his eyes, threw his hands up and down as if he were bouncing two
    balls, and said, with deep feeling:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord she&rsquo;s got a crack in the right place!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hall doubled up, and most of the other sinners seemed to think there
    was something very funny about it. And the Army, too, seemed struck with
    an idea that there was something wrong somewhere, for they started a hymn.</p>
  <p>A big American negro, who&rsquo;d been a night watchman in Sydney, stepped
    into the ring and waved his arms and kept time, and as he got excited he
    moved his hands up and down rapidly, as if he was hauling down a rope in
    a great hurry through a pulley block above, and he kept saying, &ldquo;Come
    down, Lord!&rdquo; all through the hymn, like a bass accompaniment, &ldquo;Come
    down, Lord; come down, Lord; come down, Lord; come down, Lord!&rdquo; and
    the quicker he said it the faster he hauled. He was as good as a drum. And,
    when the hymn was over, he started to testify.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My frens!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was once black as der coals in
    der mined! I was once black as der ink in der ocean of sin! But now&mdash;thank
    an&rsquo; bless the Lord!&mdash;I am whiter dan der dribben snow!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hall sat down on the edge of the veranda and leaned his head against
    a post and cried. He had contributed a bob this evening, and he was getting
    his money&rsquo;s worth.</p>
  <p>Then the Pretty Girl arrived and was pushed forward into the ring. She looked
    thinner and whiter than I&rsquo;d ever seen her, and there was a feverish
    brightness in her eyes that I didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Men!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is Christmas Day.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t
    hear any more for, at the sound of her voice, Jack Moonlight jumped up as
    if he&rsquo;d sat on a baby. He started forward, stared at her for a moment
    as if he couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes, and then said, &ldquo;Hannah!&rdquo; short
    and sharp. She started as if she was shot, gave him a wild look, and stumbled
    forward; the next moment he had her in his arms and was steering for the
    private parlour.</p>
  <p>I heard Mrs Bothways calling for water and smelling-salts; she was as fat
    as Watty, and very much like him in the face, but she was emotional and sympathetic.
    Then presently I heard, through the open window, the Pretty Girl say to Jack, &ldquo;Oh,
    Jack, Jack! Why did you go away and leave me like that? It was cruel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you told me to go, Hannah,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that didn&rsquo;t make any difference. Why didn&rsquo;t
    you write?&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because you never wrote to me, Hannah,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that was no excuse!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was so
    k-k-k-cruel of you, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Bothways pulled down the window. A new-comer asked Watty what the trouble
    was, and he said that the Army girl had only found her chap, or husband,
    or long-lost brother or something, but the missus was looking after the business;
    then he dozed again.</p>
  <p>And then we adjourned to the Royal and took the Army with us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way of it,&rdquo; said Donald Macdonald. &ldquo;With
    a woman it&rsquo;s love or religion; with a man it&rsquo;s love or the devil. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or with a man,&rdquo; said Mitchell, presently, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    love and the devil both, sometimes, Donald.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked at Mitchell hard, but for all his face expressed he might only
    have said, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s going to rain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The&nbsp;Imperial Hotel was rather an unfortunate name for an out-back town
    pub, for out back is the stronghold of Australian democracy; it was the out-back
    vote and influence that brought about &ldquo;One Man One Vote,&rdquo; &ldquo;Payment
    of Members,&rdquo; and most of the democratic legislation of late years,
    and from out back came the overwhelming vote in favour of Australian as Imperial
    Federation.</p>
  <p>The name Royal Hotel is as familiar as that of the Railway Hotel, and passes
    unnoticed and ungrowled at, even by bush republicans. The Royal Hotel at
    Bourke was kept by an Irishman, one O&rsquo;Donohoo, who was Union to the
    backbone, loudly in favour of &ldquo;Australia for the Australians,&rdquo; and,
    of course, against even the democratic New South Wales Government of the
    time. He went round town all one St Patrick&rsquo;s morning with a bunch
    of green ribbon fastened to his coat-tail with a large fish-hook, and wasn&rsquo;t
    aware of the fact till he sat down on the point of it. But that&rsquo;s got
    nothing to do with it.</p>
  <p>The Imperial Hotel at Bourke was unpopular from the first. It was said that
    the very existence of the house was the result of a swindle. It had been
    built with money borrowed on certain allotments in the centre of the town
    and on the understanding that it should be built on the mortgaged land, whereas
    it was erected on a free allotment. Which fact was discovered, greatly to
    its surprise, by the building society when it came to foreclose on the allotments
    some years later. While the building was being erected the Bourke people
    understood, in a vague way, that it was to be a convent (perhaps the building
    society thought so, too), and when certain ornaments in brick and cement
    in the shape of a bishop&rsquo;s mitre were placed over the corners of the
    walls the question seemed decided. But when the place was finished a bar
    was fitted up, and up went the sign, to the disgust of the other publicans,
    who didn&rsquo;t know a licence had been taken out&mdash;for licensing didn&rsquo;t
    go by local option in those days. It was rumoured that the place belonged
    to, and the whole business was engineered by, a priest. And priests are men
    of the world.</p>
  <p>The Imperial Hotel was patronized by the pastoralists, the civil servants,
    the bank manager and clerks&mdash;all the scrub aristocracy; it was the headquarters
    of the Pastoralists&rsquo; Union in Bourke; a barracks for blacklegs brought
    up from Sydney to take the place of Union shearers on strike; and the new
    Governor, on his inevitable visit to Bourke, was banqueted at the Imperial
    Hotel. The editor of the local &ldquo;capitalistic rag&rdquo; stayed there;
    the pastoralists&rsquo; member was elected mostly by dark ways and means
    devised at the Imperial Hotel, and one of its managers had stood as a dummy
    candidate to split the Labour vote; the management of the hotel was his reward.
    In short, it was there that most of the plots were hatched to circumvent
    Freedom, and put away or deliver into the clutches of law and order certain
    sons of Light and Liberty who believed in converting blacklegs into jellies
    by force of fists when bribes, gentle persuasion and pure Australian language
    failed to convert them to clean Unionism. The Imperial Hotel was called the &ldquo;Squatters&rsquo; Pub,&rdquo; the  &ldquo;Scabbery,&rdquo; and
    other and more expressive names.</p>
  <p>The hotel became still more unpopular after Percy Douglas had managed it
    for a while. He was an avowed enemy of Labour Unionists. He employed Chinese
    cooks, and that in the height of the anti-Chinese agitation in Australia,
    and he was known to have kindly feelings towards the Afghans who, with their
    camels, were running white carriers off the roads. If an excited Unionist
    called a man a &ldquo;blackleg&rdquo; or &ldquo;scab&rdquo; in the Imperial
    bar he was run out&mdash;sometimes with great difficulty, and occasionally
    as far as the lock-up.</p>
  <p>Percy Douglas was a fine-looking man, &ldquo;wid a chest on him an&rsquo; well
    hung&mdash;a fine fee-<i>gure</i>&nbsp;of a man,&rdquo; as O&rsquo;Donohoo
    pronounced it. He was tall and erect, he dressed well, wore small side-whiskers,
    had an eagle nose, and looked like an aristocrat. Like many of his type,
    who start sometimes as billiard-markers and suddenly become hotel managers
    in Australia, nothing was known of his past. Jack Mitchell reckoned, by the
    way he treated his employees and spoke to workmen, that he was the educated
    son of an English farmer&mdash;gone wrong and sent out to Australia. Someone
    called him &ldquo;Lord Douglas,&rdquo; and the nickname caught on.</p>
  <p>He made himself well hated. He got One-eyed Bogan &ldquo;three months&rsquo;  hard&rdquo; for
    taking a bottle of whisky off the Imperial bar counter because he (Bogan)
    was drunk and thirsty and had knocked down his cheque, and because there
    was no one minding the bar at the moment.</p>
  <p>Lord Douglas dismissed the barmaid, and, as she was leaving, he had her
    boxes searched and gave her in charge for stealing certain articles belonging
    to the hotel. The chaps subscribed to defend the case, and subsequently put
    a few pounds together for the girl. She proved her gratitude by bringing
    a charge of a baby against one of the chaps&mdash;but that was only one of
    the little ways of the world, as Mitchell said. She joined a Chinese camp
    later on.</p>
  <p>Lord Douglas employed a carpenter to do some work about the hotel, and because
    the carpenter left before the job was finished, Lord Douglas locked his tools
    in an outhouse and refused to give them up; and when the carpenter, with
    the spirit of an Australian workman, broke the padlock and removed his tool-chest,
    the landlord gave him in charge for breaking and entering. The chaps defended
    the case and won it, and hated Lord Douglas as much as if he were their elder
    brother. Mitchell was the only one to put in a word for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been puzzling it out,&rdquo; said Mitchell, as he sat
    nursing his best leg in the Union Office, &ldquo;and, as far as I can see,
    it all amounts to this&mdash;we&rsquo;re all mistaken in Lord Douglas. We
    don&rsquo;t know the man. He&rsquo;s all right. We don&rsquo;t understand
    him. He&rsquo;s really a sensitive, good-hearted man who&rsquo;s been shoved
    a bit off the track by the world. It&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s fault&mdash;he&rsquo;s
    not to blame. You see, when he was a youngster he was the most good-natured
    kid in the school; he was always soft, and, consequently, he was always being
    imposed upon, and bullied, and knocked about. Whenever he got a penny to
    buy lollies he&rsquo;d count &rsquo;em out carefully and divide &rsquo;em
    round amongst his schoolmates and brothers and sisters. He was the only one
    that worked at home, and consequently they all hated him. His father respected
    him, but didn&rsquo;t love him, because he wasn&rsquo;t a younger son, and
    wasn&rsquo;t bringing his father&rsquo;s grey hairs down in sorrow to the
    grave. If it was in Australia, probably Lord Douglas was an elder son and
    had to do all the hard graft, and teach himself at night, and sleep in a
    bark skillion while his younger brothers benefited&mdash;they were born in
    the new brick house and went to boarding-schools. His mother had a contempt
    for him because he wasn&rsquo;t a black sheep and a prodigal, and, when the
    old man died, the rest of the family got all the stuff and Lord Douglas was
    kicked out because they could do without him now. And the family hated him
    like poison ever afterwards (especially his mother), and spread lies about
    him&mdash;because they had treated him shamefully and because his mouth was
    shut&mdash;they knew he wouldn&rsquo;t speak. Then probably he went in for
    Democracy and worked for Freedom, till Freedom trod on him once too often
    with her hob-nailed boots. Then the chances are, in the end, he was ruined
    by a girl or woman, and driven, against his will, to take refuge in pure
    individualism. He&rsquo;s all right, only we don&rsquo;t appreciate him.
    He&rsquo;s only
    fighting against his old ideals&mdash;his old self that comes up sometimes&mdash;and
    that&rsquo;s what makes him sweat his barmaids and servants, and hate us,
    and run us in; and perhaps when he cuts up extra rough it&rsquo;s because
    his conscience kicks him when he thinks of the damned soft fool he used to
    be. He&rsquo;s all right&mdash;take my word for it. It&rsquo;s all a mask.
    Why, he might be one of the kindest-hearted men in Bourke underneath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hall rubbed his head and blinked, as if he was worried by an idea that
    there might be some facts in Mitchell&rsquo;s theories.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re allers findin&rsquo; excuses for blacklegs an&rsquo; scabs,
    Mitchell,&rdquo;  said Barcoo-Rot, who took Mitchell seriously (and who would
    have taken a laughing jackass seriously). &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;d find a
    white spot on a squatter. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you blacklegged
    yourself in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was an unpardonable insult, from a Union point of view, and the chaps
    half-unconsciously made room on the floor for Barcoo-Rot to fall after Jack
    Mitchell hit him. But Mitchell took the insult philosophically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Barcoo-Rot,&rdquo; he said, nursing the other leg, &ldquo;for
    the matter of that, I did find a white spot on a squatter once. He lent me
    a quid when I was hard up. There&rsquo;s white spots on the blackest characters
    if you only drop prejudice and look close enough. I suppose even Jack-the-Ripper&rsquo;s
    character was speckled. Why, I can even see spots on your character, some
    times, Barcoo-Rot. I&rsquo;ve known white spots to spread on chaps&rsquo; characters
    until they were little short of saints. Sometimes I even fancy I can feel
    my own wings sprouting. And as for turning blackleg&mdash;well, I suppose
    I&rsquo;ve got a bit of the crawler in my composition (most of us have),
    and a man never knows what might happen to his principles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Barcoo-Rot, &ldquo;I beg yer pardon&mdash;ain&rsquo;t
    that enough?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;you ought to wear a three-bushel
    bag and ashes for three months, and drink water; but since the police would
    send you to an asylum if you did that, I think the best thing we can do is
    to go out and have a drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Lord Douglas married an Australian girl somewhere, somehow, and brought
    her to Bourke, and there were two little girls&mdash;regular little fairies.
    She was a gentle, kind-hearted little woman, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to
    improve him much, save that he was very good to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mostly that way,&rdquo; commented Mitchell. &ldquo;When
    a boss gets married and has children he thinks he&rsquo;s got a greater right
    to grind his fellowmen and rob their wives and children. I&rsquo;d never
    work for a boss with a big family&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard enough to keep a
    single boss nowadays in this country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After one stormy election, at the end of a long and bitter shearing strike,
    One-eyed Bogan, his trusty enemy, Barcoo-Rot, and one or two other enthusiastic
    reformers were charged with rioting, and got from one to three months&rsquo; hard.
    And they had only smashed three windows of the Imperial Hotel and chased
    the Chinese cook into the river.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I used to have some hopes for Democracy,&rdquo; commented Mitchell,  &ldquo;but
    I&rsquo;ve got none now. How can you expect Liberty, Equality or Fraternity&mdash;how
    can you expect Freedom and Universal Brotherhood and Equal Rights in a country
    where Sons of Light get three months&rsquo; hard for breaking windows and
    bashing a Chinaman? It almost makes me long to sail away in a gallant barque.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were other cases in connection with the rotten-egging of Capitalistic
    candidates on the Imperial Hotel balcony, and it was partly on the evidence
    of Douglas and his friends that certain respectable Labour leaders got heavy
    terms of imprisonment for rioting and &ldquo;sedition&rdquo; and &ldquo;inciting,&rdquo; in
    connection with organized attacks on blacklegs and their escorts.</p>
  <p>Retribution, if it was retribution, came suddenly and in a most unexpected
    manner to Lord Douglas.</p>
  <p>It seems he employed a second carpenter for six months to repair and make
    certain additions to the hotel, and put him off under various pretences until
    he owed him a hundred pounds or thereabout. At last, immediately after an
    exciting interview with Lord Douglas, the carpenter died suddenly of heart
    disease. The widow, a strong-minded bushwoman, put a bailiff in the hotel
    on a very short notice&mdash;and against the advice of her lawyer, who thought
    the case hopeless&mdash;and the Lord Douglas bubble promptly burst. He had
    somehow come to be regarded as the proprietor of the hotel, but now the real
    proprietors or proprietor&mdash;he was still said to be a priest&mdash;turned
    Douglas out and put in a new manager. The old servants were paid after some
    trouble. The local storekeepers and one or two firms in Sydney, who had large
    accounts against the Imperial Hotel (and had trusted it, mainly because it
    was patronized by Capitalism and Fat), were never paid.</p>
  <p>Lord Douglas cleared out to Sydney, leaving his wife and children, for the
    present, with her brother, a hay-and-corn storekeeper, who also had a large
    and hopeless account against the hotel; and when the brother went broke and
    left the district she rented a two-roomed cottage and took in dressmaking.</p>
  <p>Dressmaking didn&rsquo;t pay so well in the bush then as it did in the old
    diggings days when sewing-machines were scarce and the possession of one
    meant an independent living to any girl&mdash;when diggers paid ten shillings
    for a strip of &ldquo;flannen&rdquo; doubled over and sewn together, with
    holes for arms and head, and called a shirt. Mrs Douglas had a hard time,
    with her two little girls, who were still better and more prettily dressed
    than any other children in Bourke. One grocer still called on her for orders
    and pretended to be satisfied to wait &ldquo;till Mr Douglas came back,&rdquo; and
    when she would no longer order what he considered sufficient provisions for
    her and the children, and commenced buying sugar, etc., by the pound, for
    cash, he one day sent a box of groceries round to her. He pretended it was
    a mistake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be very much obliged if
    you could use  &rsquo;em, Mrs Douglas. I&rsquo;m overstocked now; haven&rsquo;t
    got room for another tin of sardines in the shop. Don&rsquo;t you worry about
    bills, Mrs Douglas; I can wait till Douglas comes home. I did well enough
    out of the Imperial Hotel when your husband had it, and a pound&rsquo;s worth
    of groceries won&rsquo;t hurt me now. I&rsquo;m only too glad to get rid
    of some of the stock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She cried a little, thought of the children, and kept the groceries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll be sold up soon meself if things don&rsquo;t
    git brighter,&rdquo; said that grocer to a friend, &ldquo;so it doesn&rsquo;t
    matter much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The same with Foley the butcher, who had a brogue with a sort of drawling
    groan in it, and was a cynic of the Mitchell school.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s as proud as the devil,
    but when I send round a bit o&rsquo; rawst, or porrk, or the undercut o&rsquo; the
    blade-bawn, she thinks o&rsquo; the little gur-r-rls before she thinks o&rsquo; sendin&rsquo; it
    back to me. That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve got the pull on her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Giraffe borrowed a horse and tip-dray one day at the beginning of winter
    and cut a load of firewood in the bush, and next morning, at daylight, Mrs
    Douglas was nearly startled out of her life by a crash at the end of the
    cottage, which made her think that the chimney had fallen in, or a tree fallen
    on the house; and when she slipped on a wrapper and looked out, she saw a
    load of short-cut wood by the chimney, and caught a glimpse of the back view
    of the Giraffe, who stood in the dray with his legs wide apart and was disappearing
    into the edge of the scrub; and soon the rapid clock-clock-clock of the wheels
    died away in the west, as if he were making for West Australia.</p>
  <p>The next we heard of Lord Douglas he had got two years&rsquo; hard for embezzlement
    in connection with some canvassing he had taken up. Mrs Douglas fell ill&mdash;a
    touch of brain-fever&mdash;and one of the labourers&rsquo; wives took care
    of the children while two others took turns in nursing. While she was recovering,
    Bob Brothers sent round the hat, and, after a conclave in the Union Office&mdash;as
    mysterious as any meeting ever called with the object of downing bloated
    Capitalism&mdash;it was discovered that one of the chaps&mdash;who didn&rsquo;t
    wish his name to be mentioned&mdash;had borrowed just twenty-five pounds
    from Lord Douglas in the old days and now wished to return it to Mrs Douglas.
    So the thing was managed, and if she had any suspicions she kept them to
    herself. She started a little fancy goods shop and got along fairly comfortable.</p>
  <p>Douglas, by the way, was, publicly, supposed, for her sake and because of
    the little girls, to be away in West Australia on the goldfields.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Time passes without much notice out back, and one hot day, when the sun
    hung behind the fierce sandstorms from the northwest as dully lurid as he
    ever showed in a London fog, Lord Douglas got out of the train that had just
    finished its five-hundred-miles&rsquo; run, and not seeing a new-chum porter,
    who started forward by force of habit to take his bag, he walked stiffly
    off the platform and down the main street towards his wife&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
  <p>He was very gaunt, and his eyes, to those who passed him closely, seemed
    to have a furtive, hunted expression. He had let his beard grow, and it had
    grown grey.</p>
  <p>It was within a few days of Christmas&mdash;the same Christmas that we lost
    the Pretty Girl in the Salvation Army. As a rule the big shearing-sheds within
    a fortnight of Bourke cut out in time for the shearers to reach the town
    and have their Christmas dinners and sprees&mdash;and for some of them to
    be locked up over Christmas Day&mdash;within sound of a church-going bell.
    Most of the chaps gathered in the Shearers&rsquo; Union Office on New Year&rsquo;s
    Eve and discussed Douglas amongst other things.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I vote we kick the cow out of the town!&rdquo; snarled One-eyed Bogan,
    viciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Bob Brothers (the Giraffe), speaking
    more promptly than usual. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s his wife and youngsters to
    consider, yer know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He something well deserted his wife,&rdquo; snarled Bogan, &ldquo;an&rsquo; now
    he comes crawlin&rsquo; back to her to keep him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, mildly, &ldquo;but we ain&rsquo;t all
    got as much against him as you have, Bogan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He made a crimson jail-bird of me!&rdquo; snapped Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;that didn&rsquo;t hurt you much,
    anyway; it rather improved your character if anything. Besides, he made a
    jail-bird of himself afterwards, so you ought to have a fellow-feeling&mdash;a
    feathered feeling, so to speak. Now you needn&rsquo;t be offended, Bogan,
    we&rsquo;re all jail-birds at heart, only we haven&rsquo;t all got the pluck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in favour of blanky well tarrin&rsquo; an&rsquo; featherin&rsquo; him
    an&rsquo;  kickin&rsquo; him out of the town!&rdquo; shouted Bogan. &ldquo;It
    would be a good turn to his wife, too; she&rsquo;d be well rid of the &mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s fond of him,&rdquo; suggested Mitchell; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    known such cases before. I saw them sitting together on the veranda last
    night when they thought no one was looking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He deserted her,&rdquo; said One-eyed Bogan, in a climbingdown tone,  &ldquo;and
    left her to starve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps the police were to blame for that,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;You
    know you deserted all your old mates once for three months, Bogan, and it
    wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He seems to be a crimson pet of yours, Jack Mitchell,&rdquo; said
    Bogan, firing up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, all I know,&rdquo; said Mitchell, standing up and stretching
    himself wearily, &ldquo;all I know is that he looked like a gentleman once,
    and treated us like a gentleman, and cheated us like a gentleman, and ran
    some of us in like a gentleman, and, as far as I can see, he&rsquo;s served
    his time like a gentleman and come back to face us and live himself down
    like a man. I always had a sneaking regard for a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Mitchell, I&rsquo;m beginning to think you are a gentleman yourself,&rdquo; said
    Jake Boreham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I used to have a suspicion once
    that I had a drop of blue blood in me somewhere, and it worried me a lot;
    but I asked my old mother about it one day, and she scalded me&mdash;God
    bless her!&mdash;and father chased me with a stockwhip, so I gave up making
    inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll join the bloomin&rsquo; Capitalists next,&rdquo; sneered
    Oneeyed Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish I could, Bogan,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take
    a trip to Paris and see for myself whether the Frenchwomen are as bad as
    they&rsquo;re made out to be, or go to Japan. But what are we going to do
    about Douglas?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kick the skunk out of town, or boycott him!&rdquo; said one or two. &ldquo;He
    ought to be tarred and feathered and hanged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t do worse than hang him,&rdquo; commented Jake Boreham,
    cheerfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we could,&rdquo; said Mitchell, sitting down, resting his
    elbows on his knees, and marking his points with one forefinger on the other.  &ldquo;For
    instance, we might boil him slow in tar. We might skin him alive. We might
    put him in a cage and poke him with sticks, with his wife and children in
    another cage to look on and enjoy the fun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chaps, who had been sitting quietly listening to Mitchell, and grinning,
    suddenly became serious and shifted their positions uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I can tell you what would hurt his feelings more than anything
    else we could do,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what is it, Jack?&rdquo; said Tom Hall, rather impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send round the hat and take up a collection for him,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, &ldquo;enough to let him get away with his wife and children and
    start life again in some less respectable town than Bourke. You needn&rsquo;t
    grin, I&rsquo;m serious about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a thoughtful pause, and one or two scratched their heads.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His wife seems pretty sick,&rdquo; Mitchell went on in a reflective
    tone. &ldquo;I passed the place this morning and saw him scrubbing out the
    floor. He&rsquo;s been doing a bit of house-painting for old Heegard to-day.
    I suppose he learnt it in jail. I saw him at work and touched my hat to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Tom Hall, affecting to shrink from Mitchell in
    horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I didn&rsquo;t
    take my hat off. Now I know it&rsquo;s not bush religion for a man to touch
    his hat, except to a funeral, or a strange roof or woman sometimes; but when
    I meet a braver man than myself I salute him. I&rsquo;ve only met two in
    my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And who were they, Jack?&rdquo; asked Jake Boreham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One,&rdquo; said Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;one is Douglas, and the other&mdash;well,
    the other was the man I used to be. But that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But perhaps Douglas thought you were crowing over him when you took
    off your hat to him&mdash;sneerin&rsquo; at him, like, Mitchell,&rdquo; reflected
    Jake Boreham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Jake,&rdquo; said Mitchell, growing serious suddenly. &ldquo;There
    are ways of doing things that another man understands. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>They all thought for a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom Hall, &ldquo;supposing we do take up a collection
    for him, he&rsquo;d be too damned proud to take it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve got the pull on him,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, brightening up. &ldquo;I heard Dr Morgan say that Mrs Douglas wouldn&rsquo;t
    live if she wasn&rsquo;t sent away to a cooler place, and Douglas knows it;
    and, besides, one of the little girls is sick. We&rsquo;ve got him in a corner
    and he&rsquo;ll have to take the stuff. Besides, two years in jail takes
    a lot of the pride out of a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll give a sprat to help the man
    who tried his best to crush the Unions!&rdquo; said One-eyed Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damned if I will either!&rdquo; said Barcoo-Rot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, One-eyed Bogan,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    like to harp on old things, for I know they bore you, but when you returned
    to public life that time no one talked of kicking you out of the town. In
    fact, I heard that the chaps put a few pounds together to help you get away
    for a while till you got over your modesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No one spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I passed Douglas&rsquo;s place on my way here from my camp to-night,&rdquo;  Mitchell
    went on musingly, &ldquo;and I saw him walking up and down in the yard with
    his sick child in his arms. You remember that little girl, Bogan? I saw her
    run and pick up your hat and give it to you one day when you were trying
    to put it on with your feet. You remember, Bogan? The shock nearly sobered
    you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a very awkward pause. The position had become too psychological
    altogether and had to be ended somehow. The awkward silence had to be broken,
    and Bogan broke it.</p>
  <p>He turned up Bob Brothers&rsquo;s hat, which was lying on the table, and  &ldquo;chucked&rdquo; in
    a &ldquo;quid,&rdquo; qualifying the hat and the quid, and disguising his
    feelings with the national oath of the land.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had enough of this gory, maudlin, sentimental tommy-rot,&rdquo;  he
    said. &ldquo;Here, Barcoo, stump up or I&rsquo;ll belt it out of your hide!
    I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take yer to pieces!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Douglas didn&rsquo;t leave the town. He sent his wife and children to
    Sydney until the heat wave was past, built a new room on to the cottage,
    and started a book and newspaper shop, and a poultry farm in the back paddock,
    and flourished.</p>
  <p>They called him Mr Douglas for a while, then Douglas, then Percy Douglas,
    and now he is well-known as Old Daddy Douglas, and the Sydney&nbsp;<i>Worker</i>,&nbsp;<i>Truth</i>,
    and&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>, and other democratic rags are on sale at his shop.
    He is big with schemes for locking the Darling River, and he gets his drink
    at O&rsquo;Donohoo&rsquo;s. He is scarcely yet regarded as a straight-out
    democrat. He was a gentleman once, Mitchell said, and the old blood was not
    to be trusted. But, last elections, Douglas worked quietly for Unionism,
    and gave the leaders certain hints, and put them up to various electioneering
    dodges which enabled them to return, in the face of Monopoly, a Labour member
    who is as likely to go straight as long as any other Labour member.</p>

  <p>I&nbsp;met&nbsp;with Jack Cornstalk in London to-day,<br>
    He saw me and coo-eed from over the way.<br>
    Oh! the solemn-faced Londoners stared with surprise<br>
    At his hair and his height as compared with his size!<br>
    For his trousers were short and his collar was low,<br>
    And&mdash;there&rsquo;s not room to coo-ee in London, I know</p>
  <p>But I said to him, &lsquo;Jack!&rsquo; as he gripped my hand fast,<br>
  &lsquo;Oh, I hear that our Country&rsquo;s a nation at last!<br>
  &lsquo;I hear they have launched the new ship of the State,<br>
  &lsquo;And with men at the wheel who are steering it straight.<br>
  &lsquo;I hear &rsquo;twas the vote of your Bush mates and you;<br>
  &lsquo;And, oh, tell me, Jack Cornstalk, if this can be true?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I hear that the bitter black strike times are o&rsquo;er,<br>
  &lsquo;And that Grabbitt and Co. shall crush Labour no more;<br>
  &lsquo;That Australians are first where Australia was last,<br>
  &lsquo;And the day of the foreign adventurer&rsquo;s past;<br>
  &lsquo;That all things are coming we fought for so long;<br>
  &lsquo;And, oh, tell me, Jack Cornstalk, if I have heard wrong?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment he dropped the old grin that he wore&mdash;<br>
    He&rsquo;d a light in his eyes that was not there before&mdash;<br>
    And he reached for my hand, which I gave, nothing loth,<br>
    And replied in two words, and those words were &lsquo;My Oath!<br>
  &lsquo;They are standing up grand, Toby Barton and See,<br>

  (There&rsquo;s something wrong with every ship that sails upon the sea).<br>
  &mdash;<i>The
    Ballad of the Rouseabout</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&nbsp;what became of One-eyed Bogan?&rdquo; I asked Tom Hall when
    I met him and Jack Mitchell down in Sydney with their shearing cheques the
    Christmas before last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better ask Mitchell, Harry,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;He
    can tell you about Bogan better than I can. But first, what about the drink
    we&rsquo;re going to have?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We turned out of Pitt Street into Hunter Street, and across George Street,
    where a double line of fast electric tramway was running, into Margaret Street
    and had a drink at Pfahlert&rsquo;s Hotel, where a counter lunch&mdash;as
    good as many dinners you get for a shilling&mdash;was included with a sixpenny
    drink. &ldquo;Get a quiet corner,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I like to
    hear myself cackle.&rdquo; So we took our beer out in the fernery and got
    a cool place at a little table in a quiet corner amongst the fern boxes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, One-eyed Bogan was a hard case, Mitchell,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t
    he!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell, putting down his &ldquo;long-beer&rdquo; glass, &ldquo;he
    was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather a bad egg!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, a regular bad egg,&rdquo; said Mitchell, decidedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard he got caught cheating at cards,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you!&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Well, I believe he did. Ah,
    well,&rdquo; he added reflectively, after another long pull, &ldquo;One-eyed
    Bogan won&rsquo;t cheat at cards any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Is he dead then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how did that happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He lost the other eye,&rdquo; said Mitchell, and he took another
    drink.  &ldquo;Ah, well, he won&rsquo;t cheat at cards any more&mdash;unless
    there&rsquo;s cards invented for the blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;you see, Harry, it was this way.
    Bogan went pretty free in Bourke after the shearing before last, and in the
    end he got mixed up in a very ugly-looking business: he was accused of doing
    two new-chum jackeroos out of their stuff by some sort of confidence trick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confidence trick,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never have thought
    that One-eyed Bogan had the brains to go in for that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it seems he had, or else he used somebody else&rsquo;s brains;
    there&rsquo;s plenty of broken-down English gentlemen sharpers knocking about
    out back, you know, and Bogan might have been taking lessons from one. I
    don&rsquo;t know the rights of the case, it was hushed up, as you&rsquo;ll
    see presently; but, anyway, the jackeroos swore that Bogan had done &rsquo;em
    out of ten quid. They were both Cockneys and I suppose they reckoned themselves
    smart, but bushmen have more time to think. Besides, Bogan&rsquo;s one eye
    was in his favour. You see he always kept his one eye fixed strictly on whatever
    business he had in hand; if he&rsquo;d had another eye to rove round and
    distract his attention and look at things on the outside, the chances are
    he would never have got into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that, Jack,&rdquo; said Tom Hall. &ldquo;Harry wants to
    hear the yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, to make it short, one of the jackeroos went to the police and
    Bogan cleared out. His character was pretty bad just then, so there was a
    piece of blue paper out for him. Bogan didn&rsquo;t seem to think the thing
    was so serious as it was, for he only went a few miles down the river and
    camped with his horses on a sort of island inside an anabranch, till the
    thing should blow over or the new chums leave Bourke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bogan&rsquo;s old enemy, Constable Campbell, got wind of Bogan&rsquo;s
    camp, and started out after him. He rode round the outside track and came
    in on to the river just below where the anabranch joins it, at the lower
    end of the island and right opposite Bogan&rsquo;s camp. You know what those
    billabongs are dry gullies till the river rises from the Queensland rains
    and backs them up till the water runs round into the river again and makes
    anabranches of &rsquo;em&mdash;places that you thought were hollows you&rsquo;ll
    find above water, and you can row over places you thought were hills. There&rsquo;s
    no water so treacherous and deceitful as you&rsquo;ll find in some of those
    billabongs. A man starts to ride across a place where he thinks the water
    is just over the grass, and blunders into a deep channel&mdash;that wasn&rsquo;t
    there before&mdash;with a steady undercurrent with the whole weight of the
    Darling River funnelled into it; and if he can&rsquo;t swim and his horse
    isn&rsquo;t used to it&mdash;or sometimes if he can swim&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    a case with him, and the Darling River cod hold an inquest on him, if they
    have time, before he&rsquo;s burried deep in Darling River mud for ever.
    And somebody advertises in the missing column for Jack Somebody who was last
    heard of in Australia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that, Mitchell, go on,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Campbell knew the river and saw that there was a stiff current
    there, so he hailed Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good day, Campbell,&rsquo; shouted Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want you, Bogan,&rsquo; said Campbell. &lsquo;Come across
    and bring your horses.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I will,&rsquo; says Bogan. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
    not going to catch me death o&rsquo; cold to save your skin. If you want
    me you&rsquo;ll have to bloody well come and git me.&rsquo; Bogan was a good
    strong swimmer, and he had good horses, but he didn&rsquo;t try to get away&mdash;I
    suppose he reckoned he&rsquo;d have to face the music one time or another&mdash;and
    one time is as good as another out back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Campbell was no swimmer; he had no temptation to risk his life&mdash;you
    see it wasn&rsquo;t as in war with a lot of comrades watching ready to advertise
    a man as a coward for staying alive&mdash;so he argued with Bogan and tried
    to get him to listen to reason, and swore at him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make
    it damned hot for you, Bogan,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if I have to come over
    for you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Two can play at that game,&rsquo; says Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, Bogan,&rdquo; said Campbell, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. If you give me your word that you&rsquo;ll come
    up to the police station to-morrow I&rsquo;ll go back and say nothing about
    it. You can say you didn&rsquo;t know a warrant was out after you. It will
    be all the better for you in the end. Better give me your word, man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps Campbell knew Bogan better than any of us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now then, Bogan,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be a fool.
    Give your word like a sensible man, and I&rsquo;ll go back. I&rsquo;ll give
    you five minutes to make up your mind.&rsquo; And he took out his watch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Bogan was nasty and wouldn&rsquo;t give his word, so there was
    nothing for it but for Campbell to make a try for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Campbell had plenty of pluck, or obstinacy, which amounts to the
    same thing. He put his carbine and revolver under a log, out of the rain
    that was coming on, saw to his handcuffs, and then spurred his horse into
    the water. Bogan lit his pipe with a stick from his camp-fire&mdash;so Campbell
    said afterwards&mdash;and sat down on his heels and puffed away, and waited
    for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as Campbell&rsquo;s horse floundered into the current Bogan
    shouted to go back, but Campbell thought it was a threat and kept on. But
    Bogan had caught sight of a log coming down the stream, end on, with a sharp,
    splintered end, and before Campbell knew where he was, the sharp end of the
    log caught the horse in the flank. The horse started to plunge and struggle
    sideways, with all his legs, and Campbell got free of him as quick as he
    could. Now, you know, in some of those Darling River reaches the current
    will seem to run steadily for a while, and then come with a rush. (I was
    caught in one of those rushes once, when I was in swimming, and would have
    been drowned if I hadn&rsquo;t been born to be hanged.) Well, a rush came
    along just as Campbell got free from his horse, and he went down-stream one
    side of a snag and his horse the other. Campbell&rsquo;s pretty stout, you
    know, and his uniform was tight, and it handicapped him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as he was being washed past the lower end of the snag he caught
    hold of a branch that stuck out of the water and held on. He swung round
    and saw Bogan running down to the point opposite him. Now, you know there
    was always a lot of low cunning about Bogan, and I suppose he reckoned that
    if he pulled Campbell out he&rsquo;d stand a good show of getting clear of
    his trouble; anyway, if he didn&rsquo;t save Campbell it might be said that
    he killed him&mdash;besides, Bogan was a good swimmer, so there wasn&rsquo;t
    any heroism about it anyhow. Campbell was only a few feet from the bank,
    but Bogan started to strip&mdash;to make the job look as big as possible,
    I suppose. He shouted to Campbell to say he was coming, and to hold on.</p>
  <p>Campbell said afterwards that Bogan seemed an hour undressing. The weight
    of the current was forcing down the bough that Campbell was hanging on to,
    and suddenly, he said, he felt a great feeling of helplessness take him by
    the shoulders. He yelled to Bogan and let go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, it happened that Jake Boreham and I were passing away the time
    between shearings, and we were having a sort of fishing and shooting loaf
    down the river in a boat arrangement that Jake had made out of boards and
    tarred canvas. We called her the&nbsp;<i>Jolly Coffin</i>. We were just poking
    up the bank in the slack water, a few hundred yards below the billabong,
    when Jake said, &lsquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a horse or something in the river.&rsquo; Then
    he shouted,  &lsquo;No, by God, it&rsquo;s a man,&rsquo; and we poked the&nbsp;<i>Coffin</i>&nbsp;out
    into the stream for all she was worth. &lsquo;Looks like two men fighting
    in the water,&rsquo; Jake shouts presently. &lsquo;Hurry up, or they&rsquo;ll
    drown each other.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We hailed &rsquo;em, and Bogan shouted for help. He was treading
    water and holding Campbell up in front of him now in real professional style.
    As soon as he heard us he threw up his arms and splashed a bit&mdash;I reckoned
    he was trying to put as much style as he could into that rescue. But I caught
    a crab, and, before we could get to them, they were washed past into the
    top of a tree that stood well below flood-mark. I pulled the boat&rsquo;s
    head round and let her stern down between the branches. Bogan had one arm
    over a limb and was holding Campbell with the other, and trying to lift him
    higher out of the water. I noticed Bogan&rsquo;s face was bleeding&mdash;there
    was a dead limb stuck in the tree with nasty sharp points on it, and I reckoned
    he&rsquo;d run his face against one of them. Campbell was gasping like a
    codfish out of water, and he was the whitest man I ever saw (except one,
    and he&rsquo;d been drowned for a week). Campbell had the sense to keep still.
    We asked Bogan if he could hold on, and he said he could, but he couldn&rsquo;t
    hold Campbell any longer. So Jake took the oars and I leaned over the stern
    and caught hold of Campbell, and Jake ran the boat into the bank, and we
    got him ashore; then we went back for Bogan and landed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had some whisky and soon brought Campbell round; but Bogan was
    bleeding like a pig from a nasty cut over his good eye, so we bound wet handkerchiefs
    round his eyes and led him to a log and he sat down for a while, holding
    his hand to his eye and groaning. He kept saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m blind,
    mates, I&rsquo;m blind! I&rsquo;ve lost me other eye!&rsquo; but we didn&rsquo;t
    dream it was so bad as that: we kept giving him whisky. We got some dry boughs
    and made a big fire. Then Bogan stood up and held his arms stiff down to
    his sides, opening and shutting his hands as if he was in great pain. And
    I&rsquo;ve often thought since what a different man Bogan seemed without
    his clothes and with the broken bridge of his nose and his eyes covered by
    the handkerchiefs. He was clean shaven, and his mouth and chin are his best
    features, and he&rsquo;s clean limbed and well hung. I often thought afterwards
    that there was something of a blind god about him as he stood there naked
    by the fire on the day he saved Campbell&rsquo;s life&mdash;something that
    reminded me of a statue I saw once in the Art Gallery. (Pity the world isn&rsquo;t
    blinder to a man&rsquo;s worst points.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Presently Jake listened and said, &lsquo;By God, that&rsquo;s lucky!&rsquo; and
    we heard a steamer coming up-river and presently we saw her coming round
    the point with a couple of wool-barges in tow. We got Bogan aboard and got
    some clothes on him, and took him ashore at Bourke to the new hospital. The
    doctors did all they knew, but Bogan was blind for life. He never saw anything
    again&mdash;except &lsquo;a sort of dull white blur,&rsquo; as he called
    it&mdash;or his past life sometimes, I suppose. Perhaps he saw that for the
    first time. Ah, well!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bogan&rsquo;s old enemy, Barcoo-Rot, went to see him in the hospital,
    and Bogan said, &lsquo;Well, Barcoo, I reckon we&rsquo;ve had our last fight.
    I owe you a hiding, but I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m going to pay you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Never
    mind that, Bogan, old man,&rsquo; says Barcoo. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take it
    from anyone yer likes to appoint, if that worries yer; and, look here, Bogan,
    if I can&rsquo;t fight you I can fight for you&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you
    forget it!&rsquo; And Barcoo used to lead Bogan round about town in his spare
    time and tell him all that was going on; and I believe he always had an ear
    cocked in case someone said a word against Bogan&mdash;as if any of the chaps
    would say a word against a blind man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bogan&rsquo;s case was hushed up. The police told us to fix it up
    the best way we could. One of the jackeroos, who reckoned that Bogan had
    swindled him, was a gentleman, and he was the first to throw a quid in the
    Giraffe&rsquo;s hat when it went round for Bogan, but the other jackeroo
    was a cur: he said he wanted the money that Bogan had robbed him of. There
    were two witnesses, but we sent &rsquo;em away, and Tom Hall, there, scared
    the jackeroo. You know Tom was always the best hand we had at persuading
    witnesses in Union cases to go home to see their mothers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did you scare that jackeroo, Tom?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell you about it some other time,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;Bogan was always a good woolsorter,
    so, next shearing, old Baldy Thompson&mdash;(you know Baldy Thompson, Harry,
    of West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Station)&mdash;Baldy had a talk with some of the
    chaps, and took Bogan out in his buggy with him to West-o&rsquo;-Sunday.
    Bogan would sit at the end of the rolling tables, in the shearing-shed, with
    a boy to hand him the fleeces, and he&rsquo;d feel a fleece and tell the
    boy what bin to throw it into; and by and by he began to learn to throw the
    fleeces into the bins himself. And sometimes Baldy would have a sheep brought
    to him and get him to feel the fleece and tell him the quality of it. And
    then again Baldy would talk, just loud enough for Bogan to overhear, and
    swear that he&rsquo;d sooner have Bogan, blind as he was, than half a dozen
    scientific jackeroo experts with all their eyes about them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course Bogan wasn&rsquo;t worth anything much to Baldy, but Baldy
    gave him two pounds a week out of his own pocket, and another quid that we
    made up between us; so he made enough to pull him through the rest of the
    year.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was curious to see how soon he learned to find his way about the
    hut and manage his tea and tucker. It was a rough shed, but everybody was
    eager to steer Bogan about&mdash;and, in fact, two of them had a fight about
    it one day. Baldy and all of us&mdash;and especially visitors when they came&mdash;were
    mighty interested in Bogan; and I reckon we were rather proud of having a
    blind wool-sorter. I reckon Bogan had thirty or forty pairs of eyes watching
    out for him in case he&rsquo;d run against something or fall. It irritated
    him to be messed round too much&mdash;he said a baby would never learn to
    walk if it was held all the time. He reckoned he&rsquo;d learn more in a
    year than a man who&rsquo;d served a lifetime to blindness; but we didn&rsquo;t
    let him wander much&mdash;for fear he&rsquo;d fall into the big rocky waterhole
    there, by accident.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And after the shearing-season Bogan&rsquo;s wife turned up in Bourke&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bogan&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, I never knew
    Bogan was married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither did anyone else,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;But he was.
    Perhaps that was what accounted for Bogan. Sometimes, in his sober moods,
    I used to have an idea that there must have been something behind the Bogan
    to account for him. Perhaps he got trapped&mdash;or got married and found
    out that he&rsquo;d made a mistake&mdash;which is about the worst thing a
    man can find out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except that his wife made the mistake, Mitchell,&rdquo; said Tom
    Hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or that both did,&rdquo; reflected Mitchell. &ldquo;Ah, well!&mdash;never
    mind&mdash;Bogan had been married two or three years. Maybe he got married
    when he was on the spree&mdash;I knew that he used to send money to someone
    in Sydney and I suppose it was her. Anyway, she turned up after he was blind.
    She was a hard-looking woman&mdash;just the sort that might have kept a third-rate
    pub or a sly-grog shop. But you can&rsquo;t judge between husband and wife,
    unless you&rsquo;ve lived in the same house with them&mdash;and under the
    same roofs with their parents right back to Adam for that matter. Anyway,
    she stuck to Bogan all right; she took a little two-roomed cottage and made
    him comfortable&mdash;she&rsquo;s got a sewing-machine and a mangle and takes
    in washing and sewing. She brought a carrotty-headed youngster with her,
    and the first time I saw Bogan sitting on the veranda with that youngster
    on his knee I thought it was a good thing that he was blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because the youngster isn&rsquo;t his,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the look of it&mdash;and by the look on her face, once, when she
    caught me squinting from the kid&rsquo;s face to Bogan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And whose was it!&rdquo; I asked, without thinking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How am I to know?&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;It might be yours
    for all I know&mdash;it&rsquo;s ugly enough, and you never had any taste
    in women. But you mustn&rsquo;t speak of that in Bourke. But there&rsquo;s
    another youngster coming, and I&rsquo;ll swear that&rsquo;ll be Bogan&rsquo;s
    all right.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A curious thing about Bogan is that he&rsquo;s begun to be fidgety
    about his personal appearance&mdash;and you know he wasn&rsquo;t a dood.
    He wears a collar now, and polishes his boots; he wears elasticsides, and
    polishes &rsquo;em himself&mdash;the only thing is that he blackens over
    the elastic. He can do many things for himself, and he&rsquo;s proud of it.
    He says he can see many things that he couldn&rsquo;t see when he had his
    eyes. You seldom hear him swear, save in a friendly way; he seems much gentler,
    but he reckons he would stand a show with Barcoo-Rot even now, if Barcoo
    would stand up in front of him and keep yelling&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;how did Bogan lose the sight of
    his other eye?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sleeping out in the rain when he was drunk,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;He
    got a cold in his eye.&rdquo; Then he asked, suddenly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever see a blind man cry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I have,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;You know Bogan wears goggles
    to hide his eyes&mdash;his wife made him do that. The chaps often used to
    drop round and have a yarn with Bogan and cheer him up, and one evening I
    was sitting smoking with him, and yarning about old times, when he got very
    quiet all of a sudden, and I saw a tear drop from under one of his shutters
    and roll down his cheek. It wasn&rsquo;t the eye he lost saving Campbell&mdash;it
    was the old wall-eye he used to use in the days before he was called &lsquo;One-eyed
    Bogan.&rsquo; I suppose he thought it was dark and that I couldn&rsquo;t
    see his face. (There&rsquo;s a good many people in this world who think you
    can&rsquo;t see because they can&rsquo;t.) It made me feel like I used to
    feel sometimes in the days when I felt things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Mitchell,&rdquo; said Tom Hall, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had
    enough beer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I have,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Besides, I promised
    to send a wire to Jake Boreham to tell him that his mother&rsquo;s dead.
    Jake&rsquo;s shearing at West-o&rsquo;-Sunday; shearing won&rsquo;t be over
    for three or four weeks, and Jake wants an excuse to get away without offending
    old Baldy and come down and have a fly round with us before the holidays
    are over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Down at the telegraph-office Mitchell took a form and filled it in very
    carefully:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Jacob Boreham. West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Station. Bourke.
    <br>
    Come home at once. Mother is dead. In terrible trouble. Father dying.<br>
    &mdash;MARY&nbsp;BOREHAM.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that will do,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;It ought to satisfy
    Baldy, and it won&rsquo;t give Jake too much of a shock, because he hasn&rsquo;t
    got a sister or sister-in-law, and his father and mother&rsquo;s been dead
    over ten years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, if I was running a theatre,&rdquo; said Mitchell, as we left
    the office, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give five pounds a night for the face Jake&rsquo;ll
    have on him when he takes that telegram to Baldy Thompson.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TwoSundowners"></a>Two Sundowners</b></h2>
  <p>Sheep&nbsp;stations in Australia are any distance from twenty to a hundred
    miles apart, to keep well within the boundaries of truth and the great pastoral
    country. Shearing at any one shed only lasts a few weeks in the year; the
    number of men employed is according to the size of the shed&mdash;from three
    to five men in the little bough-covered shed of the small &ldquo;cockatoo,&rdquo; up
    to a hundred and fifty or two hundred hands all told in the big corrugated
    iron machine shed of a pastoral company.</p>
  <p>Shearing starts early up in northern Queensland, where you can get a &ldquo;January
    shed;&rdquo; and further south, in February, March or April sheds, and so
    on down into New South Wales, where shearing often lasts over Christmas.
    Shearers travel from shed to shed; some go a travel season without getting
    a pen, and an unlucky shearer might ride or tramp for several seasons and
    never get hands in wool; and all this explains the existence of the &ldquo;footman&rdquo; with
    his swag and the horseman with his packhorse. They have a rough life, and
    the Australian shearers are certainly the most democratic and perhaps the
    most independent, intelligent and generous body of workmen in the world.</p>
  <p>Shearers at a shed elect their own cook, pay him so much a head, and they
    buy their rations in the lump from the station store; and  &ldquo;travellers,&rdquo; i.e.
    shearers and rouseabouts travelling for work, are invited, as a matter of
    course, to sit down to the shearers&rsquo; table. Also a certain allowance
    of tea, sugar, flour or meat is still made to travellers at most Western
    station stores; so it would be rather surprising if there weren&rsquo;t some
    who travelled on the game. The swagman loafer, or &ldquo;bummer,&rdquo; times
    himself, especially in bad weather, to arrive at the shed just about sundown;
    he is then sure of &ldquo;tea,&rdquo; shelter for the night, breakfast, and
    some tucker from the cook to take him on along the track. Brummy and Swampy
    were sundowners.</p>
  <p>Swampy was a bummer born&mdash;and proud of it. Brummy had drifted down
    to loaferdom, and his nature was soured and his spirit revengeful against
    the world because of the memory of early years wasted at hard work and in
    being honest. Both were short and stout, and both had scrubby beards, but
    Brummy&rsquo;s beard was a dusty black and Swampy&rsquo;s fiery red&mdash;he
    indulged in a monkey-shave sometimes, but his lower face was mostly like
    a patch of coarse stubble with a dying hedge round it. They had travelled
    together for a long time. They seemed at times to hate each other with a
    murderous hatred, but they were too lazy to fight. Sometimes they&rsquo;d
    tramp side by side and growl at each other by the hour, other times they&rsquo;d
    sulk for days; one would push on ahead and the other drop behind until there
    was a mile or two between them; but one always carried the billy, or the
    sugar, or something that was necessary to the comfort of the other, so they&rsquo;d
    come together at sundown. They had travelled together a long time, and perhaps
    that was why they hated each other. They often agreed to part and take different
    tracks, and sometimes they parted&mdash;for a while. They agreed in cadging,
    and cadged in turn. They carried a spare set of tucker-bags, and if, for
    instance, they were out of sugar and had plenty flour and tea, Brummy or
    Swampy would go to the store, boundary-rider&rsquo;s hut, or selector&rsquo;s,
    with the sugar-bag in his hand and the other bags in his shirt front on spec.
    He&rsquo;d get the sugar first, and then, if it looked good enough, the flour-bag
    would come out, then the tea-bag. And before he left he&rsquo;d remark casually
    that he and his mate hadn&rsquo;t had a smoke for two days. They never missed
    a chance. And when they&rsquo;d cadged more tucker than they could comfortably
    carry, they&rsquo;d camp for a day or two and eat it down. Sometimes they&rsquo;d
    have as much as a pound of tobacco, all in little &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; bits,
    cut from the sticks or cakes of honest travellers. They never missed a chance.
    If a stranger gave Swampy his cake of tobacco with instructions to &ldquo;cut
    off a pipeful,&rdquo; Swampy would cut off as much as he thought judicious,
    talking to the stranger and watching his eye all the time, and hiding his
    palm as much as possible&mdash;and sometimes, when he knew he&rsquo;d cut
    off more than he could cram into his pipe, he&rsquo;d put his hand in his
    pocket for the pipe and drop some of the tobacco there. Then he&rsquo;d hand
    the plug to his mate, engage the stranger in conversation and try to hold
    his eye or detract his attention from Brummy so as to give Brummy a chance
    of cutting off a couple of pipefuls, and, maybe, nicking off a corner of
    the cake and slipping it into his pocket. I once heard a bushman say that
    no one but a skunk would be guilty of this tobacco trick&mdash;that it is
    about the meanest trick a man could be capable of&mdash;<i>because it spoils
    the chances of the next hard-up swaggy who asks the victim for tobacco</i>.</p>
  <p>When Brummy and Swampy came to a shed where shearing was in full swing,
    they&rsquo;d inquire, first thing, and with some show of anxiety, if there
    was any chance of gettin&rsquo; on; if the shed was full-handed they&rsquo;d
    growl about hard times, wonder what the country was coming to; talk of their
    missuses and kids that they&rsquo;d left in Sydney, curse the squatters and
    the Government, and, next morning, get a supply of rations from the cook
    and depart with looks of gloom. If, on the other hand, there was room in
    the shed for one or both of them, and the boss told them to go to work in
    the morning, they&rsquo;d keep it quiet from the cook if possible, and depart,
    after breakfast, unostentatiously.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, at the beginning of a drought, when the tall dead grass was like
    tinder for hundreds of miles and a carelessly-dropped match would set the
    whole country on fire, Swampy would strike a hard-faced squatter, manager
    or overseer with a cold eye, and the conversation would be somewhat as follows</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Good day, boss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss (shortly): &ldquo;&rsquo;Day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Any chance of a job?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw. Got all I want and we don&rsquo;t start for a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Can I git a bit o&rsquo; meat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw! Don&rsquo;t kill till Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Pint o&rsquo; flour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw. Short ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Bit o&rsquo; tea or sugar, boss?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw&mdash;what next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Bit o&rsquo; baccer, boss. Ain&rsquo;t had a smoke for a
    week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw. Ain&rsquo;t got enough for meself till the wagon comes
    out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Ah, well! It&rsquo;s hot, ain&rsquo;t it, boss?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Country very dry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Yes. Looks like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;A fire &rsquo;ud be very bad just now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Yes. Now I&rsquo;m allers very careful with matches an&rsquo; fire
    when I&rsquo;m on the track.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Are yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Yes. I never lights a fire near the grass&mdash;allers in
    the middle of the track&mdash;it&rsquo;s the safest place yer can get. An&rsquo; I
    allers puts the fire out afore I leaves the camp. If there ain&rsquo;t no
    water ter spare I covers the ashes with dirt. An&rsquo; some fellers are
    so careless with matches lightin&rsquo;  their pipes.&rdquo; (Reflective
    pause.)</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Yes. Now, when I lights me pipe on the track in dry weather
    I allers rubs the match head up an&rsquo; drops it in the dust. I never drops
    a burnin&rsquo; match. But some travellers is so careless. A chap might light
    his pipe an&rsquo; fling the match away without thinkin&rsquo; an&rsquo; the
    match might fall in a dry tuft, an&rsquo;&mdash;there yer are!&rdquo; (with
    a wave of his arms). &ldquo;Hundreds of miles o&rsquo;  grass gone an&rsquo; thousands
    o&rsquo; sheep starvin&rsquo;. Some fellers is so careless&mdash;they never
    thinks. . . . An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, they don&rsquo;t care if they
    burn the whole country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss (scratching his head reflectively): &ldquo;Ah&mdash;umph!&mdash;You
    can go up to the store and get a bit of tucker. The storekeeper might let
    yer have a bit o&rsquo; tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On one occasion, when they were out of flour and meat; Brummy and Swampy
    came across two other pilgrims camped on a creek, who were also out of flour
    and meat. One of them had tried a surveyors&rsquo; camp a little further
    down, but without success. The surveyors&rsquo; cook had said that he was
    short of flour and meat himself. Brummy tried him&mdash;no luck. Then Swampy
    said&nbsp;<i>he&rsquo;d</i>&nbsp;go and have a try. As luck would have it,
    the surveyors&rsquo; cook was just going to bake; he had got the flour out
    in the dish, put in the salt and baking powder, mixed it up, and had gone
    to the creek for a billy of water when Swampy arrived. While the cook was
    gone Swampy slipped the flour out of the dish into his bag,&nbsp;<i>wiped</i>&nbsp;the
    dish, set it down again, and planted the bag behind a tree at a little distance.
    Then he stood waiting, holding a spare empty bag in his hand. When the cook
    came back he glanced at the dish, lowered the billy of water slowly to the
    ground, scratched his head, and looked at the dish again in a puzzled way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blanked if I didn&rsquo;t think I got that flour out!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, mate?&rdquo; asked Swampy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! I could have sworn I got the flour out in the dish and mixed
    it before I went for the water,&rdquo; said the cook, staring at the dish
    again.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rum what tricks your memory plays on you sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Swampy, showing interest, while the cook got some
    more flour out into the dish from a bag in the back of the tent. &ldquo;It
    is strange. I&rsquo;ve done the same thing meself. I suppose it&rsquo;s the
    heat that makes us all a bit off at times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you cook, then?&rdquo; asked the surveyors&rsquo; cook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes. I&rsquo;ve done a good bit of it in me time; but it&rsquo;s
    about played out. I&rsquo;m after stragglers now.&rdquo; (Stragglers are
    stray sheep missed in the general muster and found about the out paddocks
    and shorn after the general shearing.)</p>
  <p>They had a yarn and Swampy &ldquo;bit the cook&rsquo;s ear&rdquo; for a &ldquo;bit
    o&rsquo; meat an&rsquo; tea an&rsquo; sugar,&rdquo; not forgetting &ldquo;a
    handful of flour if yer can spare it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said the cook, &ldquo;but I can only let you have about
    a pint. We&rsquo;re very short ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Swampy, as he put the stuff
    into his spare bags. &ldquo;Thank you! Good day!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said the cook.</p>
  <p>The cook went on with his work and Swampy departed, catching up the bag
    of flour from behind the tree as he passed it, and keeping the clump of timber
    well between him and the surveyors&rsquo; camp, lest the cook should glance
    round, and, noticing the increased bulk of his load, get some new ideas concerning
    mental aberration.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Nearly every bushman has at least one superstition, or notion, that lasts
    his time&mdash;as nearly every bushman has at least one dictionary word which
    lasts him all his life. Brummy had a gloomy notion&mdash;Lord knows how he
    got it!&mdash;that he should &rsquo;a&rsquo; gone on the boards if his people
    hadn&rsquo;t been so ignorant. He reckoned that he had the face and cut of
    an actor, could mimic any man&rsquo;s voice, and had wonderful control over
    his features. They came to a notoriously &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; station, where
    there was a Scottish manager and storekeeper. Brummy went up to &ldquo;government
    house&rdquo; in his own proper person, had a talk with the storekeeper, spoke
    of a sick mate, and got some flour and meat. They camped down the creek,
    and next morning Brummy started to shave himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever are you a-doin&rsquo; of, Brummy?&rdquo; gasped Swampy in
    great astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; growled Brummy, with awful impressiveness, as
    if he were going to cut Swampy&rsquo;s throat after he&rsquo;d finished shaving.
    He shaved off his beard and whiskers, put on a hat and coat belonging to
    Swampy, changed his voice, dropped his shoulders, and went limping up to
    the station on a game leg. He saw the cook and got some &ldquo;brownie,&rdquo; a
    bit of cooked meat and a packet of baking powder. Then he saw the storekeeper
    and approached the tobacco question. Sandy looked at him and listened with
    some slight show of interest, then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s all right now! But ye needn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; troublt
    shavin&rsquo; yer beard&mdash;the cold weather&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; on! An&rsquo; yer
    mate&rsquo;s duds don&rsquo;t suit ye&mdash;they&rsquo;re too sma&rsquo;;
    an&rsquo; yer game leg doesn&rsquo;t fit ye either&mdash;it takes a lot o&rsquo; practice.
    Ha&rsquo; ye got ony tea an&rsquo; sugar? &ldquo;</p>
  <p>Brummy must have touched something responsive in that old Scot somewhere,
    but his lack of emotion upset Brummy somewhat, or else an old deep-rooted
    superstition had been severely shaken. Anyway he let Swampy do the cadging
    for several days thereafter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But one bad season they were very hard up indeed&mdash;even for Brummy and
    Swampy. They&rsquo;d tramped a long hungry track, and had only met a few
    wretched jackeroos, driven out of the cities by hard times, and tramping
    hopelessly west. They were out of tobacco, and their trousers were so hopelessly &ldquo;gone&rdquo;  behind
    that when they went to cadge at a place where there was a woman they were
    moved to back and sidle and edge away again&mdash;and neither Brummy nor
    Swampy was over fastidious in matters of dress or personal appearance. It
    was absolutely necessary to earn a pound or two, so they decided to go to
    work for a couple of weeks. It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt them, and then there was
    the novelty of it.</p>
  <p>They struck West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Station, and the boss happened to want
    a rouseabout to pick up wool and sweep the floor for the shearers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can put&nbsp;<i>one</i>&nbsp;of you on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Fix
    it up between yourselves and go to work in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brummy and Swampy went apart to talk it over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here! Brum, old man,&rdquo; said Swampy, with great heartiness,  &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
    been mates for a long while now, an&rsquo; shared an&rsquo; shared alike.
    You&rsquo;ve allers acted straight to me an&rsquo; I want to do the fair
    thing by you.&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;don&rsquo;t want to stand in&nbsp;<i>your</i>&nbsp;light.
    You take the job an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be satisfied with a pair of pants out
    of it and a bit o&rsquo; tobacco now an&rsquo; agen. There yer are! I can&rsquo;t
    say no fairer than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Brummy, resentfully, &ldquo;an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
    always be throwin&rsquo; it up to me afterwards that I done you out of a
    job!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Swampy, hurriedly. &ldquo;But
    since you&rsquo;re so blasted touchy and suspicious about it,&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;take
    this job an&rsquo;  I&rsquo;ll take the next that turns up. How&rsquo;ll
    that suit you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brummy thought resentfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s settle it
    and have done with this damned sentimental tommy-rot. I&rsquo;ll tell you
    what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give you the job and take my chance.
    The boss might want another man to-morrow. Now, are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Swampy didn&rsquo;t look grateful or happy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; growled Brummy, &ldquo;of all the &mdash;&mdash; I ever
    travelled with you&rsquo;re the &mdash;&mdash;. What do you want anyway?
    What&rsquo;ll satisfy you? That&rsquo;s all I want to know. Hey?&mdash;can&rsquo;t
    yer speak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s toss up for it,&rdquo; said Swampy, sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Brummy, with a big oath, and he felt in his
    pocket for two old pennies he had. But Swampy had got a suspicion somehow
    that one of those pennies had two heads on it, and he wasn&rsquo;t sure that
    the other hadn&rsquo;t two tails&mdash;also, he suspected Brummy of some
    skill in &ldquo;palming,&rdquo; so he picked up a chip from the wood-heap,
    spat on it, and spun it into the air.  &ldquo;Sing out!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;wet
    or dry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dry,&rdquo; said Brummy, promptly. He had a theory that the wet side
    of the chip, being presumably heaviest, was more likely to fall downwards;
    but this time it was &ldquo;wet&rdquo; up three times in succession. Brummy
    ignored Swampy&rsquo;s hand thrown out in hearty congratulation; and next
    morning he went to work in the shed. Swampy camped down the river, and Brummy
    supplied him with a cheap pair of moleskin trousers, tucker and tobacco.
    The shed cut out within three weeks and the two sundowners took the track
    again, Brummy with two pounds odd in his pocket&mdash;he having negotiated
    his cheque at the shed.</p>
  <p>But now there was suspicion, envy, and distrust in the hearts of those two
    wayfarers. Brummy was now a bloated capitalist, and proud, and anxious to
    get rid of Swampy&mdash;at least Swampy thought so. He thought that the least
    that Brummy might have done was to have shared the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; with
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Brummy,&rdquo; he said reproachfully, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
    shared and shared alike, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We never shared money,&rdquo; said Brummy, decidedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think I want yer blasted money?&rdquo; retorted Swampy, indignantly. &ldquo;When
    did I ever ask yer for a sprat? Tell me that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have got it if you had asked,&rdquo; said Brummy,
    uncompromisingly. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; with vehemence. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
    I keep yer in tobacco and buy yer gory pants? What are you naggin&rsquo; about
    anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Swampy, &ldquo;all I was goin&rsquo; to say was
    that yer might let me carry one of them quids in case you lost one&mdash;yer
    know you&rsquo;re careless and lose things; or in case anything happened
    to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to lose it&mdash;if that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s
    fretting you,&rdquo; said Brummy, &ldquo;and there ain&rsquo;t nothing going
    to happen to me&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you forget it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the thanks I get for givin&rsquo; yer my gory job,&rdquo; said
    Swampy, savagely. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be sich a soft fool agen, I can tell
    yer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brummy was silent, and Swampy dropped behind. He brooded darkly, and it&rsquo;s
    a bad thing for a man to brood in the bush. He was reg&rsquo;lar disgusted
    with Brummy. He&rsquo;d allers acted straight to him, and Brummy had acted
    like a  &ldquo;cow.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d stand it no longer; but he&rsquo;d
    have some satisfaction. He wouldn&rsquo;t be a fool. If Brummy was mean skunk
    enough to act to a mate like that, Swampy would be even with him; he would
    wait till Brummy was asleep, collar the stuff, and clear. It was his job,
    anyway, and the money was his by rights. He&rsquo;d have his rights.</p>
  <p>Brummy, who carried the billy, gave Swampy a long tramp before he camped
    and made a fire. They had tea in silence, and smoked moodily apart until
    Brummy turned in. They usually slept on the ground, with a few leaves under
    them, or on the sand where there was any, each wrapped in his own blankets,
    and with their spare clothes, or rags rather, for pillows. Presently Swampy
    turned in and pretended to sleep, but he lay awake watching, and listening
    to Brummy&rsquo;s breathing. When he thought it was safe he moved cautiously
    and slipped his hand under Brummy&rsquo;s head, but Brummy&rsquo;s old pocket-book&mdash;in
    which he carried some dirty old letters in a woman&rsquo;s handwriting&mdash;was
    not there. All next day Swampy watched Brummy sharply every time he put his
    hands into his pockets, to try and find out in which pocket he kept his money.
    Brummy seemed very cheerful and sociable, even considerate, to his mate all
    day, and Swampy pretended to be happy. They yarned more than they had done
    for many a day. Brummy was a heavy sleeper, and that night Swampy went over
    him carefully and felt all his pockets, but without success. Next day Brummy
    seemed in high spirits&mdash;they were nearing Bourke, where they intended
    to loaf round the pubs for a week or two. On the third night Swampy waited
    till about midnight, and then searched Brummy, every inch of him he could
    get at, and tickled him with a straw of grass till he turned over, and ran
    his hands over the other side of him, and over his feet (Brummy slept with
    his socks on), and looked in his boots, and in the billy and in the tucker-bags,
    and felt in every tuft of grass round the camp, and under every bush, and
    down a hollow stump, and up a hollow log: but there was no pocket-book. Brummy
    couldn&rsquo;t have lost the money and kept it dark&mdash;he&rsquo;d have
    gone back to look for it at once. Perhaps he&rsquo;d thrown away the book
    and sewn the money in his clothes somewhere. Swampy crept back to him and
    felt the lining of his hat, and was running his hand over Brummy&rsquo;s
    chest when Brummy suddenly started to snore, and Swampy desisted without
    loss of time. He crept back to bed, breathing short, and thought hard. It
    struck him that there was something aggressive about that snore. He began
    to suspect that Brummy was up to his little game, and it pained him.</p>
  <p>Next morning Brummy was decidedly frivolous. At any other time Swampy would
    have put it down to a &ldquo;touch o&rsquo; the sun,&rdquo; but now he felt
    a growing conviction that Brummy knew what he&rsquo;d been up to the last
    three nights, and the more he thought of it the more it pained him&mdash;till
    at last he could stand it no longer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Brummy,&rdquo; he said frankly, &ldquo;where the hell
    do you keep that flamin&rsquo; stuff o&rsquo; yourn? I been tryin&rsquo; to
    git at it ever since we left West-o&rsquo;-Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know you have, Swampy,&rdquo; said Brummy, affectionately&mdash;as
    if he considered that Swampy had done his best in the interests of mateship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;<i>knowed</i>&nbsp;yer knowed!&rdquo; exclaimed Swampy, triumphantly. &ldquo;But
    where the blazes did yer put it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Under&nbsp;<i>your</i>&nbsp;head, Swampy, old man,&rdquo; said Brummy,
    cheerfully.</p>
  <p>Swampy was hurt now. He commented in the language that used to be used by
    the bullock-punchers of the good days as they pranced up and down by their
    teams and lammed into the bullocks with saplings and crow-bars, and called
    on them to lift a heavy load out of a bog in the bed of a muddy creek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Swampy!&rdquo; said Brummy, soothingly, as his mate paused
    and tried to remember worse oaths. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But they parted at Bourke. Swampy had allers acted straight ter Brummy&mdash;share &rsquo;n&rsquo; share
    alike. He&rsquo;d do as much for a mate as any other man, an&rsquo;  put
    up with as much from a mate. He had put up with a lot from Brummy: he&rsquo;d
    picked him up on the track and learned him all he knowed; Brummy&mdash;would
    have starved many a time if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Swampy; Swampy had learned
    him how to  &ldquo;battle.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d stick to Brummy yet, but he
    couldn&rsquo;t stand ingratitude. He hated low cunnin&rsquo; an&rsquo; suspicion,
    and when a gory mate got suspicious of his own old mate and wouldn&rsquo;t
    trust him, an&rsquo; took to plantin&rsquo; his crimson money&mdash;it was
    time to leave him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ASketchofMateship"></a>A Sketch of Mateship</b></h2>
  <p>Bill&nbsp;and Jim, professional shearers, were coming into Bourke from the
    Queensland side. They were horsemen and had two packhorses. At the last camp
    before Bourke Jim&rsquo;s packhorse got disgusted and home-sick during the
    night and started back for the place where he was foaled. Jim was little
    more than a new-chum jackeroo; he was no bushman and generally got lost when
    he went down the next gully. Bill was a bushman, so it was decided that he
    should go back to look for the horse.</p>
  <p>Now Bill was going to sell his packhorse, a well-bred mare, in Bourke, and
    he was anxious to get her into the yards before the horse sales were over;
    this was to be the last day of the sales. Jim was the best  &ldquo;barracker&rdquo; of
    the two; he had great imagination; he was a very entertaining story-teller
    and conversationalist in social life, and a glib and a most impressive liar
    in business, so it was decided that he should hurry on into Bourke with the
    mare and sell her for Bill. Seven pounds, reserve.</p>
  <p>Next day Bill turned up with the missing horse and saw Jim standing against
    a veranda-post of the Carriers&rsquo; Arms, with his hat down over his eyes,
    and thoughtfully spitting in the dust. Bill rode over to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Bill. I see you got him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I got him.&rsquo;&rsquo; Pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d yer find him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout ten mile back. Near Ford&rsquo;s Bridge. He was just
    feedin&rsquo;  along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pause. Jim shifted his feet and spat in the dust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bill at last. &ldquo;How did you get on, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I sold the mare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;How much did she fetch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight quid;&rdquo; then, rousing himself a little and showing some
    emotion, &ldquo;An&rsquo; I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; got ten quid for her if
    I hadn&rsquo;t been a dam&rsquo; fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s good enough,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; got ten quid if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; waited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no use cryin&rsquo;. Eight quid is good enough.
    Did you get the stuff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. They parted all right. If I hadn&rsquo;t been such a dam&rsquo; fool
    an&rsquo; rushed it, there was a feller that would &rsquo;a&rsquo; given
    ten quid for that mare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t break yer back about it,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;Eight
    is good enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. But I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; got ten,&rdquo; said Jim, languidly,
    putting his hand in his pocket.</p>
  <p>Pause. Bill sat waiting for him to hand over the money; but Jim withdrew
    his hand empty, stretched, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, Bill, I done it in. Lend us a couple o&rsquo; notes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim had been drinking and gambling all night and he&rsquo;d lost the eight
    pounds as well as his own money.</p>
  <p>Bill didn&rsquo;t explode. What was the use? He should have known that Jim
    wasn&rsquo;t to be trusted with money in town. It was he who had been the
    fool. He sighed and lent Jim a pound, and they went in to have a drink.</p>
  <p>Now it strikes me that if this had happened in a civilized country (like
    England) Bill would have had Jim arrested and jailed for larceny as a bailee,
    or embezzlement, or whatever it was. And would Bill or Jim or the world have
    been any better for it?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OntheTuckerTrack"></a>On the Tucker Track</b><br>
  <b>A Steelman Story</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman&nbsp;and Smith, professional wanderers from New Zealand, took a
    run over to Australia one year to have a look at the country, and drifted
    out back, and played cards and &ldquo;headin&rsquo; &rsquo;em&rdquo; at the
    shearing-sheds (while pretending to be strangers to each other), and sold
    eye-water and unpatented medicine, and worked the tucker tracks. They struck
    a streak of bad luck at West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Station, where they were advised
    (by the boss and about fifty excited shearers) to go east, and not to stop
    till they reached the coast. They were tramping along the track towards Bourke;
    they were very hard up and had to &ldquo;battle&rdquo; for tucker and tobacco
    along the track. They came to a lonely shanty, about two camps west of Bourke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn off into the scrub and strike the track the other
    side of the shanty and come back to it,&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;You
    see, if they see us coming into Bourke they&rsquo;ll say to themselves, &lsquo;Oh,
    we&rsquo;re never likely to see these chaps again,&rsquo; and they won&rsquo;t
    give us anything, or, perhaps, only a pinch of tea or sugar in a big lump
    of paper. There&rsquo;s some women that, can never see a tucker-bag, even
    if you hold it right under their noses. But if they see us going out back
    they&rsquo;ll reckon that we&rsquo;ll get a shed likely as not, and we&rsquo;ll
    be sure to call there with our cheques coming back. I hope the old man&rsquo;s
    got the lumbago, or sciatica, or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because whenever I see an old man poking round the place on a stick
    I always make for him straight and inquire about his trouble; and no matter
    what complaint he&rsquo;s got, my old man suffered from it for years. It&rsquo;s
    pretty hard graft listening to an old man with a pet leg, but I find it pays;
    and I always finish up by advising him to try St Jacob&rsquo;s oil. Perhaps
    he&rsquo;s been trying it for years, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter; the consultation
    works out all right all the same, and there&rsquo;s never been a remedy tried
    yet but I&rsquo;ve got another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lot of Maori and blackfellow remedies in my mind,
    and when they fail I can fall back on the Chinese; and if that isn&rsquo;t
    enough I&rsquo;ve got a list of my grandmother&rsquo;s remedies that she
    wrote down for me when I was leaving home, and I kept it for a curiosity.
    It took her three days to write them, and I reckon they&rsquo;ll fill the
    bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want a shave. You look better with that stubble on.
    You needn&rsquo;t say anything; just stand by and wear your usual expression,
    and if they ask me what&rsquo;s the matter with my mate I&rsquo;ll fix up
    a disease for you to have, and get something extra on your account, poor
    beggar!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish we had a chap with us that could sing a bit and run the gamut
    on a fiddle or something. With a sickly-looking fish like you to stand by
    and look interesting and die slowly of consumption all the time, and me to
    do the talking, we&rsquo;d be able to travel from one end of the bush to
    the other and live on the fat of the land. I wouldn&rsquo;t cure you for
    a hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They reached the shanty, and there, sure enough, was an old man pottering
    round with a list to starboard. He was working with a hoe inside a low paling
    fence round a sort of garden. Steelman and Smith stopped outside the fence. &ldquo;Good
    day, boss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So far it was satisfactory.</p>
  <p>He was a little man, with a wiry, red beard. He might have been a Scandinavian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to be a bit lame,&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;Hurt your
    foot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Steelman, &ldquo;lumbago, I suppose? My father suffered
    cruel from it for years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said the old man, moving closer to the fence. &ldquo;It
    ain&rsquo;t in me back; the trouble&rsquo;s with me leg.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;One a bit shorter than the other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes. It seems to be wearin&rsquo; a bit shorter. I must see
    to it. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hip disease, perhaps?&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;A brother o&rsquo; mine
    had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw, it&rsquo;s not in the hip,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;My
    leg&rsquo;s gone at the knee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! stiff joint; I know what that is. Had a touch of it once myself.
    An uncle of mine was nearly crippled with it. He used to use St Jacob&rsquo;s
    oil. Ever try St Jacob&rsquo;s oil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;not that I know of. I&rsquo;ve
    used linseed oil though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Linseed oil!&rdquo; said Steelman; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard
    of that for stiff knee. How do you use it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Use it raw,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Raw linseed oil; I&rsquo;ve
    rubbed it in, and I&rsquo;ve soaked me leg in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Soaked your leg in it!&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;And did it do
    it any good?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it seems to preserve it&mdash;keeps it from warping, and it
    wears better&mdash;and it makes it heavier. It seemed a bit too light before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman nudged Smith under cover of the palings. The old man was evidently
    a bit ratty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well I hope your leg will soon be all right, boss,&rdquo; said Steelman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think
    there&rsquo;s much hope. I suppose you want some tucker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; said Steelman, rather taken aback by the old man&rsquo;s
    sudden way of putting it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hard up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, come along to the house and I&rsquo;ll see if I can get yer
    something,&rdquo; said the old man; and they walked along outside the fence,
    and he hobbled along inside, till he came to a little gate at the corner.
    He opened the gate and stumped out. He had a wooden leg. He wore his trouser-leg
    down over it, and the palings had hidden the bottom from Steelman and Smith.</p>
  <p>He wanted them to stay to dinner, but Steelman didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable,
    and thanked him, and said they&rsquo;d rather be getting on (Steelman always
    spoke for Smith); so the old man gave them some cooked meat, bread, and a
    supply of tea and sugar. Steelman watched his face very close, but he never
    moved a muscle. But when they looked back he was leaning on his hoe, and
    seemed to be shaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Took you back a bit, Steely, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; suggested Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; snorted Steelman, turning on him
    suddenly. &ldquo;I knew a carpenter who used to soak his planes in raw linseed
    oil to preserve them and give them weight. There&rsquo;s nothing funny about
    that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith rubbed his head.</p>

    Of a palace in Australia called The Bulletin Hotel.</p>
  <p>Just a little six-room&rsquo;d shanty built of corrugated tin,<br>

  &rsquo;Tis the club of many lost souls in the wide Westralian hell,<br>
    And the stage of many Mitchells is the Bulletin Hotel.</p>
  <p>But the swagman, on his uppers, pulls an undertaker&rsquo;s mug,<br>
    And he leans across the counter and he breathes in Charlie&rsquo;s lug&mdash;<br>
    Tale of thirst and of misfortune. Charlie knows it, and&mdash;ah, well!<br>
    But it&rsquo;s very bad for business at the Bulletin Hotel.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s a drink or two?&rsquo; says Charlie, &lsquo;and you
    can&rsquo;t refuse a feed;&rsquo;<br>
    But there&rsquo;s many a drink unpaid for, many sticks of &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo; weed;<br>
    And the poor old spineless bummer and the broken-hearted swell<br>
    Know that they are sure of tucker at the Bulletin Hotel.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the liquor and the license and the &lsquo;carriage&rsquo; and

    And the sea or grave &rsquo;twixt Charlie and the fivers he has lent;<br>
    And I&rsquo;m forced to think in sorrow, for I know the country well,<br>

  <p>But he&rsquo;ll pack up in a hurry and he&rsquo;ll seek a cooler clime,<br>

    For a mate o&rsquo; mine is Charlie and I stayed there for a spell,<br>

    an&rsquo; makes me an&rsquo; the missus laugh; an&rsquo; we gives him a bottl&rsquo;er
    rum an&rsquo; a bag of grub ter get rid of him an&rsquo; his rotten ole scarecrow
    tribe&mdash;It all tells up. I was allers soft on the blacks, an&rsquo;,
    beside, a ole gin nursed me an&rsquo; me mother when I was born, an&rsquo; saved
    me blessed life&mdash;not that that mounts to much. But it all tells up,
    an&rsquo; I got me licence ter pay. An&rsquo; some bloody skunk goes an&rsquo; informs
    on me for supplyin&rsquo; the haboriginalls with intossicatin&rsquo; liquor,
    an&rsquo; I have ter pay a fine an&rsquo; risk me licence. But what&rsquo;s
    a man ter do?</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; three or four herrin&rsquo;-gutted jackeroos comes along about
    dinner-time, when the table&rsquo;s set and the cookin&rsquo; smellin&rsquo;  from
    the kichen, with their belts done up three holes, an&rsquo; not the price
    of a feed on &rsquo;em. What&rsquo;s a man ter do? I&rsquo;ve known what
    it is ter do a perish on the track meself. It&rsquo;s not the tucker I think
    on. I don&rsquo;t care a damn for that. When the shearers come every one
    is free to go inter the kitchin an&rsquo; forage for hisself when he feels
    hungry&mdash;so long as he pays for his drink. But the jackeroos can&rsquo;t
    pay for drinks, an&rsquo; I have ter pay carriage on the flour an&rsquo; tea
    an&rsquo;  sugar an&rsquo; groceries&mdash;an&rsquo; it all tells up by the
    end o&rsquo; the year.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; a straight chap that knows me gets a job to take a flock o&rsquo; sheep
    or a mob o&rsquo; cattle ter the bloomin&rsquo; Gulf, or South Australia,
    or somewheers&mdash;an&rsquo; loses one of his horses goin&rsquo; out ter
    take charge, an&rsquo; borrers eight quid from me ter buy another. He&rsquo;ll
    turn up agen in a year or two an&rsquo; most likely want ter make me take
    twenty quid for that eight&mdash;an&rsquo; make everybody about the place
    blind drunk&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve got ter wait, an&rsquo; the wine an&rsquo;  sperit
    merchants an&rsquo; the brewery won&rsquo;t. They know I can&rsquo;t do without
    liquor in the place.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; lars&rsquo; rains Jimmy Nowlett, the bullick-driver, gets bogged
    over his axle-trees back there on the Blacksoil Plains between two flooded
    billerbongs, an&rsquo; prays till the country steams an&rsquo;  his soul&rsquo;s
    busted, an&rsquo; his throat like a lime-kiln. He taps a keg o&rsquo; rum
    or beer ter keep his throat in workin&rsquo; order. I don&rsquo;t mind that
    at all, but him an&rsquo; his mates git flood-bound for near a week, an&rsquo; broach
    more kegs, an&rsquo; go on a howlin&rsquo; spree in ther mud, an&rsquo; spill
    mor&rsquo;n they swipe, an&rsquo; leave a tarpaulin off a load, an&rsquo; the
    flour gets wet, an&rsquo; the sugar runs out of the bags like syrup, an&rsquo;&mdash; What&rsquo;s
    a feller ter do? Do yer expect me to set the law outer Jimmy? I&rsquo;ve
    knowed him all my life, an&rsquo; he knowed my father afore I was born. He&rsquo;s
    been on the roads this forty year, till he&rsquo;s as thin as a rat, and
    as poor as a myall black; an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s got a family ter keep back
    there in Bourke. No, I have ter pay for it in the end, an&rsquo; it all mounts
    up, I can tell yer.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; suppose some poor devil of a new-chum black sheep comes along,
    staggerin&rsquo; from one side of the track to the other, and spoutin&rsquo; poetry;
    dyin&rsquo; o&rsquo; heat or fever, or heartbreak an&rsquo; home-sickness,
    or a life o&rsquo; disserpation he&rsquo;d led in England, an&rsquo; without
    a sprat on him, an&rsquo;  no claim on the bush; an&rsquo; I ketches him
    in me arms as he stumbles inter the bar, an&rsquo; he wants me ter hold him
    up while he turns English inter Greek for me. An&rsquo; I put him ter bed,
    an&rsquo; he gits worse, an&rsquo; I have ter send the buggy twenty mile
    for a doctor&mdash;an&rsquo; pay him. An&rsquo; the jackeroo gits worse,
    an&rsquo; has ter be watched an&rsquo; nursed an&rsquo; held down sometimes;
    an&rsquo; he raves about his home an&rsquo;  mother in England, an&rsquo; the
    blarsted University that he was eddicated at&mdash;an&rsquo; a woman&mdash;an&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; that
    sounds like poetry in French; an&rsquo; he upsets my missus a lot, an&rsquo; makes
    her blubber. An&rsquo; he dies, an&rsquo; I have ter pay a man ter bury him
    (an&rsquo; knock up a sort o&rsquo; fence round the grave arterwards ter
    keep the stock out), an&rsquo; send the buggy agen for a parson, an&rsquo;&mdash;Well,
    what&rsquo;s a man ter do? I couldn&rsquo;t let him wander away an&rsquo; die
    like a dog in the scrub, an&rsquo; be shoved underground like a dog, too,
    if his body was ever found. The Government might pay ter bury him, but there
    ain&rsquo;t never been a pauper funeral from my house yet, an&rsquo; there
    won&rsquo;t be one if I can help it&mdash;except it be meself.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; then there&rsquo;s the bother goin&rsquo; through his papers to
    try an&rsquo; find out who he was an&rsquo; where his friends is. An&rsquo; I
    have ter get the missus to write a letter to his people, an&rsquo; we have
    ter make up lies about how he died ter make it easier for &rsquo;em. An&rsquo; goin&rsquo; through
    his letters, the missus comes across a portrait an&rsquo; a locket of hair,
    an&rsquo; letters from his mother an&rsquo; sisters an&rsquo; girl; an&rsquo; they
    upset her, an&rsquo; she blubbers agin, an&rsquo; gits sentimental-like she
    useter long ago when we was first married.</p>
  <p>There was one bit of poetry&mdash;I forgit it now&mdash;that that there
    jackeroo kep&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; over an&rsquo; over agen till it buzzed
    in me head; an&rsquo;, weeks after, I&rsquo;d ketch the missus mutterin&rsquo; it
    to herself in the kitchen till I thought she was goin&rsquo; ratty.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; we gets a letter from the jackeroo&rsquo;s friends that puts us
    to a lot more bother. I hate havin&rsquo; anythin&rsquo; to do with letters.
    An&rsquo; someone&rsquo;s sure to say he was lambed down an&rsquo; cleaned
    out an&rsquo;  poisoned with bad bush liquor at my place. It&rsquo;s almost
    enough ter make a man wish there was a recorin&rsquo; angel.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the end of it? I got the blazin&rsquo; bailiff in
    the place now! I can&rsquo;t shot him out because he&rsquo;s a decent, hard-up,
    poor devil from Bourke, with consumption or somethin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s
    been talkin&rsquo; to the missus about his missus an&rsquo; kids; an&rsquo; I
    see no chance of gittin&rsquo;  rid of him, unless the shearers come along
    with their cheques from West-o&rsquo;-Sunday nex&rsquo; week and act straight
    by me. Like as not I&rsquo;ll have ter roll up me swag an&rsquo; take the
    track meself in the end. They say publicans are damned, an&rsquo; I think
    so, too; an&rsquo; I wish I&rsquo;d bin operated on before ever I seen a
    pub.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheShearersDream"></a>The Shearer&rsquo;s Dream</b></h2>
  <p>Mitchell&nbsp;and I rolled up our swags after New Year and started
    to tramp west. It had been a very bad season after a long drought. Old Baldy
    Thompson had only shorn a few bales of grass-seed and burrs, so he said,
    and thought of taking the track himself; but we hoped to get on shearing
    stragglers at West-o&rsquo;-Sunday or one of the stations of the Hungerford
    track.</p>
  <p>It was very hot weather, so we started after sunset, intending to travel
    all night. We crossed the big billabong, and were ploughing through the dust
    and sand towards West Bourke, when a buggy full of city girls and swells
    passed by. They were part of a theatrical company on tour in the Back-Blocks,
    and some local Johnnies. They&rsquo;d been driven out to see an artesian
    bore, or wool-shed, or something. The horses swerved, and jerked a little
    squawk out of one of the girls. Then another said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ow-w! Two old swaggies. He! he! he!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I glanced at Mitchell to see if he was hit, and caught his head down; but
    he pulled himself up and pretended to hitch his swag into an easier position.</p>
  <p>About a hundred yards further on he gave me a side look and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did that touch you, Harry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, and I laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; reflected Mitchell, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re more to
    be pitied than blamed. It&rsquo;s their ignorance. In the first place, we&rsquo;re
    not two old tramps, as they think. We are professional shearers; and the
    Australian shearers are about the most independent and intelligent class
    of men in the world. We&rsquo;ve got more genius in one of our little fingers
    than there is in the whole of that wagonette-load of diddle-daddle and fiddle-faddle
    and giggles. Their intellects are on a level with the rotten dramas they
    travel with, and their lives about as false. They are slaves to the public,
    and their home is the pub-parlour, with sickly, senseless Johnnies to shout
    suppers and drink for them and lend their men money. If one of those girls
    is above the average, how she must despise those Johnnies&mdash;and the life!
    She must feel a greater contempt for them than the private-barmaid does for
    the boozer she cleans out. He gets his drink and some enjoyment, anyhow.
    And how she must loathe the life she leads! And what&rsquo;s the end of it
    as often as not? I remember once, when I was a boy, I was walking out with
    two aunts of mine&mdash;they&rsquo;re both dead now. God rest their fussy,
    innocent old souls!&mdash;and one of &rsquo;em said suddenly, &lsquo;Look!
    Quick, Jack! There&rsquo;s Maggie So-and-So, the great actress.&rsquo; And
    I looked and saw a woman training vines in a porch. It seemed like seeing
    an angel to me, and I never forgot her as she was then. The diggers used
    to go miles out of town to meet the coach that brought her, and take the
    horses out and drag it in, and throw gold in her lap, and worship her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The last time I was in Sydney I saw her sitting in the back parlour
    of a third-rate pub. She was dying of dropsy and couldn&rsquo;t move from
    her chair. She showed me a portrait of herself as I remembered her, and talked
    quite seriously about going on the stage again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, our home is about two thousand miles wide, and the world&rsquo;s
    our stage. If the worst comes to the worst we can always get tucker and wood
    and water for nothing. If we&rsquo;re camping at a job in a tent there&rsquo;s
    no house-cleaning to bother us. All we&rsquo;ve got to do when the camp gets
    too dirty is to shift the tent to a fresh place. We&rsquo;ve got time to
    think and we&rsquo;re free.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then, agen,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s
    point of view to be considered. Some day I might be flashing past in a buggy
    or saloon-carriage&mdash;or, the chances are it will be you&mdash;and you
    might look out the window and see an old swaggy tramping along in the dust,
    or camped under a strip of calico in the rain in the scrub. (And it might
    be me&mdash;old Mitchell&mdash;that really wrote your books, only the world
    won&rsquo;t know it.) And then you&rsquo;ll realize what a wretched, miserable
    life it was. We never realize the miseries of life till we look back&mdash;the
    mistakes and miseries that had to be and couldn&rsquo;t be helped. It&rsquo;s
    all luck&mdash;luck and chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But those girls seemed to have gravelled Mitchell, and he didn&rsquo;t seem
    able to talk himself round. He tramped on, brooding for a while, and then
    suddenly he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Harry! Those girls are giving a dance to-night, and if
    I liked to go back to Bourke and tog up and go to the dance I could pick
    out the prettiest, dance with her all the evening, and take her for a stroll
    afterwards, old tramp as they thought me. I&rsquo;ve lived&mdash;but it wouldn&rsquo;t
    be worth my while now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d seen Jack in a mood like this before, and thought it best to say
    nothing. Perhaps the terrible heat had affected him a little. We walked on
    in silence until we came to the next billabong. &ldquo;Best boil the billy
    here, Harry,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;and have some tea before we go
    any further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I got some sticks together and made a fire and put the billy on. The country
    looked wretched&mdash;like the ghost of a burnt-out land&mdash;in the moonlight.
    The banks of the creek were like ashes, the thin, gnarled gum-bush seemed
    dry-rotting fast, and in many places the surface of the ground was cracked
    in squares where it had shrunk in the drought. In the bed of the creek was
    a narrow gutter of water that looked like bad milk.</p>
  <p>Mitchell sat on his swag, with his pint of tea on the ground by his foot,
    and chewed his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Jack?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Have you got the blues?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, Harry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m generally dull
    the first day on the track. The first day is generally the worst, anywhere
    or anytime&mdash;except, perhaps, when you&rsquo;re married. . . . I got&mdash;well,
    I got thinking of the time when a woman&rsquo;s word could have hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just then one of the &ldquo;travellers&rdquo; who were camped a bit up the
    creek suddenly commenced to sing. It was a song called &ldquo;The Shearer&rsquo;s
    Dream,&rdquo; and I suppose the buggy of girls, or the conversation they
    started, reminded him of it. He started his verses and most of his lines
    with a howl; and there were unexpected howls all through the song, and it
    wailed off, just as unexpectedly, in places where there was no pathos that
    I could see:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, I dreamt I shore in a shearer&rsquo;s shed, and it was a dream
    of joy,<br>
    For every one of the rouseabouts was a girl dressed up as a boy&mdash;<br>
    Dressed up like a page in a pantomime, and the prettiest ever seen&mdash;<br>
    They had flaxen hair, they had coal-black hair&mdash;and every shade between.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every&rdquo; with sudden and great energy, a long drop on to &ldquo;shade,&rdquo; and
    a wail of intense sadness and regret running on into &ldquo;between,&rdquo; the
    dirge reaching its wailsomest in the &ldquo;tween&rdquo; in every case.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;The shed was cooled by electric fans that was over every &ldquo;shoot&rdquo;;<br>
    The pens was of polished ma-ho-gany, and ev&rsquo;rything else to suit;<br>
    The huts was fixed with spring-mattresses, and the tucker was simply grand,<br>
    And every Right by the biller-bong we darnced to a German band.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Chorus, boys!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There was short, plump girls, there was tall,
      slim girls, and the handsomest ever seen&mdash;<br>
  They was four-foot-five, they was six-foot high, and hevery size between.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Our pay was the wool on the jumbucks&rsquo; backs,
      so we shore till all was blue&mdash;<br>
  The sheep was washed afore they was shore (and the rams was scented too);<br>
  And we all of us cried when the shed cut out, in spite of the long, hot days,<br>
  For hevery hour them girls waltzed in with whisky and beer on tr-a-a-a-ys!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Chorus! you &mdash;&mdash;!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;They had kind grey eyes, they had coal-black eyes, and the grandest
    ever seen&mdash;<br>
They had plump pink hands, they had slim white hands, and hevery shape be-tw-e-e-n.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There was three of them girls to every chap, and as jealous as they
    could be&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ow! you &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The singer&rsquo;s voice or memory seemed suddenly to have failed him at
    this point, but whether his mates hit him on the back of the head with a
    tomahawk, or only choked him, I do not know. Mitchell was inclined to think,
    from the sound of it, that they choked him.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheLostSoulsHotel"></a>The Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel</b></h2>
  <p>Hungerford road, February. One hundred and thirty miles of heavy reddish
    sand, bordered by dry, hot scrubs. Dense cloud of hot dust. Four wool-teams
    passing through a gate in a &ldquo;rabbit proof&rdquo; fence which crosses
    the road. Clock, clock, clock of wheels and rattle and clink of chains, crack
    of whips and explosions of Australian language. Bales and every thing else
    coated with dust. Stink of old axle-grease and tarpaulins. Tyres hot enough
    to fry chops on: bows and chains so hot that it&rsquo;s a wonder they do
    not burn through the bullock&rsquo;s hides. Water lukewarm in blistered kegs
    slung behind the wagons. Bullocks dragging along as only bullocks do. Wheels
    ploughing through the deep sand, and the load lurching from side to side.
    Half-way on a &ldquo;dry-stretch&rdquo;  of seventeen miles. Big &ldquo;tank&rdquo; full
    of good water through the scrub to the right, but it is a private tank and
  a boundary-rider is shepherding it. Mulga scrub and sparse, spiky undergrowth.</p>
  <p>The carriers camp for dinner and boil their billies while the bullocks droop
    under their yokes in the blazing heat; one or two lie down and the leaders
    drag and twist themselves round under a dead tree, under the impression that
    there is shade there. The carriers look like Red Indians, with the masks
    of red dust &ldquo;bound&rdquo; with sweat on their faces, but there is an
    unhealthy-looking, whitish space round their eyes, caused by wiping away
    the blinding dust, sweat, and flies. The dry sticks burn with a pale flame
    and an almost invisible thin pale blue smoke. The sun&rsquo;s heat dancing
    and dazzling across every white fence-post, sandhill, or light-coloured object
    in the distance.</p>
  <p>One man takes off his boot and sock, empties half a pint of sand out of
    them, and pulls up his trouser-leg. His leg is sheathed to the knee in dust
    and sweat; he absently scrapes it with his knife, and presently he amuses
    himself by moistening a strip with his forefinger and shaving it, as if he
    were vaguely curious to see if he is still a white man.</p>
  <p>The Hungerford coach ploughs past in a dense cloud of dust.</p>
  <p>The teams drag on again like a &ldquo;wounded snake that dies at sundown,&rdquo; if
    a wounded snake that dies at sundown could revive sufficiently next morning
    to drag on again until another sun goes down.</p>
  <p>Hopeless-looking swagmen are met with during the afternoon, and one carrier&mdash;he
    of the sanded leg&mdash;lends them tobacco; his mates contribute &ldquo;bits
    o&rsquo;&rdquo; tea, flour, and sugar.</p>
  <p>Sundown and the bullocks done up. The teamsters unyoke them and drive them
    on to the next water&mdash;five miles&mdash;having previously sent a mate
    to reconnoitre and see that boundary rider is not round, otherwise, to make
    terms with him, for it is a squatter&rsquo;s bore. They hurry the bullocks
    down to the water and back in the twilight, and then, under cover of darkness,
    turn them into a clearing in the scrub off the road, where a sign of grass
    might be seen&mdash;if
    you look close. But the &ldquo;bullockies&rdquo; are better off than the
    horse-teamsters, for bad chaff is sold by the pound and corn is worth its
    weight in gold.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mitchell and I turned off the track at the rabbit-proof fence and made for
    the tank in the mulga. We boiled the billy and had some salt mutton and damper.
    We were making back for Bourke, having failed to get a cut in any of the
    sheds on the Hungerford track. We sat under a clump of mulga saplings, with
    our backs to the trunks, and got out our pipes. Usually, when the flies were
    very bad on the track, we had to keep twigs or wild-turkey-tail feathers
    going in front of our faces the whole time to keep the mad flies out of our
    eyes; and, when we camped, one would keep the feather going while the other
    lit his pipe&mdash;then the smoke would keep them away. But the flies weren&rsquo;t
    so bad in a good shade or in the darkened hut. Mitchell&rsquo;s pipe would
    have smoked out Old Nick; it was an ancient string-bound meerschaum, and
    strong enough to kill a blackfellow. I had one smoke out of it, once when
    I felt bad in my inside and wanted to be sick, and the result was very satisfactory.</p>
  <p>Mitchell looked through his old pocket-book&mdash;more by force of habit
    than anything else&mdash;and turned up a circular from Tattersall&rsquo;s.
    And that reminded him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;d do, Harry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I
    won Tattersall&rsquo;s big sweep, or was to come into fifty or a hundred
    thousand pounds, or, better still, a million?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, I suppose,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;except to get away to Sydney
    or some cooler place than this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;d do,&rdquo; said Mitchell, talking
    round his pipe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d build a Swagman&rsquo;s Rest right here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A Swagman&rsquo;s Rest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Right here on this very God-forsaken spot. I&rsquo;d build a
    Swagman&rsquo;s Rest and call it the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel, or the Sundowners&rsquo; Arms,
    or the Half-way House to &mdash;&mdash;, or some such name that would take
    the bushmen&rsquo;s fancy. I&rsquo;d have it built on the best plans for
    coolness in a hot country; bricks, and plenty of wide verandas with brick
    floors, and balconies, and shingles, in the old Australian style. I wouldn&rsquo;t
    have a sheet of corrugated iron about the place. And I&rsquo;d have old-fashioned
    hinged sashes with small panes and vines round &rsquo;em; they look cooler
    and more homely and romantic than the glaring sort that shove up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d dig a tank or reservoir for surface water as big as
    a lake, and bore for artesian water&mdash;and get it, too, if I had to bore
    right through to England; and I&rsquo;d irrigate the ground and make it grow
    horse-feed and fruit, and vegetables too, if I had to cart manure from Bourke.
    And every teamster&rsquo;s bullock or horse, and every shearer&rsquo;s hack,
    could burst itself free, but I&rsquo;d make travelling stock pay&mdash;for
    it belongs to the squatters and capitalists. All carriers could camp for
    one night only. And I&rsquo;d&mdash;no, I wouldn&rsquo;t have any flowers;
    they might remind some heart-broken, new-chum black sheep of the house where
    he was born, and the mother whose heart he broke&mdash;and the father whose
    grey hairs he brought down in sorrow to the grave&mdash;and break him up
    altogether.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what about the old-fashioned windows and the vines?&rdquo; I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I forgot them. On second thought,
    I think I would have some flowers; and maybe a bit of ivy-green. The new
    chum might be trying to work out his own salvation, and the sight of the
    roses and ivy would show him that he hadn&rsquo;t struck such a God-forgotten
    country after all, and help strengthen the hope for something better that&rsquo;s
    in the heart of every vagabond till he dies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Puff, puff, puff, slowly and reflectively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until he dies,&rdquo; repeated Mitchell. &ldquo;And, maybe,&rdquo; he
    said, rousing himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have a little room fixed up like
    a corner of a swell restaurant, with silver and napkins on the table, and
    I&rsquo;d fix up a waiter, so that when a broken-down University wreck came
    along he might feel, for an hour or so, something like the man he used to
    be. But I suppose,&rdquo; Mitchell reflected, &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t feel
    completely his old self without a lady friend sitting opposite to him. I
    might fix up a black gin for him, but I suppose he&rsquo;d draw the colour
    line. But that&rsquo;s nonsense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All teamsters and travellers could camp there for one night only.
    I&rsquo;d have shower-baths; but I wouldn&rsquo;t force any man to have a
    bath against his will. They could sit down to a table and have a feed off
    a table-cloth, and sleep in sheets, and feel like they did before their old
    mothers died, or before they ran away from home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who? The mothers?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, in some cases,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d have
    a nice, cool little summer-house down near the artificial lake, out of earshot
    of the house, where the bullock-drivers could sit with their pipes after
    tea, and tell yarns, and talk in their own language. And I&rsquo;d have boats
    on the lake, too, in case an old Oxford or Cambridge man, or an old sailor
    came along&mdash;it might put years on to his life to have a pull at the oars.
    You remember that old sailor we saw in charge of the engine back there at
    the government tank? You saw how he had the engine?&mdash;clean and bright
    as a new pin&mdash;everything spick-and-span and shipshape, and his hut fixed
    up like a ship&rsquo;s cabin. I believe he thinks he&rsquo;s at sea half
    his time, and shoving her through it, instead of pumping muddy water out
    of a hole in the baking scrubs for starving stock. Or maybe he reckons he&rsquo;s
    keeping her afloat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And would you have fish in this lake of yours?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;and any ratty old shepherd
    or sundowner, that&rsquo;s gone mad of heat and loneliness&mdash;like the
    old codger we met back yonder&mdash;he could sit by the lagoon in the cool
    of the evening and fish to his heart&rsquo;s content with a string and a
    bent pin, and dream he&rsquo;s playing truant from school and fishing in
    the brook near his native village in England about fifty years ago. It would
    seem more real than fishing in the dust as some mad old bushmen do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d draw the line somewhere?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;not even at poets. I&rsquo;d try
    to cure them, too, with good wholesome food and plenty of physical exercise.
    The Lost Souls&rsquo;  Hotel would be a refuge for men who&rsquo;d been jail-birds
    once as well as men who were gentlemen once, and for physical wrecks and
    ruined drunkards as well as healthy honest shearers. I&rsquo;d sit down and
    talk to the boozer or felon just as if I thought he was as good a man as
    me&mdash;and he might be, for that matter&mdash;God knows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The sick man would be kept till he recovered, or died; and the boozer,
    suffering from a recovery, I&rsquo;d keep him till he was on his legs again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d have to have a doctor,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d fix that up all right.
    I wouldn&rsquo;t bother much about a respectable medical practitioner from
    the city. I&rsquo;d get a medical wreck who had a brilliant career before
    him once in England and got into disgrace, and cleared out to the colonies&mdash;a
    man who knows what the d.t.&rsquo;s is&mdash;a man who&rsquo;s been through
    it all and knows it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d want a manager, or a clerk or secretary,&rdquo; I
    suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I would,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no
    head for figures. I suppose I&rsquo;d have to advertise for him. If an applicant
    came with the highest testimonials of character, and especially if one was
    signed by a parson, I&rsquo;d tell him to call again next week; and if a
    young man could prove that he came of a good Christian family, and went to
    church regularly, and sang in the choir, and taught Sunday-school, I&rsquo;d
    tell him that he needn&rsquo;t come again, that the vacancy was filled, for
    I couldn&rsquo;t trust him. The man who&rsquo;s been extra religious and
    honest and hard-working in his young days is most likely to go wrong afterwards.
    I&rsquo;d sooner trust some poor old devil of a clerk who&rsquo;d got into
    the hands of a woman or racing men when he was young, and went wrong, and
    served his time for embezzlement; anyway, I&rsquo;d take him out and give
    him another chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what about woman&rsquo;s influence?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose there&rsquo;d have to be a woman, if only to keep the
    doctor on the line. I&rsquo;d get a woman with a past, one that hadn&rsquo;t
    been any better than she should have been, they&rsquo;re generally the most
    kind-hearted in the end. Say an actress who&rsquo;d come down in the world,
    or an old opera-singer who&rsquo;d lost her voice but could still sing a
    little. A woman who knows what trouble is. And I&rsquo;d get a girl to keep
    her company, a sort of housemaid, with a couple of black gins or half-castes
    to help her. I&rsquo;d get hold of some poor girl who&rsquo;d been deceived
    and deserted: and a baby or two wouldn&rsquo;t be an objection&mdash;the
    kids would amuse the chaps and help humanize the place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what if the manageress fell in love with the doctor?&rdquo; I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t provide against love,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I
    fell in love myself more than once&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;d
    have been any worse off if I&rsquo;d have stayed in love. Ah, well! But suppose
    she did fall in love with the doctor and marry him, or suppose she fell in
    love with him and didn&rsquo;t marry him, for that matter&mdash;and suppose
    the girl fell in love with the secretary? There wouldn&rsquo;t be any harm
    done; it would only make them more contented with the home and bind them
    to it. They&rsquo;d be a happy family, and the Lost Souls&rsquo;  Hotel would
    be more cheerful and homelike than ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But supposing they all fell in love with each other and cleared out,&rdquo; I
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what they&rsquo;d have to clear out for,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell.  &ldquo;But suppose they did. There&rsquo;s more than one medical
    wreck in Australia, and more than one woman with a past, and more than one
    broken old clerk who went wrong and was found out, and who steadied down
    in jail, and there&rsquo;s more than one poor girl that&rsquo;s been deceived.
    I could easily replace &rsquo;em. And the Lost Souls&rsquo;  Hotel might
    be the means of patching up many wrecked lives in that way&mdash;giving people
    with pasts the chance of another future, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d have music and books and pictures?&rdquo; I
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t have any
    bitter or sex-problem books. They do no good. Problems have been the curse
    of the world ever since it started. I think one noble, kindly, cheerful character
    in a book does more good than all the clever villains or romantic adventurers
    ever invented. And I think a man ought to get rid of his maudlin sentiment
    in private, or when he&rsquo;s drunk. It&rsquo;s a pity that every writer
    couldn&rsquo;t put all his bitterness into one book and then burn it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;d have good cheerful books of the best and brightest
    sides of human nature&mdash;Charles Dickens, and Mark Twain, and Bret Harte,
    and those men. And I&rsquo;d have all Australian pictures&mdash;showing the
    brightest and best side of Australian life. And I&rsquo;d have all Australian
    songs. I wouldn&rsquo;t have &lsquo;Swannie Ribber,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Home,
    Sweet Home,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Annie Laurie,&rsquo; or any of those old songs
    sung at the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel&mdash;they&rsquo;re the cause of more
    heartbreaks and drink and suicide in the bush than anything else. And if
    a jackeroo got up to sing,  &lsquo;Just before the battle, mother,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Mother
    bit me in me sleep,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d find it was just before the battle
    all right. He&rsquo;d have to go out and sleep in the scrub, where the mosquitoes
    and bulldog ants would bite him out of his sleep. I hate the man who&rsquo;s
    always whining about his mother through his nose, because, as a rule, he
    never cared a rap for his old mother, nor for anyone else, except his own
    paltry, selfish little self.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have intellectual and elevating conversation for those
    that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d take charge of that department?&rdquo; I inquired hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; reflected Mitchell, &ldquo;I did have an idea of taking
    it on myself for a while anyway; but, come to think of it, the doctor or
    the woman with the past would have more experience; and I could look after
    that part of the business at a pinch. Of course you&rsquo;re not in a position
    to judge as to my ability in the intellectual line; you see, I&rsquo;ve had
    no one to practise on since I&rsquo;ve been with you. But no matter&mdash;&mdash; There&rsquo;d
    be intellectual conversation for the benefit of black-sheep new chums. And
    any broken-down actors that came along could get up a play if they liked&mdash;it
    would brighten up things and help elevate the bullock-drivers and sundowners.
    I&rsquo;d have a stage fixed up and a bit of scenery. I&rsquo;d do all I
    could to attract shearers to the place after shearing, and keep them from
    rushing to the next shanty with their cheques, or down to Sydney, to be cleaned
    out by barmaids.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d have the hero squashed in the last act for a selfish
    sneak, and marry the girl to the villain&mdash;he&rsquo;d be more likely
    to make her happy in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what about the farm?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d
    get some expert from the agricultural college to manage that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d get some poor drought-ruined
    selector and put him in charge of the vegetation. Only, the worst of it is.&rdquo; he
    reflected, &ldquo;if you take a selector who has bullocked all his life to
    raise crops on dusty, stony patches in the scrubs, and put him on land where
    there&rsquo;s plenty of water and manure, and where he&rsquo;s only got to
    throw the seed on the ground and then light his pipe and watch it grow, he&rsquo;s
    apt to get disheartened. But that&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, of course, I&rsquo;d have to have a &lsquo;character&rsquo; about
    the place&mdash;a sort of identity and joker to brighten up things. I wouldn&rsquo;t
    get a man who&rsquo;d been happy and comfortable all his life; I&rsquo;d
    get hold of some old codger whose wife had nagged him till she died, and
    who&rsquo;d been sold off many times, and run in for drowning his sorrows,
    and who started as an undertaker and failed at that, and finally got a job
    pottering round&mdash;gardener, or gatekeeper, or something&mdash;in a lunatic
    asylum. I&rsquo;d get him. He&rsquo;d most likely be a humorist and a philosopher,
    and he&rsquo;d help cheer up the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel. I reckon the lost
    souls would get very fond of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And would you have drink at Lost Souls&rsquo;?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have the best beer and
    spirits and wine to be had. After tea I&rsquo;d let every man have just enough
    to make him feel comfortable and happy, and as good and clever, and innocent
    and honest as any other man, but no more. But if a poor devil came along
    in the horrors, with every inch of him jumping, and snakes, and green-eyed
    yahoos, and flaming-nosed bunyips chasing him, we&rsquo;d take him in and
    give him soothing draughts, and nurse him, and watch him, and clear him out
    with purgatives, and keep giving him nips of good whisky, and, above all,
    we&rsquo;d sympathize with him, and tell him that we were worse than he was
    many a time. We wouldn&rsquo;t tell him what a weak, selfish man he was,
    or harp on his ruined life. We&rsquo;d try to make him out a good deal better
    morally than he really was. It&rsquo;s remorse that hurries most men to hell&mdash;especially
    in the Bush. When a man firmly believes he is a hopeless case, then there&rsquo;s
    no hope for him: but let him have doubts and there&rsquo;s a chance. Make
    him believe that there are far worse cases than his. We wouldn&rsquo;t preach
    the sin of dissipation to him, no&mdash;but we&rsquo;d try to show him the&nbsp;<i>folly</i>&nbsp;of
    a wasted life. I ought to be able to preach that, God knows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, above all, we&rsquo;d try to drive out of his head the cursed
    old popular idea that it&rsquo;s hard to reform&mdash;that a man&rsquo;s
    got to fight a hard battle with himself to get away from drink&mdash;pity
    drunkards can&rsquo;t believe how easy it is. And we&rsquo;d put it to him
    straight whether his few hours&rsquo; enjoyment were worth the days he had
    to suffer hell for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, likely as not,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;d put him
    on his feet he&rsquo;d take the nearest track to the next shanty, and go
    on a howling spree, and come back to Lost Souls&rsquo; in a week, raving
    and worse than ever. What would you do then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d take him in again, and build him up some more; and a third
    or fourth time if necessary. I believe in going right on with a thing once
    I take it in hand. And if he didn&rsquo;t turn up after the last spree we&rsquo;d
    look for him up the scrub and bring him in and let him die on a bed, and
    make his death as comfortable as possible. I&rsquo;ve seen one man die on
    the ground, and found one dead in the bush. We&rsquo;d bury him under a gum
    and put &lsquo;Sacred to the Memory of a Man who Died. (Let him R.I.P.)&rsquo; over
    him. I&rsquo;d have a nice little graveyard, with gums for tombstones&mdash;and
    I&rsquo;d have some original epitaphs&mdash;I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how much gratitude would you expect to get out of the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel?&rdquo; I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said Mitchell, promptly. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be
    a Gratitude Discovery Syndicate. People might say that the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel
    was a den for kidnapping women and girls to be used as decoys for the purpose
    of hocussing and robbing bushmen, and the law and retribution might come
    after me&mdash;but I&rsquo;d fight the thing out. Or they might want to make
    a K.C.M.G., or a god of me, and worship me before they hung me. I reckon
    a philanthropist or reformer is lucky if he escapes with a whole skin in
    the end, let alone his character&mdash;&mdash; But there!&mdash;&mdash; Talking
    of gratitude: it&rsquo;s the fear of ingratitude that keeps thousands from
    doing good. It&rsquo;s just as paltry and selfish and cowardly as any other
    fear that curses the world&mdash;it&rsquo;s rather more selfish than most
    fears, in fact&mdash;take the fear of being thought a coward, or being considered
    eccentric, or conceited, or affected, or too good, or too bad, for instance.
    The man that&rsquo;s always canting about the world&rsquo;s ingratitude has
    no gratitude owing to him as a rule&mdash;generally the reverse&mdash;he
    ought to be grateful to the world for being let live. He broods over the
    world&rsquo;s ingratitude until he gets to be a cynic. He sees the world
    like the outside of a window, as it were, with the blind drawn and the dead,
    cold moonlight shining on it, and he passes on with a sour face; whereas,
    if he took the trouble to step inside he&rsquo;d most likely find a room
    full of ruddy firelight, and sympathy and cheerfulness, and kindness, and
    love, and gratitude. Sometimes, when he&rsquo;s right down on his uppers,
    and forced to go amongst people and hustle for bread, he gets a lot of surprises
    at the amount of kindness he keeps running against in the world&mdash;and
    in places where he&rsquo;d never have expected to find it. But&mdash;ah,
    well! I&rsquo;m getting maudlin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve forgot all about the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel,&rdquo; I
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mitchell; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d fix that
    up all right. As soon as I&rsquo;d got things going smoothly under a man
    I could trust, I&rsquo;d tie up every penny I had for the benefit of the
    concern; get some &lsquo;white men&rsquo; for trustees, and take the track
    again. I&rsquo;m getting too old to stay long in one place&mdash;(I&rsquo;m
    a lost soul that always got along better in another place). I&rsquo;m so
    used to the track that if I was shut up in a house I&rsquo;d get walking
    up and down in my room of nights and disturb the folk; and, besides, I&rsquo;d
    feel lost and light-shouldered without the swag.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;d put all your money in the concern?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;except a pound or two to go on the track with&mdash;for,
    who knows, I might come along there, dusty and tired, and ragged and hard
    up and old, some day, and be very glad of a night&rsquo;s rest at the Lost
    Souls&rsquo; Hotel. But I wouldn&rsquo;t let on that I was old Mitchell,
    the millionaire, who founded Lost Souls&rsquo;. They might be too officious,
    and I hate fuss. . . . But it&rsquo;s time to take the track, Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There came a cool breeze with sunset; we stood up stiffly, shouldered our
    swags and tucker-bags, and pushed on, for we had to make the next water before
    we camped. We were out of tobacco, so we borrowed some from one of the bullock-drivers.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBoozersHome"></a>The Boozers&rsquo; Home</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;A&nbsp;dipsomaniac,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Mitchell, &ldquo;needs
    sympathy and commonsense treatment. (Sympathy&rsquo;s a grand and glorious
    thing, taking it all round and looking at it any way you will: a little of
    it makes a man think that the world&rsquo;s a good world after all, and there&rsquo;s
    room and hope for sinners, and that life&rsquo;s worth living; enough of
    it makes him sure of it: and an overdose of sympathy makes a man&nbsp;<i>feel</i>&nbsp;weak
    and ashamed of himself, and so moves him to stop whining&mdash;and wining&mdash;and
    buck up.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m not taking the case of a workman who goes on the spree
    on pay night and sweats the drink out of himself at work next day, nor a
    slum-bred brute who guzzles for the love of it; but a man with brains, who
    drinks to drown his intellect or his memory. He&rsquo;s generally a man under
    it all, and a sensitive, generous, gentle man with finer feelings as often
    as not. The best and cleverest and whitest men in the world seem to take
    to drink mostly. It&rsquo;s an awful pity. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re
    straight and the world&rsquo;s crooked and they can see things too plain.
    And I suppose in the bush the loneliness and the thoughts of the girl-world
    they left behind help to sink  &rsquo;em.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now a drunkard seldom reforms at home, because he&rsquo;s always
    surrounded by the signs of the ruin and misery he has brought on the home;
    and the sight and thought of it sets him off again before he&rsquo;s had
    time to recover from the last spree. Then, again, the noblest wife in the
    world mostly goes the wrong way to work with a drunken husband&mdash;nearly
    everything she does is calculated to irritate him. If, for instance, he brings
    a bottle home from the pub, it shows that he wants to stay at home and not
    go back to the pub any more; but the first thing the wife does is to get
    hold of the bottle and plant it, or smash it before his eyes, and that maddens
    him in the state he is in then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. A dipsomaniac needs to be taken away from home for a while. I
    knew a man that got so bad that the way he acted at home one night frightened
    him, and next morning he went into an inebriate home of his own accord&mdash;to
    a place where his friends had been trying to get him for a year past. For
    the first day or two he was nearly dead with remorse and shame&mdash;mostly
    shame; and he didn&rsquo;t know what they were going to do to him next&mdash;and
    he only wanted them to kill him quick and be done with it. He reckons he
    felt as bad as if he was in jail. But there were ten other patients there,
    and one or two were worse than he was, and that comforted him a lot. They
    compared notes and sympathized and helped each other. They discovered that
    all their wives were noble women. He struck one or two surprises too&mdash;one
    of the patients was a doctor who&rsquo;d attended him one time, and another
    was an old boss of his, and they got very chummy. And there was a man there
    who was standing for Parliament&mdash;he was supposed to be having a rest
    down the coast. . . . Yes, my old mate felt very bad for the first day or
    two; it was all Yes, Nurse, and Thank you, Nurse, and Yes, Doctor, and No,
    Doctor, and Thank you, Doctor. But, inside a week, he was calling the doctor &lsquo;Ol&rsquo; Pill-Box&rsquo; behind
    his back, and making love to one of the nurses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he said it was pitiful when women relatives came to visit patients
    the first morning. It shook the patients up a lot, but I reckon it did &rsquo;em
    good. There were well-bred old lady mothers in black, and hard-working, haggard
    wives and loving daughters&mdash;and the expressions of sympathy and faith
    and hope in those women&rsquo;s faces! My old mate said it was enough in
    itself to make a man swear off drink for ever. . . . Ah, God&mdash;what a
    world it is!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reminds me how I once went with the wife of another old mate of mine
    to see him. He was in a lunatic asylum. It was about the worst hour I ever
    had in my life, and I&rsquo;ve had some bad ones. The way she tried to coax
    him back to his old self. She thought she could do it when all the doctors
    had failed. But I&rsquo;ll tell you about him some other time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old mate said that the principal part of the treatment was supposed
    to be injection of bi-chloride of gold or something, and it was supposed
    to be a secret. It might have been water and sugar for all he knew, and he
    thought it was. You see, when patients got better they were allowed out,
    two by two, on their honour&mdash;one to watch the other&mdash;and it worked.
    But it was necessary to have an extra hold on them; so they were told that
    if they were a minute late for &lsquo;treatment,&rsquo; or missed one injection,
    all the good would be undone. This was dinged into their ears all the time.
    Same as many things are done in the Catholic religion&mdash;to hold the people.
    My old mate said that, as far as the medical treatment was concerned, he
    could do all that was necessary himself. But it was the sympathy that counted,
    especially the sympathy between the patients themselves. They always got
    hold of a new patient and talked to him and cheered him up; he nearly always
    came in thinking he was the most miserable wretch in this world.. And it
    comforts a man and strengthens him and makes him happier to meet another
    man who&rsquo;s worse off or sicker, or has been worse swindled than he has
    been. That&rsquo;s human nature. . . . And a man will take draughts from
    a nurse and eat for her when he wouldn&rsquo;t do it for his own wife&mdash;not
    even though she had been a trained nurse herself. And if a patient took a
    bad turn in the night at the Boozers&rsquo; Home and got up to hunt the snakes
    out of his room, he wouldn&rsquo;t be sworn at, or laughed at, or held down;
    no, they&rsquo;d help him shoo the snakes out and comfort him. My old mate
    said that, when he got better, one of the new patients reckoned that he licked
    St Pathrick at managing snakes. And when he came out he didn&rsquo;t feel
    a bit ashamed of his experience. The institution didn&rsquo;t profess to
    cure anyone of drink, only to mend up shattered nerves and build up wrecked
    constitutions; give them back some will-power if they weren&rsquo;t too far
    gone. And they set my old mate on his feet all right. When he went in his
    life seemed lost, he had the horror of being sober, he couldn&rsquo;t start
    the day without a drink or do any business without it. He couldn&rsquo;t
    live for more than two hours without a drink; but when he came out he didn&rsquo;t
    feel as if he wanted it. He reckoned that those six weeks in the institution
    were the happiest he&rsquo;d ever spent in his life, and he wished the time
    had been longer; he says he&rsquo;d never met with so much sympathy and genius,
    and humour and human nature under one roof before. And he said it was nice
    and novel to be looked after and watched and physicked and bossed by a pretty
    nurse in uniform&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t suppose he told his wife that. And
    when he came out he never took the trouble to hide the fact that he&rsquo;d
    been in. If any of his friends had a drunkard in the family, he&rsquo;d recommend
    the institution and do his best to get him into it. But when he came out
    he firmly believed that if he took one drink he&rsquo;d be a lost man. He
    made a mania of that. One curious effect was that, for some time after he
    left the institution, he&rsquo;d sometimes feel suddenly in high spirits&mdash;with
    nothing to account for it&mdash;something like he used to feel when he had
    half a dozen whiskies in him; then suddenly he&rsquo;d feel depressed and
    sort of hopeless&mdash;with nothing to account for that either&mdash;just
    as if he was suffering a recovery. But those moods never lasted long and
    he soon grew out of them altogether. He didn&rsquo;t flee temptation. He&rsquo;d
    knock round the pubs on Saturday nights with his old mates, but never drank
    anything but soft stuff&mdash;he was always careful to smell his glass for
    fear of an accident or trick. He drank gallons of ginger beer, milk-and-soda,
    and lemonade; and he got very fond of sweets, too&mdash;he&rsquo;d never
    liked them before. He said he enjoyed the novelty of the whole thing and
    his mates amused him at first; but he found he had to leave them early in
    the evening, and, after a while, he dropped them altogether. They seemed
    such fools when they were drunk (they&rsquo;d never seemed fools to him before).
    And, besides, as they got full, they&rsquo;d get suspicious of him, and then
    mad at him, because he couldn&rsquo;t see things as they could. That reminds
    me that it nearly breaks a man&rsquo;s heart when his old drinking chum turns
    teetotaller&mdash;it&rsquo;s worse than if he got married or died. When two
    mates meet and one is drunk and the other sober there is only one of two
    things for them to do if they want to hit it together&mdash;either the drunken
    mate must get sober or the sober mate drunk. And that reminds me: Take the
    case of two old mates who&rsquo;ve been together all their lives, say they
    always had their regular sprees together and went through the same stages
    of drunkenness together, and suffered their recoveries and sobered up together,
    and each could stand about the same quantity of drink and one never got drunker
    than the other. Each, when he&rsquo;s boozing, reckons his mate the cleverest
    man and the hardest case in the world&mdash;second to himself. But one day
    it happens, by a most extraordinary combination of circumstances, that Bill,
    being sober, meets Jim very drunk, and pretty soon Bill is the most disgusted
    man in this world. He never would have dreamed that his old mate could make
    such a fool and such a public spectacle of himself. And Bill&rsquo;s disgust
    intensifies all the time he is helping Jim home, and Jim arguing with him
    and wanting to fight him, and slobbering over him and wanting to love him
    by turns, until Bill swears he&rsquo;ll give Jim a hammering as soon as ever
    he&rsquo;s able to stand steady on his feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose your old boozing mate&rsquo;s wife was very happy when
    he reformed,&rdquo; I said to Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said Mitchell, rubbing his head rather ruefully. &ldquo;I
    suppose it was an exceptional case. But I knew her well, and the fact is
    that she got more discontented and thinner, and complained and nagged him
    worse than she&rsquo;d ever done in his drinking days. And she&rsquo;d never
    been afraid of him. Perhaps it was this way: She loved and married a careless,
    good-natured, drinking scamp, and when he reformed and became a careful,
    hard-working man, and an honest and respected fellow-townsman, she was disappointed
    in him. He wasn&rsquo;t the man that won her heart when she was a girl. Or
    maybe he was only company for her when he was half drunk. Or maybe lots of
    things. Perhaps he&rsquo;d killed the love in her before he reformed&mdash;and
    reformed too late. I wonder how a man feels when he finds out for the first
    time that his wife doesn&rsquo;t love him any longer? But my old mate wasn&rsquo;t
    the nature to find out that sort of thing. Ah, well! If a woman caused all
    our trouble, my God! women have suffered for it since&mdash;and they suffer
    like martyrs mostly and with the patience of working bullocks. Anyway it
    goes, if I&rsquo;m the last man in the world, and the last woman is the worst,
    and there&rsquo;s only room for one more in Heaven, I&rsquo;ll step down
    at once and take my chances in Blazes.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSexProblemAgain"></a>The Sex Problem Again</b></h2>
  <p>It&nbsp;was Mitchell&rsquo;s habit to take an evening off now and then from
    yarning or reflecting, and proceed, in a most methodical manner, to wash
    his spare shirts and patch his pants. I was in the habit of contributing
    to some Sydney papers, and every man is an editor at heart, so, at other
    times, Mitchell would take another evening off, and root out my swag, and
    go through my papers in the same methodical manner, and make alterations
    and additions without comment or reference to me; and sometimes he&rsquo;d
    read a little thing of my own which didn&rsquo;t meet his views, and accidentally
    drop it into the fire; and at other times he&rsquo;d get hold of some rhyme
    or sketch that was troubling me, and wrap it up and give it to a passing
    mailman unbeknown to me. The unexpected appearance of such articles in the
    paper, as well as the effects of the involuntary collaboration in other pieces,
    gave me several big surprises.</p>
  <p>It was in camp on a fencing contract west of Bourke. We had a book which
    we&rsquo;d borrowed from a library at Bourke for a year or two&mdash;never
    mind the name of it&mdash;it was in ninety-one or ninety-two, and the sex
    problem was booming then.</p>
  <p>I had been surreptitiously tearing some carefully-written slips of manuscript&mdash;leaves
    taken from an old pocket-book&mdash;into small pieces; I dropped them, with
    apparent carelessness, into the fire and stood with my back to it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet five pounds,&rdquo; said Mitchell, suddenly, &ldquo;that
    you&rsquo;ve been trying your hand on a sex-problem story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I shifted uneasily and brought my hands from behind me into my pockets. &ldquo;Well,
    to tell you the truth,&rdquo; I admitted, &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; exclaimed Mitchell. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be put
    to the expense of sending you to Sydney for medical treatment yet. You&rsquo;ve
    been having too easy times lately, plenty of hard graft and no anxiety about
    tucker or the future. What are the symptoms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, taking a hand out to scratch the back of my
    head, &ldquo;the plot looked all right&mdash;at first sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s a plot, is there? Well, in the first place, a plot
    is a problem. Well, what&rsquo;s the plot? . . . Come on, you needn&rsquo;t
    be frightened to tell an old mate like me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the yarn looked all right at first sight;
    that article of &lsquo;T&rsquo;s&rsquo; in the&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>&nbsp;turned
    me off it; listen and see what you think of it: There was a young fellow,
    a bit of a genius&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just so, it&rsquo;s the geniuses that build the sex problems. It&rsquo;s
    an autobiography. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he married a girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell (<i>sotto voce</i>): &ldquo;God help her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He loved her, and she loved him: but after they&rsquo;d been married
    a while he found out that, although he understood her, she didn&rsquo;t and
    couldn&rsquo;t possibly ever understand him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; commented Mitchell, &ldquo;and if he hadn&rsquo;t caught
    the sex problem, nor been reading about it, he would never have found that
    out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a terrible disappointment,&rdquo; I continued&mdash;I had
    got into the habit of taking Mitchell&rsquo;s interruptions and comments
    as matters of course&mdash;&ldquo;He saw that his life would be a hell with
    her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t strike him that her life would be a hell with
    him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They had no thought in common.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell: &ldquo;She was in her right mind then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he couldn&rsquo;t leave her because he loved her, and because
    he knew that she loved him and would break her heart if he left her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must have been a pretty cocksure sort of a fellow,&rdquo; remarked
    Mitchell, &ldquo;but all geniuses are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When he was with her he saw all her obstinacy, unreason, and selfishness;
    but when he was away he only saw her good points.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell: &ldquo;Pity such men don&rsquo;t stop away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He thought and thought, and brooded over it till his life was a hell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell: &ldquo;Jes-so: thanks to the problemaniacs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He thought of killing her and himself, and so taking her with him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Mitchell. &ldquo;He must have loved her a lot.
    . . . Good Lord! That shows the awful effects of the sex problem on the mind
    of a healthy young man like you;&rdquo; and Mitchell stood up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He lay awake by her side at nights thinking and fighting the thing
    out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been lying awake, thinking, with me and &lsquo;the
    Oracle&rsquo; by your side. We&rsquo;ll have to plant the tommy-hawk, and
    watch you by turns at night till you get over this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One night he rested on his elbow, and watched her sleeping, and tried
    to reconstruct his ideal out of her, and, just when he was getting into a
    happier frame of mind, her mouth fell open, and she snored. . . . I didn&rsquo;t
    get any further than the snore,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mitchell,  &ldquo;and
    none of the sex problemers ever will&mdash;unless they get as far as &lsquo;blanky.&rsquo;  You
    might have made the snore cure him; did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, it was making things worse in my idea of the yarn. He fell back
    and lay staring at the ceiling in a hopeless kind of a way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he was a fit case for the lunatic asylum. . . . Now, look here,
    Harry, you&rsquo;re a good-natured, soft old fool when you&rsquo;re in your
    right mind; just you go on being a good-natured, soft old fool, and don&rsquo;t
    try to make a problem out of yourself or anybody else, or you&rsquo;ll come
    to a bad end. A pocket-book&rsquo;s to keep your accounts in, not to take
    notes in (you take them in your head and use &rsquo;em in your arms), not
    to write sex-problem rot in&mdash;that&rsquo;s spoilt many a good pocket-book,
    and many a good man. You&rsquo;ve got a girl you&rsquo;re talking about going
    back to as soon as we&rsquo;ve finished this contract. Don&rsquo;t you make
    a problem of her; make a happy wife and mother of her. . . . I was very clever
    when I was young&rdquo;&mdash;and here Mitchell&rsquo;s voice took a tinge
    of bitterness, or sadness. &ldquo;I used to make problems out of things.
    . . . I ain&rsquo;t much to boast of now. . . . Seems to me that a good many
    men want to make angels of their wives without first taking trouble of making
    saints of themselves. We want to make women&rsquo;s ways our ways&mdash;it
    would be just as fair to make our ways theirs. Some men want to be considered
    gods in their own homes; you&rsquo;ll generally find that sort of men very
    small potatoes outside; if they weren&rsquo;t they wouldn&rsquo;t bother
    so much about being cocks on their own little dunghills. . . . And again,
    old mates seldom quarrel, because they understand each other&rsquo;s moods.
    Now, if you went brooding round for any length of time I&rsquo;d say to you. &lsquo;Now
    then, Harry, what have I been doing to you? Spit it out, old man.&rsquo; And
    you&rsquo;d do the same by me; but how many men would take even that much
    trouble with their wives?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A breeze stirred the mulga and brought the sound of a good voice singing
    in the surveyors&rsquo; camp</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;Should old acquaintance be forgot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never brought to min&rsquo;?<br>
    Should old acquaintance be forgot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the days of Auld Lang Syne?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&nbsp;damned old tune will upset the Oracle&nbsp;for
    the rest of the night,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s the Oracle,&rdquo; said Mitchell.  &ldquo;He was
    wronged by a woman as few men are wronged; his life was ruined&mdash;but
    he isn&rsquo;t the man to take any stock in sex problems on account of her.
    He thinks he&rsquo;s great on problems, but he isn&rsquo;t. It all amounts
    to this&mdash;that he&rsquo;s sorry for most men and all women and tries
    to act up to it to the best of his ability; and if he ain&rsquo;t a Christian,
    God knows what is&mdash;I don&rsquo;t. No matter what a woman does to you,
    or what you think she does to you, there come times, sooner or later, when
    you feel sorry for her&mdash;deep down in your heart&mdash;that is if you&rsquo;re
    a man. And, no matter what action or course you might take against her, and
    no matter how right or justified you might seem in doing it, there comes
    a time when, deep down in your heart, you feel mean and doubtful about your
    own part. You can take that as a general thing as regards men against women,
    and man against man, I think. And I believe that deep-down feeling of being
    doubtful, or mean, or sorry, that comes afterwards, when you are cooler and
    know more about the world, is a right and natural thing, and we ought to
    act more in accordance with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Came the refrain from the surveyors&rsquo; camp:</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;We twa hae run about the braes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; pu&rsquo;d the gowans fine;<br>
    But we&rsquo;ve wandered mony a weary foot<br>

  <p>&ldquo;We feel sorry for our quarrels with our worst enemy when we see him
    lying still and quiet&mdash;dead. Why can&rsquo;t we try and feel a bit sorry
    beforehand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;For

    But seas between us braid ha&rsquo; roar&rsquo;d<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin&rsquo; Auld Lang Syne.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I used to feel blazing bitter against things one time but it never
    hurt anybody but myself in the end. I argued and quarrelled with a girl once&mdash;and
    made a problem of the thing and went away. She&rsquo;s married to a brute
    now, and I&rsquo;m what I am. I made a problem of a good home or the world
    once, and went against the last man in God&rsquo;s world that I should have
    gone against, and turned my back on his hand, and left him. His hand was
    very cold the next time I took it in mine. We don&rsquo;t want problems to
    make us more bitter against the world than we get sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;And here&rsquo;s a han&rsquo; my trusty frien&rsquo;,<br>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheRomanceoftheSwag"></a>The Romance of the Swag</b></h2>
  <p>The&nbsp;Australian swag fashion is the easiest way in the world of carrying
    a load. I ought to know something about carrying loads: I&rsquo;ve carried
    babies, which are the heaviest and most awkward and heartbreaking loads in
    this world for a boy or man to carry, I fancy. God remember mothers who slave
    about the housework (and do sometimes a man&rsquo;s work in addition in the
    bush) with a heavy, squalling kid on one arm! I&rsquo;ve humped logs on the
    selection,  &ldquo;burning-off,&rdquo; with loads of fencing-posts and rails
    and palings out of steep, rugged gullies (and was happier then, perhaps);
    I&rsquo;ve carried a shovel, crowbar, heavy &ldquo;rammer,&rdquo; a dozen
    insulators on an average (strung round my shoulders with raw flax)&mdash;to
    say nothing of soldiering kit, tucker-bag, billy and climbing spurs&mdash;all
    day on a telegraph line in rough country in New Zealand, and in places where
    a man had to manage his load with one hand and help himself climb with the
    other; and I&rsquo;ve helped hump and drag telegraph-poles up cliffs and
    sidings where the horses couldn&rsquo;t go. I&rsquo;ve carried a portmanteau
    on the hot dusty roads in green old jackeroo days. Ask any actor who&rsquo;s
    been stranded and had to count railway sleepers from one town to another!
    he&rsquo;ll tell you what sort of an awkward load a portmanteau is, especially
    if there&rsquo;s a broken-hearted man underneath it. I&rsquo;ve tried knapsack
    fashion&mdash;one of the least healthy and most likely to give a man sores;
    I&rsquo;ve carried my belongings in a three-bushel sack slung over my shoulder&mdash;blankets,
    tucker, spare boots and poetry all lumped together. I tried carrying a load
    on my head, and got a crick in my neck and spine for days. I&rsquo;ve carried
    a load on my mind that should have been shared by editors and publishers.
    I&rsquo;ve helped hump luggage and furniture up to, and down from, a top
    flat in London. And I&rsquo;ve carried swag for months out back in Australia&mdash;and
    it was life, in spite of its &ldquo;squalidness&rdquo; and meanness and wretchedness
    and hardship, and in spite of the fact that the world would have regarded
    us as &ldquo;tramps&rdquo;&mdash;and a free life amongst&nbsp;<i>men</i>&nbsp;from
    all the world</p>
  <p>The Australian swag was born of Australia and no other land&mdash;of the
    Great Lone Land of magnificent distances and bright heat; the land of self-reliance,
    and never-give-in, and help-your-mate. The grave of many of the world&rsquo;s
    tragedies and comedies&mdash;royal and otherwise. The land where a man out
    of employment might shoulder his swag in Adelaide and take the track, and
    years later walk into a hut on the Gulf, or never be heard of any more, or
    a body be found in the bush and buried by the mounted police, or never found
    and never buried&mdash;what does it matter?</p>
  <p>The land I love above all others&mdash;not because it was kind to me, but
    because I was born on Australian soil, and because of the foreign father
    who died at his work in the ranks of Australian pioneers, and because of
    many things. Australia! My country! Her very name is music to me. God bless
    Australia! for the sake of the great hearts of the heart of her! God keep
    her clear of the old-world shams and social lies and mockery, and callous
    commercialism, and sordid shame! And heaven send that, if ever in my time
    her sons are called upon to fight for her young life and honour, I die with
    the first rank of them and be buried in Australian ground.</p>
  <p>But this will probably be called false, forced or &ldquo;maudlin sentiment&rdquo; here
    in England, where the mawkish sentiment of the music-halls, and the popular
    applause it receives, is enough to make a healthy man sick, and is only equalled
    by music-hall vulgarity. So I&rsquo;ll get on.</p>
  <p>In the old digging days the knapsack, or straps-across-the chest fashion,
    was tried, but the load pressed on a man&rsquo;s chest and impeded his breathing,
    and a man needs to have his bellows free on long tracks in hot, stirless
    weather. Then the &ldquo;horse-collar,&rdquo; or rolled military overcoat
    style&mdash;swag over one shoulder and under the other arm&mdash;was tried,
    but it was found to be too hot for the Australian climate, and was discarded
    along with Wellington boots and leggings. Until recently, Australian city
    artists and editors&mdash;who knew as much about the bush as Downing Street
    knows about the British colonies in general&mdash;seemed to think the horse-collar
    swag was still in existence; and some artists gave the swagman a stick, as
    if he were a tramp of civilization with an eye on the backyard and a fear
    of the dog. English artists, by the way, seem firmly convinced that the Australian
    bushman is born in Wellington boots with a polish on &rsquo;em you could
    shave yourself by.</p>
  <p>The swag is usually composed of a tent  &ldquo;fly&rdquo; or strip of calico
    (a cover for the swag and a shelter in bad weather&mdash;in New Zealand it
    is oilcloth or waterproof twill), a couple of blankets, blue by custom and
    preference, as that colour shows the dirt less than any other (hence the
    name &ldquo;bluey&rdquo; for swag), and the core is composed of spare clothing
    and small personal effects. To make or &ldquo;roll up&rdquo; your swag: lay
    the fly or strip of calico on the ground, blueys on top of it; across one
    end, with eighteen inches or so to spare, lay your spare trousers and shirt,
    folded, light boots tied together by the laces toe to heel, books, bundle
    of old letters, portraits, or whatever little knick-knacks you have or care
    to carry, bag of needles, thread, pen and ink, spare patches for your pants,
    and bootlaces. Lay or arrange the pile so that it will roll evenly with the
    swag (some pack the lot in an old pillowslip or canvas bag), take a fold
    over of blanket and calico the whole length on each side, so as to reduce
    the width of the swag to, say, three feet, throw the spare end, with an inward
    fold, over the little pile of belongings, and then roll the whole to the
    other end, using your knees and judgment to make the swag tight, compact
    and artistic; when within eighteen inches of the loose end take an inward
    fold in that, and bring it up against the body of the swag. There is a strong
    suggestion of a roley-poley in a rag about the business, only the ends of
    the swag are folded in, in rings, and not tied. Fasten the swag with three
    or four straps, according to judgment and the supply of straps. To the top
    strap, for the swag is carried (and eased down in shanty bars and against
    walls or veranda-posts when not on the track) in a more or less vertical
    position&mdash;to the top strap, and lowest, or lowest but one, fasten the
    ends of the shoulder strap (usually a towel is preferred as being softer
    to the shoulder), your coat being carried outside the swag at the back, under
    the straps. To the top strap fasten the string of the nose-bag, a calico
    bag about the size of a pillowslip, containing the tea, sugar and flour bags,
    bread, meat, baking-powder and salt, and brought, when the swag is carried
    from the left shoulder, over the right on to the chest, and so balancing
    the swag behind. But a swagman can throw a heavy swag in a nearly vertical
    position against his spine, slung from one shoulder only and without any
    balance, and carry it as easily as you might wear your overcoat. Some bushmen
    arrange their belongings so neatly and conveniently, with swag straps in
    a sort of harness, that they can roll up the swag in about a minute, and
    unbuckle it and throw it out as easily as a roll of wall-paper, and there&rsquo;s
    the bed ready on the ground with the wardrobe for a pillow. The swag is always
    used for a seat on the track; it is a soft seat, so trousers last a long
    time. And, the dust being mostly soft and silky on the long tracks out back,
    boots last marvellously. Fifteen miles a day is the average with the swag,
    but you must travel according to the water: if the next bore or tank is five
    miles on, and the next twenty beyond, you camp at the five-mile water to-night
    and do the twenty next day. But if it&rsquo;s thirty miles you have to do
    it. Travelling with the swag in Australia is variously and picturesquely
    described as &ldquo;humping bluey,&rdquo; &ldquo;walking Matilda,&rdquo; &ldquo;humping
    Matilda,&rdquo; &ldquo;humping your drum,&rdquo; &ldquo;being on the wallaby,&rdquo;  &ldquo;jabbing
    trotters,&rdquo; and &ldquo;tea and sugar burglaring,&rdquo; but most travelling
    shearers now call themselves trav&rsquo;lers, and say simply &ldquo;on the
    track,&rdquo; or  &ldquo;carrying swag.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And there you have the Australian swag. Men from all the world have carried
    it<i>&mdash;</i>lords and low-class Chinamen, saints and world martyrs, and
    felons, thieves, and murderers, educated gentlemen and boors who couldn&rsquo;t
    sign their mark, gentlemen who fought for Poland and convicts who fought
    the world, women, and more than one woman disguised as a man. The Australian
    swag has held in its core letters and papers in all languages, the honour
    of great houses, and more than one national secret, papers that would send
    well-known and highly-respected men to jail, and proofs of the innocence
    of men going mad in prisons, life tragedies and comedies, fortunes and papers
    that secured titles and fortunes, and the last pence of lost fortunes, life
    secrets, portraits of mothers and dead loves, pictures of fair women, heart-breaking
    old letters written long ago by vanished hands, and the pencilled manuscript
    of more than one book which will be famous yet.</p>
  <p>The weight of the swag varies from the light rouseabout&rsquo;s swag, containing
    one blanket and a clean shirt, to the  &ldquo;royal Alfred,&rdquo; with tent
    and all complete, and weighing part of a ton. Some old sundowners have a
    mania for gathering, from selectors&rsquo; and shearers&rsquo; huts, and
    dust-heaps, heart-breaking loads of rubbish which can never be of any possible
    use to them or anyone else. Here is an inventory of the contents of the swag
    of an old tramp who was found dead on the track, lying on his face on the
    sand, with his swag on top of him, and his arms stretched straight out as
    if he were embracing the mother earth, or had made, with his last movement,
    the sign of the cross to the blazing heavens</p>
  <p>Rotten old tent in rags. Filthy blue blanket, patched with squares of red
    and calico. Half of &ldquo;white blanket&rdquo; nearly black now, patched
    with pieces of various material and sewn to half of red blanket. Three-bushel
    sack slit open. Pieces of sacking. Part of a woman&rsquo;s skirt. Two rotten
    old pairs of moleskin trousers. One leg of a pair of trousers. Back of a
    shirt. Half a waistcoat. Two tweed coats, green, old and rotting, and patched
    with calico. Blanket, etc. Large bundle of assorted rags for patches, all
    rotten. Leaky billy-can, containing fishingline, papers, suet, needles and
    cotton, etc. Jam-tin, medicine bottles, corks on strings, to hang to his
    hat to keep the flies off (a sign of madness in the bush, for the corks would
    madden a sane man sooner than the flies could). Three boots of different
    sizes, all belonging to the right foot, and a left slipper. Coffeepot, without
    handle or spout, and quart-pot full of rubbish&mdash;broken knives and forks,
    with the handles burnt off, spoons, etc., picked up on rubbish-heaps; and
    many rusty nails, to be used as buttons, I suppose.</p>
  <p>Broken saw blade, hammer, broken crockery, old pannikins, small rusty frying-pan
    without a handle, children&rsquo;s old shoes, many bits of old bootleather
    and greenhide, part of yellowback novel, mutilated English dictionary, grammar
    and arithmetic book, a ready reckoner, a cookery book, a bulgy angloforeign
    dictionary, part of a Shakespeare, book in French and book in German, and
    a book on etiquette and courtship. A heavy pair of blucher boots, with uppers
    parched and cracked, and soles so patched (patch over patch) with leather,
    boot protectors, hoop-iron and hobnails that they were about two inches thick,
    and the boots weighed over five pounds. (If you don&rsquo;t believe me go
    into the Melbourne Museum, where, in a glass case in a place of honour, you
    will see a similar, perhaps the same, pair of bluchers labelled &ldquo;An
    example of colonial industry.&rdquo;) And in the core of the swag was a sugar-bag
    tied tightly with a whip-lash, and containing another old skirt, rolled very
    tight and fastened with many turns of a length of clothes-line, which last,
    I suppose, he carried to hang himself with if he felt that way. The skirt
    was rolled round a small packet of old portraits and almost indecipherable
    letters&mdash;one from a woman who had evidently been a sensible woman and
    a widow, and who stated in the letter that she did not intend to get married
    again as she had enough to do already, slavin&rsquo; her finger-nails off
    to keep a family, without having a second husband to keep. And her answer
    was &ldquo;final for good and all,&rdquo; and it wasn&rsquo;t no use comin&rsquo; &ldquo;bungfoodlin&rsquo;&rdquo; round
    her again. If he did she&rsquo;d set Satan on to him. &ldquo;Satan&rdquo; was
    a dog, I suppose.</p>
  <p>The letter was addressed to &ldquo;Dear Bill,&rdquo;  as were others. There
    were no envelopes. The letters were addressed from no place in particular,
    so there weren&rsquo;t any means of identifying the dead man. The police
    buried him under a gum, and a young trooper cut on the tree the words:</p>
  <p align="center">SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF<br>
    BILL<br>
    WHO DIED</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BuckoltsGate"></a>&ldquo;Buckolts&rsquo; Gate&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">An Australian Story </p>
  <h3 align="center">PROLOGUE</h3>
  <p>Old&nbsp;Abel Albury had a genius for getting the bull by the tail with
    a tight grip, and holding on with both hands and an obstinacy born of ignorance&mdash;and
    not necessarily for the sake of selfpreservation or selfishness&mdash;while
    all the time the bull might be, so to speak, rooting up life-long friendships
    and neighbourly relations, and upsetting domestic customs and traditions
    with his horns.</p>
  <p>Yes, Uncle Abel was always grasping the wrong end of things, and sticking
    to it with that human mulishness which is often stronger, and more often
    wearies and breaks down the opposition than an intelligent man&rsquo;s arguments.
    He was&mdash;or professed to be, the family said&mdash;unable for a long
    time to distinguish between his two grand-nephews, one of whom was short
    and fat, while the other was tall and thin, the only points of resemblance
    between them being that each possessed the old family nose and eyes. When
    they were boys he used to lay the strap about one in mistake for the other.
    They had a saying that Uncle Abel saw with ten squinting eyes.</p>
  <p>Also, he could never&mdash;or would not, as the family said&mdash;remember
    names. He referred to Mrs Porter, a thin, haggard selector&rsquo;s wife,
    as &ldquo;Mrs Stout&rdquo; and he balanced matters by calling Mrs Southwick &ldquo;Mrs
    Porterwicket&rdquo;&mdash;when he didn&rsquo;t address her as &ldquo;Mrs
    What&rsquo;s-the-woman&rsquo;s-name&rdquo;&mdash;and he succeeded in deeply
    offending both ladies.</p>
  <p>Uncle Abel was Mrs Carey&rsquo;s uncle. Down at the lower end of Carey&rsquo;s
    selection at Rocky Rises, in the extreme corner of the lower or outer paddock,
    were sliprails opening into the main road, which ran down along the siding,
    round the foot of a spur from ridge, and out west. These sliprails were called &ldquo;The
    Lower Sliprails&rdquo; by the family, and it occurred to Uncle Abel to refer
    to them as &ldquo;Buckolts&rsquo; Gate,&rdquo; for no other reason apparently
    than that Buckolts&rsquo; farm lay in that direction. The farm was about
    a mile further on, on the other side of the creek, and the gate leading to
    it from the main road was round the spur, out of sight of Carey&rsquo;s selection.
    It is quite possible that Uncle Abel reasoned the thing out for days, for
    of such material are some human brains. Sliprails, or a slip-panel, is a
    panel of fencing of which the rails are made to be slipped out of the mortise
    holes in the posts so as to give passage to horses, vehicles and cattle.
    I suppose Abel called it a gate, because he was always going to hang a proper
    gate there some day. The family were unaware of his new name for the Lower
    Sliprails, and after he had, on one or two occasions, informed the boys that
    they would find a missing cow or horse at the Buckolts&rsquo; Gate, and they
    had found it calmly camped at the Lower Sliprails, and after he had made
    several appointments to meet parties at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate, and had been
    found leaning obstinately on the fence by the Lower Sliprails with no explanation
    to offer other than that he was waiting at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate, they began
    to fear that he was becoming weak in his mind.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 align="center">Act&nbsp;I</h3>
  <p>It&nbsp;was New Year&rsquo;s Eve at Rocky Rises. There was no need for fireworks
    nor bonfires, for the bush-fires were out all along the ranges to the east,
    and, as night came on, lines and curves of lights&mdash;clear lights, white lights,
    and, in the nearer distance, red lights and smoky lights-marked the sidings
    and ridges of a western spur of the Blue Mountain Range, and seemed suspended
    against a dark sky, for the stars and the loom of the hills were hidden by
    smoke and drought haze.</p>
  <p>There was a dance at Careys&rsquo;. Old Carey was a cheerful, broad-minded
    bushman, haunted at times by the memories of old days, when he was the beau
    of the bush balls, and so when he built his new slab-and-bark barn he had
    it properly floored with hard-wood, and the floor well-faced &ldquo;to give
    the young people a show when they wanted a dance,&rdquo; he said. The floor
    had a spring in it, and bush boys and girls often rode twenty miles and more
    to dance on that floor. The girls said it was a lovely floor.</p>
  <p>On this occasion Carey had stacked his wheat outside until after the New
    Year. Spring-carts, and men and girls on horseback came in from miles round. &ldquo;Sperm&rdquo; candles
    had been cut up and thrown on the floor during the afternoon, and rubbed
    over by feet eased tightly in  &rsquo;lastic-sides; and hoops were hung horizontally
    from the tie-beams, with candles stuck round them. There were fresh-faced
    girls, and sweet, freckled-faced girls, and jolly girls, and shy girls&mdash;all
    sorts of girls except sulky, &ldquo;toney&rdquo; girls&mdash;and lanky chaps,
    most of them sawney, and weird, whiskered agriculturists, who watched the
    dancers with old, old time-worn smiles, or stood, or sat on their heels yarning,
    with their pipes, outside, where two boilers were slung over a log-fire to
    boil water for tea; and there were leathery women, with complexions like
    dried apples, who gossiped&mdash;for the first time in months perhaps&mdash;and
    watched the young people, and thought at times, no doubt, of other days&mdash;of
    other days when they were girls. (And not so far distant either, in some
    cases, for women dry quickly in the bush.)</p>
  <p>And there were one or two old soldiers and their wives, whose eyes glistened
    when Jim Bullock played &ldquo;The Girl I Left Behind Me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim Bullock was there with his concertina. He sat on a stool in front of
    a bench, on which was a beer-keg, piles of teacups and saucers, several big
    tin teapots, and plates of sandwiches, sponge-cakes, and tarts. Jim sat in
    his shirt-sleeves, with his flat-brimmed, wire-bound, &ldquo;hard-hitter&rdquo; hat
    on, slanting over his weaker eye. He held one leg loosely and the other rigid,
    with the concertina on his knee, and swanked away at the instrument by the
    hour, staring straight in front of him with the expression of a cod-fish,
    and never moving a muscle except the muscles of his great hairy arms and
    big chapped and sunblotched hands; while chaps in tight  &ldquo;larstins&rdquo; (elastic-side
    boots), slop suits of black, bound with braid, and with coats too short in
    the neck and arms, and trousers bell-mouthed at the bottoms, and some with
    paper collars, narrow red ribbon ties, or scarfs through walnut shells, held
    their partners rigidly, and went round the room with their eyes&mdash;most
    of them&mdash;cocked at the rafters in semi-idiotic ecstasy.</p>
  <p>But there was tall, graceful, pink-and-white Bertha Buckolt, blue-eyed
    and blue-black-haired, and little Mary Carey with the kind, grey eyes and
    red-gold hair; there was Mary&rsquo;s wild brother Jim, with curly black
    hair and blue eyes and dimples of innocence; and there was Harry Dale, the
    drover, Jim&rsquo;s shearing and droving mate, a tall, good-looking, brown-eyed
    and brown-haired young fellow, a &ldquo;better-class&rdquo;  bushman and
    the best dancer in the district. Uncle Abel usurped the position of M.C.,
    and roared &ldquo;Now then! take yer partners!&rdquo; and bawled instructions
    and interrupted and tangled up the dancers, until they got used to taking
    no notice of his bull voice. Mary Carey was too shy&mdash;because she loved
    him, and secretly and fondly hoped and doubted that he cared for her&mdash;to
    be seen dancing more than once with Harry Dale, so he shared Bertha Buckolt,
    the best girl dancer there, with Jim Carey, who danced with his sister when
    Harry was dancing with Bertha Buckolt, and who seemed, for some reason best
    known to himself, to be perfectly satisfied with the arrangement. Poor little
    Mary began to fret presently, and feel a little jealous of Bertha, her old
    schoolmate. She was little and couldn&rsquo;t dance like Bertha, and she
    couldn&rsquo;t help noticing how well Bertha looked to-night, and what a
    well-matched pair she and Harry made; and so, when twelve o&rsquo;clock came
    and they all went outside to watch the Old Year out and the New Year in&mdash;with
    a big bonfire on the distant ridge where the grass fires had reached a stretch
    of dry scrub&mdash;and to join hands all round and sing &ldquo;Auld Lang
    Syne,&rdquo; little Mary was not to be found, for she was sitting on a log
    round behind the cow-yard, crying softly to herself.</p>
  <p>And when about three o&rsquo;clock they all started home, Mary gave Bertha
    her check to kiss instead of her mouth, and that hurt Bertha, who had&nbsp;<i>her</i>&nbsp;cry
    riding home, to the astonishment and irritation of her brother Jack, who
    rode home with her.</p>
  <p>But when they were all gone Mary was missing again and when her mother called
    her, and, after a pause, the voice of Harry Dale said, respectfully, in the
    darkness, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s here, Mrs Carey, she&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; the
    two were discovered sitting on a convenient log of the wood-heap, with an
    awkward and overacted interval of log between them.</p>
  <p>Old Carey liked Harry Dale, and seemed very well satisfied with the way
    things appeared to be going. He pressed Harry to stay at the selection overnight. &ldquo;The
    missus will make you a shake-down on the floor,&rdquo; he said. Harry had
    no appointments, and stayed cheerfully, and old Carey, having had a whisky
    or two, insisted on Mary making the shake-down, and the old folks winked
    at each other behind the young folks&rsquo; backs to see how poor little
    Mary spread a spare mattress, with redhot, averted face, and found an extra
    pillow and a spare pair of ironed sheets for the shake-down.</p>
  <p>At sunrise she stole out to milk the cows, which was her regular duty; there
    was no other way out from her room than through the dining-room, where Harry
    lay on his back, with his arms folded, resting peacefully. He seemed sound
    asleep and safe for a good two hours, so she ventured. As she passed out
    she paused a moment looking down on him with all the lovelight in her eyes,
    and, obeying a sudden impulse, she stooped softly and touched his forehead
    with her lips, then she slipped out. Harry stretched, opened his eyes, winked
    solemnly at the ceiling, and then, after a decent interval, he got up, dressed,
    and went out to help her to milk.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Harry Dale and Jim Carey were going out to take charge of a mob of bullocks
    going north-west, away up in Queensland, and as they had lost a day and night
    to be at the dance, they decided to start in the cool of the evening and
    travel all night. Mary walked from the homestead to the Lower Sliprails between
    her brother, who rode&mdash;because he was her brother&mdash;and led a packhorse
    on the other side, and Harry, who walked and led his horse&mdash;because
    he was her sweetheart, avowed only since last night.</p>
  <p>There were thunderstorms about, and Mary had repented sufficiently with
    regard to Bertha Buckolt to wear on her shoulders a cape which Bertha had
    left behind her last night.</p>
  <p>When they reached the Lower Sliprails Jim said he&rsquo;d go on and that
    Harry needn&rsquo;t hurry: he stooped over his horse&rsquo;s neck, kissed
    his sister, promised to keep away from the drink, not to touch a card, and
    to leave off fighting, and rode on. And when he rounded the Spur he saw a
    tall, graceful figure slipping through the trees from the creek towards Buckolts&rsquo; Gate.</p>
  <p>Then came the critical time at the Lower Sliprails. The shadows from the
    setting sun lengthened quickly on the siding, and then the sun slipped out
    of sight over a &ldquo;saddle&rdquo; in the ridges, and all was soon dusk
    save the sunlit peaks of the Blue Mountains away to the east over the sweeps
    of blue-grey bush.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! Mary,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;I must make a start now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll&mdash;you&rsquo;ll look after Jim, won&rsquo;t you,
    Harry?&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will, Mary, for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her mouth began to twitch, her chin to tremble, and her eyes brimmed suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must cheer up, Mary,&rdquo; he said with her in his arms. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    be back before you know where you are, and then we&rsquo;ll be married right
    off at once and settle down for life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She smiled bravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Mary!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Harry!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He led his horse through the rails and lifted them, with trembling hands,
    and shot them home. Another kiss across the top rail and he got on his horse.
    She mounted the lower rail, and he brought his horse close alongside the
    fence and stooped to kiss her again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Mary!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll
    do&mdash;when I come back I&rsquo;ll whistle when I reach the Spur and you
    be here to let the sliprails down for me. I&rsquo;ll time myself to get here
    about sundown. I&rsquo;ll whistle &lsquo;Willie Riley,&rsquo; so you&rsquo;ll
    know it&rsquo;s me. Good-bye, little girl! I must go now. Don&rsquo;t fret&mdash;the
    time will soon go by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned, swung his horse, and rode slowly down the track, turning now
    and again to wave his hand to her, with a farewell flourish of his hat as
    he rounded the Spur. His track, five hundred miles, or perhaps a thousand,
    into the great north-west; his time, six months, or perhaps a year. Hers
    a hundred yards or so back to the dusty, dreary drudgery of selection life.</p>
  <p>The daylight faded into starlight, the sidings grew very dim, and a faint
    white figure blurred against the bars of the slippanel.</p>
  <h3 align="center">Act&nbsp;II</h3>
  <p>It&nbsp;was the last day of the threshing&mdash;shortly after New Year&mdash;at
    Rocky Rises. The green boughs, which had been lashed to the veranda-posts
    on Christmas Eve, had withered and been used for firewood. The travelling
    steamer had gone with its gang of men, and the family sat down to tea, the
    men tired with hard work and heat, and with prickly heat and irritating wheaten
    chaff and dust under their clothes&mdash;and with smut (for the crop had
    been a smutty one) &ldquo;up their brains&rdquo; as Uncle Abel said&mdash;the
    women worn out with cooking for a big gang of shearers.</p>
  <p>Good-humoured Aunt Emma&mdash;who was Uncle Abel&rsquo;s niece&mdash;recovered
    first, and started the conversation. There were one or two neighbours&rsquo; wives
    who had lent crockery and had come over to help with the cooking in their
    turns. Jim Carey&rsquo;s name came up incidentally, but was quickly dropped,
    for ill reports of Jim had come home. Then Aunt Emma mentioned Harry Dale,
    and glanced meaningly at Mary, whose face flamed as she bent over her plate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Mary,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing
    to be ashamed of. We were all girls once. There&rsquo;s many a girl would
    jump at Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who says I&rsquo;m ashamed?&rdquo; said Mary, straightening up indignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease her, Emma,&rdquo; said Mrs Carey, mildly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell yer what,&rdquo; said young Tom Carey, frankly, &ldquo;Mary
    got a letter from him to-day. I seen her reading it behind the house. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>Mary&rsquo;s face flamed again and went down over her plate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said her mother, with sudden interest, &ldquo;did Harry
    say anything of Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t
    tell you about the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a pause. Then Tommy said, with that delightful tact which usually
    characterizes young Tommies:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Mary needn&rsquo;t be so cocky about Harry Dale, anyhow. I
    seen him New Year&rsquo;s Eve when we had the dance. I seen him after the
    dance liftin&rsquo; Bertha Buckolt onter her horse in the dark&mdash;as if
    she couldn&rsquo;t get on herself&mdash;she&rsquo;s big enough. I seen him
    lift her on, an&rsquo; he took her right up an&rsquo; lifted her right inter
    the saddle, &rsquo;stead of holdin&rsquo; his hand for her to tread on like
    that new-chum jackeroo we had. An&rsquo;, what&rsquo;s more, I seen him hug
    her an&rsquo; give her a kiss before he lifted her on. He told her he was
    as good as her brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did he mean by that, Tommy?&rdquo; asked Mrs Porter, to break
    an awkward pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;m I ter know what he means?&rdquo; said Tommy, politely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, Tommy, I seen Harry Dale give young Tommy Carey a lick with
    a strap the day before New Year&rsquo;s Eve for throwing his sister&rsquo;s
    cat into the dam,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, coming to poor Mary&rsquo;s rescue.  &ldquo;Never
    mind, Mary, my dear, he said goodbye to you last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&nbsp;<i>he didn&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo; roared Uncle Abel.</p>
  <p>They were used to Uncle Abel&rsquo;s sudden bellowing, but it startled them
    this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Uncle Abel,&rdquo; cried both Aunt Emma and Mrs Carey, &ldquo;whatever
    do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I means is that I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to have the feelin&rsquo;s
    of a niece of mine trifled with. What I means is that I seen Harry Dale with
    Bertha Buckolt on New Year&rsquo;s night after he left here. That&rsquo;s
    what I means&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak so loud, Abel, we&rsquo;re not deaf,&rdquo; interrupted
    Carey, as Mary started up white-faced. &ldquo;What do you want to always
    shout for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I speak loud because I want people to hear me!&rdquo; roared Uncle
    Abel, turning on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Uncle Abel,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;tell me what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Uncle Abel, lowering his voice a little, &ldquo;that
    I seen Harry Dale and Bertha Buckolt at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate that night&mdash;I
    seen it all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At&nbsp;<i>Buckolts&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;Gate!&rdquo;  cried Mary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Yes!</i>&nbsp;at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate! Ain&rsquo;t I speakin&rsquo; loud
    enough?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And where were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind wheers I was. I was comin&rsquo;  home along the ridges,
    and I seen them. I seen them say good-bye; I seen them hug an&rsquo; kiss&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Abel!&rdquo; exclaimed Aunt Emma.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use Uncle Abelin&rsquo; me. What I sez I sez. I ain&rsquo;t
    a-goin&rsquo; to have a niece of mine bungfoodled&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Abel,&rdquo; cried Mary, staring at him wild-eyed, &ldquo;do
    be careful what you say. You must have made a mistake. Are you sure it was
    Bertha and Harry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I sure my head&rsquo;s on me neck?&rdquo; roared Uncle Abel. &ldquo;Would
    I see &rsquo;em if I didn&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em? I tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now wait a moment, Uncle Abel,&rdquo;  interrupted Mary, with dangerous
    calmness. &ldquo;Listen to me. Harry Dale and I are engaged to be married,
    and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got the writin&rsquo;s!&rdquo; shouted Uncle Abel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The writin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s where you are,&rdquo; said Uncle Abel, triumphantly. &ldquo;If
    you had the writin&rsquo;s you could sue him for breach of contract.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Uncle Abel, who couldn&rsquo;t read, had no faith whatever in verbal agreements
    (he wouldn&rsquo;t sign one, he said), all others he referred to as &ldquo;writings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, listen to me, Uncle Abel,&rdquo; said Mary, trembling now. &ldquo;Are
    you sure you saw Harry Dale and Bertha Buckolt at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate after
    he left here that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, I seen young Tommy there ridin&rsquo; on
    his pony along by the Spur a little while after, an&rsquo; he muster seen
    them too, if he&rsquo;s got a tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary turned quickly to her brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say,&rdquo; said Tommy, quietened now, &ldquo;is
    that I seen&nbsp;<i>her</i>&nbsp;at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate that night. I was
    comin&rsquo; home from Two-Mile Flat, and I met Jim with his packhorse about
    a mile the other side of Buckolts&rsquo;, and while we was talkin&rsquo; Harry
    Dale caught up, so I jist said &lsquo;So-long&rsquo; an&rsquo; left &rsquo;em.
    And when I got to Buckolt&rsquo;s Gate I seen Bertha Buckolt. She was standin&rsquo; under
    a tree, and she looked as if she was cryin&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Mary got her bonnet and started out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going to, Mary?&rdquo; asked her mother, starting up
    nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going across to Buckolts&rsquo; to find out the truth,&rdquo; said
    Mary, and she went out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better let her go, Lizzie,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, detaining her sister. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
    done it now, Uncle Abel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t she get the writin&rsquo;s?&rdquo;  retorted
    Uncle Abel.</p>
  <p>Half-way to Buckolts&rsquo; Mary met Bertha Buckolt herself, coming over
    to the selection for the first time since the night of the party. Bertha
    started forward to kiss Mary, but stopped short as Mary stood stock-still
    and faced her, with her hands behind her back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! whatever is the matter, Mary?&rdquo;  exclaimed Bertha.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know very well, Bertha.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! Whatever do you mean? What have I done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What haven&rsquo;t you done? You&rsquo;ve&mdash;you&rsquo;ve broken
    my heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good gracious me! Whatever are you talking about? Tell me what it
    is, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You met him at your gate that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Bertha! How could you be so mean and deceitful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mean and deceitful! What do you mean by that? Whatever are you talking
    about? I suppose I&rsquo;ve got as good a right to meet him as anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Mary, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
    only stringing him on. You only did it to spite me. You helped him to deceive
    me. You ought to be ashamed to look me in the face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good gracious! Whatever are you talking about? Ain&rsquo;t I good
    enough for him? I ought to be, God knows! I suppose he can marry who he likes,
    and if I&rsquo;m poor fool enough to love him and marry him, what then? Mary,
    you ought to be the last to speak&mdash;speak to&mdash;to me like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. He can marry all the girls in the country for all I care. I
    never want to see either him or you any more. You&rsquo;re a cruel, deceitful,
    brazen-faced hussy, and he&rsquo;s a heartless, deceiving blackguard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary! I believe you&rsquo;re mad,&rdquo; said Bertha, firmly. &ldquo;How
    dare you speak to me like that! And as for him being a blackguard. Why, you
    ought to be the last in the world to say such a thing; you ought to be the
    last to say a word against him. Why, I don&rsquo;t believe you ever cared
    a rap for him in spite of all your pretence. He could go to the devil for
    all you cared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Bertha Buckolt!&rdquo; cried Mary. &ldquo;<i>You</i>&mdash;you!
    Why, you&rsquo;re a barefaced girl, that&rsquo;s what you are! I don&rsquo;t
    want to see your brazen face again.&rdquo; With that she turned and stumbled
    blindly in the direction of home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send back my cape,&rdquo; cried Bertha as she too turned away.</p>
  <p>Mary walked wildly home and fled to her room and locked the door. Bertha
    did likewise.</p>
  <p>Mary let Aunt Emma in after a while, ceased sobbing and allowed. herself
    to be comforted a little. Next morning she was out milking at the usual time,
    but there were dark hollows under her eyes, and her little face was white
    and set. After breakfast she rolled the cape up very tight in a brown-paper
    parcel, addressed it severely to&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">MISS BERTHA BUCKOLT<br>
    Eurunderee Creek</p>
  <p>and sent it home by one of the school-children.</p>
  <p>She wrote to Harry Dale and told him that she knew all about it (not stating
    what), but she forgave him and hoped he&rsquo;d be happy. She never wanted
    to see his face again, and enclosed his portrait.</p>
  <p>Harry, who was as true and straight as a bushman could be, puzzled it out
    and decided that some one of his old love affairs must have come to Mary&rsquo;s
    ears, and wrote demanding an explanation.</p>
  <p>She never answered that letter.</p>
  <h3 align="center">Act&nbsp;III</h3>
  <p>It&nbsp;was Christmas Day at Rocky Rises. The plum puddings had been made,
    as usual, weeks beforehand, and hung in rags to the tie-beams and taken down
    and boiled again. Poultry had been killed and plucked and cooked, and all
    the toil had been gone through, and every preparation made for a red-hot
    dinner on a blazing hot day&mdash;and for no other reason than that our great-grandmothers
    used to do it in a cold climate at Christmas-times that came in mid-winter.
    Merry men hadn&rsquo;t gone forth to the wood to gather in the mistletoe
    (if they ever did in England, in the olden days, instead of sending shivering,
    wretched vassals in rags to do it); but Uncle Abel had gone gloomily up the
    ridge on Christmas Eve, with an axe on his shoulder (and Tommy unwillingly
    in tow, scowling and making faces behind his back), and had cut young pines
    and dragged them home and lashed them firmly to the veranda-posts, which
    was the custom out there.</p>
  <p>There was little goodwill or peace between the three or four farms round
    Rocky Rises that Christmas Day, and Uncle Abel had been the cause of most
    of the ill-feeling, though they didn&rsquo;t know, and he was least aware
    of it of any.</p>
  <p>It all came about in this way.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Shortly after last New Year Ryan&rsquo;s bull had broken loose and gone
    astray for two days and nights, breaking into neighbours&rsquo; paddocks
    and filling himself with hay and damaging other bulls, and making love by
    night and hiding in the scrub all day. On the second night he broke through
    and jumped over Reid&rsquo;s fences, and destroyed about an acre of grape-vines
    and adulterated Reid&rsquo;s stock, besides interfering with certain heifers
    which were not of a marriageable age. There was a &pound;5 penalty on a stray
    bull. Reid impounded the bull and claimed heavy damages. Ryan, a small selector
    of little account, was always pulling some neighbour to court when he wasn&rsquo;t
    being &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; himself, so he went to court over this case.</p>
  <p>Now, it appears that the bull, on his holiday, had spent a part of the first
    night in Carey&rsquo;s lower paddock, and Uncle Abel (who was out mooching
    about the bush at all hours, &ldquo;havin&rsquo; a look at some timber&rdquo; or
    some &ldquo;indercations&rdquo; [of gold], or on some mysterious business
    or fad, the mystery of which was of his own making)&mdash;Uncle Abel saw
    the bull in the paddock at daylight and turned it out the sliprails, and
    talked about it afterwards, referring to the sliprails as &ldquo;Buckolts&rsquo; Gate,&rdquo; of
    course, and spoke mysteriously of the case, and put on an appearance of great
    importance, and allowed people to get an idea that he knew a lot if he only
    liked to speak; and finally he got himself &ldquo;brought up&rdquo; as a
    witness for Ryan.</p>
  <p>He had a lot of beer in town before he went to the courthouse. All he knew
    would have been of no use to either party, but he swore that he had seen
    Ryan&rsquo;s bull inside Buckolts&rsquo; Gate at daylight (on the day which
    wasn&rsquo;t in question) and had turned him out. Uncle Abel mixed up the
    court a good deal, and roared like the bull, and became more obstinate the
    more he was cross-examined, and narrowly escaped being committed for contempt
    of court.</p>
  <p>Ryan, who had a high opinion of the breed of his bull, got an idea that
    the Buckolts had enticed or driven the bull into their paddock for stock-raising
    purposes, instead of borrowing it honestly or offering to pay for the use
    of it. Then Ryan wanted to know why Abel had driven his bull out of Buckolts&rsquo; Gate,
    and the Buckolts wanted to know what business Abel Albury had to drive Ryan&rsquo;s
    bull out of their paddock, if the bull had really ever been there. And so
    it went on till Rocky Rises was ripe for a tragedy.</p>
  <p>The breach between the Careys and the Buckolts was widened, the quarrel
    between Ryan and Reid intensified. Ryan got a down on the Careys because
    he reckoned that Uncle Abel had deliberately spoilt his case with his evidence;
    and the Reids and Careys were no longer on speaking terms, because nothing
    would convince old Reid that Abel hadn&rsquo;t tried to prove that Ryan&rsquo;s
    bull had never been in Reid&rsquo;s paddock at all.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Well, it was Christmas Day, and the Carey family and Aunt Emma sat down
    to dinner. Jim was present, having arrived overnight, with no money, as usual,
    and suffering a recovery. The elder brother, Bob (who had a selection up-country),
    and his wife were there. Mrs Carey moved round with watchful eyes and jealous
    ears, lest there should be a word or a look which might hurt the feelings
    of her wild son&mdash;for of such are mothers.</p>
  <p>Dinner went on very moodily, in spite of Aunt Emma, until at last Jim spoke&mdash;almost
    for the first time, save for a long-whispered and, on his part, repentant
    conversation with his mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Mary!&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;What did you throw Harry
    Dale over for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rot! What did he do to you? I&rsquo;m your brother&rdquo;  (with
    a glance at Bob), &ldquo;and I ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, ask Bertha Buckolt. She saw him last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Jim! You&rsquo;ll make her cry,&rdquo; said Aunt
    Emma.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s it all about, anyway?&rdquo;  demanded Jim. &ldquo;All
    I know is that Mary wrote to Harry and threw him over, and he ain&rsquo;t
    been the same man since. He swears he&rsquo;ll never come near the district
    again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell Jim, Aunt Emma,&rdquo; said Mary. And Aunt Emma started to tell
    the story as far as she knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saw her at Buckolt&rsquo;s sliprails!&rdquo; cried Jim, starting
    up. &ldquo;Well, he couldn&rsquo;t have had time to more than say good-bye
    to her, for I was with her there myself, and Harry caught up to me within
    a mile of the gate&mdash;and I rode pretty fast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He had a jolly long good-bye with her,&rdquo;  shouted Uncle Abel. &ldquo;Look
    here, Jim! I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to stand by and see a nephew of mine
    bungfoodled by no girl; an&rsquo;, I tell you I seen &rsquo;em huggin&rsquo; and
    kissin&rsquo;  and canoodlin&rsquo; for half an hour at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash; Look here, Uncle Abel, be careful
    what you say. You&rsquo;ve got the bull by the tail again, that&rsquo;s what
    it is!&rdquo; Jim&rsquo;s face grew whiter&mdash;and it had been white enough
    on account of the drink. &ldquo;How did you know it was them? You&rsquo;re
    always mistaking people. It might have been someone else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know Harry Dale on horseback two miles off!&rdquo; roared Uncle
    Abel. &ldquo;And I knowed her by her cape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Mary&rsquo;s turn to gasp and stare at Uncle Abel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Abel,&rdquo; she managed to say, &ldquo;Uncle Abel! Wasn&rsquo;t
    it at our Lower Sliprails you saw them and not Buckolts&rsquo; Gate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; bellowed Uncle Abel. &ldquo;You might call &rsquo;em
    the &lsquo;Lower Sliprails,&rsquo; but I calls &rsquo;em Buckolts&rsquo; Gate!
    They lead to&rsquo;r&rsquo;ds Buckolts&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t they? Hey? Them
    other sliprails&rdquo;&mdash;jerking his arms in the direction of the upper
    paddock&mdash;&ldquo;them theer other sliprails that leads outer Reid&rsquo;s
    lane I calls Reid&rsquo;s Sliprails. I don&rsquo;t know nothing about no
    upper or lower, or easter or wester, or any other la-di-dah names you like
    to call &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, uncle,&rdquo; cried Mary, trembling like a leaf, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t
    you explain this before? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What cause have I got to tell any of you everything I sez or does
    or thinks? It &rsquo;ud take me all me time. Ain&rsquo;t you got any more
    brains than Ryan&rsquo;s bull, any of you? Hey!&mdash;You&rsquo;ve got heads,
    but so has cabbages. Explain! Why, if the world wasn&rsquo;t stuffed so full
    of jumped-up fools there&rsquo;d be never no need for explainin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary left the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Mary?&rdquo; cried Aunt Emma.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going across to Bertha,&rdquo; said Mary, putting on her
    hat with trembling hands. &ldquo;It was me Uncle Abel saw. I had Bertha&rsquo;s
    cape on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Abel,&rdquo; cried Aunt Emma,  &ldquo;whatever have you
    done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Uncle Abel, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t she get the
    writin&rsquo;s as I told her? It&rsquo;s to be hoped she won&rsquo;t make
    such a fool of herself next time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Half an hour later, or thereabouts, Mary sat on Bertha Buckolt&rsquo;s bed,
    with Bertha beside her and Bertha&rsquo;s arm round her, and they were crying
    and laughing by turns.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t you tell me it was Jim?&rdquo; said
    Mary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me it was Harry, Mary?&rdquo; asked Bertha. &ldquo;It
    would have saved all this year of misery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see Harry Dale at all that night,&rdquo; said Bertha. &ldquo;I
    was&mdash;I was crying when Jim left me, and when Harry came along I slipped
    behind a tree until he was past. And now, look here, Mary, I can&rsquo;t
    marry Jim until he steadies down, but I&rsquo;ll give him another chance.
    But, Mary, I&rsquo;d sooner lose him than you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Bertha walked home with Mary, and during the afternoon she took Jim aside
    and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Jim, I&rsquo;ll give you another chance&mdash;for a year.
    Now I want you to ride into town and send a telegram to Harry Dale. How long
    would it take him to get here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t get here before New Year,&rdquo;  said Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Bertha, and Jim went to catch his horse.</p>
  <p>Next day Harry&rsquo;s reply came: &ldquo;Coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center">Act&nbsp;IV</h3>
  <p>New&nbsp;Year&rsquo;s Eve. The dance was at Buckolts&rsquo; this year, but
    Bertha didn&rsquo;t dance much; she was down by the gate most of the time
    with little Mary Carey, waiting, and watching the long, white road, and listening
    for horses&rsquo; feet, and disappointed often as other horsemen rode by
    or turned up to the farm.</p>
  <p>And in the hot sunrise that morning, within a hundred miles of Rocky Rises,
    a tired, dusty drover camped in the edge of a scrub, boiled his quart-pot,
    broiled a piece of mutton on the coals, and lay down on the sand to rest
    an hour or so before pushing on to a cattle station he knew to try and borrow
    fresh horses. He had ridden all night.</p>
  <p>Old Buckolt and Carey and Reid smoked socially under the grape-vines, with
    bottles of whisky and glasses, and nudged each other and coughed when they
    wanted to laugh at Old Abel Albury, who was, for about the first time in
    his life, condescending to explain. He was explaining to them what thund&rsquo;rin&rsquo; fools
    they had been.</p>
  <p>Later on they sent a boy on horseback with a bottle of whisky and a message
    to Ryan, who turned up in time to see the New Year in with them and contradict
    certain slanders concerning the breed of his bull.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Bertha comforted Mary, and at last persuaded her to go home. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    sure to be here to-morrow, Mary,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you need to
    look fresh and happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Mary didn&rsquo;t sleep that night; she was up before daylight, had
    the kettle on and some chops ready to fry, and at daybreak she was down by
    the sliprails again. She was turning away for the second time when she heard
    a clear whistle round the Spur&mdash;then the tune of  &ldquo;Willie Riley,&rdquo; and
    the hobblechains and camp-ware on the packhorse jingling to the tune.</p>
  <p>She pulled out the rails with eager, trembling hands and leaned against
    the tree.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>An hour later a tired drover lay on his back, in his ragged, track-worn
    clothes and dusty leggings, on Mary&rsquo;s own little bed in the skillion
    off the living-room, and rested. Mary bustled round getting breakfast ready,
    and singing softly to herself; once she slipped in, bent over Harry and kissed
    him gently on the lips, and ran out as he stirred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; exclaimed Uncle Abel, poking round
    early and catching a glimpse of Harry through the open door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Harry, Uncle Abel,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
  <p>Uncle Abel peered in again to make sure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, be sure you git the writin&rsquo;s this time,&rdquo; he said.</p>

    over his run, and cropped the ground bare where even the poor grass might
    have saved thousands of sheep&mdash;and the rabbits cost the squatter hundreds
    of pounds in &ldquo;rabbit-proof&rdquo; fences, trappers&rsquo; wages, etc.,
    just to keep them down. Then came arrangements with the bank. And then Wall&rsquo;s
    wife died. Wall started to brood over other days, and the days that had gone
    between, and developed a temper which drove his children from home one by
    one, till only Mary was left. She managed the lonely home with the help of
    a half-caste. Then in good seasons came the selectors.</p>
  <p>Men remembered Wall as a grand boss and a good fellow, but that was in the
    days before rabbits and banks, and syndicates and &ldquo;pastoralists,&rdquo; or
    pastoral companies instead of good squatters.</p>
  <p>Runs were mostly pastoral leases for which the squatter paid the Government
    so much per square mile (almost a nominal rent). Selections were small holdings
    taken up by farmers under residential and other conditions and paid for by
    instalments. If you were not ruined by the drought, and paid up long enough,
    the land became freehold. The writer is heir to a dusty patch of three hundred
    acres or so in the scrub which was taken up thirty years ago and isn&rsquo;t
    freehold yet.</p>
  <p>Selectors were allowed to take up land on runs or pastoral leases as well
    as on unoccupied Crown lands, and as they secured the best bits of land,
    and on water frontages if they could, and as, of course, selections reduced
    the area of the run, the squatters loved selectors like elder brothers. One
    man is allowed to select only a certain amount of land, and required by law
    to live on it, so the squatters bought as much freehold about the homestead
    as they could afford, selected as much as they are allowed to by law, and
    sometimes employed &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; selectors to take up choice bits about
    the runs and hold them for them. They fought selectors in many various ways,
    and, in some cases, annoyed and persecuted them with devilish ingenuity.</p>
  <p>Ross was a selector, and a very hard man physically. He was a short, nuggety
    man with black hair and frill beard (a little dusty), bushy black eyebrows,
    piercing black eyes, horny knotted hands, and the obstinacy or pluck of a
    dozen men to fight drought and the squatter. Ross selected on Wall&rsquo;s
    run, in a bend of Sandy Creek, a nice bit of land with a black soil, flat
    and red soil sidings from the ridges, which no one had noticed before, and
    with the help of his boys he got the land cleared and fenced in a year or
    two&mdash;taking bush contracts about the district between whiles to make &ldquo;tucker&rdquo; for
    the family until he got his first crop off.</p>
  <p>Wall was never accused of employing dummies, or underhanded methods in dealings
    with selectors, but he had been through so much and had brooded so long that
    he had grown very hard and bitter and suspicious, and the reverse of generous&mdash;as
    many men do who start out in life too soft and goodhearted and with too much
    faith in human nature. He was a tall, dark man. He ordered Ross&rsquo;s boys
    off the run, impounded Ross&rsquo;s stock&mdash;before Ross had got his fencing
    finished, summoned Ross for trespass, and Ross retaliated as well as he could,
    until at last it mightn&rsquo;t have been safe for one of those men to have
    met the other with a gun. The impounding of the selector&rsquo;s cattle led
    to the last bad quarrel between Wall and his son Billy, who was a tall, good-natured
    Cornstalk, and who reckoned that Australia was big enough for all of us.
    One day in the drought, and in an extra bitter mood, Wall heard that some
    of his sheep had been dogged in the vicinity of Ross&rsquo;s selection, and
    he ordered Billy to take a station-hand and watch Ross&rsquo;s place all
    night, and, if Ross&rsquo;s cattle put their noses over the boundary, to
    drive them to the pound, fifteen miles away; also to lay poisoned baits for
    the dogs all round the selection. And Billy flatly refused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know Ross and the boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
    believe they dogged the sheep. Why, they&rsquo;ve only got a Newfoundland
    pup and an old lame, one-eyed sheep-dog that couldn&rsquo;t hurt a flea.
    Now, father, this sort of thing has been going on long enough. What difference
    does a few paltry acres make to us? The country is big enough, God knows!
    Ross is a straight man and&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake, give the man a chance
    to get his ground fenced in; he&rsquo;s doing it as fast as he can, and he
    can&rsquo;t watch his cattle day and night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you going to do as I tell you, or are you not?&rdquo; shouted
    Wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, if it comes to that, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    not going to sneak round a place all night and watch for a chance to pound
    a poor man&rsquo;s cows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was an awful row, down behind the wool-shed, and things looked so bad
    that old Peter, the station-hand, who was a witness, took off his coat and
    rolled up his sleeves, ready, as he said afterwards, &ldquo;to roll into&rdquo; either
    the father or the son if one raised a hand against the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; said Billy, though rather sobered by the sight of
    his father&rsquo;s trembling, choking passion, &ldquo;do you call yourself
    an Englishman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; yelled Wall, furiously. &ldquo;What the hell do you call
    yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If it comes to that I&rsquo;m an Australian,&rdquo; said Billy, and
    he turned away and went to catch his horse. He went up-country and knocked
    about in the north-west for a year or two.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>II<br>
    Romeo And Juliet</b></h3>
  <p>Mary Wall was twenty-five. She was an Australian bush girl every inch of
    her five-foot-nine; she had a pink-and-white complexion, dark blue eyes,
    blue-black hair, and &ldquo;the finest figure in the district,&rdquo; on
    horseback or afoot. She was the best girl-rider too (saddle or bare-back),
    and they say that when she was a tomboy she used to tuck her petticoats under
    her and gallop man-fashion through the scrub after horses or cattle. She
    said she was going to be an old maid.</p>
  <p>There came a jackeroo on a visit to the station. He was related to the bank
    with which Wall had relations. He was a dude, with an expensive education
    and no brains. He was very vain of his education and prospects. He regarded
    Mary with undisguised admiration, and her father had secret hopes. One evening
    the jackeroo was down by the homestead-gate when Mary came cantering home
    on her tall chestnut. The gate was six feet or more, and the jackeroo raised
    his hat and hastened to open it, but Mary reined her horse back a few yards
    and the  &ldquo;dood&rdquo; had barely time to jump aside when there was
    a scuffle of hoofs on the road, a &ldquo;Ha-ha-ha!&rdquo; in mid-air, a landing
    thud, and the girl was away up the home-track in a cloud of dust.</p>
  <p>A few days later the jackeroo happened to be at Kelly&rsquo;s, a wayside
    shanty, watching a fight between two bushmen, when Mary rode up. She knew
    the men. She whipped her horse in between them and struck at first one and
    then the other with her riding-whip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and
    both married men, too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It evidently struck them that way, for after a bit they shook hands and
    went home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I wouldn&rsquo;t have married that girl for a thousand pounds,&rdquo;  said
    the jackeroo, relating the incidents to some friends in Sydney.</p>
  <p>Mary said she wanted a man, if she could get one.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>There was no life at home nowadays, so Mary went to all the bush dances
    in the district. She thought nothing of riding twenty or thirty miles to
    a dance, dancing all night, and riding home again next morning. At one of
    these dances she met young Robert Ross, a clean-limbed, good-looking young
    fellow about her own age. She danced with him and liked him, and danced with
    him again, and he rode part of the way home with her. The subject of the
    quarrel between the two homes came up gradually.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The boss,&rdquo; said Robert, meaning his father, &ldquo;the boss
    is always ready to let bygones be bygones. It&rsquo;s a pity it couldn&rsquo;t
    be fixed up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary, looking at him (Bob looked very well on horseback), &ldquo;it
    is a pity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They met several times, and next Prince of Wales&rsquo;s birthday they rode
    home from the races together. Both had good horses, and they happened to
    be far ahead of the others on the wide, straight clear road that ran between
    the walls of the scrub. Along, about dusk, they became very confidential
    indeed&mdash;Mary had remarked what a sad and beautiful sunset it was. The
    horses got confidential, too, and shouldered together, and touched noses,
    and, after a long interval in the conversation, during which Robert, for
    one, began to breathe quickly, he suddenly leaned over, put his arm round
    her waist and made to kiss her. She jerked her body away, threw up her whiphand,
    and Robert ducked instinctively; but she brought her whip down on her horse&rsquo;s
    flank instead, and raced ahead. Robert followed&mdash;or, rather, his horse
    did: he thought it was a race, and took the bit in his teeth. Robert kept
    calling, appealing:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a while, Mary! I want to explain! I want to apologize! For God&rsquo;s
    sake listen to me, Mary!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Mary didn&rsquo;t hear him. Perhaps she misunderstood the reason of
    the chase and gave him credit for a spice of the devil in his nature. But
    Robert grew really desperate; he felt that the thing must be fixed up now
    or never, and gave his horse a free rein. Her horse was the fastest, and
    Robert galloped in the dust from his heels for about a mile and a half; then
    at the foot of a rise Mary&rsquo;s horse stumbled and nearly threw her over
    his head, and then he stopped like the good horse he was.</p>
  <p>Robert got down feeling instinctively that he might best make his peace
    on foot, and approached Mary with a face of misery&mdash;she had dropped
    her whip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Bob!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m knocked out;&rdquo; and
    she slipped down into his arms and stayed there a while.</p>
  <p>They sat on a log and rested, while their horses made inquiries of each
    other&rsquo;s noses, and compared notes.</p>
  <p>And after a good while Mary said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Bob, it&rsquo;s no use talking of marrying just yet. I like you.
    Bob, but I could never marry you while things are as they are between your
    father and mine. Now, that&rsquo;ll do. Let me get on my horse, Bob. I&rsquo;ll
    be safer there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Bob, and don&rsquo;t be stupid.&rdquo; She met him often
    and &ldquo;liked&rdquo;  him.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>III<br>
    A Tramp&rsquo;s Match And What It Did</b></h3>
  <p>It was Christmas Eve at Wall&rsquo;s, but there was no score or so of buggies
    and horses and dozens of strange dogs round the place as of old. The glasses
    and decanters were dusty on the heavy old-fashioned sideboard in the dining-room;
    and there was only a sullen, brooding man leaning over the hurdles and looking
    at his rams in the yard, and a sullen, brooding halfcaste at work in the
    kitchen. Mary had ridden away that morning to visit a girl chum.</p>
  <p>It was towards the end of a long drought, and the country was like tinder
    for hundreds of miles round&mdash;the ground for miles and miles in the broiling
    scrubs &ldquo;as bare as your hand,&rdquo; or covered with coarse, dry tufts.
    There was feed grass in places, but you had to look close to see it.</p>
  <p>Shearing had finished the day before, but there was a black boy and a station-hand
    or two about the yards and six or eight shearers and rouseabouts, and a teamster
    camped in the men&rsquo;s huts&mdash;they were staying over the holidays
    to shear stragglers and clean up generally. Old Peter and a jackeroo were
    out on the run watching a bush-fire across Sandy Creek.</p>
  <p>A swagman had happened to call at the station that morning; he asked for
    work and then for tucker. He irritated Wall, who told him to clear out. It
    was the first time that a swagman had been turned away from the station without
    tucker.</p>
  <p>Swaggy went along the track some miles, brooding over his wrongs, and crossed
    Sandy Creek. He struck a match and dropped it into a convenient tuft of grass
    in a likely patch of tufts, with dead grass running from it up into the scrubby
    ridges&mdash;then he hurried on.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Did you ever see a bush-fire? Not sheets of flame sweeping and roaring from
    tree-top to tree-top, but the snaky, hissing grassfire of hardwood country.</p>
  <p>The whole country covered with thin blue smoke so that you never know in
    what direction the fire is travelling. At night you see it like the lighted
    streets of cities, in the distant ranges. It roars up the hollows of dead
    trees and gives them the appearance of factory chimneys in the dusk. It climbs,
    by shreds of bark, the trunks of old dead white-box and blue-gums&mdash;solid
    and hard as cast-iron&mdash;and cuts off the limbs. And where there&rsquo;s
    a piece of recently ringbarked country, with the dead leaves still on the
    trees, the fire will roar from bough to bough&mdash;a fair imitation of a
    softwood forest fire. The bush-fire travels through the scrubs for hundreds
    of miles, taking the grass to the roots, scorching the living bush but leaving
    it alive&mdash;for gumbush is hardest of any to kill. Where there is no undergrowth,
    and the country seems bare as a road for miles, the fire will cross, licking
    up invisible straws of grass, dusty leaves, twigs and shreds of bark on the
    hard ground already baking in the drought. You hear of a fire miles away,
    and next day, riding across the head of a gully, you hear a hissing and crackling
    and there is the fire running over the ground in lines and curves of thin
    blue smoke, snakelike, with old logs blazing on the blackened ground behind.
    Did you ever&nbsp;<i>hear</i>&nbsp;a fire where a fire should not be? There
    is something hellish in the sound of it. When the breeze is, say, from the
    east the fire runs round western spurs, up sheltered gullies&mdash;helped
    by an &ldquo;eddy&rdquo; in the wind perhaps&mdash;and appears along the
    top of the ridge, ready, with a change in the wind, to come down on farms
    and fields of ripe wheat, with a &ldquo;front&rdquo; miles long.</p>
  <p>A selector might be protected by a wide sandy creek in front and wide cleared
    roads behind, and, any hour in the day or night, a shout from the farther
    end of the wheat paddock, and&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, my God! the wheat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wall didn&rsquo;t mind this fire much; most of his sheep were on their way
    out back, to a back run where there was young grass; and the dry ridges along
    the creek would be better for a burning-off&mdash;only he had to watch his
    fences.</p>
  <p>But, about dusk, Mary came galloping home in her usual breackneck fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;turn out the men and send them at
    once. The fire is all down by Ross&rsquo;s farm, and he has ten acres of
    wheat standing, and no one at home but him and Bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; growled Wall. Then suddenly and suspiciously,  &ldquo;Have
    you been there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came home that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;let Ross look after his own,&rdquo; snarled the father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t, father. They&rsquo;re fighting the fire now,
    and they&rsquo;ll be burnt out before the morning if they don&rsquo;t get
    help&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake, father, act like a Christian and send the
    men. Remember it is Christmas-time, father. You&rsquo;re surely not going
    to see a neighbour burnt out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; shouted Wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see every
    selector in the country burnt out, hut and all! Get off that horse and go
    inside. If a man leaves the station to-night he needn&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo; (This
    last for the benefit of the men&rsquo;s hut.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get off that horse and go inside,&rdquo; roared Wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; He darted forward as though to drag her from the saddle,
    but she swung her horse away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop! Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To help Ross,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;He had no one to send for
    help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then go the same way as your brother!&rdquo; roared her father; &ldquo;and
    if you show your nose back again I&rsquo;ll horse-whip you off the run!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, father,&rdquo; said Mary, and she was away.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>IV<br>
    The Fire At Ross&rsquo;s Farm</b></h3>
  <p>Ross&rsquo;s farm was in a corner between the ridges and the creek. The
    fire had come down from the creek, but the siding on that side was fairly
    clear, and they had stopped the fire there. It went behind the ridge and
    ran up and over. The ridge was covered thickly with scrub and dead grass;
    the wheat-field went well up the siding, and along the top was a bush face
    with only a narrow bridle-track between it and the long dead grass. Everything
    depended on the wind. Mary saw Ross and Mrs Ross and the daughter Jenny,
    well up the siding above the fence, working desperately, running to and fro,
    and beating out the fire with green boughs. Mary left her horse, ran into
    the hut, and looked hurriedly round for something to wear in place of her
    riding-skirt. She only saw a couple of light print dresses. She stepped into
    a skillion room, which happened to be Bob&rsquo;s room, and there caught
    sight of a pair of trousers and a coat hanging on the wall.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Bob Ross, beating desperately along a line of fire that curved down-hill
    to his right, and half-choked and blinded with the smoke, almost stumbled
    against a figure which was too tall to be his father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me, Bob,&rdquo; said Mary, and she lifted her bough
    again.</p>
  <p>Bob stared. He was so astonished that he almost forgot the fire and the
    wheat. Bob was not thin&mdash;but&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me, Bob!&rdquo; said Mary, hurriedly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
    going to be married, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Let us save the wheat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no time to waste; there was a breeze now from over the ridges,
    light, but enough to bear the fire down on them. Once, when they had breathing
    space, Mary ran to the creek for a billy of water. They beat out the fire
    all along the siding to where a rib of granite came down over the ridge to
    the fence, and then they thought the wheat was safe. They came together here,
    and Ross had time to look and see who the strange man was; then he stared
    at Mary from under his black, bushy eyebrows. Mary, choking and getting her
    breath after her exertions, suddenly became aware, said &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and
    fled round the track beyond the point of granite. She felt a gust of wind
    and looked up the ridge. The bush fence ended here in a corner, where it
    was met by a new wire fence running up from the creek. It was a blind gully
    full of tall dead grass, and, glancing up, Mary saw the flames coming down
    fast. She ran back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;come on! The fire&rsquo;s the other
    side of the rocks!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Back at the station, Wall walked up and down till he cooled. He went inside
    and sat down, but it was no use. He lifted his head and saw his dead wife&rsquo;s
    portrait on the wall. Perhaps his whole life ran before him in detail&mdash;but
    this is not a psychological study.</p>
  <p>There were only two tracks open to him now: either to give in, or go on
    as he was going&mdash;to shut himself out from human nature and become known
    as  &ldquo;Mean Wall,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hungry Wall,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mad Wall,
    the Squatter.&rdquo; He was a tall, dark man of strong imagination and more
    than ordinary intelligence. And it was the great crisis of his ruined life.
    He walked to the top of a knoll near the homestead and saw the fire on the
    ridges above Ross&rsquo;s farm. As he turned back he saw a horseman ride
    up and dismount by the yard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that you, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, boss. The fences is all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Been near Ross&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s burnt out by this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wall walked to and fro for a few minutes longer. Then he suddenly stopped
    and called, &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; from the direction of the huts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Turn out the men!&rdquo; and Wall went into a shed and came out with
    his saddle on his arm.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The fire rushed down the blind gully. Showers of sparks fell on the bush
    fence, it caught twice, and they put it out, but the third time it blazed
    and roared and a fire-engine could not have stopped it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wheat must go,&rdquo; said Ross. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done our
    best,&rdquo; and he threw down the blackened bough and leaned against a tree,
    and covered his eyes with a grimy hand.</p>
  <p>The wheat was patchy in that corner&mdash;there were many old stumps of
    trees, and there were bare strips where the plough had gone on each side
    of them. Mary saw a chance, and climbed the fence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Bob,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;we might save it yet. Mr Ross,
    pull out the fence along there,&rdquo; and she indicated a point beyond the
    fire. They tramped down and tore up the wheat where it ran between the stumps&mdash;the
    fire was hissing and crackling round and through it, and just as it ran past
    them in one place there was a shout, a clatter of horses&rsquo; hoofs on
    the stones, and Mary saw her father riding up the track with a dozen men
    behind him. She gave a shriek and ran straight down, through the middle of
    the wheat, towards the hut.</p>
  <p>Wall and his men jumped to the ground, wrenched green boughs from the saplings,
    and, after twenty minutes&rsquo; hard fighting, the crop was saved&mdash;save
    for a patchy acre or so.</p>
  <p>When it was all over Ross sat down on a log and rested his head on his hands,
    and his shoulders shook.</p>
  <p>Presently he felt a hand on his shoulder, looked up, and saw Wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shake hands, Ross,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>And it was Christmas Day.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>But in after years they used to nearly chaff the life out of Mary.  &ldquo;You
    were in a great hurry to put on the breeches, weren&rsquo;t you, Mary?&rdquo; &ldquo;Bob&rsquo;s
    best Sunday-go-meetin&rsquo;s, too, wasn&rsquo;t they, Mary?&rdquo; &ldquo;Rather
    tight fit, wasn&rsquo;t they, Mary?&rdquo; &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em
    on now, could you, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; reflected old Peter apart to some cronies, &ldquo;it
    ain&rsquo;t every young chap as gits an idea of the shape of his wife afore
    he marries her&mdash;is it? An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s sayin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And old Peter was set down as being an innercent sort of ole cove.</p>

  <p>Do you think, where, in place of bare fences, dry creeks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear streams and green hedges are seen&mdash;<br>
    Where the girls have the lily and rose in their cheeks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grass in mid-summer is green&mdash;<br>
    Do you think, now and then, now or then, in the whirl<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the town life, while London is new,<br>
    Of the hut in the Bush and the freckled-faced girl<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who waits by the slip-rails for you?</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheHousethatwasNeverBuilt"></a>The House that was Never Built</b></h2>
  <p>There&nbsp;had been heavy rain and landslips all along the branch railway
    which left the Great Western Line from Sydney just beyond the Blue Mountains,
    and ran through thick bush and scrubby ridgy country and along great alluvial
    sidings&mdash;where the hills on the opposite side of the wide valleys (misty
    in depths) faded from deep blue into the pale azure of the sky&mdash;and
    over the ends of western spurs to the little farming, mining and pastoral
    town of Solong, situated in a circle of blue hills on the banks of the willow-fringed
    Cudgegong River.</p>
  <p>The line was hopelessly blocked, and some publicans at Solong had put on
    the old coach-road a couple of buggies, a wagonette, and an old mail coach&mdash;relic
    of the days of Cobb &amp; Co., which had been resurrected from some backyard
    and tinkered up&mdash;to bring the train passengers on from the first break
    in the line over the remaining distance of forty miles or so. Capertee Station
    (old time, &ldquo;Capertee Camp&rdquo;&mdash;a teamster&rsquo;s camp) was
    the last station before the first washout, and there the railway line and
    the old road parted company for the last time before reaching Solong&mdash;the
    one to run round by the ends of the western spurs that spread fanlike, and
    the other to go through and over the rough country.</p>
  <p>The train reached Capertee about midnight in broad moonlight that was misty
    in the valleys and round the blue of Crown Ridge. I got a &ldquo;box-seat&rdquo;  beside
    the driver on the old coach. It was a grand old road&mdash;one of the old
    main coach-roads of New South Wales&mdash;broad and white, metalled nearly
    all the way, and in nearly as good condition as on the day when the first
    passenger train ran into Solong and the last-used section of the old road
    was abandoned. It dated back to the bushranging days&mdash;right back to
    convict times: it ran through tall dark bush, up over gaps or &ldquo;saddles&rdquo; in
    high ridges, down across deep dark gullies, and here and there across grey,
    marshy, curlew-haunted flats. Cobb  &amp; Co&rsquo;s coach-and-six, with &ldquo;Royal
    Mail&rdquo; gilded on the panels, had dashed over it in ten and twelve-mile
    stages in the old days, the three head-lamps flashing on the wild dark bush
    at night, and maybe twenty-four passengers on board. The biggest rushes to
    richest goldfields in the west had gone over this old road on coaches, on
    carts, on drays, on horse and bullock wagons, on horseback, and on foot;
    new chums from all the world and from all stations in life.</p>
  <p class="note">When many a step was on the mountains,<br>
Marching west to the land of gold.</p>
  <p>And a few came back rich&mdash;red, round-faced and jolly&mdash;on the box-seat
    of Cobb &amp; Co&rsquo;s, treating the driver and all hands, &ldquo;going
    home&rdquo; to sweethearts or families. (Home people will never feel the
    meaning of those two words, &ldquo;going home,&rdquo; as it is felt in a
    new land.) And many came back broken men, tramping in rags, and carrying
    their swags through the dusty heat of the drought in December or the bitter,
    pelting rain in the mountains in June. Some came back grey who went as boys;
    and there were many who never came back.</p>
  <p>I remembered the old mile-trees, with a section of bark cut away and the
    distances cut in Roman letters in the hardened sap&mdash;the distance from
    Bowenfels, the railway terminus then. It was a ghostly old road, and if it
    wasn&rsquo;t haunted it should have been. There was an old decaying and nearly
    deserted coaching town or two; there were abandoned farms and halfway inns,
    built of stone, with the roofs gone and nettles growing high between the
    walls; the remains of an orchard here and there&mdash;a few gnarled quince-trees&mdash;and
    the bush reclaiming its own again. It was a haunted ride for me, because
    I had last ridden over this old road long ago when I was young&mdash;going
    to see the city for the first time&mdash;and because I was now on my way
    to attend the funeral of one of my father&rsquo;s blood from whom I had parted
    in anger.</p>
  <p>We slowly climbed, and almost as slowly descended, the steep siding of a
    great hill called Aaron&rsquo;s Pass, and about a mile beyond the foot of
    the hill I saw a spot I remembered passing on the last journey down, long
    ago. Rising back from the road, and walled by heavy bush, was a square clearing,
    and in the background I saw plainly, by the broad moonlight, the stone foundations
    for a large house; from the front an avenue of grown pines came down to the
    road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; I exclaimed, turning to the driver, &ldquo;was that house
    burnt down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;That house was never built.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I stared at the place again and caught sight of a ghostly-looking light
    between the lines of the foundations, which I presently made out to be a
    light in a tent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone camping there,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the driver, &ldquo;some old swaggy or &lsquo;hatter.&rsquo; I
    seen him comin&rsquo; down. I don&rsquo;t know nothing about that there place.&rdquo; (I
    hadn&rsquo;t &ldquo;shouted&rdquo;  for him yet.)</p>
  <p>I thought and remembered. I remembered myself, as a boy, being sent a coach
    journey along this road to visit some relatives in Sydney. We passed this
    place, and the women in the coach began to talk of the fine house that was
    going to be built there. The ground was being levelled for the foundations,
    and young pines had been planted, with stakes round them to protect them
    from the cattle. I remembered being mightily interested in the place, for
    the women said that the house was to be a two-storied one. I thought it would
    be a wonderful thing to see a two-storied house there in the bush. The height
    of my ambition was to live in a house with stairs in it. The women said that
    this house was being built for young Brassington, the son of the biggest
    squatter then in the district, who was going to marry the daughter of the
    next biggest squatter. That was all I remember hearing the women say.</p>
  <p>Three or four miles along the road was a public-house, with a post office,
    general store, and blacksmith shop attached, as is usual in such places&mdash;all
    that was left of the old pastoral and coaching town of Ilford. I  &ldquo;shouted&rdquo; for
    the driver at the shanty, but got nothing further out of him concerning the
    fate of the house that was never built. I wanted that house for a story.</p>
  <p>However, while yarning with some old residents at Solong, I mentioned the
    Brassingtons, and picked up a few first links in the story. The young couple
    were married and went to Sydney for their honeymoon. The story went that
    they intended to take a trip to the old country and Paris, to be away a twelve-month,
    and the house was to be finished and ready for them on their return. Young
    Brassington himself had a big sheep-run round there. The railway wasn&rsquo;t
    thought of in those days, or if it was, no Brassington could have dreamed
    that the line could have been brought to Solong in any other direction than
    through the property of the &ldquo;Big Brassingtons,&rdquo; as they were
    called. Well, the young couple went to Sydney, but whether they went farther
    the old residents did not know. All they knew was that within a few weeks,
    and before the stone foundations for the brick walls of the house were completed,
    the building contract was cancelled, the workmen were dismissed, and the
    place was left as I last saw it; only the ornamental pines had now grown
    to trees. The Brassingtons and the bride&rsquo;s people were English families
    and reserved. They kept the story, if there was a story, to themselves. The
    girl&rsquo;s people left the district and squatted on new stations up-country.
    The Big Brassingtons came down in the world and drifted to the city, as many
    smaller people do, more and more every year. Neither young Brassington nor
    his wife was ever again seen or heard of in the district.</p>
  <p>I attended my relative&rsquo;s funeral, and next day started back for Sydney.</p>
  <p>Just as we reached Ilford, as it happened, the pin of the fore under-carriage
    of the coach broke, and it took the blacksmith several hours to set it right.
    The place was dull, the publican was not communicative&mdash;or else he harped
    on the old local grievance of the railway not having come that way&mdash;so
    about half an hour before I thought the coach would be ready, I walked on
    along the road to stretch by legs. I walked on and on until I came, almost
    unaware, to the site of the house that was never built. The tent was still
    there, in fact, it was a permanent camp, and I was rather surprised to see
    the man working with a trowel on a corner of the unfinished foundations of
    the house. At first I thought he was going to build a stone hut in the corner,
    but when I got close to him I saw that he was working carefully on the original
    plan of the building: he was building the unfinished parts of the foundation
    walls up to the required height. He had bricklayer&rsquo;s tools, a bag of
    lime, and a heap of sand, and had worked up a considerable quantity of mortar.
    It was a rubble foundation: he was knocking off the thin end of a piece of
    stone to make it fit, and the clanging of the trowel prevented his hearing
    my footsteps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day, mate,&rdquo; I said, close beside him.</p>
  <p>I half expected he&rsquo;d start when I spoke, but he didn&rsquo;t: he looked
    round slowly, but with a haunted look in his eyes as if I might have been
    one of his ghosts. He was a tall man, gaunt and haggard-eyed, as many men
    are in the bush; he may have been but little past middle age, and grey before
    his time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; he said, and he set the stone in its place, carefully
    flush with the outer edge of the wall, before he spoke again. Then he looked
    at the sun, which was low, laid down his trowel, and asked me to come to
    the tent-fire. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s turning chilly,&rdquo; he said. It was a
    model camp, everything clean and neat both inside the tent and out; he had
    made a stone fireplace with a bark shelter over it, and a table and bench
    under another little shed, with shelves for his tin cups and plates and cooking
    utensils. He put a box in front of the fire and folded a flour-bag on top
    of it for a seat for me, and hung the billy over the fire. He sat on his
    heels and poked the burning sticks, abstractedly I thought, or to keep his
    hands and thoughts steady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re doing a bit of building,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, keeping his eyes on the fire; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    getting on with it slowly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t suppose he looked at me half a dozen times the whole while
    I was is his camp. When he spoke he talked just as if he were sitting yarning
    in a row of half a dozen of us. Presently he said suddenly, and giving the
    fire a vicious dig with his poker:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That house must be finished by Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked, taken by surprise. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be married in
    the New Year&mdash;to the best and dearest girl in the bush.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was an awkward pause on my part, but presently I pulled myself together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never finish it by yourself,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why
    don&rsquo;t you put on some men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t trust them. Besides,
    how am I to get bricklayers and carpenters in a place like this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I noticed all through that his madness or the past in his mind was mixed
    up with the real and the present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you postpone the marriage?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he exclaimed, starting to his feet. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and
    he looked round wildly on the darkening bush. There was madness in his tone
    that time, the last &ldquo;No!&rdquo; sounding as if from a man who was begging
    for his life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you run up a shanty then, to live in until the house
    is ready?&rdquo; I suggested, to soothe him.</p>
  <p>He gave his arm an impatient swing. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d ask that
    girl to live in a hut?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She ought to live in a palace!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There seemed no way out of it, so I said nothing: he turned his back and
    stood looking away over the dark, low-lying sweep of bush towards sunset.
    He folded his arms tight, and seemed to me to be holding himself. After a
    while he let fall his arms and turned and blinked at me and the fire like
    a man just woke from a doze or rousing himself out of a deep reverie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I almost forgot the billy!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    make some tea&mdash;you must be hungry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made the tea and fried a couple of slices of ham; he laid the biggest
    slice on a thick slice of white baker&rsquo;s bread on a tin plate, and put
    it and a pint-pot full of tea on a box by my side. &ldquo;Have it here, by
    the fire,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s warmer and more comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I took the plate on my knee, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed that meal.
    The bracing mountain air and the walk had made me hungry. The hatter had
    his meal standing up, cutting his ham on a slice of bread with a clasp-knife.
    It was bush fashion, and set me thinking of some old times. He ate very little,
    and, as far as I saw, he didn&rsquo;t smoke. Non-smokers are very scarce
    in the bush.</p>
  <p>I saw by the way his tent was pitched and his camp arranged generally, and
    by the way he managed the cooking, that he must have knocked about the bush
    for some years.</p>
  <p>He put the plates and things away and came and sat down on the other empty
    gin-case by my side, and fell to poking the fire again. He never showed the
    least curiosity as to who I was, or where I came from, or what I was doing
    on this deserted track: he seemed to take me as a matter of course&mdash;but
    all this was in keeping with bush life in general.</p>
  <p>Presently he got up and stood looking upwards over the place where the house
    should have been.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think now,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I made a mistake in not
    having the verandas carried all round the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg pardon!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should have had the balcony all round instead of on two sides only,
    as the man who made the plan suggested; it would have looked better and made
    the house cooler in summer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I thought as I listened, and presently I saw that it was a case of madness
    within madness, so to speak: he was mad on the idea that he could build the
    house himself, and then he had moods when he imagined that the house had
    been built and he had been married and had reared a family.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You could easily get the balcony carried round,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;it
    wouldn&rsquo;t cost much&mdash;you can get good carpenters at Solong. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it done after Christmas.&rdquo; Then
    he turned from the house and blinked down at me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s no one at home.
    I sent the wife and family to Sydney for a change. I&rsquo;ve got the two
    boys at the Sydney Grammar School. I think I&rsquo;ll send the eldest to
    King&rsquo;s School at Parramatta. The girls will have to get along with
    a governess at home and learn to help their mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And so he went on talking away just as a man who has made money in the bush,
    and is married and settled down, might yarn to an old bachelor bush mate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to get a good piano,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;The
    girls must have some amusement: there&rsquo;ll be no end of balls and parties.
    I suppose the boys will soon be talking of getting &lsquo;fivers&rsquo; and &lsquo;tenners&rsquo; out
    of the  &lsquo;guvner&rsquo; or &lsquo;old man.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the way
    of the world. And they&rsquo;ll marry and leave us. It&rsquo;s the way of
    the world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was awful to hear him go on like this, the more so because he never smiled&mdash;just
    talked on as if he had said the same thing over and over again. Presently
    he stopped, and his eyes and hands began to wander: he sat down on his heel
    to the fire again and started poking it. I began to feel uneasy; I didn&rsquo;t
    know what other sides there might be to his madness, and wished the coach
    would come along.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve knocked about the bush a good deal?&rdquo; I asked.
    I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything else to say, and I thought he might break
    loose if I let him brood too long.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Been in Queensland and the Gulf country, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His tone and manner seemed a bit more natural. He had knocked about pretty
    well all over Australia, and had been in many places where I had been. I
    had got him on the right track, and after a bit he started telling bush yarns
    and experiences, some of them awful, some of them very funny, and all of
    them short and good; and now and then, looking at the side of his face, which
    was all he turned to me, I thought I detected the ghost of a smile.</p>
  <p>One thing I noticed about him; when he spoke as a madman, he talked like
    a man who had been fairly well educated (or sometimes, I fancied, like a
    young fellow who was studying to be a school-teacher); his speech was deliberate
    and his grammar painfully correct&mdash;far more so than I have made it;
    but when he spoke as an old bushman, he dropped his&nbsp;<i>g&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;and
    often turned his grammar back to front. But that reminds me that I have met
    English college men who did the same thing after being a few years in the
    bush; either they dropped their particular way of speaking because it was
    mimicked, because they were laughed and chaffed out of it, or they fell gradually
    into the habit of talking as rough bushmen do (they learnt Australian), as
    clean-mouthed men fall, in spite of themselves, into the habit of swearing
    in the heat and hurry and rough life of a shearing-shed. And, coming back
    into civilized life, these men, who had been well brought up, drop into their
    old manner and style of speaking as readily as the foulest-mouthed man in
    a shed or camp&mdash;who, amongst his fellows, cannot say three words without
    an oath&mdash;can, when he finds himself in a decent home in the woman-and-girl
    world, yarn by the hour without letting slip a solitary little damn.</p>
  <p>The hatter warmed up the tea-billy again, got out some currant buns, which
    he had baked himself in the camp-oven, and we were yarning comfortably like
    two old bushmen, and I had almost forgotten that he was  &ldquo;ratty,&rdquo; when
    we heard the coach coming. I jumped up to hurry down to the road. This seemed
    to shake him up. He gripped my hand hard and glanced round in his frightened,
    haunted way. I never saw the eyes of a man look so hopeless and helpless
    as his did just then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; he said, in a hurried
    way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re going. But&mdash;but they all go.
    Come again, come again&mdash;we&rsquo;ll all be glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I had to hurry off and leave him. &ldquo;We all,&rdquo; I suppose, meant
    himself and his ghosts.</p>
  <p>I ran down between the two rows of pines and reached the road just as the
    coach came up. I found the publican from Ilford aboard&mdash;he was taking
    a trip to Sydney. As the coach went on I looked up the clearing and saw the
    hatter standing straight behind the fire, with his arms folded and his face
    turned in our direction. He looked ghastly in the firelight, and at that
    distance his face seemed to have an expression of listening blindness. I
    looked round on the dark bush, with, away to the left, the last glow of sunset
    fading from the bed of it, like a bed of reddening coals, and I looked up
    at the black loom of Aaron&rsquo;s Pass, and thought that never a man, sane
    or mad, was left in such a depth of gloomy loneliness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve been yarning with him yonder,&rdquo; said the
    publican, who seemed to have relaxed wonderfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know these parts, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I was about here as a boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He asked me what my name might be. I told him it was Smith. He blinked a
    while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never heard of anyone by the name of Smith in the district,&rdquo; he
    said.</p>
  <p>Neither had I. I told him that we lived at Solong, and didn&rsquo;t stay
    long. It saved time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ever heard of the Big Brassingtons?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ever heard the yarn of the house that wasn&rsquo;t built?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I told him how much I had heard of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s about all any on &rsquo;em knows. Have you any idea
    who that man back yonder is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, who do you think it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is, or rather he was, young Brassington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it!&rdquo; said the publican. &ldquo;I know&mdash;and
    a few others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do you know what became of his wife?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the shanty-keeper, who had a generous supply of
    whisky with him, and seemed to have begun to fill himself up for the trip.</p>
  <p>He said no more for a while, and when I had remained silent long enough,
    he went on, very deliberately and impressively</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One yarn is that the girl wasn&rsquo;t any good; that when she was
    married to Brassington, and as soon as they got to Sydney, she met a chap
    she&rsquo;d been carrying on with before she married Brassington (or that
    she&rsquo;d been married to in secret), an&rsquo; she cleared off with him,
    leaving her fortnight-old husband. That was one yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was it?&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the publican. &ldquo;That yarn was a lie.&rdquo; He
    opened a flask of whisky and passed it round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was madness in the family,&rdquo; he said, after a nip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Brassington&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the publican, in a tone that implied contempt at
    my ignorance, in spite of its innocence, &ldquo;the girl&rsquo;s. Her mother
    had been in a  &rsquo;sylum, and so had her grandmother. It was&mdash;it
    was heridited. Some madnesses is heridited, an&rsquo; some comes through
    worry and hard graft (that&rsquo;s mine), an&rsquo; some comes through drink,
    and some through worse, and, but as far as I&rsquo;ve heard, all madnesses
    is pretty much the same. My old man was a warder in a &rsquo;sylum. They
    have their madnesses a bit different, the same as boozers has their d.t&rsquo;s
    different; but, takin&rsquo; it by the lump, it&rsquo;s pretty much all the
    same. The difference is accordin&rsquo; to their natures when they&rsquo;re
    sane. All men are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But about young Mrs Brassington,&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young Mrs Brassington? Rosy Webb she was, daughter of Webb the squatter.
    Rosy was the brightest, best, good-heartedest, an&rsquo; most ladylike little
    girl in the district, an&rsquo; the heriditry business come on her in Sydney,
    about a week after she was married to young Brassington. She was only twenty.
    Here&mdash;&rdquo; He passed the flask round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what happened?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he repeated. Then he pulled himself together,
    as if conscious that he had shown signs of whisky. &ldquo;Everything was
    done, but it was no use. She died in a year in a &rsquo;sylum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do I know that?&rdquo; he repeated in a tone of contempt. &ldquo;How
    do I know that? Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you how. My old wife was in service
    at Brassington&rsquo;s station at the time&mdash;the oldest servant&mdash;an&rsquo; young
    Brassington wired to her from Sydney to come and help him in his trouble.
    Old Mrs Brassington was bedridden, an&rsquo; they kep&rsquo; it from her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And about young Brassington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About young Brassington? He took a swag an&rsquo; wandered through
    the bush. We&rsquo;ve had him at our place several times all these years,
    but he always wandered off again. My old woman tried everything with him,
    but it was all no use. Years ago she used to get him to talk of things as
    they was, in hopes of bringin&rsquo; his mind back, but he was always worse
    after. She does all she can for him even now, but he&rsquo;s mighty independent.
    The last five or six years he&rsquo;s been taken with the idea of buildin&rsquo; that
    cursed house. He&rsquo;ll stay there till he gets short of money, an&rsquo; then
    he&rsquo;ll go out back, shearin&rsquo;, stock-ridin&rsquo;, drovin&rsquo;,
    cookin&rsquo;, fencin&rsquo;&mdash;anything till he gets a few pounds. Then
    he&rsquo;ll settle down and build away at that bloody house. He&rsquo;s knocked
    about so much that he&rsquo;s a regular old bushman. While he&rsquo;s an
    old bushman he&rsquo;s all right an&rsquo; amusin&rsquo; an&rsquo;  good
    company; but when he&rsquo;s Brassington he&rsquo;s mad&mdash;Don&rsquo;t
    you ever let on to my old woman that I told you. I allers let my tongue run
    a bit when I get out of that hole we&rsquo;re living in. We&rsquo;ve kept
    the secret all these years, but what does it matter now?&mdash;I ask you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter much,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing matters much, it seems to me, nothing matters a damn. The
    Big Brassingtons come down years ago; the old people&rsquo;s gone, and the
    young scattered God knows where or how. The Webbs (the girl&rsquo;s people)
    are away up in new country, an&rsquo; the girls (they was mostly all girls)
    are married an&rsquo; settled down by this time. We kept the secret, an&rsquo; the
    Webbs kept the secret&mdash;even when the dirty yarns was goin&rsquo; round&mdash;so&rsquo;s
    not to spoil the chances of the other girls. What about the chances of their
    husbands? Some on &rsquo;em might be in the same hell as Brassington for
    all I know. The Brassingtons kept the secret because I suppose they reckoned
    it didn&rsquo;t matter much. Nothing matters much in this world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But I was thinking of another young couple who had married long ago, whose
    married life was twenty long years of shameful quarrels, of useless brutal
    recrimination&mdash;not because either was bad, but because their natures
    were too much alike; of the house that was built, of the family that was
    reared, of the sons and daughters who &ldquo;went wrong,&rdquo; of the father
    and mother separated after twenty years, of the mother dead of a broken heart,
    of the father (in a lunatic asylum), whose mania was not to build houses,
    but to obtain and secrete matches for the purpose of burning houses down.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BarneyTakeMeHomeAgain"></a>&ldquo;Barney, Take Me Home Again&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>This&nbsp;is a sketch of one of the many ways in which a young married woman,
    who is naturally thick-skinned and selfish&mdash;as most women are&mdash;and
    who thinks she loves her husband, can spoil his life because he happens to
    be good-natured, generous, sensitive, weak or soft, whichever you like to
    call it.</p>
  <p>Johnson went out to Australia a good many years ago with his young wife
    and two children, as assisted emigrants. He should have left his wife and
    children with her mother, in a street off City Road, N., and gone out by
    himself and got settled down comfortably and strengthened in the glorious
    climate and democratic atmosphere of Australia, and in the knowledge that
    he could worry along a while without his wife, before sending for her. That
    bit of knowledge would have done her good also, and it would have been better
    for both of them. But no man knows the future, and few can prescribe for
    their own wives. If we saw our married lives as others see them, half of
    us would get divorced. But Johnson was sentimental, he could not bear to
    part from his wife for a little while. Moreover, man is instinctively against
    leaving his wife behind; it may be either a natural or a cowardly instinct&mdash;but
    we won&rsquo;t argue that. I don&rsquo;t believe that Johnson was a coward
    in that direction; I believe that he trusted his wife implicitly, or rather
    that he never dreamed of such a thing&mdash;as is the way with most married
    men. Sentiment is selfishness, perhaps, but we won&rsquo;t argue that, such
    arguments come to nothing.</p>
  <p>I heard from a fellow-passenger of Johnson&rsquo;s that he had &ldquo;a
    hell of a voyage&rdquo; because of his young wife&rsquo;s ignorant selfishness
    and his own sensitiveness; he bribed stewards for better food and accommodation
    for his wife and children, paid the stewardess to help with the children,
    got neither rest, nor peace, nor thanks for himself, and landed in Sydney
    a nervous wreck, with five pounds out of the ten he started with.</p>
  <p>Johnson was a carpenter. He got work from a firm of contractors in Sydney,
    who, after giving him a fortnight&rsquo;s trial, sent him up-country to work
    on the railway station buildings, at the little pastoral mining and farming
    town of Solong. The railway having come to Solong, things were busy in the
    building line, and Johnson settled there.</p>
  <p>Johnson was thin when he came to Solong; he had landed a living skeleton,
    he said, but he filled out later on. The democratic atmosphere soothed his
    mind and he soon loved the place for its unconventional hospitality. He worked
    hard and seemed to have plenty of energy&mdash;he said he got it in Australia.
    He said that another year of the struggle in London would have driven him
    mad. He fished in the river on Saturday afternoons and Sundays, and, perhaps
    for the first month or so, he thought that he had found peace. Johnson&rsquo;s
    wife was a rather stout, unsympathetic-looking young woman, with the knit
    of obstinacy in her forehead; she had that stamp of &ldquo;hardness&rdquo; on
    her face which is the rule amongst English and the exception amongst Australian
    women. We of Solong thought her hard, selfish and narrow-minded, and paltry;
    later on we thought she was a &ldquo;bit touched;&rdquo; but local people
    often think that of strangers.</p>
  <p>By her voice and her habit of whining she should have been a thin, sharp-faced,
    untidy, draggled-tailed woman in a back street in London, or a worn-out selector&rsquo;s
    wife in the bush. She whined about the climate. &ldquo;It will kill the children!
    It will kill the children! We&rsquo;ll never rear them here!&rdquo; She whined
    about the &ldquo;wretched hole in the bush&rdquo; that her husband had brought
    her to; and to the women whom she condescended to visit&mdash;because a woman
    must have a woman to talk to&mdash;she exaggerated the miseries of the voyage
    until the thing became a sing-song from repetition. Later on she settled
    down to endless accounts of her home in London, of her mother and sisters,
    of the way they lived. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll never see it any more. I&rsquo;ll
    never see them any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Solong climate was reckoned the best in Australia; the  &ldquo;wretched
    hole&rdquo; was a pretty little town on the banks of a clear, willow-bordered
    river, with vineyards on the slopes, and surrounded by a circle of blue hills
    and peaks. We knew nothing of London, so she had her own way there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll feel a bit lonely at first, but she&rsquo;ll soon get
    used to Australia,&rdquo; said Johnson. He seemed to me to go out of his
    way to excuse his wife.</p>
  <p>Johnson had had a few contracts in England at one time; they had been in &ldquo;better
    circumstances&rdquo;&mdash;that was the time she looked back to in England;
    the last two years of bitter, black struggle at &ldquo;home&rdquo; seemed
    a blank in her mind&mdash;but that&rsquo;s how women jump over facts when
    they have a selfish fad.</p>
  <p>Johnson rented a cottage and garden on the bank of the sunny river. He said
    he took the place because there was ivy growing on the cottage, and it might
    cheer his wife; but he had lost sight of the fact that, while he had been
    born in an English village, his wife had been born and bred in London, and
    had probably never noticed ivy. She said it was worse than living in a slum.</p>
  <p>Johnson was clever at his trade, and at many other things, but his wife
    didn&rsquo;t seem aware of it. He was well liked, he grew to be popular,
    but she didn&rsquo;t seem proud of the fact; she never seemed interested
    in him or his prospects. She only wanted him to take her home again. We mustn&rsquo;t
    forget that while he had a rush of work to occupy his mind she had not.</p>
  <p>But Johnson grew stouter and prospered in spite of his wife&mdash;for a
    year or so. New schools were being built in the district and the town was
    practically re-built. Johnson took contracts for brickwork, plumbing and
    house-painting, as well as carpentering, and had at one time as many as ten
    men in his employ. He was making money.</p>
  <p>I was working at my trade then, house-painting, and worked for Johnson.
    I lodged at his cottage for a while, but soon got tired of hearing about
    London, and Mrs Johnson&rsquo;s mother and sisters, and the house they lived
    in, and the street it was in, and the parks where they used to take their
    babies, and the shopping on Saturday afternoon. That woman was terrible.
    She was at Johnson all the time about taking her home. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
    surely be able to go home this year, Will.&rdquo; &ldquo;You promised to
    take me home by the end of the year.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Mother says in her last
    letter that Jack says there&rsquo;s more building going on about London than
    ever.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do just as well in London as you&rsquo;ll
    do here.&rdquo;  &ldquo;What chance have the children got in a hole like
    this?&rdquo; And the rest of it&mdash;every night. When he took a new contract,
    it would be, &ldquo;What did you want to take that new contract for, Will,
    when we&rsquo;re going home? You know you promised me you wouldn&rsquo;t
    take any more contracts.&rdquo; First he&rsquo;d try to cheer her, then he&rsquo;d
    argue; but she&rsquo;d only sit with the knit in her forehead deep, looking
    as obstinate as a mule. Then she&rsquo;d sit down to a little harmonium he&rsquo;d
    bought her and play and sing &ldquo;Barney, take me Home again,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
    Old Folks at Home,&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Swannie Ribber,&rdquo; till I felt
    like hanging myself&mdash;and&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t an exile. Sometimes
    Johnson would flare up and there&rsquo;d be a row and he&rsquo;d go to the
    pub. Gentle persuasion, argument, or swearing, it was all the same with her.</p>
  <p>Bosses and men were different towards each other in Solong to what they
    are in London; besides, when I wasn&rsquo;t Johnson&rsquo;s sub-contractor
    I was his foreman&mdash;so we often had a few drinks together; and one night
    over a beer (and after a breeze at home, I think) he said to me:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out, Harry; there was nothing but struggle
    and worry and misery for us in England, and London was smothering me, my
    chest was bad and the wife was always in ill-health; but I suppose I&rsquo;ll
    have to take her home in the end or else she&rsquo;ll go melancholy mad!&rdquo; And
    he drew a breath that was more like a gasp than a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not send her home for a trip, or a year or so, boss?&rdquo; I
    asked. &ldquo;As likely as not she&rsquo;ll be just as eager to get back;
    and that will be the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do that, Harry,&rdquo; said Johnson. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
    stay here and work alone. It would be like beginning life again; I&rsquo;ve
    started twice and couldn&rsquo;t start the third time. You&rsquo;ll understand
    when you&rsquo;re married, Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well, in the end, she wore Johnson out&mdash;or wore into him rather. He
    drank more, and once or twice I saw him drinking alone. Sometimes he&rsquo;d &ldquo;round
    on us&rdquo; at work for nothing at all, and at other times he&rsquo;d take
    no interest in the jobs&mdash;he&rsquo;d let the work go on anyhow. Some
    thought that Johnson was getting too big for his boots, that&rsquo;s how
    men are misjudged. He grew moody and melancholy and thin again. Johnson was
    homesick himself. No doubt it was the misery of his domestic life in Australia
    that made him so.</p>
  <p>Towards the end of the third or fourth year Johnson threw up a couple of
    contracts he had on hand, sacrificed a piece of land which he had bought
    and on which he had built a cottage in the short time he had been in Solong,
    and, one lovely day in June, when the skies were their fairest, the hills
    their bluest, the river its widest and clearest, and the grass was waving
    waist high after rain&mdash;one blue and green and golden day the Johnsons
    left Solong, with the trunks they had brought out with them, for Sydney,&nbsp;<i>en
    route</i>&nbsp;for smoky London.</p>
  <p>Mrs Johnson was a woman transformed&mdash;she was happy and looked it. The
    last few weeks she had seemed in every way the opposite of the woman we had
    known: cheerful, kind to neighbours in sickness and trouble, even generous;
    she made many small presents in the way of mantelshelf ornaments, pictures,
    and house-linen. But then it was Johnson who had to pay for that in the end.</p>
  <p>He looked worn and worried at the railway station&mdash;more like himself
    as he was when he first came to Solong&mdash;and as the train moved off I
    thought he looked&mdash;well, frightened.</p>
  <p>That must have been nearly twenty years ago.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>London last winter. It was one of those days when London&rsquo;s lurid sun
    shows up for a little while like a smoky danger signal. The snow had melted
    from the house-tops and the streets were as London streets are after the
    first fall of snow of the season. But I could stand the flat no longer, I
    had to go out and walk. I was sun-sick&mdash;I was heart-sick for the sun,
    for the sunny South&mdash;for grassy plains, blue mountains, sweeps of mountain
    bush and sunny ocean beaches. I walked hard; I walked till I was mud-splashed
    to the shoulders; I walked through the squalid, maddening sameness of miles
    of dingy, grimy-walled blocks and rows of four-storied houses till I felt
    smothered&mdash;jailed, hopelessly. &ldquo;Best get home and in, and draw
    the blinds on it,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;or my brain will turn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I was about to ask a policeman where I was when I saw, by the name on a
    corner of the buildings, that I was in City Road, North.</p>
  <p>All the willow-fringed rivers and the sunny hills of Solong flashed before
    me at the sight of the name of that street. I had not been able to recall
    the name of the street off City Road in which the Johnsons lived, though
    I had heard it often enough in the old days from the tongue of Mrs Johnson.</p>
  <p>I felt it would be a relief to see anyone who had been in Australia. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I
    thought, &ldquo;if I walk along City Road and see the name of that street
    I&rsquo;ll remember it&rdquo;&mdash;and I did. It was a blind street, like
    the long, narrow yard of a jail, walled by dark houses, all alike. The next
    door but one to that at which I knocked to inquire was where the Johnsons
    lived; they lived in a four-storied house, or rather a narrow section of
    a four-storied terrace. I found later on that they paid the landlord, or
    nearly paid him, by letting lodgings. They lived in one room with the use
    of the parlour and the kitchen when the lodgers weren&rsquo;t using them,
    and the son shared a room with a lodger. The back windows looked out on the
    dead wall of a poorhouse of some kind, the front on rows of similar windows
    opposite&mdash;rows
    of the same sort of windows that run for miles and miles in London. In one
    a man sat smoking in his shirtsleeves, from another a slavey leaned out watching
    a fourwheeler that had stopped next door, in a third a woman sat sewing,
    and in a fourth a woman was ironing, with a glimpse of a bedstead behind
    her. And all outside was gloom and soot and slush.</p>
  <p>I would never have recognized the Johnsons. I have visited them several
    times since and their faces are familiar to me now, but I don&rsquo;t know
    whether any traces of the old likenesses worked up in my memory. I found
    Johnson an old man&mdash;old and grey before his time. He had a grizzly stubble
    round his chin and cheeks towards the end of the week, because he could only
    afford a shave on Saturday afternoon. He was working at some branch of his
    trade &ldquo;in the shop&rdquo; I understood, but he said he felt the work
    come heavier on him every winter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt very poorly this
    last winter or two,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;very poorly indeed.&rdquo; He
    was very sad and gentle.</p>
  <p>Mrs Johnson was old and thin-looking, but seemed cheerful and energetic.
    Some chest trouble kept her within doors most of the winter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind so long as I can manage,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
    Johnson gets so depressed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They seemed very kind towards each other; they spoke little of Australia,
    and then only as an incident in their lives which was not of any importance&mdash;had
    long been past and done with. It was all &ldquo;before we went to Australia&rdquo; or &ldquo;after
    we came back from Australia,&rdquo; with Mrs Johnson.</p>
  <p>The son, whom I remembered as a bright, robust little fellow, was now a
    tall, white-faced, clean-shaven young man, a clerk on thirty shillings a
    week. He wore, on Saturday afternoons and Sundays, a tall hat and a frock
    coat and overcoat made cheaply in the latest fashion, so he couldn&rsquo;t
    afford to help the old folk much.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;David is very extravagant,&rdquo; said the old man, gently. &ldquo;He
    won&rsquo;t wear anything when once the gloss is off it. But,&rdquo; with
    a sad smile, &ldquo;I get the left-off overcoats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took me across to see his daughter. She had married a tradesman and they
    were having a hard struggle in three rooms in a workman&rsquo;s dwelling.
    She was twenty-five, thin, yellow, and looking ten years older.</p>
  <p>There were other children who had died. &ldquo;I think we might have done
    better for the children in Australia,&rdquo; said the old man to me, sadly,
    when we got outside, &ldquo;but we did our best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We went into a hotel and had a drink. Johnson had treated last time&mdash;twenty
    years before. We call treating &ldquo;shouting&rdquo; in Australia. Presently
    Johnson let fall a word or two of Australian slang, and brightened up wonderfully;
    we got back out into Australia at once and stayed there an hour or so. Being
    an old man, Johnson&rsquo;s memory for the long ago was better than mine,
    and I picked up links; and, in return, I told him what Solong was like now,
    and how some men he knew, who were going up, had gone down, and others, who
    were going to the dogs in his time, had gone up&mdash;and we philosophized.
    About one he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Ah, well! who&rsquo;d have thought it! I
    never thought that boy would come to any good;&rdquo; about another, &ldquo;Ah,
    well! and he might have been an independent man.&rdquo; How familiar that
    expression sounded!&mdash;I think it is used more often in Australia than
    in any other country: &ldquo;He might have been an independent man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When I left Johnson I felt less lonely in London, and rather humbled in
    spirit. He seemed so resigned&mdash;I had never seen such gentle sadness
    in a man&rsquo;s eyes, nor heard it in a man&rsquo;s voice. I could get back
    to Australia somehow and start life again, but Johnson&rsquo;s day had been
    dead for many years.  &ldquo;Besides, assisted emigration&rsquo;s done away
    with now,&rdquo; he said, with his sad, sad smile.</p>
  <p>I saw the Johnsons again later on. &ldquo;Things have been going very sadly
    with us, very sadly indeed,&rdquo; said the old man, when we&rsquo;d settled
    down. He had broken down at the beginning of the winter, he had dragged himself
    out of bed and to work and back again until he could do so no longer; he
    had been laid up most of the winter. Mrs Johnson had not been outside the
    door for months.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It comes very hard on us,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m so
    poorly, and David out of work, too. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if I could get
    about. But,&rdquo; she went on in her energetic manner, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
    had the house full all the winter; we&rsquo;ve had very good luck with the
    lodgers, all respectable people, and one of them answers the door and that
    keeps me away from the draught&mdash;so it might be worse, mightn&rsquo;t
    it! But Johnson doesn&rsquo;t seem to mend at all, and he gets so terribly
    depressed. But the warm weather coming on, etc.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They and the Lord only knew how they managed to live, for they are honest
    people and the lodgers scarcely pay the rent of the house. There was only
    David between them and the poorhouse, as far as I could see.</p>
  <p>Johnson came out with me a piece and we had a drink or two together&mdash;his
    was gin hot. He talked a good deal about Australia, but sadly and regretfully
    on this occasion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We could have done well in Australia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;very
    well indeed. I might have been independent and the children well started
    in life. But we did things for the best. Mrs Johnson didn&rsquo;t like Australia,
    you know. It was a pity we didn&rsquo;t stay there, a great pity. We would
    have done far better than in England. I&rsquo;d go out again now if I had
    the money, but I&rsquo;m getting too old.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would Mrs Johnson go out?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. But I&rsquo;m afraid she wouldn&rsquo;t stand the voyage.
    . . . Things have been very sad with us ever since we came back to England,
    very sad indeed.&rdquo; And after a while he suddenly caught his breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It takes me that way sometimes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I catch my
    breath just as if I was going to lose it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ADrovingYarn"></a>A Droving Yarn</b></h2>
  <p>Andy Maculloch&nbsp;had heard that old Bill Barker, the well-known overland
    drover, had died over on the Westralian side, and Dave Regan told a yarn
    about Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bill Barker,&rdquo; said Dave, talking round his pipe stem, &ldquo;was
    the&nbsp;<i>quintessence</i>&nbsp;of a drover&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The whatter, Dave?&rdquo; came the voice of Jim Bentley, in startled
    tones, from the gloom on the far end of the veranda.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The quintessence,&rdquo; said Dave, taking his pipe out of his mouth.  &ldquo;You
    shut up, Jim. As I said, Bill Barker was the quintessence of a drover. He&rsquo;d
    been at the game ever since he was a nipper. He run away from home when he
    was fourteen and went up into Queensland. He&rsquo;s been all over Queensland
    and New South Wales and most of South Australia, and a good deal of the Western,
    too: over the great stock routes from one end to the other, Lord knows how
    many times. No man could keep up with him riding out, and no one could bring
    a mob of cattle or a flock of sheep through like him. He knew every trick
    of the game; if there was grass to be had Bill&rsquo;d get it, no matter
    whose run it was on. One of his games in a dry season was to let his mob
    get boxed with the station stock on a run where there was grass, and before
    Bill&rsquo;s men and the station-hands could cut &rsquo;em out, the travelling
    stock would have a good bellyful to carry them on the track. Billy was the
    daddy of the drovers. Some said that he could ride in his sleep, and that
    he had one old horse that could jog along in his sleep too, and that&mdash;travelling
    out from home to take charge of a mob of bullocks or a flock of sheep&mdash;Bill
    and his horse would often wake up at daylight and blink round to see where
    they were and how far they&rsquo;d got. Then Bill would make a fire and boil
    his quart-pot, and roast a bit of mutton, while his horse had a mouthful
    of grass and a spell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You remember Bill, Andy? Big dark man, and a joker of the loud sort.
    Never slept with a blanket over him&mdash;always folded under him on the
    sand or grass. Seldom wore a coat on the route&mdash;though he always carried
    one with him, in case he came across a bush ball or a funeral. Moleskins,
    flannel waistcoat, cabbage-tree hat and &rsquo;lastic-side boots. When it
    was roasting hot on the plains and the men swore at the heat, Jim would yell, &lsquo;Call
    this hot? Why, you blanks, I&rsquo;m freezin&rsquo;! Where&rsquo;s me overcoat?&rsquo; When
    it was raining and hailing and freezing on Bell&rsquo;s Line in the Blue
    Mountains in winter, and someone shivered and asked, &lsquo;Is it cold enough
    for yer now, Bill?&rsquo; &lsquo;Cold!&rsquo; Bill would bellow, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
    sweatin&rsquo;!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember it well. I was little more than a youngster then&mdash;Bill
    Barker came past our place with about a thousand fat sheep for the Homebush
    sale-yards at Sydney, and he gave me a job to help him down with them on
    Bell&rsquo;s Line over the mountains, and mighty proud I was to go with him,
    I can tell you. One night we camped on the Cudgegong River. The country was
    dry and pretty close cropped and we&rsquo;d been &ldquo;sweating&rdquo; the
    paddocks all along there for our horses. You see, where there weren&rsquo;t
    sliprails handy we&rsquo;d just take the tomahawk and nick the top of a straight-grained
    fence-post, just above the mortise, knock out the wood there, lift the top
    rail out and down, and jump the horses in over the lower one&mdash;it was
    all two-rail fences around there with sheep wires under the lower rail. And
    about daylight we&rsquo;d have the horses out, lift back the rail, and fit
    in the chock that we&rsquo;d knocked out. Simple as striking matches, wasn&rsquo;t
    it?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the horses were getting a good bellyful in the police horse
    paddock at night, and Bill took the first watch with the sheep. It was very
    cold and frosty on the flat and he thought the sheep might make back for
    the ridges, it&rsquo;s always warmer up in the ridges in winter out of the
    frost. Bill roused me out about midnight. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the sheep,&rsquo; he
    says, pointing to a white blur. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve settled down. I think
    they&rsquo;ll be quiet till daylight. Don&rsquo;t go round them; there&rsquo;s
    no occasion to go near &rsquo;em. You can stop by the fire and keep an eye
    on &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The night seemed very long. I watched and smoked and toasted my shins,
    and warmed the billy now and then, and thought up pretty much the same sort
    of old things that fellers on night watch think over all over the world.
    Bill lay on his blanket, with his back to the fire and his arm under his
    head&mdash;freezing on one side and roasting on the other. He never moved.
    I itched once or twice to turn him over and bake the front of him&mdash;I
    reckoned he was about done behind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At last daylight showed. I took the billy and started down to the
    river to get some water to make coffee; but half-way down, near the sheep
    camp, I stopped and stared, I was never so surprised in my life. The white
    blur of sheep had developed into a couple of acres of long dead silver grass!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I woke Bill, and he swore as I never heard a man swear before&mdash;nor
    since. He swore at the sheep, and the grass, and at me; but it would have
    wasted time, and besides I was too sleepy and tired to fight. But we found
    those sheep scattered over a scrubby ridge about seven miles back, so they
    must have slipped away back of the grass and started early in Bill&rsquo;s
    watch, and Bill must have watched that blessed grass for the first half of
    the night and then set me to watch it. He couldn&rsquo;t get away from that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wondered what the chaps would say if it got round that Bill Barker,
    the boss overland drover, had lost a thousand sheep in clear country with
    fences all round; and I suppose he thought that way too, for he kept me with
    him right down to Homebush, and when he paid me off he threw in an extra
    quid, and he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, listen here, Dave! If I ever hear a word from anyone
    about watching that gory grass, I&rsquo;ll find you, Dave, and murder you,
    if you&rsquo;re in wide Australia. I&rsquo;ll screw your neck, so look out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s dead now, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>There was silence for some time after Dave had finished. The chaps made
    no comment on the yarn, either one way or the other, but sat smoking thoughtfully,
    and in a vague atmosphere as of sadness&mdash;as if they&rsquo;d just heard
    of their mother&rsquo;s death and had not been listening to an allegedly
    humorous yarn.</p>
  <p>Then the voice of old Peter, the station-hand, was heard to growl from the
    darkness at the end of the hut, where he sat on a three-bushel bag on the
    ground with his back to the slabs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s old Peter growlin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; someone asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wants to know where Dave got that word,&rdquo; someone else replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Quint-essents</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a chuckle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He got it out back, Peter,&rdquo; said Mitchell, the shearer. &ldquo;He
    got it from a new chum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How much did yer give for it, Dave?&rdquo; growled Peter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five shillings, Peter,&rdquo; said Dave, round his pipe stem. &ldquo;And
    stick of tobacco thrown in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter seemed satisfied, for he was heard no more that evening.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BalladoftheCornstalk"></a>Ballad of the Cornstalk</b> </h2>
  <p>He hung up the stock whip and laid by the shears &mdash;<br>
    It may be for months and it may be for years;<br>
    It may be for ever &mdash; but restless was he:<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of the Bush and I&rsquo;m off for a spree!</p>

    And long may she wait by the slip-rails in vain.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;For I&rsquo;m going to the war,&rdquo;  etc.</p>
  <p>He mounted his waler and rode to the sea<br>
    (He was sick of the Bush and he longed for a spree),<br>
    He looked up the &ldquo;member&rdquo; and called for his aid<br>

  <p align="center" class="note">A Rather Fishy Yarn From The Bush<br>
(As Told By&nbsp;James&nbsp;Nowlett, Bullock-Driver)</p>
  <p>You&nbsp;might work this yarn up. I&rsquo;ve often thought of doin&rsquo; it
    meself, but I ain&rsquo;t got the words. I knowed a lot of funny an&rsquo; rum
    yarns about the bush, an&rsquo; I often wished I had the gift o&rsquo; writin&rsquo;.
    I could tell a lot better yarns than the rot they put in books sometimes,
    but I never had no eddication. But you might be able to work this yarn up&mdash;as
    yer call it.</p>
  <p>There useter be a teamster&rsquo;s camp six or seven miles out of Mudgee,
    at a place called th&rsquo; Old Pipeclay, in the days before the railroad
    went round to Dubbo, an&rsquo; most of us bullickies useter camp there for
    the night. There was always good water in the crick, an&rsquo; sometimes
    we&rsquo;d turn the bullicks up in the ridges an&rsquo; gullies behind for
    grass, an&rsquo; camp there for a few days, and do our washin&rsquo; an&rsquo; mendin&rsquo;,
    and make new yokes perhaps, an&rsquo; tinker up the wagons.</p>
  <p>There was a woman livin&rsquo; on a farm there named Mrs Hardwick&mdash;an&rsquo;  she
    was a hard wick. Her husban&rsquo;, Jimmy Hardwick, was throwed from his
    horse agenst a stump one day when he was sober, an&rsquo; he was killed&mdash;an&rsquo; she
    was a widder. She had a tidy bit o&rsquo; land, an&rsquo; a nice bit of a
    orchard an&rsquo; vineyard, an&rsquo; some cattle, an&rsquo; they say she
    had a tidy bit o&rsquo; money in the bank. She had the worst tongue in the
    district, no one&rsquo;s character was safe with her; but she wasn&rsquo;t
    old, an&rsquo; she wasn&rsquo;t bad-lookin&rsquo;&mdash;only hard&mdash;so
    there was some fellers hangin&rsquo; round arter her. An&rsquo; Dave Regan&rsquo;s
    horse was hangin&rsquo; up outside her place as often as anybody else&rsquo;s.
    Dave was a native an&rsquo; a bushy, an&rsquo; a drover an&rsquo; a digger,
    an&rsquo; he was a bit soft in them days&mdash;he got hard enough arterwards.</p>
  <p>Mrs Hardwick hated bullick-drivers&mdash;she had a awful down on bullickies&mdash;I
    dunno why. We never interfered with her fowls, an&rsquo; as for swearin&rsquo;!
    why, she could swear herself. Jimmy Hardwick was a bullick-driver when she
    married him, an&rsquo; p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps that helped to account for it.
    She wouldn&rsquo;t let us boil our billies at her kitchen fire, same as any
    other bushwoman, an&rsquo;  if one of our bullicks put his nose under her
    fence for a mouthful of grass, she&rsquo;d set her dogs onter him. An&rsquo; one
    of her dogs got something what disagreed with him one day, an&rsquo; she
    accused us of layin&rsquo; poisoned baits. An&rsquo;, arter that, she &rsquo;pounded
    some of our bullicks that got into her lucerne paddick one night when we
    was on the spree in Mudgee, an&rsquo; put heavy damages on &rsquo;em. She&rsquo;d
    left the sliprails down on purpose, I believe. She talked of puttin&rsquo; the
    police onter us, jest as if we was a sly-grog shop. (If&nbsp;<i>she&rsquo;d</i>&nbsp;kept
    a sly-grog shop she&rsquo;d have had a different opinion about bullick-drivers.)
    An&rsquo;  all the bullick-drivers hated her because she hated bullickies.</p>
  <p>Well, one wet season half a dozen of us chaps was camped there for a fortnight,
    because the roads was too boggy to travel, an&rsquo; one night they got up
    a darnce at Peter Anderson&rsquo;s shanty acrost the ridges, an&rsquo; a
    lot of gals an&rsquo;  fellers turned up from all round about in spite of
    the pourin&rsquo; rain. Someone had kidded Dave Regan that Mother Hardwick
    was comin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; he turned up, of course, in spite of a ragin&rsquo; toothache
    he had. He was always ridin&rsquo; the high horse over us bullickies. It
    was a very cold night, enough to cut the face an&rsquo;  hands off yer, so
    we had a roarin&rsquo; fire in the big bark-an&rsquo;-slab kitchen where
    the darncin&rsquo; was. It was one of them big, old-fashioned, clay-lined
    fire-places that goes right acrost the end of the room, with a twenty-five
    foot slab-an&rsquo;-tin chimbly outside.</p>
  <p>Dave Regan was pretty wild about being had, an&rsquo; we copped all the
    gals for darncin&rsquo;; he couldn&rsquo;t get one that night, an&rsquo; when
    he wasn&rsquo;t proddin&rsquo;  out his tooth with a red-hot wire someone
    was chaffin&rsquo; him about Mrs Hardwick. So at last he got disgusted an&rsquo; left;
    but before he went he got a wet three-bushel flour-bag an&rsquo; climbed
    up very quietly onter the roof by the battens an&rsquo; log weights an&rsquo; riders,
    an&rsquo; laid the wet bag very carefully acrost the top of the chimbly flue.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; we was a mortal hour tryin&rsquo; to find out what was the matter
    with that infernal chimbly, and tackin&rsquo; bits o&rsquo; tin an&rsquo; baggin&rsquo; acrost
    the top of the fire-place under the mantelshelf to try an&rsquo; stop it
    from smokin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;  all the while the gals set there with the
    water runnin&rsquo; out of their eyes. We took the green back log out an&rsquo; fetched
    in a dry one, but that chimbly smoked worse than ever, an&rsquo; we had to
    put the fire out altogether, an&rsquo; the gals set there shiverin&rsquo; till
    the rain held up a bit an&rsquo; the sky cleared, an&rsquo; then someone
    goes out an&rsquo; looks up an&rsquo; sings out, &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s
    somethin&rsquo; acrost the top of the blazin&rsquo; chimbly!&rdquo; an&rsquo; someone
    else climbs up an&rsquo; fetches down the bag. But the darnce was spoilt,
    an&rsquo; the gals was so disgusted that they went off with their fellers
    while the weather held up. They reckoned some of us bullickies did it for
    a lark.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; arter that Dave&rsquo;d come ridin&rsquo; past, an&rsquo; sing
    out to know if we knew of a good cure for a smokin&rsquo; chimbly, an&rsquo; them
    sorter things. But he always got away before we could pull him off of his
    horse. Three of us chased him on horseback one day, but we didn&rsquo;t ketch
    him.</p>
  <p>So we made up our minds to git back on Dave some way or other, an&rsquo;  it
    come about this way.</p>
  <p>About six months arter the smoked-out darnce, four or five of us same fellers
    was campin&rsquo; on th&rsquo; Pipeclay agen, an&rsquo; it was a dry season.
    It was dryer an&rsquo; hotter than it was cold &lsquo;n&rsquo; wet the larst
    time. Dave was still hangin&rsquo; round Mrs Hardwick&rsquo;s an&rsquo; doin&rsquo; odd
    jobs for her. Well, one very hot day we seen Dave ridin&rsquo; past into
    Mudgee, an&rsquo; we knowed he&rsquo;d have a spree in town that night, an&rsquo; call
    at Mrs Hardwick&rsquo;s for sympathy comin&rsquo; out next day; an&rsquo;  arter
    he&rsquo;d been gone an hour or two, Tom Tarrant comes drivin&rsquo; past
    on his mail-coach, an&rsquo; drops some letters an&rsquo; papers an&rsquo; a
    bag o&rsquo; groceries at our camp.</p>
  <p>Tom was a hard case. I remember wonst I was drivin&rsquo; along a lonely
    bit o&rsquo; track, an&rsquo; it was a grand mornin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I felt
    great, an&rsquo; I got singin&rsquo;  an&rsquo; practisin&rsquo; a recitation
    that I allers meant to give at a bush darnce some night. (I never sung or
    spouted poetry unless I was sure I was miles away from anyone.) An&rsquo; I
    got worked up, an&rsquo; was wavin&rsquo; me arms about an&rsquo; throwin&rsquo; it
    off of me chest, when Tom&rsquo;s coach comes up behind, round a bend in
    the road, an&rsquo;  took me by surprise. An&rsquo; Tom looked at me very
    hard an&rsquo; he says, &ldquo;What are yer shoutin&rsquo; an&rsquo; swearin&rsquo; an&rsquo; darncin&rsquo; an&rsquo; goin&rsquo; on
    at the bullicks like that for, Jimmy? They seem to be workin&rsquo; all right.&rdquo; It
    took me back, I can tell yer. The coach was full of grinnin&rsquo; passengers,
    an&rsquo; the worst of it was that I didn&rsquo;t know how long Tom had been
    drivin&rsquo; slow behind me an&rsquo; takin&rsquo; me out of windin&rsquo;.
    There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; upsets a cove as can&rsquo;t sing so much as
    to be caught singin&rsquo; or spoutin&rsquo; poetry when he thinks he&rsquo;s
    privit&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; another time I remember Tom&rsquo;s coach broke down on the track,
    an&rsquo; he had to ride inter town with the mails on horseback; an&rsquo; he
    left a couple of greenhides, for Skinner the tanner at Mudgee, for me to
    take on in the wagon, an&rsquo; a bag of potatoes for Murphy the storekeeper
    at Home Rule, an&rsquo; a note that said: &ldquo;Render unto Murphy the things
    which is murphies, and unto Skinner them things which is skins.&rdquo; Tom
    was a hard case.</p>
  <p>Well, this day, when Tom handed down the tucker an&rsquo; letters, he got
    down to stretch his legs and give the horses a breathe. The coach was full
    of passengers, an&rsquo; I noticed they all looked extra glum and sulky,
    but I reckoned it was the heat an&rsquo; dust. Tom looked extra solemn, too,
    an&rsquo; no one was talkin&rsquo;. Then I suddenly began to notice something
    in the atmosphere, as if there was a dead beast not far away, an&rsquo; my
    mates started sniffin&rsquo; too. An&rsquo;  that reminds me, it&rsquo;s
    funny why some people allers sniff hard instead of keepin&rsquo; their noses
    shut when there&rsquo;s a stink; the more it stinks the more they sniff.
    Tom spit in the dust an&rsquo; thought a while; then he took a parcel out
    of the boot an&rsquo; put it on the corner post of the fence. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some fresh fish that come up from Sydney by train
    an&rsquo; Cobb &amp; Co&rsquo;s coach larst night. They&rsquo;re meant for
    White the publican at Gulgong, but they won&rsquo;t keep this weather till
    I git out there. Pity to waste them! you chaps might as well have a feed
    of &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ll tell White they went bad an&rsquo; I had to throw
    them out,&rdquo; says Tom. Then he got on to the coach agen an&rsquo; drove
    off in a cloud of dust. We undone the brown paper, an&rsquo; the fish was
    in a small deal box, with a lid fastened by a catch. We nicked back the catch
    an&rsquo; the lid flew open, an&rsquo;  then we knowed where the smell comed
    from all right. There wasn&rsquo;t any doubt about that! We didn&rsquo;t
    have to put our noses in the box to see if the fish was bad. They was packed
    in salt, but that made no difference.</p>
  <p>You know how a smell will start sudden in the bush on a hot, still day,
    an&rsquo; then seem to take a spell, an&rsquo; then get to work agen stronger
    than ever. You might be clost alongside of a horse that has been dead a fortnight
    an&rsquo; smell nothin&rsquo; particular till you start to walk away, an&rsquo; the
    further you go the worse it stinks. It seems to smell most round in a circle
    of a hundred yards or so. But these fish smelt from the centre right out.
    Tom Tarrant told us arterwards that them fish started to smell as soon as
    he left Mudgee. At first they reckoned it was a dead horse by the road; but
    arter a while the passengers commenced squintin&rsquo; at each other suspicious
    like, an&rsquo; the conversation petered out, an&rsquo; Tom thought he felt
    all their eyes on his back, an&rsquo; it was very uncomfortable; an&rsquo; he
    sat tight an&rsquo; tried to make out where the smell come from; an&rsquo; it
    got worse every hundred yards&mdash;like as if the track was lined with dead
    horses, an&rsquo; every one dead longer than the last&mdash;till it was like
    drivin&rsquo; a funeral. An&rsquo; Tom never thought of the fish till he
    got down to stretch his legs and fetched his nose on a level with the boot.</p>
  <p>Well, we shut down the lid of that box quick an&rsquo; took it an&rsquo;  throwed
    it in the bushes a good way away from the camp, but next mornin&rsquo;, while
    we was havin&rsquo; breakfast, Billy Grimshaw got an idea, an&rsquo; arter
    breakfast he wetted a canvas bag he had an&rsquo; lit up his pipe, an&rsquo; went
    an&rsquo; got that there box o&rsquo; fish, an&rsquo; put it in the wet bag,
    an&rsquo; wrapped it tight round it an&rsquo; tied it up tight with string.
    Billy had a nipper of a nephew with him, about fourteen, named Tommy, an&rsquo; he
    was a sharp kid if ever there was one. So Billy says, &ldquo;Look here, Tommy,
    you take this fish up to Mrs Hardwick&rsquo;s an&rsquo; tell her that Dave
    Regan sent &rsquo;em with his compliments, an&rsquo; he hopes she&rsquo;ll
    enjoy &rsquo;em. Tell her that Dave fetched &rsquo;em from Mudgee, but he&rsquo;s
    gone back to look for a pound note that he dropped out of a hole in his pocket
    somewheers along the road, an&rsquo; he asked you to take the fish up.&rdquo; So
    Tommy takes the fish an&rsquo; goes up to the house with &rsquo;em. When
    he come back he says that Mrs Hardwick smiled like a parson an&rsquo; give
    him a shillin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; he didn&rsquo;t wait. We watched the
    house, an&rsquo; about half an hour arterwards we seen her run out of the
    kitchen with the open box in her hand, an&rsquo; run a good way away from
    the house an&rsquo; throw the fish inter the bushes, an&rsquo; then go back
    quick, holdin&rsquo; her nose.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; jest then, as luck would have it, we seen Dave Regan ridin&rsquo; up
    from the creek towards the house. He got down an&rsquo; went into the kitchen,
    an&rsquo;  then come backin&rsquo; out agen in a hurry with her in front
    of him. We could hear her voice from where we was, but we couldn&rsquo;t
    hear what she said. But we could see her arms wavin&rsquo; as if she was
    drivin&rsquo; fowls, an&rsquo; Dave backed all the way to his horse and gets
    on an&rsquo; comes ridin&rsquo; away quick, she screamin&rsquo; arter him
    all the time. When he got down opposite the camp we sung out to know what
    was the matter. &ldquo;What have you been doin&rsquo; to Mrs Hardwick, Dave?&rdquo; we
    says. &ldquo;We heerd her goin&rsquo; for yer proper jest now.&rdquo; &ldquo;Damned
    if I know,&rdquo; says Dave. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t done nothin&rsquo; to her
    that I knows of. She&rsquo;s called me everything she can lay her tongue
    to, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s ravin&rsquo; about my stinkin&rsquo; fish, or somethin&rsquo;.
    I can&rsquo;t make it out at all. I believe she&rsquo;s gone ratty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&nbsp;<i>must</i>&nbsp;have been doin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; to
    the woman,&rdquo; we says, &ldquo;or else she wouldn&rsquo;t have gone on
    at yer like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Dave swore he hadn&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; we talked it over for a while
    an&rsquo;  couldn&rsquo;t make head nor tail of it, an&rsquo; we come to
    the conclusion that it was only a touch o&rsquo; the sun.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Dave,&rdquo; we says. &ldquo;Go up agen in a day or two,
    when she&rsquo;s cooled down, an&rsquo; find out what the matter is. Or write
    to her. It might only have been someone makin&rsquo; mischief. That&rsquo;s
    what it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Dave only sat an&rsquo; rubbed his head, an&rsquo; presently he started
    home to wherever he was hangin&rsquo; out. He wanted a quiet week to think.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her chimbly might have been smokin&rsquo;, Dave,&rdquo; we shouted
    arter him, but he was too dazed like to ketch on.</p>
  <p>Well, in a month or two we was campin&rsquo; there agen, an&rsquo; we found
    she&rsquo;d fenced in a lane to the crick she had no right to, an&rsquo; we
    had to take the bullicks a couple o&rsquo; miles round to grass an&rsquo; water.
    Well, the first mornin&rsquo; we seen her down in the corner of her paddick
    near the camp drivin&rsquo; some heifers, an&rsquo; Billy Grimshaw went up
    to the fence an&rsquo; spoke to her. Billy was the only one of us that dared
    face her and he was the only one she was ever civil to&mdash;p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps
    because Billy had a squint an&rsquo; a wall eye and that put her out of countenance.</p>
  <p>Billy took off his hat very respectful an&rsquo; sings out, &ldquo;Mrs Hardwick.&rdquo; (It
    was Billy&rsquo;s bullicks she&rsquo;d &ldquo;pounded,&rdquo; by the way.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you, Mrs Hardwick,&rdquo; says Billy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, speak,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no time to waste
    talkin&rsquo; to bullick-drivers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the fact is, Mrs Hardwick,&rdquo; says Billy, &ldquo;that I
    want to explain somethin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; apologize for that young scamp
    of a nephew o&rsquo; mine, young Tommy. He ain&rsquo;t here or I&rsquo;d
    make him beg your pardon hisself, or I&rsquo;d cut him to pieces with the
    bullick-whip. I heard all about Dave Regan sendin&rsquo; you that stinkin&rsquo; fish,
    an&rsquo; I think it was a damned mean, dirty thing to do&mdash;to send stinkin&rsquo; fish
    to a woman, an&rsquo; especially to a widder an&rsquo; an unprotected woman
    like you, Mrs Hardwick. I&rsquo;ve had mothers an&rsquo; sisters of me own.
    An&rsquo; I want to tell you that I&rsquo;m sorry a relation o&rsquo; mine
    ever had anythin&rsquo; to do with it. As soon as I heerd of it I give young
    Tommy a lambastin&rsquo; he won&rsquo;t forgit in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did Tommy know the fish was bad?&rdquo; she says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter a rap,&rdquo; says Billy; &ldquo;he had no
    right to go takin&rsquo; messages from nobody to nobody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Hardwick thought a while. Then she says: &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps
    arter all Dave Regan didn&rsquo;t know the fish was bad. I&rsquo;ve often
    thought I might have been in too much of a hurry. Things goes bad so quick
    out here in this weather. An&rsquo;  Dave was always very friendly. I can&rsquo;t
    understand why he&rsquo;d do a dirty thing on me like that. I never done
    anything to Dave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now I forgot to tell you that Billy had a notion that Dave helped drive
    his bullicks to pound that time, though I didn&rsquo;t believe it. So Billy
    says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe that for a minute, Mrs Hardwick. Dave knew
    what he was a-doin&rsquo; of all right; an&rsquo; if I ketch him I&rsquo;ll
    give him a beltin&rsquo; for it if no one else is man enough to stand up
    for a woman!&rdquo; says Billy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;yer know Dave knew?&rdquo; says Mrs Hardwick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Know!&rdquo; says Billy. &ldquo;Why, he talked about it all over
    the district. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she screamed out, an&rsquo; I moved away from that there
    fence, for she had a stick to drive them heifers with. But Billy stood his
    ground. &ldquo;Is that the truth, Billy Grimshaw?&rdquo; she screams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take me oath on it. He blowed
    about it all over the district, as if it was very funny, an&rsquo; he says&mdash;&rdquo; An&rsquo; Billy
    stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; she shouted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the fact is,&rdquo; says Billy, &ldquo;that I hardly like to
    tell it to a lady. I wouldn&rsquo;t like to tell yer, Mrs Hardwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll have to tell me, Billy Grimshaw,&rdquo; she screams. &ldquo;I
    have a right to know. If you don&rsquo;t tell me I&rsquo;ll pull him next
    week an&rsquo; have it dragged out of you in the witness-box!&rdquo; she
    says. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll have satisfaction out of him in the felon&rsquo;s
    dock of a court of law!&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;What did the villain say?&rdquo; she
    screams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says Billy, &ldquo;if yer must have it&mdash;an&rsquo;,
    anyway, I&rsquo;m hanged if I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to stand by an&rsquo; see
    a woman scandalized behind her back&mdash;if yer must have it I&rsquo;ll
    tell yer. Dave said that the fish didn&rsquo;t smell no worse than your place
    anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We got away from there then. She cut up too rough altogether. I can&rsquo;t
    tell you what she said&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t got the words. She went up to
    the house, an&rsquo; we seen the farm-hand harnessin&rsquo; up the horse,
    an&rsquo; we reckoned she was goin&rsquo; to drive into town straight away
    an&rsquo; take out a summons agenst Dave Regan. An&rsquo; jest then Dave
    hisself comes ridin&rsquo; past&mdash;jest when he was most wanted, as usual.
    He always rode fast past Mrs Hardwick&rsquo;s nowadays, an&rsquo; never stopped
    there, but Billy shouted after him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo, Dave! I want to speak to yer,&rdquo; shouts Billy. An&rsquo; Dave
    yanks his horse round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Billy?&rdquo; he says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Dave,&rdquo; says Billy. &ldquo;You had your little joke
    about the chimbly, an&rsquo; we had our little joke about the fish an&rsquo; Mrs
    Hardwick, so now we&rsquo;ll call it quits. A joke&rsquo;s a joke, but it
    can go too far, an&rsquo; this one&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; too red-hot altogether.
    So we&rsquo;ve fixed it up with Mrs Hardwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What fish an&rsquo; what joke?&rdquo; says Dave, rubbin&rsquo; his
    head. &ldquo;An&rsquo; what have yer fixed up with Mrs Hardwick? Whatever
    are yer talkin&rsquo; about, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So Billy told him all about us sendin&rsquo; the stinkin&rsquo; fish to
    Mrs Hardwick by Tommy, an&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; Dave sent &rsquo;em&mdash;Dave
    rubbin&rsquo; the back of his neck an&rsquo; starin&rsquo; at Billy all the
    time. &ldquo;An&rdquo; now,&rdquo; says Billy, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say anything
    about them bullicks; but I went up and seen Mrs Hardwick this mornin&rsquo;,
    an&rsquo; told her the whole truth about them fish, an&rsquo; how you knowed
    nothin&rsquo; about it, an&rsquo; I apologized an&rsquo; told her we was
    very sorry; an&rsquo; she says she was very sorry too on your account, an&rsquo; wanted
    to see yer. I promised to tell yer as soon as I seen yer. It ought to be
    fixed up. You ought to go right up to the house an&rsquo;  see her now. She&rsquo;s
    awfully cut up about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; says Dave, brightenin&rsquo; up. &ldquo;It was
    a dirty, mean trick anyway to play on a cove; but I&rsquo;ll go up an&rsquo; see
    her.&rdquo; An&rsquo; he went there  &lsquo;n&rsquo; then.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; about fifteen minutes arterwards he comes boltin&rsquo; back from
    the house one way an&rsquo; his horse the other. The horse acted as if it
    had a big scare, an&rsquo; so did Dave. Billy went an&rsquo; ketched Dave&rsquo;s
    horse for him, an&rsquo; I got Dave a towel to wipe the dirty dish-water
    off of his face an&rsquo; out of his hair an&rsquo; collar, an&rsquo; I give
    him a piece of soap to rub on the places where he&rsquo;d been scalded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, the woman must be ravin&rsquo; mad,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Whatever
    did yer say to her this time, Dave? Yer allers gettin&rsquo; inter hot water
    with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Dave. &ldquo;I jest
    went up laughin&rsquo; like, an&rsquo; says, &lsquo;How are yer, Mrs Hardwick?&rsquo; an&rsquo; she
    ups an&rsquo; lets me have a dish of dirty wash-up water, an&rsquo; then
    on top of that she let fly with a dipper of scaldin&rsquo;-hot, greasy water
    outer the boiler. She&rsquo;s gone clean ravin&rsquo; mad, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s as mad as a hatter, right enough, Dave,&rdquo; says Billy
    Grimshaw. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go there no more, Dave, it ain&rsquo;t safe.&rdquo; An&rsquo; we
    lent Dave a hat an&rsquo; a clean shirt, an&rsquo; he went on inter town. &ldquo;You
    ought to have humoured her,&rdquo; says Billy, as Dave rode away. &ldquo;You
    ought to have told her to put a wet bag over her chimbly an&rsquo; hang the
    fish inside to smoke.&rdquo; But Dave was too stunned to ketch on. He went
    on inter the town an&rsquo; got on a howlin&rsquo; spree. An&rsquo;  while
    he was soberin&rsquo; up the thing began to dawn on him. An&rsquo; the nex&rsquo; time
    he met Billy they had a fight. An&rsquo; Dave got another woman to speak
    to Mrs Hardwick, an&rsquo; Mrs Hardwick ketched young Tommy goin&rsquo; past
    her place one day an&rsquo;  bailed him up an&rsquo; scared the truth out
    of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; she says to him, &ldquo;I want the truth, the whole
    truth, an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; but the truth about them fish, an&rsquo; if
    I don&rsquo;t get it outer you I&rsquo;ll wring her young neck for tryin&rsquo; to
    poison me, an&rsquo; save yer from the gallust!&rdquo;  she says to Tommy.</p>
  <p>So he told her the whole truth, swelp him, an&rsquo; got away; an&rsquo; he
    respected Mrs Hardwick arter that.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; next time we come past with the teams we seen Dave&rsquo;s horse
    hangin&rsquo; up outside Mrs Hardwick&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; we went some miles
    further along the road an&rsquo; camped in a new place where we&rsquo;d be
    more comfortable. An&rsquo; ever arter that we used to always whip up an&rsquo; drive
    past her place as if we didn&rsquo;t know her.</p>

  <p align="center" class="note">Told By Joe Wilson </p>
  <p class="note">God&rsquo;s preacher, of churches unheeded,<br>
    God&rsquo;s vineyard, though barren the sod,<br>
    Plain spokesman where spokesman is needed,<br>
    Rough link &rsquo;twixt the Bushman and God.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The
Christ of the Never.</i></p>
  <p>I&nbsp;never&nbsp;told you about Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan. He was a sort of
    bush missionary up-country and out back in Australia, and before he died
    he was known from Riverina down south in New South Wales to away up through
    the Never-Never country in western Queensland.</p>
  <p>His past was a mystery, so, of course, there were all sorts of yarns about
    him. He was supposed to be a Scotchman from London, and some said that he
    had got into trouble in his young days and had had to clear out of the old
    country; or, at least, that he had been a ne&rsquo;e-er-do-well and had been
    sent out to Australia on the remittance system. Some said he&rsquo;d studied
    for the law, some said he&rsquo;d studied for a doctor, while others believed
    that he was, or had been, an ordained minister. I remember one man who swore
    (when he was drinking) that he had known Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan as a medical
    student in a big London hospital, and that he had started in practice for
    himself somewhere near Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road in London. Anyway, as I got
    to know him he struck me as being a man who had looked into the eyes of so
    much misery in his life that some of it had got into his own.</p>
  <p>He was a tall man, straight and well built, and about forty or forty-five,
    when I first saw him. He had wavy dark hair, and a close, curly beard. I
    once heard a woman say that he had a beard like you see in some Bible pictures
    of Christ. Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan seldom smiled; there was something in his
    big dark brown eyes that was scarcely misery, nor yet sadness&mdash;a sort
    of haunted sympathy.</p>
  <p>He must have had money, or else he got remittances from home, for he paid
    his way and helped many a poor devil. They said that he gave away most of
    his money. Sometimes he worked for a while himself as bookkeeper at a shearing-shed,
    wool-sorter, shearer, even rouseabout; he&rsquo;d work at anything a bushman
    could get to do. Then he&rsquo;d go out back to God-forgotten districts and
    preach to bushmen in one place, and get a few children together in another
    and teach them to read. He could take his drink, and swear a little when
    he thought it necessary. On one occasion, at a rough shearing-shed, he called
    his beloved brethren &ldquo;damned fools&rdquo; for drinking their cheques.</p>
  <p>Towards the end of his life if he went into a &ldquo;rough&rdquo; shed or
    shanty west of the Darling River&mdash;and some of them were rough&mdash;there
    would be a rest in the language and drinking, even a fight would be interrupted,
    and there would be more than one who would lift their hats to Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan.
    A bushman very rarely lifts his hat to a man, yet the worst characters of
    the West have listened bareheaded to Peter when he preached.</p>
  <p>It was said in our district that Peter only needed to hint to the squatter
    that he wanted fifty or a hundred pounds to help someone or something, and
    the squatter would give it to him without question or hesitation.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d nurse sick boundary-riders, shearers, and station-hands, often
    sitting in the desolate hut by the bedside of a sick man night after night.
    And, if he had time, he&rsquo;d look up the local blacks and see how they
    were getting on. Once, on a far out back sheep station, he sat for three
    nights running, by the bedside of a young Englishman, a B.A. they said he
    was, who&rsquo;d been employed as tutor at the homestead and who died a wreck,
    the result of five years of life in London and Paris. The poor fellow was
    only thirty. And the last few hours of his life he talked to Peter in French,
    nothing but French. Peter understood French and one or two other languages,
    besides English and Australian; but whether the young wreck was raving or
    telling the story of a love, or his life, none of us ever knew, for Peter
    never spoke of it. But they said that at the funeral Peter&rsquo;s eyes seemed
    haunted more than usual.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the yarn about Peter and the dying cattle at Piora Station
    one terrible drought, when the surface was as bare as your hand for hundreds
    of miles, and the heat like the breath of a furnace, and the sheep and cattle
    were perishing by thousands. Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan was out on the run helping
    the station-hands to pull out cattle that had got bogged in the muddy waterholes
    and were too weak to drag themselves out, when, about dusk, a gentlemanly  &ldquo;piano-fingered&rdquo; parson,
    who had come to the station from the next town, drove out in his buggy to
    see the men. He spoke to Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you not think we should offer
    up a prayer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Peter, standing in his shirt sleeves, a rope
    in his hands and mud from head to foot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For? Why, for rain, brother,&rdquo; replied the parson, a bit surprised.</p>
  <p>Peter held up his finger and said &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now, with a big mob of travelling stock camped on the plain at night, there
    is always a lowing, soughing or moaning sound, a sound like that of the sea
    on the shore at a little distance; and, altogether, it might be called the
    sigh or yawn of a big mob in camp. But the long, low moaning of cattle dying
    of hunger and thirst on the hot barren plain in a drought is altogether different,
    and, at night, there is something awful about it&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t
    describe it. This is what Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan heard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; he asked the other preacher.</p>
  <p>The little parson said he did. Perhaps he only heard the weak lowing of
    cattle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think that God will hear us when He does not hear that?&rdquo;  asked
    Peter.</p>
  <p>The parson stared at him for a moment and then got into his buggy and drove
    away, greatly shocked and deeply offended. But, later on, over tea at the
    homestead, he said that he felt sure that that &ldquo;unfortunate man,&rdquo; Peter
    M&lsquo;Laughlan, was not in his right mind; that his wandering, irregular
    life, or the heat, must have affected him.</p>
  <p>I well remember the day when I first heard Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan preach.
    I was about seventeen then. We used sometimes to attend service held on Sunday
    afternoon, about once a month, in a little slab-and-bark school-house in
    the scrub off the main road, three miles or so from our selection, in a barren
    hole amongst the western ridges of the Great Dividing Range. School was held
    in this hut for a few weeks or a few months now and again, when a teacher
    could be got to stay there and teach, and cook for himself, for a pound a
    week, more or less contributed by the parents. A parson from the farming
    town to the east, or the pastoral town over the ridges to the west, used
    to come in his buggy when it didn&rsquo;t rain and wasn&rsquo;t too hot to
    hold the service.</p>
  <p>I remember this Sunday. It was a blazing hot day towards the end of a long
    and fearful drought which ruined many round there. The parson was expected,
    and a good few had come to &ldquo;chapel&rdquo; in spring-carts, on horseback,
    and on foot; farmers and their wives and sons and daughters. The children
    had been brought here to Sunday-school, taught by some of the girls, in the
    morning. I can see it all now quite plain: The one-roomed hut, for it was
    no more, with the stunted blue-grey gum scrub all round. The white, dusty
    road, so hot that you could cook eggs in the dust. The horses tied up, across
    the road, in the supposed shade under clumps of scraggy saplings along by
    the fence of a cattle-run. The little crowd outside the hut: selectors in
    washed and mended tweeds, some with paper collars, some wearing starched
    and ironed white coats, and in blucher boots, greased or blackened, or the
    young men wearing &ldquo;larstins&rdquo;  (elastic-side boots). The women
    and girls in prints and cottons (or cheap  &ldquo;alpaca,&rdquo; etc.), and
    a bright bit of ribbon here and there amongst the girls. The white heat blazed
    everywhere, and &ldquo;dazzled&rdquo; across light-coloured surfaces&mdash;dead
    white trees, fence-posts, and sand-heaps, like an endless swarm of bees passing
    in the sun&rsquo;s glare. And over above the dry box-scrub-covered ridges,
    the great Granite Peak, glaring like a molten mass.</p>
  <p>The people didn&rsquo;t like to go inside out of the heat and sit down before
    the minister came. The wretched hut was a rough school, sometimes with a
    clay fire-place where the teacher cooked, and a corner screened off with
    sacking where he had his bunk; it was a camp for tramps at other times, or
    lizards and possums, but to-day it was a house of God, and as such the people
    respected it.</p>
  <p>The town parson didn&rsquo;t turn up. Perhaps he was unwell, or maybe the
    hot, dusty ten-mile drive was too much for him to face. One of the farmers,
    who had tried to conduct service on a previous occasion on which the ordained
    minister had failed us, had broken down in the middle of it, so he was out
    of the question. We waited for about an hour, and then who should happen
    to ride along but Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan, and one or two of the elder men
    asked him to hold service. He was on his way to see a sick friend at a sheep
    station over the ridges, but he said that he could spare an hour or two.
    (Nearly every man who was sick, either in stomach or pocket, was a friend
    of Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan.) Peter tied up his horse under a bush shed at
    the back of the hut, and we followed him in.</p>
  <p>The &ldquo;school&rdquo; had been furnished with a rough deal table and
    a wooden chair for &ldquo;the teacher,&rdquo; and with a few rickety desks
    and stools cadged from an old &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; school in town when
    the new public school was built; and the desks and stools had been fastened
    to the floor to strengthen them; they had been made for &ldquo;infant&rdquo; classes,
    and youth out our way ran to length. But when grown men over six feet high
    squeezed in behind the desks and sat down on the stools the effect struck
    me as being ridiculous. In fact, I am afraid that on the first occasion it
    rather took my attention from the sermon, and I remember being made very
    uncomfortable by a school chum., Jack Barnes, who took a delight in catching
    my eye and winking or grinning. He could wink without changing a solemn line
    in his face and grin without exploding, and I couldn&rsquo;t. The boys usually
    sat on seats, slabs on blocks of wood, along the wall at the far end of the
    room, which was comfortable, for they had a rest for their backs. One or
    two of the boys were nearing six feet high, so they could almost rest their
    chins on their knees as they sat. But I squatted with some of my tribe on
    a stool along the wall by the teacher&rsquo;s table, and so could see most
    of the congregation.</p>
  <p>Above us bare tie-beams and the round sapling rafters (with the bark still
    on), and the inner sides of the sheets of stringybark that formed the roof.
    The slabs had been lined with sacking at one time, but most of it had fallen
    or dry-rotted away; there were wide cracks between the slabs and we could
    see the white glare of sunlight outside, with a strip of dark shade, like
    a deep trench in the white ground, by the back wall. Someone had brought
    a canvas water-bag and hung it to the beams on the other side of the minister&rsquo;s
    table, with a pint-pot over the tap, and the drip, drip from the bag made
    the whole place seem cooler.</p>
  <p>I studied Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan first. He was dressed in washed and mended
    tweed vest and trousers, and had on a long, lightcoloured coat of a material
    which we called &ldquo;Chinese silk.&rdquo; He wore a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; cotton
    shirt with collar attached, and blucher boots.</p>
  <p>He gave out a hymn in his quiet, natural way, said a prayer, gave out another
    hymn, read a chapter from the Bible, and then gave out another hymn. They
    liked to sing, out in those places. The Southwicks used to bring a cranky
    little harmonium in the back of their old dog-cart, and Clara Southwick used
    to accompany the hymns. She was a very pretty girl, fair, and could play
    and sing well. I used to think she had the sweetest voice I ever heard. But&mdash;ah,
    well&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>Peter didn&rsquo;t sing himself, at first. I got an idea that he couldn&rsquo;t.
    While they were singing he stood loosely, with one hand in his trouser-pocket,
    scratching his beard with his hymn-book, and looking as if he were thinking
    things over, and only rousing himself to give another verse. He forgot to
    give it once or twice, but we got through all right. I noticed the wife of
    one of the men who had asked Peter to preach looking rather black at her
    husband, and I reckoned that he&rsquo;d get it hotter than the weather on
    the way home.</p>
  <p>Then Peter stood up and commenced to preach. He stood with both hands in
    his pockets, at first, his coat ruffled back, and there was the stem of a
    clay pipe sticking out of his waistcoatpocket. The pipe fascinated me for
    a while, but after that I forgot the pipe and was fascinated by the man.
    Peter&rsquo;s face was one that didn&rsquo;t strike you at first with its
    full strength, it grew on you; it grew on me, and before he had done preaching
    I thought it was the noblest face I had ever seen.</p>
  <p>He didn&rsquo;t preach much of hope in this world. How could he? The drought
    had been blazing over these districts for nearly a year, with only a shower
    now and again, which was a mockery&mdash;scarcely darkening the baked ground.
    Wheat crops came up a few inches and were parched by the sun or mown for
    hay, or the cattle turned on them; and last year there had been rust and
    smut in the wheat. And, on top of it all, the dreadful cattle plague, pleuro-pneumonia,
    had somehow been introduced into the district. One big farmer had lost fifty
    milkers in a week.</p>
  <p>Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan didn&rsquo;t preach much of hope in this world; how
    could he? There were men there who had slaved for twenty, thirty, forty years;
    worked as farmers have to work in few other lands&mdash;first to clear the
    stubborn bush from the barren soil, then to fence the ground, and manure
    it, and force crops from it&mdash;and for what? There was Cox, the farmer,
    starved off his selection after thirty years and going out back with his
    drays to work at tank-sinking for a squatter. There was his eldest son going
    shearing or droving&mdash;anything he could get to do&mdash;a stoop-shouldered,
    young-old man of thirty. And behind them, in the end, would be a dusty patch
    in the scrub, a fencepost here and there, and a pile of chimney-stones and
    a hardwood slab or two where the hut was&mdash;for thirty hard years of the
    father&rsquo;s life and twenty of the son&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>I forget Peter&rsquo;s text, if he had a text; but the gist of his sermon
    was that there was a God&mdash;there was a heaven! And there were men there
    listening who needed to believe these things. There was old Ross from across
    the creek, old, but not sixty, a hard man. Only last week he had broken down
    and fallen on his knees on the baked sods in the middle of his ploughed ground
    and prayed for rain. His frightened boys had taken him home, and later on,
    the same afternoon, when they brought news of four more cows down with &ldquo;the
    pleuro&rdquo;  in an outer paddock, he had stood up outside his own door
    and shaken his fist at the brassy sky and cursed high heaven to the terror
    of his family, till his brave, sun-browned wife dragged him inside and soothed
    him. And Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan knew all about this.</p>
  <p>Ross&rsquo;s family had the doctor out to him, and persuaded him to come
    to church this Sunday. The old man sat on the front seat, stooping forward,
    with his elbow resting on the desk and his chin on his hand, bunching up
    his beard over his mouth with his fingers and staring gloomily at Peter with
    dark, piercing eyes from under bushy eyebrows, just as I&rsquo;ve since seen
    a Scotchman stare at Max O&rsquo;Rell all through a humorous lecture called &ldquo;A
    nicht wi&rsquo; Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ross&rsquo;s right hand resting on the desk was very eloquent horny, scarred
    and knotted at every joint, with broken, twisted nails, and nearly closed,
    as though fitted to the handle of an axe or a spade. Ross was an educated
    man (he had a regular library of books at home), and perhaps that&rsquo;s
    why he suffered so much.</p>
  <p>Peter preached as if he were speaking quietly to one person only, but every
    word was plain and every sentence went straight to someone. I believe he
    looked every soul in the eyes before he had done. Once he said something
    and caught my eye, and I felt a sudden lump in my throat. There was a boy
    there, a pale, thin, sensitive boy who was eating his heart out because of
    things he didn&rsquo;t understand. He was ambitious and longed for something
    different from this life; he&rsquo;d written a story or two and some rhymes
    for the local paper; his companions considered him a &ldquo;bit ratty&rdquo; and
    the grown-up people thought him a  &ldquo;bit wrong in his head,&rdquo; idiotic,
    or at least &ldquo;queer.&rdquo; And during his sermon Peter spoke of &ldquo;unsatisfied
    longings,&rdquo; of the hope of something better, and said that one had to
    suffer much and for long years before he could preach or write; and then
    he looked at that boy. I knew the boy very well; he has risen in the world
    since then.</p>
  <p>Peter spoke of the life we lived, of the things we knew, and used names
    and terms that we used. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it was a blanky
    sermon or a blanky lecture,&rdquo; said long swanky Jim Bullock afterwards, &ldquo;but
    it was straight and hit some of us hard. It hit me once or twice, I can tell
    yer.&rdquo; Peter spoke of our lives: &ldquo;And there is beauty&mdash;even
    in this life and in this place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothing is wasted&mdash;nothing
    is without reason. There is beauty even in this place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I noticed something like a hint of a hard smile on Ross&rsquo;s face; he
    moved the hand on the desk and tightened it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peter, as if in answer to Ross&rsquo;s expression
    and the movement of his hand, &ldquo;there is beauty in this life here. After
    a good season, and when the bush is tall and dry, when the bush-fires threaten
    a man&rsquo;s crop of ripened wheat, there are tired men who run and ride
    from miles round to help that man, and who fight the fire all night to save
    his wheat&mdash;and some of them may have been wrangling with him for years.
    And in the morning, when the wheat is saved and the danger is past, when
    the fire is beaten out or turned, there are blackened, grimy hands that come
    together and grip&mdash;hands that have not joined for many a long day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Palmer, Ross&rsquo;s neighbour, moved uneasily. He had once helped Ross
    to put a fire out, but they had quarrelled again since. Ross still sat in
    the same position, looking the hard man he was. Peter glanced at Ross, looked
    down and thought a while, and then went on again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is beauty even in this life and in this place. When a man loses
    his farm, or his stock, or his crop, through no fault of his own, there are
    poor men who put their hands into their pockets to help him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Kurtz, over the ridge, had had his stacked crop of wheat in sheaf burned&mdash;some
    scoundrel had put a match to it at night&mdash;and the farmers round had
    collected nearly fifty pounds for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is beauty even in this life and in this place. In the blazing
    drought, when the cattle lie down and cannot rise from weakness, neighbours
    help neighbours to lift them. When one man has hay or chaff and no stock,
    he gives it or sells it cheaply to the poor man who has starving cattle and
    no fodder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I only knew one or two instances of this kind; but Peter was preaching of
    what man should do as well as what they did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When a man meets with an accident, or dies, there are young men who
    go with their ploughs and horses and plough the ground for him or his widow
    and put in the crop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim Bullock and one or two other young men squirmed. They had ploughed old
    Leonard&rsquo;s land for him when he met with an accident in the shape of
    a broken leg got by a kick from a horse. They had also ploughed the ground
    for Mrs Phipps when her husband died, working, by the way, all Saturday afternoon
    and Sunday, for they were very busy at home at that time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is beauty even in this life and in this place. There are women
    who were friends in girlhood and who quarrelled bitterly over a careless
    word, an idle tale, or some paltry thing, who live within a mile of each
    other and have not spoken for years; yet let one fall ill, or lose husband
    or child, and the other will hurry across to her place and take off her bonnet
    and tuck up her sleeves, and set to work to help straighten things, and they
    will kiss, and cry in each other&rsquo;s arms, and be sisters again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I saw tears in the eyes of two hard and hard-faced women I knew; but they
    were smiling to each other through their tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;I want to talk to you about some
    other things. I am not preaching as a man who has been taught to preach comfortably,
    but as a man who has learned in the world&rsquo;s school. I know what trouble
    is. Men,&rdquo; he said, still speaking quietly, &ldquo;and women too! I
    have been through trouble as deep as any of yours&mdash;perhaps deeper. I
    know how you toil and suffer, I know what battles you fight, I know. I too
    fought a battle, perhaps as hard as any you fight. I carry a load and am
    fighting a battle still.&rdquo; His eyes were very haggard just them. &ldquo;But
    this is not what I wanted to talk to you about. I have nothing to say against
    a young man going away from this place to better himself, but there are young
    men who go out back shearing or droving, young men who are goodhearted but
    careless, who make cheques, and spend their money gambling or drinking and
    never think of the old folk at home until it is too late. They never think
    of the old people, alone, perhaps, in a desolate hut on a worked-out farm
    in the scrub.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim Bullock squirmed again. He had gone out back last season and made a
    cheque, and lost most of it on horse-racing and cards.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They never think&mdash;they cannot think how, perhaps, long years
    agone in the old days, the old father, as a young man, and his brave young
    wife, came out here and buried themselves in the lonely bush and toiled for
    many years, trying&mdash;it does not matter whether they failed or not&mdash;trying
    to make homes for their children; toiled till the young man was bowed and
    grey, and the young wife brown and wrinkled and worn out. Exiles they were
    in the early days&mdash;boy-husbands and girl-wives some of them, who left
    their native lands, who left all that was dear, that seemed beautiful, that
    seemed to make life worth living, and sacrificed their young lives in drought
    and utter loneliness to make homes for their children. I want you young men
    to think of this. Some of them came from England, Ireland, Bonnie Scotland.&rdquo; Ross
    straightened up and let his hands fall loosely on his knees. &ldquo;Some
    from Europe&mdash;your foreign fathers&mdash;some from across the Rhine in
    Germany.&rdquo; We looked at old Kurtz. He seemed affected.</p>
  <p>Then Peter paused for a moment and blinked thoughtfully at Ross, then he
    took a drink of water. I can see now that the whole thing was a battle between
    Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan and Robert Ross&mdash;Scot met Scot. &ldquo;It seemed
    to me,&rdquo; Jim Bullock said afterwards, &ldquo;that Peter was only tryin&rsquo; to
    make some of us blanky well blubber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And there are men,&rdquo; Peter went on, &ldquo;who have struggled
    and suffered and failed, and who have fought and failed again till their
    tempers are spoiled, until they grow bitter. They go in for self-pity, and
    self-pity leads to moping and brooding and madness; self-pity is the most
    selfish and useless thing on the face of God&rsquo;s earth. It is cruel,
    it is deadly, both to the man and to those who love him, and whom he ought
    to love. His load grows heavier daily in his imagination, and he sinks down
    until it is in him to curse God and die. He ceases to care for or to think
    of his children who are working to help him.&rdquo; (Ross&rsquo;s sons were
    good, steady, hard-working boys.) &ldquo;Or the brave wife who has been so
    true to him for many hard years, who left home and friends and country for
    his sake. Who bears up in the blackest of times, and persists in looking
    at the bright side of things for his sake; who has suffered more than he
    if he only knew it, and suffers now, through him and because of him, but
    who is patient and bright and cheerful while her heart is breaking. He thinks
    she does not suffer, that she cannot suffer as a man does. My God! he doesn&rsquo;t
    know. He has forgotten in her the bright, fresh-faced, loving lassie he loved
    and won long years agone&mdash;long years agone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a sob, like the sob of an over-ridden horse as it sinks down broken-hearted,
    and Ross&rsquo;s arms went out on the desk in front of him, and his head
    went down on them. He was beaten.</p>
  <p>He was steered out gently with his wife on one side of him and his eldest
    son on the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, my friends,&rdquo; said Peter, standing by
    the water-bag with one hand on the tap and the pannikin in the other. &ldquo;Mr
    Ross has not been well lately, and the heat has been too much for him.&rdquo; And
    he went out after Ross. They took him round under the bush shed behind the
    hut, where it was cooler.</p>
  <p>When Peter came back to his place he seemed to have changed his whole manner
    and tone. &ldquo;Our friend, Mr Ross, is much better,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
    will now sing&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced at Clara Southwick at the harmonium&mdash;&ldquo;we
    will now sing  &lsquo;Shall We Gather at the River?&rsquo;&rdquo; We all
    knew that hymn; it was an old favourite round there, and Clara Southwick
    played it well in spite of the harmonium.</p>
  <p>And Peter sang&mdash;the first and last time I ever heard him sing. I never
    had an ear for music; but I never before nor since heard a man&rsquo;s voice
    that stirred me as Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan&rsquo;s. We stood like emus, listening
    to him all through one verse, then we pulled ourselves together.</p>
  <p class="note">Shall we gather at the River,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where bright angels&rsquo; feet have trod&mdash;</p>
  <p>The only rivers round there were barren creeks, the best of them only strings
    of muddy waterholes, and across the ridge, on the sheep-runs, the creeks
    were dry gutters, with baked banks and beds, and perhaps a mudhole every
    mile or so, and dead beasts rotting and stinking every few yards.</p>
  <p class="note">Gather with the saints at the River,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flows by the throne of God.</p>
  <p>Peter&rsquo;s voice trembled and broke. He caught his breath, and his eyes
    filled. But he smiled then&mdash;he stood smiling at us through his tears.</p>
  <p class="note">The beautiful, the beautiful River, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flows by
    the throne of God.</p>
  <p>Outside I saw women kiss each other who had been at daggers drawn ever since
    I could remember, and men shake hands silently who had hated each other for
    years. Every family wanted Peter to come home to tea, but he went across
    to Ross&rsquo;s, and afterwards down to Kurtz&rsquo;s place, and bled and
    inoculated six cows or so in a new way, and after tea he rode off over the
    gap to see his friend.</p>

Christ of the Never.</i></p>
  <p>I&nbsp;told&nbsp;you about Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan, the bush missionary,
    and how he preached in the little slab-and-bark school-house in the scrub
    on Ross&rsquo;s Creek that blazing hot Sunday afternoon long ago, when the
    drought was ruining the brave farmers all round there and breaking their
    hearts. And how hard old Ross, the selector, broke down at the end of the
    sermon, and blubbered, and had to be taken out of church.</p>
  <p>I left home and drifted to Sydney, and &ldquo;back into the Great North-West
    where all the rovers go,&rdquo; and knocked about the country for six or
    seven years before I met Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan again. I was young yet, but
    felt old at times, and there were times, in the hot, rough, greasy shearing-shed
    on blazing days, or in the bare &ldquo;men&rsquo;s hut&rdquo; by the flicker
    of the stinking slushlamp at night, or the wretched wayside shanty with its
    drinkmadness and blasphemy, or tramping along the dusty, endless track&mdash;there
    were times when I wished I could fall back with all the experience I&rsquo;d
    got, and sit once more in the little slab-and-bark &ldquo;chapel&rdquo; on
    Ross&rsquo;s Creek and hear Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan and the poor, struggling
    selectors sing &ldquo;Shall We Gather at the River?&rdquo; and then go out
    and start life afresh.</p>
  <p>My old school chum and bush mate, Jack Barnes, had married pretty little
    Clara Southwick, who used to play the portable harmonium in chapel. I nearly
    broke my heart when they were married, but then I was a young fool. Clara
    was a year or so older than I, and I could never get away from a boyish feeling
    of reverence for her, as if she were something above and out of my world.
    And so, while I was worshipping her in chapel once a month, and at picnics
    and parties in between, and always at a distance, Jack used to ride up to
    Southwick&rsquo;s place on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, and on other days,
    and hang his horse up outside, or turn it in the paddock, and argue with
    old Southwick, and agree with the old woman, and court Clara on the sly.
    And he got her.</p>
  <p>It was at their wedding that I first got the worse for drink.</p>
  <p>Jack was a blue-eyed, curly black-haired, careless, popular young scamp;
    as good-hearted as he was careless. He could ride like a circus monkey, do
    all kinds of bush work, add two columns of figures at once, and write like
    copper-plate.</p>
  <p>Jack was given to drinking, gambling and roving. He steadied up when he
    got married and started on a small selection of his own; but within the year
    Clara was living in a back skillion of her father&rsquo;s house and Jack
    was up-country shearing. He was &ldquo;ringer&rdquo; of the shed at Piora
    Station one season and made a decent cheque; and within a fortnight after
    the shed &ldquo;cut out&rdquo; he turned up at home in a very bad state from
    drink and with about thirty shillings in his pockets. He had fallen from
    his horse in the creek near Southwick&rsquo;s, and altogether he was a nice
    sort of young husband to go home to poor, heart-broken Clara.</p>
  <p>I remember that time well. She stopped me one day as I was riding past to
    ask me if I&rsquo;d seen Jack, and I got off my horse. Her chin and mouth
    began to twitch and tremble and I saw her eyes filling with tears. She laid
    her hand on my arm and asked me to promise not to drink with Jack if I met
    him, but to try and persuade him to come home. And&mdash;well, have you,
    as a man, ever, with the one woman that you can&rsquo;t have, and no matter
    at what time or place, felt a sudden mad longing to take her in your arms
    and kiss her&mdash;and damn the world? I got on my horse again. She must
    have thought me an ignorant brute, but I felt safer there. And when I thought
    how I had nearly made a fool of myself, and been a cowardly brute, and a
    rotten mate to my mate, I rode ten miles to find Jack and get him home.</p>
  <p>He straightened up again after a bit and went out and got another shed,
    and they say that Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan got hold of him there. I don&rsquo;t
    know what Peter did to him then&mdash;Jack never spoke of it, even to me,
    his old mate; but, anyway, at the end of the shearing season Jack&rsquo;s
    cheque came home to Clara in a registered envelope, addressed in Peter&rsquo;s
    hand-writing, and about a week later Jack turned up a changed man.</p>
  <p>He got work as a temporary clerk in the branch government land office at
    Solong, a pretty little farming town in a circle of blue hills on the banks
    of a clear, willow-fringed river, where there were rich, black-soil, river-flat
    farms, and vineyards on the red soil slopes, and blue peaks in the distance.
    It was a great contrast to Ross&rsquo;s Creek. Jack paid a deposit on an
    allotment of land, a bit out of town, on the river bank, and built a little
    weather-board box of a cottage in spare times, and planted roses and grape-vines
    to hide its ugliness by and by. It wasn&rsquo;t much of a place, but Clara
    was mighty proud of it because it was &ldquo;our house.&rdquo; They were
    very happy, and she was beginning to feel sure of Jack. She seemed to believe
    that the miserable old time was all past and gone.</p>
  <p>When the work at the land&rsquo;s office gave out, Jack did all sorts of
    jobs about town, and at last, one shearing season, when there was a heavy
    clip of wool, and shearers were getting &pound;1. a hundred, he decided to
    go out back. I know that Clara was against it, but he argued that it was
    the only chance for him, and she persuaded herself that she could trust him.
    I was knocking about Solong at the time, and Jack and I decided to go out
    together and share his packhorse between us. He wrote to Beenaway Shed, about
    three hundred miles north-west in the Great Scrubs, and got pens for both
    of us.</p>
  <p>It was a fine fresh morning when we started; it was in a good season and
    the country looked grand. When I rode up to Jack&rsquo;s place I saw his
    horse and packhorse tied up outside the gate. He had wanted me to come up
    the evening before and have tea with them and camp at his place for the night. &ldquo;Come
    up! man alive!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo; We&rsquo;ll make you a shake-down!&rdquo; But
    I wouldn&rsquo;t; I said I had to meet a chap. Jack wouldn&rsquo;t have understood.
    I had been up before, but when I saw him and Clara so happy and comfortable,
    and thought of the past and my secret, and thought of myself, a useless,
    purposeless, restless, homeless sort of fellow, hanging out at a boarding-house,
    it nearly broke me up, and I had to have a drink or two afterwards. I often
    wonder if Clara guessed and understood. You never know how much a woman knows;
    but&mdash;ah, well!</p>
  <p>Jack had taken my things home with him and he and Clara had packed them.
    I found afterwards that she had washed, dried and ironed some collars and
    handkerchiefs of mine during the night. Clara and Jack came out to the gate,
    and as I wouldn&rsquo;t go in to have a cup of tea there was nothing for
    it but to say good-bye. She was dressed in a fresh-looking print blouse and
    dark skirt, and wore a white hood that fell back from her head; she was a
    little girl, with sweet, small, freckled features, and red-gold hair, and
    kind, sympathetic grey eyes. I thought her the freshest, and fairest, and
    daintiest little woman in the district.</p>
  <p>I was Jack&rsquo;s mate, so she always treated me as a sort of brother-in-law,
    and called me by my Christian name. Mates are closer than brothers in the
    bush.</p>
  <p>I turned my back and pretended to tighten the straps and girths on the packhorse
    while she said good-bye to Jack. I heard her speaking earnestly to him, and
    once I heard her mention Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan&rsquo;s name. I thought Jack
    answered rather impatiently. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Clara,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all over&mdash;past and gone. I wish you would
    believe it. You promised never to speak of that any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I know how it was. Jack never cared to hear about Peter; he was too ashamed
    of the past, perhaps; besides, deep down, we feel a sort of resentment towards
    any reference to a man who has helped or saved us in the past. It&rsquo;s
    human nature.</p>
  <p>Then they spoke in low tones for a while, and then Jack laughed, and kissed
    her, and said, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be back before the time&rsquo;s up.&rdquo; Then
    he ran into the house to say good-bye to Mary&rsquo;s sister, who was staying
    with her, and who was laid up with a sprained ankle.</p>
  <p>Then Clara stepped up to me and laid her fingers on my shoulder. I trembled
    from head to foot and hoped she didn&rsquo;t notice it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; she said, looking at me with her big, searching grey
    eyes,  &ldquo;I believe I can trust you. I want you to look after Jack. You
    know why. Never let him have one drink if you can help it. One drink&mdash;the
    first drink will do it. I want you to promise me that you will never have
    a drink with Jack, no matter what happens or what he says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never will,&rdquo; I said, and I meant it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time he&rsquo;s been away from me since he gave
    up drinking, and if he comes back all right this time I will be sure of him
    and contented. But, Joe, if he comes back wrong it will kill me; it will
    break my heart. I want you to promise that if anything happens you will ride
    or wire for Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan. I hear he&rsquo;s wool-sorting this year
    at Beenaway Station. Promise me that if anything happens you will ride for
    Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan and tell him, no matter what Jack says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>She half-held out her hand to me, but I kept both mine behind my back. I
    suppose she thought I didn&rsquo;t notice that she wanted to shake hands
    on the bargain; but the truth was that my hands shook so, and I didn&rsquo;t
    want her to notice&nbsp;<i>that</i>.</p>
  <p>I got on my horse and felt steadier. Then, &ldquo;Good-bye, Clara  &ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Good-bye,
    Jack.&rdquo; She bore up bravely, but I saw her eyes brimming. Jack got on
    his horse, and I bent over and shook hands with her. Jack bent down and kissed
    her while she stood on tiptoe. &ldquo;Good-bye, little woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Cheer
    up, and I&rsquo;ll be back before you know where you are! You mustn&rsquo;t
    fret&mdash;you know why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Jack!&rdquo;&mdash;she was breaking down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Jack!&rdquo; I said, and we rode off, turning and waving
    our hats to her as she stood by the gate, looking a desolate little thing,
    I thought, till we turned down a bend of the road into the river.</p>
  <p>As we jogged along with the packhorse trotting behind us, and the quart-pots
    and hobble-chains jingling on the pack saddle, I pictured Clara running inside,
    to cry a while in her sister&rsquo;s arms, and then to bustle round and cheer
    up, for Jack&rsquo;s sake&mdash;and for the sake of something else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll christen him after you, Joe,&rdquo; said Jack, later on,
    when we&rsquo;d got confidential over our pipes after tea in our first camp.
    It never seemed to enter his head that there was the ghost of a chance that
    it might be a girl.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he didn&rsquo;t come along when
    I was drinking,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>And as we lay rolled in our blankets under the stars I swore a big oath
    to myself.</p>
  <p>We got along comfortably and reached Beenaway Station in about a week, the
    day before the shearers&rsquo; roll-call. Jack never showed the slightest
    inclination to go into a shanty; and several times we talked about old times
    and what damned fools we&rsquo;d been throwing away our money over shanty
    bars shouting for loafers and cadgers. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this ever so much
    better, Joe?&rdquo; said Jack, as we lay on our blankets smoking one moonlight
    night. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in boozing, Joe, you can take it from
    me. Just you sling it for a year and then look back; you won&rsquo;t want
    to touch it again. You&rsquo;ve been straight for a couple of months. Sling
    it for good, Joe, before it gets a hold on you, like it did on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>It was the morning after cut-out at Beenaway Shed, and we were glad. We
    were tired of the rush and roar and rattle and heat and grease and blasphemy
    of the big, hot, iron machine shed in that dusty patch in the barren scrubs.
    Swags were rolled up, saddle-bags packed, horses had been rounded up and
    driven in, the shearers&rsquo; cook and his mate had had their fight, and
    about a hundred men&mdash;shearers, rouseabouts, and wool-washers&mdash;were
    waiting round the little iron office to get their cheques.</p>
  <p>We were about half through when one bushman said to another: &ldquo;Stop
    your damned swearin&rsquo;, Jim. Here&rsquo;s Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan!&rdquo; Peter
    walked up and the men made way for him and he went into the office. There
    was always considerably less swearing for a few feet round about where Peter
    M&lsquo;Laughlan happened to be working in a shearing-shed. It seemed to
    be an understood thing with the men. He took no advantages, never volunteered
    to preach at a shed where he was working, and only spoke on union subjects
    when the men asked him to. He was  &ldquo;rep.&rdquo; (Shearers&rsquo; Union
    representative) at this shed, but squatters and station managers respected
    him as much as the men did.</p>
  <p>He seemed much greyer now, but still stood square and straight. And his
    eyes still looked one through.</p>
  <p>When Peter came out and the crowd had cleared away he took Jack aside and
    spoke to him in a low voice for a few minutes. I heard Jack say, &ldquo;Oh,
    that&rsquo;s all right, Peter! You have my word for it,&rdquo; and he got
    on his horse. I heard Peter say the one word, &ldquo;Remember!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,
    that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Jack, and he shook hands with Peter,
    shouted, &ldquo;Come on, Joe!&rdquo; and started off with the packhorse after
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;wish I were going down with you, Joe.&rdquo;  said
    Peter to me, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t get away till to-morrow. I&rsquo;ve
    got that sick rouseabout on my hands, and I&rsquo;ll have to see him fixed
    up somehow and started off to the hospital&rdquo; (the nearest was a hundred
    miles away). &ldquo;And, by the way, I&rsquo;ve taken up a collection for
    him; I want a few shillings from you, Joe. I nearly forgot you. The poor
    fellow only got in about a fortnight&rsquo;s work, and there&rsquo;s a wife
    and youngsters in Sydney. I&rsquo;ll be down after you to-morrow. I promised
    to go to Comesomehow (there is a postal town in New South Wales called  &ldquo;Come-by-Chance&rdquo;)
    and get the people together and start an agitation for a half-time school
    there. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll be there by the end of the week. Good-bye, Joe.
    I must get some more money for the rouser from some of those chaps before
    they start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Comesomehow was a wretched cockatoo settlement, a bit off the track, about
    one hundred and fifty miles on our road home, where the settlers lived like
    savages and the children ran wild. I reckoned that Peter would have his work
    cut out to start a craving for education in that place.</p>
  <p>By saying he&rsquo;d be there I think he intended to give me a hint, in
    case anything happened. I believe now that Jack&rsquo;s wife had got anxious
    and had written to him.</p>
  <p>We jogged along comfortably and happily for three or four days, and as we
    passed shanty after shanty, and town after town, without Jack showing the
    slightest inclination to pull up at any of them, I began to feel safe about
    him.</p>
  <p>Then it happened, in the simplest way, as most things of this sort happen
    if you don&rsquo;t watch close.</p>
  <p>The third night it rained, rained heavens-hard, and rainy nights can be
    mighty cold out on those plains, even in mid-summer. Jack and I rigged up
    a strip of waterproof stuff we had to cover the swags on the packhorse, but
    the rain drove in, almost horizontally, and we got wet through, blankets,
    clothes and all. Jack got a bad cold and coughed fit to break himself; so
    about daylight, when the rain held up a bit, we packed up and rode on to
    the next pub, a wretched little weather board place in the scrub.</p>
  <p>Jack reckoned he&rsquo;d get some stuff for his cold there. I didn&rsquo;t
    like to speak, but before we reached the place I said, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t
    touch a drink, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m a blanky fool?&rdquo; said Jack, and I shut
    up.</p>
  <p>The shanty was kept by a man who went by the name of Thomas, a notorious
    lamber-down (a shanty-keeper who entices cheque-men to drink), as I found
    out afterwards. He was a big, awkward bullock of a man, a selfish, ignorant
    brute, as anyone might have seen by his face; but he had a loud voice, and
    adopted a careless, rollicking, hail-fellow-well-met! come-in-and-sit-down-man-alive!
    clap-you-on-the-back style, which deceived a good many, or which a good many
    pretended to believe in. His &ldquo;missus&rdquo; was an animal of his own
    species, but she was duller and didn&rsquo;t bellow.</p>
  <p>He had a rather good-looking girl there&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know whether
    she was his daughter or not. They said that when he saw the shearers coming
    he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Run and titivate yourself, Mary; here comes the shearers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But what surprised me was that Jack Barnes didn&rsquo;t seem able to see
    through Thomas; he thought that he was all right, &ldquo;a bit of a rough
    diamond.&rdquo;  There are any amount of scoundrels and swindlers knocking
    about the world disguised as rough diamonds.</p>
  <p>Jack had a fit of coughing when we came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Jack!&rdquo; bellowed Thomas, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a regular
    churchyarder you&rsquo;ve got. Go in to the kitchen fire and I&rsquo;ll mix
    you a stiff toddy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Thomas,&rdquo; said Jack, glancing at me rather sheepishly,
    I thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a hot cup of coffee presently, that&rsquo;ll
    do me more good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, man alive, one drink won&rsquo;t hurt you!&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;I
    know you&rsquo;re on the straight, and you know I&rsquo;m the last man that &rsquo;ud
    try to get you off it. But you want something for that cold. You don&rsquo;t
    want to die on the track, do you? What would your missus say? That cough
    of yours is enough to bust a bullock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack isn&rsquo;t drinking, Thomas,&rdquo; I said rather shortly, &ldquo;and
    neither am I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a cup of coffee at breakfast,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;thank
    you all the same, Thomas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right you are, Jack!&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; he roared
    at the girl,  &ldquo;chuck yerself about and get breakfast, and make a strong
    cup of coffee; and I say, missus&rdquo; (to his wife), &ldquo;git some honey
    and vinegar in a cup, will yer? or see if there&rsquo;s any of that cough
    stuff left in the bottle. Go into the kitchen, you chaps, and dry yourselves
    at the fire, you&rsquo;re wringing wet.&rdquo; Jack went through into the
    kitchen.</p>
  <p>I stepped out to see if the horses were all right, and as I came in again
    through the bar, Thomas, who had slipped behind the counter, crooked his
    finger at me and poured out a stiff whisky. &ldquo;I thought you might like
    to have it on the quiet,&rdquo; he whispered, with a wink.</p>
  <p>Now, there was this difference between Jack and me. When I was on the track,
    and healthy and contented, I could take a drink, or two drinks, and then
    leave it; or at other times I could drink all day, or all night, and be as
    happy as a lord, and be mighty sick and repentant all next day, and then
    not touch drink for a week; but if Jack once started, he was a lost man for
    days, for weeks, for months&mdash;as long as his cash or credit lasted. I
    felt a cold coming on me this morning, and wanted a whisky, so I had a drink
    with Thomas. Then, of course, I shouted in my turn, keeping an eye out in
    case Jack should come in. I went into the kitchen and steamed with Jack for
    a while in front of a big log fire, taking care to keep my breath away from
    him. Then we went in to breakfast. Those two drinks were all I meant to have,
    and we were going right on after breakfast.</p>
  <p>It was a good breakfast, ham and eggs, and we enjoyed it. The two whiskies
    had got to work. I hadn&rsquo;t touched drink for a long time. I shouldn&rsquo;t
    like to say that Thomas put anything in the drink he gave me. Before we started
    breakfast he put a glass down in front of me and said</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good ginger-ale, it will warm you up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I tasted it; it was rum, hot. I said nothing. What could I say?</p>
  <p>There was some joke about Jack being married and settled and steadied down,
    and me, his old mate, still on the wallaby; and Mrs Thomas said that I ought
    to follow Jack&rsquo;s example. And just then I felt a touch of that loneliness
    that some men feel when an old drinking mate turns teetotaller.</p>
  <p>Jack started coughing again, like an old cow with the pleuro.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That cough will kill you, Jack.&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
    put a drop of brandy in your coffee,&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;won&rsquo;t start
    you, anyhow; it&rsquo;s real &lsquo;Three Star.&rsquo; &ldquo; And he reached
    a bottle from the side-table.</p>
  <p>I should have stood up then, for my manhood, for my mate, and for little
    Clara, but I half rose from my chair, and Jack laughed and said, &ldquo;Sit
    down, Joe, you old fool, you&rsquo;re tanked. I know all about your seeing
    about the horses and your ginger ales. It&rsquo;s all right, old man. Do
    you think I&rsquo;m going on the booze? Why, I&rsquo;ll have to hold you
    on the horse all day.&rdquo; I sat down and took up my glass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck, Joe!&rdquo; said Jack, laughing, and lifting up
    his cup of coffee with the brandy in it. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then suddenly, and as clearly as I ever heard it, came Clara&rsquo;s voice
    to my ear: &ldquo;Promise me, whatever you do, that you will never have a
    drink with Jack.&rdquo; And I felt cold and sick to the stomach.</p>
  <p>I got up and went out. They thought that the drink had made me sick, but
    if I&rsquo;d stayed there another minute I would have tackled Thomas; and
    I knew that I needed a clear head to tackle a bullock like him. I walked
    about a bit, and when I came in again Jack and Thomas were in the bar, and
    Jack had a glass before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Joe, you old bounder,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;come and
    have a whisky-and-soda; it will straighten you up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re drinking, Jack?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be a fool!&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;One drink won&rsquo;t
    hurt me. Do you think I&rsquo;m going on the booze? Have a soda and straighten
    up; we must make a start directly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I remember we had two or three whiskies, and then suddenly I tackled Thomas,
    and Jack was holding me back, and laughing and swearing at me at the same
    time, and I had a tussle with him; and then I was suddenly calmer and sensible,
    and we were shaking hands all round, and Jack was talking about just one
    more spree for the sake of old times.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bit of a booze won&rsquo;t hurt me. Joe, you old fool,&rdquo; he
    said.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have one more night of it, for the sake of Auld
    Lang Syne, and start at daylight in the morning. You go and see to the horses,
    it will straighten you up. Take the saddle off and hobble &rsquo;em out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But I insisted on starting at once, and Jack promised he would. We were
    gloriously happy for an hour or so, and then I went to sleep.</p>
  <p>When I woke it was late in the afternoon. I was very giddy and shaky; the
    girl brought me a whisky-and-soda, and that steadied me. Some more shearers
    had arrived, and Jack was playing cards with two of them on top of a cask
    in the bar. Thomas was dead drunk on the floor, or pretending to be so, and
    his wife was behind the bar. I went out to see to the horses; I found them
    in a bush yard at the back. The packhorse was rolling in the mud with the
    pack-saddle and saddlebags on. One of the chaps helped me take off the saddles
    and put them in the harness-room behind the kitchen.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ll pass over that night. It wouldn&rsquo;t be very edifying to the
    great, steady-living, sober majority, and the others, the ne&rsquo;er-do-wells,
    the rovers, wrecks and failures, will understand only too well without being
    told&mdash;only too well, God help them!</p>
  <p>When I woke in the morning I couldn&rsquo;t have touched a drink to save
    my life. I was fearfully shaky, and swimming about the head, but I put my
    head over a tub under the pump and got the girl to pump for a while, and
    then I drank a pint of tea and managed to keep it down, and felt better.</p>
  <p>All through the last half of the night I&rsquo;d kept saying, in a sort
    of drink nightmare, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan in the
    morning. I&rsquo;ll go for Peter as soon as I can stand! &ldquo; and repeating
    Clara Barnes&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Ride for Peter if anything happens. Ride
    for Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were drunken shearers, horsemen and swagmen sleeping all over the
    place, and in all sorts of odd positions; some on the veranda with their
    heads on their swags, one sitting back against the wall, and one on the broad
    of his back with his head on the bare boards and his mouth open. There was
    another horse rolling in its saddle, and I took the saddle off. The horse
    belonged to an English University man.</p>
  <p>I went in to see how Jack was. He was lying in the parlour on a little,
    worn-out, horse-hair sofa, that might have seen better days in some clean
    home in the woman-and-girl world. He had been drinking and playing cards
    till early that morning, and he looked awful&mdash;he looked as if he&rsquo;d
    been boozing for a month.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See what you&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo; he said, sitting up and glaring
    at me; then he said, &ldquo;Bring me a whisky-and-soda, Joe, for God&rsquo;s
    sake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I got a whisky-and-soda from the girl and took it to him.</p>
  <p>I talked to him for a while, and at last he said, &ldquo;Well, go and get
    the horses and we&rsquo;ll start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I got the horses ready and brought them round to the front, but by that
    time he&rsquo;d had more drink, and he said he wanted to sleep before he
    started. Next he was playing cards with one of the chaps, and asked me to
    wait till he&rsquo;d finished that game. I knew he&rsquo;d keep promising
    and humbugging me till there was a row, so at last I got him aside and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Jack, I&rsquo;m going for Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
  <p>I put the other horses back in the yard, the saddles in the skillion, got
    on my horse and rode off. Thomas and the others asked me no questions, they
    took no notice. In a place like that a man could almost do anything, short
    of hanging himself, without anyone interfering or being surprised. And probably,
    if he did hang himself, they&rsquo;d let him swing for a while to get a taste
    of it.</p>
  <p>Comesomehow was about fifteen miles back on a track off the main road. I
    reckoned that I could find Peter and bring him on by the afternoon, and I
    rode hard, sick as I was. I was too sick to smoke.</p>
  <p>As it happened, Peter had started early from his last camp and I caught
    him just as he was turning off into Comesomehow track.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Joe?&rdquo; he asked as I rode up to him&mdash;but
    he could see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack Barnes is on the booze at Thomas&rsquo;s,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>Peter just looked right through me. Then he turned his horse&rsquo;s head
    without a word, and rode back with me. And, after a while, he said, as if
    to himself:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Clara! Poor little lassie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By the time we reached the shanty it was well on in the afternoon. A fight
    was stopped in the first round and voices lowered when the chaps caught sight
    of us. As Peter walked into the bar one or two drunks straightened themselves
    and took off their hats with drunken sentiment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Jack Barnes, Thomas?&rdquo; asked Peter, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in there if you want to see him,&rdquo; said Thomas, jerking
    his head towards the parlour.</p>
  <p>We went in, and when Peter saw Jack lying there I noticed that swift, haunted
    look came into his eyes, as if he&rsquo;d seen a ghost of the past.</p>
  <p>He sat down by the sofa to wait until Jack woke. I thought as he sat there
    that his eyes were like a woman&rsquo;s for sympathy and like a dog&rsquo;s
    for faithfulness. I was very shaky.</p>
  <p>Presently Thomas looked in. &ldquo;Is there anything I can do for you, M&lsquo;Laughlan?&rdquo; he
    asked in as civil a tone as he could get to.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;bring me a flask of your best whisky&mdash;your
    own, mind&mdash;and a glass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We shall need the whisky for him on the track, Joe,&rdquo; said Peter,
    when the flask came. &ldquo;Get another glass and a bottle of soda; you want
    a nip.&rdquo;  He poured out a drink for himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first thing we&rsquo;ve got to do is to get him away; then I&rsquo;ll
    soon put him on his feet. But we&rsquo;ll let him sleep a while longer. I
    find I&rsquo;ve got business near Solong, and I&rsquo;m going down with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By and by Jack woke up and glared round, and when he caught sight of Peter
    he just reached for his hands and said, &ldquo;Peter! Thank God you&rsquo;ve
    come!&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;But I must have a drink first, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Jack, you shall have a drink,&rdquo; said Peter; and he
    gave him a stiff nobbler. It steadied Jack a bit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now listen to me, Jack,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;How much money
    have you got left?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    got a cheque for twenty pounds here, sewn inside my shirt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but you drew thirty-six in three cheques. Where&rsquo;s the
    rest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thomas has ten,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;and the six-well, the six
    is gone. I was playing cards last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter stepped out into the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Thomas,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got
    a ten-pound cheque from Barnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, how much of it does he owe you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The whole, and more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that? He has only been here since yesterday
    morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but he&rsquo;s been shoutin&rsquo; all round. Look at all these
    chaps here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They only came yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;Here,
    you had best take this and give me the cheque;&rdquo; and Peter laid a five-pound
    note on the bar. Thomas bucked at first, but in the end he handed over the
    cheque&mdash;he had had several warnings from the police. Then he suddenly
    lost all control over himself; he came round from behind the bar and faced
    Peter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, you mongrel parson!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What the &mdash;&mdash; do
    you mean by coming into my bar and interfering with me. Who the &mdash;&mdash; are
    you anyway? A &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; He used the worst oaths that were used
    in the bush. &ldquo;Take off &mdash;&mdash; your coat!&rdquo; he roared at
    last, shaping up to Peter.</p>
  <p>Peter stepped back a pace and buttoned his coat and threw back his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No need to take off my coat, Thomas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am
    ready.&rdquo; He said it very quietly, but there was a danger-signal&mdash;a
    red light in his eyes. He was quiet-voiced but hard-knuckled, as some had
    reason to know.</p>
  <p>Thomas balked like a bull at a spread umbrella. Jack lurched past me as
    I stood in the parlour door, but I caught him and held him back; and almost
    at the same moment a wretched old boozer that we called &ldquo;Awful Example,&rdquo;  who
    had been sitting huddled, a dirty bundle of rags and beard and hair, in the
    corner of the bar, struggled to his feet, staggered forward and faced Thomas,
    looking once again like something that might have been a man. He snatched
    a thick glass bottle from the counter and held it by the neck in his right
    hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand back, Thomas!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Lay a hand&mdash;lay
    a finger on Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan, and I&rsquo;ll smash your head, as sure
    as there&rsquo;s a God above us and I&rsquo;m a ruined man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter took &ldquo;Awful&rdquo; gently by the shoulders and sat him down. &ldquo;You
    keep quiet, old man,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;nothing is going to happen.&rdquo; Thomas
    went round behind the bar muttering something about it not being worth his
    while to, etc.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You go and get the horses ready, Joe,&rdquo; said Peter to me; &ldquo;and
    you sit down, Jack, and keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He can get the horses,&rdquo; growled Thomas, from behind the bar, &ldquo;but
    I&rsquo;m damned if he gets the saddles. I&rsquo;ve got them locked up, and
    I&rsquo;ll something well keep them till Barnes is sober enough to pay me
    what he owes me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just then a tall, good-looking chap, with dark-blue eyes and a long, light-coloured
    moustache, stepped into the bar from the crowd on the veranda.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this, Thomas?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got to do with you, Gentleman Once?&rdquo; shouted
    Thomas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s got something to do with me,&rdquo; said Gentleman
    Once.  &ldquo;Now, look here, Thomas; you can do pretty well what you like
    with us poor devils, and you know it, but we draw the line at Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan.
    If you really itch for the thrashing you deserve you must tempt someone else
    to give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the &mdash;&mdash; are you talking about?&rdquo; snorted Thomas. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    drunk or ratty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, M&lsquo;Laughlan?&rdquo; asked Gentleman
    Once, turning to Peter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No trouble at all, Gentleman Once,&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;thank
    you all the same. I&rsquo;ve managed worse men than our friend Thomas. Now,
    Thomas, don&rsquo;t you think it would pay you best to hand over the key
    of the harness-room and have done with this nonsense? I&rsquo;m a patient
    man&mdash;a very patient man&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve not always been so, and
    the old blood comes up sometimes, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thomas couldn&rsquo;t stand this sort of language, because he couldn&rsquo;t
    understand it. He threw the key on the bar and told us to clear out.</p>
  <p>We were all three very quiet riding along the track that evening. Peter
    gave Jack a nip now and again from the flask, and before we turned in in
    camp he gave him what he called a soothing draught from a little medicine
    chest that he carried in his saddle-bag. Jack seemed to have got rid of his
    cough; he slept all night, and in the morning, after he&rsquo;d drunk a pint
    of mutton-broth that Peter had made in one of the billies, he was all right&mdash;except
    that he was quiet and ashamed. I had never known him to be so quiet, and
    for such a length of time, since we were boys together. He had learned his
    own weakness; he&rsquo;d lost all his cocksureness. I know now just exactly
    how he felt. He felt as if his sober year had been lost and he would have
    to live it all over again.</p>
  <p>Peter didn&rsquo;t preach. He just jogged along and camped with us as if
    he were an ordinary, every-day mate. He yarned about all sorts of things.
    He could tell good yarns, and when he was fairly on you could listen to him
    all night. He seemed to have been nearly all over the world. Peter never
    preached except when he was asked to hold service in some bush pub, station-homestead
    or bush church. But in a case like ours he had a way of telling a little
    life story, with something in it that hit the young man he wanted to reform,
    and hit him hard. He&rsquo;d generally begin quietly, when we were comfortable
    with our pipes in camp after tea, with &ldquo;I once knew a young man&mdash;&rdquo; or &ldquo;That
    reminds me of a young fellow I knew&mdash;&rdquo; and so on. You never knew
    when he was going to begin, or when he was going to hit you. In our last
    camp, before we reached Solong, he told two of his time-fuse yarns. I haven&rsquo;t
    time to tell them now, but one stuffed up my pipe for a while, and made Jack&rsquo;s
    hand tremble when he tried to light his. I&rsquo;m glad it was too dark to
    see our faces. We lay a good while afterwards, rolled in our blankets, and
    couldn&rsquo;t get to sleep for thinking; but Peter seemed to fall asleep
    as soon as he turned in.</p>
  <p>Next day he told Jack not to tell Clara that he&rsquo;d come down with us.
    He said he wouldn&rsquo;t go right into Solong with us; he was going back
    along another road to stay a day or two with an old friend of his.</p>
  <p>When we reached Solong we stopped on the river-bank just out of sight of
    Jack&rsquo;s house. Peter took the ten-pound cheque from his pocket and gave
    it to Jack. Jack hadn&rsquo;t seen Peter give the shanty-keeper the five-pound
    note.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I owed Thomas something,&rdquo; said Jack, staring. &ldquo;However
    did you manage to get the cheque out of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Jack, I managed,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
  <p>Jack sat silent for a while, then he began to breathe hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say nothing, Jack. Only promise me that you will give Clara the cheques
    as soon as you go home, and let her take care of the cash for a while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
  <p>Jack looked down at the ground for a while, then he lifted his head and
    looked Peter in the eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak. I&rsquo;m ashamed
    to make a promise; I&rsquo;ve broken so many. I&rsquo;ll try to thank you
    in a year&rsquo;s time from now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ask for no promises,&rdquo; said Peter, and he held out his hand.
    Jack gripped it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming home with me, Joe?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go into town. See you in the
    morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack rode on. When he got along a piece Peter left his horse and moved up
    to the head of the lane to watch Jack, and I followed. As Jack neared the
    cottage we saw a little figure in a cloak run out to the front gate. She
    had heard the horses and the jingle of the camp-ware on the pack-saddle.
    We saw Jack jump down and take her in his arms. I looked at Peter, and as
    he watched them, something, that might have been a strange look of the old
    days, came into his eyes.</p>
  <p>He shook hands with me. &ldquo;Good-bye, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rode across the river again. He took the track that ran along the foot
    of the spurs by the river, and up over a gap in the curve of blue hills,
    and down and out west towards the Big Scrubs. And as he rounded the last
    spur, with his packhorse trotting after him, I thought he must have felt
    very lonely. And I felt lonely too.</p>

    Who know it all too well.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<i>Out
      Back.</i></p>
  <p>Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan, bush missionary, Joe Wilson and his mate, Jack Barnes,
    shearers for the present, and a casual swagman named Jack Mitchell, were
    camped at Cox&rsquo;s Crossing in a bend of Eurunderee Creek.</p>
  <p>It was a grassy little flat with gum-trees standing clear and clean like
    a park. At the back was the steep grassy siding of a ridge, and far away
    across the creek to the south a spur from the Blue Mountain range ran west,
    with a tall, blue granite peak showing clear in the broad moonlight, yet
    dream-like and distant over the sweeps of dark green bush.</p>
  <p>There was the jingle of hobble-chains and a crunching at the grass where
    the horses moved in the soft shadows amongst the trees. Up the creek on the
    other side was a surveyors&rsquo; camp, and from there now and again came
    the sound of a good voice singing verses of old songs; and later on the sound
    of a violin and a cornet being played, sometimes together and sometimes each
    on its own.</p>
  <p>Wilson and Barnes were on their way home from shearing out back in the great
    scrubs at Beenaway Shed. They had been rescued by Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan
    from a wayside shanty where they had fallen, in spite of mutual oaths and
    past promises, sacred and profane, because they had got wringing wet in a
    storm on the track and caught colds, and had been tempted to take just one
    drink.</p>
  <p>They were in a bad way, and were knocking down their cheques beautifully
    when Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan came along. He rescued them and some of their
    cash from the soulless shantykeeper, and was riding home with them, on some
    pretence, because he had known them as boys, because Joe Wilson had a vein
    of poetry in him&mdash;a something in sympathy with something in Peter; because
    Jack Barnes had a dear little girl-wife who was much too good for him, and
    who was now anxiously waiting for him in the pretty little farming town of
    Solong amongst the western spurs. Because, perhaps, of something in Peter&rsquo;s
    early past which was a mystery. Simply and plainly because Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan
    was the kindest, straightest and truest man in the West&mdash;a &ldquo;white
    man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They all knew Mitchell and welcomed him heartily when he turned up in their
    camp, because he was a pathetic humorist and a kindly cynic&mdash;a &ldquo;joker&rdquo;  or &ldquo;hard
    case&rdquo; as the bushmen say.</p>
  <p>Peter was about fifty and the other three were young men.</p>
  <p>There was another man in camp who didn&rsquo;t count and was supposed to
    be dead. Old Danny Quinn, champion &ldquo;beer chewer&rdquo; of the district,
    was on his way out, after a spree, to one of Rouse&rsquo;s stations, where,
    for the sake of past services&mdash;long past&mdash;and because of old times,
    he was supposed to be working. He had spent his last penny a week before
    and had clung to his last-hope hotel until the landlord had taken him in
    one hand and his swag in the other and lifted them clear of the veranda.
    Danny had blundered on, this far, somehow; he was the last in the world who
    could have told how, and had managed to light a fire; then he lay with his
    head on his swag and enjoyed nips of whisky in judicious doses and at reasonable
    intervals, and later on a tot of mutton-broth, which he made in one of the
    billies.</p>
  <p>It was after tea. Peter sat on a log by the fire with Joe and Jack Mitchell
    on one side and Jack Barnes on the other. Jack Mitchell sat on the grass
    with his back to the log, his knees drawn up, and his arms abroad on them:
    his most comfortable position and one which seemed to favour the flow of
    his philosophy. They talked of bush things or reflected, sometimes all three
    together, sometimes by turns.</p>
  <p>From the surveyors&rsquo; camp,&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I remember, I remember,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house where I was born,<br>
    The little window where the sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came peeping in at morn&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The breeze from the west strengthened and the voice was blown away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That chap seems a bit sentimental but he&rsquo;s got a good voice,&rdquo;  said
    Mitchell. Then presently he remarked, round his pipe,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if old Danny remembers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And presently Peter said quietly, as if the thought had just occurred to
    him</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the way, Mitchell, I forgot to ask after your old folk. I knew
    your father, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re all right, Peter, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heard from them lately?&rdquo; asked Peter, presently, in a lazy
    tone.</p>
  <p>Mitchell straightened himself up. &ldquo;N&mdash;no. To tell the truth,
    Peter, I haven&rsquo;t written for&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter smoked reflectively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember your father well, Jack,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He was
    a big-hearted man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Danny was heard remonstrating loudly with spirits from a warmer clime
    than Australia, and Peter stepped over to soothe him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d get it, directly after I opened my mouth,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell. &ldquo;I suppose it will be your turn next, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Joe, resignedly. The wind fell.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I remember, I remember,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it gives me little joy,<br>
    To think I&rsquo;m further off from heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than when I was a boy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When Peter came back another thought seemed to have occurred to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your mother getting on, Joe?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;She
    shifted to Sydney after your father died, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s getting on all right!&rdquo; said Joe, without elaboration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keeping a boarding-house, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hard to make ends meet, I suppose?&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    almost a harder life than it could have been on the old selection, and there&rsquo;s
    none of the old independence about it. A woman like your mother must feel
    it, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s used
    to it by this time. I manage to send her a few pounds now and again. I send
    her all I can,&rdquo; he added resentfully.</p>
  <p>Peter sat corrected for a few moments. Then he seemed to change the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some time since you were in Sydney last, isn&rsquo;t it,
    Joe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Peter,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been there for
    two years. I never did any good there. I&rsquo;m far better knocking about
    out back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some men seem to get on better in one place, some in another,&rdquo;  reflected
    Mitchell, lazily. &ldquo;For my part, I seem to get on better in another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter blinked, relit his pipe with a stick from the fire and reflected.</p>
  <p>The surveyor&rsquo;s song had been encored:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I remember, I remember&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perhaps Peter remembered. Joe did, but there were no vines round the house
    where he was born, only drought and dust, and raspy voices raised in recrimination,
    and hardship most times.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Peter, quietly, &ldquo;I remember a young
    fellow at home in the old country. He had every advantage. He had a first-class
    education, a great deal more money than he needed&mdash;almost as much as
    he asked for, and nearly as much freedom as he wanted. His father was an
    English gentleman and his mother an English lady. They were titled people,
    if I remember rightly. The old man was proud, but fond of his son; he only
    asked him to pay a little duty or respect now and again. We don&rsquo;t understand
    these things in Australia&mdash;they seem formal and cold to us. The son
    paid his respects to his father occasionally&mdash;a week or so before he&rsquo;d
    be wanting money, as a rule. The mother was a dear lady. She idolized her
    son. She only asked for a little show of affection from him, a few days or
    a week of his society at home now and then&mdash;say once in three months.
    But he couldn&rsquo;t spare her even that&mdash;his time was taken up so
    much in fashionable London and Paris and other places. He would give the
    world to be able to take his proud, soft old father&rsquo;s hand now and
    look into his eyes as one man who understands another. He would be glad and
    eager to give his mother twelve months out of the year if he thought it would
    make her happier. It has been too late for more than twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Danny called for Peter.</p>
  <p>Mitchell jerked his head approvingly and gave a sound like a sigh and chuckle
    conjoined, the one qualifying the other. &ldquo;I told you you&rsquo;d get
    it, Joe,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it hits me,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it hit all the same, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it did,&rdquo; said Joe, after a short pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t have hit you so hard if you hadn&rsquo;t tried
    to parry,&rdquo;  reflected Mitchell. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn now, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack Barnes said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now I know that Peter would do anything for a woman or child, or
    an honest, straight, hard-up chap,&rdquo; said Mitchell, straightening out
    his legs and folding his arms, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t quite understand
    his being so partial to drunken scamps and vagabonds, black sheep and ne&rsquo;er-do-wells.
    He&rsquo;s got a tremendous sympathy for drunks. He&rsquo;d do anything to
    help a drunken man. Ain&rsquo;t it marvellous? It&rsquo;s my private opinion
    that Peter must have been an awful boozer and scamp in his time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The other two only thought. Mitchell was privileged. He was a young man
    of freckled, sandy complexion, and quizzical grey eyes. &ldquo;Sly Joker&rdquo;  &ldquo;could
    take a rise out of anyone on the quiet;&rdquo; &ldquo;You could never tell
    when he was getting at you;&rdquo; &ldquo;Face of a born comedian,&rdquo; as
    bushmen said of Mitchell. But he would probably have been a dead and dismal
    failure on any other stage than that of wide Australia.</p>
  <p>Peter came back and they sat and smoked, and maybe they reflected along
    four very different back-tracks for a while.</p>
  <p>The surveyor started to sing again:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I have heard the mavis singing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her love-song to the morn.<br>
    I have seen the dew-drop clinging<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the rose just newly born.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They smoked and listened in silence all through to the end. It was very
    still. The full moon was high. The long white slender branches of a box-tree
    stirred gently overhead; the she-oaks in the creek sighed as they are always
    sighing, and the southern peak seemed ever so far away.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;That has made me thine for ever!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonny Mary of Argyle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blarst my pipe!&rdquo; exclaimed Mitchell, suddenly. &ldquo;I beg
    your pardon, Peter. My pipe&rsquo;s always getting stuffed up,&rdquo; and
    he proceeded to shell out and clear his pipe.</p>
  <p>The breeze had changed and strengthened. They heard the violin playing &ldquo;Annie
    Laurie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They must be having a Scotch night in that camp tonight,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell. The voice came again:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Maxwelton Braes are bonny&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where early fa&rsquo;s the dew,<br>
    For &rsquo;twas there that Annie Laurie<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gie me her promise true&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell threw out his arm impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t play and sing those old songs,&rdquo; he
    said.  &ldquo;They make you think of damned old things. I beg your pardon,
    Peter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter sat leaning forward, his elbows resting on his knees and his hands
    fingering his cold pipe nervously. His sad eyes had grown haggard and haunted.
    It is in the hearts of exiles in new lands that the old songs are felt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take no thought of the morrow, Mitchell,&rdquo; said Peter, abstractedly. &ldquo;I
    beg your pardon, Mitchell. I mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Peter,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    right; to-morrow is the past, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter blinked down at him as if he were a new species.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an odd young man, Mitchell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
    have to take care of that head of yours or you&rsquo;ll be found hanging
    by a saddle-strap to a leaning tree on a lonely track, or find yourself in
    a lunatic asylum before you&rsquo;re forty-five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or else I&rsquo;ll be a great man,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;But&mdash;ah,
    well!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter turned his eyes to the fire and smiled sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not enjoyment and not sorrow, is our destined end or way,&rdquo; he
    repeated to the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But we get there just the same,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;destined
    or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;But to live, that each to-morrow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finds us further than to-day!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, that just fits my life, Peter,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I
    might have to tramp two or three hundred miles before I get a cut (a pen,
    or &ldquo;stand&rdquo; in a shearing shed) or a job, and if to-morrow didn&rsquo;t find
    me nearer than to-day I&rsquo;d
    starve or die of thirst on a dry stretch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get married and settle down, Mitchell?&rdquo; asked
    Peter, a little tired. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a teetotaller.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I got married I couldn&rsquo;t settle down,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I
    reckon I&rsquo;d be the loneliest man in Australia.&rdquo; Peter gave him
    a swift glance.  &ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;d be single no matter how much married
    I might be. I couldn&rsquo;t get the girl I wanted, and&mdash;ah, well!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell&rsquo;s expression was still quaintly humorous round the lower
    part of his face, but there was a sad light in his eyes. The strange light
    as of the old dead days, and he was still young.</p>
  <p>The cornet had started in the surveyors&rsquo; camp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Their blooming tunes seem to fit in just as if they knew what we
    were talking about,&rdquo; remarked Mitchell.</p>
  <p>The cornet:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll break my heart, you little bird,<br>
    That sings upon the flowering thorn&mdash;<br>
    Thou mind &rsquo;st me of departed joys,<br>
Departed never to return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn it all,&rdquo; said Mitchell, sitting up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
    sentimental.&rdquo; Then, as if voicing something that was troubling him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    you think a woman pulls a man down as often as she lifts him up, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some say so,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some say so, and they write it, too,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Sometimes
    it seems to me as if women were fated to drag a man down ever since Adam&rsquo;s
    time. If Adam hadn&rsquo;t taken his wife&rsquo;s advice&mdash;but there,
    perhaps he took her advice a good many times and found it good, and, just
    because she happened to be wrong this time, and to get him into a hole, the
    sons of Adam have never let the daughters of Eve hear the last of it. That&rsquo;s
    human nature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack Barnes, the young husband, who was suffering a recovery, had been very
    silent all the evening. &ldquo;I think a man&rsquo;s a fool to always listen
    to his wife&rsquo;s advice,&rdquo; he said, with the unreasonable impatience
    of a man who wants to think while others are talking. &ldquo;She only messes
    him up, and drives him to the devil as likely as not, and gets a contempt
    for him in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter gave him a surprised, reproachful look, and stood up. He paced backwards
    and forwards on the other side of the fire, with his hands behind his back
    for a while; then he came and settled himself on the log again and filled
    his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a man can always find excuses for himself
    when his conscience stings him. He puts mud on the sting. Man at large is
    beginning all over the world to rake up excuses for himself; he disguises
    them as  &lsquo;Psychological studies,&rsquo; and thinks he is clean and
    clever and cultured, or he calls &rsquo;em problems&mdash;the sex problem,
    for instance, and thinks he is brave and fearless. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>Danny was in trouble again, and Peter went to him. He complained that when
    he lay down he saw the faces worse, and he wanted to be propped up somehow,
    so Peter got a pack-saddle and propped the old man&rsquo;s shoulders up with
    that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Peter began, when be came back to the fire, &ldquo;I
    remember a young man who got married&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell hugged himself. He knew Jack Barnes. He knew that Jack had a girl-wife
    who was many times too good for him; that Jack had been wild, and had nearly
    broken her heart, and he had guessed at once that Jack had broken out again,
    and that Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan was shepherding him home. Mitchell had worked
    as mates with Jack, and liked him because of the good heart that was in him
    in spite of all; and, because he liked him, he was glad that Jack was going
    to get a kicking, so to speak, which might do him good. Mitchell saw it coming,
    as he said afterwards, and filled his pipe, and settled himself comfortably
    to listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember the case of a naturally selfish young man who got married&rdquo; said
    Peter. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know he was selfish; in fact, he thought he
    was too much the other way&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t matter now. His name
    was&mdash;well, we&rsquo;ll call him&mdash;we&rsquo;ll call him, &lsquo;Gentleman
    Once.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean Gentleman Once that we saw drinking back at Thomas&rsquo;s
    shanty?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;not him. There have been more than
    one in the bush who went by the nickname of &lsquo;Gentleman Once.&rsquo; I
    knew one or two. It&rsquo;s a big clan, the clan of Gentleman Once, and scattered
    all over the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;excuse me for interrupting,
    Peter&mdash;but wasn&rsquo;t old Danny, there, a gentleman once? I&rsquo;ve
    heard chaps say he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know he was,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentleman Once! Who&rsquo;s talking about Gentleman Once?&rdquo; said
    an awful voice, suddenly and quickly. &ldquo;About twenty or thirty years
    ago I was called Gentleman Once or Gentleman Jack, I don&rsquo;t know which&mdash;Get
    out!&nbsp;<i>Get out</i>, I say! It&rsquo;s all lies, and you&rsquo;re the
    devil. There&rsquo;s four devils sitting by the fire. I see them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Two of the four devils by the fire looked round, rather startled.</p>
  <p>Danny was sitting up, his awful bloodshot eyes glaring in the firelight,
    and his ruined head looking like the bloated head of a hairy poodle that
    had been drowned and dried. Peter went to the old man and soothed him by
    waving off the snakes and devils with his hands, and telling them to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard Danny on the Gentleman Once racket before,&rdquo; remarked
    Mitchell. &ldquo;Seems funny, doesn&rsquo;t it, for a man to be proud of
    the fact that he was called &lsquo;Gentleman Once&rsquo; about twenty years
    ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seems more awful than funny to me,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Joe,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;But the saddest
    things are often funny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When Peter came back he went on with his story, and was only interrupted
    once or twice by Danny waking up and calling him to drive off the snakes,
    and green and crimson dogs with crocodile heads, and devils with flaming
    tails, and those unpleasant sorts of things that force their company on boozers
    and madmen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentleman Once,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;he came from the old country
    with a good education and no character. He disgraced himself and family once
    too often and came, or was sent, out to Australia to reform. It&rsquo;s a
    great mistake. If a man is too far gone, or hasn&rsquo;t the strength to
    live the past down and reform at home, he won&rsquo;t do it in a new country,
    unless a combination of circumstances compels him to it. A man rises by chance;
    just as often he falls by chance. Some men fall into the habit of keeping
    steady and stick to it, for the novelty of it, until they are on their feet
    and in their sane minds and can look at the past, present and future sensibly.
    I knew one case&mdash; But that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with the story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentleman Once came out on the remittance system. That system is
    fatal in nine cases out of ten. The remittance system is an insult to any
    manhood that may be left in the black sheep, and an insult to the land he
    is sent to. The cursed quarterly allowance is a stone round his neck which
    will drag him down deeper in a new land than he would have fallen at home.
    You know that remittance men are regarded with such contempt in the bush
    that a man seldom admits he is one, save when he&rsquo;s drunk and reckless
    and wants money or credit. When a ne&rsquo;er-do-well lands in Melbourne
    or Sydney without a penny he will probably buck-up and do something for himself.
    When he lands with money he will probably spend it all in the first few months
    and then straighten up, because he has to. But when he lands on the remittance
    system he drinks, first to drown homesickness. He decides that he&rsquo;ll
    wait till he gets his next quarter&rsquo;s allowance and then look round.
    He persuades himself that it&rsquo;s no use trying to do anything: that,
    in fact, he can&rsquo;t do anything until he gets his money. When he gets
    it he drifts into one &lsquo;last&rsquo; night with chums he has picked up
    in second and third-rate hotels. He drinks from pure selfishness. No matter
    what precautions his friends at home take, he finds means of getting credit
    or drawing on his allowance before it is due&mdash;until he is two or three
    quarters behind. He drinks because he feels happy and jolly and clever and
    good-natured and brave and honest while he is drinking. Later on he drinks
    because he feels the reverse of all these things when he is sober. He drinks
    to drown the past and repentance. He doesn&rsquo;t know that a healthy-minded
    man doesn&rsquo;t waste time in repenting. He doesn&rsquo;t know how easy
    it is to reform, and is too weakwilled to try. He gets a muddled idea that
    the past can&rsquo;t be mended. He finds it easy to get drink and borrow
    money on the strength of his next quarter&rsquo;s allowance, so he soon gets
    a quarter or two behind, and sometimes gets into trouble connected with borrowed
    money. He drifts to the bush and drinks, to drown the past only. The past
    grows blacker and blacker until it is a hell without repentance; and often
    the black sheep gets to that state when a man dreads his sober hours. And
    the end? Well, you see old Danny there, and you saw old Awful Example back
    at Thomas&rsquo;s shanty&mdash;he&rsquo;s worse than Danny, if anything.
    Sometimes the end comes sooner. I saw a young new-land-new-leaf man dying
    in a cheap lodging-house in Sydney. He was a schoolmate of mine, by the way.
    For six weeks he lay on his back and suffered as I never saw a man suffer
    in this world; and I&rsquo;ve seen some bad cases. They had to chloroform
    him every time they wanted to move him. He had affected to be hard and cynical,
    and I must say that he played it out to the end. It was a strong character,
    a strong mind sodden and diseased with drink. He never spoke of home and
    his people except when he was delirious. He never spoke, even to me, of his
    mental agony. That was English home training. You young Australians wouldn&rsquo;t
    understand it; most bushmen are poets and emotional.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My old schoolmate was shifted to the Sydney Hospital at last, and
    consented to the amputation of one leg. But it was too late. He was gone
    from the hips down. Drink&mdash;third-rate hotel and bush shanty drink&mdash;and
    low debauchery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack Barnes drew up his leg and rubbed it surreptitiously. He had  &ldquo;pins
    and needles.&rdquo; Mitchell noticed and turned a chuckle into a grunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentleman Once was a remittance man,&rdquo; continued Peter. &ldquo;But
    before he got very far he met an Australian girl in a boarding-house. Her
    mother was the landlady. They were bush people who had drifted to the city.
    The girl was pretty, intelligent and impulsive. She pitied him and nursed
    him. He wasn&rsquo;t known as Gentleman Once then, he hadn&rsquo;t got far
    enough to merit the nickname.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter paused. Presently he jerked his head, as if he felt a spasm of pain,
    and leaned forward to get a stick from the fire to light his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s the girl who marries a man to reform him, and
    when she has reformed him never lets him hear the last of it. Sometimes,
    as a woman, she drives him back again. But this was not one of that sort
    of girls. I once held a theory that sometimes a girl who has married a man
    and reformed him misses in the reformed man the something which attracted
    her in the careless scamp, the something which made her love him&mdash;and
    so she ceases to love him, and their married life is a far more miserable
    one than it would have been had he continued drinking. I hold no theory of
    that kind now. Such theories ruin many married lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter jerked his head again as if impatient with a thought, and reached
    for a fire-stick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with the story. When Gentleman
    Once reformed his natural selfishness came back. He saw that he had made
    a mistake. It&rsquo;s a terrible thing for a young man, a few months, perhaps
    a few weeks after his marriage, to ask himself the question, &lsquo;Have
    I made a mistake?&rsquo; But Gentleman Once wasn&rsquo;t to be pitied. He
    discovered that he had married beneath him in intellect and education. Home
    training again. He couldn&rsquo;t have discovered that he had married beneath
    him as far as birth was concerned, for his wife&rsquo;s father had been a
    younger son of an older and greater family than his own&mdash; But Gentleman
    Once wouldn&rsquo;t have been cad enough to bother about birth. I&rsquo;ll
    do him that much justice. He discovered, or thought he did, that he and his
    wife could never have one thought in common; that she couldn&rsquo;t possibly
    understand him. I&rsquo;ll tell you later on whether he was mistaken or not.
    He was gloomy most times, and she was a bright, sociable, busy little body.
    When she tried to draw him out of himself he grew irritable. Besides, having
    found that they couldn&rsquo;t have a thought in common he ceased to bother
    to talk to her. There are many men who don&rsquo;t bother talking to their
    wives; they don&rsquo;t think their wives feel it&mdash;because the wives
    cease to complain after a while; they grow tired of trying to make the man
    realize how they suffer. Gentleman Once tried his best&mdash;according to
    his lights&mdash;and weakness. Then he went in for self-pity and all the
    problems. He liked to brood, and his poor little wife&rsquo;s energy and
    cheerfulness were wearying to him. He wanted to be left alone. They were
    both high-spirited, in different ways; she was highly strung and so was he&mdash;because
    of his past life mostly. They quarrelled badly sometimes. Then he drank again
    and she stuck to him. Perhaps the only time he seemed cheerful and affectionate
    was when he had a few drinks in him. It was a miserable existence&mdash;a
    furnished room in a cheap lodging-house, and the use of the kitchen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He drank alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now a dipsomaniac mostly thinks he is in the right&mdash;except,
    perhaps, after he has been forced to be sober for a week. The noblest woman
    in the world couldn&rsquo;t save him&mdash;everything she does to reform
    him irritates him; but a strong friend can save him sometimes&mdash;a man
    who has been through it himself. The poor little wife of Gentleman Once went
    through it all. And she stuck to him. She went into low pubs after him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter shuddered again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She went through it all. He swore promises. He&rsquo;d come home
    sober and fill her with hope of future happiness, and swear that he&rsquo;d
    never take another glass. &lsquo;And we&rsquo;ll be happy yet, my poor boy,&rsquo; she&rsquo;d
    say, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll be happy yet. I believe you, I trust you&rsquo; (she
    used to call him her &lsquo;bonny boy&rsquo;  when they were first married).
    And next night he&rsquo;d come home worse than ever. And one day he&mdash;he
    struck her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter shuddered, head and shoulders, like a man who had accidentally smashed
    his finger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And one day he struck her. He was sober when he did it&mdash;anyhow
    he had not taken drink for a week. A man is never sober who gets drunk more
    than once a week, though he might think he is. I don&rsquo;t know how it
    happened, but anyway he struck her, and that frightened him. He got a billet
    in the Civil Service up-country. No matter in what town it was. The little
    wife hoped for six months.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a cruel thing that a carelessly selfish young
    man cannot realize how a sensitive young wife suffers for months after he
    has reformed. How she hopes and fears, how she dreads the moment he has to
    leave her, and frets every hour he is away from home&mdash;and suffers mental
    agony when he is late. How the horror of the wretched old past time grows
    upon her until she dares not think of it. How she listens to his step and
    voice and watches his face, when he comes home, for a sign of drink. A young
    man, a mate of mine, who drank hard and reformed, used to take a delight
    in pretending for a few minutes to be drunk when he came home. He was goodhearted,
    but dense. He said he only did it to give his wife a pleasant surprise afterwards.
    I thought it one of the most cruel things I had ever seen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentleman Once found that he could not stand the routine of office
    work and the dull life in that place. He commenced to drink again, and went
    on till he lost his billet. They had a little boy, a bright little boy, yet
    the father drank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The last spree was a terrible one. He was away from home a fortnight,
    and in that fortnight he got down as deep as a man could get. Then another
    man got hold of him and set him on his feet, and straightened him up. The
    other man was a ruined doctor, a wreck whose devil was morphia. I don&rsquo;t
    hold that a man&rsquo;s salvation is always in his own hands; I&rsquo;ve
    seen mates pull mates out of hell too often to think that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then Gentleman Once saw the past as he had never seen it before&mdash;he
    saw hope for the future with it. And he swore an oath that he felt he would
    keep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He suffered from reaction on his way home, and, as he neared the
    town, a sudden fear, born of his nervous state, no doubt, sent a cold, sick
    emptiness through him: &lsquo;Was it too late?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As he turned into the street where he lived, he noticed a little
    group of bush larrikins standing at the corner. And they moved uneasily when
    they caught sight of him, and, as he passed, they touched and lifted their
    hats to him. Now he knew that he had lost the respect even of bush larrikins;
    and he knew enough of the bush to know that a bushman never lifts his hat
    to a man&mdash;only to death, and a woman sometimes. He hurried home and
    read the truth in his wife&rsquo;s eyes. His little boy was dead. He went
    down under the blow, and she held his head to her breast and kept saying, &lsquo;My
    poor boy, my poor boy!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was he that she meant, not the boy she had lost. She knew him,
    she understood him better than he did himself, and, heart-broken as she was,
    she knew how he was going to suffer, and comforted him. &lsquo;My poor boy,
    my poor, foolish boy!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He mended the past, as far as he could, during the next two years,
    and she seemed happy. He was very gentle, he was very kind to her. He was
    happy, too, in a new, strange way. But he had learned what it was to suffer
    through his own fault, and now he was to learn what it was to suffer through
    no fault of his own, and without the consolation of saying &lsquo;I was wrong!
    I was to blame!&rsquo; At the end of the two years there was another child,
    and his wife died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The four sat silently smoking until Jack Barnes asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did he do then, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Peter, abstractedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Gentleman Once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter roused himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve told the story, and it is about time to turn in,
    he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say exactly what Gentleman Once did when his
    wife died. He might have gone down to a deeper depth than Danny&rsquo;s.
    He might have risen higher than he had ever been before. From what I knew
    of his character he would never have gone down an easy slope as Danny has
    done. He might have dropped plump at first and then climbed up. Anyway, he
    had the memory of the last two years to help him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the reformed drunkard who has trained himself
    to take a drink when he needs it, to drink in moderation&mdash;he&rsquo;s
    the strongest character of all, I think&mdash;but it&rsquo;s time to turn
    in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cornet up the creek was playing a march.</p>
  <p>Peter walked across and looked at Danny, who seemed to be sleeping as peacefully
    as could be expected of him.</p>
  <p>Jack Barnes got up and walked slowly down the creek in the moonlight. He
    wanted to think.</p>
  <p>Peter rolled out his blankets on the grass and arranged his saddle-bags
    for a pillow. Before he turned in Mitchell shook hands with him, a most unusual
    and unnecessary proceeding in camp. But there&rsquo;s something in the bush
    grip which means &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe Wilson rolled out his blankets close to Mitchell&rsquo;s camp; he wanted
    to enjoy some of Mitchell&rsquo;s quiet humour before he went to sleep, but
    Mitchell wasn&rsquo;t in a philosophical mood. He wanted to reflect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder who Gentleman Once was?&rdquo; said Joe to Mitchell. &ldquo;Could
    he have been Danny, or old Awful Example back there at the shanty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; said Mitchell. He puffed three long puffs at his pipe,
    and then said, reflectively</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard men tell their own stories before to-night Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Joe who wanted to think now.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>About four o&rsquo;clock Mitchell woke and stood up. Peter was lying rolled
    in his blanket with his face turned to the west. The moon was low, the shadows
    had shifted back, and the light was on Peter&rsquo;s face. Mitchell stood
    looking at him reverently, as a grown son might who sees his father asleep
    for the first time. Then Mitchell quietly got some boughs and stuck them
    in the ground at a little distance from Peter&rsquo;s head, to shade his
    face from the bright moonlight; and then he turned in again to sleep till
    the sun woke him.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheGhostsofManyChristmases"></a>The Ghosts of Many Christmases</b></h2>
  <p>Did&nbsp;you ever trace back your Christmas days?&mdash;right back to the
    days when you were innocent and Santa Claus was real. At times you thought
    you were very wicked, but you never realize how innocent you were until you&rsquo;ve
    grown up and knocked about the world.</p>
  <p>Let me think!</p>
  <p>Christmas in an English village, with bare hedges and trees, and leaden
    skies that lie heavy on our souls as we walk, with overcoat and umbrella,
    sons of English exiles and exiles in England, and think of bright skies and
    suns overhead, and sweeps of country disappearing into the haze, and blue
    mountain ranges melting into the azure of distant lower skies, and curves
    of white and yellow sand beaches, and runs of shelving yellow sandstone sea-walls&mdash;and
    the glorious Pacific! Sydney Harbour at sunrise, and the girls we took to
    Manly Beach.</p>
  <p>Christmas in a London flat. Gloom and slush and soot. It is not the cold
    that affects us Australians so much, but the horrible gloom. We get heart-sick
    for the sun.</p>
  <p>Christmas at sea&mdash;three Christmases, in fact&mdash;one going saloon
    from Sydney to Westralia early in the Golden Nineties with funds; and one,
    the Christmas after next, coming back steerage with nothing but the clothes
    we&rsquo;d slept in. All of which was bad judgment on our part&mdash;the
    order and manner of our going and coming should have been reversed.</p>
  <p>Christmas in a hessian tent in &ldquo;th&rsquo; Westren,&rdquo; with so
    many old mates from the East that it was just old times oven again. We had
    five pounds of corned beef and a kerosene-tin to boil it in; and while we
    were talking of old things the skeleton of a kangaroo-dog grabbed the beef
    out of the boiling water and disappeared into the scrub&mdash;which made
    it seem more like old times than ever.</p>
  <p>Christmas going to New Zealand, with experience, by the s.s.&nbsp;<i>Tasmania</i>.
    We had plum duff, but it was too &ldquo;soggy&rdquo; for us to eat. We dropped
    it overboard, lest it should swamp the boat&mdash;and it sank to the ooze.
    The&nbsp;<i>Tasmania</i>&nbsp;was saved on that occasion, but she foundered
    next year outside Gisborne. Perhaps the cook had made more duff. There was
    a letter from a sweetheart of mine amongst her mails when she went down;
    but that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with it, though it made some difference
    in my life.</p>
  <p>Christmas on a new telegraph line with a party of lining gangmen in New
    Zealand. There was no duff nor roast because there was no firewood within
    twenty miles. The cook used to pile armfuls of flax-sticks under the billies,
    and set light to them when the last man arrived in camp.</p>
  <p>Christmas in Sydney, with a dozen invitations out to dinner. The one we
    accepted was to a sensible Australian Christmas dinner; a typical one, as
    it should be, and will be before the Commonwealth is many years old. Everything
    cold except the vegetables, the hose playing on the veranda and vines outside,
    the men dressed in sensible pyjama-like suits, and the women and girls fresh
    and cool and jolly, instead of being hot and cross and looking like boiled
    carrots, and feeling like boiled rags, and having headaches after dinner,
    as would have been the case had they broiled over the fire in a hot kitchen
    all the blazing forenoon to cook a scalding, indigestible dinner, as many
    Australian women do, and for no other reason than that it was the fashion
    in England. One of those girls was very pretty and&mdash;ah, well!&mdash;</p>
  <p>Christmas dinner in a greasy Sydney sixpenny restaurant, that opened a few
    days before with brass band going at full blast at the door by way of advertisement. &ldquo;Roast-beef,
    one! Cabbage and potatoes, one! Plum pudding, two!&rdquo; (That was the first
    time I dined to music.) The Christmas dinner was a good one, but my appetite
    was spoilt by the expression of the restaurant keeper, a big man with a heavy
    jowl, who sat by the door with a cold eye on the sixpences, and didn&rsquo;t
    seem to have much confidence in human nature.</p>
  <p>Christmas&mdash;no, that was New Year&mdash;on the Warrego River, out back
    (an alleged river with a sickly stream that looked like bad milk). We spent
    most of that night hunting round in the dark and feeling on the ground for
    camel and horse droppings with which to build fires and make smoke round
    our camp to keep off the mosquitoes. The mosquitoes started at sunset and
    left off at daybreak, when the flies got to work again.</p>
  <p>Christmas dinner under a brush shearing-shed. Mutton and plum pudding&mdash;and
    fifty miles from beer!</p>
  <p>An old bush friend of mine, one Jimmy Nowlett, who ranked as a bullock-driver,
    told me of a Christmas time he had. He was cut off by the floods with his
    team, and had nothing to eat for four days but potatoes and honey. He said
    potatoes dipped in honey weren&rsquo;t so bad; but he had to sleep on bullock
    yokes laid on the ground to keep him out of the water, and he got a toothache
    that paralysed him all down one side.</p>
  <p>And speaking of plum pudding, I consider it one of the most barbarous institutions
    of the British. It is a childish, silly, savage superstition; it must have
    been a savage inspiration, looking at it all round&mdash;but then it isn&rsquo;t
    so long since the British were savages.</p>
  <p>I got a letter last year from a mate of mine in Western Australia&mdash;prospecting
    the awful desert out beyond White Feather&mdash;telling me all about a &ldquo;perish&rdquo; he
    did on plum pudding. He and his mates were camped at the Boulder Soak with
    some three or four hundred miles&mdash;mostly sand and dust&mdash;between
    them and the nearest grocer&rsquo;s shop. They ordered a case of mixed canned
    provisions from Perth to reach them about Christmas. They didn&rsquo;t believe
    in plum pudding&mdash;there are a good many British institutions that bushmen
    don&rsquo;t believe in&mdash;but the cook was a new chum, and he said he&rsquo;d
    go home to his mother if he didn&rsquo;t have plum pudding for Christmas,
    so they ordered a can for him. Meanwhile, they hung out on kangaroo and damper
    and the knowledge that it couldn&rsquo;t last for ever. It was in a terrible
    drought, and the kangaroos used to come into the &ldquo;Soak&rdquo; for water,
    and they were too weak to run. Later on, when wells were dug, the kangaroos
    used to commit suicide in them&mdash;there was generally a kangaroo in the
    well in the morning.</p>
  <p>The storekeeper packed the case of tinned dog, etc., but by some blunder
    he or his man put the label on the wrong box, and it went per rail, per coach,
    per camel, and the last stage per boot, and reached my friends&rsquo; camp
    on Christmas Eve, to their great joy. My friend broke the case open by the
    light of the camp-fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, Jack!&rdquo; he said, tossing out a can, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
    your plum pudding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held the next can in his hand a moment longer and read the label twice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! he&rsquo;s sent two,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure
    I only ordered one. Never mind&mdash;Jack&rsquo;ll have a tuck-out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held the next can close to the fire and blinked at it hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if he hasn&rsquo;t sent three tins of plum pudding.
    Never mind, we&rsquo;ll manage to scoff some of it between us. You&rsquo;re
    in luck&rsquo;s way this trip, Jack, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked harder still at the fourth can; then he read the labels on the
    other tins again to see if he&rsquo;d made a mistake.</p>
  <p>He didn&rsquo;t tell me what he said then, but a milder mate suggested that
    the storekeeper had sent half a dozen tins by mistake. But when they reached
    the seventh can the language was not even fit to be written down on a piece
    of paper and handed up to the magistrate. The storekeeper had sent them an
    unbroken case of canned plum pudding, and probably by this time he was wondering
    what had become of that blanky case of duff.</p>
  <p>The kangaroos disappeared about this time and my friend tells me that he
    and his mates had to live for a mortal fortnight on canned plum pudding.
    They tried it cold and they tried it boiled, they tried it baked, they had
    it fried, and they had it toasted, they had it for breakfast, dinner and
    tea. They had nothing else to think, or talk, or argue and quarrel about;
    and they dreamed about it every night, my friend says. It wasn&rsquo;t a
    joke&mdash;it gave them the nightmare and day-horrors.</p>
  <p>They tried it with salt. They picked as many of the raisins out as they
    could and boiled it with salt kangaroo. They tried to make Yorkshire pudding
    out of it; but it was too rich.</p>
  <p>My friend was experimenting and trying to discover a simple process for
    separating the ingredients of plum pudding when a fresh supply of provisions
    came along. He says he was never so sick of anything in his life, and he
    has had occasion to be sick of a good many things.</p>
  <p>The new-chum jackeroo is still alive, but he won&rsquo;t ever eat plum pudding
    any more, he says. It cured him of home-sickness. He wouldn&rsquo;t eat it
    even if his bride made it.</p>

  <p>Christmas on the goldfields in the last of the roaring days, in the palmy
    days of Gulgong and those fields. Let&rsquo;s see! it must be nearly thirty
    years ago! Oh, how the time goes by!</p>
  <p>Santa Claus, young, fresh-faced and eager; Santa Claus, blonde and flaxen;
    Santa Claus, dark; Santa Claus with a brogue and Santa Claus speaking broken
    English; Santa Claus as a Chinaman (Sun Tong Lee &amp; Co. storekeepers),
    with strange, delicious sweets that melted in our mouths, and rum toys and
    Chinese dolls for the children.</p>
  <p>Lucky diggers who were with difficulty restrained from putting pound notes
    and nuggets and expensive lockets and things into the little ones&rsquo;  stockings.
    Santa Claus in flannel shirt and clay-covered moleskins. Diggers who bought
    lollies by the pound and sent the little ones home with as much as they could
    carry.</p>
  <p>Diggers who gave a guinea or more for a toy for a child that reminded them
    of some other child at home. Diggers who took as many children as they could
    gather on short notice into a store, slapped a five-pound note down on the
    counter and told the little ones to call for whatever they wanted. Who set
    a family of poor children side by side on the counter and called for a box
    of mixed children&rsquo;s boots&mdash;the best-and fitted them on with great
    care and anxiety and frequent inquiries as to whether they pinched. Who stood
    little girls and boys on the counter and called for the most expensive frocks,
    the latest and best in sailor suits, and the brightest ribbons; and things
    came long distances by bullock dray and were expensive in those days. Impressionable
    diggers&mdash;and most of them were&mdash;who threw nuggets to singers, and
    who, sometimes, slipped a parcel into the hands of a little boy or girl,
    with instructions to give it to an elder sister (or young mother, perhaps)
    whom the digger had never spoken to, only worshipped from afar off. And the
    elder sister or young mother, opening the parcel, would find a piece of jewellery
    or a costly article of dress, and wonder who sent it.</p>
  <p>Ah, the wild generosity of luck-intoxicated diggers of those days! and the
    reckless generosity of the drinkers. &ldquo;We thought it was going to last
    for ever!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t spend it on the bairns I&rsquo;ll spend it on the
    drink,&rdquo;  Sandy Burns used to say. &ldquo;I ha&rsquo; nane o&rsquo; me
    own, an&rsquo; the lass who was to gi&rsquo; me bairns, she couldn&rsquo;t
    wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sandy had kept steady and travelled from one end of the world to the other,
    and roughed it and toiled for five years, and the very day he bottomed his
    golden hole on the Brown Snake Lead at Happy Valley he got a letter from
    his girl in Scotland to say she had grown tired of waiting and was married.
    Then he drank, and drink and luck went together.</p>
  <p>Gulgong on New Year&rsquo;s Eve! Rows and rows of lighted tents and camp-fires,
    with a clear glow over it all. Bonfires on the hills and diggers romping
    round them like big boys. Tin kettling&mdash;gold dishes and spoons, and
    fiddles, and hammers on pointing anvils, and sticks and empty kerosene-tins
    (<i>they</i>&nbsp;made a row); concertinas and cornets, shot-guns, pistols
    and crackers, all sorts of instruments, and &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; in
    one mighty chorus.</p>
  <p>And now&mdash;a wretched little pastoral town; a collection of glaring corrugated-iron
    hip-roofs, and maybe a rotting propped-up bark or weather-board humpy or
    two&mdash;relics of the roaring days; a dried-up storekeeper and some withered
    hags; a waste of caved-in holes with rain-washed mullock heaps and quartz
    and gravel glaring in the sun; thistles and burrs where old bars were; drought,
    dryness, desolation and goats.</p>
  <p>Lonely graves in the bush and grey old diggers here and there, anywhere
    in the world, doing anything for a living, lonely yet because of the girls
    who couldn&rsquo;t wait, but prospecting and fossicking here and there, and
    dreaming still.</p>
  <p>They thought it was going to last for ever.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Christmas at Eurunderee Creek, amongst the old selection farms in the western
    spurs of the Blue Mountains. They used to call it &ldquo;Th&rsquo; Pipeclay&rdquo;  thirty
    years ago, but the old black names have been restored. They make plum puddings
    yet, weeks beforehand, and boil them for hours and hang them in cloths to
    the rafters to petrify; then they take them down and boil them again. On
    Christmas Eve the boys cut boughs or young pines on the hills, and drag them
    home and lash them to the veranda-posts.</p>
  <p>Ted has turned up with his wife and children from his selection out back.
    The wheat is in and shearing is over on the big stations. Tom&mdash;steady-going
    old Tom&mdash;clearing or fencing or dam-sinking up-country, hides his tools
    in the scrub and gets his horse and rides home. Aunt Emma (to everyone&rsquo;s
    joy) has arrived from Sydney with presents (astonishing bargains in frocks,
    etc.) and marvellous descriptions of town life.</p>
  <p>Joe, &ldquo;poor&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s husband, who has been droving in Queensland
    since the Christmas before last&mdash;while poor Mary, who is afraid to live
    alone, shared a skillion and the family quarrels at home&mdash;Joe rides day and
    night and reaches home at sunrise on Christmas morning, tired and dusty,
    gaunt and haggard, but with his last cheque intact. He kisses his wife and
    child and throws himself on the bed to sleep till dinner-time, while Mary
    moves round softly, hushes the baby, dresses it and herself, lays out Joe&rsquo;s
    clean things, and bends over him now and then, and kisses him, perhaps, as
    he sleeps.</p>
  <p>In the morning the boys and some of the men go down to the creek for a swim
    in the big shady pool under the she-oaks and take their Sunday clothes with
    them and dress there.</p>
  <p>Some of them ride into town to church, and some of the women and children
    drive in in spring-carts&mdash;the children to go to Sunday school, leaving
    mother and the eldest daughter&mdash;usually a hard-worked, disappointed,
    short-tempered girl&mdash;at home to look after the cooking.</p>
  <p>There is some anxiety (mostly on mother&rsquo;s part) about Jim, who is  &ldquo;wild,&rdquo; and
    is supposed to be somewhere out back. There was &ldquo;a piece of blue paper&rdquo; out
    for Jim on account of sweating (illegally using) a horse, but his mother
    or father has got a hint&mdash;given in a kindly way by the police-sergeant&mdash;that
    Jim is free to come home and stay at home if he behaves himself. (There is
    usually a horse missing when Jim goes out back.)</p>
  <p>Jim turns up all right&mdash;save that he has no money&mdash;and is welcomed
    with tearful affection by his favourite sister Mary, shakes hands silently
    with his father, and has a long whispered conversation with his mother, which
    leaves him very subdued. His brothers forbear to sneer at him, partly because
    it is Christmas, partly on mother&rsquo;s account, and thirdly, because Jim
    can use his hands. Aunt Emma, who is fond of him, cheers him up wonderfully.</p>
  <p>The family sit down to dinner. &ldquo;An old mate of your father&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;a
    bearded old digger&mdash;has arrived and takes the place of honour. (&rdquo;I
    knowed yer father, sonny, on the diggings long afore any of you was ever
    thought on.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p>The family have only been a few hours together, yet there is an undercurrent
    of growling, that, to the stranger, mysterious yet evident undercurrent of
    nastiness and resentment which goes on in all families and drags many a promising
    young life down. But Aunt Emma and the old mate make things brighter, and
    so the dinner&mdash;of hot roast and red-hot plum pudding&mdash;passes off
    fairly well.</p>
  <p>The men sleep the afternoon away and wake up bathed in perspiration and
    helpless; some of the women have headaches. After tea they gather on the
    veranda in the cool of the evening, and that&rsquo;s the time when the best
    sides of their natures and the best parts of the past have a chance of coming
    uppermost, and perhaps they begin to feel a bit sorry that they are going
    to part again.</p>
  <p>The local races or &ldquo;sports&rdquo; on Boxing Day. There is nothing
    to keep the boys home over New Year. Ted and his wife go back to their lonely
    life on their selection; Tom returns to his fencing or tank-sinking contract;
    Jim, who has borrowed &ldquo;a couple of quid&rdquo; from Tom, goes out back
    with strong resolutions for the New Year, and shears &ldquo;stragglers,&rdquo; breaks
    in horses, cooks and clerks for survey parties, and gambles and drinks, and
    gets into trouble again. Maybe Joe &ldquo;knocks about&rdquo; the farm a
    bit before going into the Great North-West with another mob of cattle.</p>
  <p>The last time I saw the Old Year out at Eurunderee the bushfires were burning
    all over the ranges, and looked like great cities lighted up. No need for
    bonfires then.</p>
  <p>Christmas in Bourke, the metropolis of the great pastoral scrubs and plains,
    five hundred miles west, with the thermometer one-hundred-and-something-scarey
    in the shade. The rough, careless shearers come in from stations many dusty
    miles out in the scrubs to have their Christmas sprees, to drink and &ldquo;shout&rdquo; and
    fight&mdash;and have the horrors some of them&mdash;and be run in and locked
    up with difficulty, within sound of a church-going bell.</p>
  <p>The Bourke Christmas is a very beery and exciting one. The hotels shut up
    in front on Christmas Day to satisfy the law (or out of consideration for
    the feelings of the sergeant in charge of the police station), and open behind
    to satisfy the public, who are supposed to have made the law.</p>
  <p>Sensible cold dinners are the fashion in Bourke, I think, with the hose
    going, and free-and-easy costumes.</p>
  <p>The free males take their blankets and sleep in the &ldquo;park;&rdquo; the
    women sleep with doors and windows open, and the married men on mattresses
    on the verandas across the open doors&mdash;in case of accidents.</p>
  <p>Christmas in Sydney, though Christmas holidays are not so popular as Easter,
    or even Anniversary Day, in the Queen city of the South. Buses, electric,
    cable and the old steam trams crowded with holiday-makers with baskets. Harbour
    boats loaded down to the water&rsquo;s edge with harbour picnic-parties. &ldquo;A
    trip round the harbour and to the head of Middle Harbour one shilling return!&rdquo; Strings
    of tourist trains running over the Blue Mountains and the Great Zigzag, and
    up the coast to Gosford and Brisbane Water, and down the south coast to beautiful
    Illawarra, until after New Year. Hundreds of young fellows going out with
    tents to fish in lonely bays or shoot in the mountains, and rough it properly
    like bushmen&mdash;not with deck chairs, crockery, a piano and servants.
    For you can camp in the grand and rugged solitude of the bush within a stone&rsquo;s
    throw of the city, so to speak.</p>
  <p>Jolly camps and holiday parties all round the beautiful bays of the harbour,
    and up and down the coast, and all close to home. Camps in the moonlight
    on sandy beaches under great dark bluffs and headlands, where yellow, shelving,
    sandstone cliffs run, broken only by sandy-beached bays, and where the silver-white
    breakers leap and roar.</p>
  <p>And Manly Beach on a holiday! Thousands of people in fresh summer dress,
    hundreds of bare-legged, happy children running where the &ldquo;blue sea
    over the white sand rolls,&rdquo; racing in and out with the rollers, playing
    with the glorious Pacific. Manly&mdash;&ldquo;Our Village&rdquo;&mdash;Manly
    Beach, where we used to take our girls, with the most beautiful harbour in
    the world on one side, and the width of the grandest ocean on the other.
    Ferny gullies and &ldquo;fairy dells&rdquo; to north and south, and every
    shady nook its merry party or happy couple.</p>
  <p>Manly Beach&mdash;I remember five years ago (oh, how the time goes by!)&mdash;and
    two names that were written together in the sand when the tide was coming
    in.</p>
  <p>And the boat home in the moonlight, past the Heads, where we felt the roll
    of the ocean, and the moonlit harbour&mdash;and the harbour lights of Sydney&mdash;the
    grandest of them all.</p>

  <p align="center" class="note">(Written On The&nbsp;Occasion Of The&nbsp;Prince Of Wale&rsquo;s&nbsp;Visit
      To&nbsp;Australia)</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;ll&nbsp;be royal times in Sydney for the Cuff and Collar Push,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;ll be lots of dreary drivel and clap-trap<br>
    From the men who own Australia, but who never knew the Bush,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who could not point their runs out on the map.<br>
    Oh, the daily Press will grovel as it never did before,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;ll be many flags of welcome in the air,<br>
    And the Civil Service poet, he shall write odes by the score&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the men who made the land will not be there.</p>
  <p>You shall meet the awful Lady of the latest Birthday Knight&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(She is trying to be English, don&rsquo;t-cher-know?)<br>
    You shall hear the empty mouthing of the champion blatherskite,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall hear the boss of local drapers blow.<br>
    There&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;majahs&rsquo; from the counter, tailors&rsquo; dummies
    from the fleet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to represent Australia here to-day,<br>
    There&rsquo;s the today with his card-case and his cab in Downing-street;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the men who made Australia&mdash;where are they?</p>
  <p>Call across the blazing sand wastes of the Never-Never Land!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some who will not answer yet awhile,<br>
    Some whose bones rot in the mulga or lie bleaching on the sand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Died of thirst to win the land another mile.<br>
    Thrown from horses, ripped by cattle, lost on deserts; and the weak,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mad through loneliness or drink (no matter which),<br>
    Drowned in floods or dead of fever by the sluggish slimy creek&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are men who died to make the Wool-Kings rich.</p>
  <p>Call across the scrubby ridges where they clear the barren soil,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gaunt Bush-women share the work of men&mdash;<br>
    Toil and loneliness for ever&mdash;hardship, loneliness and toil&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the brave drought-ruined farmer starts again!<br>
    Call across the boundless sheep-runs of a country cursed for sheep&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call across the awful scrublands west of Bourke!<br>
    But they have no time to listen&mdash;they have scarcely time to sleep&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the men who conquer deserts have to work.</p>
  <p>Dragged behind the crawling sheep-flock on the hot and dusty plain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must make a cheque to feed the wife and kids&mdash;<br>
    Riding night-watch round the cattle in the pelting, freezing rain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While world-weariness is pressing down the lids.<br>
    And away on far out-stations, seldom touched by Heaven&rsquo;s breath,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a loneliness that smothers love and hate&mdash;<br>
    Where they never take white women&mdash;there they live the living death<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a half-caste or a black-gin for a mate.</p>
  <p>They must toil to save the gaunt stock in the blazing months of drought,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the stinging, blinding blight is in men&rsquo;s
  eyes&mdash;<br>
    On the wretched, burnt selections, on the big runs further out<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the sand-storm rises lurid to the skies.<br>
    Not to profit when the grass is waving waist-high after rain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mighty clip of wool comes rolling in&mdash;<br>
    For the Wool-King goes to Paris with his family again<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gold that souls are sacrificed to win.</p>
  <p>There are carriages in waiting for the swells from over-sea,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are banquets in the latest London style,<br>
    While the men who made Australia live on damper, junk and tea&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the quiet voices whisper, &lsquo;Wait a while!&rsquo;<br>
    For the sons of all Australia, they were born to conquer fate&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, where charity and friendship are sincere,<br>
    Where a sinner is a brother and a stranger is a mate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the future of a nation&rsquo;s written clear.</p>
  <p>Aye, the cities claim the triumphs of a land they do not know,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all empty is the day they celebrate!<br>
    For the men who made Australia federated long ago,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the men to rule Australia&mdash;they can wait.<br>
    Though the bed may be the rough bunk or the gum leaves or the sand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the roof for half the year may be the sky&mdash;<br>
    There are men amongst the Bushmen who were born to save the land!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they&rsquo;ll take their places sternly by-and-by.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a whisper on the desert though the sunset breeze hath died<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scrubs, though not a breath to stir a bough,<br>
    There&rsquo;s a murmur, not of waters, down the Lachlan River side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis the spirit of Australia waking now!<br>
    There&rsquo;s the weird hymn of the drought-night on the western water-shed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the beds of unlocked rivers crack and parch;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the dead that we have buried, and our great unburied dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are calling now on living men to march!</p>
  <p>Round the camp fire of the fencers by the furthest panel west,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the men&rsquo;s hut by the muddy billabong,<br>
    On the Great North-Western Stock-routes where the drovers never rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are sorting out the right things from the wrong.<br>
    In the shearers&rsquo; hut the slush lamp shows a haggard, stern-faced man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preaching war against the Wool-King to his mates;<br>
    And wherever go the billy, water-bag and frying-pan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are drafting future histories of states!</p>
