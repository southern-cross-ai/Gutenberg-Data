<h2><a id="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="intro">MY object in writing this story is to bring home to readers
the inevitable consequence of ending the present war in any other way than by
the complete subjugation of Germany, and the destruction of Prussian
militarism. Despite the established proofs that Germany <I>planned and
willed</I> the present war with the set object of conquest, there are many who
are not alive to the probable results of an unfortunate peace. That there would
be a terrible sequel in the lifetime of the present generation is certain.</P>

<p class="intro">We cannot hope to end wars unless we crush the only power
in the world which aims at securing aggrandisement by force of arms. We may not
always find ourselves so closely allied to three great military nations. It may
not even be possible, however much the Powers forming the present
<I>entente</I> sympathise with each other, to show a solid front and fight side
by side in some future conflict.</P>

<p class="intro">The only way to secure permanent peace for Europe is to
destroy the power, which for forty years has rattled its scabbard at its
peace-loving neighbours, and to destroy that power now.</P>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">"YOU don't really believe all that nonsense about another
German war?"</P>

<p>The stout man asked the question almost irritably, as
though the statement he challenged had been especially designed for his
distress. The tall young man who sprawled on the grass did not answer
immediately. He was chewing at a long grass stalk and gazing meditatively
toward the blue waters of Bank Bay almost under his eyes, for he had chosen the
edge of the cliff for comfort and for a reason which he was not at the moment
prepared to admit.</P>

<p>He was a man of twenty-seven and looked older. His grey
eyes, clear and grave, were directed absently to the streak of amber beach
where one figure strolled in solitary state.</P>

<p>From the distance he was unable to identify the lonely girl
who for an hour past had been enjoying what was apparently the gentlest and the
most monotonous of exercises.</P>

<p>The elder man repeated the question and Grant Macrae turned
with a start.</P>

<p>"Believe it? Of course I believe it, my dear Mr. Massey,"
he answered lazily. "I never say anything I don't believe."</P>

<p>Mr. Holman Massey wiped his forehead, for the day was hot
and the climb up from Chadleigh Norton had been a distressing experience for
one of his age and figure.</P>

<p>"This is one of the infernal sensations your confounded
paper is always springing upon the public; I suppose you are trying its effect
upon me?" he accused.</P>

<p>Grant Macrae laughed and rose to his feet. "We shall see,"
was all he said.</P>

<p>"I shan't see it in my lifetime, please God," said Mr.
Massey shortly; "nor yours, either. My dear man, surely we have had enough of
war to last us for a century--"</P>

<p>Grant turned to him abruptly. "Do you think that the peace
we made ten years ago was a good one?" he asked.</P>

<p>Mr. Massey hesitated. In his heart of hearts he thought, on
the contrary, that the peace had been a very bad one.</P>

<p>"We were sick of the war," he said; "we thought things were
going well and then we found they were going rotten--dash it! we had to make
peace."</P>

<p>"On terms," said Grant drill. "Good Lord! to think that I
was only a kid at the time with no idea--"</P>

<p>He stopped himself in time. He had no desire to be dragged
into a long argument--an argument which could not fail to end with irritation to
himself; for Mr. Massey was one of those stolid, irascible Englishmen who made
up the gaps of reasoned argument with spluttering denunciations of all who
opposed his view or questioned his logic.</P>

<p>Grant's eyes went back to the beach below.</P>

<p>"I can tell you one thing, which isn't two," said Mr.
Massey. He spoke with the emphasis and employed the crude figure which he
invariably utilised when he desired to be unusually impressive. "My daughter
isn't at all impressed by your point of view." He looked keenly to observe the
effect of his words, and was a little disappointed to find that the young man
was seemingly untouched at this news of Olga Massey's disapproval.</P>

<p>"Your daughter is a very intelligent young person," drawled
Grant Macrae; "which is a little singular, remembering--"</P>

<p>He nearly said something very rude, and indeed was at that
moment in no mood to finesse with this unimaginative man. But, suppressing a
very natural inclination, he went on--</P>

<p>"Considering the tendency of present-day young womanhood.
But I can assure you, my dear Mr. Massey, that, grieved as I am to find myself
in opposition to Miss Massey, I still hold the views I have held for years and
shall continue to hold until, in the near future, I receive, as I am afraid I
shall receive, confirmation of all my misgivings."</P>

<p>Mr. Massey snorted. "I am going down to the village," he
said, looking at his watch. "Come and dine to-night."</P>

<p>"I'm sorry," said the other, so quickly that, had Mr.
Massey been a man who had had greater experience of men of the Grant Macrae
type, he might have suspected a hasty improvisation. "I've got a lot of work to
do to-night, and I'm looking forward to a solitary dinner and an unbroken
evening."</P>

<p>Mr. Massey grunted.</P>

<p>"Who's that?" he asked suddenly, and pointed to the
beach.</P>

<p>Grant smiled.</P>

<p>"That is precisely the question I have been asking myself
for the last two hours," he said unblushingly.</P>

<p>"Is it a man or woman?" asked Mr. Massey, fixing his pince-nez.</P>

<p>Grant strained his eyes.</P>

<p>"It looks to me rather like a young girl, and I can't
exactly place her. Anyway, she is not an inhabitant of Chadleigh Norton," he
said, after a pause.</P>

<p>He might say this with assurance, because the people of
that aristocratic village were very few and as familiar to him as the fingers
of his hands.</P>

<p>Many people have taken and, it must be confessed, accepted
the credit for discovering Chadleigh Norton. Situated on the wooded slope of a
valley through which ran the tiny Chad, Chadleigh Norton had once been no more
than a collection of insanitary and tumble-down cottages, rented by a small
community of shepherds. Some genius--and Grant Macrae was generally regarded as
being identified with that genius--had seen the possibilities of the place, had
bought up every house, and had established an unique garden city, within a mile
of the single line of rail which connected the little coast town of Burland and
that great world, the centre of which is Piccadilly Circus.</P>

<p>There had come into being a new and a marvellous village.</P>

<p>At the far end of the one tree-planted avenue was the red
Georgian house, with its big outhouses, of Sir John Venniman. Nobody knows, and
it was a standing wonder to Chadleigh Norton, why this man, who had been the
greatest chemist of his day and was now pursuing investigations into a branch
of science foreign to that in which he had made his name famous, should have
chosen this community, wholly frivolous and pleasure-seeking, to establish his
new laboratories. Farther along "The Street," as it was called, was the severe
stone bungalow of Holman Massey; whilst next door, and separated only by the
thickly planted pines, was the more ornate establishment of Sir Max Graaf. Sir
Max, who had spent many years in Africa, had endeavoured to reproduce the solid
Dutch Colonial style of architecture, but stone-flagged stoeps, wedded to
colonnaded piazza, and with a Gothic tower at one angle of the building
moreover, had considerably interfered with his original plan.</P>

<p>Grant Macrae's comfortable cottage was not visible from the
road, being hidden in the midst of a tangle of trees, and only from the lower
slope of the valley was Casa Blanca, with its dazzling white facade, to be
seen. Mortimer Brown, the only other "villager," lived at the southern extreme
of the street in splendid aloofness--although he was, by all accounts, an
American in point of nationality and a democrat in politics.</P>

<p>"She must be somebody staying with Graaf," said Mr. Massey,
studying the figure on the beach intently; and then, with heavy jocularity: "By
Jove! I know who it is, Macrae--it's a German spy!"</P>

<p>The joke, feeble as it was, afforded him the greatest
gratification, and he chuckled all the way down the hill at his own humour.
Grant was too preoccupied either to be amused or to resent this gentle jest at
his expense. The national situation as he viewed it excited no sense of
merriment. He was the editor, and held the larger number of the shares in the
company which controlled the <I>Daily Megaphone</I>. A wealthy man, blessed
with a greater share of this world's goods than usually falls to the lot of
humanity, he had taken up the work on the newspaper which his father had
founded, with a keener sense of his responsibilities to the people than is
usually found in a man of his class similarly circumstanced.</P>

<p>"I must tell that to Olga," smiled Mr. Massey, and pointed
with his stick at two people at the foot of the hill path.</P>

<p>Olga Massey was a tall, fair, and eminently prepossessing
girl. The radiance of womanhood, which shone in her clear blue eyes and
shimmered in her glorious hair, was negatived by a hint of masculinity which
her strong jaw and her firm mouth revealed. Even this disappeared when she
flashed a dazzling smile at Macrae as they neared one another.</P>

<p>"Mr. Macrae has been looking for German submarines," she
bantered, and Massey gurgled in his delight.</P>

<p>"Exactly what I was saying," he said. "We shall really have
to muzzle old Macrae, Sir Max."</P>

<p>He addressed the stout man by the girl's side, and Max
Graaf, clean-shaven and square built, a little red of face, becoming in a man
who loves the fields and the open air, shot an inquiring glance at Grant.</P>

<p>"I don't think this eccentricity of yours is at all funny,
you know," he said reprovingly.</P>

<p>"To which particular eccentricity are you referring?" asked
Grant.</P>

<p>"This anti-German policy that you run in your paper,"
replied the other. "Surely to heaven we've had enough of that sort of business
ten years ago. I've just been reading this morning's <I>Megaphone</I>. The
leading article is little less than disgusting. What you do is to charge a
Government which tried and failed, and honourably admitted its failure, with
double dealing."</P>

<p>"In other words," said Grant coolly, "I am suggesting that
the German Government, which, by trickery and bribery, procured men to support
and speak in favour of a peace which left this country at the mercy of Germany,
is going systematically to work to bring its plans to fruition, so that it
will, as it must inevitably, attack this country with a minimum of danger to
itself."</P>

<p>Sir Max frowned, and there was a hard light in his eye.</P>

<p>"I had hoped," he said deliberately, "I had hoped, when I
came to this village, that here we should be free from all sorts of
controversies and that one would find peace in these pleasant
surroundings--"</P>

<p>"Peace!" interrupted Grant Macrae bitterly, "always peace!
You cannot always get the kind of peace you want, Sir Max."</P>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the other sharply.</P>

<p>"Exactly what I say," said Grant; and with a little nod to
Mr. Massey he raised his hat to the girl and, turning, strode through the
plantation which hides the village to seaward, and disappeared.</P>

<p>Sir Max Graaf said nothing, but there was an unpleasant
look in his cold blue eyes as he watched the vanishing figure. What he might
have said at that moment will never be known, for Olga Massey, uttering an
exclamation, pointed to the sky.</P>

<p>"Look!" she said.</P>

<p>The two men turned their gaze toward the clear blue, where,
poised like a tiny bird, and the hum of its engine growing with every second to
a dull, rattling roar, a white-winged aeroplane was circling, corkscrew
fashion, preparatory to making a landing.</P>

<p>"That is young Ballin," said Sir Max with a smile.</P>

<p>"I thought he'd gone to town," said the girl in wonder.</P>

<p>Sir Max shook his head.</P>

<p>"He went to Koblenz yesterday," he said. "He is something
of an enthusiast."</P>

<p>The monoplane came to the earth as lightly as a bird, ran
for a hundred yards across the green, level golf-links which had been laid out
on top of the cliff, and came to a stop before the party. A young man in brown
overalls waved his hand gaily, and his mechanic seated behind him jumped out
and assisted his employer to alight.</P>

<p>The newcomer was a tall, fair, good-looking young man,
unmistakably Teutonic.</P>

<p>"And here we are from Koblenz," he said, without a trace
of any foreign accent, "and I have done the journey in three hours."</P>

<p>"Wonderful child," smiled the girl.</P>

<p>The young man skinned his gloves and, unbuttoning the brown
cover-all, revealed himself in the garb of civilisation.</P>

<p>"And what is happening in Koblenz?" asked Massey.</P>

<p>The young man smiled and shrugged his shoulders.</P>

<p>"It was a painful occasion," he said flippantly, "being no
less than the final day of one of those Indemnity Weeks which have been such a
feature of German life during the past ten years. Think of it," he went on
thoughtfully, speaking half to himself, "for ten long years every town in
Germany, in that 'potato-bread spirit' to which one of your statesmen referred,
has been hoarding its every spare penny, has been working day and night at its
industries for half salary, has been living without luxury, without strong
drink, and without unnecessary rest, to one object."</P>

<p>There was something in his tone which caused Olga Massey to
look at him a little curiously.</P>

<p>"What is that?" she asked.</P>

<p>The young man started as though he had been awakened from a
reverie.</P>

<p>"To pay your infernal indemnity," he said lightly. "What
else? If you and your Allies insist upon my unfortunate country handing over
thousands of millions of marks, and if the Government has already exhausted its
financial strength on the war, it is left to the people themselves to supply
the deficiency."</P>

<p>He spoke without bitterness, without resentment, a little
regretfully perhaps, of the terrible condition which had obtained in Germany
since the end of the war. Ten years had passed and Germany was still poor, by
her own confession. It was a point of honour that she should raise money to pay
off her indemnities, and she had applied herself to this end with a vigour,
with a courage, with a singleness of purpose beyond all praise. Yet she was
poor. Her newspapers owned as much. Her Chancellor, speaking in the new subdued
strain so foreign to the mouthpiece of a sometime Prussian militarism, made no
secret of her poverty.</P>

<p>Herr Ballin shook out his overall absent-mindedly and
turned it inwards to fold, when something dropped from the pocket. The girl saw
it first. It was a curious silver device, a skull and crossbones superimposed
upon the letters 15. Following the direction of her eyes the young man saw it,
stooped with a muttered oath, grasped it, and thrust it in his pocket. She saw
he was flushed and a little angry and wondered why.</P>

<p>"A love token, Fräulein," said Carl Ballin lightly.</P>

<hr>
<br>
<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">GRANT MACRAE settled down with the correspondence which he
had brought from town. His post bag had been very heavy of late, for his
attitude towards Germany had excited a more than ordinarily prolific
correspondence. That the majority of the letters he received were abusive, and
no small number of them threatening, did not in any way disturb his equanimity.
No journalist takes up a cause, however good, but that he finds a vicious man
or two who can spare the time to pour forth the vials of his wrath upon
paper.</P>

<p>If Grant had consulted the material interests of his
newspaper, he might well have let the matter go and drop a subject which
irritated so many people. Had he listened to his advertising manager and his
publisher, he would have certainly taken this course. But in his heart of
hearts Grant Macrae knew that what he was doing was the right thing. Ten years
had passed since the plenipotentiaries of the Powers had signed the Peace of
Copenhagen. The appearance of new and unexpected forces in the field had
brought about the collapse of Austria and the shortening of the German line in
a last vain and desperate endeavour to save their cause. It had marked, too,
the rapid retirement of the German in the West to the line of the Meuse. And
then, with staggering suddenness, Germany had asked for terms, and instantly
there had arisen in Great Britain at a thousand points eloquent men and women
who pleaded for peace. "Let the war end," they cried. "Give us back our sons and
our brothers. The German is crushed and beaten; he is humiliated before the
world, and has ceased to be a power for evil."</P>

<p>And the German had been handsome in a way. He had yielded
up the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine to France, he had accepted without
dispute the Russian reoccupation of Galicia and German Poland, he had
acquiesced in the transfer of the Trentino and the disputed territories on the
Adriatic littoral to Italy, and he had shrugged his shoulders with
good-humoured despair when Serbia had taken to herself the greater part of
Bosnia,
while Roumania had extended her border line into Transylvania.</P>

<p>There were only two points at issue: one was the existence
of Germany's fleet, which had remained intact behind the guns of Wilhelmshaven
and was, by reason of the building of new ships, more powerful now than ever it
had been before; the other was the continuance of the Hohenzollern line on the
throne of the United German States. Germany bargained frankly. The cause of war
had disappeared. Belgium had been restored to its heroic king; a huge and
immediate contribution, advanced by the Powers, had been paid to her; and the
whole of the German Colonial Empire was now under the French and the British
flags. What more could the British want? The British wanted--and desired this
most earnestly--the surrender of the German fleet, and the end of all Germany's
pretensions to sea-power. They desired, no less earnestly, the passing of the
Hohenzollern dynasty.</P>

<p>At the first suggestion, supported though it was by the
highest naval authorities of the land, there arose, as it seemed, a veritable
shrieking multitude to protest against this unnecessary humiliation of a great
race. "Germany has had her lesson; let her keep her fleet," said one orator.
And that sentence, "She has had her lesson; let her keep her fleet," became a
catch phrase in the pacifist circles of the world.</P>

<p>Great Britain hesitated, a little bewildered by this
unexpected presentation of Germany's case. While she hesitated, the United
States of America threw their weight into the balance. American journals which
had been pro-German suddenly became flatteringly pro-English. The
representatives of Germany, who for a year had been applauding the atrocities
which Germany had committed on sea and land, and had been holding up the
British to the hatred of the world, melted to a sudden mildness. The criers of
peace were strengthened by the docility with which Germany had surrendered her
colonies and by the readiness with which she had agreed to pay the enormous
demands of the nations involved in the war.</P>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked a vacillating England! France
shrugged her shoulders and said in so many words: "If you fight on to destroy
the Navy we are with you." Russia, more interested in the destruction of a
fleet which threatened her Baltic towns, was all for fighting. Then unsuspected
advocates of peace had appeared in most surprising places. Members of the
Government and Opposition alike who had been suspected of unnecessary antipathy
against the Germans, stood up and boldly advocated an immediate peace, and
demonstrated by the simple processes of arithmetic the impossibility of a
German naval recovery and the innocuous character of the German fleet.</P>

<p>And the question of the Hohenzollern dynasty had most
surprisingly and most mysteriously vanished.</P>

<p>And so peace was made, and there was a Cabinet resignation
or two. A succession of hectic speeches, a wild and furious General Election,
which brought the Opposition back in overwhelming numbers, pledged, vaguely
enough, "to maintain Britain's naval supremacy," but in the main to conduct
recuperative legislation.</P>

<p>In truth the country had been drained of its surplus
resources. The enormous call which had been made upon its manhood and its
treasure had disorganised its industries, and the fact that, for the moment at
any rate, popular prejudice shut out one of the most important of Britain's
markets, all helped to bring about a trade depression the like of which had
never been seen in the history of the country.</P>

<p>And so peace had come, and in retaliation for the many
crimes against humanity and against the world which Germany had committed in
the course of the war, the Allied nations settled down to a tacit boycott of
German products. At first the German had attempted to overcome this boycott by
the establishment of branch houses in Switzerland; but he had found the
handicap of supplying two profits, one to himself and one to his middleman, had
struck at the very root of his commercial system. He hoped to re-establish his
trade by the method which he had always adopted, of taking a small profit and
underselling his competitors. The Swiss scheme was unworkable, and the German
settled down, on the urgent advice of his economists, to work out his salvation
in Germany. It is not surprising that the Allied boycott broke down. If you do
not buy from the German, the German cannot buy from you. Two years after the
conclusion of peace, conditions obtained which, if they were not normal, were
rapidly approaching normality. The best drilled and the best disciplined nation
of Europe was engaged in making good the enormous losses which Germany had
suffered during the war. Germany was determined not only to pay off the
indemnity in the quickest possible space of time, but to secure the surpluses
which were required to reorganise her army and her navy. Four years after the
signing of the peace at Copenhagen, a test mobilisation brought to the colours
600,000 men in twenty-four hours. To say that every man, woman and child of
reasoning age throughout the Empire was working day and night for the
Fatherland is to be guilty of no exaggeration. The "potato-bread spirit" was
abroad with a vengeance. After the Socialistic disturbances, which had been so
ruthlessly suppressed, at the end of the war, parties had practically
disappeared from the Reichstag, and even the powerful Trades Unions had come
into line, and had permitted, even urged, substantial reductions in the wage
rates. Men and women were working seventy hours a week at a 25 per cent.
reduction of salary, and from their shrunken incomes were contributing large
sums of money to indemnity funds, which had as their object the reduction of
the National Debt.</P>

<p>The majority of people in England saw in this only an
altogether admirable exemplification of the German spirit of thrift. The German
was very thorough in all his methods. Something like a commercial entente had
been established between Germany and Russia, and a commercial treaty with
France. France might indeed settle down with a certain complacency to the
enjoyment of the fruits of war. No longer was that group of statuary on the
Place de la Concorde, representing the lost provinces, decorated with wreaths
and flowers. The lost provinces had been regained.</P>

<p>Sometimes there crept an ugly note into the pleasant hum of
industrial Germany. Once a party of English tourists in Strasbourg had been
insulted, and one member struck by an excited Prussian officer, who had wildly
threatened a day of reprisal both for England and for America. "That hornless
cow," as this infuriated major of <i>Jägers</i> had called America, had been
for a
long time the object of German displeasure, in spite of the fact that the two
countries maintained a huge volume of trade between one another. The sequel to
this impassioned outbreak had been swift and tragic. The ruffled tourists
complained to the local police station, reports of the event had been sent to
Army Headquarters, and that night the Prussian officer had been seized, tried
by court-martial under an article of the new military law, and had been shot
before the hotel in which the horrified tourists were staying. This was
evidence, if evidence was needed, of Germany's sincerity, said the enthusiastic
pacifists.</P>

<p>Men like Grant Macrae read into this act a more sinister
meaning.</P>

<p>Again:</P>

<p>An obscure East Prussian paper had published a venomously
anti-British article, full of vague and ominous threats, and hinting
mysteriously at a time which was not far distant when Germany would rise,
phoenix-like, from her ashes and overwhelm "her hereditary enemy." The sequel
here was almost as swift and infinitely more dramatic. The issue of the paper
was confiscated, and by proclamation the readers were ordered, under pain of
the severest penalty, to return the copies in their possession to the nearest
police-station. The editor and the whole of his staff were seized, his plant
dynamited--in their zeal the East Prussian police destroyed half the street in
which the printing works stood--and the editor, brought before a court-martial,
was sentenced to twenty years' solitary confinement in a fortress. A protest
meeting against the severity of this sentence was broken up, the principal
speaker sabred in the street, and a dozen other people were killed or wounded
in the course of the riot which followed.</P>

<p>Grant Macrae had a copy of this historic number of the
<I>Tilsiter Zeitung</I>. He had, too, the speech of the hapless major of
<i>Jägers</i> and, further, the diatribe which was delivered by a member of
the Right
in the Reichstag, and which had been suppressed in the official records--and
they were all curiously alike.</P>

<p>Each hinted of "a coming day," each threatened dire
consequences, and each had contained the phrase, "the men of '15." Some
reference to present-day Germany which he found in one of the letters he was so
carefully perusing, caused him to open his cabinet and take out the typed
copies of these statements to refresh his memory on the point, and he was
leaning over his desk, head on hand, tracing the German script with the end of
his pencil, when a gentle tap at the window made him sit upright. His study was
at the back of the house, a big, plain room, two walls of which were covered by
bookshelves; a big French window opened on to the lawn, and this ordinarily was
protected by a roll shutter, which could be lowered or raised from the inside
of the room. He remembered that he had not closed this shutter, and rose,
pulling back the curtain from the window. In the darkness without he saw the
figure of a girl. He turned the key of the French window, and, opening it,
stepped out.</P>

<p>"I am so sorry to disturb you," said the gentle voice of
his visitor.</P>

<p>Grant raised his eyebrows in wonder. He knew all the
inhabitants of this exclusive little village, and this was evidently a
stranger. Now strangers do not as a rule come to Chadleigh Norton. It lies off
the main road, and offers nothing in the shape of accommodation to the
tripper.</P>

<p>"Won't you come in?" he said courteously, and stepped back
to allow her to enter.</P>

<p>In the light of the table-lamp he saw a girl a little above
medium height, neatly dressed, with that expensive neatness which distinguishes
the garb of the well-to-do. She was straight and, as far as he could see, well
formed. But it was her face, with its pure pallor, and the dark eyes, which
arrested his attention.</P>

<p>To say that she was pretty would have been short of the
mark. She was nearly beautiful with her perfect oval face and her
delicately-modelled mouth. Her hair was of a curious russet brown, which
seemed red in the
artificial light. Her eyebrows were delicately traced. Her brow, so far as he
could see under the little hat, was broad and intelligent. There was laughter
in her eyes as she returned his scrutiny.</P>

<p>"You are at liberty to remind me that there is a front door
to your house," she smiled.</P>

<p>"I couldn't do anything so rude," said Grant, closing the
window and drawing the curtains across.</P>

<p>He pulled up a chair and, with a little nod of thanks, the
girl, perfectly self-possessed and wholly mistress of the situation, settled
down in its voluminous depths.</P>

<p>"I don't as a rule knock at people's windows," she said,
"but when one has quite a mysterious errand, it is only right that one should
behave in a more or less mysterious fashion."</P>

<p>Grant seated himself at his desk and scrutinised her with
pardonable curiosity.</P>

<p>"If I am not mistaken," he said, "you are the young lady
who was enjoying a solitary ramble on the beach this afternoon?"</P>

<p>She nodded, and he waited for her to disclose the object of
her visit.</P>

<p>"I shan't keep you very long," she said. "You know Sir John
Venniman?"</P>

<p>Grant nodded.</P>

<p>"Most people know Sir John Venniman," he said. "He is one
of the few men who enjoy a fame which carries beyond the confines of Chadleigh
Norton. Do you wish to see him?" he asked.</P>

<p>She shook her head.</P>

<p>"If I had wished to see him I should have gone to him," she
said calmly.</P>

<p>He thought he detected a slight accent in her voice, a
softness of certain consonants which is observable in the speech of youthful
southerners of America. Her next words confirmed his diagnosis.</P>

<p>"I am an American," she said, "and therefore my
eccentricity is a little excusable."</P>

<p>He smiled as he remembered that Sir Max had applied that
very word to his own attitude.</P>

<p>"I have not noticed any particular eccentricity--a word with
which I am not greatly in love to-day," he said, but she stopped him.</P>

<p>"It isn't usual for a young woman to make surreptitious
visits to a comparatively young man," she said drill; "but the occasion
demanded secrecy, and I am sure you will forgive what must seem to you to be an
unwarrantable intrusion, when I have explained the object of my visit."</P>

<p>Grant was wondering what was coming next. For a moment she
did not speak, and then she asked abruptly: "Do you admire the narrative style
of the 'Arabian Nights'?--I ask you because I am a little nervous, realising I
am speaking with one who is a director of public thought and a mentor of
diction."</P>

<p>He smiled responsive to the laughter in her eyes.</P>

<p>"It is a style before all admirably adapted to
confessions," he said gravely, "and it is one which I am always endeavouring to
inculcate into the reportorial mind."</P>

<p>She settled herself, clasped and unclasped her hands a
little nervously, and he thought he detected, in spite of her buoyancy, some
evidence of distress.</P>

<p>"My name is Ruth Manton," she began. "I am the daughter of
Colonel Gregory Manton, of Memphis, Tennessee. I was also my father's sole
heiress, and when dear papa died, years and years ago, I came to Europe and
have been ever since a wanderer on the face of the earth, for I like travel,
and I was at one time rather keen on the ethnological side."</P>

<p>Grant nodded.</P>

<p>"I am also," she went on, "though you might not suppose
this, a very serious patriot. I think my country is just the greatest country
on earth, and whilst I recognise all its faults and all its drawbacks, I want
it to be the greatest country on earth for everlasting."</P>

<p>"That is a very laudable desire," said Grant, "and one
which does you infinite credit."</P>

<p>"You are laughing at me," she said.</P>

<p>"Indeed no," he protested. "I am very much impressed.
Patriotism is one of those rare qualities which one seldom sees walking alone
in these days. Sometimes it is supported on the sturdy arm of Interest,
sometimes it is so cleverly disguised as to be hardly distinguishable from
political jargon, and more often than not it is the arrow-head of a weathercock
which records the wind of prosperity."</P>

<p>"Very pretty," she approved, and Grant was surprised into a
chuckle.</P>

<p>"Well, I'm a patriot, and I've views," she went on. "You've
views, too, and I've read your articles for months past. I've just come back
from Germany," she said, with that curious abruptness of hers. "As soon as I
got to London I inquired where you were, discovered that you were out of town,
guessed you were here, and came straight down. I've been waiting an opportunity
to speak to you. I came from Freiburg, where I was staying at the Kaiserhof.
You know the hotel? There are rather pleasant grounds, and I was sunning myself
rather earlier in the morning than a visitor usually goes abroad, when, like a
melodrama detective, I 'heard voices.' You must understand that the gardens are
laid out with lots of high box-hedges, rather on the lines of an easy maze, and
my chair was placed against one of these hedges--the owners of the voices being
on the other side. They spoke in English--which of all languages is most seldom
heard in Germany to-day--and one said:</P>

<p>"'If Venniman's invention is really what you say it is, we
may dismiss all idea of taking England, and our American plan drops to the
ground.'"</P>

<p>She stopped and was a little disappointed by his calmness.
He saw her disappointment, and hastened to explain his failure to respond.</P>

<p>"It was awfully interesting," he said with a smile, "but
not necessarily thrilling. For instance, quite unimportant people could have
been speculating upon this scheme or the other for embarrassing England." The
girl nodded.</P>

<p>"So I thought myself," she said, "and I walked on till I
came round to the break in the hedge, being curious to see who it was
discussing such high politics."</P>

<p>"And you saw?"</P>

<p>"I saw," said the girl quietly, "Baron von Krussman, the
Imperial Chancellor, and a young man, whom I afterwards discovered was a Mr.
Carl Ballin."</P>

<p>Grant whistled.</P>

<p>"The devil you did," he said.</P>

<p>"I left Freiburg by the same train as Mr. Ballin, and I
learnt he was coming to England to make a flight from Chadleigh Norton to one
of the Rhine towns, and I learnt other things which I needn't tell you for the
moment."</P>

<p>She leant forward, looking seriously at her host.</P>

<p>"Mr. Macrae," she said, "I have read every leading article
on Germany you have ever written, I think, and I am more than ever convinced
that your view is right. There is going to be some very bad trouble with
Germany. It isn't only towards you her attack is to be directed, but ultimately
towards America."</P>

<p>This was Macrae's view also, but it was one to which he had
never given expression, desiring to keep the issue clear.</P>

<p>"That's all," said the girl suddenly. "I'm afraid I've
interrupted your work dreadfully."</P>

<p>She rose as if to go, and Grant followed her example.</P>

<p>"Only one thing I would like to ask you," he said, "and
that is this: are you pursuing your interesting investigations as a hobby?"</P>

<p>"I am pursuing them as a duty," she said quietly. "Possibly
you think I'm rather absurd, and you may suggest a thousand and one things that
a girl could do with her spare time besides acting as a sort of private
detective. But, believe me, Mr. Macrae," she went on earnestly, "I feel this
matter very deeply. After all, why shouldn't I do a little bit for my country?
You see, in the United States we confine our secret service work to discovering
how much Mr. Gink paid Mr. Blink for a road-car concession, and we get over the
question of foreign intrigues against the United States by the simple process
of saying that they don't exist. I'm no Anglo-maniac, but I realise that
Britain stands as a bulwark between America and her European enemy, and that
the crushing of England would give Germany something more than the few Colonies
you have taken from her--it would put at her mercy eighty million people of a
free nation which has never accepted the responsibility of maintaining an army
commensurate with its size and its immense wealth. America is to-day the fat
cow for the milking. America will have very bad trouble with Germany, for I am
convinced that Germany's objective has been shifting."</P>

<p>Grant turned his keen eyes upon hers.</P>

<p>"Exactly what do you mean by that?" he asked.</P>

<p>"I mean," she said emphatically, "that the objective is no
longer England and her Colonies, but that 1915 taught Germany the immense
possibilities of warfare, and revealed to her possibilities of conquest
undreamt of. The subjugation of England is not the be-all and the end-all of
German ambition. England is only the mid-way. She is out for bigger game--and it
is all England's fault! You left Germany with a fleet, and you left Prussian
militarism with its symbol. What was the centre and core of militarism? It was
the house of Hohenzollern. You took Napoleon and sent him to St. Helena--you did
not destroy Napoleonism until then; you didn't scotch the Zulu peril till you
banished Ketchewayo and Dinizulu; you smashed Mahdism when you smashed the
Mahdi's tomb, you ended Krugerism when you drove the old Boer to exile--oh, I
could multiply the instances over and over again. And what did you do with
Prussian militarism? What lesson did you learn from the past? You crushed the
people and left the symbol. Worst folly of all, you left it, its sure shield--a
navy!"</P>

<p>She spoke rapidly, vehemently, and her little hands were
clenched until the knuckles showed whitely.</P>

<p>"I am scared because I understand and have faith in history
as the surest guide and prophet," she said. Then suddenly she went pink. "You
think I'm a histrionic bore, don't you?"</P>

<p>She rose to her feet, smiling.</P>

<p>"Indeed I don't," said Grant seriously. "I wish you would
let me see you again in town."</P>

<p>She thought awhile.</P>

<p>"I would like to call upon you at your office. What is the
best hour for seeing you?"</P>

<p>"Any time after twelve," he said. "Won't you lunch with me
on Monday?"</P>

<p>She hesitated.</P>

<p>"It is rather difficult," she smiled, "to draw a line when
the passionate patriot ends and the decorous lady begins. Won't you lunch with
me? I am staying at the Carlton."</P>

<p>He bowed.</P>

<p>"With all the pleasure in life," he said. "And now I will
see you to your car."</P>

<p>"Please don't," she said quickly. "I came a long way round,
and committed all sorts of trespasses to reach you without observation. If you
don't mind I'll go back the same way. My chauffeur is waiting at the other end
of the road--indeed, I had rather you didn't," she said, and she was so earnest
that he nodded his acquiescence. He walked with her across the lawn, and took
leave upon the little path which runs through the plantation to the eastward of
the house and ends at the gate giving upon the road.</P>

<p>He watched her until she was out of sight, then he turned
and walked slowly back to the house, and sat before his table, his head on his
breast, his fingers beating a ceaseless tattoo upon his blotting-pad, certain
evidence of his preoccupation.</P>

<hr>
<br>
<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>The girl walked quickly along the path, flashing a little
electric torch she took from her bag to guide her, and came to the end of the
plantation. She was lifting the latch when a hand fell heavily upon her
shoulder. She turned with a start.</P>

<p>In the darkness she saw two men, and there came to her a
sudden sense of peril.</P>

<p>"What do you want?" she asked quickly.</P>

<p>"Just a few words of conversation," said he whose hand
still held her.</P>

<p>The voice was that of a well-educated man, and, as she
judged, one who was fairly young.</P>

<p>"I am sorry to be obliged to detain you," it went on, "but
I am afraid necessity knows no law."</P>

<p>"If you wish to speak to me," she said coldly, "you had
better come back with me to Mr. Macrae--and please let go my arm."</P>

<p>"On the contrary," said the other suavely, "I shall neither
take you back to Mr. Macrae nor shall I release you until I learn something
from you which it is very vital I <I>should</I> know. You have been to see Mr.
Macrae, and you have told him a great many things, and, I might add, spoken a
great deal of nonsense. You did not tell him--I can only suppose that you are
reserving that dramatic denouement for your lunch on Monday--that you entered
the room of a gentleman at Freiburg during his absence, opened a desk, and
removed a small but remarkably valuable little book."</P>

<p>She gasped.</P>

<p>"That little book I should like to have," the man went on.
"I need not ask you whether you took it because you have already betrayed
yourself. My dear young lady, you are playing with fire, and a particularly
deadly kind of fire."</P>

<p>She found her voice.</P>

<p>"The book is in safe keeping," she said defiantly, "and if
you had it, it wouldn't be of any use to you. I have memorized--" She stopped
and could have bitten her tongue when she realised her fatal error.</P>

<p>"You have memorised," repeated the other thoughtfully.
"That rather complicates matters. I had hoped that the recovery of the book
would have ended the incident so far as you were concerned. I am afraid we
shall have to keep you for a day or two. You need not be afraid," the man went
on, "we shall do nothing but hold you for a little while--after you shall go.
For the moment...."</P>

<p>He slackened his grip to take a firmer hold, and she felt
that she was in the hand of a man of considerable strength. But in that moment,
when his hand was loosened for the fraction of a second, she put forth all her
strength and, wrenching herself free, she ran.</P>

<p>The way to the road was barred to her, and she fled, as she
thought, toward the house. The little electric lamp was still in her hand, but
she dared not use it, though the path was rough and strange. She realised she
was running downhill. She had no breath to scream, and indeed was not of the
screaming kind.</P>

<p>She had a little light, for here the plantation was not so
thickly planted and the rising moon showed her dimly the way. She heard the man
running behind her, but he was running cautiously, conscious of the danger
which lay in sprawling root and outgrowing sapling. But he was gaining on
her....</P>

<p>Now she was in the open and her chance of escape was
lessened terribly. "Stop!" grated the voice behind her, but she ran on. She
swung round a clump of bushes and struck another patch of rising ground. Her
breath was coming shorter and shorter, ...then she saw.</P>

<p>On a knoll before her, silhouetted against the rising moon,
stood a tall man, motionless, rigid, his head hung forward as if listening.</P>

<p>"Help! help!" she gasped, and fell almost at his feet.</P>

<p>For a moment the figure did not speak, and the two men, who
had stopped dead at the foot of the knoll, saw him raise his hand and caught
the glitter of the revolver it held.</P>

<p>"Germans!" said the stranger of the knoll, and his voice
was harsh and uneducated. But there was a malignity in the tone which turned
the two men cold.</P>

<p>"Germans! I smell ye--damn ye! Germans like them who was at
Neuve-Chapelle who battered me own officer to death and left me like I am!
Germans! Yer swine!"</P>

<p>He raised his hand and there was a flash and a report. The
two men turned and ran, and the girl, scrambling to her feet, seized the man's
hand.</P>

<p>"Don't, don't!" she breathed, and looked up at the face,
now half turned to the moonlight, in terror. What she saw sent her swooning to
the ground... for the stranger was blind.</P>

<hr>
<br>
<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN she recovered consciousness she found herself in a
room which had a strangely familiar aspect to her dazed eyes. She was lying on
a sofa, her blouse was unfastened at the throat, and her face was wet. She
looked about her wonderingly and saw a man watching her with a half-amused
smile. She realised she was back again in Grant Macrae's study, and that it was
that gentleman himself who was now observing her so closely.</P>

<p>"I'm afraid I've been frightfully feminine," she said,
leaning up on her elbow.</P>

<p>"If half that Tom says is true," he said, "you have had
every reason to be feminine."</P>

<p>With a deft touch she straightened her hair and fastened
the collar of her blouse.</P>

<p>"Tom is?" she asked.</P>

<p>"Tom is the gentleman who brought you here," said Grant,
"and incidentally I might tell you that you have had the honour of being
carried in the arms of a man who is decorated with the Victoria Cross."</P>

<p>She shivered as she remembered.</P>

<p>"A blind man," she said in a low tone.</P>

<p>Grant Macrae nodded.</P>

<p>"He must have startled you rather," he said, "but Tom is
the best chap in the world. If it wasn't for his obsession that every
suspicious character he meets is a German, he would be nigh on the perfect
human being. Would you like to see him?"</P>

<p>She hesitated, then nodded.</P>

<p>"He isn't so dreadful, you know," said Grant as he walked
to the door and opened it.</P>

<p>He went into the passage and she heard him call. A few
minutes later she heard the steady, even walk of a man coming along the
corridor, and then Grant ushered the visitor in.</P>

<p>Whatever this man might have seemed to her in the moonlight
in her moment of terror, he was good to look upon, with his fair, almost
golden, hair, lean face, and his broad shoulders. You would not have known that
he was blind, for his eyes were a deep blue and apparently uninjured. He stood
in the doorway, his lips twitching and his big hands fumbling nervously.</P>

<p>"Come in, Tom," said Grant gently. "The lady is quite well
now."</P>

<p>The man coughed awkwardly, and said in a husky voice that
it was "all right."</P>

<p>The girl walked across the room towards him. She was still
feeling a little shaky, but the effect of her adventure was fast wearing
off.</P>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you," she said, and the note of
pity in her voice made Grand Macrae look at her again.</P>

<p>"I owe more to you than I know," she said, and held out her
hand.</P>

<p>He did not take it, and for a moment she felt embarrassed
till she realised, as one has to realise with the blind, that this most natural
gesture which mankind make to one another has no significance for the blind,
who cannot see the hand extended to them. She reached down and caught his hand
in hers, and he responded at once with a firm grip.</P>

<p>"It was nothing, miss," he stammered, "only them Germans. I
knew they were Germans all right, sir." He turned his face to Grant. "I could
tell if I was in the Crystal Palace with a German, and he was at the other end
of the building, sir."</P>

<p>There was a thrill of pride in his voice as he made this
claim. Grant nodded to the girl, as though to confirm all that he had said.</P>

<p>"Who brought me here?" she asked suddenly, turning to
Grant.</P>

<p>He looked toward the man.</P>

<p>"Tom Carrington," he said. "Tom's strong enough to carry
six ladies like you, and he knows every inch of the path, don't you, Tom?"</P>

<p>"Yes, sir, indeed I do," said the man with a smile. "I
thought this young lady had fainted, so I just picked her up and brought her to
you because I knew this was the nearest house."</P>

<p>He turned to Grant.</P>

<p>"If you don't mind, sir, I'll go down and finish that mug
of beer of mine. Good evening, miss," his face towards her.</P>

<p>"Good night," she said gently.</P>

<p>Unerringly he found the door, opened it, and closed it
behind him.</P>

<p>"He gained the V.C. at Neuve-Chapelle," said Grant, when
the other had passed from earshot. "He carried his wounded officer under fire
from in front of an enemy's trench. Then the Germans carried one of our trench
lines and they came upon Tom and his officer lying side by side. They battered
the officer to death with the butts of their rifles, and they shot Tom through
the head."</P>

<p>The girl shuddered.</P>

<p>"How perfectly horrible," she said.</P>

<p>"It's not a nice story," said Grant. "They thought they had
left them both for dead, but Tom had a miraculous escape. Both his optic nerves
were gone, and there is no possibility of his recovering his sight. But that
doesn't hurt him so much as the memory of the crowning horror of that day. The
last sight he saw was the officer he loved better than his life being
murdered."</P>

<p>"Who was the officer?" she asked.</P>

<p>"Lieutenant Edward Venniman," he said quietly.</P>

<p>She opened her eyes in surprise.</P>

<p>"Sir John Venniman's son?"</P>

<p>He nodded.</P>

<p>"Tom lives with him--they are almost inseparable. That is
why Sir John has given up his study of bacteria and has concentrated his mind
and his thought and his every effort upon high explosives."</P>

<p>A bell rang sharply in a distant part of the house.</P>

<p>"That's Sir John, for sure," said Grant.</P>

<p>He went out of the room and the girl heard him open the
front door. Presently she heard voices in the hall.</P>

<p>"I want to introduce you, Sir John," said Grant's voice,
and the girl rose from the sofa to meet the man whose name was famous
throughout the world.</P>

<p>He was a small man, not more than five foot three in
height, thin and spare. His clothes were ill-fitting and stained, and he was
collarless. His big mop of iron-grey hair formed a fluffy halo to his thin,
ascetic face. He was in no sense embarrassed at meeting a lady in his present
condition of déshabillé.</P>

<p>"I am glad to have the opportunity of knowing you," he said
perfunctorily. "Have you seen Tom Carrington?" The inquiry was addressed to
Grant.</P>

<p>"He's downstairs, regaling himself with some of my beer,"
said Grant. "Won't you sit down, Sir John?"</P>

<p>The scientist rumpled his hair to worse confusion, and
looked from one to the other.</P>

<p>"I'm afraid Tom ought to be in bed," he said gravely. "That
boy is a greater nuisance than a baby."</P>

<p>Grant went out of the room and returned in a few moments
with his big guest. He stood in the doorway, smiling sheepishly. Sir John
Venniman shook his head.</P>

<p>"Oh, Tom, Tom," he said reproachfully, "you are always
giving me scares. Don't you know that blind men oughtn't to go wandering about
at night."</P>

<p>"Is it night?" asked the man in surprise.</P>

<p>"Is it night?" repeated Sir John despairingly. "What would
you do with a great booby like that?"</P>

<p>He wagged his finger at the man.</P>

<p>"There are certain things blind men can do and certain
things blind men can't do," he said--the girl shivered a little at this crude
method of address, but apparently Tom Carrington was amused at the strictures,
and stood with a broad grin, showing his strong white teeth, as one who had had
a humorous adventure and must of necessity accept the reproof.</P>

<p>"I was looking for Germans," he said.</P>

<p>The lips of the little scientist parted in a strange
smile.</P>

<p>"Always looking for Germans, that fellow!" he said.</P>

<p>He crossed the room and caught the other's arm in his own
and squeezed it.</P>

<p>"We'll find 'em one of these days, Tom, eh?"</P>

<p>"I'll bet we shall, sir," said Tom confidently.</P>

<p>"And we'll give 'em what for, won't we, Tom?"</P>

<p>"I'm sure, sir," said the other.</P>

<p>Sir John opened the door and led his charge through. He
made no attempt to take farewell, either of his host or the girl, as she sat
listening to the voices of the two men, till she heard the click of the front
door as it opened and the soft pad of it as it closed. Then she turned to Grant
and her eyes were shining.</P>

<p>"Isn't he splendid?" she said.</P>

<p>Grant nodded.</P>

<p>"Is he--?" she hesitated.</P>

<p>"Mad?" finished Grant. "Oh dear, no! He is obsessed, that
is all. Some day John Venniman will take his pound of flesh for the murder of
his son. That is the day he lives for."</P>

<p>The girl had been a little surprised that in neither of her
visits, which had certainly been made under extraordinary circumstances, had
she seen any sign of servants in Grant Macrae's house. He himself had opened
the door to Sir John, he had summoned Tom Carrington from the kitchen below. He
had also utilised that opportunity to give a few instructions to his domestics
apparently, for scarcely had the door closed upon Sir John than a neat serving
maid carried in a well-laid tray.</P>

<p>"I keep my domestic staff out of sight and out of hearing,"
said Grant. "But if it is any comfort to you to know, you are simply surrounded
by female persons of every social domestic degree."</P>

<p>She would have declined the dainty little meal which he put
before her, but he insisted. He was even sufficiently unromantic to suggest
that her swoon might be traceable less to spiritual emotion than to the length
of time between her meals. He pulled up a folding table, opened it by the sofa,
covered it with a little white cloth, deftly arranged silver and steel in their
appropriate places, and with the air of a connoisseur lifted, with a small pair
of silver tongs, the most appetising little cutlet she had ever seen, and
placed it on her plate.</P>

<p>"You are rather domestic yourself," she laughed.</P>

<p>"Immensely so," he replied gravely. "You see, I have to
feed you up. I want to get you strong enough to tell me exactly what happened
after you left me."</P>

<p>In as few words as possible she told him the story of her
adventure.</P>

<p>"Did you recognise the man?" he asked.</P>

<p>She hesitated.</P>

<p>"I don't think I could," she replied.</P>

<p>"Do you think you recognised him?" he persisted.</P>

<p>She hesitated again.</P>

<p>"I had a thought for one moment that it was Mr. Ballin,"
she said. "Of course I couldn't prove it, and I couldn't swear to it. I
recognised his voice rather than his face."</P>

<p>Grant said nothing, but sat in his favourite attitude by
the desk, drumming his fingers upon the blotting-pad.</P>

<p>"It sounds horribly sensational," he said, "and if I ran
that type of paper I should make quite a big story of it. As it is, I must
table it for future reference. If you care to stay here a night," he said, "my
housekeeper will put you up. You will risk losing your reputation, but you
probably lost that years ago if you have acted as unconventionally through your
life as you have this evening."</P>

<p>She shook her head.</P>

<p>"I must go," she said. "My poor chauffeur is still waiting
at the end of the street, unless these people have killed him."</P>

<p>"That's hardly likely," laughed Grant. "Our little
community have very strict bye-laws, one of which is that it is absolutely
<I>verboten</I> to kill chauffeurs in the street."</P>

<p>As a matter of fact, they found the chauffeur in the car
where she had left him, the man having settled himself down to the possibility
of an all-night wait, with that trance-like patience and fortitude which is the
special property of men who drive private cars.</P>

<p>"I shall see you on Monday, I hope," said the girl at
parting, and offered him a cool little hand.</P>

<p>"If you are left to us, certainly. This is a nice car," he
said inconsequently. "How long will it take you to get to town?"</P>
<B><p>"</B>Two hours."</P>

<p>He looked at his watch.</P>

<p>"It is now nine o'clock," he said, and opened the door of
the limousine.</P>

<p>She stepped in, and to her surprise he followed.</P>

<p>"I am going to London with you," he said, and silenced her
protest.</P>

<p>"But I said good-bye to you," she laughed.</P>

<p>"You can say good-bye in the Haymarket. An extra good-bye
or two won't occasion you any serious discomfort. I can bribe a taxi-man to
bring me back, and anyway, if I can't, I have a flat in town. One thing is
certain, that I'm not going to lose sight of you until I see you safely
home."</P>

<p>She murmured a little protest, but in her heart of hearts
she was relieved.</P>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">THE <I>Daily Megaphone</I> dismissed the extraordinary
incident in a couple of lines. The <I>Gazette and Chronicle</I>, and indeed all
the other papers published in London, gave quite a thrilling account of an
adventure which befell a certain motor-car on its way to London on Friday,
September 17th, 1925. The introduction to the <I>Gazette and Chronicle's</I>
account may be given, and it might be added that the details were supplied to
the newspaper representatives by a certain loquacious chauffeur.</P>
<br>

<p class="newspaper">
"On Friday night a motor-car, the property of Miss Manton,
and occupied by its owner and a friend, was the centre of a remarkable
experience. The car was being driven from Chadleigh Norton to London, and the
journey was half accomplished when the remarkable happening which is recorded
below occurred. The car was speeding along the main London road, deserted at
this hour of the night, when the chauffeur heard the noise of an aeroplane.
Slowing his car, he looked up and backward and saw, coming over the road, not
more than 100 yards above the earth, what appeared to be a large monoplane. In
these days a monoplane travelling by night is not so rare a sight as it was,
perhaps, ten years ago, and the chauffeur was only mildly interested in the
apparition. He had scarcely withdrawn his eyes from the approaching aircraft,
when a tremendous explosion occurred in the rear of the car, smashing the
windows and the wind guard by its violence. The chauffeur looked up, and says
he saw at that moment a second bomb falling from the aeroplane above. The bomb
fell harmlessly in a field to the left of the road. What might have happened
subsequently we may only conjecture, but at that moment the aeroplane tilted
sideways and came down quickly into a field. Possibly the force of the first
explosion had upset its equilibrium, or it may have been that the airman had
some engine trouble. The chauffeur proceeded to put as great a distance as
possible between himself and his assailant. The affair created a great
sensation in the locality, but every effort to trace the aeroplane has failed.
Apparently it returned to its hangar immediately afterwards. The suggestion has
been put forward that it was a military aeroplane practising flying by night,
which had been equipped by mistake with bombs instead of dummy bombs, and these
had become detached owing to the vibration of the engine."</P>
<br>

<p>"I think your chauffeur talks a great deal too much," said
Grant, reading the account.</P>

<p>"It is one of the privileges of the democracy," she said
lightly.</P>

<p>They were lunching at the Carlton in fulfilment of their
arrangement. Grant nodded and smiled to somebody at a distant table, and the
girl followed his eyes.</P>

<p>"That is a very pretty lady," she said.</P>

<p>"That is Olga Massey," lie replied, "and the pompous
gentleman with her is her father. He does half a million pounds' worth of trade
with Germany every year, and takes a thick-headed view of Teutonic aspirations.
The younger gentleman with her I think you know," he added drill.</P>

<p>She frowned.</P>

<p>"Why, it is Mr. Ballin," she said quickly.</P>

<p>Grant nodded. Presently Ballin rose from the table, with a
little bow to his host, crossed the room and came to them.</P>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Macrae?" he asked with a frank smile.</P>

<p>It was not a thing which an English gentleman would have
done without invitation, and Grant had no other alternative than to introduce
him to the girl. If the truth be told, he welcomed the opportunity. He was
curious to see exactly what would happen.</P>

<p>The young man clicked his heels and bowed.</P>

<p>"We have met before," he said, and corrected himself. "When
I say 'met,' I should have said we have seen one another before. I have a very
good memory for faces," he smiled, "and especially faces I have seen in
Freiburg."</P>

<p>The girl looked at him straight in the eyes, but there was
no sign of perturbation.</P>

<p>"I hope you don't mind my interrupting your lunch," he
said, addressing Grant. "I didn't see you on Saturday at Chadleigh Norton, and
there were one or two things I wanted to speak to you about. When may I come
and see you?"</P>

<p>"Any afternoon," said Grant.</P>

<p>This little visit was surprising. Carl Ballin and he were
merely on nodding terms, and Grant suspected another motive for the
interruption. Ballin had come boldly to challenge the girl's identity. Little
more was said. With an exchange of commonplaces Ballin went back to his table.
The girl looked at Grant.</P>

<p>"He came here to discover whether I recognised his voice,"
she said.</P>

<p>"Exactly what I was thinking," replied the other. "Do you
know, I am rather scared about you."</P>

<p>"Scared?" she repeated.</P>

<p>He nodded.</P>

<p>"We are up against a very terrible and unscrupulous
combination," he said. "I am almost sorry you have the code book you speak of,
and doubly sorry that you have memorised a part of it and that they are aware
of the fact."</P>

<p>"It's perfectly innocent really--the code book, I mean," she
smiled. "There is some of it, of course, which is obviously intended to convey
news of the movements of troops, but a great deal is quite unintelligible to
me."</P>

<p>Grant took his cigarette case out of his pocket, pushed his
coffee cup forward for replenishment, and slowly selected a cigarette.</P>

<p>"It is the fact that they know you do not understand the
unintelligible portion of the code," he said quietly, "that saves your
life."</P>

<p>They were not to finish their t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
without interruption. Presently the bulky figure of Mr. Massey rose
from his table and moved across the room with a certain ponderous dignity,
becoming in a man of his parts. He, too, must be introduced (and heartily
cursed for his boorishness by Grant Macrae), and must seat himself without
invitation. Assuming that air of fatherliness which was in keeping, as he
imagined, with his age and position, he turned a waggish glance upon the
girl.</P>

<p>"Don't let Mr. Macrae poison your mind about Germany," he
warned jovially. "He's a very terrible man."</P>

<p>The girl's polite smile encouraged him to continue.</P>

<p>"He's looking for war all the time," he said. "Good
Heavens! One would think we hadn't enough of the beastly thing. I suppose you
know," he said, directing his conversation to Grant, and taking a more serious
tone, "that we are entertaining the Burgomasters of all the principal German
towns next week?"</P>

<p>"I heard something about it," said Grant. "Are they
entertaining them in France too?" he added innocently.</P>

<p>Mr. Massey frowned.</P>

<p>"There was some suggestion," he said, "but really these
French people are very prejudiced. I like the French enormously, and in fact I
do quite a big trade with them. But their best friends must admit they are
prejudiced."</P>

<p>"Are the Belgian people as prejudiced?" asked Grant
drill.</P>

<p>Mr. Massey snorted.</P>

<p>"No, they won't join us in the scheme, which is distinctly
unfriendly."</P>

<p>"Ah!" said Grant. "They're prejudiced too. You see, they
had the Germans in their country. They had their homes burnt and their citizens
slaughtered in batches; they saw their women and children submitted to horrible
treatment; they have their maimed to remind them--maimed buildings and maimed
people; they have their war babies too," he said in a lower tone, and glancing
at the other through half-closed eyes. "Poor little brutes, that came unwanted
into the world, with hateful Belgian mothers and unknown German fathers. That's
the sort of thing that feeds the prejudice of the people of Belgium and helps
the villages of the Meuse to remember that war isn't a game but a damnable and
hellish thing."</P>

<p>He did not apologise to the girl for the warmth of his
language, and she would have liked him less if he had.</P>

<p>"No, no," he went on, "I am not going to help to entertain
your Burgomasters. My father helped to entertain Prince Henry of Prussia when
he came to England at the outbreak of war, and took a motor-car to every
strategic point to discover the lay of the land. If I have my way, and if the
influence of my paper can do anything, you won't be able to take your German
Burgomasters through the city in broad daylight."</P>

<p>"You don't mean that you're going to organise opposition?"
gasped Mr. Massey.</P>

<p>Grant nodded.</P>

<p>"That's exactly what I do mean," he said coolly. "It is
your job and the job of your friends to keep your indecent friendships to
yourself. If you parade them in the light of day, you are going to get all the
bricks that are coming your way."</P>

<p>"It will be an outrage," said Mr. Massey severely. "It will
be the most discourteous thing that has ever been done in this country. Haven't
you the bigness to appreciate courage in others? Aren't you large-minded
enough to offer the hand of friendship to a beaten enemy?"</P>

<p>"If he was beaten, yes," said Grant, "but he isn't
beaten--not by a long chalk. Listen to me!" He thumped the table before him and
thrust his face closer to that of the older man. "We never felt war in England.
We sent our sons and our brothers, and some of us sent our fathers, to a
strange and distant place which was as remote from here as Piccadilly Circus is
remote from rural quiet. We never felt war or smelt it or heard it. We had a
bomb or two drop. The people thought that was an amusing game, especially those
people who did not lose any friends by these murders. What did the war prove to
you? if it didn't prove that the German respects neither God nor man, that he
has no more regard for his solemn obligations or his treaties than he has for
that"--he snapped his fingers--"then you're a singularly dull man. He has signed
a Peace Treaty. He has undertaken to do many things, some of which he has done.
If it suits him, he will carry out his promise. If it does not suit him he will
break his promise--that is all. There is nothing in the world that is going to
coerce him into taking a line which is inimical to his interests."</P>

<p>"What about the English Fleet?" asked Mr. Massey solemnly.
"What about the great numbers of men who are trained to arms, now scattered
through the country, and ready to come at duty's call?"</P>

<p>"Fudge!" said Grant Macrae contemptuously. "Ten years ago.
What effort has been made to keep them together? None. And as to the Navy,
hasn't Germany got a Navy too?"</P>

<p>"Half the size of ours," said Mr. Massey triumphantly.
"That was one of the clauses in the Treaty, that Germany should only build one
to our two."</P>

<p>"I'll allow the number," said Grant, with a faint smile,
"but you'll admit that, though it is only half the size of the British Navy, it
is a pretty efficient one. You'll admit that its submarines are perhaps the
best in the world, and that the German is trained to their use."</P>

<p>"I'll admit anything if you'll admit that we have such an
overpowering preponderance of ships and guns and men trained in naval service
that the German can never hope to gain a victory on the sea."</P>

<p>"That we shall know more about in a few years' time," said
Grant cryptically.</P>

<p>"You are very uncharitable," said Mr. Massey, rising. "You
will not allow a single good quality or attribute in the Germans. Whatever you
may think, my view is that in the war they did wonderfully."</P>

<p>"They did more wonderfully than we ever expected," said
Grant. "They did so wonderfully that they nearly had the world at their feet,
with the jack boots of Prussian militarism on its neck. Nobody knows better
than I how wonderfully they did, and nobody fears more than I a renewal of
their attempt to outdo that wonder."</P>

<p>He stopped the flow of Massey's rising eloquence.</P>

<p>"When we finished with Germany we yielded to the clamour of
their friends in this country, and we left them their Navy and their royal
house. We left these in defiance of all the views of the Admiralty."</P>

<p>"We took their Colonies," interrupted Mr. Massey. "Don't
forget that. We took every Colony they had."</P>

<p>"Why did we take them?" asked Grant quickly. "We took them
because we had the Fleet to take them. We held out our hands and they fell in.
There was no great credit in taking their Colonies, in spite of the resistance
they put up in East Africa and the Cameroons and German South-West. Don't you
realise, man, what that signified? It signified that the nation with the Fleet
is the nation with the Colonies. What we have taken, they can take back as
easily, the moment their Fleet is on anything like equal terms with ours."</P>

<p>"That will never be," said Mr. Massey firmly. "The
Government which restricted our shipbuilding programme would be kicked out."</P>

<p>Grant looked at him scornfully.</P>

<p>"There are moments, Mr. Massey," he said, "when I wonder
how you came to make so large a fortune." Mr. Massey carried this saying back
to his table to ponder upon, and in his own peculiar way interpreted what was
undoubtedly a most offensive remark into a compliment.</P>

<p>They talked a little while longer, and then Grant looked at
his watch.</P>

<p>"Heavens!" he said in consternation. "I promised Sir John
that I'd do a little commission for him. Would you mind if I ran away?"</P>

<p>"If that isn't a polite excuse for making your exit," she
smiled, "I am going too, and I will drop you anywhere you wish."</P>

<p>In the car the conversation turned upon Sir John.</P>

<p>"There are people who think he's quite mad," said Grant.
"For my own part, I am satisfied that lie is a brilliant genius."</P>

<p>"In what direction are his experiments being made?"</P>

<p>"In the only direction that matters," was the startling
reply. "He is working on a submarine detector. Exactly the details of the
invention I do not know, but the Admiralty have made several tests and are very
pleased. The thing apparently is not wholly developed yet, but so far as I can
make out it is on the lines of a submarine signalling apparatus, and includes a
very sensitive microphone, which apparently responds only to the sound which is
made by propellers. That is the invention as I knew it a few months ago. It has
probably been entirely revolutionised by now. You can often see old Sir John
and Tom Carrington pulling out to the centre of Bank Bay, towing a curious and
weird contrivance. But Tom, with his revolver and his spasmodic shooting,
offers no inducement to the curious investigator."</P>

<p>He made his call at a large electrical stores in Queen
Victoria Street, and the girl waited, and dropped him at the door of his office
in the Strand.</P>

<p>"You're to go straight home," he said to her, "and for the
moment drop your investigations until I can give you more help than I can just
now. I'll say this to you," he went on, his hand resting upon the door of the
car and his strong face turned to her, "I think you're on the right track. I am
certain that there is trouble afoot. If you would care to work with me, either
on the paper, or in separate investigations, I will give you what help I can in
return for whatever help you may give me. Is that a bargain?" She held out her
hand.</P>

<p>"It's a bet," she said.</P>

<br>
<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">THE contents-bills of the newspapers told of the
<span class="smcap">"End of the Dixmude affair."</span></P>

<p>Ten years before, this phrase would have had another
significance; but now the public interest in Dixmude centred round a dispute
between a foreign and a British contractor who had both supplied, apparently
according to order, certain materials and rebuilt certain houses, the one with
authority and the other without, and the matter had excited no little attention
on the Continent, where it was thought the foreign contractor was being
unfairly treated, and the decision in the action which subsequently ensued had
been eagerly awaited. It was just at this time that the feeling between Great
Britain and her neighbours had become slightly strained, a development for
which Belgium had been the more or less innocent cause.</P>

<p>Certain antipathies had been created in the early days of
the war which had antagonised the Belgian population. Huge posters had been
posted at all the street comers of the Belgian towns in those electric days of
August, 1914, containing flamboyant promises on behalf of an allied Government,
"that not a single German foot should violate the territory of Belgium"; and
when, on top of this, the country had been overrun by the enemy, nobody had
taken the trouble to explain that the posters merely contained extracts from an
irresponsible newspaper, and the impression had been allowed to grow that these
placards indeed had been a Government proclamation, and that the Government
concerned had broken faith. This misunderstanding had grown to be a legend, and
when, at the conclusion of the war, British financiers put their money into
Belgian property, and assisted, with money, material and labour, to
re-establish the battered homes of Britain's little Ally, a new situation was
created.</P>

<p>Our ally required all her resources to clear up the mess
the Germans had made in the north and in the east of France, and had no time or
money to spare, for the moment, for Belgium.</P>

<p>Nor was it possible, with her industries half ruined, for
France to lay her hands upon the share of Belgian trade which was rightly hers.
Britain, untouched by war, her industries unimpaired, her machinery still
moving in its well-oiled slides, albeit a little slower, could throw into
Belgium her surpluses and could, without any competition, secure the bulk of
Belgium's trade. France had resented the cry of "business as usual" which had
been raised in the course of the war, and now the critics saw another instance
of unfair competition.</P>

<p>Bruised and crippled as she was by the war, there were a
thousand unseen and unknown influences at work to make the sore rankle more
than it did. "Business as usual" became a contemptuous phrase to signify
advantage gained at your friend's expense during his preoccupation. It was not
difficult to trace these influences, which went systematically to work to stir
up feeling between France and her Ally. Every month, it seemed, new newspapers
were coming into existence in the towns of France--newspapers admirably planned
and possessing the most excellent news service, which had as their <I>raison
d'être</I>, as far as could be seen, the task of educating public opinion in
France to a new view of Great Britain.</P>

<p>This propaganda had been cleverly devised, so cleverly that
its growth had not been observed until public opinion had been definitely
formed. There came a time when the British realised, with a shock, that they
were almost unpopular in a country where they had hoped to establish bonds of
friendship which would survive any and every trial.</P>

<p>With Russia, this method of isolating Britain had not
succeeded. Russia was still recuperating from a war in which she had suffered
enormous losses, and from which she had emerged with new and difficult
problems. The settlement of Poland, the administration of her new territories,
the two-century-old Jewish question--all these combined to occupy her every
moment. The attempt which Germany had made to create friction between Great
Britain and Russia had been made when the terms of peace had come to be
discussed. It was then, through the neutral countries, that England was
importuned to lend her weight against the Russian occupation of new territory.
The danger of the Dardanelles being in the hands of Russia was urgently pointed
out, the need which would exist for an increase of strength in the
Mediterranean to meet the "Russian peril," all these were vividly sketched; but
the Allies were firm upon this point.</P>

<p>Those neutral Balkan nations which had come into the war
area after Russia had accomplished the bulk of work on the Eastern side, had
added their voice to demand the internationalisation of Constantinople and the
Dardanelles, but without success. This was all to the good, and if Germany
delayed any further effort until the Russian Army had recuperated, the danger
to Great Britain was considerably reduced.</P>

<p>The terms of peace had left Germany with a Navy one-half
the size of that which Britain possessed. A clause in the Treaty of Copenhagen
had laid down the future shipbuilding programmes of the German Empire, and
Germany had agreed that one German to every two new British warships should be
the ratio of her shipbuilding progress.</P>

<p>Of late, however, there had been one or two disturbing
happenings brought to the attention of the British Government. Though any
increase in Germany's shipbuilding programme was a <I>causus belli</I>, with
the fluxion of time the Government had grown tolerant of slight deviations from
the accepted programme.</P>

<p>When the new 17-inch guns had been fitted to the <I>Ersatz-Wilhelm II.</I>,
instead of the 15-inch guns, which were originally designed,
the Foreign Office had addressed only the mildest protest--a mildness for which
Admiralty experts were in the main responsible, for it was not believed at that
time that the German 17-inch gun was a better weapon than the British 15-
inch.</P>

<p>There were other illegal additions, too.</P>

<p>Sir John Venniman, sitting at breakfast at Chadleigh
Norton, was carefully reading a German newspaper. There was a pile of these on
a chair by his side. His shirt was, as usual, collarless and open at the
throat, and he wore the stained old suit and the carpet slippers which
constituted his normal attire.</P>

<p>Yet, despite this untidiness, he was a cleanly looking old
man, ruddy, and in his alertness almost birdlike. He had a flood of comments
upon men and things which was seemingly inexhaustible. His companion, who sat
at the opposite side of the table, a profound expression on his face, was
endeavouring to follow the erratic reasoning of his employer and friend.</P>

<p>"Years ago, Tom," said Sir John, "there was a Queen of
Prussia--or perhaps it was a King, but I think it was a Queen."</P>

<p>"A Kaiseress," suggested Tom.</P>

<p>"There were no Kaiseresses in those days, Tom, or Kaisers
either. Anyway, she would have been called a Kaiserine"--he spelt the word and
Tom repeated the letters carefully.</P>

<p>It was his joy to feel that he was being educated, and in
truth his education had been vastly extended in certain directions by a ten
years' contact with this brilliant old man.</P>

<p>"Anyway, whatever she was, she received permission from
Napoleon to have a standing army of so many thousand and no more. And do you
know what she did, Tom?"</P>

<p>"I'll bet she did something dirty," said Tom, and Sir John
beamed.</P>

<p>"Quite right, my boy, quite right," he said. "She or her
husband raised their standing army of so many thousands, drilled them, got them
ready for war, and dismissed them. Then they raised another army of the same
number, trained them, drilled them, dismissed them. This went on for some time,
Tom, and on the next occasion when Napoleon came up against Prussia he found an
enormous army waiting to receive him--all trained men, trained in batches of so
many thousand, Tom."</P>

<p>"That was artful," said Tom, admiringly.</P>

<p>"And that's what she's going to do now," Sir John went on.
"It isn't a question of Army, it's a question of Navy. Suppose we say she shall
build twenty submarines a year. That means that she shall complete twenty
submarines. Now listen!" He read slowly, translating as he went:</P>
<br>

<p class="newspaper>"A very annoying experience has befallen the Herr Direktor
of the Danzig submarine shipyard. Ten new ships were approaching conclusion
when serious structural faults were discovered, due to a miscalculation of the
designer. Work has been suspended on these under-water boats, and it is feared
that a new design must be laid down. It is estimated that some 60,000,000 marks
has been sacrificed, which at the present moment represents a very serious loss
to the empire."</P>
<br>

<p>The old man put the paper on his knees and glared across
the table through his gold-rimmed glasses.</P>

<p>"Last year, six under-water boats had to be scrapped owing
to the poor quality of the steel. The year before, in three different
shipyards, some five under-water boats of the Vulcan ships were damaged by the
collapse of a shed."</P>

<p>"Serve 'em right," said Tom, approvingly.</P>

<p>"Tom," said Sir John, solemnly, "you're an ass! You ought
to use your brain. What's the good of being a blind man if you can't use your
brain?"</P>

<p>Tom grinned.</P>

<p>"I fixed that new coil of yours yesterday, anyway," he said
quietly.</P>

<p>"So you did, Tom, so you did," Sir John beamed. "Really,
you're a wonderful old blind man. I don't know what I'd do without you. What do
you want now?"</P>

<p>His companion's hands were moving gently over the table in
search of some object.</P>

<p>"My prayer-book," said Tom. "I put it down somewhere."</P>

<p>"You'll lose your head one of these days. I'll bet it's in
your pocket," said Sir John.</P>

<p>The blind man felt in his pockets, and his smile was
broader than ever.</P>

<p>"You're quite right, sir," he said. "You've got eyes enough
for two people, you have. You can see through a chap's pocket like an X-
ray."</P>

<p>He chuckled his amusement, and Sir John joined in the
laughter.</P>

<p>He folded his serviette and rose from the table, walked
quickly to the other end and took the soldier's arm.</P>

<p>"Come on, we'll go into the garden," he said; "let's forget
there are such things as Germans and war and pain in the world."</P>

<p>On a garden seat, amidst a riot of August flowers, the two
men sat, the tall, broad soldier with his fixed gaze turned to the blue sky,
his big hands clasping the worn prayer-book, and the little scientist by his
side. And Sir John talked gently of things that were very beautiful to his
mind, of the wonderful sacrifice which had been made for humanity, and of the
love that was greater than all. And he spoke of his dead son and, without
sorrow, told little stories of his boyhood, of his splendid principles, of the
place which his genius would have made for him in the world. And then he took
the prayer-book from Tom Carrington's hands and read the morning lesson, and at
the end returned the book to the outstretched hand of his servitor. This had
been the routine for ten years. Never a day passed but these two men had
foregathered for their tiny service. They were simple men, strong in faith and
beautiful in mind, loving one another after their strange ways, and closer in
their relationship than father and son or than brother and brother.</P>

<p>The old man rose briskly and took the other's arm, and for
an hour they paced the broad garden walk, and the roar of Tom's laughter
testified to the cheer of their discourse. Noon found the scientist working in
his laboratory, Tom Carrington, patient and silent, sitting by the bench, his
deft fingers piecing together a little machine of extraordinary complexity. It
was marvellous to watch him and to know that he was blind. Sir John, humming as
he worked, was nearing, as he knew, the end of his labours. The apparatus to
the perfection of which he had given ten years of his life, and to create which
he had sacrificed the pursuit of investigations in a branch of science which
had no association with mechanics, was as near perfect as he could make it. The
bench was covered with tiny black spheres, each a little larger than an orange.
Some of these were connected by a thin chain, no thicker than the average
watch-guard. He was busy attaching sphere to sphere. Between every fourth ball
was a
small cigar-shaped object, from which radiated thin steel spikes, until it bore
a resemblance to a porcupine. They were all part of the Venniman submarine
detector, about which so much had been written and upon which so many
speculations had been made. The newspapers had taken a perfunctory interest in
the experiment, and there had been nights when Burnham Head had held a
congregation of journalists, who, straining their eyes toward the dark waters
of the bay, had seen the vivid green flashes which had sprung up from the
water, and which, for the purposes of experiment, had represented no more than
the passage of a small row-boat in the region of these little sentinels. Very
exhaustive details are required if public interest is to be sustained. These
Sir John Venniman was not prepared to give. The Admiralty sent an expert or
two, who were mildly interested. The French Admiralty had asked for further
particulars, and the Russian had sent Captain Slavoveitch to Chadleigh Norton
to secure further information. But for the moment war, and warlike experiments,
were not especially popular in England. People were tired of war and, save
amongst the young and consequently adventurous, it was a subject which produced
a condition of boredom sooner than any other.</P>

<p>Nevertheless, Sir John Venniman had persevered. Discouraged
alike by his brother scientists, who in a solemn manifesto had declared that it
was the duty of science to devote itself now exclusively in the direction of
recuperative experiment, and regarded even by his best friends as suffering
from a mild form of monomania, he went on with his work as though he had the
approval and the moral support of the world.</P>

<p>"War is the mother of invention, Tom," he said on one
occasion, stopping at his work and looking round at the attentive figure by his
side. "If it wasn't for the possibilities of the motor-car as a transport for
troops, support would never have been given to that industry. If aeroplanes had
never been possible engines of war, nobody would have troubled very much about
the Wright Brothers' invention. Railways, steamships, even modern
surgery--they've all been pushed forward by somebody or other, Tom, who had an
eye on war and the use they would be in war."</P>

<p>"Fighting's natural," said Tom, after a pause.</P>

<p>Sir John turned his kindly eyes upon the man and nodded
thoughtfully.</P>

<p>"You never crystallised a greater truth in a shorter
sentence in all your born days," he said. "Fighting's natural. It's as natural
for men to fight as it is for women to have babies."</P>

<p>He put down the little screwdriver with which he had been
pressing home a screw of microscopic size, and surveyed his handiwork.</P>

<p>"I'll tell you another thing, Tom," he said; "the most
intellectual nation, the most cultured nation, and the most civilised nation
will always win in war. That is, if she applies her culture, her civilisation
and her intellect to the proper end, which is the preparation for war. If all
these bright brains will only spare tune to invent war engines which will be
superior to the engines created by less intellectual nations, justice and
culture shall prevail."</P>

<p>"Them Germans ain't cultured," said Tom, after a pause.</P>

<p>The old man smiled grimly.</P>

<p>"Oh yes, they are, Tom. Don't you make any mistake about
that. They've got a kind of culture, but they've developed the wrong way. It
isn't our idea of culture, that's all. The Greeks had culture, the Romans, the
Egyptians, the Persians, the Chinese--they all had got a culture of a kind,
Tom."</P>

<p>He prattled on throughout the morning and, when the lunch
bell rang, he locked the laboratory door and walked arm-in-arm with his
prot&eacute;g&eacute; through the long conservatory which connected the
laboratory with the main building.</P>

<p>Sir John Venniman kept no manservant in the house. His
gardeners occupied the two little lodges which flanked the entrance gate to his
big house. Manor House was in point of fact by far the most pretentious of the
dwellings in Chadleigh Norton. Sir John held certain manorial rights in the
region, and when Sir Max Graaf, acting on behalf of the little community, had
bought up the land, Sir John, while entering into the scheme for establishing
this lordly little village, had definitely refused to sell to the syndicate. He
built Manor House after the new village had been completed, and he differed
from the remainder of Chadleigh Norton's inhabitants in that he was in
permanent residence.</P>

<p>It was exactly a week after Ruth Manton's remarkable
adventure in Chadleigh Norton that the village was again the scene of a
mysterious happening, and this time not without its tragedy.</P>

<p>On that Saturday afternoon, just before sunset, Grant
Macrae, lounging, as was his wont, on the top of the cliff, saw the old man
with his inseparable attendant rowing slowly out to the middle of the bay. In
the stern there was what looked like a black shapeless mass, which, through
Grant's binoculars, bore some resemblance to a huge net. Grant watched
curiously, and when he turned homeward for dinner he threw out a glance to sea
and found that the boat was motionless, and that its occupants had evidently
settled down to wait patiently for the darkness.</P>

<p>So far as could be ascertained from inquiries which he
subsequently made, Sir John Venniman and his man had conducted experiments
which left no doubt in the mind of the scientist as to the efficacy of his
invention. The boat seemed to have come back to land between half-past ten and
eleven at night. The gardener and his assistant were waiting on the beach, and,
having drawn the boat up out of the reach of the tide, the four men returned to
Manor House, the two gardeners carrying between them a part of the apparatus,
and Sir John the more delicate mechanism in a small box under his arm.</P>

<p>Sir John slept in a room looking down on the conservatory,
which separated the house from the laboratory. He went to bed at a quarter-past
twelve, extinguishing the lights, and at a quarter-past two an electric bulb,
which was fixed at the foot of his bed, with the reflector so placed that the
light shone full on his face, was suddenly illuminated.</P>

<p>Sir John, instantly awake, slipped out of bed and pulled on
his dressing-gown. He touched a switch and extinguished the light. To the right
of the window was a small polished box, fixed to the wall. The door of this he
opened and, feeling gingerly for the three switches which were inside, pressed
them over as far as each would go to the right. Almost instantly there came to
his ears a faint tinkle of glass from somewhere outside. He opened the door
which led to the adjoining bedroom, where Tom Carrington had his quarters. A
pressure on the ex-soldier's arm aroused him, and in a few words Sir John
explained.</P>

<p>"Go along to Mr. Macrae," he said, "and tell him I've had
an alarm."</P>

<p>The blind man slipped an overcoat over his pyjamas, pulled
on a cap, and made his way unerringly to Grant's house. Five minutes later
Grant had joined the old man.</P>

<p>"I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Macrae," smiled Sir John.</P>

<p>He was standing in the dining-room, smoking one of those
skimpy and cheap cigarettes which he preferred, and he had utilised the time of
waiting in making himself a cup of tea. He greeted Grant with that air of
unconcern which was peculiarly his own.</P>

<p>"I'm sorry to drag you out of your bed," he said, "but you
were kind enough to write me a week or two ago and tell me that, in case I had
an alarm of any kind, I was to communicate with you, wherever you were."</P>

<p>"What has happened?" asked Grant.</P>

<p>"Somebody's been trying to enter my laboratory. I haven't
been to see yet what has happened to the unfortunate man. If he is in he won't
be able to get out. If he tried to get in after I had my warning, I'm afraid he
will be dead in the grounds."</P>

<p>Sir John took an electric hand lamp from the table, opened
the door of the dining-room and stepped out. Grant followed along the corridor
till they reached a small but very heavy door, which opened to the garden.</P>

<p>"I think you'd better let me take the lamp and go first,"
said Grant.</P>

<p>Sir John shook his head.</P>

<p>"There's no danger, I assure you," he said grimly.</P>

<p>Grant wondered why he was conducting the search outside of
the laboratory rather than from the inside, and presently he was to discover.
The path from the house ran parallel with the conservatory and swept to the
right in a quarter circle, to carry it wide of the laboratory buildings. When
the curve straightened again, it was running less than two feet from the wall
of the many-windowed laboratory. Suddenly Sir John stopped.</P>

<p>"Here we are," he said.</P>

<p>A man lay rigid across the path. Sir John, putting the
light of the lamp in his face, stooped and felt his heart.</P>

<p>"He's still alive," he said, "and he may reckon that he's
very lucky."</P>

<p>He lifted up the man's hands one after the other. Across
the palm ran a livid red mark.</P>

<p>"That is an electric burn," said Sir John. "Let us see
whether he has any papers on him."</P>

<p>There was nothing in the man's clothing, so far as they
could ascertain in a hurried search, to reveal his identity. He was young, not
bad looking, obviously Teutonic, and his close-cropped hair suggested that he
was a member of one of the Imperial German services. He was dressed plainly in
a blue suit.</P>

<p>"Shop made," said Grant, examining it, "and quite new.
Evidently bought for the purpose, and his underclothing is exactly the same, I
should imagine. Is he the only one?"</P>

<p>They made a rapid search of the ground, but could trace no
sign of any other intruder. Together they bore the unconscious man back to the
house, and laid him on the sofa. There was no doctor in the village, so,
pulling off his coat, Grant Macrae began to apply artificial respiration to the
unconscious man, whose breathing had apparently stopped. The grey light of dawn
was struggling through the windows against the artificial light when the man
recovered consciousness. He looked stupidly from one to the other, and muttered
something in German.</P>

<p>"What is your ship, my man?" asked Grant in the same
language.</P>

<p>"<I>Kaiserin Augusta</I>," muttered the man.</P>

<p>"Where are your friends?"</P>

<p>"I don't know. There were three," he began, and then it
slowly dawned upon him that he was being interrogated, and that he was
violating stringent instructions which had been given to him.</P>

<p>"I don't know anything," he said.</P>

<p>The scientist looked at him strangely. "I can make you
talk, my friend," he said pleasantly enough, but with that curious bird-like
twist of his head which in itself suggested aggression. The man glowered up at
him and for a moment their eyes met. Then to the amazement of Grant, he saw in
the face of the German sailor a growing fear that became almost terror.</P>

<p>The professor spoke softly and rapidly, and he spoke, too,
in that slurred southern German which was almost a patois. So fast did he
speak, and so low was his voice, that Grant could not follow, but he saw the
man's lips part and his eyes widen. "You could not, Herr Doctor!" he gasped.
"You would not...."</P>

<p>"You shall see," said Sir John.</P>

<p>There was a pause.</P>

<p>"I will tell you... all I know," muttered the man.</P>

<hr>
<br>
<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">"WHAT inducement did you employ?" asked Grant an hour
later. Sir John put his finger-tips together and regarded them attentively.
"The method I employed was that one which may be described in one
word--frightfulness," he said. "Have you not noticed, my dear Mr. Macrae, that
men and women no less than nations are influenced by the qualities of their own
which they find in others? Thus a beautiful woman is more impressed by beauty
than is a dowd. A courageous man is attracted by courage, and so on. Similarly
a bully is most susceptible to bullying, and a man who utters threats is best
cowed by threats. The German favours a policy of frightfulness, because he
knows in his heart of hearts that if that policy were applied to him he would
knuckle under. Remember the history of the war, how Germany having devastated
Belgium and the North of France was reduced to maudlin tears at the destruction
which the Russian wrought in East Prussia. Any man who knows the German
character could have told the Government during the war that they had but to
threaten the heads of the departments responsible with death by hanging to stop
all the ill-treatment of our prisoners. As to my own little prisoner, I
threatened him with sudden tragic consequences which would follow upon his
refusal to give the information I needed. Those consequences I had not to
invent. I had simply to threaten him with a variety of punishment which was
undoubtedly inflicted upon Russian soldiers by German officers to bring him to
my way of thinking." Grant shuddered.</P>

<p>"I told him exactly the line I should follow, exactly the
character of the inducement I should offer." He shrugged his shoulders. "We
scientists have a large pull with the rest of the world," he said.</P>

<p>"What did you discover?" asked Grant.</P>

<p>The professor smiled.</P>

<p>"What I had expected," he said. "This man came with others
to discover the secret of the submarine protector. Failing their ability to
grasp its essentials, they were to destroy the machine--that is all."</P>

<p>The professor sipped his tea thoughtfully.</P>

<p>"I wonder if they've gone?" he asked.</P>

<p>He turned with his beaming smile upon the blind man, who
sat an attentive listener to all that was going on.</P>

<p>"Tom, my boy," he said, with that bird-like heartiness
which was part of his system, "here is a chance to try your wonderful
invention."</P>

<p>The blind man grinned, and held out his hand. Sir John
edged closer until the groping fingers touched his shoulder, then made for the
door which led to the room upstairs. For a moment Grant hesitated, but Sir John
called to him over his shoulder.</P>

<p>"Come along, and I will show you something which nobody but
myself has ever seen."</P>

<p>They made their way upstairs, the professor leading, passed
the bedroom door, still open, and climbed another flight. The party reached the
roof through a door which opened from the top of a last and steeper flight. It
was part of a somewhat unlovely addition to the original building which had
been made to the old Georgian mansion. Grant found himself in a square
machicolated turret. The professor took from his pocket an electric lamp and
flashed it cautiously on the ground. In one comer of the tower-top was a square
box. He opened this and displayed in the light of the lamp a number of fine
steel cords stretched across.</P>

<p>"We will leave that open," he said, and then turned and
walked to the other comer. He disclosed what appeared to be a small mortar with
a breach of unusual rotundity.</P>

<p>"That's Tom's invention," said Sir John proudly. "A
compressed air-gun, loaded and ready. We always expected an attack from the
sea, didn't we, Tom? We'll try it to-night, Tom!"</P>

<p></P>

<p>He peered out towards the bay, but there was little to be
seen in the black night.</P>

<p>"Come down to my room," he said. They made their way down
again. First they passed to the little study which led off the dining-room. Sir
John took down from a shelf a pair of aluminium receivers from which dangled a
long connecting flex. This he pressed carefully into a plug in the wall and
turned a small switch above the connection.</P>

<p>"Do you understand the Morse code?" he asked.</P>

<p>Grant nodded.</P>

<p>"Put these on your head and listen," said Sir John, "but
wait!" He unlocked his desk, took out a substantial-looking red volume.</P>

<p>"Now go ahead, and tell me what they are saying."</P>

<p>Grant fixed the receivers in some bewilderment. He listened
intently, and for a time heard nothing. Then the unmistakable <i>"click,
click!"</i>
of a wireless Morse message came through.</P>

<p>"M, B, R, Z," he spelt out slowly.</P>

<p>Sir John turned the pages rapidly.</P>

<p>"Here we are," he said. "'Put to sea, attempt failed.'"</P>

<p>The blind man sitting in the corner chuckled amusedly.</P>

<p>"I should say so!" he said half to himself.</P>

<p>Again the ticking sounded in Grant's ears.</P>

<p>"O, V, Q, M," he spelt.</P>

<p>Sir John's nimble fingers turned the pages of the closely
set book.</P>

<p>"Yes, 'We are in danger from shore,'" he said with some
glee.</P>

<p>Again a four-letter message came to the journalist, and
again he spelt it out.</P>

<p>"'Shall I shell position?'--we are the position," said Sir
John looking up over his glasses. Again, and promptly, came the reply.</P>

<p>"R, Z, A, R," repeated Grant.</P>

<p>The old man ran his fingers down the page.</P>

<p>"Here it is," he said, "'No, we are attracting attention.'"
He looked around triumphantly. "This is where we try Tom's gun."</P>

<p>He dropped the book in the desk, and locked the desk in
almost one motion, crossed the dining-room, and threw back the long
shutters.</P>

<p>"Now, Tom!" he said.</P>

<p>Grant saw nothing. He heard the faint snap of a button. Tom
had put into operation the invention of which he was so proud. There was no
report, only a strange whining sound came to the men at the open window. Then
suddenly over the bay there burst a brilliant white light which illuminated the
scene as though it were day.</P>

<p>"There they are!" said Grant, pointing.</P>

<p>Three ships, two of which were obviously warships, were
steaming out of the bay. The light lasted for twenty seconds before it suddenly
disappeared leaving the world blacker than ever.</P>

<p>"That's Tom's invention," chuckled Sir John. "A gun fired
by compressed air and its shell ignited by friction--I tell you, Tom is a clever
fellow!"</P>

<p>"What have you done with the prisoner?" asked Grant after a
while.</P>

<p>"He's safe till the morning. The difficulty will be," Sir
John went on, a little gravely, "to explain him away. It is not my purpose to
announce him and his attempt to the police."</P>

<p>At that moment there was the faint tinkle of a bell.</P>

<p>Sir John looked at his visitor guiltily.</P>

<p>"I am afraid we have awakened the village. Go and find out
who that is, Tom," he said.</P>

<p>Tom left the room, and came back in a few moments, and
there was in his face a look of such deadly malignity as surprised even
Grant.</P>

<p>"What is it, Tom?" asked the Professor.</P>

<p>"German," growled the man.</P>

<p>"A German?" repeated Sir John, puzzled, and then he
realised who the visitor was.</P>

<p>"Ah, it's Mr. Baffin. Tell Mr. Baffin to come in, Tom, and
take that look off your ugly old face."</P>

<p>A minute later Carl Baffin strolled into the room. Grant
noticed that he was completely dressed--a circumstance which was astounding in
view of the hour.</P>

<p>"Your firework display woke me up, Sir John," he said
easily. "I thought I would come along and discover what all the trouble was
about."</P>

<p>"The trouble, my dear Mr. Ballin," said Sir John, his head
askew and observing the other keenly, "was caused by one of your excellent
compatriots who endeavoured to break into my laboratory and was caught."</P>

<p>"Caught, was he?" said Carl quickly. "What did you do with
him--is he dead?"</P>

<p>"He is alive and quite safe in an empty tool-shed," said
Sir John.</P>

<p>"Are you sure he is German?" asked the other
incredulously.</P>

<p>"Bavarian, I should think," was Sir John's answer. "The
southern German speaks a little more thickly than his northern compatriot."</P>

<p>"Can I see him?" asked Ballin abruptly.</P>

<p>Sir John smiled. His bright eyes never left the other's
face.</P>

<p>"I'm afraid that's impossible," he said.</P>

<p>"Perhaps I could discover what his object was--a drunken
fellow's freak, I should imagine," persisted Carl.</P>

<p>Sir John smiled again.</P>

<p>"I think I know what it is all about," he said easily. "He
has told me quite a great deal--and he is perfectly sober."</P>

<p>Grant, watching the man closely, saw his brows knit in a
sudden frown. He saw, too, the perfect self-control which the German exercised
to recover himself from a fit of sudden anger.</P>

<p>"I expect he has told you a great deal of nonsense," he
said carelessly; and then turning to Grant, "You have a very late visitor, Mr.
Macrae."</P>

<p>"Late visitor," replied Grant, in his turn surprised. "I
was not aware that I had any visitors, early or late."</P>

<p>Carl Ballin shrugged his shoulders.</P>

<p>"Perhaps I have made a mistake; I saw a car outside your
house as I passed."</P>

<p>"A car?"</P>

<p>Ballin nodded.</P>

<p>Grant turned to Sir John.</P>

<p>"You won't want me any more to-night, Sir John."</P>

<p>"I think not," replied Sir John with a smile. "Tom and I
can deal with any crisis which may arise between now and morning."</P>

<p>Grant left the house with Ballin. They turned and walked
together along the broad village street. Yes, there were the lights of the car
in front of his house. Grant hastened his steps and came up to the car, peering
through the darkness in an endeavour to recognise the chauffeur.</P>

<p>"Good morning, sir," said the man; "did Miss Manton meet
you?"</P>

<p>"Miss Manton?" said Grant quickly.</P>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the man; "she came down from town in the
night on a very urgent matter; they told her at your house that you had gone on
to Sir John's."</P>

<p>Grant turned quickly on his companion.</P>

<p>"Did you see anything of this lady?" he asked.</P>

<p>Ballin hesitated.</P>

<p>"I--thought I saw somebody," he said slowly, "but I wasn't
quite sure who it was. I thought possibly it was one of the Miss Masseys,
aroused by the firework display which Sir John gave us."</P>

<p>"She may have returned to the house," said Grant, but
inquiries there did not produce any news of the missing girl. Until daylight he
pursued a fruitless search for her. At the coming of day Grant made his way
down to the beach, for here it was that he had first seen her, and for this
reason he always associated her in his mind with this strip of foreshore. He
was retracing his steps after a profitless search, bewildered and not a little
troubled, when something in the bushes by the side of the path which led up to
the beach, attracted his attention.</P>

<p>He pulled aside the boughs and gasped.</P>

<p>What he saw was a lady's shoe, and one which was scarcely
worn.</P>

<p>New as it was, the patent leather was covered with
scratches. They were not ordinary scratches, and he turned the shoe over and
over in his hand wondering what his discovery indicated.</P>

<p>Then like a flash, he saw.</P>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">SOMEBODY had scratched, evidently with a sharp pebble, four
words on the shiny surface of the shoe. He puzzled them out, for they had been
written in a hurry.</P>

<p>"Ballin. ship. pris. German."</P>

<p>Brief as the message was it was as clear as daylight what
had happened.</P>

<p>Ballin had been responsible for her capture; she had been
seized, taken on board a ship a prisoner, and by this time was on her way to
Germany.</P>

<p>Grant was alone.</P>

<p>Ballin had gone off to his house before daybreak.</P>

<p>Grant slipped the shoe in his pocket, strode up the hill,
through the village street, turning in at the gate of Sir Max Graaf's ornate
residence. The servants were still up. Mr. Ballin was in the morning room they
told him, and there Grant found him.</P>

<p>He was sitting at his ease, a cup of coffee on the table
beside him, and he rose as Grant entered with a little inclination of his head.
Grant was very white but cool. He closed the door behind him and walked
steadily over to where Carl stood.</P>

<p>"Where is Miss Manton?" he asked quickly.</P>

<p>Carl raised his eyebrows.</P>

<p>"I don't quite understand what you mean," he said.</P>

<p>"I'll explain," replied the other without raising his
voice. "Last night you and some of your friends kidnapped Miss Manton, carried
her down to the beach, put her on board one of the steamers that were lying in
the bay, and she is now on her way to Germany."</P>

<p>Only for an instant was Ballin taken back.</P>

<p>Grant saw the rapid flicker of eyes which betrayed a
momentary embarrassment, but for the second time that morning the German
recovered himself.</P>

<p>"My dear chap," he said, "verily you must have been reading
one of your feuilletons, and the romantic story has got into your brain. I have
not seen Miss Manton, and it is not my practice to kidnap young ladies in the
middle of the night, any more," he added pointedly, "than it is my practice to
receive visitors of the opposite sex at that period."</P>

<p>Grant ignored the sneer.</P>

<p>"You must find Miss Manton," he said, "or--"</P>

<p>"Or?"</P>

<p>There was no mistaking the challenge in the other's tone.</P>

<p>Carl Ballin saw the eyes of his visitor narrow and the face
harden. He dropped his hand quickly to his pocket, but not quickly enough.</P>

<p>At that moment Grant was on him, his sinewy hand at his
throat, his other hand grasping Carl's wrist. A quick jerk and the German was
flung back in his chair, a knee was on his chest, and the revolver which he had
drawn, wrenched from his hand.</P>

<p>"I give you exactly two minutes to tell me what has
happened to Miss Manton," said Grant between his teeth, "and if at the end of
that time you refuse to answer, by God, I'll strangle you." There was a dead
silence for some moments, and then Ballin spoke.</P>

<p>"Since my life is of some value to the State," he drawled,
yet despite his nonchalance Grant noticed a certain tremour in his voice, "and
I have a premonition that you will keep your word, I will tell you all that I
can tell you. Your young friend intruded herself upon an innocent party of
sailors who had come ashore for a jaunt, and she might have been unpleasantly
treated had it not been for my intervention. As far as I know she went on board
the <I>Prague</I>--"</P>

<p>He stopped short and bit his lip.</P>

<p>"She went on board the <I>Prague,"</I> repeated Grant.</P>

<p>"When I said <I>Prague</I>," said the other with a shrug of
the shoulders, "I meant--"</P>

<p>"You meant <I>Prague</I>," said Grant shortly. "Tell me
what happened to this lady whom you saved from a jaunting party of sailors who
landed at midnight miles from the nearest town, and who are so rowdy that even
the coastguards were unaware of their presence. Go on, please."</P>

<p>"It isn't much use my going on," said Ballin sullenly, "if
you are not prepared to believe me. As far as I know, she went on board the
ship to lodge a complaint against the men and probably the Captain of the
<I>Essenburg</I>."</P>

<p>"You said <I>Prague</I> a little while ago, but that does
not matter," interrupted Grant. "She went on board the <I>Essenburg</I> to
lodge a complaint, did she? And how does it happen, Ballin, that you knew what
ships they belonged to?"</P>

<p>"Oh, that's easy," said the other carelessly, "I saw the
ribbons on their hats."</P>

<p>Grant nodded.</P>

<p>"I think much of what you have told me is a lie. There is
one detail you have given me quite unwillingly for which I am greatly obliged.
If any harm comes to Miss Manton through you or your damned government, one of
the biggest coups you have ever planned will come sadly undone. Good
morning."</P>

<p>He walked out of the house slamming the door behind him.
His car which had been engaged all that night in searching the roads leading in
and out of Chudleigh Norton was waiting in the road, and he sprang in. London
was only just awake when his car flashed through the streets. He knew only one
member of the Cabinet intimately and that was Lord Arthur Matheson. Matheson
was one of those individuals whose views on the international situation the
<I>Megaphone</I> echoed. The Admiralty quarters were undergoing repair and
Matheson would be at his house at Buckingham Gate, and thither Grant drove.</P>

<p>He had some difficulty in persuading the servants to awaken
the first lord, but after a quarter of an hour's wait, the minister, arrayed in
pyjamas and dressing gown, came into the drawing room to meet him.</P>

<p>Lord Arthur made no complaint at being aroused from his bed
at this--for him--unearthly hour. He knew Grant Macrae well enough to realise
that nothing but the most serious business would have induced him to call at
such a time. Briefly Grant related the events of the previous evening, and the
first lord listened in silence, interposing a question now and again. When
Grant had finished, Matheson spoke.</P>

<p>"It will be a fortunate circumstance if she is on the
<I>Prague,"</I> he said, "and not upon one of the warships. The <I>Prague</I>
is a fairly fast cruiser which was engaged in mine-laying in the late war. She
no longer appears on the auxiliary cruiser list, and is supposed to have been
converted into a yacht for the use of one of the Hamburg-American directors.
Just wait one moment."</P>

<p>He disappeared from the room and was gone ten minutes, at
the end of which time he returned carrying an envelope closed by a heavy seal.
"I am sorry to have kept you, but I had to do some coding," he smiled; "take
this round to the Admiralty to the wire room, and hand it to the officer in
charge."</P>

<br>
<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">AT half-past ten in the morning Lloyds' agents at Dungeness
reported the movement of a German warship northward. At eleven o'clock another
warship passed, steaming up-channel, and exactly half an hour later a
yacht-like liner went past displaying no number. The signal man might not have
recognised her, but two naval officers who were watching with him had no doubt
as to her identity and a wireless in code was flashed to Dover.</P>

<p>After passing Dungeness, the <I>Prague</I> took an easterly
course as though she were making for Boulogne or Dunkirk.</P>

<p>But she had altered her course too late.</P>

<p>In the channel she came up with <I>Arethusa</I> and
<I>Undaunted</I>, steaming slowly across her course. A string of flags went up
from <I>Arethusa,</I> and the captain of the <I>Prague</I> had no difficulty in
translating the message into, "Heave to, I am coming aboard you."</P>

<p>In reply <I>Prague</I> signalled her number, and continued
on her way.</P>

<p>There was a flash and a bang from <I>Arethusa,</I> a
ricocheting shell flung up in the water before the steamer, and the captain of
the German boat with an oath rang his engines astern.</P>

<p>The officers on the bridge of the <I>Arethusa</I> watched
the man&#339;oeuvre and grinned.</P>

<p>"He is making a signal," said one, and put up his
telescope. There was no difficulty in recognising the familiar combination.</p>

<p>"'We have infectious disease aboard'" read the officer, and there was a
derisive guffaw.</p>

<p>"Signal her," said the skipper of the <I>Arethusa</I>, "we are
sending a doctor on board!"</P>

<p>A little steam pinnace raced out to the side of the German
boat, a nimble lieutenant scrambled up the monkey ladder, and was followed by
two blue-jackets. The captain met his interceptors in that arrogant spirit
which has made the north Prussian skipper the least lovable of his kind.</P>

<p>"This is an outrage, gentlemen," he stormed; "one would
think we were still at war--you shall hear of this from my government."</P>

<p>"I can assure you, sir," said the bland lieutenant of the
Royal Navy against whom this terrible threat was launched, "that nobody regrets
inconveniencing you more than myself. You are bound for Bremen, I presume."</P>

<p>"I am bound for Hamburg," said the captain shortly.</P>

<p>"From?"</P>

<p>"From Bilboa," replied the captain. "My papers are in
order, if you wish to see them. But I shall require an explanation as to why
you have taken this unusual step."</P>

<p>The young officer bowed.</P>

<p>"I will offer you all the explanation that is necessary,
captain," he said, "when I tell you that we have reason to believe that a very
dangerous criminal stowed himself away on your ship at Bilboa. The right to
search," he went on oracularly, "is a moot and contestable point. I must take
the responsibility for intruding on you," he said.</P>

<p>"Suppose I refuse," said the captain.</P>

<p>The officer shrugged his shoulders with an exaggerated
gesture of despair.</P>

<p>"In that case, Herr Captain, it would be my business to
blow you off the face of the sea." The German captain's face was symptomatic of
an approaching attack of apoplexy.</P>

<p>"You may search the ship," he said surlily, "but I can
assure you that not only will you fail to discover your criminal, but if my
government has any spirit left, your days in the Navy are numbered."</P>

<p>The search was a long and exhaustive one, but it failed to
discover its object. After an hour's systematic investigation, in the course of
which every cabin was searched and even the bunks were explored, a puzzled
young officer returned to the deck.</P>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said the captain, "have you found the
lady?"</P>

<p>He recognised his error in a flash, and could have bitten
his tongue.</P>

<p>"The lady?" said the officer slowly, searching the man's
face; "who said anything about ladies?"</P>

<p>"I--I!" stammered the captain.</P>

<p>"By the way, skipper," said the officer suddenly, "I
haven't inspected your cabin." He saw the look of alarm that flickered
momentarily in the man's eyes.</P>

<p>"She is hardly likely to be there, is she?" said the German
with heavy jocularity.</P>

<p>"We will see," said the officer.</P>

<p>A steward led the way to the cabin, large and roomy, a big
bunk in the comer of the room, a desk, a lounge, and a big tall-boy comprised
the furniture. The officer looked round the room carefully.</P>

<p>"What is in here?" he asked, and he tapped with his stick
the boarded space beneath the captain's bunk. Usually this space is occupied by
chests of drawers in which a skipper keeps his wardrobe. In this case the
tallboy in one corner of the cabin evidently served this purpose. "There is
nothing
in there," said the captain, who had followed the party into the cabin. The
naval officer stooped and examined the wooden partition. There were a number of
little holes bored at intervals, and the sharp eye detected two chips of wood
upon the carpet.</P>

<p>Assuredly those holes had been recently made.</P>

<p>"I want this opened," he said.</P>

<p>"It doesn't open," said the captain.</P>

<p>"Then I want it broken down," said the officer shortly.</P>

<p>Nobody made a move. He called the British bluejacket who
stood at the door.</P>

<p>"Break this in," he said, and with two blows with the butt
of his rifle the man drove in the thin match-boarding. The officer pulled away
the shattered woodwork.</P>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" he said, and inserting his arm, he drew out
the half-unconscious girl who was lying on a mattress at the bottom of the
recess. The officer lifted the girl, and with two strokes of his knife severed
her bonds. The gag, which was no more than a respirator of the old war days,
was off in a second.</P>

<p>"Put this lady in the pinnace," said the officer sharply,
and the big bluejacket lifted the girl up in his arms as though she were a
child, and walked from the cabin. For the moment there was no word spoken. The
officer's chin was on his chest, and he was evidently thinking; then slowly he
raised his head and met the eyes of the German.</P>

<p>"Are you an officer in the Imperial Navy?" he asked, with
great deliberation.</P>

<p>"I have that honour," said the other stiffly. The words
were scarcely out of his mouth before the naval man struck him full in the
face. "If you can possibly arrange a meeting without outraging the official
sense of propriety," he said calmly, "I will give you every satisfaction for
that blow," and turning on his heel, he left the cabin.</P>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Grant was waiting at Dover and was the first of the
civilian visitors to the <I>Arethusa</I>. The girl, who had made a rapid
recovery, had little to tell. She had been seized on her way to Sir John's
house by somebody who she thought she recognised as Ballin, but as to this she
was not sure. She had had time to scratch a message on her shoe--and only time.
She had apparently, been treated with some consideration on board the
<I>Prague</I>, and it was not until the British warship had been sighted that
she had been bound and concealed.</P>

<p>"I have given everybody a lot of trouble," she said,
smiling ruefully, "and I am afraid none more than you."</P>

<p>She looked up at Grant's face, and there was something in
his drawn mouth and sunken eyes which told her more plainly than words the
agony he had endured.</P>

<p>It was a something which sent a thrill of joy to her heart
and compensated her far more than she could ever have expected to have been
compensated, for the discomfort and terror under which she had lain during the
past twelve hours. She tried to say something apposite, but found herself
indulging in the most absurd of banalities. Thereafter she lapsed into silence
which Grant made no attempt to break. They scarcely spoke in the journey to
London, and it was not until the taxi had deposited her at the door of her
hotel that she regained her self-possession.</P>

<p>"Have I been a great nuisance," she said again.</P>

<p>"You are a great responsibility," he answered gravely.</P>

<p>There was a mischievous quality in her smile.</P>

<p>"I suppose," she bantered him, "you feel like my father and
my mother."</P>

<p>"Hardly that," he answered slowly. "I feel rather as though
I were your lover."</P>

<p>She felt the blood rush to her face, stammered a few
incoherent words, and, snatching her hand away, disappeared into the hotel.
Grant waited a little time, then re-entering his taxi was driven off to his
office.</P>

<hr>
<br>
<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">MR. HOLMAN MASSEY, that pompous man, was not easily
depressed. He was one of those fortunate souls who owned to neither temperament
nor diffidence. He had the ability of interpreting the most unmistakable of
rebuffs into humorous but not ill-natured expressions of respect. He had
assurance, based on an illusion as to his own qualities, and an unimaginable
reverence for the power of money which only those men possess who satisfy their
requirements in the open market. Mr. Massey had for his comfort all that money
could buy--and nothing else.</P>

<p>He had cause for grievance against Grant Macrae, for Macrae
had utterly spoilt the civic welcome to the Burgomasters which Mr. Massey had
organised as secretaire.</P>

<p>"The dastardly attack," here I quote Mr. Massey, which
Grant Macrae and his journal had made upon the Burgomasters and which was
responsible, no doubt, for the coolness of their reception, and for the fact
that several civic bodies in England had cancelled their reception, had made
but a momentary impression on Mr. Massey's mind.</P>

<p>Mr. Massey's mind was frequently described by himself as
broad, by which he meant that he was one of a large body of men who are willing
to forgive a kick if there was a fair chance of their assailant proving useful
in the future. Mr. Massey's breadth of mind enabled him to agree with
diametrically opposite points of view when they were expressed on separate
occasions by two or more people who were likely to be of service to him. If by
ill-fortune Mr. Massey found himself confronted with the problem of giving his
view upon the subject in the presence of influential but rival exponents, Mr.
Massey's mind was described by himself as "open."</P>

<p>He strolled into Grant Macrae's private office in the late
days of June, and Grant, who had had a hard day's work and was willing to be
bored, tolerated the intruder.</P>

<p>"I want to let bygones be bygones, Mr. Macrae," said
Massey, imposingly, "we are neighbours and I trust friends."</P>

<p>He paused and Grant obligingly agreed.</P>

<p>"You stopped my reception," said Mr. Massey, "but I realise
that you were merely getting at your point of view, and I am broad-minded
enough to be aware that your point of view is just as excellent as mine."</P>

<p>"That is singularly nice of you," said Grant, reaching for
his cigar-box.</P>

<p>"Now I have come to ask you as a personal friend to do me a
favour," said Mr. Massey, more impressively than ever. He pulled up a chair on
the opposite side of the desk, and lowered his voice as though he had a
precious secret to impart. "Some friends of mine are interested in the
festival."</P>

<p>"The Schleswig-Holstein Festival?" asked Grant, displaying
a sudden interest.</P>

<p>Massey nodded his head solemnly.</P>

<p>"The Schleswig-Holstein Festival," he repeated. "Now, Mr.
Macrae, none of us like the Germans really, though some of us have to do
business with them, and as you know we have no politics and no prejudices in
business."</P>

<p>"I realise that very well," said Grant, a little bitterly;
"you might even add 'no patriotism.'"</P>

<p>"You see how things are going"--Massey left the
controversial amendment out of the discussion--"and it is hardly necessary that
I, an ignorant layman, should attempt to instruct you who have all the news and
all the events of the world at your finger-tips." Again he paused, expecting a
polite denial; bat Grant was not feeling at all polite, and he resumed.</P>

<p>"Things are not going as well as we could wish on the
Continent, Mr. Macrae. Belgium is feeling a bit sore. France is feeling very
sore, though why I haven't the slightest idea, because undoubtedly we saved
France from destruction."</P>

<p>"One moment," interrupted Grant; "when you pass over a
railway bridge, have you ever considered what it is that is supporting you, the
girders or the bolts?"</P>

<p>Mr. Massey looked startled.</P>

<p>"I can't say that I have," he said; "but, of course, it is
the girder <I>and</I> the bolt."</P>

<p>"Exactly," said Grant; "call France the girder and Britain
the bolt, and you get the situation as it existed during the late war. We all
helped to save one another from destruction. France was short of ammunition and
short of material, but she made good her losses in the course of the war, and
she fought with superhuman courage; I hope you will please remember that, Mr.
Massey."</P>

<p>"Of course--of course," said Mr. Massey. "I had no desire to
say anything that France would take exception to."</P>

<p>Grant smiled, but Mr. Massey, who had no sense of humour,
went on unabashed. "France cannot understand our position. We were a business
people and had to take advantage of the situation as we found it. We were
enterprising, and secured the trade--that was to our credit."</P>

<p>"Again I would interrupt you," said Grant. "During the war
there could be no business as usual in France. Her main and vital industries
were in the hands of the enemy. Her coal mines, her iron mines, and most of her
textile districts were in the occupation of German troops."</P>

<p>"Exactly," said Mr. Massey, gathering his views as he
proceeded; "but the point I want to make is this: the natural alliance, if
there is to be a readjustment of alliances, is between England and Germany. And
that's why I want you, Mr. Macrae, to help all you can to encourage the
Schleswig-Holstein Festival. Let it be seen that England sympathises with a
crushed, a beaten, but an heroic enemy who is endeavouring to rehabilitate
himself."</P>

<p>Grant laughed. Even with his desire to be polite he could
not help himself.</P>

<p>"I hope you don't think you have struck an original idea,
Mr. Massey," he said with a smile. "It is one of the oldest arguments that has
been used. It is nothing to me whether the North German festival is a success
or not, though it may be to you, for I suppose you have some money invested in
it?"</P>

<p>Mr. Massey blushed.</P>

<p>"A hundred or two," he mumbled hurriedly, "but that has
nothing to do with the matter; I am arguing on principle."</P>

<p>"Well, on principle, Mr. Massey," said Grant, "there can be
no question that our main interest is to be discovered in the support of every
nation which opposes Germany, German <i>Kultur</i>, and the expansion of
German trade.
Sooner or later the enemy is going--"</P>

<p>"Don't call him an enemy," pleaded Massey; "be
reasonable."</P>

<p>"I repeat," said Grant, "the enemy is going to make an
effort to recover some of his lost prestige. He hates England--he has never
disguised the fact. Why, even to-day, the Hymn of Hate is to be found in every
school primer throughout Germany! The conquest of Britain is a real and
tangible dream; it did not exist before 1914--but now the German people live
only for the day which will find our power crushed."</P>

<p>"That will never be," said Mr. Massey, stoutly, and the
thrill in his tone suggested that he himself was in no small degree responsible
for the impossibility of such a plan.</P>

<p>"When is this festival to be?" asked Grant suddenly.</P>

<p>"They haven't decided the date yet," replied the other.
"All I know is that on that day a record number of special trains will be run
from all parts of Germany and that we shall see a real peace conference. Do you
know," he asked, "that on four hundred and eighty separate platforms a
resolution will be passed, that 'in the opinion of this great assembly war is
not justified except in defence of national existence'?"</P>

<p>Grant leant back in his chair, a puzzled frown on his
face.</P>

<p>"And so," he said slowly, "the German Government is going
to run excursion trains to all parts of the empire at an especially cheap fare,
and all for the purpose of announcing a platitudinous resolution from four
hundred and eighty platforms! Do you seriously suggest that the Government of
Germany is making these elaborate railway preparations--I saw a telegram
yesterday that no goods trains would run upon that day and that ordinary
passenger traffic would be suspended--in order to pass innocuous resolutions on
an unknown date?"</P>

<p>"I do," replied Mr. Massey, firmly.</P>

<p>Grant laughed.</P>

<p>"Do you realise the enormous amount of preparation this
great festival entails--for you cannot disorganize railways at a moment's
notice--and remembering this, does it not seem to you a very strange fact that
the German Government has not settled upon the day this spectacle shall
occur...?"</P>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p> "He is quite hopeless," said Mr. Massey to a circle of his
admirers at the Merchants' Club, "quite hopeless. I put the matter to him
logically and as clearly as I possibly could, but I assure you he is so steeped
and saturated in anti-German feeling that he even discovered a sinister design
on the part of Germany in their peace festival."</P>

<p>Undoubtedly Grant Macrae was a suspicious individual. He
had read about these preparations to hold what amounted to a national
conference in Schleswig-Holstein. He was not impressed with the pious desire
which had been expressed with singular unanimity by every newspaper throughout
Germany, that this festival should be one marked by "heartfelt thankfulness to
God that He had favoured the renaissance of German art and <i>Kultur</i>."</P>

<p>It was indeed remarkable, as he had said, that confronted
with the necessity for organizing a complicated time-table, food supplies for
the enormous influx of visitors which the festival would produce, and sleeping
accommodation for the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims who would make their
appearance on that joyous occasion, those responsible for its arrangement had
not definitely fixed the day it would occur. If Grant was interested in this
matter, England as a whole was not.</P>

<p>There was much to occupy the attention of the newspaper
reader without dwelling upon the domestic affairs of the German Empire.</P>

<p>Since Hungary had proclaimed her independence, and the
Emperor of Austria "in gratitude for the delivery of his country from the
barbarian invader" had come into line with the minor states, the British people
had been content with the disappearance of the dual kingdom, and had seen in
the inevitable break-up of Austria-Hungary, the fulfilment of wishes which
curiously enough they had never expressed. But though the destruction of the
dual empire had been outside their interests at the beginning of the war, they
had eagerly seized upon its disintegration as tangible evidence of the
fulfilment of at least a part of their war plans. They had not destroyed the
German empire, its might or its prestige. They had not dealt so shattering a
blow at their enemy that he was unable to recover, so that when men came to
review the balance sheet of war it was only natural that they should seize upon
the <I>fait accompli</I> in Austria as one of the acts to which they might
claim credit. Thereafter they either looked upon Germany with good-natured
contempt, believing implicitly the stories which were coming through of
Germany's economic ruin, or strove to forget that such a country existed. They
believed implicitly that Germany was crippled for a hundred years; that her
trade had passed automatically into the hands of her conquerors, and that
articles which came to them marked plainly "made in" were indeed the product of
that country, though why a land which hitherto had produced only the raw
materials of manufactures should suddenly form into a great industrial country
they did not stop to inquire. On the 1st of July, 1925, the <I>Daily
Londoner</I> announced that the British fleet would be reviewed on July 18th,
and commented upon the fact in a leader from which the following extract is
taken:--</P>

<br>

<p class="newspaper">Lord Goschen, on one memorable occasion, advised Sir Alfred
Milner if he had any doubt as to the supremacy of the British in South Africa
to make a visit to Simon's Town and see the British fleet. The <I>Megaphone</I>
with its usual disregard for patent fact has commented upon this occurrence
with a sneer that the ships in Simon's Bay did not prove efficacious in
protecting the ambitions of Pretoria. The same objection cannot be raised in
relation to the <I>Megaphone's</I> favourite bugbear. The proud fleet which
will anchor at Spithead on July 18th will give the croakers cause. What has
Britain to fear with a navy equal in point of size and gun power to any three
navies in the world? We may well be proud, etc.</P>

<br>

<p>Grant Macrae read the leader through word by word and
grinned. Porshein, the proprietor of the <I>Londoner</I>, had found it
convenient during the great war to describe himself as a Russian Pole. There
was no disputing the truth of one fact, that his two daughters had married into
German families that were "noble born."</P>

<p>Porshein was moreover associated with one of the big
electrical firms of Germany.</P>

<p>"The 18th!" murmured Grant as he read the announcement.</P>

<p>He did not doubt its accuracy, because Porshein had been
very kind to some of the junior members of the Government and accommodated them
at intervals. He secured information, sometimes a day, sometimes a week, before
its publication through the ordinary channels. Occasionally he would make a
statement foreshadowing some act of the Government, a forecast which aroused
such a storm of protest as to call for an official denial that any such
Government action was contemplated. There never was a <I>ballon d'essai</I>
which was not floated from his office.</P>

<p>Frankly, the public were not greatly interested in Germany,
and when side by side of the announcement--it was officially given out the next
day--there was a statement from the Hamburg correspondent of Reuter that the
date of the great German festival had been fixed on the 17th, the coincidence
passed unnoticed. On the 3rd July the Hamburg-American Steamship informed the
shipping agencies that the sailing of the <I>Vaterland</I> and the
<I>Hindenburg</I>, their two greatest ships from New York, on 12th July and
19th July respectively had been cancelled, owing to defective engine trouble
which had developed during the last voyages.</P>

<p>"These two ships will be replaced by the <I>Seydlitz</I>
and the <I>Kaiser Franz Joseph</I>," ran the statement. The big German shipping
companies had struck an unlucky week, for one of the biggest South American
liners also developed engine trouble and returned to Madeira, transferring her
passengers to a smaller ship and making her way "under her own seas."</P>

<p>"It looks serious," said the first lord of the Admiralty,
"very serious. I admit that much, but--"</P>

<p>He and Grant were dining alone at Buckingham Gate.</P>

<p>"Our information is that nothing unusual is going forward
in Germany, and that there is no real reason for apprehension. Besides, my dear
chap, it is very unlikely Germany would try any monkey tricks at a time our
fleet is practically mobilised, and at a moment when we had adopted one of the
most important inventions we have had in the past twenty years."</P>

<p>"What is that?" asked Grant Macrae.</P>

<p>"The Vennimore detector," replied the first lord; "you know
old Sir John?"--Grant nodded, and the first lord went on--"we have had extensive
tests, and there is no doubt that the adoption of this system is going to make
all the difference in the world to naval warfare."</P>

<p>"You think it is efficacious?"</P>

<p>"I know it is efficacious," replied Lord Arthur, "we have
had some of the best men in the service testing it, and it was practically
flawless."</P>

<p>Grant Macrae was thoughtful.</P>

<p>"How long would it take to adapt this machine?" he asked.</P>

<p>"Four months," was the reply.</P>

<p>Grant made a little grimace. "I would give half the money I
possess," he said, "to know what their game is."</P>

<p>The first lord laughed.</P>

<p>"I think you are worrying yourself unnecessarily. By the
way, how is your little friend, Miss Manton?" Grant smiled.</P>

<p>"Quite unsubdued," he said; "I gave her a long lecture on
running risks, but I am afraid I did not convince her. She is a patriot."</P>

<p>"An American patriot?" said Lord Arthur; "aren't they
rather rare?"</P>

<p>"An American patriot," repeated the other. "I think most
Americans are patriotic, but unfortunately there aren't a very large number of
Americans. She knows what we all know, that America is a big prize for an
enterprising militant."</P>

<p>They sat for an hour discussing the problems which were
exciting the Government at the moment. The French were a little cool, thought
the first lord, and it did not help to strengthen the bonds between the two
countries that England, because of her unimpaired industries, was gaining
ground at an enormous rate in the field of Commerce. The North of France had
not yet recovered from the German occupation, and the French treasury was in
fairly straitened circumstances.</P>

<p>The enemy had not occupied England, her coal mines were
undamaged, her factories still stood, the vast machinery of commerce had been
undisturbed by the war. It had not even rusted, for during the last year of the
war when the coming of the end became apparent, and the demand for ammunition
was falling off, manufacturers had devoted their attention to the securing of
the world's markets. This naturally hit Germany, but it hit France more. The
British had secured a lead in trade which they could not very well lose, and
our late ally was showing an irritation which was understandable, even though
it was deplorable.</P>

<p>"Let me ask you a plain question," said Grant Macrae,
suddenly, "if we found ourselves involved in war in two or three months' time,
could we depend upon the help of the French?"</P>

<p>The Cabinet Minister shook his head slowly.</P>

<p>"I don't think I should be justified in saying that we
could," he said.</P>

<p>"Or Russia?" asked Grant.</P>

<p>Again Lord Arthur shook his head.</P>

<p>"We could depend upon their moral support, but Russian
losses were so heavy, their expenditure so great, that another war would be
immensely unpopular."</P>

<p>"I see," said Grant, "so that if Germany attacks us, we
shall be practically alone."</P>

<p>"That's about the size of it," said the other cheerfully;
"we should be obliged to depend upon our incomparable navy of which the
<I>Londoner</I> speaks so feelingly this morning, and I think we should be in
an extent quite right," he continued; "the navy has never been so efficient as
it is now, and if Russia and France could not assist us they would certainly
not assist the enemy. It would be a free fight between the navies, with the
chance--and a very dim chance--that the German would invade us and repeat on a
more poignant scale the horrors which France and Belgium endured in 1914-
15."</P>

<p>"Suppose the navy fails through no fault of its own?"
inquired Grant.</P>

<p>"It will not fail," said the other shortly; "but if it did
there would be Hell. I will keep my eye on this festival," he said in parting.
"I have already drawn the attention of the Prime Minister to the fixing of the
date, but he does not seem to think that it portends anything unusual. I doubt
if Germany is prepared for war, and certainly we have seen nothing very
terrible in the press, nor have we yet a <I>causus belli</I>."</P>

<p>Grant raised his hands in despair. "<I>Causus belli!</I>"
he said, "what <I>causus belli</I> does the German require? You have forgotten
your &AElig;sop, my dear chap; the wolf very soon found his <I>causus belli</I>
when he wanted to eat the lamb."</P>

<p>"At any rate, we are prepared," said the other, and with
this assurance Grant went home in a troubled frame of mind.</P>

<hr>
<br>
<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">HE had arranged the next day to lunch with Ruth Manton. He
had been endeavouring to persuade her to surrender to him the little code book,
the possession of which constituted her offence against the German empire.
Sweet as she was, she could be very obstinate, and she had met all his
pleadings with a blank refusal. He renewed his effort at lunch.</P>

<p>"What is the use?" she countered. "I have practically the
whole of the important codes by memory. I can't de-memorise it, and giving the
book to you would merely put you in danger without relieving me."</P>

<p>"I am willing to take all the risks," he said.</P>

<p>"But I am not," she said quickly, and went very red.</P>

<p>"I mean," she corrected herself, "it isn't a question of
your personal danger that worries me, it is the thought that I should place any
human being in a position of peril."</P>

<p>"I very much appreciate your consideration," he smiled,
"but I am in a much better position to deal with an attack which will
inevitably be made upon the possessor of that book, and I think it were better
that it were in my safe."</P>

<p>She laughed.</P>

<p>"I think you're making a great fuss over nothing, really,"
she said with a light of amusement in her eyes; "does it occur to you that that
code is probably now in course of alteration?"</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" he asked.</P>

<p>She stirred her coffee and looked at him with a quizzical
eye.</P>

<p>"I have many friends," he said cryptically, "and one of
these is in a position to see all the cables which are being transmitted to
certain stations abroad. For the last three or four days, cables identically
couched, but perfectly undecipherable, have been going through to all the
German Embassies, and to all the captains of German men-of-war, who are at
present outside European waters. The cables are of such length that there can
be no doubt that a revision of some standard book is in course of progress."</P>

<p>"By the way," she said suddenly, "I saw your friend, Mr.
Ballin, last night."</P>

<p>He frowned and stiffened slightly.</P>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry; I was only trying to be humorous, but it
was rather interesting. He came after dinner and asked to see me. My two
previous experiences with Mr. Ballin did not encourage me to see him alone.
Fortunately there was a woman dining with me, and she was present at the
interview. By the way," she said, looking at him straightly, "he told me of a
little talk you had with him in the early hours of the morning I was taken on
the <I>Prague</I>."</P>

<p>"I wish to heaven he'd keep his tongue still," he growled.
"There was nothing in that interview which he could disclose with credit to
himself."</P>

<p>"Now I understand," she said, "how it came about that I was
rescued with such remarkable rapidity."</P>

<p>"What did Ballin want to see you for?" he asked, for he was
more than ordinarily interested.</P>

<p>"He wanted to know whether I would let by-gones be by-gones,
and come over to Germany for the festival."</P>

<p>"And you answered?"</P>

<p>"Never again," she answered emphatically, "I have had all
the experience I want for quite a long time of German <i>Kultur</i> and German
manners. This little island is quite good enough for me till I return to my own
country. To tell you the truth, I was rather nonplussed by his appearance--at
the mere fact that he had taken it for granted that I would receive him. He was
just the same urbane, polite young man, very calm and very philosophical. He
said he hoped as a result of this festival that all the old differences with
Germany would be wiped out."</P>

<p>"He said that, did he?" interrupted Grant. "Please remember
as much as you can of what he said in that respect."</P>

<p>"Let me think," she answered; "he also remarked about the
British Navy being mobilised on that date."</P>

<p>"In what connection?"</P>

<p>"In connection with the festivities and whatever danger
they threatened to the peace and security of England. You know," she said with
a smile, "your leaders have been rather ominous."</P>

<p>He nodded.</P>

<p>"It is not wonderful that they should be so," he said
quietly. "I feel that the times are ominous. I have a curious nervous sinking
feeling which is either due to overwork or to some esoteric influence which
cannot be explained."</P>

<p>She got up from the table, and he followed her from the
great restaurant to the palm court outside. He was smoking a cigarette and
taking a cup of coffee, chatting idly about the things of the moment, when she
suddenly exclaimed:</P>

<p>"There <I>is</I> Mr. Ballin."</P>

<p>He looked up. Ballin was slowly descending the stairway of
the hotel accompanied by Mr. Massey. Behind them singularly detached and aloof
was Olga Massey. Grant pointed her out to the girl.</P>

<p>"She looks, very pleased with herself," said Grant, and a
moment later Massey caught his eye and crossed the floor of the palm court.</P>

<p>"I've got the biggest bit of news," said Massey, taking a
chair without invitation, and leaving his daughter to entertain his guest.
"It's about this festival, and it is going to upset all your calculations."</P>

<p>"Is the German army disarming?" asked Grant, with mock
surprise.</P>

<p>"You will have your joke!" chuckled the other; "no, but
it's almost as important. Have you heard of the Peace League?"</P>

<p>Grant had heard of this little society which had branches
in all the European countries and had as its ostentatious design the bringing
together of all the elements which had been opposed in the last war. It was a
utopian scheme foredoomed to failure, based upon theories of universal
brotherhood, and it had dragged on an enfeebled existence ever since the war
had ended.</P>

<p>"The Peace League has organised a grand reunion," said Mr.
Massey slowly and impressively; "a reunion of the men who, ten years ago, were
anxious to cut one another's throats. In other words, we are making an
attempt--and I say we," he added modestly, "because I have played no small part
in the work of the league--to bring together German and English soldiers in
fraternity. In fact, we are inviting every man in England who served in the
late war to visit Schleswig-Holstein, where the most extensive arrangements are
being made for their comfort."</P>

<p>"How do you expect the majority of them to find their fares
for this?" inquired Grant.</P>

<p>"Ah, ha!" cried Mr. Massey. "I thought that would surprise
you. And now I will explain the most wonderful act of kindness and courtesy one
government has ever displayed towards another. Not only," he said, tapping the
table to emphasise his words, "not only will these be carried free of all costs
to Germany, not only will they be entertained and provided with meals for two
days, but they will receive a handsome souvenir of the occasion and will be
transported back by a whole fleet of steamers. You said in this morning's
paper--I have started reading your paper again--that you couldn't understand why
the German lines had cancelled their sailings. The explanation is simple, my
friend. The giant liners of the Hamburg American Company will be placed at the
disposal of the Peace League to transport our friends to the festival and will
bring them home again."</P>

<p>To say that Grant was staggered is but mildly to express
his feelings.</P>

<p>"What do you think of it?" asked the triumphant Mr.
Massey.</P>

<p>"I don't know what to think," confessed Grant, with a
smile, an admission which afforded Mr. Massey intense delight.</P>

<p>There were other people who did not know what to think; but
the impression which this great scheme created was on the whole one of sheer
delight. It is not too much to say that the British people were heartily sick
of war, and the rumour of war, and they welcomed whole-heartedly this
"magnificent attempt to weld antagonism into a common understanding," as the
<I>Daily Londoner</I> put it.</P>

<p>"Here beyond any doubt," said the <I>Daily Record</I>, "is
an honest attempt framed on novel lines to arrive at a better understanding,
and we for one welcome this proof of Germany's generous spirit without
reservation."</P>

<p>The offer needed no newspaper advertising. There was not a
journal from one end of England to the other that did not give prominence to
the impending excursion. They announced particulars as to how the application
for tickets should be made and printed, gratuitously, application forms whereon
a man had but to state his age, his name and his address, and his unit (if
any), to receive the necessary papers which would transport him abroad and
provide his accommodation. There were no troublesome documents to fill up. The
German government even waived its stringent passport regulations, only--and this
was the fly in the ointment--there was no accommodation for the wives and
children of the excursionists. "Already," said an explanatory notice, "the
resources of our host will be strained to the utmost, and it is obviously
impossible to provide the extra sleeping room which their presence would
necessitate." Elaborate time-tables of festivities were published, and the
application for tickets was obviously very heavy.</P>

<p>Grant Macrae felt he was being a churl, but stoutly refused
to give any publicity to this popular excursion. On the 14th July he sent for a
reporter to his room. "I want you to find out," he said, "how many applications
the Peace League have received. They used to have a small office in Conduit
Street, but apparently they have moved into bigger premises in Oxford
Street."</P>

<p>In an hour the reporter returned, a little puzzled.</P>

<p>"They were quite decent to me, and told me that they would
give me any information they had in their power, but apparently the
applications have been rather disappointing. So far, only twenty thousand
people have applied for tickets."</P>

<p>"Twenty thousand?" said Grant, incredulously, and the
reporter nodded. "The excursionists sail from the nearest ports to their
residence," the reporter went on, "from Avonmouth, Plymouth, Southampton,
Dover, Harwich, Hull, Newcastle, the Clyde and Aberdeen. Ships will call on the
appointed day and special trains will be run to make the necessary
connections."</P>

<p>"And all for twenty thousand people!" interrupted Grant.</P>

<p>The reporter pulled out his note-book.</P>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I had my doubts about that 20,000
too," he said. "Look at this, sir."</P>

<p>He took from his book a blue form filled in with a name of
a man. The address was in Sheffield. The form was a model of exactness. It told
the applicant the time the train left Sheffield, the time it arrived at Hull,
the hour it arrived at Bremen, the name of the camp, the number of the line and
the letter of the tent where he would find "everything he needed."</P>

<p>"This is one of the tickets, I suppose," said Grant,
turning it over; "where did you get it?"</P>

<p>"I slipped it off the table, when the secretary's back was
turned," said the reporter unblushingly; "but don't you see its importance,
sir? Look at the number!"</P>

<p>Grant looked and whistled, for the number on the left-hand
corner was "601,174."</P>

<p>"Of course," said the reporter, "this may only mean a
serial number, and that the actual number began over 500,000."</P>

<p>"We will find out," said Grant.</P>

<p>The next morning's edition of the <I>Megaphone</I> revealed
a surprising change of policy.</P>

<p>So far from ignoring this grand excursion the editor was
apparently anxious to assist those who were participating. In open defiance of
all the laws regarding lotteries and guessing competitions, he offered a bonus
of £5 to the first fifty applications who held tickets, the numbers of which by
totalling the figures together made 13. It was a very simple competition, as he
explained. The man who had a ticket numbered 1246, the figures of which added
together made 13, would be a winner. So also would the holder of 31,414, and so
on. Three days later, there were 5000 applications for the prize.</P>

<p>The figures given left Grant in no doubt as to what the
plan was. He put the matter without delay before the Government, and the
Government Department concerned laughed at his suspicion. He took it to the
Admiralty with no greater success. He put it before the War Office, and was
informed that "the army council saw nothing but good in the
<I>rapprochement</I> between the soldiers of Great Britain and of their late
enemy."</P>

<p>After this last visit, he returned to the office in disgust
and shut himself in his inner sanctum. He must take a bold step and attack the
enemy on his own ground, and the first step would be to interview Ballin. That
gentleman, whom he succeeded in reaching by telephone, came at once. Grant
ushered him in to his private room and shut the door behind him.</P>

<p>"Mr. Ballin," he said to that imperturbable young man, "I
am going to put all my cards on the table, and I am going to ask you to do the
same, without expecting that you will. This country is on the verge of war with
Germany."</P>

<p>The other smiled.</P>

<p>"That is your pet illusion, Mr. Macrae," he said quietly.
"Why should you imagine at this moment, when we are giving such striking proof
of our friendship, or our desire for friendship, that we should be
contemplating anything so terrible? I admit," he went on quietly, "that England
has been a very bitter pill for us to swallow, and the hatred the German feels
for the Englishman will take a lot of wearing down. We are trying very hard to
put an end to an intolerable situation. We recognise that no nation can afford
to be isolated as Germany has been during the last ten years, boycotted as she
has been, and snubbed as she has been. It were far better," he cried
passionately, "that the last German soldier had died on the field than that we
should have concluded a peace which was not to our advantage. We had either to
win or go out. We did not win, and we would have been destroyed as a nation
when the war ended but for the resilience and the discipline of the German
people. I say this about you," he looked at Grant fairly and squarely in the
face, "because you are a patriot, and you love your country. You do not care
who suffers so long as your own land comes out on top. I respect your point of
view, I admire it. My view is exactly the same, save that it has as the object
of its solicitude Germany, whilst yours is Great Britain. The difference
between the two countries is this. That whilst we Germans recognise the
seriousness of our situation, you in Great Britain are smugly satisfied with
the polished surface of things. You work like a Trojan to arouse your people to
a sense of their danger--whatever danger there is"--again he smiled and spread
his hands with a gesture of deprecation. "You say there is going to be war.
Your people do not believe you and vote you a bore. Why? Because they do not
see under the skin of things. Our people know--what they know. But suppose war
threatened--what would be the cause? You are the cause, you and your people. You
never understood Germany, you never understood war. You did not know that it is
kinder to kill than to maim; you did not appreciate the German spirit
sufficiently to realise that we could understand and admire thoroughness in
repression, even though it were directed against us, and that your
old-womanliness of shaking hands, and in your damnable magnanimity forgiving us,
was the bitterest humiliation you put upon us. We are a people of war, Huns you
call us, and you are not far wrong, for the old spirit which permitted
slaughter, and not only permitted, but encouraged slaughter as a means to a
peaceful end, is the spirit which animates the German nation to-day. When you
read during the war how a German officer punished a quarrelsome German soldier
by suddenly plunging his sword into his stomach and then went on cleaning his
nails as though nothing had happened, you thought he was a brute beast. He was
intellectual, his act was in perfect consonance with the spirit of German
culture. Don't you see that all natural processes are cruel--what more cruel
than child-birth? You, no less than we, secure fame, peace, happiness, ease and
confidence--which implies a lack of fear--by crushing your enemies. You do not
take your murderers and your parasites and shake hands with them, you destroy
them, and by their destruction you engender a confidence in the law. You do not
realise that you go to bed every night in peace and security because a grim and
nerveless hangman has strangled your enemy. But, nevertheless, that is the
truth. You owe your liberty as a result of terrible cruelties which have been
inflicted all down the ages by one party upon another, by one nation upon
another. You only look at results and delude yourselves into the belief that
they are God-sent as a reward for your virtues. You thrive on cruelty. Your
joint of beef upon your table was a living ox two days ago, in the pride and
strength of his youth, and he endured the shock and the torment of death that
he might supply your table. Can you show me one of the privileges which you
enjoy which has not brought grief to somebody else? There is no such thing as
painless evolution, for the beginning of all human progress and all human
improvement is founded in war." He stopped himself and went on in a calmer
tone. "I don't know why I should inflict my views and theories of fife upon
you; I take it that you did not ask me to come to feed you with theories. What
do you want with me, Mr. Macrae?"</P>

<p>Grant had been an interested listener to the exposition of
the other's philosophy.</P>

<p>"I want to tell you," he said slowly, "that I understand
your German festival very well."</P>

<p>"And what do you understand about it?" asked the other
quickly.</P>

<p>"Will you sit down?" said Grant, and with a little bow
Ballin pulled a chair up to the desk and seated himself. Grant took his place
opposite and leant across the desk, his elbows on the table, his hands
clasped.</P>

<p>"On the 17th of July," he said slowly, "let us say the
night of the 16th, thousands of special trains will run from various places
toward your North Sea and Baltic ports."</P>

<p>"Two days previous to this, you will have landed in or near
some of those ports some 600,000 Britishers."</P>

<p>"As many as that?" asked the other coolly.</P>

<p>"Your Government is to be congratulated upon one of the
most remarkable schemes that has ever been initiated. To-morrow," Grant went on
deliberately, "I shall publish my views in full in this newspaper, and I have
secured very large spaces in the press throughout the country in order to call
attention to my view."</P>

<p>"That is very enterprising of you," said the other
cheerfully; "why have you sent for me?"</P>

<p>Grant regarded him fixedly for a few moments before he
replied.</P>

<p>"Because I believe that you are the head of the great
movement which your country is making to bring about the ruin of this country,"
he said deliberately, "and because I am satisfied in my mind that once I have
convinced you of the futility of your plan you will abandon it."</P>

<p>The other stared at him in astonishment.</P>

<p>"You are certainly a very bold man," he said, "and I would
be the last to deny that your country deserves well of you."</P>

<p>He took up his hat and his stick, crooked his stick on his
arm and pulled on his gloves.</P>

<p>"My advice to you," he said as he stood by the door, "is to
abandon your idea of publication. Apart from the ridicule it would bring upon
you, there are other considerations which should induce a man of your
perceptions to hesitate before he took such a step. That, however," he shrugged
his shoulders, "is a matter for you and you alone to decide."</P>

<p>He looked into his hat as though studying the maker's name
and went on.</P>

<p>"I am aware that all the time I have been speaking," he
said, without raising his eyes, "you have been considering the advisability of
shooting me, and that your revolver is practically under your hand."</P>

<p>Grant started, for this was in truth the case.</P>

<p>"If I may extend my advice," smiled Ballin, "advice which
followed benefits me as well as you, I should refrain from touching that
weapon. The destruction of an instrument does not greatly embarrass the hand
that plays instruments; it is the duty of the agent to be destroyed if in his
destruction he is bringing his principle any nearer to success. My killing
would not help you at all, and would indeed produce a very embarrassing
situation, and probably give my country the <I>causus belli</I> which you were
discussing so learnedly at the first lord's dinner-table the other night."</P>

<hr>
<br>
<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">WITH this parting shot he left. Grant did not trouble to
wonder how Carl Ballin had discovered what happened at the dinner-table of the
first lord of the Admiralty. He knew that the perfect espionage system of
Germany had been reorganised, and that the best efforts of the German
intelligence department were devoted to Russia and to France. He spent the
afternoon working away at the story which he designed for the shocking of
England. His dinner was brought in to him on a tray, and he continued his work
without interruption.</P>

<p>A telephone call brought him from his desk at ten o'clock.
He recognised Ruth's voice.</P>

<p>"Can I come down and see you?"</P>

<p>He looked at his watch, and from his watch to the desk.
Very little more remained to be done. He had prepared the whole of the
statement, and he could afford an hour's relaxation.</P>

<p>"Come down by all means," he invited.</P>

<p>She was in the office half an hour later, and briefly he
sketched to her the sum of his deductions.</P>

<p>"Do you really think that things are so bad?" she asked
gravely. He nodded.</P>

<p>"Suppose they aren't, and you have made a
mistake, would it affect you very much?"</P>

<p>He shook his head with a little smile.</P>

<p>"I have already earned the name of Alarmist, and it will
merely be added to my delinquencies."</P>

<p>She sat quietly by whilst he finished his work, corrected
some proofs of the matter as they were sent down from the printer's room, and
at length when the last of the long slips had been passed, he swung round in
his chair. It was a quarter-past eleven, and he was thoroughly tired, but--</P>

<p>"I have something to say to you," he said abruptly.</P>

<p>She looked up. She was sitting in a low armchair with a
magazine on her knees, and she put the book aside. He thought she was
singularly beautiful, and the words which he thought would have come with such
readiness seemed to stick in his throat.</P>

<p>"What is it?" she asked gently.</P>

<p>She had a vague idea that she knew what was coming.</P>

<p>"It's about you," he said, "you with your big mission and
your lonely life, and I with a mission which I believe to be as big and
associated with yours, couldn't we--mightn't we--the fact is, Ruth Manton, I am
in love with you."</P>

<p>She went white, but there was no apprehension in her eyes,
only a great and womanly kindness.</P>

<p>"How long have you been in love with me?" she asked in a
low voice.</P>

<p>He shook his head.</P>

<p>"I think it must have been from the first time I saw you,"
he said, "and now--well, I feel I can't live without you."</P>

<p>It struck him that he was very unconvincing, and very cold-blooded
in his declaration. He had never been so much at a loss to express his
feelings in words. She rose up from her chair and walked towards him, laid her
two hands on his shoulders.</P>

<p>"And do you really mean this?" she said, looking him
straight in the eyes, "or is it a sense of pity for my loneliness--I'm not
really lonely, you know--or is it a sort of comradeship which you have mistaken
for something else? What is it you want of me?"</P>

<p>With a swift circling of his arms, he caught her towards
him.</P>

<p>"This," he said huskily, and kissed her.</P>

<p>Their lips were together, he felt the beating of her heart
against his, and he was experiencing for the first time in his life a sense of
almost heavenly comfort when there was a crash like thunder, the walls of the
office reeled and crumbled, and Grant and the girl were hurled against the rear
wall. His last recollection was of a pair of terror-stricken grey eyes looking
into his, and then all went dark.</P>

<p>He woke up in the street; he was lying on a stretcher, and
the police were just about to lift him into the motor ambulance. He had a
horrible pain in his head, and was conscious that he was surrounded by an
enormous crowd, but his first thoughts were for the girl.</P>

<p>"The lady?" he muttered.</P>

<p>"She's all right, sir," said the inspector, bending over
him. "She's here."</P>

<p>Grant looked up; the girl was standing by the stretcher
looking down at him. She was very pale, but apparently unhurt.</P>

<p>"Come with me," he said, and she nodded, following him into
the ambulance, and sitting on a low seat by his side.</P>

<p>"What happened?" he asked.</P>

<p>"I'm afraid I've some bad news for you," she said. "The
office blew up; the police think it was dynamited."</P>

<p>"What of the staff?" he asked.</P>

<p>She made no reply. The staff of the <I>Megaphone</I> were
being dealt with as fast as they could be extracted from that blazing
inferno.</P>

<p>"Am I hurt very badly?" he asked after a pause.</P>

<p>"Not very badly; the doctor says you have only a cut in the
head, and a few bruises, and it may not be necessary to detain you in the
hospital. I'm going to see your wounds dressed, and then I'm taking you back to
my hotel."</P>

<p>"Dynamited," he repeated, "of course it was the only thing
they could do, but I am going to tell the story if I am dynamited a hundred
times over."</P>

<p>She leant down and kissed him. It seemed so natural a thing
to do that she experienced no embarrassment.</P>

<p>The wound, as she had said, was slight, and the doctor at
Bartholomew's Hospital felt no qualms in allowing his patient leave. The girl
accompanied him home, and after he had got to bed came up and made him
comfortable for the night.</P>

<p>"I have put you in the next room to myself," she said, "and
I have had a portable bell fixed, so that you can ring me if you want
anything."</P>

<p>His dreams were troubled that night, and he scarcely
enjoyed an uninterrupted hour of sleep. He was, despite his equanimity, shocked
by the tragedy which had so unexpectedly overtaken the newspaper. The
<I>Megaphone</I> was a real living thing to him, a child and an occupation, and
although he promised himself that publication should not be interrupted for
more than twenty-four hours, he had a sense of personal loss, as though he had
seen the death of one who was very precious to him. In the early hours of the
morning he fell asleep, the first dreamless sleep he had enjoyed, and awoke at
nine to find the girl standing by the side of his bed with a cup of tea.</P>

<p>"I judged the psychological moment," she smiled. He raised
his aching head with a little grimace, and her left arm circled his neck and
helped him to a sitting position.</P>

<p>"I think you are not so well as you think," she said with
anxiety in her face.</P>

<p>He chuckled, though the effort to laugh was painful
enough.</P>

<p>"I am well enough to start a new newspaper to-day," he said
grimly.</P>

<p>"Tell me," she asked, as she took the cup from him, "have
you lost a great deal of money? I mean have you lost everything?"</P>

<p>He smiled as he took her hand.</P>

<p>"You're not planning to give me half your fortune? No, my
dear child, I haven't lost everything. In fact, financially this loss is very
little, and most of it will be covered by insurance. What I am losing, and what
I cannot afford to lose, is time."</P>

<p>She looked at him dubiously.</P>

<p>"I don't think you ought to get up to-day, yet I know that
you will," she said. "Is there anything I could do?"</P>

<p>He thought for a moment.</P>

<p>"There is a newspaper published in London," he said,
"called the <I>Morning World</I>. It's an old established property, but has
fallen on evil times, and I think they want to sell it. In the open market it's
worth about £60,000, because it is a losing proposition, but the machinery is
fairly modern. I am willing to buy the paper, and pay up to £100,000 for it. Go
along and see its manager."</P>

<p>She went eagerly, delighted to find a place for herself in
his schemes.</P>

<p>Her interview with the manager of the <I>Morning World</I>
was not a protracted one, and the negotiations which followed were simplified
by reason of the fact that her arrival synchronised with a board meeting at
which the directors of the paper were considering the advisability of closing
the paper down, and selling off the assets for what they would fetch.</P>

<p>By one o'clock £70,000 in cash had changed hands, by five
o'clock Grant Macrae, in his new editorial office, had changed the title of the
paper, had reorganized its staff, and was engaged in dictating an article on
the lines of that which had come to such an untimely end on the night
before.</P>

<p>It is only necessary to give the introduction to an article
which perhaps created a greater sensation than any newspaper article which had
ever previously been made public, or which has since seen the light of day.
That introduction was terse and allegorical.</P>

<br>

<p class="newspaper">"On the 17th of this month, some 600,000 young men of
military age are leaving these shores for Germany. If during their absence war
should break out, those 600,000 men will be interned, and the flower of the
army on which we should depend in case of an attack will have been virtually
wiped out of existence.</P>

<p class="newspaper">"I accuse the German Government of having adopted this
comparatively speaking inexpensive method of transporting Britons of military
age to Germany with the object of reducing our strength of resistance.</P>

<p class="newspaper">"On the day following their arrival in Germany, some 4,000
or 5,000 trains will leave for Germany's coast ports ostensibly to carry
excursionists to the gigantic festivals which are being organised in the state
of Schleswig-Holstein, but in reality to transport troops to Bremen, Hamburg,
Kiel, Wilhelmshaven, Borkum and Cuxhaven.</P>

<p class="newspaper">"I repeat that those troops are intended to be taken on
board the great liners which have specially been detained for the purpose in
European waters, and transported by some means or other to England.</P>

<p class="newspaper">"I accuse the German Government of deliberately planning an
unprovoked attack upon Great Britain, and I am certainly in possession of
information to the effect that twenty-four corps of the line with twenty-four
reserve divisions are to be employed for this purpose, and that the King of
Bavaria, remarkable for his hatred of all British things, is to be in
command."</P>

<br>

<p>This was briefly the introduction to his article. The
article itself gave chapter and verse for all his conclusions. It pointed out
what had passed unnoticed in England, the frequent consultations which the King
of Bavaria had had with the great General Staff. It described the measures
which had been followed to bring the corps up to war strength. It gave
categorical lists of the output of Krupp's in the past eighteen months, and it
revealed, for the first time, a breach in the Anglo-German convention.</P>

<br>

<p class="newspaper">"It is said that Germany has kept to the letter of her
agreement with Great Britain and that she has only built the ships that were
allowed by the Treaty of Copenhagen. This is not true. There are in German
shipyards, scores of vessels and nearly a hundred submarines which do not
appear in the Naval List. These are the vessels which, according to German
accounts, were half constructed when, for some reason or other, the work was
stopped on them. In some cases the excuse was that there were architectural
errors of construction, and in others that the material supplied was not the
quality specified. Ostensibly these boats were left in the hands of the
contractors, for it will be noticed that these errors have never occurred in
the Imperial Shipbuilding yard.</P>

<p class="newspaper">"But not only are these ships completed and engined, but
they are also practically armed and ready to take the water in a month at the
latest."</P>

<br>

<p>The <I>Megaphone</I> provided the sensations of the week.
These revelations formed the subject which was canvassed at every dinner-table.
That they should be ridiculed was only to be expected. The <I>Londoner</I> was
merciless in its criticisms.</P>
<br>

<p class="newspaper">"We can only conclude," it said, "that the bad accident
which occurred to the editor of our contemporary has deranged his judgment. To
suggest that that accident, which we understand was caused by a gas explosion,
was arranged by a German agent is, to put it mildly, as fantastic a theory as
we have heard, not out of place perhaps in sensational fiction, but wholly
contemptible when suggested in all seriousness in a daily newspaper."</P>
<br>

<p>The <I>Herald-Record</I> was no less severe.</P>
<br>

<p class="newspaper">"In short, this wild and incoherent nonsense is to be
accepted by our people as evidence of a plot the like of which we have never
seen outside a sensational novel. We cannot too strongly condemn the
publication of these sensational stories. Doubtless Mr. Macrae will draw many
ha'pennies into his coffers by publishing this kind of literature, but it
redounds neither to the credit of himself nor of British journalism. The net
result of the precious 'revelations' is to revive all the fears and
uncertainties of the old war days, but if Mr. Macrae aims at spoiling only an
enjoyable outing on the part of a large number of men who are anxious to meet
their old opponents on kinder terms than when last they met, we believe he has
failed."</P>
<br>

<p>Some of the criticisms were milder. The <I>Post-Echo</I>
regretted that the offending journal could not find more pleasant and more
charitable subjects with which to fill its columns. The <I>Trade Union
Journal</I> condemned the article as implying bad faith with the German Trade
Unionists who had extended a welcome to their brother unionists of Britain.
Grant read the comments without resentment.</P>

<p>"They are not very kind, are they?" said the girl with a
laugh. She had installed herself as his secretary, nurse, and general
assistant. He patted her hand. </P>

<p>"The best thing you can do," he said, "is to take the next
boat back to America."</P>

<p>"But why?" she asked in indignant surprise.</P>

<p>"Because you are going to see things in London which little
girls should not see," he said gravely, "and I think you are going to see them
before the next week is out.</P>

<p>"Do you seriously mean it?"</P>

<p>"I seriously mean that England is going to be invaded, and
the only thing for a woman to do, and especially a woman who has been
associated with anti-German propaganda, is to clear out of the country."</P>

<p>She threw back her head and laughed.</P>

<p>"If you would really like to know what would be the best
thing for me to do," she said demurely, "and if it wasn't a horribly bold thing
to say, I would tell you."</P>

<p>"What is that?" he asked.</P>

<p>For answer she passed round to the back of his chair, and
leaned over and kissed him on the cheek.</P>

<p>"I think I'd better get married," she said, and was out of
the room before he could say anything.</P>

<p>He did not see her until the evening.</P>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">ALL day long, telegrams and letters had been arriving by
the shoal, mostly from men who had studied the situation and recognised its
seriousness. Great army chiefs, retired and active, naval men, writers,
economists, all supported his views. There were of course a large number of
abusive epistles, but that was part of the game. He had set tongues wagging and
was an amused audience to a curious discussion which took place in the railway
carriage which carried him to Burland. He was taking a few hours off, for Sir
John had wired asking him to come down.</P>

<p>The old man was in excellent humour, and his blind
assistant one broad grin.</P>

<p>"I've been reading your article, Macrae," said Sir John,
after he had shaken hands, "and I hope you are wrong."</P>

<p>"Hope I am wrong?" said the astonished editor.</P>

<p>"I hope you are wrong when you think that war is going to
break out within a week or so," said Sir John; "you know the Navy has adopted
my invention; that it would be at least three months before they can be adapted
to the fleet. I am busy working out the particulars of an extemporised detector
which can be fixed in a few days. The Admiralty has asked me to get it ready by
to-morrow, and I think it will just about be able to do the work, without,
however, enabling the ship to accurately locate the submarine.</P>

<p>"What I am doing now is preparing a mere description, a
clear and concise direction which will enable an engineer lieutenant to rig up
a temporary instrument. That is why I wanted to see you. I won't ask you for
any particulars, but are you satisfied in your own mind that the danger is so
serious as you say?"</P>

<p>"I am," replied Grant.</P>

<p>"Good," said Sir John; "now we are going to work, aren't
we, Tom?"</P>

<p>"I'm sure, sir," said the blind man.</P>

<p>"And we'll give the devils something to remember, won't we,
Tom?"</P>

<p>"We will that, sir," said the soldier with a chuckle. "I'll
bet they'll be sorry for themselves by the time we've done with 'em, damn
'em!"</P>

<p>"Ssh!" admonished Sir John, "no bad language, Tom. What a
wicked old blind man you are, and what a bad-tempered old blind man! Come on."
He took the other's arm affectionately, and Grant, watching this curious couple
as they walked up the corridor leading to the laboratory, felt his eyes grow
moist.</P>

<p>Carl Ballin, standing at the window, saw Grant's car whizz
past on the way to Burland Station. He smiled a little and went back to his
book. He was reading when Sir Max Graaf, his host, came into the room.</P>

<p>"Have you finished?" asked Ballin. He spoke in German.</P>

<p>"Thank heaven, yes!" replied the other in the same
language. He went to the sideboard, poured out a lot of whiskey and diluted
it.</P>

<p>"When do you leave?" asked Carl.</P>

<p>"To-morrow," said the millionaire; "I am travelling by the
<I>Mauretania</I>."</P>

<p>"Oh," said the other, and then after a pause, "Why don't
you wait to see out?"</P>

<p>"Because I'm not a damned fool," said Sir Max, briefly.
"What is more, I dislike intensely anything that pertains to violence."</P>

<p>Carl laughed. "I don't know how long America will offer you
a safe and calm harbourage," he said.</P>

<p>"For twelve months, at any rate," replied the other. "By
the end of that time you ought to get this country settled, and then I'll come
back."</P>

<p>Carl nodded many times as though his thoughts were
elsewhere.</P>

<p>"You're taking it for granted," he said, "that we shall
succeed!"</P>

<p>"Of course," said the other in surprise. "Why not?"</P>

<p>Carl shrugged his shoulders. "I don't exactly know why it
shouldn't be, but I'm a little scared. Now if we only could have settled up
with our friend Macrae, I should have been perfectly confident. He has set
people thinking. I hate to see the British thinking."</P>

<p>"You're not nervous, are you?" sneered the other.</P>

<p>Carl laughed.</P>

<p>"If I am, I'm entitled to be," he said pointedly. "I'm
staying behind to see the matter through; I assure you I shouldn't be nervous
at all if my portmanteaux were packed and labelled New York, but the worst of
my job is to come."</P>

<p>"What is that?" asked Sir Max.</P>

<p>"I never discuss my plans in advance," said the other
easily. He bit off the end of a cigar and lit it. "I repeat that the scheme may
fail."</P>

<p>"Why?" asked the other in surprise.</P>

<p>"Partly because of Macrae, and partly because--well, there
are other reasons."</P>

<p>He drove down to Burland and saw Sir Max Graaf off by the
4.52. He returned to the house and spent the afternoon and a greater portion of
the evening sitting by the window. From where he sat, he commanded a view of
the village street and the whole of the front of Sir John's house. He had much
to think of and many plans to weigh, and the more important of these called for
very careful analysis. It was half-past eleven when he had adjudged the moment
had come for putting his plan to its most crucial test.</P>

<p>All the servants, but one, had been dismissed, and that one
had been sent off to London with a message. Carl dressed himself for his
adventure with great care. He substituted a dark suit and a dark blue shirt for
that which he wore. He also took the precaution of wearing a pair of black silk
gloves. There must be no finger-prints in this business. Nothing which would
bring the crime home to the perpetrator. He would make no such bungle of the
business as his compatriot had made.</P>

<p>There was a side entrance to Sir John's house, and a window
which lead into the pantry. This Carl had seen after a careful reconnaissance.
To enter the house was the work of a few minutes. After that, he must proceed
more cautiously. He walked warily into the deserted dining-room. Sir John was
in bed, and the house was in darkness. Carl had previously encircled the
building and noticed the absence of lights in the laboratory. He flashed his
electric lamp about the room and discovered on the table an open ABC timetable.
By the side, on a slip of paper written in the Professor's cramped fist, were a
number of times. So he was going up by the 8.40, and would be carrying his
precious secret with him.</P>

<p>Carl made his way to the stairs, tested every tread before
he trusted the weight of his body to it, and came at last to the Professor's
sleeping-room. He tried the handle cautiously, and the door gave.</P>

<p>Very slowly he pushed it open to its full width. No light
flashed. No signal bell rang, and listening he could hear the steady breathing
of the room's occupant. He moved with cat-like tread across the room, stretched
his hands out before him, felt the edge of the bedside table, and searched it.
Here it was that he found a big, bulky packet, an embossed seal upon its flap.
He slipped it into his pocket, and drew from a leather sheath at his side a
long keen-edged knife. He hesitated only for a moment, and then "all progress
begins in slaughter," he whispered to himself. With his left hand he found Sir
John's throat.... The Professor half woke, but the knife struck twice.</P>

<p>The old man whispered something, and Ballin, lowering his
head, listened.</P>

<p>"Edward," muttered the faint voice, and the murderer knew
that the dying man was calling upon the name of his son.</P>

<p>He wiped the knife on the bedclothes and returned it to its
sheath, then made stealthily for the door.</P>

<p>Noiseless as he was, there was one who could be still more
silent. He had reached the door, his hand on the handle, when an arm was flung
round his waist.</P>

<p>"You're a German," whispered a hoarse voice; "what have you
done to my master?"</P>

<p>"Let go!" snarled Ballin.</P>

<p>"Come here--you!"</P>

<p>He felt himself almost lifted back to the bed. Tom's hands
touched the silent form, felt the cruel wounds above that tired heart.</P>

<p>"Oh!" he said, and it was an "oh!" like a sob.</P>

<p>Ballin, with a supreme effort, wrenched himself free, and
whipping out his revolver, fired. A low chuckle came from the darkness. The
German sprang for the door, but some one was there before him. It closed with a
crash. He fired again, and this time the bullet must have hit the man before
him, but before he could press the trigger for a third time some one had him by
the throat, had broken the revolver from his grip, and was now pressing him
against the wall.</P>

<p>"I've got ye this time!... You've got me, too, but
that's nothing.... I don't want to live after him. I always knew I'd kill
another German before I died--and you're him!"</P>

<p>The pressure about the throat increased, the blood shot to
the doomed man's head, he struggled vainly, but he was in the hands of one
whose strength made the other but a child.</P>

<p>"Good-bye, German," whispered the blind man hoarsely. "I
can't see ye, I wish I could. Good-bye, German...."</P>

<p>In the morning they found all three. Ballin a heap on the
ground, dreadful to look upon, and Tom Carrington lying by the side of his dead
master, his strong arm encircling the other's shoulder, as a man will hold a
child.</P>

<hr>
<br>
<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">THE murders were not reported in the following morning's
newspapers. Within two hours of the discovery of the crime, the Admiralty and
the police were in possession of the house, and that same afternoon the
newspaper proprietors of London were called together and were informed of the
occurrence and requested to keep the facts from the public.</P>

<p>Sir Max Graaf was detained at Liverpool and brought back to
London for inquiries. He professed to know little, or nothing, of Ballin beyond
the fact that he was a man of independent wealth, and a search of Ballin's room
did not greatly assist the police to come to any conclusion as to his identity.
The crime was easy to reconstruct. The sealed packet in the murderer's pocket,
the blood-stained knife at his side, and the marks about his throat, the
discarded revolver, and the wounds in the dead soldier--all these told their own
tale. Grant Macrae, shocked beyond measure at this tragic development, did not
lose sight of its significance.</P>

<p>"You'll have to tell the people," he said to the First
Lord.</P>

<p>"If we tell the people we shall also tell Germany," said
Lord Arthur, "and if there is one thing we want to avoid, it is to let the
enemy know that we are fixing up the new detector. I have had the description
wirelessed to all the ships of the fleet, and engineers are working double
shift to work the detector."</P>

<p>"Where is the fleet?" asked Grant.</P>

<p>"In Spithead," was the reply: "the last of the battle-cruisers
is coming in to-night; the review is to be to-morrow instead of the
18th."</P>

<p>"What of the grand excursion?" asked Grant drill. "Is the
Government still approving?"</P>

<p>Lord Arthur shrugged his shoulders.</P>

<p>"What can I do?" he said in despair. "I can't change the
administration and I certainly cannot convince it. You know this country is
full of sympathisers with Germany. I should say there are more people in high
places who have an admiration for Germany to-day than there ever have been
before. By the way, your numbers are not quite right. There are 572,000 who
have accepted the invitation of the German Government."</P>

<p>"And you are going to let them go?" asked Grant
seriously.</P>

<p>Lord Arthur raised his hands helplessly.</P>

<p>"What am I to do?" he asked again.</P>

<p>"I should blow the ships up as they came into harbour,"
said Grant; "at any rate, I should take no risks."</P>

<p>"You'll probably find yourself mobbed," smiled the First
Lord; "a lioness robbed of her cub bears no comparative in ferocity to England
robbed of its pleasure. The only thing to do is to hope for the best."</P>

<p>That same afternoon there came an announcement from the
committee of the festival that it had been necessary to advance the date by one
day, and holders of tickets for the great joy ride, as one newspaper flippantly
described it, were asked to make their arrangements to leave on a day previous
to that which had been fixed.</P>

<p>"That's to-morrow," said Grant, when he read the first
intimation.</P>

<p>Surely the Government would act now. The German plan was so
apparent. But the Government saw no reason to intervene, and his attempt to
obtain an interview with the Prime Minister was met by the statement that the
Premier was spending the week-end out of town. On the morning of the 17th of
July, the great German steamers called at all the advertising ports, and
embarked their cheering thousands. With bands playing and handkerchiefs waving
the ships put out to sea.</P>

<br>

<p class="newspaper">"No more stirring sight has ever been seen at any British
port than that which followed the embarkation of Germany's guests," wrote the
special correspondent of <I>The Londoner</I>. "Here were men, who a few
years ago, had been facing an implacable enemy in trenches, and were now off to
fraternise with those who in the bad old times it had been their duty to kill.
Universal peace was never nearer sure achievement than at this moment.</P>

<p class="newspaper">"'I am going to try and find the man who bombed me at La
Bassée,' said one former reservist, 'and we will have a drink together.'</P>

<p class="newspaper">"In this spirit did the manhood of England go forward to
greet their sometime rivals."</P>

<br>

<p>Grant was in his office when he read this description, and
he had hardly reached the end of the paragraph when he was summoned by an
Admiralty messenger to Whitehall. Lord Arthur was not alone. There were two
grave senior officers of the navy present when he was ushered into the big
council room which had witnessed so many important deliberations. The door was
closed before he spoke.</P>

<p>"You know Admiral Lord Polshan?" he said, and Grant bowed;
"and Admiral Sir George Dirk?"</P>

<p>Grant had met both before, and knew them to be in sympathy
with his point of view.</P>

<p>"It is understood, Macrae," said Lord Arthur, "that what
transpires here is to be kept secret for the rest of your life, and must not be
told either in form of memoir or in any other way."</P>

<p>"That is understood," said Grant.</P>

<p>"Briefly the situation is this," said Lord Arthur, "my
colleagues here agree with your point of view. The German ships have reached
port by now, and we can do nothing to undo the mischief which, in the opinion
of the first sea lord, has been caused. That is your view, Lord Polshan?"</P>

<p>The older man nodded his head.</P>

<p>"Undoubtedly," he said gruffly. "It was a most mad-brained
piece of asininity which any Government has ever perpetrated."</P>

<p>Lord Arthur smiled.</P>

<p>"That is an expression of opinion which will go straight to
your heart, Macrae," he said. "Now the point I wish to mention to you is this:
I am the only member of the Cabinet who shares your view, and I confess that I
do share it, and that I have the greatest fears for the immediate future. I
cannot take any steps without the permission of the Cabinet, because you people
destroyed all initiation, during the last war, when your newspapers turned
Churchill out of office. Anything I do, therefore, must be done off my own
bat."</P>

<p>"Whatever you do, sir," said Sir George, "is done with the
full approval of the sea lords."</P>

<p>Lord Arthur nodded in acknowledgment of this, and went on.
"The fleet is at Spithead, and it is assembled practically under war
conditions. We are patrolling the North Sea, and especially watching the Bight
of Heligoland."</P>

<p>"Where is the German high seas fleet?" asked Grant.</P>

<p>"At Heligoland," said the first lord, "they are having a
little review of their own apparently, but they also are being watched."</P>

<p>"What of poor Vennimore's invention?"</P>

<p>"It will be rigged on every ship by to-morrow night," said
Lord Arthur, "and in the meantime we are patrolling the English Channel very
carefully. At the same time I cannot believe that Germany would take any steps
without a formal declaration of war." The first sea lord muttered something.</P>

<p>"Lord Polshan does not agree with me," said Lord Arthur.</P>

<p>"Agree with you!" snorted the old sea lord, "what did
Germany do in the last war that we should believe that she will be guided by
any process of international law? Is it not the most obvious thing in the world
that when she wants to strike, she will strike without any of the fancy
preliminaries which have marked war in the past? Has she shown you she has any
consideration for treaties? There will be no declaration of war when Germany
moves. The first intimation we shall receive will come in the shape of an
attack--of that you may be sure. Don't you agree, Sir George?" The other officer
nodded.</P>

<p>"I have no doubt whatever in my own mind," he said.</P>

<p>There was a little pause, and then:</P>

<p>"What would you like me to do?" asked Grant.</P>

<p>"I want you to come here to-night," said Lord Arthur, "and
bring with you all the information you have, together with all the documentary
evidence you have to demonstrate Germany's possession of unauthorised ships.
There will be a special meeting of the Cabinet to-morrow--nothing can possibly
happen till then, and by to-morrow I hope we shall not only have the detector
complete, but we shall also know what Germany is going to do. You understand,"
he said at parting, "that I shall probably be kicked out of the Cabinet for
this action, but I am taking that risk. By the way, they tell me that a small
medallion was found on Ballin's body, with the figures '15'" and a skull and
cross-bones. Have you any idea what that indicates?"</P>

<p>Grant nodded.</P>

<p>"That is the emblem of a society in Germany, designed to
keep in memory the humiliation which the German suffered in that year. Ballin
was obviously the head of that society, which was national in every sense."</P>

<p>Grant drove straight from the Admiralty to the hotel where
Ruth Manton was staying, and was shown to her sitting-room.</P>

<p>"Have you packed your trunks?" he asked.</P>

<p>"You didn't think I would, did you?" she asked.</P>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me," he said in despair, "that I have
sacrificed the hundred English sovereigns, and that the state-room I have
engaged for you is to be wasted?"</P>

<p>"You won't have any difficulty in selling the ticket," she
laughed. "If half you say is true, London will be filled with Americans who are
most anxious to get back to their own country. Is there any news?"</P>

<p>"None that I can tell you," he said. "Just before I came
out I saw a telegram from Bremen giving an enthusiastic account of the British
reception at that port. It was obviously written by a German correspondent, and
despatched long before the ships had come into harbour. I want you to promise
me to do something."</P>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</P>

<p>"No, you must promise in the dark," said Grant.</P>

<p>"I don't like to make promises in the dark, but if it
doesn't involve my leaving England, I will promise. What is it?"</P>

<p>"I want you to have your car ready with a good supply of
petrol, and at the first hint of danger get away west as far as you can. You
will be safe in Plymouth, because the two Army Corps we have at Aldershot, and
the two on Salisbury Plain will be able to hold up the invasion for some
time."</P>

<p>She shivered slightly.</P>

<p>"You almost make me frightened, you are so very sure."</P>

<p>He nodded.</P>

<p>"I am very sure," he said.</P>

<p>He kissed her at parting.</P>

<p>"Remember," he said, "I shall not be seeing you again until
this crisis is past, and I rely implicitly upon you carrying out my wishes."</P>

<p>She favoured him with a little curtsy, but behind the
laughter in her eyes was real concern. Grant saw the paper "to bed," went
carefully through the foreign telegrams, and presented himself with his
portfolio of date as the old clock of the Admiralty building was striking
eleven. He was admitted to Lord Arthur's presence immediately. In addition to
the two admirals he had seen in the morning, was a third, a young-looking man
whom Grant remembered to have seen a year before.</P>

<p>"This is Rear-Admiral Branton commanding the Flying
Section," said Lord Arthur. "Have you brought the papers?"</P>

<p>Grant spread them out on the big table, explaining each,
translating little passages in the German documents he had, and was thus
engaged when an officer entered the room.</P>

<p>"What is it?" asked the First Sea Lord.</P>

<p>The young officer's face was troubled.</P>

<p>"We have had a wireless through which I can't understand,"
he said, and laid a little slip of paper on the table. They crowded about the
table and read:--</P>

<br>

<p class="quote">"<span class="smcap">we have seized the edfeld
station&mdash;</span>"
("That's the German
wireless station," explained the officer) "<span class="smcap">&mdash;and
are holding it, though it is
impossible to hold out much longer. tell war office germans
interned...."</span></P>

<br>

<p>Here the message ended. There was a dead silence. The men
looked from one to the other.</P>

<p>"I see," said Lord Arthur quietly. "What do you make of it,
Macrae?"</P>

<p>Grant read the paper again.</P>

<p>"Evidently there was another message which has not been
caught by your station," he said. "I take this to mean that the whole of the
men who have gone to Germany have been interned, and that one party have made a
fight for it, and was sending this message when the wireless station was
stormed."</P>

<p>"There is only one thing to be done," said Lord Arthur.</P>

<p>So far he got when the door was flung open and a man rushed
in. The wireless officer recognised him as one of his operators.</P>

<p>"What is the matter?" he asked quickly.</P>

<p>For a moment the man stood bereft of speech, his
outstretched hands shaking, his lips trembling.</P>

<p>"Sorry, sir," he mumbled at last, "but I had a brother on
the <I>Lion</I>."</P>

<p>"What is it?" asked the First Lord. "Pull yourself together, my lad."</P>

<p>He laid his big hands on the other's shoulder.</P>

<p>"The fleet," gasped the operator, "the battleship cruisers...."</P>

<p>"What?" asked Lord Arthur, growing pale.</P>

<p>"Submarined, sir," whimpered the man, "at half-past ten
without any warning; eighty-three ships--submarined. Oh, my God!"</P>

<p>A telephone bell rang sharply on the first lord's desk. It
was the inter-department 'phone. He picked up the receiver and listened,
answering "Yes" and "No" in an expressionless voice.</P>

<p>Then he hung the receiver up again.</P>

<p>He walked slowly up and down the long room, his hands
thrust in his trousers' pockets, his head upon his breast. Then he spoke.</P>

<p>"The Germans landed in the night at Kemby Cove," he said
huskily, "protected by parallel roads of mines, and by their high sea fleet
they ran their ships ashore, and there are 250,000 men deploying across
England."</P>

<p>Again there was a silence.</P>

<p>"And more to follow," commented the first sea lord.</P>

<p>"And more to follow," repeated the others.</P>

<p>Lord Arthur pulled himself together with a shrug and held
out his hand to Grant.</P>

<p>"Good-night, Macrae," he said, "you have done your work
remarkably well. If we had been as prepared as you we should not have been
fighting Germany on the present terms."</P>

<p>"What are the present terms?" asked Grant.</P>

<p>"They have more than an equality of ships on the sea, and a
considerable superiority of men on land," replied Lord Arthur quietly.</P>

<p>Grant left that chamber--a veritable chamber of death, of
dead hope, dead faith and dead ambition. As he crossed the little court of the
Admiralty, the clock struck twelve, and it seemed to him that it was ringing
the knell of Britain. He went straight back to his office, and found Mr. Holman
Massey waiting--a troubled Mr. Massey and a little tremulous.</P>

<p>"I hear all sorts of strange stories, Macrae," he quavered,
"what's the meaning of it? It's sheer nonsense to say we shall be invaded!
Haven't we got a fleet? Why, we aren't even at war! But if war comes, if war
comes!" he repeated, and thumped the table.</P>

<p>"Well?" asked Grant, wearily.</P>

<p>"If war comes we shall not be afraid," said Mr. Massey
sharply; "we will show the world that in the face of danger England can hold
her own and carry on business as usual."</P>

<p>"Business as usual!"</P>

<p>Grant fell back in his chair, and laughed, and laughed, and laughed.</p>
