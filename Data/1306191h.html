  <h2>FOREWORD</h2>

  <p class="first">SOME of the early incidents in the following novel are
  founded upon a well-known murder mystery which took place in 1872. The facts
  of this case can easily be ascertained; an account of the crime is included
  in several collections of studies in criminology.</p>

  <p>Nothing but the bare outline and a few unimportant details have been used,
  and all the characters are entirely imaginary and are not portraits, in any
  way, of those connected with the actual crime of 1872 and the two arrests
  that followed.</p>

  <p>Even where fiction has to follow fact as to type in dealing with
  detective, magistrate, landlady, waiter, etc., the characters that fulfil
  these parts are fictional and in no way even based upon those of the persons
  who were involved in the circumstances on which the first part of this novel
  is founded.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">"YOU look as if you was going to cut your throat."</p>

  <p>"Funny, Min, I was thinking of it."</p>

  <p>"Got any beer or gin&mdash;a mouthful of the real 'knock me down'?"</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't."</p>

  <p>"Oh, ain't it shocking. Any luck for the pantomime?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'm not sure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've had an offer for one dance and the chorus-but only twenty-five
  shillings."</p>

  <p>"I can't get that, I don't think. Well what did you come in here for? I'm
  thinking of suicide, I tell you; a pity you disturbed me. Oh, I'm tired."</p>

  <p>"Who isn't?"</p>

  <p>Minnie Palmer flopped on to the broken stool inside the dressing-room
  underneath the stage; her dirty white muslin skirts and the tarnished
  spangles on her tattered bodice were crudely fashioned to represent the
  petals and calyx of a lily, a torn wig was pulled over her head, her small
  features were heavily outlined in cheap greasepaint.</p>

  <p>The other woman glanced at her visitor with cool ease; she was seated by a
  deal table which was scattered with hares' feet, rags, glass jewels, pots of
  cream and rouge, odd thumbed playing cards, mugs and empty bottles&mdash;all
  flyblown and filthy.</p>

  <p>Her green and red dress was meant to represent a moss rose, a green cap
  was tied over her yellow wig; her face, without make-up or powder, looked
  pallid, almost featureless in the harsh light of the gas-jet which, enclosed
  in a wire cage, flared from a bracket on the dirty plaster wall, above which
  were open rafters hung with cobwebs. This bare acrid flame was reflected in
  the three-cornered fragment of mirror that stood on the dressing-table.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you get some paint on your face?" complained Minnie Palmer.
  "You look a sight."</p>

  <p>"Go away&mdash;I haven't drink&mdash;no gin&mdash;no beer&mdash;no port
  wine."</p>

  <p>"Who's got anything? You're unlucky, aren't you, dearie? I always thought
  you had such style, too&mdash;but no one seems to notice it."</p>

  <p>The other's light-grey eyes flashed and hardened beneath the absurd curls
  of false hair.</p>

  <p>"You little fool, who are you to notice anything? Leave me alone, can't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I want a bit of company&mdash;seems dismal here to-night--the last
  performance&mdash;the house isn't half-full, and outside it's as cold as
  hell&mdash;a black frost, too."</p>

  <p>"Christmas Eve, darling. Don't forget to hang your stocking up."</p>

  <p>"Well, you needn't speak so bitter." Minnie Palmer, the lily, stretched
  out her plump pink legs in wrinkling cotton flesh-coloured-stockings. "I've
  had a bottle of scent&mdash;'Jockey Club,' too&mdash;from Charlie&mdash;and
  Jim's coming along with some bottled porter and fruit from Covent Garden.
  Ain't you got anyone? Seems a pity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That you interrupted me&mdash;yes&mdash;when I was about to cut my
  throat?" smiled Belle Adair; she picked up from the table a clasp-knife near
  a platter on which was an end of a loaf, a cold half-eaten red herring and
  some trimmings of ham fat.</p>

  <p>"Well, I never! You needn't make such silly jokes," protested Minnie
  Palmer uneasily. "You always were a rum 'un, you were. Everyone says
  so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do they?"</p>

  <p>"You don't make friends easy, do you? The girls are all a bit afraid of
  you, you know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are they?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's because you're a lady."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that I'm&mdash;a&mdash;a 'lady'?" asked Belle, still
  fingering the knife; the steel plade was tarnished with vinegar drops.</p>

  <p>"Anyone can see it; and a nice life of it you've had, to come to this, eh,
  Belle? Don't stare so, dearie. I like you."</p>

  <p>Minnie Palmer rose, hesitated when she pulled open the door and looked
  into the dark passage and stairs on to which the dressing-rooms gave. The
  scrapings of the small orchestra sounded from the stage above.</p>

  <p>"Pretty&mdash;isn't it? I'd like to dance to that&mdash;it's better than
  the music we've got; they're using it for the pantomime, too."</p>

  <p>"It's old&mdash;The Sicilian Vespers.' I remember it in Paris. No, I
  don't, I don't remember anything." Belle put down the knife and, taking up
  the hare's foot, began to brush rouge into her pasty cheeks.</p>

  <p>"You've been to Paris, have you?" sighed Minnie. "I'll bet you have, and
  other places, too. You're a rum 'un. Jenny's gone to Paris&mdash;<i>he</i>
  took her after all. My, it makes your mouth water&mdash;there's the great
  Exhibition next year and the Prince over there, and I don't know how many
  other Kings and Queens."</p>

  <p>"Except the Queen of Spain, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Oh, they don't ask <i>her</i>&mdash;that's funny, ain't it? A Queen and
  no better than we are." Minnie Palmer laughed, yawned and stretched.
  "Wouldn't it be grand? Just to think of it makes you curl up
  inside&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Does it? What difference will it make to Jenny or would it make to you?
  Neither of you is so very pretty nor so very young, and neither of you has
  any talent at all. Think of all the charming creatures with money to spend
  who will be offering themselves for sale in Paris now."</p>

  <p>"I don't like your way of putting things, I'm sure." Minnie Palmer tossed
  up her head with the artificial flaxen curls and dirty lilies, but her face
  was wrinkled as if she were about to cry. "The world's not so bad, sneer as
  you like, and we are better off than some. Poor Daisy's been round here
  again."</p>

  <p>Belle Adair was carelessly rubbing powdered charcoal round her eyes as she
  interrupted in her low, incisive voice:</p>

  <p>"Has she? She can't get work for the pantomime. They won't look at
  her."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't she know it? She wanted to see you it was when you were on the
  stage&mdash;she's coming back."</p>

  <p>"What for?" Belle blew the dust off the top of the rice powder in a
  lidless cardboard box printed with bunches of violets. "I see her every
  night."</p>

  <p>"She said she was going out this evening, she wanted to borrow your
  salmon-pink feathers."</p>

  <p>Belle Adair was silent; her face looked odd and ugly under the
  disfigurement of rice powder and rouge, her eyes were restless and impatient
  in the smudges of black.</p>

  <p>Minnie Palmer rose; her healthy young body, inclined to fullness, seemed
  about to burst the sweat-stained, spangled bodice; she hitched up one of the
  sagging pink stockings and tightened the garter of frazzled ribbon.</p>

  <p>"What would you give to get out of all this?" she asked vigorously,
  turning her insolent, good-humoured direct glance towards the red and green
  figure staring into the fragment of mirror. "I don't know how you stand it,
  that I don't. How do they think I'm going on in these shoes? Mind you, I went
  past Claridge's to-day&mdash;well, why shouldn't we have a taste of it? I
  mean we don't have any <i>luck</i>." Probing the other's silence she added:
  "You've known what it might be&mdash;before you got into trouble. Oh, I'm
  cold! A glass of port with a lot of sugar in it&mdash;or threepennyworth of
  'cream of the valley'&mdash;haven't you sixpence, Belle, dear? Bobs would run
  for it in a moment. Just to warm us up before we go on?"</p>

  <p>"I've nothing. You asked me what I'd give to get out of here? Well, I've
  nothing to give, don't you understand? Nothing to offer you for drink,
  nothing to give&mdash;nothing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop a bit!" cried Minnie Palmer, in a half-whispering tone. "You
  frighten me speaking so cruel&mdash;it is Christmas Eve, as you said, and I
  mean to have some merry-making&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go away! Go away!" Belle looked over her shoulder and spoke with quiet
  vehemence; Minnie, afraid, paused at the door.</p>

  <p>"There's the call&mdash;well, don't you be late, or it will be the deuce
  and all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tapping her small foot in the worn pink ballet shoe, Belle repeated:</p>

  <p>"Go away!&mdash;will you, go away!"</p>

  <p>Minnie Palmer hunched up her thick shoulders impudently, to cover her
  timidity.</p>

  <p>"Oh, here's a set-out! Don't bother yourself, my pet, about me."</p>

  <p>As soon as she had flounced away, Belle went swiftly to the cupboard, in
  the corner of which hung some theatrical dresses, skirts, gowns and shawls,
  bonnets and pairs of cloth boots which, tied by their laces, dangled from a
  peg. In the pocket of a trailing skirt of white gauze she found a flask of
  gin and with an air of dry reserve, tipped it up and drank.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a pretty scene, this <i>divertissement</i> that was
one of the
  music-hall 'turns.' At the back of the stage a transparency showed a terrace
  of blooms behind a gigantic silver cobweb spangled with dew-drops. Either
  side, leaves of gold tinsel quivered on invisible net. In the centre the
  fairies from the flowers gathered round the "Queen of the Flowers," a white
  rose, holding a wand on the end of which sparkled a glistening star. Her two
  principal attendants were Minnie Palmer, the lily, and Belle Adair, the moss
  rose; beyond them was the violet, the carnation, the tiger lily, the
  sunflower, the iris and the hollyhock, an odd bouquet swiftly forming under
  the rosey glow from the lanterns in the wings, in front of which red paper
  had been fixed. The foot-lights had also been shrouded with soft shades and
  this warm hue of the foreground contrasted with the ethereal silverness of
  the enchanted distance.</p>

  <p>The music, taken from popular tunes, was soft and flowing; particularly
  pleasing was the little waltz to which the Moss Rose circled for her short
  <i>pas seul</i>. This melody, dedicated to a lovely and beloved English
  Princess on her recovery from rheumatic fever, was well known and much liked
  in London, and the audience tapped feet and half-emptied beer mugs, hummed
  with zest as the familiar opening bars were struck up by violins and
  piano.</p>

  <p>The flower fairies withdrew into the painted side-slips and the Moss Rose
  pirouetted on her toes; Minnie Palmer, striking an attitude beside her,
  whispered: "Pretty, isn't it? Don't you wish that you were dancing it with a
  real gentleman?"</p>

  <p>With her arms folded on her breast Belle Adair waltzed round the stage;
  she was taller, more slender than any of the other dancers, she had a good
  ear and was light of foot. In the flattering blurred light she gave an
  illusion of beauty; the swirling pink skirts like petals, the green bodice
  like folded leaves, the gracefully held head with the verdant
  cap&mdash;something ardent, proud and swift in poise and movement&mdash;had a
  transient quality of enchantment. But the audience was not pleased, the
  applause was feeble; it was always the same with Belle, she never made a
  success, there was something remote and alien about her, some quality of
  disdain and coldness that made people uneasy, even hostile. The music jerked
  into a polka, Minnie. Palmer bounced forward, and, winking and grinning,
  flung her shapely legs, in the pink stockings and laced boots, about in a
  frenzied caricature of a ball dance. The audience roared with delight. The
  Moss Rose, forgotten, slipped in amidst the other fairies and, mechanically
  smiling, raised one end of a garland of paper blossoms that was lowered from
  the flies to enchain the girls with festoons of flowers as the curtain fell
  and the stage hands came on to clear the stage for the next turn&mdash;a
  Chinese juggler.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"I ought to have the waltz in the pantomime," complained
Minnie Palmer. "I
  look better in pink, too. Say, please, that I ought to have the waltz!"</p>

  <p>She stood in the wings, breathing hard, clinging to the arm of the tired
  stage manager who leant against one of the roughly painted boards that was
  daubed to look like a tree..</p>

  <p>"You do fine and well as you are, don't you, Missus?" He had been playing
  the clown in an earlier turn with the ventriloquist and his face was still
  streaked with red and white.</p>

  <p>"Pretty well, but Belle's no good&mdash;and that's such a sweet, pretty
  tune." She hummed a bar of "Moss Rose."</p>

  <p>"Please now&mdash;Belle's more like a lily, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>He laughed so loud that she was startled: "We'll see in the morning,
  Missus. Belle's a fine dancer as I think, and 'Moss Rose' is her
  style&mdash;genteel and dainty. You can see that she's a lady."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that's what <i>they</i> want? Genteel indeed! Why doesn't
  she go where she belongs if she's a lady&mdash;a real, high-born lady?"</p>

  <p>"The more's the pity if she's a lady, Missus. But, I'd have to ask Mr.
  Lode about changing parts, and it's getting late and damned cold, so be off
  with you. Besides, this is the last performance before the pantomime and I
  don't know as the ballet will go into 'Puss in Boots' even now."</p>

  <p>Belle passed them as they were talking; she had been lingering at the back
  of the darkened, draughty stage where, without the lights and the music, the
  scene before which she had danced was merely tinfoil paper, dirty rags and
  chalked canvas. An odious spot, but less odious than the streets; a smell of
  sawdust, oranges and stale beer came from behind the drop-cloth that formed
  the background for the juggler.</p>

  <p>She knew at once that they were discussing her and that Minnie Palmer was
  trying to get the "Moss Rose" dance for the pantomime which opened on Boxing
  Day. Perhaps they would turn her out of "Puss in Boots" for which she had
  been engaged; she was not very successful and they would be glad to save the
  thirty shillings a week. Even if they allowed her to stay she would not get
  another engagement easily afterwards; she could not please, no, never had she
  been able to please a crowd&mdash;nor even single individuals, "save a few,
  and they are lost." Failure everywhere, failure. "Genteel and dainty," she
  had heard the miserable Figg call her, and yet any coarse fellow, drunk on
  bottled porter or gin, would pass her by for Minnie Palmer.</p>

  <p>"What am I thinking? I am tired, tired out. If only I had some more drink
  or some opium, and a little poison to put in it, so that I could sleep and
  never wake again."</p>

  <p>When she returned to the dismal little dressing-room, screened off so
  carelessly from the piled-up properties and the green room, she found that
  the three girls with whom she shared it had left the theatre, but that Daisy
  Arrow was waiting for her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>you!</i>" Belle tore off the green cap, the wig. "Why do you come
  here pestering me?"</p>

  <p>"I want the pink feathers, my pet. Minnie told you, did she? I'm going out
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the Argyll Rooms or the Alhambra, anywhere there's a bit of fun."</p>

  <p>"You're a fool," said Belle with an emphasis of her detached air of cold
  ease. "Who will you find to-night? A fog, cold Christmas Eve&mdash;and those
  feathers aren't for the winter&mdash;they'll seem silly a night like
  this."</p>

  <p>"Maybe they'll make someone look at me&mdash;Belle, if I find&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop&mdash;you know I won't hear of these things&mdash;from you. Be
  quiet. Why should I give you the feathers? They're fresh and clean, aren't
  they? I'm keeping them for the summer."</p>

  <p>"I'll pay for them to-morrow, if I have any luck. I suppose you'd like a
  couple of shillings, my love?" Daisy Arrow spoke flatly without wheedling or
  insolence. "I heard from Min that they didn't like your dance&mdash;'Moss
  Rose' is so sweet, too. The Lord Harry knows what they do want. Come with me
  to the Argyll, Belle, dear."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"We might pick someone up. Oh, don't stare at me with that sneer; maybe
  I'm not good enough for the back row of the ballet&mdash;but I might find
  some fool&mdash;drunk enough."</p>

  <p>"Did I say I wouldn't have any of your nasty talk?"</p>

  <p>"What's the use of being so hoity-toity?" Daisy Arrow spoke without hope
  or anger. "If you won't come, well, lend me your feathers."</p>

  <p>"A night like this! No. No one but a drab would wear pink feathers in the
  street in a fog."</p>

  <p>"No one but a drab would be in the street, would she&mdash;dearie&mdash;a
  night like this?" Daisy Arrow spoke in the same quiet tone. "They won't have
  me for the pantomime&mdash;it's remembered against me that I'm not strong and
  cough, and sometimes faint. I've got one and three-pence and I owe Mother
  Bulke fifteen shillings."</p>

  <p>Belle Adair stripped off her stage clothes until she stood in her broken
  stays and faded petticoat, a beautifully shaped woman with exquisite arms and
  shoulders. Her hair, flattened and greasy from the wig, was dark, the colour
  of a dried bay-leaf, and was fastened in a knot at the base of her neck; her
  face, on which the paint flared and melted, was pinched, faintly
  distorted.</p>

  <p>"Ma Bulke wouldn't turn you out, Christmas Eve. And if she
  did?&mdash;What's before either of us? As well now as tomorrow, or the next
  day."</p>

  <p>"You'll speak different when you've a drain inside you. Make haste, it'll
  soon be too late for anything." Daisy Arrow sat up. "I'm hungry."</p>

  <p>She was a delicate-looking woman who had been lovely; her hair was a
  magnificent chestnut-copper hue and contrasted finely with the exquisite
  outline of her small features. Her throat was long and graceful, but her
  complexion was blotched, her teeth broken and her large dark eyes injected
  with blood, while her wide lips were ragged and shapeless. Beneath her
  cleverly worn Cashmere shawl, threadbare and smelling of the cleaner's resin
  and sulphur, showed a dark skirt with carefully mended flounces and
  thin-soled boots, varnished over the cracks. On the knot of her sumptuous
  hair was a faded bonnet of green taffeta that emphasised her shabbiness; her
  air was one of lassitude and fatigue.</p>

  <p>Belle Adair glanced over her, then pulling open the cupboard, took out
  from beneath the white gauze skirt, in the pocket of which was the empty gin
  bottle, a lidless cardboard box; in this, wrapped in silver paper, was a
  plume of curled ostrich feathers of an unusual tint of livid pink. Why she
  had kept and treasured this scrap of finery when all else had gone, Belle did
  not know; she had worn it on the stage once when she had played a super's
  part of a society beauty at a fête of pasteboard grass and paper flowers. She
  kept it at the theatre as the other women at Mrs. Bulke's would always be
  wanting to borrow it, and even here it was not safe; even Daisy Arrow had to
  remember and come after it. Belle glanced at the dirty knife by the red
  herring and the curling, glistening strips of ham fat, and smiled. How odd
  that she was concerned with this worthless piece of rubbish, she who had been
  about to make herself ready for a pauper's grave. She flung the plume on to
  the dressing-table.</p>

  <p>"Take it&mdash;and go away."</p>

  <p>With a flash of animation that made her appear quite charming, Daisy Arrow
  snatched the feathers; the mount was garnished by a cluster of dried grasses
  and the iris-hued head of a bird of paradise. With a skilful hand the young
  woman, peering into the scrap of mirror, arranged the plumes at the side of
  her bonnet and pinned it into place so that the rosy fronds fell becomingly
  on to the lustrous hair.</p>

  <p>Belle, huddling into her dark street clothes, studied her keenly,
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what you've been in your time, Daisy Arrow? And what your name
  really is, or how it is that you're quite so friendless, wretched and
  desperately poor?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose, my pet, I could put all these questions to you and get no
  answer. What does it matter?"</p>

  <p>"You're right&mdash;what does it matter? But you're a little better than
  the others," retorted Belle with her dry, casual ease. "I should say you'd
  had some education. Shall I take this umbrella? No, it's foggy, not raining,
  and the cover is full of holes&mdash;yet I've no other shawl, and if this
  were to get sodden...I ought to have used the knife."</p>

  <p>"You're a rum 'un," said Daisy Arrow, pulling out her curls under the
  bright feathers. "The things you think of! Come to the Argyll Rooms and
  you'll forget about umbrellas and shawls&mdash;and the foggy night." She
  peered closer with a sudden keenness at the other woman: "Used the knife?
  What do you mean?" She put her hand across her throat and as Belle disdained
  to answer, added: "I see&mdash;well, here's temptation out of the way,
  dearie." She picked up the coarse clasp-knife, shut it, and slipped it into
  her beaded reticule. "I'll throw it away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get along or you'll be late," said Belle, watching her without comment on
  her action.</p>

  <p>Daisy Arrow rose; she had a certain art in arranging her worn clothes that
  made her look quite elegant; the fantastic feathers did not appear unsuitable
  on that well-set burnished hair; she peered at herself in the mirror, turning
  her head gracefully over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You think that I look like a lady, do you?" she smiled.</p>

  <p>"No, you are just lady-like, genteel. I dare say you were a gentlewoman's
  maid or in a small shop&mdash;haberdasher's, milliner's, or something like
  that."</p>

  <p>For a second Daisy Arrow looked startled, then her weary indolence dropped
  over her like a veil.</p>

  <p>"Well, it ain't no good for us to pry into each other's past, is it,
  dearie? They all say that <i>you're</i> a real born lady&mdash;but that
  hasn't helped you much, has it?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm as nasty a slut as you are, or as Minnie Palmer is, or as Mrs.
  Bulke herself. I'm turning out the gas before old Bobs comes in, scolding and
  swearing."</p>

  <p>Daisy Arrow pulled open the door.</p>

  <p>"Well, wish me good luck, my pet."</p>

  <p>"Good luck," said Belle, and as the other young woman drifted away into
  the darkness beyond the door, she added listlessly: "What good luck could you
  have, save to drop into the earth&mdash;easily, quickly?"</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle Adair hesitated as she left the Cambridge Music Hall;
in front of
  the lit portico the bills for the pantomime were already in place; above the
  door a huge painted, booted cat stared into the fog, and the gaslights flared
  on the crimson letters: "Puss in Boots." The bitter frost and fog had cleared
  the streets of all but the homeless; the huddled filth of Holborn was bidden
  by the thick swathes of dirty vapour that the street lamps only faintly
  dispersed. Belle, whose clothes were plain and dark, and about whose person
  there was nothing flamboyant or voluptuous, did not in the least resemble the
  capering Moss Rose fairy in the pink tights and rosy skirts, but rather
  seemed a nursery governess or some shabby genteel widow. As, urged by a
  sudden impulse, she turned into the fog, there was nothing remarkable about
  her, save her proud poise and the swiftness of her walk. Pulling her veil
  over the face from which the grease-paint had been too hastily wiped, leaving
  stains behind on the small features, she made her rapid simple calculations.
  Thirty shillings when she was paid yesterday&mdash;ten shillings for two
  weeks' rent, five shillings for food and gin&mdash;fifteen shillings, then,
  to last the week and she must have new stockings, soap, her shoes mended. She
  had meant to buy Tommy Bulke a toy for Christmas, but apathy had prevented
  her and now the shops would be shut. Supposing the Cambridge decided that
  they did not want her in the pantomime and gave the Moss Rose waltz to lively
  Minnie Palmer? Perhaps she was a fool not to have gone with Daisy Arrow to
  the Alhambra or the Argyll Rooms&mdash;but it would have been no good,
  shabby, dull and weary as she was. Even Daisy, who was prettier, would be
  disappointed; she would come home alone and cry herself to sleep as she so
  often did&mdash;what an odious thing that her room was so near that you could
  hear almost everything that she did.</p>

  <p>Bell paused in the fog; a constable in his oilskin cape passed, eyeing her
  suspiciously. "I suppose, if I go on like this, I shall get to prison. It
  might happen any night. Why didn't I use that knife? I was too tired. There's
  the river, but it's too far. Daisy said that she was hungry&mdash;well, so am
  I&mdash;it will be too late to ask Mrs. Bulke for anything. I had better get
  a drink. Sixpence, a shilling, yes, that would be well spent on a drink,
  something strong."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The gin palaces of Holborn were nearly as sumptuous as
those of the
  Tottenham Court Road or Drury Lane. Belle had the choice of several brilliant
  establishments as she proceeded slowly over the greasy pavement through the
  murk. The performance at the Cambridge would not yet be over; it was about
  eleven o'clock and the shopkeepers were putting up shutters and lowering
  their blinds; there was a glimpse through the fog of scarlet cheese and
  pallid butter as the cheesemonger shrouded his windows; there was the tinkle
  of the chemist's shop-door bell as it closed for the night, a glow of light
  from the baked-potato man's fire, where a few ragged children clustered to
  enjoy the warmth, and in the gutter a woman trailed with her arms folded in a
  ragged shawl, muttering a song in a broken falsetto. Belle passed these, into
  the darkness of the fog again that caused her eyes to smart and started her
  coughing; she then paused before the gas lamps in gilt burners flaring behind
  the plate-glass window of "The Bunch of Grapes." Belle pushed open the
  ground-glass door marked "Wine promenade" and joined the close-pressed crowd
  about the gleaming mahogany bar beyond which rows of painted casks showed
  behind the carefully polished brass rail. Belle edged through the crowd with
  a detached air and leant against the counter, eyeing the baskets of soft
  biscuits and raisin cake with disgust. She ordered half a quarters of gin and
  peppermint hot from the young woman with the large blue glass beads who was
  dispensing the spirits. As her lips sipped the mixture her cold eyes, under
  the dirty veil turned up to just above her mouth, glanced at some of her
  companions; the man in the moth-eaten fur cap with the diseased face, three
  bonnetless washerwomen drinking rum-shrub, the Irish labourer, the tattered
  women munching stale seed-cake and sipping port&mdash;all ill, wretched,
  hideous.</p>

  <p>"If I continue to drink I shall soon be like these&mdash;how long would it
  take? It has not really got hold of me yet. I could stop it if I wanted.
  Sometimes I take nothing for days together&mdash;yes, if it were worth while
  and something else offered, I could stop. But it is not worth while and
  nothing else offers."</p>

  <p>No one took any notice of her; when she had first entered public-houses
  she had been the object of much ribald attention, now she could stay as long
  as she pleased and no one troubled her, save for a formal commonplace or a
  maudlin confidence.</p>

  <p>"I must be beginning to look just like these others&mdash;a draggled
  hussy&mdash;no one sees that my hands, my figure are different, perhaps they
  are not different any longer. When did I begin to be so familiar with this?
  When I left <i>him</i>&mdash;but haven't I decided that I won't remember
  anything?"</p>

  <p>Behind the blur given to her senses by fatigue and alcohol her mind was
  cool and acute, she did not for a moment lose her reserved dignity; when she
  had finished her drink she pulled down her veil. After the sordid filth of
  the under-stage dressing-room from which she had come, and before the sordid
  misery of her cold bedroom in Great Hogarth Street, there was a certain
  solace in the opulent vulgarity of the gin palace, in the gilt, the bright
  new paint, the stucco flowers, the polished mirrors, the gleaming casks, the
  fan-shaped flares of gas which ate up the dirty yellow fog. But she spent no
  more on drink than the shilling she had allowed herself. When she had reached
  that limit she lifted her faded flounces from the sanded floor and with a
  lady's smile of detached courtesy, passed through the drinkers and out into
  the fog which had become so dense that the street lamps were but dim haloes
  in the dingy murk. Belle knew her way perfectly; for some time she had been
  going between Great Hogarth Street and the Cambridge; she knew all the shops,
  the chemists with the poppy-heads, the chandlers, the sweetstuff woman where
  the lollipops were boiled in the basement and filled the air with a smell of
  hot sugar, the baker, the bird fancier, and, at the corner where she had to
  turn, the pawnbroker who called himself a silversmith. Even through the fog
  the transparency at the door with three red balls on a blue ground and some
  rubbed letters showed brightly against the gaslight behind. There were some
  of Belle's one-time possessions among the stringless fiddles, cracked flutes,
  riveted china and cheap silver articles in the pawnshop windows, among them a
  plain ring which was inscribed inside with a man's name and the motto
  "<i>Thine, for ever and ever.</i>" Belle turned this corner guided by the
  smear of red and blue on the door and saw a woman seated huddled in the
  entrance&mdash;it was the singer whom she had passed in the gutter before she
  entered the gin palace. Belle paused; the creature reminded her of Daisy
  Arrow&mdash;the reddish hair, the tattered silk bonnet, the thin burst shoes,
  the dirty pink stockings full of holes&mdash;Daisy, perhaps next year or the
  year after, Daisy, gripped by consumption and refused admittance to the
  Alhambra or the Argyll Rooms. "Myself, next year or the year after."</p>

  <p>She took a shilling from her pocket and stooped over the woman who seemed
  unconscious or asleep or drunk.</p>

  <p>"If I were to give you this, would you know where to get a lodging for the
  night?"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" The woman looked up from the damp step, coughed and pulled together
  her gawdy thin attire round her. "What did you say?"</p>

  <p>"A shilling is all I can spare."</p>

  <p>The woman clutched it, muttering stupidly.</p>

  <p>"Can you find a bed?" asked Belle.</p>

  <p>"A bed? What use is a bed to me?" She tottered to her feet. "Are the
  public-houses still open?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have just come from 'The Bunch of Grapes.'"</p>

  <p>"That's across the road, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; good-night."</p>

  <p>Belle watched the slovenly figure stagger from her huddled position and
  disappear into the fog; there was someone more wretched than herself, someone
  who would not be employed even at the Cambridge, to whom even Mrs. Bulke
  would not give a room, someone who had no hope of anything save a bed at a
  pauper ward, a grave in the pauper's ditch. "I don't know why I don't end it
  now, I really don't."</p>

  <p>Without haste or agitation Belle went down the long street with the broken
  flagstone pavement, passed better shops shuttered against thieves, passed
  genteel houses darkened for the night, with here and there the light of a
  Christmas party showing through a chink in the curtains and shutters, passed
  the open spaces, crowded with bare trees, of handsome squares, and so to
  Great Hogarth Street and to No. 12 of a row of neatly built houses with
  closely veiled, dirty windows with broken panes, with worn doors that stood
  ajar, and broken rusty railings guarding areas. There was a light in the
  basement of No. 12 and the sound of cheerful, hoarse voices; across the
  tattered muslin at the barred windows had been hung a festoon of artificial
  flowers.</p>

  <p>Belle entered; the door slipped from her cold hand and slammed. A voice
  shouted up from the basement:</p>

  <p>"Who's that?"</p>

  <p>"Belle&mdash;shall I leave the door shut?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet, Daisy ain't back&mdash;give her a bit longer."</p>

  <p>"But it's nearly midnight, dark and foggy&mdash;someone might slip
  in."</p>

  <p>"Not here, dearie!" bellowed the voice from below good-humouredly. "They
  know us&mdash;come along down and have a drain. We are having a bit o'
  supper, Tommy and all, ain't we&mdash;Tommy, my love?"</p>

  <p>Belle left the door ajar and leant against the dirty wall of the narrow
  passage; darkness was round her in rising waves; she had wished for death,
  attempted death that very evening, but now, suddenly, she was in a panic at
  the thought of the darkness of annihilation, of the damp clay of a London
  grave, afraid of the end, even of the end of misery. She clasped her bosom
  and her eyes fluttered for a second as if a mortal chill was on her flesh.
  The hoarse invitation was repeated from the basement. Belle fled from the
  dark and stumbled down the stairs to the light.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The little kitchen was cheerful, the large grate had been
newly blackened,
  there were sprigs of holly behind the pictures of Her Majesty and the Duke of
  Wellington, a stiff bough of evergreen had been thrust behind the dark print
  of <i>The Last Judgment</i>. There was a white twill cloth on the table and
  plenty of food remains, kidney pies, cold ham, cakes, Dorset butter, Dr.
  Kitchener's Zest, Harvey's Relish, bottles of stout, of sherry and of port.
  Molly, the Irish servant, was looking after Tommy, a pallid boy of ten years
  old who was wearing a blue paper cap and hugging a wooden horse painted with
  large black spots. Mrs. Bulke was making tea from a huge sooty kettle for a
  few of her lodgers who declared themselves "off the drink," being already
  crying drunk and supporting themselves against the table while they exchanged
  reminiscences of some lost or imagined gentility when Christmas Eve had been
  "different." The company was completed by a very old woman who kept a cast
  clothes shop of the better sort and who found many clients among the ladies
  of No. 12. Wrapped in a pale Andalusian shawl, still exquisite in texture
  even though long since discarded by some fastidious lady's maid, Mrs.
  MacKinnon sipped her port quietly and contributed nothing to the merriment
  which Mrs. Bulke sustained with lively talk, with winks, with snatches of
  song, and at all of which Molly, joggling the boy on her knee, laughed
  inordinately.</p>

  <p>With ready kindness the landlady pushed Belle into the shiny horse-hair
  chair by the grate.</p>

  <p>"If your feet ain't wet, dearie. And you late! Such a night! Daisy said
  she was going to fetch you&mdash;why didn't you go with her?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't wish to&mdash;I was tired."</p>

  <p>"You'll do yourself no good moping. Fill Mrs. Mac's glass, Molly. There
  ain't so many good people in the world that one can afford to miss 'em."</p>

  <p>"Not in these hard times," croaked the old woman, extending a dirty
  gnarled hand holding her empty tumbler, tapping her forehead with a finger of
  the other.</p>

  <p>"Isn't Tommy up very late?" shuddered Belle, crouching over the red coals
  showing behind the bars to which hung fragments of half-burnt orange peel and
  sausage skin.</p>

  <p>"Bless 'is heart! It's a party, ain't it? And he's enjoying his little
  self, ain't he?"</p>

  <p>Fanny Bulke smiled round good-humouredly on her guests; she was a handsome
  woman with a hard-grained red in her cheeks, a dark down on her upper lip, a
  coil of brassy gold hair round her head. She had been in a circus in her
  youth, a trick rider until she broke her hip-bone, and there was something
  strong and bold about her, as if she was used to handling a whip. Her
  second-hand dress of puce cloth, garnished with torn braid and rows of
  buttons with gaps in their ranks, and the heavy folds of thick cloth, gave an
  almost monstrous air to her massive figure. She seemed to loom, to swell, to
  fill the room, there was a certain menace even in her limp.</p>

  <p>"Can't you give us a tune, Belle? Can't you play and sing to us a bit?
  That 'Moss Rose' now, that you danced in so nicely."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I'm going to dance in it any more; if they keep it for the
  pantomime, they'll give it to Minnie Palmer."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bulke was always loud in sympathy, in condemnation, too.</p>

  <p>"You ought to make more of yourself, you don't take any trouble; there's
  some burnt cork on your face still and not a bit of rouge."</p>

  <p>"Well, you find me past everything, no doubt," said Belle, crouching over
  the grate and peering into the ashes which were mingled with egg-shells and
  apple parings. "And I do too, I think."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't go so far as to say that, dearie." Mrs. Bulke lowered her
  powerful voice. "But you seem to make no effort, not generally speaking. Why,
  you're not so old&mdash;and with a bit of trouble you might take heart
  again."</p>

  <p>Belle glanced over her shoulder with a smile so bitter and ironical that
  even Mrs. Bulke became a little downcast and sighed, smoothing the waist of
  the puce frock. But she was not silenced.</p>

  <p>"There's Florrie and May," she whispered, jerking her gawdy head towards
  the two women at the table. "They're a bit older than you, <i>aren't</i>
  they? They don't take much trouble with themselves, do they?"</p>

  <p>"No, I've often wondered why you keep them on or how they pay their rent
  and buy their food."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bulke winked, and they gave a drunken grin.</p>

  <p>"You might 'ave guessed. They find me new lodgers. They go to the stations
  and the coach-stops, and if there's any nice fresh young girl as doesn't know
  where to go, Florrie and May make up to her and tell her of No. 12 and the
  cosy place it is."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" whispered Belle; she stared down at her hands, opening and shutting
  them, examining them as if she had never seen them before.</p>

  <p>"They brought Jenny here."</p>

  <p>"Jenny who went to Paris? I remember how she cried, poor little dear."</p>

  <p>"Well," smiled Mrs. Bulke, "we all cried once, I dare say, and I don't
  suppose she's crying now, do you, dearie? What I was thinking was, if you're
  out of luck, or they don't keep you on at the 'ails&mdash;why, you might go
  out with Florrie and May sometimes. You're genteel, Belle, a lady born, like.
  And there are some as wouldn't come for the others who'd listen to you."</p>

  <p>"Who would they be?"</p>

  <p>"Young, silly girls as come from good homes who want a bit of fun, but
  who'd be scared of Florrie&mdash;and May's not too careful with her
  talk."</p>

  <p>Belle rose suddenly; she lurched forward and it seemed as if she were
  about to fall.</p>

  <p>"Eh, dearie, you take a cup of tea, good and strong&mdash;it's the drink
  on an empty stomach."</p>

  <p>"I haven't touched a drop of your stuff."</p>

  <p>"But you had some on the way, I know you did, now then? Come now, a cup of
  tea."</p>

  <p>"Nothing like it," nodded Mrs. MacKinnon, "nothing like it," she repeated
  with a shrill giggle, stroking Maggie Tealeaves the cat.</p>

  <p>Belle moved to the piano with the stained and faded, pleated red silk
  front that stood in the corner, and sank on to the rubbed leather
  music-stool. It had been left behind by a lodger who had stayed a year at No.
  12, then gone out one day and never come back.</p>

  <p>"That's right," smiled Mrs. Bulke. "Now, Tommy, pet, you listen to the
  pretty tune. La, la"&mdash;she hummed to herself.</p>

  <p>Belle had her back to them all so that no one could see the distortions of
  her face. As her fingers ran over the stained keys, some of which were mute
  and some jangled, she stared at the picture of <i>The Last Judgment</i> under
  the fly-spotted glass that hung before her and above the piano, half-shadowed
  by that stiff bough of green yew. Such riven heavens, such split rocks, such
  cascades of fire, such giving up of the quick and the dead to the terrors of
  eternity! Did the painter think that grandiose scene could frighten anyone,
  those clean, cool angels, that wide expanse of pure black sky, even those
  darkling pits&mdash;could they alarm one who had not the courage to slit her
  throat? One who had just been asked to wheedle young, pretty, fresh girls to
  No. 12?</p>

  <p>Belle played on the broken piano.</p>

  <p>"She's got a good figure," mused Mrs. Bulke to herself, looking at the
  neat shape on the fat stool. "And with a nice pair of stays&mdash;I don't
  know why she don't do better."</p>

  <p>They listened to the music, all but Tommy, whose wizened, dirty face had
  fallen against Molly's slatternly bosom in uneasy sleep and wheezy, heavy
  breathing.</p>

  <p>Belle began to sing; she had a low pleasing voice, true and clear.</p>

  <p>The five women were impressed, not pleased; the song was sad, remote, you
  couldn't beat time to it; when Belle finished abruptly Florrie sniffed with
  relief.</p>

  <p>"What's the name of that?" asked old Mrs. MacKinnon shakily and
  cautiously.</p>

  <p>"'The Wanderer to the Moon'&mdash;it ought to be sung by a man."</p>

  <p>"I don't think it ought to be sung at all," complained May. "Makes you
  think of a hymn."</p>

  <p>"When did you last hear a hymn?" Belle swung round on the stool.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," muttered the sleepy fat woman, taken aback. "Hark!
  there's the door!" cried Mrs. Bulke with a smart vivacity that silenced the
  others. "Daisy at last, and she ain't alone, neither. No," added the
  landlady, pulling the door open and listening up the basement
  stairs&mdash;"She's brought a gentleman home."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Florrie and May, startled out of their drowsy, cosy
reminiscences, echoed
  with drunken gravity: "Daisy's brought a gentleman home!"</p>

  <p>The kitchen door, which Mrs. Bulke had hung ajar, was pushed open and
  Daisy's head, with crooked pink plume, tattered, loosened green bonnet,
  slipping knot of red hair, flushed face, looked in. Her air was one of
  triumph. Belle had never seen her look so young and well.</p>

  <p>"Come in, dearie," said Mrs. Bulke, in a carefully lowered voice, "come in
  and tell us all about it."</p>

  <p>Daisy entered; she had been drinking and was walking unsteadily; in her
  arms was a large bag of apples, oranges and nuts.</p>

  <p>"Here's something for your Christmas, Ma, we came round by Covent
  Garden."</p>

  <p>She tumbled the fruit in front of the two women seated at the table and
  laughed to see the walnuts and chestnuts roll among the soiled glasses and
  cups.</p>

  <p>"You don't know the luck I've had," she leered with her hand on her full
  bosom.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm glad, I'm sure, dearie, if it wasn't time! What about the
  rent?"</p>

  <p>"I'll pay you in the morning."</p>

  <p>"Only my joke&mdash;why not ask the gentleman in&mdash;for a drain&mdash;a
  cold night like this?"</p>

  <p>The words seemed to penetrate Daisy's stupid bemusement; she looked round
  the kitchen and at the occupants, all of whom were staring at her; Belle,
  observing her from the piano-stool, saw a look of cunning come into the large
  eyes inflamed from fog and drink.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;he is a <i>gentleman</i>," said Daisy sharply. "And I don't want
  any more drink&mdash;no, I've got to keep sober."</p>

  <p>"Sober!" grinned Morrie with a hiccough. "And a gentleman! My! We're quite
  the lady, aren't we?"</p>

  <p>"You've never seen a gentleman&mdash;not to speak to," retorted Daisy
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Not <i>here</i>, not at No. 12&mdash;that I ain't&mdash;and as for you,
  my beauty, as for you, you vixen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Florrie had squared her elbows in a threatening attitude; Mrs. Bulke
  intervened.</p>

  <p>"Leave her alone, can't you? What business is it of yourn?" She added a
  few sharp foul words that reduced the other to a whining submission, then
  turned to Daisy. "Well, dearie, if you won't bring him down, you go up to
  him&mdash;you don't want him to think better of it, do you, and slip away out
  into the fog?"</p>

  <p>"He'd wait for <i>me</i>. All night and all day, <i>he'd</i> wait for
  me!"</p>

  <p>She snatched the bonnet from her graceful head and swirled it round on her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"It brought me luck, Belle, didn't it? Your beautiful plume! It was
  <i>that</i> he noticed, the pink plume on my chestnut hair&mdash;it reminded
  him&mdash;never mind of what. You'd hie it back, wouldn't you, dearie?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't want it any more. It's dirty from the fog and uncurled from
  the damp."</p>

  <p>Daisy Arrow tossed her head, sending the shining hair in waves of
  brightness down her back, laughed unsteadily, and swayed to the door,
  muttering: "You don't know my <i>luck</i>."</p>

  <p>Belle rose from the piano-stool.</p>

  <p>"Tommy ought to be in bed&mdash;look at him now&mdash;he's fast
  asleep."</p>

  <p>"The pet," said Mrs. Bulke absently. "Take him along, Molly, do." She
  stood at the door, listening intently.</p>

  <p>A man's step, a man's voice in the passage above and Daisy Arrow laughing
  shrilly.</p>

  <p>"Can't hear what he says," muttered Mrs. Bulke, "but he <i>do</i> sound
  like a gentleman&mdash;well, well&mdash;" she patted her hair; her expression
  was satirical and incredulous. "Come along, Florrie. Come along, May. I'm
  going to put the gas out&mdash;you'll have to be finding your way home, Mrs.
  Mac&mdash;or p'raps Molly will go with you when she's put Tommy to bed."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Bulke and Belle remained alone in the kitchen; the
landlady was
  sorting out what was worth preserving among the eatables and putting them
  into a cupboard, then stacking up the dirty crocks for Molly to take into the
  scullery.</p>

  <p>Belle remained on the piano-stool, her hands clasped on her knees.</p>

  <p>"Ain't you tired, dearie?" asked the yawning landlady pointedly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm tired, but I don't feel as if I could sleep tonight. My room is
  so cold."</p>

  <p>"Them what pays for fires gets them," said Mrs. Bulke pleasantly. "And
  you've a grate what draws fine."</p>

  <p>As Belle didn't reply, the landlady continued, jerking off the soiled
  white cloth:</p>

  <p>"You think about what I was saying about helping Florrie&mdash;that would
  mean a bit of fire whenever you felt like it have this drain of porter?" She
  held up a nearly empty bottle to the gas and peered at the contents.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I've had enough."</p>

  <p>"You're wise. I've always been careful, too. Never let the drink get the
  better of you&mdash;not once&mdash;or you're done. Who is this coming
  down?"</p>

  <p>A light, uncertain step on the stair, a push at the door, and Daisy Arrow
  entered, her bright hair fallen on her shoulders, her bodice open on her
  white bosom. She held her gaping reticule in her hand and took from it half a
  sovereign.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, Ma&mdash;ten shillings off the rent."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, dearie; anything I can do for you?"</p>

  <p>"No." Daisy Arrow stared at Belle, who rose and came to the table. "Sure
  you don't want your feathers back?"</p>

  <p>"I've said I don't. Daisy, who is it you've got upstairs?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"I heard his voice," replied Belle dryly, "and 'I thought it sounded like
  that of a gentleman&mdash;an educated man&mdash;it seemed curious to hear
  such accents in this place&mdash;and it didn't sound quite
  English&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dairy Arrow laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I can't show him to you, Belle, my pet&mdash;he's a
  foreigner&mdash;and shy."</p>

  <p>"A foreigner!" echoed Mrs. Bulke in disgust.</p>

  <p>"Don't you turn up <i>your</i> nose, Ma, you wait till tomorrow&mdash;I'll
  give you a Christmas present&mdash;I'll have a few things to show you, see if
  I don't."</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, Dairy Arrow&mdash;and shut up your bag&mdash;look, you've still
  got that dirty clasp-knife in it." As Belle spoke she snapped the gilt clasps
  of the reticule from which the white china beads dripped off the broken
  threads, and drew Daisy towards the door; again the light, uncertain step on
  the stair, ascending unsteadily now.</p>

  <p>"Well," yawned Mrs. Bulke, "there's an end of her, I hopes&mdash;Mrs.
  Mac's been took home, Tommy's in bed, and Moll's snoozing off&mdash;that'll
  be enough for to-day."</p>

  <p>She stretched up to turn off the gas. Belle had found and lit a candle; as
  the hard brilliance in the glass globe faded out, there was only the glow
  from the embers and the weak flame of the hard candle.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The two women were standing in the flame-shot dark,
pausing, one reluctant
  and alert, one yawning and sleepy, about to leave the kitchen, when again
  there was the swish of flounces, the tap of unsteady heels, and Daisy Arrow
  entered, she also with a candle in a tin stick held in a shaking hand.</p>

  <p>"What now?" asked Mrs. Bulke with an air of authority, peering through the
  crossing light of the flames.</p>

  <p>"I want some champagne," smiled Daisy.</p>

  <p>"Champagne? That's a gentleman's drink, ain't it?"</p>

  <p>"I want it for a <i>gentleman</i>."</p>

  <p>"Well, he won't find it here, as <i>you</i> ought to know, beauty."</p>

  <p>"Brandy then, he said&mdash;champagne or fine old brandy."</p>

  <p>"I've neither. And all what hasn't been drunk of what I <i>have</i> got
  has been put away and will stay put away. You've had enough."</p>

  <p>Daisy Arrow made as if to open the reticule which still dangled on her
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Can't Moll run and fetch some? I've got the money, plenty of money."</p>

  <p>"What time do you think it is? The public-houses and the wine shops is all
  shut up. It's past midnight."</p>

  <p>"It's Christmas Day," said Belle, smiling above her smoking candle. "Peace
  on earth, goodwill towards men."</p>

  <p>Daisy Arrow stared at her, seemed to shudder, to wince a little, frowned,
  then tossed her head and once more left the kitchen, holding her candle
  aslant so that the wax dripped on her skirt.</p>

  <p>"Well," remarked Mrs. Bulke with her air of resigned indignation.
  "<i>He's</i> a foreigner all right&mdash;champagne and fine old brandy for
  Daisy Arrow! Who does he think she is?" Suddenly laughing in her throat the
  landlady limped out on to the stairs. "He doesn't know his way about, that's
  what it is, dearie; he thinks we're Claridge's, here at No. 12, that's what
  he thinks." Laboriously mounting the low worn stairs, she added, "Or less
  he's blind drunk."</p>

  <p>"I heard his voice," said Belle following slowly, shivering in the
  draughts that were so keen outside the stale warmth oft the kitchen. "And
  he's sober enough, quite sober."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle tried to cheat the cold, the half-dark, her own
dreadful thoughts,
  by persistently conning over the things for which she lusted; a warm,
  luxurious room, a soft bed with down pillows and silken coverlets, a shaded
  lamp, fine, fashionable clothes, delicate foods, rare wines, attentive
  servants, a lover devoted and reverent&mdash;music, a box at the Opera, a
  carriage and pair...all these things were in the world and she had none of
  them and no chance of ever being able to obtain them&mdash;no chance. Yet
  they were enjoyed and despised by thousands of women no wiser than
  herself&mdash;no cleverer, no prettier, no more unscrupulous.</p>

  <p>A low hum of talk in the next room to hers distracted her. Daisy Arrow and
  the foreigner, of course. Belle frowned with ugly distaste.</p>

  <p>She had a front room that looked, from the top of the three-storeyed
  house, on to the straight, prim street. Daisy had the corresponding room at
  the back, which looked on to the gritty, sooty garden, the backs of dark
  houses and ash-bins. The other side of the small landing at the stair-head
  were the empty rooms reserved by Mrs. Bulke for occasional use, or for
  transient lodgers.</p>

  <p>Belle, moving about to keep herself warm, detected the man's tones, and
  sorted them from those of the woman&mdash;a warm, pleasant, manly
  voice&mdash;she could not distinguish what he was saying, not even in what
  language he spoke&mdash;but English, of course, what other tongue did Daisy
  Arrow understand?</p>

  <p>"My God! What have they to talk about? How could he, who speaks so well,
  have even looked at Daisy with her cough, her broken teeth, her gawdy rags
  and her vulgar air?"</p>

  <p>She felt vicariously disgraced by the thought of this man of her own class
  in the next room with Daisy Arrow, as if he had been a brother&mdash;at least
  a relative, and angrily she tried to reason herself out of this folly.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow is Christmas Day&mdash;I'll pile all my clothes on the bed and
  try to sleep until it is time for me to go to the Cambridge on Boxing Night.
  Moll will bring me up a cup of tea. Yes, I'll try to sleep."</p>

  <p>She wondered where she could get opium&mdash;wasn't that a short cut to
  the inevitable end? Totty Belville had got some opium, but Belle did not know
  where, and Totty had long since disappeared. The East End, no doubt&mdash;but
  Belle was afraid of the East End with the sailors and Chinamen, she was still
  an alien to the underworld, still shuddered on the edge of those filthy
  morasses that soon she must sink into&mdash;unless she had the
  courage&mdash;"Curse Daisy for taking that knife away, I believe I could have
  done it now."</p>

  <p>She began to undress, but the room was so cold that she huddled on her
  clothes again. She intended to wash her face and hands, but Moll had not
  emptied the soiled soapy water in the hand-basin, nor put fresh water in the
  lipless ewer. The short candle was fast burning out, there was only just
  sufficient uncertain light to see the gaunt shape of the iron bed with the
  bleak white cotton coverlet and thin blanket, the worn piece of drugget on
  the floor, the rain stains and marks on the ceiling, the broken window pane
  patched with brown paper, the chairs with the rushes of the seats sprouting
  from the frames beneath, the tilting chest of drawers with the top used as a
  dressing-table.</p>

  <p>Throwing her shawl and a rubbed fur jacket on the bed, Belle blew out the
  candle and still in her clothes got between the ragged sheets, and forced
  herself, with the obstinacy of despair, to sleep. "Wanderer to the
  Moon&mdash;Wanderer to the Moon."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">She woke, uneasy, unable to achieve, even in her dreams,
her journey to
  the skies, hardly able to dream at all. The drone of voices next door struck
  disagreeably on her waking ear. The man's low notes and Daisy Arrow's shrill
  tones filled Belle with uncontrollable exasperation. She struggled from the
  bed into the bleak cold, crossed to the inner wall and knocked sharply. There
  was an instant silence as complete as if her knock had been a spell to turn
  the speakers into stone.</p>

  <p>Belle scrambled into bed and drew the clothes to her chin. She was
  conscious of an utter stillness in the house, and on that stillness her
  senses, half drugged by fatigue, drifted into oblivion.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When Belle woke, a blur of bitter daylight was in the room;
she had
  forgotten to pull down the blinds, and her windows, on which the frost had
  made patterns, looked east. She thought she could hear church bells. What
  time was it? Six, seven? At what time did it get light on December 25th?</p>

  <p>She was wide awake and strove to keep herself so, despite her yesterday's
  resolution of remaining in bed; she had had an unpleasant dream which she
  wished to shake off. What had it been? She could not remember the
  circumstances, only the horror. Something about the knife which Daisy Arrow
  had put into her reticule. Well, that wasn't strange after all, seeing what
  she had intended to do with that knife yesterday, what she might have done
  had she been a little braver and if Minnie Palmer had not come in, nosing for
  "Cream of the Valley."</p>

  <p>She walked about the room, instinctively setting her dress to rights; she
  looked into the blotched scrap of mirror and was shocked to see her face
  grimed with fog, swollen from unhealthy sleep, stained by burnt cork and
  rouge, with the greasy hair plastered flat round her eyes and ears. To wash
  herself became a necessity. She picked up the empty ewer, intending to go
  down to the basement for water; the light was still uncertain, it must be
  very early&mdash;Sunday and Christmas morning, no one would be stirring for
  hours yet.</p>

  <p>As she turned to the door she heard footsteps in Daisy Arrow's room and
  paused with a sudden, angry, hurt recollection of that cultured masculine
  voice. She heard the other door open and shut, heard a man's step descending,
  and with a sudden hot curiosity pulled open her own door and stared down the
  twilit stairs. He had reached the little landing at the end of the first
  flight. Hearing her movements he looked round and, coming to a stand, stared
  up at her. He was a stranger to Belle and not in the least like the man whom
  she had expected to see; he could scarcely have been surprised at her
  appearance, for she was just such a figure as he in such a house might have
  been prepared to meet. Yet, they stared at one another as if in full and
  dreadful recognition, as if each said to the other: "You&mdash;here?"</p>

  <p>He was neatly, handsomely dressed, wore a full light-grey coat buttoned at
  the waist, and held a high hat. A pale silk neck-cloth was folded under his
  chin and his brown hair was carefully brushed.</p>

  <p>Belle tried to speak, but could not form a sentence; the stranger, still
  staring as if in extreme surprise, made an odd gesture with his free hand, as
  if he drew a cross in the air between them, but so quickly was the movement
  made and so detached was it from the expression of his face that she almost
  doubted if he had made it at all, but if it were not, rather, some extension
  of her own fancy.</p>

  <p>Then he was gone, so rapidly that again she doubted if she had seen him at
  all. She heard the front door slam violently as she stood leaning against the
  dirty wallpaper of the landing.</p>

  <p>Once she had been fond of sketching, of making little notes in pencil of
  things that had impressed or pleased her; she had for some time forgotten
  this small talent, now it occurred to her and she began committing to memory
  the features of that upturned face as if she would, when possible, draw the
  stranger's portrait.</p>

  <p>She hesitated on the landing, in the murky light, disturbed by an uneasy
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Daisy has some fresh water&mdash;why shouldn't I ask her now
  she's alone?"</p>

  <p>In front of the other woman's door, with her hand raised to knock, she
  hesitated again.</p>

  <p>"Why do I want to go in? It will make me sick. Yet I can't
  resist&mdash;and surely I can induce Daisy to tell me something; besides, I
  do want the water, without going downstairs."</p>

  <p>She knocked, and, as there was no answer, entered; the room was hideously
  like her own, the same kind of cheap furniture, the same worn carpet, the
  same odds and ends of soiled feminine litter; the holland blind was down, the
  dingy chenille curtains half-drawn so that the place was full of shadows.
  Daisy Arrow lay on the far side of the bed with the clothes pulled up all
  round her so that her face was invisible and only a coil of her red hair
  showed on the pillow.</p>

  <p>"Well, as she's asleep I'll leave it&mdash;why should I want to talk about
  him?&mdash;how dark her hair is and I never knew that she had so much of
  it."</p>

  <p>Belle turned to the wooden wash-hand-stand which was a duplicate of her
  own; her foot struck an object on the floor&mdash;a book&mdash;a small, thick
  book. Daisy Arrow never read anything but the <i>Police News</i>. Belle set
  down her ewer, picked up the volume&mdash;a German Bible. She glanced towards
  the bed, but Daisy Arrow had not moved. "She must be very sound asleep, I
  can't even hear her breathing."</p>

  <p>Placing the Bible on a chair, Belle looked in the other ewer&mdash;empty,
  and a glass drinking-bottle empty, too. All the water had been poured into
  the basin, this was full to the brim&mdash;evidently Daisy had been washing
  off her heavy rouge, for the water was stained a brownish red. A towel with a
  strip torn off was folded across the stand. Belle noticed, with a spasm of
  rage, her pink plumes on the floor; she picked them up, some of the stain
  that polluted the water, wet rouge, whatever it was, disfigured the
  iris-coloured breast of the bird-head on the mount, as if the sharp beak had
  pierced the smooth feathers, drawing&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Blood," said Belle aloud, then she put her hand to her mouth and stood
  still.</p>

  <p>Well, a little accident, a cut finger, washed here and dried here. Yes,
  there are marks on the other towel, too, something had dripped on the
  feathers which were thrown on to the floor.</p>

  <p>She steadied herself and approached the bed.</p>

  <p>"Daisy Arrow&mdash;Daisy. It is Christmas morning, time to get up."</p>

  <p>To herself she muttered: "Why do I say that? Why am I afraid to turn the
  clothes down?"</p>

  <p>"Daisy, I came to fetch the pink feathers and the knife&mdash;you had no
  right to take the knife, Daisy Arrow."</p>

  <p>She retreated from the bed and saw it the knife, as if it had been
  conjured into existence by her thought. It lay on a chair unclasped, and the
  blade was much stained, even more stained than it had been from the vinegar
  of Belle's midday meal.</p>

  <p>Light and swift, Belle returned to the bed; that was not all hair on the
  pillow&mdash;the red locks lay on a deep stain the same colour as themselves.
  With rigidly extended finger and thumb, Belle pulled back the sheet an inch
  or so&mdash;far enough to see Daisy Arrow's eyes, set dull and staring.
  Another inch or so, enough to see Daisy Arrow's livid cheeks on which was the
  imprint of a hand in red. Another inch or so, enough to see Daisy Arrow's
  throat bound tightly by a strip of towel.</p>

  <p>Belle admired her own fortitude; she relished her own control, she was
  excited by this sense of utter horror and of struggling with and overcoming
  it as she had struggled and overcome the terror of her forgotten dream.</p>

  <p>She put back the bedclothes, she picked up the Bible, the ewer, the
  feather, and returned to her own room. When she had put these articles on her
  wash-stand, she found that she could not move; her limbs seemed paralysed,
  and a deep nausea weakened her; but there was something else to be done; the
  sense of her own courage upheld her.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes she sends up that poor little brat to rouse people."</p>

  <p>She forced herself to move, she kept down her retching, she returned to
  Daisy Arrow's room. The key was on the inside, she moved it to the outside,
  locked the door and brought the key into her own room.</p>

  <p>After this most painful effort, she again felt her strength leave her and
  crouched on her tumbled bed, holding her throat while nervous convulsions
  shook her body.</p>

  <p>She knew that she could not long remain inactive&mdash;there were things
  to be done, unless she wanted trouble.</p>

  <p>First, the key. She found a knot hole in the boards of the floor, slipped
  the key in, pulled the drugget over the place. The pink feathers she flung,
  without looking at them, into one of her drawers. The Bible she looked
  through eagerly. A name inside, several names, inscriptions&mdash;no time now
  to understand or consider these no time to think or to plan. She wrapped the
  book in a handkerchief and put it in the carpet-bag, which was her sole
  article of luggage.</p>

  <p>She felt ill, but no longer dulled by despair; as she took off her
  clothes, this time not noticing the cold, put on a nightgown and got into
  bed, she knew, through an ecstasy of horror, that the murder of Daisy Arrow
  had given her something for which to live. She put her hand firmly under her
  face to prevent her teeth from chattering.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Daisy Arrow had been taken to St. Pancras mortuary. Belle,
from behind the
  dirty muslin curtain on the slack string, watched her go in the twilight of
  the Christmas afternoon. It was a journey that she had thought to have taken
  herself, and about at this time.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, when she had sat over the food she could not eat, in the dingy
  dressing-room under the stage of the Cambridge, she had considered just such
  a scene&mdash;the parish undertaker's men, the poor hearse, the knot of
  curious gazers, ragged boys, lounging men, slatternly women, the swathes of
  yellow fog, darkening in the winter sky of the brief daylight&mdash;all a
  rough, fairly clean-made pattern. But she had pictured herself, Belle, inside
  the hearse, with that same necklet about her throat, with that same unmeaning
  stare in her eyes, with that same locking of secrets behind a rigid
  mouth.</p>

  <p>Yes, but there was one particular in the tragedy that was
  changed&mdash;not only were the women different, not only was it Daisy Arrow
  instead of Belle Adair, but the manner of the creature's death was
  <i>murder</i>, not as Belle had thought it would be&mdash;<i>suicide</i>.</p>

  <p>When she had handled the clasp-knife which had been brought to her to cut
  some dry bread, she had wondered if its blade would be spoiled by the vinegar
  stain. That would make a task, already to be dreaded, even more difficult.
  She considered how the same knife would look afterwards, when there were
  other stains upon it. But she had never considered this&mdash;that it might
  find a victim in Daisy Arrow, instead of in herself, and that a man's, not a
  woman's hand might guide it skilfully, swiftly, with that firmness and
  decision which she had prayed for, but not been able to achieve, on the task
  of sending misery to corrupt in the London clay.</p>

  <p>Belle was upheld and even stimulated by the tragedy and by her part in it.
  Here was what she had longed for and needed&mdash;action, suspense,
  excitement. She had purposely put off an examination of the little German
  Bible, not only because she was afraid to take this out of the carpet bag
  while the police were in the house, but because she liked to postpone a
  pleasure and tantalise herself with the thought of an entrancing interest in
  the near future.</p>

  <p>When she had, by sheer force of mind, overcome her physical sickness, she
  was cool and calm, for her emotions had not been touched. She had always
  disliked Daisy Arrow as being, in a way, a caricature of herself, of her sex,
  her age, her chances and her downfall, even, in a part, of her arts and
  graces. The murdered woman had also possessed a shapely figure, straight
  features, smooth hands, a genteel manner, and a certain air of irony and
  intelligence which set her apart from creatures like Minnie Palmer, Mrs.
  Bulke, or any other of the girls and women among whom Belle Adair, for
  several months now, had moved.</p>

  <p>Well, there went the last of Daisy Arrow.</p>

  <p>Belle opened the window cautiously and peered out into the fog, watching
  the hearse proceeding with indecorous haste into the yellow mist. The crowd
  in the street was too occupied with the drama of Daisy Arrow to notice the
  cool curiosity of the woman, who, with her elbows on the sooty sill, was
  watching the long black box of a carriage and the rusty black limbs of the
  horse disappear into the obscurity of darkness and mist.</p>

  <p>The loiterers did not immediately disperse, but lingered by the broken
  area railing, expressing among themselves regret and sympathy for the sordid
  event of the night before.</p>

  <p>Belle Adair withdrew silently from her window, but continued to peer into
  the street from above the broken pane that was patched with brown paper. The
  crowd, mostly bleared, bloated or drunken-eyed, began to stare with bleak
  curiosity at the drab front of the house which had been for so long elegant
  and respectable, and for even longer, miserable and degraded. Pressing to the
  railings, they peered down at the basement window where the wreath of paper
  roses, put up in celebration of Christmas, still hung behind the fly-blown
  pane, and where a child's wooden horse, dabbed with splashes of black paint,
  could be seen flung on top of a workbasket full of discoloured cottons and
  cards of faded wool.</p>

  <p>Christmas Day, thought Belle, and things going on just the same. People at
  the mortuary ready to bring round the hearse, doctors and policemen on duty,
  and all that crowd of idlers in the Street, with nothing better to do than
  just stare at the house where a stupid woman, for whom nobody cared, was
  murdered last night.</p>

  <p>She moved about the room with her quick, light step. She was thinking
  deeply. A fire, the first she had had that winter, burned in the grate with a
  pure green-gold flame.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the distraction of the other lodgers and the overthrow
  of Mrs. Bulke, she had been down to the coal-cellar herself, and, unobserved
  by anyone, brought up coal and wood and newspaper, and lit the cheerful fire.
  Still unobserved by anyone, she had fetched fresh water and a good piece of
  coarse soap from the kitchen, washed her hands and face, and then cooked
  herself a breakfast from the bacon and eggs, carefully stored at the back of
  the cupboard, that Mrs. Bulke reserved for her own consumption. Then warmed,
  fed and bathed, and acting, as it seemed to herself, under the stimulus of a
  considerable pleasure and excitement, Belle Adair tidied her room and
  rearranged her dress, stitching up the torn, fallen flounces of her skirt,
  refastening the burst buttons of the bodice, and taking away needless frills
  of dirty lace at wrists and neck. She had then brushed and combed her
  curiously-coloured hair into a plain knot at the nape of her neck. She knew,
  when this leisurely toilet was finished, that she looked quite different from
  any of the other women in that house&mdash;quite different indeed from any
  other woman in that street. Without a trace of make-up or a scrap of finery,
  not as much as a string of glass beads or a silver brooch, and her face quite
  colourless and composed, she appeared a gentlewoman, shabby and forlorn
  indeed, but dignified and cultured, one who was enduring with patient
  fortitude an ill-deserved poverty.</p>

  <p>The early hours of the day had been very ugly indeed, but she had
  weathered them as a stout mariner might weather a black storm which, at
  times, had threatened to engulf him utterly in darkness. Fighting against her
  strong impulse to scream or faint, or rouse the house, she had held herself
  mute in bed, clasping her chin to stop the rattling of her teeth, counting
  the faded leaves in the greenish-coloured wallpaper, reciting to herself
  moral poems learned at school, listening to the church bells outside, and
  then, to a street singer brawling a carol, watching the murky, yellowish
  light of the London day brighten and then fade again as the fog came up with
  the rising of the sun. All this skilful employment of her faculties was to
  prevent her from thinking of what lay in the next room&mdash;from
  anticipating the moment when what lay in the next room must be discovered,
  and she herself involved in a tumult of horror which claimed an
  explanation.</p>

  <p>As the hours had worn on, and the house was yet still, her mind, refusing
  to be diverted by the ingenuous employment she had given it, fell to
  considering the practical issue of the case. The police would be called in.
  She would be asked questions. More than that she did not know. As yet she had
  escaped the activities of Scotland Yard. She tried to recall cases that might
  have been related to her or that she might have glanced at in the paper.</p>

  <p>What exactly happened?</p>

  <p>On a sudden fear that her room might be searched, she rose from bed, and,
  putting her shawl over her nightgown, removed the mount of vivid pink plumes
  from the drawer and put them in the carpet bag with the small German Bible.
  The stain on the breast of the humming bird was now dry. It was quite a
  little stain after all, and no one, unless they examined it very carefully,
  would even suspect what it was. Besides, she might have a tale for
  that&mdash;a scratched finger. She checked herself. "I mustn't be too
  cunning, too ingenuous. I had better not tell any more lies than I need." She
  looked anxiously at her ewer. Was it in the least marked? It might have been.
  She had set it down by that other ewer, by the wash-hand-stand on which was a
  basin of polluted water. But, no, there were no marks on the crock, beyond
  smudges of soot and outlines of dirty water. The floor, the clothes she had
  worn&mdash;any mark or stain whatever? It had been a half-light, and she
  hardly conscious of her actions; and yet that was not true either. She had
  been most careful. From the first second that she had suspected, she had
  taken the sheet between her finger and thumb and drawn it down as delicately
  as if she had been uncovering the tender limbs of a sleeping baby. There had
  been nothing, either on her clothes or on the floor. Of that fact she had
  made herself quite certain. She was comfortable in her mind, too, about the
  plume of feathers. She had a simple story ready to account for that if Mrs.
  Bulke, or one of the other women, should question how it came to be in her
  possession when Daisy Arrow had been seen late last night twirling it in her
  unsteady hand. She had repeated this story over and over to herself. She
  would always find it useful, and, resolving to tell a lie, she must first
  persuade herself that it was true.</p>

  <p>"I went upstairs and Daisy was still awake and restless. She bounced out
  on the landing and thrust the feathers into my hand, and I, not wishing to
  have any more conversation with her, took them to stop further argument, went
  into my room and shut the door."</p>

  <p>That was most likely and nobody would be able to contradict such a
  tale.</p>

  <p>The key. She pulled aside the drugget and went down on her knees beside
  the gaping hole where a knot had fallen out of the worn boards. Nothing to be
  seen. She prodded down with a pin that fastened her bodice and could feel
  with the end of the steel the solid substance of the key lying on a thick bed
  of dust. Nobody would think of looking there, surely. Yet she felt a little
  uneasy. Still, what else could she do with it?</p>

  <p>She was a little sorry about her impulsive action. It would have been
  better to have kept it. She could have taken it downstairs when she had
  cooked her breakfast and fetched her water, and thrown it into the area. That
  would have been a very likely place for a murderer to have cast a key.</p>

  <p>She was glad, however, she had locked the door, because it had happened as
  she had supposed it might, for, as she had lain in the bed with her knees
  drawn up and her hands still clasped under her chin, her teeth still slightly
  chattering as if the convulsions which had seized her were only just passing
  away, she had heard a child's footsteps outside, and a child's feeble knock
  on Daisy Arrow's door, and a child's voice shrilling away in weary, careless
  tones that "it was nearly twelve o'clock, and Mother said Daisy had better
  come down if she wanted a bit of breakfast."</p>

  <p>Belle had not been able to resist sitting up in bed and listening alertly
  for the silence which she knew must follow any summons on Daisy Arrow's
  door.</p>

  <p>The child had knocked, and knocked again. Belle had heard a repeated
  shouting, and then there was a pause. Perhaps he was spying through the
  keyhole. She had not thought of that. But even if he did, what would he see
  to alarm him?</p>

  <p>She thought of springing from bed, pulling open her own door, yawning on
  the landing, and saying, "Why, Tommy, what's the matter? Can't you leave poor
  Daisy alone? She's tired. It is Christmas Day; besides, is it so late?"</p>

  <p>Though this action and these words had flowed so smoothly in her mind, she
  had not brought herself to put them into practice. She had remained there
  sitting on the edge of her bed listening until the child ceased chattering
  and ran away.</p>

  <p>There had been another long pause in the sluggish household&mdash;at least
  an hour, she supposed. She thought of the murderer. He had had a good start
  over any possible pursuers.</p>

  <p>Then had come a heavier step on the stairs, and with it the panting
  breaths of a stout woman, a hoarse voice calling on Daisy Arrow and asking
  why she did not get up?&mdash;why she had locked herself in?&mdash;and why
  she did not answer? at first lazily and indifferently, and then, to the
  relief of the tension of the young woman who listened so keenly in the front
  room, a sudden panic&mdash;shouting, screaming.</p>

  <p>"I can't pretend not to have heard that," thought Belle.</p>

  <p>She leapt from the bed, snatched up her shawl, opened her door, and out on
  the landing, said&mdash;almost she felt without her own volition&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Florrie? It's Christmas Day, and is it so late? Why
  shouldn't Daisy Arrow sleep if she wants to?"</p>

  <p>Florrie had taken no heed of her, but, leaning over the stair rails, had
  continued to shout up the house.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bulke, and May, and the pale servant, and Tommy, and a young girl who
  had only been in the house two days and whose name no one seemed to know, all
  came quickly, readily, keen for any excitement or unusual event. There had
  been more knockings and shouting and twisting of the handle, and Belle,
  hastily putting on her clothes, as if she too were disturbed and astonished,
  had the curious thought: "Supposing Daisy Arrow were to get off her bed and
  come to open to them with that red hand-print on her face and those two
  gashes in her throat showing through the bandage?"</p>

  <p>It was Mrs. Bulke who had taken charge of the situation.</p>

  <p>"I've never known Daisy Arrow lock her door before, and I've never known
  her lie abed so long," she said, and in sharp words she sent Moll, who had
  begun to whimper and shiver, to fetch the policeman who would be on beat duty
  at the corner of the square.</p>

  <p>Florrie had been violently against this proceeding and had argued
  vehemently that&mdash;"it was a folly, and a wicked folly, to let the police
  meddle in your affairs. No. 12 wasn't the sort of place to have the law
  interfering and constables nosing round, and that no matter what had happened
  to palsy Arrow they'd best keep it to themselves."</p>

  <p>At these words and the bitter and sinister tone in which they were spoken,
  the nameless girl began to sob and hide her face in her skirt and wish she
  "were out of it." Even Mrs. Bulke hesitated and wondered if she could force
  the door herself with a heave of her own stout shoulder.</p>

  <p>But Moll, without waiting for counter-orders, had fled down the rickety
  stairs, a loose shoe flapping on her foot encased in a wrinkled and torn
  stocking.</p>

  <p>It was at this point that Belle had slipped downstairs and cooked her
  breakfast, fetched her water, and touched up her attire, nobody taking any
  heed of her at all.</p>

  <p>When she had seen the policemen&mdash;two fresh-faced fellows who looked,
  she thought, like countrymen&mdash;enter the house, dwarfing it with their
  massive figures and oilskin capes, she had drawn little Tommy into her own
  room and shut the door on what was happening outside.</p>

  <p>There had been quite a crowd in No. 12 by then. Several people&mdash;women
  cleaning doorsteps, others bustling round the little general shop which was
  open for a few hours on Christmas morning&mdash;seeing Moll flying for the
  policemen, seeing Moll returning with the policemen, had followed up and
  tried to slip somehow into the house.</p>

  <p>Mrs. MacKinnon was there and the woman from the rag-and-bone shop, and the
  old bird-fancier, the piebaker from whom Mrs. Bulke, when in a generous and
  lazy mood, had so often ordered a late and tasty ready-cooked meal.</p>

  <p>"Tommy," Belle Adair said, "none of what is happening outside has anything
  to do with us. See, I have a pack of cards here. Let us have a game. The
  table is not large enough and is lumbered besides; but I have made the bed
  and drawn the cover smooth and we can play on that."</p>

  <p>The boy, who was always eager for a grown-up person to give him attention,
  had sat down obediently on the chair with the rushes of the seat sprouting
  beneath the frame where the bands were broken, and began to play
  "beggar-my-neighbour."</p>

  <p>Belle kept her eyes on the cards&mdash;"the butcher, the baker, the
  candlestick-maker"&mdash;a set of old nursery snap cards she had had a long
  while. Why had she kept them? Perhaps because they were so worthless. It was
  a long while since she had looked at them. They had lain in the bottom drawer
  from which she had just taken them, together with a worn goatskin
  dice-shaker.</p>

  <p>The first game over, they played another, and Tommy was quite content.</p>

  <p>Disturbances, sudden emergencies, calls and alarms were not so unusual at
  No. 12 that he was much interested in them. He had even seen policeman there
  before, questioning people like they were being questioned now&mdash;Mother
  answering them&mdash;sharp but shrewd-like as she was.</p>

  <p>Belle had listened while she played her game of snap.</p>

  <p>The door had soon broken down. Then there had been heavy tramping feet in
  the next room, and voices, and, what she had carefully schooled herself to
  hear, dismal shrieks.</p>

  <p>Moll had broken in on the peaceful game of cards, with her face quite
  greenish and distorted, had flopped on her knees by the bed, had begun to
  retch and sob together.</p>

  <p>Belle had then taken command of the situation; she found a certain
  pleasure in doing so. She had checked the girl's incoherent lamentation. She
  had taken Tommy in one hand and Moll in the other, and led them, unresisting,
  out of the clamour in the house, and round the corner through the increasing
  throng, to the shop of the little chandler, who was just putting up his
  shutters.</p>

  <p>"Moll," she had said, "don't go back to No. 12. Stay here with Tommy."</p>

  <p>She had taken a shilling from her pocket. She remembered that the last
  coin she had handled had been that other shilling which she had given to the
  woman in the faded satin, who had been crouching in the pawn-broker's doorway
  in front of the transparency of red and blue.</p>

  <p>The little servant, gaping at her new air of authority, the child
  wondering but submissive, had given in to her. She had given, in a whisper, a
  few words of explanation to the ready ear of the chandler's kindly wife.
  "Something horrible had happened at No. 12 there had been an accident&mdash;a
  bad accident. It seemed a shame to have the child and the little maid in the
  way&mdash;she would tell the police where they were. Meanwhile, perhaps Mrs.
  Ellet would keep these two and give them a little dinner?" She had handed the
  boy a packet of sweets from the counter, then she had gone back to the house
  through the fog, made her way, detached, reserved, through the crowd on the
  stairs, and so into her own room, where she had waited with an odd fiery
  patience.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now it was all over. Daisy Arrow had been taken to the
mortuary, the
  doctor had come and gone; the back room where Belle had heard that man's
  pleasant voice which had been silenced by her exasperated knocking, had been
  sealed up and put in charge of the police.</p>

  <p>That, as Belle had foreknown, was a mere formula, because the whole
  apartment had already been carefully searched and had revealed nothing
  extraordinary, except the large stained clasp-knife with which the crime had
  been committed&mdash;the overbrimming basin in which the murderer had washed
  his hands, and the torn towel on which he had wiped them. For the rest,
  nothing but trivial commonplace things&mdash;some of Daisy Arrow's finery on
  a hook&mdash;some of Daisy Arrow's finery in the drawer&mdash;cheap
  furniture, already well-worn and marked before ever Daisy Arrow had taken up
  her residence in the room&mdash;several flat, empty glass flasks&mdash;pots
  of caking cold cream and drying rouge. On the washstand, a half-peeled
  orange; on the chairs and the bed, one or two cracked nutshells, an empty
  stained glass, an empty brandy flask on the chest of drawers.</p>

  <p>Belle had found an intellectual interest in watching the police methods.
  She had had to go down into the kitchen with the other women.</p>

  <p>The first questioning was brief; there was so little that anyone could
  say, so very little that anyone knew.</p>

  <p>The last actions of Daisy Arrow's life had been so ordinary. She had
  visited the Cambridge and had borrowed the pink plumes; she had attempted to
  persuade Belle to accompany her to the Argyll Rooms or the Alhambra. Nothing
  odd in this or in her return to No. 12 late at night, slightly drunk; with a
  bag of fruit, her paying of ten shillings off her rent, her tale of the
  gentleman whom she had met and whom she had brought home with her; there was
  nothing in this the least peculiar or suspicious. No one&mdash;and this was
  very vexatious to the police&mdash;had seen the stranger. They had heard his
  step, his voice, but that was all.</p>

  <p>Daisy Arrow had said he was a foreigner. There Was nothing even peculiar
  about that. Several foreigners had been at No 12 before. Mrs. Bulke had even
  had a foreign lodger&mdash;a French gentleman she thought he was&mdash;for a
  considerable time.</p>

  <p>Even the sharp and practised questioning of Superintendent Matchwell of
  Division E, who, by the afternoon, had been sent round to take charge of the
  enquiry, could not elicit from any of the inhabitants of No. 12&mdash;even
  including poor Moll, who had been brought round from her refuge at the
  chandler's shop&mdash;anything that might throw the least light on the end of
  Daisy Arrow.</p>

  <p>The only two out-of-the-way circumstances that the long cross-examination
  of these women produced, were these: the fact of Daisy Arrow's air of
  excitement and triumph, for she was usually, it seemed&mdash;even when she
  had been drinking&mdash;melancholy and reserved, rather dull in her manner,
  and the fact that she had come down for the third time into the kitchen,
  asking for two most unusual forms of refreshment&mdash;champagne and fine old
  brandy. "Which had never been asked for in this house before, I suppose,
  ma'am," remarked Superintendent Matchwell.</p>

  <p>He was a refined-looking man with a shrewd pock-marked face and sandy
  whiskers. Though he conducted the enquiry quietly and gave the least possible
  trouble and offence, Mrs. Bulke disliked him intensely. She had always
  detested the new detective police. She had known her way about with the old
  Bow Street constables, but this new force was composed of a different class
  of man, from whom the landlady of No. 12 had a distinct aversion.</p>

  <p>"And why, ma'am," asked Superintendent Matchwell, with his trained glance
  keenly and unobtrusively on the florid face of the landlady, "should the
  young woman have asked for champagne and brandy?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know? I told her it was a gentleman's drink, but she said
  she wanted it for a gentleman, and I think he was, too, from what I could
  hear of his voice."</p>

  <p>The detective made a note of that&mdash;a foreigner and a gentleman.</p>

  <p>"That would be," he suggested, tentatively, tapping his feet and his
  pencil, "that would be a bit unusual here, wouldn't it, ma'am&mdash;a
  gentleman?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bulke, with the air of one who disdained subterfuge, admitted "that
  it would be unusual."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle's fire was sinking out; she wanted more coal; it
would soon be dark
  and she had neither lamp nor candle. It was all very well in the daytime,
  with the bright flames in the narrow grate, the house full of people, and
  something to do to occupy oneself. But, at night, surely no one would expect
  her to spend the night on that empty floor with Daisy Arrow's unoccupied room
  the other side of her thin wall. She would have to take another room
  downstairs, though it was odious to think of sleeping with one of those
  women. They might even let her leave the house if she had had anywhere to go.
  She seemed to have soon satisfied the police, although she was the person who
  had been nearest to the scene of the murder, that the criminal at his work,
  or the victim waking for the last time, might have heard her as she
  restlessly tossed on her creaking iron bed.</p>

  <p>Her evidence had been soon given. She had been a witness to Daisy Arrow's
  three visits to the kitchen; she had seen her on the top of the stairs when
  she, herself, had gone to bed; she had returned to her the feather that she
  had borrowed to wear at the Argyll Rooms. She had herself been tired, for not
  only had she played in the evening performance at the Cambridge, but she had
  been rehearsing all day, trial dances and scenes in the hope of obtaining
  some work in the pantomime "Puss in Boots," opening to-morrow, and in which,
  at the last minute, changes had been made. Therefore, she had gone to bed and
  was asleep at once; her candle confirmed that; it had not been above three
  inches when Mrs. Bulke had given it to her, and not one inch was burnt
  down.</p>

  <p>And so, she had slept heavily; just waking once or twice&mdash;hearing the
  bells of Christmas morning&mdash;seeing the foggy London light in the
  room&mdash;and in her idleness and fatigue, going to sleep again till,
  finally, she had been roused by Florrie's unrestrained shrieks on the
  staircase.</p>

  <p>The police did not seem in the least to doubt her story and questioned her
  hardly at all. A search of her room had proved fruitless and what she had
  said sounded so reasonable.</p>

  <p>She was asked if she had heard the front door slam about half-past
  six?</p>

  <p>The pale girl&mdash;who so far had been nameless, but who now, it seemed,
  was called Lily Mason&mdash;had said with many convulsive sobs and tears that
  she had been roused about half-past six&mdash;she thought it was&mdash;by the
  front door slamming; and Mrs. Bulke, also, admitted to hearing this noise,
  but had agreed that it was not an infrequent occurrence at No. 12&mdash;the
  front door closing noisily in the middle of the night or the early hours of
  the morning. Therefore, she had taken no notice.</p>

  <p>Belle said quietly, No, she had not heard that, and she too had admitted
  that doors often slammed either in that house or up the street, and that she
  also, living in Great Hogarth Street, had become accustomed to such
  disturbances.</p>

  <p>So far&mdash;so safe.</p>

  <p>There had only remained the question of the knife, and she felt that she
  had better face that. She was sure that they would be able to trace it, so
  she had told, as casually as she was able, of Daisy Arrow's visit to the
  Cambridge (which could, of course, have been ascertained from other sources),
  of her interview with her in the dressing-room under the stage, and of her
  taking up the clasp-knife which old Bobs, the stage hand, had brought in for
  her to use with her food (the cook-shop having forgotten to send a knife
  over) and of Daisy Arrow putting it in her reticule, under the excuse that
  she was going to have supper in her room and wanted a knife with which to cut
  sandwiches and fruit.</p>

  <p>Belle thought, even as she told it, that this story sounded weak and
  unlikely. She wished she had thought of the point before, then she might have
  been able to invent something more convincing. It was difficult to think of a
  good excuse for Daisy Arrow taking that ugly stained knife away from the
  Cambridge in her silly beaded bag.</p>

  <p>Belle had thought rapidly: "If I tell them the truth, first, they won't
  believe me, and if they did, they would consider that a woman who was in the
  condition to be seriously contemplating suicide-and such an ugly form of
  suicide&mdash;was an object of suspicion. It would be very foolish of me to
  admit that I associated that knife with a woman's throat being cut. They
  might think that Daisy and I had quarrelled."</p>

  <p>But no such suspicion seemed to enter Superintendent Matchwell's mind. He
  accepted Belle Adair's story&mdash;corroborated the details of it from Mr.
  Figg of the Cambridge Theatre&mdash;from Minnie Palmer&mdash;from the other
  women of No. 12&mdash;and he even obtained, to Bell's surprise, evidence in
  support of her invented tale of the knife-borrowing, for he elicited from
  Mrs. Bulke that she did not like her ladies to bring in food and eat in their
  bedrooms and that she had frequently refused Daisy Arrow knives, forks and
  crockery to use in her bedroom. The rooms of No. 12 had been searched but
  nothing of interest found; it had been quite easy for Belle to hide the
  German Bible in the pocket under her skirt.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Well, another day was over, and Daisy Arrow had gone to the
St. Pancras
  mortuary, but Belle Adair was alive and alert. She had thirteen shillings in
  her pocket. She felt now certain of work in the pantomime. Perhaps they would
  be glad to keep her so long as the <i>Police News</i> and the <i>Morning
  Advertiser</i> were full of the murder of Daisy Arrow. She would be quite an
  attraction.</p>

  <p>Then this expectant hope was clouded over. Mr. Lode liked to keep up
  convention, all his young ladies were respectable, the Cambridge was a nice
  family place, and wasn't "Puss in Boots" supposed to be an entertainment for
  children and decent, homely, kindly people, many of whom did not even know of
  the existence of such establishments as No. 12? The management of the music
  hall might want the whole ugly affair hushed up&mdash;they might not want to
  employ anyone who had the least connection with it she might find herself
  without work or prospects.</p>

  <p>A chill, almost amounting to despair, fell over the heart which had been
  at a high pitch of excitement and anticipation since that early hour when she
  had picked up the German Bible in Daisy Arrow's room.</p>

  <p>As she stood over the darkening embers of the small fire, her shabby neat
  gown and smooth hair banded on either side of her pale face, she rebuked
  herself sharply, as if she had been talking to another person, for this
  stupid elevation of mood.</p>

  <p>Why, after all, had she supposed that the ugly end of Daisy Arrow would be
  of any use to her? Why had she had that curious and unaccountable sense of
  power, when she had picked up the German Bible, as if a weapon with which to
  achieve&mdash;what word should she use?&mdash;progress, a release from her
  present degradation, had been put into her hand? Well, at least as if a
  weapon had been put into her hands. There had been no reason for
  hope&mdash;none at all.</p>

  <p>There was no clue&mdash;at least the police had no clue to the
  murderer&mdash;and could she use any possible clue that she might have, to
  her advantage?</p>

  <p>She would have to go to work very carefully, and meanwhile, for the sake
  of her nerves and peace of mind, she had better, if she could, get out of the
  house.</p>

  <p>Superintendent Matchwell was still in the basement kitchen, and there was
  a sergeant walking up and down outside the house by the broken railing,
  moving on the crowd of clustering sightseers, who had gathered to pry up
  through the fog at the dingy windows and to wonder among
  themselves&mdash;which concealed the room where Daisy Arrow had slept for the
  last time?</p>

  <p>The word "murder," borne on their low fog-hoarsened voices, rose with the
  power of an evil smell round the fated house.</p>

  <p>Belle Adair went downstairs. All the women were, at last, out of the
  way&mdash;scared or quietened, or gossiping in their bedrooms in subdued
  tones. The house was quite silent.</p>

  <p>Superintendent Matchwell was smoking a small cigar and drinking a cup of
  tea which he appeared to have made himself. Belle wondered&mdash;annoyed with
  herself for being interested in such a triviality&mdash;who had lit the fire
  that morning?&mdash;who had swept away the sausage skins and apple parings
  from the rusty bars of the grate?&mdash;who had emptied the ashes, the
  egg-shells? Someone had been at work; the kitchen was quite trim&mdash;the
  curtains had been pulled straight&mdash;the dirty work-basket and the toy
  removed&mdash;the tawdry paper flowers taken away&mdash;the chairs set
  straight&mdash;the tablecloth pulled level&mdash;the piano dusted. The
  trivial sprays of holly with the sparse berries had been taken down from
  behind the portrait of Her Majesty the Queen, and His Grace the Duke of
  Wellington. Only behind the dark print of <i>The Last Judgment</i> above the
  piano remained a stiff bough of yew.</p>

  <p>As Belle Adair glanced at it two trains of thought merged in one in her
  overstimulated mind. What song had she sung there last night? "The Wanderer
  to the Moon." Perhaps Daisy Arrow was now free to travel to the moon. Yew
  trees grew out of graves in country churchyards. Nothing, thought Belle,
  would ever grow out of Daisy's grave.</p>

  <p>With her reserved and ladylike air she approached the superintendent. She
  was gratified to see that he rose at her entry. It was a long time since any
  man had shown her that courtesy. His air of self-respect, trim clothes (he
  was not in uniform), his shining cleanliness, and the earnest sincerity in
  his light eyes, seemed to make of the little kitchen a pleasanter place than
  it had seemed to Belle, since she had first known No. 12.</p>

  <p>Unconsciously, with the air of one who is mistress in her own home, she
  asked him to be seated and herself took the horse-hair by the grate which she
  had occupied last night.</p>

  <p>"This place looks neater and tidier than I have ever seen it
  before&mdash;neater and tidier, indeed, than I ever thought it could be."</p>

  <p>"I got the girls to work on it, ma'am&mdash;Moll, as I think you call
  her&mdash;and the other little creature, Lily Mason. They were glad to have
  something to do, and quite willing to work. They're good girls when you take
  them right."</p>

  <p>She was aware of his cautious professional glance. There could not be a
  single detail of her appearance which escaped his trained observation. She
  was aware, too, of a slight, though skilfully concealed, astonishment on his
  part at her faded gentility&mdash;at her ladylike manners&mdash;at her grace
  and reserve&mdash;at the fact that she should be a resident at No. 12&mdash;a
  companion of women like Florrie and Daisy Arrow like May and Mrs. Bulke.</p>

  <p>Slowly, like one who enters cautiously, but with definite aim, into an
  engagement of wits, she began:</p>

  <p>"The street is full of people staring at the house. I see the constable
  has difficulty in moving them on. Is it not strange that there should be so
  much interest in a tragedy, which is, after all, not such an uncommon
  tragedy&mdash;at least not in Bloomsbury, in a street like this?"</p>

  <p>"I expect, ma'am," said the superintendent quietly and pleasantly, "it's
  being Christmas Day, and there being so many people with nothing to do; and
  then there's a bit of mystery about it at least for those folks out there.
  Would you like a cup of tea, ma'am? I made it myself&mdash;it has not brewed
  long in the pot."</p>

  <p>"Thank you."</p>

  <p>Belle rose, fetched a cup and saucer from the dresser, poured out some of
  the tea.</p>

  <p>"A mystery," she said, returning to the horse-hair chair, "to those people
  out there, Mr. Matchwell, but not perhaps to you."</p>

  <p>If the detective thought that she was endeavouring to draw him, he showed
  no resentment, finding it perhaps the best method to humour her and so, in
  his turn, probe her mind.</p>

  <p>"I can't say as I see much mystery, ma'am. The young woman picked up a
  stranger last night&mdash;brought him home in her way of business, poor
  thing&mdash;and they quarrelled&mdash;he, having the drink in and the knife
  out, made away with her."</p>

  <p>"That's very strange to me," said Belle in a low voice, between dainty
  sips of her tea; "<i>murder</i>; what could the quarrel have been about?"</p>

  <p>"Money, as one may suppose, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"But she wasn't robbed."</p>

  <p>"No, ma'am. There was nothing to rob but a few silly glass trinkets, no
  one would risk a fortnight in the 'lockup' for them. Yet, it might have been
  about money she was trying to get from him."</p>

  <p>"I still don't understand," said Belle, fixing her cool glance on the
  flame between the rusty bars of the grate.</p>

  <p>"Well, he may have been a criminal&mdash;one who's used to these
  things&mdash;quarrelling and knives."</p>

  <p>"If there had been a quarrel," said Belle, "I, who was sleeping next door,
  surely should have heard. It is true I had a dream&mdash;I may have been a
  little disturbed."</p>

  <p>"They may," said the detective quietly, "have quarrelled before they came
  here. She may have thought it had blown over, and he was cherishing it all
  the while and looking for his opportunity. You see, ma'am, we don't know whom
  we're dealing with. They talk of a foreigner and a gentleman; they said, too,
  he was a stranger to her." Mr. Matchwell looked alertly at Belle. "Well, he
  may not have been a stranger. He might have been somebody she'd known before.
  We can't have any idea at present who he was, or what there was between
  them."</p>

  <p>"At present," repeated Belle. "You think, then, you might be able to find
  out?"</p>

  <p>"I hope that we'll find out. I've solved more difficult problems, ma'am,
  and been in charge of more mysterious cases. On the other hand there may not
  be what you'd call a mystery about it at all. He may have been a kind of
  madman. That's well known to Scotland Yard. Creatures who seem on the surface
  quite sane, yet must commit these fearful crimes. Cunning they are, too, and
  often escape; and it would surprise you, ma'am, to see them. They often look
  most unlike what they are."</p>

  <p>"Do they?" said Belle, peering at Mr. Matchwell with a fearful interest.
  "Do they?&mdash;and what is it that they really are?"</p>

  <p>"What you might call monsters, ma'am," said the detective dryly.</p>

  <p>"And what, Detective Matchwell, might one of these monsters look like?"
  asked Belle in a hurried, slurred voice. "Could he, just for instance, by
  chance, look like a pleasant young man, well dressed, with a handsome open
  face?"</p>

  <p>"He might, ma'am, look exactly like that." The detective emptied his cup
  and then asked simply: "You haven't seen anyone like that, either in the
  company of the poor young woman or hanging about the house?"</p>

  <p>"No! No, indeed," said Belle. "I tell you, I only just heard the voice
  last night. I couldn't even say what language he spoke. There was only
  Daisy's word for it that he was a foreigner. I suppose," she added rapidly,
  "it couldn't possibly have been suicide? I know, if perhaps you don't, Mr.
  Matchwell, the kind of life that Daisy Arrow led."</p>

  <p>"I think I know that well enough, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, that was a silly thing for me to say&mdash;but I mean her inner
  life&mdash;how melancholy and despondent she was, and ill,
  too&mdash;consumptive, you know, I think. She really had nothing to live for,
  and she gave rather a silly excuse for taking that knife from the
  dressing-room, didn't she? Mightn't she, when this friend had gone, say,
  perhaps, in some anger and disgust for his not showing her enough kindness or
  not giving her the present that she had expected&mdash;mightn't she&mdash;I
  tell you she was a very moody creature, Mr. Matchwell might she not perhaps
  have disposed of herself?"</p>

  <p>"You forget the basin," smiled the detective. "A man nor a woman neither,
  can't cut their own throat, get off the bed, wash their hands and get back
  again; not with two gashes like that, ma'am&mdash;and they can't dip their
  hands in their own blood and imprint it on their own face&mdash;at least not
  with two gashes like that, nor tear a strip off a towel and make a
  bandage."</p>

  <p>Belle cast down her smooth white lids.</p>

  <p>"Was there <i>that</i> on her face?"</p>

  <p>"There was, ma'am; one may suppose he rested his hand there when he made
  the second wound. She was asleep, we might take it. Don't distress yourself,
  ma'am, I don't suppose she suffered much. You didn't hear a struggle and
  there wasn't a sign of one, and as you say, she'd got nothing much to live
  for."</p>

  <p>"Not any more than anyone in this house has got much to live for, or
  anything at all," said Belle with a cold smile. "Perhaps you wondered a
  little, Mr. Matchwell, what I am doing here? Well, it's easily explained."
  She hurried on without waiting for his answer. "I've been very unfortunate.
  You won't want to hear my history, but it has been one of misfortune. It is
  very difficult for a woman to earn her living in London, sir, and keep out of
  places like this. Mrs. Bulke seemed to me a kind sort of woman, and her room
  was cheap. I've been on the stage for some years now&mdash;not very
  successfully. I didn't know when I came here what kind of house this was. I
  have not been here very much. When I haven't been performing I've been giving
  music lessons in a little room in Baker Street."</p>

  <p>She fluttered her eyes up and saw that the kindly light gaze of the
  detective regarded impartially her clever acting.</p>

  <p>"This has been to me unutterably horrible, unutterably disgusting. I want
  to leave the house. I suppose you would understand that, wouldn't you, sir?
  Might I try to find a room somewhere else?"</p>

  <p>"I can understand your feeling, ma'am. I can see for myself you're out of
  place here. I certainly was surprised to see a lady like yourself
  in&mdash;well&mdash;this house. I don't know that I should have any objection
  to your moving, but you would hardly find another room easily on Christmas
  Day, and, of course, you will be called on as a witness at the inquest."</p>

  <p>"Oh, need I?" said Belle, wrinkling her brow in distress. "I've nothing to
  say."</p>

  <p>"It's a matter of form, ma'am. I had better light the gas&mdash;it's
  getting very dark."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's what I don't like," said Belle rapidly. "I don't feel as if I
  could stay in this house another night. After all, I've had a good deal to
  put up with."</p>

  <p>"I think, ma'am, you've behaved admirably," said the detective.</p>

  <p>As he rose, his dark, neat figure blotted the fire from her view for a
  second; then he had taken matches from his pocket and a spurt of flame
  dispersed the thick shadows and showed the piano with the red pleated silk
  front, the picture of <i>The Last Judgment</i> with the bough of yew above.
  When he had lit the gas, Belle asked:</p>

  <p>"Will there be any witnesses besides the people in this house?" She
  answered herself, saying, "How could there be?"</p>

  <p>"Well, ma'am, I expect there'll be several. I know of two at least, for
  the young woman brought in a bag of fruit. There's a name on
  that&mdash;Arthur Lummin.' We found him easily enough&mdash;a fruiterer in
  Covent Garden. There's a waiter at the Argyll Rooms, too. He knew Miss Daisy
  Arrow quite well by sight, and the fruiterer remembered the young woman and
  her companion quite well, too."</p>

  <p>"And her companion?" echoed Belle.</p>

  <p>The acrid light of the gas shot up from the heart-shaped flame in the
  glass globe.</p>

  <p>"And her companion, too, ma'am," said the detective quietly.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what happened to the key?"</p>

  <p>"Thrown away by the murderer&mdash;as usual."</p>

  <p>Belle smiled.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle, Lily Mason, Moll and the little boy all slept in the
kitchen that
  night with the fire kept going&mdash;the gas turned low, all resting as best
  they could on chairs and mattresses on the floor. The other women were
  huddled somehow into Mrs. Bulke's bedroom; a constable kept guard in the
  parlour.</p>

  <p>Belle had procured herself another good meal, and a glass of old sherry
  from Mrs. Bulke's store. She had washed again in warm water, with a cake of
  good soap that Lily Mason had shyly proffered. She felt
  refreshed&mdash;raised in her own esteem, as if she were a more estimable
  member of society than she had been the day before.</p>

  <p>Yes, even lying on a mattress in the kitchen that was so much cleaner and
  neater than it had been yesterday, even part of this sordid excitement and
  wretched upset, she felt she had regained something of her own
  self-respect.</p>

  <p>That conversation with Superintendent Matchwell, when he had treated her
  as a sensible human being&mdash;treated her as a lady, that had soothed her
  bruised and broken pride which she had believed only a short while before to
  be utterly crushed.</p>

  <p>As she lay there&mdash;shawls and blankets over her&mdash;on the mattress,
  her head propped on a pillow, staring at the fire which Lily Mason had made
  up just before they had tried to sleep, she felt as if she were once more
  part of an ordered existence, not a mere waif or outcast who had no useful or
  necessary place in the world. She knew, she reasoned with herself acutely,
  that she had no firm foundation for this belief and hope, but they were
  there. She looked at her fine hands, smoothly-turned wrists, and delicate
  forearms, in the fire-light. A little good food, such as she had had to-day,
  a little warmth and ease of mind&mdash;she might be a lively pretty woman
  again.</p>

  <p>Had that acute detective, used as he must be to dealing with human nature
  and with the underworld, believed he simple story?&mdash;a gentlewoman
  struggling to earn her live'; hood&mdash;an actress of the better sort, not
  knowing to what manner of house she had gone? Had he believed about the
  little music shop in Baker Street?&mdash;would there be enquiries into her
  past life? She did not think so.</p>

  <p>She would have to give evidence at the inquest, but it would not be of
  much importance. She could soon, with her intelligence and her respectful
  air, impress the coroner that she had spoken the truth. She would appear for
  a moment in the coroner's court, and disappear again. That would do her no
  harm. Her name was easily changed. She need not be for long contaminated by
  any association with Daisy Arrow.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, how to get out of this? She almost formed the question aloud,
  anxious as she was not to disturb the other uneasy sleepers in the
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>She longed, as she had hardly ever longed before, to find a few pounds and
  decent lodgings&mdash;some foothold in the world of respectability.</p>

  <p>"I thought that I had forgotten how to care, and now I care a great
  deal&mdash;more than I ever thought possible. Am I a fool to think that I can
  regain anything, lust when everything seems so lost&mdash;just when I seem to
  be indifferent that it was lost? Was it only yesterday that I had in my hand
  that knife, which is now, as I suppose, at Scotland Yard? I had better not
  think about it. I must try to sleep a little or I shall be quite upset and
  give way."</p>

  <p>She readjusted her pillow&mdash;under it was the carpetbag in which lay
  the plumes and the German Bible.</p>

  <p>Lily Mason was crying and gurgling in her sleep. Moll was restless with
  ugly twitches of body and face.</p>

  <p>Strange, thought Belle contemptuously, that last night when it really
  happened we were all at peace, and tonight, when there is nothing to be
  afraid of, we are all in a panic.</p>

  <p>After all, she could not sleep. She pulled herself to her knees on the
  warm mattress&mdash;the shawls and blankets fell off her slender figure. She
  clasped her hands before her lips and muttered:</p>

  <p>"O God! O God, give me a chance."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The inquest on Daisy Arrow was a mere formality. In the
official language
  of Superintendent Matchwell, this first enquiry into the murder elicited "no
  information which could assist the course of justice."</p>

  <p>The inhabitants of No. 12, Great Hogarth Street, repeated the evidence
  which they had already given in private examination.</p>

  <p>The Covent Garden greengrocer remembered Daisy Arrow&mdash;who was well
  known to him by sight&mdash;pausing with a companion to buy fruit late on
  Christmas Eve, but, owing to the fog and the ill illumination in his shop
  (he, being just on the point of closing, having turned the gas out, had
  fetched the fruit by the light of a candle), could not give a very
  satisfactory description of this same companion, who was muffled hi a light
  greatcoat, had his hands in his pockets, a scarf round his neck, and his hat
  pulled down over his eyes. He was well-dressed&mdash;the fruiterer had
  noticed that, because he had usually seen Daisy Arrow with men in shabby or
  flashy attire. But this stranger's clothes had been good, and he seemed a
  gentleman.</p>

  <p>This evidence thus corroborated the impression given to Mrs. Bulke, to
  Belle Adair, and to the other women in the kitchen of No. 12 on the night of
  the murder, when they had heard the soft yet emphatic masculine tones in the
  passage above.</p>

  <p>Another witness was the waiter at the Argyll Rooms. He deposed to having
  seen Daisy Arrow there on Christmas Eve. He had noticed that she drank a good
  deal more than was customary with her, and that in contradiction to her usual
  demeanour, she had been very excited and gay. Unfortunately this man, who
  seemed stupid and had great difficulty in expressing himself, had not taken
  much heed of Daisy Arrow's companion. He could only repeat that he had
  himself been tired, the place had been so noisy and so full of people and
  cigar smoke. Daisy Arrow had been with several gentlemen, exchanging jokes,
  merriment and drinks. He could recall that she had been drawn apart by a
  tall, well-dressed man, who seemed to be speaking to her in a foreign
  language. They had been talking earnestly and with great animation at one of
  the small tables in the alcove, but the waiter could give no description of
  the person of this gentleman.</p>

  <p>Belle Adair, seated on the witnesses' bench in the ugly dull Coroner's
  Court, listened to all this futile evidence with a secret and exultant sense
  of power. She did not yet in the least know how she could make use of that
  glimpse of the stranger for whom the detective was searching, or of the
  Bible, still safely hidden in her carpet-bag, but the mere fact that she knew
  more than all the other people, more than the coroner or the detective or the
  police or any of the witnesses, gave her keen pleasure. The knowledge that
  they were all stumbling after she had&mdash;clearly and precisely. She could
  have described the wanted man with each detail of his attire. She could have
  drawn his portrait. She believed that, from the inscriptions in the German
  Bible, she knew his name, and something of his history.</p>

  <p>She had given her own evidence in a quiet, respectful and regretful manner
  that she was sure had impressed the coroner. He had spoken to her in quite a
  different tone from that he had used to the other women. She was gratified
  that she had made a good effect in her shabby, neat clothes and her pale face
  devoid of paint&mdash;with her decorous veil and bonnet, and her
  bay-leaf-coloured hair knotted through the strings in the nape of her neck.
  She had persuaded them, she was almost sure, that she was an unfortunate
  gentlewoman and, only by accident, had found herself in such company as Mrs.
  Bulke kept at No. 12.</p>

  <p>These false pretenses, however, which at first had seemed to her so
  secure, were shaken, and the woman herself was angered into both fear and
  rebellion by what she learned of the activities of the police who were
  employed on the case.</p>

  <p>In the space of a very few days, Scotland Yard had discovered without
  difficulty, and produced as a matter of course the real identity of the
  people by whom Belle had been for some time surrounded; people who were very
  careful never to reveal, or even to hint at, what they really were behind
  their tricks and poses. The cool, matter-of-fact, disinterested evidence of
  the police destroyed all these gaudy shams, and named, with cool exactitude,
  people and things that Belle had tried never even to think of in their
  correct colours.</p>

  <p>Even the dead woman was, as it were, pursued into her grave&mdash;unmasked
  and exposed. There was no such person as Daisy Arrow. It was Martha
  Owen&mdash;aged thirty-three, unmarried, with a child of eight years of age,
  formerly lodging in the Waterloo Road and in the Tottenham Court
  Road&mdash;well-known to the police&mdash;belonging to what was usually
  termed "an unfortunate class of woman," but branded now by a plainer
  name&mdash;who had had her throat cut at No. 12, Great Hogarth Street on
  Christmas Eve.</p>

  <p>There was a plain name, too, for No. 12, and for Mrs. Bulke&mdash;Sarah
  Jones, also unmarried, who had been in prison twice, once in Exeter and once
  in Bodmin&mdash;formerly a circus rider, but for many years earning her
  living in a fashion which had frequently brought her to the notice of the
  police. To escape their warnings, she had moved frequently from place to
  place, changing her name but never her profession.</p>

  <p>Minnie Palmer's name was Mary Jenkins. She, too, had been in prison, and
  the coroner spoke to her in a manner of kind rebuke that reduced her to
  passionate tears of sentimental vanity.</p>

  <p>When Belle's turn had come to give evidence, she had thought
  bitterly&mdash;"I suppose they have found out all about me." Yet she wondered
  if that were possible. She had been, she was sure, so clever, covered up her
  tracks so adroitly. She was prepared to defy their utmost ingenuity&mdash;to
  lie and lie again.</p>

  <p>But they did not drive her to this expedient, perhaps because she was
  unknown to the police and had never been involved in any criminal case. They
  accepted her as Belle Adair, an actress and dancer. She admitted that that
  was her stage name, but she had acted under others, Belle Beaumont, Rose
  Vere, and she had asked with a look of candour at the coroner which she
  endeavoured to render as appealing as possible, "Need I, sir, reveal my true
  name here? I have relatives, you understand&mdash;my family&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The coroner replied that he could understand and respect her reason. She
  was allowed to retain her <i>incognita</i>. She thanked him graciously, and
  gave her evidence with satisfactory precision and clarity. Then that was
  over&mdash;an open verdict returned&mdash;"Murder against some person or
  persons unknown."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"I am glad," thought Belle, "that I didn't have to identify
the body. I
  don't suppose poor Daisy looks very pretty by now."</p>

  <p>She had been maliciously pleased to see how downcast and sick the members
  of the jury looked when they filed back to their places, after having
  returned through the brown varnished door that concealed the room where Daisy
  Arrow lay&mdash;"smug, respectable, selfish people, all of them," thought
  Belle. "It will do them good to hear of this kind of thing&mdash;it will do
  them good to see this kind of thing&mdash;indeed, it will."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bulke's evil eyes, hard and sullen, had identified Daisy Arrow; a
  cockney young man, awkward and ashamed in a tight blue coat with brass
  buttons, who kept twisting his cap round and round in his hands, a much
  younger brother, who had not seen his sister for ten years or more, but who
  knew her story as he had heard it often enough from her father who had died
  last year, had also looked on the body and had said that it was that of
  Martha Owen, his sister.</p>

  <p>John Owen, of Welsh origin, had been a baker in Clerkenwell. His son,
  awkward and nervous in the witness-box, had insisted that they were all
  respectable people, and his other sisters were married to decent men; one of
  them had bought the bakery. He&mdash;Roger Owen&mdash;was a button-maker
  himself, and did well he had his own little business and lodged with his
  sister.</p>

  <p>But Martha had always gone on her own. She had been in service as quite a
  young girl and had run away&mdash;some trouble with a footman. Her parents
  had found her, though with great difficulty, another place. Again she had
  been disgraced, and this time dismissed. Then, they had lost sight of the
  light pretty creature.</p>

  <p>She had come home once&mdash;too gaily dressed, too much money in her
  purse. Her tale was plausible. She had found a post as companion to a lady.
  She seemed, indeed, in the eyes of her simple kinsfolk, to have an air of
  gentility. She had picked up, it seemed to her relations, some airs and
  graces of society, and they thought her clothes tasteful.</p>

  <p>She had then disappeared. She had written to them from
  abroad&mdash;France, the young man thought it was. He had lost the letter. He
  remembered that his mother had given it to him to write to that address, but
  he had not had the heart or the courage to do so. His parents had died soon
  after; he had washed his hands of Martha; probably if his mother had lived
  she herself would have written. It was a good many years ago and he was sure
  that the letter was lost.</p>

  <p>The police were a little vexed about this. There seemed some possible
  connection between Daisy Arrow's visit abroad and the foreigner whom she had
  brought home with her on the last night of her life. But, as the letter could
  not be found and the young man's memory was not reliable, this small clue
  could not be followed up.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When Belle Adair left the ugly brick building, she did not
go her way, but
  walked up and down the dingy, greasy street. It was the first week of
  January, the very dead time of the year. It was all very well, no doubt, for
  those who were happy or active or enclosed in their own homes, but completely
  stagnant and dismal for those who had neither activity nor happiness, but who
  remained shut out from all festivities, tasting only the staleness of the
  winter, the filth of the city, the bitterness of the bleak season.</p>

  <p>It was Roger Owen for whom Belle waited. He came out quickly with his
  awkward step, his flushed face frowning, nervously playing with his cap.</p>

  <p>She spoke to him at once, with her well-bred air of assurance.</p>

  <p>"I was a friend, Mr. Owen, of your sister's, when she had very few
  friends. Might I speak to you? Just a few words."</p>

  <p>He glanced at her with dismay and shame. Belle noticed that he had reddish
  hair like Daisy, and good straight features like Daisy, though his
  cheek-bones were too high and flat, his complexion dull and pock-marked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am," he said hastily, "of course&mdash;as you please&mdash;as you
  wish."</p>

  <p>He fell into step beside her elegant shabbiness.</p>

  <p>She sensed his relief at her difference from the other women who had also
  been his sister's companions, and who had filled him, she was sure, with
  terror and disgust; for honesty and respectability shone in the young man,
  from his thick, carefully blacked boots to his smoothly brushed, shining
  hair. She noted that he did not wear mourning, but had a crape band on his
  right arm.</p>

  <p>"You must not think of me, Mr. Owen, as being the same as those other
  creatures who lived in Mrs. Bulke's house. I only took a room there by chance
  for quite a short time. I have&mdash;as you may remember came out in the
  evidence&mdash;a part in the pantomime 'Puss in Boots' at the Cambridge.
  Belle Adair, as you may also remember, is my stage name. Illness and foolish
  speculation reduced my family to such straits that I was forced to earn my
  living in the only way open to a gentlewoman." A sidelong look assured her
  that he was impressed, if bewildered, by her explanation, and that he was
  quite overawed by, and powerless before, her direct and well-bred
  personality. "You are going towards Holborn?" she asked. "The fog seems dense
  in that direction, and how cold it is! I will, however, walk with you a
  little way." She leaned towards him, as she did so, lowering her veil over
  her too brilliant eyes. "What a pity, Mr. Owen, that you lost that letter
  from France. Do you know, I had the impression that you <i>hadn't</i> lost
  it."</p>

  <p>"Had you?" said he, starting violently and gaping at her. "Had you now,
  ma'am?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I think if the police had been a little more clever&mdash;or
  should we say, a little more interested&mdash;they would have forced you to
  say that you'd got it&mdash;and perhaps other papers about poor Daisy."</p>

  <p>"It were no business of theirs," said the young man, embarrassed and
  sullen. "She is dead, ain't she? And paid for all. I'd like to see the
  hanging of the man who did it. Poor Martha, she couldn't help the way she
  went&mdash;she was good-hearted, too&mdash;she used to send us money at one
  time. I expect it was villains getting hold of her in the beginning."</p>

  <p>"I expect so," said Belle smoothly, "it nearly always is. If one is young
  and gay and fond of pleasure, it is very difficult to avoid trouble. Now,
  won't you tell me about those letters, Mr. Owen? If you've got one or several
  and would let me read them, I perhaps could help you. I could advise
  you&mdash;whether you should take them to the police or perhaps to a lawyer.
  You see, you want the murderer of Daisy discovered, don't you? There might be
  a clue in those letters."</p>

  <p>"I know, ma'am. I can't say what came over me to give the gentleman the
  lie like that. But I didn't want to go into it somehow&mdash;I didn't see
  what good it 'ud do, and I am not clever at talking&mdash;not at making
  myself clear, as you might say."</p>

  <p>"I understand. But don't you think if I were to come over with you to
  Clerkenwell now, and you were to show me those letters, it would be quite a
  wise action on your part? And you could easily explain away your denial to
  the coroner; you could say that you had found the letters by
  chance&mdash;that the subject having been brought again to your mind, you had
  looked once more, and had discovered them in some unlikely place."</p>

  <p>She saw him glance at her through the thickening fog&mdash;with admiration
  for her obvious sharpness, and mistrust of her possible duplicity. She saw
  his stupid eyes travel over her person, and she sensed, with some amusement,
  his relief at the quiet neatness of her appearance. He would not be ashamed
  of taking her to his sister's home&mdash;he would not mind letting the
  neighbours know that this had been a friend of poor Martha. Belle believed
  that the young man, in his simplicity, would be quite gratified to let his
  little circle in Clerkenwell&mdash;a little circle of such honest and
  hard-working respectable people&mdash;know that poor Martha, whose story had
  been well blown abroad in the daily newspapers, had had a real lady, like
  herself, for a friend.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The management of the Cambridge had been rather doubtful
about the
  propriety of retaining the services of any ladies who had been involved in
  the tragedy of Daisy Arrow. But after the inquest was over and the police had
  arrested no one, and there had not been, after all, very much sensation about
  the dismal, but hardly surprising end of a nobody, and when it had been found
  that the name of Belle Adair, displayed on the placards outside the
  Cambridge, had attracted a certain amount of curiosity-mongers, she was
  allowed to continue in the part, and even to dance every night the <i>pas
  seul</i> to the Moss Rose waltz.</p>

  <p>Mocking at herself with detached irony, she had taken two resolutions on
  New Year's Day&mdash;she would have nothing more to do with Mrs. Bulke and
  her young women, and she would stop drinking. She had found, for ten
  shillings a week, a tiny upper room in Holborn, and, as no more shillings
  went on gin or sherry, or even bottled porter, the other pound stood her very
  well for food and other necessaries. It pleased her to think that she could
  thus readily, and hardly without any effort or pain, stop drinking, and it
  gave her a sense of power to be sober among people who were nearly always in
  various stages of drunkenness.</p>

  <p>Like bats when an old building is pulled down and the daylight let in,
  Mrs. Bulke and her lodgers had flapped away into another darkness and No. 12
  was to let&mdash;a prey to sightseers. What arrangements Mrs. Bulke had made
  about the landlord, or the rent, or the furniture, whether or no she had fled
  on warnings from the police, Belle was ignorant, but it gave her a certain
  acrid satisfaction to know that the house was empty, shuttered and bolted.
  The brown paper would have fallen from the broken pane in her room, the
  stained pillow would have been removed from Daisy Arrow's room, and the
  drugget would have been taken up from the knot in the boards where she had
  thrown the key. She had a qualm there&mdash;supposing someone were to alter
  the house, to rebuild or take the floor up&mdash;and find the key? It would
  probably be at once connected with the murder&mdash;with Belle herself who
  had been the occupant of that room on Christmas Eve.</p>

  <p>Yet, this was unlikely. It was much more probable that the house would
  remain for long untenanted, and when it was let, taken by someone far too
  feckless to spend any money on repairs.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle Adair had, besides the Bible and the pink plumes,
something else,
  useful perhaps, and curious certainly in her carpet-bag&mdash;the two slender
  letters which had been given her by Roger Owen. She could not very well
  understand their meaning, though the sentences were plain enough; one was in
  German, a language with which she was well acquainted, and was an enclosure
  in an epistle which Daisy Arrow had sent from Germany about five years
  before. Yes, that was clear from the date on the letter.</p>

  <p>Roger Owen, of course, had not been able to make head or tail of this, and
  could scarcely, with his own poor scholarship and Daisy's poor scrawl, spell
  out his sister's letter.</p>

  <p>Belle had told him smoothly that there was nothing of importance on the
  two flimsy sheets. Good-hearted Daisy had merely written from abroad to say
  that she had found a situation in a well-placed family as a kind of nursery
  governess&mdash;that she was quite happy and hoped to send some money soon.
  Then, pretending to translate the letter in the foreign language, Belle had
  said it was merely a few lines from the lady who had employed Daisy, stating
  how satisfactory the girl was, and promising to keep her in her service.</p>

  <p>Roger Owen accepted this information without demur. It confirmed his own
  opinion and that of his late parents&mdash;"a bit of Martha's nonsense,
  writing like that from foreign parts."</p>

  <p>"You see, ma'am, it was no good for me to keep them letters, and I might
  as well have said&mdash;as I did say to the coroner&mdash;that I had lost
  them. For, after all, it would have been no good to bring up that business
  about Martha being in France; then perhaps they'd have made enquiries and
  found that she had got into disgrace there, and had to be sent home&mdash;for
  that is what must have happened, for she was back soon enough and no more
  heard of it."</p>

  <p>Belle thought so too. Daisy was so reckless, flighty, so fond of
  pleasure&mdash;really incorrigible; no doubt by her own bad behaviour she had
  lost the chance abroad as she had lost several chances in England.</p>

  <p>A pity! The girl had been bright, intelligent, graceful and pretty above
  her station.</p>

  <p>Belle had said that she would like to keep the letters as a souvenir of
  poor Daisy. Roger Owen had been touched. He had been fond of his sister
  himself, although he remembered so little of her silly gentle ways.</p>

  <p>Belle had slipped the thin packet packet with the foreign stamps into her
  reticule and talked of other things, and now it lay safely in the carpet-bag
  next the plume of pink feathers and the German Bible.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the beginning of February, Belle went to Scotland Yard
and asked to see
  Superintendent Matchwell. She was told that if she returned in half an hour
  or so, she might see him, so she went to the fruit-pie-maker's at the corner,
  and asked for a tart and a glass of milk. When sherry, as a matter of course,
  was offered her, she declined it with a smile.</p>

  <p>Daisy's father had been a baker. In Clerkenwell, Belle had seen the little
  shop, with rolls and seed-cake in the window, where Daisy must often have
  played about as a child&mdash;a charming, radiant little child, no doubt.</p>

  <p>Belle thought of the picture of <i>The Last Judgment</i> with the thick
  spray of yew stuck above the bird's-eye maple frame. Who had taken that down?
  Who had flung aside the bough of evergreen that was the only funeral wreath
  that Daisy Arrow had ever had?</p>

  <p>Belle nibbled her tart and looked out of the clean window at the large new
  public-house they were building at the corner&mdash;at the row of new, neat
  shops that had lately been erected&mdash;at the eating-house, where the
  colliers up from the coal barges moored in the Thames, went for their rough
  refreshments.</p>

  <p>She was very trimly dressed, but she wished she could have had another few
  pounds&mdash;say five or six pounds&mdash;to lay out on her appearance. She
  was still a little too shabby&mdash;with all her care and skill, with
  cleaning, with needle and thread, her garments were patched and darned. Save
  for her bright, vigilant eyes and her erect personable carriage, her swift
  walk and graceful poise, she knew that she looked like a creature in need of
  charity; and it was not her intention, at the present moment, to appear so
  obviously poor. Still, she had done her best, and luck might, somehow,
  turn.</p>

  <p>Strange that she, who had been at such a complete point of desperation,
  handling a heavy vinegar-stained clasp-knife before a cracked mirror, should
  once again have begun to plan&mdash;to hope&mdash;to crave&mdash;to scheme,
  and to set up pretences, not only before others, but even before herself.
  Yes, she was re-valuing herself in her own eyes, hiding away much of the
  past, only remembering what she wished to remember.</p>

  <p>Superintendent Matchwell received Belle in a room as neat, as formal, as
  non-committal as his own personality.</p>

  <p>She seated herself with deliberate grace on one of the varnished chairs.
  As she folded her hands in her lap, she had the pleasurable sensation that
  she folded them round a weapon, and that she was about to engage in a duel
  with one whose skill would excitingly exert all her reserves of courage and
  of intelligence.</p>

  <p>Knowing that he would soon lose patience with her if she wasted his time,
  she came at once to what she thought would be of some importance to him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Matchwell, or Superintendent Matchwell&mdash;indeed, I don't quite
  know the correct way of addressing a detective&mdash;I have come to you
  because I have been, ever since that dreadful night at No. 12, anxious and
  worried."</p>

  <p>As she paused he put in smoothly:</p>

  <p>"But you have no cause to be, that I can see, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have cause."</p>

  <p>Behind her cheap veil, her cool guarded eyes surveyed his cheerful, dry
  pock-marked face as he smiled at her with an indifferent, kindly
  indulgence.</p>

  <p>"I have been wondering if you believe my evidence."</p>

  <p>"I believe, ma'am, the coroner was quite satisfied, was he not?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir, as I suppose," said Belle, "but you're in charge of the
  case, are you not? You are continuing investigations, and it doesn't mean,
  does it, because an inquest is closed with an open verdict, it ends the
  matter?"</p>

  <p>"No, it doesn't mean so at all," replied the detective quietly. "I'm going
  on working, of course. I always do go on working. The more mysterious the
  case is at first, the longer it takes&mdash;the fewer the clues are the
  greater the labour we have to put into solving them."</p>

  <p>"Are there some mysteries which are never solved&mdash;some clues which
  lead nowhere?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally there are," nodded the detective; "naturally."</p>

  <p>"And do you think this is such a case?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't tell you that, ma'am, now, could I? I don't think it's a very
  important or interesting case."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Belle; "Daisy Arrow wasn't very important or interesting, was
  she? But I haven't come to you about that. I have been uneasy
  lately&mdash;wondering if you thought that I knew more than I told."</p>

  <p>"I never thought of that, ma'am." With a sudden change to a stern,
  decisive note the detective added: "And I don't think you ever thought I did.
  You have come here for another purpose, and, as my time's not my own, I'd be
  glad, ma'am, if you'd come to it direct."</p>

  <p>"You're mistaken," said Belle, unmoved. "I did think that you suspected
  me. I was really the only intelligent and educated witness, and you never
  took any trouble to examine me&mdash;or to try to force me to say what I
  didn't want to say&mdash;or to take me by surprise and wear me out&mdash;but
  just accepted my evidence as you accepted that of those others."</p>

  <p>"And what deduction did you make from that, ma'am?"</p>

  <p>"This deduction&mdash;that you thought that whatever you did, I should be
  too much for you and that you'd never get the truth from me."</p>

  <p>The detective smiled as if he were rather bored by this interview, but
  accepted it placidly as part of the tedious duty of the day.</p>

  <p>"And what is your object in coming to me now, ma'am?"</p>

  <p>"I don't feel free, and I don't feel easy," repeated Belle. "I thought
  that when I went to Clerkenwell to see Roger Owen I was watched."</p>

  <p>"And so you were, ma'am, as a matter of course."</p>

  <p>"You thought it was rather a peculiar thing that I should go to visit
  Daisy Arrow's brother."</p>

  <p>"I don't say that."</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Matchwell, there really was nothing peculiar in it at all. I
  daresay you know a good deal of most things&mdash;I expect you know
  everything of the kind of woman that Daisy Arrow was; the sort of world she
  moved in. But believe me, Mr. Matchwell, there is a great deal you do not
  know about the sort of woman I am."</p>

  <p>"That's very likely, too, ma'am," the detective agreed pleasantly, gazing
  at two drab sparrows on the drab sill beyond the clean window pane.</p>

  <p>"I have thought to myself lately," said Belle, glancing down at her hands
  which she was folding placidly in her shabby lap, "that you didn't believe
  me. You thought I knew something about the crime&mdash;could give you,
  perhaps, some clues, but that it was not my wish to do so. I thought that I
  might be watched. The idea of that was odious to me. And so it came to me
  that I would seek you out and tell you plainly that you were mistaken."</p>

  <p>"That's very likely, too, ma'am. To what particular mistake do you
  refer?"</p>

  <p>"Your idea&mdash;that you are cherishing even at this moment, Mr.
  Matchwell&mdash;that I can be of any use to you in this case. Believe me, I
  liked Daisy, I was fond of her, I was quite shocked by the wretched story
  that came out at the inquest. I was once able to do her small
  kindnesses&mdash;there was some good in the girl."</p>

  <p>She wondered what impression she was making on the cool, neat man seated
  opposite, if she was being quite as clever as she thought she was, and if it
  would not have been better, after all, to have left Scotland Yard alone.</p>

  <p>But she was enjoying herself; it was long since she had had any
  intellectual pleasure comparable to this, long since she had been in a
  position of equality with a person of responsibility and good sense. She
  desired to prolong the interview, which at least consolidated and clarified
  the personality she was creating out of Belle Adair. Sighing, she
  repeated:</p>

  <p>"Daisy Arrow had a difficult life, many temptations."</p>

  <p>"Very likely, ma'am, very likely."</p>

  <p>"This being so, you well may imagine the manner of her death was a
  tremendous shock to me! Waking up on that Christmas morning and hearing that
  clamour outside, and learning what had happened next door! That, Mr.
  Matchwell, nearly unhinged my mind."</p>

  <p>"And so it would have done, ma'am. Everyone admired, I'm sure, the courage
  with which you gave your evidence; many ladies would have collapsed, fainted,
  or perhaps, screamed out, but you was admirably cool,
  ma'am&mdash;admirably."</p>

  <p>Belle flashed him a steady look.</p>

  <p>"It was because of my affection for Daisy Arrow and the pain that I had
  received at her murder that I went home with Roger Owen. I could see that he
  was stupid, bewildered, as if the coroner had frightened him and he was
  ashamed of what he had to confess about his poor sister before all those
  strangers. And I thought that if I could get him to myself and obtain his
  confidence, I might find out a little more than the coroner seemed
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Very commendable in you, I am sure, ma'am," smiled the detective,
  stroking his sandy whiskers with a blunt, well-kept hand. "And what precisely
  might be your reason for wanting this extra bit of knowledge?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to find out the murderer of Daisy. When he spoke of a foreign
  letter, I believed there might be a clue."</p>

  <p>"He said he'd destroyed the letters," remarked the detective blandly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but you didn't quite believe that, did you? I didn't. I thought that
  he just told the coroner the lie as an ignorant bewildered person will. And
  it was a lie, Mr. Matchwell; there were letters."</p>

  <p>"Ah, indeed, ma'am, and are they in your possession?"</p>

  <p>"No; I found that Roger Owen was almost illiterate&mdash;that he could
  scarcely read them; poor Daisy's writing and spelling were childish, too. He
  had kept them from reasons of sentiment, I suppose. There was nothing in
  them. They were written from France."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes?"</p>

  <p>"France, where, evidently, Daisy was in some post as maid to the daughter
  of a retired officer living near Paris&mdash;Chantilly&mdash;you know it
  perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard of it, ma'am; where there's a big palace belonging to a
  French prince."</p>

  <p>"Precisely, Mr. Matchwell. And as there was nothing in the letters at all,
  and as Roger Owen seemed overset at me seeing them, I just tore them up in
  his presence and threw them into the fire." Belle rose. "I thought, to ease
  your necessary curiosity, Mr. Matchwell, that I should tell you this."</p>

  <p>"It is kind of you, indeed, I am sure, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"You see, Mr. Matchwell, I can't be of the least use to you. This has
  been, from one aspect, a mere waste of time on your part&mdash;perhaps on
  mine&mdash;but as I thought perhaps that you were having me watched, and I
  was to you an object of suspicion, I decided to tell you the little scrap I
  knew. I can't help it, can I?&mdash;whether you believe me or not. It's the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"It's very kind of you, indeed, ma'am, very conscientious and very
  laudable, and I'm much obliged to you."</p>

  <p>Belle moved towards the door and paused by the window, and looked out on
  the river, the colour of ashes where the coal-barges were moored, above which
  the soiled yellowish vapour of the clouds trailed across a leaden-coloured
  sky.</p>

  <p>"I've never come in contact with the police before, Superintendent."</p>

  <p>"I know that, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"And I was much impressed," continued Belle, with a polite smile, "by the
  fact that you knew, or could discover so soon, the histories of all those
  people with whom I was associated, and which were so different from the
  stories they had told me and which I, with my inexperience, had believed. I
  suppose," she added, "there's nothing you don't know or couldn't find out
  about anyone?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't go so far as to say that, ma'am, but there isn't much
  difficulty in tracing most people."</p>

  <p>Belle, still smiling and glancing from the dull prospect of the river and
  the coal-barges to her own elegant hands, asked:</p>

  <p>"Would you be able to find out about me, a miserable, insignificant
  creature like myself?"</p>

  <p>"If needs were, I suppose we could, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Then, if you ever do, Mr. Matchwell, and the story seems to my discredit,
  I hope you will remember how difficult it is for a woman, who has few or no
  relatives, who has little or no money, and who is pursued by a series of
  misfortunes."</p>

  <p>"The world is hard on women, ma'am, there's no doubt of that."</p>

  <p>"And particularly hard, Mr. Matchwell, on some types of woman, and the
  woman who's a little more intelligent than her fellows, a little more
  high-spirited, and yet hasn't got quite enough talent, quite enough
  attraction to make a success of herself."</p>

  <p>"That's easy to see and sad to know," said the detective. "Yes, the
  world's a hard place for women, ma'am, especially the divorced women."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Belle quickly, "divorce makes it all the more difficult,
  especially if one is divorced with ignominy, perhaps undeserved, and left
  without a penny, and forsaken by the man for whose sake one has risked
  everything. Such a situation would leave a woman, Mr. Matchwell, in a
  miserable, an undefended position."</p>

  <p>"Especially," said the detective, with a stiff little bow, "a proud, an
  elegant, and an intelligent woman."</p>

  <p>"If," said Belle, with a sidelong glance at his commonplace composure, "a
  gentleman had those thoughts, he would be discreet and merciful, Mr.
  Matchwell."</p>

  <p>The detective bowed again without replying. Belle moved slowly, her ruined
  but neat flounces trailing on the bare floor. At the door she paused.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, sir, you haven't any prospects of an arrest&mdash;any
  suspicions? No; that is a foolish question&mdash;you would not be likely to
  tell me if you had."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't mind telling you, ma'am, because it'll be in all the
  evening papers. We made an arrest a couple of hours ago."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Belle. "Oh!" Then hastily: "Why didn't you tell me that
  before?"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't, I suppose, ma'am, what you came here to talk about. I was
  listening to information&mdash;not giving it."</p>

  <p>"So, an arrest has been made. I wonder if that is the murderer?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, I am sure, ma'am. It will have to be, as I suppose, a judge
  and jury who decide that, if he gets past the magistrate. He'll be charged at
  Bow Street."</p>

  <p>"Who is he, Mr. Matchwell?"</p>

  <p>"A German, a ship's doctor&mdash;Dr. Christian Schoppe"&mdash;the
  detective precisely spelt out the name: "s-c-h-o-p-p-e."</p>

  <p>"A doctor? A respectable man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the ship's surgeon on a good-sized passenger steamer put in at
  Ramsgate and going on to Brazil. Lucky for him, ma'am, that he is a German
  and respectable; those points will go in his favour."</p>

  <p>"Why did you suspect him? What made you arrest him?"</p>

  <p>"As to our methods and our business," replied Mr. Matchwell, opening the
  door to get rid of her, "I shouldn't care to trouble you with them."</p>

  <p>Belle, with her foot over the threshold, yet turned and looked back over
  her shoulder to murmur:</p>

  <p>"What kind of a man is he? It makes one feel dizzy to think of it! He must
  be a monster!"</p>

  <p>"There is, ma'am, no doubt he's a monster if he is the murderer," replied
  Mr. Matchwell quietly; "but as for my describing him to you, I haven't seen
  him myself yet."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"In a cell at Bow Street Station."</p>

  <p>"And what&mdash;what will be the next step that you will take?"</p>

  <p>"We shall bring him face to face with the waiter in the Argyll Rooms and
  the Covent Garden fruiterer, and see if they can identify him."</p>

  <p>"But both these men said that they hardly remembered poor Daisy's
  companion."</p>

  <p>"Well, we shall see that," said the detective, still patiently holding the
  door ready for Belle to depart. "It's a question of clothes, and height, and
  face, and voice."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes&mdash;voice! I heard his voice quite distinctly, not only through
  the door, but when I was awakened at night."</p>

  <p>"Ah, was you awakened at night? You never said so at the inquest."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I didn't. It may have escaped my mind. It is so trivial&mdash;it
  wouldn't have helped anything."</p>

  <p>"It might. It might have fixed the time of the murder."</p>

  <p>"But I don't know when I heard the voice. It was dark; even if it had been
  light, I had no clock."</p>

  <p>"But you did hear them&mdash;voices&mdash;those of this stranger and the
  murdered young woman?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I heard them&mdash;just a murmur. The man's tones were peculiar and
  fixed themselves in my mind. If I could hear them again I might be able to
  identify them."</p>

  <p>"You shall have your opportunity."</p>

  <p>Belle still hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Please tell me why he was suspected."</p>

  <p>"Well, simple enough. They found a bit of his ship's writing paper in the
  alcove where the poor woman was seen with the foreigner. It smelt of medicine
  or drugs&mdash;was stained with 'em. That gave us his profession."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle bought an evening paper and, by the candlelight in
her wretched
  little room, pondered over it deeply. The case that had been to the curious
  only a nine days wonder, and in which no great popular interest had ever been
  taken, had suddenly achieved a considerable notoriety by the arrest of such
  an unlikely person as the suspect doctor. The information given to the Press
  was, however, scanty; there was no description of the unfortunate
  German&mdash;merely a comment on his worthy profession, responsible position,
  and his unblemished respectability.</p>

  <p>Belle folded up the paper and smiled&mdash;not one of those elegant and
  artificial smiles, with which she was wont to arm herself against the crowd,
  but an unconscious smile of gratified power, of expectant hope. With an
  instant exercise, however, of her natural strong sense, she checked this
  sensation of hope&mdash;hope of what? She had, really, no prospects of any
  sort. The pantomime would in a few weeks come to an end, and with it her
  meagre livelihood. Perhaps, when the murder of No. 12 was revived in the
  public mind, she would become an object of too much curiosity to be employed
  any longer at the Cambridge. Perhaps, if there was a trial for murder, too
  many unpleasant details as to her companions and her past life would come
  out, for any theatre to employ her ever again.</p>

  <p>She did not know to what uses she could turn the notoriety of having been
  a friend of Daisy Arrow, except those, most vile and base, which were
  completely abhorrent to her; she wanted to climb out of the pit, not sink
  lower. As far as, on logical grounds, the matter could be reasoned out, it
  looked as if her present position as witness in the case, as companion of the
  murdered woman, as an inhabitant of No. 12, would serve rather to thrust her
  further down into that despair from which she had, on Christmas Eve, so
  little hope of escape that she had intended to use on herself the weapon the
  murderer had used on Daisy Arrow.</p>

  <p>Yet, in the mind of this young woman, sitting pale and graceful in her
  shabby clothes in the light of the piece of candle, was this unconquerable
  hope&mdash;that somehow, some way, she would, out of all this tragedy, be
  able to rise into something of the life she had always longed to enjoy.</p>

  <p>It was late at night, she was tired from her work at the theatre, but she
  had no thought of sleep or rest. Rising impatiently and humming, without
  knowing that she did so, the "Moss Rose" waltz half under her breath, she
  went to the carpet-bag, opened it, and took out the Bible with the two
  letters folded inside, and the plume of livid pink feathers with the bird of
  paradise's head as a mount. Slowly, and with great satisfaction, she read
  over the names on the fly-leaf of the Bible, the address and the name on the
  German letter, and Daisy's thick, ugly scrawl.</p>

  <p>"Could I turn these to any use of any sort?" made her quiver with
  excitement. Perhaps she might, in so boldly confronting Mr. Matchwell, have
  convinced that shrewd man that she indeed knew nothing about the affair. She
  had been quite clever, surely, to admit having gone to Roger Owen's house in
  Clerkenwell to see if there were any letters. It had been still cleverer,
  surely, to say there were letters&mdash;that they were from France and of no
  importance and had been destroyed. She had been at pains to assure Roger Owen
  of the same story when she had taken the long, dirty walk to Clerkenwell with
  him to the baker-shop, now kept by his sister, with whom he lodged. She had
  told him that she had found it very painful to keep poor Daisy's letters, so
  she had destroyed them as of no importance at all, "no, none whatever."</p>

  <p>Roger Owen, attracted by her, afraid of her, bewildered by her as before,
  had given her an old-fashioned silver brooch with a swallow scratched on it.
  He said that his sister had worn it as a child, and Belle had accepted the
  trifle graciously. Her impulse had been to throw the scrap of cheap servant's
  finery into the gutter on her way home, but she had refrained with an impulse
  of prudence&mdash;it might be referred to&mdash;it might be necessary to
  produce it in court.</p>

  <p>She returned the German Bible, the plume and the two letters to the
  carpet-bag, and put out her candle. It would have to last her three or four
  nights; she was most desperately poor.</p>

  <p>She did not go to bed nor try to sleep sitting up in her hard chair, but
  remained by the window looking out over the roof-tops and the smoky reddish
  glow in the lower sky from the city lamps. She stared at it until it changed
  into the dirty colour of dawn, all the while pondering, considering
  deeply&mdash;thinking of that man in a cell at Bow Street police station, and
  Mr. Matchwell patiently drawing a net about him&mdash;herself so obscure and
  insignificant, yet with power, perhaps, to open the door of that cell,
  however carefully locked, and break the threads of that net, however finely
  woven.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle waited at Bow Street Station with the other witnesses
who had been
  called to identify Dr. Schoppe, German ship's surgeon, as the companion of
  Daisy Arrow on the last day of her life. There were now others beside those
  already known to Belle&mdash;Arthur Lummin, the thick-set, rough and uneasy
  fruiterer from Covent Garden Market in his workaday clothes&mdash;John
  Garratt, the lean and fatigued waiter in his rusty black from the Argyll
  Rooms, and the inhabitants of No. 12, who might have been supposed to have
  heard the stranger's voice. Other witnesses who had come forward since the
  inquest were a little maid-servant who had been out in that murky dawn of
  Christmas Day cleaning a doorstep a few doors from No. 12, and another
  waiter, a man younger, more alert and superior to John Garratt, who came,
  Belle learned, from Jarvis's Royal Hotel.</p>

  <p>Superintendent Matchwell was present in the bare room, and so prevented
  these people from doing what they so longed to do&mdash;discuss the case.
  Belle sat apart from the others on a separate chair, while they occupied a
  common bench. She had brought with her a small book of French verse and
  affected to be absorbed in its contents; so complete was her air of
  detachment, so coldly indifferent the stare that she turned on Mrs. Bulke and
  the other women who had once resided in No. 12, that they were almost
  persuaded that she was, indeed, what she seemed to wish to appear&mdash;a
  stranger. Even Mrs. Bulke's effrontery sank a little both from the atmosphere
  of the police station and from Belle's cold, reserved manner. After all, what
  had she known of the young actress? She had always kept herself to herself,
  and that she was superior to her companions&mdash;superior in every
  way&mdash;would have been apparent to a fool.</p>

  <p>Mr. Matchwell, walking up and down with his firm, trained step, made a
  little speech to his motley collection of witnesses.</p>

  <p>He reminded them that he was in charge of the case, that it was a
  difficult case, and that there was a great deal of public feeling aroused at
  the arrest of a most respectable man as a suspect murderer; "and I don't wish
  for a moment, ladies and gentlemen, for you to forget that Dr. Schoppe is a
  most respectable man. He has called to his assistance a London lawyer, Mr.
  Peter Thorne, who is a gentleman above suspicion, and it is only fair to say
  that he stakes his reputation on the innocence of Dr. Schoppe, who, it seems,
  is quite well known in London. So," added Mr. Matchwell mildly, looking from
  one to another of those facing him on the bench, "you'll bear that in mind.
  Though we've had all watched, taking our own private steps, and being led, as
  we thought, to the right man, there is always a chance&mdash;and a good
  chance that we were mistaken."</p>

  <p>He glanced at Belle, who had courteously closed her book and listened with
  an air of indifferent attention.</p>

  <p>"And I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, it's not necessary for me to warn
  you&mdash;but at the same time, perhaps, it is only fair that I <i>should</i>
  warn you&mdash;that if anyone should make any mistakes out of excitement or
  forgetfulness, or blinded by the wish to see someone brought to justice for a
  horrid crime, that's liable to cause trouble, and will be found out
  <i>sooner</i> or later&mdash;probably much <i>sooner</i> than later.
  Remember, if this gentleman&mdash;this Dr. Schoppe&mdash;is charged with the
  crime, there will be a long and exhaustive trial when," concluded the
  detective gravely, "all the truth will come out, and false witnesses be shown
  up."</p>

  <p>A little wave of uneasiness passed through the witnesses&mdash;they
  shuffled on the bench, and the two waiters and the fruiterer, the only men of
  the party, were heard to mutter that they really had not seen enough of the
  gentleman&mdash;"not to swear to, as it were."</p>

  <p>At this, Mr. Matchwell, still with an amiable smile, picked up Robert
  Halliday, waiter at Jarvis's Royal Hotel, and reminded him smartly that
  <i>he</i> had opportunity to observe closely&mdash;and must have observed
  closely&mdash;the foreign gentleman who had called at Jarvis's early on
  Christmas morning and ordered breakfast, and asked for turpentine with which
  to rub certain stains off his coat, and who had left behind in the room in
  which he had made his toilet, as a relic of his brief occupation, a large
  linen handkerchief rolled into a ball and completely saturated with blood;
  which handkerchief was then in the possession of the police.</p>

  <p>Robert Halliday, who had come forward with a good deal of eagerness to
  give his testimony, and who had at first declared that he had a tolerably
  shrewd recollection of the mysterious foreigner, both because of the unusual
  day on which he had visited the hotel and the short while he had stayed
  there&mdash;now shuffled and retracted; he said that the morning had been
  dark, he much occupied with permanent guests, and that he had not really paid
  much attention to the gentleman who had sat in a far corner of the
  dining-room some distance from the gas-lamp, which it had been necessary to
  light on Christmas Day.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me, Mr. Halliday," said the superintendent mildly, "that
  you'll be rather an unreliable witness, and I still think it's an odd
  thing&mdash;and an unexplained thing&mdash;that you didn't come forward at
  the inquest." At which Mr. Halliday protested, as he had protested before,
  that that very Christmas Day he had been taken ill and shivery with a sore
  throat and had remained in bed at home until a day or two ago, and so had not
  heard of the crime, he being too heavy-headed to read the papers and his
  missus not liking horrors.</p>

  <p>Belle listened curiously to this little dialogue. She felt an odd harsh
  dislike of her companions, especially of the women, raddled, florid, drab,
  defiant and sullen in expression; the faces of the men&mdash;coarse-featured,
  uneasy, vapid, also filled her with disgust. She dropped her glance and gazed
  on to her book.</p>

  <p>When they were all summoned to another room she walked behind the others,
  elegantly holding up the edges of her miserable flounces from the soiled
  boards of the corridor.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">There was a high-set window in the room, through which the
voices of the
  people in the next apartment floated plainly.</p>

  <p>"The prisoner is in there," whispered Mr. Matchwell; "you will hear him
  speak&mdash;listen carefully and hear if any of you recognise his voice.
  Remember," added the superintendent sternly, "how much depends on this."</p>

  <p>"And little reliance you'll give to any of us, I suppose, unless it suits
  you," muttered Mrs. Bulke insolently.</p>

  <p>Belle stepped up to the detective, and speaking to him as if they were
  equals in authority and intelligence and the others vastly inferior, she
  whispered:</p>

  <p>"Would not emotion, fear, and agitation, and indignation much alter a
  voice, Mr. Matchwell?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe, ma'am, but the gentleman is quite calm now; he certainly has been
  furious&mdash;almost beside himself. But he has his own lawyer and has sent
  for two of his friends, and he is perfectly satisfied that he will be able to
  prove himself innocent."</p>

  <p>Through the high-placed aperture came the sound of two voices speaking in
  German&mdash;talking together as if under some constraint. Then one voice
  ceased and the other continued&mdash;smooth, voluble, with a slightly
  monotonous rise and fall in cadence.</p>

  <p>The witnesses glanced at each other and at Mr. Matchwell, who nodded
  shrewdly. They shook their heads, compressed their mouths, shut their lips,
  and considered each other's expressions.</p>

  <p>The women were the first to speak. They all agreed, in tones half nervous
  and half disappointed, "that it wasn't the voice, no, not that they could
  remember."</p>

  <p>Mr. Matchwell turned to Belle. She knew that he could place more reliance
  on her than on all the others put together. She was supposed to have heard
  the voice twice&mdash;once down the short kitchen stairs, and once through
  the thin wall of her bedroom. She shook her head and declared precisely:</p>

  <p>"No, that is not the voice."</p>

  <p>"You can be quite sure of that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think&mdash;quite sure."</p>

  <p>"Listen again," said Mr. Matchwell, without any sign of either
  satisfaction or regret. "I've arranged with Sergeant Harris to get <i>him</i>
  to speak English. He does&mdash;excellently."</p>

  <p>The flow of German words was checked. They could hear the robust tones of
  the policeman, the lighter tones of the English lawyer, then the voice that
  had spoken German saying in English:</p>

  <p>"Yes, I shall speak your language if you desire. I can do so quite well,
  though I am not so proficient as once I was. Will you please let the Consul
  come to me and my friends&mdash;those two friends whom from the first I have
  asked for&mdash;the pastor, Herr Morl, and Herr Leutner?"</p>

  <p>The voice ran on fluently in the foreign language, the accent becoming
  more emphatic, the tone more raised and harsh.</p>

  <p>But the witnesses in the little bare room again shook their heads. It was
  odd how cautious they seemed in committing themselves, and how they, usually
  so fond of sensation, appeared to dislike their parts. With a certain
  reluctance they wished to be rid of the whole affair. They coughed, and
  shrugged, and shuffled, and muttered:</p>

  <p>"No, that wasn't the voice&mdash;not as far as they knew&mdash;not as far
  as they could remember."</p>

  <p>Again Mr. Matchwell glanced at Belle, and she said, with a look that
  assured him he could trust her recollection:</p>

  <p>"No, that was not the voice."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The witnesses were taken into the yard, which was high-
walled, bleak and
  grey, cut out, a square of open, paved space in the midst of a huddle of
  houses with roofs sloping at different angles and chimney-pots of different
  heights, with odd-shaped cowls and hoods spinning in the wind and above all,
  a sky the colour of vinegar and ashes, from which a few flakes of snow were
  falling. In their unsuitable finery the women hunched their shoulders
  sullenly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Matchwell bade them all observe a procession that would soon come
  through the door opposite. He had scarcely spoken before this was opened and
  ten men, walking close together, entered the yard, of whom only
  one&mdash;Sergeant Harris, who was assisting Superintendent Matchwell in the
  investigation of the case&mdash;was known to the witnesses. The others were
  all well-dressed and of various ages and complexions.</p>

  <p>Belle raised her veil and stared at the nine strangers with an intense
  curiosity that caused her to forget her companions and almost her
  surroundings; a curiosity which rendered her oblivious to the piercing
  cold&mdash;for the east wind had penetrated her thin shawl and the damp of
  the flag-stones had penetrated her thin shoes.</p>

  <p>When she had stared with darting keenness in turn at each of the nine men
  as they paraded across the yard, she heaved a deep sigh, bit her lips, and
  looked down. It was only then that, her own immediate curiosity satisfied,
  she glanced at her companions. They, too, had been curious; a certain
  excitement had made them forgetful of their own uneasiness and their mistrust
  of the police. The women pried with inquisitive, hard, malicious glances at
  the nine men.</p>

  <p>Belle wondered why they had been brought into the yard. Not one of them
  confessed to having seen Daisy Arrow's companion. Perhaps Mr. Matchwell
  believed that amid all these unreliable characters there was one who was
  lying, and that she might be startled into some kind of recognition. It would
  have been quite natural, of course, if Mrs. Bulke, or Florrie, or Moll, the
  servant, or May, had seen Daisy Arrow's companion, and quite natural, too,
  that she should, to save herself trouble, deny having done so. "If he thinks
  that, he's fairly shrewd," thought Belle, smiling, "but it's at them he's
  looking&mdash;not at me."</p>

  <p>She lowered her veil again, and with an almost imperceptible signal
  passing between the detective and Sergeant Harris, the ten men left the
  yard.</p>

  <p>Neither of the two waiters, the fruiterer, nor the little servant girl,
  Annie Western, who had been cleaning steps in Great Hogarth Street early that
  Christmas morning, could identify the glimpsed foreigner with any of those
  whom they had seen parade in Bow Street police courtyard. They all agreed
  that there was not one gentleman in the least like the personage whom they
  had noticed. No, not even allowing for the fog, their bad memories, and the
  little importance they had attached to the stranger's appearance at the time.
  There wasn't one there that fitted the description, and it was clearly to be
  observed that they were, indeed, all "at sea" because when they fell to
  talking to themselves&mdash;as Mr. Matchwell allowed them to talk&mdash;first
  this man and then that, out of the nine, was opined to be the suspected
  German.</p>

  <p>The detective then, not in the least disconcerted, informed them:</p>

  <p>"You're all wrong, and it looks rather as if we were wrong too. The
  German, Dr. Schoppe, was the tall, stoutish man with a ginger greyish
  whisker, in the blue overcoat, who stood at the end of the line."</p>

  <p>Genuine stupid amazement showed in the faces of most of the witnesses. It
  was clear that not one of them had even imagined the supposed murderer like
  that&mdash;a stoutish, fatherly-looking gentleman of fifty-five or more, with
  grey whiskers.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bulke, gaining confidence, smiled her derision. She was now quite
  sure that the voice she had heard coming down the kitchen stairs had been
  different&mdash;a younger, lighter voice.</p>

  <p>Annie Western, the little maidservant, was also quite sure that the
  gentleman she had seen hurrying in the murky light down the steps of No. 12
  and disappearing up the street towards the square, had been not in the least
  like any of the gentlemen who had just walked across the yard. No, younger,
  taller&mdash;dark, too, she was certain.</p>

  <p>Mr. Robert Halliday, the waiter from Jarvis's Hotel, could also be quite
  positive, however imperfect his recollection of the stranger who had visited
  the hotel on Christmas Day was, that he had been quite a different sort of
  gentleman from any he had just seen. Certainly not a stout gentleman with
  grey whiskers.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle followed Mr. Matchwell into the police station. She
longed to
  question him as to what would be his immediate action&mdash;what course the
  case would take now? She knew that to do this would be a display of weakness
  and folly, so she remained silent, her fingers tightly clasped round the
  little book of French verse.</p>

  <p>She supposed she was not wanted any more, and would be allowed to depart
  without any questions. She did not want to do this. There was excitement to
  her in the drab and ugly atmosphere of the police station, in the rooms with
  the stucco walls, the plaster busts of Justice and The Sovereign, the
  spittoon on the floor, and the flagging fires in the narrow iron grate. So
  she hesitated, pretending to adjust slowly her shawl, which had slipped down,
  to brush the wet stains left by melting snowflakes off her shabby skirt.</p>

  <p>Moll, the little servant from No. 12, lingered beside her. The girl was
  under-clad, and tried to warm herself at the small reluctant flame.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad they didn't find him, aren't you, miss?" she said shivering. "I
  don't want to think of anyone being hanged&mdash;not for the sake of a poor
  thing like Daisy Arrow."</p>

  <p>"Don't you?" asked Belle, with her clear cold stare into the child's
  feeble face. "You don't want to see the horrible murderer&mdash;one who could
  do so atrocious a deed&mdash;punished?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," asserted Moll obstinately, shaking her tousled head in the
  broken bonnet. "I don't want to see no more punishment as long as I live,
  that I don't. I've seen enough already, that I have."</p>

  <p>As Mr. Matchwell entered the room, Belle replied in a slightly raised
  voice:</p>

  <p>"Surely, Molly, however tender-hearted you are, you would wish there to be
  punishment in this case for a crime so unprovoked, so hideous?"</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," maintained the little servant obstinately. "We
  don't know what there was between them, do we? She wasn't no good, that Daisy
  Arrow. She was sly and don't I know it&mdash;one who pretended to forget
  things and then hold them over you. She may have driven him to it, that she
  may." Belle drew away from the fire. "Well, I suppose I'll have to go back.
  It's been a short holiday, hasn't it?" She paused suddenly&mdash;jerked back
  her head, and an expression of horror came over her thin chilled features.
  "Why, who's that speaking?"</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of voices outside. The girl appeared to be listening
  intently. "Why, isn't that&mdash;" The words trailed off, she put her dirty
  fingers to her lips. But Mr. Matchwell had heard, had seen.</p>

  <p>"Do you recognise the voice, miss?"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" exclaimed Moll suddenly.</p>

  <p>"You'd better be careful," warned Mr. Matchwell sternly.</p>

  <p>"But how could I have heard him?" pleaded Moll miserably. "How could I,
  sir? When everyone said that he wasn't there? Them as have seen him said he
  wasn't there!"</p>

  <p>"Would you," asked Belle sharply, "know that voice again, Moll?"</p>

  <p>"No, miss, that I shouldn't."</p>

  <p>The girl still seemed deeply alarmed. She gathered her shawl round the
  base of her throat and turned as if to make a quick running exit from the
  police station.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Matchwell had her by the thin arm. "I daresay it was only fancy,"
  he admitted coolly, "but we'd better investigate."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Dr. Schoppe and two of his friends who had been his
companions on the
  German steamer <i>Der König von Bayern</i>, passed down the corridor of the
  police station. A few paces behind them was the English lawyer, Peter Thorne,
  and the German Consul. They turned to the head of the stairs which led to the
  cells, where the doctor, who was protesting deeply but in a firm controlled
  voice against this insufferable indignity, was to be confined. They met Mr.
  Matchwell and some of his witnesses&mdash;the waiter from "Jarvis's," the
  servant girl from Great Hogarth Street. Robert Halliday exclaimed
  instantly:</p>

  <p>"That's him, or his twin brother."</p>

  <p>"Hush," said Mr. Matchwell, sternly. "Hush."</p>

  <p>The little party disappeared into the cell and the detective asked the
  waiter:</p>

  <p>"Now please, explain."</p>

  <p>"That's him," gasped Robert Halliday in a lower and awed tone, "I
  recognise him at once. Funny, that is&mdash;though you don't think you
  remember a person, you find you do when you see 'em again. The tall young
  good-looking gent with the dark overcoat and a scarf right up to his neck.
  Yes, I remember that. He had that silk kerchief that comes right up under his
  ears, but his coat was light. What with that muffling and his face being so
  pale, I thought he seemed like one who'd had his throat cut himself. That I
  did."</p>

  <p>"We don't want none of these silly fancies," rebuked Mr. Matchwell
  sternly. He glanced over his shoulders at the other witnesses who had been
  behind him and who had come to a stop when he and the waiter had blocked the
  way. "Any of <i>you</i> see anyone you recognised, or thought you recognised,
  among them gentlemen following Sergeant Harris who has just gone below?"</p>

  <p>The waiter from the Argyll Rooms, who looked pasty and overthrown&mdash;as
  if a horror had suddenly passed his path, stammered:</p>

  <p>"That was he-the tall one&mdash;him walking on the far side of the doctor
  what you thought did it."</p>

  <p>Annie Western broke in to confirm this:</p>

  <p>"He's right, I'd know him," she said, "anywhere&mdash;from the way he has
  of walking&mdash;upright and his shoulders back." She glanced defiantly at
  Moll, who was weeping into the corner of her shawl. "She knew his voice too.
  She tried to keep it back but she couldn't. <i>She</i> heard it all
  right."</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't," sobbed Moll. "I don't want no one punished for nothing, I
  don't."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Dr. Schoppe and his two friends, who had arrived at the
police station
  five minutes before to visit him, having come by train straight from <i>Der
  König von Bayern</i>, then at Ramsgate Harbour, were brought up from the
  cells, and bewildered and on guard, though resolute, confronted with Mr.
  Matchwell's witnesses, who crowded the small antechamber to the
  police-court.</p>

  <p>Belle scarcely glanced at Dr. Schoppe nor at one of his companions&mdash;a
  man about his own age and something of his complexion, pompously dressed and
  agitated in manner Her glance fell long and searchingly on the third
  foreigner&mdash;a tall, dark young man, in a black overcoat, who stood with
  his hat in his hand and stared about him as if utterly uncomprehending the
  scene or the circumstance.</p>

  <p>It was to this young man that four of the witnesses severally and with
  deliberation pointed&mdash;the fruiterer, the two waiters, and Annie Western.
  "He was," they declared, each with a kind of trembling agitation, as if
  horror-struck at being brought so close to anything so wicked, "the man who
  had been Daisy Arrow's companion at the Argyll Rooms, who had walked up and
  down in the fog whilst she bought the fruit from Covent Garden late on
  Christmas Eve, who had left No. 12 early on Christmas morning, slamming the
  door behind him and hurrying into the yellow mist towards the Square, and who
  had gone to Jarvis's Royal Hotel, asking for breakfast and turpentine to take
  the stains off his coat, and who had left Jarvis's Hotel, having flung down
  in the corner of the room he had so briefly hired a handkerchief soaked with
  blood."</p>

  <p>Mr. Matchwell turned briskly to the accused man:</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, what have you got to say to this? Speak, sir, speak."</p>

  <p>At this, the young man, glancing round the ring of faces, every one of
  which was gazing at him with hostility, with astonishment, with avid
  curiosity, stammered in English:</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand at all, and I don't know anything about it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Matchwell, raising his eyes, glanced at Belle. "Do you know the voice,
  miss?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "It doesn't sound to me in the least the same. Of
  course, I may be mistaken."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the detective quietly, "I think it's good enough without
  that." He nodded at Sergeant Harris. "You can release Dr. Schoppe, Sergeant,
  and arrest this gentleman. Who is he, by the by?"</p>

  <p>Upon this Dr. Schoppe exclaimed in a voice shrill with indignation and
  bewilderment:</p>

  <p>"He's a pastor, the Rev. Maarten Morl, the chaplain from the steamer. You
  must all be mad&mdash;mad, I say. What have you to go on but the paper?
  Anyone might have dropped that."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle noticed eagerly the surges of public opinion about
the Daisy Arrow
  murder, that had suddenly become of such newspaper importance and a topic of
  conversation in so many different circles of society. Although the reporters
  were confined to a mere turning over of known facts and a mere re-hashing of
  harmless suppositions, the tongues of the public were free and bold in their
  comments. Some thought that the police had, with rare skill and cunning,
  caught the murderer with praiseworthy speed. Others said that it was an
  outrage even to suspect a respectable member of the same nation as that to
  which The Royal House belonged, one which was so favoured by Sacred Majesty's
  regard, so popular and respected in every walk of life. A German, a
  clergyman, a man of unblemished character! It seemed fantastic to connect
  such a person, even remotely, with so sordid a crime. How could the
  witnesses, poor, illiterate, by their own confession unobservant and
  careless, identify a man whom they had seen so briefly, and through a fog or
  in a dark corner or muffled up? Anyone could have lost the scrap of
  note-paper.</p>

  <p>In the opinion of these defenders of Pastor Morl, the case seemed to fall
  to pieces before it had begun.</p>

  <p>But in the opinion of a great many other people, it was considered very
  strange that four independent people should have picked out this young man
  when they had completely failed to identify his companion, Dr. Schoppe, who
  had been first arrested for the crime.</p>

  <p>It looked, too, as if, although the police were on the wrong trail, they
  had been on a trail very near the right one. The murderer had come from the
  suspect's ship. He had been his companion, they had been about London
  together. It was quite natural that the police should make this
  mistake&mdash;they had been so nearly right. The note-paper was, surely, a
  definite clue.</p>

  <p>As for the crime being motiveless and it being ludicrous to associate such
  a man with such a deed, those who believed in the guilt of Pastor Morl were
  not shaken by these difficulties. Who knew what story was behind the events
  of Christmas Eve? Who could tell what might not be elicited at the trial?
  Many a man with a smooth face and decent character and good manners had been
  discovered to be a criminal.</p>

  <p>Belle went her way discreetly, listening wherever she could listen to
  these conflicting ideas and various opinions. Although she was herself the
  centre of much curiosity as being so closely connected with the crime, she
  continued to preserve her air of detachment, to hold herself aloof from the
  whole ugly business, and every night she danced at the Cambridge the dainty
  <i>pas seul</i> of the "Moss Rose" waltz.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Two days after his arrest Pastor Morl was charged at Bow
Street before the
  magistrate, Mr. Miles Clinner, with the murder of Martha Owen on the night of
  the 24th of December, and was remanded for a week, leaving public curiosity,
  as it were, to hang in space, and public fantasy to hint in darkness.</p>

  <p>The prisoner had made but a moment's appearance in the dock at Bow Street.
  The eager spectators who had crowded the court had had only a glimpse of a
  tall, young foreigner who, it was obvious, kept his face, with an effort,
  expressionless, who was well-dressed and well-barbered, and who possessed, as
  was instantly noticed by everyone present, that peculiar, almost indefinable
  type of comeliness known as romantic good looks.</p>

  <p>Belle had been present. She had studied the prisoner's pale, composed
  countenance&mdash;unnaturally pale and unnaturally composed&mdash;with an
  even deeper zest than that felt by her companions. She had marked every line
  and shadow in those lineaments, as she had been used to mark every line and
  shadow in a face that she had intended to paint, in the days when she had
  exercised her small talent of draughtsmanship.</p>

  <p>Minnie Palmer edged next to her in the crowd as the spectators of this
  prelude to drama, their appetites whetted, swarmed out into the wet
  street:</p>

  <p>"He seems to feel his position, don't he, dearie? Looks as if he were dead
  already, but they go purple in the face, don't they&mdash;not yellow like he
  was?"</p>

  <p>"You'd look yellow yourself, Minnie, if you were standing up there," said
  Belle dryly.</p>

  <p>"I don't see that that's any sign of his guilt nor of his innocence
  either," laughed the other young woman. "A queer thing, isn't it? We was all
  thinking how we'd like to meet a real gentleman, and poor Daisy did&mdash;and
  that's what happened to her."</p>

  <p>"He's not condemned yet," Belle reminded her. "I don't think the evidence
  against him is very strong. As far as it goes with me, I'm sure it wasn't his
  voice I heard."</p>

  <p>"Don't you be too sure, my pet. I wish I'd been there," Minnie Palmer
  replied with jealousy, "then I'd have been a more important witness. I don't
  know if they will call me at all. I can't say anything except that Daisy
  turned up at the Cambridge and was after you. That's not of much
  importance."</p>

  <p>"Not of any importance in the least," smiled Belle.</p>

  <p>She conquered, for her own ends, her distaste for the other young woman's
  company as they separated from the crowd, and passed with her along the front
  of Covent Garden Market, the two women treading cautiously their worn,
  half-broken shoes among the rotting cabbage-stumps and fallen leaves from
  winter vegetables.</p>

  <p>"Oh my," said Minnie with a shudder, "it must have been somewhere round
  here she walked with him. It's not very nice to think of, is it? It do make
  one careful, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, as it has happened so recently, I suppose it's not likely to happen
  again," smiled Belle. "Not just yet."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," said Minnie. "There was that young Jewess in the
  Tottenham Court Road&mdash;that's not so long ago, is it? They never found
  <i>that</i> fellow. They say that the girl always gets killed because of
  jealousy or money. It couldn't have been either in this case, could it? How
  could he have been jealous of her when he had only been in London a day? He
  couldn't have seen her before they had met at the Argyll Rooms," added Minnie
  uneasily, pulling her jacket together at her throat, "and as for money, he
  must get more in a week than Daisy ever 'ad in a month. Besides, her things
  wasn't touched. I wonder what's become of them?" she added reflectively.
  "There was a brooch or two I'd have liked."</p>

  <p>"The police have got them," said Belle. "Would you really have liked them,
  Minnie Palmer, liked to have worn some of poor Daisy Arrow's glass brooches
  and tinfoil bangles?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know. You needn't get so bitter about it. Live and let live,
  I say. Probably she'd have been glad for me to have them. People seem to
  think the right man's been caught&mdash;they think the police have been very
  clever. Lord, don't it make you shudder&mdash;to think of a nice-looking
  young gentleman like that!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think he did it," said Belle quickly and smoothly. "But you can't
  judge by the look of people. It's the crime of a madman, that is what I
  think&mdash;yes, a madman. You can't always tell them, you know, Detective
  Matchwell told me that himself. The police often have to deal with crimes
  committed by madmen. They're, curiously enough, generally the people who get
  away."</p>

  <p>"Well," smiled Minnie Palmer, "I hope this one hasn't got away. I hope
  that's the murderer they <i>have</i> got safe in a Bow Street cell. It makes
  you nervous who you speak to late at night. I don't like the place where I am
  much in Hare Street. Couldn't I come and live with you, dearie? Haven't you
  got room for me, or couldn't you find some place near you?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Belle decidedly. "When the trial's over (I don't suppose it'll
  take long), I shall leave London. I'm going on tour, and the room that I have
  is very small."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you don't want my company, I can see! Well, goodbye, dearie. See you
  at the theatre to-night. It's been what I call a nasty piece of
  business."</p>

  <p>Until Minnie Palmer was out of sight, Belle continued to walk in the
  direction of her own lodging in Holborn; but as soon as the other young
  woman's faded shawl and broken yellow feather had disappeared round the
  corner of the street, Belle came to a pause and took her bearings
  thoughtfully; she had gone deliberately out of her way to accompany Minnie
  Palmer. She had wanted to hear what that foolish, lively young woman still
  thought of the case, for, no doubt, her opinion would be the same as that of
  many other silly people, and it was as well to know the general
  impression.</p>

  <p>After a brief hesitancy, Belle turned resolutely away from the direction
  of Holborn and down towards the Strand. She never paused in her swift walk,
  to which her erect carriage and the elegancy with which she wore her poor
  clothes, gave an obstinate grace, till she came to a small private hotel in
  Norfolk Street. There she asked boldly, casually, for Dr. Schoppe. The
  porter, hardly waiting for the words to be out of her mouth, told her that
  the doctor, who had just returned from Bow Street police station in a hackney
  cab, would not see anyone except chosen friends.</p>

  <p>"Don't you suppose I might be one of those, as I know the address?" said
  Belle quietly. She saw the man hesitate, a little confused at the jar between
  her clothes and her manner. "Give me," she said, "a paper and pencil."</p>

  <p>When he had reluctantly handed a scrap of paper to her, she wrote on it:
  "Please see me. It's very important with regard to your friend, the Reverend
  Maarten Morl." With an air of authority she gave the paper to the porter, and
  passing him briskly, took a seat on the chair beneath the polished clock in
  the hall. It was a neat, respectable place, frequented by foreigners of the
  better sort. Belle's nostrils dilated; she liked the smell of cleanliness;
  her eyes sparkled; she liked the polish on the stair-rail and the stair edge;
  she liked the gleaming veneer of the clock, the neat quiet dial; everything
  about the place was so orderly, so decent.</p>

  <p>The porter gave the note to a waiter who emerged from the side-door, and
  returned to his own post at the entrance, but not without a furtive,
  half-suspicious glance at Belle.</p>

  <p>In a moment or two he returned and asked Belle to follow him. He ushered
  her upstairs to a pleasant parlour on the first floor, furnished with
  conventional comforts and lit by the steady blaze of a large fire.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of this fire, his hands clasped behind his coat and with
  an anxious frown on his broad face, was the bald, stoutish, florid gentleman
  with the grey whiskers whom Belle had first seen in the yard of Bow Street
  police court. He recognised her at once as one of that (to him) strange and
  horrible group of people who, with craning necks and prying eyes, had tried
  to identify him on that bleak snowy day last week as a murderer.</p>

  <p>"What can you have to say, madame?" he began in his strong emphatic
  English. "I do not know why I see you, but I cling to every hope."</p>

  <p>As Belle did not immediately answer, but stood looking at him, patiently
  smiling, as if to impress on him her personality, he added with a deepening
  suspicion:</p>

  <p>"I would be much tormented with people, but no one knows I'm here: I and
  Herr Leutner, we live here quietly till this terrible thing is over."</p>

  <p>"So I can understand."</p>

  <p>"I don't know how you got my address, madame."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I took means to find out," said Belle. "You see I think what I have
  to say is rather important. Will you give me perhaps ten minutes of your
  time?"</p>

  <p>"If you wish," pleaded the harassed doctor, impressed, despite himself, by
  this strange woman in her shabby and entirely decorous attire, with her
  out-of-place elegance. She was in her simplicity, without a single gawdy
  ornament&mdash;without a touch of rouge or powder&mdash;entirely different
  from what he, Dr. Schoppe, supposed she was, from what he supposed she must
  be&mdash;a companion of the infamous Daisy Arrow, living in that disreputable
  house where the unaccountable crime that had suddenly shattered all his
  compact little world had occurred.</p>

  <p>"Please seat yourself, madame," he said, then checked himself, for it
  occurred to him through his pain and bewilderment, that here possibly was an
  ally, someone who really might be useful; though he supposed that the English
  police would not allow him to see this woman if they knew of it. Wouldn't it
  be called "tampering with witnesses?" He knew that she had been called at the
  inquest&mdash;he knew she had occupied the room next to that in which Daisy
  Arrow had slept.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell abruptly and, when the waiter came, ordered cakes and
  coffee.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Belle. "I am, indeed, cold and hungry."</p>

  <p>"This refreshment need not delay our talk."</p>

  <p>"Before it comes, let me tell you that I was rather fond of poor Daisy
  Arrow. She was only a little servant girl, you know, but unusually pretty and
  refined for her class. And that's what led her astray. I daresay you have
  read all that came out in the inquest."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I have read the newspapers, all that at the inquest was said I
  have read. But what has that to do with me or this wretched woman&mdash;it is
  my young friend of whom I have to think. It is, too, a little of myself,
  since I was arrested for something so horrible and so strange." Then a sudden
  recollection came into his agitated mind and he demanded quickly: "So, you
  did not identify the voice, is not that it? One did&mdash;the miserable
  little servant, I think&mdash;but you, no?"</p>

  <p>Belle looked at him directly.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't quite sure about the voice," she said in a loud tone. "It might
  come back to me in one way or another. I might, when I came to be examined,
  say that I remembered it or that I didn't remember it. Do you understand, Dr.
  Schoppe?"</p>

  <p>The waiter entered with the refreshments on a tray, and Belle rose with
  the air of an accomplished hostess and began to pour out the coffee and to
  arrange the cakes on the little blue china plates.</p>

  <p>Dr. Schoppe stared at her. His hands had now come from behind his back and
  his thumbs were stuck in the armholes of his brightly-coloured waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"So," he said, breathing rather quickly. "So."</p>

  <p>"I am in a very peculiar position and all the notoriety this trial will
  give me is very hateful to me, Dr. Schoppe," said Belle, handing him a cup of
  coffee and the little plate of cakes, as if she were the one who was
  dispensing hospitality. "I am an actress&mdash;one who has not been
  successful. You could see that by my attire. I hope there is something else,
  Dr. Schoppe, that you can see from my attire also, and that is," said Belle
  Adair deliberately, "that I am not the kind of woman that Daisy Arrow
  was&mdash;not the kind of woman that her companions are. I didn't know what
  manner of house I had got into. I had been there only a few weeks. I have had
  great misfortune."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said the German uneasily, eyeing her with suspicion and, as
  she thought, alarm.</p>

  <p>"Why trouble you with all that, you will think. We have come into touch
  with one another in the strangest possible way."</p>

  <p>"It is more than strange, it is monstrous," put in the doctor angrily. "My
  young friend, that young clergyman-why, it is absurd! I cannot understand
  your police, I cannot understand the imbecile witnesses. Never mind&mdash;he
  will be acquitted."</p>

  <p>"Will he?" said Belle. "Funny about the note-paper."</p>

  <p>Dr. Schoppe broke into German in his emphatic assertion of his friend's
  innocence, and Belle replied in the same language:</p>

  <p>"You can speak German if you like, Dr. Schoppe; I know the language quite
  well, we had a German governess. I was at school in Switzerland and
  afterwards in Germany I remember the woods and how we used to enjoy the
  picnics there."</p>

  <p>He seemed startled, and with added respect said, half awkwardly, also in
  German:</p>

  <p>"Ah, madame, that would be a relief to me. Though I know your language
  well, my own at such a moment as this comes, of course, more easily. So, you
  speak German. I could see you were a gentlewoman."</p>

  <p>"Thank you." Belle bent her head. "I shall be a little rusty in your
  language, but I can make myself understood."</p>

  <p>"Well, madame, what do you want me to understand?"</p>

  <p>With a trembling hand Dr. Schoppe seized the cup, threw the coffee down
  his throat, and held the cup out for her to refill it, which she did, with a
  gracious look and gesture.</p>

  <p>"I am in very low water," said Belle, "very low indeed. I'm like one on
  the edge of a morass, in fact I should say one about whom the morass already
  sucks. On Christmas Eve I was thinking of death, not of the death of Daisy
  Arrow, but of myself. I wanted to die because everything around me was so
  degraded and so miserable, and I saw no way out. You can understand?"</p>

  <p>"I am a medical man I am not a young man either. I know the world."</p>

  <p>"Well then, I daresay you've often heard of women like myself who have
  committed suicide in despair. Such was my position on Christmas Eve. My real
  name, of course, is not that absurd one of Belle Adair. The coroner was kind
  enough not to force me to disclose myself. Oh, I'm not a person of any
  importance. But there are people who might be hurt if they knew who I
  am."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," said the doctor with a trembling, badly-controlled
  impatience. "You have all my sympathy, madame, and you excite my interest.
  But what has this to do with my poor friend, who must come first?"</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry for him, I hope he will be acquitted. It will help him,
  of course, if I can't identify the voice."</p>

  <p>"But I think you have already said, madame, that you do not identify the
  voice."</p>

  <p>She looked at him, smiled, and with an air of cool ease, said:</p>

  <p>"It is very near to your heart to have your friend acquitted, Dr.
  Schoppe?"</p>

  <p>"My God, yes, for very many reasons," he declared, eyeing her from under
  his thick brows.</p>

  <p>"And it is very near my heart, sir, for very many reasons, to rise from
  where I have fallen. I am earning thirty shillings a week at present, playing
  at the Cambridge Music Hall. I do a dance in the pantomime 'Puss in Boots,'
  Moss Rose. I daresay you have heard the tune. A waltz."</p>

  <p>"Come to the point, madame," entreated Dr. Schoppe, with considerable
  agitation. "I have so little time that is my own. I must see my lawyer this
  morning&mdash;all my affairs are upset."</p>

  <p>"I understand. I am nearly at an end. It seemed to me that we might help
  one another&mdash;that I might be of assistance to your friend who is in such
  desperate need."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the stout German, smiling and peering nervously at her.
  "Yes."</p>

  <p>"When I go into the witness-box I should like to be dressed like a decent
  woman&mdash;not in these turned-about clothes which make people stare at me.
  I am trying to leave Mrs. Bulke and her young women, and all that they stood
  for; I want to get away. You understand? It's that or death for me. It's
  release or death, Dr. Schoppe," she added quietly, with a smile on her thin
  lips, "just as it's release or death for your young friend at Bow
  Street."</p>

  <p>"Death! Don't say that, madame!"</p>

  <p>"I do say it&mdash;and I mean it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily; there was, she was sure, little need for more
  words; this experienced man understood desperation, determination, when he
  saw them.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"A few pounds. Lend me five pounds, please, Dr. Schoppe, then I shall be
  independent. There is only one way by which a woman situated as I am could
  earn money and I don't want to take that way." Her smile deepened. "I daresay
  you think it odd that I should be so fastidious. One is. It is more a matter
  of nerves than morals. I wasn't born a&mdash;the kind of woman that Daisy
  Arrow was." She marked his hesitation, and it occurred to her that he
  suspected her of being a police spy, sent to trap him into the indiscretion
  of bribery. "Let me assure you, Dr. Schoppe, that I am in no one's pay. I've
  come to you for the money because I thought you were the only person who
  would have it and who would be likely to give it to me. I daresay you've
  often heard this story before from destitute people who want to make a fresh
  start, but this time it happens to be true; besides," she added, "it also
  happens that this destitute wretch"&mdash;she drew her breath with such
  vehemence, such passion that he was startled&mdash;"this wretched creature
  who seems quite lost and has no one to whom she can turn, might do you a
  service."</p>

  <p>The doctor looked at her keenly and his eyes dropped. He fetched out a
  pocket-book&mdash;a purse, then awkwardly and slowly counted out five
  sovereigns and laid them beside the coffee tray.</p>

  <p>"You are ashamed of this transaction, are you not? And so am I," said
  Belle, "as I have been ashamed so often before. You need not be afraid, I
  came here quite openly&mdash;the porter and the waiter saw me, I daresay the
  police did too&mdash;I think they watch me. Everyone knows who I am, or soon
  will. You can tell them that I came to you in great distress, to assure you,
  Dr. Schoppe, that I did not recognise the voice of your friend."</p>

  <p>He began muttering excuses for his own behaviour, which he seemed to feel
  was weak and stupid.</p>

  <p>"There is more in this than you think, for me, madame. Herr Morl and I
  were&mdash;are&mdash;engaged in an enterprise together that seemed truly
  blessed. I am a religious man. I look, in all I do, for the hand of God."</p>

  <p>"I, too, have looked for that, often enough, Dr. Schoppe."</p>

  <p>"Have you?" He peered at her, fumbled his spectacles out of his pocket,
  put them on, and gazed at her sadly. "It seems a pity that you
  have&mdash;must have&mdash;made some great mistake."</p>

  <p>"Several," admitted Belle insolently. "But, after all, my situation is
  better than that of your friend, who only a short time ago seemed so safe and
  happy."</p>

  <p>"The ways of the Lord are inscrutable," muttered Dr. Schoppe uneasily.</p>

  <p>"You are fortunate that you can drug yourself with commonplace nonsense,"
  smiled Belle. She picked up the sovereigns, slipped them into her tattered
  reticule and pulled down her veil with a swiftness that made the two
  movements into one, then left the room before the German could speak
  again.</p>

  <p>Belle went out swiftly into the narrow street and the winter air. It was a
  fine day and the winter fog seemed lifted at last. Large white clouds were
  flowing up along the river from the sea; they raced overhead, first
  obscuring, then revealing the pale cold gloom of the pallid sky.</p>

  <p>Belle felt exhilarated by success. Five pounds, easily obtained! It was
  worth far more than mere money to her, for with it she could buy, by using
  great economy and visiting a second-hand shop of the better-class that she
  knew of, a suit of decent clothes that was necessary to her for the part she
  had set herself to play.</p>

  <p>She returned to her little room threw herself on the bed and rested, her
  eyes closed and her mind racing wildly. Then she rose up suddenly, went to
  the carpetbag, opened it, and counted over her treasures: the soiled livid
  pink feather, the little German Bible, the two dirty letters.</p>

  <p>Who would be startled, who would be shocked into utmost horror, were she
  to appear in the witness-box wearing those gay, dirty plumes? Who would know
  where to look on the breast of the bird of paradise for the dark stain that
  clotted the fine feathers together? And if, when she was asked to swear, to
  speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, she rejected the
  thumbed and dirty Testament offered her by the clerk of the court and in
  place of that, if she were to take this thick small Bible from her bag and
  say: "No, on this I swear," who there would be shocked and startled, maybe,
  into a shrieking confession?</p>

  <p>Smiling, she returned her treasures cautiously to the carpetbag, which she
  kept under the bed. Always, when she went out, she locked her room and took
  the key with her. She lit a candle, then seated herself at the bare, stained
  deal table, took a pencil and a sheet of paper from the drawer with the white
  china handle, that was so stiff to pull out and so hard to push back, and
  began to draw a face&mdash;a face startled&mdash;a face composed&mdash;a face
  staring&mdash;a face glancing down&mdash;never a face smiling&mdash;and
  always the same face.</p>

  <p>When she was satisfied that she had achieved a good likeness, she leant
  back in her chair with her head on one side, and surveyed her handiwork with
  a smile.</p>

  <p>She then tore up the piece of paper into tiny fragments and threw them on
  to the narrow iron grate where a tiny fire was burning to one side. As the
  scraps of paper smouldered on the coals she considered deeply the only
  problem that had ever concerned her&mdash;that of herself. "What do I want?
  First, what has brought me here without the rewards of either what they call
  virtue or vice? My birth was a bad handicap, but I had a good education,
  plenty of chances. I was too impatient, and I never could put up with fools.
  What bad luck that I should have met such unmanageable men. After a while no
  one seems to like me even&mdash;and as for love, it goes in a breath."</p>

  <p>She crouched over the meagre fire and her fine features quivered with an
  expression of bitterness. "Why should I have to care whether men love or like
  me? That is what is so galling, and I suppose that brings me to what I
  want&mdash;independence. To be able to be indifferent to all of them. Love,
  for instance!"</p>

  <p>The echo of the word in her mind mocked her; she was cured of love as she
  was cured of drunkenness. Indulgence had soon brought her to a point of
  nausea; she had never given anyone tenderness or affection, and the
  recollection of dead passions that had ended in disgust and rage was like the
  recollection of the stench of decay. Even more loathsome was the memory of
  simulated emotions for pay&mdash;for poor pay, for a mere existence. She
  winced where she sat at the thought of No. 12 and the police description of
  it and of Mrs. Bulke. No virtue entered into this aversion from what her life
  had become, it was a matter of nerves, of squeamishness, of daintiness, one
  with her love of fine linen, of delicate food, of good manners. She had been
  bred a gentlewoman; sin did not offend her in the least, but grossness of
  behaviour was as detestable to her as a badly-cut shoe or a cheap glove. She
  had once scornfully repressed wild and violent ideals of love, but these had
  long been cast aside. The only man who had seemed to be worth consideration
  had proved a creature worthy only, she thought, of contempt. Her passion for
  him had been the most sincere, disinterested feeling of her life&mdash;and
  that which had gone furthest to ruin her fortunes.</p>

  <p>"I lost my head&mdash;only a little, but enough. Will it happen again,
  ever?"</p>

  <p>She stirred the fire, she watched the ashes of the scraps of paper stir,
  rise and float up the chimney.</p>

  <p>"No, not again. I've done with drink, with lust&mdash;you can't be what
  Daisy was unless you're born to it. I wasn't. As for love! No&mdash;I feel
  cold, cold&mdash;there isn't a man living&mdash;What else is there in life?
  As I have decided to live, what is there to live for? Independence&mdash;some
  position of authority and power."</p>

  <p>The ashes had floated away, the fire was almost extinct, the candle had
  nearly burnt down; the young woman was conscious of neither cold nor dark,
  only of her own resolution, which so burnt and shone in her heart that as she
  folded her arms over her breast she felt as if both warmed and lit by her own
  ardour.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">There was much excited public interest in the arrest of
young Pastor Morl
  for the murder of Daisy Arrow. One would have thought that nothing so
  sensational had ever happened before; yet what was it but the rather
  commonplace end of a rather commonplace young woman? But if the victim was
  ordinary enough, surely there was something extraordinary about the supposed
  murderer. Surely no one could ever remember before when a clergyman of an
  unblemished record and of a favoured nationality had been accused of a crime
  so sordid, so purposeless and so hideous.</p>

  <p>If the profession of Daisy Arrow had been any different or the profession
  of Maarten Morl any different, there might have been less public commotion
  about the affair. The contrast between these two, she, in common estimation,
  so deep a sinner, he, in common estimation, of such complete
  rectitude&mdash;she so low and outcast, hopelessly poor and wretched, broken
  in health, and he so prosperous, so wellborn and healthy. Victim and supposed
  murderer were much of an age (the young man was thirty-two years old, one
  year less than Daisy Arrow), both were of uncommon good looks, for the
  murdered girl's defects were forgotten now and she was usually spoken of as
  beautiful and usually praised as graceful and refined&mdash;above her
  class&mdash;"the lovely Daisy Arrow."</p>

  <p>Yes, that was the remarkable, that was the romantic and dramatic part of
  the affair&mdash;that these two creatures, so different in so much, even in
  nationality, indeed, in everything opposite, save in youth and handsomeness,
  should have been, as it were, violently brought together, if not by the
  actual deed, at least by the accusation.</p>

  <p>That Christmas night, that Christmas dawn, were vividly revived to satisfy
  the curiosity of these who had spent the time of festival in peace and
  happiness. The mean, dirty street, the outside of the empty, barred and
  locked house were visited by hundreds. Crowds of sightseers passed over the
  worn paving-stones, which had been so deserted when Annie Western, coming out
  to slop over her steps on Christmas morning, had seen the young man hurry
  away from No. 12 and disappear towards the Square into the fog. Every
  commonplace little detail of that evening was discussed; the bag of fruit and
  nuts&mdash;why had they stopped to buy that? Then the three visits of Daisy
  Arrow to the kitchen, once to boast of her visitor and to leave her fruit,
  once to offer the half-sovereign for the rent, once to beg for champagne or
  brandy&mdash;what was there behind those? All these most ordinary incidents
  seemed, in the minds of the gossiping scandalmongers, to take on an
  extraordinary significance. Even Daisy's high spirits, which at the time had
  merely been put down to the fact that she had been drinking heavily and to
  the excitement she had experienced in meeting what she termed "a well-to-do
  friend with plenty of money," were now attributed to something
  else&mdash;some mystery, some fatality, some extraordinary occurrence of
  which no one knew. After all, it was argued, there were many inexplicable
  things about that evening at No. 12.</p>

  <p>How was it, people argued, that Daisy Arrow had had all that money in her
  possession? What sort of a man would have met Daisy Arrow at the Argyll
  Rooms, stopped for her to buy a bag of cheap fruit, given her money, gold (it
  was half a sovereign that she had offered Mrs. Bulke), sent her down to ask
  for champagne or brandy? If he had been a drunken ruffian, a rustic fool,
  this behaviour might have been considered unremarkable, but how reconcile it
  with a man who was sober, who impressed those who saw him as
  well-bred&mdash;a gentleman? Then, the scrap of German note-paper.</p>

  <p>Belle turned all these questions over in her mind; she could not herself
  find any solution to the many problems that the case presented. She looked
  frequently at the names written inside the small German Bible, and read over
  and over again that sentimental little love-letter in German, signed only
  with "M.," with the only address that of "München," which Daisy had sent to
  her family, enclosed with a scrawl boasting: "I'm doing very well for myself
  and getting on fine, as this will show."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Belle would think, "I am wrong and none of this has anything to
  do with the murder." She turned over carefully the different reasons that
  were put forward for Daisy's odd behaviour on the last night of her life, the
  speculations as to who the man was, what his motives were for going home with
  Daisy Arrow, all the fantastic explanations given for the bag of fruit, for
  the money, for the request for the expensive wine. "If only," thought Belle,
  "I could have heard what they were saying that night in her
  room&mdash;perhaps if I had listened carefully I might have done so."</p>

  <p>As the young pastor had merely, on his first brief appearance at Bow
  Street, put forward the plea of "not guilty" and reserved his defence, there
  was a widespread curiosity and excitement as to what line would be taken by
  the lawyer, Mr. Peter Thorne, who had undertaken the case on the prisoner's
  behalf. No one believed that it would be possible to upset the evidence of
  the witnesses for the prosecution, who had procured so impressive an effect
  at the inquest when describing the stranger seen in Daisy Arrow's company on
  Christmas Eve and who had so unfalteringly identified him as Pastor Mori.
  Everyone thought that the magistrate would commit the prisoner for trial, and
  that the police court was but the prelude to the Old Bailey.</p>

  <p>Belle Adair was early at Bow Street that dark spring day; the rain fell
  heavily, washing the dirt off the houses, down the gutters, and soaking into
  the piles of refuse round Covent Garden. She took her place quietly in the
  little stuffy room reserved for the witnesses, and kept apart from the
  company by seating herself in the corner and affecting to read in a little
  book, a device that had been so useful to her before. It was a little manual
  of water-colour painting which had been given to her at school as a prize for
  good deportment that she had chosen for to-day's distraction. Through the
  tension in her mind swung the rhythm of the "Moss Rose" waltz; it seemed the
  melody, incongruous and unescapable, to which her life was set.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The dingy case proceeded in the dingy court; the rain
slashed at the
  high-set window which gave a bleak light that gleamed on the polished bald
  head of the magistrate, from which the arteries stood out in dull purple
  cords, the gold pin in his satin cravat, and on the starched linen of his
  cuffs, as he fumbled with papers and his spectacles.</p>

  <p>The prisoner stood upright in the dock, his back to the light which fell
  on his shoulders and stiff hair, which was dark yet bright, and left his face
  and the front of his person in shadow. His spirit seemed in shadow too, all
  his personality was so suppressed and veiled that he seemed a dummy standing
  in a suit of well-cut clothes. Not only all the colour, but all the fine
  contours seemed to have been wiped off his face, which appeared like a wax
  mask defaced by a lick of flame and then, coarsened and blurred, made for
  ever rigid.</p>

  <p>The case for the prosecution was formal, even dull; Mr.</p>

  <p>James Churton, who had the case for the Crown, put his witnesses in the
  box, one after another. All persisted in their identification of the
  prisoner. The evidence taken at the inquest was gone over again, together
  with that of Robert Halliday, the waiter from Jarvis's Royal Hotel.</p>

  <p>This florid, middle-aged man, comfortably dressed, respectable, not
  unintelligent, though nervous in manner, held the eager attention of the
  people packed on to the benches in the body of the court.</p>

  <p>With impressive deliberation and keeping his gaze fearfully on the
  prisoner, Robert Halliday described how a well-dressed and agitated young
  stranger had come to the hotel on Christmas Day and ordered breakfast, had
  partaken of this refreshment seated in an obscure corner of the dining-room,
  and afterwards had asked for a bed-room in which to make his toilet, and some
  turpentine to take the stains off his coat, and who had left behind him a
  twisted ball of handkerchief saturated with blood.</p>

  <p>It seemed to those who listened so eagerly to the unfolding of the case,
  that a most suspicious, even damning circumstance was the fact that this
  stained handkerchief was found to have in one corner the initial "M." The
  experts to whom it had been submitted had also declared that it was of a
  foreign make.</p>

  <p>Not the utmost efforts that Mr. Thorne made could shake Robert Halliday
  from his conviction that this young man whom he had served at Jarvis's Royal
  Hotel on Christmas Day was the young man who now stood in the dock.</p>

  <p>Arthur Lummin, the fruiterer, was also sure that the figure that had paced
  up and down in the fog at Covent Garden while Daisy Arrow made her Christmas
  purchases, muffled, with his overcoat-collar turned up and his hat pulled
  over his eyes, was the same as that of the prisoner.</p>

  <p>To the scornful objections to his evidence made by the lawyer for the
  defence, to reminders of the fog and the muffling and the little importance
  that he would have attached to the stranger on such a casual occasion, the
  fruiterer replied stubbornly:</p>

  <p>"You forgets someone till you see them, sir, and then you remember them
  well enough&mdash;and that's the gentleman himself in very truth."</p>

  <p>Annie Western was sure, too, that the young man who had slammed the door
  at No. 12, and who had hurried down the street on that dirty Christmas
  morning, was he who stood in the dock.</p>

  <p>"He's got another kind of coat on," she said, looking at the prisoner
  narrowly, "but it was him all right. As he went past me, I saw he had got his
  hand stuck in his waistcoat like he's got it now."</p>

  <p>At this the prisoner, who had maintained his wooden attitude, started,
  took his hand from his bosom, snatched his handkerchief from his pocket and
  pressed it to his lips, as if he had been stung on the mouth. At this
  indication that he was not without feeling there was a little movement of
  sympathy among the women present; his control and his refinement, his good
  clothes and his profession were so definitely in contrast to the crime he
  stood charged with, that the sentiment of those staring at him in relentless
  curiosity veered this way and that&mdash;now he was a monster, now "he
  couldn't have done it, poor fellow."</p>

  <p>Who was he, this stranger, this foreigner?</p>

  <p>His brief history had been, in the course of the case, briefly touched
  upon.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Maarten Morl was of a good family; at the beginning of his
career he had
  been attached in a small but honourable capacity to one of the German
  courts&mdash;that of the King of Wurttemberg. There had been an elder
  brother, heir to a not inconsiderable estate. Martin, as second son, had had
  an income sufficient to maintain a good appearance. When he was twenty-six
  years of age he had, despite the success he had made of his chosen career,
  changed all his plans and entered the Lutheran Church&mdash;devoting himself
  to the spiritual labours with great zeal and enthusiasm. On the death of his
  elder brother, two years afterwards, he had come into possession of the
  family fortune, but had, nevertheless, continued unchanged his modest,
  laborious life. He was then a man of some considerable property, the bulk of
  the income of which he devoted to work among the poor of Augsburg, the city
  nearest his estates at Maartensdorf, on the Württemberg-Bavarian borders.</p>

  <p>Until his present trouble his life had been uneventful; his presence in
  London was owing to a voyage to Brazil which he, Dr. Schoppe, and Herr
  Leutner were undertaking&mdash;a missionary enterprise to the Indians in the
  centre of South America, which the young man had himself financed, organized
  and supported with zeal and labour. The little party had come up from
  Ramsgate, where the ship <i>Der König von Bayern</i> had put in for a few
  days, in order to spend Christmas in London, a city with which Pastor Morl
  was fairly familiar, and where he had some friends.</p>

  <p>Belle, piecing together this simple history from whispers, chance remarks,
  a word here and there, tried to fit it in to what she knew, or what she might
  guess about the man in Bow Street dock.</p>

  <p>Young, comely, devoted to good works? All very well, but if the matter
  were gone into more deeply? She wished she were the lawyer for the Crown.</p>

  <p>The Court rose for the luncheon interval; Belle had not yet given her
  evidence; the defence had not been heard.</p>

  <p>Minnie Palmer again attached herself to Belle, and plagued her with her
  stupid chatter.</p>

  <p>"He never could have done it, could he, Belle? He could have never known,
  even <i>known</i> a girl like Daisy&mdash;not a good young man like that. Too
  good, isn't he?&mdash;a prig, I'd call him. That's it, I suppose. If anyone
  seems as good as that you may be sure there's something hidden behind. Yet,
  I'm sure he didn't do it. He's a gentleman you can see that&mdash;although
  he's a foreigner."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you can see that," said Belle. "That's what impressed everybody in
  the kitchen, wasn't it&mdash;that it was the voice of a <i>gentleman</i> we
  heard."</p>

  <p>"But not the voice of <i>that</i> gentleman, I'm sure," said Minnie Palmer
  stoutly. She yawned as they shivered out into the January air. "I don't think
  it's so exciting after all, it's rather dull. I'm getting tired of it. I wish
  they'd let him go and done with it."</p>

  <p>"That's what I say," said Moll, the servant, sidling up to the two women
  as they left the police court in the press. "Let him go and done with it. He
  ain't the man they're looking for."</p>

  <p>"Those other witnesses seem sure enough," said Belle, sharply, "don't
  they? And you seemed to identify his voice when you first heard it, didn't
  you, Moll? Why, it turned you quite sick and faint, made you cry out when you
  heard it in the corridor outside."</p>

  <p>"No, it didn't," replied the servant girl obstinately, "and I'll never say
  so neither. As for them others, they may be mistaken easy enough. That girl
  who saw him in the fog&mdash;ain't she used to men coming in the early
  morning down Great Hogarth Street? I daresay she saw several, even on
  Christmas morning. And as for them two waiters, neither of 'em had taken any
  notice."</p>

  <p>"What makes you so sure he didn't do it?" asked Belle. "He's a gentleman,"
  said Moll sullenly.</p>

  <p>Belle smiled. "Do you think a gentleman couldn't do a thing like
  that?"</p>

  <p>"No, not that sort of gentleman. You can laugh if you like, but I think
  he's a good man. He wouldn't have been in the Argyll Rooms. He wouldn't have
  picked up with anyone like Daisy Arrow."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Belle, "we must wait and see what the defence is. I'm
  curious, too, very curious."</p>

  <p>She refused to accompany the other women into a public-house for bread and
  cheese and some beer. She continued to dissociate herself from them as much
  as possible, as far as she could without exciting their noisy and violent
  antagonism.</p>

  <p>It was to her own room that she returned, and where she ate her humble
  sandwich and drank her lonely cup of tea&mdash;she had not touched wine or
  beer since Christmas Eve, and this continued abstinence from what had begun
  to be a darling vice, gave her a very pleasing sense of power.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the afternoon, as the light was beginning to fail, Belle
was again in
  the witness-box, repeating the evidence she had given at the inquest.</p>

  <p>It was very brief, and her precise business-like manner gave the lawyers
  no trouble.</p>

  <p>She had not, she declared, recognised the voice of the prisoner as that of
  the man she had heard on Christmas Eve at No. 12.</p>

  <p>As she spoke she looked directly and for the first time across at the
  prisoner. He was again standing erect in the dock, having again slipped his
  left hand, with the gesture that he had so convulsively changed in the
  morning when the servant-girl had remarked on it, into the bosom of his coat,
  his chin was sunk in the folds of his cravat, which was full and wide in the
  foreign fashion.</p>

  <p>He met Belle's look with a stare so expressionless and features so rightly
  composed, that his face might have been settling into the final blackness of
  death. She felt a gulf of shadows between them; the body of the court seemed
  like a pit. Surely it was time the gas was lit.</p>

  <p>Both the lawyers, prosecution and defence, questioned Belle rather sternly
  about the episode of the knife. It was a peculiar circumstance that Daisy
  Arrow should have taken up the clasp-knife from the theatre dressing-room
  table and should have carried it about with her for the rest of the night,
  thus taking with her the instrument of her own death.</p>

  <p>Belle admitted that it was peculiar. She said, without flippancy:</p>

  <p>"It may be the hand of fate that was in it, for, as I suppose, if the
  murderer had not had that weapon ready he could not have committed his crime,
  though maybe he would have strangled her with his hands."</p>

  <p>She was reproved for this. She was not there to give her opinion or
  suppositions. The magistrate, Mr. Clinner, called her peremptorily to order.
  She had no other explanation to give as to why Daisy Arrow had taken the
  knife, and neither of the lawyers could think of one, so that point was
  allowed to pass.</p>

  <p>The prisoner here asked for a glass of water, his tone was so low and his
  words so gruff, slurred by a foreign accent, that at first no one understood
  him. He repeated his request and, when the water was handed to him, asked if
  he might sit down. This also was allowed. There was a little murmur among the
  crowd, a pushing movement, a craning of the women's necks, that they might
  the better catch sight of the tortured man. He rose almost immediately,
  thanked the magistrate, and again stood erect.</p>

  <p>The clasp-knife which killed Daisy Arrow was produced in court. Belle
  identified it as that which had been taken from the Cambridge Theatre, so did
  the owner, a stage hand who had lent it to Belle.</p>

  <p>She was asked what had become of the plume of pink feathers which,
  according to Minnie Palmer's evidence, she had promised to lend to the dead
  woman? Belle repeated her tale: Daisy had come out by the stair-head and had
  returned the ornament before going into her own room and closing the
  door.</p>

  <p>The case for the Crown concluded, the prosecuting lawyer declared that it
  was an unanswerable case. "It was not," said he, "a question of motive, it
  was well known that the most unlikely people would commit the most
  extraordinary crimes."</p>

  <p>There was not the slightest evidence that the prisoner had formerly been
  acquainted with Daisy Arrow. He was of a religious, almost of a fanatically
  religious temperament, and it was known that such people suffered from
  strange manias, obsessions, and even insanity. One of these might be the
  explanation of what seemed on the surface a motiveless crime. It was not for
  him to search into the dark recesses of the human heart, or the horrible
  potentialities of the human spirit; it was for him to press the strong
  circumstantial evidence before them. There was the clue of the
  note-paper.</p>

  <p>Then, four independent witnesses had sworn to the prisoner. They might be
  called, all of them, trained observers. It is well known that waiters in the
  course of their occupations become used to noting their various clients more
  or less mechanically. It was part of their duty to do so.</p>

  <p>The waiter at the Argyll Rooms, however tired he had been, however crowded
  the company in which he had moved on Christmas Eve, would instinctively note
  the peculiarity of the young foreigner with Daisy Arrow, who was an
  <i>habituée</i> of the rooms well known to him.</p>

  <p>The waiter at that very respectable and highly commended hotel, Jarvis's
  Royal, would, despite the fog and the dark corner in which his customer had
  sat, instinctively and mechanically have noted this young man, especially as
  he had come in at an unusual hour and seemed to be a foreigner.</p>

  <p>The little maid cleaning the steps would also have her wits sharpened by
  constant contact with people coming and going, would take a lively interest
  in the happenings of the street, and glancing up when that door slammed,
  would also instinctively note the person of the man hurrying from No. 12,
  specially as he would instantly seem to her different from the usual type of
  man she had watched going into or leaving that establishment.</p>

  <p>The fruiterer also, a busy tradesman in the heart of London, would be a
  shrewd man, as the magistrate could judge&mdash;as he had proved himself in
  his evidence&mdash;one with his eyes about him He knew Daisy Arrow by sight,
  and his attention would certainly be called to her companion, when she came
  to his shop so late at night to buy her Christmas fruit.</p>

  <p>It had been argued, and no doubt would be still further argued, that
  recognition would be difficult owing to the fog, the muffling of the
  gentleman, the crowd in the Argyll Rooms, and so on, and so on; but he, the
  lawyer for the Crown, appealed to the magistrate to consider if there was not
  something about a personality which penetrated the thickest
  disguise&mdash;something that could be instantly recognised?&mdash;the
  carriage, the peculiarity of movement, something in height, gesture, "and,"
  added the lawyer for the Crown, "I think all will agree that the prisoner has
  quite a striking personality. I ask for a committal for trial."</p>

  <p>The prisoner leant from the dock and whispered a few words to Mr. Peter
  Thorne, who sat directly below him. He turned and spoke to him energetically
  and encouragingly. Herr Morl smiled blandly and returned to his rigid
  attitude of attention.</p>

  <p>"It makes me feel sick to think how he must be suffering," whispered the
  woman next to Belle. She continued, nevertheless, to gaze with relentless
  curiosity at the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing," whispered her companion, "to what he's got to go through
  when there's a proper trial at the Old Bailey&mdash;that'll be days and days
  of it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Peter Thorne opened the case for the defence; it was a very simple
  one; on behalf of the prisoner he pleaded a complete alibi.</p>

  <p>The first witness was Dr. Schoppe, the man who himself had been the first
  arrested for the murder of Daisy Arrow.</p>

  <p>A murmur of sympathy and good-will rose as the stout figure of the doctor,
  who was obviously nearly overwhelmed by agitation and distress, entered the
  witness-box; fog was coming up with the dusk; people coughed and choked; the
  gas-lamps made yellow rings in the thickening vapour. Dr. Schoppe seemed more
  agitated than the prisoner; he stared about him vaguely and his attention
  wandered; when he began to speak, his English was incoherent and an
  interpreter was suggested. At this he made an effort, asked the indulgence of
  the magistrate, and gave his evidence in tolerable English.</p>

  <p>He testified that <i>Der König von Bayern</i>, having been in port at
  Ramsgate for several days at Christmas, a party of the ship's officers had
  gone to London and taken rooms at the Hobart Hotel in the Strand.</p>

  <p>Both he (Dr. Schoppe), Herr Leutner, and Pastor Morl had friends in
  London, and they intended to spend their brief holiday visiting these, and in
  showing something of the sights of the great city, already familiar to them,
  to the only woman of the party, his daughter, Fräulein Lili Schoppe.</p>

  <p>On Christmas Eve, he, his daughter, Herr Leutner and</p>

  <p>Pastor Morl had visited the Tower. They had afterwards gone to a bazaar in
  Baker Street and purchased some little trifles. They had then returned and
  taken dinner at the Hobart Hotel. In the evening the hotel had given a little
  concert, followed by a dance. This had continued till nearly midnight.</p>

  <p>All the while (Dr. Schoppe was most emphatic on this point) Maarten Morl
  had been under his own close observation. He had only parted with him at his
  bedroom door, their two chambers being adjoining.</p>

  <p>He had been unable to sleep, being over-fatigued and disturbed by the
  noise of the people leaving the party, which was continued far into the
  night. So he had arisen&mdash;it was two o'clock by his watch when he struck
  a light and lit his candle&mdash;and had gone into Pastor Morl's room to beg
  him for the return of some sleeping-tablets which he had lent him during the
  voyage when the young man had suffered from sea-sickness. He would not, in
  the ordinary way, have done this, because he would have been reluctant to
  disturb his friend's sleep, but he had heard him not only moving in bed, but
  walking about the room.</p>

  <p>He had found him in his dressing-gown with his candle lit endeavouring to
  read a book on Brazil to relieve his sleeplessness. Herr Morl had been much
  excited about the missionary enterprise, the journey to Brazil, and the
  prospect of founding a Lutheran settlement in the interior, after the model
  of the Jesuit compounds. He had been full of plans for building a church, a
  hospital, and a school; in the pages of the book were drawings of buildings,
  lists of stores, medicines&mdash;all the material that the young minister had
  been so enthusiastically studying during the voyage. Nothing could have been
  further, Dr. Schoppe could swear, from the young man's thoughts than any
  visit to such a place as the Argyll Rooms.</p>

  <p>The stout doctor gained confidence as he proceeded with his evidence,
  which made a favourable impression on the eager audience.</p>

  <p>Under the careful examination of Mr. Thorne, the German drew a most
  sympathetic picture of his young friend, so studious, so devout, so set, with
  all his faculties, all his fortunes, on a venture idealistic and not without
  peril. He described emphatically his interview with Herr Morl on Christmas
  Eve, at the very hour when, according to medical evidence, Daisy Arrow must
  have been meeting her death.</p>

  <p>In the neat pleasant room of Hobart's Hotel the young man, so soon to be
  accused of so fearful a crime, had, mercifully for himself, been under the
  observation of his friend from two until nearly four o'clock of the morning
  of the murder. They had talked together about the plans of which both were so
  full, then the doctor had prescribed one of the sleeping-tablets for his
  friend, taking one himself, and had returned to his room, still, however,
  without being able to sleep.</p>

  <p>He had seen Maarten Morl early the next morning, about nine o'clock, when
  he had gone into his chamber to share his breakfast. Herr Leutner, a
  ship-owner, and a member of the proposed expedition, had also been of their
  company, to which effect he gave evidence.</p>

  <p>This totally unexpected alibi caused a revulsion of feeling towards the
  unhappy young man, who had seemed, on the report of the police, without a
  hope. Was it, after all, possible that there had been some mistake?</p>

  <p>The people in the dark court stared at the prisoner as if they would force
  him to look at them. He kept his eyes cast down and his glance on his hands,
  which were folded on the edge of the dock.</p>

  <p>Mr. Thorne produced the other witnesses.</p>

  <p>Fräulein Lili Schoppe, the little chamber-maid from "The Hobart," and a
  number of people who had seen and spoken to Pastor Morl on Christmas Eve
  during the festivities in that hotel confirmed the alibi. The most
  interesting of all who testified in the prisoner's favour was this young
  German girl, Dr. Schoppe's daughter. The first few questions put to her
  elicited the fact that she was betrothed to the accused man.</p>

  <p>The young Lili was a charming figure. She was attired in grey of a
  puritanical simplicity, with a white collar fastened by a large cameo brooch.
  She appeared about seventeen years of age, and was very pale, slender and
  dove-like; her hair was looped smoothly beneath her bonnet, her contours
  unblemished as those of a child.</p>

  <p>Her agitation was extreme; she could scarcely speak for her deep distress.
  The capricious championship of the crowd went out to her because she was so
  young, so innocent, and seemed so stricken by this sordid horror, a great
  deal of which must be incomprehensible to her sweet ignorance.</p>

  <p>What could she&mdash;the promised bride of a missionary dedicated to toil,
  privation, faith and service in the cause of God&mdash;know of such women as
  Daisy Arrow, or of such impulses as those which led men to No. 12?</p>

  <p>Mr. Thorne noted with satisfaction the effect of her mere presence on the
  magistrate. This was more decisively in the prisoner's favour than what she
  said. It occurred to everyone that the fact that he was engaged to this fair,
  delicate creature made it still more unlikely that Maarten Morl would hang
  about the Argyll Rooms making acquaintanceship with creatures like Daisy
  Arrow&mdash;still more unlikely that he was leaving his bride-to-be, his
  father-in-law-to-be, and all his friends, the gay and cheerful surroundings
  of the Hobart Hotel, and accompanying the tawdry Daisy Arrow to an
  establishment like that kept by Mrs. Bulke.</p>

  <p>Conquering her nervous terror, and with an effort that had something of
  the heroic in it, Lili Schoppe gave her evidence.</p>

  <p>She swore that her lover had never left her company during Christmas Eve
  until she had said good night to him at the foot of the stairs near twelve
  o'clock; when he had not been actually with her&mdash;dancing with her or
  seated beside her&mdash;he had been moving about the room where she could see
  him.</p>

  <p>Herr Leutner's evidence was to the same effect; so was that of the
  waiters, the chamber-maids, the porter and the manager of "Hobart's."</p>

  <p>There were even other points in favour of the prisoner:</p>

  <p>No overcoat had been found in his wardrobe that had recently been cleaned
  with turpentine, nor any light overcoat like that the alleged murderer was
  described as wearing; the blood-stained handkerchief of foreign make with the
  single "M" left behind at Jarvis's Hotel did not match those owned by the
  prisoner, which were marked by a double "M" enlaced, and were of Irish
  manufacture. The prisoner prided himself on the fineness of his linen and
  always sent to a Belfast house for his supply. He had, on the occasion of
  this visit, purchased several dozen of these double-initial handkerchiefs at
  a shop in Bond Street. On the train journey from Ramsgate a valise had been
  stolen that contained a packet of ship's papers. This loss had been notified
  before the murder. The valise had not been traced. Anyone might be in
  possession of the German note-paper.</p>

  <p>The alibi seemed complete; even allowing that it was an unlikely
  supposition that the prisoner's friend, his future father-in-law, and his
  betrothed were committing perjury on his behalf, there remained a number of
  people, quite indifferent and impartial, who swore to his presence at the
  party on Christmas Eve at the Hobart Hotel.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the room reserved for the witnesses, Belle studied the
young German
  girl. Minnie Palmer had excitedly whispered: "That's his sweetheart." Belle
  turned her attention from the book at which she had been looking steadily
  during most of the tedious hours to Lili Schoppe, and with an intense and
  womanly inquisitiveness, considered her in every detail as she sat drooping
  and shuddering, yet holding herself with an intense reserve, on the end of
  the hard bench.</p>

  <p>Belle gazed across the gas-lit room at Lili Schoppe until her surroundings
  were a mere blur to her; she studied the young girl as a botanist might study
  a flower under a microscopic lens, committing to heart the texture, the
  veining, the delicate root, the tender heart, the whole transparent and
  lovely structure, and as the botanist thinks at the end of his scrupulous
  examination that he knows his flower, so Belle Adair thought she knew the
  young German&mdash;so simple, so innocent, so utterly unarmed and unprepared
  for assault.</p>

  <p>The corner in which Belle sat was some distance from where Lili Schoppe
  drooped against the dingy wall, but presently, as if drawn, without knowing
  why and against her own volition, by that intense gaze of the other woman,
  she raised her slender neck and looked round like one who thinks that she has
  heard herself called, and searched among those curious faces about her until
  she discovered Belle's gaze fixed on her. She returned this stare with a look
  that held an agony of bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Belle smiled directly at the girl as if already there was a familiarity
  between them, then turned away and looked again at her book.</p>

  <p>"You and I, my girl," she thought to herself, "will have to see something
  of each other in the future, as I suppose, and it is well that we should
  begin by a good acquaintance."</p>

  <p>Yes, Belle believed that she was quite familiar with the simple heart and
  candid soul of Lili Schoppe.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The case was nearly at an end; the witnesses had given
their evidence, the
  prisoner his complete denial of the charges, the lawyers had made their
  speeches. Everyone was excited and weary. The fog had thickened in the
  court-room. It was a damp winter evening&mdash;chilly outside the building,
  but inside rank and heated from foul air.</p>

  <p>The prisoner refused to sit down. He must have been standing for hours.
  Everyone seemed to have lost count of the time. Surely for hours that rigid
  figure with the hand thrust into the breast of the coat had been erect there
  behind the wooden rail.</p>

  <p>"It's nearly over now," said Belle to herself, "it's coming to an end at
  last. Well, I, too, am tired. This has been very tedious. It will, however,
  soon be over," she repeated, lilting the words in her mind to the "Moss Rose"
  waltz; she smiled, pressing her handkerchief to her lips. "How soon
  everything will be over&mdash;even life itself."</p>

  <p>That sense of the brevity of human existence had much to do with her
  detached courage, with her quiet reserve, for she was sustained by the
  precise and arid philosophy that considers all action, virtuous or vile, as
  so much mere passing of the hours before the final annihilation.</p>

  <p>In these closing stages of the case, when everyone in the police court was
  thinking intensely of the prisoner, of the drama of his
  situation&mdash;speculating with a fierce curiosity as to his possible
  fate&mdash;Belle, alone among the witnesses, was thinking only of herself;
  she was free, she supposed, to leave, but she had no wish to do this.</p>

  <p>She had noticed with an ironic amusement that she had made a little stir
  when she had appeared in the witness-box. She was very neatly dressed in
  grey, cut with prudish severity that suited her grace, her refined pallor,
  and that yet showed off her shape a little too well, and to which her cold
  brilliant eyes, with their air of sophistication, gave an odd air of a
  deliberate and self-conscious simplicity, which was very different from the
  careless and natural simplicity of Lili Schoppe.</p>

  <p>She knew that they had all wondered at the great difference between her
  appearance and her profession; she did not look like an actress, she did not
  look like a woman who had lodged at No. 12, with Mrs. Bulke for a landlady.
  That little touch of mystery about the assumed name&mdash;that, too, had been
  effective. She had seen Roger Owen, the murdered woman's brother, gazing at
  her with a fascination, touched&mdash;she thought, and was glad to
  think&mdash;with fear. He had followed in his evidence (unconsciously, no
  doubt, as stupid people will repeat by rote instructions given them) her
  promptings. He had been questioned about the letter from abroad that his
  sister had received&mdash;and he had said that it was from Paris and of no
  importance, written merely to tell her family that she was in a good
  situation, and that he had destroyed it, as he had sworn at the inquest.</p>

  <p>Thinking of these things with satisfaction, Belle continued to gaze at
  Lili Schoppe, who, regardless of the agitated, whispered consolations of her
  father, leant against the wall with her face averted from them all, her
  bonnet in her slack fingers, her hair falling in the nape of her neck.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," mused Belle, "who is suffering the more, he or she? Where have
  I seen some face like hers before? As colourless, as insipid as a glass of
  water!"</p>

  <p>She remembered; the avenging angels descending from the black clouds in
  <i>The Last Judgment</i> hanging above Mrs. Bulke's piano had had firm
  features resembling those of the German girl, and smooth blonde hair banded
  over their ears in the same fashion as her lint-coloured locks. Belle was
  amused. Lili Schoppe, with her air of a rustic Sunday-school teacher, like
  one of God's messengers of doom!</p>

  <p>How long the case was taking, perhaps it would not finish to-day, after
  all. Belle began to feel drowsy, to sense another scene behind the present
  one&mdash;odd that, some scene from her childhood&mdash;girls on a lawn,
  lilac with upright blooms, laburnum with drooping tresses, the smell of
  trodden grass, of damp earth; the hum of picnic laughter, a little girl like
  Lili Schoppe standing erect in the sunshine, as if she had been suddenly
  created by the power of the summer day.</p>

  <p>Belle roused herself by a stern effort of will; she did not often
  day-dream; she must be half-drugged by fatigue, by foul air, by the drifting
  fog in eyes and throat, by the sight of the stupid, weary, excited faces of
  the other witnesses. Why didn't that foolish German cease his hoarse,
  half-hysteric whispering to his daughter? The guttural sounds among which she
  constantly heard the word "God" rasped on Belle's nerves. She tried to read,
  but between her eyes and the print floated the simple face and figure of Lili
  Schoppe&mdash;as an angel, as a schoolgirl, cleaving the monstrous clouds
  that rolled beneath the Judgment Seat, pausing beneath the spring blossoms of
  a childish festival.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">After all the prolonged tension of waiting, judgment was
pronounced by the
  thin, bald magistrate blinking through the fog.</p>

  <p>"To my mind," said Mr. Gunner gravely, "it has been conclusively shown
  that Mr. Morl, who stands accused of this crime, was not the companion of the
  murdered woman on Christmas Eve."</p>

  <p>He paused as if to allow the breath of suspense and relief time to rise
  and fall, as if to give the prisoner time to compose himself after this shock
  of an acquittal.</p>

  <p>Everyone was looking at Maarten Morl. He had not changed his demeanour in
  the least. "Perhaps," some thought, "he has not quite understood what the
  magistrate has said."</p>

  <p>Mr. Clinner continued:</p>

  <p>"The evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution at first undoubtedly
  pointed to Mr. Morl as having been in the company of Daisy Arrow, and
  therefore the police were justified in taking the course they did. The case
  had been now most fully investigated and the witnesses on both sides have
  been subject to a close and searching examination and I am satisfied that the
  witnesses who have spoken as to the identity of the prisoner as having been
  the last companion of this unhappy young woman are entirely in error. The
  loss of the valise containing the note-paper makes that of no value as
  evidence. The thief might be the murderer."</p>

  <p>This time the prisoner did move; he raised his right hand from his breast
  and put it across his eyes, and his whole body was shaken by a violent
  convulsion&mdash;as if he had been not acquitted, but condemned, so
  expressive of dread and fear was the sound that came from him.</p>

  <p>His lawyer and the German Consul, who was sitting near him, sprang up as
  if in some way to encourage the young minister, but the magistrate made a
  sign for silence.</p>

  <p>Maarten Morl recovered, to some extent, his composure, but remained
  standing half-turned away from the court&mdash;still with his hand before his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Even supposing," continued Mr. Clinner, "that the evidence for the
  prosecution had been more free from discrepancies, I should have considered
  the case on the part of the prosecution entirely destroyed by the evidence of
  the witnesses for the defence. It is, therefore," added the magistrate,
  slightly raising his voice, "my duty, and a duty I discharge with great
  satisfaction to myself, to state that the prisoner is released, and as far as
  I can see, I can say that he leaves the court without suspicion."</p>

  <p>Mr. Clinner glanced towards the prisoner, then, perhaps suspecting that
  the young German did not quite understand what had been said, he directly
  addressed him, adding:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Morl, you are a free man. You are acquitted. You leave the court
  without the least suspicion resting upon you."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The news of the acquittal was instantly in the room
occupied by the
  witnesses; the policeman moved from the door and the weary men and women came
  eagerly out into the corridor and pressed towards the court.</p>

  <p>Belle Adair looked at Lili Schoppe being half-dragged along by her
  father.</p>

  <p>"Now I suppose, you little fool, you'll faint and make a scene, or go and
  hang round his neck, like the ninny you are."</p>

  <p>She pushed her way through the crowd into the court, which was full of
  people muttering with surprise, almost disappointment, sympathy, excitement.
  Belle stood firm in the press and stared at Lili Schoppe.</p>

  <p>Her father had hurried across to the dock; he and the other Germans were
  standing close to the prisoner, who seemed incapable of movement and who,
  although the sergeant who had stood beside him during the proceedings offered
  to assist him down the two steps that led to the floor, remained rigid at his
  post, like a sentinel who, after a long and arduous vigil, is too broken to
  understand the word of release when it comes.</p>

  <p>Lili Schoppe did not run to her lover; she did not, as Belle had expected,
  give any display of emotion. She fell away from her father and on to a bench,
  her hands twisted in her lap, her head hanging on her breast so that the
  smooth loops of her hair hid her face.</p>

  <p>In their own language the Germans were saying heartily:</p>

  <p>"It is over, Maarten! It is over! You understand? You are free, it has all
  been an incredible mistake. Let's get away from this horrible place."</p>

  <p>The haggard prisoner stared over their heads and said loud and distinctly
  in English:</p>

  <p>"There is someone here to whom I must speak."</p>

  <p>"Lili!" cried Dr. Schoppe, calling his daughter over his shoulder. "Come,
  Maarten wants to speak to you. You must be the very first to clasp his
  hand."</p>

  <p>The prisoner shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, not Lili, there is someone else."</p>

  <p>Belle smiled, drew her handkerchief across her lips and looked down.</p>

  <p>"Maarten," pleaded the doctor in deep agitation, "come down from that
  dreadful place where you stand. All your friends are round you. There is no
  one else here to whom you should speak: they are all foreigners, strangers,
  cruel people who have come to stare."</p>

  <p>At these insistent words the young man started, stared down into the
  honest, disturbed face of Christian Schoppe, shook his head in a bewildered
  fashion, and made as if at last he would leave the dock. He had not made one
  step before he fell. Mr. Thorne caught at him&mdash;the unexpected and heavy
  burden was too much for the lawyer's strength. The young man half-slipped,
  and lay against the steps from the dock. Some of the women began to shed
  facile tears.</p>

  <p>"The poor gentleman. It had been a torment, no doubt, all those hours of
  it and he innocent, after all&mdash;as anyone could have seen from the look
  of him!"</p>

  <p>Belle, deliberately turning, edged through the crowd&mdash;the ushers were
  in vain endeavouring to clear the court&mdash;she did not go to the little
  group about the unconscious man to whom the police surgeon was attending, she
  turned instead to one who had been forgotten&mdash;Lili Schoppe, still seated
  on the now empty bench, still drooping against the dingy wall. Belle sat down
  beside her, close to her as a shadow.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to go and see your lover?" she whispered. "He has fainted,
  the shock has been too much. Don't you think you ought to be the first person
  to find him when he recovers?"</p>

  <p>The other girl raised her head. She looked like one suddenly recalled from
  deep sleep or vivid dreams.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she stammered. "Ah, yes, you are one of those&mdash;" She
  could not find the word nor would not name the thing, but was silent, staring
  at Belle with her finger on her mouth, her lips apart, and her face, Belle
  thought, with much of that ugly, bloodless pallor that Daisy Arrow's face had
  had on that Christmas morning as she lay at rest on her soaked pillow, with
  her red hair spread over that other red that defiled the cheap cotton
  pillow-case.</p>

  <p>"I'm one of the witnesses, yes," said Belle quietly. "I was quite a useful
  witness to your lover, too, was I not? If I had recognised his voice it would
  have made a difference. If I had chanced to see him it would have made a
  difference, too. I was a friend of the poor girl who was killed so horribly.
  These things are dreadful, are they not?" went on Belle in a low rapid tone.
  "So much agony and distress! I suppose you understood very little of it."</p>

  <p>"I do not," murmured Lili Schoppe, with a painful attempt at control,
  "understand English so very well."</p>

  <p>"You might understand it, but still not understand this case," said Belle.
  "You are so very young."</p>

  <p>Lili Schoppe struggled clumsily to her feet.</p>

  <p>"I must go to my father. I must go to Maarten."</p>

  <p>"Why, that's what I said," smiled Belle. "I wondered why you were sitting
  apart."</p>

  <p>Lili rose, but found she could not stand alone.</p>

  <p>"I do not know what to do," she sighed. She sat down, and her expression
  of childish woe deepened.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing for you to do," said Belle. "Look, the court is
  clearing, soon there will be nobody here but your friends, and you will be
  able to go away with your father. Where are you staying? At the Hobart Hotel
  in the Strand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, so far we have been there."</p>

  <p>"And your lover, too? Remember he is now quite safe. Will you continue
  your voyage to Brazil?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," muttered Lili. "I don't know. I don't quite understand
  what you say nor why you question me. I think everything will be different
  now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, will it?" asked Belle, rising, "will it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," nodded Lili. "Perhaps after all we shall not go. Perhaps we'll
  return to Germany. I do not know."</p>

  <p>She edged away on the bench from Belle and put her hands before her
  face.</p>

  <p>Belle walked gracefully through the empty benches. The police had
  succeeded in clearing the court. Only the personal friends of the prisoner,
  the surgeon and a few police officers remained by the unconscious man, whose
  feet had been propped up on some hassocks and whose head, drenched with
  water, was low on the dirty floor. Belle approached this group with such an
  air of intimacy and authority that all, far from questioning her right to be
  there, made way for her as if sure that her mission was one of
  importance.</p>

  <p>It was Dr. Schoppe to whom she spoke the while she was staring down at the
  prostrate man.</p>

  <p>"You should go to your daughter, she is sitting over there alone."</p>

  <p>"Ach, Lili, Lili," muttered the doctor distractedly. "Yes, I should go to
  her. She has suffered quite as much as Mr. Morl, don't you think? She should
  have a little attention."</p>

  <p>Smiling and holding up her skirts, the young woman made an elegant
  half-bow to the group of men who stared at her so curiously, and looked down
  at that distracted, unconscious face with the pinched nostrils and fallen
  jaw. How well she knew every detail of it, how accurately she could sketch it
  from memory! She had a pleasing sensation of power that increased her
  self-respect.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well," she said, "ah, well. I shall have to be getting along to the
  Cambridge," and she turned away.</p>

  <p>In the outer room she met Mr. Matchwell. He had been employed in clearing
  away from the corridors and entrances of Bow Street police station all the
  idling gossipers who had wished to linger in the warmth and shelter to
  discuss this extraordinary case.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mr. Matchwell," smiled Belle. "It must be vexatious for you to feel
  you have made such a bad mistake, but no doubt you are pleased to see a
  fellow-creature escape such an atrocious fate."</p>

  <p>"That's mere copy-book talk," replied the superintendent quietly, "and if
  I were you, I shouldn't use it, not when you expect to be believed. And
  what's your interest, ma'am, in this case, anyhow? Don't waste time, ma'am,"
  added the detective, who never before had spoken so plainly to Belle, "in
  telling me that you was a friend of the murdered woman."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't," admitted Belle, unmoved. She lingered in the doorway, drawing
  on her neat cotton gloves. "It's a very strange affair, Mr.
  Matchwell&mdash;so many for, so many against. Now who was lying?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe nobody. It's merely a question of a mistake&mdash;a mistaken
  identity. You've heard of that, haven't you, ma'am?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, and I've heard of faked alibis, too."</p>

  <p>Mr. Matchwell shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The Germans, maybe, but not those people at the hotel."</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose you won't let the murderer slip through your fingers,
  nevertheless, Mr. Matchwell, but will still go on searching until you find
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Searching and searching, as you might say, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"But what about this unfortunate gentleman, Mr. Matchwell?&mdash;this poor
  virtuous clergyman who gave up everything to serve God and the poor? Hasn't
  he been greatly wronged through your mistake?"</p>

  <p>"If he has, I suppose he'll get compensation," said the detective sternly,
  "but that's not for me to discuss, ma'am&mdash;nor you either, as far as I
  can see."</p>

  <p>"I daresay not, but it will be discussed, and by all London." Belle paused
  and looked keenly into the weary pockmarked face of the neat detective. "What
  possible clue have you now? That would much interest me to know. I can't help
  wondering, in a case like this, what there can be to go on?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps nothing, ma'am. But he might give himself away&mdash;they
  sometimes do."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"By doing it again."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;by doing it again?"</p>

  <p>"Cutting another woman's throat."</p>

  <p>"That seems unlikely, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, they do, you know. Likely enough he was mad, or near mad, and likely
  enough he'll break out again&mdash;when he's pushed or provoked."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle waited outside the police court in the chill dark;
after about a
  quarter of an hour the Germans, a close group, hurried into the street, the
  young clergyman, muffled to the throat and his hat over his eyes, in their
  midst. A considerable number of curious people had gathered to see him come
  out, and among them Belle passed unnoticed, for she was careful to keep
  behind the others. She could see both Pastor Morl and Dr. Schoppe look
  sharply and keenly through the gas-light.</p>

  <p>"For me," she thought, "no doubt&mdash;for me."</p>

  <p>Lili had pulled her veil down, but obscured as she was, she gave Belle
  that odd reminder of lilac, a sunny day. <i>The Last Judgment</i>. The party
  got into a hackney carriage, Dr. Schoppe gave the address&mdash;Hobart's
  Hotel, the Strand.</p>

  <p>Belle followed leisurely on foot, with her easy stride and erect carriage,
  through the foggy gloom, through the fine rain that was darkening the greasy
  pavement.</p>

  <p>"No time to be lost," she said to herself, "no, none at all. This is
  fatiguing and tedious. I would much rather go home and rest before my
  dance."</p>

  <p>She turned into a little stationer's shop opposite St. Clement Dane's
  church, and bought for a penny an envelope and a sheet of paper, and asked
  for the loan of a pencil. Then, leaning on the little counter in the space
  between the large jars of lollipops, liquorice and peppermints, she wrote a
  line in her clear, finicky hand, sealed the flimsy envelope, addressed it,
  and then offered the stationer's boy twopence for delivering it just round
  the corner at the Hobart Hotel, and waiting for an answer. "If you insist on
  getting the answer quickly and bringing it to me immediately I shall give you
  sixpence."</p>

  <p>The boy ran gladly, and Belle lingered at the corner of the street while
  he did his errand. A thick, soiled vapour was creeping up from the unseen
  river at the bottom of the sloping side street. This seemed to crowd about
  Belle in coils as she paced about, slowly, patiently; the dark clouds that
  hid the evening sky, full of the sooty smoke of the city, seemed also to
  press down on her as she waited, so that she was hidden by fog, by darkness,
  by vapour on vapour, by sluggish, dirty twilight.</p>

  <p>The boy might have some difficulty&mdash;they would be on their guard, no
  doubt, against curiosity-mongers, inquisitive visitors, journalists. But it
  seemed that he had not met with any delays, for he returned almost before
  Belle had expected him, and gave her a small envelope, on the back of which
  was the name of the hotel; Belle produced sixpence with a smile As he,
  jingling his pence and the silver coin, ran back into the yellow light of the
  shop, she went her way.</p>

  <p>It gave her such an oddly pleasurable sensation to hold the clean, small,
  square envelope, that she delayed the other pleasure of opening it and
  reading the contents.</p>

  <p>"What time is it?"</p>

  <p>There was a clock on the church tower, but she could not make that out for
  the fog.</p>

  <p>"How long before I am due at the theatre?"</p>

  <p>There was something else that, in spite of her fatigue, she wished to do.
  Surely there would be time, as her dance did not come on until well into the
  middle of the pantomime. She hastened her steps in the direction of the hotel
  where the party of Germans from <i>Der König von Bayern</i> had spent
  Christmas Eve.</p>

  <p>At this family establishment, which was one of great respectability,
  Belle, with her most impressive air of reserve and decorum, made enquiries of
  the porter as to her uncle and aunt&mdash;a certain Dean and his
  lady&mdash;due, she thought, in London that day or the next and about whom
  she had become concerned since they had not called on her as she had hoped;
  she feared their train had been delayed by the fog.</p>

  <p>While enquiries were being made on her behalf Belle looked round the
  handsome entrance with an air of admiration. She remarked to the porter that
  the place looked far finer and more commodious than she would have supposed
  from the exterior, and added that some relations of hers, who usually came to
  London in the winter and who had declared themselves ill-lodged in their
  present choice of hotel, would be glad to know of this. She ingenuously asked
  if they did not give a good many festivities during the holiday season, upon
  which the porter said: "Yes, Christmas week there was a party and a concert
  every night."</p>

  <p>Belle thereupon very courteously asked if she might have a list of these
  pleasant entertainments to send to her relatives. Were there not some printed
  programmes or bills of fare?</p>

  <p>The porter said there were, and, he believed, some still left in the
  office. He would fetch them if the lady would wait.</p>

  <p>The lady waited in as inconspicuous a place as possible, for she feared
  that some of the waiters and chambermaids who had given evidence at Bow
  Street that afternoon, might return and recognise her; not that it would
  matter very much, she reminded herself, or really interfere with her plans at
  all, but she would prefer to come and go unobserved.</p>

  <p>The waiter returned with a polite regret that nothing was known of the
  Rev. Dean and his wife, nor of any room that was booked for such people.
  Belle also had her regrets&mdash;she was sorry to have given so much trouble.
  Perhaps she had mistaken the hotel.</p>

  <p>With a smile of gratitude she accepted the little package of papers which
  the hall porter gave her and slipped them into her reticule beside the note
  which the stationer's boy had brought her from the Hobart. Then she was out
  again in the fog.</p>

  <p>Time to go home? No, better go direct to the theatre. She would be an
  object of curiosity there to-night. How they would question her&mdash;how
  they would crowd about her. If only she could get away from the
  Cambridge&mdash;and the very name of "Belle Adair."</p>

  <p>Nothing much could be done while she was thus enmeshed in circumstances
  and while she had her living to get. There was that ugly fact&mdash;the
  thirty shillings a week at the Cambridge was her only means of existence, and
  even though she spent nothing on drink, even though she had had the five
  pounds to set her up in a new habit, it was still necessary to be very
  careful. If only she could have a dressing-mom to herself&mdash;six or seven
  girls now had to use that wretched cubicle under the stage where she had to
  put on nightly the bedraggled pink skirt, the soiled green bodice, the yellow
  wig, the fantastic cap like the calyx of a flower.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, it's no use thinking like that. I must be sure not to make a
  mistake. So far everything has been lucky&mdash;or not so lucky? What of Lili
  Schoppe?&mdash;was that luck?" She did not know. "Am I quite sure of Roger
  Owen? A fool." But Belle had had the most poignant experience of how perilous
  fools could be. Then Superintendent Matchwell, that shrewd, experienced,
  quiet man&mdash;he would not drop the case, even though Herr Morl might be
  acquitted. He would be&mdash;slowly, patiently, secretly, no
  doubt&mdash;investigating into the mystery of the murder of Daisy
  Arrow&mdash;into the mystery of the identity of the tall young man who had
  been seen at the Argyll Rooms, waiting outside the fruiterer's shop while
  Daisy Arrow made her Christmas purchase, hurrying down the empty, foggy,
  stained street by Annie Western slopping over the step and finally by the
  waiter that drab Christmas morning in the breakfast-room of Jarvis's Royal
  Hotel.</p>

  <p>Walking, for all her energy, very slowly towards the theatre, Belle came
  to a pause beneath a street lamp, opened her reticule, and glanced at the
  papers before her the programme of concerts and dances on December 22nd,
  December 23rd, December 24th, 1868. She slipped these back and pulled out the
  envelope and slit it open. This contained, besides the date and the two
  initials "MM" at the bottom, four words: "I shall be there."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle knelt on the rough red hassock, her elbows on the
pale, varnished
  pew, her face in her hands. It was an uncomfortable attitude&mdash;she
  maintained it as a penance for her own impatience. She had bought a knot of
  snowdrops when passing through Covent Garden&mdash;early costly flowers, cold
  and strong&mdash;she had laid them beside the rubbed broken-backed Prayer
  Book, and through her fingers she looked steadily at these two objects, the
  dingy book, the cluster of the pure flowers. She had never been in St. Paul's
  church before. It was, she thought, a dismal harbourage from the dirt and
  turmoil of the common street. The atmosphere was not unlike that of Bow
  Street police court; here, as there, an unnatural light from high-placed
  windows gleamed on light varnished seats, but in the church instead of a
  royal likeness and framed sheets of rules and regulations, there were busts
  of the dead in dusty niches and mural tablets that marked their praises with
  Latin inscriptions, and instead of the magistrate's seat, a prim altar with
  brassy ornaments. An old pew-opener was shuffling about with a duster and a
  broom. "Why," thought Belle, "does she keep looking at me? Is it so strange
  for someone to come in here to pray?" She had not reckoned on the company of
  that crooked, coughing woman. She had thought, indeed, that she would have
  the church to herself&mdash;that was why she had chosen this peculiar place.
  The presence of this contemptible stranger spying on her with hostile eyes,
  which seemed to penetrate her own concentration on her own designs, a little
  shook her courage.</p>

  <p>She was attempting something very difficult, and she had no one to advise
  or help her&mdash;a single false step and she might be in a deeper morass
  than that from which she was endeavouring to extricate herself. Not, of
  course, she instantly reminded herself, that she had anything to lose, but
  since Christmas morning, when hope had suddenly revived in her shocked heart,
  she had found herself building plans for the future. Now, suddenly, all her
  schemes seemed impossible.</p>

  <p>Supposing he did not come? Supposing that he defied her and escaped? He
  had plenty of means of leaving the country. What could she, penniless and
  forlorn, do in the way of pursuit if he should choose that course? Surely he
  would think of that&mdash;escape and the impossibility of her pursuit.</p>

  <p>Yet she comforted herself by the reflection that his sudden and
  sensational popularity would bold him in London. He had become a hero of the
  people&mdash;he could not be so ungracious or so tactless as to fly from
  these lavish amends for an atrocious mistake that were being so generously
  offered?</p>

  <p>Why won't that woman leave off shuffling about with her broom and her
  duster? As if anything would ever get the dirt off this place. She never
  thinks of those statues up there, with dust on them like grey wigs and
  cobwebs among their antique robes.</p>

  <p>Belle shifted from her cramped position, dropped her hands from her face
  and gave the old pew-opener, who was quite close to her, a prolonged stare.
  She was glad to see that this caused the prying woman some uneasiness; she
  shuffled away, and presently went into the vestry.</p>

  <p>"She's afraid, I suppose, that I might complain that she was disturbing my
  devotions. Now, what time can it be? There's no clock in this place; I
  suppose he's going to be late, but then I was too early&mdash;it may not be
  much past the time."</p>

  <p>All her senses were naturally acute, and now, on the alert. She heard the
  church door open cautiously and cautiously close&mdash;she did not need to
  look round. Then a hushed step came up the aisle; he would see her at once,
  of course; she did not envy him his sensation on entering the bleak church
  and seeing that one neat figure in the decorous grey kneeling in the empty
  pew awaiting him with ruthless patience.</p>

  <p>She picked up the little bunch of snowdrops and held them in her pretty
  hands; how early they were&mdash;forced under glass or from the South of
  England. Why had she bought them? It was a long time since she had purchased
  flowers.</p>

  <p>He entered the pew and knelt down a few paces away. She glanced at him
  quickly, sideways. He was praying, his face hidden in his hands.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for such hypocrisy," she thought contemptuously, and then
  it occurred to her that perhaps the young man's supplication was
  genuine&mdash;the overflowing of a sincere anguish.</p>

  <p>He remained so long thus&mdash;with his shoulders bowed and his face
  hidden&mdash;that she became impatient; she feared the reappearance of the
  pew-opener from the vestry; she rose, moved towards him and whispered:</p>

  <p>"We can't stay here&mdash;there's an old woman about. I did not think of
  that; I'm not used to churches."</p>

  <p>Without looking up he asked under his breath:</p>

  <p>"Where, then, shall we go? Are you being watched or followed?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so."</p>

  <p>He raised his head at that, but did not look at her, but stared straight
  ahead of him at the bare altar, on which were three metallic gleams on the
  brass crucifix and the two brass vases.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be seen here," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"We must talk," said Belle, "but we can't here; even this whispering may
  bring here that old creature."</p>

  <p>"Need we talk? I suppose what you want is very simple&mdash;what you have
  to say is soon said?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not so simple nor so soon said," she replied. "I await your
  suggestions."</p>

  <p>At that the young man looked at her, and she was the one who flinched He
  seemed to have greatly changed since she had seen him in the dock at Bow
  Street police station, since she had stared at him prone on the dirty floor.
  Which was the true personality&mdash;this or that?</p>

  <p>"What shall I call you?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Adair&mdash;that will do for the present."</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;then, Miss Adair, it seems to me that we have this church to
  ourselves; Dr. Schoppe told me you could speak German?" It was in that
  language he addressed her; she nodded, and he continued: "Tell me what you
  have to say here and now."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I know German well enough to tell you all I have to. I
  might lose a shade of meaning," whispered Belle.</p>

  <p>"So might I in your language, with which I am not so very familiar."</p>

  <p>Belle glanced down at his hands grasping his high hat. She was quite
  certain that he was more nearly her equal and more to be respected and
  admired than she had supposed. Yes, that air of bewildered innocence, of
  manly simplicity that he had maintained so skilfully in the dock must have
  been a pose. This conviction of his strength made her more ruthless.</p>

  <p>"Come outside," she said, "it is growing dark and we can walk about a
  little while without being observed."</p>

  <p>She picked up the bunch of snowdrops and went slowly through the pale
  fading light, passed the dusty likenesses of 'the dead and the mural tablets
  blurring into the shadows, and so came out through the heavy door into the
  little paved yard which was full of tombstones.</p>

  <p>He had followed her with a stealthy movement; she noted that he was light
  of foot.</p>

  <p>"Were you really praying just now?" she asked him as they come to pause
  side by side among the neat graves.</p>

  <p>"If I was, you would be scarcely able to understand why. Need we talk of
  that?"</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not. Tell me, sir, for how long are you in London? <i>Der
  König von Bayern</i> has sailed."</p>

  <p>"Yes, without me and without Dr. Schoppe. I don't think I'm going to South
  America. Everything has changed."</p>

  <p>"Oh, why?" smiled Belle. "You are the hero of the hour&mdash;they are
  getting up a public subscription for you, are they not? I believe that will
  amount to a great deal of money. After all, this mistake on the part of the
  police has proved very fortunate for you."</p>

  <p>When he did not reply nor look at her, but stood rigid with something of
  that fixity in his attitude that he had shown in the dock, she added:</p>

  <p>"This money, this public money, collected as an expression of horror and
  regret at the mistake made by the English police&mdash;it will be very useful
  to you, will it not, in your missionary efforts?"</p>

  <p>"What do you want from me?" he asked. "They will be locking up the church
  soon, and the woman mustn't come out and see us here."</p>

  <p>"Locking up the church?" smiled Belle. "There is nothing to treasure
  there. I wonder why they lock it." She added: "Let us walk along, it is
  certainly cold standing."</p>

  <p>They passed out of the tall, narrow, iron gates into the street; through
  the gathering evening vapours gleamed the last radiance of the faint winter
  sunlight. Belle luxuriously drew her warm, new, grey shawl about her
  shoulders; the young man stuck his chin in the collar of his coat and his
  hands into his pockets; they fell into step.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you want money?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Belle, "and at once. I suppose Dr. Schoppe told you what I
  said to him when I went to see him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he told me, and said he was a fool to have given you those five
  pounds, and that he regretted it, but at the time he was upset, half crazy.
  And now once he's begun to give you money, I suppose he must go on."</p>

  <p>"I suppose, so," said Belle. "But stop, let us look into this shop
  window." The lights were not yet lit, but they could see the case of boots
  and shoes. "Anyone who passes would take us for a young husband and wife.
  Look, you should be choosing me a pair of boots&mdash;those grey cloth ones
  with the black strappings, eh?"</p>

  <p>He did as she suggested, and stood staring through the plate-glass of the
  bootmaker's shop at the three or four pairs of ladies' boots arranged on
  wooden trees daintily arrayed on the shelves.</p>

  <p>"I want more than money," whispered Belle close to him.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Dr. Schoppe will have prepared you for my demands? I want a
  chance to get out from where I am. But there's no need to dwell on my
  business nor my prospects&mdash;we won't ever mention them again. It's quite
  enough for you to know that I'd decided to do for myself what someone else
  did for Daisy Arrow&mdash;and with the same weapon, too. Well, I hadn't the
  courage and I hadn't the interest."</p>

  <p>"What do you want of me?"</p>

  <p>"We shall come to that. There is no need for you to be impatient, Mr.
  Morl. After all, we shall probably have to meet quite a good deal and so
  become used to one another; but first we must find some place where we can
  talk."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you want!" He repeated his demand in a harsher tone.</p>

  <p>"I've said&mdash;a chance."</p>

  <p>"A chance of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of returning to the life I've left and doing something more worth while
  than anything I've been doing for some years now."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I can give you such a chance?"</p>

  <p>"Hush, don't speak so loud."</p>

  <p>"There is no one about," he replied, "let's walk on. The wind in the
  street seems to blow sharp as&mdash;a knife."</p>

  <p>"I had not noticed any wind at all, although it's cold."</p>

  <p>They walked slowly over the greasy, uneven pavements, he still with his
  hands in his pockets and she holding up her skirts; in the crook of her arm
  dangled her large new reticule.</p>

  <p>"First," said she, "I want sufficient money to enable me to leave the
  Cambridge, where I dance in rags every night to a stupid piece of music that
  I have heard so often that it's for ever beating in my brain. I loathe the
  place and the people I meet there. I want to disappear from that life and
  those people. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"How much money?"</p>

  <p>"Whatever you've brought with you. I suppose you didn't come
  empty-handed?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, I understood that it would be a case of blackmail!"</p>

  <p>"Don't use ugly words," said Belle, "I don't like them. I want to get away
  from vile language and odious terms."</p>

  <p>Without looking at her or taking any notice of her close presence, the
  young man said:</p>

  <p>"I've brought a hundred pounds with me&mdash;it was as much as I could get
  in English money. It seems to me quite enough. Perhaps you will take it and
  go away."</p>

  <p>"You must know," replied Belle, "that I'm not the same sort of woman as
  Daisy Arrow&mdash;a hundred pounds isn't so very much to me."</p>

  <p>"No?" he replied in an expressionless voice. "Well, perhaps what you can
  do for that hundred pounds is not so much to me. I have been acquitted of a
  very absurd charge, the mistake the police made is causing quite a
  scandal."</p>

  <p>"Quite a scandal," echoed Belle. "We had better be careful; we are in a
  neighbourhood where we are both quite well known; let us turn by the back
  streets towards the City, now we're beginning to get near the neighbourhood
  of Holborn again."</p>

  <p>Muttering, "I don't know my way about your infernal town," the young man
  followed Belle's directions.</p>

  <p>"Please walk quite close to me and listen clearly to what I have to say,"
  she said. "You think that a hundred pounds should be sufficient for the
  service I can render you. Now what do you think that service is?"</p>

  <p>"Merely not to lie about me. I know quite well that it is in your power to
  invent some sort of tale. You might, for instance, even have gone so far as
  to say that you saw me on Christmas morning&mdash;say on the stairs&mdash;say
  pausing on the landing; you might have identified that voice you heard as my
  voice. It was because Dr. Schoppe thought that you were a most dangerous and
  unscrupulous woman that he gave you the five pounds, and it's because I share
  his opinion, Miss Adair, that I'm willing to offer you a hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"It didn't occur to you that any of those other women living at No. 12
  were dangerous and unscrupulous?"</p>

  <p>"They didn't threaten us, they didn't try blackmail," replied the young
  clergyman, "they were content to speak the truth, miserable wretches that
  they were."</p>

  <p>"I should be quite content to speak the truth."</p>

  <p>"If you altered the tale you told in the witness-box, you would have to
  confess to perjury. I suppose you haven't forgotten that?"</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't, but that wouldn't matter very much; I should be let off
  quite lightly. I could make up a very good tale."</p>

  <p>"Could you? Do you think it would be believed?"</p>

  <p>They walked on towards the City through back ways; the vapour of dusk
  thickened around them. They were away from the route of the traffic, the
  omnibuses, cabs and private carriages taking business men home. Save for a
  few beggars, they had the dismal streets to themselves.</p>

  <p>"Need we prolong this?" asked the young man. "I cannot be away so long
  without being questioned as to my whereabouts. It is very difficult for
  me."</p>

  <p>"Why did you come at all?" asked Belle. "Why do you concern yourself about
  a poor, nameless, homeless woman, one of Mrs. Bulke's lodgers at No. 12,
  who's trying to blackmail you with a few lies? I should have thought you'd
  have gone to your advisers&mdash;to your Consul, to your lawyer&mdash;and put
  them on the track of the insolent wretch; besides, Mr. Morl," she said,
  peering round and up at his face through the thick vapours of the dusk, "it
  would very much add to the sympathy that the public feels for you, if they
  thought that such an atrocious trick was being played on you."</p>

  <p>"I don't want any more trouble. I don't want to hear anything about it at
  all. I loathe the sensation that is being made. I don't want their money or
  their apology, I want to get away&mdash;to forget. I've others to think
  of&mdash;Oh, God!"</p>

  <p>"I have not any others or any God to think of," said Belle. "I've only
  myself. I am in that position that I can concentrate upon myself. When I've
  thought of others I've made mistakes, I've been a fool through those others.
  Now, you understand, I'm just thinking of myself. You can give me before you
  leave me that hundred pounds, and we must meet again, and
  quickly&mdash;there's no time to lose."</p>

  <p>He put his hand into the bosom of his coat, the attitude with which she
  had become so familiar when he had stood in the dock.</p>

  <p>"I have the money here. Can't you let that be an end of it?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, it's only the beginning of it. You used the word 'blackmail' just
  now, and I didn't like it. Well, if you are thinking of blackmail, you ought
  to know that a blackmailer never stops."</p>

  <p>The young man paused, still with his hands in the bosom of his coat. He
  stared down at Belle; she noted with approval that he was a fine young
  creature, half a head taller than she was, for all her slender height;
  comely, unusual: why had she not noticed that before?</p>

  <p>"You have some courage," he said, with a quick smile that seemed for the
  first time to recognise her personality.</p>

  <p>"Have I? Yes, I think I was born fearless; it never helped me much."</p>

  <p>He looked at her keenly for the first time since they had met. She could
  see that he was forcing himself to this scrutiny&mdash;studying her with a
  dreadful curiosity and a lively apprehension, as she had studied him when he
  had stood in the dock. His strong teeth dragged at his lips as he stared at
  her under a dark frowning brow he moved back from her a scarcely perceptible
  pace.</p>

  <p>"I was wrong&mdash;you are not fearless, only infinitely
  degraded&mdash;you no longer know what fear is, nor shame, nor dignity, nor
  decency."</p>

  <p>Belle sighed, pulled her handkerchief from her wrist, and wiped her lips.
  "I've never cut anybody's throat."</p>

  <p>In reply, the young man took her elbow and moved her quickly forward,
  forcing her into a rapid walk.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand," he muttered hoarsely, "that it was a case of
  suicide, that was what those fools of police couldn't grasp&mdash;so busy
  hunting for a murderer&mdash;there is no murderer&mdash;they'll never find
  the murderer of Daisy Arrow, no such person exists."</p>

  <p>"That's quite clever," gasped Belle as they hurried along, "but you forget
  the water in the basin, the marks on the towel and even on her face&mdash;the
  print of a hand, you know."</p>

  <p>"How did <i>you</i> know?" he asked her suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's all in the evidence at the inquest and the magistrate's
  inquiry."</p>

  <p>"Was it?" he muttered to himself. "Was it?" Then impetuously: "But that's
  nothing to do with it&mdash;the truth is what neither you nor anyone seem to
  understand. She wounded herself and killed herself, and the unfortunate, the
  unhappy man who happened to be with her, tried to stanch the bleeding. There
  was a bandage round her throat, wasn't there?"</p>

  <p>Belle did not reply, but still hurried with him along over the foul
  pavement, past the blank, dark houses. Dusk was closing in on them; a street
  lamplighter moved a little ahead of them&mdash;one after another the
  gas-lamps flared up till there was a chain of dull lights ahead of them.</p>

  <p>"He tried to save her&mdash;to help her, in doing that he stained his
  hands and had to wash them."</p>

  <p>"Nobody," panted Belle, "would believe such a story. Is that what you
  would have brought forward if somebody had identified you definitely as the
  man who had been her companion? Is that what your lawyer suggested? What
  about the note-paper? The lost valise?"</p>

  <p>The young man did not reply. Belle said coolly:</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't do. It's the excuse every murderer brings up&mdash;suicide,
  and that he was afraid, so he tried to conceal it. Clever, but never any
  use."</p>

  <p>"Yet, you believe it, you must believe it, or I suppose you'd scarcely be
  here with me now. After all, Daisy Arrow wasn't the first woman of her class
  to get murdered, and won't be the last. I really lost the bag."</p>

  <p>"You're talking wildly," sighed Belle. "Step back under this lamp for a
  moment and let the lighter get a little further ahead of us. Now, you can
  give me the money; no one's watching us, I shan't be robbed. It's rather late
  for a respectable woman to be out alone in the street&mdash;after dark, eh?
  You may, if you please, take me back to my room. Tomorrow I shall be in a
  decent lodging. You lost the bag, but there was no note-paper in it."</p>

  <p>He stopped, as she suggested, and took his hand from his bosom with a
  package in it and gave it to her. She glanced at the notes in the elastic
  band and then transferred them to her bosom, unfastening two buttons of the
  tight, grey bodice.</p>

  <p>"Now cannot that be an end of it? Indeed, I think it's got to be an end of
  it. I shall not take any more notice of anything you say or do."</p>

  <p>"Don't waste time," she replied, "with talk like that. I must see you
  again to-morrow. I've got some property of yours to return. Come, let us go
  back. It is very dismal here, so cold, so dark."</p>

  <p>The young man was silent. Belle noticed, and with admiration, his control,
  which she was sure he was having a hard fight to maintain. Only when he had
  advanced his theory that the death of Daisy Arrow was a suicide had he shown
  any emotion, and that had died down as quickly as it had flared up; quickly
  he had been cold again, cold as hell, she had thought, thinking of that
  picture of <i>The Last Judgment</i> she could not get out of her mind.</p>

  <p>Belle did not find it necessary to say anything at all. They walked side
  by side until they were within a few yards of where she lodged in Holborn.
  Then she paused and asked:</p>

  <p>"You heard what I said?&mdash;that I'll give you your property."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"I shall have to explain it all&mdash;but not here, to-morrow afternoon in
  the Museum&mdash;in the long sculpture gallery."</p>

  <p>"I cannot come." He spoke with a hint of anguish breaking his control. "It
  will cause suspicion&mdash;I shall be questioned."</p>

  <p>"That is your affair. You must come, Mr. Morl, it's very important."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They met behind the monstrous sarcophagus of dark granite,
whose heavy
  shadow darkened the already heavy gloom of the sculpture gallery. Either side
  of them were towering statues of uncouth gods looming into obscurity; the air
  was close and stale, yet chilly.</p>

  <p>When they peered round the involved shadows they could see winged, crowned
  creatures, inhuman and implacable, dark as midnight and gigantic beyond the
  horrid enlargement of dreams.</p>

  <p>They had met without difficulty behind one of the pillars of the portico
  that was so large that they had appeared to themselves and each other as
  dwarfed and insignificant.</p>

  <p>For a while they had wandered in the enclosed winter half-light of the
  gallery, neither speaking. Then they had paused behind the sarcophagus; save
  for one or two sightseers, who silently and, it seemed, timidly tiptoed
  through the galleries, they were alone.</p>

  <p>His first words came unexpectedly to her ear:</p>

  <p>"What has happened to the snowdrops you wore yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"They became soiled and faded and I threw them away."</p>

  <p>There was a small highly-polished bench against the wall; behind it there
  was in a glass case a portion of sandstone frieze traced with figures in
  violent red and blue.</p>

  <p>She seated herself and invited him to do so also.</p>

  <p>"I see you have changed your attire," he muttered, "to mourning and a
  crape veil."</p>

  <p>"I, have changed everything since yesterday," she answered. "I have found
  a decent room in Gower Street: Everything that I possessed, at least nearly
  everything that I possessed, everything except the contents of a certain
  carpet-bag, I have destroyed. Another woman will dance the 'Moss Rose' waltz
  to-night at the Cambridge. They think that I have gone away to Paris. I have
  left no trace with anyone."</p>

  <p>"Or so you think," he answered. "What you try to do will not be easy to
  accomplish; you are of a very theatrical turn of mind&mdash;all these tricks
  are very effective until someone tries to find you out."</p>

  <p>"But nobody will," answered Belle. "I'm not important enough." She added
  in a low, confidential tone: "I see you, too have changed your
  attire&mdash;that is another coat from that you were wearing yesterday. You
  buy your clothes in London, sometimes ready-made, like your handkerchiefs,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"I have no wish to be recognised; if you'd look at the papers you would
  see that I have become a person of importance. I have had a letter of apology
  from your Prime Minister&mdash;I am invited to see him, the public sent him
  large sums for a subscription to be opened for my benefit."</p>

  <p>He spoke without irony or humour; he attracted Belle more than she had
  believed it possible he could do. He had interested her as a prisoner in the
  dock; she had thought him wild and wilful, a little effeminate&mdash;somewhat
  raw; there was, in reality, she decided, nothing of those defects about him
  He had none of the qualities she disliked; he possessed, on the contrary, the
  qualities that she much admired, cool elegance of mind and person, of speech
  and gesture, hard sophistication&mdash;he seemed a man who had fashioned his
  own personality to his own liking as she had fashioned her own personality to
  her own liking.</p>

  <p>But he had been successful where she had failed&mdash;yet not so
  successful either. Was he not, seated beside her now, hiding, under his
  hard-fought-for reserve, torment of humiliation and rage?</p>

  <p>She liked him well enough to endeavour, before she came directly to her
  business (which was, of course, her chief, almost her only concern), to
  reassure what she guessed must be his private apprehension and alarm.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to suppose," she said in a very low tone, after glancing
  round the sarcophagus to see if there was any possible spy impinging on them,
  "that I was carried away by all this hue and cry and clamour&mdash;about the
  murder, I mean&mdash;I shouldn't altogether loathe and despise whoever it was
  that put an end to Daisy Arrow. Understand me&mdash;I should not shrink from
  such a man or dread him or fear him; I think there might be a good reason; I
  don't think that she was worth very much. I haven't any longer conventional
  ideas of morality of these things."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," he replied in a tone that was even lower than hers.
  "Daisy Arrow killed herself."</p>

  <p>"Oh well," said Belle, "at any rate, the whole affair has proved very
  fortunate for you&mdash;I must make my count out of it, too."</p>

  <p>She hesitated&mdash;she who so seldom hesitated&mdash;for a moment; then
  studied his outline, which was almost as dark as the surroundings; though he
  was not in complete mourning, he was most soberly dressed. She wished she
  knew more of his history. That tale now&mdash;it seemed to satisfy the
  police&mdash;about the noble wealthy youth giving up everything to enter the
  Church&mdash;good works&mdash;the missionary efforts&mdash;engagement to a
  girl like Lili Schoppe. Nonsense, thought Belle; but that was no business of
  hers nor pertinent to the matter in hand; she must be careful not to confuse
  issues nor to lose sight of her own advantage.</p>

  <p>"I daresay," she whispered, "you are a little curious about me. I confess
  I am a little curious about you, but we cannot indulge ourselves; perhaps in
  time we shall find out more about one another."</p>

  <p>"I hope," said he, looking down at the cold stone of the pavement, "I
  shall never see you again."</p>

  <p>"But you will certainly see me again, sir. I want you to take me with you
  when you return to Germany."</p>

  <p>He sat so still that he did not seem even to breathe, the shadows and his
  dark clothing, his hunched and huddled attitude gave him an uncouth shape, a
  harsh outline almost like that of one of the statues of the menacing
  half-gods, half-monsters, behind him.</p>

  <p>Belle put forward what she had to say in concise, carefully rehearsed
  words; it was so important that he should understand her earnestness, should
  not in the least mistake her intentions, should not for a second endeavour to
  make her swerve from them.</p>

  <p>"Over here I can do nothing. It would be too difficult. As you yourself
  remarked just now&mdash;any poor pretences I might put about myself could
  soon be torn away. I want to start again, I want to have another chance. I am
  only seven-and-twenty&mdash;younger, I think, by five years than you are. You
  must know what it is to want another chance, you must have felt that as you
  stood in the dock. Well, you got it, didn't you? I want mine."</p>

  <p>"Through me?" he asked in a low voice, so low that the two words seemed
  blended in one sigh.</p>

  <p>"Of course, who else is there?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose Dr. Schoppe will help you?"</p>

  <p>She put her proposal before him flatly.</p>

  <p>He was to allow her to come to Germany under his protection and that of
  his friends; he was to introduce her somehow to some post in his native
  country&mdash;governess, companion, secretary&mdash;where she might begin a
  new life, find a fresh foothold in society. She assured him that she had
  credentials, that she had been in such posts before; it would only be a
  question of altering the names and dates and that she was able to do. No one
  must ever associate her with Belle Adair. Dr. Schoppe would know, of course,
  so would Lili his daughter, "but she will lie for you like she did before,"
  smiled Belle quietly, "in the witness-box."</p>

  <p>He looked at her over his shoulder, only his eyes visible above the
  upturned collar of his coat, his words coming muffled through the thick
  cloth.</p>

  <p>"Lili did not lie for me, she told the truth; but, of course, I couldn't
  have her brought into this or in the company of a woman like yourself.
  Neither could I take you to my own country and introduce you to anyone.
  Besides, I don't know who needs a companion or a governess."</p>

  <p>"No doubt there will be difficulties," conceded Belle, "but they are your
  difficulties, not mine. I don't expect to go into court society or even into
  city life, at least not at once. I want respectability about me again; I want
  to be treated like a gentlewoman; I want to have servants under me and
  respectable women as my friends; I want to have a chance to show my talents.
  There are quite a number of things I can do very well&mdash;sketch for one,
  Mr. Morl. I am most clever at sketching likenesses, from life and from
  memory. I am well educated," she added, "I can speak French and German; I
  know the piano. Well, never mind my accomplishments, I shall not disgrace
  you, whatever post you decide for me."</p>

  <p>"How could I possibly," he said, "explain you after all this scandal, this
  uproar here in London?&mdash;how bring you back with me?"</p>

  <p>"You could arrange that with Dr. Schoppe, I suppose, like you arranged,
  well, other things&mdash;your alibi for one."</p>

  <p>"I arranged nothing with Dr. Schoppe. You are mistaken again."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, your lawyer did. You know you weren't present at that ball
  that party&mdash;whatever they called it&mdash;on Christmas Eve."</p>

  <p>"Was I not? There were a great number of people who said I was."</p>

  <p>"They were either bribed or confused. I've been to the hotel. I have a
  list of their festivities for Christmas week; there was one every night. I
  heard from Mr. Matchwell that that was quite an easy way to fake an
  alibi&mdash;to transfer the events of one day to those of another. No doubt,
  some of those people gave what they thought was honest evidence."</p>

  <p>"There was no concocted tale," he insisted sternly, "nobody told a
  lie."</p>

  <p>"I think the little girl did. Why was she so overwhelmed? Why wasn't she
  better pleased when you got off?"</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that young, innocent people suffer needless emotion owing to
  sheer delicacy of feeling."</p>

  <p>"Bah! Lili had been over-persuaded or bullied by her father or your lawyer
  or your friends into giving the testimony that she did."</p>

  <p>"Lili couldn't lie," he protested in a faint voice. "It would kill her to
  tell a falsehood."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it <i>will</i> kill her," said Belle, "but it's no concern of
  mine. I don't think she'll be difficult, though I'm worried about it a
  little. She may suspect me and hate me, but after all, I suppose she knows
  nothing; she doesn't even understand me very well. She was quite ill from
  shock and that effort she made to give false witness, I suppose. Don't try to
  deceive me; whoever was speaking the truth, she wasn't, and she knew it,"
  added Belle firmly, peering through the shadows.</p>

  <p>"We won't speak of her, Miss Adair."</p>

  <p>"As you please. I would, indeed, rather speak of myself. But I am no
  longer Miss Adair&mdash;I am Miss Rastell, my mother's name, I have a certain
  right to it."</p>

  <p>"All these masquerades are fantastic." But he made no effort to leave her
  or to bring the conversation to a close.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we are getting too wordy, and that is what I wish to avoid. But it
  is difficult, with a few sentences, to make everything clear."</p>

  <p>"There are some things, however, madame, that I must have clear. You say
  that you have some property of mine."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes."</p>

  <p>"And that you were minded to return it."</p>

  <p>"Did I? Well, I haven't got it with me now, but I will show it to you
  soon. It is very inconvenient that we should have to meet like
  this&mdash;isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"What can it be that you have in mind? I think you are merely trying to
  gain a hold over me."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you one thing," said Belle rapidly ("speak very low, there are
  two people coming to look at the sarcophagus, or don't speak at all. No, they
  have merely gaped and moved on. What fools to come to this place to look at
  these monstrous horrors in the half-dark!). Well, what was I
  saying&mdash;some property of yours? Yes, a letter you wrote once, several
  years ago, and I have it. It was given me by Mr. Roger Owen&mdash;that's
  Daisy Arrow's brother, Martha Owen was her real name, you know."</p>

  <p>The two sightseers, heavy country folk, came round the black sarcophagus,
  and stared sheepishly at the young man and woman as if they feared they had
  disturbed two lovers hiding from prying curiosity in this gloomy seclusion.
  Then they were gone and there was only the echo of their footfalls in the
  high dreary gallery with the lowering statues, half-men, half-beasts,
  half-gods and half-angels; it seemed as if a moment of rigidity had given a
  false likeness of coherence to chaos.</p>

  <p>The young man and the young woman remained sitting on the pale, shiny,
  varnished bench, she in her cheap ready-made, slightly ill-fitting mourning,
  with the heavy crape veil; he, in his clumsy ready-made overcoat, both of
  them thus disguised, not only from possible enemies, but from themselves.</p>

  <p>Belle respected her opponent's silence, which she took to be a flag of
  truce held out while he arranged the terms of his proffered capitulation; but
  he was not so near surrender as she supposed.</p>

  <p>When he did speak it was to mutter:</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you could prove anything."</p>

  <p>She replied at once and with deadly emphasis:</p>

  <p>"Daisy Arrow's murderer left something behind in her room."</p>

  <p>At this he turned and stared at her&mdash;she saw nothing but the dark,
  tired, strained eyes above the thick coat collar.</p>

  <p>"If he had, the police would have found it."</p>

  <p>"No," said Belle, "I was there before the police."</p>

  <p>He turned his head away&mdash;she saw his profile sharply cut, as if in
  black paper, against the blur of light sent from the high-placed window.</p>

  <p>The keeper's bell sounded&mdash;a dismal clang echoing beyond the
  gallery&mdash;"All out, all out."</p>

  <p>"Do you hear? Closing time," said Belle, rising. "Come along, we must not
  attract attention by lingering here."</p>

  <p>He rose also and said on a half-sigh:</p>

  <p>"Very well, I will come and see you to-morrow morning. What is your
  address?"</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the neat, drab little parlour which, having housed so
many different
  individualities, had retained no impression of any of these individualities,
  Belle turned over a pile of newspapers and read the different accounts,
  written from varying angles, of the scandalous mistake of the police in the
  affair of Daisy Arrow and the crime at No. 12, Great Hogarth Street; and of
  the national remorse so widespread and so sincere, towards the
  falsely-accused young man.</p>

  <p>Oh, there was so much in his favour! He was a German, he was a clergyman;
  he was of romantic good looks, and given to a career of impeccable piety. A
  most regrettable, a most dreadful mistake had indeed been made. The British
  Government had offered compensation: Mr. Morl's fare, nay the fares of all
  his friends and their expenses during their involuntary detention in London,
  either to South America, which was supposed to be their destination, or back
  to Germany, if their plans had been altered through the ghastly misfortune
  they had so unhappily encountered in London. The Prime Minister's letter to
  the aggrieved young pastor was printed in full in the papers; not only was
  the Government prepared to pay the cost of the defence and all other possible
  expenses incurred through the mistake of the police, but wrote Mr. Lestrange
  of the Treasury:</p>

  <p class="letter">I am further desired by the Prime Minister to request you
  to express to Mr. Morl his sympathy for the painful position in which he has
  been placed.</p>

  <p>Belle folded up the papers neatly, relaxed in the deep, comfortable
  arm-chair, placing her hands gracefully behind her small head, and stared
  down at the large fire.</p>

  <p>Yes, this was an improvement on her life of the last few years; warmth and
  good food, clean rooms with decent clothes, and a little maid to say "ma'am"
  to her.</p>

  <p>She was very pleased that she had been able, in her equivocal
  circumstances, to find such a respectable lodging. It had not been easy for
  her, a single woman with new luggage, to persuade the silly respectable
  little landlady into accepting her. But Belle had done it with her cool easy
  manner and her quietly affecting story of the death of her sole surviving
  parent and the following necessity of her coming to London to settle her
  affairs, and her casual display of a pocket-book full of notes to show that
  she was able to pay well for everything. She was so obviously correct in her
  behaviour; her clothes, her manner, her luggage, everything about her was so
  exactly as the landlady had thought it should be, that she had been, only a
  few hours after leaving the Cambridge Theatre for the last time, placidly
  installed in this decent harbourage.</p>

  <p>The success of this first move and the comfort of these genteel
  surroundings were like a strong cordial to her, while the thought of the sum
  of money&mdash;nearly eighty pounds&mdash;unspent, locked away upstairs in
  her new trunk, was to her the source of almost inexhaustible contentment.</p>

  <p>She lay there at her ease, the reflection of the tall leaping flame
  gleaming in the folds of her full black skirt. She smiled with irony at
  herself; she was quite capable of mocking at the idiosyncrasies, the
  contradictions, the twists and the turns she found in her own character.</p>

  <p>This was really a dingy, ugly room in a dingy, ugly house, and she had
  been forced to buy hideous clothes&mdash;funereal, unbecoming&mdash;all the
  pretty things she had seen in the shops in her hurried visit that morning she
  had been obliged to forgo.</p>

  <p>Yet, she was full of joy, she the very woman who only a few years ago
  would have refused to set foot in such a house as this, who would have
  refused to wear such clothes as these, who would have scornfully rejected
  anything less than luxury, gaiety and beauty.</p>

  <p>"Strange, indeed," she mocked to herself, "that a short time in houses
  like No. 12, a brief period in work like that I was doing at the Cambridge,
  and a few weeks of walking the streets, should make me so greedy of this
  scarecrow, respectability, like a starving dog is greedy of a drink in a
  puddle, or a rotten bone. Of what value is this place? I am superior to the
  woman who keeps it and everyone else who has ever lived here. Probably at
  heart she is no better than Mrs. Bulke, and I daresay not so good company.
  Those two pinched-looking spinsters on the first floor&mdash;they're not so
  amusing as Florrie and May, and I don't suppose that red-nosed chit of a
  servant girl is as good-hearted as poor Moll."</p>

  <p>She looked around her with contempt.</p>

  <p>"Everything here is ugly&mdash;the wall-paper, the furniture, the
  pictures, the carpet&mdash;detestable. Yet, I am thankful to be
  here&mdash;and quite happy in this pretence of being a poor, quiet, country
  creature&mdash;bereaved, alone in London, looking for work."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">She heard the bell ring and the maid go to the door. She
did not move from
  her careless attitude.</p>

  <p>He was punctual; the black marble clock gave the exact hour that she had
  indicated; it was well that he should from the first learn to be
  obedient.</p>

  <p>But her complacency turned to rage when the door opened and the maid's "A
  gentleman to see you, miss," introduced Dr. Schoppe.</p>

  <p>She kept her head, however, instantly reflecting that this
  benevolent-looking elderly man would keep up her character in the house; he
  would pass very well for the family doctor or lawyer, or some uncle, or her
  father's friend, as long as he was not already too notorious in London, and
  recognised even by these sober people who never, of course, went to the
  police courts and seldom, she supposed, read the reports of criminal cases in
  the papers.</p>

  <p>Belle had been forced to rise for the sake of appearances in front of the
  maid when Dr. Schoppe had entered, had even greeted him with some appearance
  of cordiality. But when the door had closed she flung herself again in the
  deep arm-chair in a casual attitude, and said at once:</p>

  <p>"This is all a waste of time, you know. It is your friend whom I want to
  see."</p>

  <p>"He is my friend," replied the German stoutly, "and I am in his
  confidence. That's why I am here. He cannot come, it was most unwise of him
  to see you again. His time is scarcely his own. You know what people do for
  him."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I was reading about it&mdash;a subscription of money, a letter
  from the Prime Minister."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and other things, too. He is much in favour. The Prime Minister has
  asked him to wait on him. People are very indignant at this dreadful
  mistake."</p>

  <p>"I've just been reading all that in the paper," said Belle energetically,
  "So don't let us waste time talking about it. Don't you know me by now, Dr.
  Schoppe. You say you are in your friend's confidence&mdash;then he has told
  you what I want. Are you returning to Germany?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, we do not now go to Brazil&mdash;all that is changed."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Belle directly. "Mr. Morl has been triumphantly cleared, has
  he not? He will have all this extra money to spend among the heathens, or the
  savages, or whatever they are, out there."</p>

  <p>"I have my daughter."</p>

  <p>"Ah, she won't go, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"No, my poor girl prefers to return to our own country&mdash;to
  Germany."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Mr. Morl has told you what I want of you&mdash;some
  introduction to some decent post. I needn't go all over it again, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No, you needn't go over it again," replied Dr. Schoppe heavily. "I may
  sit down? You did not ask me, but I am very tired."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sit down, but I don't think we shall have much to say to one
  another."</p>

  <p>The stout man sat down wearily with a little groan, which Belle did not
  think was caused by physical distress.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said in a low, but emphatic voice. "What you ask is
  impossible. I could not have you associated with my daughter. Besides, she
  would recognise you. You have been kind&mdash;we were foreigners, and you
  helped us in a most dreadful situation-that is understood. We have made our
  acknowledgment."</p>

  <p>"A hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, a hundred and five pounds, is it not? We can do no
  more," said Dr. Schoppe, wiping his forehead and breathing quickly. "You must
  understand that we can do no more. You can have nothing to say that would be
  of the least interest to the police; besides, the case is closed."</p>

  <p>"It could soon be opened again. But, sir, I don't want to argue about it.
  We could lose ourselves in words about this business. I am quite ready to
  return to Germany with you. I could take a passage on the same boat, or on
  the same train if you go overland; I can arrange that our departure together
  will not be in the least conspicuous. Then when we are in Germany, I will
  come forward under the name I now use and you and your friends must introduce
  me to some decent means of earning my livelihood. Is it so much to ask?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," conceded Dr. Schoppe, speaking uneasily and glancing from
  side to side, down at the pattern of crimson roses in the new carpet.
  "Perhaps not, naturally one likes to help the unfortunate. In return for what
  you have done for us it would be pleasant to give you a fresh start, but we
  know no such household where you would be acceptable. We are not aware of any
  lady who is looking for a companion; if we knew of such a one, how could we
  guarantee that she would accept you on our recommendation?"</p>

  <p>"That may be," said Belle coolly, "but, as I told Mr. Morl yesterday,
  these difficulties are yours, not mine."</p>

  <p>"I have to think of my daughter, I have to think of my daughter."</p>

  <p>"Think of her as much as you please, Dr. Schoppe, but I have to think of
  myself. If there is no one who is likely to be able to offer me a place, you
  must one of you take me into your own home."</p>

  <p>"Ah, not that! You are a woman of sense&mdash;you must understand that you
  ask the impossible!"</p>

  <p>"Please, Dr. Schoppe, this is a quiet house and I don't wish attention
  attracted to us. Will you lower your voice? Your heard my terms."</p>

  <p>"Terms! You name them <i>terms</i>."</p>

  <p>"Oh," exclaimed Belle impatiently and wearily, "I find all this so
  tedious. Perhaps you have no establishment to which I could go. I do not know
  if you are a widower or not. But the young clergyman, Mr. Morl, he has a
  mother. Well, I take it she is not so young. Surely he has sufficient
  influence with her to decide that she requires a companion&mdash;a quiet,
  cultured Englishwoman, kind to him and his Lili during their great trouble in
  London, of which, of course, she will hear something, if not everything, or
  even very much?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Schoppe made a gesture with his thick hand as if violently repelled by
  this suggestion; he controlled himself and remarked quietly:</p>

  <p>"You would not like it, she's a very quiet lady and lives in just an
  ordinary house in the woods, what you would call a villa&mdash;nothing
  splendid, no life, no gaiety, not the kind of time you want."</p>

  <p>"You don't know the kind of time I want," smiled Belle. "You don't know
  what I've been through, how I've suffered. But never mind. I should like
  that&mdash;a house in the woods&mdash;it would mean repose, quiet; besides, I
  suppose she doesn't always live in her country house, she might go to town
  sometimes; I mightn't even stay there long. I just want a place where I can
  get my health and strength&mdash;I'm not so well as I used to be&mdash;where
  I could learn to forget things. I've a good deal to forget, Dr. Schoppe. You
  see I'm young enough to want to start again. It would satisfy me quite well
  if Pastor Morl would take me to live with his mother."</p>

  <p>"It's a disgusting and shameful thing to ask," broke from the stiff lips
  of the German.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Belle, "it's a disgusting and shameful thing that I am
  asked to conceal."</p>

  <p>"If you refer to the death of that miserable woman, I would to God she had
  never been born. It was suicide; an unfortunate coincidence&mdash;a devilish
  combination of circumstances. My friend is innocent, do you hear? If it were
  not so could he still be my friend?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," replied Belle. "You are all strangers to me.
  But I do know enough to make you all uneasy if I spoke."</p>

  <p>"Do you, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it wouldn't be very pleasant, would it, for this pious young
  clergyman, or for his betrothed wife, your daughter Lili, an innocent young
  girl, if I said what I know. Why, he might as well confess to being the
  murderer, as confess to being Daisy Arrow's companion that night at No.
  12."</p>

  <p>Dr. Schoppe stared at her, then put his thick hand before his eyes.</p>

  <p>Belle continued rapidly and with emphasis:</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you all arranged to do, or how many lies you've told.
  That alibi was never looked into&mdash;there was great prejudice in his
  favour&mdash;because of his nationality and profession, I suppose, and the
  sheer unlikelihood of the crime. Why, a little more cross-examination and the
  whole defence would have broken down! You know you just shifted that
  entertainment and all those events, the sleeping powders and what-not, from
  one night to another. You may have persuaded yourself that you were speaking
  the truth, but I'm sure Lili wasn't persuaded. She's a very pious girl, I'm
  sure; it nearly killed her to stand up there and say those lies, just because
  you bullied her into believing they weren't lies and because she knew her
  darling sweetheart might be hanged if she didn't say them."</p>

  <p>"You've no right to talk like that. Every word you say you make it more
  impossible for me&mdash;for us&mdash;to take you to Germany. Is there
  anything else you want? Money?&mdash;we could find more with this
  subscription coming in, though Maarten Morl is not really wealthy."</p>

  <p>"No, money's no use to me in England. I could never begin again here. I've
  no talent for the stage. I couldn't straighten things out that way&mdash;by
  making a success on the stage or as a dancer. Besides, I've tried that type
  of life and I don't want it."</p>

  <p>"But you might live another kind of life. You might get married with a
  little dowry, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to get married. I don't want any love affairs; I'm sick of
  all that too, and I don't want to be a kept woman or to walk the streets. I
  want comfort and protection, ease of mind and self-respect. Perhaps it's a
  matter of mood&mdash;for the moment, I want those things. I see my chance of
  getting them."</p>

  <p>"You could get them in this country; you have managed to come here, change
  your name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This wouldn't last long; it would all fall to pieces on the first
  investigation. I've had to pretend that I've got relatives, but I couldn't
  produce them. I can't live like a hermit. Every kind of society is closed to
  me except that kind I loathe. It's only in another country that I've any
  chance. Do you hear?" she cried almost, at the end of her nerves. "Do you
  hear?"</p>

  <p>"I hear, but we cannot do it."</p>

  <p>"Then there's something I can do, Dr. Schoppe. As your friend has told you
  so much, hasn't he told you about those letters I've got? There is something
  else, too, he left behind in Daisy Arrow's room&mdash;a little Bible with
  your daughter's name in it. Would you like me to return it to her and tell
  her how I got it? What about the valise with the note-paper? A silly
  tale!"</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle's cab slowed to a decorous pace, following the hired
carriage
  proceeding to the Prime Minister's residence.</p>

  <p>She had forced her victim to keep her informed of all his actions; so far,
  he had not dared to disobey. There had been a hint of this honour in the
  newspapers, but from him had come the precise place and hour.</p>

  <p>She dismissed the cab at the corner of the street; an east wind was
  blowing up from the river; she shivered a little and luxuriously drew about
  her her thick warm black shawl. It gave her a sense of delicious
  luxury&mdash;being thus cosily clad against the cold, and feeling good
  leather under her feet and thick gloves on her hands. She enjoyed paying the
  cabman so handsomely that he saluted her with great respect.</p>

  <p>All these things were good, the outward signs of success. She gripped her
  reticule closely, pleased to think of its comforting contents, not only the
  purse, well-filled with money, but the tiny linen handkerchief, the cut-glass
  scent bottle, the little rose-coloured cachous in the pretty pink box. Belle,
  in the midst of her self-satisfaction, yet smiled
  secretly&mdash;ironically.</p>

  <p>How very low she had been brought, to rejoice so acutely in this
  newly-acquired comfort and this safety! Two years ago she would have despised
  a hired cab, and considered this mourning outfit hideous; two years ago her
  bag would have been full of elegant trifles in gold, and she would not have
  had thick soles to her shoes, because she would have been riding in a
  carriage and her delicate slippers would scarcely have ever touched the
  pavement.</p>

  <p>She reached a small group of people gathered outside the railings of the
  Prime Minister's house, which was so grey, heavy and bleak that it had the
  air rather of a monument than of a dwelling. News had been whispered here and
  there, by the considerable number of people who had arrived to see what they
  could of an odd occasion; a clergyman, falsely accused of murder, wait upon
  the minister who was to express a nation's distress at an outrageous
  error.</p>

  <p>Belle slipped into the crowd&mdash;one more quietly-dressed woman of whom
  no one took any notice. The glance she darted from behind her veil showed her
  that her companions were in a considerable state of emotion; many of the
  women wept and the men seemed uneasy and moved.</p>

  <p>As the hired carriage stopped and Maarten Morl descended, there was a low
  murmur of pity and friendliness among the onlookers. Several of the men
  raised their hats&mdash;several of the women said timidly: "God bless you,
  sir," and many whispered to each other in excited tones, comments on the
  young man's good looks and fine bearing, and on the unforgivable stupidity of
  the police in even suspecting him of any crime whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Belle saw him glance apprehensively to right and left; she had the
  satisfaction of knowing that so now he would always glance.</p>

  <p>He was looking for her? yes, he had seen her. As she smiled behind her
  veil he passed, with an increased stiffness in his carriage, into the large
  gloomy house, the ponderous door of which opened and closed on him with
  silent ease.</p>

  <p>Belle would have liked to be present at that interview. She had tormented
  herself, trying to think of some excuse for accompanying him. She had
  invented several adroit and plausible tales, but she was clever enough to
  know that none of these would have been accepted. Only a hair-line after all
  separated her present from her former life, and unless she were very careful
  she might at any moment be recognised as Belle Adair, who had lodged with
  Mrs. Bulke at No. 12, who had the next room to that occupied by the murdered
  girl. A pity she had had to be a witness at the inquest and the trial. Yet,
  that had been inevitable. At least, she had been able to remind him of
  herself, even at the very last minute before the important interview; it
  would be difficult for him to forget her; the thought of her might even make
  him falter a little in the smooth demeanour which she both admired and
  envied.</p>

  <p>She listened with relish to the comments of the crowd, their sympathy was
  deep and indignant; a woman's refined voice sighed:</p>

  <p>"So charming a young man engaged on so noble a work!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was interested in the labours of the missionaries. It was at once
  a fashion, a cult, an article of faith and a social amusement to follow
  eagerly the activities of the missionaries&mdash;to encourage them, to work
  for them, to read their books and listen to their lectures.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," thought Belle, walking up and down on the edge of the crowd to
  keep herself warm, "if anyone here, or even in London, knows much or cares
  anything about those savages, or whatever they are, in Brazil? I wonder what
  it would really be like to go to those queer hot places and preach
  Christianity to the heathens? I wonder if that young man taking sanctuary in
  that hideous house will ever again try to convert anyone&mdash;in Brazil or
  anywhere else."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The scene at which Belle would have given so much to be
present she
  visualised thus: it took place in the Prime Minister's study at the back of
  the house&mdash;a room too lofty for elegance and too heavily furnished for
  comfort, but impressive in its air of austerity and grandeur. All the pieces
  of furniture, dark and highly-polished, were too large for the room; the
  windows with the enormous red velvet curtains, every fold of which was
  precisely in place, were too tall for the walls. On a huge desk were the
  gloomy essentials of writing&mdash;blotting-pad, ink-stand, pen, all without
  ornamentation. An enormous bust of some heathen statesman&mdash;frowning,
  with a toga knotted over a bare chest&mdash;stood in a niche between two
  columns of cases filled with pious works and books of reference. The gas in
  an opal globe had just been lit, and the manservant who had preceded the
  young German into the study, drew the dark curtains over the pale, thickening
  twilight.</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister was of a piece with his house, and his
  room&mdash;massive, imposing, with an air of immutability, and a refusal at
  once bland and rigid to concede to any changes of thought or fashion that
  should not first be thoroughly inspected and completely approved of by
  himself. Seldom could a statesman have been more typical of his country and
  of his moment. In person he was like a clever drawing done swiftly by an
  adroit artist, the heavy features put in with bold lines, the stiff-coated
  figure and the white collar done with a few angular sweeps of the brush.</p>

  <p>He received the young German with a stiff graciousness, but his small,
  deep-set eyes were lively with curiosity and interest. He kept his large,
  shapely white hands outspread on the blotting-pad before him and looked at
  them now and then during the conversation, as if he were surprised into
  recognition of anything so vital as those strong fingers and stout wrists as
  belonging to his own reserved personality, which he contrived to make appear
  as rectitude, honour, and all the essentials of the English character
  embodied, as if, indeed, he were no man, but a symbol of Protestantism and of
  England.</p>

  <p>With aristocratic ease he began to speak, regretting, in smooth and
  conventional tones and frowns, the hideous mistake made by the police.</p>

  <p>"It certainly shows, Herr Morl, a strange lack of judgment on the part of
  Superintendent Matchwell&mdash;who was, I understand, in charge of the
  case&mdash;that he should have arrested you on suspicion of a crime so
  sordid, so atrocious. That note-paper was no clue at all."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the young man, sitting upright in his plain dark clothes on
  the horsehair chair which the manservant had placed for him. "Yes, sir, most
  sordid and most atrocious."</p>

  <p>"But your alibi was complete. Need I say I was overjoyed, overwhelmed with
  relief? Yes, the expression would scarcely be too strong. Believe me, sir,
  the British Government would have been profoundly distressed had that alibi
  not been complete. Had there," continued the Prime Minister, with an emphasis
  on his well-rounded words, "had there been the least loop-hole for suspicion,
  the sensation&mdash;the scandal&mdash;would have been as tremendous as
  regrettable."</p>

  <p>A faint spasm passed over the pale set features of the young man</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand how I came to find myself," he said, "in such a
  position. Indeed, sir, it is all incomprehensible to me&mdash;like an evil
  dream."</p>

  <p>"Severest measures shall be taken that no such mistake is possible in the
  future, that no other unfortunate foreigner&mdash;But I can see that I
  distress you, sir. It is obvious that you have suffered a great shock. I had
  hoped that my letter of sympathy might in some degree make amends."</p>

  <p>"You have, indeed," said Herr Morl in his laboured voice, "done, sir, all
  that it was in anyone's power to do&mdash;your tact, your
  graciousness&mdash;indeed, my most profound thanks." He began to speak
  incoherently, he pulled out his handkerchief and pressed it to his lips,
  while he stared across the noble head of the statesman, the fine massive
  forehead with the thick greying hair, at the monstrous bust of the placid
  hero with the blank eyeballs and knotted toga.</p>

  <p>"Your emotion does you credit, Herr Morl. If there is any further way in
  which I can help&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The young man broke in, "No, sir, no. If I could only get away&mdash;leave
  London&mdash;your pardon! I interrupted you, I forget even my manners."</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister bent his head in stately acknowledgment of the apology.
  He was not, indeed, used to interruptions, but he magnanimously made
  allowances for the peculiar poignancy of the young man's situation.</p>

  <p>"I need hardly ask you, Herr Morl, whether you have ever, in the course of
  your visits to our capital (and I believe these have not been infrequent),
  been in such places as those mentioned in the investigation?"</p>

  <p>He stared down at his hands, now beating a lively little tattoo on the
  blotter.</p>

  <p>"What places, sir?" asked the young German stupidly.</p>

  <p>"The Alhambra and the Argyll Rooms, where this poor, wretched, unfortunate
  creature plied her trade, Herr Mort, plied her trade."</p>

  <p>"I know, indeed, nothing of such haunts," replied the young man with a
  haughty awkwardness; "why should I? And this time specially&mdash;I come here
  with my father-in-law-to-be and my betrothed."</p>

  <p>"So I understand, so I understand," replied the minister in soothing
  tones; "that is what makes your case so shocking. It must have been a sad
  trial for the poor young lady."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, but she is not a weakling, she was prepared to be a
  missionary's wife&mdash;to go out with me to Brazil, to work, even to suffer
  in a strange and unknown land."</p>

  <p>"Ah yes, indeed; so much I learned, so much I approve"&mdash;again the
  Prime Minister made a short gracious bow&mdash;"but those kinds of fatigue
  and trouble would be very different from what she was, so regrettably, forced
  to undergo in London."</p>

  <p>The young German did not reply. He had the air of being exhausted and
  having come to the end of his nervous force.</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister permitted a slight tinge of surprise to pass over the
  stern serenity of his features. He even permitted himself to say:</p>

  <p>"Every effort has been made to compensate you, Herr Morl, and as some time
  has elapsed I trust that you have totally recovered from your most unpleasant
  experience."</p>

  <p>At that the young man moved round in his chair and stared at his host as
  if he had forgotten what an august personage he was, and in what solemn and
  formal surroundings he was himself placed.</p>

  <p>"Forget it?" he said. "Do you think one ever could? Those days and nights
  in the cell&mdash;standing in the dock at Bow Street&mdash;hearing it
  discussed over and over again, just how she was found lying, the
  knife&mdash;I can see it all&mdash;the room, the bed."</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut," protested the Prime Minister, "don't let your imagination run
  away with you, sir. These are things that should not even be mentioned."</p>

  <p>"I had to hear them mentioned," said the young German, "again and again,
  as I say. First one witness, then another, all dwelling on the same
  thing&mdash;until I don't feel as if I should ever get the
  thought&mdash;of&mdash;Martha&mdash;out of my mind."</p>

  <p>"Was not the name of this poor and unhappy lost creature Daisy Arrow?"
  asked the Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I say it, didn't I say Daisy Arrow?"</p>

  <p>"No, you mentioned one name and that was Martha."</p>

  <p>"Yes, her name was Martha Owen, and that somehow seems to have stayed with
  me more than the other." He rose. "I think I ought to go now, sir. I don't
  think I ought to disturb you any more. I can't&mdash;I really
  can't&mdash;express my thanks, my gratitude."</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister remained seated, and with a gesture stayed his agitated
  guest.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I wish to say to you, Herr Morl, that might have some
  weight to you as coming from a man so much your elder&mdash;coming from one
  who is invested with a certain authority."</p>

  <p>He paused; the young German did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Do you not think," added the minister with an impressive grandeur of
  speech and manner, "that God in His mysterious ways may not have sent you
  this experience for His own purposes? Think, sir, how many wretched creatures
  there be who daily and nightly brave the fate this most miserable young woman
  met! You are a clergyman&mdash;I understand you have private means which you
  were disposed to devote to missionary work."</p>

  <p>As he paused the young man muttered:</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, sir, but that is all altered now."</p>

  <p>"Let it be altered for the better," said the Prime Minister, raising his
  vigorous voice, "take up your labours among these unfortunate creatures! A
  Christian could have no better opportunity to exercise his faith. There is
  much to be done. I myself have had some experience&mdash;this young lady,
  whose devotion to you has already suffered so severe a trial, why should she
  not be your helpmate in the noble task?"</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister seemed to wait for an answer; the young man
  stammered:</p>

  <p>"I scarcely know what you mean, sir."</p>

  <p>"I regret I did not make myself more explicit. I see you are still
  agitated. I will not detain you."</p>

  <p>"To work among these fallen women&mdash;ah, that?" stammered the young
  German.</p>

  <p>He thrust his hand into the bosom of his coat in the attitude that he had
  used in the dock; he seemed to clutch it there as if he dragged at the flesh
  above his heart.</p>

  <p>"It is the noblest work possible to Christian charity," insisted the Prime
  Minister. "Where could a Christian clergyman and his Christian wife find
  greater scope for their love and zeal than following in Our Lord's footsteps
  to save these Magdalenes, sir? These poor Magdalenes!"</p>

  <p>As the young pastor did not reply, the Prime Minister rose and, in a tone
  almost of rebuke, added:</p>

  <p>"Could you hear, sir, unfolded&mdash;as you say yourself you heard
  unfolded&mdash;a story so dreadful, so poignant, so shocking, without feeling
  moved by it beyond the terror you felt at your own peril? Could you have
  listened to that most dismal revelation of vice and crime in a great city,
  vice and crime perhaps unknown to you in your innocent absorption in your own
  work, and not have vowed in your heard to dedicate yourself to some mission
  to reform, to reclaim&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I had not thought if it," stammered the young German.</p>

  <p>"Think of it now, Herr Morl, think of it now&mdash;if not in London, in
  Berlin, for in this particular, I regret to say, all cities are the
  same."</p>

  <p>"Yes," conceded the German, "yes, it's very shocking, sir, very shocking.
  But you know it was not of those vile degraded women I was thinking, but of
  the murderer."</p>

  <p>"The&mdash;murderer?" repeated the Prime Minister, with an accent of
  slight astonishment and even disgust, as if an element of bad taste had been
  introduced into the conversation.</p>

  <p>"There must be a murderer somewhere, you know," whispered Herr Morl,
  "unless you accept the theory of suicide, and I don't know whether anyone
  would accept that&mdash;the police wouldn't for a moment. Well, I suppose
  this Superintendent Matchwell, sir, is still looking for the murderer,
  perhaps, the thief of the valise."</p>

  <p>"The affair is in the hands of the police and, of course, I trust they
  will not make another blunder," replied the Prime Minister dryly. "I trust
  the valise will be traced."</p>

  <p>"It was that I was thinking of as I stood in the dock&mdash;of the
  murderer, sir. He was described pretty accurately&mdash;young, not
  ill-looking, well dressed, the air and voice of a gentleman&mdash;but he did
  <i>that</i>&mdash;now, sir, can you explain?"</p>

  <p>"There are dark places in the human heart into which it is not good to
  look," remarked the statesman, still with an air of slight reproach and
  astonishment. "It is an unpleasant subject&mdash;and in the hands of the
  police, to whom we leave&mdash;all speculations."</p>

  <p>"They may not find anyone, sir&mdash;they may make another
  blunder&mdash;as you said yourself. Meanwhile, this creature, this
  <i>monster</i> is abroad."</p>

  <p>"It's not on that aspect of the affair I would have you dwell, Herr Morl.
  It was not to discuss this that I asked you to come here. I thought that you
  might have seen the hand of God, as I said, in your terrible experience,
  directing you to devote yourself to these poor lost women."</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head and again his hands seemed to be clutching at
  something under his coat.</p>

  <p>"It was of the lost <i>man</i> I thought. The woman didn't seem to me to
  matter so much."</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister touched the little bell on his table. He had already
  exceeded the time that he had intended to give to his visitor, but he had
  felt it his duty to put before this young stranger, who had been so
  desperately unfortunate, a point of view of his faith that had come to
  him&mdash;an experienced statesman&mdash;with such clarity that he felt it
  well might be an inspiration from on high.</p>

  <p>As he dismissed him with further gracious regrets and condolences and
  renewed promises of the British Government's assistance and protection, he
  again recommended to the young clergyman the case of the poor Magdalenes:</p>

  <p>"The dregs of our far from perfect social system, Herr Morl." He added
  sharply and with that look of invincible curiosity in his small deep-set
  eyes: "And some of them, as I have heard, are astonishingly beautiful
  women."</p>

  <p>Belle, drifting to and fro in the crowd outside, thus imagined this
  grotesque interview.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">As the huge door opened and closed swiftly and silently
again and Maarten
  Morl found himself on the grey steps in front of the grey house, more like a
  monument than a dwelling, he looked at once, and eagerly, at the press of
  people beyond the railing, and sought out that tall slender figure in black,
  with the crape veil and the reticule under the arm, in a warm woollen
  shawl&mdash;all bought with his money.</p>

  <p>He came down the steps slowly, pulling at his gloves&mdash;the east wind
  had strengthened in intensity, there was only a sufficient glimmer of light
  left in the February day for him to sense the strong outline of the city, the
  huge government buildings, the greasy pavements, the dark roads, the little
  knots of loiterers and their drab clothes, the black figure in that imitation
  mourning waiting for him.</p>

  <p>As he got into his hired carriage, again with the murmured sympathy and
  blessings of the crowd (Many of the women in tears), he noticed a cab waiting
  at the corner of the street; he guessed for whom it was waiting; yes, there
  she was, gliding over the pavement, giving her directions to the driver,
  springing lightly to the seat&mdash;there was the cab, with the flip-flop of
  the horse's hoofs coming behind him. She was not behind him for long; she had
  not troubled to follow him; the cab passed the carriage; she leant out, threw
  back her veil and smiled in what seemed an amiable recognition, then was gone
  into the thickening twilight.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle waited in the clean pleasant parlour of the Hobart
Hotel; she was
  quite sure that she had not been recognised as the young woman who had called
  there before for Dr. Schoppe. She kept her voice low and her veil down. The
  porter had expressed no surprise when she had given her name as Miss Rose
  Rastell.</p>

  <p>"Why 'Rose'," she had asked herself. She hated it really, but it had been
  tingling in her mind from the "Moss Rose" waltz; she could not get away from
  it. With a half-cold ironic perverse desire to torment herself that often
  afflicted her, she had, as it were, pinned on her breast that Moss
  Rose&mdash;that wretched bloom of rags and paper that had flaunted nightly on
  the stage of the Cambridge Music Hall.</p>

  <p>He did not keep her waiting long&mdash;she was sure that he never would
  keep her waiting at any of their appointments. With more than a lover's
  eagerness he would always hasten to their trysts.</p>

  <p>Without any preliminaries she asked him, at once, what his plans were?
  When he was returning to Germany? If he had made arrangements to take her
  with him? If he had spoken of her to his Lili, who must be prepared to put up
  with her company during the journey and perhaps afterwards?</p>

  <p>When she had finished this he did not reply.</p>

  <p>She moved towards the clean-swept hearth, where a bright fire burned and
  close to which, too, was the long bell-rope.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you do not realise how important I am to you?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>At that he replied in the manner of a man well schooled:</p>

  <p>"Dr. Schoppe told me something. I hardly think he could have understood
  you rightly."</p>

  <p>"About the book I found in Daisy Arrow's room? You know you lost it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I've lost&mdash;a book&mdash;but not there."</p>

  <p>"Are you so sure?" She opened her recticule and took out the small fat
  German Bible. "Don't spring at me and try to snatch it and cast it into the
  fire. I'm standing by the bell-rope on purpose. One false move on your part
  and I'll ruin you. Remember I've nothing to lose&mdash;the worst that can
  happen to me is to become Belle Adair again, picking up thirty shillings at
  the Cambridge or in worse ways."</p>

  <p>He looked at the woman and at the book she held, and remained standing
  still, by what effort of will she well could guess, at the table; it was
  covered with a dark-blue chenille cloth, she noted.</p>

  <p>"This Bible is yours," said Belle. "It has your name in it and several
  little entries, as if you had used the fly-leaf as a kind of diary. It has
  your Lili's name in it: 'Lili and I are betrothed to-day&mdash;God help us
  both.' What did you mean, Mr. Morl, when you wrote 'God help us both'? Why
  did you drop that paper in the Argyll Rooms?"</p>

  <p>He did not reply and she continued quietly:</p>

  <p>"I think if I wanted you to take an oath I should ask you to swear on
  this."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it would be no use for us to swear anything to one another;" his
  teeth were pulling at his lower lip and his right hand clasped on the table's
  edge, dragging the cloth awry.</p>

  <p>"Would it not? No, I suppose not, yet perhaps I should like you swear on
  this that you will give me my terms. You were careless that night&mdash;the
  paper, the book!"</p>

  <p>"How much money do you want?" he asked. "For what money will you give me
  that book?&mdash;and go away so that I may never see you or hear of you
  again?"</p>

  <p>"More money than you or any man possesses," she replied. "I've explained
  all that to Dr. Schoppe&mdash;it would be a weariness to go over it
  again."</p>

  <p>"Nobody would believe you," he replied doggedly; "remember that. All this
  sounds very fine now, spoken to me or to Dr. Schoppe, but if you were in the
  witness box again&mdash;a very good excuse would have to be found for your
  having that book."</p>

  <p>"And for these letters too, I suppose," said Belle, drawing a package from
  the pages of the Bible. "They are signed by poor Daisy when she was in
  Bavaria. You know, perhaps, to what they refer."</p>

  <p>She was herself surprised at the effect of these words upon the young man;
  all his carefully-sustained courage left him; he sank on the nearest chair
  and stared down at the floor in the attitude of one who has been suddenly
  struck through all armour of reserve and pride, straight to the brain.</p>

  <p>"I had them from Daisy's brother&mdash;the fool didn't realise what they
  were. I do; I can read German, as you know, and it seems to me they're more
  important than ever I thought they were. Why do they upset you so?"</p>

  <p>"You're all wrong," he muttered, "everything that you think is wrong. You
  are mistaken and you have built it all up falsely from the beginning."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, I have taken no trouble to investigate, but I believe that if I
  were to go to Superintendent Matchwell and say&mdash;I saw the young man on
  the stairs when he left her room&mdash;I went into her room to fetch water
  and I found this Bible on the floor, just a few minutes <i>after</i>, mind
  you; if I were to go to Superintendent Matchwell and say&mdash;Those letters
  that Roger Owen gave me weren't from Paris, but from Germany; well, however
  trivial and unimportant they are&mdash;merely a little love letter and a
  reference to some common secret&mdash;I suppose at least it would be
  important to prove that you and Daisy were not strangers when you met that
  night at the Argyll Rooms?'</p>

  <p>"What would it matter?" he asked listlessly, "what would it matter?"</p>

  <p>"It might give a motive for the crime, I suppose," cried Belle
  impatiently. "But what of that, we always waste so much time in talking.
  Come, will you give me my terms or no?"</p>

  <p>"I have already arranged them."</p>

  <p>She admired the way he had recovered his courage in such a short space of
  time, for, indeed, the production of the letters must have been a
  considerable shock to him.</p>

  <p>"I will present you to Lili. I am, as it seems, through ugly circumstance,
  more or less at your mercy. You shall return with us to Germany. The
  missionary scheme is abandoned. I do not know to whom I can take you in my
  own country; I should think there might be someone&mdash;some lady who
  requires a companion&mdash;yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She filled up his desperate pause:</p>

  <p>"I know what you would say&mdash;'It's against your conscience to
  introduce me'&mdash;believe me you need not be so squeamish, I am as good as
  many women who hold such posts, as good as many women who offer them. I
  should behave myself. I am well-bred and accomplished. Do not get your values
  so confused."</p>

  <p>"I must take you first to my mother's house," he replied dryly; "she is
  rather a peculiar woman; she lives very quietly and never has expressed the
  least wish for a companion; but I can gloss that over."</p>

  <p>"It will be your business to do so," replied Belle. "Now when do we leave
  for Germany? It seems to me that you can get no more out of your popularity
  in England, you've had a good deal of flattery, a good deal of money, is it
  not time to make an end?"</p>

  <p>"I have to go to the castle," replied the young pastor in a low hurried
  voice. "It is a great honour, you understand, I cannot evade it, though there
  are many things I would rather do. You see, what might have been a tragedy is
  being turned into a farce&mdash;I become ridiculous."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," remarked Belle casually, "it is better to be ridiculous than
  hanged for murder. No doubt you will have some fine sight-seeing. What did
  the Prime Minister, who is so good and conscientious a man, tell you?"</p>

  <p>The young pastor smiled in a manner which caused even Belle to move a
  little nearer the bell-rope, for about that convulsive twitching of the
  minister's comely mouth was a suggestion of a maniac's grin.</p>

  <p>"He told me to concern myself with fallen women. It seems that is a
  charity he has much next to his heart. He suggested that Lili and I might
  give up our missionary work and spend our lives in that service."</p>

  <p>"That gives me," said Belle, "a good idea. It will be one of those people
  that I will be from now on&mdash;a lady, early orphaned, of some small means,
  who has devoted herself to this (what do you call
  it&mdash;rescue&mdash;social work, a kind of half-nun? I must find out what
  these creatures are, and what they call themselves). Yes, I shall be one of
  those&mdash;Miss Rose Rastell, the social worker."</p>

  <p>"I think you're half-lunatic," muttered the young man, "I never met anyone
  like you before. You make a silly jest of what is so unbelievably horrible
  that even I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because I'm used to horror and because I've nothing to lose," replied
  Belle contemptuously. "Does not my plan suit you, Herr Morl? What a pretty
  tale to tell your Lili and your good mother and all your friends in Germany!
  You can say that that was how you made my acquaintance. I was working among
  these poor women and I was kind to you and your Lili."</p>

  <p>He interrupted her by rising violently.</p>

  <p>"As well that tale as another. It will do for the present; we must work
  things out hereafter. But why do you call yourself Rose?" he asked with an
  air of disgust.</p>

  <p>"Why not? I hate the name myself. It comes from that little waltz 'Moss
  Rose,' 'Moss Rose.'"</p>

  <p>He made a movement of repugnance.</p>

  <p>"I detest them."</p>

  <p>"Moss Roses? Why? They are such charming little flowers."</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;an association, a coincidence&mdash;I begin not to
  think very clearly&mdash;need I see you again?&mdash;cannot this be arranged
  between you and Dr. Schoppe?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you please, as you please. I just want to get out of the country,
  like you do. I need scarcely see you at all during the journey if you don't
  wish it. I don't suppose I shall stay long in your mother's house; it's only
  just to give myself a little rest&mdash;a chance of something else."</p>

  <p>She moved towards the door, but he stayed her, getting in her way.</p>

  <p>"And if I do this&mdash;give you this chance that you, you queer creature,
  say you want, will you do your part?&mdash;give me back that book, that
  letter?&mdash;give me your oath, for what it may be worth, that you won't
  disturb me any more in the future?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I'll do that," said Belle. "I'm not a vulgar blackmailer. I'm
  only taking the chance that came my way, as, I suppose, you took yours when
  you met Daisy at the Argyll and dropped the paper, like a fool."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't keep saying those names. You want me to keep sane, I suppose?
  You don't want me to go mad and scream it all out? That wouldn't suit your
  purpose, would it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you've courage enough, I think," replied Belle slowly, "you're able
  to control yourself. I watched you going into the Prime Minister's house, and
  coming out; you didn't seem shaken at all."</p>

  <p>"Courage," he said. "I don't know. I can't be sure of myself from one day
  to another&mdash;sometimes it's this way and sometimes that."</p>

  <p>He took her wrists (it was the first time they had touched save by formal
  finger-tips) and held her so, as if he forced her to remain thus against her
  will. She did not flinch, though it was an effort to repress an
  exclamation&mdash;to keep her head high and stare at him undaunted.</p>

  <p>"You don't seem afraid of me," he said. "You believe that Daisy Arrow
  destroyed herself, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think about it at all, only of the future. Do you recall what
  that stupid pious man said to you after he had been preaching and talking
  about his Magdalenes?&mdash;he said, 'some of them are very beautiful
  women'."</p>

  <p>"That's a strange thought," smiled Herr Morl, "to come into his head then
  and into your head now. What do you mean by it? Some of them <i>were</i>
  beautiful women perhaps. How do you know what he said? You weren't
  there."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me as if I was. I thought about it so much while I waited
  outside."</p>

  <p>"Did you? You think of me too much." He opened his fingers and freed her
  wrists. "<i>You</i> are a beautiful woman," he said dryly.</p>

  <p>Belle opened her lips, but could not speak; everything seemed in an ebb
  and flow about her; old emotions, old memories, broken fantasies, crowded on
  to this present moment, distorting the present circumstances. She was even
  oppressed by the thought of the scent of trodden grass, of lilac buds that
  had come to her at the first sight of Lili Schoppe, by the resemblance of the
  girl's face to those of the wooden-looking angels in the print of <i>The Last
  Judgment</i>. She thought in despair: "I shall never do anything, never get
  anywhere, for I can't make anything seem real; it's fighting shadows all the
  time, as if I was in a suppressed delirium."</p>

  <p>But the resolution at the core of her spirit held firmly; she edged
  towards the door, firmly gripping the reticule that held the Bible and the
  letters.</p>

  <p>The young man watched, his hand was on his hip.</p>

  <p>"Don't you like being called beautiful?"</p>

  <p>"I used to. Oh yes, flattery once meant something to me." She smiled,
  thinking that she had put that weakness behind her, together with her longing
  for drink. "I had enough, never again&mdash;there isn't a man
  living&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Herr Morl laughed suddenly; what he said surprised her considerably.</p>

  <p>"I felt like that about women&mdash;until I met Lili. There is something
  angelic about Lili."</p>

  <p>Angelic? Queer that he should use that word, as if he too had seen that
  dark picture in Mrs. Bulke's kitchen.</p>

  <p>She had her fingers on the door-handle when he spoke again, staring at her
  with candid sullenness.</p>

  <p>"I'll do what I can for you, I don't want any trouble. Only don't
  interfere between me and Lili. I don't think that God would allow
  that&mdash;no, not that."</p>

  <p>Belle went away silently; as she closed the door she heard him mutter:</p>

  <p>"Beautiful, yes, but beauty isn't what we think it is. What did St. Paul
  say? 'Whether in or out of the body I cannot tell, but <i>God</i>
  knoweth.'"</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The phrase lingered in Belle's mind. Perhaps God knew the
key to that
  problem of herself which she could not solve. Perhaps He knew what she
  wanted, what she might hope to have, what was the meaning of that life of
  hers, so dull and ordinary on the surface, so full of tumult within. At this
  juncture in her fortunes she felt as if her circumstances were chaos made
  rigid, like the jumble of huge statues in the museum; a whirl of disconnected
  events suddenly stilled into a grotesque, meaningless, pattern in the centre
  of which stared the dull eyes of Daisy Arrow from her red-soaked pillow.</p>

  <p>"Can I build up anything from such a basis as that? Lost, hopeless as I
  was, perhaps I was better then than I am now. What do I tell myself? That I
  am trying to rise from unspeakable degradation? Why, I suppose I never was so
  degraded as I am now. Perjury and blackmail. But those are mere words. It is
  no shame to fight with the only weapons I have. Who are these people that I
  should not take advantage of their follies, their weaknesses&mdash;their
  faults? There was always someone to take advantage of me."</p>

  <p>She shrank from the memories of the men who had said that they admired and
  valued her, and then, at the first quarrel or the first disgust, left her
  without the least concern. "That it was in their power to do that!" she
  thought, most bitterly, "that <i>they</i> had the money, the position, and
  I&mdash;nothing! But now a man is in my power. What do I want of him?" That
  question ran round in her mind like a rat in a trap. She had done with lusts,
  with emotions, she believed, as a child, sick from surfeit, has done with
  sweets. All passions seemed to her tawdry, what she had heard named love
  seemed but the tinsel dressing to disguise bestiality. She needed only the
  icy solitude of the mind, something to feed her pride, to glut her active
  malice against all mankind. "For the rest, I cannot tell what I shall do
  until I am free of all these miseries, until I have been, for a while, well
  fed, well housed, well treated."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">She dreamt that they moved slowly through the State
Apartments. It seemed
  to Belle that she took with her a peculiar atmosphere as if it was a perfume
  that she carried; the lodging-houses, the dressing-rooms beneath the stage,
  the police court, the church, the museum, all had been full of this dusty
  gloom, this stagnant air, this sense of ugly objects cherished by people long
  dead and preserved, not from love, but from avarice. Nowhere was there
  gaiety, music, that voluptuous ease, sensual and intelligent, of which she
  had once dreamed. This dream palace was no more pleasing to Belle than the
  rooms in Gower Street or the prim parlours of Hobart's Hotel. It was, of
  course, a great honour to be there; she tried to console her disappointment
  by remembering that. A great honour, and one that when awake she would never
  have thought of ever possibly attaining. But she could not laugh inwardly as
  she wanted to at Belle Adair of No. 12 mincing through these respectable and
  royal gloms, where none but the impeccable were permitted to tread.</p>

  <p>This high privilege had been accorded to Miss Rose Rastell, missionary and
  social worker of nebulous identity, who had been so kind to the forlorn band
  of Germans for whom the British public were so profoundly sorry; she was with
  the wronged young minister in place of the dove-like Lili, who had refused
  the unprecedented honour with a modesty approaching panic. She was, besides,
  ill, quite unable, the doctor said, to stand on her feet. It was natural that
  her anxious father should not leave her bedside, and it was also natural that
  this young English lady, Miss Rose Rastell, whose services to the distressed
  girl were supposed to be beyond reckoning, should be by authority allowed to
  share the privilege granted the young pastor so strangely wronged, to inspect
  the treasures in the colossal palace, which was usually closed to all but the
  more favoured of foreign visitors. Thus, it was in her heavy dream.</p>

  <p>No fear of recognition impinged on Belle's fond enjoyment of the moment.
  She was moving here in a world that had never touched on her own. Besides,
  she believed that in the last few weeks her appearance had changed
  considerably. With great satisfaction she viewed herself in one of the vast
  mirrors, which reflected an endless vista of gorgeous apartments. Her figure
  was really very good; she had almost forgotten the sleek elegance of her own
  shape. She wore her clothes well, perhaps a little too well for the part she
  was playing; and how pleasant to see herself set off so attractively! She had
  modified that rather ostentatious mourning that first she had affected; her
  present costume was no more than a decorous black gown with lawn cuffs and
  collar. How charmingly the little bonnet sat on the back of her smooth
  swathes of hair&mdash;how gracefully the light veil fell over her pure
  forehead! With a smile she endured the ironic tyrannies of circumstances.</p>

  <p>Peering at herself in the royal mirror, she thought she fitted very well
  into these august surroundings. Had she been born to a high social place she
  would have graced it excellently. Her mind darted into the future and the
  possibility of getting a foothold in some German court. Then there was
  Paris&mdash;the Emperor was not critical or squeamish, and women like herself
  had done very well at courts before now.</p>

  <p>Studying her pure complexion, which was now flawless and of pearl-like
  texture, great gusts of gratitude towards someone, somewhere, rose in her
  heart because she had been able to give up drinking; yes, she never touched
  even a drop of sherry now, and up to that Christmas Eve she had been taking
  far too much. She could remember the sense of chilled emptiness which had so
  often tormented her&mdash;a compound of fatigue and despair&mdash;and the
  relief brought by a sudden draught of spirit or wine. "That is all over now,"
  she thought. "Whatever is to come, not that, or any entanglement with a
  man."</p>

  <p>Belle took her attention from her reflection and glanced at her companion;
  their prim and portly guide was a few paces ahead in the gloom of the
  nightmare.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't this amuse you?" she whispered from behind the fine handkerchief
  she held to her lips. Her knowledge of him added to her subtle enjoyment of
  the episode.</p>

  <p>"I have never found life very amusing," he muttered, "and this is
  infinitely tedious."</p>

  <p>"If you want to be respected and honoured you have to put up with being
  bored. I thought this sort of thing was all tedious and odious too, until I
  lost it. Now you know what I'm doing to get it back."</p>

  <p>With solemn exclamations of wonder and gratitude they followed the guide
  through the state apartments&mdash;huge pictures, drawn canopies, immense
  curtains with much braiding and flouncing and gilding, portraits of dead
  kings and queens, most of whom looked like so many dolls stuffed with hay,
  long vistas of useless galleries and endless corridors, bleak windows
  glimpsing a prospect drowned in rain, a steady downward pour of water only
  lightened by a pale smear of sky.</p>

  <p>The huge untenanted rooms were so cold, the carpets so thick under foot,
  the voice of the guide so awestruck that Belle felt as she glided through
  this monotony of an eventless dream, where there was eternity in this silent
  passage through grandiose and empty scenes. She wondered when that massive
  upholstery, whose folds seemed as heavy as if cut in stone, had first been
  sewn and nailed into place. Surely those monstrous pictures that gloomed so
  forbiddingly through the shadows had never glistened with wet paint on an
  easel while the sitter yawned in his chair! No, they seemed immovable,
  permanent, and as if they had never been touched by human hands.</p>

  <p>Everywhere mirrors; a hundred times and more, surely, Belle could see
  those tall windows, the panes drenched in water, those looped curtains of
  imperial crimson, her own neat frail figure and that other figure beside her
  own in the black frock-coat and light cravat&mdash;that odd companion at whom
  she laughed sometimes and sometimes glanced at with a touch of panic, as if
  the magnificence of the castle had waned about them and they were again on
  the mean stairs of No. 12, with the dawn light like a smear in the drab
  shadow and they&mdash;alone where many slept and one was dead&mdash;stared at
  one another. Between a bit of paper, smelling of drugs.</p>

  <p>What had changed with them save the pattern of their behaviour? Nothing:
  she knew they were the same now as then, and who would care to name them?</p>

  <p>She took his arm, suddenly conscious of their separate lonelinesses. The
  guide was laboriously explaining the objects in a glass case that stood
  between two of those tall windows that framed the expanse of wet glass,
  against which the raindrops crawled.</p>

  <p>They did not listen to the pompous, official account of these withered
  treasures, letters, ribbons, locks of hair, all faded, senseless, out-worn,
  though they kept their glances on the polished glass of the case in which
  were reflected the wet panes, the sliding raindrops, the blurred overcast
  brilliance of the deeply-veiled sky.</p>

  <p>Belle stared up once at her companion's face, blank in expression, but not
  like a mask in the white light. It was not a coarse face, not one sensual, or
  cruel, or cunning; he must, she thought, be well-schooled to be able to keep
  that patient expression. The features were well modelled, precise in outline,
  and the light grey eyes, flatly set beneath dark lashes and brows, had a
  silvern look. It was a face full of a vital energy. Belle felt her curiosity
  baffled; she thought, with a sense of weariness and confusion: "We shall
  never escape from each other, we shall never understand one
  another&mdash;eternal enemies, eternal companions. Yes, that, for I do not
  mean to let him go."</p>

  <p>She clung to his impassive arm, really glad of the support, for she felt
  giddy with the rasping drone of the guide's voice, the reflection of glass in
  glass, the slow trickle of the silent rain, the monstrous chill of the
  stately apartments. Her head ached as if she peered into the dark backwards
  in an effort to glimpse what must be for ever hidden. She tried to wake and
  could not.</p>

  <p>The guide ceased to speak; they passed on and had to pause again to admire
  a colossal clock where an angel in harsh metallic gold stood guardian over
  Time.</p>

  <p>"Like Lili Schoppe," whispered Belle, against her own wish, for she
  thought impatiently, "Why is that girl always in my mind?"</p>

  <p>He stared at the figure in the long stiff robe, with the straight
  infantile features and harshly-crimped hair.</p>

  <p>"Lili is very ill," he whispered. "We ought not to be here when Lili is
  very ill."</p>

  <p>She looked at her gloved hand on his arm, wishing suddenly that they were
  different, not so masked from each other, from the world, in pretences.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The dull dream reached a fantastic climax. Belle felt tense
and strained,
  as if she could endure no more. She kept saying to herself: "Be quiet, be
  quiet, it will soon be over, surely we have seen everything?"</p>

  <p>Her head ached very much. It had been stupid to come as she had come, on
  this impossible expedition, just to emphasise her pride and power.</p>

  <p>A door opened suddenly as they stared at a cabinet of porcelain where pale
  china figures glittered in the murk. A gentleman entered the huge apartment
  and whispered to the guide. Belle thought of the police court, where there
  had also been so many officials whispering, where the air had also been so
  stale and chill, where her own limbs had felt cold and her head heavy, as
  they felt now. She stared at her companion, and it seemed to her that she
  looked at a husk.</p>

  <p>They were solemnly beckoned forward; there was the opening and closing of
  doors and they were in a small, well-warmed gallery prettily furnished with
  pots of flowers and chairs covered with a chintz printed with shells and
  bunches of seaweed.</p>

  <p>A short middle-aged lady came slowly towards them where they stood at a
  loss inside the door; she walked clumsily and her ungainliness was increased
  by the heavy mourning that she wore, which was stiff and shining, as if
  varnished. Her face was soft and chinless, the arched ruffle at her neck
  rubbed against the sagging flesh of her jowl; her eyes were pale, prominent
  and very heavily lidded; as she stared with her small mouth slightly open she
  seemed to Belle like a pallid fish come to a pause in a tank and gazing
  blankly through the glass; even her smooth, flabby pink complexion had a
  sodden quality, as if it had been long under water, her thin hair gleamed
  beneath the ugly lace cap. She was as inhuman as an idol and as ordinary as
  any stout woman who is inquisitive and sad.</p>

  <p>Belle curtsied before this emphatic personality, the young minister bowed
  low, Majesty hesitated, pried at the strangers, so non-committal in their
  attitude of rigid respect, then said:</p>

  <p>"I hope that you liked my beautiful palace."</p>

  <p>Belle curtsied again&mdash;how easily that school training came back to
  her&mdash;she felt that she was what she feigned to be, yes, in her dream,
  she was innocent.</p>

  <p>Majesty continued to gaze at them with melancholy curiosity. In Belle's
  nightmare the thick, short figure seemed to rise and swell until it filled
  the entire bulk of the monstrous castle, and the whole of the afternoon as
  well as the whole of the building seemed to be nothing but the Queen, just as
  those fat, prosperous-looking coins that Belle had found recently, so scarce
  and so precious, to be nothing but the Queen.</p>

  <p>Belle held herself effaced against the wall, quite confused in her dull
  dream by memories of her childhood, of learning deportment in a bare
  dancing-room while someone said:</p>

  <p>"Some day you may meet the Queen."</p>

  <p>Mingled with this was the drowsy sense of summer, of picnic, of girls at
  play, a glimpse of Lili Schoppe staring across the police court.</p>

  <p>Majesty was talking amiably in a voice very forceful for a small woman;
  she appeared to like the young German, she remarked that she had heard of
  "the case," and that it "was monstrous." Her manner ignored all that was not
  genteel in the affair. Save for the curiosity in her prominent eyes, it would
  have seemed impossible to have thought of her as existing in the same world
  as Daisy Arrow.</p>

  <p>"I suppose she knows nothing," thought Belle. "Lili ought to have come,
  she would have liked Lili."</p>

  <p>The rain slid over the pale windows behind the lace curtains; despite the
  warm atmosphere, the gallery seemed as cold as an icicle to Belle&mdash;as if
  they were all in a glass case sunk in water, and would remain so, immobile
  for ever.</p>

  <p>Herr Morl was at ease, even fluent; was he not one on whom the pale, full
  eye of Majesty had fallen before during an august visit to a minor court?</p>

  <p>Belle listened to the question and answer that went to and fro to the
  accompaniment of the ticking of the clock, to the spatter of the rain, now
  agitated by a rising wind, against the window-panes.</p>

  <p>Majesty enquired about Herr Morl's missionary work, which was a subject in
  which she took the deepest interest. Majesty was sorry that he had changed
  his mind and was returning to Germany instead of continuing his voyage to
  Brazil&mdash;</p>

  <p>"For I have heard that the efforts of Christian missionaries are much
  needed there."</p>

  <p>She spoke in German with an affectionate caress in her voice, as if she
  loved the language that she used.</p>

  <p>"I hear that it is very pretty in Brazil, but very hot. Some of the native
  Indians are quite savages, isn't that true, Herr Morl?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, madame. That is why I was so anxious to organise this
  expedition&mdash;it was fantastic, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is all fantastic," thought Belle, as Majesty's benevolent stare,
  touched by that probing curiosity as if she gazed at some odd object being
  prodded under a microscope, rested on her.</p>

  <p>"You are not the brave young lady who was going out to Brazil?"</p>

  <p>Belle explained herself modestly as Rose Rastell, a social worker, who had
  been able to render some service to Fräulein Lili Schoppe in the distressing
  position in which she had found herself.</p>

  <p>"It was all very terrible," said Majesty, "it was a great mistake. It was
  something that no clergyman or German should have been accused of."</p>

  <p>Majesty stared with quick and amiable approval at the correctly drab
  appearance of the two young people; Belle's shawl muffled her fine figure and
  she kept her bold eyes prudently downcast.</p>

  <p>"I am glad, Herr Morl, that there was an English lady ready to take care
  of Fräulein Schoppe. You will be rewarded, Miss Rastell, for your pity for
  the sufferings of others."</p>

  <p>Majesty glanced at her own black dress as if she compared all suffering
  with her own supreme sorrow. Then she asked Belle about her work; she
  commended it; and Belle contrived some murmured references to her labours as
  a member of the mission of rescue at work in police courts, in prisons, in
  workhouses and in squalid homes, loving labour of reclaim and reformation.
  Majesty, looking down at her small, fat, dimpled hands, sighed and
  approved.</p>

  <p>"You do a good work. It must be difficult for a lady, Miss Rastell."</p>

  <p>"If only it would cease raining, if only I could get away," thought Belle.
  "If only I could wake."</p>

  <p>The clock ticked, the rain beat on the pane. Majesty was amiably garrulous
  about missionaries, about Brazil, about Germany, and all the while her eyes
  were sharp and curious, eager and probing, as if she did not ask about the
  things that she really wanted to know.</p>

  <p>She was suddenly silent, then, in the respectful pause, remarked:</p>

  <p>"It is quite a wet day. I hope that you brought umbrellas."</p>

  <p>She bent her head and passed down the warm gallery; she seemed to have
  forgotten them before she had gone a step; Belle wondered if that drooping,
  turned-down mouth, melancholy as a spaniel's, knew how to smile.</p>

  <p>The door behind the couch with the seaweed-imprinted chintz opened, the
  bland gentleman conducted them to the state apartments, where the guide
  received them in the tall shadows from which the scanty light was already
  receding.</p>

  <p>Unutterable greyness engulfed them as they left the palace; it seemed
  impossible that anyone lived in that dark pile; there was not a light in any
  of the windows. Clouds were piling up over the bare park as they were piling
  up in the picture in Mrs. Bulke's kitchen&mdash;the picture with the yew
  bough beneath that had been Daisy Arrow's only funeral wreath.</p>

  <p>They walked to the gates beyond which, in the wet street, their hired
  carriage waited.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," whispered Belle, "that was the first time she has seen
  a&mdash;what I am&mdash;and a&mdash;what you are."</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't have come," he muttered, holding his hat against the wind.
  "You really must be careful how you force yourself on me."</p>

  <p>"I wish I hadn't come. It was just a whim, it didn't do me any good. I
  shan't have any more whims."</p>

  <p>He watched her get into the carriage, and ordered the coachman to drive to
  the station.</p>

  <p>"I shall walk and take a later train."</p>

  <p>Peering from the carriage window, she watched him go, bending before the
  gusts of wind. The clouds high above the castle, and the flag seemed to
  dissolve the scene into darkness, into nothingness as a wax model will
  dissolve before flame, until there was no reality left but the rain and her
  tenacious resolve to live.</p>

  <p>Majesty, the castle, had not existed, the seaweeds and shells on the
  glazed chintz had been sinking through an empty sea of dreams; in the
  half-heard echoes and half-glimpsed shapes, sounds as hesitant as raindrops
  on leaves, wraiths as impalpable as the fumes from an alembic that formed
  Belle's world, only herself and her resolve were real. "Why did I dream that?
  An absurdity?"</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle bent over the prim bed in the hotel room where Lili
Schoppe lay and
  spoke rapidly. She did not intend to have any trouble with the girl, and
  wished their future relationship to be made clear.</p>

  <p>"Your father has told you, Fräulein, that I am accompanying you to
  Germany?"</p>

  <p>Lili did not reply nor raise her head, with the long fair plaits, from the
  pillow. Her attitude was one of complete exhaustion and despair. The plain
  white wrapper she wore revealed contours as slight as those of a child, her
  hands were laid flatly over each other; on her finger shone the betrothal
  ring.</p>

  <p>"I think you are under some mistake about me," said Belle, with smooth
  patience. "I don't know who you think I am. I am a woman who has always had
  to work for my living since my father died. Rose Rastell, my name is."</p>

  <p>At that Lili spoke faintly from the pillow:</p>

  <p>"You had another name when you were in the witness box&mdash;I heard
  it&mdash;Belle Adair you were then. Why did you come and sit beside me
  afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"What strange questions you ask, child. I was sorry for you, I suppose.
  Yes, I had another name; as I explained, I was on the stage for a short
  while; that is how I came to know some of those odd women, very
  slightly&mdash;just to know them. Tell me, what did you think it all
  was?"</p>

  <p>In her heart Belle decided: "Better to know this now, better to get it
  straight and clear."</p>

  <p>"Come, answer me," she insisted aloud, impatiently.</p>

  <p>Lili sighed, sat up and as if to support herself clasped her pale hands
  round her knees.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know, Miss Rastell. It seemed to me that it was just like a den
  of thieves&mdash;everybody so horrible. What sort of house was it&mdash;I
  mean, why should anyone go there? They all looked wicked."</p>

  <p>"That's what they were. You find them in great cities&mdash;people like
  that, you know. They do live by stealing, pilfering, receiving stolen goods,
  selling second-hand things&mdash;oh, anything you like. You must have known
  there were such people."</p>

  <p>"I didn't think I'd ever see them. I didn't think that Maarten would ever
  be in the midst of them."</p>

  <p>"Well, he wasn't, was he? It was all a mistake."</p>

  <p>"But he <i>was</i> in the midst of them&mdash;in the police court, I
  mean&mdash;and you, I don't understand who you are."</p>

  <p>"I'm not one of them, Fräulein, you must see I am different."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that, but why are you coming to Germany with us?"</p>

  <p>"I am very interested in religious work&mdash;in missionary work. I'm very
  much alone, all my relatives are dead. I thought I'd like to get abroad. Your
  father and your promised husband, both were kind enough to think that I was a
  little of use to them."</p>

  <p>"In what way&mdash;of use?" asked Lili in a sudden sharp tone.</p>

  <p>Belle stared at the small, pinched face, then decided to make her shot in
  the dark:</p>

  <p>"Fräulein, you know you lied when you swore that Herr Morl had been with
  you all Christmas Eve."</p>

  <p>The young girl had no defences against this attack. She said at once:</p>

  <p>"It is killing me, you see, it is killing me."</p>

  <p>"I thought you looked like one who couldn't tell a lie and live," smiled
  Belle; then checking her contempt and changing her tone, she added: "What
  harm was in it? You knew in your heart he was innocent, and it would have
  complicated things a great, deal if you had said you hadn't been with him.
  Come now, what was the truth? The entertainment was the night before, wasn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was it. I'm sure of it, but Father and Herr Leutner and the
  lawyer, they all persuaded me that it wasn't so, and you heard all the
  waiters, the chambermaid, and people, they also thought it was that
  night."</p>

  <p>"They were confused or bribed, I suppose. I believe it is quite usual to
  fake an alibi like that&mdash;change it from one date to another. Well, what
  of it? I mean on Christmas Eve? You didn't see him, of course?"</p>

  <p>"No, not at all. He didn't come to the ball, but he was in the hotel,"
  stammered Lili, with a deep passion. "Father saw him&mdash;that's why I was
  justified in what I said. I know he was here. He had one of his headaches,
  one of his bad moods, and was upstairs in his room; Father went up to him
  several times with his medicine; and so when I said, 'Father, I don't think I
  can&mdash;not a lie like that,' he said, 'It wouldn't be a lie, Lili, I know
  he was in the hotel&mdash;only just a question of us all standing
  together.'"</p>

  <p>Lili began to weep; the tears ran slowly down her unprotected face.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter? I oughtn't to have spoken to you about it, but I
  could see there was something on your mind; you weren't as happy as you ought
  to have been at the acquittal&mdash;you were thinking of yourself and the
  damage to your own soul, I suppose." Belle tried to speak soothingly, but her
  eyes were bright with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I feel ill. It was horrible to have to tell a lie and to persist in
  it when they tried to make me take it back (I mean the other lawyer).
  'Whosoever shall break one of the least of these commandments'"&mdash;Lili
  checked herself and added: "And how did Maarten come to be arrested? Oh, if
  you're a friend and understand, perhaps you could tell me that&mdash;you see,
  I don't know English so very well&mdash;and who was this woman?"</p>

  <p>"She was some actress," replied Belle quietly and casually, "in very poor
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>"But this actress meets a man and he goes home with her? And they were
  together in one room as if they had been husband and wife?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Belle, "that shocked you very much, but then we don't
  know the details, do we? It might have been an old friend."</p>

  <p>"But in her bedroom," sobbed Lili. "She was a vile woman, and yet he went
  with her."</p>

  <p>"Don't concern yourself about her," advised Belle; "you're all well out of
  the trouble now; only I want you to accept me and think of me as a friend,
  one who did try to help."</p>

  <p>"And how," asked Lili sharply, "how did you help?"</p>

  <p>Belle did not answer that direct appeal.</p>

  <p>"I work among these poor women, that's why I took that part (you see, I am
  confiding in you, child, it's really a little secret)&mdash;I pretended to be
  an actress to get among them; I tried to get them from the sort of life they
  lead, to encourage them to do better, to find them work. Your father, your
  future husband, both think that I might have the chance of some such work in
  a social mission in Germany."</p>

  <p>The girl did not reply, but put her frail hand in front of her large blue
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," asked Belle, rising and speaking curiously, "is it because of
  you they're not going on to Brazil?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I couldn't do it&mdash;and I was so happy&mdash;it is all spoiled;
  it seemed as if the blessing had gone from the whole thing. Can't you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose I can; it seems a pity, too, but as you know, he is
  innocent and the whole wretched business had nothing to do with
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It isn't the same," said Lili, "it isn't the same. I know about these
  things now; I saw him in the dock and I swore a lie, and I don't feel as if
  any of us could go on preaching God to the heathens after that."</p>

  <p>Belle did not reply; she kept her face smooth and noncommittal; it suited
  her far better that the party of Germans should return to their own country
  than go on to Brazil, a part of the world she had no great mind to
  investigate. In any case, she knew now that in dealing with Lili Schoppe she
  would have to deal with a fanatic. She was fairly experienced, but she had
  never yet had to handle simple, single-minded piety, which she sensed could
  have an iron resolution behind it, for surely Lili's look of a china angel
  concealed a stern obstinacy of purpose.</p>

  <p>And Belle remembered that she owed this interview that she had so much
  wanted to Lili; it was the German girl who had implored her father to allow
  her to see alone the stranger who was to return with them to Germany.</p>

  <p>Belle moved about the neat room, which reminded her of other
  characterless, trim rooms in which she had as a girl, as a young woman,
  lived. She held the hotel concert programmes and looked at them as intently
  as Lili, seated in her bed, with tear-wet face and her hands clasped round
  her knees, was looking at her; Belle had a strong desire to get everything
  clear between Lili and herself, not only because of her own plans, which were
  as vague as they were determined, as because of the longing to satisfy a deep
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"You have been very frank with me, Fräulein, I want to help you all I can.
  See, how curious, they played 'Moss Rose' waltz at the hotel on Christmas
  Eve&mdash;I daresay you danced to it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, with my father."</p>

  <p>"I was dancing to it also," smiled Belle, wondering if Lili knew of the
  existence of such places as the Cambridge. "Meanwhile, Herr Morl&mdash;he was
  in his room, with one of his headaches&mdash;in a bad mood, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Who," asked Lili "was the young man so like Maarten who was abroad on
  Christmas Eve? Who threw that bloodstained handkerchief away?"</p>

  <p>"He must be a murderer. A monster. Don't think of him."</p>

  <p>"Someone lied. Someone was mistaken." Lili sprang from bed and drew a long
  white shawl over her shoulders. "I lied, for one. And now we are not going to
  Brazil&mdash;everyone wanted to go. We seemed blessed&mdash;Maarten said that
  he had never been happy before. Now all is over. And that lost valise with
  the note-paper."</p>

  <p>Lili stood erect in the straight white garment with the shawl folded over
  her thin shoulders and the smooth, heavy hair hanging either side of her
  childish face, she brought to mind the angels of <i>The Last Judgment</i>
  that she so absurdly resembled. Belle smiled at the grotesque thought.</p>

  <p>"How long have you known Herr Morl, Fräulein Schoppe?"</p>

  <p>"About two years. My father is the doctor at Maartensdorf, near Schloss
  Morl&mdash;<i>he</i>, Maarten, was taken with a sudden illness once, he fell
  off his horse in the road. My father is a very God-fearing
  man&mdash;he&mdash;I&mdash;we got hold on Maarten's soul. He became a changed
  man."</p>

  <p>"Changed from what?"</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;he was, though a minister, gloomy, lonely. I don't know why
  I am telling you all this. I suppose I am trying to get it clear for
  myself."</p>

  <p>Belle gave her a look of malice. Got hold on his soul! And on his money,
  too&mdash;inducing him to finance that crazy missionary
  expedition&mdash;"why, you prudish little bigot, you are only a sharp
  adventuress yourself," she thought.</p>

  <p>Lili sat down in the deep arm-chair by the fire.</p>

  <p>"We sold our home at Maartensdorf. I don't know what we shall do now." She
  looked straightly over her shoulder at Belle. "Maarten Morl loves me, you
  see."</p>

  <p>"Does he? I suppose so. Why didn't you marry him before you went to South
  America?"</p>

  <p>Lili did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Why wait?" urged Belle.</p>

  <p>"I am too young, my father thought. I had no great wish&mdash;for such a
  responsibility. I don't know, it was my father's advice. Other friends were
  coming out, my father thought we should wait until we knew something of the
  country&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or something more of Herr Morl," thought Belle.</p>

  <p>Lili rose.</p>

  <p>"I think that you ought to go now. I'm very, very tired. I've never been
  strong."</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"My mother died of consumption. After she was dead she used to visit me;
  sometimes I've thought that meant that I, too, should die young." Lili wept
  quietly. "Would I had died before I swore a lie. Where can there be
  forgiveness for that? 'God shall destroy thee for ever, thou deceitful
  tongue.'"</p>

  <p>"A weak visionary, after all," thought Belle. She was suddenly weary of
  the girl, of the place, of the interview. She turned abruptly to go, putting
  her papers back into her reticule.</p>

  <p>Lili Schoppe called after her in a tone that made her pause by the open
  door.</p>

  <p>"Maarten Mori loves me, Miss Rastell. There is something strong between
  us. Though I am so young and silly, he holds to me in a way&mdash;he has his
  bad moments, and I can help him."</p>

  <p>"Well, Fräulein Schoppe, well?"</p>

  <p>"Don't interfere with us," pleaded the young girl wildly. "'There are some
  sins written with a pen of iron and the point of a diamond&mdash;the
  deceitful heart cannot deceive God.'"</p>

  <p>Her tears overwhelmed her; as she hid her face in her hands Belle left the
  room.</p>

  <p>Dr. Schoppe was waiting outside on the landing; he glanced at Belle, his
  face twitching with anxiety, but asked no questions as he hurried in to his
  daughter.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On the journey it all seemed stupid and became the most
flimsy and
  ridiculous of masquerades. It had been, of course, from the first moment of
  its inception, a grotesque scheme. Belle, who had always prided herself on
  her common sense, was bitter in self-blame. The prolonged, tedious journey
  across the flats of Holland and Germany, alone in the red plush upholstered
  first-class carriage, was like being in a moving cage&mdash;unable to escape
  by any action whatsoever the company of one's own thoughts. Impossible to
  read, to sew, to scribble; impossible to do anything but to ponder over her
  own absurd position.</p>

  <p>When she rubbed aside the dirt and moisture on the thick glass of the
  carriage window, she could only see a flat grey landscape, a heavy sky; here
  was no change of scene to raise her spirit; she had not escaped winter by
  escaping England. She was alone, yet they were on the same train&mdash;her
  victims&mdash;now she almost felt them to be her masters.</p>

  <p>In what she had done, she had been, so far and outwardly, successful, but
  it was, she now assured herself, too brittle to be of long permanency. One
  does not change oneself by violently altering one's clothes, one's name, by
  moving from one lodging to another. Now it seemed to her, looking back on all
  her actions since Christmas Eve, that she had behaved like one in a delirium,
  with a hectic self-possession and a deliberate precision of gesture and
  speech, belonging properly to one whose mind is confused and whose defences
  are overthrown, but who, by a stern exercise of the intelligence, retains
  command of his faculties.</p>

  <p>"Surely I have been a little mad ever since I went into Daisy's room on
  Christmas morning? And they must have been a little mad to endure me."</p>

  <p>She tried to bring everything down to the basic facts, to a bed-rock of
  common sense; she had a terrible hold over them, and they knew it.</p>

  <p>How skilfully Dr. Schoppe had laboured in his friend's behalf! When they
  had stopped for the first night he had chosen her hotel for her, had attended
  to her with great solicitude so that, she was sure, the people at the hotel
  had taken him for a kindly father or guardian. Then, when he had seen to her
  comfort, her meal, her wine, her fire, her luggage, he had spoken to her a
  few important words.</p>

  <p>As she sat in the rocking train that was speeding onwards with what seemed
  to her a desperate and futile pace, she recalled in a blurred fashion that
  interview.</p>

  <p>She had been so tired; she had been persuaded after her long abstinence to
  take two glasses of wine; she had then felt drowsy, while the good man
  standing there, stout, upright, with shining watch-chain and glittering eyes,
  but with his face ugly, discoloured, had talked to her so earnestly in his
  native language, which she understood so well.</p>

  <p>What had he said? Ah, she could not remember the words, but well enough
  she knew the drift of them. He had endeavoured to persuade her that Daisy
  Arrow had died by her own hand.</p>

  <p>"I will not deny," he had admitted, with greater courage, now they were
  out of England, "that Maarten was there."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't deny it," she had retorted. "I saw him on the stairs," and
  she had closed her eyes as she had spoken, so vividly had come before her the
  image of the young man in the light overcoat which she had never seen him
  wear since, with the kerchief tucked up under his chin&mdash;standing at
  pause, as if she had spoken a word of enchantment or command, on the wretched
  little landing, and making that strange gesture (or had he made it or she
  imagined it?) as if he drew a cross in the air between them.</p>

  <p>"I know, I know," Dr. Schoppe had said, bending low above her so that she,
  and she alone, should hear him distinctly, "Maarten was abroad that night,
  but Lili doesn't know it; I told her the tale that he was in his room with
  one of his headaches&mdash;he has them, you know, terrible headaches when he
  is scarcely accountable for what he does because of the pain&mdash;and it was
  true that he did have one that night and that I went upstairs once to give
  him some medicine&mdash;the second time he had gone out. Perhaps the paper
  was round the tablets."</p>

  <p>"He had gone out," Belle had repeated, drowsy again, half asleep after the
  long travel, the warm fire and the two glasses of wine.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but for no evil purpose. Do you understand? He is at heart a
  missionary, and went out just for a little fresh air; he couldn't resist the
  poor creature whom he saw begging, or so it seemed to him, begging in the
  gutter."</p>

  <p>How long had Dr. Schoppe talked like that?&mdash;Belle thought she had
  slept and woken again, and dreamt several times over that she was slipping a
  key into a knothole in a board, and putting into a carpet bag a pink plume
  that was slightly stained on the mount.</p>

  <p>Well, what kind of a story had Dr. Schoppe tried to make out?</p>

  <p>In an excess of compassion and in his own depression, Herr Morl had spoken
  to poor Daisy Arrow, whom he had seen disconsolate, weeping in her shabby
  garb, he had taken her for warmth and food to a forsaken little table in an
  alcove in the Argyll Rooms.</p>

  <p>"How had he got to the Argyll Rooms?" pondered Belle. "Did I ask Dr.
  Schoppe that? What does it matter! I can hardly expect him to repeat the
  tale."</p>

  <p>What did it amount to, after all? The young minister had gone home with
  the whimpering wretch who so roused his pity in order to persuade her that
  there was hope on earth and in heaven&mdash;hope even for such as she. He had
  read to her out of the little Bible which Belle had afterwards picked up on
  the floor of her room; and then exhaustion and a kind of exultation caused by
  his headache, the medicine that Dr. Schoppe had given him, the lateness of
  the hour, and the strangeness of his situation, had come over him and he had
  fallen asleep. When he had woken, there had been Daisy, those two wounds in
  her neck, the pillow straight and the sheet falling off her body.</p>

  <p>Then the young man's courage had gone. (Oh yes, Dr. Schoppe had admitted
  that frankly.) He had behaved like a fool and a coward.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not in the end so much like a fool and a coward," Belle had
  commented, "seeing that he was acquitted."</p>

  <p>At first he had thought that he could save the girl; he had tried to
  staunch the wounds, had torn up a towel and put a bandage round her
  throat&mdash;then he had seen his own hands and his coat&mdash;stained; he
  had washed his hands in the basin, using all the water there was. By this
  time his agitation had been so overwhelming that he had not noticed the Bible
  which had fallen down on the floor, no, nor the knife, as he had not seen the
  note-paper pulled from his pocket, dropped in the Argyll Rooms.</p>

  <p>"What happened next, you know."</p>

  <p>"Why do you tell me all this?" Belle had asked impatiently. "I don't
  suppose we any of us want to dwell on it. Why refer to it again?"</p>

  <p>And then the German had said heavily, even with an air of menace:</p>

  <p>"Because we are all honest and respectable people, and it is not pleasant
  for me&mdash;for him&mdash;to think that we are being blackmailed, and by a
  woman like you; and what we do for you we do because we are sorry for you as
  he was sorry for her. We allow you to come into Germany; we are willing to
  put up with your pretences and your false name, but you must not think, even
  for a moment in your secret heart, that Maarten was guilty of this
  crime."</p>

  <p>Belle had smiled:</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is better for me if he thinks that he didn't do it,
  considering that I must have something to do with him, I suppose, in the
  future."</p>

  <p>Then Dr. Schoppe had come quickly to a proposal.</p>

  <p>Maarten, very naturally Dr. Schoppe agreed, did not wish to keep any of
  the money subscribed to him by the British public, but it would have caused
  too much of a sensation to have refused it. Between the subscription and the
  expenses paid so lavishly by the British Government, there was something like
  two thousand pounds. Wouldn't she, Belle Adair or Rose Ras
  tell&mdash;whatever name she chose to take&mdash;accept this money and leave
  them?</p>

  <p>Never for a moment had she been tempted by that offer, though now as,
  lolling uncomfortably in the swaying railway carriage, she thought it seemed
  absurdly generous.</p>

  <p>Two thousand pounds to get rid of her! No doubt, though, they wanted to be
  rid of the money, too&mdash;it seemed tainted to them, a reminder of a most
  hideous episode.</p>

  <p>But she did not want it, or not the money alone. She was determined that
  they should supply not only her needs, but her luxuries; she would not accept
  one final sum and let them be rid of her for ever.</p>

  <p>So she had refused, shaking her head from side to side on the cushion on
  the back of the long chair.</p>

  <p>"You can't buy me off, Dr. Schoppe, and pray don't offer to do so
  again."</p>

  <p>Then the tender heart of the man's anguish and terror had come out.</p>

  <p>He was thinking of his daughter&mdash;of his Lili&mdash;who was pining,
  yes, fretting and pining about a tragedy she had not understood, about this
  strange companion so oddly forced upon her, about the lie to which she, so
  honest, so pure-minded and chaste, had sworn in the witness-box.</p>

  <p>Belle had not been in the least moved by pity at the thought of Lili; she
  thought the girl tiresome and priggish&mdash;sickly and dull.</p>

  <p>She had listened with a cold, detached curiosity to Dr. Schoppe's genuine
  anguish; he had tried to move her by telling her the core of his own troubles
  which she had already heard from the girl herself.</p>

  <p>"I persuaded her, you see; I told her that she could rely on it that he
  had been in the house all that evening, but it was not so. She relied on me
  and I told her a lie, I, who trained her to be so truthful."</p>

  <p>"That is a stupid training to give anyone," said Belle. "Life's a little
  too subtle and complicated to be dealt with on terms of absolute candour, Dr.
  Schoppe."</p>

  <p>Then he had begged her to let him know what she wanted.</p>

  <p>She had repeated, weary of his insistence, that she only wanted his
  protection and countenance&mdash;a position in some decent household&mdash;a
  chance to look round&mdash;to regain what she had lost.</p>

  <p>Now, alone in the red-plush-lined carriage, gazing through the blurred
  glass at the drab landscape flying past, she realised the absurdity of these
  demands.</p>

  <p>What did she really want and what could they really give her? Would it not
  have been better to have taken the two thousand pounds and to have gone to
  Paris?</p>

  <p>She asked herself with some bitterness why it was that she, who had been
  so early and so passionately avid after the lusts of the flesh, now found all
  vanity distasteful. She was young to be so sickened of what she had once
  longed for; the coveted sweets had cloyed on her stomach very soon. She was
  surprised at her own disdain of worldliness.</p>

  <p>With that stern habit she had of facing her own moods and whims she pried
  into the recesses of her own mind and discovered that she did not want to
  queen it in the underworld, or hang on to the fringe of the half-world with
  Pastor Morl's two thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>What, then, did she want? And how could she indulge that desire to be
  safe, respected, comfortable and honoured, which had seemed lately her one
  longing?</p>

  <p>"My heart must be dead&mdash;really like ashes."</p>

  <p>She began to think again, the first time for many months, of love. She
  believed that, after all, she might be capable of love, yes, an emotion
  beyond friendship or passion&mdash;far beyond whim or caprice or
  self-interest.</p>

  <p>Well then, to begin anew, throw off the past, as a butterfly throws off
  the withered chrysalis, to find somewhere&mdash;what? A lover, marriage?</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Her tangled thoughts fatigued her; she pulled the cushions
into a more
  comfortable position under her head, and half fell asleep, oppressed by the
  swift monotonous movement, by the strong yet fading light that came through
  the blurred glass window, by the weight of her own cumbrous travelling
  clothes. Her personality expanded into a half-dream which was staged in a
  room, at once opulent and gaudy, of a royal palace, with windows with long,
  monstrous curtains, with great vistas of corridors and audience-chambers; she
  was hurrying through these with Pastor Morl by her side, and they moved as
  figures do in a dream, without touching the floor, without, it seemed, either
  wings or feet; and there in a little closet no bigger than a cupboard sat
  Majesty, who stared at them with heavy, vivid, pale blue eyes, and said in a
  tone of bland authority:</p>

  <p>"Such a mistake should never have been made with a German, with a
  clergyman&mdash;with a man of your religion, with a man of your
  nationality."</p>

  <p>Belle moved, shaking off the obsession, but not able to regain her senses;
  she was lulled again into the insistent nightmare.</p>

  <p>She thought she was cowering under the poor bedclothes at No. 12,
  listening to those voices that sounded through the partition.</p>

  <p>"Reading the Bible to her, wasn't he? And what did she say?"</p>

  <p>She was out on the stair-head again, the empty crock in her hand; she was
  looking down at him, and he was looking up at her; then she was walking
  endlessly through the London streets over the greasy pavement, the fog
  overhead pressing down on her, stinging her eyes, nostrils and on her
  lips&mdash;in front of her the lights, red and blue, of the pawnbroker's
  door&mdash;in front of her another woman singing for a few coppers&mdash;not
  another woman&mdash;Herself? Not herself, but Daisy Arrow.</p>

  <p>She stirred and tried to wake. Another figure had joined her in the empty
  carriage now; she was seated opposite, blotting out the dusty plush, pointing
  with a smile to the red marks on the throat that showed between the soiled
  bow of the white bonnet-strings&mdash;herself or Daisy Arrow?
  Neither&mdash;but all the women whom she had ever known fused into one
  symbolic figure&mdash;Lily Mason, too, the girl who had seemed at first
  nameless, appeared melting into tears as if ashamed of her own grief. And
  that other Lili&mdash;a priggish, silly little missionary, whose fanatic
  piety was so tedious; all these women in one fair-haired phantasm, seated
  opposite in the dusk, pointing to her throat.</p>

  <p>Belle sat up, roused herself with an effort of will; she wanted to escape
  from the train, from the confinement of the carriage, from the motion; she
  flung herself on the valise that was on the seat beside her, unlocked it
  hastily and took out some headache-drops.</p>

  <p>Supposing she was to be ill! That chance reflection shook her dreams
  aside. They would put her into a hospital and get rid of her that way; she
  must maintain a command over her senses.</p>

  <p>They were nearing a station; she saw the dim, shadow&mdash;submerged
  lights of a large town from out the window. Why were they so infinitely
  melancholy? When she had formerly approached a large station she had felt
  some excitement, that of expectation, of arrival, of hope. But now there was
  only this sense of intense loneliness.</p>

  <p>She opened the window, unable to endure any longer the sense of captivity;
  the cool air flew in, and like a wet rag flicked across her face; across the
  murky smudge of sunset sky rose church steeples and factory chimneys in
  black; the stagnant smoke obscured the twilight sky; there was a whistling of
  trains, a grinding of wheels, the clanging of metal on metal.</p>

  <p>They had reached their destination&mdash;she had been told that they
  should be there before it was dark. She had been to Augsburg before, but
  under happier circumstances and in the summer-time.</p>

  <p>How long would they stay here and how would she pass the time? Stolen
  interviews with him in picture-galleries and public parks? She would have to
  endure the crazy adventure because there was nothing else for her to do.
  Cowering from her load of uneasy dreams, she made a pattern with words in her
  disturbed mind:</p>

  <p>"It has all gone to pieces, shivered into little bits; it was all a
  make-belief, a makeshift, a sham. Why didn't I see from the first that while
  I was supposed to be deep in degradation&mdash;wasn't the word I used for
  myself?&mdash;I have never been more degraded than I am now."</p>

  <p>A profound inner loneliness overwhelmed her; she bowed herself on the
  red-plush seat as if she was newly bereaved, and bitterly wondered why there
  was this clinging to life when all that life could give was exhausted or
  lost. In that moment she pitied the man whom she was tormenting, for his
  existence seemed like her own, out of control, distorted, dark and
  unescapable.</p>

  <p>What she could piece together of his history seemed pitiful, the tale of
  one driven by nameless furies into the desperate refuge of religious
  fanaticism. "I don't deny," Dr. Schoppe had said, "that there were tales
  about his youth, and both his father and his brother, but that is
  over&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Belle had not wanted to know any more; it was with the man's future, not
  his past, that she had to deal. However dangerous, strange or unstable he
  was, she could control him, yes, and control that silly little gawk with the
  wooden angel face to whom he had turned in an excess of revulsion against
  himself, or so Belle supposed.</p>

  <p>The train jolted to a standstill. Belle rose and saw the long blank line
  of the grey platform with trucks and sheds beyond.</p>

  <p>She would almost as soon have died as have gone on with the project on
  which she was engaged, only a tenacious courage held her resolute to continue
  the flickering fantasy of the nebulous adventure.</p>

  <p>She opened the carriage door and peered down the drab length of the train.
  There were not many passengers for Augsburg; in the pool of dirty light cast
  by one of the large overhead gas-lamps she saw the little group of people to
  whom she had attached herself, Dr. Schoppe heavy in clumsy
  travelling-clothes, Lili in an unbecoming ulster, the young minister with his
  overcoat collar turned up and a valise in his hand. How commonplace, almost
  droll they looked, tired, irritable travellers fussing over their
  luggage.</p>

  <p>Through Belle's lassitude darted the question:</p>

  <p>"<i>Did</i> he kill Daisy Arrow?"</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Herr Mort came to see Belle in a second-floor parlour at
the comfortable
  hotel where she was staying. From the tall window she could glimpse a
  monstrous statue of a poet, with laurels and lyre, staring down on to a
  Square which was grey and dirty under the heavy slash of the rain; the whole
  place was beyond belief hateful, to Belle it had an odious quality of
  artificiality. That London life which she had been so desperate to end, even
  with a vinegar-stained clasp-knife, had at least been part of a pattern; it
  had grown out of herself, her circumstances, her character, her downfall and
  her misfortunes, every day little familiar occurrences and actions had
  carried out, with a certain logic, that pattern until it had acquired a
  certain familiar orderliness. But in this foreign city there was nothing that
  bore any relation to anything sane or permanent, only a torn fragment of time
  and place that seemed to swing in a void, that belonged to the impossible
  creature whom she had invented&mdash;Rose Rastell, missionary worker, who was
  not a human being at all, but merely a suit of decent clothes, a coil of
  neatly-combed hair, a reticule well filled with money.</p>

  <p>She had braced herself for arguments, entreaties, menaces. No doubt Herr
  Morl had come to offer her again the money&mdash;the two thousand
  pounds&mdash;which she found herself thinking of with longing.</p>

  <p>"Why not take it and go away?" She could travel far with that bribe, to
  the South again, somewhere where the sun shone. Surely she still knew a few
  people who would receive her if she were well dressed and had a little money
  to spend. She waited for the offer and half meant to take it, anything to get
  away.</p>

  <p>But Pastor Morl did not speak of the money. He said at once and
  deliberately as he sat poised on the edge of one of the stiff arm-chairs with
  the wide-fringed chenille seat.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow I shall take you to my mother as we arranged. Lili and her
  father are not coming. They go to Maartensdorf to Dr. Schoppe's sister."</p>

  <p>"I think it would be better if they came with us. It would make the whole
  thing seem less absurd."</p>

  <p>"Would it?" he replied, with a wooden stare. "But Lili is not very
  well&mdash;the journey overwhelmed her&mdash;and she is not happy, as you
  know."</p>

  <p>"She concerns herself too much about me. I have taken no notice of
  her&mdash;she has hardly seen me at all."</p>

  <p>"I know, but she is aware that you are there with us."</p>

  <p>"Well, Fräulein Schoppe is no concern of mine."</p>

  <p>Belle stared across the room with the stiff, ugly furniture at the stiff,
  ugly statue and the rain without.</p>

  <p>Could any of this be endured? Only by thinking of the alternative that
  offered&mdash;her return to England&mdash;to London, where she would be
  nothing, nobody, where she might be marked and watched by Mr. Matchwell, or
  she might be seized on again by Mrs. Bulke, where she might find herself
  trapesing from public-house to public-house with Minnie Palmer.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," she said quickly, "you are wondering why I didn't take the
  money. It would have been the most reasonable and sensible thing to do, and I
  expect you think of me as someone who is, above everything else, reasonable
  and sensible. Well, I'm not&mdash;no&mdash;when Dr. Schoppe offered me the
  two thousand I should have taken it, shouldn't I? I wanted other things
  besides money. The first thing was comfort and ease and getting away
  from&mdash;what seemed to me unendurable. Now that desire has been
  satisfied&mdash;I'm well fed and clothed and a few people have treated me
  respectfully."</p>

  <p>"What, then, do you want now?"</p>

  <p>He had moved to the window as if he preferred that utterly dreary prospect
  to gazing at her where she sat on the long, stiff, horsehair sofa.</p>

  <p>"I want some interest in life. I've never been satisfied yet," she said
  restlessly.</p>

  <p>"And you think you might find that interest with us? I have told you that
  my mother lives very, very quietly."</p>

  <p>"Never mind that. I think it is you, Herr Morl, who attract me. I wonder
  about you so much. I am troubled by the whole story. I'm involved now and I
  can't let go even if I wanted to. At first I thrust myself in and it was an
  effort, but now I can't draw back."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I wonder about you, too, but there hasn't been much time for
  that."</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not." She made an effort to snatch at commonplace. "What
  are you going to do? I mean, I don't know anything about you, really. You
  belong to a church somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"Not now. I have resigned my chaplaincy&mdash;Dr. Schoppe, too, all is
  changed for him. He left his practice, you see, to go with us to
  Brazil&mdash;sold it, he is not young, though he is so vigorous, and I don't
  suppose he'll have much heart for his work just now."</p>

  <p>She sat silent, pondering irritably how the death of Daisy Arrow had
  altered all their lives; she felt very despondent and wished that event,
  which had seemed to her at first full of such exultant results for herself,
  had never happened. If only she could have used the knife on herself before
  Minnie Palmer had run into that underground dressing-room! Why, then probably
  Daisy would still be alive...</p>

  <p>Pastor Morl was staring at her from the window.</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to be very well," he said. "I thought you'd find it
  difficult to brazen it out. Perhaps you're thinking it was foolish of you to
  leave your own country to come here, a stranger, relying on the kind of man
  you must think I am."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Schoppe told me never to think of you as anything&mdash;" Belle could
  not find the words; she saw him smiling over his shoulder&mdash;"I mean I
  promised Dr. Schoppe that I would consider it suicide."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, and so it was, but that makes me a coward and worse, doesn't it?
  A liar, too. Think of the perjury I involved all those people in."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to think of it. I want to look into the future, not into the
  past," said Belle, huddled into a corner of the sofa.</p>

  <p>She was amazed herself at her own lack of courage. She was shivering in
  apprehension and despondency. This dismal room and the view
  without&mdash;that statue, those blank houses, and the rain were defeating
  her, like so many ranked enemies.</p>

  <p>"It is just a question of a point of view," replied the young man. "The
  future might be very gay and magnificent and amusing; it might offer just the
  sort of life that you, I should think, like."</p>

  <p>"Can you get it for me?" she asked. "After a while? I mean that sort of
  life."</p>

  <p>"What should I know of it?" he replied suddenly. "I gave it up, all up,
  didn't I, when I entered the Church?" He turned on her suddenly: "I think it
  would be better for you&mdash;it doesn't matter so much for me&mdash;but I
  think it would be better for you if you took the money and left us&mdash;left
  me."</p>

  <p>"I can't," sighed Belle, "I can't. I'm too tired to travel any more. Let
  me have a little rest."</p>

  <p>He approached her, blocking out the light with his slightly gaunt
  high-shouldered outline. She found him more pleasing to look at than the
  formal ugly room, than the prospect of the wet square, with that banal
  colossal statue holding the huge lyre, from the strings of which the caught
  raindrops fell.</p>

  <p>"I don't mean you any harm," she whispered. "I only ask you to help me
  because I was able to help you&mdash;I don't judge you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why should you?"</p>

  <p>He spoke so harshly that she frowned.</p>

  <p>"Well, Herr Morl, you, not I, stood in the dock."</p>

  <p>"I was tried and acquitted. Perhaps when you stand your trial you will be
  condemned."</p>

  <p>She recalled that blackmail was as definitely an offence against the law
  as murder.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't take much risk," she replied, smiling and staring up at him
  "If it comes to plain speaking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What else but plain speaking should there be between us? You think I am a
  murderer and I know that you are a harlot."</p>

  <p>Belle put the back of her hand over her mouth and sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>"You try to disguise it," continued the young minister quietly, "even from
  yourself&mdash;but that is what you are&mdash;a woman of the streets who was
  living in a brothel. You would be there now but for the money you've extorted
  from me."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it foolish to talk to me like that, Herr Morl? You might find no
  money that you could pay me would keep me quiet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that you are so much to be feared&mdash;a creature of no
  character, confessing to perjury&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop! I am educated, intelligent, I could make them believe me. Besides,
  if the case was reopened your alibi would fall to pieces, you know that you
  slipped through the fingers of the police very easily&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The young man came closer to the couch; his shadow was completely over her
  huddled figure, which was drawn against the stiff cushions.</p>

  <p>"I was acquitted," he said. "They couldn't arrest me again."</p>

  <p>"You weren't on trial&mdash;only charged at the police court. Besides,
  what does that matter? I could always tell what I know to&mdash;well, say to
  your Lili."</p>

  <p>She was exasperated to see the pain and terror, amounting to anguish, that
  this provoked in Herr Morl; he stood helpless, abject before that threat.</p>

  <p>"What is there in that little bigot that you care about so much!" she
  exclaimed, and she thought with gratification and contempt: "<i>There</i> is
  the hold on him&mdash;<i>there</i> is the core of it for him."</p>

  <p>"Lili wouldn't believe it," he whispered.</p>

  <p>"No? Lili guesses too much already to be very incredulous. Even if you
  offered her your explanation of&mdash;suicide&mdash;how account for your
  presence in No. 12, which was, as you said just now, a brothel?"</p>

  <p>"Take the money and go away."</p>

  <p>"Presently, perhaps. I want a rest. I'm tired, tired. I'm curious,
  too."</p>

  <p>"About me?"</p>

  <p>"About you and Lili."</p>

  <p>She rose and so stood facing him, so close that they almost touched; now
  she was reassured as to her hold on him she felt at ease, mistress of herself
  and of him; he would never be free of her while she had it in her power to
  tell her tale to Lili.</p>

  <p>"You'll never understand about me and Lili," he said sullenly. "Never,
  never, do you hear?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I understand. Lili seemed a guardian angel&mdash;but I wonder
  why you needed one?"</p>

  <p>Pastor Morl moved away from her towards the window; his dark outline was
  that of the man who had stood in the dock at Bow Street.</p>

  <p>"Are there not some whom the Lord hath vowed to root out and destroy
  utterly?" he muttered looking sideways into the dark, wet Square. "Are there
  not those of whom the Lord has said&mdash;'Behold, I will make thee a terror
  to thyself and to all thy friends'?"</p>

  <p>Belle sank on to the sofa and clasped her hands on her knees; this
  furtive, odd personality excited, almost attracted her; she felt that she was
  becoming more interested in the man than in what she hoped to obtain from
  him. It was a strange face on which the grey light fell, and it looked now as
  it had looked when she had first seen it on the landing of Mrs. Bulke's
  house. Pale shadows modelled the hollows of the fine features, the eyes, of
  that shade of grey that is near lavender, had an odd blank, silver look under
  the dark brows, so that they appeared dices of metal. The sensitive mouth
  with the arched upper lip, pale but firmly set, the slightly-aquiline nose
  with the thin nostrils, combined to give that appearance of romantic good
  looks that had proved so useful to Maarten Morl in London; there was a sheen
  of dark gold in the harsh, stiff brown hair and no other brightness in the
  head and face that was like, in this dead-toned light, a bust in deep-toned
  alabaster with silver eyes. Belle, in her fascinated scrutiny of this
  stranger who had become of such absorbing importance in her life, could not
  decide if this lean countenance expressed weakness or strength, cruelty or
  nobility&mdash;none, she thought. Yet all these qualities were in reserve in
  those handsome features. How heavily he was dressed in dark clothes and a
  white kerchief&mdash;a clerical attire, she supposed.</p>

  <p>"How much longer do you want to stare at me?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. <i>You</i> are staring at <i>me</i>. I suppose we are very
  curious about one another."</p>

  <p>She glanced sideways at herself in the long, black-spotted mirror that
  hung behind the side-table with the thumbed time-tables and guide-books. She
  was worthy to hold a man's gaze&mdash;a different creature from she who had
  gazed at herself in the scrap of mirror in the dressing-room under the stage
  of the Cambridge. Her smooth elegance of attire, of banded hair, of pure
  carnation, of delicate straight feature, was carefully set off by her ardent
  air, her graceful poise; her eyes sparkled, there was a lustre on her lip,
  her cheek, and the line of the long throat and slight bosom was flawless.</p>

  <p>"Well," muttered the young minister, "well, I shall come to-morrow to take
  you to Schloss Morl&mdash;I don't suppose that it is in the least like what
  you imagine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't care&mdash;it is in the forest?"</p>

  <p>"In the forest, yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, that will do. Somewhere where I can rest. I'm so tired."</p>

  <p>"And for the future? You will go away&mdash;with money, of course, but you
  will go away, so that we&mdash;Lili and I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was vexed by that broken sentence; the hold of that sickly young bigot
  on this strange man annoyed her; she remembered what Dr. Schoppe had told her
  of the lovers' first meeting&mdash;the fainting fit, the fall from the horse,
  the nursing by the doctor's daughter. In the dock also he had fallen
  unconscious&mdash;perhaps he was a man haunted, whose daemon became at times
  suddenly visible, perhaps Lili was the charmer whose presence kept the demon
  at bay. 'Wanderer to the Moon. Wanderer to the Moon.'</p>

  <p>"I can't answer for the future," she said.</p>

  <p>Herr Morl picked up his hat and stick and left her as if dismissed.</p>

  <p>"The rebuke of the Lord cometh in flames of fire," he whispered, and was
  gone, walking softly.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The railway line came to an end where the last outpost
trees of the pine
  forests sloped down from the hills. The rest of the way to Schloss Morl they
  had to take a carriage. Belle noted at once that it was a commodious,
  fashionable equipage, drawn by two glossy horses and driven by a
  comfortable-looking servant in clean livery. Her spirits, which had been so
  profoundly depressed by the crooked, wet city, rose again with the keen
  freshness of the air, the distant blue vistas of mountains, the noble forest
  of dark pine-trees that were beginning to be burnished by the spring, to
  right and left.</p>

  <p>This was a new world surely&mdash;a fresh experience, which would help to
  make the past remote, even to blot it out altogether.</p>

  <p>But her pleasure was soon overclouded; she remembered days of her youth
  spent in Germany, picnics in some such woods as these, joyful excursions with
  light-hearted friends, the gathering of early wind-flowers, so frail that it
  seemed indeed as if the west breeze had scattered them and would blow them
  away again. Under some such dark trees she had experienced too much for too
  brief a time. In early days life had been spoilt for her and was now likely
  to be a barren waste, unless she could fill it with some high fantastic
  passion, some strange and gaudy adventure.</p>

  <p>She was intensely conscious of the young minister sitting beside her in
  the carriage; lately he had began to absorb much of her attention&mdash;more
  of her attention than she had ever given to anyone save herself. An intense
  curiosity&mdash;which it was not by any means, as she frequently reminded
  herself, to her advantage to gratify&mdash;troubled her with regard to Pastor
  Morl. She had, for her own convenience and conscience' sake, persuaded
  herself that the story of Daisy Arrow's suicide was true, but, though she had
  so persuaded herself, how overlook the little German letter that she had
  taken from Roger Owen? How prevent her mind from dwelling in a teasing
  fashion on the relations of those two people, the dead woman, the man accused
  of slaying her? What could these two have been when they had first met years
  ago in Germany? Was it by arrangement or mere coincidence that they had met
  again in the Argyll Rooms? And what manner of man was this who had impressed
  a character like Dr. Schoppe's (of whose simplicity and sincerity Belle had
  no doubt) with his piety and missionary zeal, and who yet had been entangled
  in some affair, ordinary and sordid enough no doubt, but likely to be
  regarded with horror by Lili and her father.</p>

  <p>Belle tried resolutely to put these problems from her mind. In anger she
  warned herself, "I shall go on thinking of him till there's nothing else in
  my mind."</p>

  <p>She begged him to let down the window that the cool air might blow in; as
  he obeyed she leaned forward and stared into the rich gloom of the
  forest.</p>

  <p>With an instinct of breeding she endeavoured to assure him with regard to
  his mother. She addressed him formally, for through precision she endeavoured
  to put some reality into their fantastic relations.</p>

  <p>"I want you to believe, Herr Morl, that nothing that I shall do or say
  could possible offend your mother. I will try all I can to be an amiable
  companion to her. I suppose I shan't stay there long. You will be able to
  think of something else for me, no doubt."</p>

  <p>He gave her a look which she thought was barbed with irony, and asked:</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do for you, once again&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"You must know somebody in some German city&mdash;oh, a long way from here
  if you please&mdash;I only need a proper introduction. Perhaps I shall keep a
  small academy for deportment and elocution and music&mdash;I know enough to
  teach a little, and that would be an opening into society."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I might find you that. Anything if you will go away. Here, if you
  please, we get down and walk."</p>

  <p>He opened the door and sprang from the carriage.</p>

  <p>"The road any further is impossible for the horses. For them it is miles
  round and I become impatient after the railway carriage."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Belle, "I, too, should like to walk."</p>

  <p>"Your luggage will go round the long way, and now we are free."</p>

  <p>He set a quick pace and they stepped side by side up the slope that was
  covered thickly by tall pines; underneath were last year's cones, brown and
  open in stiff wooden petals, and a thick carpet of pine-needles, soft to the
  feet.</p>

  <p>Belle felt a deep sensation of relief and pleasure. There was something
  inspiring in walking quickly, in climbing, keeping one's face upwards turned
  to some high objective; it was, she thought, delightful.</p>

  <p>Her companion seemed pleased, too&mdash;a different man from the man whom
  she had known in London, or on the journey, or in that drab room in
  Augsburg.</p>

  <p>"Is it not strange," he said, "how much one can forget?"</p>

  <p>"You are fortunate. I, alas, remember everything."</p>

  <p>"I know," he looked about him, "I remember this and the games I used to
  have here when I was a boy home for holidays, and country walks too, when I
  used to fancy I was going to be a poet and come here to write verses. Oh, I
  had some high ideas, I assure you."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, you are like me, Herr Morl, you remember everything."</p>

  <p>"Little trivial things like that&mdash;but a great many more important
  things I forget. It's just as well, don't you think? If everything remained
  on one's mind surely one would go mad."</p>

  <p>She had thought that they would climb for hours, and she had lost a sense
  of their destination, when suddenly he said: "There is the house," and with a
  sense of shock she saw the building appear behind the dark plumes and rough
  orange-red stems of the pines.</p>

  <p>It was a modest, severe white mansion with a blank façade, set in the
  midst of 'the forest, with a small garden back and front, and the ground
  rising behind covered by the thinning pine-trees.</p>

  <p>"It was the hunting lodge of the old Schloss," said Herr Morl, "but that
  has long gone to ruins and we have lived here for about a hundred years. We
  have never been a large family and this is big enough."</p>

  <p>Belle was disappointed. In the hideous commonplace of the London she had
  known she had thirsted for something that was fantastic&mdash;magnificent,
  and this was neither, but an ordinary house with a drab look.</p>

  <p>"You heard, I think, that I was very wealthy&mdash;that's the tale they
  told in London, but it was exaggerated. We never had so much and my brother
  was extravagant. Many of the farms and estates worth money were sold."</p>

  <p>Belle hardly heard what the young minister said. She was considering the
  place, the house, from her own point of view. Could she live there
  contentedly? Was this a haven? What manner of creature was his mother, and
  how many servants did they keep? What society was there?</p>

  <p>These questions rushed to her lips, but she repressed them. Better to go
  on quietly and see what happened from day to day.</p>

  <p>Her hold over him seemed very frail now. In London she had been almost
  intoxicated with a sense of power, but now even the Bible and the letters, so
  securely locked away in the bottom of her valise, seemed futile and rather
  silly. And this was not the castle in the forest of which she had dreamt.</p>

  <p>They came round, walking over pine-needles, to the front of the house,
  which was flat, save for the classic portico of the large door, either side
  of which was carved a hound in stone. At the left side was the ruin of an
  enormous lime-tree far older than the building, buckled with iron to keep
  rain water from rotting it, and supported by chains and staves of metal.</p>

  <p>"What manner of tree is that?"</p>

  <p>"A lime; it still bears a few flowers, of which they make <i>tilleul</i>
  tea in the summer. It is supposed to be six hundred years old."</p>

  <p>"Summer," sighed Belle. "I wish it were summer now&mdash;how many more
  months? Can one find now a few flowers in the woods?"</p>

  <p>He pulled the chain that hung by the neat door&mdash;she heard the clang
  of an iron clapper; it seemed to echo into emptiness.</p>

  <p>"Flowers?" said Herr Morl. "You have already had the snowdrops in
  London."</p>

  <p>She was surprised that he cared to remind her of that, surprised that he
  was smiling at her quite complacently.</p>

  <p>A clean, agreeable-looking manservant in a neat livery opened to them.</p>

  <p>The white-washed hall was plain, save for, high on the walls, a painted
  wooden escutcheon, with stags' head either side; it was a very ordinary
  house; Belle remembered many such places from her schooldays. Herr Morl's
  wealth and importance had indeed been exaggerated.</p>

  <p>She followed the servant into a good-sized room at the back of the house.
  The high windows were uncurtained and the pine-trees they showed were so near
  that they seemed to enter and dominate the house. Yes, everywhere Belle
  looked&mdash;a window, and the pine woods, a glimpse of the hillside between
  them, and the day closing down into a clear twilight.</p>

  <p>The furnishing was austere&mdash;some old highly-polished dark pieces,
  harsh against the white walls, a heavy lantern hanging from the centre of the
  ornate stucco ceiling, no cushions, draperies, or mirrors, no glow of any
  flames; a large white porcelain stove gave out a heavy heat.</p>

  <p>A stout lady with thin iron-grey hair, tightly-banded either side of her
  large ears, and a round red face, was waiting for them in the centre of this
  room.</p>

  <p>She greeted the young clergyman with a controlled but emphatic interest,
  and gave Belle her hand, looking at her without either curiosity or doubt; by
  nothing did she betray what this meeting might mean to her&mdash;what anxiety
  she had endured or felt now.</p>

  <p>Belle was confounded&mdash;a little disappointed. It seemed as if all her
  calculations were wrong. Why had she supposed that the young man's mother
  would be a delicate, simple, shy creature? What silly convention had made her
  after all her experience associate the word "mother" with some frail,
  half-sickly creature? This woman was robust and vigorous, with small clever
  eyes and a heavy jaw.</p>

  <p>Belle, trying to gather her wits together, wondered how much she knew of
  the Daisy Arrow affair? What version, distorted or glossed over, had been
  told her? Had she seen any of the English newspapers?</p>

  <p>The young man had introduced her by merely saying:</p>

  <p>"This is Miss Rastell, mother, of whom I told you. She is to be your guest
  for a while."</p>

  <p>With that he left her alone with Frau Morl, who had questioned her in a
  courteous, ordinary way as to the details of her journey&mdash;her
  impressions of Germany&mdash;and all the other little commonplaces usually
  employed to put strangers at their ease.</p>

  <p>Belle, though it cost her an effort, thought it as well to break through
  this at once.</p>

  <p>"You must wonder at me and why I am here."</p>

  <p>"Not at all, my dear; sit down, take off your bonnet&mdash;your coat and
  gloves too, it is warm in here with the stove."</p>

  <p>"I don't know how much your son has told you about me, Frau Mori."</p>

  <p>"He has said that you were a very good friend to him and to little Lili
  and to Dr. Schoppe, in London&mdash;that you had tastes in common, is it not
  so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Belle steadily; "I am interested in missionary work. I was
  doing some of that in London."</p>

  <p>"So," nodded Frau Morl, looking at her steadily. "It is a good work and I
  congratulate you."</p>

  <p>"Before that," said Belle, slightly closing her eyes like one who takes a
  fence&mdash;a high fence&mdash;"I was on the stage."</p>

  <p>"Were you? So, too," smiled the stout lady, "was I. Does it surprise you?"
  she added, with a swift smile which made her broad face attractive. "I used
  to be a singer, even in opera a little, and before that&mdash;before I found
  I had a voice&mdash;I used to act. But when I married I left the stage."</p>

  <p>"You know something, then," said Belle, "of what that life is like?"</p>

  <p>She thought to herself: "I wondered why he didn't make more trouble at
  bringing me here. I can see that his mother is very well able to look after
  herself. I think myself so clever, and yet I was such a fool as to imagine
  some silly shrinking old lady who knew nothing."</p>

  <p>"You are very welcome," said Frau Morl, taking from Belle her jacket and
  bonnet. "My son says that we can do no less than let you stay here as long as
  you will, and I am very pleased. But you will find it dull until you are used
  to it. I found it dull, even with a husband and two sons." She smiled again,
  and her small deep-set eyes never moved from Belle's face. "Forgive me, but
  you are very pretty and elegant to be a missionary worker. You look pale,
  too; you need a rest, no doubt."</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Belle faintly. "I'm tired, Frau Morl, tired."</p>

  <p>"Do you know Germany?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was here as a schoolgirl."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is why you speak our language so well. That's a good thing, for
  I know no English."</p>

  <p>Belle suddenly found herself talking in a high rapid voice that sounded
  unnatural in her own ears.</p>

  <p>"It must seem very odd to you, Frau Morl, for me to come here like
  this&mdash;and I find it odd too. You know, it's all been so strange&mdash;my
  meeting with your son&mdash;the queer episode."</p>

  <p>Belle was then silent suddenly, again wondering how much this stout woman
  with the high colour knew of the crime at No. 12.</p>

  <p>"It was stupid of me not to have asked him that. I thought I was so sharp,
  but after all I have been quite stupid&mdash;what am I doing here? What use
  will this place, this woman be to me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you were saying?" asked Frau Morl pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Only&mdash;that I don't know quite what your son told you&mdash;or if Dr.
  Schoppe wrote to you?"</p>

  <p>The other woman smiled at her without replying.</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Belle, "you do know something, do you not, Frau Morl?"</p>

  <p>The room was certainly overheated; she put her hand to her head and made
  an effort to speak again.</p>

  <p>Frau Morl checked her.</p>

  <p>"I know something. You were good to Lili, that is enough. I hope the dear
  child will soon come here&mdash;she is so fond of you."</p>

  <p>"Has she been writing to you of me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, she has written such long letters, all of your goodness and
  kindness. Now think no more of anything. I am glad to make this little
  return&mdash;to offer you this little holiday. I will go to see that the
  supper is all nice for you; I will send them in with candles and here is a
  maid who will take you to your room."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Has this really happened to me?" thought Belle. "I don't
believe any of
  it."</p>

  <p>She had been shown into a large plain room with whitewashed walls and
  stuccoed ceiling, on which was a heavy bas-relief of flowers and shells; two
  tall windows at which were plain muslin curtains, opened out on to the pine
  forest. She had the impression here that she had had in other rooms in the
  house&mdash;that the forest was crowding in, shadowing every corner of every
  apartment&mdash;the atmosphere was quite different from anything to which she
  had been used. The bed had white dimity curtains, a white coverlet; there was
  hot water in a can of shining brass; a small white porcelain stove, which
  seemed to have been newly lit, did no more than take the chill off the keen
  air. There was a shelf of devotional books between the windows; there was one
  candle, one only, on the table by the bed.</p>

  <p>Frau Morl looked in to see if her guest was comfortable.</p>

  <p>"She can't have heard," thought Belle, "of what happened in London. She is
  far too calm."</p>

  <p>"Do you feel at home?" asked the German lady pleasantly, "everything is
  agreeable to you? To-morrow, I hope we have little Lili. All this has been
  very sad for her."</p>

  <p>"Lili has been very brave," said Belle in a noncommittal tone. Then, at a
  tangent, guarding herself by foolishness: "She speaks English very well."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I not a word," Frau Morl laughed, went to the window and peered
  out between the muslin blinds. "You saw the lime-tree?&mdash;it's supposed to
  be very, very old. From your window you can see it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, how odd it looks! All chained and plated and supported with
  iron."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Sometimes when the wind is high the chains rattle, but I sleep so
  heavily I do not notice it."</p>

  <p>"You have no garden?" asked Belle.</p>

  <p>The twilight had thickened; the other woman's personality, the other
  woman's house oppressed her roused senses.</p>

  <p>"No, not here. We are on the slope and in the middle of the woods and it
  is difficult. But a little way down I have a garden, yes, just a small
  garden. There is not much that grows in it, but I have some pretty moss
  roses."</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" asked Belle.</p>

  <p>"What did I say? I say that in my little garden there grow some moss
  roses."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle savoured in the first few days of her stay the new
life carefully
  and deliberately, as an epicure will turn over on his palate a fresh flavour,
  finding a certain gusto even in the novelty.</p>

  <p>This was quite different from what she had expected when she had decided
  impetuously to try her fortunes in Germany. She had longed for splendour, a
  touch of fantasy, a hint of magnificence, but there was nothing of that. She
  had hoped at least for luxury&mdash;stiff and old-fashioned perhaps&mdash;but
  there was none. Frau Morl lived with monotonous precision. Repose and comfort
  might be obtained in her house in the pine woods, there was good, if coarse,
  food, long hours of leisure, regular service, but no more.</p>

  <p>"My son," said Frau Morl, "almost insists that I need a companion. He told
  me that he had found one in you, and though you are very pleasant, dear Miss
  Rastell, pray don't be offended with me when I said that I don't really need
  a companion."</p>

  <p>She was a very ordinary woman, yet, because of this, perhaps, strange to
  Belle. She occupied herself in her household, in helping to manage the
  affairs of her son's estate. She had a little room set up as an office and
  every day the steward called, walking over from his own house a little lower
  down the wooded slope, to discuss business with her. She managed too, and by
  herself, her household, the maidservants, the menservants, the stables, the
  dogs, the forest and the arable land adjoining them.</p>

  <p>"You wonder how I learnt all this?" she smiled to Belle, "when I was
  brought up so differently&mdash;for the stage and music. Well, my dear, there
  was nothing else to do."</p>

  <p>For Belle there was nothing to do now. She made herself little tasks; she
  tried to help Frau Morl in her energetic duties, but she was not necessary to
  the ordered life of the placid household; she had too much leisure.</p>

  <p>Yet the acrid flavour of this new life was not altogether displeasing, nor
  was the cool company of this capable woman, who seemed to take her for
  granted, without a soothing effect.</p>

  <p>"It is," she would say to herself, when she would put out her one candle
  and lie down in the bed with the white dimity curtains, and listen to the
  sighs of the pine branches without, "a pleasant interlude; one need not worry
  as to what should happen next."</p>

  <p>She walked in the woods alone or with the dogs, as Frau Morl seldom left
  the house save on Sundays to go to their church in the village. She was pious
  in a practical fashion; strangely enough&mdash;Lutheran, in a country largely
  Roman Catholic. Belle learned that it was owing to her powerful persuasion
  that her younger son had entered the Church.</p>

  <p>Belle had prepared several plausible stories to account for herself, for
  her past, for the police-court affair in London, but Frau Morl never
  questioned her on any of these subjects. This made everything easier for
  Belle; yet, perversely, she longed to talk about her strange situation. She
  was almost fretted because Frau Morl never said to her: "Who are you after
  all? What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>The young clergyman himself was, as she supposed, in Augsburg or
  Maartensdorf. He never came to the house during those last weeks of winter.
  If he wrote to his mother Belle did not know of it; but she felt secure; as
  long as she was there in his home she could not lose her hold on him; but she
  began to wonder if to keep her hold on him was what she most desired.</p>

  <p>Often she would beguile the long hours of the cold spring evenings, when
  the needlework she had forced on herself would drop from her hands, or the
  book she had laid on her knee would close over her fingers, by laying her
  plans for the future.</p>

  <p>This could not go on. There was something in the house&mdash;in the
  mistress of the house, even in the servants, that acted like a drug or a
  charm. She could believe that she was under some light
  enchantment&mdash;there in this clockwork routine, which was really so futile
  and meaningless, in the middle of these monstrous woods backed by these huge
  mountains, waiting, always waiting, and glad to wait.</p>

  <p>"He must have something to suggest, or I must suggest something," and her
  mind turned over projects&mdash;a little academy for girls down in the city,
  or a position as companion to a lady of rank. "How tired I must
  be&mdash;tired of myself and of the world&mdash;to endure this at all."</p>

  <p>Once she asked Frau Mori about Lili Schoppe.</p>

  <p>The answer was short and to the point:</p>

  <p>"The girl is not well&mdash;she seems to be fretting, she is with her
  father at Maartensdorf."</p>

  <p>"What! Still not well and still fretting?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Frau Morl decidedly, "the marriage has had to be postponed. It
  was to have been in May, you know. I cannot persuade her to come up here; I
  thought she would have been so pleased to be with you."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle decided that she did not like the house&mdash;so
plain, so
  old-fashioned, so blank, inside and out, with bare whitewashed walls and
  stucco ceilings and the large and highly-polished furniture&mdash;that sense
  of the woods encroaching on it, overwhelming it&mdash;the stout woman in her
  widow's dress with her key-basket, going cheerfully, practically, about her
  tasks, and the well-kept servants in their clean liveries.</p>

  <p>What was wrong with all this? What was wrong? What was so dreadfully
  amiss?</p>

  <p>There were times when Belle would have preferred to have found herself in
  Mrs. Bulke's kitchen.</p>

  <p>She persuaded herself that there was nothing wrong with Schloss Morl.
  What, indeed, could there have been? It was, as her knowledge of Germany told
  her, an ordinary establishment of an ordinary country gentleman. There was
  nothing peculiar in Frau Morl's monotonous existence, though it seemed odd
  after Belle's London life. The widow was lonely no doubt, but she had her
  friends, elderly people, quietly dressed, who came on brief occasional
  visits; she had her days when the carriage was ordered and she drove through
  the forest&mdash;to Maartensdorf, Belle supposed, or to a neighbouring house.
  She never asked her guest to accompany her on these drives, and she never
  went with Belle on those walks that the Englishwoman took through the woods
  or down to the village. Frau Morl's courtesy had a blank quality; she seemed
  to take her guest for granted in a fashion that set her more completely the
  other side of a barrier than any resentment or rage could have done. She
  seemed quite indifferent as to whether this was a serpent or a dove that she
  cherished in the midst of her austere household; never by a look or gesture
  did she betray what her feelings were towards her dead husband and her dead
  son, or towards Maarten and Lili, how she had viewed the expedition to
  Brazil, or how that sudden cancellation of that project and the disaster that
  had led to her son's return to Germany.</p>

  <p>Belle asked herself continually:</p>

  <p>"What does she know?"</p>

  <p>The servants were as reserved as their mistress; cheerful, well-trained
  and industrious, they accepted the Englishwoman as a matter of course, and
  Belle could not penetrate behind their hard civility. She tried to engage the
  chambermaid who waited on her, the woman she saw sweeping out the large
  rooms, the boy bringing up bundles of faggots to the outhouse, the man coming
  from the stables with dogs to exercise in cunningly casual conversation as to
  the history of the Mod' family. She wanted to know something of Maarten's
  father, of his brother who had died so young, of Maarten's childhood and
  youth, of the impression his entering the ministry had made on his friends
  and servants. Her curiosity had to remain unsatisfied, she could not break
  down a taciturnity that was either deep loyalty or intense stupidity. Her
  resentment grew; she had from the first disliked Frau Morl, and she looked
  forward to the moment when that stolid woman, either so firmly controlled or
  so completely ignorant, would have to learn that Miss Rastell had not come to
  Schloss Morl merely to amuse herself. Yet so weary was Belle, so grateful for
  ease, peace and comfort, that she was content to delay all action. The
  precise, spacious house, the orderly service, the austerity and purity of the
  dark forest, seemed to be slowly cleansing her from the soilure of incredible
  humiliations. Because of that, she endured everything.</p>

  <p>There was an acrid satisfaction in the sounds of the routine of labour,
  the steady swish-swish of a broom, the splash of water from a tap, the gush
  of water from a pail, the voices of the grooms and stable boys as they were
  dressing the horses, the brisk rubbing of cloths on the waxed furniture;
  there was a bitter-sweet train of memory aroused by the smell of coffee and
  hot bread, of savoury dishes and wood burning. There was something soothing
  in the spotless rooms, the white finely-starched coverlets and curtains in
  her bedchamber, the brilliantly-polished windows, the cool linen sheets,
  faintly smelling of herbs, the gleaming porcelain and heavy silver of the
  table services. All these details made up a pattern of life that was decent,
  self-respecting, of almost conventual peace and austerity. To such a life had
  Belle been trained; misfortune had brought a violent dislocation of ingrained
  habits, had outraged carefully-trained refinements and delicacies, and the
  sudden return to what she had feared was for ever lost seemed all she wanted.
  Yet there were times when she felt so alien, so forlorn, so purposeless, set
  in this strange background that almost she would have been again in
  London.</p>

  <p>But fatigue and relief conquered this restless revulsion against futile
  monotony&mdash;she was safe, she was cleansed, she had struggled out of the
  filth.</p>

  <p>Once the young minister came to Schloss Morl. Belle, peering from her
  window as the dusk fell, saw the neat carriage drive up the well-gravelled
  drive and Herr Morl alight. It had been a wet day, a streak of cold light
  showed behind the gaunt twisted outline of the old iron-chained, iron-propped
  lime-tree, the harsh, stiff boughs of the firs glittered with raindrops;
  Belle felt a rising excitement at the presence of this man and at the thought
  of the power she had over him. Had he come to make a final reckoning with
  her?</p>

  <p>She was quite ready for that, though she did not know what she wanted of
  him.</p>

  <p>But she did not see him. Her dinner was served alone in the large
  white-walled dining-room. Frau Morl dined with her son in her little
  apartment where she interviewed the steward, the tenants and the
  servants.</p>

  <p>"Do they think that they can evade me like that? Well, I can wait. I'm
  tired and there is no great hurry. I'm tired."</p>

  <p>She felt restless and could not eat; the thought of the interview between
  mother and son teased her; how much were they in each other's confidence?
  Perhaps they were planning defences against her, perhaps he was telling that
  cool, reserved woman a tale full of lies, perhaps they were discussing
  Lili...</p>

  <p>Belle contrived to pass along the corridor outside Frau Morl's room; she
  could hear the murmur of voices&mdash;the man's clear, deep tones, the
  woman's harsh hum. She hurried on. She had been reminded of that same male
  voice as she had heard it through the walls of Daisy Arrow's room.</p>

  <p>The past impinged on the present, destroying it; Belle hastened to the
  large salon where she usually spent her evenings; it was an apartment too
  large for intimate comfort; the shutters had not been closed, and Belle saw
  the dark sky behind the darker pines. A servant was attending to the fire;
  Belle had a longing to talk to someone, but hardly knew what to say to the
  florid, neat girl who knelt before the rising flames. At random she
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Don't you find it lonely here?"</p>

  <p>"No, Fräulein."</p>

  <p>"Not even in the winter?"</p>

  <p>"No, Fräulein."</p>

  <p>Belle seated herself close to the fire.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember the late Herr Morl?"</p>

  <p>"No, Fräulein."</p>

  <p>"The elder son, then? He must have died young."</p>

  <p>"That was before I came here." The girl rose from her knees and carefully
  dusted her apron with her thick fingers.</p>

  <p>"Well, you have heard something, I suppose?" said Belle sharply. "You need
  not be so careful, I know more about this family than you think."</p>

  <p>The servant gave a glance of apprehension that betrayed her; Belle
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you're afraid. You've been told to keep quiet. Well, it doesn't
  really matter."</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything, Fräulein."</p>

  <p>The girl moved away.</p>

  <p>Belle rose impatiently and without speaking again left the room as the
  servant was closing the shutters, hiding the dark sky, the darker trees.</p>

  <p>In her bed-chamber Belle saw them again, for her windows were still
  unguarded to the night. The white draperies of the bed and dressing-table
  showed cold as ice in the thick dusk. Belle lit her candle, unlocked her
  wardrobe, and took out her valise. She felt herself forced to open it now and
  then, to handle the Bible, the plume of livid pink feathers, the two silly
  letters she had obtained from Roger Owen.</p>

  <p>On her knees by the valise, the Bible in her hands, she stared up at the
  two black squares of the windows as if she feared watchful eyes were prying
  from the dense blackness of the pine boughs, as if she heard his voice
  murmuring amid the faint sounds of the forest.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When Belle came down in the morning she learnt that Herr
Morl had departed
  very early.</p>

  <p>She was disappointed and angry.</p>

  <p>"How easily he takes it! I must begin to let him understand that I am not
  to be played with&mdash;does he spend his time with Lili?"</p>

  <p>Frau Morl was also abroad; she had gone down to Maartensdorf and would not
  return until late in the day. An almost intolerable loneliness possessed
  Belle; she went out into the forest, climbing the mountain flank where the
  tall pines thinned. All was fair and lovely after the rain; as the impatient
  woman hurried on she was brought to a pause by the sight of lilies of the
  valley, trembling white bells in pale leaves, growing in the shadow of the
  trees.</p>

  <p>This beauty scattered on the earth caused her to lift her eyes to the sky;
  a golden warmth in the tender azure beyond the mountains, a perfume in the
  pure air she breathed, a sudden shrill call of a bird, all were gentle signs
  of the turn of the year.</p>

  <p>Belle stood still; she was moved by some undefinable emotion of nostalgia
  and regret; words once familiar but long unfamiliar came to her mind, almost
  to her lips as she stood caressed by the breath of spring&mdash;"according to
  Thy promise."</p>

  <p>She stooped to gather the frail lilies from out the cool shade, but a
  sudden memory stayed her as sharply as if someone had clutched her arm
  warning her of danger. The insipid blossoms reminded her of a sick girl, a
  plaster angel, the nameless creature who had called herself Lily
  Mason&mdash;Lili, the little missionary in her nightgown and white shawl, as
  she had seen her in the London hotel.</p>

  <p>Belle returned sullenly to Schloss Morl; she was no longer conscious that
  it was spring-tide in the wood.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When she reached the house she noticed that the large bed-
chamber in the
  front was being prepared for a guest, and she learnt that when Frau Morl
  returned she would bring Fräulein Lili with her for a long visit.</p>

  <p>The young lady had been ill, the chambermaid said, and the doctors thought
  that the pines, the mountain air and the constant company of Herr Morl would
  effect a cure.</p>

  <p>"He is returning too, your master?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. We have also to get his rooms ready. It is a long time since he
  stayed here for more than a night. What a pity that there are no flowers for
  Fräulein Lili's room."</p>

  <p>"I saw some in the forest to-day."</p>

  <p>"I meant garden flowers, Fräulein. There is nothing out in Frau Morl's
  garden, nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"Why is she coming here?" thought Belle with restless anger. "Because she
  is suspicious of me? Trying to defeat me? Why can't she let him go? How could
  he be destined for her?"</p>

  <p>She was conscious of an irritation against Lili Schoppe that almost
  amounted to hatred; she had almost decided that she could no longer endure
  Schloss Morl and that the moment had come to force Herr Morl to do something
  else for her, but now that he was bringing Lili to this house, Belle decided
  to remain and to keep these two under her observation. She began to find that
  these strange emotions of curiosity, interest, attraction and dislike were
  more important to her than her own advantage.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">During the first days of Lili's visit Belle watched keenly
the three
  people in whom she took so absorbing an interest. The young minister and his
  promised wife seemed on terms of common devotion; they were seldom apart;
  Herr Morl took no notice of Belle whatever and little of his mother; the
  large parlour with the white porcelain stove, which had been the first room
  that Belle had entered in the prim mansion, was given up to their use.</p>

  <p>Lili was not able to go abroad even on the mild spring days; she would sit
  beside the stove wrapped in a thick white shawl, her small feet on a
  foot-stool, an unread book or an unfurled roll of knitting across her knee;
  and the young man would sit opposite&mdash;reading or talking
  earnestly&mdash;trying to interest her, to amuse her; no doubt, thought
  Belle, trying to make her forget.</p>

  <p>Belle often saw them like that as she passed the open door, or went in
  front of the long windows and glimpsed them from behind the clean
  tightly-drawn muslin curtains. She learned much of the lovers from the
  conversation of Frau Morl, who often spoke of her son and Lili. As the quiet
  woman sat with her guest in the evenings she would dwell on Lili, on her
  quiet childhood in Maartensdorf, where she had been brought up in a most
  rigid and narrow piety by a mother who had been, Frau Mori declared, almost a
  saint. Lili had never had a thought beyond her religion&mdash;her Bible, her
  prayer-book, her church services, her Sunday School classes, until she had
  met Maarten Mort.</p>

  <p>She had early considered herself dedicated to missionary work, of which
  she had heard much from her father who, as a youth, had gone as a doctor with
  several missions to Africa and Jamaica.</p>

  <p>"She met my son," said Frau Morl, knitting vigorously, and never looking
  up from the flashing steel needles, "under peculiar circumstances when he was
  ill. He was attracted to her at once; they became betrothed within a few
  weeks; a few months more and the mission to Brazil was arranged. You can see
  how suitable it all seemed. Lili thought the hand of God was in it&mdash;that
  they were reserved for great blessings&mdash;and I," added Frau Morl,
  "thought so too."</p>

  <p>Belle replied cautiously&mdash;she had grown into the habit of always
  using prudence when she spoke to her pleasant, reserved hostess.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why they gave it up. They had every encouragement to
  proceed&mdash;even if the ship had to sail from England without them, there
  must have been several others."</p>

  <p>"It was Lili," said Frau Morl, still with her glance on the small stitches
  she was lifting from one needle to another. "It seems just as if her heart
  had been broken. My son," she added with emphasis, "was acquitted, but I
  think Lili was condemned."</p>

  <p>Tempted beyond complete prudence Belle asked:</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Frau Morl, quite what happened in London? I suppose a good
  deal of it would be kept from you."</p>

  <p>"A good deal," nodded the elder woman, "but I know the facts. My son was
  accused of murdering a woman of the streets. He was acquitted at the first
  enquiry, but Lili can't forget."</p>

  <p>"It was a horrible experience and, no doubt, a shock," said Belle coolly,
  "but if she wants to lead a life of self-sacrifice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Frau Mori looked up from above the needles, then down again without
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"I don't see," added Belle, still in the same high tone, "why everything
  was spoilt for her&mdash;why she had to get ill."</p>

  <p>"She has her ideas," nodded Frau Morl, "her very rigid ideas. She is a
  good girl&mdash;she thinks she has done something that displeases God, and
  perhaps," added the stout woman, putting her knitting in her lap and gazing
  directly at Belle, "perhaps she has done so, who knows?"</p>

  <p>"Will they be married now, or soon?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, I can't say. I should be very willing, but she has no
  energy even to make a decision. You see how ill she is, and she seems worse
  from day to day."</p>

  <p>Belle rose and went to the tall brilliantly-clean window; it was twilight,
  they were waiting for dinner.</p>

  <p>Everything in the house was so spotless and polished, so white and bare.
  This, which at first soothed, now annoyed Belle. There was a bleak quality in
  the last light of the long spring day; it was brilliancy without sunshine,
  there was no lustre or colour anywhere&mdash;the house all whiteness, with
  dark furniture&mdash;the plain clothes of Frau Morl and the drab liveries of
  the servants; the forest was so dark too, and the plumes of the pine-trees so
  dense; and even the few flowers that had appeared were pallid snowdrops and
  frail wind-flowers scattered in the clearings, or the pale spikes of white
  hyacinths pushing through the dead pine-needles. There was about house and
  landscape a northern air&mdash;a late cold spring, with cloudy days and
  chilly nights.</p>

  <p>"I ought to go," said Belle from the window where she stood; "I've no
  right to stay here any longer."</p>

  <p>"I was afraid you'd find it dull," replied the quiet voice of the woman
  seated by the stove. "You can stay or go as it pleases you, Fräulein Rastell,
  it really makes no difference to me."</p>

  <p>Belle glanced at her over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You've been very patient with me, Frau Morl; I don't mind telling you
  that you're quite a different woman from what I thought you would be."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I've had experiences other than you had imagined," smiled the
  other woman.</p>

  <p>"I dare say it would be impertinent for me to ask you about
  that&mdash;we've come together very strangely&mdash;nothing's worked out
  quite as I thought it would."</p>

  <p>"It never does," said Frau Mort "One can't plan for success or for
  happiness; they take you by surprise, like love."</p>

  <p>"Do you think love takes you by surprise and one can't plan for that
  either?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Frau Morl, "nor evade it when it comes. I don't want to know
  anything about you, Fräulein; I understand that you were kind to my son and
  to Lili in London, that you expressed a desire to come to Germany again; and
  I'm very pleased to give you this rather dull hospitality." As Belle did not
  answer she added: "It is all I have, but I know quite well that it is not
  what really satisfies a woman like you&mdash;for long."</p>

  <p>"What sort of woman do you think I am?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can guess. I told you that I was on the stage myself, and before I
  married, before my husband died, before a few strange things happened to me,
  I was quite different." She disclosed, as she folded up her knitting, that
  she was making a pair of small white stockings; she said deliberately: "But
  don't stay here for me. I dare say you must be tired of it now. Perhaps you
  have had the rest that you required&mdash;your own people, your own friends
  will, no doubt, want to see you again."</p>

  <p>Belle moved from the window.</p>

  <p>"What are you knitting?" she asked listlessly. "Do you wear white
  stockings like those?"</p>

  <p>Frau Morl smiled without replying to that question.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I ought to go&mdash;but I really don't know what to do. I have no
  relations, I am very much alone."</p>

  <p>"You have your friends, your work in London?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I am so tired."</p>

  <p>Belle felt an exasperated longing to throw off all pretences, to say:
  "Don't you know that I saw your son coming out of that murdered trollop's
  room and that I am here to blackmail him?" It was quite likely that this
  stolid woman knew everything and mocked her secretly; it was impossible that
  she should not show more curiosity if she were really ignorant of what her
  guest really was.</p>

  <p>"Tired?" repeated Frau Mort "Of what? Of your worthy labours among the
  outcast?"</p>

  <p>Belle thought this obvious irony and in revenge asked coolly:</p>

  <p>"It must have been very sad for you to lose your elder son, Frau Morl. Was
  it a sudden illness?"</p>

  <p>She had the satisfaction of seeing the thick hands quiver on the rolled-up
  white socks, but the strongly-modelled face did not change as Frau Morl
  replied:</p>

  <p>"You walk much in the woods. One day you will see my men putting up an
  obelisk on the spot where my son was killed. He was shot, by accident, quite
  a common sort of accident&mdash;he tripped over a tree-stump and his gun went
  off."</p>

  <p>"I thought," said Belle, "that there had been some such tragedy."</p>

  <p>"Did you? Why?"</p>

  <p>"Everyone is too discreet."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that is only because you are too curious." Frau Morl rose; there
  was a likeness to her son in her pale eyes, her locked expression. "But stay
  as long as you please, you will find out nothing that I do not wish you to
  discover."</p>

  <p>Belle responded at once to the challenge.</p>

  <p>"What has your son told you of me?"</p>

  <p>"I have no answer to that, Fräulein Rastell, nor to anything else that you
  are likely to ask. I thank my God I trust in Him. I believe that He will
  protect us against Evil."</p>

  <p>"Thank Him, indeed, if you believe that," said Belle bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I do. I do."</p>

  <p>The two women faced one another. Belle was swift in realising that her
  chief advantage lay in control, in waiting.</p>

  <p>"You have dropped one of your white stockings, Frau Morl."</p>

  <p>She stooped and with graceful courtesy handed the other woman the length
  of soft white woollen knitting which she had let fall by the stove. Frau Morl
  winced, for all her courage, and muttered:</p>

  <p>"I think the dinner will be ready. Shall we go?"</p>

  <p>Belle had a sense of victory&mdash;but over whom? And what should be the
  prize?</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Lili sent for Belle, begging her to see her in the room
with the
  white-tiled stove, where she passed most of her days; Belle thought of their
  last interview in the London hotel&mdash;what more was there to be said
  between them?</p>

  <p>Yet she was curious as to what the silly little creature could have to
  say&mdash;how tenacious she was! Why didn't she go away, return to her quiet
  life of parish doctor's daughter and housekeeper at Maartensdorf and leave
  these people, with whom she had really nothing to do, alone?</p>

  <p>Yet it was with a sense of pleasure that Belle entered the lofty room, for
  not only did she promise herself the gratification of her curiosity by
  questioning the candid Lili, but she intended to indulge her feeling of power
  over someone whom she despised and disliked. This interlude at Schloss Morl
  could not continue much longer, no matter what acrid satisfaction it held for
  her. She must soon decide what use she intended to make of the hold she had
  over Maarten Mott Perhaps this interview with Lili Schoppe would help that
  decision.</p>

  <p>When Belle, with her alert, graceful bearing, came round the screen that
  sheltered the girl from any possible draughts, she had a sudden impression
  that some very powerful presence was in the room, a spirit of vital energy
  and uncommon resolution. But she was alone with Lili, who sat in a low
  easy-chair, wrapped in a thick white shawl, her head, with the pale bands of
  smooth hair, resting on a cushion in a spotless linen cover.</p>

  <p>The sick girl was without colour, and, as Belle thought, without charm;
  her wasted hands rested over a small Bible, the companion, Belle noted, of
  that which she had picked up in Daisy Arrow's room.</p>

  <p>"Well, Fräulein Schoppe, you wished to see me?"</p>

  <p>Belle seated herself on the other side of the gleaming stove; the wretched
  appearance of the drooping girl filled her with satisfaction; she felt, in
  contrast, so strong, so full of vigour and purpose, so blooming and
  radiant&mdash;yes, she was beginning, with the return of health, of nervous
  poise, of self-respect, to feel too full of life for Schloss Mod.</p>

  <p>"Why are you here?" demanded Lili.</p>

  <p>"Hasn't Herr Morl told you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing but what I was told in London."</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps that is all there is to tell."</p>

  <p>"No. I feel that there is something else," said Lili earnestly. "It is
  very strange that you should be here."</p>

  <p>"Frau Morl accepts me as a matter of course."</p>

  <p>"She is afraid to question."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I thought so." Belle smoothed the folds of her grey skirt, and
  admired the charming contours of her fine hand, set off by the neat white
  cuff.</p>

  <p>"Frau Morl is a very brave woman. She has had great misfortunes."</p>

  <p>"I thought that, too. What were they?"</p>

  <p>Lili sighed.</p>

  <p>"I don't know much, everything that went on here was always kept very
  quiet. Besides, I ought not to tell you. It was never a happy life for Frau
  Morl&mdash;her husband was strange and violent, and there was that horrible
  accident to the elder son."</p>

  <p>"Accident?" queried Belle.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;what do you think it was?"</p>

  <p>Belle smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well, it doesn't matter, but when people are too discreet one begins to
  suspect&mdash;almost anything&mdash;besides, there is Herr Maarten to account
  for&mdash;I wonder if it would have helped him in London if his family
  history had been brought out."</p>

  <p>Lili's fingers tightened over the Bible.</p>

  <p>"He never did anything wrong&mdash;he was only wild and unsettled and
  given to fits of horrible melancholy. He joined the
  ministry&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To try to keep sane, perhaps?" Belle filled in the pause.</p>

  <p>"Sane?" echoed Lili. "You think there is madness in the family?" Hastily
  she answered herself: "And if there was madness is only a devil to be cast
  out. Since Maarten met me he has been quiet and happy, full of enthusiasm for
  his work, of joy in the future&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you then, Fräulein Schoppe, think that you have the power to cast out
  devils?" mocked Belle.</p>

  <p>Lili gazed at her steadily and leant forward so that the soft white shawl
  fell apart on her thin throat; the hollows above the collar-bone showed above
  her starched tucker.</p>

  <p>"'Seek Him that maketh the seven stars and Orion and turneth the shadow of
  death into morning&mdash;the Lord is His name.' By His help I&mdash;even
  I&mdash;Miss Rastell, could save this young man."</p>

  <p>"Could you, and from what?"</p>

  <p>"From himself&mdash;from you."</p>

  <p>"Ah, from me! Isn't that rather silly, theatrical talk, Fräulein
  Schoppe?"</p>

  <p>Lili closed her brilliant eyes; so frail, hollow and ill did she seem with
  her lids closed that it was almost like a face without life, but her low
  voice was full of intense energy.</p>

  <p>"'Thou exaltest thyself as the eagle, and though thou settest thy nest
  among the stars&mdash;I will bring thee down&mdash;the pride of thy heart
  hath deceived thee.' Do you never think of God, Miss Rastell?"</p>

  <p>"I am much impressed by your texts, Fräulein Schoppe&mdash;but I suppose
  that you have nothing better to do all day than to read the Bible."</p>

  <p>Lili opened her eyes, they glistened with tears.</p>

  <p>"Please leave us. This must be a dull life for you. Don't come between me
  and Maarten."</p>

  <p>"How could I&mdash;if you love each other?" Belle mocked. The personality
  of Lili exasperated her into cruelty. "You are very sentimental and
  fanatical, Fräulein Schoppe&mdash;please tell me why you wanted to see me.
  Has Herr Morl told you anything of me."</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Nor have I asked."</p>

  <p>"Well then, what do you suspect?" Belle leant forward. "Who do you think I
  am? Why, only Rose Rastell, a missionary worker, who did you a little service
  when you were in trouble and who is having a rest, a holiday here, peace and
  quiet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What was that service?" breathed Lili.</p>

  <p>"Ask Herr Morl."</p>

  <p>"He will not tell me. No, even though I swore a lie for him he will not be
  open with me."</p>

  <p>"But what do you want him to be open about? He was acquitted, was he not,
  and handsome compensation made for a hideous mistake? A case of mistaken
  identity. And even if you did swear to a false alibi, you have your father's
  word that Herr Mori was in the hotel during the whole of Christmas Eve."</p>

  <p>Lili put her hand over her eyes in silence, her narrow breast heaved under
  the pale cashmere bodice.</p>

  <p>"Besides," insisted Belle quietly, "how could a man like Herr Morl have
  even thought of going to a place like the Argyll Rooms and taking such a
  woman as Daisy Arrow for his companion?"</p>

  <p>"You torment me, Miss Rastell," muttered Lili. "And I am trying to be
  strong. The Lord tries me sorely&mdash;'evil shall come upon thee and thou
  shalt not know from whence&mdash;mischief shall fall on thee and desolation
  shall come upon thee suddenly'&mdash;that is my case. I move in the
  dark&mdash;but I will not be overwhelmed."</p>

  <p>She dropped her hand from her eyes and clasped it over the Bible on her
  lap, spots of red showed on her cheek-bones; she stared at Belle with the
  desperate energy of one endeavouring to resist an enchantment.</p>

  <p>"Leave us, Miss Rastell. I implore you, I warn you. Whoever you are,
  whatever you know, go away&mdash;leave us."</p>

  <p>"Why should you dislike&mdash;fear me so much?" challenged</p>

  <p>Belle, half amused, half stung.</p>

  <p>Lili touched her heart.</p>

  <p>"Something here&mdash;tells me. Frau Morl feels it too&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Has her son told her anything?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Belle rose, flicked into movement by impatience.</p>

  <p>"Well then&mdash;neither of you know anything&mdash;why don't you leave me
  alone? I don't intrigue with women, my business is with Herr Morl."</p>

  <p>Lili sat with bent head, as if bowed beneath an invisible burden.</p>

  <p>"What is&mdash;your&mdash;business?"</p>

  <p>"That is between him and me."</p>

  <p>"You think that&mdash;you&mdash;can make&mdash;your profit out of it?"</p>

  <p>Lili raised her Bible to her breast&mdash;a gesture that exasperated
  Belle.</p>

  <p>"I also have a Bible&mdash;a little German Bible like that, Fräulein
  Schoppe."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what do you want?"</p>

  <p>Lili rose; her white shawl fell to the ground, revealing her lean stooping
  figure.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to do with you. Nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"Do you want Maarten?"</p>

  <p>Belle was startled through all her defences; the question was one that in
  the depth of her heart she had put to herself.</p>

  <p>"He is mine," whispered Lili.. "If you try to take him you will destroy
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"You really talk very foolishly, Fräulein Schoppe."</p>

  <p>Frau Mori came round the screen, she had a bottle, a glass, and some flat
  biscuits on a tray.</p>

  <p>"Come, Lili, here is your medicine. You have talked long enough. Miss
  Rastell must please excuse you."</p>

  <p>Belle read loathing in the pale eyes of the stout woman and her rage
  against both of them flared.</p>

  <p>"This is stupid behaviour on the part of both of you&mdash;I am more
  important than perhaps you think."</p>

  <p>Lili gazed at Frau Morl.</p>

  <p>"She is important, you hear, mother? What is her importance? 'She gathered
  it of the hire of a harlot, and to the hire of a harlot she shall
  return.'"</p>

  <p>Belle stood rigid. Frau Mori said sharply:</p>

  <p>"Please leave us."</p>

  <p>Belle opened her mouth, but did not speak; she turned away, holding her
  full neat skirts off her feet. She hated both of them. "I suppose she was
  listening, that old woman&mdash;that silly girl with her imbecile look of a
  plaster angel&mdash;'harlot'&mdash;that was a shot in the dark, but
  I&mdash;never mind, what do I want? The man, as she said?"</p>

  <p>Belle had gained her own room, and stood brooding in the midst of the
  clean-swept floor, enveloped by the shadows of the trees that pressed against
  the tall windows. She smiled, shrugged her pretty shoulders. After all those
  two women did not matter, she could afford to despise: them. They knew
  nothing&mdash;he had not dared to tell them anything. Lili was a fool, crazy
  with ideas of self-sacrifice, of duty, of divine guidance, infatuated with a
  wild, melancholy young man born&gt; her superior&mdash;nothing more.</p>

  <p>"If she frets like this she will soon be dead, and who will miss her? But
  for me? What do I want? An academy for young ladies&mdash;a post with a
  German lady&mdash;a continuance of this?"</p>

  <p>She laughed out loud into the interlacing shadows, so thick, so restless
  about her erect figure. She was no longer fatigued, she was well fed, she was
  restored to self-confidence, her energy and her pride had revived after the
  shocks and humiliations of her downfall, she was young and
  desirable--spring-tide began to stir in the forest air. "'To the hire of a
  harlot,'" she repeated to herself with dark irony. "Is it likely I can live
  long like this? Would not that be a proper end to the adventure&mdash;to go
  away from, this sanctuary and take him with me?"</p>

  <p>She went restlessly to the window and pressed her face to the shining
  pane; the dark plumes of the pines almost brushed her cheek&mdash;would have
  brushed it but for the clear glass.</p>

  <p>The strange young man attracted her; he suited the scene, her mood, her
  jaded appetite, her desire for a powerful passion, a wilful emotion; she
  smiled to herself, secure in her own pride, courage and power, she forgot
  Daisy Arrow.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That night she could not sleep. There was a great wind
without, and the
  chains of the old lime-tree shook and rattled as if manacled men danced under
  the scudding clouds. Belle tossed in the wide bed under the white coverlets;
  a shaft of moonlight penetrated the thick hurrying vapours and showed a black
  bough outlined beyond the window. The sleepless, restless woman thought of
  that other dark bough which had, on Christmas Eve, been fixed under the
  picture of <i>The Last Judgment</i> that hung above the piano in Mrs. Bulke's
  kitchen.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Herr Mori made an occasion to seek out his guest: he had
been nearly two
  weeks in the house and only spoken to her in the presence of others at
  meal-times, or hurriedly as they passed on the stairs or in the corridors.
  Now he sought her out where she stood musing, the day after the great wind
  under the old shackled lime-tree that was supported and plated by iron, and
  gave as yet no sign of bud.</p>

  <p>He asked her immediately if she could come with him to the island on the
  lake?</p>

  <p>"A lake and an island? I did not know of them."</p>

  <p>"You have hardly left the house, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I have taken walks with the dogs, but always upwards through the
  woods; and once I went to your mother's little garden, but it was too early
  the Year, there was nothing in it."</p>

  <p>"The lake is not far," said the young man, "we can easily walk to it. I
  shall be glad of exercise, have been closed in the house so long."</p>

  <p>"Yes, with Lili."</p>

  <p>She picked up her gloves, which she had flung over a withered branch of
  the ancient tree.</p>

  <p>"How is she to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Worse&mdash;that is how it is that I am free. She is in bed and will see
  no one. The doctor is staying with her, and her father is coming
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Why did he ever let her out of his sight?" asked Belle listlessly. "I
  thought they were so devoted to one another."</p>

  <p>"For that reason he let her go. He thought that his distress was affecting
  her. Now she is past those considerations."</p>

  <p>They began to descend through the pine-woods.</p>

  <p>"How cloudy it is," complained Belle, "day after day, and never any sun,
  and in these woods, not much light." Then she became suddenly weary of
  subterfuge, and demanded: "What is it you want from me? To ask. I suppose,
  why I have stayed so long, when I am going, and where? Well, Herr Morl, I
  suppose there is no one to overhear us here?"</p>

  <p>"No one," he said, "to see us or to hear us."</p>

  <p>His manner was placid. She disliked his great self-control. She would
  rather have seen him more moved. She was tired of the problem which he
  presented, weary of endeavouring to probe his sincerity.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was only a bargain," she said harshly, "that you were to bring
  me here, and to give me this chance, and I was to give you back the book and
  the letters. But you haven't asked for them."</p>

  <p>"I had almost forgotten them. There have been times lately when they have
  quite gone out of my mind."</p>

  <p>"Were you so absorbed in Lili?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted, "but you would never be able to understand what it
  means&mdash;something mere," he said, as if answering a question in his own
  heart, "than love."</p>

  <p>Belle paused&mdash;they had come to an opening in the woods and there was
  a scatter of frail white flowers, delicate feathery leaves at their feet.</p>

  <p>"I understand you&mdash;I read you more clearly than you think," she said.
  "Do you believe that girl's untried virtue, her narrow piety, her conception
  of God and goodness, is strong enough to save your soul?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer. He was staring at the moist ground, grinding the
  fragile flowers into the earth with his feet.</p>

  <p>"I had thought," said Belle, "better of you than that&mdash;you, the man
  you are, or affect to be, hoping to save yourself by clutching at the skirts
  of a plaster saint, a mawkish school-girl."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you call it superstition," replied the young man, seemingly not
  in the least offended by these sneers, "but she does represent something to
  me, and so does the work we meant to do together, and so does her
  faith&mdash;our faith, No doubt to you it seems very paltry and childish, but
  to me&mdash;no."</p>

  <p>She looked at him furtively, doubtful as to whether he mocked her or not.
  It was impossible for her to gauge the extent of his sincerity.</p>

  <p>Again she had an impatient feeling of being weary and baffled. She could
  hardly persuade herself that this was the same man who had stood in the dock
  at Bow Street, who had walked beside her on the greasy London pavement, the
  fog in their faces, who had knelt beside her in the grim London church. It
  was not so long ago either. She had had a bunch of forced snowdrops on the
  yellow shining varnish of the pew, and there were snowdrops out now in the
  woods. He was differently dressed, but there was no alteration in his smooth
  handsome face, the long features and the slanting light eyes. Yet, how
  different he seemed.</p>

  <p>He stood there, continuing to grind the flowers into the earth, moving
  from one frail plant to another.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think," he said harshly, "that it is clever not to believe
  in angels, but if you'd ever been haunted (yes, it isn't a lie about the
  furies) or desperately unhappy, or horribly tormented, you'd snatch at
  anything that gave you relief."</p>

  <p>"Would you," said Belle contemptuously, "even at Lili Schoppe?"</p>

  <p>He began to move away violently through the woods&mdash;she had difficulty
  in keeping pace with him.</p>

  <p>"She's dying for me," he said, "dying because of the whole foul business."
  He used the words that his mother employed: "They acquitted me, but they
  condemned her."</p>

  <p>"Why did she take it so to heart?"</p>

  <p>"She's very sensitive and very quick&mdash;she didn't understand all, but
  she understood enough, and she mistrusts you&mdash;she can't understand why
  you are here, she doesn't believe me when I tell her it
  is&mdash;nothing."</p>

  <p>"Blame yourself more than me for your Lili's distresses," replied Belle
  lightly. "I knew from the first moment that I saw her at Bow Street police
  court that she was struck to the heart&mdash;not because of me, Herr Mori,
  but because she had to stand up there and swear a lie to save
  you&mdash;<i>that</i> shattered her world&mdash;<i>that</i> brought her
  down."</p>

  <p>He did not reply to this, but at a tangent asked:</p>

  <p>"What do you think of my home, my mother?"</p>

  <p>"She is not the kind of woman I thought she would be."</p>

  <p>"No, I know what you were imagining. If she had been like that, I should
  not at any cost have brought you here. My mother has had her
  experiences&mdash;probably she can read you quite well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I dare say," replied Belle, "but I don't suppose she knows why I'm
  here."</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't question that. She leaves everything in the hands of God.
  She, too, is very devout."</p>

  <p>"Are we going towards your island?" asked Belle. "We seem to be walking at
  random."</p>

  <p>"Did you see a little boy?" he asked. "He would be about seven years
  old."</p>

  <p>"The woodman's child? No, why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer.</p>

  <p>They had come to a clearing where the stumps of trees, fringed by spring
  flowers, broke the spread of last year's leaves. In the centre of this was a
  small obelisk of grey stone. Belle approached it and read the new-cut
  inscription. A name, Heinrich Morl&mdash;a date, a day in August a few years
  ago.</p>

  <p>"Your brother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, here he died and 'all Sodom and Gomorrah mourned for him.'"</p>

  <p>"An accident?"</p>

  <p>"Is death ever an accident?"</p>

  <p>"I think, Herr Morl, you have not a very agreeable family history. Shall
  we go on?"</p>

  <p>She thought: "He is at odds with himself like I am, searching,
  lonely&mdash;we ought to suit each other very well."</p>

  <p>They passed on, side by side, through the sloping woods; everywhere were
  flowers, anemones, snowdrops, bluebells, lilies-of-the-valley; the air was
  soft and sweet, the birds chattering. They reached the garden in the woods
  laid out by the whim of some Rimer owner of Schloss Mod.</p>

  <p>Belle looked tenderly at her companion; she wanted to comfort him, to
  gladden him, to take him away to gaiety and ease. How much more important he
  was than those two virtuous women! Surely he was attracted to her as she was
  to him; she must make him understand that he had nothing to fear from her,
  also that he must leave that moping Lili.</p>

  <p>He had come to a pause and taken off his hat; the wind stirred his thick
  hair on his brow.</p>

  <p>"Here is your mother's garden. Let us go through it and see if there are
  any flowers yet."</p>

  <p>They entered the light iron gate which gave admission to a square of
  cultivated ground surrounded by a low stone wall. It was like a large terrace
  levelled straight on the final slope of the hill. On these lower levels there
  were no pines but groves of birch, elm and oak frees&mdash;all now faintly
  bloomed with buds, so that they were veiled by a shimmer of pale pink and
  silver grey. There were no trees in the garden which was laid out in the
  formal Italian fashion, most incongruous to the landscape. There were stone
  walks bordered by clipped wych-elms, a stone fountain, a small pavilion or
  summerhouse. A few pale flowers had broken through the soil; clumps of
  narcissus, white stars among the green spikes, clusters of primroses low on
  the earth strewn with dead leaves like knots fallen from a lady's dress.</p>

  <p>"Frau Mod said there were some moss roses here. That's a curious
  coincidence&mdash;they're such old-fashioned flowers at home."</p>

  <p>She moved along the damp stone-flagged path, round the fountain in which
  there was no water, along the beds, bare but for those few rare clusters of
  early flowers&mdash;with restless discontent. It was, save for the situation
  so far from the house, an ordinary garden laid out with a. dull conventional
  taste, as ordinary as the house. "Yes," she assured herself, "that, too, was
  dull and conventional. Why did she dislike them both so much, the garden as
  well as the house?"</p>

  <p>"Let us go on," she said, "to your lake and island."</p>

  <p>The young clergyman had sunk on to the stone bench that, was partly
  darkened by a pollarded clump of wych-elm, whose stunted boughs were covered
  with new leaves. His heavy overcoat concealed his figure, his hands were
  clasped before him, his head bent forward.</p>

  <p>"A strange, moody creature. I really am behaving rather recklessly. I.
  don't know quite whom I'm dealing with, but I like him, he excites me."</p>

  <p>She stared at him as she walked up and down. He seemed to have forgotten
  she was there. Twice she reminded him of the lake and the island&mdash;but he
  took no heed.</p>

  <p>"I'd' better perhaps take what money I can get and go. This is played
  out&mdash;there is nothing more I can do;" and even as she forced herself to
  form this thought, she knew that she and this man were hopelessly involved,
  whether she would or no.</p>

  <p>In a corner near the summer-house she found the moss rose-tree. She knew
  it by the peculiar shape of the tiny leaves, which, encouraged by its
  sheltered position, it had put forth in tiny scrolls.</p>

  <p>The memories it brought up were all unpleasant&mdash;the melody of the
  lilting, sugary waltz rang in her ears, disturbing the outer silence. She saw
  herself seated at the cracked piano in Mrs. Bulke's kitchen and playing that
  silly tune, and staring up at the black picture of <i>The Last Judgment</i>
  with the riven rocks and the thunder-clouds, and the blank, stupid angels
  descending to deliver the punishment He had said "No doubt you consider it
  clever not to believe in angels;" that meant that he did believe. Well, his
  Lili had much that same look&mdash;silly, placid&mdash;frightened to death at
  the mere thought of evil.</p>

  <p>Evil! Her mind stopped at the word; she looked at the summer-house with a
  sudden sense of apprehension. It was in the shape of a cupola supported on
  ugly mock classic pillars of dingy stone. She could see clearly into
  it&mdash;no mystery nor secrets there, yet the place, the moss
  rose-tree&mdash;indeed, the whole garden was becoming hateful.</p>

  <p>She walked swiftly to the stone bench where Pastor Mod still sat, and
  flung herself down beside him. She said rapidly, leaning towards him and
  almost whispering in his ear, as if they were in the midst of a crowd instead
  of a solitude:</p>

  <p>"It has all.. to pieces and come to, an end. I shall go away again. You
  will never hear of me any more. See, you can have your book and your
  letter."</p>

  <p>He did not seem greatly relieved by her reassurances given so suddenly and
  so nervously, but looked up peering at her over the high collar of his coat
  so that she only saw his eyes. This had happened before, she remembered, and
  that moment and this became mingled in her alarmed mind.</p>

  <p>"What letter is it that you have got?"</p>

  <p>"A little love-letter in German that you wrote to a girl who couldn't
  understand German, but I suppose she was pleased to get it just the
  same."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, on a short sigh, "she was pleased to get it, and I was
  pleased to write it. She was a worthless little slut, but I didn't know that
  then, I was too young."</p>

  <p>"What does it matter?&mdash;you can have the letter again."</p>

  <p>"It is too late," he muttered. "I don't care much whether I get it back or
  not. Let us get out of this garden."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I want to go, too; it seems as if there were a spell here and one
  couldn't move."</p>

  <p>They walked slowly down the damp flagged path.</p>

  <p>"It is a dismal little place," said Belle, walking beside him, "although
  it is so well kept. There should be more flowers here and the moss scraped
  off the fountain basin and the paths. Yes, when I look at it again it's not
  so well-kept, but quite neglected."</p>

  <p>She was glad when they were out of the garden and had closed the iron
  gates behind them; clouds were obscuring the sun. It was very lonely in the
  forest.</p>

  <p>Belle stared at her companion, trying to focus his personality and to
  clarify her conception of him; she could not do so, his spirit seemed always
  slightly blurred, indistinct, shifting, although in appearance he was,
  definite enough, a well-built comely young man with a face of more than
  ordinary good looks; yet whenever she stared at him or thought of him there
  was this impression of something chaotic, indistinct.</p>

  <p>She found herself trying to reassure and comfort him. She told him again
  and again that she was not a common blackmailer. She repeated&mdash;though it
  was difficult to bring out the words, which came in broken
  whispers&mdash;that she believed in the suicide of Daisy Arrow.</p>

  <p>He did not reply to any of these assertions which, as his silence
  continued, grew more and more passionate.</p>

  <p>They came&mdash;suddenly, as it seemed to her, for she had been so
  absorbed in him that she had not noticed their surroundings&mdash;on the
  lake, a boat-house just before them with two boats moored to the staples. It
  was not a large lake you could easily see the other shore, with a crescent
  shaped pine-wood rising stiffly into the colourless sky, the dim outline of
  the veiled mountains beyond. In the middle of the smooth sheet of water that
  was like silver dimmed by breath, bright and yet not shining, was a small
  island, no more than a few tussets of grass, some low thorn-bushes, and three
  slender fir-trees.</p>

  <p>"Let us row out to that," he said, suddenly breaking his silence. "There
  we can talk quite undisturbed."</p>

  <p>"It's undisturbed and solitary enough here&mdash;it was in the garden,"
  said Belle. "Do you really want to go out there? The daylight is waning, and
  won't Lili and your mother be asking for you?"</p>

  <p>"An hour or two will make no difference," he said as he loosened the boat
  and motioned her to step in.</p>

  <p>She obeyed.</p>

  <p>He rowed her out to the island. She noted with idle pleasure the pattern
  the boat made on the still surface of the lake. She heard with idle pleasure
  the splash of the oars as he moved them leisurely up and down. How the water
  dripped from the wet blades, how odd that she should notice these and other
  details&mdash;the shape of the boat, of his hands, the cracked paint and
  rusty metal of the rowlocks.</p>

  <p>He had flung off his coat and his hat. He seemed to be, as she was
  herself, soothed by the scene, by the movement of the boat, by the action of
  rowing, by the sense of space given by the expanse of water.</p>

  <p>He landed on the island and moored the boat to one of the old
  thorn-trees.</p>

  <p>She found then that what he had said was quite true. They seemed more
  utterly alone among the tussocks underneath the three trees with the water
  all about them than they could possibly have been even in the woods.</p>

  <p>He took his overcoat out of the boat and flung it down and told her to sit
  on it. She obeyed, drawing her shawl closely around her shoulders. She did
  not suppose that they would see much more of each other after to-day. The
  fantastic, sordid, incredible adventure which she had forced on him, and in a
  manner on herself in a moment's desperation was surely over, despite her wish
  to prolong it. The Bible, the letter, the stained plume of feathers seemed to
  her of no importance, if she had had them there she would have thrown them
  into the lake, yes, picked up one of the smooth stones that were lying there
  under the fir-trees, tied them all together with her handkerchief and cast
  them to the bottom of the lake. Of what importance were they, after all? She
  would go away, and at once, whether or no he would give her any money. She
  felt, and for the first time in her life, the need to confess. She had always
  sneered before at the thought of such a necessity. How could bringing the
  past across one's lips in a string of words be in any sense a purging or an
  expiation? So it had always seemed to her, but now she flung herself down on
  the overcoat, propping her face in her hands, ruffling her smooth
  bay-leaf-coloured hair with her fingers. She began to talk about herself, her
  childhood and the days when she had been like Lili.</p>

  <p>He stared down at her seated on the pale overcoat which faintly smelt of
  turpentine; he was picking up and throwing down little handfuls of grass.</p>

  <p>"None of this if of any interest to me," he said in a kindly, smooth
  fashion.</p>

  <p>She continued to speak just as if a spell was on her. A little wind came
  up. She paused in her hurried thoughts to wonder where the winds came from.
  Suddenly they were there, ruffling the surface of the lake, the curling, fine
  hair on her brow, lifting the heavy locks shaded his brow.</p>

  <p>She did not look at him as she spoke, but, through the network made by the
  twisted boughs of the thorn-bush, at the pale water.</p>

  <p>What was she saying? She was trying to talk of herself as a child:</p>

  <p>She was well educated in a good school, but without father or mother. Oh
  yes, they were living, but it was not convenient for either of them to own
  her. She was misbegotten&mdash;she repeated that awkward word with emphasis,
  it was so true&mdash;a foundling; she did not quite know now who had paid for
  her; she had been sent to Germany&mdash;"out of the way, as I suppose;" she
  had been sent to Paris&mdash;secretly sent here and there. She had been well
  treated to a certain point because she had been well paid for; soon, she had
  guessed, she who had always been shrewd, the true state of affairs. She had
  always been difficult, full of rebellion and fury and bitterness&mdash;very
  proud, worse than proud&mdash;vain.</p>

  <p>She heard his voice interrupting:</p>

  <p>"What does any of this matter?"</p>

  <p>Yet she believed he was listening with interest.</p>

  <p>There had been trouble and scandal during her schooldays; she had only
  just averted open disaster. She had married the first man who had come along,
  the brother of a school friend, an officer who had taken her to India.
  <i>Married</i> and <i>husband</i>, how curious the words sounded in
  connection with herself&mdash;it was long since she had taken them on her
  lips. It had soon come to an end. After two years she had been divorced with
  ignominy. But in the world to which her mother belonged she had enjoyed
  herself. She had found a man who had spent money on her. She had thrown
  herself avidly into bought pleasures; she had believed herself loved and
  loving.</p>

  <p>She sat up, pulling her shawl about her, and stared at the thorn-tree.</p>

  <p>"When do the leaves begin to break out?" she asked. "It is quite late in
  the spring, after all, yet nowhere can I see any leaves on the
  thorn-tree."</p>

  <p>"Everything is delayed this year," replied the young man, "summer will be
  here before the spring has come. Are you getting cold? Shall we go home?"</p>

  <p>"Home!" repeated Belle, "that's a strange word, isn't it? What was I
  saying?"</p>

  <p>"There is no need to say any more."</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not. It's quite a commonplace story&mdash;I ran through it
  all rather quickly&mdash;I quarrelled and people grew tired. They found me
  out before I thought they would. I must have been, I suppose, just a fool. My
  confession has fallen flat since you have taken no notice of it at all. I
  suppose," she said, "you didn't bring me here for me to talk about
  myself?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you would, but you never were any mystery to me."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about yourself."</p>

  <p>"What do you want to know about me? It's just an ordinary tale like yours.
  I was too ambitious and too much my own master&mdash;yet, that's not
  it&mdash;we're an old family, not great nobility, you understand&mdash;we
  used to be the stewards of the lords who had the great castle, but they're
  extinct now. We were gentlefolk, and I was galled about my mother&mdash;and
  that's not it&mdash;I've never told you about my father and my elder brother,
  have I? Well, they don't concern it either. I suppose"&mdash;he gave her a
  direct yet quiet glance&mdash;"you're curious to know how I was involved
  with&mdash;never mind the name."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to know," said Belle, shivering, the wind bad become keener.
  "It's so strange how we've come together."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's very strange," he agreed. Then completely, as she thought, at a
  tangent he added: "Since I've been in the Church, about seven years now,
  strange things have come my way&mdash;most poignant stories&mdash;I'll tell
  you one, if you like, perhaps you can make something of it. I met the man two
  years ago. He was an ordinary person, he had led what you call a wild life at
  his university. He had enough money and no great talent. He had some sort of
  small position at one of our little courts. He told me what his pleasures
  were and how he spent his idle time, and something of his family history. I
  won't repeat any of that, it's not good hearing."</p>

  <p>"What's this to do with me?" sighed Belle, fascinated, not by what the
  young man said&mdash;she gave little heed to that&mdash; but by his voice and
  his gestures and the impelling look he turned on her and the way the wind was
  lifting the dark hair from his shapely head. "Don't you want to get back to
  Lili?" she said, with effort, as if trying to shake off an enchantment.
  "Never mind Lili now. I am telling you of this young man. The worst part of
  his story began when he met a woman, a foreigner, in Augsburg. I suppose she
  was the most commonplace sort of person, but in her he seemed to see
  something he had dreamt of and was looking for. He became most infatuated
  with her, and if she hadn't been quite so easy, I believe he'd have married
  her. She never thought of that, you see, she accepted him as her lover so
  soon that he never had need to bother about the marriage. They were happy
  while it lasted&mdash;yes, he assured me of that, odd as it may sound."</p>

  <p>"Why should it sound odd?" asked Belle, with her shawl close around her
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Because she was only an adventuress, as you call them, and he associated
  her with evil, you see."</p>

  <p>"The poor wretch&mdash;I mean the girl. Why should he associate her with
  evil?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, I couldn't say, but he did. He always had two forces
  striving in his nature&mdash;I suppose most of us have. Things had happened
  to him when he was a boy that troubled him very much, and this girl in some
  way reminded him of them. He thought of her as evil and as moving him to
  evil. And so," added the young man, with sudden emphasis, "she did."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Belle listlessly, "yes, but what has this story to do with you
  or me?"</p>

  <p>Taking no heed of her comment, he continued earnestly:</p>

  <p>"I won't trouble you with the details. There was crime between them as
  well as sin. He asked her to conceal it, just out of fear. He hadn't very
  much money&mdash;he had overdrawn his allowance again and again,
  mortgaged,all he had and got into debt, too. She began to get tired of him
  when she saw him in difficulties, and, of course, when she got tired, he
  realised how little she had ever cared."</p>

  <p>"The usual story&mdash;we-waste time thinking about it. What do you
  mean&mdash;there was a crime between them?"</p>

  <p>"Do you call it a crime to murder a new-born infant?" asked the young
  clergyman in a hushed tone. "I suppose it has an immortal soul that might lie
  in wait for you&mdash;might it not?"</p>

  <p>"Is that what they did?" asked Belle, drawing back her upper lip. "I've
  heard of such things, they've come my way, too, One doesn't think much about
  it, as I suppose."</p>

  <p>"No, but he had to think. You see, there was the body to get rid
  of&mdash;that's always a difficulty&mdash;the body of a full-grown male
  child, I suppose that would be deemed a crime to stifle that, to strangle it?
  Well, I don't know, but this young man thought so."</p>

  <p>"It was stupid," said Belle steadily; "there would have been so many other
  ways out of it."</p>

  <p>"Would there? But you don't know the circumstances, do you?-I have
  forgotten them, too. He was pressed for money, trying to keep up
  appearances&mdash;and so, in a way was she&mdash;she used to dance at the
  little theatre of a beer garden. She was very angry that she had to give up
  this work. He did what he could, found her lodging&mdash;hidden away."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to hear all this," said Belle restlessly. "It: won't make an
  difference to anything&mdash;the twilight is coming&mdash;how dark the
  pine-woods look&mdash;you would no longer think it was spring."</p>

  <p>The young man looked round the island, the thorn-trees, the lake, the
  sombre landscape beyond.</p>

  <p>"I never thought I should come back here," he murmured. "I thought that I
  should escape&mdash;I longed for South America, where everything is so
  different&mdash;where all is warm, luscious&mdash;yes, that was why I wanted
  to get away&mdash;to serve God, and to escape."</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me any more."</p>

  <p>"I can't forget that story. She sent for him and gave him the child. That
  was the last time he saw her. She said it had died&mdash;but he knew
  differently, he knew what they had agreed upon&mdash;well, he travelled out
  by train to a lonely place and buried it."</p>

  <p>"Well, there was nothing much in that," sighed Belle. "How did he get rid
  of the woman?"</p>

  <p>"She went back to the beer garden and there she met someone else who took
  her away." Herr Morl looked keenly at Belle. "Doesn't this story seem to you
  horrible?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, of course. But there is so much that is horrible&mdash;one gets
  used to it. Can't we shake off these things? Can't we find a little pleasure,
  a little satisfaction somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"Not if we are wicked," he replied, with a childish gravity that caused
  her to break into unsteady laughter. "Don't laugh. It's true. If one has done
  foul things&mdash;if one is mad and dark within&mdash;if one has one's moods
  when&mdash;never mind." He moved near to her. "Lili asked you to go. You
  torment her, you torment my mother. Lili can't endure to be in the same house
  with you."</p>

  <p>"What nonsense. Why did she come to Schloss Morl when she knew I was
  there?"</p>

  <p>"She thought it her duty for face you, to plead with you. Understand that
  though she knows nothing she guesses&mdash;she will always stand by me."</p>

  <p>"Will she?" asked Belle impatiently. "I detest her&mdash;I prefer your
  drab of the beer gardens. This talk of God and salvation! What arrogance! She
  is a narrow egoist. She has never been tempted&mdash;save by this scheme of a
  marriage to you, and she didn't resist that."</p>

  <p>"Will you go?" he insisted, ignoring her anger. "You can have the money,
  all that English money."</p>

  <p>Belle, shivering in the chill half-light, thought: "It is my interest to
  accept." But a passion of pride, of curiosity, an intense interest in her
  companion, a desire to defeat two women whom she disliked, urged her to
  refuse. Even the sense of his keen expectancy as he waited for an answer
  goaded her to refuse.</p>

  <p>She considered what life would be without this exciting sense of power,
  this hold over, another human being&mdash;what life would be without this odd
  intimacy with a man who began to stir her senses and hold her fancy in a way
  that had not, for long, happened to her&mdash;what, what money would
  compensate?</p>

  <p>"I don't choose to go yet."</p>

  <p>To her surprise he did not plead or menace, but quickly, with a sigh,
  accepted her decision.</p>

  <p>"Very well, things must work themselves out."</p>

  <p>He rose, a dark figure on the dark island against the pale water and the
  pale sky.</p>

  <p>"Did I finish that story?" he asked, looking down at her. "It was a day
  something ,like this when he came into the woods carrying what seemed an
  ordinary valise. He thought that he did It quite reverently. He planted a
  little tree to mark the spot; he was much shaken and could never forget."</p>

  <p>The young man stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Well,that's all I have to say."</p>

  <p>"You need not have told me," said Belle. "I've heard too many stories like
  that before. Is this you way of making your confession?</p>

  <p>"No, it' has nothing whatever to do with me. Why should it?"</p>

  <p>Moving away from the thorn-trees he pulled the boat up on the
  foreshore.</p>

  <p>"What are you thinking of?" he demanded, looking back at Belle, who
  remained prone on the light overcoat, her face propped in her hand, her hair
  falling down, her whole figure blurred in the thickening light.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking that some such story as that would 'account for you and
  Daisy Arrow. I was imagining what you or any man must have felt meeting her
  by chance that night in the Argyll Radius. Why did you go there? But one can
  understand that, too; you always had it in your blood to fancy places like.
  that. And she would see you there&mdash;see that you had become prosperous,
  and try to blackmail you, I suppose. You went home with her to keep her
  quiet, and then you couldn't do that and you didn't want to be exposed and to
  lose Lili and all your good reputation, and so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That might have happened to some other man," he said, "but it never
  happened to me."</p>

  <p>Again the sensation of being tired and baffled overwhelmed Belle to the
  exclusion of all other emotions. She rose and watched him shake out his
  overcoat and put it on. It would be chilly crossing the lake. She got, into
  the boat beside him and they, rowed, back to the shore.</p>

  <p>Did she believe him or not? What was the clue to his behaviour? It really
  did not matter. She was quite sure that they would soon be leaving each
  other. More to herself than to him she said as they landed and he fastened
  the boat again to the staple outside the boat-house:</p>

  <p>"I wish I could, go away, but I can't"</p>

  <p>There was ecstasy in the complete loneliness about them.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why you won't go," he muttered, putting his hand to his
  forehead, where the wind-blown hair lay tangled.</p>

  <p>They spoke no more, but walked up side by side through the pine-woods,
  where the night thickened about them. They avoided the garden, the dry
  fountain and the empty summerhouse.</p>

  <p>She asked herself&mdash;what possible matter their past experience could
  be to either of them? What could it concern them if they had come out of
  darkness to meet one another? Yet she could see no future for
  them&mdash;none. That did not matter, either; they were both vague,
  transient, incoherent creatures of base instincts and brutal passions; she
  judged herself as no better than he was; even if he had, cornered and
  desperate, struck down Daisy Arrow, she had been able, without pity, to turn
  that to her own advantage. She had not been sorry for a stupid trull who had
  tried clumsy blackmail. If there were some little bones rotting in the wood
  somewhere, she was not sorry for that, either; Daisy had been punished for
  that, all was over. Then, perhaps none of it was true; he was wild,
  fantastic, unbalanced, perhaps he had told her a silly tale, perhaps Daisy,
  drunk, exhausted, remorseful, had cut her own throat.</p>

  <p>What did it matter? She, the nameless woman, who had had so many names,
  was alive and out of her life began to bloom again passion, desire, a
  yearning for the lusts of the flesh. Not for her the cold-blooded
  blackmailing she had proposed herself in her grim misery in London. She was
  lovely again, well-fed, sleek; Lili's words sounded like an undertone to the
  noises of the night&mdash;"the hire of a harlot." Yes, she returned to that,
  she began to ply her trade in the old, dark, beautiful forest. Lili, who had
  seemed to know nothing, had known that; she had had that
  word&mdash;harlotry&mdash;very ready on her tongue.</p>

  <p>"Oh, stop, the path is so steep, I am out of breath," she panted, pulling
  at his sleeve.</p>

  <p>He stood still beside her under the black boughs of the pines that were
  drowned by the heavy twilight, and so moved darkness within darkness.</p>

  <p>"What have you been thinking of since we left the lake? You have said
  nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"What should I say to you?"</p>

  <p>"What, indeed? You know that my threats were all nonsense&mdash;I couldn't
  go on with it. Oh, don't think of it again."</p>

  <p>"What, then, shall I think of? I've met women of your sort before," he
  sighed; he was standing very close to her. "One is never free. Now, I'm only
  considering Lili."</p>

  <p>Belle laughed; through the dark came the faint perfume of the white
  flowers, anemones, tiny lilies, snowdrops, ineffable, chill, pure.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you love me?" She took his hand and pressed it to her cheek.
  "Couldn't we go away together? We don't belong to these people, you and
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Love you? That would be one way."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the best&mdash;let us forget everything else, all the scheming, the
  trouble. You said once that I was beautiful."</p>

  <p>"So you are. I thought so even when I first saw you," he muttered; though
  she could not see him clearly, she thought that he strained away from her,
  and she held him closer, tightly, with both hands.</p>

  <p>"Then I was ill, miserable, in rags; now I am changed&mdash;Oh, kiss me,
  what does anything else matter?"</p>

  <p>He put his arms about her, then traced his fingers over her soft cheek and
  neck and kissed the words silent on her lips; he laughed gently.</p>

  <p>"Let us go up to the house."</p>

  <p>She obeyed; they walked languidly along the forest path, so well known to
  him, which he had hoped never to see again. A fine rain fell, intangible as a
  noonday phantom was the sense and the scent of the unseen, frail, white
  flowers.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When they reached the house it was dark, the white front
showed dimly
  through the dim twilight. They paused under the ancient lime-tree; the chains
  were rattling in the rising wind. Holding each others hands they looked up at
  the light in Lili's room, the only light in the blank, shuttered facade. As
  they stared a figure came, a dark outline, and drew to the shutters of the
  sick-chamber, hiding the lamp-rays and closing them outside. The wind with
  invisible menace bowed the pine-tree tops into waves of sound; the fine rain
  was dashed in her face as she leant against him in sweet languor and thought
  of all the events of the day, of the scenes through which she had
  moved&mdash;what they would be like now&mdash;clothed in darkness? The lake
  would no longer be shining nor placid; invisible wavelets would be breaking
  on to the shores of the invisible island; the empty summerhouse would be full
  of dense shadows; no one, even if darkling they wandered there, would be able
  now to see the dry fountain or the corner where the moss rose-bush grew. It
  would be impossible to see the flowers&mdash;the pale wind-flowers which
  Maarten had trampled on in the forest, as it was impossible for anyone to see
  them, the two lovers, so near the house, under the ancient chained tree,
  whose boughs were creaking in the rising wind, whose chains were
  rattling.</p>

  <p>She could not tell if this ecstasy were pleasure or pain; she did not know
  what quality it was that she had all her life sought for in that passion
  named love. She knew that she had found it now&mdash;some deep satisfaction
  of some obscure need&mdash;some satisfying of some nameless desire&mdash;an
  odd relief from intense anguish which seemed to rise from the heart like a
  vapour and disappear into the turmoil of the chill, austere night; all
  feeling of fatigue and distress gone&mdash;all problems of bewilderment and
  doubt, not solved, but dismissed as futile.</p>

  <p>He held her close. She did not remember when nor how she had met him, only
  that he was there now. He whispered in her ears, lifting up her fallen hair
  to do so, that "she was lovely and had always been by him desired, yes, even
  when he had first seen her at that poor rat-hole in London." At this she did
  not flinch, it brought no hint or horror to her mind&mdash;only the picture
  of they two standing there in the dawn light, gazing one at the other.</p>

  <p>"We should," he whispered, "have met before, everything comes too
  late."</p>

  <p>"Not too late, not too late."</p>

  <p>She turned, and, straining up to him into the darkness that was so
  beautiful, under the sound, that was so magnificent, of the sighing boughs in
  the wind, she kissed the words from his lips as he had kissed words from her
  lips when they had paused in the woods. She was at ease, at rest, as happy as
  when she had first loved, and she had thought that passion was immortal.</p>

  <p>The wind and the rain, clean, fresh, chill, pleased her, the thought of
  the silent lake, with the island and the thorn-trees lying deserted, unseen
  in the stillness of the night, pleased her. The memory of the wind-flowers
  that he had uprooted, of the dying girl, helpless, forlorn, whose lover she
  had stolen, pleased her also.</p>

  <p>The great old tree rattled its chains and the plates of rusty iron clanged
  in the wind. The rain fell pattering on all the invisible, growing plants in
  the forest; these sounds seemed to Belle to gather into the beat of the moss
  rose valse, which was no longer tedious or disgusting, but full of joy and
  pleasure.</p>

  <p>"Don't stare up at that shuttered window," she whispered, her hands
  clasped behind his neck. "That girl has nothing to do with you&mdash;no,
  nothing to do with you any more."</p>

  <p>"Nothing to do with me any more? I'm shut out, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, with me."</p>

  <p>She drew his head down so that he could no longer gaze up at the chunk of
  light showing between Lili's shutters.</p>

  <p>Again, as he kissed her, his fingers touched her throat, which was wet
  from the rain.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Lili was dying in the clean, white, lofty room in the bleak
cold light of
  the early spring morning: the boughs of the pines without made a shadow on
  her smooth coverlet. The figures of those attendant on her moved quietly to
  and fro, darkly clad as if already in mourning. The stout father,
  putty-faced, his mouth slobbering, knelt at the side of the bed and prayed,
  his voice out of control, now sinking and inaudible, now rising with sudden
  sharp harshness. The dying girl prayed, too&mdash;incoherently and with a
  fervour that defied her bodily distresses. Her features were sharp and
  pinched, her hair was parted in the middle of her head and two pale plaits
  fell over her shoulder on the flat bosom of her precise, clean, linen
  night-gown. Although her promised husband had been so diligent in her
  illness, she would not allow him to enter her room. She seemed even to sense
  when he was in the next chamber, and would faintly implore her father or the
  clergyman or the doctor to send him farther away. Frau Morl thought this
  uncharitable towards her son; she believed the girl a saint, but this showed
  some strange human weakness.</p>

  <p>Earnestly, a stout dark figure in the bleak, pale night, she bent over the
  neat bed, saying:</p>

  <p>"Lili, you ought to forgive; you know how it is with him&mdash;you know
  that he can't help himself."</p>

  <p>But Lili shook her head on the broad pillow, and continued to pray as if
  she had no concern for anything save her own soul.</p>

  <p>Seeing that her appeals were of no avail, Frau Mori went on her knees, and
  she, too, began to pray, although she pleaded in a different tone from that
  of the doctor and his daughter, pleaded as if she rejoiced in the punishment
  meted out to her by heavenly intervention. Refreshed by her vigorous
  acceptance of divine chastisement, Frau Morl again bent over Lili.</p>

  <p>"Tell us what you know. Tell us what you think. It is only fair to us.
  Besides, Lili, you ought to forgive both of them."</p>

  <p>Dr. Schoppe paused in his prayers: "What do you mean&mdash;'both of
  them'&mdash;Frau Morl? What do you ask of Lili?"</p>

  <p>"She means," said the dying girl, "Maartin and the English woman. Yes, I
  see, but don't let them come near me, not now nor when I am dead."</p>

  <p>She lifted up her hand as if in supplication, and the wide sleeve of the
  night-gown fell apart from her bony wrist and her thin arm. There was nothing
  bright nor lustrous about her, save the two long plaits of hair.</p>

  <p>Outside the tall windows with the pure muslin curtains, the blue-black
  boughs of the pines waved and tossed; in the upper panes of the window they
  were clearly visible, and a strengthening gleam of sun falling through the
  hurrying clouds cast their shapes more distinctly over the panes.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle wished that she could have left the house before this
gloomy
  incident; it seemed to her bad taste on the part of Lili to have come to
  Schloss Morl to die. Why could she not have remained at home? Why need she
  have died at all? A mere foolish fretting, a mere morbid vanity had brought
  her to the death from which she had helped to save her lover. Belle felt
  neither pity nor sympathy, only distaste and impatience mingled with a faint
  disgust. Yes, there was something disgusting in this prolonged agony, in this
  misery of prayers and tears, in this narrow cold piety touched by neurotic
  egotism.</p>

  <p>"If they think she is going to be an angel in Paradise, why do they make
  such a fuss about it? These Christians never seem ready to put their faith to
  the proof."</p>

  <p>She controlled her impatience by dwelling on the future when Lili would be
  under the sandy mountain soil as Daisy was under the London clay, and she
  would be alive, alive with him, her new, strange lover.</p>

  <p>Where should they go? He must have plenty of money. Munich would be more
  fashionable, more gay than Augsburg. She would have new clothes, a
  maid&mdash;she was tired of this silly prim disguise of grey or black, this
  pose of a pious, dull woman that had, after all, taken no one in; she had to
  thank her careful, good breeding that she had been able to do it all.</p>

  <p>She wished that she could go away at once; she was an alien here, no one
  liked her, she was suspected, perhaps even blamed for hysterical, foolish
  Lili's death, and she was weary of the austere white mansion, of the orderly
  ways of the household, of the heavy, reserved presence of Frau Morl, even
  weary of the forest which at first she had found so full of health, peace and
  purification.</p>

  <p>No one interfered with her; all her comforts were attended to; there were
  her meals, her easy bed, her shining cans of hot water, her finely laundered
  linen laid out neatly in her precise room, but she was weary of it all, and
  now that she had walked in the woods with a lover, she no longer wanted to
  walk in them alone.</p>

  <p>How dull, how tedious it was, waiting for Lili to die!</p>

  <p>Belle supposed that the young man was also suffering; he kept out of her
  way, and she knew that Lili refused to see him. They chanced to meet in the
  large room where Lili used to sit; Belle had come in, lightly, thinking that,
  if she closed the doors and played softly, she might amuse herself with the
  piano.</p>

  <p>He was there, seated opposite Lili's empty chair, his face in his hands,
  his black clothes like a blot in the pale room.</p>

  <p>"I daresay you are almost at the end of your nerves, of your patience,"
  said Belle, approaching him softly. "It is a pity that we could not have gone
  away before. But it will soon be over now."</p>

  <p>He did not move, and Belle seated herself on the piano-stool and opened
  the piano. A tall window was opposite to her, through the brilliantly
  polished glass she could see the light, colourless day, the dark boughs of
  the pines. The last time that she had been seated at a piano had been in Mrs.
  Bulke's kitchen the night of Daisy Arrow's death. It gave her pleasure to
  remember that because then she had been in utter despair, and now life was
  opening about her like a many-coloured flower.</p>

  <p>Then, as now, a dark bough had been before her, and peering into those
  high-tossed clouds she could imagine that she saw the blank faces of the
  avenging angels, whose imbecile countenances were like those of Lili
  Schoppe.</p>

  <p>She began to play, very softly, "Wanderer to the Moon," and her mind was
  still on last Christmas Eve, just for the pleasure of the contrast. Odd and
  fascinating to think that this man seated motionless by the white-tiled stove
  was the man whose voice she had heard on the stairs of No. 12. "Why," she
  thought idly, "did he send down for champagne or fine brandy? Some day I
  shall ask him. How pleased Daisy was! She thought that it was such a piece of
  good fortune to have met him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Belle continued to play, her fingers slipped into the melody of the "Moss
  Rose" waltz; that gave her pleasure, yes, that tune that had once been so
  detestable, now only served to remind her of humiliations passed. When she
  danced again it would not be on a public stage for the plaudits of tenth-rate
  merry-makers.</p>

  <p>"You should not play now," said Herr Morl; he had dropped his hands and
  was staring at her over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it just came to my fingers, and I don't suppose anyone can hear
  us." She turned round on the stool. "Why don't you go away? If she won't see
  you, why remain? We could meet in Munich. I'd like to go, too&mdash;if you'd
  arrange it."</p>

  <p>"I can't arrange anything now."</p>

  <p>Belle sighed.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;if it is all over! You're not blaming yourself, are you? It is
  all her fault, if you look at it sanely. Something like this was sure to
  happen to her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Well, a woman who set herself up to be a saint, to save souls&mdash;to
  reform people, never to tell a lie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't believe in goodness."</p>

  <p>"Not if you call that goodness&mdash;it's idiocy, really."</p>

  <p>"Can't you understand what it meant to Lili&mdash;my London
  disaster&mdash;and your following us, your presence here, can't you
  understand that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I can understand," smiled Belle.</p>

  <p>"No, you can't, you can't understand anything, but&mdash;never mind. She
  won't see me."</p>

  <p>"You ought to be glad, it will save you a painful scene. What is the
  matter with you? You were not like this in the woods last night."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking," said Herr Morl, drawing nearer the stove, "of that
  interrupted journey, of Brazil&mdash;the work we were to have done together,
  the faith, the exaltation, and then the warmth, the colour, the brightness. I
  should have forgotten everything. Yes, it would have been a new life."</p>

  <p>"A dream. One can't escape from oneself like that&mdash;you would not have
  liked the country, you would have tired of that absurd missionary project,
  and, of course, you would have tired of Lili, too. The whole thing was only a
  mood, a phase."</p>

  <p>"Was it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course." Stung by his intent look, by his forgetfulness of last night,
  she added: "If you were so absorbed in Lili and her Christianity, why did you
  wander out that night and find yourself in the Argyll Rooms? If you hadn't
  done that you might have gone to Brazil&mdash;without anyone
  interfering."</p>

  <p>Without replying to that, he said:</p>

  <p>"I shall go upstairs again. Perhaps she will see me now."</p>

  <p>Belle sprang up and ran over to him.</p>

  <p>"You're not forgetting what we arranged last night? You're not allowing
  these dismal people to get between us?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," he answered quickly. "We shall arrange everything&mdash;only you
  must be patient."</p>

  <p>He left her alone in the warm, pleasant room with the white stove and
  polished furniture and the pine-trees tossing without the brilliant panes of
  the tall window.</p>

  <p>She felt satisfied, and thought with pleasure of material things, even,
  with zest, of the brown olives and curded cheese, fresh bread and honey-cakes
  that there would be for supper, and all of which she liked so much, even of
  the smell of freshly ground coffee that there would be presently when the
  afternoon refreshment was served.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Frau Morl took her son by the hand and led him to Lili's
bedside; the
  dying girl had made a gesture that seemed of assent when the older woman had
  renewed her entreaties for this interview, whispering into the pillow, above
  the bands of pale hair that fell over Lili's ear:</p>

  <p>"You know what I've suffered, Lili, you know what I've been through, don't
  forsake me now, don't do it."</p>

  <p>Lili opened her eyes and stared up at the tall young man who blocked the
  light from the window.</p>

  <p>He muttered:</p>

  <p>"Don't go away. Don't let go of me. Don't you remember when we first met,
  you promised that you would always stay by me and help me?"</p>

  <p>"You left me, Maarten, you left me&mdash;and for what?&mdash;'the well-
  favoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts.'" Lili's fingers quivered on
  the edge of the sheet that she had nervously pleated together; she smiled
  faintly as if at some inner thought. "You promised, Maarten. Then you forsook
  everything. 'My heritage was laid waste for the dragons of the
  wilderness.'"</p>

  <p>"Lili," said Frau Mod strongly, "that is my son standing there; you know
  how it is with him. Did you not promise to fight the unclean spirit and drive
  out the abomination?"</p>

  <p>"I'm tired," whispered Lili. "God will hear you, Mother, judgment,
  judgment shall come."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the young man, bending over her pillow, "but what for me?"</p>

  <p>"'The wicked shall be as stubble as ashes under foot,'" Lili sighed. "I
  can do no more. I begin to forget. The angel who walked with me went
  forth&mdash;he is gone and I follow."</p>

  <p>"She does not know what she says," whispered Frau Mod. "She is
  unconscious."</p>

  <p>"There is, then, no ease for me, no peace." The young man stood erect and
  looked at the grey clouds beyond the pine-trees. "But I shall know what to
  do."</p>

  <p>"Judgment," gasped Lili, beginning to struggle in a last effort to find
  her breath. "Judgment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ay, judgment," repeated the young minister.</p>

  <p>Lili's head suddenly twisted aside into an unnatural position&mdash;she
  lay as if her neck was broken.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" said Frau Morl. Addressing the corpse as if she was alone with it,
  she said: "You needn't have died, you know, Lili. With a little more courage
  you could have stayed alive and helped him."</p>

  <p>She took no notice of any of them, but turned aside, and with a heavy step
  went downstairs to the room where Belle was sitting, musing over the white
  stove.</p>

  <p>"She's dead," said Frau Morl harshly. "Lili is dead."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Belle. She was arranging some wet white flowers, full of
  rain-drops, that someone had brought to the house out of the woods; with
  careful fingers she set them in a low dish of pink lustre. "I'm sorry. Is
  there anything I can do? Of course, I am going away very soon."</p>

  <p>"Yes," continued the other woman in a strong voice, "she had no courage,
  no strength, and once she was disgusted she had to die."</p>

  <p>"To die of disgust?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, like you might if you bit into a fruit and found it full of maggots;
  you might go on retching until you died of it, I suppose."</p>

  <p>Frau Mod pulled open the drawer of a dark cabinet and took out the pair of
  white socks that she had been knitting for the last few days. She looked at
  these with some satisfaction; they had, after all, been finished in time.
  Then she took from the drawer a pair of small shoes made by herself from
  thick white silk. They had no soles, but were two pieces sewn together with a
  fancy stitch; they were not meant to be walked upon.</p>

  <p>"I am going away," said Belle; "I am going away."</p>

  <p>Frau Morl nodded at her: "I shall speak to you later&mdash;for the moment,
  you will stay here."</p>

  <p>She went upstairs with the white socks that would never require mending,
  and the white shoes that were without soles because they would never be
  trodden upon.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">There was a strong wind on the day of Li funeral, which
seemed to Belle to
  blow away much besides the scattered vapours of the clouds above the
  pine-tree tops. Her own life and conduct seemed as clear as the pale sky
  revealed when the light clouds were driven apart. Everything that had
  happened to her up the present moment was, after all, very trivial, even the
  death of Daisy Arrow&mdash;what was that but a sordid police-court case? Even
  her own silly little cunning practices&mdash;the hold she had tried to
  acquire over a suspected man and his friends, her false witness, her falsely
  given evidence&mdash;how futile it all seemed now.</p>

  <p>She stood there in the little Lutheran graveyard in her decorous black
  dress, letting that strong fresh wind blow full upon her uncovered face.</p>

  <p>"Lili is dead."</p>

  <p>Belle regarded the short coffin with indifference, as with indifference
  she had regarded the short coffin of Daisy Arrow being borne out of the house
  in Great Hogath Street as she had leaned on the dusty window-sill and watched
  the hearse go through the fog towards St. Pancras mortuary.</p>

  <p>Only very simple people would be sorry at such deaths as these, she
  thought. It was strange to her to see the stout father quite
  overwhelmed&mdash;hideous with grief&mdash;standing there at the graveside
  twisting a black-bordered handkerchief ("How had he got that so soon?" Bell
  wondered) in his thick hand, his broad shoulders seemed still heaving, as if
  they would split the seams of his smooth cloth coat.</p>

  <p>Well, he would have to accept his desolation, live without that pretty
  little creature who had wanted to be a saint&mdash;an impossibly immaculate
  sort of creature, as meaningless as the little confections of sugar seen on a
  Christmas-cake, with tinselled haloes and spun-glass wings. She had wanted to
  be a saint! At the first touch of real difficulty or trouble she had faded
  and died; no use to anyone, looking like a wan little monkey on her
  death-bed, her plaits, carefully crimped by Frau Morl, tied under her chin so
  precisely, the bony hands folded neatly on her thin chest.</p>

  <p>The Lutheran burial-ground was on the side of the hill. A break in the
  trees showed the valley bright in sudden sunshine. The bell tolled dutifully
  with laboured pauses between the strokes which the bell-man was counting
  under his breath.</p>

  <p>Belle glanced round at her fellow-mourners: Frau Morl was
  praying&mdash;there could be no doubt of her sincerity&mdash;her broad face
  was quite disfigured with emotion, her pudgy hands were clasped firmly in the
  cotton gloves.</p>

  <p>"She doesn't believe that there is anyone to pray to," thought Belle
  contemptuously. "She's trying to persuade herself so. She believes she was
  once a wicked woman&mdash;she's trying to do penance&mdash;perhaps she'd been
  trying to do penance for years. I suppose that she, too, like her son, was
  clinging to Lili as a means of salvation."</p>

  <p>Belle then, and with the relish of one who performs an action full of
  delight, looked across the open grave at the young clergyman. He, she
  thought, must really be glad to be rid of Lili&mdash;must see that it had all
  been a weakness, a stupid mistake. There must be some flaw in his character
  which had made him attach himself to that futile and empty creature, which
  had caused him to give up his pleasures, to renounce his bold, amusing life,
  for a narrow piety, for anything so childish as missionary work and marriage
  to a girl like Lili Schoppe.</p>

  <p>The funeral service was over&mdash;the sandy soil had been heaped above
  the grave. Belle noticed the small roots of flowers among it. She saw the
  long heap smoothed by the sexton's mattock, particles of sand flew loose
  around the graveyard over the head-stones and the funeral wreaths of
  tarnished leaves.</p>

  <p>The mourners moved away, but Dr. Schoppe remained by the grave of his only
  child. He had put his hands in a ridiculous and childish gesture across his
  face.</p>

  <p>Belle lingered to look at him with curiosity, and as she pried at his
  emotion, she saw that the stout man was staring at her, behind his crossed
  fingers; his swollen eyes were lively with hatred. For a second she
  experienced a sensation of uneasiness, the more horrible as it had no reason
  at all, any more than the feeling of apprehension she had experienced in the
  commonplace empty garden had any foundation.</p>

  <p>She shook off this strange dread with a feeling of disgust for her own
  weakness.</p>

  <p>"Why should he possibly blame me? I've done nothing. He ought to know that
  I could have made it much worse. Supposing I had said all I knew, well,
  wouldn't that, too, have killed his Lili? To know her lover hanged?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly she moved away from the graveyard, her nerves well in control,
  her temper soothed. For she assured herself she loved this fantastic and, no
  doubt, she assured herself, wild and dangerous young man, quite generously
  and passionately&mdash;no matter what he was or had been, no matter how it
  crossed her own interests; she could see no reason why they should not share
  enjoyment of what they both valued. Walking daintily among the graves,
  holding the ends of her shawl together so that the fringes might not catch on
  the sharp arms of the iron memorial crosses, she thought with delight of the
  night when they had stood together under the ancient chained tree with the
  rising wind about them. She had not thought that life had any such experience
  to offer.</p>

  <p>He stood waiting at the graveyard gate, holding it open for her; she
  looked at him as she passed with a grave inclination of her head in return
  for a formal courtesy. She was quite sure of him&mdash;she had him bewitched
  and he had her enchanted. Even when Lili's open grave was between them, he
  had had eyes for no one but herself. He, and he alone, had recognised and
  valued the beauty, the grace, the power that she was conscious of possessing,
  but which had always seemed till now in eclipse. Even those men who had
  desired her, who had petted her, spent money on her, given her praises and
  caresses, had been very soon disenchanted. They had treated her as if she
  were, after all, nothing out of the common&mdash;merely a pretty complacent
  woman, with some breeding and no scruples. Belle believed she was much more
  than that, and that he, this last lover, knew it.</p>

  <p>At the gate of the graveyard Dr. Schoppe turned abruptly and went his way
  without any farewell, merely a nod to all of them and a hand-clasp to the
  clergyman who had read the funeral service.</p>

  <p>Frau Morl watched the figure in the ungainly-looking black frock-coat
  disappear down the sandy path. "He has gone away," she said, "he has done
  with all of us." She looked at her son and at Belle&mdash;"He wouldn't even
  come up to the house to drink a cup of coffee."</p>

  <p>The other mourners&mdash;neighbours, servants&mdash;left them. The three
  walked up alone through the pines. The sunlight slanted across the trunks in
  strong rays, the fronds of ferns were uncurling&mdash;everywhere suddenly was
  the brightness of green, the deepening blue of wild hyacinths, the dark
  boughs of the trees were tipped with a paler colour.</p>

  <p>"The spring&mdash;the summer here all at once," said Frau Morl, panting a
  little as she climbed the upward path. "Soon we shall have the roses."</p>

  <p>Belle did not answer; she was wondering how soon they could get away and
  where they should go? She disliked more and more the pale clean house, and
  the large rooms, and the whitewashed walls, and the dark furniture, and the
  precise monotony of the comfortable routine. She even disliked the pine-woods
  that seemed to crowd in through the tall windows and terrace doors.</p>

  <p>She no longer thought of establishing herself in society, of trying to
  edge into the circle of some small German court, of starting an academy for
  elocution and deportment, of becoming a companion to some old lady of title,
  of trying to teach some whining child English or music&mdash;that, of course,
  had all been part of a delusion. She was not that kind of woman at all. She
  had merely yearned for those things as one who is starved may yearn for a
  flavour of which they have long been deprived, but which they remember
  pleasantly, only to find, when they are glutted with this long-forgone
  dainty, that all taste for it was dead before they began to glut
  themselves.</p>

  <p>She knew now that it was only because she had been so unsuccessful with
  vice, because she had been forced to mix with people who were filthy and
  degraded, because she had to wear dirty clothes, eat poor food and live in a
  miserable room, that she had longed for comfort, security and
  respectability.</p>

  <p>She paused in the pine forest and took off her shawl.</p>

  <p>"The sunshine is quite warm," she said triumphantly.</p>

  <p>It was, at last, spring&mdash;a warmer, richer spring than she had ever
  known in England. She shook off all her memories. She was young.</p>

  <p>Herr Morl waited beside her; ahead of them toiled the stout figure of Frau
  Mori climbing up the steep sandy path, steadily, never looking back nor
  pausing.</p>

  <p>"So there's an end of Lili," said Herr Morl; he thrust the ferrule of the
  stick he carried into the sandy ground, disturbing the light surface to show
  the rich, damp, orange colour beneath. She noticed that he could never be in
  the woods, but he must worry at the soil either with his stick or his foot,
  or, when he was seated, with his fingers always digging.</p>

  <p>"So there's an end of Lili," he repeated&mdash;his tone, like his face,
  was passive. "She is only part of the ground now, just a handful of
  earth."</p>

  <p>"No doubt she is an angel in heaven," said Belle, "but there is no need
  for us to think of her. What was she to you? An obsession, I suppose."</p>

  <p>He replied moodily:</p>

  <p>"How can I tell <i>you</i> what I've suffered?"</p>

  <p>"Don't suffer any more," said Belle urgently, "don't. Look at me."</p>

  <p>He obeyed her; and she smiled at the intensity with which he regarded her,
  as if he stared at once on a wonder and a long familiar friend; their need
  for each other, she thought, was serious and obvious.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason to suffer," she urged, "there really isn't, no matter
  what either of us has been. You became involved with such simple
  people&mdash;they confuse one and make things so difficult&mdash;all this
  talk of sin and wickedness, of God and angels."</p>

  <p>"They're quite sincere, though," he replied; "you know that, don't you?
  When they tell you you're damned, they mean it."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," smiled Belle.</p>

  <p>There jumped again fantastically before her mind Mrs. Bulke's kitchen and
  the picture of <i>The Last Judgment</i>&mdash;the angels, who were like Lili
  Schoppe with their yellow hair and straight features and white gowns, bending
  out of a whirlwind of black clouds on to a chaos of split rocks.</p>

  <p>"She's dead, and her father's gone. We need not think of them any
  more."</p>

  <p>"No," he said strongly, "no. Anyhow, I know what to do." He shook his
  shoulders as if he threw off a burden. "Of course, in the future I intend to
  do exactly as I please. Let us go on to the house, my mother is almost out of
  sight."</p>

  <p>They proceeded slowly up the sandy path. The sun turned the rough trunks
  of the pine-trees a reddish orange, the hard curled fronds of the ferns
  appeared as if cut from jade and amber.</p>

  <p>"I want to leave the house at once," whispered Belle. "I'm playing a part
  here, and it begins to irk. I'm quite tired of it, really."</p>

  <p>"It's dull," he said, as if to himself. "Yes, it's dull."</p>

  <p>"No," she answered, "I don't mean that so much. I wanted that&mdash;rest
  and quiet&mdash;but I don't know, there's something about the place; of
  course, your mother doesn't like me. She's a strong type of woman, and she
  wouldn't ask questions, but she suspects me as a mischief-maker."</p>

  <p>"Do you want money?"</p>

  <p>"No. I've still got plenty left of what you gave me. You see, I've had no
  expenses."</p>

  <p>They were out of the woods, on a stretch of level ground that was blurred
  with the open sunshine. "Besides," added Belle hurriedly, "I can't stay here,
  in the house where that girl died&mdash;you understand&mdash;with your mother
  watching me."</p>

  <p>"No," he agreed vigorously. "No, besides, I want you all to myself,
  somewhere alone&mdash;where no one can spy on us and see what we do."</p>

  <p>She shuddered with pleasure at that. She was conscious that she looked
  quite beautiful&mdash;strong and healthy, clear-skinned, flushed from sun and
  wind&mdash;how different from the tawdy creature who had crept home through
  the fog that Christmas Eve, regretting the clasp-knife that Daisy Arrow had
  taken.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, I want you all to myself&mdash;quite alone. Come down to the
  city&mdash;to Munich&mdash;I will arrange everything."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she smiled joyously. "To think we have years and years before us! I
  will give you back your Bible, too, and that letter. It has not really your
  name on it, you know, nor this address, only the letter 'M.' I exaggerated a
  little to&mdash;well&mdash;to help myself."</p>

  <p>"It does not matter," replied the young man indifferently, "about those
  things, no, not at all."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," she said. She, too, was indifferent about what once had
  been so important. She never even considered what the value of these objects
  might mean, nor if it would be possible for her to return to England and
  reopen the case of Daisy Arrow. All that was over and done with. She was as
  averse from the idea of Maarten Morl receiving any punishment as Lili Schoppe
  had been at his first arrest.</p>

  <p>Before they came in sight of the flat-fronted white house, where the green
  shutters had been closed both in sign of mourning and as protection against
  the first strong sun of the year, he had written an address on a scrap of
  paper torn from his pocket-book&mdash;a hotel in Munich, where she would be
  well received.</p>

  <p>"I shall leave here to-night," he added hurriedly. "I don't care to stay
  here any longer. It is, indeed, gloomy and melancholy. Do you remember that
  story I told you the day we were on the island, about the little murdered
  child and how they buried it in a wood? I suppose it was a wood something
  like this. I never pass along here without thinking of it."</p>

  <p>"You will think of it no more when you are in the city with me."</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;expiation."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that word?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I was just thinking how everything is worked out&mdash;the crime, the
  punishment, whether one repents or not."</p>

  <p>"Come into the house and say good-bye to your mother. She will think it
  strange if you leave me here. When am I to join you?"</p>

  <p>"You know&mdash;I told you."</p>

  <p>She looked up at the house with aversion. "I don't like this place."</p>

  <p>"You can come away when you will. The rooms will be ready for you&mdash;I
  shall see to that to-day."</p>

  <p>"Well then, to-morrow&mdash;I shall leave here to-morrow if I can get a
  carriage to take my luggage to the station. I want to go to the shops, I want
  to buy some clothes. I have nothing but this dowdy mourning."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Herr Mori, smiling, "you will be glad to see the shops again,
  my pretty one&mdash;to buy yourself some finery. I, too, shall be pleased to
  see you in charming clothes."</p>

  <p>He caught her hand as they were proceeding up the path, and brought her to
  a stand. It seemed careless&mdash;they might be observed from the
  windows.</p>

  <p>"You don't believe, of course," he asked, "I mean about that night in
  London&mdash;I mean, you think that I was justly acquitted?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," sighed Belle, "I do&mdash;I must. The poor fool destroyed
  herself."</p>

  <p>Why did he remind her of that? What did it matter? He, standing there in
  front of his respectable, prosperous-looking house, seemed to have no
  affinity with the man who had stood in Bow Street police-court dock; that
  ugly London episode only concerned Belle in as far as it had been a means of
  bringing them together.</p>

  <p>She sighed again, with delight, to think how firm must be her hold on his
  senses, for he did not seem spent, baffled or overwhelmed by the loss of
  Lili, but eager, keen, exultant, as he remained, rigid as a sentinel, gazing
  at her out of those eyes so pale that they seemed in this light, blind, discs
  of silver in the lean face.</p>

  <p>No, he was not thinking of Lili in her shroud beneath the sandy soil of
  the lonely graveyard, nor of her desolate virtue, nor of her cold piety, nor
  of her chill cowardice, nor of the betrayal of her death; he was thinking of
  her, Belle Adair, Rose Rastell&mdash;she, the nameless one, the well-bred,
  dainty harlot, cleansed by months of abstinence from lust, decked for her
  hire, soft, smiling, brilliant-eyed, promising joy and oblivion. He knew how
  tame and tiresome was any other kind of woman compared to the kind she
  was.</p>

  <p>He said nothing; with his hat held against the breast of his mourning
  coat, his hair stirred on his forehead by the forest wind, he stared at her
  triumphant smile, which was full of promise, of cunning allurement, and
  neither moved nor spoke.</p>

  <p>She passed into the house, she was utterly sure of him; her step went to
  the rhythm of a dance, she laughed, gay as when she had felt secure of her
  first lover. At the first window she passed she peered through the chinks of
  the shutters and saw him walking through the forest; overhead the dark
  boughs, underfoot the driftage of white flowers, walking rapidly, blank as a
  shadow in the sunshine.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Everything inside the prim mansion was very quiet. The
green shutters
  allowed only a watery pallid light to filter through the slats. There was no
  one about&mdash;the polished furniture, so dark and heavy, was precisely in
  place: There was no sound save, from the kitchen below, the rush of running
  water. Belle went lightly from room to room.</p>

  <p>In one, refreshments had been laid out on a long table for the mourners,
  but no one had come from the graveyard to the house. The plates of cold meat,
  the loaves of dark bread, the flagons of beer, were all untouched. For the
  first time that year the white stoves had not been lit and the house was
  cold.</p>

  <p>Belle went, with a proud step, upstairs, with a glance of dislike at the
  seated lions on each newel-post. They had human faces, which their manes
  surrounded like periwigs.</p>

  <p>"Why should that," she asked herself, "seem so unpleasant? Why do they
  loom so important in the chilly empty house? Not quite an empty
  house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door of the dead girl's room was open and within was Frau Morl
  polishing the shining chest of drawers, which stood between the windows, with
  a large clean rag. The Holland cover had been removed from the looking-glass,
  which had remained shrouded since the death of Lili. Glancing up into this
  Frau Morl saw Belle pass the door, and called to her:</p>

  <p>"Come in here, please, a moment."</p>

  <p>Belle obeyed.</p>

  <p>The room had already been swept and dusted, the curtains taken down from
  the bed, the mattress rolled and covered, all signs of illness, even of
  occupation, had been removed. The large pale chamber was as if it had never
  been lived in. The further window had been unshuttered and opened, and the
  sunlight coming through the branches of the pines, made a dancing reflection,
  like that of water, on the greenish-toned wall-paper.</p>

  <p>"I'm going away to-morrow," said Belle. "You have been very kind to me.
  You've asked no questions, and I suppose it would be too late for any
  explanations now."</p>

  <p>"I need none," replied Frau Morl, still intent on her housewife's work.
  "What I can't guess, I don't want to know."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. If it will be quite convenient to you, I'm going away
  to-morrow&mdash;it is convenient, I suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Belle could see the woman's coarse flat face in the glass, with her banded
  hair and a starched tucker above the thick neck of her black bodice. It was
  difficult to think of her as dancing and singing on the stage&mdash;difficult
  to think of her as ever young or attractive.</p>

  <p>"When one gets old," thought Belle, standing by the dismantled bed, "one
  must be like either her or Mrs. Bulke, I suppose."</p>

  <p>Fingering the cold surface of a pile of linen with her fat fingers, Frau
  Morl said quietly:</p>

  <p>"You're very concerned, Miss Rastell, about what I don't know of you, but
  not about what you don't know of me or my son."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, that doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not. There's a good deal that I could tell you but, as I suppose,
  it's not worth while. You've never asked my history nor that of my husband,
  nor how my eldest son died."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Belle flatly; she was longing to be away from the presence
  of this woman, from the room, from the house and the forest, longing to join
  her lover.</p>

  <p>"Well, leave it then," said Frau Morl. Belle, looking at her reflected
  face in the mirror, saw that she smiled. "It is not for me to interfere in
  God's designs, nor in His Judgments."</p>

  <p>"I'll deal with those," smiled Belle proudly. "Don't concern yourself,
  pray, Frau Morl, with me." She feared some tedious talk about her soul and
  salvation, and moved towards the door.</p>

  <p>"I'm not warning you about God, but about my son."</p>

  <p>At that Belle paused, her fingers on the door-handle; she was shuddering
  slightly; the room where Lili had died was so chilly.</p>

  <p>"Now that Maarten has lost Lili," added the other woman steadily, "I
  suppose he will become like he was before. You say you're not curious, that
  you don't want to know anything, but I thought it was my duty as a fellow
  human being, just to tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused and stared into the mirror, the pile of linen in her hands.
  Belle saw that her thick upper lip was twitching, and her forehead beaded
  with sweat.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she continued in a hurried, slurred voice, "that was a
  mistake in London. I haven't been able to endure to go into the details, but
  there was some horrible mistake. He had a perfectly good alibi, hadn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Belle, "yes. But what do you mean by warning me against
  him?"</p>

  <p>The tip of Frau Morl's tongue travelled slowly round her lips.</p>

  <p>"I don't know if you intend to see anything of Maarten after you leave
  me."</p>

  <p>"Would it matter to you if I did?"</p>

  <p>"Not to <i>me</i>," replied Frau Morl, with emphasis on the last word,
  "not to <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>She went down suddenly, with the quick awkwardness of heavy middle-age, on
  her knees, and pulled open the bottom drawer and began to rearrange the pile
  of pillow- and-bolster-cases that laid there neatly tied with pink tape.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to say?" asked Belle, standing at the open door. "I'm
  sorry, but I'm tired, I've my packing to do. Won't you please let me go?"</p>

  <p>"I've nothing to say," replied Frau Morl&mdash;"nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," thought Belle, "why she always keeps her back to me. She
  hasn't looked me in the face once since I came in&mdash;only stared at me in
  the mirror."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose it would be any use," muttered the kneeling woman. "God
  wouldn't allow me to interfere. Lili couldn't do it, neither can I."</p>

  <p>Belle suddenly thought that the woman kneeling there was not concerned
  with the rearranging of her linen in the large bottom drawer, but was
  praying.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said, though this fanaticism wearied her. She had no
  patience with childish, mawkish piety. "I think I can understand what you
  want to tell me, Frau Morl. It is, as I suppose, that your son is not likely
  to marry anyone, now that Lili is dead."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't that," replied the kneeling woman in a muffled tone&mdash;"It
  wasn't that. But I've nothing to say&mdash;nothing."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Belle did not see her hostess again that day. She spent the
lonely hours
  walking in the pine-woods. The sun was like company, and there were so many
  flowers out. Soon it would be May&mdash;and summer. She thought most
  curiously of her future, which had bloomed from all the slime, dirt and
  corruption of the past, from Daisy Arrow's grave in the London clay, from
  Lili Schoppe's grave in the German sand, like a gaudy flower which has its
  roots in filth. She might be happy to the full limits of her nature.</p>

  <p>She sang to herself as she walked along, snatches of English tunes; she
  did not notice that one of them was the "Moss Rose" waltz. She would have
  some fine clothes again.</p>

  <p>She began to plan her dresses in her mind. She scarcely knew what the
  fashions were now, but she would discover something that would suit her with
  her tall figure and her trim waist, and the air she had of trailing her
  skirts and shawl and picking up her flounces to show her small feet. She did
  not know how much money he had. It seemed clear that his fortune had been
  exaggerated in England. But there was the two thousand pounds subscribed to
  him by the generous English public. Belle laughed aloud, but not entirely in
  mockery. She was happy. There were no spectres in the woods for her; she
  avoided the garden with the stucco pavilion and the moss rose-tree, she did
  not go down to the lake, where the boat-house stood on the sandy foreshore,
  where the empty boat awaited someone to come and row out to the little island
  with the thorn-trees. But she was free of the upper woods, she had no heed of
  the white flowers that she trod underfoot, she did not wince when she came
  upon the obelisk set up to commemorate the solitary death of Maarten's
  brother.</p>

  <p>"What did he say? 'All Sodom and Gomorrah mourned for him!' How fond they
  all are of these high-sounding Biblical quotations, even that old woman
  couldn't let me go without talking of Judgment&mdash;God's
  Judgment&mdash;well, if all Babylon should mourn for me, I should be well
  content."</p>

  <p>The lonely woman paused by the lonely obelisk, taking pleasure in the
  thought of all these dead people, while she was alive; while she, after long
  denial, was to partake of the joys of life again. How much sweeter would be
  the embrace of passion after the long revulsion that satiety had brought, how
  much more delicious would be the taste of wine, after a long sobriety, how
  charming it would be to go gorgeously clad after months of drab or black
  clothes only fit for a prisoner or a nun. He did not know what she could look
  like nor how lovely her body was under her heavy garments. Thinking of these
  delights to come, her hand traced idly over the new-cut letters on the
  obelisk, and she smiled in a way that she allowed few people to see.</p>

  <p>The woods were full of buds, of the stir of living, growing things, of the
  calls of unseen birds; there was a web of veiled light crossing and
  re-crossing in the dark bluish-green boughs, on the ground where the white
  flowers trembled, as vaporous clouds shifted across the pale sunshine that
  filled the sky; cold and pure the air blew on Belle's firm cheeks as she
  stood erect, smiling by the obelisk.</p>

  <p>She had forgotten where she was as she thought of the delights of the
  city, of all the foregone pleasures for which she had once paid so recklessly
  and then lost so foolishly, that were to be hers again.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The neat carriage came punctually to the trim gates; this
time Belle
  decided to drive to the station round by the long road, for she had no
  companion to walk with her through the woods.</p>

  <p>Frau Morl allowed her to depart with no more than the casual courtesy due
  to a casual guest. The servants who waited on her at the last were
  blank-faced, impassive. Only her fancy played her false, when she thought
  there was an odious grin on the human faces of the lions at the foot of the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>It was a queer house for fancies, seeing that it was so blank, devoid of
  everything save the massive dark furniture, the white porcelain stoves, the
  whitewashed walls on which were the stags' heads&mdash;so commonplace, so
  precise, and yet&mdash;"A queer house for fancies," said Belle to herself,
  stepping into the carriage.</p>

  <p>She was glad when they had turned the corner and could no longer see the
  house through the pines, when the old chained lime-tree, which was beginning
  to put forth small leaves, was no longer visible with the last sunshine
  showing the rust on the iron plates, on the looped chains, which had rattled
  in the wind the night she and Maarten had stood there together in the warm
  rush of wind and rain.</p>

  <p>Down through the dark forest, along the wide sandy road, rutted from the
  weight of the wheels of the woodman's cart, the birds, startled from the
  growing ferns, whirling upwards at the clop-clop of the carriage horses'
  hoofs. They did not go near the lake with the island with the bare thorns,
  through which she had looked as she had told him about herself. Or had
  she?&mdash;was not that a dream within a dream&mdash;something that she had
  imagined as she lay awake on one of those windy nights when the boughs of the
  pines tossed outside and made, as she thought, shadows even in the darkness
  of her lofty bedroom?</p>

  <p>Through the woods in the neat carriage with the carefully-groomed horses
  and the comfortable-looking coachman in his spick-and-span livery, Belle saw
  the railway station with a sensation of relief. "Oh, I'm glad to be away, I'm
  glad to be away."</p>

  <p>Her luggage&mdash;she had after all very little&mdash;was taken out from
  under the box-seat. She fee'd the coachman and was glad of his respectful
  acceptance of her money. There was sometimes a strong sedative for excited
  nerves in these ordinary details.</p>

  <p>With pleasure she watched the neat equipage drive away; she thought of it
  taking the dusty road across the plain, then the sandy road through the
  pine-woods, up to the blank face of the pale mansion where Frau Morl would be
  putting her house to rights after the intrusion of her three visitors: Lili,
  Belle, and Death.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was very gay in the city, full of sudden, sweet spring
air, and Belle
  had charming apartments in a hotel that looked on a square bright with
  budding trees. The florists' shops were full of early roses, late violets,
  and waxy blooms grown under glass, smiling women were driving abroad in open
  carriages, with pale shawls and frilled dresses, all light and delicate,
  holding aloft little lace parasols to protect their pure complexions from the
  first strong sun of the year.</p>

  <p>Belle changed the English money hoarded at the bottom of her carpet-bag
  into German coin, which she spent freely, with a lavishness she had used
  before, the prodigality of a woman who has no past, no future, but who
  gratifies the moment's desire with the moment's gain.</p>

  <p>How hot it was! She hired a carriage for her shopping, and bought a thin
  frock with a silk jacket, a hat of chipped straw, and a coquettish little
  fringed sunshade, silk stockings and fine slippers, a casket of perfume, a
  gold-and-silver embroidered bag and other trifles, until her room at the
  hotel was scattered with milliners' boxes and tissue-paper, and freshly-cut
  string and ribbon.</p>

  <p>She had never felt so sure of any man before, not even that smooth-faced
  schoolboy fool of an officer who had married her and worshipped her for six
  months at lea$, nor even of that other, for whose sake she had thrown safety
  to the winds, he whose ring lay in the pawnbroker's shop in London.</p>

  <p>Yet for two days she did not hear from him nor see him. But never for a
  second was she apprehensive. She ate well, slept well&mdash;bloomed beautiful
  out of her dark story, like a rose on a ditch briar. She had thrown aside all
  disguises; she was not Belle Adair nor Rose Rastell nor any other of her
  aliases, but Laura Pryde, which was as nearly her own name as any name could
  be; the first given her in her furtive, hurried baptism, the second that of
  her unmarried mother.</p>

  <p>On the third day of her stay in the city she took out the Bible and the
  letter which she had almost forgotten, so little of importance were they to
  her now. Her conduct had long been without motive. She would return them to
  him, of course, making the most of that concession. Some women, she flattered
  herself, would keep them in hope of some future hold over him, but she had no
  such thoughts. She turned the Bible over on her silk knee. After all, she had
  almost persuaded herself that she had never seen him at Mrs. Bulke's
  establishment&mdash;that someone else had dropped the thick small book in
  Daisy Arrow's room; for she had lied when she had said that his name and that
  of Lili Schoppe were on the fly-leaf; there were names there, but they were
  strange to her&mdash;common German names, only the "M" betrayed him a
  little&mdash;but there were many other people who had that initial.</p>

  <p>It was the same with the letter that Daisy had sent home to her brother,
  Roger Owen. It was a very silly love-letter written in German, with some of
  the words translated into English underneath&mdash;a sentimental, mawkish
  affair that disgusted Belle, and it was signed with "M" and the address at
  the top was merely München. Daisy's scrawl that had been sent with it read in
  her laboured hand:</p>

  <p class="letter">I'll not tell you where I am&mdash;that doesn't
  matter&mdash;I'll send you some money&mdash;what I can afford. You see, I am
  having a very good time. This is the sort of letter a gentleman sends me
  often. I hope you can read it.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">There was very little clue in that after all&mdash;merely
proving that
  Daisy had been in Munich, but not by any means definitely connecting her with
  Maarten Morl; yet at the time it seemed to her so important, as if she held
  the gallows' rope in her hand.</p>

  <p>She stretched herself luxuriously on the long, easy hotel sofa. The city
  blazed beyond the sunblinds. She could hear music in the street. She was
  intoxicated with herself, with every breath she took, in all the gay noises
  of the city she could hear the steps of her approaching lover.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On the third day he came, freshly clothed, elegantly
barbered, full of a
  strong excitement.</p>

  <p>Holding her tightly in his arms he told her in a sweet voice of all the
  plans he had made for her&mdash;the sumptuous little apartment that he had
  taken; a servant he had engaged. Ah, he knew how to do this sort of thing
  very well. They would be happy, even indefinitely perhaps. Then he held her
  away from him and admired her in her graceful summer attire&mdash;indeed, she
  had chosen her dress with great taste and pains. Everything ugly was
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>"Who is there," said Belle to herself, "who has not something to forget?"
  It did not seem possible that Daisy Arrow or Lili Schoppe had ever lived or
  died, that she had ever stared at a picture of Judgment, that Frau Morl,
  folding away clean linen, had ever stared at her in a mirror, warning
  her&mdash;of what?</p>

  <p>The young man told her lightly and yet with a certain emphasis that he had
  left the church&mdash;that he was no longer in Holy Orders. She had expected
  that and was glad of it, yet she listened with a certain indifference, for
  she had never thought of him as a clergyman&mdash;that surely had only been a
  passing whim, the expression of a transient phase of his character, as her
  desperate desire to scramble into respectability, after her experience at
  Mrs. Bulke's, had been a transient phase of her character. They laughed about
  it together.</p>

  <p>He said they must go out to dine at the most fashionable restaurant in
  Munich to celebrate their extraordinary happiness.</p>

  <p>Belle was willing enough to show off her beauty and her clothes and the
  possession of this fine new lover whom, she persuaded herself, she did really
  love. She had taken great pains with herself&mdash;her charming dress of pink
  French silk, her bonnet of golden straw, so becomingly poised on the curls
  which the French hairdresser had so skilfully arranged. She was quite a
  lovely woman. "Odd," she thought with regret for the last wasted years, "that
  I have been so long in eclipse."</p>

  <p>She considered herself critically in the long mirror that hung in the
  pretty little sitting-room, as different from the broken fragment into which
  she had peered at the Cambridge as she was different from the woman who had
  danced the "Moss Rose" waltz.</p>

  <p>More anxious for her own approval than for his, she regarded keenly her
  well-appointed elegance, the trim waist of glistening silk, the full bosom
  delicately veiled by lace, the flounces, one above the other, nestling to the
  floor&mdash;her graceful head, set off by the fashionable bonnet with the
  tuft of mauve feathers, the cluster of velvet Parma violets, the narrow
  strings of watered pink ribbon knotted under the round white chin. The
  smallest touch of rouge had made brilliant the lips and cheeks, touched to
  the purity of health by the forest air.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Herr Morl, seated on the flowery-patterned chair, his hands
  resting on his cane held before him, "yes, you are a beautiful woman.
  Charming! I hope that you have not stinted yourself. Remember that you can
  have all the money you want."</p>

  <p>"Well, I've spent nearly all I had, and run up some bills. You'll expect
  me to be expensive? Rose Rastell knew how to economise&mdash;I don't."</p>

  <p>"You are a very accomplished actress."</p>

  <p>"Yet I was never any good on the stage, the footlights seemed to put me
  out. I'm not acting now, you know that?" She turned to him, smiling
  brilliantly, offering him all her grace, beauty and charm in return for his
  passion, his money&mdash;"the hire of a harlot."</p>

  <p>"Did you bring me any flowers?"</p>

  <p>"No, you shall buy what you want, the shops are still open&mdash;what do
  you like?"</p>

  <p>"Anything with colour, I am sick of white flowers&mdash;the flowers of the
  woods. I should like something costly, grown under glass."</p>

  <p>"The shops are full of such blooms," he smiled quietly. "How strange that
  you should be so happy to be with me!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" she challenged him to remind her of how they had met, of what was
  between them. "Do you want to warn me what an unstable sad creature you are?
  Your mother did&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My mother? What did she say? She knows nothing of me." He was pushing at
  the carpet with his cane, as in the woods he pushed at the sand and uprooted
  the flowerets.</p>

  <p>"I daresay not, but I don't think that she trusts you very much. She
  wanted, I think, to tell me about your father and brother, but I didn't want
  to hear."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you? You might have found it an interesting story."</p>

  <p>"What has it to do with me? I couldn't be bothered&mdash;you see, I'm
  quite reckless."</p>

  <p>"You weren't like this when you decided to attach yourself to me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I was different, then; starved, desperate, humiliated&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All you wanted was money and a lover."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," she laughed. "I thought I wanted other things, but I soon
  sickened of them. Safety, respectability! I'd sooner be dead than live as
  your mother does. Shall we go? I want to drive through the city before it is
  dark&mdash;such a lovely half-light as there is!"</p>

  <p>He rose, he had put aside every trace of mourning; he wore a light
  overcoat, carried pale gloves; it was certain that he had forgotten Lili.</p>

  <p>She slipped her arm through his and they left the pretty little room, with
  its charming litter of trifles, together.</p>

  <p>How she delighted in the sound of her flounces on the stairs, on the
  perfume that came from her own body, in the smiles and bows of the porter who
  opened the door of the smart little carriage, in the delicious spring
  evening, in her fine young lover.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was the last of daylight as they drove through the
streets towards the
  extravagant restaurant where they were to dine. The well-kept houses were in
  azure shadow, the sky was still blue, the sunshine lingered in the golden
  air. There were gay voices abroad&mdash;echoes of music and of laughter.</p>

  <p>The restaurant and the people dining there were exactly to Belle's taste.
  She liked this kind of company&mdash;disreputable, unscrupulous people,
  well-dressed and well-behaved, she liked elegant debauchery, so rare and so
  costly.</p>

  <p>Herr Morl nodded to several acquaintances. Belle noticed that no one came
  to speak to them&mdash;they were left alone at their table. It surely must be
  her fancy that those who had recognised him had glanced at him a little
  askance, and had whispered furtively together as if they discussed him and
  perhaps her. Well, perhaps not her fancy! Naturally he would be associated
  with that stupid affair in London&mdash;people would wonder who she was.
  Well, they would soon know Laura Pryde, an expensive leader of the
  demi-monde.</p>

  <p>She looked at her companion with pride across the spikes of red flowers
  and the wax candles. How tall, handsome, how well-dressed he was! How
  fastidious as to his linen. She must not remember him as she had seen him in
  London.</p>

  <p>He knew how to order their dinner, how to treat her, to surround her with
  an aroma of admiration, yes, even respect. They had champagne; Belle drank
  again for the first time for many months. Yes, the first time, save for the
  sherry on the journey, since Christmas Eve&mdash;then it had been gin, not
  champagne. It was a pity that she had to remember it was champagne which
  Daisy Arrow had asked for when she had come down into Mrs. Bulke's kitchen.
  It was odd that one could not control memory; there was so much one would
  like to wipe out for ever. She was glad of the wine after the long
  abstinence. The glow of the alcohol in her veins mounted soon to her head.
  She saw everything in brilliant colours with heightened perception&mdash;the
  gilt walls, the many mirrors, the flowers and silver on the little tables,
  the well-dressed, insolent women and their escorts.</p>

  <p>Herr Morl drank, too. She had always thought his sobriety strange. She set
  her delicately rounded elbows on the table and raised the low, flat glass in
  her long fingers to her lips, nodding at him over the brim. They began to
  laugh and talk together quite freely. He ridiculed everything in life that
  had not been connected with her&mdash;his religion, the Church, Dr. Schoppe,
  the mission to Brazil, all that mawkish sentimentality in London&mdash;he
  mocked and jeered at it with a pleasant humour she had not known him to
  possess. He even sneered at Lili, who had been such a short while dead and
  for whom he should have been in mourning.</p>

  <p>"Ah yes," Belle thought suddenly, understanding those looks which his
  fellow-diners had given him when they had entered the room. "Of course, some
  of them knew, no doubt, that the girl to whom he was betrothed had died
  lately."</p>

  <p>She laughed louder; it mattered so little what these people thought; their
  disapproval gave a piquancy to a delightful evening.</p>

  <p>It was rather curious that he dwelt so on Lili, whom he had not mentioned
  before since her death, but Belle encouraged him. There was nothing in the
  girl, really&mdash;she had been a tedious bore, let Lili be wafted away for
  ever on the breath of their mockery. The more he drank, the more he began to
  talk of Lili, tilt he seemed quite beside himself with amusement; his pale
  eyes sparkled with merriment.</p>

  <p>"What a ridiculous-looking creature she was! Her neck was too long, her
  hands were too large&mdash;she had flat feet. Why, even in that straight
  night-gown in which she had died she looked absurd."</p>

  <p>As he said this Belle slightly drew back and set down her glass.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think so?" he insisted, leaning across the table, the flowers
  and the candles towards her; she decided to humour him.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes! There's no reason why one shouldn't wear something becoming
  even on one's death-bed." Belle put her hands over the cluster of gardenias
  fastened into the lace at her breast; the edges of the thick petals were
  beginning to turn brown; the air was hot, and, despite all the different
  scents, becoming tainted. She felt slightly giddy, the wine was heady, and
  headier still the thought of the hours before them, when they would lie in
  each other's arms in the dark. There would be many such nights, perhaps many
  such lovers, she had noticed several men staring at her greedily&mdash;she
  who had draggled unnoticed along the London streets, unable to entice any but
  shabby drunkards, she, well fed, well clothed, triumphant with success, might
  queen it yet in this foreign city full of rich, idle men.</p>

  <p>The young man, whose usually pale face was faintly flushed and whose
  habitual air of reserve had given place to a wild excitement, continued to
  talk of the dead girl.</p>

  <p>"What," he asked, "is she but a wraith on the wind now?"</p>

  <p>"Not that, not that&mdash;she has gone, as we all shall go&mdash;but while
  our span lasts, let us enjoy ourselves."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p class="first">After the supper they danced, first on the terrace then in
the garden that
  was hung with fairy-lamps and where a Hungarian orchestra played waltz after
  waltz. Belle had thought she had forgotten how to dance. Surely one of the
  melodies that came floating through pots of exotic shrubs, the boxes of
  flowers and the festoons of coloured lights, was "Moss Rose"? It was quite
  possible&mdash;the tune was popular all over Europe. She rested on his
  breast&mdash;their step matched perfectly. Belle found it all as it should
  be&mdash;a world made exactly to her measure. She drank again when they
  rested at one of the little side tables, more champagne, glass after glass,
  until she became dizzy from the dancing and the wine and faint with
  voluptuous desire; she begged that they might go&mdash;the new apartment was
  ready, was it not? Let him take her there.</p>

  <p>"Let us get away from all these people," she whispered to him, hanging on
  his neck&mdash;her bonnet had fallen back from the curls pinned up by the
  hairdresser, the gardenias had dropped out of her bosom and been trampled
  underfoot by the dancers, one of her flounces was torn.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, let us go&mdash;it is time now, there must be no longer any
  delay."</p>

  <p>He swung her through the languidly waltzing couples, through the
  restaurant, and out on to the pavement, where the air blew fresh and chill on
  Belle's bare breast, over which, with an unsteady hand, she drew the torn
  lace, and on her hot cheeks on which the rouge and powder had melted.</p>

  <p>"My flowers. I've lost my flowers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind, when you are with me you'll not need them."</p>

  <p>He helped her into the waiting carriage. Belle sank against his shoulder
  in a languor of happiness.</p>

  <p>"You promised me that book, you know," he said, "but, of course, it
  doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>"It does matter, I want to keep my word. Tell the driver to stop at that
  hotel where I am staying and I will send up for them&mdash;the Bible and the
  letter, I still keep them in the little carpet-bag."</p>

  <p>He let down the window and called out directions to the driver, then
  returned to his place beside her; very pleasant was the motion of the
  carriage and the darkness flicked now and then by the light of the street
  lamps; there was an air of festival about the city; the roadside trees were
  grey with buds, everything seemed perfumed. Ah, she was glad that she was
  here, away from the prim house in the forest, away from the dark pines, safe
  from the garden with the stucco pavilion, the lake with the thorn-set island,
  the endless clouds of white flowers, the obelisk, the grave where Lili lay.
  How had she endured it so long when she was fashioned for nights like
  this&mdash;and nothing else!</p>

  <p>The carriage drew up at the hotel where she was staying; music came from
  the open windows, she wondered where the apartment he had taken for her was,
  she was drowsy with the anticipation of pleasure&mdash;surely she loved him
  beyond the snug joy of the senses satisfied?</p>

  <p>"A little carpet-bag?" he asked as he descended from the carriage.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>She watched while he, a dark outline in the gas-lit square in front of the
  hotel, gave his directions to the porter.</p>

  <p>"My keys!" she called out&mdash;dizzy and dazed as she was, she had
  forgotten them. She took them from her reticule and tossed them to him across
  the pavement. Even this delay was insufficient to mar a perfect experience,
  she even enjoyed it, she had thus longer to count over the pleasures to
  come.</p>

  <p>He returned to the carriage with the carpet-bag, and they drove on through
  the city, which was now quite dark save for the gas-lamps along the pavement.
  She lay against him, smiling, sighing. They soon left the wide gay
  thoroughfares and turned into silent by-ways. Belle, voluptuously against her
  lover's shoulder, took no heed of their direction. When the carriage stopped
  and he flung open the door, she roused herself with a start, almost falling
  when his support was removed, and shivering in the keen air that came in
  through the open door of the vehicle. After all, it was still early in the
  year, and the nights yet cold.</p>

  <p>"My shawl," she said foolishly, "I must have left it behind."</p>

  <p>"Never mind, you won't need it."</p>

  <p>He helped her from the carriage and paid the man. They stood together
  alone on the pavement watching the vehicle disappear into the lonely darkness
  of the deserted street. Belle did not like the quarter, the street, it seemed
  to her narrow, gloomy&mdash;too much like that in which Mrs. Bulke had kept
  her establishment. Of course, she had drunk too much champagne, she was a
  little confused, she had not that firm grip on actualities which she usually
  possessed. Well, never mind, she was happy.</p>

  <p>He opened the door with a key he took from his pocket and she followed him
  into a confined passage. She had an absurd sensation that she was walking
  into No. 12, Great Hogarth Street. Surely those were the stairs up to the
  room where Daisy Arrow had lodged, and those the stairs down to the kitchen
  where Mrs. Bulke kept the cracked piano and the picture of <i>The Last
  Judgment</i>.</p>

  <p>Belle leant against the wall laughing cautiously. He was carrying the
  small carpet-bag. How ridiculous that looked contrasted with his elegant
  evening attire, which was, however, a little disordered.</p>

  <p>She followed him upstairs&mdash;one floor&mdash;a landing with a small
  gas- jet and a wire bracket; two floors&mdash;another landing, another
  gas-jet and wire bracket. He pushed open a door and they entered a room at
  the back. He struck a match and lit a candle.</p>

  <p>"Why, this is a wretched place," complained Belle, drawing back.</p>

  <p>"Never mind." He set the carpet-bag down on one of the broken chairs. "The
  apartment is not quite ready&mdash;they will not give me the key until
  to-morrow, and I didn't want to wait. I wanted you alone and all to myself
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"But we needn't have come here," contended Belle drowsily. "Why, the place
  where we had dinner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no accommodation there."</p>

  <p>"Well then, where I am staying?"</p>

  <p>"Nor there either. This will do very well. What more do you want?" He
  leant against the chimney-piece, looking at her.</p>

  <p>Belle laughed&mdash;she felt lost, foolish, out of touch with
  actuality.</p>

  <p>"Surely this is Daisy Arrow's room?&mdash;the bed just there, the rickety
  chest of drawers, the curtains sagging on a string, the worn piece of
  drugget, the small wash-hand-stand, the ewer and the basin?"</p>

  <p>No, it was only that she had a little lost command of herself. Of course,
  such rooms, like such people, were common everywhere. What did it matter?
  They were absorbed in love of one another, and it ceased to be a question of
  their surroundings; he had not given her many praises or caresses, but she
  sensed the passion that consumed him.</p>

  <p>"The book," she heard him say, "the book and the paper?"</p>

  <p>"The key is on that bunch I gave you outside the hotel." He went on one
  knee and unlocked it. "How quiet the place is. I can't hear anything."</p>

  <p>"It is very late&mdash;the middle of the night&mdash;and these people
  sleep soundly; on this floor, too, we are alone."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" She tried to be gay, to be lively, surely she felt happy, what could
  be more desirable than this, and, of course, his excuse about the apartment
  was quite reasonable.</p>

  <p>She waited patiently, her flounces spread out on the rickety chair; there
  was a bottle of champagne, a glass on the washing-stand, a scrap of
  paper.</p>

  <p>"We've had enough of that," she laughed, but he had poured her out some of
  the pale amber wine, and she drank, kissing his fingers as he offered her the
  glass.</p>

  <p>He took off his light overcoat and hung it on one of the brass knobs of
  the bedstead. She took off her bonnet and dangled it by the ribbon
  strings.</p>

  <p>What was that he was pulling out of the carpet-bag? A draggled pink
  feather which had caught in the metal clasp of the Bible. She had forgotten
  that. He shook it off and it fell on the floor at her feet. She picked it up,
  not knowing what she did. There was a hard caked mark on the down of the
  humming bird's breast, that formed the mount of the plume, twisted with it
  was a silver brooch on which a swallow was engraved.</p>

  <p>"Ah, so you've kept that, too," he said, staring. "I remember that very
  well&mdash;so you kept it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," muttered Belle, "I don't know why." She repeated it as if it was an
  incantation. "I don't know why. I don't know why. I kept everything, except
  the key."</p>

  <p>She saw him pick up the plume and stick it into the bonnet that dangled in
  her hand.</p>

  <p>"Wear that. It will suit you very well. It was yours once, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I couldn't wear it now&mdash;what are you thinking of? Daisy
  wore it when she&mdash;I found it on her floor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wear it again&mdash;it becomes you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm so tired&mdash;that dancing, after doing nothing for so long." She
  tried to unhook her bodice, but her fingers felt stiff and unnatural, she
  could not find the fastenings; she stood up and tried to undo her flounced
  skirt, but again she fumbled in vain; she stared into the cheap
  mirror&mdash;was that Frau Morl's face behind her own, whispering:
  "Judgment?" No, she was confused by a memory of that stupid picture where the
  angels had the silly face of Lili&mdash;that darkness before her eyes was not
  the yew spray from Mrs. Bulke's kitchen, nor yet a bough from the
  forest&mdash;it was faintness, a failure of the senses.</p>

  <p>She sank on to the chair again, laughing, protesting, trying to take off
  her clothes. She heard him say: "No need to undress."</p>

  <p>He tried to put the bonnet, from which the pink plume hung grotesquely, on
  her fallen head. She resisted. He tried to put his arms round her, but she
  struggled fiercely, though she had meant to be passionately yielding to his
  first touch. But her strength was slipping. He soon overpowered her; she had
  never thought that he was as strong as that; he dragged her to the bed and
  flung her on it; she heard the frame creak, she saw the white, heavy,
  honeycombed quilt and the two large pillows with coarse clean covers. His
  light overcoat, why had she never noticed, when she had rested on it, on the
  island, that it smelt of turpentine.</p>

  <p>She lay there giggling foolishly with the pink plume which be had thrust
  into the golden, chipped, straw bonnet crushed under her head. It was quite
  beyond her power to move, she must have drunk far more wine than she had
  thought. She lay still, watching him through what seemed a veil of
  hallucination.</p>

  <p>He moved about the room with a deliberate air of one fulfilling a set
  task. He snuffed the candle&mdash;the flame sprang up bright, casting the
  shadows of the shabby pieces of furniture on to the soiled wall.</p>

  <p>He turned over the pages of the Bible eagerly; his shadow fell over Belle
  on the bed&mdash;the candle was behind him on the chest of drawers. She could
  see, too, the shadow of the ewer and the basin on the wash-hand-stand where
  the paint was worn away from the rough wood. "Why doesn't he come to me?"</p>

  <p>The young man put down the Bible and turned to the basin, pouring water
  from the ewer until it was nearly full. Then he took the towel from its
  place, unfolded it, tore a strip off it, and lay it, as if in readiness for
  something, across the back of a chair.</p>

  <p>Belle began to be vaguely interested in his movements.</p>

  <p>Curious! Why didn't he come to her? Why were her senses so overpowered?
  Surely it would take more than wine to make her thus stupid&mdash;helpless?
  Surely a few glasses of champagne couldn't deprive her of the power of
  movement&mdash;of speech? What was he doing now? Turning back his cuffs, his
  shirt-sleeves.</p>

  <p>She heard his voice, harsh, sweet, coming from an immense distance:</p>

  <p>"Lili was all I had. Did you suppose I wouldn't get even with you for
  Lili?"</p>

  <p>No, he hadn't said that; she had imagined it; be had been quite silent,
  moving busily about the room, preparing for something.</p>

  <p>She wished she could rise&mdash;it was so stupid to lie there inert,
  foolish, unable to move her head from that uncomfortable bonnet and broken
  plume, unable to unfasten her bodice or unhook her skirt, unable to be rid of
  all these cumbrous clothes, unable to call out.</p>

  <p>The candle was flickering now; surely there must be a draught from
  somewhere. What was he taking from his pocket?</p>

  <p>He was looking at her over his shoulder. She could see nothing of his face
  but his eyes. Drugged, she realised, with a last flicker of intelligence. Of
  course, that's what he did before&mdash;put a drug in the drink.</p>

  <p>She tried to shriek, but her jaw would not move; unable to scream or to
  stir, she saw him take a large clasp-knife from the pocket of his light
  overcoat, which smelt faintly of turpentine.</p>
