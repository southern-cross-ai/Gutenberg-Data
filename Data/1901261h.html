<p class="caption">Aidan de Brune, the "Tramp Journalist" who
walked around Australia,<br>
photographed in 1921, prior to his walk.<br>
[State Library of New South Wales. (P1/2062)]</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Aidan de Brune was the first person to walk around the perimeter
of Australia. He accomplished the walk a hundred years ago,
unaccompanied and unassisted, walking 10,000 miles (16,000
kilometres). There is compelling documentary evidence to support
the claim, most of it gathered by de Brune, himself, during his
walk.</p>

<p>However, there is much more to Aidan de Brune than completing
this epic walk. He was a prolific writer of serialised mystery
stories, which were syndicated in newspapers throughout Australia
and New Zealand. He was also a journalist who regularly wrote
articles during his walk and submitted them to the Sydney <i>Daily
Mail</i> and other newspapers. Then, too, he was an accomplished
musician who gave music lessons and, at one time, played piano
accompaniments to silent films in London.<sup><a href=
"#en1">1</a></sup><a name="ren1" id="ren1"></a></p>

<p>Yet who, these days, has heard of the man? There is no entry in
the Australian Dictionary of Biography and scant mention on the
internet, beyond the extensive reproduction of his stories and
journalistic work in the "Digitised Newspapers" section of
<i>Trove</i>, an initiative of the National Library of
Australia.<sup><a href="#en2">2</a></sup><a name="ren2" id=
"ren2"></a></p>

<p>De Brune's words, and those of other journalists, as well as
those of people de Brune met along the way, contributed much to
this book. The available material has been organised into a
coherent narrative.</p>

<p>Roy Glashan, of <i>Roy Glashan's Library,</i><sup><a href=
"#en3">3</a></sup><a name="ren3" id="ren3"></a> an online site
which hosts free ebooks, mentioned de Brune to me in August 2017,
after Terry Walker, a book lover from Western Australia, brought to
Roy's attention the fact that there were several of de Brune's
stories serialised in newspapers. These were available at
<i>Trove</i> and Terry suggested to Roy that he, Terry, might
prepare the serials and contribute them to Roy's site, to be
offered as free ebooks. From there, Terry, Roy and myself
catalogued and accumulated the available material and put it
online, at the same time researching the author's life.</p>

<p>It was during this time that we stumbled upon the fact that
"Aidan de Brune" was an alias of Herbert Charles Cull, who did not
simply use the name "Aidan de Brune" in his writing, but lived and
died as Aidan de Brune, once he took on the name just before he set
out on his walk around Australia.</p>

<p>Colin Choat<br>
Sydney, 2018</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Herbert Charles Cull/Aidan de
Brune</h2>

<p>According to <i>Australian Literature</i>, by E. Morris
Miller,<sup><a href="#en4">4</a></sup><a name="ren4" id="ren4"></a>
Charles Francis Aidan de Brune was born at St. Mary's, Montreal,
Canada, in 1879. However, there seems to be no such suburb of
Montreal, but only St. Mary's Hospital. De Brune, himself, probably
proffered this information about his birth but, as with most
autobiographical information supplied by him, it is not true.</p>

<p>In fact, Aidan de Brune (1874-1946) was born Herbert Charles
Cull, in the parish of Camberwell, London, England, on 17 July
1874.<sup><a href="#en5">5</a></sup><a name="ren5" id=
"ren5"></a></p>

<p>In both the 1891 and 1901 British census, Cull was living with
his parents in East Dulwich, London. In 1891, when he was sixteen
or seventeen years old, his occupation was shown as "printer," the
profession he later gave when he arrived in Australia. Ten years
later, in 1901, he was shown as being a "tea traveller."</p>

<p>He married Ethel Elizabeth Crofts (1883-1967) at South Norwood,
London on 29 June 1907<sup><a href="#en6">6</a></sup><a name="ren6"
id="ren6"></a> and a son, Lionel Charles Cull, was born on 3
October, 1909, at Mitcham, London.<sup><a href=
"#en7">7</a></sup><a name="ren7" id="ren7"></a></p>

<p class="caption">Herbert Charles Cull (left) and Ethel Elizabeth

(Compliments of Cull Family)</p>

<p>In 1910 Cull left his wife and son in England and, on 23 May
1910, arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia aboard the
<i>Seydlitz</i>. His occupation on his arrival document was given
as "printer."<sup><a href="#en8">8</a></sup><a name="ren8" id=
"ren8"></a> In an "autobiographical" article written in
1933<sup><a href="#en9">9</a></sup><a name="ren9" id="ren9"></a>,
de Brune stated that he</p>

<p class="newspaper">...broke down in health in America, with
eighteen months of neurasthenia; more than half that time helpless
on a bed. American doctors sent me to England. There the fraternity
declared me a hopeless case. Perhaps to get me off their hands with
the least trouble, they decided that my only hope was a voyage to
Australia. Hospital attendants carried me on board ship, but at
Port Said I walked ashore to see the sights. By the time I reached
Fremantle I had decided there was still room in this world for me.
I looked at that western capital and decided that the country was
good; also that doctors were darned bad guessers.</p>

<p>We cannot know whether de Brune was telling the truth about
coming to Australia for his health. However, immediately before he
began his walk around Australia he wrote to the <i>Referee</i> that
"for some time I have been in...hospital with
neuritis"<sup><a href="#en10">10</a></sup><a name="ren10" id=
"ren10"></a> and, in a letter to his wife in 1913, a transcription
of which appears later in this chapter, he wrote that "I am still
an invalid and oh! I am so tired of illness. This past attack has
now lasted two months and though I feel much better now, I am as
weak as a gnat and have lost nearly two stone in weight."</p>

<p>De Brune's wife and son followed him to Australia and arrived in
Albany, Western Australia, on the <i>Persic</i> on 26 November
1910.<sup><a href="#en11">11</a></sup><a name="ren11" id=
"ren11"></a></p>

<p>In 1911 Cull was, for a short time, the editor of the <i>South
Western Advertiser</i>, at Pinjarra, South of Perth, Western
Australia. He then secured a position with the Murray Roads Board,
based at Pinjarra. During this time he advertised in the
<i>Advertiser</i> as a teacher of "pianoforte, organ and theory of
music," as well as a performer at "concerts, dances and
entertainments."<sup><a href="#en12">12</a></sup><a name="ren12"
id="ren12"></a></p>

<p class="cp"><a name="p04a" id="p04a"></a><img src=
"1901261h-images/P04a.jpg" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration" width=
"250">
</p>

<p>In October 1911 a new Secretary was appointed to the Road Board,
after it had called for applications for a new position of
Secretary-Supervisor. The Chairman "asked the present secretary (Mr
H. C. Cull) whether he would undertake the duties of supervisor
under the conditions advertised, and Cull had expressed his
willingness to do so, provided he had the support of all members of
the Board."<sup><a href="#en13">13</a></sup><a name="ren13" id=
"ren13"></a></p>

<p>Since unanimous support for Cull was not forthcoming, another
person was appointed to the position. Cull declined to accept an
honorarium of £5 and requested that the usual one-month notice
period, for termination of employment, be shortened, if the new
secretary could start earlier.</p>

<p>On 22 October 1912, Cull's wife and son left Australia aboard
the <i>Omrah</i>, and returned to London. After the pair's
departure, Herbert and his wife corresponded. A letter, seemingly
Herbert's last to Ethel, was written from Perth, dated 10 June
1913:<sup><a href="#en14">14</a></sup><a name="ren14" id=
"ren14"></a></p>

<div class="letter">
<p>My dearest Ethel,</p>

<p>I am still an invalid and oh! I am so tired of illness. This
past attack has now lasted two months and though I feel much better
now I am as weak as a gnat and have lost nearly two stone in
weight. Yesterday I was weighed at the hospital and did not quite
reach eight stone five pounds. Still I have at last made a turn for
the better and if I can only keep off the pains, should pull up
rapidly.</p>

<p>The weather of late has been absolutely brutal. I never remember
so much rain falling at one time in this abominable country.
Yesterday was easily the worst day I have ever known. It rained one
torrent throughout 23 hours and Hay Street was flooded into the
shops. Today the air is like a steam laundry&mdash;it's steam
everywhere and over the low-lying country hangs a white fog.</p>

<p>You will notice that I have headed this letter GPO. It is most
probable that I shall go out into the country for a month or two as
there seems no prospect of getting a job in Perth. Besides I think
it best to get up my health again before I start for England and as
far as I can see Perth does not agree with me. So address GPO Perth
and mark "Please Forward."</p>

<p>How are you and the dear boy keeping? I do so long to be with
you both again and once we come together again we won't separate
again in a hurry. I am always thinking of you both and wondering
what you are doing.</p>

<p>The count of the election is coming in day by day and it looks
probable that there will be another election in the course of a few
months. Up to now the two parties are exactly balanced with the
Liberals in a majority of one.</p>

<p>Trade is bad as bad can be. I thought it would improve after the
elections started but it was not so. It seems as if everyone was
waiting to see the final result. Will it improve then? I doubt it.
The bankruptcy court is full and a series of fresh liquidations are
prevalent. It is probable some of the big traders will smash before
things come level. As it is they almost daily reduce staff and the
poverty and distress in Perth is awful. Everyone is living on
capital and when that gives out&mdash;God help them!</p>

<p>First chance I get I'm for England so don't be surprised to hear
I am on the way any day. Lots of love and kisses to both my
darlings.</p>

<p>Yours always, Bert</p>

<p class="caption">Part of Herbert Cull's last letter to his
wife.</p>

<p>It seems that Herbert Cull never returned to England and
remained in Australia for the rest of his life. His next few years
in Australia are obscure, however his name appeared on the
Australian Electoral Roll, for the district of Perth, in the years
1914 to 1919.</p>

<p>In 1916, during World War I, when anti-German sentiment was
rampant, Cull was working as a clerk for Mr Le Mesurier at the
Perth-based All-British Co-operative Society Ltd., when he was
called to give evidence in a legal case. A libel suit had been
filed by Henry Gervase Shugg, a State school teacher, against the
Co-operative, in connection with the publication of an article
titled "German School Teachers," in which Shugg was evidently
described as being German. The defendant society was represented by
Le Mesurier. A newspaper report, covering the trial, described
Cull's testimony as follows:<sup><a href=
"#en15">15</a></sup><a name="ren15" id="ren15"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Herbert Charles Cull, journalist, said he had
followed that profession for over twenty years and had visited
Germany in the course of his professional work, as well as other
foreign countries. He had been in Cornwall and had visited St.
Ives, and had never heard of the name of Shugg. To him the name
certainly suggested German or North European nationality. He had
found the word "Schugg" in a Commonwealth directory&mdash;that of
Victoria&mdash;some years back. He did not consider it a libel to
call a man a German or of German origin.<br>
<br>
His Honour: You do not suggest it is complimentary to say a man is
carrying about a German taint with him?<br>
<br>
Witness: To call a man a Prussian is derogatory, but not a
German.<br>
<br>
The witness said he would consider himself flattered to be called a
clever German: Germans had been recognised as leaders of
learning.<br>
<br>
His Honour: You had better be careful or you will be called a
pro-German. (Laughter.)<br>
<br>
Cross-examined, the witness said he was at present clerk to Mr Le
Mesurier. There were also four people of the name of Shugg in the
directory he had mentioned.<br>
<br>
This concluded the evidence for the defence.</p>

<p>In early 1920 Cull was working for the <i>Bunbury Herald and
Blackwood Express</i> and, on 13 April 1920, the first incarnation
of the name <i>de Brune</i> appeared in that newspaper. Cull
wrote an article concerning a Mr Mahony's withdrawal from
contesting an election. The name "H. F. C. de B.
Culle"<sup>[ii]</sup> appears at the end of the
article.<sup><a href="#en16">16</a></sup><a name="ren16" id=
"ren16"></a> It was quite an appellation. Perhaps, at the time,
Cull did not know who he wanted to be.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[ii. Herbert Francis Charles de Broune
Culle.]</p>

<p>During 1920 de Brune wrote two serial stories for the <i>Bunbury
Herald</i>. <i>The Pursuits of Mr Peter Pell</i> commenced on 24
January 1920, under the name of Frank de Broune.<sup><a href=
"#en17">17</a></sup><a name="ren17" id="ren17"></a> <i>The Mystery
of the Nine Stars</i>, also by Frank de Broune, commenced on 28 May
1920,<sup><a href="#en18">18</a></sup><a name="ren18" id=
"ren18"></a> and ended abruptly, unfinished, in the 5 November
issue.</p>

<p>Something had prompted de Brune to move on without completing
the story because, on 24 November 1920, he began his first long
walk&mdash;across Australia, from Fremantle, Western Australia to
Sydney, New South Wales&mdash;a distance of 2792 miles. Ninety
days later, on 21 February 1921, he arrived in Sydney, having crossed
the waterless and
treeless Nullarbor Plain in high summer, following the
Trans-Australian Railway, moving from fettlers' camp to fettlers'
camp.</p>

<p>Beyond this information, little else is known about de Brune's
life before he began his long walk around Australia, in September
1921, at which time he stopped using the name "Cull"
altogether.<sup><a href="#en19">19</a></sup><a name="ren19" id=
"ren19"></a></p>

<p>During his literary career he used the names Aidan de Brune,
Charles Francis Aidan de Brune, Frank de Broune, H. F. C. de B.
Culle, A.D.B, and John Morriss. However, Aidan de Brune was the name he
nearly always used during and after his walk around Australia and
during the rest of his life. His death, on 15 February 1946, was
registered as the death of Charles Francis Aidan de Brune, with no
mention of his birth name.</p>

<p>In 1921 de Brune made an agreement with the newly founded Sydney
<i>Daily Mail,</i> wherein he would walk all the way <i>around</i>
Australia&mdash;more than 10,000 miles, or 16,000 km&mdash;and the
<i>Daily Mail</i> would publish his articles. This amazing walk,
the first such walk in Australia's history, took nearly two and a
half years and by the time he had completed it, Aidan de Brune was
famous.</p>

<p>During this walk around Australia he kept a travel diary in which he
recorded the places he passed through and the daily and cumulative
distances which he walked.</p>

<p>Back in Sydney, after his walk, de Brune embarked on a career as
a writer. His first book, <i>The Carson Loan Mystery</i>, was
published in 1926, followed by <i>The Dagger and Cord</i> (1927)
and <i>The Shadow Crook</i> (1930). The latter two books were also
serialised in newspapers throughout Australia. It was as a writer
of serialised stories that he made his living and several of his
serials were also published in New Zealand newspapers. He used the
pen-name "John Morriss" for some of his output.</p>

<p>During his walk de Brune often represented himself as a
French-Canadian and when, in 1933, he published what he held out to
be his "autobiography," he repeated this claim,<sup><a href=
"#en20">20</a></sup><a name="ren20" id="ren20"></a> stating that he
was a Canadian, born outside Montreal, who was raised in South
Africa and who later moved to England. He maintained that he had
served in the Boer War and travelled extensively, including to the
United States of America and the East, before arriving in Australia
in about 1920 and commencing his great walk. None of the
information in this "autobiography" was correct.</p>

<p class="cp">*<br></p>

<p>On 23 March 1923, while de Brune was on his walk around
Australia, the <i>Bunbury Herald</i> reported on</p>

<p class="newspaper">the arrival of Mr Aiden (sic) de Brune (known in
Bunbury as Mr F. de Broun Culle) at Onslow, in the course of his
walk around Australia. Everyone to his taste. In the Mechanics'
Institute, the pedestrian lectured on his experiences, before a fair
gathering. After he had done lecturing, the gathering,
probably stirred to energy by his exploit, started dancing, and
kept it up till midnight. Whether the wanderer's toe likewise
proved light and fantastic is not reported.<sup><a href=
"#en21">21</a></sup><a name="ren21" id="ren21"></a></p>

<p>A sour note is struck in the <i>Bunbury Herald</i> article. De Brune had worked
for the newspaper before he abruptly left it to start his first walk
across the continent from Fremantle to Sydney. One can
only wonder at the cause of the journalist's negativity.
Furthermore, immediately before he began his first walk, the
newspaper had notified readers that "Herbert F. de B. Culle is in
no way connected with the <i>Bunbury Herald</i>, and has no
authority to receive money or issue receipts for the <i>Bunbury
Herald</i>."<sup><a href="#en22">22</a></sup><a name="ren22" id=
"ren22"></a></p>

<p>By the way, Mechanics' Institutes, sometimes termed 'Institutes,'
were educational establishments, originally formed to provide adult
education, particularly in technical subjects, to working men.
They were often funded by local industrialists on the grounds that
they would ultimately benefit from having more knowledgeable and skilled
employees. They were used as 'libraries' for the adult working class,
and provided them with an alternative pastime to gambling and drinking
in pubs. Institute buildings can still be seen in many Australian country
towns. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics%27_Institutes">Wikipedia.</a>)

<p class="cp">*<br></p>

<p>Regarding the skills which de Brune possessed to enable him to
undertake his long walks, in a newspaper article written during his
walk around Australia, he cautioned inexperienced people not to
attempt the walk and answered the question, "You have walked around
Australia&mdash;why not others?"<sup><a href=
"#en23">23</a></sup><a name="ren23" id="ren23"></a></p>

<p>He stated that "the traveller must be a natural bushman. That is
to say, he must not only be a trained bushman, but he must have the
bush instinct. He must know the signs of the bush, and invariably
interpret them correctly."</p>

<p>Whether de Brune picked up some bushcraft at some point, or
whether he learned things as he went along, we will probably never
know. We <i>do</i> know that we cannot take de Brune's word when he
provides personal information about himself.</p>

<p>On 25 October 1938, more than fourteen years after Aidan de
Brune had completed his walk around Australia, an article appeared
in the Sydney <i>Labor Daily</i> under the heading <i>Puzzle of
Missing Writer:</i><sup><a href="#en24">24</a></sup><a name="ren24"
id="ren24"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Aidan de Brune, sixty-five, writer of many
mystery thrillers, is himself the subject of a mystery puzzling the
police of two States. They cannot locate him, and he has been
listed at the Missing Persons Bureau. His real name is Herbert
Charles Cull, but he is known all over Sydney and New South Wales
by his professional <i>nom-de-plume</i>. In September, the Western
Australian police received a request from the NSW Agent-General in
London to locate de Brune. His wife, of Earlsthorpe Road, Sydenham,
England, who last saw him in 1913, is inquiring for him.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, Cull, now de Brune, had written to his
wife on 10 June 1913, so it seems that his wife had not <i>seen</i>
him in 1913, but had, in fact, received a letter from him at that
time, perhaps the letter quoted earlier.</p>

<p>Descendants of Herbert Charles Cull believe that his wife wanted
to contact him to advise him that, in September 1938, his first
grandchild, a son of Lionel Cull, had been born.</p>

<p>Constable Thompson, of the Sydney Missing Persons Bureau, stated
that he could not trace de Brune after 1929, when de Brune worked
for a Sydney newspaper. However, The <i>Labor Daily</i> newspaper
was able to ascertain that</p>

<p class="newspaper">a member of the Australian Journalists'
Association saw him in the city less than six months ago; Mr Alan
Foley, literary agent, who handled some of his yarns, saw him
taking his dog for a walk in Centennial Park about three months
ago; he was in the office of Napier and Gardiner (literary agents)
some time this year. Furthermore, the Superintendent of Mails was
confident that a letter to a GPO box would find him.</p>

<p>The newspaper went on to note that</p>

<p class="newspaper">the title of 'Sydney's Edgar Wallace' could
appropriately be applied to Aidan de Brune. He has written dozens
of gripping thrillers based largely on life in the underworlds of
Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. De Brune could always provide an
exciting and ingenious ending to his yarns.</p>

<p>In the following day's edition of the newspaper, a follow-up
article appeared under the heading <i>Story Finds Lost
Writer:</i><sup><a href="#en25">25</a></sup><a name="ren25" id=
"ren25"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Aidan de Brune, mystery writer, has been
located, thanks to a story in yesterday's <i>Labor Daily</i>. His
address, for the time being, however, is not being disclosed. The
<i>Labor Daily</i> has been informed that de Brune, whom the police
have listed as missing for nine years, can be reached via a GPO
box.<sup><a href="#en26">26</a></sup><a name="ren26" id=
"ren26"></a></p>

<p>It seems that de Brune never contacted his family again.
Earlier, in 1928, four years after his walk around Australia, de
Brune wrote an article for <i>Smith's Weekly</i>, which may provide
an explanation for his own change of identity.<sup><a href=

<p class="newspaper"><b><i>Where the Lost Legions Go:<br>
Mysteries That Will Never Be Solved.</i></b>
</p>

<p class="newspaper">"He left the house and..."<br>
<br>
These words are often the prelude to one of those mysteries the
police departments of the States are coming to dread. Where has he
gone to? What were the reasons behind his action? All efforts to
probe his past&mdash;to discover some clue that will place the
trackers on his trail&mdash;fail.<br>
<br>
How did he do it? In these days of the greatest freedom for the
individual it is remarkably easy to disappear. "John Smith" kissed
his wife and family and walked out of his home. They watched him
disappear round the corner and returned to the house, prepared to
welcome him at night.<br>
<br>
But "John Smith" did not return. He did not take his usual train,
or tram, into the city. Instead, he walked to some line of
communications where he was unknown. Once in some strange city he
went to a big store where he was an unregarded purchasing unit.
There he purchased clothes varying considerably from his usual
tastes. With the change of clothing he changed his identity. He
became "Tom Brown."<br>
<br>
<i>Completing the alias.</i><br>
<br>
In new clothes, bearing a new name, he assumed a new manner. "John
Smith" may have been studious, and retiring; "Tom Brown" sought the
high spots of the night life of his new city. His first object was
to establish a new history; perhaps also a new means of livelihood.
Amid the unobservant masses of the city he was fairly safe, even if
he could not completely discard the many little mannerisms he
gathered in his former life, though these are danger-points likely
to betray him to a keen watcher who knew him in his "John Smith"
days.<br>
<br>
Why do men and women disappear? There can be no doubt that a
majority of the disappearances are voluntary. A review of scores of
cases shows that a large proportion are persons regarded by their
acquaintances as unimaginative plodders. Can it be assumed that the
daily grind, the unadventurous, placid existence, suddenly palled?
Did a psychological reaction drive the victim out in search of a
dimly visioned adventure? Was there some sudden awakening of a long
dormant subconsciousness inducing an unreasoned fear that the
long-worn groove was leading to mental stagnation&mdash;at the end,
the madhouse?</p>

<p>The article might have been an apology for the life which de
Brune, himself, had chosen to lead.</p>

<p class="caption">Aidan de Brune in 1933.<br>
(Maryborough Chronicle, 4/4/1933, p.8)</p>

<p>Around the time that he wrote the above article, de Brune was
living at the <i>Astoria</i>, a block of flats at 1 Waruda Street,
Kirribilli, near the northern pylon of the Sydney Harbour
Bridge.<sup><a href="#en28">28</a></sup><a name="ren28" id=
"ren28"></a> The bridge was opened in 1932, after de Brune had
moved from the <i>Astoria</i>, though construction had begun in
1923.</p>

<p>In <i>North Sydney History Walk</i>, a guide published by North
Sydney Council, which describes a walking tour of Kirribilli, the
following description of the <i>Astoria</i> is
given:&mdash;<sup><a href="#en29">29</a></sup><a name="ren29" id=
"ren29"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Built in 1908, Beulah Flats (as it was
originally named) was one of the first high rise apartment
buildings on the Sydney Harbour foreshores. The property was owned
by Mrs Helen White, widow of James White MLC, resident and owner of
Cranbrook, Rose Bay, and owner of famous Melbourne Cup racehorse,
Carbine. The building was renamed the <i>Astoria Flats</i> and
contained 171 rooms, a 10,000 sq. ft. roof top garden, lounge and
billiard rooms, dining room and private sea baths beneath the
ground floor.</p>

<p class="caption">The Astoria, Kirribilli (building on left), in 2018.<br>

<p>De Brune was obviously doing very well from the proceeds of his
serialised stories. Perhaps he was also doing other journalistic
work. However, he was forced to make a hasty exit from the
<i>Astoria</i>. The "walking guide" continues:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">Mrs White, thrice married and twice titled,
left Sydney soon after the building was completed. When she died in
the early 1920s she left the <i>Astoria</i> to her stepdaughter Mab
McLachlan. In 1928 the property was sold to Emanuel Myerson for
£22,500 and renamed Hotel Braeburn. The residents of the property
were evicted suddenly in October 1930 when the landlady Mrs L.
McCormick fell into arrears with her rent.</p>

<p>The <i>Evening News</i> of 22 October 1930 described the
situation:<sup><a href="#en30">30</a></sup><a name="ren30" id=
"ren30"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Faced with the stern realities of having the
bailiffs on the premises, of there being no possibility of getting
a meal, and of having the carpets auctioned from under their feet
at noon, the residents of this fashionable Kirribilli establishment
tumbled out in unceremonious fashion.</p>

<p>Following his hasty departure from the <i>Astoria</i>, De Brune
moved to 60 Kellett Street, Darlinghurst, on the southern side of
Sydney Harbour. He remained there for some years. In 1943 he was
living at 4 Pittwater Road, North Manly, and, at the time of his
death, was living in Randwick, one of Sydney's Eastern
Suburbs.<sup><a href="#en31">31</a></sup><a name="ren31" id=
"ren31"></a></p>

<p>After his death, the works of Aidan de Brune fell into
obscurity. By 1938 the flood of serialised stories was over, and de
Brune, at the age of sixty-four, seemingly retired. Only very
occasionally can one of his books be found for sale. A few can be
found in public libraries. Fortunately, the serialised stories which
appeared in newspapers have been rescued from oblivion as ebooks
and can now be accessed on the internet. A link is provided in
Appendix 3.</p>

<p>Herbert Charles Cull, or Charles Francis Aidan de Brune, as his
name appears in the Australian Electoral Rolls in the 1930s, died
at the Little Sisters of the Poor Home at Randwick, Sydney on 15
February 1946, a few months short of his seventy-second birthday.
He was buried as Charles Francis Aidan de Brune, in the Catholic
Cemetery, Botany, New South Wales.<sup><a href=
"#en32">32</a></sup><a name="ren32" id="ren32"></a></p>

<p>The death registration records his mother's maiden name as Mary
Ann Everleigh. Her marriage certificate shows Sarah Ann Eveleigh.
De Brune did have a sister, Mary Eveleigh Cull, so perhaps he was
acknowledging his sister, when he provided these details before his
death. His father's name was shown as Aidan de Brune, occupation
unknown.</p>

<p>Herbert Charles Cull/Charles Francis Aidan de Brune died from
"chronic myocarditis" and was shown on his death certificate as
having never been married.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *<br></p>

<p>A grandson of Herbert Charles Cull was a merchant seaman. He
decided in 1964 that he did not wish to continue his life at sea
and settled in Perth, Western Australia, with friends he had made
through his many trips to Fremantle and around Australia. By
chance, he had come to the same town that his grandfather had
reached, about fifty years before. Some years later, Herbert's son,
Lionel Cull, came to visit <i>his</i> son and, for the first time,
related the story of how Herbert Charles Cull had come to Perth and
then "disappeared."</p>

<p>The grandson was very surprised to find that, just by chance, he
had landed in the very place his grandfather had lived. Later,
other members of the family came to live in Australia including, in
the 1980s, Lionel and his wife Doris. Lionel spent some time trying
to track down his father, Herbert, but without success.</p>

<p>Now, at last, members of the Cull family know what became of
Herbert Charles Cull. However, they will never really know why he
changed his name to Aidan de Brune and why he severed all contact
with his family.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>A Note from the Cull Family</h2>

<p>Lionel Cull spent much of his life trying to track down his
father, Herbert. He was also totally fixated with finding his Cull
ancestors. Like his father, Herbert, Lionel would daily walk miles
upon miles. He sought to reach libraries and he travelled around
the country (both in the United Kingdom and Australia) to continue
his search, in the hope of piecing together where his father had
ended up and details of the journey along the way.</p>

<p>Every day Lionel lived and breathed his mission, documenting
everything, writing and re-writing, typing and re-typing his
findings, formulating books of any Cull that ever existed. However,
ultimately he was unsuccessful in his goal of finding his missing
father.</p>

<p>Did Aidan de Brune know of his own son's growing family? We will
never know. Lionel was an only child and never really got to know
his father as he was only a toddler when he and his mother Ethel
returned to England.</p>

<p>The family now believe that the newspaper article in 1938,
regarding the search for Herbert's whereabouts, was to advise Aidan
de Brune of the birth of his first grandchild.</p>

<p>Since the article mentioned both names&mdash;Aidan de Brune and
Herbert Charles Cull&mdash;one must ask whether Ethel knew of
Herbert's pseudonym. If she did, we can only presume that she never
told her son, as this would have been a key fact for Lionel in
assisting him to trace his father's footsteps.</p>

<p>Thanks to technology, the internet, the <i>Trove</i> online
library of newspapers and one very dedicated researcher in Colin
Choat, Aidan de Brune's family was accidentally found. Colin
contacted a distant relative who had an online "tree" of the Cull
family, asking her whether she had any information about Herbert
Charles Cull. She passed on Colin's email to us. We could not
believe what he had to tell&mdash;that Herbert Charles Cull and
Aidan de Brune were the same person.</p>

<p><u>Herbert Charles Cull/Aidan de Brune's Family:</u>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Son: Lionel Charles Cull</li>

<li>Grandchildren: Michael, Margaret, Richard, Timothy</li>

<li>Great Grandchildren: Simon, Ruth, Mandi, Melanie, Alexander,
Juliet, Margaret, William, Rebekah, Michaela, Caroline.</li>
</ul>

<p>We sincerely cannot thank Colin Choat enough for solving this
family mystery! For so many years we knew nothing of the
man&mdash;it was as if Herbert just vanished. Our family is
overjoyed to learn that he was someone with an incredible story and
a creative spirit, who achieved this astounding and historical
feat, while held in great and warm regard by those he met. It is
unfortunate that Lionel did not get to experience this day during
his lifetime.</p>

<p>Herbert/Aidan did have a family who would have loved to have
known him.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>A Walk from Fremantle to Sydney</h2>

</p>

<p class="caption">The route of Aidan de Brune's walk from
Fremantle to Sydney.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>On 24 November 1920 Aidan de Brune left Fremantle, Western
Australia, in an endeavour to walk to Sydney by way of Kalgoorlie,
along the Trans-Australian Railway, and then via Adelaide and
Melbourne, a distance of approximately 2800 miles. He intended to
walk the distance in eighty-five days, at an average of
thirty-three miles every day.<sup><a href=
"#en33">33</a></sup><a name="ren33" id="ren33"></a></p>

<p>About a month later, on 31 December 1920, from Kingoonya, 200
miles west of Port Augusta, de Brune explained his
position:<sup><a href="#en34">34</a></sup><a name="ren34" id=
"ren34"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">The following particulars of my walk from
Fremantle to Sydney in eighty-five days may be of interest. The
walk was undertaken for a wager, and at the present time I am well
up to my timetable. I must walk from Fremantle to Sydney in
eighty-five days. I started on November 24. I am not allowed to
ride in any public vehicle or any vehicle engaged by anyone for any
purpose. I may accept occasional lifts, but they must be
offered&mdash;I cannot ask for them.<br>
<br>
I started on 24 November, 1920, and walked to Kalgoorlie (387
miles) in ten and a half days. I walked across the Nullarbor Plain,
Naretha to Ooldea, in eleven days, crossed the Western
Australia-South Australia border on 18 December 1920 and passed the
521-mile mark (Trans-Australian Railway) on 19 December. This was
one-third of my total distance. I am well up to timetable, and hope
to enter Port Augusta on January 5, and will then write further. I
feel quite fit, and my feet are behaving excellently.</p>

<p>De Brune was meticulous in his record-keeping. He was also
well-regarded by those who came in contact with him. However, he
was not averse to adding a little colour to the stories he told to
his audience, when giving lectures, and in articles submitted to
newspapers. A few paragraphs hence, we find the reporter on the
<i>Bunbury Herald</i> refer to de Brune arriving in Sydney "five
days too late to win the <i>alleged</i> wager" of £400 sterling.
The <i>Bunbury Herald</i> was a little leery of de Brune, following
his unexpected departure from Bunbury, hence its use of the word
<i>alleged</i>. Perhaps there was no wager at all.</p>

<p>On another occasion, during his walk <i>around</i> Australia, de
Brune stated that:<sup><a href="#en35">35</a></sup><a name="ren35"
id="ren35"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">His travels through the Territory and East
Kimberley were comparatively uneventful, the natives being friendly
throughout. He is unarmed, and walks, bareheaded, except for a few
hours in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>Of course, it was hot <i>all</i> day on most days, when he was
in the tropics and the few photos that we have of him show him
wearing a hat. Then, too, he referred once to an aborigine trying
to steal his pack, and being given a "thrashing."<sup><a href=
"#en36">36</a></sup><a name="ren36" id="ren36"></a> Later, in the
walk he maintained that he had had no problems with the
aborigines.</p>

<p>These examples are provided as an early indication that some of
his remarks may be a little <i>exaggerated</i>. However, there is
not a doubt that he walked the distances that he stated, in the
time that he stated. His diary of his walk around Australia is
meticulous in listing distances walked and in providing
certification of his location by people who were there.</p>

<p>Following the report, above, from Kingoonya, the following
article appeared in the Bordertown <i>Border Chronicle</i> on 28
January 1921:<sup><a href="#en37">37</a></sup><a name="ren37" id=
"ren37"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Mr Aidan de Brune dropped casually into the
<i>Chronicle</i> Office on Friday last and, in spite of the
weather, coolly stated that he was walking across Australia from
Freemantle to Sydney. He certainly looked like it or even more so.
He said that he was walking for a wager and would win if he did the
journey in eighty-five days. He arrived at Bordertown at 11.30 on
Friday&mdash;fifty-nine days out of port. He had crossed the
Nullarbor Plain and reached Adelaide on Friday, 14th January,
starting immediately for the trip to Melbourne and crossing the
desert in three and a half days. He had averaged thirty-three miles
a day since starting out.<br>
<br>
His complexion, when he arrived here, harmonised so well with the
brick front of the Chronicle office that, as a man and a brother,
the editor could not refuse his mild request to sign and
authenticate his diary, before he departed, hurriedly, for
Wolseley, <i>en route</i> for Melbourne.<br>
<br>
The whole thing seemed a kind of wild goose caper, but Australia is
a free country and, as Mr de Broune appeared of full age and
entitled to please himself, the editorial staff gave him its
blessing and a free copy of last week's paper. He cheerfully
departed for Wolseley, flying light <i>in re</i> the matter of
baggage, carrying nothing, in fact, except his hopes of winning his
wager, our blessing, and the <i>Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>Five weeks later, on 4 March 1921, the <i>Bunbury Herald</i>
reported:<sup><a href="#en38">38</a></sup><a name="ren38" id=
"ren38"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">WEARY WALKER, FREMANTLE TO SYDNEY. LOSES £400
WAGER.<br>
<br>
Those who knew Mr Herbert Cull, or Culle de Broune, when in
Bunbury, will be interested in the following Sydney telegram of 21
February:<br>
<br>
A message from Goulburn says that a Canadian arrived yesterday,
after walking from Fremantle in eighty-five days. He undertook to
walk from Fremantle to Sydney in eighty-five days for a wager of
£400 sterling. He arrived at Goulbourn yesterday and announced he
had lost the wager, as he should have been in Sydney. The traveller
was footsore and emphasised that, only for an attack of dysentery,
he would have won. He expects to reach Sydney five days hence.
A later message announced his arrival in Sydney five days too
late to win the alleged wager.</p>

<p>The walk from Fremantle to Sydney took ninety days&mdash;24 November
1920 to 21 February 1921. De Brune claimed the following records for the
walk:<sup><a href="#en39">39</a></sup><a name="ren39" id=
"ren39"></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Fremantle to Kalgoorlie, 387 miles in 10½ days;</li>

<li>Across Western Australia (Fremantle to Deakin), 841 miles in 24
days.<sup><a href="#en40">40</a></sup><a name="ren40" id=
"ren40"></a></li>

<li>Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, via Trans-Australian Railway, 1051
miles in 46 days;</li>

<li>Nullarbor Plain, 400 miles, in 11½ days;</li>

<li>Fremantle to Adelaide, 1710 miles, in 52 days;</li>

<li>Fremantle to Melbourne, 2199 miles, in 68 days;</li>

<li>Fremantle to Sydney, 2792½ miles, in 90 days;</li>

<li>Adelaide to Melbourne, 489 miles, in 16 days;</li>

<li>Adelaide to Sydney, 1082 miles, in 38 days;</li>

<li>Melbourne to Sydney. 593½ miles, in 22 days.</li>
</ul>

<p>On his next walk, around the perimeter of Australia, de Brune
kept a travel diary and donated it, after he had concluded the
walk, to the State Library of New South Wales. The library refers
to it as a <i>manuscript journal</i>. This will be discussed in the
next chapter. We have no such record of his first walk, from
Fremantle to Sydney.</p>

<p>However, while de Brune was on his walk <i>around</i> Australia,
the <i>Sydney Mail</i> published a short story written by him,
titled <i>Just a Woolly</i>.<sup><a href=
"#en41">41</a></sup><a name="ren41" id="ren41"></a> In Australia,
the term <i>woolly</i> is used to refer to a sheep. However, when
de Brune wrote the story a <i>woolly</i> was also a slang term
applied to <i>fettlers</i> on the Trans-Australian Railway.
Therefore it seems that de Brune was, in the story, using the
impressions gained during the walk from Fremantle to Sydney. A
vivid description of the conditions which he, himself, would have
experienced, is provided:</p>

<p class="newspaper">The midsummer sun beat down remorselessly on
the Nullarbor Plain, covering the bare earth with a haze that
quivered unceasingly. There was not a tree to be seen, and the
distant horizon encircled the earth as the edge of a vast saucer.
Here and there were stunted saltbushes, withered and gaunt, rising
only a few inches from the soil. They were bushes in name only,
resembling more bundles of dried twigs set on end.<br>
<br>
Across the, centre of the great circle ran the iron road of the
Trans-Australian Railway, the tie that binds East and West
Australia. At intervals along the railway were the slender iron
columns bearing, on crosspieces, half-a-dozen telegraph lines. They
were the only things that stood definitely above this plain of
desolation. So far as eye could see there was no living thing.
There was no vegetation, not a blade of grass to keep life in a
kangaroo, had one ventured so far from the bushlands.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="1901261h-images/P09.jpg" alt=
"Scene from 'Just a Wooly'" title="Scene from 'Just a Wooly'"

<p>Perhaps it was during this walk that de Brune conceived the idea
of doing a walk around the perimeter of the continent.</p>

<p class="caption">John J. Gay (J. J. Gay Papers, State Library of
NSW)</p>

<p>Aidan de Brune set out from 7-11 Pitt Street, Sydney, a stone's
throw from Circular Quay, on 20 September 1921. He was forty-seven years old,
although he usually held himself out to be five years younger. He travelled north
through New South Wales and Queensland. At Cairns, in northern
Queensland, he turned west and travelled though Queensland and the
Northern Territory to Darwin. He then crossed into Western
Australia, travelled west to Broome, down the coast to Perth, and
on to Port Augusta. He then walked east into South Australia and
visited Adelaide, walked through Victoria and visited Melbourne and
then headed north, back into New South Wales. He reached his
starting point in Pitt Street, Sydney on 4 March 1924.</p>

<p>There is no record of any successful attempt to achieve this
goal of walking around Australia, unaccompanied and unassisted,
<i>before</i> the successful completion of the walk by de Brune.
His initial goal was to complete the walk in twelve months. In the
event, it took him almost two and a half years (897 days). He
walked on 572 days and for 325 days he spent time in hospital
recovering from sickness and injury (mostly bad feet) or rested. He
accepted no lifts and used no form of mechanical transport. This is a
truly remarkable feat, that has unaccountably slipped into
obscurity in the one hundred years since its completion.</p>

<p>By his own account, de Brune organised his walk around Australia
in the following manner:<sup><a href="#en43">43</a></sup><a name=
"ren43" id="ren43"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">At that time certain gentlemen were forming
the Sydney <i>Daily Mail</i>. One day I wandered into Mr Gay's
Offices and announced that I proposed to walk around
Australia&mdash;and would he pay for articles on the trip? Mr Gay
was blunt. First he told me exactly how many kind of fools I was to
think of such a trip, then came to an agreement, with business-like
promptitude. Within a few hours I had gathered together what I
thought necessary for an 11,000 miles trip, and had left Sydney.
Two and a half years later I came to Sydney again having, in the
meantime, visited nearly every port on the extensive coastline.
More to the point, I had proved possible a trip which quite a
number of Sydney wise-heads had declared to be sheer suicide.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Mail</i> was published from 6 January, 1922 to 22
January, 1924, when it was incorporated into the <i>Labor
Daily</i>.<sup><a href="#en44">44</a></sup><a name="ren44" id=
"ren44"></a> The first edition of the "new series" of the <i>Labor
Daily</i> was published on 23 January, 1924.<sup><a href=
"#en45">45</a></sup><a name="ren45" id="ren45"></a> It seems that
the only editions of the <i>Daily Mail</i> known to exist, with the
exception of the very first edition,<sup><a href=
"#en46">46</a></sup><a name="ren46" id="ren46"></a> are those from
October 1923 to January 1924.<sup><a href=
"#en47">47</a></sup><a name="ren47" id="ren47"></a> This is
unfortunate, as we do not have access to articles written by or
about de Brune, which first appeared in the <i>Daily Mail,</i> for
the greater part of his walk, except where other newspapers carried
the stories and acknowledged that the source was the <i>Daily
Mail</i>. The exception is a column in the first edition of the
newspaper.</p>

<p>However, many newspapers carried their own articles about him as
he made his way around and whenever he passed through a town with a
newspaper office he always made himself known. He was always happy
to receive publicity and he was always happy to have people enter
in his diary certification of his presence in a place.</p>

<p><i>The Amateur Tramp</i>, as he styled himself, at least for
some of the walk, maintained a travel diary for the entire trip,
which provided details of daily distances travelled and the places
he passed through, or at which he camped. He also sought
<i>certification</i> of the fact that he was at a particular place
at a particular time and the diary is littered with testimonials
and good wishes, signed by people with whom he came in contact.</p>

<p>Following his walk, he typed up the diary into a book, titled
<i>Record Diary of a Walk Around Australia</i>. In 1924, both the
diary, consisting of four small pocket books, and a copy of the
book, were donated by de Brune to the State Library of New South
Wales. Further details are provided in Appendix 1.</p>

<p>The diary does not provide long descriptions of the places he
passed through. Sometimes a brief note describes something unusual.
We must look to the newspaper articles which he and others wrote,
in order to build the story of his walk.</p>

<p>De Brune made an entry in his diary for every day he was on his
walk, a total of 897 days. He did not number the first day, on
which he started out in mid-afternoon, probably because he did not
get out of the Sydney Metropolitan area. Thereafter he numbered
every day and, after some time, began also recording the number of
days on which he actually walked, totalling 572 days.</p>

<p>Sometimes he did not walk because of bad weather, because he was
ill, or because he wished to rest. Along the way he sometimes made
minor errors in the day number, here and there duplicating a number
or skipping a number. Then, towards the end of his walk, he
realised that, because of errors, his day numbers did not tally
with the actual number of days (897), although he had an entry for
every day, showing the date.</p>

<p>The day number referred to in <i>this</i> book is the <i>actual
sequential day</i>, starting from day one, 20 September 1921, and
ending at day 897, 4 March 1924.</p>

<p>Quotations from the diary are shown in italics, unreferenced,
mostly under the "date heading" for the day on which they were
written.</p>

<p>All distances are given in miles (m.), the unit of measurement
used at the time of the walk. One mile = 1.60934 kilometres.
Multiplying miles by 1.6 provides a quick, reasonably accurate
conversion to kilometres. In the diary, de Brune records his
mileage for the day and, in brackets, his cumulative mileage for
the walk. Statistics for the walk are provided at the end of
this book.</p>

<p>Where possible, the current spelling of place names is given. De
Brune would often have heard names from others and "guessed" the
spelling, when he later wrote them in his diary, so we cannot
assume that his spelling was always accurate. In some cases the
name he used was not found on the internet.</p>

<p class="cp">*<br></p>

<p>Having reached Sydney earlier in the year, on his walk from
Fremantle to Sydney, de Brune was, no doubt, aware of the scale of
the challenge which he was about to undertake. It did not start
well. His journey began in this way. Writing from the State
Hospital, Lidcombe on 10 September 1921, he explained:<sup><a href=
"#en48">48</a></sup><a name="ren48" id="ren48"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">For some time I have been in the above
hospital with neuritis. However, I am now quite fit again, and hope
to be in Sydney on Monday week. While I have been here I have
projected a journey around Australia, via Brisbane, Cairns, Port
Darwin, Wyndham, Broome, Derby, Geraldton, Fremantle, Perth,
Albany, Eucla, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney; the trip to be
accomplished within twelve months. This will mean about the same
average as I made on my trip from Fremantle to Sydney last November
to February. This time I hope to take a camera with me, and get a
record of my travels, which will be of interest. If I can get away
from here (and there is little doubt) on Monday week, I propose to
leave Sydney, northwards, on Wednesday, 21st inst.</p>

</p>

<p>We have no idea what symptoms de Brune showed, to warrant a
diagnosis of neuritis, but he maintained that he was over it, as he
prepared to begin his walk. Neuritis is "inflammation of a nerve or
the general inflammation of the peripheral nervous system. Symptoms
depend on the nerves involved but may include pain, paresthesia
(pins-and-needles), paresis (weakness), hypoesthesia (numbness),
anesthesia, paralysis, wasting, and disappearance of the
reflexes."<sup><a href="#en49">49</a></sup><a name="ren49" id=
"ren49"></a></p>

<p>In the event, he <i>did</i> set off on 20 September 1921. At the
same time, the world was still turning and the <i>Sydney Morning
Herald</i> was there to tell some of the world's stories. The
newspaper has been published since 1831 and is the oldest
continuously published newspaper in Australia. In 1921 it was
Sydney's premier newspaper&mdash;a broadsheet of from about twelve
to twenty-four pages, selling for twopence.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us it usually provided, on page one, a summary
of events. The edition of 20 September 1921 was no
exception.<sup><a href="#en50">50</a></sup><a name="ren50" id=

<p class="newspaper">In news from Ireland, Edward de Valera and
Lloyd George were organising a conference. De Valera said that it
would be unreasonable to expect the British Government to recognise
the Irish Republic, as a preliminary. In the same way it would be
unreasonable for the British Government to expect Ireland to
surrender her position. If Mr. Lloyd George sought to impose a
preliminary surrender, the conference could not meet.<br>
<br>
The League of Nations Assembly at Geneva discussed international
action against traffic of women and children. The <i>Daily News</i>
correspondent reported that France, for inscrutable reasons,
opposed decisive action on this subject. Mr. Balfour, representing
Britain, demanded that this urgent social evil should be dealt with
without delay. The Australian representative raised the question
whether the League was a body that could or could not do things.
France's attempt to refer the subject back to Individual
Governments was defeated.<br>
<br>
A message from Constantinople stated that the Turkish successes
compelled the Greeks to withdraw from the River Sakaria. The
Greeks, however, denied the withdrawal, and stated that they drove
back the enemy with heavy losses.<br>
<br>
Mr. Smith, manager of the Australian cricketers, stated that the
financial results of the tour exceeded all expectations; while W.
T. Tilden, the world's champion tennis player, defeated W. Johnson
in the American championship at Philadelphia, 6-l, 6-3, 6-1.<br>
<br>
Reports from Mount Mulligan colliery tended to confirm the fears
that practically no hope existed of there being any survivors as a
result of a mine disaster. Of seventy-four men who were in the mine
at the time about twenty bodies had been recovered. The work of
identification was difficult. Rescue work had been impeded
seriously by the poisonous atmosphere encountered by the workers.
Both the tunnel and the air shaft of the mine were wrecked when the
explosion occurred. Nevertheless the rescuers had worked with
splendid heroism ever since the disaster happened.<br>
<br>
During the fiscal year 1920-21, 560 estates, aggregating 462,242
acres, were acquired for closer settlement. Of farms allotted
during that period 884 were to soldiers and fifty-four to
civilians.<br>
<br>
During last season the equivalent of 673,754 sacks of wheat were
delivered at the grain elevators in the State. The cost of the
silos on capital account up to August 17 1921 was £2,172,930.<br>
<br>
The Jubilee Show of the Royal Victorian Agricultural Society opened
in Melbourne on 19 September 1921.<br>
<br>
A statement was made by the Acting-Premier on what was being done
for the unemployed. Up to July 1921, 49,266 persons were sent to
employment, 25,927 being placed on Government works.<br>
<br>
The State Agricultural Chemist spoke before the select committee on
agriculture on the need for a soil survey. These surveys, he
claimed, would be of great advantage in determining the nature of
the soils of the State. They would also be of use in valuing the
soil from the point of view of its productive possibilities.<br>
<br>
Eleven rats believed to be infected with bubonic plague were found
on the steamer <i>Wyreema</i>. The Health authorities said that
although it was not certain, there was little doubt these rats
suffered from plague.<br>
<br>
A settlement of the strike at the Commonwealth Portland Cement
works, Portland, had been effected, all the men having returned to
work, but the Ivanhoe coalminers had not yet returned.<br>

It was stated, by the Minister for Works, that some of the silting
in Newcastle harbour was caused by flood action. A report from
Newcastle stated that the port would probably be declared a port of

<p>Leaving the troubles of the world behind him, Aidan de Brune
left the office of the Sydney <i>Daily Mail</i> on Tuesday 20
September 1921, travelling twelve miles on the first day. He could
not leave his own troubles behind him. His most pressing concern
would have been to find a camping place for the night.</p>

<p>The first entry in the diary is by J. J. Gay, noting that
<i>"bearer left the office of the Daily Mail Sydney at 3.45 p.m. on
Tuesday 20 September 1921."</i></p>

<p>Following this appears de Brune's first entry, as he followed
the railway line, heading north:</p>

<p class="dayhead">20 September 1921. Day 1. 12m. (12m.)</p>

<p><i>Walked out of Sydney and about a mile and a half from Burwood
went on with Jimmy Brand of the Clyde Engineering Co. Thence to
Rhodes, and took track over Parramatta River to Meadowbank. Thence
to Eastwood and Epping where failed to cross railway and got
bushed. Camped out.</i>
</p>

<p>This was not an auspicious start, however the next day he fared
better.</p>

<p class="dayhead">21 September 1921. Day 2. 25m. (37m.)</p>

<p><i>The three roads. On to Hornsby. Arrived Hornsby 10.10 a.m.
Left Hornsby 11 a.m. to Asquith and Mt. Colah (669 ft. above sea
level.) About a mile past station and 100 yards off left side of
road a black disc on stones marking highest point of Mt. Colah.
Thence to Ku-ring-gai (702 ft. above sea level&mdash;a rise of 33
ft. in a mile.) Thence to Berowra (27 miles) and rested. Then on to
Cowan to edge of hill overlooking Hawkesbury River, and camped.
(Note views along hills and from Mt. Colah and summit marks.)</i>
</p>

<p>De Brune had called into the office of the Hornsby <i>Star</i>
newspaper and R. C. Tweedie signed his diary, confirming that the
traveller had arrived at 10.10 a.m. He travelled twenty-five miles
that day and, as he noted, camped overlooking the Hawkesbury
river.</p>

<p>Next day, he walked to Wyong.</p>

<p class="dayhead">22 September 1921. Day 3. 24m. (61m.)</p>

<p><i>At Dawn descended by bad track to Hawkesbury River and walked
across on railway&mdash;beautiful views. Wondabyne half-way over.
Then through tunnel about mile long to Woy Woy (45 miles). About
two miles past, the monument to JACOB CUTTER, MXCXM.<sup><a href=
"#en51">51</a></sup><a name="ren51" id="ren51"></a> Then via
Tascott (4 miles) and Point Clare (5 miles) to Gosford. Arrived
Gosford 2 p.m. (3 miles outside Gosford the sign post moved to a
new road, not necessary.) Thence to Lisarow (great orange show from
here to Gosford.) Thence to Ourimbah and camped out about 2 miles
from Wyong.</i>

<p class="caption">The original railway bridge over the Hawkesbury
River</p>

<p>The original railway bridge over the Hawkesbury River was opened in 1889
<sup><a href="#en52">52</a></sup><a name="ren52" id="ren52"></a> and provided
the final link in a railway network that connected Adelaide, Melbourne,
Sydney and Brisbane. It was a major engineering feat at the time. It had dual
tracks, though initially the line on either end of the bridge was single track.
The line was duplicated in 1906. Severe structural faults developed in the
original bridge and a second bridge was built, which was opened in 1946.</p>

<p>The railway tunnel to Woy Woy was, as de Brune noted, about a mile long and
it, like the bridge, also had provision for two tracks and
thus did not require widening when the line was duplicated in 1906.<sup><a href="#en53">53</a></sup><a name="ren53" id= "ren53"></a>
One wonders what it would have been like to walk through the dark tunnel,
with a train passing.</p>

<p>Wondabyne station, <i>half-way over</i>, as de Brune described
it, has the reputation of having the shortest railway platform in
Australia and of being the only station in Australia without road
access. A pontoon and walkway provides access to the station for
those along the river who have boats.<sup><a href=
"#en54">54</a></sup><a name="ren54" id="ren54"></a></p>

<p>Wondabyne was constructed together with the Hawkesbury River
Railway bridge. Before the bridge opened, and after the Woy Woy
Tunnel was opened, railway passengers took a ferry between
Wondabyne station and Hawkesbury River station, thus enabling them
to complete a journey between Sydney and the New South Wales north
coast.</p>

<p>Wondabyne is a popular starting point for bushwalks into the
surrounding Brisbane Water National Park and the Wondabyne to
Patonga walking track, and also provides access to the Great North
Walk.</p>

<p class="dayhead">23 September 1921. Day 4. 33m. (94m.)</p>

<p><i>Started before dawn. To Wyong, 2 miles. About 3 miles past
Wyong called at farm for drink and well-entertained&mdash;English
people. Then to Catherine Hill Bay, Middle Camp and Main Camp. To
Swansea&mdash;where had only meal of day. Thence to Belmont and
camped.</i>
</p>

<p>So the days passed. De Brune's first goal was to reach the New
South Wales-Queensland border at Wallangarra, by following the
railway line, which generally ran parallel to the Great Northern
Road, now the New England Highway. He walked through Belmont,
Charlestown, Adamstown, Hamilton, Newcastle, West Maitland,
Lochinvar, Greta, Branxton, Whittingham, Singleton, Rixs Creek,
Glennies Creek, Ravensworth, Antiene, Muswellbrook, Aberdeen, Scone
and then on through Willow Tree, Tamworth, Armidale and Glen
Innes.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="p71a" id="p71a"></a><img src=

<p class="caption">Willow Tree station, NSW, in 2018--little has
changed since 1921,<br>
when de Brune walked past. (Colin Choat) House</p>

<p>After a week of walking, on 29 September he noted, <i>on at dawn
to Willow Tree, (girls in motor camping out), 4 miles. Thence
within 4 miles of Wallabadah, and camped at Chris Foster's, owing
to creek flooding</i>. The modern view of the railway line and
station at Willow Tree, with the paddocks in the background, shows
the landscape as it probably appeared as de Brune walked by one
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Should the reader be concerned that this book is comprised of
diary entries, listing the towns visited and the distances
travelled, he need not worry&mdash;that will not be the case.
Certainly, there was not much excitement at the outset, when de
Brune was walking through large towns and villages and nothing was
being reported about his trip. However, this was to change a little
once he was north of Brisbane. It was to change <i>greatly</i>,
after he reached Cairns.</p>

<p>However, it is as well for the reader to get a "feel" for the
rhythm of the walk. Day after day, de Brune woke to face another
day of walking or, where he was ill or needed to rest, of spending
time at a location, often remote. It is also worth noting that some
of the locations through which he passed, no longer exist,
particularly in less populated areas. However, one can always
follow his general path.</p>

<p class="dayhead">6 October 1921. Day 17. 25m. (327m.)</p>

<p>At Bendemeer the walker noted that, in the first 300 miles,
which he reached near Tamworth, he <i>only saw one road-mender at
work. At 42-mile and 43-mile marks, saw two road-menders at work At
31-mile mark, met a traveller going south.</i></p>

<p class="dayhead">11 October 1921. Day 22. 17m. (374m.)</p>

<p>At Black Mountain he saw his first aborigines since starting
out, <i>a gin with 2 children</i>.</p>

<p>In the same way that he called at the farm outside Wyong, so he
adopted the usual practice of the traveller, calling at homesteads,
road camps, fettlers' camps and drovers' camps along the way. He
would be given food and drink and in return would tell of his
experiences during his walk. At times, when one was present, he
would play the piano, at which he was very proficient.</p>

<p>He also told a good story and later, in some of the towns which
he passed through, lectured on events which occurred during his
walk. He was well-regarded by most of those who made comments in
his diary.</p>

<p>At Armidale, the <i>Daily Herald</i> reported:<sup><a href=
"#en55">55</a></sup><a name="ren55" id="ren55"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Mr Aidan de Brune, who left Sydney (NSW) on
September 20 to walk around Australia, arrived at Armidale on
October 8. The weather had not been good, a considerable quantity
of rain being encountered, greatly delaying the traveller. The
country passed through has been magnificent. The constant change of
views through the mountains were equal to any scenery in the world.
The great necessity of the districts traversed so far has been the
lack of population, thousands of acres of most fertile land lying
idle. Mr de Brune arrived at Guyra early on October 12 and left
immediately for Glen Innes (418 miles).</p>

<p class="caption">Meade Street, Glen Innes c. 1925<br>
(State Library of NSW, FL1671891)</p>

<p class="dayhead">15 October 1921. Day 26. 30m. (511m.)</p>

<p>De Brune reached Wallangarra, on the Queensland Border, on 15
October 1921, twenty-five days out from Sydney. He had travelled
492 miles, walking on eighteen days and averaging about
twenty-seven miles a day. On many days the traveller simply
recorded the mileage for the day in his travel diary, together with
his accumulated mileage. Where possible, he included signed
verification, or a comment from someone who was at the place
mentioned. Most of the scribes wished him luck and some tried their
hand at poetry. Many of these notes are peppered throughout this
book.</p>

<p>After a time, when he became well known as a result of articles
in newspapers, and members of the public began to realise that he
had walked a considerable distance, the number of comments in his
diary increased as people sought him out.</p>

<p>Many tramps, or <i>swagmen</i> as they were often called, were
on the road at the time de Brune made his walk. The <i>swag</i>, a
bundle which carried one's personal articles, was a necessary
requirement for all tramps. In the photo of de Brune at the
beginning of this book, we see that his swag consisted of two
bundles, one carried on his back and one slung over his left
shoulder and resting on his chest.</p>

<p>John Le Gay Brereton, a keen walker, described his own swag
thus:<sup><a href="#en56"></a></sup><a name="ren56" id=
"ren56"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">In my swag I carry two extra flannel shirts
and a few pairs of socks, with a piece of American oil-cloth
measuring about six feet by four. In the "nose-bag" are small
"tucker-bags" of tea, sugar, oatmeal, rice, and lentils, and a tin
of mixed pepper and salt. The swag is made by rolling your pair of
blankets into cylindrical shape, with your extra clothes inside.
This bundle is strapped at each end, and the end fastenings are
connected by a "shoulder-strap" which, in my case, is represented
by a rolled towel. The swag is slung from the right shoulder. The
nose-bag containing food is bound to the upper end of the swag, and
hangs in front of the body over the left shoulder. The whole load
when properly adjusted is perfectly balanced and easy to carry.</p>

<p>De Brune would also have carried a water bag and a billy can,
matches, plate, cup, knife, fork and spoon.</p>

<p>In June 1923, when well into his walk, <i>The Guardian,</i> in
Geraldton, Western Australia, reported:<sup><a href=
"#en57">57</a></sup><a name="ren57" id="ren57"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">He is not carrying any surplus flesh, for
humping a swag weighing about fifty pounds, in addition to a water
bag, is not conducive to the putting on of weight. He carried food
in case he did not strike any people, and of course tobacco. On one
occasion he had to live eleven days on rice. "Thirty-four
consecutive meals of rice," he observed, did begin to pall a little
on the taste.<br>
<br>
He also stated that, after walking about 6500 miles, he had
probably worn out six or seven pairs of boots, but when the going
was soft in the sand, he usually slung his boots over his shoulders
and walked barefooted.<br>
<br>
The report went on to say that, everywhere he went he received the
greatest hospitality and kindness, whether at a
station<sup>[iii]</sup> or at a lonely camp. Particularly at the
camps was he welcome, because their visitors were few and far
between, and they were glad to see anyone from the outside
world.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[iii. In Australia, large cattle or sheep
properties are referred to as <i>stations</i>. The reader will
often need to consider the context to determine whether a sheep or
cattle station is being referred to, or a <i>railway</i>
station.]</p>

<p>In reaching Wallangarra, de Brune had generally followed the
Main Northern railway line from Sydney Central. Wallangarra is a
heritage-listed station in the Southern Downs Region of Queensland.
It was built in 1877 along the state border of Queensland and New
South Wales and was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28
March 2003.<sup><a href="#en58">58</a></sup><a name="ren58" id=
"ren58"></a></p>

<p>Until 1930 the station was on the only railway route between
Sydney and Brisbane and had to handle the break-of-gauge where
Queensland Railways' 1067 mm (3ft. 6in.) Southern line met the New
South Wales Government Railways' 1435 mm (4ft. 8½ in.) Main
Northern line. Wallangarra was the terminating point for the Sydney
Mail service, with passengers transferring to the Brisbane Limited
service for the remainder of the journey to Sydney.</p>

<p>In the 19th century, each of the Colonies of Australia had
adopted their own gauges. However, in 1901 when Federation
occurred, trade barriers were removed between states and the
short-sightedness of different gauges became apparent. However, it
would be 1995 before all mainland state capitals were joined by one
standard gauge line.<sup><a href="#en59">59</a></sup><a name=
"ren59" id="ren59"></a></p>

<p>In 1930, the New South Wales North Coast line from Sydney to
Brisbane was completed. As it used only standard gauge for the
entire route, it was a more efficient route than travelling via
Wallangarra. This led to the decline of Wallangarra station which,
however, continued to be served by passenger trains until the
services from Brisbane and Sydney were truncated at Toowoomba and
Tenterfield respectively on 1 February 1972.</p>

<p>At this point, it seems appropriate to mention de Brune's
fondness for following railway lines, wherever possible. A number
of times he mentions, in his diary, "<i>losing the line</i>" and
"<i>finding the line</i>," as he makes his way around the
continent. From the outset, he followed the railway, without a
break, from Sydney's Central Railway Station to Mackay in
Queensland. Then, after a short break in the line where a railway
bridge had not been constructed over the Pioneer River, he picked
up the line again further up the coast at Proserpine. He then
followed it to Cairns and into the North Queensland inland. On and
off, he followed it wherever he could, and if he could not follow
the railway line, he tried to follow the telegraph line.</p>

<p>The steam locomotives which plied the rails, required water to
fill the boiler. The water was heated and converted into steam to
drive the wheels. To this end, bores were sunk in the ground and
windmills were erected to draw the water to the surface, where it
was held in tanks. This infrastructure provided a reliable source
of water for the locomotives, and de Brune made use of it as
well.</p>

<p>Then, too, there was often a track beside the railway line for
maintenance vehicles to travel along and camps where the
maintenance gangs set up a base. De Brune could walk the track and
make contact with the men in the gangs, to obtain food and to get
information about local conditions and the best course to
follow.</p>

<p class="dayhead">16 October 1921. Day 27. 45m. (556m.)</p>

<p>At Warwick, south of Toowoomba, de Brune noted that it was
<i>the only town with baths, so far as I know.</i> The Warwick
Harriers' Swimming Club had control of the Municipal
Baths.<sup><a href="#en60">60</a></sup><a name="ren60" id=
"ren60"></a> Perhaps they were uncommon, but there were other
public baths in the 1920s. For example, the Katoomba Municipal
Baths opened in 1913.<sup><a href="#en61">61</a></sup><a name=
"ren61" id="ren61"></a> Initially there were separate pools for men
and women.</p>

<p>Of course, there were many <i>ocean</i> baths around Sydney. For
example, in the 1890s, club swimming carnivals at the Bondi and
Bronte pools were held.<sup><a href="#en62">62</a></sup><a name=
"ren62" id="ren62"></a></p>

<p class="dayhead">21 October 1921. Day 32. 47m. (658m.)</p>

<p>At Toowoomba, The <i>Chronicle</i> reported:[63]<sup><a href=
"#en63">63</a></sup><a name="ren63" id="ren63"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Yesterday morning Mr de Brune strolled into
the <i>Chronicle</i> office, presented his credentials, had an
interesting few minutes' chat, and proceeded upon his journey to
Brisbane via the Tollbar-road.<br>
<br>
The man who has undertaken this big task is a bright-eyed, tanned,
and wiry individual, whom one would at first glance take for a real
"sundowner."<sup>[iv]</sup> He is a French Canadian, and was
brought up in the Transvaal. His association with the Boers enabled
him to perform good work for the British Army during the last Boer
War. He was only sixteen years of age at the time, and is still on
the right side of forty.<sup>[v]</sup> On the previous day this
intrepid walker had travelled thirty-five miles&mdash;from the
south of Elphinstone to within three miles of Toowoomba, where he
camped for the night, and came into this city early yesterday
morning. The longest stretch he has performed "between sleeps" was
seventy-seven miles, during which period he crossed the
Queensland-New South Wales border.<br>
<br>
As he wanders along his lonely way, he takes notes of all the
localities visited, and converses with people whom he comes across.
It is his intention to write up his long trip when the journey has
been accomplished, and it certainly should make very interesting
reading.<br>
<br>
He has no money on him, except what he earns along the route here
and there at various occupations, principally of a rural character.
He is also of the opinion that if the people of Australia "used
their legs more," instead of riding in trams, trains, and motor
cars, they would become healthier and better citizens, live longer
and be bigger assets to the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>
At the present rate of progress he is well ahead of time, and has
no fears re the result of his long trek. A party of three soldiers
left Sydney a month ahead of him, and he has made a wager of £20
with them that he will reach Cairns before they arrive. He feels
confident of duly collecting the score of notes. Mr de Brune left
this city before 11 o'clock yesterday morning, quite enamoured of
its size and beauty, and continued his journey to the
metropolis.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[v. This is not correct. De Brune was forty-seven years
old, at this time. As has already been noted, he was given to
flights of fancy regarding his personal details. He seems to have
wanted to change his identity from Herbert Charles Cull to Aidan de
Brune and to live another life.]</p>

<p>During the walk, de Brune gave two interviews to
newspapers,<sup><a href="#en64">64</a></sup><a name="ren64" id=
"ren64"></a> which provide a summary of the itinerary for his walk.
These interviews have been split into sections, which are quoted in
<span style=
"font-family: cursive; font: italic .9em 'lucida calligraphy', serif; font-size:.9em">
calligraphy</span> typeface throughout the book, in order to
indicate that the text is part of the interviews.</p>

<p>As we leave Toowoomba, it is appropriate to relate the first
part of de Brune's account, that of his walk from Sydney to
Brisbane, which he reached on 24 October, 1921.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">To leave Sydney on foot, to walk ten
thousand miles (more or less) around Australia, calling at all the
ports en route on the four coasts, and to return to Sydney, was the
task set me on 20th September, 1921.<br>
<br>
It was summer time when I left Sydney. My route lay up the east
coast through Tamworth, Armidale, Glen Innes and Tenterfield to the
Queensland border, some 492 miles. This country is some of the most
fertile in New South Wales and carries a large population.<br>
<br>
Around the Queensland border the orchardist owns sway. Here are
large and magnificent orchards surrounding the go-ahead towns,
where, on market days, one meets prosperous farmers and merchants,
everyone intent on the progress and prosperity of the district and
town.<br>
<br>
The country changed after a while, and I climbed up on the Darling
Downs. Have I entered a new but still prosperous, district? Wheat
and sheep hold this country, and still fine towns were passed.<br>
<br>
Passing through Toowoomba and Maryborough, both big towns with fine
streets and shops, I came to a land new and full of
interest&mdash;the land of the sugar cane.<br>
<br>
Here, huge fields of cane in various stages of growth met the eye.
Tramways were everywhere and led to fine mills. Cane-cutters' camps
dotted the fields, and everywhere was activity. About the mills,
towns had grown up with clubs for the workers and well-equipped
stores.<br>
<br>
Brisbane, the capital city of Queensland, is not a large town for
the size of the state it rules over. But this is the policy of
Queensland. Decentralisation is the rule in the Northern State and,
in consequence, the country is covered with a network of railways
running from one large town to another.</p>

</p>

<p>Harry C. Perry noted that <i>Mr de Brune called at the office of
the Daily Mail, Brisbane, Queensland, today.</i></p>

<p>In the description of his walk in his diary, little space was
given to describing the places through which de Brune walked, or
the people he met along the way. It is much the same in the
articles he wrote for newspapers.</p>

<p>A hundred years on, further description and <i>personal</i>
observations would be extremely interesting to the reader. However,
we must rely on the photographs and news articles of others, to
provide some idea of the places he visited and the people he
met.</p>

<p class="dayhead">5 November 1921. Day 47. 26m. (1013m.)</p>

<p>On Saturday 5 November 1921 de Brune arrived at Miriam Vale,
about thirty miles south of Gladstone, where he completed the first
1000 miles of his journey, having been on the road for forty-six
days. He then walked on to Bororen, Iveragh, Toolooa and
Gladstone.</p>

<p>At Gladstone he called at the <i>Observer</i> Office where his
diary was signed by <i>C. W. MacMillan, editor</i>. His diary entry
also included the words <i>The Impersonation</i> as a reminder of
an incident which occurred at Gladstone.</p>

<p>The Rockhampton <i>Morning Bulletin</i>, of 11 November 1921,
carried the story:<sup><a href="#en65">65</a></sup><a name="ren65"
id="ren65"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">In our issue of Tuesday last there appeared a
paragraph under the heading "Solitary Walk Round Australia," which
set forth that Mr Lar de Bruen, a French Canadian, had arrived at
Rockhampton from Gladstone <i>en route</i> to the north to continue
his long walk from Perth, round Australia, for a wager of £500, no
time being stipulated. Mr Aidan de Brune, whose stories and
sketches in various newspapers over the pen name of "The Amateur
Tramp" are familiar to many, arrived at this office at half past
seven o'clock last night and produced credentials proving that he
is that which he represents himself to be, namely, a genuine
tramper around Australia.<br>
<br>
De Brune told the reporter that nothing of exceptional interest
occurred in the course of his long journey until he arrived on
Monday last at Gladstone, where the coolness of his reception
aroused his curiosity and, in answer to his questions, he learnt
that, on the previous Saturday, a "solitary walker" with a name
that sounded like his, had been received in mistake for him and
treated right royally. "I do not need monetary help on my journey,"
said Mr de Brune, "since I live comfortably, so for as money is
concerned, on the income I earn from my writings."<br>
<br>
Mr de Brune resumed his journey north at a-quarter-past eight
o'clock last night. He expected to reach Kawana, about ten miles
out of Rockhampton, before camping.</p>

<p><i>The Impersonator</i> was actually a traveller known as "Micky
the Sailor" whom de Brune mentioned in a column, published in the
<i>Daily Mail:</i><sup><a href="#en66">66</a></sup><a name="ren66"
id="ren66"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Here I should mention "Micky the Sailor," with
whom there is no hobo in the same class, from Adelaide to Brisbane.
He will work successfully every house in town or country, and his
tucker bag is a mine of good things. I came across him outside
Uralla. I had not heard the last of him, however. North of Brisbane
I began to get news of him. No one appeared to know where he came
from or what were his credentials.</p>

<p class="dayhead">11 November 1921. Day 53. 26m. (1137m.)</p>

<p>At Rockhampton, after travelling 1100 miles, de Brune noted that
he was experiencing <i>bad feet</i>. It would be the beginning of
ongoing problems with this part of his body.</p>

<p>The locations visited by de Brune, in making his way north from
Gladstone via Rockhampton to Mackay, sound like place names chanted
by a person singing the song <i>I've Been
Everywhere:</i><sup>[vi]</sup> Pyealy, Yarwun, Ambrose, Lorne
Siding, Epala, Raglan, Toonda, Marmor, Bajool, Ardur, Midgee,
Gavial, Rockhampton, Parkhurst, Etna Creek, The Caves, Yamba,
Canoona, Marlborough, Kooltandra, Styx, Wumalgi, Kalarka, Yukolgy,
Carmila, Ilbilbie, Karremal, Koumala, Loloma, Yukan, Sarina,
Mackay.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[vi. <i>I've Been Everywhere:</i> A song
written by Australian singer Geoff Mack in 1959, and made popular
by Lucky Starr in 1962. The song, as originally written, recited
the names of Australian towns.]</p>

<p>These names are mentioned to remind the reader that every day de
Brune walked another twenty or thirty miles. It is difficult to
imagine what an amazing feat this was. We shall soon come to some
of the problems he encountered during the walk and witness what
courage and tenacity were required by him to stick to the task.</p>

<p>The list of names also serves to remind us that, before European
settlement of Australia, the aborigines populated the entire
continent. Naturally, they had names for all the various locations
and landforms in their "country." Australia certainly has many
Aboriginal place names, bestowed by the early Europeans, but it is
interesting to note that, in 1788, the year that the Europeans made
the first settlement in Australia, the aboriginal name
<i>Parramatta</i>, was given to what is now the oldest inland
European settlement in Australia and the economic capital of
Greater Western Sydney.<sup><a href="#en67">67</a></sup><a name=
"ren67" id="ren67"></a> The Europeans began using aboriginal names
<i>very</i> early on.</p>

<p class="dayhead">20 November 1921. Day 62. 18m. (1323m.)</p>

<p>To reach Mackay from Gladstone, de Brune walked by day and
camped by night, a total of 270 miles in two weeks. He had covered
1323 miles, (2100 kilometres) in the two months since he had left
Sydney and, in reaching Mackay, he had crossed the Tropic of
Capricorn. Perhaps he had begun to realise that he would not fulfil
his intention to walk the entire 10,000 miles in twelve months.
Perhaps he always believed that he would not be able to do it. Ten
thousand miles in one year had a nice ring to it, and de Brune
could certainly turn a phrase.</p>

<p>The railway ended at Mackay.<sup><a href=
"#en68">68</a></sup><a name="ren68" id="ren68"></a> In 1922, the
year after de Brune passed through, work to take it over the
Pioneer River was recommenced, after a delay of some years. At the
same time it was being extended from Proserpine, north of Mackay,
down towards Mackay. The connection was finally made in December
1923 and the days of travelling to coastal cities by steamer
finally came to an end. There was an unbroken railway line from
Brisbane to Cairns.</p>

<p>Other than not being able to follow the line, the railway
mattered not to de Brune&mdash;he was walking. However, he did note
that <i>f</i><i>rom now, only road miles from large towns to large
towns can be given. Railway ends</i>. He could not use railway
mileage indicators to calculate the distance he walked each day. As
usual, on he walked, until he picked up the line again at
Proserpine on 26 November 1921.</p>

<p class="newspaper">THE AMATEUR TRAMP<br>
<br>
The term forming the above heading has been adopted by Aidan de
Brune, who has just passed through Cairns in the course of a tour
round Australia. Burnt almost black with the sun and presenting a
lean figure with a considerable growth on his face, de Brune cuts
anything but an amateurish appearance. He called into this office,
bearing a letter from the editor of the Daily Mail, Sydney, dated
20th September, 1921, and stating; that the bearer was starting on
a walk round Australia, also wishing him success.<br>
<br>
Three months have so far been spent on the way, and according to de
Brune's reckoning he is a few days overdue. He says this is due to
bad travelling, particularly during the last stages, from
Townsville to Cairns. During this part of the journey, hot and wet
weather conditions were encountered. Favourable conditions,
however, had prevailed throughout the greater part of the journey,
especially. in South Queensland. The tourist intended spending a
few days in Cairns, but owing to his late arrival, decided to push
on.<br>
<br>
He is gathering matter on the way, which he intends using in
journalistic work later on. By contributing to the <i>Daily
Mail</i>, Sydney, as he goes along, de Brune is enabled to
independently carry on. Kuranda was the first port of call after
leaving Cairns, for which place the traveller left in high
spirits.</p>

<p>A less benign report was published by the <i>Northern
Miner.</i><sup><a href="#en70">70</a></sup><a name="ren70" id=
"ren70"></a> It contained a prescient warning of the conditions
which the walker would face in his trek across the Gulf Country. De
Brune, himself, had noted the hot and wet weather conditions
encountered since leaving Townsville, but probably had no idea of
what lay ahead.<br></p>

<p class="newspaper">Another of those pedestrians who are out for
notoriety for trying to do something which no one else has done, in
the person of a man named Aidan de Brune, turned up in Cairns
yesterday, come on the hoof overland from Townsville. His object is
to do a walking stunt around Australia, but what good this will do
to anyone, I am at a loss to understand.<br>
<br>
After a short stay in Cairns he again left on his long journey
intending to travel via Georgetown. I am afraid at this time of the
year, when the wet season is on, he will find out walking in the
Gulf Country is no child's play and that his timetable will be
considerably out of joint by the time he reaches Burketown. When he
arranged his trip I don't think he took into consideration the
weather prevailing in North Queensland from December to April.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<h2><a name="ch5.3" id="ch5.3"></a>Through the Gulf Country</h2>

<p>One must question de Brune's decision to begin his walk at the
end of September. It seems that, from far away Sydney, he was not
aware of climatic conditions in the tropics in the wet season,
which ran from December to April. He would soon find out that
walking in the Gulf Country in the wet season was, indeed, <i>no
child's play!</i></p>

<p class="dayhead">21 December 1921. Day 93. NR. (1830m.)</p>

<p>On 20 December 1921 the walker had passed through Cairns and
tramped on to Edgehill, noting that there had been <i>rain all
day.</i> It was an ominous warning.</p>

<p>Next day it was <i>on to Stratford. Rain hard all day. To
Freshwater. To Redlynch. (Over the pad). To Jungara. (13 tunnels in

<p>The next day, Christmas day, and on succeeding days, he
continued to be held up by rain. The wet season had begun. No
mention is made of what he did on Christmas Day, 1921, but next day
he noted that he walked <i>o</i><i>n to Dimbulah, 27 miles. Stayed

<p class="calligraphy">Through Rockhampton, Mackay and Townsville I
walked, ever north, until I came to Cairns, the end of my first

My route lay along the famous Barron Valley, with its magnificent
waterfall, to Mareeba. There I turned towards Almaden and again to
Forsayth.</p>

<p>The Etheridge Railway line branches off the Mareeba-to-Chillagoe
railway at Almaden and heads south for 142 miles to Forsayth via
Mt. Surprise and Einasleigh. The line was built to supply ore to
the Chillagoe Company's under-utilised Chillagoe ore

<p>From Mt. Surprise de Brune followed the line through Einasleigh
and walked on to Forsayth, where the railway ended. He then turned
north and walked the 25 miles to Georgetown.</p>

<p class="dayhead">7 January 1922. Day 110. 25m. (2136m.).</p>

<p class="calligraphy">Over the ridge to Georgetown was the next
stretch of country. Here were no railways, but the roads were good.
As a mining town, Georgetown is almost dead. Houses have been
pulled down and abandoned. One queer thing I noted. Georgetown at
one time had a local newspaper, but with the downfall of mining the
paper lapsed and, when I visited Georgetown, the printing press was
standing out in the street.</p>

<p>Then de Brune walked the 85 miles through Crooked Creek and
Gilbert River to Croydon, where the railway began again.</p>

<p class="dayhead">13 January 1922. Day 116. NR. (2206m.)</p>

<p class="calligraphy">On to Croydon, another mining town, with,
alas, the few mines operating in the hands of tributers and half
the town dismantled. Here I again found a railway and followed it
to Normanton, a small port on the Gulf of Carpentaria. Normanton
was once a big town exporting an immense quantity of gold, won at
the Croydon gold mines.</p>

<p>A few days later he passed through Blackbull. Today, this siding
is significant only in that the tank and waiting-shed were still

progress; all along seeking food and shelter where he could; and
all along contending with the tropical rain. He had travelled 510

Queensland town I was to visit.</p>

<p class="dayhead">31 January 1922. Day 134. NR. (2518m.)</p>

<p>De Brune left Normanton, and the railway, on 24 January 1922 and
walked to Burketown, a distance of 180 miles. He arrived at
Burketown on 31 January 1922, at which point he had walked 2500
miles and had been away from Sydney for nearly five months. From
Normanton to Burketown had been the toughest section so far.</p>

<p>A glance at the map shows that Normanton is on the Norman river.
To the North is the Mutton Hole Wetlands Conservation Park which is
bounded on the west by the Norman River and on the east by Wills
Creek, an offshoot of the Norman. In January the area would have
been <i>very</i> wet.</p>

<p>From Normanton the traveller walked to Magowra Station and then
on to Inverleigh, on what is now known as the Burke Development
Road. In doing so, he crossed the Bynoe and Flinders Rivers. At the
point where de Brune crossed, the Bynoe has two streams. He
referred to them as the Big Bynoe River and Little Bynoe River.</p>

<p>On 25 January, before reaching Inverleigh he noted that he was
<i>detained by rains</i>. From Inverleigh he walked to Wernadinga
Station, then to Yarruna and then on to Burketown. He went directly
into the hospital, lucky to have ended up at a place <i>with</i> a
hospital, being in such a sparsely populated area of Australia. He
remained in hospital for <i>seven weeks</i>. The wet had taken its
toll.</p>

<p>Burketown was named after Robert O'Hara Burke and Wills Creek,
in the same vicinity, was named after William John Wills. The men
were the leader and the second-in-command of the first expedition
to cross Australia from south to north. They found a route across
the continent from the settled areas of Victoria to the Gulf of
Carpentaria.</p>

<p>Burke and Wills camped at their "Camp 119," on the Bynoe River,
in early February 1861. De Brune must have passed close by their
campsite when there in late January 1922, exactly sixty-one years
later.</p>

<p>On the Burke and Wills expedition, Wills kept a series of Field
Books. Field Book 9 included activity at Camp 119, and described
the weather.<sup><a href="#en73">73</a></sup><a name="ren73" id=
"ren73"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Finding the ground in such a state from the
heavy falls of rain, that camels could scarcely be got along, it
was decided to leave them at Camp 119, and for Mr Burke and I to
proceed towards the sea on foot. After breakfast we accordingly
started, taking with us the horse and three days' provisions. Our
first difficulty was in crossing Billy's Creek, which we had to do
where it enters the river, a few hundred yards below the camp. In
getting the horse in here, he got bogged in a quicksand bank so
deeply as to be unable to stir, and we only succeeded in
extricating him by undermining him on the creek's side, and then
lugging him into the water.<br>
<br>
Having got all the things in safety, we continued down the river
bank, which bent about from east to west, but kept a general north
course. A great deal of the land was so soft and rotten that the
horse, with only a saddle and about twenty-five pounds on his back,
could scarcely walk over it. At a distance of about five miles we
again had him bogged in crossing a small creek, after which he
seemed so weak that we had great doubts about getting him on.<br>
<br>
We, however, found some better ground close to the water's edge,
where the sandstone rock crops out, and we stuck to it as far as
possible. Finding that the river was bending about so much that we
were making very little progress in a northerly direction, we
struck off due north and soon came on some tableland, where the
soil is shallow and gravelly, and clothed with box and swamp gums.
Patches of the land were very boggy, but the main portion was sound
enough; beyond this we came on an open plain, covered with water up
to one's ankles.<br>
<br>
The soil here was a stiff clay, and the surface very uneven, so
that between the tufts of grass one was frequently knee deep in
water. The bottom, however, was sound and no fear of bogging. After
floundering through this for several miles, we came to a path
formed by the blacks, and there were distinct signs of a recent
migration in a southerly direction. By making use of this path we
got on much better, for the ground was well trodden and hard. At
rather more than a mile, the path entered a forest through which
flowed a nice watercourse, and we had not gone far before we found
places where the blacks had been camping.</p>

<p>The delay caused by the rain must certainly have contributed to
the time taken by Burke, Wills and King, another member of the
party, to get back to their camp at Cooper Creek. Gray, a fourth
member of the party, died on the way back. Burke had asked the
depot party to remain at the camp on the Cooper for thirteen weeks.
The party had actually waited for eighteen weeks and was running
low on supplies and starting to feel the effects of scurvy. They
had come to believe that Burke would never return from the gulf and
decided to return to Menindee.</p>

<p>Both Burke and Wills died at Cooper Creek, having reached the
camp only hours after the depot party had left. The story of their
triumph in crossing the continent, and their tragedy, ensured that
the pair would be remembered as two of Australia's most famous
explorers.</p>

<p>On 16 February 1922, while de Brune was in the Burketown
Hospital, John W. Tarlington MOA[x] wrote in the diary, <i>Arma
virumque cano</i>, the opening phrase of Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i>.
The first six of the <i>Aeneid's</i> twelve books tell the story of
Aeneas's wanderings from Troy to Italy.<sup><a href=

<p>Chris Rowson offers a translation of the phrase: "This is the
story of a man and his struggle."<sup><a href=
"#en75">75</a></sup><a name="ren75" id="ren75"></a> This
translation is certainly appropriate to de Brune's situation, where
he had already been laid up in Burketown Hospital for two weeks,
and would be there for another five weeks, with another 7500 miles
to walk to complete his journey. The MOA had certainly read his man
correctly.</p>

<p>Later, when he reached Darwin, the <i>Northern Territory Times
and Gazette</i> reported:<sup><a href="#en76">76</a></sup><a name=
"ren76" id="ren76"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">The wet season had started two days before Mr
de Brune's arrival at Cairns, and he was never dry for six weeks
until Burketown was reached. He was seven weeks in the Burketown
Hospital. The last fifty miles of the stage from Wernadinga Station
towards Burketown was walked in almost continuous rain, non-stop,
in twenty-nine hours, over black soil marsh lands, at times up to
his knees in water.</p>

<p class="dayhead">24 February 1922. Day 158. 0m. (2518m.)</p>

<p>The invalid left the hospital, walked four miles and camped.
Next day he walked a further six miles. Then he walked back to the
hospital. He remained there until 22 March 1922.</p>

<p class="dayhead">22 March 1922. Day 158. NR. (2518m.)</p>

<p><i>Left hospital at 9 a.m. and Burketown at 9:30 a.m. Took lower
road, 2 miles out of town, saving some miles. Met a Mr King carting
down to Camooweal way. About 11 [a.m.] went to Albert River and
camped until about 4 p.m. Very hot. I am very soft and heat beats
me. Feet poor. About sunset caught up to Booth and had cup of tea.
Then, on to the pool (1 mile) and by Punjaub swamp, to the Hut,
arriving there about midnight. Camped on verandah.</i>
</p>

<p class="dayhead">23 March 1922. Day 185. NR. (2518m.)</p>

<p><i>Found Shackleton [was] away from hut. (A traveller there, old
man, very shaky.) Ate nothing yesterday and a slice of bread for
this breakfast. Then, on to the ruins at Brookdale Hotel and onto
the Punjaub Road. About 11, heat overwhelming and went across
paddock to water. About 8 miles out. Then on through night to try
to reach Punjaub. Mosquitoes very bad last night and today. Arrived
at rabbit-proof gate about midnight and camped.</i>
</p>

<p class="dayhead">24 March 1922. Day 186. NR. (2518m.)</p>

<p><i>Crossed 12-mile creek and on to Punjaub fence and over swamp.
Heat, flies and mosquitoes very bad. Touch of fever and feet very
painful.</i>
</p>

<p>On 25 March De Brune found the morning to be very hot. <i>Flies
very bad. Feet very poor. Arrived Punjaub Station about
noon.</i></p>

<p>On 26 and 27 March he rested at Punjaub.</p>

<p class="dayhead">28 March 1922. Day 190. NR. (2563m.)</p>

<p><i>Left Punjaub early. Road very bad. Took 60-mile road as
believed better watered. Road very cut up. Black Soil. Walk at
night in bush (experiment). Found water in morning to westward.
Very hot, no wind, mosquitos and flies bad.</i>
</p>

<p class="dayhead">29 March 1922. Day 191. NR. (2563m.)</p>

<p><i>Road improved after first ten miles from Punjaub and fair pad
along. Found Lawn Hill Creek, a nice running stream. Country fairly
well wooded but little black soil. Saw no one. Plenty water. Creek
close by and swamps. Mosquitos terrific at camp and flies bad. Very
hot. Feet improving.</i>
</p>

<p>Later:</p>

<p><i>Mosquitos bad. Feet much better. Country better wooded and
water abundant. Very hot day. Did a fair distance. Saw no one. Very
little stock.</i>
</p>

<p>30 March 1922:</p>

<p><i>Cooler morning. Road not so good. Much bush and good red
soil. Hills on each side of distance. Camped midday by double
pools. Very hot. On to boundary rider's hut, 18 miles from Lawn
Hill Station.</i>
</p>

<p>31 March 1922:</p>

<p><i>Left early. Low hills on each side. Fair going. Not so warm.
Red and black soil mixed. Plenty water. Bush bigger and trees
larger. Lawn Hill Station.</i>
</p>

<p>During this time, since leaving Burketown, he walked only 45
miles in 8 days. Then, for five weeks, from 1 April 1922, to 7 May
1922, he was laid up at Lawn Hill Station with a series of
abscesses on his feet, too ill to travel. Oh, those wretched
feet!</p>

<p class="dayhead">12 May 1922. Day 235. NR. (2623m.)</p>

<p>Finally, after five weeks, the traveller walked on again, to
Lilydale Springs. He noted in the diary that two pages were missing
from the diary, <i>being records of the period while laid up at
Lawn Hill Station, and covering the 28 miles from Lawn Hill Station
to Lilydale Springs boundary riders hut.</i></p>

<p>The only certification in the diary, for this time, is a
statement that de Brune <i>arrived Lawn Hill Station. (Signed) W.
Stewart, manager. 31/3/22.</i></p>

<p>It was a remarkable feat, among many remarkable feats, that for
his entire walk he was able to protect the diary from the wet
weather and during the crossing of rivers and creeks.</p>

<p class="dayhead">19 May 1922. Day 242. 10m. (2710m.)</p>

<p>From Lilydale Springs, the tramp walked on to Herbertvale
Station, rested for a day, and then walked ten miles to the pumping
station at the rabbit-proof fence, on the Queensland-Northern
Territory border.</p>

<p class="dayhead">20 May 1922. Day 243. 11m. (2721m.)</p>

<p>He then walked to Gallipoli Station, in the Northern Territory.
He had travelled 2721 miles since leaving Sydney and had walked for
145 of the 243 days which had elapsed since the beginning of his
walk.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">Two hundreds of miles westward from
Burketown I began to climb on to the Barkly Tableland. Lawn Hill
Station was the last place I passed in Queensland, and then I came
to Herbertvale Station on the Queensland-Northern Territory
border.[xi]</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xi. De Brune actually came to Gallipoli
Station, on the border. Herbertvale Station is in Queensland and he
reached it on 17 May 1922, three days before he reached Gallipoli

<p>Aidan de Brune had weathered Northern Australia's wet season!
The prediction of the journalist in Cairns that, during the wet
season, walking in the Gulf Country was no child's play, had been
prophetic.</p>

<p>In 1877 the overlanders, Nathaniel Buchanan and Sam Croker,
crossed the Barkly Tableland and rode on to the Overland Telegraph
Line, opening new land for settlement. With the introduction of
generous leasing arrangements on the Barkly some years later, the
region became more settled.</p>

<p>In 1883, Harry Readford, one of the inspirations for the
literary character Captain Starlight, drove a mob of cattle to the
Barkly and subsequently established Brunette Downs (then called
Corella Creek), with outstations at Anthony Lagoon and Cresswell
Creek, for Macdonald, Smith and Co. In 1884, 2500 cattle were
driven to Brunette Downs and in 1885, Readford brought in 1200
mixed cattle from Burketown.<sup><a href=

<p class="calligraphy">I saluted my first Territorian at Gallipoli,
a sub-station of the huge Alexandra Station, containing some 14,000
square miles of country.<br>
<br>
I had travelled over 200 miles from the last Queensland town[xii]
and for some three or four hundred miles I was still to wander
without sight of more than an isolated station. It was pure
pastoral land and some of the finest grazing country I had seen in
the whole of Australia. It was land that gave a promise of a big
future for the coming State, and it was land that would have to be
developed and conserved to get the best out of it. The pity was
that over these many hundreds of miles very little development work
had been accomplished in spite of the fact that the stations hereon
had been in existence for many years.<br>
<br>
A country of plains. For miles I walked across plains of the finest
Mitchell and Flinders grasses. At times I came across clumps of
gidyea thickets, with coolabah trees in isolated series resembling
scouts advancing before an army. Water was scarce, but there were
innumerable creek beds that, with proper damming and clearing,
should hold water from one rainy season to the next.<br>
<br>
Cattle and horses were met in bunches around the few water holes
and, with the extension of the water, the country should carry many
times the present number of stock.</p>

<p class="dayhead">21 May 1922. Day 244. 14m. (2735m.)</p>

<p>From Gallipoli the walker travelled from bore to
bore&mdash;number 21; number 20; Lulu Waters (Lulu Waterhole); Golden Waters; Dead
Man's Hole, near where he <i>met Mr Holt in motor car</i>; Belyabba
Crossing (or Waterhole), on Buchanan Creek, where he met Mr Cannington; number 3;
number 4; Alexandria Station. Then on, across plains of fine grass,
to Brunette Downs&mdash;150 miles from Gallipoli Station.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">The Barkly Tablelands I consider some of the
finest grazing lands in Australia. On them I have travelled plains
20 to 30 miles across and never anything but grass. Miles and miles
of it, some of the finest grazing in Australia. One wonders if
these plains have an ending. Then a dark line appears on the
horizon. Later it resolves into a belt of gidyea (gidgee) trees,
with coolabah trees standing before it. These belts of trees are
never more than a few hundred yards across. And then out on to
another plain, appearing almost illimitable in extent.<br>
<br>
Overhead, a fierce tropical sun beats down on this shadeless plain
and, throughout the day, dances the mirage.<br>
<br>
Scenes of water, vast lakes, with villages, stations and people,
the mirage dances the whole day long. How many men have seen these
beautiful illusions and taken them for realities? How many men have
wandered from the track and finally laid down under some tree to
face the inevitable end? One has to set one's face sternly to the
one path and disregard the tempting vision.</p>

<p class="dayhead">05 June 1922. Day 259. 14m. (2930m.)</p>

<p>After nearly 3000 miles the tramp reached Anthony Lagoon.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">The first town I struck in the Territory was
Anthony Lagoon&mdash;a police station, a store and an out-station
of the Brunette Cattle Station. When I arrived there I found
drovers Conway and McClennan (the latter we know as the Scotsman of
Mrs Gunn's book, "We of the Never Never"[xiii]) held in quarantine.
The cattle had been dipped and had immediately wandered into the
lagoon, the water of which was the sole drinking water of the
place. Just imagine what state the water was in after some 3000
cattle had bathed in it after being dipped. Condy's crystals had no
effect on the water nor any other clearing substance. A bore had
been put down by the Brunette people, but no mill erected and
consequently it was useless.<br>
<br>
(More walking) brought me to the edge of the tableland and
Newcastle Waters. Crossing late at night, I reached the station,
content to have passed over one of the most perilous zones of my
journey. This country did not contain a single head of stock.
Natural water was scarce. It was a lonely trail, broken only by
arrival at Mr Peacock's construction camp&mdash;[his party was]
erecting the windmills, bores, and earth tanks, for the stock
route.</p>

<p class="dayhead">8 June 1922. Day 262. 21m. (2969m.)</p>

<p>At sundown on 8 June 1922, the tired, solitary traveller arrived
at Peacock's camp at No. 2 Bore, 250 miles and nineteen days from
Gallipoli Station. Syd Peacock verified the fact in de Brune's
diary and noted that de Brune was <i>looking tired, and well worthy
of a good rest.</i> De Brune stayed with the Peacocks for a few
days. Then he walked again and, on 17 June 1922, he met P. H.
Peacock at No. 8 Bore, and again rested for a few days.</p>

<p class="dayhead">20 June 1922. Day 274. 18m. (3119m.)</p>

<p>The traveller arrived at Newcastle Waters on 20 June 1922, where
he was laid up for two weeks <i>with bad feet and lumbago.</i></p>

<p>Newcastle Waters is situated on what is now the Stuart Highway,
running from Port Augusta to Darwin. It boasted a Telegraph
Station, on the telegraph line running from Adelaide to Darwin. De
Brune, having been without a railway for some time, now followed
the telegraph line, on and off, to Darwin.</p>

<p>Later, when at Yardea, SA, he was to recall "Gretchen," whom he
met at Newcastle Waters:<sup><a href="#en78">78</a></sup><a name=
"ren78" id="ren78"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">We named him "Gretchen" because of his fair
girl-like skin. He had walked up from Adelaide, carrying his swag.
He said he was seventeen years old, and a Swede. Certainly he was a
foreigner, for his "Australianese" was something to wonder at. His
manners were curiously refined, and girlish&mdash;in fact at
Newcastle Waters Station he was unanimously voted a girl, and a
pretty one too. His bush lore was vile, and he seemed incapable of
boiling a billy. But he had walked on the [telegraph] line from
Adelaide and appeared to think nothing of it. I dare say a good
many people at Darwin will remember "Gretchen." He hung about for a
few days and then got on a steamer for Java. The quaint part of the
incident is that "Gretchen" appeared to think nothing of his long
walk.</p>

<p class="dayhead">6 July 1922. Day 290. 13m. (3132m.)</p>

<p>De Brune left the Telegraph Station at Newcastle Waters on 6
July 1922, following the line. He passed through Frews Ponds and, a
few days later, camped 200 yards short of a bore, not seeing it in
the dark.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">On this track, just outside Newcastle
Waters, I passed the Adelaide motor party. They did not
stop&mdash;a certain sign, in the bush, of city people. Out in the
Never Never no man passes another without exchanging news. In fact
if one is camped and sees a traveller approaching, the billy is set
to boil and the tucker bag opened.</p>

<p>The "Adelaide motor party" was made up of three members of the
Commonwealth Government Public Works Committee. They were
investigating a proposal to construct two further sections of the
railway line between Adelaide and Darwin&mdash;from Oodnadatta to
Alice Springs (297 miles) and from Katherine to Daly Waters (149
miles).<sup><a href="#en79">79</a></sup><a name="ren79" id=

<p class="caption">Bond Springs Station homestead, about 14 miles

<p>De Brune was a strident proponent of the idea of extending
railways in the North, to aid its development. As it happened, it
was not until February 2004 that freight and passenger trains began
travelling along the entire route between Adelaide and
Darwin.<sup><a href="#en80">80</a></sup><a name="ren80" id=

<p class="calligraphy">From Newcastle Waters the country changed.
The bush became more frequent and at times I passed dense thickets.
The soil was good but had not been worked. In fact from Newcastle
Waters to Daly Waters Telegraph Station, a matter of between 80 and
100 miles there is no sign of habitation.<br>
<br>
At Frew Ponds, some thirty-five miles, north of Newcastle Waters I
met Mr Percy Money, the Director of Works for the Northern
Territory. We camped down for a while and exchanged news. Mr Money
was motoring down to Anthony Lagoon, then to Tennant Creek and then
down the Murranji Track. Some journey that! Later, at Daly Waters,
I met Mr Urquhart, the Administrator, and had a long chat with him
that lasted well into the night. The future of the Territory was
thoroughly discussed and Mr Urquhart took notes of many things I
had seen in the course of mv journey that required attention. I
found him a very reasonable man and a pleasant companion for a
social evening&mdash;well read, and with a good knowledge of the
world, men and manners.</p>

<p class="dayhead">8 July 1922. Day 292. 18m. (3171m.)</p>

<p><i>On to Mill Bore No. 6. Met Director of Works, N.T., 6 miles

</p>

<p><i>Frew Ponds to No 6 (Milner), 18 miles. To No 5 (McGowry), 18

miles. To Katherine, 38 miles. Total, 234 miles.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Came down Jump-up and across 3 miles. Black soil plain.
Camped about 200 yards south of bore, not seeing it in dark.</i>
</p>

<p>Interestingly, a photo of the area of the Jump-up, taken in
1923, exists. It is difficult to imagine a lone traveller
<i>walking</i> through <i>that</i> country.</p>

<p>The tramp arrived at Daly Waters Telegraph Station on 10 July
1922 and remained there for three days. He then set off again on 14
July 1922, walking from bore to bore, noting that <i>three out of
seven mills on this route were broken or useless.</i> The windmills
pumped the water from the bores. If they were not working, the
tanks beside the bores were not being filled. Next day he <i>met a
donkey team.</i></p>

<p>On 18 July the diary records a walk of 27 miles, or 40
kilometres, to Warlock Ponds. It may not seem a long way, when one
reads it without thinking. It is as well to remind oneself, as one
scans the diary, that one's eyes are covering hundreds, then
thousands of miles, all walked, day upon day.</p>

<p>At Warlock Ponds, he <i>met 2 donkey teams and also man with
packs</i>. Even in remote places there was <i>some</i> activity
occurring.</p>

<p>H. Gill, a mail contractor from Katherine, noted that he <i>met
Mr A. de Brune on overland telegraph line and we had lunch together
at post No. 2020, about 20 miles from Warlock Ponds.</i></p>

<p class="cp"><img src="1901261h-images/Landlopers-17.jpg" alt="" title=""

</p>

<p>Next day de Brune walked to Mataranka Station, and on to the old
Elsie Downs Station. "Mataranka" and "Elsie Downs" featured in
<i>We of the Never Never</i>, which was mentioned earlier, in
connection with the incident of the drovers polluting the water at
Anthony Lagoon.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">I arrived at Mataranka Station&mdash;the
stock station run by the Commonwealth. Here I had an interview with
Mr Morrice, the manager, who answered my questions freely and was
anxious that I should be fully informed of all activities of the
station. Along this route I met team after team of donkey wagons
drawing supplies and material for the bores being placed on the
Murranji track.<br>
<br>
From now on I passed through more settled country. At Maranboy I
visited the Inland Mission Hospital and was much interested in the
work of the mission and the nurses who work so far from the
comforts of civilisation.</p>

<p class="dayhead">23 July 1922. Day 307. 0m. (3367m.)</p>

<p>Maranboy was the second town which de Brune came to in the
Northern Territory, after Anthony Lagoon. He remained there for a
day. L. W. Dunlop, the matron, and J. Gray, a sister, of the Inland
Mission Hospital, signed the diary.</p>

<p>Then he was on the road again, crossing the Roper River and
walking towards Katherine. Twelve miles before Katherine, with its
Telegraph Station and railhead, he camped at Bullock Head with D.
Sergeant, the Katherine-Maranboy mailman.</p>

<p>Camping out would entail making a fire to boil the billy and
heat some food. The swags would be unrolled and the groundsheet
laid out. The eating utensils, cup, plate and fork would be set
aside. The fire also provided light in the night and, when in
cooler areas, warmth.</p>

<p>There would be conversation about the road being followed and
the distances to other locations, and talk of past experiences and
whatever else came to mind. Then the travellers would lie on their
groundsheet and, if the night were clear, could stare into the
clear, dark sky, filled with countless stars. If it were raining,
that would, of course, be an entirely different matter.</p>

<p class="dayhead">25 July 1922. Day 309. 20m. (3399m.)</p>

<p class="calligraphy">Thence to Katherine. Here I struck a railway
after over 1000 miles [and six months] of travelling. The land
along the line is excellent, and tobacco, rice, cotton, and all
tropical vegetation grows well on this soil. At Bachelor Farm, some
time ago, tobacco was grown that sold in Europe for over 10/- a
pound. The pity is that so good a start was not sustained.</p>

<p>De Brune became interested in the development of the Northern
Territory and spoke and wrote on this subject on many occasions
after he reached Darwin on 10 August 1922. Some of the issues being
raised by him are still being raised today.</p>

<p>Interestingly, in 2018, there is still a lament about the
Northern Territory not reaching its potential as a possible "food
bowl" for Asia. In an article on the ABC[xiv] internet site titled
"Why doesn't the tropical north produce more agriculturally?" the
many reasons contributing to this perceived under-production were
canvassed:<sup><a href="#en81">81</a></sup><a name="ren81" id=

<p class="footnote1">[xiv. ABC: Australian Broadcasting
Corporation. http://www.abc.net.au.]</p>

<ul>
<li>Developing the difficult terrain of northern Australia takes
time, and is expensive to do.</li>

<li>Many things can be grown in the north, but Australia has high
labour costs which reduce its competitiveness.</li>

<li>Land tenure is a problem because of the existence of pastoral
leases which cannot be subdivided and which are affected by native
title.</li>

<li>Northern Australia is only represented by ten seats in the
Federal House of Representatives. Urban voters influence what
happens in the north. That affects everything from live cattle
exports, tree clearing, funding allocation for infrastructure,
roads and tourism, and Aboriginal communities</li>

<li>Access to markets and getting produce out year-round would be
required if the north were going to be more than a "dry season"
industry.</li>

<li>Geographic isolation comes at a cost. There a relatively small
local population and freight costs to ship goods to distant markets
is high. Further, the cost to bring goods into the north is
expensive.</li>

<li>Dryland agriculture&mdash;growing crops without
irrigation&mdash;has been tried many times and, while there might
be high rainfall, it is too unreliable in its timing and amount to
rely on.</li>

<li>Regarding the idea of the "food bowl of Asia," even if the
north produced its maximum potential, it would still only produce a
relatively small amount of food by world standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Four miles past Katherine township de Brune came to the most
northern railway in Australia&mdash;the section of the future
north-south railway from Emungalan to Darwin.</p>

<p>Often there was not a mile <i>post</i> or <i>stone</i> or
<i>mark</i> to indicate distance, but some infrastructure which was
located at a certain distance from a known point. Hence the 2½-mile
loco-shops on day 324 were 2½ miles from Darwin. Sometimes de Brune
simply wrote, for example, <i>at 7-mile</i>. The word <i>mark</i>
has sometimes been added on these occasions to indicate that he did
not walk a distance of 7 miles. Sometimes indicators along the
railway lines or the telegraph lines were used, as in the entry for
18 July, above, <i>I met Mr A. de Brune on overland telegraph line
and we had lunch together at post No. 2020, about 20 miles from
Warlock Ponds.</i></p>

<p class="dayhead">28 July 1922, day 312 to 10 August 1922, day
325.</p>

<p>Below are some entries which appeared in the diary during this
period. They provide an indication of walking conditions at this
time. From 28 July to 10 August, inclusive, de Brune walked 201
miles.</p>

<p><b>28 July</b>. <i>On to 23-mile (mark) along railway road. Very
rough and many creeks crossing road, all dry. On to Edith River
17-mile camp.</i></p>

<p><b>29 July</b>. <i>On to 160-mile camp, passing Horseshoe Siding
at 170-mile mark and Ferguson River at 166-mile mark. The deviation
of railway at Ferguson River&mdash;concrete piles in river and
embankments. On to Cullen Siding and camped. Why not native names
for sidings, as in other parts of Australia?</i></p>

<p><b>30 July</b>. <i>Arrived at Pine Creek. "(Signed) E. C.
Nicholls, office in charge, police station."</i></p>

<p><b>2 August</b>. <i>Yesterday, road through hills was stony and
bad. On to Lady Grace (113-mile mark), and then to 112-mile camp.
Then on to Brock's Creek, passing train.</i></p>

<p><b>3 August</b>. <i>At Brock's Creek. On to 100-mile camp. Then
to 88-mile camp. "I have this day interviewed a man who gave his
name as Aidan de Brune, who is passing through here per boot and
going towards Darwin. H. P. Cameron, Mounted Constable, Daly
River."</i></p>

<p><b>10 August</b>. At Darwin. <i>"</i><i>Reported at NT Times

<p>De Brune reached Darwin on 10 August 1922, 325 days after
leaving Sydney. He had walked on 201 days and had travelled 3624
miles.</p>

<p>He had left Burketown on 22 March 1922, after being laid up in
the hospital for seven weeks and noted, on arriving in Darwin, that
he was meant to wire, i.e. send a telegram, South (to the <i>Daily Mail</i>)
100 words weekly. However, since he had left the telegraph line at Burketown
and met it again at Katherine, about 800 miles away, there was no
way that he could comply with his obligations.</p>

<p class="caption">Aidan de Brune in Darwin, July 1922.<br>
(J J Gay Papers, State Library of NSW)</p>

<p>He lamented that he did not know that there were no telegraph
facilities in such a large area of Queensland and the Northern
Territory and that the information was not readily
available.<sup><a href="#en82">82</a></sup><a name="ren82" id=
"ren82"></a></p>

<p>In fact, de Brune <i>had</i> met the line again <i>before</i> he
reached Katherine&mdash;at Newcastle Waters, 600 miles from
Burketown. He reached Newcastle Waters on 20 June 1922, and was
therefore <i>three</i> months without telegraph facilities. Either
he was confused or mistaken about the distance or he was indulging
in a spot of hyperbole&mdash;a favourite occupation with him.</p>

<p>The fact that he had to <i>telegraph</i> his stories, accounts
for the fact that there are many short articles by him in the
newspapers. He would have needed to <i>mail</i> longer articles to
the <i>Daily Mail</i> or, as he frequently did, provide articles to
the local newspaper office, or give an interview, when he was in a
town which had a newspaper.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">Darwin was a maze of bewilderment to me and it
took hours to get used to the many people about me. I had been for
months accustomed to seeing one or two people at intervals of days
and the ordinary life of even a small town was a novelty and
distraction. I received a great welcome into Darwin, so warm that I
really began to consider that I had done something wonderful in
walking the 3624 miles between there and Sydney.</p>

<p>A sample of the comments in his diary, particularly those by
prominent people, show that the people of Darwin also thought that
he had done something wonderful:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Not one to miss an opportunity, de Brune had
the following piece inserted in the Darwin <i>Northern
Standard</i>:<sup><a href="#en83">83</a></sup><a name="ren83" id=
"ren83"></a></p>

<p>We are informed that Mr Harry Robinson is the only accredited
person to sell photos of Mr Aidan de Brune (the overlanding
journalist), in Queensland (north of Brisbane), the Territory and
WA. A small supply of autographed photos can be obtained at
Nelson's Mart.</p>

<p class="dayhead">12 August 1922. Day 327. 0m. (3624m.)</p>

<p>Before de Brune left Darwin, the <i>Northern Territory Times and
Gazette</i> reported:<sup><a href="#en84">84</a></sup><a name=
"ren84" id="ren84"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">He struck the Territory near Alexandria
Station on May 20, and was laid up with fever at Newcastle Waters
for fourteen days. He had no trouble with blacks except at Abrahams
Billabong where an abo. tried to steal his swag and was rewarded
with a thrashing. He avoided trouble among the blacks by conjuring
tricks and was known and feared as a devil-devil. His reputation
preceded him by many days. Blacks everywhere were aware of his
approach and fled the locality.[xv]<br>
<br>
De Brune reports that the country everywhere looks magnificent
especially on the tablelands and the trip was made much easier by
being able to obtain water at Government bores. The wet season
started two days before his arrival at Cairns, and he was never dry
for six weeks until Burketown was reached<br>
<br></p>

<p class="newspaper">So far he has worn out five pairs of boots. De
Brune leaves for Wyndham to-morrow. He will have to retrace his
steps to Pine Creek before he can branch off on the track towards
Wyndham.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xv. Perhaps more hyperbole on the traveller's
part.]</p>

<p>Regarding the reference to aborigines, de Brune had noted in his
diary that he met three aborigines near Abrahams Billabong. One, he
noted, was called "Kimberley Jack." Later, in a newspaper article,
he stated that he had had no problems with aborigines while on his
walk&mdash;a different story to that related here. There is little
mention of aborigines&mdash;or "blacks" or "abos," as they were
often called at that time&mdash;in de Brune's diary. However, it is
certain that they were marginalised, even in remote locations.</p>

<p>De Brune's political leaning was towards the left. He became
associated with the <i>Daily Mail</i>, which later merged with the
<i>Labor Daily,</i> and he visited the Labor Party office in
Adelaide and met prominent identities, including F. P. Ward,
Secretary, of the S.A. Branch of the Australian Labor Party.</p>

<p>In Darwin, he became involved in mediation to settle a strike
involving The North Australian Industrial Union. The <i>Northern
Standard</i> of 15 August 1922 carried the story, offering a
sympathetic view of de Brune's involvement.<sup><a href=
"#en85">85</a></sup><a name="ren85" id="ren85"></a> A rival
newspaper, The <i>Northern Territory Times and Gazette,</i> under
the headline "By Gee, by Gosh, by Gum." was scathing in its
reporting, and referred to de Brune's chest-beating regarding the
part played by him.<sup><a href="#en86">86</a></sup><a name="ren86"
id="ren86"></a> De Brune rebutted criticism of his part in settling
the strike.<sup><a href="#en87">87</a></sup><a name="ren87" id=
"ren87"></a></p>

<p>While in Darwin, de Brune became interested in the idea of the
Northern Territory becoming a state. He wrote in the <i>Northern
Standard</i>, on 22 August 1922:<sup><a href=
"#en88">88</a></sup><a name="ren88" id="ren88"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper"><b>A State in Making.</b><br>
<br>
Within the Commonwealth of Australia lies a large territory that
has so far hardly been touched by the hand of the State maker. In
fact this land is not a State, as we know States. It is a territory
developed and administered by the Federal Government.<br>
<br>
It has been claimed, and I think justly, that had the northern
Territory had State Government and State rights the country would
to-day not be in the present backward condition. State citizenship
would have attracted men of character who would have invested their
money and their lives in the country and by the increase of
population and productiveness made out of the tropical wilderness a
new self-governing State of the Commonwealth. What has the
Commonwealth Government accomplished in the development of the NT
since they took it over from the South Australian State? One of the
conditions on which they took it over was that a railway should be
built from North to South. Although years have passed, that railway
is still on paper. So far as the people of the Territory can gather
the railway is mainly an excuse for parliamentary trips, expensive
and useless.</p>

<p>De Brune was obviously induced to elaborate on his ideas. On 25
August and 29 August, under the headline, <i>The Northern
State</i>, the newspaper published lengthy articles by de Brune,
outlining his ideas on the subject.<sup><a href=
"#en89">89</a></sup><a name="ren89" id="ren89"></a></p>

<p>In Darwin, de Brune met J. T. Beckett, formerly an Inspector of
Aborigines in the Northern Territory. Beckett was known to J. J.
Gay, who had commissioned de Brune to write articles for the
<i>Daily Mail,</i> and had just come into Darwin with his wife "out
of the Gulf of Carpentaria, where we had been wafted about by
sundry cyclonic disturbances, when I got a wire from the <i>Daily
Mail</i> asking me to look out for Aidan de Brune walking round
Australia."<sup><a href="#en90">90</a></sup><a name="ren90" id=
"ren90"></a></p>

<p>In April 1920, Beckett had travelled overland from Burketown to
Townsville and he said "his eyes had been opened to the wonderful
possibilities of the great unoccupied areas in the Gulf
country."<sup><a href="#en91">91</a></sup><a name="ren91" id=
"ren91"></a> No doubt, he discussed his ideas with de Brune, who
had also travelled overland from Cairns to Darwin via
Burketown.</p>

<p>Later, as de Brune passed through some of the larger towns, he
began to give talks, or "lectures," as he termed them, on his
experiences in the "Northland" and seemed always to wax lyrical
about its potential and the need for a state, or states, to be
created. This subject is mentioned here as it comes up in newspaper
articles and in comments in de Brune's diary. Even a year later,
when in Adelaide, de Brune noted in his diary:</p>

<p><i>Lectured at Public Library Lecture Room in evening under
presidency of Dr H. Basedow, M.A. M.D. B.Sc. F.G.S., who was
President Northern Territorians' Association, a</i><i>n association
for the advancement of the Northern Territory.</i>
</p>

<p class="dayhead">19 August 1922. Day 334. 10m. (3634m.)</p>

<p>The celebrity left Darwin for Wyndham. Next day he walked
on <i>to 22-mile mark, passing siding at 10 miles. New boots rubbed
heels badly, arrived late.</i></p>

<p>As a parting shot, regarding the conditions in the Northern
Territory, de Brune wrote an open letter to the Administrator of
the Northern Territory,[xvi] posing questions about the situation
there and pointing out many apparent shortcomings in the
administration of the Territory.<sup><a href=
"#en92">92</a></sup><a name="ren92" id="ren92"></a> He had met the
Administrator eight weeks before and had found him to be "a very
reasonable man and a pleasant companion for a social evening."</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xvi. Mr Frederick Charles Urquhart.]</p>

<p>30 August 1922. Day 345. 0. (3770m.)</p>

<p>At Pine Creek, after retracing the steps he took on the way to
Darwin, he wrote:<sup><a href="#en93">93</a></sup><a name="ren93"
id="ren93"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Arrived here last night after a good journey
from Darwin. Re-walking these 200 miles I have kept to the road in
preference to the railway along which I travelled to Darwin. The
road out of Darwin winds considerably but passes through some
magnificent country, fit to grow any tropical plants. Between
Adelaide River and Brock's Creek I passed over thousands of acres
of flats on which wild rice was growing plentifully. With
cultivation, these flats should easily provide all the rice
Australia can consume.<br>
<br>
The road for the first fifty miles out of Darwin is a nightmare.
Washaways abound and at places the road is hardly distinguishable
from bush. Further south it is much better but still requires a lot
of repair work. It is sad to see crossings and cuttings that must
have taken much money to build, falling to ruins for want of a
little care.<br>
<br>
I suggest the establishment of road camps at Darwin, Brock's Creek,
Pine Creek and Katherine, where out of employment men could do a
bit of work instead of being forced on to rations.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<h2><a name="ch5.5" id="ch5.5"></a>The Pilbara and The
Kimberley</h2>

<p>The Pilbara consists of three distinct geographic areas. The
western third is the Roebourne coastal sandplain, which supports
most of the region's population in towns and much of its industry
and commerce. The eastern third is almost entirely desert, and is
sparsely populated by a small number of Aboriginal groups. These
are separated by the inland uplands of the Pilbara Craton,
including the predominant Hamersley Range which has a considerable
number of mining towns, the Chichester Range and others. These
uplands have a number of gorges and other natural
attractions.<sup><a href="#en94">94</a></sup><a name="ren94" id=
"ren94"></a></p>

<p>The Kimberley consists of the ancient, steep-sided mountain
ranges of north-western Australia, cut through with sandstone and
limestone gorges and steep ridges from which the extreme monsoonal
climate has removed much of the soil. The southern end of the
Kimberley, beyond the Dampier Peninsula, is flatter, with dry
tropical grassland, and is used for cattle ranching. In parts of
the Kimberley, such as the valleys of the Ord and Fitzroy Rivers in
the south, the soils are relatively usable cracking clays, whilst
elsewhere they are lateritic orthents. Although none of the
mountains reach even 1000 metres (3280 ft.), there is so much steep
land as to make much of the region very difficult to traverse,
especially during the wet season when even sealed roads are often
flooded. The coast is typically steep cliffs in the north but
flatter in the south, all subject to high tides.<sup><a href=
"#en95">95</a></sup><a name="ren95" id="ren95"></a></p>

<p>De Brune had retraced his steps and mostly followed the railway
back to Emungalan. He implied that he did not see a railway again
until he reached Port Hedland. However, he did actually meet the
Port Hedland-Marble Bar line at Strelley, and walked along it to
Port Hedland.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="p67" id="p67"></a><img src="1901261h-images/P67.jpg"

</p>

<p class="caption">Railway Terminus at Emungalen</p>

<p class="calligraphy">Ten days' rest in Darwin prepared me for my
long trek to Derby. First, I had to come back to Emungalan&mdash;a
distance of about 190 miles. Then I branched westwards along the
Katherine River to King's River.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Here I passed through some of the finest agricultural land in
Australia. Let my readers look at a map and draw a line south from
Darwin along the railway from Emungalan and then to Wave Hill
Station. Turn your pencil westwards to Hall's Creek and then along
the Margaret and Fitzroy rivers to Derby. The country enclosed will
be some of the finest plantation land in the world and will one day
furnish our country with all the rubber, indigo, tobacco, tea,
coffee and cocoa it needs.<br>
<br>
My route lay through Vestey Bros. series of
stations&mdash;Manbulloo, Willeroo and Delamere. Then I passed on
to Bovril Estates Ltd and came to Wickham Downs Station on the
Victoria River.<br>
<br>
Turning at an angle I came up through Jasper Gorge&mdash;one of the
wonders of Australia&mdash;to Timber Creek Police Station, and
three miles on to Victoria River Depot, a lonely store on the banks
of the lordly river. Here I met Mr Matt. Wilson, one of the best
known identities of the northlands, and found him a kindly
host.<br>
<br>
Again on an angle I passed through the country owned by Messrs.
Connor, Doherty and Durack, by Auvergne, Newry and Argyle stations
to the Ord River in Western Australia.</p>

<p class="dayhead">19 September 1922. Day 365. 26m. (4077m.)</p>

<p>The tramp came to Jasper Gorge, "one of the wonders of
Australia," as he described it, by walking from Katherine, to King
River Crossing and then on through Limestone Creek, Scotts Creek,
Native Cat, Mathieson River, Camp-Oven Creek, Rock Hole, Bulls
Creek, Willeroo Station, Baldy Springs, Paddy Springs, Freds Creek,
Delemere Station, Ruby Springs, George Creek, Revolver Springs,
Battle Creek, Water Bag Creek, Victoria River, Victoria River
Station, Crawford Creek, Surprise Creek and Sundown Hill. Passing
through Jasper Gorge he walked on to Slatey Hole, Skull Creek,
Dingo Spring, Timber Creek and Horse Creek. In reading the names,
one can almost smell the outback.</p>

<p>Jasper Gorge is within the Judbarra National Park, the second
largest in the Northern Territory, after Kakadu. The park was
formerly known as Gregory National Park, but on 21 October 2011, it
was announced that, under a joint management plan with the
traditional owners, the park would be dual-named 'Judbarra' for a
period of ten years. Beginning in 2021, its official name would be
Judbarra National Park.<sup><a href="#en96">96</a></sup><a name=

<p class="caption">Judbarra/Gregory National Park, 2010</p>

<p class="dayhead">28 September 1922. Day 374. 27m. (4210m.)</p>

<p>The weary traveller walked 27 miles until, about midnight, he
reached Keep Station. There was a storm brewing and it rained about
an hour before dawn. He sometimes walked at night as it was cooler.
He stayed for two days, before walking through Old Newry Station and
on towards Wyndham.</p>

<p class="dayhead">2 October 1922. Day 378. 8m. (4247m.)</p>

<p class="calligraphy">It was at Old Newry, some miles past the
present Newry Station, that I passed out of the Northern Territory
into Western Australia.<br>
<br>
I had then walked 4229 miles, made up of 492 miles in New South
Wales, 2218 miles in Queensland and 1519 miles in the Northern
Territory. I had still to walk three-quarters of the way around
Western Australia, through South Australia and Victoria and half
way through New South Wales to Sydney, my final destination.</p>

<p>On he walked, to Argyll Station, stayed a day, and next day made
the ten miles to the Ord River. Being bushed, trying to follow a
faint camel track, he saw a drovers' fire, late at night, and made
for it.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">From Argyll Station I went along the banks
of the Ord River to Ivanhoe Station, commonly known as "The Stud,"
and then branched slightly away to Wyndham. To show how
well-watered and difficult this country is, I may add I covered 627
miles between Darwin and Wyndham, whereas the journey by sea is
about 300 miles.</p>

<p>The Ord River is one of the fastest flowing rivers in Australia,
during the wet season and, with rich fertile soils, the East
Kimberley area boasted all the dynamics for a successful irrigation
scheme. The fertile plains of the lower reaches of the Ord River
had long lured pastoralists and farmers to the East Kimberley and,
despite the extremely heavy rainfall in the "wet," the "dry" season
reduced the Ord from a fast flowing river to a series of
waterholes.</p>

<p>In 1959 a grant from the Commonwealth Government was finally
approved, enabling the Western Australian Government to start work
on the massive Ord Irrigation Scheme, which involved developing a
dam on the river which would capture much of the 2500 gigalitres of
water that flowed into the ocean each day during the wet season
storms&mdash;enough water to supply Perth for ten
years.<sup><a href="#en97">97</a></sup><a name="ren97" id=
"ren97"></a></p>

<p>De Brune, as he walked through it then, could not have imagined,
in his wildest dreams, the area as it is today. Of course, one
could say the same thing about walking through Sydney, then and
now, or of most of the other places that he walked through. How the
world has changed in a hundred years.</p>

<p class="dayhead">9 October 1922. Day 385. 29m. (4351m.)</p>

<p>The walker covered fifty-four miles in two days after he left
Ivanhoe Station, to reach Wyndham. He spent a night on the trail,
before passing through Goose Hill to Wyndham Telegraph Station,
situated on the Cambridge Gulf. Wyndham is the oldest and
northernmost town in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia. At
the 9-mile mark he surprised Mr Riddell who got the shock of his
life <i>when de Brune informed me he had just strolled in from
Sydney</i>.</p>

<p>At the Wyndham Post office, W. A. Smith noted that de Brune was
<i>looking very well after his long journey</i>. At this time he
had travelled 4350 miles from Sydney.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">From Wyndham to Turkey Creek, where I met Mr
Jim Cunningham, reputed to be the heaviest postmaster in the State.
Thence to Hall's Creek, one of the most northern and oldest mining
centres in WA, and down the banks of the Margaret and Fitzroy
rivers to their junction at Fitzroy Crossing.</p>

<p class="dayhead">12 October 1922. Day 388. 17m. (4374m.)</p>

<p>At Muggs Lagoon, near Wyndham, "Albert" took the opportunity of
writing, via the diary, to J. Simpson of Eyre, advising that he was
<i>spending a few days at Nine-Mile after the big event. Heaps of
good wishes from the wife and self to Mrs P., Billie, wife and
self</i>. J. Cameron also took the opportunity to send a message to
<i>Billie Pearce, Eyre&mdash;Kind regards to all of you. Father out
about Goose Hill</i>.</p>

<p>If we fast forward to Eyre, 3500 miles and eleven months ahead,
we can read Billie Pearce's response. <i>Mr de Brune may be a
famous "Sydney Mail" pedestrian, but it strikes me he's a lady's
man too. He loves his cups of tea. We have thoroughly enjoyed his
stay with us. I thank him for bringing a message from Wyndham for
Billie Pearce. Eyre, 10 September 1923.</i></p>

<p>One wonders whether Billie's father was still out at Goose Hill
by the time Billie received the message. And didn't de Brune do
well to remember to show Billie the message, a year after it was
sent from Muggs Lagoon? It says something of de Brune's desire to
see things through and to please others.</p>

<p>At the places he passed through, more people began to make
entries in the tramp's diary. Since reaching Darwin he had become
well-known, because of the newspaper coverage of his walk.</p>

<p class="dayhead">15 October 1922. Day 391. 6m. (4414m.)</p>

<p>Without comment in his diary regarding his health in the days
beforehand, de Brune noted that, near Mr Brennan's property at Dry
Lagoon, he <i>broke down on the road, owing to heat</i>. Brennan
noted simply, on the morning of the 17th, that <i>Aidan de Brune
arrived here on the 15th about 8 a.m. Continued his journey on the
morning of the 17th. Wishing you the best of luck on your journey.
E. R. Brennan, Dunham Station</i>.</p>

<p class="dayhead">17 October 1922. Day 393. 20m. (4434m.)</p>

<p>On he went, walking the 20 miles to Dunham River, Upper Dunham
River Crossing, McPhee Creek, and on to Junction Station and the
hospitality provided by Archie and Hilda Martin. where he was laid
up with <i>dysentery</i> for five days.</p>

<p>From 23 October to 8 November the wayfarer walked 250 miles. The
diary records a kaleidoscope of names of creeks and stations and
crossings and wells, including Butlers Bow, Turkey Creek and Halls
Creek, together with the distances between, interspersed with

rain and a rest for three days at Cartridge Station.</p>

<p class="dayhead">8 November 1922. Day 415. 36m (4676m.)</p>

<p>After de Brune had walked 36 miles from Lamboo Station, Chas.
Arthur was <i>enjoying the pleasure of Mr A. de Brune's company at
the Margaret River Station, East Kimberley and wishing him good
luck upon his arduous trip.</i></p>

<p>The wayfarer remained there for 2 days and then walked 16 miles
to Louisa Downs Station where he stayed for a day.</p>

<p class="dayhead">13 November 1922. Day 420. 9m (4701m.)</p>

<p>After leaving Louisa Downs Station, de Brune walked <i>on
towards Fitzroy, then to 9-mile Yard and then had heat stroke and
had to go back [To Louisa Downs Station] and start out again next
day</i>.</p>

<p class="dayhead">18 November 1922. Day 425. 13m. (4776m.)</p>

<p>A week before he reached Fitzroy Crossing, de Brune noted: <i>to
Fossil Downs Station gates, 10 miles. Road very sandy. Felt very
ill and cannot stand sun. To Fossil Downs Station, 3 miles.</i></p>

<p class="dayhead">27 November 1922. Day 434. 9m. (4803m.)</p>

<p>The invalid remained at Fossil Downs for a week before arriving
at Fitzroy Crossing, from where he telegraphed the <i>Daily
Mail</i>:<sup><a href="#en98">98</a></sup><a name="ren98" id=
"ren98"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">I arrived at Fitzroy (on 27 November) after a
very bad time on the track, from Hall's Creek. The weather is bad,
with constant storms, and much heat. I have recovered from a
breakdown which I suffered near Louisa Downs Station, and am going
forward slowly, doing from ten to fifteen miles a day. The roads
are good but rather sandy, and I can only walk in the early morning
and late at night, owing to the extreme heat. I expect to reach
Derby within a fortnight. The distance which I have covered so far
is 4800 miles, in 266 walking days.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">Fitzroy Crossing is a unique township. It
consists of three houses. First, one comes to the police station, a
mile and a half on to the hotel, turn at an angle and travel two
miles to the post office. From there it is about a mile and a half
back to the police station.</p>

<p>De Brune did not remain at Fitzroy Crossing, but walked on a
further 4 miles to camp. A few days later, <i>along the Fitzroy
Road, near Jubilee Station</i>, he met <i>C. Moynihan, P.C. 1227,
Fitzroy Crossing, Kimberley Mounted Police</i> who wished de Brune
<i>best of luck on his lonely trip</i>.</p>

<p>Then he continued for a fortnight&mdash;fourteen days where he
rose and walked and stopped and ate and slept, only to repeat the
procedure next day. He travelled 250 miles to reach Derby.</p>

<p>One wonders what he thought about as he made his solitary way
around the continent? Was he a dreamer, living in his head, or was
he an acute observer who noticed the flora and fauna around him?
Did he begin to construct the mystery stories which he would write
after he returned to Sydney? Did he think of his wife and child in
England?</p>

<p class="calligraphy">Following the north banks of the Fitzroy
River, through stations only a couple of days apart, I came
eventually to Derby and there ended my second coast of
Australia.</p>

<p class="dayhead">13 December 1922. Day 450. 26m. (5020m.)</p>

<p>Reaching Derby, 3200 miles from Cairns and 5000 miles from
Sydney, he noted:</p>

<p class="calligraphy">Southwards was the next point of the
compass. The route lay along the dreaded Madman's Track to Broome,
where I enjoyed my second Christmas of the journey.</p>

<p>An account, below, by J. K. Warner, places the Madman's Track
between Broome and De Gray Station, near Port Hedland. Obviously de
Brune intended to write <i>from</i> Broome (to Port Hedland). In
fact, at Pardoo Station, south of Broome, the manager of Pardoo,
noted that <i>Mr de Brune arrived Pardoo Homestead 15/1/23. Left
16th on his way back to Sunrise after getting over the Madman's
path. Best wishes. Leo L. Miller, manager, Pardoo. 17/1/23.</i></p>

<p>In 1926 J. K. Warner was travelling around Australia in a motor
car. He stated that "the roughest part of his journey was from De
Gray Station, near Port Hedland, to Broome, a distance of
approximately 180 miles, embracing a 90 miles' stretch known as
'Madman's Track.' This is covered with drift sand and the going was
very heavy. This stage occupied three days, the most arduous, he
averred, he had ever experienced."<sup><a href=
"#en99">99</a></sup><a name="ren99" id="ren99"></a> Warner was
driving in the opposite direction to that which de Brune
walked.</p>

<p>For the record, it seems that N. R. Westwood was the first to
<i>drive</i> around the perimeter of Australia. On 4 August 1925 he
set out from Perth in a Baby Citroen car and completed a journey of
10,700 miles, travelling in a clockwise direction, arriving back at
Perth on 2 January 1926, after five months.<sup><a href=
"#en100">100</a></sup><a name="ren100" id="ren100"></a></p>

<p>Just before reaching Derby, de Brune had walked 5000 miles of
his 10,000 mile journey. With 5000 to go to reach Sydney again, he
had walked half the total distance to be travelled. He had been
away from Sydney for 450 days, and we now know that he had 447 days
still to go, so he was also half way in terms of total time
taken.</p>

<p>He had detoured from his line, in order to visit Derby, on the
coast, and now retraced his steps, to once again pick up the road
to Broome.</p>

<p>However, before the traveller leaves Derby it is interesting to
note that the town has the highest tidal variation in Australia
with the peak differential between low and high tide reaching 11.8
metres. The town was famous in the 1920s as the terminus of the
first scheduled aviation service in Australia operated by West
Australian Airways Ltd. Their service began with their first flight
on 5 December 1921. At one time the Perth to Derby service was the
world's longest passenger airline route.<sup><a href=
"#en101">101</a></sup><a name="ren101" id="ren101"></a></p>

<p class="dayhead">23 December 1922. Day 460. 20m. (5155m.)</p>

<p>Nine days after leaving Derby, de Brune reached Broome. He had
rested for three days and then travelled 135 miles (28, 0, 0, 25,
22, 26, 14, 0, 20 miles)&mdash;135 miles, 217 kilometres, 6 walking
days. He might have used the time to walk from Sydney Harbour
Bridge to Sussex Inlet; Rushworth to Wodonga; Adelaide to Port
Pirie; Perth to Bunbury; Darwin to Pine Creek; Kuranda to Cardwell.
Instead, he walked from Derby to Broome.</p>

Coast to Albany</h2>

<p class="dayhead">25 December 1922. Day 462. 0m. (5155m.)</p>

<p>De Brune was in Broome on Christmas Day, 1922, staying at the
Star Hotel. Many people signed his diary, and wished him well for
the remainder of his trip. As usual, he now seemed to be popular,
wherever he walked. Now and then someone tried his hand at poetry.
J. Hillard wrote:</p>

<p class="poem">I dreamed last night to heaven I did go.<br>
Where did you come from they wanted to know.<br>
And when I said "Broome," Oh didn't they stare.<br>
Walk right in. You're the first one from there.</p>

<p>Broome was, indeed, an isolated spot. However, when the
Geraldton-Derby airmail service first landed at Broome in 1922, the
isolation would have been eased. The "airport" was a smooth patch
of sand on Cable Beach. In the mid 1920s, a dirt strip was graded,
adjacent to the old racecourse.<sup><a href=
"#en102">102</a></sup><a name="ren102" id="ren102"></a></p>

<p>As usual, de Brune delivered an address, this time to a
gathering assembled at the Star Hotel. It was Christmas night and
the audience enjoyed his sharing of his experiences about his
journey on foot, from Sydney to Broome. The address was <i>very
interesting and much appreciated</i>, as George Moss wrote. De
Brune was given <i>best wishes for the safe and successful
completion of his undertaking, and 3 cheers for what he had already
done</i>.</p>

<p>One well-wisher waxed lyrical:</p>

<p><i>Many people see nothing in anything which does not lead to
personal aggrandisement. But it is to such men as Mr Aidan de Brune
that we owe the present position and power of the British Empire.
Without men of the spirit of adventure where would our Empire have
been today? The worst part of his travels, I believe, has been
accomplished, and my wish is that he will successfully win through,
to the gratification, at least of H. D. Forbes.</i>
</p>

<p>Another expressed it all in a simple eloquent sentence:
<i>Wishing success to a 'Lone Hand' on his long trek. Duke
Morgan.</i></p>

<p>In cards, a <i>lone hand</i> is a hand played against the rest,
or a player playing such a hand. In life, a <i>lone hand</i> is a
person who, by preference, conducts his or her affairs without the
advice or assistance of others. De Brune was certainly able to
enjoy the company of others and he attracted the admiration of
others. However, at heart, one would have to be a lone hand to
travel ten thousand miles alone.</p>

<p class="dayhead">27 December 1922. Day 464. 24m. (5191m.)</p>

<p>On walked de Brune again, covering 24 miles for the day. <i>On
to 26-mile well, 16 miles. Heavy rain last night. Across marshes!!!
To gate, 4 miles, and to Thangoo Station, 4 miles</i>. At the
station, Alice Park reminded him, <i>Don't forget the
aniseed...!</i> A minor request from someone who could not easily
procure aniseed.</p>

<p>It had been a year, almost to the day, since de Brune had
encountered rain at Cairns and had walked through constant rain to
Burketown. The rain mentioned in the previous paragraph is one of
only a handful of days on which rain is mentioned, as he made his
way down the Western Australian coast.</p>

<p>However, in the summary of his walk, de Brune wrote, "from
Onslow I touched trouble. The season above Carnarvon had been
abnormal, and for miles I waded through water." He reached Onslow
on 19 February 1923 and encountered the bad weather later that
month. It continued until the end of April, causing him to
experience a severe problem with his feet. We will come to that
point soon enough.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">Then down to Lagrange Telegraph Station, a
few miles north of the famous Eighty-mile Beach. Frazier Downs was
the next point of call, and a long stage led to Colangatie
outstation, and then to Anna Plains Station. Leaving that station,
I turned on to the stock route that lay along the
beach <i><b>[xvii]</b></i>, and one day turned on to the seashore to
enjoy a swim, from off the centre of this wonderful stretch of
sand.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xvii. Eighty-Mile Beach: A beach between
Broome and Port Hedland, the longest uninterrupted beach in
WA.]</p>

<p>Now, it seems, he <i>was</i> on the Madman's Track. He makes no
comment about it in his diary. Perhaps it was not so arduous on
foot as it was in a motor car, since he was walking along the stock
route that ran along the beach.</p>

<p>At Anna Plains Station he was <i>making a waterbag</i>. Oh, the
importance of a water bag to Aidan de Brune on his travels. Every
day he would be relying on crossing a creek or river, or of coming
upon a tank or bore, or of arriving at a station or town, so that
he could refill his waterbag. In the wet season, perhaps he could
make do, but in the dry he would be experiencing very hot
conditions. The waterbag was his life insurance.</p>

<p>Aborigines have had a presence along Eighty-Mile Beach for tens
of thousands of years. Wikipedia notes that:<sup><a href="#en103">103</a></sup><a name=
"ren103" id="ren103"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Traditional ownership of the northern part of
Eighty Mile Beach, within the vicinity of the Anna Plains pastoral
lease, is shared between the Nyangumarta People and the Karajarri
(or Garadjari) People. [Some years ago] the two groups filed
overlapping native title determination applications over the area,
which were determined together on 25 May 2012. The judgement of the
Court was delivered on country at Talgarno, a former military site
within the Anna Plains pastoral lease.<br>
<br>
In the Karajarri language, Eighty Mile Beach is called
<i>Wender</i>, meaning "a creaking noise," with reference to the
sound of walking through dry sand. Many Aboriginal people with
connections to the area now live at the Bidyadanga Community
(formerly the La Grange Mission) and nearby at Frazier Downs.
Several soaks, known as <i>lirri</i>, lie behind the beach and were
traditionally important as sources of fresh water. Many of the
soaks became Water Reserves on the Kimberley-De Grey Stock Route,
which was used until the 1960s for long distance
cattle-droving.</p>

<p class="dayhead">16 January 1923. Day 484. 0m. (5439m.)</p>

<p>Aidan de Brune walked on and spent 2 nights (7 and 8 January 1923)
at Wallal and three nights (9, 10 and 11 January 1923) at Wallal Downs Station.

<p>Wallal, along the "Madman's Track," has a unique claim to fame which involves
the theory of relativity, propounded by Albert Einstein. The general theory of
relativity is one of humankind's greatest achievements. With it, Einstein suggested
that gravity was not a force, and that space and time could be bent and stretched.

<p>The theory was published in 1915 but there was the difficulty of finding a
practical means to show that the theory was valid. It was soon realised that a
photograph of an eclipse could provide evidence to back the theory.

<p>In 2018, University of
Western Australia physicist David Blair explained that "if you had a look at stars that
were a bit near the sun, then the stars ought to be in the wrong position because
the starlight will just follow the shape of space. The shape of space is going to
be different near the sun, and so the stars ought to be in the wrong place in the sky."

<p>As a result of this realisation, soon after the theory was proposed,
it was decided in 1922 to photograph an eclipse of the sun from Wallal, 350km from Broome.

<p>On 21 September 1922, the photographs were taken. Developing the photographs in the
dust and heat of Wallal proved too difficult, so the parties made the decision to
go back to Broome to develop the plates. They went to the Broome Coastal Radio Station,
and were given everything they needed to get perfect photographs from the plates.
They provided conclusive proof that the sun caused space to curve, passing the first test
in verifying Einstein's theory.

<p>In 2018, Broome historian Robyn Wells realised that her local bowling club at
Broome had played a fundamental part in such a significant historical moment.

<p>"The then radio station is now the Broome Bowling Club," she noted. "It is
actually the ladies' and gentlemen's toilets."

<p>This story about Einstein's Theory of Relativity was related on the ABC internet site
on 24 September 2018. See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ydahhrg7">Einstein's general theory
of relativity passed first test at what is now an Australian lawn bowls club toilet</a>.

<p>De Brune arrived in Wallal on 16 January 1923, about four months after the date of the eclipse.
On 21 September he had been at Timber Creek, in the Northern Territory. He does not
mention the eclipse in his travel diary.

<p>The waterbag maker spent a few days at Wallal Downs Station then walked on to
Yunadong Well, 8 miles and then to Burgen Well, 12 miles.

<p>Next day it was <i>to Warnagul Well, 12 miles, and on wrong
road, 9 miles</i>.</p>

<p>Then, next day, <i>down the fence to the new well. On to Fence
Mill out-camp, 9 miles. To rabbit-proof fence, 9 miles</i>.</p>

<p>The fifteen miles walked on the next day saw him at Pardoo
Station, <i>on his way back to Sunrise(?) after getting over the
Madman's path</i>, according to Leo Miller, the manager of
Pardoo.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">The next house I arrived at was Pardoo
Station, and then on to the lonely telegraph station at Condon,
once the shipping point for Marble Bar, but deserted when the
Marble Bar-Port Hedland railway was opened.<br>
<br>
De Grey Station was now only 18 miles away. From there I went to
Strelley Station and then on to Pundano, on the railway.</p>

<p class="dayhead">24 January 1923. Day 492. 19m. (5494m.)</p>

<p>The railway-walker left de Gray Station at 7.30a.m. and arrived
at a "mile" camp about 10.30 a.m., <i>looking fresh</i>. Ray
Marshall penned a ditty:</p>

<p class="poem">"Mr A. de Brune walking strong and fitly.<br>
He passed the heat of day.<br>
He wouldn't camp with us<br>
But kept right on his way."</p>

<p>Next day, at Strelley Station, which the pedestrian reached
after walking 8 miles, an incident occurred which was unusual
enough for de Brune to record it in his diary.</p>

<p><i>Arrived at Strelley station at 10.30. Went to homestead.
Manager came out and asked how I dare come on verandah. When I gave
my name he said he had heard of me and told me he would come out
later. He came out after a while but did not come to me. Presently
Chinese cook came to me with some tucker wrapped in paper.</i>
</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="1901261h-images/Landlopers-10.jpg" alt="" title=""
width="200">
</p>

<p>It seems that the manager took de Brune to be a
<i>professional</i>, as opposed to an <i>amateur</i> tramp.
Apparently, men calling at stations for food would normally stop on
the ground in front of the homestead and speak from there. De Brune
obviously did not consider himself in such company, so he went onto
the verandah. This is the only occurrence of such a "welcome" that
appears in de Brune's diary.</p>

<p>Walking on to Pundano, twelve miles away, de Brune stayed there
for the night. Henry Bell noted, <i>Mr A. de Brune arrived last
night. Pleased to meet so interesting and entertaining a gentleman.
He is going strong on his great walking stunt</i>. Next day he
walked the twenty miles to Port Hedland.</p>

<p class="dayhead">26 January 1923. Day 494. 20m. (5534m.)</p>

<p class="calligraphy">I had now travelled 1700 miles since I had
seen a railway,[xviii] when I reached Port Hedland. My next
objective was Roebourne, which I reached after an easy walk. From
there I travelled down to Onslow, a town soon to be moved to
Beadon, a few miles up the coast.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xviii. The railway went from Port Hedland to
Marble Bar, in an easterly direction. De Brune was travelling
south, so he did not follow that railway.]</p>

<p>He had followed the Port Hedland-Marble Bar railway from
Strelley, where he met it coming from Pardoo. He now walked on to
Ajana, without the help of a railway, where he met the Northampton
railway line which ran on to Geraldton.</p>

<p>At Port Hedland, the well-wishers again added comments to his
diary:</p>

<p><i>To wish Mr Aidan de Brune (the Amateur Tramp) every success
in his walk around Australia. May he be successful in enlightening
others, through his experience. Thomas G. Heydon. editor, Pilbarra
News, Port Hedland</i>.</p>

<p><i>Australian Inland Mission, Nursing Home, port Hedland. Very
pleased to meet Mr A. de Brune, who has walked from Sydney to here.
May he continue to have health and strength till he again reaches
Sydney. K. Donald, sister</i>.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="1901261h-images/Landlopers-12.jpg" alt="" title=""
width="100">
</p>

<p>And just south of Port Hedland:</p>

<p><i>Mr A. de Brune arrived Boodarrie 4 o'clock afternoon of
29/1/1923, walking like a two year old. Good luck to him and the
work he has undertaken. G. T. O. McPherson</i>.</p>

<p class="dayhead">05 February 1923. Day 504. 23m. (5678m.)</p>

<p>The <i>Northern Times</i> gave an account of his visit to
Roebourne.<sup><a href="#en104">104</a></sup><a name="ren104" id=
"ren104"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">At Roebourne the pedestrian gave a most
interesting address in the Jubilee Hall, to a large and
representative gathering of residents, upon his wanderings from
Sydney. Mr de Brune is hard, tough and wiry, and apparently fit to
stand any amount of hardship. During his trip he has only suffered
from minor ailments, with one exception, when he was for seven
weeks in the hospital at Burketown, North Queensland. On Louisa
Downs Station, on the Margaret River in Kimberley, he was found
wandering in a state of delirium from heat apoplexy, but this he
considers a small matter, as after a day's spell he was on the
track again.</p>

<p>The people certainly took a fancy to him in Roebourne:</p>

<p><i>Mr A. de Brune arrived at Roebourne in a vehicle commonly
known as "per boot," probably the nearest approach to travelling by
Ford car&mdash;I being the proud owner of one. He seemed to be
suffering from gear box trouble, which was immediately attended to
in order that he might proceed on his tireless journey. I wish him
every success&mdash;Frank Porter, Jubilee Hotel, Roebourne,
5/2/23</i>.</p>

<p class="poem">Life is mostly froth and bubble,<br>
Two things stand alone,<br>
Kindness in another's trouble,<br>
Courage in your own.</p>

<p><i>De Brune has the courage of 100 men to take on a lone hand
through country infested with blacks, dry tracks, and the seven
plagues of Egypt combined. Best of wishes to A. de Brune who has
the heart of a lion and the pluck of the good old Bull Dog breed,
to carry on. He has my sympathy, humping Matilda, under present
climatic conditions. He is a good ad. for the White Australia
Policy. He is also a walking encyclopedia on Australia and things
Australian. One reward he should have, should be a snug billet at
Australia House, Strand. Billy Hughes please note
this.[xix]&mdash;Alfred E. Neaves. Roebourne, 6/2/23</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xix. The writer was urging Billy Hughes, then
Australian Prime minister, to appoint de Brune as Australia's
representative in London, supposedly a "cushy" job.]</p>

<p class="dayhead">19 February 1923. Day 518. 27m. (5881m.)</p>

<p>After resting and lecturing in Roebourne for a few days the
traveller was on his way again. He called in at the Fortesque
Telegraph Station, Mardie Station, Peedmulla Station and also
camped out as circumstances dictated. Two weeks and 200 miles
later, he reached Onslow.</p>

<p>A large jetty was built at the original site of Onslow, however
repeated cyclone damage and the silting up of the river caused
increasing problems with the loading and unloading of visiting
ships. The cargo had to be transferred by lighter from the ship to
the jetty, then by horse-tram from the jetty, across marshland, to
the town. This led the state government, in 1923, to develop a new
town and jetty to the north, at Beadon Point. The residents of Old
Onslow moved across in 1925. The new location offered better
protection from storm damage, with the town more conveniently
located on the coast. On 15 May 1943, Onslow became the most
southerly town in Australia to be bombed by the Japanese in World
War II, when a single plane bombed the airfield. However, there was
no damage or casualties.<sup><a href="#en105">105</a></sup><a name=
"ren105" id="ren105"></a></p>

<p>At the Ashburton Hotel, Frederick J. Lapthorn described de
Brune's method of conveyance, i.e. walking, using the archaic
expression, <i>per Irish Tandem</i>. Lapthorn went on to note that
de Brune <i>looks well and fit, having covered 27 miles today,
making a total to date of 5881 miles. Mr de Brune is most
interesting to converse with, as his knowledge of other countries
is so large and varied and his unique knowledge of this continent,
acquired first hand, is most valuable. We wish him a successful
finish to his tour, and hope his reward will be in line with his
effort.</i></p>

<p>Next day de Brune called at the Onslow Post Office. The
postmaster, James Coles wrote that the traveller <i>called at
Onslow post office. Temperature 110.<sup>[xx]</sup> Wrote his
telegram outside the office. Thought he was in Hades. We admire his
courage and fortitude in facing the arduous task of walking around
Australia, and wish him every success. Jas. J. Coles,
postmaster</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xx. 110 degrees Fahrenheit, or 43 degrees
Celsius.]</p>

<p>One wonders whether de Brune or the postmaster thought that de
Brune was in Hades. De Brune still managed to speak at the Onslow
Hall on that date. Later the gathering started dancing and kept it
up till midnight.<sup><a href="#en106">106</a></sup><a name=
"ren106" id="ren106"></a></p>

<p class="calligraphy">From Onslow I touched trouble. The season
above Carnarvon had been abnormal, and for miles I waded through
water.</p>

<p>22 February 1923. Day 521. 22m. (5903m.)</p>

<p>At Minderoo Station, a few days later, F. E. McDougall noted
that <i>Mr de Brune arrived here tonight. He looks well and says
that the heat here is the most oppressive since he left Sydney, and
the flies are giving him hell. I wish him every success in his
great undertaking.</i> The Richardsons, R. L. and Gertrude (Mrs),
seconded the walker's opinion, remarking on the <i>most damnably
hot weather</i>.</p>

<p>After a rest day, de Brune walked on to Koordarrie Station and
then on to a dam, where he camped. Next day he <i>went on 6 miles
on out road and then took track which bent eastwards and, after
full day's walk, landed at Horse Works Mill&mdash;well away from my
route. About 25 miles</i>.</p>

<p>At the camp, C. R. Smith mused that <i>Mr de Brune arrived at
our camp at Horse Works at sundown, having lost his way. He is on a
trip round Australia 'per boot.' Mr de Brune is perfectly sane and
normal on every other subject and I feel quite sure his trip will
effect a perfect cure. Good luck and a happy ending to his
trip</i>.</p>

<p>Another camper was more sanguine: <i>The Lone Boundary Rider of
the sixteen-mile wishes the best of luck and happiness to one of
the whitest of Australians, Mr A. de Brune, during the remaining
last few months of his trip. G. Keeling.</i> Surely there was a
meeting of minds between these two men who were both, in their own
way, playing a dangerous lone hand in the vast solitariness of
outback Australia.</p>

<p>It was only a few days later, at Yanrey Station, that the
drovers Kilmurray and Matbury added their best wishes.</p>

<p><i>We had much pleasure in meeting Mr A. de Brune, on his long
and somewhat tiresome tramp around Australia.<br>

<p>Perhaps meeting these characters was the reason that de Brune
remained at Yanrey for a few days. In any event, he was soon off
again, this time towards Winning Pool.</p>

<p class="dayhead">5 March 1923. Day 532. 13m. (5995m.)</p>

<p><i>Left Yanrey at 4.30 p.m. Wet night. Camped on 13-mile
hill.</i>
</p>

<p>Next day he walked <i>t</i><i>o 34-mile catchment tank, 2 miles.
On to 22-mile tank [34 - 22 = 12 miles] and then on 5 miles. At
31-mile telegraph post made the 6000 miles of journey</i>.</p>

<p>Next day he went <i>o</i><i>n to 12-mile tank, 5 miles, and
camped. Day too hot to walk.</i></p>

<p class="dayhead">8 March 1923. Day 535. 12m. (6031m.)</p>

<p>An early start, and another twelve miles for the day and de
Brune reached Winning Pool, where he was laid up with bad feet for
a week. On 15 March 1923, recovering temporarily from his bad feet,
he headed off to Carnarvon, a walk of two weeks.</p>

<p class="dayhead">18 March 1923. Day 545. 18m. (6097m.)</p>

<p>At Minilya Station, after four days of walking, during which he
covered sixty-six miles, he noted in his diary that the previous
night he <i>had camped just south of the line of the Tropic of
Capricorn. From Rockhampton, where I entered the tropics, to here
is 4968 miles and I have been 486 days in the tropics</i>.</p>

<p>J. F. McLeod noted that <i>Aidan de Brune arrived here today
looking splendid and making good headway south. We all wish him the
best of good luck</i>. Another well-wisher, Mrs B. LeFroy, wished
him <i>a safe return to Sydney. I very much hope he will issue a
record of his journey in book form which will be a second 'We of
the Never Never</i>.'</p>

<p>De Brune remained at Minilya Station for two nights, then walked
<i>along telegraph line towards Carnarvon. Crossed swamps about a
mile long making about 15 miles for day</i>.</p>

<p>Next day he walked only nine miles, noting that <i>rain blowing
up</i>. Then, on the following day, it <i>rained heavy all night.
Stayed at catchment shed all day. Rained until following
morning</i>.</p>

<p class="dayhead">24 March 1923. Day 551. 20m. (6141m.)</p>

<p><i>Showery morning, much wind. Took to road. Very rough and lots
of water. At 44-mile went on [telegraph] line again. Large clay
pans</i>.</p>

<p class="dayhead">25 March 1923. Day 552. 14m. (6155m.)</p>

<p>T Kempton, at his camp at Cardobia Creek, noted that <i>Mr de
Brune arrived at my camp at Cardobia Creek and camped there while
the creek was in flood</i>. He was there for three nights.</p>

<p>Arriving at Boolathanna Station on the 28th, de Brune noted,
<i>remember the big swamp, 1 mile from Cardobia Creek</i>.</p>

<p>He was experiencing some wet weather, and the after-effects of
the rain on the ground would have made walking more difficult.</p>

<p>As usual, he would have received food and drink and, possibly, a
bed, while at stations. Perhaps he preferred to sleep on the
verandah, on his bedroll. In any case, it would have made a welcome
relief from sleeping outside where it was raining. Then he set off
for Carnarvon.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">Carnarvon to Geraldton was my last stretch
of the wildlands. From Carnarvon to the Murchison River was bad for
sand, and for a few miles past the river. Twenty-four miles from
Murchison House Station I struck the railway at Ajana&mdash;and
civilisation. At Geraldton I met with a warm reception.</p>

<p class="dayhead">29 March 1923. Day 556. 20m. (6179 m.)</p>

<p>The pedestrian arrived at Carnarvon, after walking 20 miles from
Boolathanna Station. He checked into the <i>Northern Times</i>
office at 6 p.m. Along the way he had met the mail vehicle and the
occupants performed the usual ceremony with his diary. <i>Met Mr de
Brune between Boolathanna and Carnarvon&mdash;J. F. Pearson, mail
contractor. Rowland Stevenson, passenger. P. R. Perrin, passenger.
P. J. McNamara, passenger</i>.</p>

<p>There is no indication of the means of transport employed, in
this instance, by the mail contractor&mdash;either a horse-drawn
coach or cart or a motor vehicle. An Australia Post list of
historical milestones, states that "mail trucks replaced Cobb &amp;
Co horse-drawn mail coaches in 1924."<sup><a href=
"#en107">107</a></sup><a name="ren107" id="ren107"></a> However,
later, at Esperance in August 1923, de Brune was photographed when
standing beside a motor car which was being used to deliver
mail.</p>

<p>Delivering mail to people in the Australian outback has always
presented a challenge. In <i>We of the Never Never</i>, alluded to
earlier in this book, the author provides a wonderful description
of the outback mail man:<sup><a href="#en108">108</a></sup><a name=
"ren108" id="ren108"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">The Fizzer is unlike every type of man
excepting a bush mail-man. Hard, sinewy, dauntless, and enduring,
he travels day after day and month after month, practically
alone&mdash;"on me Pat Malone," he calls it&mdash;with or without a
black boy, according to circumstances; and five trips out of his
yearly eight throwing dice with death along his dry stages, and yet
at all times as merry as a grig, and as chirrupy as a young
grasshopper.<br>
<br>
With a light-hearted, "So long, chaps," he sets out from the
Katherine on his thousand-mile ride, and with a cheery "What ho,
chaps! Here we are again!" rides in again within five weeks, with
that journey behind him.</p>

<p>The Fizzer, Henry Ventlia Peckham, was born in Adelaide on 28
February 1872. For some time he was a stockman at Renner Springs,
about 300 miles south of Elsey Downs Station, the setting for <i>We
of the Never Never</i>. When the mailman for the area perished near
Lake Brunette in the drought of 1902, Peckham secured the mail
contract.</p>

<p>Peckham threw his last dice with death on 17 April 1911 when he
drowned while trying to cross the flooded Dashwood Crossing over
Campbell's Creek, on Victoria River Downs, with mail which included
a letter seeking medical help at the Station for a sick woman.
Ironically, it was not the <i>dry stages</i> which were his
undoing.</p>

<p>Peckham was buried on the banks of the River but was reinterred
at Elsey in 1944 when the Army (NT Force, Brigadier Dollery) made
moves to restore some of the graves of the characters of <i>We of
the Never Never</i> to a central Elsey Cemetery.<sup><a href=
"#en109">109</a></sup><a name="ren109" id="ren109"></a></p>

<p>De Brune certainly belonged to the same class of man as The
Fizzer&mdash;"hard, sinewy, dauntless, and enduring."</p>

id="ren110"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">My feet are very bad. I left Minilya on March
21, and I was held up at a catchment tank the next day by
torrential rains for forty hours. The track was very bad and the
country was flooded. I waded mile-long lakes and at Cardobia Creek
got into fifteen feet of swift flowing water. I was swept down
fifty yards before I could catch hold of a branch of a tree. I
nearly drowned. I reached Boolathana Station on March 28, and
Carnarvon on the following day. I have now covered a distance of
6179 miles. Sore feet have detained me again. I hope to reach
Hamelin Pool within ten days.</p>

<p>While at Carnarvon, John Waugh, of the Presbyterian Church, as
part of the Australian Inland Mission, congratulated <i>Mr de Brune
on his pluck in this arduous enterprise. Wish him a good trip for
the rest of his journey, and may we meet again in dear old
Sydney-town.</i></p>

<p>Another amateur poet, Mrs Isabella Louden, composed a ditty:</p>

<p class="poem">Some are taught on Bibles to rely<br>
Some on Koran's word will live and die,<br>
Among the deities ranks 'Delf,'<br>
Aidan de Brune relies on self.</p>

<p>Mr Louden, probably Isabella's husband, of Louden's Picture
Palace, noted that <i>Mr Aidan de Brune has given a lecture on his
travelogue to a well-attended meeting in my Picture Palace. I wish
him all good luck</i>.</p>

<p class="caption">Louden's Picture Palace</p>

<p>Others who wrote messages in the diary were concerned about his
feet. <i>Hoping his feet keep good, on life's road</i>, and <i>how
many pairs of boots have you worn out?</i> and <i>I hope you won't
lose your boots going across Eucla desert</i> and <i>God speed your
feet</i>. Messages of interest and concern from people with whom he
made brief contact on his journey.</p>

<p>Another Carnarvon local, E. Gibbon, at the Port Hotel, noted
that <i>Mr de Brune, whilst in Carnarvon on 2 April 1923, had the
pleasure of attending a Clay Pigeon match and he states this is a
novelty for all North West people. There was a good crowd of sports
and all thoroughly enjoyed themselves. I think Mr de Brune is the
best sport we have seen for many a day and his experiences are very
interesting</i>.</p>

<p class="dayhead">15 April 1923. Day 573. 19m. (6198m.)</p>

<p>The foot soldier was at Carnarvon for seventeen days, resting
and attending to the barcoo rot[xxii] on his feet</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xxii. Barcoo rot: An ulcerous skin condition,
apparently endemic to tropical or desert climates, taking its name
from the Barcoo River, which rises on the northern slopes of the
Warrego Range in Queensland.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcoo_River and
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Barcoo_rot.]</p>

<p>Leaving Carnarvon, he set out for Hamelin Pool along the
telegraph line. <i>To gate, 3 miles. To gate, 3 miles. To gate, 5
miles. To gate, 3 miles, and on 5 miles</i>. A total of nineteen
miles for the day. Next day he walked eight miles, noting, <i>Oh!
those mosquitos</i>, before noting that he had reached Boodalla
Station. Hopefully, he had outwalked the mosquitoes. Unfortunately,
those bad feet kept him at Boodalla for a week.</p>

<p>He was no imposition at Boodalla, as evidenced by this note:
<i>We, the undersigned, of Boodalla Station, thank Mr de Brune,
Australia's champion pedestrian, for his entertaining visit. We
wish him good health and a safe journey. R. W. Stirling, overseer;
D. Richards, stockman; W. T. Tittams, stockman; E. Lynch</i>. A few
days later <i>T Williams, R. Bird, P. J. Phillips, H. Wilkinson,
Patrick O'Mearn and R. W. Scott</i> also signed the book, for good
measure.</p>

<p class="dayhead">25 April 1923. Day 583. 20m. (6226m.)</p>

<p>Then, on walked the mosquito-bitten champion pedestrian
traveller <i>to Wooramel Station. To gate, 1 mile. To gate, 4
miles. To tank (catchment), 2 miles. To gate, 3 miles. To catchment
shed, 4 miles. To gate, 1 mile. To gate, 4 miles. To bore drain ½
half mile. To broken catchment shed, ½ mile.</i></p>

<p>It rained all night and in the morning, which would not have
helped his feet. He started at mid-day and walked 9 miles to a
catchment shed where he encountered more rain.</p>

<p>It was 25 April and in Australia Anzac day is held on that date
each year. It is a national day of remembrance in Australia and New
Zealand that commemorates all Australians and New Zealanders "who
served and died in all wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping
operations" and "the contribution and suffering of all those who
have served."<sup><a href="#en111">111</a></sup><a name="ren111" id=
"ren111"></a></p>

<p>De Brune was at Lawn Hill Station in Queensland on Anzac day in
1922, laid up with abscesses on his feet. One year later, it was
Anzac day again and he was at Wooramel Staion in Western
Australia.</p>

<p>The <i>Tambellup Times</i> mentions an Anzac Day commemoration
for 1921.<sup><a href="#en112">112</a></sup><a name="ren112" id=
"ren112"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">The residents of Tenterden and surrounding
districts assembled at the hall for a service organised by the
R.S.S.I.L.[xxiii]...After the service, light refreshments were
distributed by the ladies, after which vocal items were rendered by
Mrs Wheaton, Mr Meingler and Mr Cameron-Smith. The singing of the
National Anthem terminated the ceremonies.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xxiii. RSSIL: Returned Sailors and Soldiers
Imperial League.]</p>

<p>The procedure would have been much the same for 1923, at
Tenterden. De Brune passed through a few months after Anzac day.
They would have also been similar to the commemoration which took
place in most other towns throughout Australia. One hundred
years on, Anzac Day is still celebrated throughout Australia in the
same way.</p>

<p>Next day the walker was met with a fine morning and travelled 28
miles to Wooramel River. Three more days of walking brought him to
Hamelin Pool.</p>

<p class="dayhead">1 May 1923. Day 589. 2m. (6304m.)</p>

<p>E. Milnes, senior lineman, confirmed that <i>Mr de Brune camped
here last night and we had an interesting conversation re his
travels. I wish him success and good health through the remainder
of his journey</i>. At this point his water bag broke and he had to
make a new one. He remained at Hamelin Pool for 2 days.</p>

<p>Then, on again towards Murchison House Station, one of the
oldest stations in Western Australia, where he noted that he had
<i>not seen a person since leaving Hamelin Pool 4 days earlier</i>.
It was an <i>awful track</i>. Next day he reiterated that he had
<i>seen no one for 4 days, nor a gate. Absolutely wild country. No
stock on it</i>.</p>

<p class="dayhead">9 May 1923. Day 597. 11m. (6394m.)</p>

<p>De Brune called at Murchison House Station and while there
<i>went back six miles to find swag lost on rocks.</i> This might
have accounted for his remaining at Murchison for another day.</p>

<p class="dayhead">19 May 1923. Day 605. 19m. (6486m.)</p>

<p>At Ajana, the traveller came on to the railway line to walk to
Northampton, Isseka and Geraldton.</p>

<p>Ajana was the terminus of an extension to the first government
railway line in Western Australia. The line originally ran from
Geraldton to Northampton and was extended to Ajana to encourage the
development of lead mining and agriculture in the area. Ajana
railway station opened on 6 January 1913, and the town site was
declared on 26 November 1915.<sup><a href=
"#en113">113</a></sup><a name="ren113" id="ren113"></a></p>

<p>At Isseka, the lecturer <i>gave a very nice lecture to several
residents</i> at the home of J. W. M. Williams. An abscess on his
heel kept him there for a day.</p>

<p>A few days later at "Queechy," Oakajee, he again rested for a
day. <i>Mr A. de Brune arrived here 6 o'clock this evening. We were
pleased to see him and to hear his very interesting account of his
travels. We wish him the best of luck. McClusky Bros (three), per
Frank McClusky.</i> This note is not unusual, however the address
given in the diary was unusual enough to warrant a check of the
name at <i>Trove</i>. "Queechy farm," Oakagee is correct and an
interesting story concerning James McCluskey is recorded in the
<i>Geraldton Guardian and Express</i> of 16 February 1937, twelve years
after de Brune's visit.<sup><a href="#en114">114</a></sup><a name=
"ren114" id="ren114"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Mr Jas. McCluskey, of "Queechy" farm, Oakagee,
had a narrow escape from being bitten by a snake on Thursday last.
He went to the oat-bag in the barn to get a feed of oats for the
horses. Feeling something heavy and cold pass over his hand, he
dropped the oats back into the bag. He pulled the bag out of the
barn on to a cleared piece of ground and tipped the contents out.
With the oats a snake came out. Spades and sticks flew pretty fast
on to the snake, which was killed. It measured three feet six
inches and was very thick and of a brown colour. Mr McCluskey was
very fortunate that he was not bitten. There are more snakes around
this locality this season than there have been for years.</p>

<p>De Brune makes no mention of snakes in his diary, though he must
have come across some in the two and a half years he was on the
road.</p>

<p>Returning to May 1923, de Brune left Oakagee to walk to
Geraldton.</p>

<p class="dayhead">21 May 1923. Day 609. 15m. (6501m.)</p>

<p>At Geraldton he gave a substantial interview:<sup><a href=
"#en115">115</a></sup><a name="ren115" id="ren115"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Most people would rather ride than walk any
day, but walking seems to agree with Mr Aidan de Brune, who is
engaged in performing the colossal task of walking round Australia
in furtherance of an engagement entered into to that effect with
the Sydney "Daily Mail." Mr de Brune, has so far spent twenty
months on his task and hopes to complete it by Christmas next,
particularly as he has got the worst of the journey over, with the
exception of the stretch alongside the Bight to the South
Australian border.<br>
<br>
Mr de Brune struck Geraldton yesterday afternoon, and those who
were in Marine Terrace at the time were interested to see him
striding along at a steady gait, showing no effects of the 6500
miles he had already tramped. Mr de Brune called at the "Express"
and "Guardian" offices. Naturally, being a journalist, his first
care is to get in touch as soon as he arrives at any town where
there is a newspaper, with his fellow knights of the pen and paste
brush. He looks fit and well, with his skin tanned a deep brown. He
is not carrying any surplus flesh, for humping a swag, weighing
about fifty pounds, in addition to a water bag, is not conducive to
the putting on of weight.<br>
<br>
Having walked round the biggest part of Australia's coast, and
having come into contact with all sorts of people, from heads of
administrations, local bodies, squatters and farmers, to lonely
prospectors and boundary riders, Mr de Brune has naturally a huge
fund of interesting experiences to draw upon, and he is apparently
a keen and shrewd observer.<br>
<br>
When he left Queensland one individual offered to lay him
substantial odds that he would never get to Wyndham, but he did get
to Wyndham, and has done much walking since then. Coming through
the Nor-West and on towards the Gascoyne country he was troubled
much by the heavy rains, walking for days up to his knees in water,
with the result that his feet began to protest, and since then he
has had to make his daily trek a little shorter to give his feet a
chance to recuperate. He has had months in hospital with fever, and
on one occasion, not knowing where he was, tumbled into a creek in
which there was fifteen feet of running water, and he was carried a
hundred yards or more, before he was able to catch hold of the
branch of a tree, and save himself.<br>
<br>
In a conversation describing his experiences, Mr de Brune said he
undertook the journey as a result of a conversation over the much
discussed question of what various parts of the empire had done in
the war, and this caused him to ask what Australians had done for
Australia. A challenge was thrown out to him to go and see for
himself, and that was the reason he commenced his lengthy walk on
September 20th, 1921.<br>
<br>
It was, he said, 609 days since he left Sydney, of which he had
been walking for 363 days, during which he had walked approximately
6501 miles. Asked what he did, when offered a ride, Mr de Brune
said he must hold the record for the number of rides he had
refused. He had to do the whole of the journey on foot, and his
arrangement was that he must visit certain ports on the walk.
Incidentally, he remarked that he had probably worn out six or
seven pairs of boots, but when the going was soft in the sand, he
usually slung his boots over his shoulder and walked
barefooted.<br>
<br>
Describing the progress of his trek from New South Wales, through
Queensland, into the Northern Territory, part of which lay by the
overland telegraph route, he said after leaving Darwin he had to
make a detour of over 600 miles round the Cambridge Gulf to get to
Wyndham. From there he came down through Turkey Creek, where
naturally he interviewed Jim Cunningham, known to all and sundry in
those parts as the "Tropical Frog." In his walk down from the
Nor'-West he called at all the ports, and on the Eighty-mile Beach
he had a plunge in the sea as near to the half-way distance as he
could estimate it.<br>
<br>
After leaving Carnarvon he worked his way southward and then
followed the telegraph line, across to Murchison House, where he
saw the graves of the airmen who lost their lives on the disastrous
initial trip of the Nor'-West Mail Service.<sup>xxiv</sup> He
said Mr Drage was very much concerned that so far no suitable
memorial had yet been erected to mark the gallant airmen's final
resting place, and it was to be hoped this omission would soon be
rectified. When he reached Ajana he saw a railway line again, and
he had walked through practically 2600 miles of country without
railways, because the Hedland-Marble Bar line could not be
seriously called a railway. In times of flood, he observed, the
people had to go out and hunt up the lines and put them back. From
Emungalan in the Territory, to Pundano, on the Marble Bar railway,
it was 1690 miles, and from there on to Ajana about another 900
miles.<br>
<br>
Asked as to his general impression of the northern part of Western
Australia. Mr de Brune began to wax enthusiastic.<br>
<br>
"It is a wonderful country," he said. "From Carnarvon the land
improves the further north you go. As far as I could see, the
Kimberley are as good as any land in Western Australia, and richer
than a good deal of Queensland. There is a good
rainfall&mdash;about 40 inches. Of course, it is tropical, but with
irrigation it should be possible to grow any tropical produce up
there. Irrigation will be essential, because the intervals between
the rains are too long. There are some fine rivers and good
harbours and with the provision of railways, a wonderful
development could be brought about. There is a prevailing opinion
down south that the north is not fit for white men to live in. Look
at me! I have been living there for twelve months practically like
a blackfellow in the open air."<br>
<br>
Mr de Brune said he had seen all sorts of tropical products
growing, and the people of Western Australia did not realise what a
wonderful country was there awaiting development. But they could
not do much without railways. The reason, he thought, South
Australia was so keen on the North-South railway was because of the
commanding advantage it would give that State in the trade with
Asia. Western Australia was better situated in that respect and
should reach out her hands for that great and growing trade. He
added that the Northern Territory was a wonderful country, spoiled
through bad administration, and he hoped to tell the people of
Australia a good deal on that point.<br>
<br>
Everywhere he went, he concluded, he received the greatest
hospitality and kindness, whether at a station or at a lonely camp.
Particularly at the camps was he welcome, because their visitors
were few and far between, and they were glad to see anyone from the
outside world. The only supplies he carried with him were rice, tea
and sugar, in case he did not strike any people, and, of course,
tobacco. On one occasion he had to live eleven days on rice.
Thirty-four consecutive meals of rice, he observed, did begin to
pall a little on the taste. The wayfarer, who has been in the heart
of Africa, the wilds of Alaska, and in practically every country on
the globe, except New Zealand, after a brief stay in Geraldton,
will continue his journey via the Midland railway track. After
leaving Perth he will go through the southwest ports, and then
along the south coast to Port Augusta, and on through Adelaide and
Melbourne to Sydney, hoping to end his journey by Christmas. He has
about 3500 miles yet to walk.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xxiv. See "The Aerial Smash," The <i>Daily
News</i> (Perth) 6 December 1921, p. 7.

<p>At the Queen's Hall in Geraldton, de Brune, <i>s</i><i>peaking
to a good audience, gave an interesting account of his travels over
and his impressions of the Northern portion of the Australian
continent</i>. The report of the talk, or "lecture" as de Brune
termed such events, provided here, is representative of the many
such talks which he gave from this point in his
travels.<sup><a href="#en116">116</a></sup><a name="ren116" id=
"ren116"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Mr de Brune said that he had left Sydney on
20th September, 1921, at 3.45 p.m., on his tour round Australia.
Two conditions were laid down for the journey. One was that he must
walk, and the other was that he must call at certain specified
ports <i>en route</i>, so that there would be no possibility of
cutting off big angles. To keep strictly to the coast was
impossible owing to the large mangrove tracts which distinguished
the foreshore&mdash;especially in the north of the continent.
Accordingly he had departed from Sydney by what was known as the
Great North Road, and traversing the New England portion of NSW,
had passed into Queensland and had called at Toowoomba, on the
Darling Downs. From there he had gone on to Brisbane, and, keeping
thereafter almost to the coast he had touched at Maryborough,
Rockhampton, Townsville and Cairns&mdash;1820 miles north of
Sydney. He had then made a detour west across the Gulf country,
calling at Croydon, once a thriving mining town. Croydon mines,
however, were now in the hands of tributers, whose best return did
not average more than £1 per week.<br>
<br>
The speaker described graphically the tropical rainfall of the
Gulf, where the rainfall on occasions reaches 24 feet, or a simple
matter of 8 yards! From Normanton to Burketown he had to wade for
miles knee deep in water, and he was at times deluged to the waist.
Moreover, in that country, the flood waters in certain creeks
sometimes bank up and, when that occurs, the only safety lies in
reaching the high ground without delay.<br>
<br>
He had called at Lawn Hill Station fort, about 350 feet above creek
level. This place had a reputation for once having stood a siege
from the surrounding natives who, having armed themselves with
guns, had attacked the white settlers, and bullet holes were still
to be seen in the posts of the ancient fort.<br>
<br>
Crossing into the Northern Territory he struck the overland
telegraph line from Adelaide, and had visited Darwin, situated on a
beautiful stretch of water capable of sheltering half the fleets of
the world. From Darwin he had travelled across the Daly and
Victoria Rivers to Wyndham and, after touching at Hall's and Turkey
Creeks and the Fitzroy River, came on to Derby.<br>
<br>
The next stage was Broome, then La Grange Bay and Carnarvon, and so
on to Geraldton&mdash;completing a journey, as near as he could
estimate, of 6500 miles. He had still to make the trip to Perth
and, from, there, round the Bight to South Australia, through
Victoria, to his home in Sydney.<br>
<br>
At Geraldton he seemed to be at a half-way house&mdash;a border
town between the empty spaces of the north and the more populous
districts of the south. In his journey he felt that he had been to
school again. He had had certain preconceived notions of the north
of Australia, gleaned from reading and what he had heard from
others, but from the first-hand information he had been able to
obtain on his trip, he had scrapped his old notions and got
entirely new ones. The administration of the Northern Territory,
for instance, was a scandal. When he was there the Territory had no
State rights&mdash;except the right to pay taxes. In fact the
'right'&mdash;a compulsory one&mdash;to contribute to the
Commonwealth Treasury, was the sole difference between the civil
status of the white and the black.<br>
<br>
Since he was there the Commonwealth Parliament had passed the
Northern Territories Representation Bill. This permitted the
Territory representative to speak in Parliament, but not to vote.
The administrator of the Territory was an autocrat, and his
absolute position led, he [de Brune] thought, to grave abuses. He
gave several instances. Some enterprising residents had formed a
scheme for hunting and killing buffaloes (which are plentiful in
the Territory), salting them down and exporting the meat to Asia.
But, having elaborated their scheme, they were met by an ordinance
that all buffaloes intended for consumption must first be examined
on the hoof by the Stock Inspector, and certified free from
disease. Fancy making a veterinary overhaul of a live buffalo.
(Laughter.)<br>
<br>
On another occasion, the local Director of Agriculture had
announced that he had found disease in the citrus trees of the
Territory. As a result an ordinance was promulgated, ordering all
citrus trees to be grubbed out. This was done at a cost of £800,
and now a single orange or lemon costs Territorians anything from
9d. to 1/-.<br>
<br>
Dealing with the Wyndham meat works, Mr de Brune claimed that the
disrepute into which the works had fallen was entirely due to the
fact that only about one third of the freezing space required had
been supplied. The 'go-slow' charge against the workmen resulted,
he said, from orders from the manager, who had stated that if the
work was speeded up there would soon be a congestion of frozen
products at the works which would necessitate double the shipping
available to clear.<br>
<br>
He gave some amusing instances of how the capital cost of the works
had amounted up. In one case a concrete floor with a raised crown
had been put in. Subsequently it was thought that channels should
have been provided for drainage, and the work was undertaken with
chisels. Just then someone thought of consulting the plan of the
works and found that a 'dip' instead of a 'crown' was provided for
and the whole floor was taken up and remade. There was also a
'lift' in the works, but when this had been installed it was found
that there were no gateways through which the lift could go up and
down, and someone had to devise means for cutting openings in the
concrete ceilings.<br>
<br>
A striking picture was drawn of the Barkly Tableland, which the
speaker described as the finest pastoral country in the world. The
whole country, when he traversed it, was covered with grass four
feet high, and resembled a wheat field. But the great difficulty
was surface water. Travelling in a blazing sun, the only water
which he could carry was in a water-bag. The traveller was
constantly tantalized with the ever-receding mirage, which always
took the form of placid water and tempting shade. It had betrayed
many a wayfarer into leaving the beaten path, and the finding of
his bones years afterwards was usually the final chapter in the
tragic story.<br>
<br>
Mr de Brune animadverted severely on the condition of native labour
in the North-West, and compared the native laws of Queensland and
West Australia to the detriment of this State. The holdings in the
Kimberley were far too large and this he attributed to the lack of
understanding on the part of the Government in Perth, who knew
nothing of the conditions of the north.<br>
<br>
He concluded by stating it as an axiom that only the northman was
capable of governing the north. This State was unwieldy. He
considered that no Government could properly function further than
400 miles from the capital. West Australia should therefore be
divided into at least four states, and he hoped when he visited
Geraldton again, it would rank as the capital of a sovereign state.
(Applause.)<br>
<br>
On the motion of Mr E. Constantine a hearty vote of thanks was
accorded Mr de Brune, who briefly acknowledged the compliment.</p>

<p>If he met with a "warm reception" at the meeting, he received
some less than complimentary remarks from "The Seer" in the
Geraldton <i>Guardian</i> of 29 May 1923.<sup><a href=
"#en117">117</a></sup><a name="ren117" id="ren117"></a> Since de
Brune held himself out to be a Canadian, it would have served him
well to have done some research before he spoke about Canada. He
was caught out on this occasion:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Though every man has a perfect right to his
opinions, he ought not to get woefully astray as to his facts,
especially when he catalogues them for alleged public
enlightenment. "Canada," said Mr de Brune in a recent Guardian
article on 'New States and Old States,' "has a series of small
States." This simply isn't true. The Canadian Dominion has an area
of 3½ million square miles, approximately that of Australia, and it
is divided into seven states only (Australia has six). There are
some "districts" just as there are "territories" in Australia, but
these aren't provinces, as they call them in Canada, any more than
the territories in Australia, are States. Again: "Twenty people,"
said the "Mail" man, emigrate to Canada where one comes to
Australia...Considering the nearness of Canada to the overflow
population of Europe this statement might easily be true, but it
isn't. Canada's population doesn't aggregate more than 3¾ millions
now, and the country passed under British rule in 1759, and there
were English and French settlers there a generation or two before
that, in pursuit of the fur trade. A good Gazetteer and a few
population statistics ought to be lent the Shank's pony man at the
next newspaper town. They're evidently too much to add to a
fifty-pound swag.</p>

<p>Still on the railway, de Brune walked to Mingenew, Three Springs
and Carnamah, where A. J. Mortimer, station master, signed the
diary. Then it was on to Moora, where he noted that he <i>was
welcomed as one from a far, far, perilous journey</i>.</p>

<p class="caption">Carnamah Railway Station, WA.</p>

<p class="dayhead">4 June 1923. Day 623. 6m. (6705m.)</p>

<p>At Moora <i>Mr de Brune called on us during a Picnic Shoot</i>
and in the evening the Chief Steward of the Moora Club advised that
de Brune had treated the members to <i>a very interesting night
with stories of the North-West</i>.</p>

<p>Now, he was calling himself the "<i>Daily Mail</i> Pedestrian."
He had left behind the title of "Amateur Tramp."<sup><a href=
"#en118">118</a></sup><a name="ren118" id="ren118"></a> While at
Moora he wrote two articles for the <i>Midlands Advertiser</i>
titled "An Impression of the Midlands of Australia" in which he
argued for the creation of <i>smaller, compact states. We want more
centres of population, means whereby the people will be drifted out
of the present few huge capital cities, and the whole land
developed equally and systematically</i>.<sup><a href=
"#en119">119</a></sup><a name="ren119" id="ren119"></a></p>

<p>In reaching Moora, the pedestrian had clocked up 6705 miles and
had been away from Sydney for 623 days, walking on 375 days.</p>

<p class="calligraphy">From Moora I am travelling to Perth and
Fremantle. Then to Albany along the south coast to Esperance,
Eucla, Port Augusta to Adelaide, Melbourne and back to Sydney, my
starting point.<br>
<br>
Everywhere I have been received cordially and every assistance has
been given me on my wearisome way. When I arrive home I shall have
very pleasant memories of the many friends I have made on this ten
thousand miles trip on foot.</p>

<p>After resting for a day at Moora, he walked 15 Miles to
Walebing. Next day he walked 18 miles, almost reaching New Norcia,
being delayed by constant rain and hail, which prompted him to look
over the New Norcia monastery. At New Norcia, one scribe wrote:
<i>That he may accomplish a task which only a man of stout heart
would attempt, is the fervent wish of Mrs Lanigan and myself.
Joseph P. Lanigan, R.M</i>.[xxv]</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xxv. R.M. Returned or Retired
Missionary.]</p>

<p>Then on successive days, he walked 21 miles to Wannamal; 19
miles to Moondah Farm; 19 miles to Gin Gin; 20 miles to Herne Hill;
20 miles to Perth; 14 miles to Fremantle. That is 113 miles, or 180
kilometres in six days, all the while calling in at hotels, post
offices and houses to have his diary signed and to chat with the
people who signed it, and many others besides. As usual, he seemed
to have a rapport with everybody, from "the lone boundary rider of
the sixteen-mile," to the publican and his wife, to the retired
missionary.</p>

<p>He wrote of "friends," but in reality he caught but a glimpse of
the lives of the people he encountered, and they caught but a
glimpse of his life. Certainly, one assumes, nobody knew that he
was actually Herbert Charles Cull. It probably would not have
mattered to them anyway.</p>

<p class="dayhead">14 June 1923. Day 633. 14m. (6860m.)</p>

<p>From Perth, he walked to Fremantle via Nedlands, Claremont and
Cottesloe. His diary shows that, while in Fremantle, he called in
on two newspapers and made at least two other visits. On the same
day he then walked 4 miles back to Cottesloe and called in on the
Frieee (<i>sic</i>) family.</p>

<p>Miss Beatrice Frieee wrote in the diary:</p>

<p><i>This day has linked up pleasant memories and recalls happy
hours at the piano with my old teacher and friend, Mr de Brune. May
God speed him on the remainder of his 'tramp' around Australia.
With hope to see him back again in the West in the New
Year</i>.</p>

<p>Other well-wishers were (Mrs) K. Frieee, A. E. Frieee, S.
Thomas, and Arch. E. Frieee, jnr.</p>

<p>In Bunbury, where he had lived and worked before his first walk,
de Brune was known as Cull, or Culle. One presumes that Beatrice
Frieee also knew him as Cull. One wonders what explanation he gave
to the Frieee family for now using the name de Brune.</p>

<p>Next day the pedestrian, no longer a tramp, walked back to
Perth, spent the night there and then walked back to Midland
Junction He had made a detour from Perth to Fremantle and
Cottesloe, in order to see people he knew, particularly the Frieee
family. For whatever reason, he did not walk the 100 miles from
Fremantle to Bunbury.</p>

<p>Mr and Mrs George Tarrant signed the diary at Midland Junction
and sent a message on to Adelaide, to be delivered by de Brune.
<i>To Professor Henderson, Adelaide University. Mr de Brune, the
man who is walking around Australia, called here on 16 June
1923&mdash;in fact is just having afternoon tea on the
verandah&mdash;and will call on you. From Mr and Mrs George
Tarrant.</i> The diary does not record a meeting with Henderson or
any comment by him.</p>

<p>The railway walker followed the railway to York, then south to
Beverley and on to Albany. As de Brune put it, from Perth he went
slightly <i>inland down the great Southern Railway to Albany; there
I turned eastwards and followed the coast telegraph through
Hopetown, Esperance, Israelite Bay, Eyre to Eucla.</i><sup><a href=
"#en120">120</a></sup><a name="ren120" id="ren120"></a></p>

<p>At York a "wag" wrote: <i>Have inspected pack and diary and
would rather ride. A. Massey.</i> A dozen others penned lines
wishing him well for the completion of his journey. It was thus,
wherever he went.</p>

<p class="dayhead">20 June 1923. Day 639. 8m. (6950m.)</p>

<p>At Beverley, Alf. T. Thomas, proprietor of the <i>Beverley
Times</i>, wrote, <i>wishing you continued success on your journey
and the realisation of your hopes of reaching Sydney by Xmas.</i>
The pedestrian had now clocked up 7000 miles since leaving Sydney.
A mere 3000 miles to walk. It was to be 4 March 1924 that he
arrived at the same building in Sydney from which he had departed
on 20 September 1921.</p>

<p>The <i>Beverley Times</i> wrote:<sup><a href=
"#en121">121</a></sup><a name="ren121" id="ren121"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">During his brief stay in Beverley Mr de Brune,
sitting in our office waiting, took out his pen and wrote the
following:<br>
<br>
One of the first questions asked me on arriving in a town is: 'Why
don't you have a mate with you' My answer is: 'Find someone to go
with me'&mdash;and there the subject rests. I go on by myself. The
majority of people seem to think a walk round Australia is
something super-human. After nearly 7000 miles walking through some
of the wildest of Australia's land I must conclude that only one
ability is required&mdash;to stick to it.<br>
<br>
When I was on my previous trip, walking from West to East across
the continent, a letter was sent on and thrown out to me from the
train. Someone on the train had scrawled in pencil, across the top:
'Keep on pegging along, Aidan.' It was a grand slogan and to-day,
when tired and weary of the many miles behind me and before me, I
cheer up at the thought and keep on 'pegging along.'<br>
<br>
Mile succeeds mile, across bush and plain. Weary, endless miles
that seem to carry me nowhere. I think often of the large waste
spaces I have passed over; of the few towns I have visited; of the
isolated stations often days apart. But I hope that before my time
comes to 'go west' through another Unknown Land, that the
Northlands of Australia will develop far from the conditions I
found them in. That the new growing race of Australians will have
taken them in hand, regardless of the difficulties and magnitude of
the task. Let them take also the slogan given me: 'Keep on pegging
along.' Every little is a progress. Every Australian who adds his
bit to the development of the North, helps to the day when they
will be a valuable asset to Australia's national wealth.</p>

<p>The traveller's immediate destination was Albany, 250 miles
away, along the railway&mdash;a walk through towns with such
unusual names: Karping Siding, Papanyinning, Yomaning, Cuballing,
Narrogin, Nuralin Pool, Piesse. At Nuralin Pool, S. F. de Lany
wrote, <i>although the weather is very wet Mr de Brune seems to be
in the best of spirits, and going strong and well. With best wishes
for the successful completion of his journey.</i> At Piesse, he was
persuaded to stay the night with the Harveys and, in return, he
gave a short lecture on the impressions gained during his long
journey.</p>

<p class="dayhead">27 June 1923. Day 646. 14m. (7049m.)</p>

<p>At Wagin he again encountered rain and the postmaster, H. C.
Tombs remarked <i>that Mr de</i> <i>Brune arrived looking fresh as
paint notwithstanding the storms and floods. I hope that his pluck
will meet with the best possible reward&mdash;success</i>.</p>

<p>On he went, through Lime Creek, Boyerine, Woodanilling,
Woojeebing, Katanning, Murdong, Broomehill, Peringillup, Tambellup,
Tingerup and Pootenup and many other locations with equally
romantic names.</p>

<p>At Tambellup, on 30 June 1923, A. Ashton of Katanning noted that
he <i>met Mr de Brune at Tambellup, being away from home and
staying in a railway sleeping van. He was pleased to have a warm at
our fire. I wish him every success in his walk around Australia.
Very pleased to have had a talk with him</i>.</p>

<p>S. Scarborough noted that he, too, was <i>isolated at Tambellup,
owing to railway line being washed away. About 7 p.m. the bearer Mr
de Brune announced his arrival. His diaries and conversation were
very interesting, indeed. I wish him every success on his long
walk</i>.</p>

<p>L. Hanna remarked that he <i>met Mr de Brune and he don't like
Billy Hughes</i>.</p>

<p class="dayhead">2 July 1923. Day 651. 6m. (7139m.)</p>

<p>At Tenterden de Brune visited the school. His diary was signed
by Connie Wornum, W. Irving, A. Wornum, T. A. Toovey, O. Colmes, R.
T. Davis, G. Wornum, Billie Carrick, A. Mildwaters, G. Mengler, R.
Mengler, E. Herbert, J. Spratt, E. D. Hatt, D. Herbert, Ada Carrick
and Edward Davis&mdash;teachers and pupils of Tenterden School
whose names were immortalised in his diary, on 2 July 1923.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="1901261h-images/Landlopers-8.jpg" alt="" title=""
width="200">
</p>

<p>Tenterden is a town located 328 kilometres (204 miles)
south-east of Perth in the Great Southern region of Western
Australia. The town site is located on one of the sidings on the
Great Southern Railway line. The siding was established in 1891 and
shortly afterward the government made land available for
agricultural purposes in the area. The town was gazetted in 1893
and is named after a town in Kent.<sup><a href=
"#en122">122</a></sup><a name="ren122" id="ren122"></a></p>

<p>A few days after de Brune passed through Tenterden, The
Spinsters' Club of Tenterden held a very enjoyable dance. The
spinsters had gone to great trouble in carrying out an attractive
scheme of decorations, using paper streamers with evergreens,
transforming the hall into a veritable fairyland, in which danced
the Fairy Queen and her admirers. An Old Witch carried on a
flirtation with the Clown, in leading the grand march of
masqueraders, and their antics caused great mirth.<sup><a href=
"#en123">123</a></sup><a name="ren123" id="ren123"></a></p>

<p>De Brune would have livened things up with some piano playing,
had he been there. He would have passed through many towns such as
Tenterden, a town established on a railway siding, with a small
population; a small community with a small school, whose social
activities included dances and a tennis competition, and social
gatherings held in the local hall or Institute.</p>

<p>Leaving Tenterden next day, the pedestrian walked 5 miles to
Lake Matilda, then a further 5 miles to Kendenup. He kept walking,
but darkness and rain overtook him after three miles and he called
in at the Webb's residence.</p>

<p><i>Kalgan River, Carbarup, 3/7/23. Had a surprise visit from Mr
de Brune. Darkness and rain had overtaken him. Very interested in
account of his travels. P. J. Webb, E. H. Webb.</i>
</p>

<p>As can be seen, he was made welcome and, in turn, paid for the
courtesy extended, by providing some entertainment.</p>

<p class="dayhead">6 Jul 1923. Day 655. 10m. (7200m.)</p>

<p>The pedestrian completed his 250-mile trek from Beverley,
arriving at Albany, a sea port on the coast, two weeks after
leaving Beverley. From his diary, we see that he had become vocal
about his political interests. W. Mather, State Representative,
Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and R. A. Pike,
President, Albany Lumpers Union, waxed lyrical: <i>Aidan de Brune,
a blazer of the track in working class hopes in Australia. That the
future will be kind to him and his is our very earnest
wish.</i></p>

<p>A fellow-journalist, Reginald Greenwood, of the Albany
<i>Advertiser</i> noted: <i>Mr de Brune has a wonderful story to
relate of his journeying around Australia's coastline. A keen
observer and fluent speaker, his articles and lectures should do
much to dispel the erroneous impressions possessed by many
residents of the East regarding this State</i>.</p>

<p>While at Albany, de Brune wrote a piece in the <i>Albany
Advertiser</i> titled "The Gift: to See Ourselves as Others See
Us".<sup><a href="#en124">124</a></sup><a name="ren124" id=
"ren124"></a> He describes sitting by a fire and reading an
adventure story about the sea. He slips into a reverie and imagines
that he hears outside the crack of a shot, only to be woken by the
Mayor of Albany, who points out that it is a hot day and perhaps he
should let the sergeant of police escort him back to his quarters.
De Brune concludes, <i>I thought so, too. A too imaginative author
is as bad as a night out with the boys</i>. Did de Brune actually
have this experience in Albany? Who can say.</p>

<p>On Saturday 7 July, during the intervals at the Town Hall and
Empire Theatre entertainments, de Brune <i>addressed the audiences
briefly on his travels by foot around the coastline of
Australia.</i><sup><a href="#en125">125</a></sup><a name="ren125"
id="ren125"></a></p>

<p>The Albany Advertiser reported:<sup><a href=
"#en126">126</a></sup><a name="ren126" id="ren126"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">From Albany [Mr de Brune] will strike East for
Eucla, and will touch at Port Augusta, Adelaide and Melbourne and
hopes to have finished his 10,000 miles' trip by next Christmas;
and he smilingly declared that when he does reach Sydney he will
not walk any further and will not cross Pitt Street[xxvi] without
the aid of a motor car.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xxvi. De Brune departed from 9 Pitt Street, a
well-known street in Sydney, at the beginning of his walk.]</p>

<p>After a week in Albany, with 7200 miles under the soles of his
shoes, and about 3000 miles in front of him, de Brune set off
again, leaving the railway line and turning eastwards to follow the
coast telegraph along the Great Australian Bight to Eucla, on the
Western Australia-South Australia border. He could not have
anticipated the difficulties which he would encounter.</p>

<p>After staying at Albany for a week, the traveller set off and
walked just 9 miles to Kalgan Bridge. He stayed at the Smith's
house at Lower Kalgan for two nights, owing to a bad cold. The
Smiths, Ben and Agnes, were delighted with his company. Ben <i>had
the pleasure of reading his diaries and thereby renewed many old
acquaintances and associations of my travels from Wyndham to
Albany. I consider his feat in accomplishing what he has so far
done is nothing short of marvellous, knowing the State as I do. I
wish him God Speed and a safe journey for the remaining portion of
his wonderful tour, and hope some day to renew my acquaintance with
him.</i> Agnes simply wished that he might <i>have the success
your pluck so richly deserves</i>.</p>

<p>Then, on he went again, visiting and, sometimes, staying at
stations, or camping out. He visited Warriup Station, Cordiup
Station and Marra Station, the Bremer Bay Telegraph Station and
Quailup Station, where Hannah Powell thought, at first, that <i>he
was a tramp</i>. He was a tramp, but not one of the "professional"
variety.</p>

<p>Now he was on the telegraph line, with its catchment sheds
spread along the line, to catch water for use by the line
maintenance crews. Locations were referred to by the pole numbers
which were used to identify the places where maintenance was
required.</p>

<p class="dayhead">24 July 1923. Day 673. 33m. (7391m.)</p>

<p>F. A. Lowman <i>had a very interesting hour with Mr de Brune. I
wish him the very best of luck in concluding his long
trip&mdash;950-pole, east of Bremer Bay.</i></p>

<p>Then it was on to Hopetoun, where he again addressed an audience
which he <i>delighted with stories of the experiences during his
travels, and a hearty vote of thanks was accorded him and he was
wished good luck, good health and a safe termination to his long,
tiresome journey</i>. Everyone loves a winner.</p>

<p>A few days later, walking 25 miles towards Esperance, he
travelled <i>to telegraph line, 5 miles. To 199-pole catchment
shed, 5 miles. To rabbit-proof fence, 13 miles. To fence-rider's
hut, 2 miles</i>. Fence-riders rode back and forth along the
rabbit-proof fence, making repairs to the fence where necessary,
and staying overnight in huts placed along the way.</p>

<p>Next day de Brune walked forty-five miles, one of his longer
walks. <i>On towards Esperance. To telegraph line, 2 miles. To Bald
Rock, 12 miles. To Oldfield River, 4 miles. To Manjanup, 5 miles.
To 1241-pole (Fanny Cove) and five miles on&mdash;and lost
road&mdash;22 miles</i>.</p>

<p>It is surprising that he did not lose his way more often,
walking as he did along roads that he had never before travelled
on. There must have been many forks in the road which required him
to make a choice about which one to follow.</p>

<p class="dayhead">29 July 1923. Day 678. 24m. (7512m.)</p>

<p>Still making his way to Esperance, the pedestrian walked 4 miles
up the River Young, at Fanny Cove, before he found a ford across
the river. He then walked to the telegraph line 4 miles away and
walked on 15 miles, a total of 24 miles for the day.</p>

<p>Next day, after walking 12 miles, he stayed at the Stewart's
Station at Dalyup for a few days, delayed by heavy rains. He would
have appreciated the rest.</p>

<p class="dayhead">2 August 1923. Day 682. 19m. (7543m.)</p>

<p>After leaving the Stewarts, the Daws met him on the road.
<i>When driving home, about six miles out of town (Esperance) we
met Mr de Brune, with his swag up and walking very lame. We didn't
know whom he was and took him for a sundowner at first. But he told
us his name and we gladly escorted him back to our house for the
night and spent a very pleasant evening in his company. The stories
of his experiences, etc., his papers and diary were both wonderful
and interesting. With best wishes and good luck for the remainder

<p class="dayhead">3 August 1923. Day 683. 7m. (7550m.)</p>

<p>After leaving the Daw's residence, it was seven miles to
Esperance.</p>

wrote: <i>I have read Mr de Brune's journal and being acquainted
with many of the isolated places in the Kimberley that he has
visited, I can only admire the pluck and endurance of the man who
has travelled through them on foot. I wish him every success on the
rest of his journey around Australia.</i></p>

</p>

<p><i>Three roads lead to Esperance; by rail from Kalgoorlie; by
sea from Albany; and per boot, as happened to be my fate. I would
not advise anyone to follow my footsteps over the 700 miles of road
between Perth and Esperance. Fate ordained I was to undertake this
section of my journey during the rain months, and at times I
wondered whether I was engaged in a swimming or walking stunt.<br>
<br>
Weary and footsore I mounted the hill road that turns and twists
amid the verdure-clad sandhills between the Pink Lake and
Esperance. At times I glimpsed the roofs of the wireless station
buildings perched almost on the summit of a high round hill
guarding the town from the cold West winds. But never a sight of
the town. Bushy sandhills were on all sides, and in the valleys
between were small holdings of rich loam that spoke eloquently of
the dairying possibilities of the district.<br>
<br>
A sharp climb over a ridge between two sandhills, and the town and
bay stood revealed at my feet. It has been said that towns have an
individuality of their own. I found this so on my first survey of
Esperance. Surrounded and sheltered by heavily bushed sandhills,
the town formed a green oasis beside one of the most beautiful
natural harbours I have ever seen in a 7500 miles walk around the
coast of Australia.<br>
<br>
Will anyone consider the town, when the panorama of Esperance Bay
lies before them? I doubt it. Personally my eyes were irresistibly
drawn to the vast sheet of tranquil waters, intensely blue yet
iridescent; landlocked by high islands that reflected the noonday
sun in tints of green, pink and blue. A landlocked harbour! So my
eyes informed me. Wherever I looked seaward I saw land that
sheltered the bay from the storms and fury of the Great Australian
Bight.<br>
<br>
Some days later I climbed the large granite hill on which the
wireless station is situated. The view was superb. Looking out to
sea I saw the almost innumerable islands of the Recherche
Archipelago&mdash;islands from the size of a humpty to huge masses
of granite and soil towering hundreds of feet above sea-level.
Between the bewildering array of islands that shelter Esperance Bay
are fair waterways, roads of delight to the yachtsmen who have
visited Esperance. Two main channels lead into the Bay, one from
the East and the other to the South-West.<br>
<br>
Directly Westward from where I stood on the granite hill lay West
Beach, a small rocky bay famous among the local sportsmen as a
fishing place. Surrounded by high sand and granite cliffs, it is
sheltered early in the afternoon from the direct sun-rays, while
the broad sands form a splendid playground for children. Still
further along the coast lie Second Bay and Fourth Bay, both
splendid fishing centres.<br>
<br>
Rossiter Bay, another picnic spot, claims to be regarded as a good
fishing centre. Local anglers allow the claim with some
reservations, but admit its beauty. Beyond, stretches miles of
broad, firm sandy beach right to Cape Le Grand (over 1100 feet
high), affording an ideal motor run, similar to that leading to the
Bay.<br>
<br>
Looking inland, one sees miles and miles of low hills and wooded
valleys extending towards the Northern horizon. On a fine day a
dark belt of timber shows, marking the beginning of the mallee
country that recently received such warm praise from the Minister
of Agriculture, Mr Maley. Between the hills I saw huge lakes some
thousands of acres in extent.<br>
<br>
May I break away here to write of the Pink Lake? It lies about
three miles from Esperance and is truly one of the wonders of the
West. A widespread lake that speaks of salt. When I passed along
its banks the recent rains had well filled its basin, but I was yet
able to see the peculiar pink sheen that has given it the name of
"Pink Lake." It was early morning and the sun had only just topped
the bordering sandhills. White clouds hung overhead drifting along
before a slow Westerly wind. The sun's rays, deflected from the
drifting clouds, struck the waters of the lake at all angles,
giving a fascinating iridescent effect to the salt crystals that
heavily impregnate the waters. Every colour of the rainbow
reflected, but above all was the elusive pink, pale as the colour
of a pink pearl.<br>
<br>
From the hill, a magnificent view of Esperance is obtained. The
green checkboard of the town, with the houses half hidden by trees,
stood revealed as a miniature. Beyond the town the Norseman road
climbed the hills, to be lost in the distant haze.<br>
<br>
To-day, Esperance consists of three main streets. Along the shores
of the Bay the Esplanade, starting from the shelter of the granite
hill, extends far beyond the town to the East. The authorities have
wisely reserved the seaward side of this road to the public use,
and it is to be hoped funds will be available at an early date to
beautify and lay out this land. The ground slopes gently to the
water's edge&mdash;an ever-calm sea bordered with clean white sand.
Ideal for the children's playground and for bathing.<br>
<br>
From the Esplanade, a jetty half a mile long runs out into the Bay,
and I never saw the jetty without some angling enthusiasts wooing
the multitude of various fish that throng Esperance's natural
harbour.<br>
<br>
Andrew Street joins the Esplanade to Dempster Street, and is but a
bare quarter of a mile long, but to-day it is the shopping centre
of the town, containing the stores and offices. At the corner of
Andrew and Dempster Streets is the Post Office, a substantial stone
building well equipped for a large business.<br>
<br>
Dempster Street, from the granite hill to the present temporary
Police Station, is about a mile and a half long, and is the main
residential street of the town. To the West is the Bijou Hall, a
well-fitted theatre with a fine dancing floor. Further along is the
fine two-storied house erected in boom days by the late Captain
Douglas.<br>
<br>
Going East Past Andrew Street, one passes the Residency, the
Institute, and the Road Board offices; the two latter standing in a
small park wherein the grass is so luxuriant that the question
arises, why dairying is not carried on to a greater extent around
the town.<br>
<br>
The railway crosses some distance along Dempster Street, East of
the Board's offices. To-day the railway is in the process of
construction, although trains run regularly to Circle Valley, sixty
miles South of Norseman. Esperance is hoping the Government will
sanction the construction of this section, thus joining her up with
the outside world.<br>
<br>
Esperance has a peculiar fascination. Set apart, the most easterly
port of W.A.; without railway connection with other centres of the
State; dependent on the State s.s. "Eucla" as the main link with
the outside world; she rests and invigorates. "Healthy?" you ask.
Esperance, with her exquisite sea breezes, her sea bathing, and all
weather yachting facilities, is one of the healthiest spots in the
world. No one ever dies in Esperance except the doctors, and it is
said that within the last five years two medicos have died in
Esperance from sheer exasperation at the healthy townsfolk and
visitors.<br>
<br>
Esperance deserves a visit for its natural beauty and life-giving
qualities. For the children, there are wide, safe sands and
strength-giving sea bathing. For the ladies&mdash;the mothers
especially&mdash;rest and recuperation amid natural beauty. For
their male relations, sport by sea and land.<br>
<br>
Inland lie the new lands of Western Australia. Here are the wheat
lands that will double and redouble the productiveness of the
State. Here are lands for the orchardist and the mixed farmer.
Millions of acres, abundantly fruitful, await development&mdash;and
even discovery.<br>
<br>
The Esperance district is rich in minerals. The town is unique as
being a port, the natural port of a huge hinterland, extending to
the gates of the famous Kalgoorlie goldfields; it is one of the
finest holiday and health resorts in W.A. Many rare minerals are to
be found within a short distance of Esperance. The islands contain
wealth yet unexplored. Indications of oil are abundant, and it is
possible, nay, more probable, that when oil is found in the State,
the first discoveries will be within the Esperance district.<br>
<br>
The town contains good accommodation for visitors. Houses are to be
obtained for the season, but early application is necessary, and
rooms are to be let at several houses. There are three hotels. The
Esperance Hotel, facing the Bay, has accommodation for 50. The Pier
Hotel, also facing the water, has room for 16. The Royal Hotel,
Andrew Street, can accommodate 18.<br>
<br>
Esperance may be reached by boat from Albany, and by train from
Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie to Norseman, thence by motor or mail to
Circle Valley (4 miles south of Salmon Gums) to the Esperance
Railway.</i>
</p>

<p>The entire text of the pamphlet has been transcribed so that the
reader can appreciate de Brune's power with words. If only he had
taken up his pen to write the full story of his walk, we would now
have some wonderful descriptions of the many places that he visited
and be able to see, in our mind's eye, those places as they were a
hundred years ago.</p>

<p class="dayhead">16 August 1923. Day 696. 15m. (7565m.)</p>

<p>The "walking stunt" man left Esperance and, after travelling 15
miles, came to Stockyard Creek and Mr Hannett's property. Hannett
noted, <i>A second meeting with Aidan de Brune. First I met him at
Wallal in the north-west of WA. Now I have met him again near
Esperance, at Stockyard Creek, a distance of 2200 miles from
Wallal, and still going strong&mdash;like Johnnie Walker. I was
pleased to meet him again and wish him good luck. His journey's
back is broken and I hope he pulls through safely.</i></p>

<p>Then it was three days of walking (59 miles) to Lyburn Station,
at Thomas River, where he again rested his ankle for two days. W.
N. Matthews, the owner, noted, <i>having had the pleasure of Mr de
Brune's company for two days, he has stood the test of my
batching.</i> <i><b>[xxvii]</b></i><i>I wish him the very best of
luck and may he always sleep on bags minus fleas.</i></p>

<p class="footnote1">[xxvii. Batching: Living as a bachelor.]</p>

<p class="dayhead">23 August 1923. Day 703. 32m. (7656m.)</p>

<p>Leaving Mr Hannett, the walker covered 32 miles. O<i>n to Cape
Paisley. To telegraph line, 8 miles. To camp, 7 miles. To turn-off
road, 7 miles. To hut, 10 miles</i>. He was detained at the hut for
a day because of his bad foot. Then he walked on to Israelite
Bay.</p>

<p class="dayhead">26 August 1923. Day 706. 12m. (7689m.)</p>

<p>At Israelite Bay, the limper had covered 7700 miles in just over
700 days. He <i>arrived mid-day looking as fit as a fiddle
and smiling</i> according to W Looney, the postmaster. Mrs
S. Brown read some of his diary and found that it <i>contains names
of friends in other parts</i>. W. T. Brown was certainly accurate
in his observation that <i>his hard and wonderful task shall never
be fully appreciated, other than by those who know the class of
country he has travelled through and have had to depend on their
own resources</i>.</p>

<p>The smiling traveller stayed at Israelite Bay for two days and
then set off for Eyre. A few days later he was <i>o</i><i>n to
catchment shed at pole 939, 11 miles. To catchment shed at pole
1243, 15 miles</i>.</p>

<p>A few days after that he came upon the No. 1 Telegraph Line
Party Camp, eighty-eight miles east of Israelite Bay, <i>looking
well and going strong</i>.</p>

<p class="dayhead">07 September 1923. Day 718. 24m. (7899m.)</p>

<p>On he walked, from pole to pole, catchment shed to catchment
shed, coming upon the occasional line party. He reached Eyre
Telegraph Station in the evening of 7 September, <i>looking very
well, after what must have been one of his worst stages</i>.</p>

<p>In case we become used to noting the miles receding underneath
de Brune's boots, we might bring to mind the fact that, on most
days, the walker girded his loins for another bout of
walking&mdash;ten miles, twenty miles, thirty miles or
more&mdash;he walked on. He had already walked for 718 days,
covering 7900 miles, and had another 179 days and 2100 miles to
march, from Eyre Telegraph Station.</p>

<p>The walking postman carried a message to Eyre for Sydney J.
Simpson, the postmaster, from Wyndham, a distance of 4000 miles. Of
course, the sender at Wyndham could have posted the message, but
what fun to have someone deliver it 4000 miles by hand&mdash;or by
foot.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="1901261h-images/Landlopers-11.jpg" alt="" title="">
</p>

<p>He also carried a letter for Billie Pearce, who noted, <i>Mr de
Brune may be a famous "Sydney Mail" pedestrian, but it strikes me
he's a lady's man too. He loves his cups of tea. We have thoroughly
enjoyed his stay with us. I thank him for bringing a message from
Wyndham</i>. The message carrier rested in Eyre for two days.</p>

<p>The Eyre telegraph station operated for fifty years from 1877 to
1927. Australia was a relatively early adopter of telegraph
technology, despite its low population densities and the difficult
conditions sometimes encountered in laying lines. From 1858
onwards, the major capitals were progressively linked, culminating
in the link to Perth in 1877.</p>

<p>Australia was linked to the rest of the world for the first time
in 1872, via the Overland Telegraph, which ran some 2000 miles from
Adelaide through to Darwin where, in November 1871, an undersea
cable to Java had been laid. The network continued to expand in
size and sophistication until 1959 and was in heavy usage until
1945, after which time telephone usage began to erode public
patronage of telegraphy services. The final publicly provided
telegraphy service was closed in 1993.<sup><a href=

<p>After its closure in 1927, the Eyre telegraph station building
was left to decay for the next fifty years. In 1977 it was the
focus of a restoration program, by the Royal Australasian
Ornithologists Union, now Birds Australia, with assistance from the
Western Australian Department of Fisheries and Wildlife and the
Post Office Historical Society, in order to establish it as the
Eyre Bird Observatory, Australia's first. The building is listed on
the Australian Register of the National Estate.<sup><a href=

<p class="dayhead">12 September 1923. Day 723. 27m. (7952m.)</p>

<p>De Brune walked beside the telegraph line towards Eucla,
counting, one supposes, the poles and noting the pole number in his
diary when he came to a catchment shed. There was no one out there
to meet. He passed the old Clifton Homestead, then came to Moldua
Homestead, only to find the owner absent. He camped there, anyway.
W. H. Vincent was camping there as well and signed the diary. Proof
of de Brune's presence at particular places had long since ceased
being a necessity, but it made an interesting record.</p>

<p class="caption">Maintenance man on the Overland Telegraph

<p>More poles, more catchment sheds, more camping out, until, a few
days later, after walking 23 miles for the day, he came to
Mundrabilla Station and spent the night with J. Booth. They would
have shared a meal and, in return, Booth <i>had the pleasure of de
Brune's company. He tells the most interesting stories of his
travels</i>.</p>

<p>It is not every swagman who can entertain his host with
interesting stories. De Brune had been on the road just a few days
short of two years (726 days) since leaving Sydney and had covered
8000 miles, walking on 446 days. Enough time to accumulate some
interesting stories.</p>

<p>Swagman, swaggie, tramp, sundowner, tussocker; different names
for the same type: a person, who travelled on foot from place to
place, carrying his possessions in a swag. He might live on his
earnings from occasional jobs, or on gifts of money or food.
Swagmen were prevalent during times of economic
uncertainty.<sup><a href="#en131">131</a></sup><a name="ren131" id=
"ren131"></a> Of course, there was <i>never</i> a swaggie like de
Brune&mdash;he was but an <i>amateur</i>&mdash;no, now he was a
pedestrian and, from his diary, we see that he gave plenty in
return, for what he received.</p>

<p>Sometimes a swagman was said to be <i>on the wallaby track</i>,
tramping the country on foot. Often, in the bush, the only
perceptible tracks and, sometimes, the only tracks by which the
scrub could be penetrated, were the tracks worn down by the
wallabies. These tracks might have led to water or they might have
been aimless and rambling. Thus the man <i>on the wallaby</i> might
have been looking for food or for work, or might have been
aimlessly wandering by day and getting food and shelter as a
<i>sundowner</i> at night.<sup><a href=

<p>After a day at Mundrabilla, on walked the pedestrian. <i>To
woolshed, 6 miles. To abandoned homestead, 4 miles. To gate, 4
miles. To sump, 7 miles. Twelve miles east of station, motor record
breakers passed me&mdash;going strong</i>.</p>

<p class="dayhead">19 September 1923. Day 730. 24m. (8069m.)</p>

<p>The amateur tramp came to the Telegraph Repeating Station at
Eucla, his last place of call in Western Australia, bringing with
him <i>a most welcome shower of rain.</i> W. H. C. Shaw wished
<i>good luck to Aidan de Brune, the man who blazed the track around
Australia</i>.</p>

<p>The trail-blazer rested at Eucla for 2 days then set off again
to cross the Western Australia-South Australia border, nine miles
from Eucla.</p>

<p class="dayhead">23 September 1923. Day 734. 29m. 8115m.</p>

<p>There was no fanfare to mark the trail blazer's entry into South
Australia. He walked <i>t</i><i>o dam, 13 miles. To sump, 1 mile.
To sump, 15 miles</i>, and camped.</p>

<p>Next day it was <i>rain and gale of wind all day. Thought I was
in a dry area!! To dam, 17 miles. To catchment shed, 4
miles.</i></p>

<p>Occasionally he met a lineman and he also came upon Nullarbor
Station, staying the night. Walking on next day, he came to what he
considered to be the <i>edge of the Nullarbor Plain</i> and, after
walking another 20 miles, camped at White Well Station with T.
Butler, J. Lambert, Ellen Lambert, R. Borey.</p>

<p>More walking brought him to Colona Station. <i>Mr de Brune
arrived here on the long trail and stayed for the night. Very
interesting and not the average tramp. Lots of good luck. F.
Evans.</i></p>

<p>Evans used the term "the long trail." De Brune occasionally
mentioned the trail or track or road, mostly when it was
sub-standard, or when it was under water. However, for the most
part, there is no mention of the road. He just walked on it,
whatever its condition. Therefore, Edward Thomas is co-opted to
fill the gap left by de Brune regarding roads. Thomas opens his
book, <i>The Icknield Way</i>[xxviii], with this:</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xxviii. The Icknield Way by Edward Thomas;
ebook at Project Gutenberg, http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/57097.
The Icknield Way is one of the most famous ancient British
roads.]</p>

<p class="newspaper">Much has been written of travel, far less of
the road. Writers have treated the road as a passive means to an
end, and honoured it most when it has been an obstacle; they leave
the impression that a road is a connection between two points which
only exists when the traveller is upon it. Though there is much
travel in the Old Testament, "the way" is used chiefly as a
metaphor. "Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south," says
the historian, who would have used the same words had the patriarch
employed wings. Yet to a nomadic people the road was as important
as anything upon it. The earliest roads wandered like rivers
through the land, having, like rivers, one necessity, to keep in
motion. We still say that a road "goes" to London, as we "go"
ourselves. We point out a white snake on a green hill-side, and
tell a man: "That is going to Chichester." At our inn we think when
recollecting the day: "That road must have gone to Strata Florida."
We could not attribute more life to them if we had moving roads
with platforms on the sidewalks.<br>
<br>
We may go or stay, but the road will go up over the mountains to
Llandovery, and then up again over to Tregaron. It is a silent
companion always ready for us, whether it is night or day, wet or
fine, whether we are calm or desperate, well or sick. It is always
going: it has never gone right away, and no man is too late. Only a
humorist could doubt this, like the boy in a lane who was asked:
"Where does this lane go to, boy?" and answered: "I have been
living here these sixteen years and it has never moved to my
knowledge." Some roads creep, some continue merely; some advance
with majesty, some mount a hill in curves like a soaring
sea-gull.</p>

<p class="dayhead">5 October 1923. Day 746. 11m. (8355m.)</p>

<p>On the road, outside Penong, the trail-blazer <i>met a motor
party who took my photo</i> and, while at Penong, he wrote to the
editor of the <i>Transcontinental</i> newspaper at Port Augusta
advising of his impending arrival. There would be some lectures to
do.</p>

<p>A few days later he was <i>v</i><i>ery bad all day with an
attack of dysentery. Took the wrong road and found myself further
from Murat Bay than when I started</i>. He walked 10 miles and
reached Mr Skinner's farm at Goode and remained there for 3
days.</p>

<p class="dayhead">12 October 1923. Day 753. 14m. (8417m.)</p>

<p>Ceduna is on Murat Bay, at the western end of the Eyre
Peninsula, in South Australia and is an inlet of the Great
Australian Bight. It was initially named <i>Baie des Saints</i> by
Nicolas Baudin and, on the same voyage, renamed <i>Baie Murat</i>
(Murat Bay) after Joachim Murat, a Marshal of France.</p>

<p>In 1802, after Baudin had named Murat Bay, Matthew Flinders
sailed east along Australia's southern coast, from Cape Leeuwin to
Sydney. Later that year he sailed north from Sydney, charting the
coast as he went. After passing through Torres Strait his ship
began to leak so Flinders sailed to Timor for repairs and then
proceeded to circumnavigate Australia and return to Sydney by way
of the western coast.<sup><a href="#en133">133</a></sup><a name=
"ren133" id="ren133"></a></p>

<p>On his first voyage, unaware that Baudin had already named the
bay, Flinders named it "Denial Bay." Baudin's name received
precedence and the name <i>Denial Bay</i> was later applied to a
small community on the western side of Murat bay.<sup><a href=
"#en134">134</a></sup><a name="ren134" id="ren134"></a></p>

<p>Flinders was the first to sail around Australia and de Brune the
first to walk around Australia. Unlike Flinders, de Brune did not
have the naming rights for <i>any</i> of the places he visited.
They had all been named before he arrived.</p>

<p class="dayhead">13 October 1923. Day 754. 0m. (8417m.)</p>

<p>From Ceduna, de Brune wrote to the editor of the
<i>Transcontinental</i> newspaper at Port Augusta,<sup><a href=
"#en135">135</a></sup><a name="ren135" id="ren135"></a> advising
that the editor would need to ignore the letter from Penong:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Leaving Penong feeling fairly fit I went down
the second day with a bad attack of dysentery that laid me by for
four days and it was quite an effort to get into [the town of]
Murat Bay, or Ceduna, as they now call it.<br>
<br>
It is therefore necessary to revise my time table as, although I am going
on the track to-morrow, I shall not be able to put in a full
day's walk for some time. I hope to reach Port Augusta on the
morning of the 4th November&mdash;thus making me ten days late all
along the track.<br>
<br>
At Penong I delivered a lecture to a small but very enthusiastic
audience on "Through the Never Never Lands on Foot." The
arrangements were quite impromptu as I did not reach the town until
midday and only then was a lecture discussed. After the lecture
and, in conversation with townsmen, I was told I had given a lot of
information not generally known about the vast wilderness of the
north lands. I am speaking here (Murat Bay) to-night. Interest is
very keen along my line of route on the journey and especially on
what I have seen in the Never Never Lands. I am certain that if I
could only speak to a majority of the people of Australia in a body
and then answer their questions that something would immediately be
done to open up these lands.<br>
<br>
The country I am now traversing interests me greatly, The farmers
on this West Coast are putting up a great fight, but are not
getting the backing they should have, either from the Government or
their Country Party. The railway is an advance but when on earth is
it to be finished&mdash;only a few men are at work and I hear of
unnecessary and exasperating delays. Then, why leave the railhead
in the air at Penong? That town is terminus to nothing, and there
are large areas of good lands far beyond. The railway must go
forward towards the border. If there is a reason for a railway from
Murat Bay to Penong, then the same reason applies for a railway
from Penong to Fowlers Bay.<br>
<br>
There are farmers struggling for an existence around Fowlers Bay
who are entitled to be brought at once into railway communication
with the rest of the State. The Australian Governments have yet to
learn that one of their primary reasons for existence lies in the
construction of railways and roads. They have learned nothing from
history, and the opening up of other new countries. Every other
nation has accepted the dictum that settlement follows the
railway&mdash;not railway the settlement.<br>
<br>
Every State should keep an army of permanent railway builders
always at work. They are as necessary as income tax collectors.
Main lines should be pushed out into the wilderness&mdash;not in
short lengths and at irregular intervals, but by steady progress
along a well-defined plan. This West Coast railway system should be
extended as soon as possible to the border and the South Australian
Government should urge the West Australian Government to adopt a
policy of south coast railway construction that would result in a
coastal railway from Port Augusta and Port Lincoln to Albany and
Busselton, linking up the ports, and with regular branch lines
extending inland to the East-West (Commonwealth railway).<br>

I am leaving Ceduna in an hour <i>en route</i> to Yardea and Iron
Knob. As I have said above I cannot move very quickly at present,
but hope to improve in health as I progress.</p>

<p>The invalid pushed on, slowly by his standard, along the track
beside the telegraph poles. At this point he left the coast as he
headed due east. He arrived a week later at Yardea, 160 miles west
of Port Augusta, having travelled 140 miles from Ceduna. <i>To
gate, 6 miles. To dam, 2 miles. To old homestead, 14 miles. At 6
miles I was at foot of Gawler Range and, 4 miles on, entered pass
through range</i>. He camped and next day walked the 12 miles to
Yardea Station, after finding the out-camp.</p>

<p>E. H. Bird, the postmaster and bookkeeper at Yardea Station,
wrote: <i>Mr de Brune walked into Yardea yesterday. A very plucky
undertaking and he should adopt as his motto, veni, vidi,

<p class="footnote1">[xxix. <i>Veni, vidi, vici.</i> I came, I saw,

<p>De Brune wrote an article from Yardea, for the <i>Daily

borne out:<sup><a href="#en136">136</a></sup><a name="ren136" id=

<p class="newspaper">At last I am out of the wilderness. No more
long stages, no more days of lonely travelling, with only the
horizon before me, and the wild creatures of the bush for
companionship. Now, towns and people and only about 1600 miles to
reach my destination.<br>
<br>
Reaching Yardea (pronounced Yardee), yesterday, I had a long sleep
all the afternoon, and then early to bed, to awake late this
morning. Perhaps this is the relaxation of the strain of the long
bush journey. Today I have been reading the weekly and daily
papers, trying to catch up a knowledge of what is happening in the
great world from which I have been absent so long.<br>
<br>
One of the first thing I chanced on was the report of the loss of
two Youths, H. Steenbohm and E. Stevens, in the York Peninsula,
while attempting to walk around Australia. I was terribly grieved
for it seemed to me that I have been lacking in not asking the
"Daily Mail" to issue a warning against such enterprises.<br>
<br>
People may say, 'You have walked around Australia&mdash;why not
others?' Let me try to put on paper some of the reasons why I
succeeded in this endeavour and also the very peculiar
qualifications necessary for this journey.<br>
<br>
First let me say there is not money enough in Australia to tempt me
to walk around again. When I look back on my footsteps I am full of
awe at my colossal luck, indeed it is nothing else. By the law of
averages I should have laid my bones in the Northlands again and
again. Luck has been with me throughout, and only luck pulled me
through.<br>
<br>
But luck alone is not sufficient. The traveller must be a natural
bushman. That is to say, he must not only be a trained bushman, but
he must have the bush instinct. He must know the signs of the bush,
and invariably interpret them correctly. And the bush of Australia
is not one but many bushes, all opposite in character, all with a
deadly menace, to the unfortunate traveller who relaxes his
watchfulness for one moment.<br>
<br>
The traveller must know and understand the unvarying signs for
water. Water is the great question in Australia. Time and again I
have hurried or tarried so as to reach a district at the right time
of the year. I knew I dare not travel the district except at
certain seasons. To disobey this rule would have been death.<br>
<br>
Along my route I passed the graves of men who have paid the penalty
of the bush. There are hundreds of these, small 'God's acres'
throughout the Never Never Lands&mdash;monuments to the inflexible
punishment of Nature to those who disregard her laws. Constant
watchfulness, invariable good luck, and a pig-headedness that
amounts to fatalism are necessary for the man who tries to walk
around Australia. The person, or persons, who acquiesce in anyone
attempting this feat without first assuring themselves that the
adventurer possesses these qualifications is almost guilty of
assenting to suicide.<br>
<br>
But it is not necessary to class Cooke's <i><b>[xxx]</b></i> walk
from south to north in the category of dangerous adventures. He had
only a space of about 800 miles between the two railheads of
Oodnadatta and Katherine to cover, and that stretch of country is
traversed by the overland telegraph line, and also is well-supplied
with stations.<br>
<br></p>

<p class="footnote1">[xxx. On 7 March 1923 Edward A. Cooke and C.
W. Reed set out to walk from Melbourne to Darwin. At Mildura, Fred
McGlashan and C. A. Tomlinson joined the party.]</p>

<p>Six days later the conqueror wrote from Noning:<sup><a href=
"#en137">137</a></sup><a name="ren137" id="ren137"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Another week and I shall be at Port Augusta
and preparing for the last stages of my walk. From Port Augusta to
Sydney is 1440 miles, measured by the Trans-Australian Railway. The
road will carry me a bit round, but 1500 miles should cover the
remainder of my journey, and somewhere between Albury and Goulburn
I will have completed the 10,000 miles of a walk round
Australia.</p>

<p>The calculating pedestrian wasted no time and, after one day in
Yardea, pressed on towards Port Augusta, staying the night at
Thurlga Station. Next day it rained so he stayed an extra day. The
day after that he lost the track, walked 20 miles, and ended up
camping at Mt. Ive Tank.</p>

<p>It must have been a luxury to stay at the Iron Knob Hotel on 31
October 1923. At every stop, at a hotel, station or camping out,
people wrote in the diary of the pleasure they had had in meeting
him and chatting with him.</p>

<p class="dayhead">2 November 1923. Day 774. 26m. (8725m.).</p>

<p>Soon the walker was at Port Augusta, lecturing at the Town Hall.
The proprietor of the <i>Transcontinental</i> newspaper, Maurice
Hill, noted that <i>nearly three years ago we made Mr de Brune's
acquaintance when he was walking across Australia&mdash;Kalgoorlie
to Sydney. May he complete his task in the best of health.</i></p>

<p>After a stay of three days, the tramp, the pedestrian, the
traveller, the swagman, the conqueror, moved on. He <i>was</i> out
of the wilderness. Before him were 1250 miles of walking, but he
must have felt that he was nearly "home." The towns disappeared
under his feet: Wilmington, (which he reached, <i>after a tramp of
about 25 miles from Port Augusta, looking tired and weary but as
hard as nails</i>, and <i>as though he could stand a good deal
more</i>); Melrose; (where he lectured); Wirrabara, (where, on the
road in, he <i>would not accept my invitation to ride in car</i>
and where he lectured once more).</p>

<p>At Wirrabara, J. F. Beckett (not J. <i>T</i>. Beckett, referred
to elsewhere) related that, whilst motoring north this afternoon
and exchanging the usual courtesy to a pedestrian, making
south,[xxxi] I remarked to my friend Mr Passow, 'that's the Joker
walking round Australia.' I had occasion to find out later that
there is many a true word spoken in jest, when I met Mr A. de Brune
at the Hotel, that evening, and passed with him a most pleasant
time.</p>

<p class="footnote1">[xxxi. Probably by sounding the horn of the
vehicle.]</p>

<p class="dayhead">12 November 1923. Day 784. Gladstone.</p>

<p>It seemed certain that the walker would make it back to Sydney
on foot. He arrived at Gladstone (SA) on a <i>hot, dusty day</i>,
after walking 7 miles from Laura, and lectured at Gladstone Primary
School at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. and at the Memorial Hall in the
evening. The head teacher at the school noted that <i>Aidan de
Brune called at this school on his long journey on foot from Sydney
to Sydney, and addressed the children in most interesting and
descriptive language on his experiences. This lecture was better
than all the text books on this subject. Good luck to him and a
safe return to his home</i>.</p>

<p>Vivian Simens, travelling postmaster, who met him at the
Commercial Hotel, stated that <i>Mr de Brune built castles in the
air when he left Sydney. Now he is putting a foundation under
them.</i> Alfred Warren had <i>spent a most enjoyable evening and
[was] going home with different thoughts of conditions of isolated
spots in Australia, [which have been] visited by Mr de
Brune</i>.</p>

<p>It might be recalled that all of the comments quoted in this
book, by people along the way, appear in de Brune's diaries,
details of which are provided in Appendix 1.</p>

<p>A platform attendant crying out the names of the towns through
which a train will travel, might proclaim de Brune's route, which
followed the line: All aboard for Georgetown, Gulnare, Yacka,
Brinkworth, Blyth, Kybunga, Hoyleton, Halbury, Balaklava, Dalkey,
Grace Plains, Mallala, Two Wells, Virginia, Gepps Cross, and
Adelaide.</p>

<p>No more camping out under the stars, or under cover of a
catchment shed, or in a bunk in the workers' accommodation at a
cattle station. No more eating out of the tucker bag or worrying
whether there would be water at the next well, bore, catchment tank
or soak. No more nights camping alone. From Adelaide the going
should be easy.</p>

<p>At Brinkworth, Tim Whitehorn, at the Junction Hotel, <i>had the
pleasure of meeting Mr de Brune and I think he is one of the
best&mdash;game as Ned Kelly&mdash;and should be thoroughly
supported by all boot makers</i>. R. B. Griffith, mounted
constable, lamented that the weather was <i>trying</i> between
Brinkworth and Blyth.</p>

<p>The lecturer lectured. Every town he passed through he seemed to
lecture, not only to the adults at night, but to the children
during the day. The people loved his lectures, thought him brave
and true, and wanted to buy the book when it was published, Then
they wished him Godspeed. With his lecturing he must have been
accumulating a tidy sum against his return to Sydney.</p>

<p class="dayhead">23 November 1923. Day 795. 6m. (8938m.</p>

<p>Walking the 6 miles from Gepps Cross to Adelaide, de Brune
dropped in to the Imperial Hotel about noon and Jack Flannigan
informs us, <i>carried a letter to me from Allan Evans, Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation, from Port Darwin, Northern
Territory.[xxxii] In undertaking to walk around Australia he
has proved himself to be the possessor of great courage and
endurance. We will give him a real Adelaide welcome and a royal
send-off</i>.</p>

<p>From Darwin to the Imperial Hotel is 5314 miles, as de Brune
walked it. Carrying the letter was, no doubt, done for fun and to
get some good publicity. Still, it was quite a delivery service and
the feat was claimed by him as a world record.<sup><a href=
"#en138">138</a></sup><a name="ren138" id="ren138"></a></p>

<p>While de Brune was in Adelaide, the <i>Register</i> carried a
long article about him.<sup><a href="#en139">139</a></sup><a name=
"ren139" id="ren139"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">"Australia's fiercest animal," Mr de Brune
observed, "is the fly," and he went on to speak of the birds and
beasts which he has seen on his tramp. Kangaroos abounded
everywhere. At Nookambor Station a hunter had told him that he had
killed 15,000 kangaroos in the last season. Near another station he
had seen about 70 dingos drinking at a pool. On his approach they
fled. In the swampy portions of the Northern Territory wild
buffaloes roamed, and there had been projects to export their
flesh, which, according to Mr de Brune, is quite as good for eating
as that of ordinary cattle.<br>
<br>
There was one shameful practice that disgraced Australia, and that
was the catching and exporting of our beautiful bush birds. Near
Wyndham (Western Australia) he had seen a bird catcher who had 6000
of the marvellously plumaged painted finches secured in cages,
which the man was taking to port for transhipment. It was pitiable
(Mr de Brune exclaimed) to see Australia being robbed of her
wonderful birds.<br>
<br>
The tramper emphatically asserted that a walking trip of thousands
of miles is not a task for the new chum. There (he said), one
realized that Nature is a formidable antagonist, whose forces had
to be overcome if existence was to be maintained. Mr de Brune said
that a journey, such as that upon which he is now engaged, calls
for solid, slogging endurance. It was a matter, not merely of
keeping walking, but of keeping alive, of going without food, water
and rest. And apart from the menace of thirst and hunger, and the
horror of being lost, there was the occasional danger of
molestation by blacks.<br>
<br>
"Then," the bushman declared, "weapons are no good, for you are on
your own, and must sleep. You must have cunning and skill
sufficient to beat the aborigines at their own game." Truly, the
Australian bush is a thing sometimes to be loved; often to be
feared.<br>
<br>
Aidan de Brune is short and spare, and he weighs nine stone twelve
pounds. Although he is somewhat battered and burned by long
exposure to the elements of Nature, he is in excellent health and
perfectly fit. He confesses that he is forty-three years old, and
that he is not able to cover the long stretches he used to, but is
confident that for many more years he will be on the track, living
with Nature. The call of the bush is irresistible to him; he cannot
remain long in cities. One week in town, he considers, is a little
mild excitement; at the end of a fortnight he is uncomfortable: but
when the third week comes, the call of the wilds is too strong, and
he must take up his swag again, and get on to the track.<br>
<br>
Once away from civilization he is happy. He eats little, but
possesses the Australian bushman's faculty of being able to consume
enormous quantities of tea. His journey (8938 miles) has taken 795
days (26 months] of which he has walked 498 days. The remaining
days were consumed in rests, and in enquiry at stations for
directions His daily average is 18 miles.<br>
<br>
In the north, where the stages were long, he carried about sixty
pounds, which later he reduced to twenty-five pounds. On one
occasion he walked 156 miles between stations, and once, when water
was scarce, he was forced to eat his rice dry, for four days.<br>
<br>
Mr de Brune will deliver lectures in Adelaide.</p>

<p>As the reader is aware, de Brune could spin quite a yarn and
often he did not let truth stand in the way of a good story. We
will never know, when he tells a story, where truth ends and
fiction begins. Still, it all reads wonderfully well, doesn't
it?</p>

<p>The storyteller not only delivered lectures but also found time
to meet some interesting characters. In Adelaide, His travel diary
was signed by:</p>

<li>Dudley E. Kelsay, hon. sec. N.T. Association;</li>

</ul>

<p class="dayhead">29 November 1923. Day 801. 13m. (8951m.)</p>

<p>De Brune rested in Adelaide for about a week and then set off
again. We now know that he was on the road for another three
months, before he reached Sydney. On his first walk he went all the
way from Fremantle to Sydney in about the same time.</p>

<p>The diary continued to record details of distances travelled,
but there are no mention of pole numbers or camps or calling at
stations. Rather, hotel proprietors are signing the diary. He has
left the hard life behind, to be replaced by the soft
life&mdash;accommodation in hotels along the way. He had earned
it!</p>

details:<sup><a href="#en141">141</a></sup><a name="ren141" id=

<p class="newspaper">Nine miles from Monteith I came to Tailem
Bend, the western edge of the old Ninety Miles Desert. Here I
rested three days. Then on to Cooke Plains&mdash;a few houses
around a store and railway station. Then to Coomandook, another
small place. There was a bachelor's ball on at Coomandook the night
of my arrival. but the people wished to hear something of my
adventures in the Never Never Lands of Australia. So, a special
interval was made for me, and I described some of the wonders of
the Northlands. After I had completed my lecture a collection was
taken for me which I had great pleasure in donating to the
Children's Christmas Fund, on behalf of the Sydney "Daily
Mail."<br>
<br>
Yumali and Ki-Ki, two railway sidings, were my next calling points,
and then to Coonalpyn. Here I lectured on Sunday evening after
church, and was plaintively informed by the missioner that I had a
bigger audience than he had been favoured with.</p>

<p>At Coonalpyn, John B. Rynne noted that <i>Mr Aidan de Brune
arrived this evening after a hard day's walk from Coomandook, and
was very wet, having to walk most of his journey in a steady
soaking rain</i>.</p>

<p>Since leaving Sydney, 9000 miles had now passed under his feet.
The newspaper article continues:</p>

<p class="newspaper">I was to lecture at Keith, on the eastern edge
of the desert, but when I arrived I found diphtheria had broken out
in the town. The day after my arrival two little children died in
the same house within a few hours. The postmaster and clergyman
asked me to abandon my lecture as they did not think it wise for
the people to gather together and, of course, I immediately agreed.
Later inquiries, however, showed that while my lecture was
abandoned, church services were still held. Quaint, isn't it?<br>
<br>
This outbreak of diphtheria was entirely due to laxness in
observance of the health laws. The house in which the outbreak
occurred belongs to one of the "big" men of the district. Some few
years ago diphtheria broke out in this house and one or two deaths
occurred there. No attempt was made to properly disinfect the
place, and it appears to me that the germs lay dormant until the
late severe winter encouraged their growth. The house is low set
and looks insanitary. I am told it is infested with mice. The
owner, a storekeeper, keeps goods&mdash;flour and so
on&mdash;stored in part of it. I saw foodstuffs being brought over
to the shop from this store while the house was in quarantine. Some
of these "big"' country men can truly get away with anything!<br>
<br>
A small town, Bordertown, shows signs of prosperity. Buildings were
in progress and trade appeared good. Mr Donald Campbell, the
proprietor-editor of the <i>Border Chronicle</i>, tried to arrange
a lecture for me but the Institute authorities wanted too much for
the hall&mdash;20/- for a free lecture, in a small town like
Bordertown&mdash;this is absurd. The collection to defray expenses
would not reach that amount. Finally, by permission of the police,
Mr Bert Gilmore, of the Bordertown Hotel, gave me the use of his
billiard room, and I had a good audience there.<br>
<br>
In all my lectures I have stressed the folly&mdash;in fact, I might
say the insult&mdash;to our White Australian policy of the Hughes
Government, in reference to the important position of Administrator
of the Northern Territory<br>
<br>
The country around Bordertown is good, and should, when the
remaining big estates are cut up, prove an important part of South
Australia.</p>

<p class="dayhead">14 December 1923. Day 816. 13m. (9123m.)</p>

<p>At Bordertown, on his walk from Fremantle to Sydney in 1920-21,
de Brune had called in at the <i>Border Chronicle</i> office and
told of his walk. The newspaper reported on 28 January 1921 that
<i>the whole thing seemed a kind of wild goose caper, but Australia
is a free country and, as Mr de Broune appeared of full age and
entitled to please himself, the editorial staff gave him its
blessing and a free copy of last week's paper</i>. One wonders
whether de Brune reminded "the editorial staff" of that earlier
report in the newspaper.</p>

<p>On this occasion, Donald Campbell of the <i>Chronicle</i>
proffered <i>hearty good wishes from the Tatiara (the good country)
to Mr Aidan de Brune.</i></p>

<p class="dayhead">15 December 1923. Day 817. 9m. (9132m.)</p>

<p>At Wolseley, 200 miles east of Adelaide, de Brune's lecture
inspired L. N. Wait, secretary to the Institute, to compose a few
lines of poetry for the diary:</p>

<p class="poem">The flood was down in the Carpentaria swamp,<br>
Three feet over the mud,<br>
And de Brune camped on the bushy bank,<br>
And swore at the rising flood</p>

<p>L. N. Wait also made a note in the diary: <i>I have had the
pleasure of being chairman at Mr de Brune's meeting here, in the
hall at Wolseley, on his tour around Australia on foot, and can say
that he is very interesting</i>. One hundred years later, the
Institute is still standing, as is the old corner store.</p>

<p class="dayhead">17 December 1923. Day 819. 9m. (9146m.)</p>

<p>The holder of the world record for "the distance walked, to
hand-deliver a letter" entered Victoria three weeks after leaving
Adelaide. He had covered 200 miles in 3 weeks, averaging about 10
miles a day. At the outset of his walk he had intended to travel 30
miles a day, on 330 of the 365 days he had estimated that it would
take. He didn't seem to be in a hurry now. He had been away from
Sydney for over two years, he was earning an income as he walked and,
perhaps, the journey had become more important than reaching the
destination.</p>

<p>In Adelaide, at the <i>Herald</i> office, H. Kneebone had
shrewdly noted in the diary that <i>i</i><i>f he adheres to his
present occupation, he need never be unemployed. The work is
healthy and the result, if published, should be both interesting
and educational</i>. Still, time was passing. De Brune would be
fifty years old on 17 July 1924, though he held himself out to be
five years younger.</p>

<p>So the wayfarer must have begun to contemplate the end of his
journey. Would he publish a book of his travels? Would he do more
walking? Would he take up full time journalism? In the event, he
would take up writing serialised stores, as he had begun to do in
Bunbury in 1920, before he did his first walk, across the
continent.</p>

<p class="dayhead">25 December 1923. Day 827. 18m. (9238m.)</p>

<p>The <i>Horsham Times</i> reported:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Aidan de Brune, the Sydney <i>Daily Mail</i>
pedestrian who is walking around Australia, passed through Horsham
on Christmas Day. As private matters in Sydney require his
attention he is concluding his walk as soon as possible." Still, it
would be two months before he arrived in Sydney.</p>

<p>On Christmas day, his third on the road, de Brune walked the 12
miles from Pimpinio to Horsham and then another 6 miles to Dooen.
Before leaving Pimpinio, he had an <i>interesting chat</i> with A.
S. Eales at the Pimpinio Hotel. At Horsham, W. Lloyd, at the Royal
Hotel, was <i>pleased to meet Mr de Brune and to provide his
Christmas dinner. It is an honour one seldom obtains. I wish him
every luck and God speed on his remaining journey and the
compliments of the season</i>.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="1901261h-images/Landlopers-14.jpg" alt="" title=""

</p>

<p>Thomas Doyle, of the Dooen Hotel, was equally honoured: <i>I am
proud to say Mr de Brune stayed at my Hotel on Christmas night. I
wish him every success and a prosperous new year</i>.</p>

<p>If the reveller over-indulged at the Dooen Hotel on Christmas
night, it did not slow him down. Next day he walked twenty-six
miles to Lubeck.</p>

<p>On 30 December 1923 de Brune walked through Beaufort. A. G.
Evans, constable of police, noted, <i>4.30 p.m. Mr de Brune called
here&mdash;dreadfully hot day. I am pleased to have had the
pleasure of greeting him but do not envy him on his journey in this
heat</i>.</p>

<p class="dayhead">1 January 1924. Day 834. 23m. (9395m.)</p>

<p>On New Year's Day the walker called at Gordon railway station.
He had picked up the railway at Port Augusta and would follow it to
Sydney.</p>

<p>On 5 January, at Deer Park, Mrs Dora Manning, of the Cricket
Club Hotel, noted that <i>Mr A. de Brune arrived at the hotel
looking fit and well. Trusting he will accomplish his great tramp
in good health.</i></p>

<p>E. B. Manning noted that <i>there was a large number of
customers present and, as Mr de Brune arrived and stated his object
in view, he was accorded a great reception as everyone present
recognised the task he had undertaken, and wished him every success
in his undertaking and a happy and successful new year</i>. One can
imagine the back-slapping, the offer of drinks and the general
camaraderie of the group.</p>

<p>Back in Cairns, the seer who had correctly predicted the trouble
that de Brune would experience in walking through the Gulf country
in the wet season, had also written, "what good this will do to
anyone, I am at a lost to understand." The walk had done
<i>many</i> people good; those with whom he had shared a camp;
those he had lectured to and provided with an evening of
entertainment; those whom he had inspired with his courage and
tenacity; those at the Cricket Club Hotel on 5 January 1924, who
recognised his achievement and felt, just for a moment that they
were part of it.</p>

<p>Next day he walked the three miles to Sunshine and spent the
night with the 1st Sunshine Troop, Australian Boy Scouts
Association&mdash;camping out, one supposes.</p>

<p class="dayhead">7 January 1924. Day 840. 9m. (9461m.)</p>

<p>A walk of nine miles saw de Brune reach Melbourne on 7 January
1924. This was his last state capital and the last coastal city to
be visited before he headed north to Sydney. He remained in
Melbourne for two weeks. There is little mention of it in his diary
and, surprisingly, few certifications and comments.</p>

<p class="caption">Aidan de Brune in Melbourne during his walk</p>

<p>He did meet Ernest G. Mitchell, a Licentiate of the Royal
Academy of Music (L.R.A.M.). As mentioned earlier, de Brune was a
competent pianist and music teacher. Perhaps he knew Ernest
Mitchell from elsewhere.</p>

<p class="dayhead">26 January 1924. Day 859. 24m. (9564m.)</p>

<p>Five days and 100 miles after leaving Melbourne, the musician
reached Euroa and reported to the <i>Labor Daily</i>:<sup><a href=
"#en142">142</a></sup><a name="ren142" id="ren142"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">I arrived here late last night, some 24 miles
behind my schedule. The roads from Melbourne to here are all
abnormally rough and hard. In fact, I may say from Melbourne to
here I have experienced the worst roads throughout my journey.</p>

<p class="newspaper">In consequence, my feet have become very
swollen and inflamed, and to-day (Sunday) I have had to lay up and
rest. I cannot put my right foot square on the ground. Anyhow, I
hope to go on some distance to-morrow, perhaps, to
Baddaginni&mdash;anyhow, to Violet Town. In any case, from here to
Albury, at least, I shall continually lose time, and do not expect
to reach that town until the end of the week, instead of Tuesday
next.</p>

<p class="dayhead">29 January 1924. Day 862. 21m. (9585m.)</p>

<p>The lame traveller stayed the weekend at Euroa and then pushed
on. At Baddaginnie, H. S. Gilbert, a hairdresser penned a
ditty:</p>

<p class="poem">I saw in the distance a young man on a walking
tour,<br>
He had whiskers down to the floor,<br>
We shaved him quite clean on Monday eve<br>
And he continued his walk in the morn.</p>

<p>R. A. Sutherland noted that he <i>felt honoured to have had the
pleasure of shaving and haircutting Mr de Brune. It was 28 months
since he had had a shave, but I was lucky to have a razor with a
strong handle and removed the beard, I think, painlessly</i>.</p>

<p>De Brune was still a month from Sydney, but it seems that he was
preparing for his arrival there.</p>

<p>On he walked to Benalla, Winton, Glenrowan, Wangaratta,
Springhurst, Chiltern, Barnawatha, and Wodonga. Then he crossed the
Murray River and was back in New South Wales, at Albury.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5.9" id="ch5.9"></a>Albury to Sydney</h2>

<p class="dayhead">3 February 1924. Day 867. 4m. (9670m.)</p>

<p>After walking 9670 miles and being away from Sydney for 867
days, de Brune was feeling it. Constable W. J. Armstrong noted that
he had <i>much pleasure in having met Mr de Brune at Albury. He,
apparently, at the present moment, is fighting a battle against his
strength, but I hope he is successful in his ambition of being the
first man to walk round Australia.</i></p>

<p>Still, the conqueror walked on, staying at hotels along the
route and gathering more <i>best wishes</i> in his diary. A marathon
running race is twenty-six miles long. Many runners say that after twenty miles one feels that one has only run
half way&mdash;the last six miles will be as difficult, if not more
difficult, than the first twenty.</p>

<p>In de Brune's case, perhaps he was beginning to <i>unwind</i>.
For two and a half years he had kept his shoulder to the wheel or,
rather, his feet to the road. He had faced the task, day after day
after day, his eye always on his final goal&mdash;Sydney. From
Albury he had but thirty days to go&mdash;thirty days to cover the
remaining distance of 400 miles.</p>

<p class="dayhead">17 February 1924. Day 881. 9m. (9860m.)</p>

<p><i>Mr Aidan de Brune reached Yass at 1 p.m. today, having

complete his long journey when he reaches Sydney, next week. His
great feat is one that will stand as a memorial to his endurance
and will be a matter of admiration to all Australians. J. F.
Cuninsen, Yass Courier</i>.</p>

<p class="dayhead">21 February 1924. Day 885. 15m. (9916m.)</p>

<p>The <i>Labor Daily</i> reported:<sup><a href=

<p class="newspaper">Mr de Brune arrived at Goulburn looking
bronzed and weather-beaten after a trek of 9916 miles around
Australia...He is suffering from sore feet, and is pleased that his
long trip is coming to an end. To-night and to-morrow he is resting
at the Grand Central Hotel, and intends resuming his trip on
Saturday morning. Taking the remainder of his journey in easy
stages, he will arrive in Sydney on March 3.</p>

<p class="dayhead">27 February 1924. Day 891. 24m. (10022m.)</p>

<p><i>Mr Aidan de Brune arrived here, at the Family Hotel,
Thirlmere, last night at 6 p.m. and had a long lemon squash, which
he well deserved after his long tramp of 24 miles from Mittagong.
He stayed at my hotel last night and is now finishing his
breakfast. He is prepared to take to the dry and dusty road again
and to complete his tramp around big Australia. Mr de Brune is not
a very big man in build but has a very big heart to undertake such
a hard and long tramp for the past two years and more. I wish him
good luck and success, back to Sydney amongst his
friends.&mdash;Thomas Sawyer</i>.</p>

<p>After having his location certified by Thomas Sawyer, the
big-hearted pedestrian set off again and, still following the
railway, walked the 24 miles through Picton, Maldon, Menangle and
Glenlea to Campbelltown, where he stayed the night at the Club
Hotel. Miss Florence Munnery quite <i>enjoyed his playing on the
piano</i>. One wonders what music he might have chosen to play.</p>

<p class="dayhead">28 February 1924. Day 892. 14m. (10036m.)</p>

<p>Next day the relaxed adventurer walked the 14 miles to
Liverpool, on the outskirts of Sydney. He had travelled 10,036
miles and had been away from Sydney for 892 days, of which he had
walked on 565 days. He stayed the night at Casey's Family Hotel, as
noted by Phyllis Cox: <i>we were all interested in hearing his
story about his wonderful journey</i>.</p>

<p>Next day he walked 9 miles to Bankstown where he stayed at the
Bankstown Hotel for a few days. He was not in a hurry as he basked
in the glory of his achievement, as evidenced by the many
congratulatory messages in his diary. He had already agreed with J.
J. Gay on a date and time, to walk up to the same building from
which he had departed two and a half years earlier&mdash;the former
office of the <i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>

<p>Since de Brune had left Sydney, the <i>Daily Mail,</i> for which
he had provided articles throughout his walk, had become part of
the <i>Labor Daily</i>, the "new series" of which began publication
on 23 January 1924. R. F. Kearney, of the <i>Labor Daily</i> was
pleased to meet him at the Bankstown Hotel. <i>One of the
greatest pleasures of my uninspiring life has been to receive a
grip of the hand from Mr Aidan de Brune. The pleasure was
accentuated by the fact that I was the first member of the 'Labor
Daily' staff to greet Mr de Brune and welcome him, after his record
walk, to the environs of Sydney</i>.</p>

<p>De Brune spent a few days at Bankstown and then walked 6 miles
to Enfield, and then to his accommodation at Ireland's Hotel,
Burwood.</p>

<p class="dayhead">4 March 1924. Day 897. 9m (10,060 m.)</p>

<p>On 4 March 1924, after 897 days away, during which he had walked
10,051 miles, the home-comer walked the final 9 miles to Sydney,
a mere doddle for the seasoned walker. He had walked a total of
10,060 miles. John J. Gay signed him in, as he had signed him out,
with an entry in the diary.</p>

<p><i>Mr Aidan de Brune arrived at the office of the "Financial and
Commercial Times," 9 Pitt Street, Sydney in the forenoon of the
fourth day of March, 1924. He left the door of this office, then
occupied by the "Daily Mail" Newspaper Company, at 3.45 in the
afternoon of the twentieth day of September, 1921. His journey is
completed.&mdash;John J. Gay.</i>
</p>

<p>Then it was H. Barry, the accountant's turn. He noted, <i>I have
followed the walk of Aidan de Brune with great interest and his
powers of description and humour are all powerful. May his shadow
never grow less.</i></p>

<p>No matter that de Brune took a year and a half more than he
intended, to complete his walk. In the event, as it often is, the
journey was more significant than reaching the destination. Still,
he must have had some fun in reaching the destination and
celebrating with one or two large glasses of lemon squash.</p>

<p>The shadow of Aidan de Brune (Herbert Charles Cull, to give him
his birth name) <i>did</i> grow less. His name and his achievement
<i>were</i> lost, in the one hundred years since he walked his
amazing walk. It has been a privilege to resurrect the details of
his achievement from almost certain oblivion and to assist in
making his diary and other publications available to all who wish
to read them.</p>

<p class="cp">*<br></p>

<p>In de Brune's diary, underneath J. J. Gay's statement that the
walk was completed, and the compliment by H. Barry, is a note by J.
T. Beckett:</p>

<p class="newspaper"><i>I had the pleasure of meeting Mr de Brune
at Darwin. He had then come through some terrible stages and,
knowing what was ahead of him, thought he was continuing a hopeless
task. While in Darwin Mr de Brune endeavoured to reconcile
industrial troubles, but failed by reason of the active efforts of
certain Government officials, whose desire was to foment them.
Aidan de Brune is one of the gamest men I have ever had the honour
to know.</i>

</p>

<p class="caption">J T Beckett. (J J Gay Papers, State Library of
NSW)</p>

<p>When he met de Brune in Darwin, Beckett had just come in from
Vanderlin Island in the Pellew Group, just off the coast from
Borroloola, Northern Territory.<sup><a href=
"#en144">144</a></sup><a name="ren144" id="ren144"></a></p>

<p>In an article which appeared in the Darwin <i>Northern
Standard</i> on 5 October 1923,<sup><a href=
"#en145">145</a></sup><a name="ren145" id="ren145"></a> when de
Brune was in Penong, South Australia, Beckett caught more than a
glimpse of de Brune. The article appeared when de Brune was about
1700 miles from finishing his walk in Sydney:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Travelling towards us at the average rate of
between fifteen to twenty miles a day is a compact storage packet
of dynamic force known as Aiden (sic) de Brune. This extraordinary human
machine has covered thousands of miles in his walk round Australia,
and is now on the home stretch, somewhere along the coast of the
Great Australian Bight, approaching South Australia's western
border.<br>
<br>
When de Brune set out he attracted no notice. A few hundred miles
further on he was regarded as a homeless tramp, because he looked
like one. In Queensland folks began to take notice of him, and
considered him a crank who would end up dead beat in some back
country town. When he reached the Northern Territory border,
bushmen wanted to know where he was bound for and if he needed any
help. When he got well in after covering a couple of thousand
miles, they asked why he walked when he could steal a horse, and
offered to steal one, or several for him, or give him a few if he
would prefer them as a present.<br>
<br>
When they found that all he needed was friendship, a drink of tea
and a bit of beef and damper now and again, they reasoned with him
and tried to induce him to settle down on good food and water with
them. They had discovered that he could extract from a shanty piano
music that nobody knew was in it; could sing a good song, tell a
good story, squeeze sweet sounds out of a concertina, give some
very excellent advice to those in travail, and generally act like a
being from a better world.<br>
<br>
In Darwin he tried to make peace between two rival unions, and only
realised the impossibility of it when he discovered that the
disturbing element was the Commonwealth Government, and that
factional strife had been deliberately fomented to break industrial
unionism in the interest of moneyed combines. But he earned the
good will of both sides as an honest hearted trier.<br>
<br>
I had just come into Darwin with my wife out of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, where we had been wafted about by sundry cyclonic
disturbances when I got a wire from the <i>Daily Mail</i> asking me
to look out for Aidan de Brune walking round Australia. I expected
to see a superman come striding in with a gun on his hip,
dominating everybody he met with the magnificence of his physique,
and then I forgot all about him. In a month or so a little man, who
was positively droll, came stepping along the [railway] sleepers
into Darwin, followed by a number of aboriginals who wanted to know
what tribe he belonged to. However they soon found out Aiden (sic) de
Brune was a proper white man, and a high grade at that.<br>
<br>
De Brune is under five feet six inches, weighs under nine stone,
and has a face that looks weak. But he also has a will that is
steel. He has arrived at a station hut with a half-eaten goanna in
his belt, and left it with a few johnny cakes, and the undying
friendship of the lonely stockman. When you see him you want to get
away from him. When you speak to him you don't want him to go away
from you. He is a man and a gentleman up and down, and a library of
information. He is a sport among sportsmen and a man of whom the
Australian Journalists' Association should be proud, for he has not
spared himself to get copy.<br>
<br>
Aiden (sic) de Brune has not finished his walk but should he never move
another yard further, he will have put up a record that few, if
any, will ever attempt to equal.</p>

<p class="cp">*<br></p>

<p class="dayhead">5 March 1924.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Standard</i> (Brisbane) reported: <sup><a href=
"#en146">146</a></sup><a name="ren146" id="ren146"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">Aidan de Brune, who left Sydney twenty-nine
months ago to walk around Australia, returned to Sydney yesterday,
having successfully carried out his intention. He looks fit and
well after many hardships and escapes, and in his somewhat
picturesque garb he attracted a great deal of attention as he
walked along the city streets.</p>

<p class="dayhead">9 March 1924.</p>

<p>"Joan" wrote in the diary: <i>Whoever is this sunburned
stranger? Ah, Mr Aidan de Brune. On this day, 9/3/24, Mr de Brune
appeared on our doorstep, springing a surprise on all those
dwelling within. We all spent a pleasant evening, thanks very much
to Mr de Brune's beautiful playing.</i></p>

<p>One wonders whether de Brune carried out the intention, which he
gave in Albany, not to cross Pitt Street without the aid of a motor
car.</p>

A swarm of insects crowd about me, crying<br>

<br>
&mdash;John Le Gay Brereton<br></p>

<p>Little is known about Aidan de Brune following the conclusion of
his walk. We catch a glimpse here and there.</p>

<p>On 28 March 1933 an article by de Brune appeared in the Wagga
Wagga <i>Daily Advertiser</i><sup>(see note 43, at end)</sup> as one of a series of
articles about Australian novelists. The article was about de Brune
himself, in which he outlined his life. It was mostly fictitious.
As we know, de Brune was actually Herbert Charles Cull and he did
few, if any, of the things mentioned in the article.</p>

<p>However, the last paragraph poses the rhetorical question: "My
amusements?" He then answers the question: "Two absorbing ones.
Writing-mystery stories and barracking Federal politicians to
foster a national Australian literature. The first easy; the last
apparently very difficult."</p>

<p>Details of his mystery stories and other articles which he
wrote, appear in the <a href="#ch7.3">bibliography</a>, later in
this book.</p>

<p>Also in 1933, an article appeared in the Port Augusta
<i>Transcontinental,</i> under the heading "Health
Hiking."<sup><a href="#en147">147</a></sup><a name="ren147" id=
"ren147"></a></p>

<p class="newspaper">The inviting sunshine which lured so many
local residents out of doors for the Easter vacation, enticed four
fair Port Augusta disciples of Aidan de Brune, the renowned
globe-trotter, out on a health hike on Monday morning. They left
Port Augusta at 9 a.m. for One Stick Bay&mdash;a fourteen-mile
tramp&mdash;where they arrived at 1 p.m., a little weary but quite
proud of their powers of natural locomotion, and soon forgot their
disappointment at not getting a lift with some sympathetic
motorist.</p>

<p>De Brune's walk was obviously still remembered in Port
Augusta.</p>

<p class="cp">*<br></p>

<p>Herbert Charles Cull, H. F. C. de B. Culle, Aidan de
Brune&mdash; What are we to make of this enigmatic man who could
reel off words by the thousand in writing serialised mystery
stories but who, later, never wrote about his experiences during
two and a half years on the road, <i>per boot</i>.</p>

<p>From his description of the desert in <i>Just a Woolly</i>,
related earlier in this book, and the many descriptions in his
mystery stories, it is obvious that he could have written something
worthwhile. He could have told us what it was like to camp alone,
night after night in the open. He could have told us what it was
like to visit town after town to lecture to the residents about his
travels, to enjoy their company for a short while, and then to move
on. He could have told us when and where he learned to play the
piano, when he picked up his proficiency with words, why he left
England, never to return to his wife and child, why he changed his
identity. Alas, we will probably never know what he thought about
any of it. Why was it that everybody he met had a good word to say
about him in his diary, yet he seemed to prefer his own company so
much of the time?</p>

<p>Percival Searle, who wrote the <i>Dictionary of Australian
Biography</i> in 1949, covering the lives of a thousand people, had
obviously thought about whether <i>he</i> was really capturing
something of the essence of the people he wrote about. He included
the following epigraph to the Dictionary:</p>

<p class="newspaper">When Plutarch placed in noble array, for the
contemplation of ages to come, his images of heroes and sages, or
when Dr Johnson drew that gallery of poets, so many of whom only
survive in his portraiture, the writers must have been conscious
how little of the real men lay behind those strong or graceful
representations, how much that was even faithfully recorded may
convey a false impression, how much was inevitably omitted which
might contradict every deduction and alter every
estimate.<sup><a href="#en148">148</a></sup><a name="ren148" id=
"ren148"></a></p>

<p>It is to be hoped that you, the reader, have caught at least a
glimpse of this fascinating man who possessed the courage and
tenacity to keep walking for two and a half years, often in
unpleasant and even appalling conditions and who then came back to
Sydney and settled down to a life of "<i>writing-mystery stories
and barracking Federal politicians to foster a national Australian
literature</i><i>.</i>"</p>

<h2>De Brune's Diary and Book of
his Walk</h2>

<p>Aidan de Brune converted his travelling diary, or manuscript
journal, into a book titled <i>Record Diary of a Walk Around
Australia</i>. The diary and a copy of the book are held by the
State Library of New South Wales</p>

<p><b>The book</b> consists of typed foolscap pages, bound in a
maroon cover, with gold lettering on the spine. A hand-written note
on the title page of the book states:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The original manuscript journal in four small
pocket books is in the mss. room of the Mitchell Library. Oct.
1924."</p>

<p>The next page of the book (unnumbered), contains the heading for
the commencing section of the walk (New South Wales). It has a
vertical, hand-written, note down the left side of the page, which
states:</p>

<p>"Donated Aidan de Brune 25/10/24"</p>

<p>Following the title page and the unnumbered <i>section</i> page,
are 176 numbered pages, together with six unnumbered pages which
indicate the start of each subsequent section of the walk:
Queensland, Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia,
Victoria, and New South Wales.</p>

<p>This book, <i>The Amateur Tramp</i>, contains many quotations
from <i>Record Diary of a Walk Around Australia,</i> which has been
made available as an ebook by Project Gutenberg Australia. Refer to
the <a href="#ch7.3">bibliography</a> at the end of this book for a

<p class="caption">First page of Aidan de Brune's travel diary.</p>

<p>Entries for each day have been neatly written up and contain
details of the distance walked each day, together with the
cumulative distance walked to the end of each day. Often there are
entries made by people whom de Brune met at his destination, or
along the way, certifying that he was at the place stated, on the
stated day. Sometimes the people making the certification added
well-wishes and other comments.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the diaries survived the walk intact, when
one considers that de Brune walked in all weather, including heavy
rain, and that on many occasions he forded creeks and rivers. On
one occasion, day 230, de Brune notes that two pages are missing
from the diary.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7.2" id="ch7.2"></a>Statistics</h2>

<p>The following statistics have been compiled from figures
appearing in the typescript, <i>Record Journal of a Walk Around
Australia</i>, although they do not appear in the book in the
format presented here. In compiling the statistics, the mileage
walked each day was entered into a spreadsheet. From these figures
the total miles walked, total for each state/territory, cumulative
mileage at the end of each day, and number of days on which de
Brune did not walk, were calculated.</p>

<p>De Brune was remarkably accurate in his arithmetic. A few
non-material errors were made which, in total, had virtually no
effect on the totals. He was as accurate as he could be with
distances. In many cases he had to use his best guess to calculate
the distance travelled in a day. No doubt he was careful to check
his distances with the overall distance between points, which he
found on sign posts, along railways lines or telegraph lines, or on
maps. Whatever the exact total distance he finally travelled, his
was an epic walk. Let us not be churlish about allowing him to
describe it as a walk of "ten thousand miles."</p>
