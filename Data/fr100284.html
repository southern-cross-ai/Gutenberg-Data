<h2><a id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">A MAN stood irresolutely before the imposing
portals of Cainbury House, a large office building let out to
numerous small tenants, and harbouring, as the indicator on the
tiled wall of the vestibule testified, some thirty different
professions. The man was evidently poor, for his clothes were
shabby and his boots were down at heel. He was as evidently a
foreigner. His clean-shaven eagle face was sallow, his eyes were
dark, his eyebrows black and straight.</p>

<p>He passed up the few steps into the hall and stood
thoughtfully before the indicator. Presently he found what he
wanted. At the very top of the list and amongst the crowded
denizens of the fifth floor was a slip inscribed:</p><br>

<p class="sign">"THE GOSSIP'S CORNER"</p><br>

<p>He took from his waistcoat pocket a newspaper cutting and
compared the two then stepped briskly, almost jauntily, into the
hall, as though all his doubts and uncertainties had vanished,
and waited for the elevator. His coat was buttoned tightly, his
collar was frayed, his shirt had seen the greater part of a
week's service, the Derby hat on his head had undergone extensive
renovations, and a close observer would have noticed that his
gloves were odd ones.</p>

<p>He walked into the lift and said, "Fifth floor" with a slight
foreign accent.</p>

<p>He was whirled up, the lift doors clanged open and the grimy
finger of the elevator boy indicated the office. Again the man
hesitated, examining the door carefully. The upper half was of
toughened glass and bore the simple inscription:</p><br>

<p class="sign">"THE GOSSIP'S CORNER. KNOCK."</p><br>

<p>Obediently the stranger knocked and the door opened through an
invisible agent, much to the man's surprise, though there was
nothing more magical about the phenomenon than there is about any
electrically controlled office door.</p>

<p>He found himself in a room sparsely furnished with a table, a
chair and a few copies of papers. An old school map of England
hung on one wall and a Landseer engraving on the other. At the
farthermost end of the room was another door, and to this he
gravitated and again, after a moment's hesitation, he
knocked.</p>

<p>"Come in," said a voice.</p>

<p>He entered cautiously.</p>

<p>The room was larger and was comfortably furnished. There were
shaded electric lamps on either side of the big carved oak
writing-table. One of the walls was covered with books, and the
litter of proofs upon the table suggested that this was the
sanctorum.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable feature of the room was the man who
sat at the desk. He was a man solidly built and, by his voice, of
middle age. His face the new-comer could not see and for
excellent reason. It was hidden behind a veil of fine silk net
which had been adjusted over the head like a loose bag and
tightened under the chin.</p>

<p>The man at the table chuckled when he saw the other's
surprise.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he said&mdash;he spoke in French&mdash;"and don't,
I beg of you, be alarmed."</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said the new-comer easily, "be assured that I am
not alarmed. In this world nothing has ever alarmed me except my
own distressing poverty and the prospect of dying poor."</p>

<p>The veiled figure said nothing for a while.</p>

<p>"You have come in answer to my advertisement," he said after a
long pause.</p>

<p>The other bowed.</p>

<p>"You require an assistant, Monsieur," said the new-comer,
"discreet, with a knowledge of foreign languages and poor. I
fulfil all those requirements," he went on calmly; "had you also
added, of an adventurous disposition, with few if any scruples,
it would have been equally descriptive."</p>

<p>The stranger felt that the man at the desk was looking at him,
though he could not see his eyes. It must have been a long and
careful scrutiny, for presently the advertiser said gruffly:</p>

<p>"I think you'll do."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the new-comer with cool assurance; "and now it
is for you, dear Monsieur, to satisfy me that you also will do.
You will have observed that there are two parties to every
bargain. First of all, my duties?"</p>

<p>The man in the chair leant back and thrust his hands into his
pockets.</p>

<p>"I am the editor of a little paper which circulates
exclusively amongst the servants of the upper classes," he said.
"I receive from time to time interesting communications
concerning the aristocracy and gentry of this country, written by
hysterical French maids and revengeful Italian valets. I am not a
good linguist, and I feel that there is much in these epistles
which I miss and which I should not miss."</p>

<p>The new-comer nodded.</p>

<p>"I therefore want somebody of discretion who will deal with my
foreign correspondence, make a fair copy in English and summarize
the complaints which these good people make. You quite
understand," he said with a shrug of his shoulders, "that mankind
is not perfect, less perfect is womankind, and least perfect is
that section of mankind which employs servants. They usually have
stories to tell not greatly to their masters' credit, not nice
stories, you understand, my dear friend. By the way, what is your
name?"</p>

<p>The stranger hesitated.</p>

<p>"Poltavo," he said after a pause.</p>

<p>"Italian or Pole?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Pole," replied Poltavo readily.</p>

<p>"Well, as I was saying," the editor went on, "we on this paper
are very anxious to secure news of society doings. If they are
printable, we print them; if they are not printable"&mdash;he
paused&mdash;"we do not print them. But," he raised a warning
forefinger, "the fact that particulars of disgraceful happenings
are not fit for publication must not induce you to cast such
stories into the waste-paper basket. We keep a record of such
matters for our own private amusement." He said this latter
airily, but Poltavo was not deceived.</p>

<p>Again there was a long silence whilst the man at the table
ruminated.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" he asked.</p>

<p>"On the fourth floor of a small house in Bloomsbury," replied
Poltavo.</p>

<p>The veiled figure nodded.</p>

<p>"When did you come to this country?"</p>

<p>"Six months ago."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Poltavo shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Why?" insisted the man at the table.</p>

<p>"A slight matter of disagreement between myself and the
admirable chief of police of San Sebastian," he said as airily
as the other.</p>

<p>Again the figure nodded.</p>

<p>"If you had told me anything else, I should not have engaged
you," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Poltavo in surprise.</p>

<p>"Because you are speaking the truth," said the other coolly.
"Your matter of disagreement with the police in Sans Sebastian
was over the missing of some money in the hotel where you were
staying. The room happened to be next to yours and communicating,
if one had the ingenuity to pick the lock of the door. Also your
inability to pay the hotel bill hastened your departure."</p>

<p>"What an editor!" said the other admiringly, but without
showing any signs of perturbation or embarrassment.</p>

<p>"It is my business to know something about everybody," said
the editor. "By the way, you may call me Mr. Brown, and if at
times I may seem absent-minded when I am so addressed you must
excuse me, because it is not my name. Yes, you are the kind of
man I want."</p>

<p>"It is remarkable that you should have found me," said
Poltavo. "The cutting"&mdash;he indicated the newspaper
clip&mdash;"was sent to me by an unknown friend."</p>

<p>"I was the unknown friend," said Mr. Brown; "do you understand
the position?"</p>

<p>Poltavo nodded.</p>

<p>"I understand everything," he said, "except the last and most
important of all matters; namely, the question of my salary."</p>

<p>The man named a sum&mdash;a generous sum to Poltavo, and Mr.
Brown, eyeing him keenly, was glad to note that his new assistant
was neither surprised nor impressed.</p>

<p>"You will see very little of me at this office," the editor
went on. "If you work well, and I can trust you, I will double
the salary I am giving you; if you fail me, you will be sorry for
yourself."</p>

<p>He rose.</p>

<p>"That finishes our interview. You will come here to-morrow
morning and let yourself in. Here is the key of the door and a
key to the safe in which I keep all correspondence. You will find
much to incriminate society and precious little that will
incriminate me. I expect you to devote the whole of your
attention to this business," he said slowly and emphatically.</p>

<p>"You may be sure&mdash;" began Poltavo.</p>

<p>"Wait, I have not finished. By devoting the whole of your
attention to the business, I mean I want you to have no spare
time to conduct any investigations as to my identity. By a method
which I will not trouble to explain to you I am able to leave
this building without any person being aware of the fact that I
am the editor of this interesting publication. When you have been
through your letters I want you to translate those which contain
the most important particulars and forward them by a messenger
who will call every evening at five o'clock. Your salary will be
paid regularly, and you will not be bothered with any editorial
duties. And now, if you will please go into the outer room and
wait a few moments, you may return in five minutes and begin on
this accumulation of correspondence."</p>

<p>Poltavo, with a little bow, obeyed, and closed the door
carefully behind him. He heard a click, and knew that the same
electric control which had opened the outer door had now closed
the inner. At the end of five minutes, as near as he could judge,
he tried the door. It opened readily and he stepped into the
inner office. The room was empty. There was a door leading out to
the corridor, but something told the new assistant that this was
not the manner of egress which his employer had adopted. He
looked round carefully. There was no other door, but behind the
chair where the veiled man had sat was a large cupboard. This he
opened without, however, discovering any solution to the mystery
of Mr. Brown's disappearance, for the cupboard was filled with
books and stationery. He then began a systematic search of the
apartment. He tried all the drawers of the desk and found they
were open, whereupon his interest in their contents evaporated,
since he knew a gentleman of Mr. Brown's wide experience was
hardly likely to leave important particulars concerning himself
in an unlocked desk. Poltavo shrugged his shoulders, deftly
rolling a cigarette, which he lit, then pulling the chair up to
the desk he began to attack the pile of letters which awaited his
attention.</p>

<p>For six weeks Mr. Poltavo had worked with painstaking
thoroughness in the new service. Every Friday morning he had
found on his desk an envelope containing two bank notes neatly
folded and addressed to himself. Every evening at five o'clock a
hard-faced messenger had called and received a bulky envelope
containing Poltavo's translations.</p>

<p>The Pole was a keen student of the little paper, which he
bought every week, and he had noted that very little of the
information he had gleaned appeared in print. Obviously then
Gossip's Corner served Mr. Brown in some other way than as a
vehicle for scandal, and the veil was partly lifted on this
mysterious business on an afternoon when there had come a sharp
tap at the outer door of the office. Poltavo pressed the button
on the desk, which released the lock, and presently the tap was
repeated on the inside door.</p>

<p>The door opened and a girl stood in the entrance
hesitating.</p>

<p>"Won't you come in?" said Poltavo, rising.</p>

<p>"Are you the editor of this paper?" asked the girl, as she
slowly closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>Poltavo bowed. He was always ready to accept whatever honour
chance bestowed upon him. Had she asked him if he were Mr. Brown,
he would also have bowed.</p>

<p>"I had a letter from you," said the girl, coming to the other
side of the table and resting her hand on its edge and looking
down at him a little scornfully, and a little fearfully, as
Poltavo thought.</p>

<p>He bowed again. He had not written letters to anybody save to
his employer, but his conscience was an elastic one.</p>

<p>"I write so many letters," he said airily, "that I really
forget whether I have written to you or not. May I see the
letter?"</p>

<p>She opened her bag, took out an envelope, removed the letter
and passed it across to the interested young man. It was written
on the note-heading of Gossip's Corner, but the address had been
scratched out by a stroke of the pen. It ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">
Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">Certain very important information has come
into my possession regarding the relationships between yourself
and Captain Brackly. I feel sure you cannot know that your name
is being associated with that officer. As the daughter and
heiress of the late Sir George Billk, you may imagine that your
wealth and position in society relieves you of criticism, but I
can assure you that the stories which have been sent to me would,
were they placed in the hands of your husband, lead to the most
unhappy consequences.</p>

<p class="letter">In order to prevent this matter going any
further, and in order to silence the voices of your detractors,
our special inquiry department is willing to undertake the
suppression of these scandalmongers. It will cost you £10,000,
which should be paid to me in notes. If you agree, put an
advertisement in the agony column of the Morning Mist, and I will
arrange a meeting where the money can be paid over. On no account
address me at my office or endeavour to interview me there.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">J. Brown.</span></p>

<p><br>
Poltavo read the letter and now the function of Gossip's
Corner was very clear. He refolded the letter and handed it back
to the girl.</p>

<p>"I may not be very clever," said the visitor, "but I think I
can understand what blackmail is when I see it."</p>

<p>Poltavo was in a quandary, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>"I did not write that letter," he said suavely; "it was
written without my knowledge. When I said that I was the editor
of this paper, I meant, of course, that I was the acting editor.
Mr. Brown conducts his business quite independently of myself. I
know all the circumstances," he added hastily, since he was very
anxious that the girl should not refuse him further information
in the belief that he was an inconsiderable quantity, "and I
sympathize with you most sincerely."</p>

<p>A little smile curled the lips of the visitor.</p>

<p>Poltavo was ever a judge of men and women, and he knew that
this was no yielding, timid creature to be terrified by the fear
of exposure.</p>

<p>"The matter can be left in the hands of Captain Brackly and my
husband to settle," she said. "I am going to take the letter to
my solicitors. I shall also show it to the two men most
affected."</p>

<p>Now the letter had been written four days earlier, as Poltavo
had seen, and he argued that if it had not been revealed to these
"two men most affected" in the first heat of the lady's anger and
indignation, it would never be shown at all.</p>

<p>"I think you are very wise," he said suavely, "After all, what
is a little unpleasantness of that character? Who cares about the
publication of a few letters?"</p>

<p>"Has he got letters?" asked the girl quickly, with a change of
tone.</p>

<p>Poltavo bowed again.</p>

<p>"Will they be returned?" she asked.</p>

<p>Poltavo nodded, and the girl bit her lips thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I see," she said.</p>

<p>She looked at the letter again and without another word went
out.</p>

<p>Poltavo accompanied her to the outer door.</p>

<p>"It is the prettiest kind of blackmail," she said at parting,
and she spoke without heat. "I have only now to consider which
will pay me best."</p>

<p>The Pole closed the door behind her and walked back to his
inner office, opened the door and stood aghast, for sitting in
the chair which he had so recently vacated was the veiled
man.</p>

<p>He was chuckling, partly at Poltavo's surprise, partly at some
amusing thought.</p>

<p>"Well done, Poltavo," he said; "excellently fenced."</p>

<p>"Did you hear?" asked the Pole, surprised in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>"Every word," said the other. "Well, what do you think of
it?"</p>

<p>Poltavo pulled a chair from the wall and sat down facing his
chief.</p>

<p>"I think it is very clever," he said admiringly, "but I also
think I am not getting sufficient salary."</p>

<p>The veiled man nodded.</p>

<p>"I think you are right," he agreed, "and I will see that it is
increased. What a fool the woman was to come here!"</p>

<p>"Either a fool or a bad actress," said Poltavo.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the other quickly.</p>

<p>Poltavo shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"To my mind," he said after a moment's thought, "there is no
doubt that I have witnessed a very clever comedy. An effective
one, I grant, because it has accomplished all that was
intended."</p>

<p>"And what was intended?" asked Mr. Brown curiously.</p>

<p>"It was intended by you and carried out by you in order to
convey to me the exact character of your business," said Poltavo.
"I judged that fact from the following evidence." He ticked off
the points one by one on his long white fingers. "The lady's name
was, according to the envelope, let us say, Lady Cruxbury; but
the lady's real name, according to some silver initials on her
bag, began with 'G.' Those initials I also noted on the little
handkerchief she took from her bag. Therefore she was not the
person to whom the letter was addressed, or if she was, the
letter was a blind. In such an important matter Lady Cruxbury
would come herself. My own view is that there is no Lady
Cruxbury, that the whole letter was concocted and was delivered
to me whilst you were watching me from some hiding place in order
to test my discretion, and, as I say, to make me wise in the ways
of your admirable journal."</p>

<p>Mr. Brown laughed long and softly.</p>

<p>"You are a clever fellow, Poltavo," he said admiringly, "and
you certainly deserve your rise of salary. Now I am going to be
frank with you. I admit that the whole thing was a blind. You now
know my business, and you now know my raison d'etre, so to speak.
Are you willing to continue?"</p>

<p>"At a price," said the other.</p>

<p>"Name it," said the veiled man quietly.</p>

<p>"I am a poor adventurer," began Poltavo; "my life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut all that stuff out," said Mr. Brown roughly, "I am not
going to give you a fortune. I am going to give you the
necessities of life and a little comfort."</p>

<p>Poltavo walked to the window and thrusting his hands deep into
his trouser pockets stared out. Presently he turned. "The
necessities of life to me," he said, "are represented by a flat
in St James's Street, a car, a box at the Opera.</p>

<p>"You will get none of these," interrupted Mr. Brown. "Be
reasonable."</p>

<p>Poltavo smiled.</p>

<p>"I am worth a fortune to you," he said, "because I have
imagination. Here, for example." He picked out a letter from a
heap on the desk and opened it. The caligraphy was typically
Latin and the handwriting was vile. "Here is a letter from an
Italian," he said, "which to the gross mind may perhaps represent
wearisome business details. To a mind of my calibre, it is
clothed in rich possibilities." He leaned across the table; his
eyes lighted up with enthusiasm. "There may be an enormous
fortune in this," and he tapped the letter slowly. "Here is a man
who desires the great English newspaper, of which he has heard
(though Heaven only knows how he can have heard it), to discover
the whereabouts and the identity of a certain M. Fallock."</p>

<p>The veiled man started.</p>

<p>"Fallock," he repeated.</p>

<p>Poltavo nodded.</p>

<p>"Our friend Fallock has built a house 'of great wonder,' to
quote the letter of our correspondent. In this house are buried
millions of lira&mdash;doesn't that fire your imagination, dear
colleague?"</p>

<p>"Built a house, did he?" repeated the other.</p>

<p>"Our friends tell me," Poltavo went on,&mdash;"did I tell you
it was written on behalf of two men?&mdash;that they have a clue
and in fact that they know Mr. Fallock's address, and they are
sure he is engaged in a nefarious business, but they require
confirmation of their knowledge."</p>

<p>The man at the table was silent.</p>

<p>His fingers drummed nervously on the blotting pad and his head
was sunk forward as a man weighing a difficult problem.</p>

<p>"All child's talk," he said roughly, "these buried
treasures!&mdash;I have heard of them before. They are just two
imaginative foreigners. I suppose they want you to advance their
fare?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly what they do ask," said Poltavo.</p>

<p>The man at the desk laughed uneasily behind his veil and
rose.</p>

<p>"It's the Spanish prison trick," he said; "surely you are not
deceived by that sort of stuff?"</p>

<p>Poltavo shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Speaking as one who has also languished in a Spanish prison,"
he smiled, "and who has also sent out invitations to the generous
people of England to release him from his sad position&mdash;a
release which could only be made by generous payments&mdash;I
thoroughly understand the delicate workings of that particular
fraud; but we robbers of Spain, dear colleague, do not write in
our native language, we write in good, or bad, English. We write
not in vilely spelt Italian because we know that the recipient of
our letter will not take the trouble to get it translated. No,
this is no Spanish prison trick. This is genuine."</p>

<p>"May I see the letter?"</p>

<p>Poltavo handed it across the table, and the man turning his
back for a moment upon his assistant lifted his veil and read. He
folded the letter and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"I will think about it," he said gruffly.</p>

<p>"Another privilege I would crave from you in addition to the
purely nominal privilege of receiving more salary," said
Poltavo.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>The Pole spread out his hands in a gesture of
self-deprecation.</p>

<p>"It is weak of me, I admit," he said, "but I am
anxious&mdash;foolishly anxious&mdash;to return to the society of
well-clothed men and pretty women. I pine for social life. It is
a weakness of mine," he added apologetically. "I want to meet
stockbrokers, financiers, politicians and other chevaliers
d'industrie on equal terms, to wear the grande habit, to listen
to soft music, to drink good wine."</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the other suspiciously. "What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Introduce me to society," said Poltavo sweetly&mdash;"most
particularly do I desire to meet that merchant prince of whose
operations I read in the newspapers, Mr. how-do-you-call-him?
&mdash;Farrington."</p>

<p>The veiled man sat in silence for a good minute, and then he
rose, opened the cupboard and put in his hand. There was a click
and the cupboard with its interior swung back, revealing another
room which was in point of fact an adjoining suite of offices,
also rented by Mr. Brown. He stood silently in the opening, his
chin on his breast, his hands behind him, then:</p>

<p>"You are very clever, Poltavo," he said, and passed through
and the cupboard swung back in its place.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">"ASSASSIN!"</p>

<p>This was the cry which rang out in the stillness of the night,
and aroused the interest of one inhabitant of Brakely Square who
was awake. Mr. Gregory Farrington, a victim of insomnia, heard
the sound, and put down the book he was reading, with a frown. He
rose from his easy chair, pulled his velvet dressing gown lightly
round his rotund form and shuffled to the window. His blinds were
lowered, but these were of the ordinary type, and he stuck two
fingers between two of the laths.</p>

<p>There was a moist film on the window through which the street
lamps showed blurred and indistinct, and he rubbed the pane clear
with the tips of his fingers (he described every action to T.B.
Smith afterwards).</p>

<p>Two men stood outside the house. They occupied the centre of
the deserted pavement, and they were talking excitedly. Through
the closed window Mr. Farrington could hear the staccato rattle
of their voices, and by the gesticulations, familiar to one who
had lived for many years in a Latin country, he gathered that
they were of that breed.</p>

<p>He saw one raise his hand to strike the other and caught the
flash of a pistol-barrel excitedly flourished.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Mr. Farrington.</p>

<p>He was alone in his beautiful house in Brakely Square. His
butler, the cook, and one sewing maid and the chauffeur were
attending the servants' ball which the Manley-Potters were
giving. Louder grew the voices on the pavement.</p>

<p>"Thief!" shrilled a voice in French, "Am I to be robbed
of&mdash;" and the rest was indistinguishable.</p>

<p>There was a policeman on point duty at the other side of the
square. Mr. Farrington's fingers rubbed the glass with greater
energy, and his anxious eyes looked left and right for the
custodian of the law.</p>

<p>He crept down the stairs, opened the metal flap of the
letter-box and listened. It was not difficult to hear all they
said, though they had dropped their voices, for they stood at the
foot of the steps.</p>

<p>"What is the use?" said one in French. "There is a reward
large enough for two&mdash;but for him&mdash;my faith! there is
money to be made, sufficient for twenty. It is unfortunate that
we should meet on similar errands, but I swear to you I did not
desire to betray you&mdash;" The voice sank.</p>

<p>Mr. Farrington chewed the butt of his cigar in the darkness of
the hall and pieced together the jigsaw puzzle of this disjointed
conversation. These men must be associates of
Montague&mdash;Montague Fallock, who else?</p>

<p>Montague Fallock, the blackmailer for whom the police of
Europe were searching, and individually and separately they had
arranged to blackmail him&mdash;or betray him.</p>

<p>The fact that T.B. Smith also had a house in Brakely Square,
and that T.B. Smith was an Assistant Commissioner of the police,
and most anxious to meet Montague Fallock in the flesh, might
supply reason enough to the logical Mr. Farrington for this
conversation outside his respectable door.</p>

<p>"Yes, I tell you," said the second man, angrily, "that I have
arranged to see M'sieur&mdash;you must trust me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We go together," said the other, definitely, "I trust no man,
least of all a confounded Neapolitan&mdash;"</p>

<p>Constable Habit had not heard the sound of quarrelling voices,
as far as could be gathered from subsequent inquiry. His
statement, now in the possession of T.B. Smith, distinctly says,
"I heard nothing unusual."</p>

<p>But suddenly two shots rang out.</p>

<p>"Clack&mdash;clack!" they went, the unmistakable sound of an
automatic pistol or pistols, then a police whistle shrieked, and
P. C. Habit broke into a run in the direction of the sound,
blowing his own whistle as he ran.</p>

<p>He arrived to find three men, two undoubtedly dead on the
ground, and the third, Mr. Farrington's unpicturesque figure,
standing shivering in the doorway of his house, a police whistle
at his lips, and his grey velvet dressing-gown flapping in a
chill eastern wind.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later T.B. Smith arrived on the scene from his
house, to find a crowd of respectable size, half the bedroom
windows of Brakely Square occupied by the morbid and the curious,
and the police ambulance already on the spot.</p>

<p>"Dead, sir," reported the constable.</p>

<p>T.B. looked at the men on the ground. They were obviously
foreigners. One was well, almost richly dressed; the other wore
the shabby evening dress of a waiter, under the long ulster which
covered him from neck to foot.</p>

<p>The men lay almost head to head. One flat on his face (he had
been in this position when the constable found him, and had been
restored to that position when the methodical P. C. Habit found
that he was beyond human assistance) and the other huddled on his
side.</p>

<p>The police kept the crowd at a distance whilst the head of the
secret police (T.B. Smith's special department merited that
description) made a careful examination. He found a pistol on the
ground, and another under the figure of the huddled man, then as
the police ambulance was backed to the pavement, he interviewed
the shivering Mr. Farrington.</p>

<p>"If you will come upstairs," said that chilled millionaire, "I
will tell you all I know."</p>

<p>T.B. sniffed the hall as he entered, but said nothing. He had
his olfactory sense developed to an abnormal degree, but he was a
tactful and a silent man.</p>

<p>He knew Mr. Farrington&mdash;who did not?&mdash;both as a new
neighbour and as the possessor of great wealth.</p>

<p>"Your daughter&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"My ward," corrected Mr. Farrington, as he switched on all the
lights of his sitting-room, "she is out&mdash;in fact she is
staying the night with my friend Lady Constance Dex&mdash;do you
know her?"</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"I can only give you the most meagre information," said Mr.
Farrington. He was white and shaky, a natural state for a
law-abiding man who had witnessed wilful murder. "I heard voices
and went down to the door, thinking I would find a
policeman&mdash;then I heard two shots almost simultaneously,
and opened the door and found the two men as they were found by
the policeman."</p>

<p>"What were they talking about?"</p>

<p>Mr. Farrington hesitated.</p>

<p>"I hope I am not going to be dragged into this case as a
witness?" he asked, rather than asserted, but received no
encouragement in the spoken hope from T.B. Smith.</p>

<p>"They were discussing that notorious man, Montague Fallock,"
said the millionaire; "one was threatening to betray him to the
police."</p>

<p>"Yes," said T.B. It was one of those "yesses" which signified
understanding and conviction.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he asked:</p>

<p>"Who was the third man?"</p>

<p>Mr. Farrington's face went from white to red, and to white
again.</p>

<p>"The third man?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"I mean the man who shot those two," said T.B., "because if
there is one thing more obvious than another it is that they were
both killed by a third person. You see," he went on, "though they
had pistols neither had been discharged&mdash;that was evident,
because on each the safety catch was raised. Also the lamp-post
near which they stood was chipped by a bullet which neither could
have fired I suggest, Mr. Farrington, that there was a third man
present. Do you object to my searching your house?"</p>

<p>A little smile played across the face of the other.</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest objection," he said "Where will you
start?"</p>

<p>"In the basement," said T.B.; "that is to say, in your
kitchen."</p>

<p>The millionaire led the way down the stairs, and descended the
back stairway which led to the domain of the absent cook. He
turned on the electric light as they entered.</p>

<p>There was no sign of an intruder.</p>

<p>"That is the cellar door," indicated Mr. Farrington, "this the
larder, and this leads to the area passage. It is locked."</p>

<p>T.B. tried the handle, and the door opened readily.</p>

<p>"This at any rate is open," he said, and entered the dark
passageway.</p>

<p>"A mistake on the part of the butler," said the puzzled Mr.
Farrington. "I have given the strictest orders that all these
doors should be fastened. You will find the area door bolted and
chained."</p>

<p>T.B. threw the rays of his electric torch over the door.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem to be," he remarked; "in fact, the door is
ajar."</p>

<p>Farrington gasped.</p>

<p>"Ajar?" he repeated. T.B. stepped out into the well of the
tiny courtyard. It was approached from the street by a flight of
stone stairs.</p>

<p>T.B. threw the circle of his lamp over the flagged yard. He
saw something glittering and stooped to pick it up. The object
was a tiny gold-capped bottle such as forms part of the
paraphernalia in a woman's handbag.</p>

<p>He lifted it to his nose and sniffed it.</p>

<p>"That is it," he said.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Mr. Farrington, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"The scent I detected in your hall," replied T.B. "A peculiar
scent, is it not?" He raised the bottle to his nose again. "Not
your ward's by any chance?"</p>

<p>Farrington shook his head vigorously.</p>

<p>"Doris has never been in this area in her life," he said;
"besides, she dislikes perfumes."</p>

<p>T.B. slipped the bottle in his pocket.</p>

<p>Further examination discovered no further clue as to the third
person, and T.B. followed his host back to the study.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" asked Mr. Farrington.</p>

<p>T.B. did not answer immediately. He walked to the window and
looked out. The little crowd which had been attracted by the
shots and arrival of the police ambulance had melted away. The
mist which had threatened all the evening had rolled into the
square and the street lamps showed yellow through the dingy
haze.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "that I have at last got on the track of
Montague Fallock."</p>

<p>Mr. Farrington looked at him with open mouth.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that?" he asked incredulously.</p>

<p>T.B. inclined his head.</p>

<p>"The open door below&mdash;the visitor?" jerked the stout man,
"you don't think Montague Fallock was in the house to-night?"</p>

<p>T.B. nodded again, and there was a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"He has been blackmailing me," said Mr. Farrington,
thoughtfully, "but I don't think&mdash;"</p>

<p>The detective turned up his coat collar preparatory to
leaving.</p>

<p>"I have a rather unpleasant job," he said. "I shall have to
search those unfortunate men."</p>

<p>Mr. Farrington shivered. "Beastly," he said, huskily.</p>

<p>T.B. glanced round the beautiful apartment with its silver
fittings, its soft lights and costly panellings. A rich, warm
fire burnt in an oxidized steel grate. The floor was a patchwork
of Persian rugs, and a few pictures which adorned the walls must
have been worth a fortune.</p>

<p>On the desk there was a big photograph in a plain silver
frame&mdash;the photograph of a handsome woman in the prime of
life.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said T.B., and crossed to the picture, "this
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lady Constance Dex," said the other, shortly&mdash;"a great
friend of mine and my ward's."</p>

<p>"Is she in town?'"</p>

<p>Mr. Farrington shook his head.</p>

<p>"She is at Great Bradley," he said; "her brother is the rector
there."</p>

<p>"Great Bradley?"</p>

<p>T.B.'s frown showed an effort to recollect something.</p>

<p>"Isn't that the locality which contains the Secret House?"</p>

<p>"I've heard something about the place," said Mr. Farrington
with a little smile.</p>

<p>"C.D.," said the detective, making for the door.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Lady Constance Dex's initials, I mean," said T.B.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Those are the initials on the gold scent bottle, that is
all," said the detective. "Good night"</p>

<p>He left Mr. Farrington biting his finger nails&mdash;a habit
he fell into when he was seriously perturbed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">T.B. SMITH sat alone in his office in Scotland
Yard. Outside, the Embankment, the river, even the bulk of the
Houses of Parliament were blotted out by the dense fog. For two
days London had lain under the pall, and if the weather experts
might be relied upon, yet another two days of fog was to be
expected.</p>

<p>The cheery room, with its polished oak panelling and the
chaste elegance of its electroliers, offered every inducement to
a lover of comfort to linger. The fire glowed bright and red in
the tiled fireplace, a silver clock on the mantelpiece ticked
musically, and at his hand was a white-covered tray with a tiny
silver teapot, and the paraphernalia necessary for preparing his
meal&mdash;that strange tea-supper which was one of T.B. Smith's
eccentricities.</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock; the hands pointed to twenty-five
minutes past one.</p>

<p>He pressed a little button let into the side of the desk, and
a few seconds later there was a gentle tap at the door, and a
helmetless constable appeared. "Go to the record room and get
me"&mdash;he consulted a slip of paper on the desk&mdash;"Number
G794I."</p>

<p>The man withdrew noiselessly, and T.B. Smith poured out a cup
of tea for himself.</p>

<p>There was a thoughtful line on his broad forehead, a look of
unaccustomed worry on the handsome face, tanned with the suns of
Southern France. He had come back from his holiday to a task
which required the genius of a superman. He had to establish the
identity of the greatest swindler of modern times, Montague
Fallock. And now another reason existed for his search. To
Montague Fallock, or his agent, must be ascribed the death of two
men found in Brakely Square the night before.</p>

<p>No man had seen Montague; there was no photograph to assist
the army of detectives who were seeking him. His agents had been
arrested and interrogated, but they were but the agents of
agents. The man himself was invisible. He stood behind a steel
network of banks and lawyers and anonymities, unreachable.</p>

<p>The constable returned, bearing under his arm a little black
leather envelope, and, depositing it on the desk of the Assistant
Commissioner, withdrew.</p>

<p>T.B. opened the envelope and removed three neat packages tied
with red tape. He unfastened one of these and laid three cards
before him. They were three photographic enlargements of a finger
print. It did not need the eye of an expert to see they were of
the same finger, though it was obvious that they had been made
under different circumstances.</p>

<p>T.B. compared them with a smaller photograph he had taken from
his pocket. Yes, there was no doubt about it. The four pictures,
secured by a delicate process from the almost invisible print on
the latest letter of the blackmailer, proved beyond any doubt the
identity of Lady Dex's correspondent.</p>

<p>He rang the bell again and the constable appeared in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Ela in his office?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He's been taking information about that Dock
case."</p>

<p>"Dock case? Oh yes, I remember; two men were caught rifling
the Customs store; they shot a dock constable and got away."</p>

<p>"They both got away, sir," said the man, "but one was shot by
the constable's mate; they found his blood on the pavement
outside where their motor-car was waiting."</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"Ask Mr. Ela to come in when he is through," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Ela was evidently "through," for almost immediately after
the message had gone, the long, melancholy face of the
superintendent appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Come in, Ela," smiled T.B.; "tell me all your troubles."</p>

<p>"My main trouble," replied Ela, as he sank Wearily into the
padded chair, "is to induce eyewitnesses to agree as to details;
there is absolutely no clue as to the identity of the robbers,
and nearly murderers. The number of the car was a spurious one,
and was not traced beyond Limehouse. I am up against a blank
wall. The only fact I have to go upon is the very certain fact
that one of the robbers was either wounded or killed and carried
to the car by his friend, and that his body will have to turn up
somewhere or other&mdash;then we may have something to go
on."</p>

<p>"If it should prove to be that of my friend Montague Fallock,"
said T.B. humorously, "I shall be greatly relieved. What were
your thieves after&mdash;bullion?"</p>

<p>"Hardly! No, they seem to be fairly prosaic pilferers. They
engaged in going through a few trunks&mdash;part of the personal
baggage of the Mandavia which arrived from Coast ports on the day
previous. The baggage was just heavy truck; the sort of thing
that a passenger leaves in the docks for a day or two till he has
arranged for their carriage. The trunks disturbed included one
of the First Secretary to a High Commissioner in Congoland, a
dress basket of a Mrs. Somebody-or-other whose name I
forget&mdash;she is the wife of a Commissioner&mdash;and a small
box belonging to Dr. Goldworthy, who has just come back from the
Congo where he has been investigating sleeping sickness."</p>

<p>"Doesn't sound thrilling," said T.B. thoughtfully; "but why do
swagger criminals come in their motor-cars with their pistols and
masks&mdash;they were masked if I remember the printed account
aright?" Ela nodded. "Why do they come on so prosaic an
errand?"</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Ela, laconically, then, "What is your
trouble?"</p>

<p>"Montague," said the other, with a grim smile, "Montague
Fallock, Esquire. He has been demanding a modest ten thousand
pounds from Lady Constance Dex&mdash;Lady Constance being a
sister of the Hon. and Rev. Jerry Dex, Vicar of Great Bradley.
The usual threat&mdash;exposure of an old love affair.</p>

<p>"Dex is a large, bland aristocrat under the thumb of his
sister; the lady, a masterful woman, still beautiful; the
indiscretion partly atoned by the death of the man. He died in
Africa. Those are the circumstances that count. The brother
knows, but our friend Montague will have it that the world should
know. He threatens to murder, if necessary, should she betray his
demands to the police. This is not the first time he has uttered
this threat. Farrington, the millionaire, was the last man, and
curiously, a friend of Lady Dex."</p>

<p>"It's weird&mdash;the whole business," mused Ela. "The two men
you found in the square didn't help you?"</p>

<p>T.B., pacing the apartment with his hand in his pocket, shook
his head.</p>

<p>"Ferreira de Coasta was one, and Henri Sans the other. Both
men undoubtedly in the employ of Montague, at some time or other.
The former was a well-educated man, who may have acted as
intermediary. He was an architect who recently got into trouble
in Paris over money matters. Sans was a courier agent, a more or
less trusted messenger. There was nothing on either body to lead
me to Montague Fallock, save this."</p>

<p>He pulled open the drawer of his desk and produced a small
silver locket. It was engraved in the ornate style of cheap
jewellery and bore a half-obliterated monogram.</p>

<p>He pried open the leaf of the locket with his thumbnail. There
was nothing in its interior save a small white disc.</p>

<p>"A little gummed label," explained T.B., "but the inscription
is interesting."</p>

<p>Ela held the locket to the light, and read:</p>

<p>"Mor: Cot.<br> God sav the Keng."</p>

<p>"Immensely patriotic, but unintelligible and illiterate," said
T.B., slipping the medallion into his pocket, and locking away
the dossier in one of the drawers of his desk.</p>

<p>Ela yawned.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry&mdash;I'm rather sleepy. By the way, isn't Great
Bradley, about which you were speaking, the home of a
romance?"</p>

<p>T.B. nodded with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"It is the town which shelters the Secret House," he said, as
he rose, "but the eccentricities of lovesick Americans, who build
houses equally eccentric, are not matters for police
investigation. You can share my car on a fog-breaking expedition
as far as Chelsea," he added, as he slipped into his overcoat and
pulled on his gloves; "we may have the luck to run over
Montague."</p>

<p>"You are in the mood for miracles," said Ela, as they were
descending the stairs.</p>

<p>"I am in the mood for bed," replied T.B. truthfully. Outside
the fog was so thick that the two men hesitated. T.B.'s chauffeur
was a wise and patient constable, but felt in his wisdom that
patience would be wasted on an attempt to reach Chelsea.</p>

<p>"It's thick all along the road, sir," he said. "I've just
'phoned through to Westminster Police Station, and they say it is
madness to attempt to take a car through the fog."</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"I'll sleep here," he said. "You'd better bed down somewhere,
David, and you, Ela?"</p>

<p>"I'll take a little walk in the park," said the sarcastic Mr.
Ela.</p>

<p>T.B. went back to his room, Ela following.</p>

<p>He switched on the light, but stood still in the doorway. In
the ten minutes' absence some one had been there. Two drawers of
the desk had been forced; the floor was littered with papers
flung there hurriedly by the searcher.</p>

<p>T.B. stepped swiftly to the desk&mdash;the envelope had
gone.</p>

<p>A window was open and the fog was swirling into the room.</p>

<p>"There's blood here," said Mr. Ela. He pointed to the dappled
blotting pad.</p>

<p>"Cut his hand on the glass," said T.B. and jerked his head to
the broken pane in the window. He peered out through the open
casement. A hook ladder, such as American firemen use, was
hanging to the parapet. So thick was the fog that it was
impossible to see how long the ladder was, but the two men pulled
it up with scarcely an effort. It was made of a stout light wood,
with short steel brackets affixed at intervals.</p>

<p>"Blood on this too," said Ela, then, to the constable who had
come to his ring, he jerked his orders rapidly: "Inspector on
duty to surround the office with all the reserve&mdash;'phone
Cannon Row all men available to circle Scotland Yard, and to take
into custody a man with a cut hand&mdash;'phone all stations to
that effect."</p>

<p>"There's little chance of getting our friend," said T.B. He
took up a magnifying glass and examined the stains on the
pad.</p>

<p>"Who was he?" asked Ela.</p>

<p>T.B. pointed to the stain.</p>

<p>"Montague," he said, briefly, "and he now knows the very thing
I did not wish him to know."</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>T.B. did not speak for a moment. He stood looking down at the
evidence which the intruder had left behind.</p>

<p>"He knows how much I know," he said, grimly, "but he may also
imagine I know more&mdash;there are going to be
developments."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">IT was a bad night in London, not wild or
turbulent, but swathed to the eyes like an Eastern woman in a
soft grey garment of fog. It engulfed the walled canyons of the
city, through which the traffic had roared all day, plugged up
the maze of dark side-streets, and blotted out the open squares.
Close to the ground it was thick, viscous, impenetrable, so that
one could not see a yard ahead, and walked ghostlike, adventuring
into a strange world.</p>

<p>Occasionally it dispersed. In front of the Jollity Theatre
numbers of arc-lights wrought a wavering mist-hung yellow space,
into which a constant line of vehicles, like monstrous shiny
beetles, emerged from the outer nowhere, disgorged their
contents, and were eclipsed again. And pedestrians in gay
processional streamed across the ruddy glistening patch like
figures on a slide.</p>

<p>Conspicuous in the shifting throng was a sharp-faced boy,
ostensibly selling newspapers, but with a keen eye upon the
arriving vehicles. Suddenly he darted to the curb, where an
electric coupe had just drawn up. A man alighted heavily, and
turned to assist a young woman.</p>

<p>For an instant the lad's attention was deflected by the
radiant vision. The girl, wrapped in a voluminous cloak of ivory
colour, was tall and slim, with soft white throat and graceful
neck; her eyes under shadowy lashes were a little narrow, but
blue as autumn mist, and sparkling now with amusement.</p>

<p>"Watch your steps, auntie," she warned laughingly, as a plump,
elderly, little lady stepped stiffly from the coupe. "These
London fogs are dangerous."</p>

<p>The boy stood staring at her, his feet as helpless as if they
had taken root to the ground. Suddenly he remembered his mission.
His native impudence reasserted itself, and he started
forward.</p>

<p>"Paper, sir?"</p>

<p>He addressed the man. For a moment it seemed as though he were
to be rebuffed, then something in the boy's attitude changed his
mind.</p>

<p>As the man fumbled in an inner pocket for change, the lad took
a swift inventory. The face beneath the tall hat was a powerful
oval, paste-coloured, with thin lips, and heavy lines from
nostril to jaw. The eyes were close set and of a turbid grey.</p>

<p>"It's him," the boy assured himself, and opened his mouth to
speak.</p>

<p>The girl laughed amusedly at the spectacle of her companion's
passion for news in this grimy atmosphere, and turned to the
young man in evening dress who had just dismissed his taxi and
joined the group.</p>

<p>It was the diversion the boy had prayed for. He took a quick
step toward the older man.</p>

<p>"T.B. S.," he said, in a soft but distinct undertone.</p>

<p>The man's face blanched suddenly, and a coin which he held in
his large, white-gloved palm slipped jingling to the
pavement.</p>

<p>The young messenger stooped and caught it dexterously.</p>

<p>"T.B. S.," he whispered again, insistently.</p>

<p>"Here?" the answer came hoarsely. The man's lips trembled.</p>

<p>"Watchin' this theatre&mdash;splits [*] by the million,"
finished the boy promptly, and with satisfaction. Under cover of
returning the coin, he thrust a slip of white paper into the
other's hand.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Splits: detectives.]</p>

<p>Then he wheeled, ducked to the girl with a gay little swagger
of impudence, threw a lightning glance of scrutiny at her young
escort, and turning, was lost in the throng.</p>

<p>The whole incident occupied less than a minute, and presently
the four were seated in their box, and the gay strains from the
overture of The Strand Girl came floating up to them.</p>

<p>"I wish I were a little street gamin in London," said the girl
pensively, fingering the violets at her corsage. "Think of the
adventures! Don't you, Frank?"</p>

<p>Frank Doughton looked across at her with smiling significant
eyes, which brought a flush to her cheeks.</p>

<p>"No," he said softly, "I do not!"</p>

<p>The girl laughed at him and shrugged her round white
shoulders.</p>

<p>"For a young journalist, Frank, you are too obvious&mdash;too
delightfully verdant. You should study indirection, subtlety,
finesse&mdash;study our mutual friend Count Poltavo!"</p>

<p>She meant it mischievously, and produced the effect she
desired.</p>

<p>At the name the young man's brow darkened.</p>

<p>"He isn't coming here to-night?" Doughton asked, in aggrieved
tones.</p>

<p>The girl nodded, her eyes dancing with laughter.</p>

<p>"What can you see in that man, Doris?" he protested. "I'll bet
you anything you like that the fellow's a rogue! A smooth,
soft-smiling rascal! Lady Dinsmore," he appealed to the elder
woman, "do you like him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't ask Aunt Patricia!" cried the girl. "She thinks him
quite the most fascinating man in London. Don't deny it,
auntie!"</p>

<p>"I shan't," said the lady, calmly, "for it's true! Count
Poltavo"&mdash;she paused, to inspect through her lorgnette some
new-comers in the opposite box, where she got just a glimpse of a
grey dress in the misty depths of the box, the whiteness of a
gloved hand lying upon the box's edge&mdash;"Count Poltavo is the
only interesting man in London. He is a genius." She shut her
lorgnette with a snap. "It delights me to talk with him. He
smiles and murmurs gay witticisms and quotes Talleyrand and
Lucullus, and all the while, in the back of his head, quite out
of reach, his real opinions of you are being tabulated and ranged
neatly in a row like bottles on a shelf."</p>

<p>Doris nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I'd like to take down some of those bottles," she said. "Some
day perhaps I shall."</p>

<p>"They're probably labelled poison," remarked Frank viciously.
He looked at the girl with a growing sense of injury. Of late she
had seemed absolutely changed towards him; and from being his
good friend, with established intimacies, she had turned before
his very eyes into an alien, almost an enemy, more beautiful than
ever, to be true, but perverse, mocking, impish. She flouted him
for his youth, his bluntness, his guileless transparency. But
hardest of all to bear was the delicate derision with which she
treated his awkward attempts to express his passion for her, to
speak of the fever which had taken possession of him, almost
against his will. And now, he reflected bitterly, with this
velvet fop of a count looming up as a possible rival, with his
savoir faire, and his absurd penchant for literature and art,
what chance had he, a plain Briton, against such
odds?&mdash;unless, as he profoundly believed, the chap was a
crook. He determined to sound her guardian.</p>

<p>"Mr. Farrington," he asked aloud, "what do you
think&mdash;hallo!" He sprang up suddenly and thrust out a
supporting arm.</p>

<p>Farrington had risen, and stood swaying slightly upon his
feet. He was frightfully pale, and his countenance was contracted
as if in pain. He lifted a wavering hand to his head.</p>

<p>With a supreme effort he steadied himself.</p>

<p>"Doris," he asked quickly, "I meant to ask you&mdash;where did
you leave Lady Constance?"</p>

<p>The girl looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen her to-day&mdash;she went down to Great
Bradley last night&mdash;didn't she, auntie?"</p>

<p>The elder woman nodded.</p>

<p>"Mannish, and not a little discourteous I think," she said,
"leaving her guests and motoring through the fog to the country.
I sometimes think Constance Dex is a trifle mad."</p>

<p>"I wish I could share your views," said Farrington,
grimly.</p>

<p>He turned abruptly to Doughton.</p>

<p>"Look after Doris," he said. "I have remembered&mdash;an
engagement."</p>

<p>He beckoned Frank, with a scarcely perceptible gesture, and
the two men passed out of the box.</p>

<p>"Have you discovered anything?" he asked, when they were
outside.</p>

<p>"About what?" asked Frank, innocently.</p>

<p>A grim smile broke the tense lines of Mr. Farrington's
face.</p>

<p>"Really!" he said, drily, "for a young man engaged in most
important investigations you are casual."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;the Tollington business," said the other. "No, Mr.
Farrington, I have found nothing. I don't think it is my game
really&mdash;investigating and discovering people. I'm a pretty
good short story writer but a pretty rotten detective. Of course,
it is awfully kind of you to have given me the job&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense," snapped the older man. "It isn't
kindness&mdash;it's self-interest. Somewhere in this country is
the heir to the Tollington millions. I am one of the trustees to
that estate and I am naturally keen on discovering the man who
will relieve me of my responsibility. There is a hundred pounds
awaiting the individual who unearths this heir."</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"There is one other thing I want to speak to you
about&mdash;and that is Doris."</p>

<p>They stood in the little corridor which ran at the back of the
boxes, and Frank wondered why he had chosen this moment to
discuss such urgent and intimate matters. He was grateful enough
to the millionaire for the commission he had given
him&mdash;though with the information to go upon, looking for the
missing Tollington heir was analogous to seeking the proverbial
needle&mdash;but grateful for the opportunity, which even this
association gave him for meeting Doris Gray, he was quite content
to continue the search indefinitely.</p>

<p>"You know my views," the other went on&mdash;he glanced at his
watch again. "I want Doris to marry you. She is a dear girl, the
only human being in the world for whom I have any affection," His
voice trembled, and none could doubt his sincerity. "Somehow I am
getting nervous about things&mdash;that shooting which I
witnessed the other night has made me jumpy&mdash;go in and
win."</p>

<p>He offered a cold hand to the other, and Frank took it, then,
with a little jerk of his head, and a muttered "shan't be gone
long," he passed into the vestibule, and out into the foggy
street. A shrill whistle brought a taxi from the gloom.</p>

<p>"The Savoy," said Farrington. He sprang in, and the cab
started with a jerk.</p>

<p>A minute later he thrust his head from the window.</p>

<p>"You may drop me here," he called. He descended and paid his
fare. "I'll walk the rest of the way," he remarked casually.</p>

<p>"Bit thickish on foot to-night, sir," offered the driver
respectfully. "Better let me set you down at the hotel." But his
fare was already lost in the enveloping mist.</p>

<p>Farrington wrapped his muffler closely about his chin, pulled
down his hat to shadow his eyes, and hurried along like a man
with a set destination.</p>

<p>Presently he halted and signalled to another cab, crawling
along close to the curb.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">THE fog was still heavy, and the blurred
street-lamps looked ghastly in the yellow mist, when the little
newsboy messenger, the first half of his mission performed,
struck briskly riverward to complete his business. He disposed of
his papers by the simple expedient of throwing them into a street
refuse-bin. He jumped on a passing 'bus, and after half an hour's
cautious drive reached Southwark. He entered one of the narrow
streets leading from the Borough. Here the gas lamps were fewer,
and the intersecting streets more narrow and gloomy.</p>

<p>He plunged down a dark and crabbed way, glancing warily behind
him now and then to see if he was being followed.</p>

<p>Here, between invisible walls, the fog hung thick and warm and
sticky, crowding up close, with a kind of blowsy intimacy that
whispered the atmosphere of the place. Occasionally, close to his
ear, snatches of loose song burst out, or a coarse face loomed
head-high through the reek.</p>

<p>But the boy was upon his native heath and scuttled along,
whistling softly between closed teeth, as, with a dexterity born
of long practice, he skirted slush and garbage sinks, slipped
around the blacker gulfs that denoted unguarded basement holes,
and eluded the hideous shadows that lurched by in the gloom.</p>

<p>Hugging the wall, he presently became aware of footsteps
behind him. He rounded a corner, and, turning swiftly, collided
with something which grabbed him with great hands. Without
hesitation, the lad leaned down and set his teeth deep into the
hairy arm.</p>

<p>The man let go with a hoarse bellow of rage and the boy,
darting across the alley, could hear him stumbling after him in
blind search of the narrow way.</p>

<p>As he sped along a door suddenly opened in the blank wall
beside him, and a stream of ruddy light gushed out, catching him
square within its radiance, mud-spattered, starry-eyed,
vivid.</p>

<p>A man stood framed in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Come in," he commanded, briefly.</p>

<p>The boy obeyed. Surreptitiously he wiped the wet and mud from
his face and tried to reduce his wild breathing.</p>

<p>The room which he entered was meagre and stale-smelling, with
bare floor and stained and sagging wall-paper; unfurnished save
for a battered deal-table and some chairs.</p>

<p>He sank into one of them and stared with frank curiosity past
his employer, who had often entrusted him with messages requiring
secrecy, past his employer's companion, to the third figure in
the room&mdash;a prostrate figure which lay quite still under the
heavy folds of a long dark ulster with its face turned to the
wall.</p>

<p>"Well?" It was a singularly agreeable voice which aroused him,
soft and well-bred, but with a faint foreign accent. The speaker
was his employer, a slender dark man, with a finely carved face,
immobile as the Sphinx. He had laid aside his Inverness and top
hat, and showed himself in evening dress with a
large&mdash;perhaps a thought too large&mdash;buttonhole of Parma
violets, which sent forth a faint fragrance.</p>

<p>Of the personality of the man the messenger knew nothing more
than that he was foreign, eccentric in a quiet way, lived in a
grand house near Portland Place, and rewarded him handsomely for
his occasional services. That the grand house was an hotel at
which Poltavo had run up an uncomfortable bill he could not
know.</p>

<p>The boy related his adventures of the evening, not omitting to
mention his late pursuer.</p>

<p>The man listened quietly, brooding, his elbows upon the table,
his inscrutable face propped in the crotch of his hand. A ruby,
set quaintly in a cobra's head, gleamed from a ring upon his
little finger. Presently he roused.</p>

<p>"That's all to-night, my boy," he said, gravely.</p>

<p>He drew out his purse, extracted a sovereign, and laid it in
the messenger's hand.</p>

<p>"And this," he said, softly, holding up a second gold piece,
"is for&mdash;discretion! You comprehend?"</p>

<p>The boy shot a swift glance, not unmixed with terror, at the
still, recumbent figure in the corner, mumbled an assent and
withdrew. Out in the dampness of the fog, he took a long, deep
breath.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind him, the door of an inner room
opened and Farrington came out. He had preceded the messenger by
five minutes. The young exquisite leaned back in his chair, and
smiled into the sombre eyes of his companion.</p>

<p>"At last!" he breathed, softly. "The thing moves. The wheels
are beginning to revolve!"</p>

<p>The other nodded gloomily, his glance straying off toward the
corner of the room.</p>

<p>"They've got to revolve a mighty lot more before the night's
done!" he replied, with heavy significance.</p>

<p>"I needn't tell you," he continued, "that we must move in this
venture with extreme caution. A single misstep at the outset, the
slightest breath of suspicion, and pff! the entire superstructure
falls to the ground."</p>

<p>"That is doubtless true, Mr. Farrington," murmured his
companion, pleasantly. He leaned down to inhale the fragrant
scent of the violets. "But you forget one little thing. This
grand superstructure you speak of&mdash;so mysteriously"&mdash;he
hid a slight smile&mdash;"I don't know it&mdash;all. You have
seen fit, in your extreme caution, to withhold complete
information from me."</p>

<p>He paused, and regarded his companion with a level, steady
gaze. A faint, ironical smile played about the corners of his
mouth; he spoke with a slightly foreign accent, which was at once
pleasant and piquant.</p>

<p>"Is it not so, my friend?" he asked, softly. "I am&mdash;how
you say&mdash;left out in the cold&mdash;I do not even know your
immediate plans."</p>

<p>His countenance was serene and unruffled, and it was only by
his slightly quickened breathing that the conversation held any
unusual significance.</p>

<p>The other stirred uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>"There are certain financial matters," he said, with a light
air.</p>

<p>"There are others immediately pressing," interrupted his
companion. "I observe, for example, that your right hand is
covered by a glove which is much larger than that on your left. I
imagine that beneath the white kid there is a thin silk bandage.
Really, for a millionaire, Mr. Farrington, you are
singularly&mdash;shall I say&mdash;'furtive'?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Farrington, hoarsely. He glanced about
half-fearfully.</p>

<p>The younger man ignored the outburst. He laid a persuasive
hand upon his companion's arm.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said gravely, "let me give you a bit of good
advice. Believe me, I speak disinterestedly. Take me into your
counsel. I think you need assistance&mdash;and I have already
given you a taste of my quality in that respect. This afternoon
when I called upon you in your home in Brakely Square, suggesting
that a man of my standing might be of immense value to you, you
were at first innocently dull, then suspicious. After I told you
of my adventures in the office of a certain Society journal you
were angry. Frankly," the young man shrugged his shoulders, "I am
a penniless adventurer&mdash;can I be more frank than that? I
call myself Count Poltavo&mdash;yet the good God knows that my
family can give no greater justification to the claim of nobility
than the indiscretions of lovely Lydia Poltavo, my grandmother,
can offer. For the matter of that I might as well be prince on
the balance of probability. I am living by my wits: I have
cheated at cards, I have hardly stopped short of murder&mdash;I
need the patronage of a strong wealthy man, and you fulfil all my
requirements."</p>

<p>He bowed slightly to the other, and went on:</p>

<p>"You challenged me to prove my worth&mdash;I accepted that
challenge. To-night, as you entered the theatre, you were told by
a messenger that T.B. Smith&mdash;a most admirable man&mdash;was
watching you&mdash;that he had practically surrounded the Jollity
with detectives, and, moreover, I chose as my messenger a small
youth who has served you more than once. Thus at one stroke I
proved that not only did I know what steps authority was taking
to your undoing, but also that I had surprised this splendid
rendezvous&mdash;and your secret."</p>

<p>He waived his hand around the sordid room, and his eyes rested
awhile upon the silent, ulster-covered figure on the bed; his
action was not without intent.</p>

<p>"You are an interesting man," said Farrington, gruffly. He
looked at his watch. "Join my party at the Jollity," he said; "we
can talk matters over. Incidentally, we may challenge Mr. Smith."
He smiled, but grew grave again. "I have lost a good friend there
"&mdash;he looked at the form on the bed; "there is no reason why
you should not take his place. Is it true&mdash;what you said
to-day&mdash;that you know something of applied mechanics?"</p>

<p>"I have a diploma issued by the College of Padua," said the
other promptly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">AT precisely ten o'clock, as the curtain came
reefing slowly down upon the first act of The Strand Girl, Lady
Dinsmore turned with outstretched hand to greet the first of the
two men who had just entered the box.</p>

<p>"My dear Count," she exclaimed, "I am disappointed in you!
Here I have been paying you really quite tremendous compliments
to these young people. I presume you are on Gregory's
'business'?"</p>

<p>"I am desolated!"</p>

<p>Count Poltavo had a way of looking at one gravely, with an air
of concentrated attention, as if he were seeing through the
words, into the very soul of the speaker. He was, indeed, a
wonderful listener, and this quality, added to a certain buoyancy
of temperament, accounted perhaps for his popularity in such
society as he had been able to penetrate.</p>

<p>"Before I ask you to name the crime, Lady Dinsmore," he said,
"permit me to offer my humblest apologies for my lateness."</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore shook her head at him and glanced at Farrington,
but that dour man had drawn a chair to the edge of the box, and
was staring moodily down into the great auditorium.</p>

<p>"You are an incorrigible!" she declared, "but sit down and
make your excuses at your leisure. You know my niece, and I think
you have met Mr. Doughton. He is one of our future leaders of
thought!"</p>

<p>The Count bowed, and sank into a chair beside his hostess.</p>

<p>Frank, after a frigidly polite acknowledgement, resumed his
conversation with Doris, and Lady Dinsmore turned to her
companion.</p>

<p>"Now for the explanation," she exclaimed, briskly. "I shall
not let you off! Unpunctuality is a crime, and your punishment
shall be to confess its cause."</p>

<p>Count Poltavo bent toward her with bright, smiling eyes.</p>

<p>"A very stupid and foolish business engagement," he replied,
"which required my personal attendance, and unfortunately that of
Mr. Farrington."</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore threw up a protesting hand.</p>

<p>"Business has no charms to soothe my savage breast! Mr.
Farrington," she lowered her voice confidentially, "can talk of
nothing else. When he was staying with us he was for ever
telegraphing, cabling to America, or decoding messages. There was
no peace in the house, by day or by night. Finally I made a
stand. 'Gregory,' I said, 'you shall not pervert my servants with
your odious tips, and turn my home into a public stock-exchange.
Take your bulls and bears over to the Savoy and play with them
there, and leave Doris to me.' And he did!" she concluded
triumphantly.</p>

<p>Count Poltavo looked about, as if noting for the first time
Farrington's preoccupation. "Is he quite well?" he inquired, in
an undertone.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Frankly, I think he had a slight indisposition, and magnified
it in order to escape small talk. He hates music. Doris has been
quite distrait ever since. The child adores her uncle&mdash;you
know, of course, that she is his niece&mdash;the daughter of my
sister. Gregory was her father's brother&mdash;we are almost
related."</p>

<p>Her companion glanced across to the subject of their remarks.
The girl sat in the front of the box, slim and elegant, her hands
clasped loosely in her lap. She was watching the brilliant scene
with a certain air of detachment, as if thinking of other things.
Her usual lightness and gay banter seemed for the moment to have
deserted her, leaving a soft brooding wistfulness that was
strangely appealing.</p>

<p>The Count looked at her.</p>

<p>"She is very beautiful," he murmured under his breath.</p>

<p>Something in his voice caught Lady Dinsmore's attention. She
eyed him keenly.</p>

<p>The Count met her look frankly.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is she engaged to her young friend?" he asked
quietly. "Believe me, it is not vulgar curiosity which prompts
the question. I&mdash;I am&mdash;interested." His voice was as
composed as ever.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore averted her gaze hurriedly and thought with
lightning rapidity.</p>

<p>"I have not her confidence," she replied at length, in a low
tone; "she is a wise young woman and keeps her own counsel." She
appeared to hesitate. "She dislikes you," she said. "I am sorry
to wound you, but it is no secret."</p>

<p>Count Poltavo nodded. "I know," he said, simply. "Will you be
my good friend and tell me why?"</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore smiled. "I will do better than that," she said
kindly. "I will be your very good friend and give you a chance to
ask her why. Frank,"&mdash;she bent forward and tapped the young
man upon the shoulder with her fan,&mdash;"will you come over
here and tell me what your editor means?"</p>

<p>The Count resigned his seat courteously, and took the vacant
place beside the girl. A silence fell between them, which
presently the man broke.</p>

<p>"Miss Gray," he began, seriously, "your aunt kindly gave me
this opportunity to ask you a question. Have I your permission
also?"</p>

<p>The girl arched her eyebrows. Her lip curled ever so
slightly.</p>

<p>"A question to which you and my Aunt Patricia could find no
answer between you! It must be subtle indeed! How can I hope to
succeed?"</p>

<p>He ignored her sarcasm. "Because it concerns yourself."</p>

<p>"Ah!" She drew herself up and regarded him with sparkling
eyes. One small foot began to tap the floor ominously. Then she
broke into a vexed little laugh.</p>

<p>"I am no match for you with the foils, Count. I admit it
freely. I should have learned by this time that you never say
what you mean, or mean what you say."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Miss Gray, if I say that you mistake me utterly.
I mean always what I say&mdash;most of all to you. But to say all
that I mean&mdash;to put into speech all that one hopes or
dreams&mdash;or dares,"&mdash;his voice dropped to a
whisper&mdash;"to turn oneself inside out like an empty pocket to
the gaze of the multitude&mdash;that is&mdash;imbecile." He threw
out his hands with an expressive gesture.</p>

<p>"But to speak concretely&mdash;I have unhappily offended you,
Miss Gray. Something I have done, or left undone&mdash;or my
unfortunate personality does not engage your interest Is it not
true?"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking his sincerity now.</p>

<p>But the girl still held aloof, her blue eyes cool and
watchful. For the moment, her face, in its young hardness, bore a
curious resemblance to her uncle's.</p>

<p>"Is that your question?" she demanded.</p>

<p>The Count bowed silently.</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you!" She spoke in a low voice surcharged
with emotion. "I will give you candour for candour, and make an
end of all this make-believe."</p>

<p>"That," he murmured, "is what I most desire."</p>

<p>Doris continued, heedless of the interruption. "It is true
that I dislike you. I am glad to be able to tell you as much
openly. And yet, perhaps, I should use another word. I dislike
your secrecy&mdash;something dark and hidden within
you&mdash;and I fear your influence over my uncle. You have known
me less than a fortnight&mdash;Mr. Farrington, less than a
week&mdash;yet you have made what I can only conceive to be
impertinent proposals of marriage to me. To-day you were for
three hours with my uncle. I can only guess what your business
has been."</p>

<p>"You would probably guess wrong," he said coolly.</p>

<p>Farrington, at the other end of the box, shot a swift,
suspicious glance across. Poltavo turned to the girl again.</p>

<p>"I want only to be a friend of yours in the day of your need,"
he said, in a low voice; "believe me, that day is not far
distant."</p>

<p>"That is true?" She leaned toward him, a little troubled.</p>

<p>He bowed his head in assent.</p>

<p>"If I could believe you," she faltered. "I need a friend! Oh,
if you could know how I have been torn by doubts&mdash;beset by
fears&mdash;oppressions." Her voice quivered. "There is something
wrong somewhere&mdash;I can't tell you everything&mdash;if you
would help me&mdash;wait. May I test you with a question?"</p>

<p>"A thousand if you like."</p>

<p>"And you will answer&mdash;truthfully?" In her eagerness she
was like a child.</p>

<p>He smiled. "If I answer at all, be sure it will be
truthful."</p>

<p>"Tell me then, is Dr. Fall your friend?"</p>

<p>"He is my dearest enemy," he returned, promptly.</p>

<p>He had only the dimmest notion as to the identity of Dr. Fall,
but it seemed that a lie was demanded&mdash;Poltavo could lie
very easily.</p>

<p>"Or Mr. Gorth?" she asked, and he shook his head.</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath of relief. "And my uncle?" The question
was a whisper. She appeared to hang upon his reply.</p>

<p>The Count hesitated. "I do not know," he admitted finally. "If
he were not influenced by Dr. Fall, I believe he would be my
friend." It was a bow at a venture. He was following the bent of
her inclination.</p>

<p>For the first time that evening Doris looked at him with
interest.</p>

<p>"May I ask how your uncle came to know Gorth?"</p>

<p>He asked the question with the assurance of one who knew all
that was to be known save on this point. She hesitated
awhile.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know. The doctor we have always known. He lives
in the country, and we only see him occasionally. He is&mdash;"
She hesitated and then went on rapidly: "I think he has rather
dreadful work. He is in charge of a lunatic."</p>

<p>Poltavo was interested.</p>

<p>"Please go on," he said.</p>

<p>The girl smiled. "I am afraid you are an awful gossip," she
rallied, but became more serious. "I don't like him very much,
but uncle says that is my prejudice. He is one of those quiet,
sure men who say very little and make one feel rather foolish.
Don't you know that feeling? It is as though one were dancing the
tango in front of the Sphinx."</p>

<p>Poltavo showed his white teeth in a smile.</p>

<p>"I have yet to have that experience," he said.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"One of these days you will meet Dr. Fall and you will know
how helpless one can feel in his presence."</p>

<p>A remarkable prophecy which was recalled by Poltavo at a
moment when he was powerless to profit by the warning.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gorth?"</p>

<p>Again she hesitated and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well," she said frankly, "he is just a common man. He looks
almost like a criminal to my mind. But apparently he has been a
loyal servant to uncle for many years."</p>

<p>"Tell me," asked Poltavo, "on what terms is Dr. Fall with your
uncle? On terms of equality?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Naturally," she said with a look of surprise, "he is a
gentleman, and is, I believe, fairly well off."</p>

<p>"And Gorth?" asked Poltavo.</p>

<p>He was interested for many reasons as one who had to take the
place of that silent figure which lay in the fog-shrouded
house.</p>

<p>"I hardly know how to describe uncle's relations with Gorth,"
she answered, a little puzzled. "There was a time when they were
on terms of perfect equality, but sometimes uncle would be very
angry with him indeed. He was rather a horrid man really. Do you
know a paper called Gossip's Corner?" she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Poltavo had heard of the journal and had found a certain
malicious joy in reading its scandalous paragraphs.</p>

<p>"Well," she said in answer to his nod, "that was Mr. Gorth's
idea of literature. Uncle would never have the paper in his
house, but whenever you saw Mr. Gorth&mdash;he invariably waited
for uncle in the kitchen&mdash;you would be sure to find him
chuckling over some of the horrid things which that paper
published. Uncle used to get more angry about this than anything
else. Mr. Gorth took a delight in all the unpleasant things which
this wretched little paper printed. I have heard it said that he
had something to do with its publication; but when I spoke to
uncle about it, he was rather cross with me for thinking such a
thing."</p>

<p>Poltavo was conscious that the eyes of Farrington were
searching his face narrowly, and out of the corner of his eye he
noted the obvious disapproval. He turned round carelessly.</p>

<p>"An admirable sight&mdash;a London theatre crowd."</p>

<p>"Very," said the millionaire, drily.</p>

<p>"Celebrities on every hand&mdash;Montague Fallock, for
instance, is here."</p>

<p>Farrington nodded.</p>

<p>"And that wise-looking young man in the very end seat of the
fourth row&mdash;he is in the shadow, but you may see him."</p>

<p>"T.B. Smith," said Farrington, shortly. "I have seen
him&mdash;I have seen everybody but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"The occupant of the royal box. She keeps in the shadow all
the time. She is not a detective, too, I suppose?" he asked,
sarcastically. He looked round. Frank Doughton, his niece and
Lady Dinsmore were engrossed in conversation.</p>

<p>"Poltavo," he said, dropping his voice, "I want to know who
that woman is in the opposite box&mdash;I have a reason."</p>

<p>The orchestra was playing a soft intermezzo, and of a sudden
the lights went down in the house, hushed to silence as the
curtain went slowly up upon the second act.</p>

<p>There was a shifting of chairs to distribute the view, a tense
moment of silence as the chorus came down a rocky defile and
then&mdash;a white pencil of flame shot out from the royal box
and a sharp crash of a pistol report.</p>

<p>"My God!" gasped Mr. Farrington, and staggered back.</p>

<p>There was a loud babble of voices, a stentorian voice from the
back of the stalls shouted, "House lights&mdash;quick!" The
curtain fell as the house was bathed in the sudden glare of
lights.</p>

<p>T.B. saw the flash and leapt for the side aisle: two steps and
he was at the door which led to the royal box. It was empty. He
passed quickly through the retiring room&mdash;empty also, but
the private entrance giving on to the street was open and the fog
was drifting through in great wreaths.</p>

<p>He stepped out into the street and blew a shrill whistle.
Instantly from the gloom came a plain clothes policeman&mdash;No,
he had seen nobody pass. T.B. went back to the theatre, raced
round to the box opposite and found it in confusion.</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Farrington?" he asked, quickly.</p>

<p>He addressed his remark to Poltavo.</p>

<p>"He is gone," said the other, with a shrug.</p>

<p>"He was here when the pistol was fired&mdash;at this box, my
friend, as the bullet will testify." He pointed to the mark on
the enamelled panel behind. "When the lights came he had
gone&mdash;that is all."</p>

<p>"He can't have gone," said T.B. shortly. "The theatre is
surrounded. I have a warrant for his arrest."</p>

<p>A cry from the girl stopped him. She was white and
shaking.</p>

<p>"Arrest!" she gasped, "on what charge?"</p>

<p>"On a charge of being concerned with one Gorth in burglary at
the Docks&mdash;and with an attempted murder."</p>

<p>"Gorth!" cried the girl, vehemently. "If any man is guilty, it
is Gorth&mdash;that evil man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak softly of the dead," said T.B. gently. "Mr. Gorth, as I
have every reason to believe, received wounds from which he died.
Perhaps you can enlighten me, Poltavo?"</p>

<p>But the Count could only spread deprecating hands.</p>

<p>T.B. went out into the corridor. There was an emergency exit
to the street, but the door was closed. On the floor he found a
glove, on the door itself the print of a bloody hand.</p>

<p>But there was no sign of Farrington.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">TWO days later, at the stroke of ten, Frank
Doughton sprang from his taxi in front of the office of the
Evening Times.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment, drawing in the fresh March air, sweet
with the breath of approaching spring. The fog of last night had
vanished, leaving no trace. He caught the scent of Southern
lilacs from an adjoining florist shop.</p>

<p>He took the stairs three at a time.</p>

<p>"Chief in yet?" he inquired of Jamieson, the news editor, who
looked up in astonishment at his entrance, and then at the
clock.</p>

<p>"No, he's not down yet. You've broken your record."</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"I've got to get away early."</p>

<p>Tossing his hat upon his desk, he sat down and went
methodically through his papers. He unfolded his Times, his mind
intent upon the problem of the missing millionaire. He had not
seen Doris since that night in the box. The first paper under his
hand was an early edition of a rival evening journal.</p>

<p>He glanced down at the headlines on the front page, then with
a horrified cry he sprang to his feet. He was pale, and the hand
which gripped the paper shook.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Jamieson swung round in his swivel chair.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Farrington!" said Frank, huskily. "Farrington has committed
suicide!"</p>

<p>"Yes, we've a column about it," remarked Jamieson,
complacently. "A pretty good story." Then suddenly: "You knew
him?" he asked.</p>

<p>Frank Doughton lifted a face from which every vestige of
colour had been drained. "I&mdash;I was with him at the theatre
on the night he disappeared," he said.</p>

<p>Jamieson whistled softly.</p>

<p>Doughton rose hurriedly and reached for his hat.</p>

<p>"I must go to them. Perhaps something can be done.
Doris&mdash;" he broke off, unable to continue, and turned away
sharply.</p>

<p>Jamieson looked at him sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go round to Brakely Square?" he suggested.
"There may be new developments&mdash;possibly a mistake. You note
that the body has not been discovered."</p>

<p>Out upon the pavement, Frank caught a passing taxi.</p>

<p>He drove first to the city offices which were Farrington's
headquarters. A short talk with the chief clerk was more than
enlightening. A brief note in the handwriting of the millionaire
announced his intention, "tired of the world" to depart
therefrom.</p>

<p>"But why?" asked the young man, in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Doughton, you don't seem to quite realize the importance
of this tragedy," said the chief clerk, quietly. "Mr. Farrington
was a financial king&mdash;a multi-millionaire. Or at least, he
was so considered up till this morning. We have examined his
private books, and it now appears that he had speculated heavily
during the last few weeks&mdash;he has lost everything, every
penny of his own and his ward's fortune. Last night, in a fit of
despair, he ended his life. Even his chief clerk had no knowledge
of his transactions."</p>

<p>Doughton looked at him in a kind of stupefaction. Was it of
Farrington the man was talking such drivel? Farrington, who only
the week before had told him in high gratification that within
the last month he had added a cool million to his ward's marriage
portion. Farrington, who had, but two days ago, hinted
mysteriously of a gigantic financial coup in the near future. And
now all that fortune was lost, and the loser was lying at the
bottom of the Thames!</p>

<p>"I think I must be going mad," he muttered. "Mr. Farrington
wasn't the kind to kill himself."</p>

<p>"It is not as yet known to the public, but I think I may tell
you, since you were a friend of Farrington's, that Mr. T.B. Smith
has been given charge of the matter. He will probably wish to
know your address. And in the meantime, if you run across
anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly! I will let you know. Smith is an able man, of
course." Doughton gave the number of his chambers, and retreated
hastily, glad that the man had questioned him no further.</p>

<p>He found his cab and flung himself wearily against the
cushions. And now for Doris!</p>

<p>But Doris was not visible. Lady Dinsmore met him in the
morning room, her usually serene countenance full of trouble. He
took her hand in silence.</p>

<p>"It is good of you, my dear Frank, to come so quickly. You
have heard all?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"How is Doris?"</p>

<p>She sank into a chair and shook her head.</p>

<p>"The child is taking it terribly hard! Quite tearless, but
with a face like frozen marble! She refused to believe the news,
until she saw his own writing. Then she fainted."</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore took out her lace handkerchief and wiped her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Doris," she continued, in a moment, "has sent for Count
Poltavo."</p>

<p>Frank stared at her.</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore shook her head.</p>

<p>"I cannot say, definitely," she replied, with a sigh. "She is
a silent girl. But I fancy she feels that the Count knows
something&mdash;she believes that Gregory met with foul
play."</p>

<p>Frank leaned forward.</p>

<p>"My own idea!" he said, quietly.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore surveyed him with faint, good-humoured
scorn.</p>

<p>"You do not know Gregory," she said, after a pause.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I do not follow you! If it was not murder it must
have been suicide. But why should Mr. Farrington kill
himself?"</p>

<p>"I am sure that he had not the slightest idea of doing
anything so unselfish," returned Lady Dinsmore, composedly.</p>

<p>"Then what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why are you so absolutely sure that he is dead?" she asked
softly.</p>

<p>Frank stared at her in blank amazement.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he gasped. Was she mad also?</p>

<p>"Simply that he is no more dead than you or I," she retorted,
coolly. "What evidence have we? A letter, in his own handwriting,
telling us gravely that he has decided to die! Does it sound
probable? It is a safe presumption that that is the farthest
thing from his intentions. For when did Gregory ever tell the
truth concerning his movements? No, depend upon it, he is not
dead. For purposes of his own, he is pretending to be. He has
decided to exist&mdash;surreptitiously."</p>

<p>"Why should he?" asked the bewildered young man. This was the
maddest theory of all. His head swam with a riot of conflicting
impressions. He seemed to have been hurled headlong into a
frightful nightmare, and he longed to emerge again into the light
of the prosaic, everyday world.</p>

<p>The door at the farther end of the room opened. He looked up
eagerly, half expecting to see Farrington himself, smiling upon
the threshold.</p>

<p>It was Doris. She stood there for a moment, uncertain, gazing
at them rather strangely. In her white morning dress, slightly
crumpled, and her dark hair arranged in smooth bandeaux, she was
amazingly like a child. The somewhat cold spring sunlight which
streamed through the window showed that the event of the night
had already set its mark upon her. There were faint violet
shadows beneath her eyes, and her face was pale.</p>

<p>Frank came forward hastily, everything blotted from his mind
but the sight of her white, grief-stricken face. He took both her
hands in his warm clasp.</p>

<p>The girl gave him a long, searching scrutiny, then her lips
quivered, and with a smothered sob she flung herself into his
arms and hid her face on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Frank held her tenderly. "Don't," he whispered
unsteadily&mdash;" don't cry, dear."</p>

<p>In her sorrow, she was inexpressibly sweet and precious to
him.</p>

<p>He bent down and smoothed with gentle fingers the soft, dusky
hair. The fragrance of it filled his nostrils. Its softness sent
a delicious ecstasy thrilling from hie finger-tips up his arm.
All his life he would remember this one moment. He gazed down at
her tenderly, a wonderful light in his young face.</p>

<p>"Dear!" he whispered again.</p>

<p>She lifted a pallid face to him. Her violet eyes were misty,
and tiny drops of dew were still tangled in her lashes.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are good to me," she murmured.</p>

<p>At his answering look, a faint colour swept into her cheeks.
She gently disengaged herself and sat down.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore came forward, and seating herself beside the
girl upon the divan, drew her close within the shelter of her
arms.</p>

<p>"Now, Frank," she said, cheerily, indicating a chair opposite,
"sit down, and let us take counsel together. And first of
all,"&mdash;she pressed the girl's cold hand&mdash;"let me speak
my strongest conviction. Gregory is not dead. Something tells me
that he is safe and well."</p>

<p>Doris turned her eyes to the young man wistfully. "You have
heard something&mdash;later?" she asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "There has been no time for fresh
developments yet. Scotland Yard is in charge of the affair, and
T.B. Smith has been put upon the case."</p>

<p>She shuddered and covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"He said he was going to arrest him&mdash;how strange and
ghastly it all is!" she whispered. "I&mdash;I cannot get it out
of my head. The dark river&mdash;my poor uncle&mdash;I can see
him there&mdash;" She broke off.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore looked helplessly across to the young man.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that a servant brought a letter.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore arched her eyebrows significantly. "Poltavo!"
she murmured.</p>

<p>Doris darted forward and took the letter from the salver. She
broke the seal and tore out the contents, and seemed to
comprehend the message at a glance. A little cry of joy escaped
her. Her face, which had been pale, flushed a rosy hue. She bent
to read it again, her lips parted. Her whole aspect breathed hope
and assurance. She folded the note, slipped it into her bosom,
and, without a word, walked from the room.</p>

<p>Frank stared after her, white to the lips with rage and
wounded love.</p>

<p>Lady Dinsmore rose briskly to her feet.</p>

<p>"Excuse me. Wait here!" she said, and rustled after her
niece.</p>

<p>Frank Doughton paced up and down the room distractedly,
momentarily expecting her reappearance. Only a short half-hour
ago, with Doris' head upon his breast, he had felt supremely
happy; now he was plunged into an abyss of utter wretchedness.
What were the contents of that brief note which had affected her
so powerfully? Why should she secrete it with such care unless it
conveyed a lover's assurance? His foot came into contact with a
chair, and he swore under his breath.</p>

<p>The servant, who had entered unobserved, coughed
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship sends her excuses, sir," he said, "and says she
will write you later."</p>

<p>He ushered the young man to the outer door.</p>

<p>Upon the top step Frank halted stiffly. He found himself face
to face with Poltavo.</p>

<p>The Count greeted him gravely.</p>

<p>"A sad business!" he murmured. "You have seen the ladies? How
does Miss Gray bear it? She is well?"</p>

<p>Frank gazed at him darkly.</p>

<p>"Your note recovered her!" he said, quietly.</p>

<p>"Mine!" Surprise was in the Count's voice. "But I have not
written. I am come in person."</p>

<p>Frank's face expressed scornful incredulity. He lifted his hat
grimly and descended the steps, and came into collision with a
smiling, brown-faced man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith!" he said, eagerly, "is there any news?"</p>

<p>T.B. looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"The Thames police have picked up the body of a man bearing
upon his person most of Mr. Farrington's private belongings."</p>

<p>"Then it is true! It is suicide?"</p>

<p>T.B. looked past him.</p>

<p>"If a man cut his own head off before jumping into the river,
it was suicide," he said carefully, "for the body is headless. As
for myself, I have never witnessed such a phenomenon, and I am
sceptical."</p>

<p>A train drew into the arrival platform at Waterloo and a tall
man alighted. Nearer at hand he did not appear to be so young as
the first impression suggested. For there was a powdering of grey
at each temple and certain definite lines about his mouth.</p>

<p>His face was tanned brown, and it required no great powers of
observation and deduction to appreciate the fact that he had
recently returned to England after residence in a hot
climate.</p>

<p>He stood on the edge of the curb outside the new entrance of
the station, hesitating whether he should take his chance of
finding a cab or whether he should pick up one in the street, for
the night was wet and cold and his train had been full.</p>

<p>Whilst he stood a big taxi came noiselessly to the curb and
the driver touched his cap.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the man with a smile. "You can drive me to
the Metropole."</p>

<p>He swung the door open and his foot was on the step when a
hand touched him lightly, and he turned to meet the scrutiny of a
pair of humorous grey eyes.</p>

<p>"I think you had better take another cab, Dr. Goldworthy,"
said the stranger.</p>

<p>"I am afraid&mdash;" began the doctor.</p>

<p>The driver of the car, after a swift glance at the new-comer,
would have driven off, but an unmistakable detective-officer had
jumped on to the step by his side.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said T.B. Smith, for he it was who had detained
the young doctor, "but I will explain. Don't bother about the
taxi driver; my men will see after him. You have had a narrow
escape of being kidnapped," he added.</p>

<p>He drove the puzzled doctor to Scotland Yard, and piece by
piece he extracted the story of one George Doughton who had died
in his arms, of a certain box containing papers which the doctor
had promised to deliver to Lady Constance, and of how that lady
learnt the news of her sometime lover's death.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said T.B. when the other had finished. "I think I
understand."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">IT was the morning after the recovery of
Farrington's body that T.B. Smith sat in his big study
overlooking Brakely Square. He had finished his frugal breakfast,
the tray had been taken away, and he was busy at his desk when
his manservant announced Lady Constance Dex. T.B. looked at the
card with an expressionless face.</p>

<p>"Show the lady up, George," he said, and rose to meet his
visitor as she came sweeping through the doorway.</p>

<p>A very beautiful woman was his first impression. Whatever
hardness there was in the face, whatever suggestion there might
be of those masterful qualities about which he had heard, there
could be no questioning the rare clearness of the skin, the
glories of those hazel eyes, or the exquisite modelling of the
face. He judged her to be on the right side of thirty, and was
not far out, for Lady Constance Dex at that time was
twenty-seven.</p>

<p>She was well, even richly, dressed, but she did not at first
give this impression. T.B. imagined that she might be an
authority on dress, and in this he took an accurate view, for
though not exactly a leader of fashion, Lady Constance had
perfect taste in such matters.</p>

<p>He pulled forward a chair to the side of his desk.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" he said.</p>

<p>She gave a brief smile as she seated herself.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will think I am a bore, disturbing you, Mr.
Smith, especially at this hour of the morning, but I wanted to
see you about the extraordinary happenings of the past few days.
I have just come up to town," she went on; "in fact, I came up
the moment I heard the news."</p>

<p>"Mr. Farrington is, or was, a friend of yours?" said T.B.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"He and I have been good friends for many years," she replied,
quietly; "he is an extraordinary man with extraordinary
qualities."</p>

<p>"By the way," said T.B., "his niece was staying with you a few
nights ago, was she not?"</p>

<p>Lady Constance Dex inclined her head.</p>

<p>"She came to a ball I was giving, and stayed the night," she
said. "I motored back to Great Bradley after the dance, so that I
have not seen her since I bade her good night. I am going along
to see what I can do for her," she concluded. She had been
speaking very deliberately and calmly, but now it was with an
effort that she controlled her voice.</p>

<p>"I understand, Mr. Smith," she said suddenly, "that you have a
small scent bottle which is my property; Mr. Farrington wrote to
me about it."</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"It was found in the area of Mr. Farrington's house," he said,
"on the night that the two men were killed in Brakely
Square."</p>

<p>"What do you suggest?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I suggest that you were at Mr. Farrington's house that
night," said T.B. bluntly. "We are speaking now, Lady Constance,
as frankly as it is possible for man and woman to speak. I
suggest that you were in the house at the time of the shooting,
and that when you heard the shots you doubled back into the
house, through the kitchen, and out again by a back way."</p>

<p>He saw her lips press tighter together, and went on
carelessly:</p>

<p>"You see, I was not satisfied with the examination I made that
night I came again in the early hours of the morning, when the
fog had risen a little, and there was evidence of your retirement
plainly to be seen. The back of the house opens into Brakely
Mews, and I find there are four motor-cars located in the various
garages in that interesting thoroughfare, none of which
correspond with the tire tracks which I was able to pick up. My
theory is that you heard the altercation before the house, that
you came out to listen, not to make your escape, and that when
you had satisfied yourself you hurried back to the mews, got into
the car which was waiting for you, and drove off through the
fog."</p>

<p>"You are quite a real detective," she drawled. "Can you tell
me anything more?"</p>

<p>"Save that you drove yourself and that the car was a
two-seater, with a self-starting arrangement, I can tell you
nothing." She laughed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have been all the way to Great Bradley making
inquiries," she mocked him. "Everybody there knows I drive a car,
and everybody who takes the trouble to find out will learn that
it is such a car as you describe."</p>

<p>"But I have not taken that trouble," said T.B. with a smile.
"I am curious to know, Lady Constance, what you were doing in the
house at that time. I do not for one moment suspect that you shot
these men; indeed, I have plenty of evidence that the shots were
fired from some other place than the area."</p>

<p>"Suppose I say," she countered, "that I was giving a party
that night, that I did not leave my house."</p>

<p>"If you said that," he interrupted, "you would be
contradicting something you have already said; namely, that you
did leave the house, a journey in the middle of the night as far
as I can gather, and evidently one which was of considerable
moment."</p>

<p>She looked past him out of the window, her face set, her brows
knit in a thoughtful frown.</p>

<p>"I can tell you a lot of things that possibly you do not
know," she said, turning to him suddenly. "I can explain my
return to Great Bradley very simply. There is a friend of mine,
or rather a friend of my friend," she corrected herself, "who has
recently returned from West Africa. I received news that he had
gone to Great Bradley to carry a message from some one who was
very dear to me."</p>

<p>There was a little tremor in her voice, and, perfect actress
as she might be, thought T.B., there was little doubt that here
she was speaking the truth.</p>

<p>"It was necessary for me that I should not miss this visitor,"
said Lady Constance, quietly, "though I do not wish to make
capital out of that happening."</p>

<p>"I must again interrupt you," said T.B. easily. "The person
you are referring to was Dr. Thomas Goldworthy, who has recently
returned from an expedition organized by the London School of
Tropical Medicine, in Congoland; but your story does not quite
tally with the known fact that Dr. Goldworthy arrived in Great
Bradley the night before your party, and you interviewed him
then. He brought with him a wooden box which he had collected at
the Custom House store at the East India Docks. An attempt was
made by two burglars to obtain possession of that box and its
contents, a fact that interested me considerably, since a friend
of mine is engaged upon that somewhat mysterious case of
attempted burglary. But that is confusing the issue. These are
the facts." He tapped the table slowly as he enumerated them.
"Dr. Goldworthy brought this box to Great Bradley, telegraphed to
you that he was coming, and you interviewed him. It was
subsequent to the interview that you returned to London for your
party. Really, Lady Constance, your memory is rather bad."</p>

<p>She faced him suddenly resolute, defiant.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she asked. "You do not accuse me
of the murder of your two friends; you cannot even accuse me of
the attempt on Mr. Farrington. You know so much of my history,"
she went on, speaking rapidly, "that you may as well know more.
Years ago, Mr. Smith, I was engaged to a man, and we were
passionately fond of one another. His name was George
Doughton."</p>

<p>"The explorer," nodded T.B.</p>

<p>"He went abroad," she continued, "suddenly and unexpectedly,
breaking off our engagement for no reason that I could ascertain,
and all my letters to him, all my telegrams, and every effort I
made to get in touch with him during the time he was in Africa
were without avail. For four years I had no communication from
him, no explanation of his extraordinary behaviour, and then
suddenly I received news of his death. At first it was thought he
had died as a result of fever, but Dr. Goldworthy who came to see
me convinced me that George Doughton was poisoned by somebody who
was interested in his death."</p>

<p>Her voice trembled, but with an effort she recovered
herself.</p>

<p>"All these years I have not forgotten him, his face has never
left my mind, he has been as precious to me as though he were by
my side in the flesh. Love dies very hard in women of my age, Mr.
Smith," she said, "and love injured and outraged as mine has been
developed all the tiger passion which women can nurture. I have
learnt for the first time why George Doughton went out to his
death. He used to tell me," she said, as she rose from her chair,
and paced the room slowly, "that when you are shooting wild
beasts you should always shoot the female of the species first,
because if she is left to the last she will avenge her
slaughtered mate. There is a terrible time coming for somebody,"
she said, speaking deliberately.</p>

<p>"For whom?" asked T.B.</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"I think you know too much already, Mr. Smith," she said; "you
must find out all the rest in your own inimitable way; so far as
I am concerned, you must leave me to work out my plan of
vengeance. That sounds horribly melodramatic, but I am just as
horribly in earnest, as you shall learn. They took George
Doughton from me and they murdered him; the man who did this was
Montague Fallock, and I am perhaps the only person in the world
who has met Montague Fallock in life and have known him to be
what he is."</p>

<p>She would say no more, and T.B. was too cautious a man to
force the pace at this particular moment. He saw her to the door,
where her beautiful limousine was awaiting her.</p>

<p>"I hope to meet you again very soon, Lady Constance."</p>

<p>"Without a warrant?" she smiled.</p>

<p>"I do not think it will be with a warrant," he said, quietly,
"unless it is for your friend Fallock."</p>

<p>He stood in the hall and watched the car disappear swiftly
round the corner of the square. Scarcely was it out of sight than
from the little thoroughfare which leads from the mews at the
back of the houses shot a motor-cyclist who followed in the same
direction as the car had taken.</p>

<p>T.B. nodded approvingly; he was leaving nothing to chance.
Lady Constance Dex would not be left day or night free from
observation.</p>

<p>"And she did not mention Farrington!" he said to himself, as
he mounted the stairs. "One would almost think he was alive."</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock that evening when the little two-seated
motor-car which Lady Constance drove so deftly came spinning
along the broad road which runs into Great Bradley, skirted the
town by a side road and gained the great rambling rectory which
stood apart from the little town in its own beautiful grounds.
She sprang lightly out of the car.</p>

<p>The noise of the wheels upon the gravel walk had brought a
servant to the door, and she brushed past the serving man without
a word; ran upstairs to her own room and closed and locked the
door behind her before she switched on the electric light. The
electric light was an unusual possession in so small a town, but
she owed its presence in the house to her friendship with that
extraordinary man who was the occupant of the Secret House.</p>

<p>Three miles away, out of sight of the rectory in a fold of the
hill was this great gaunt building, erected, so popular gossip
said, by one who had been crossed in love and desired to live the
life of a recluse, a desire which was respected by the
superstitious town-folk of Great Bradley. The Secret House had
been built in the hollow which was known locally as "Murderers'
Valley," a pretty little glen which many years before had been
the scene of an outrageous crime. The house added to, rather than
detracted from, the reputation of the glen; no man saw the
occupant of the Secret House; his secretary and his two Italian
servants came frequently to Great Bradley to make their
purchases; now and again his closed car would whizz through the
streets; and Great Bradley, speculating as to the identity of its
owner, could do no more than hope that one of these fine days a
wheel would come off that closed car and its occupant be forced
to disclose himself.</p>

<p>But in the main the town was content to allow the eccentric
owner of the Secret House all the privacy he desired. He might do
things which were unheard of, as indeed he did, and Great
Bradley, standing aloof, was content to thank God that it was not
cast in the same bizarre mould as this wealthy unknown, and took
comfort from the reflection.</p>

<p>For he did many curious things. He had a power house of his
own; you could see the chimney showing over Wadleigh Copse, with
dynamos of enormous power which generated all that was necessary
for lighting and heating the big house.</p>

<p>There were honest British working men in Great Bradley who
spoke bitterly of the owner's preference for foreign labour, and
it was a fact that the men engaged in the electrical works were
without exception of foreign origin. They had their quarters and
lived peacefully apart, neither offering nor desiring the
confidence of their fellow-townsmen. They were, in fact, frugal
people of the Latin race who had no other wish than to work hard
and to save as much of their salaries as was possible in order
that at some future date they might return to their beloved
Italy, and live in peace with the world; they were well paid for
their discretion, a sufficient reason for its continuance.</p>

<p>Lady Constance Dex had been fortunate in that she had secured
one of the few favours which the Secret House had shown to the
town. An underground cable had been laid to her house, and she
alone of all human beings in the world was privileged to enter
the home of this mysterious stranger without challenge.</p>

<p>She busied herself for some time changing her dress and
removing the signs of her hasty journey from London. Her maid
brought her dinner on a tray, and when she had finished she went
again into her boudoir, and opening the drawer of her bureau she
took out a slender-barrelled revolver. She looked at it for some
time, carefully examined the chambers and into each dropped a
nickel-tipped cartridge. She snapped back the hinged chamber and
slipped the pistol into a pocket of her woollen cloak. She locked
the bureau again and went out through the door and down the
stairs. Her car was still waiting, but she turned to the servant
who stood deferentially by the door.</p>

<p>"Have the car put in the garage," she said; "I am going to see
Mrs. Jackson&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very good, my lady," said the man.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">T.B. SMITH came down to Great Bradley with only
one object in view. He knew that the solution to the mystery, not
only of Farrington's disappearance, but possibly the identity of
the mysterious Mr. Fallock, was to be found rather in this small
town than in the metropolis. Scotland Yard was on its mettle.
Within a space of seven days there had been two murders, a
mysterious shooting, and a suicide so full of extraordinary
features as to suggest foul play, without the police being in the
position to offer a curious and indignant public the slightest
resemblance of a clue. This, following as it had upon a shooting
affray at the Docks, had brought Scotland Yard to a position of
defence.</p>

<p>"There are some rotten things being said about us," said the
Chief Commissioner on the morning of T.B.'s departure. He threw a
paper across the table, and T.B. picked it up with an enigmatic
smile. He read the flaring column in which the intelligence of
the police department was called into question, without a word,
and handed the paper back to his chief.</p>

<p>"I think we might solve all these mysteries in one swoop," he
said. "I am going down to-day to inspect the Secret
House&mdash;that is where one end of the solution lies."</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner looked interested.</p>

<p>"It is very curious that you should be talking about that," he
said. "I have had a report this morning from the chief constable
of the county on that extraordinary menage."</p>

<p>"And what has he to say about it?"</p>

<p>Sir Gordon Billings shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It is one of those vague reports which chief constables are
in the habit of furnishing," he said, drily. "Apparently the
owner is an American, an invalid, and is eccentric. More than
this&mdash;and this will surprise you&mdash;he has been certified
by competent medical authorities as being insane."</p>

<p>"Insane?" T.B. repeated in surprise.</p>

<p>"Insane," nodded the chief; "and he has all the privileges
which the Lunacy Act confers upon a man. That is rather a
facer."</p>

<p>T.B. looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"I had a dim idea that I might possibly discover in the
occupant one who was, at any rate, a close relative to
Fallock."</p>

<p>"You are doomed to disappointment," smiled the chief; "there
is no doubt about that. I have had all the papers up. The man was
certified insane by two eminent specialists, and is under the
care of a doctor who lives on the premises, and who also acts as
secretary to this Mr. Moole. The secret of the Secret House is
pretty clear; it is a private lunatic asylum,&mdash;that, and
nothing else."</p>

<p>T.B. thought for a while.</p>

<p>"At any rate no harm can be done by interviewing this
cloistered Mr. Moole, or by inspecting the house," he said.</p>

<p>He arrived in Great Bradley in the early part of the
afternoon, and drove straight away to the Secret House. The
flyman put him down at some distance from the big entrance gate,
and he made a careful and cautious reconnaissance of the
vicinity. The house was a notable one. It made no pretence at
architectural beauty, standing back from the road, and in the
very centre of a fairly uncultivated patch of ground. All that
afternoon he measured and observed the peculiarities of the
approach, the lie of the ground, the entrances, and the exits,
and had obtained too a cautious and careful observation of the
great electrical power house, which stood in a clump of trees
about a hundred yards from the house itself.</p>

<p>The next morning he paid a more open visit. This time his fly
put him down at the gateway of the house, and he moved slowly up
the gravel pathway to the big front entrance door. He glanced at
the tip of the power house chimney which showed over the trees,
and shook his head in some doubt. He had furtively inspected the
enormous plant which the eccentric owner of the Secret House had
found it necessary to lay down.</p>

<p>"Big enough to run an electric railway," was his mental
comment. He had seen, too, the one-eyed engineer, a saturnine man
with a disfiguring scar down one side of his face, and a trick of
showing his teeth on one side of his mouth when he smiled.</p>

<p>T.B. would have pursued his investigations further, but
suddenly he had felt something click under his feet, as he stood
peering in at the window, and instantly a gong had clanged, and a
shutter dropped noiselessly behind the window, cutting off all
further view.</p>

<p>T.B. had retired hastily and had cleared the gates just before
they swung to, obviously operated by somebody in the power
house.</p>

<p>His present visit was less furtive and it was in broad
daylight, with two detectives ostentatiously posted at the gates,
that he made his call&mdash;for he took no unnecessary risks.</p>

<p>He walked up the four broad marble steps to the portico of the
house, and wiped his feet upon a curious metal mat as he pressed
the bell. The door itself was half hidden by a hanging curtain,
such as one may see screening the halls of surburban houses, made
up of brightly coloured beads or lengths of bamboo. In this case
it was made by suspending thousands of steel beads upon fine wire
strings from a rod above the door. It gave the impression that
the entrance itself was of steel, but when in answer to his
summons the door was opened, the chick looped itself up on either
side in the manner of a stage curtain, and it seemed to work
automatically on the opening of the door.</p>

<p>There stood in the entrance a tall man, with a broad white
face and expressionless eyes. He was dressed soberly in black,
and had the restrained and deferential attitude of the superior
man-servant.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Smith, of Scotland Yard," said T.B. briefly, "and I
wish to see Mr. Moole."</p>

<p>The man in black looked dubious.</p>

<p>"Will you come in?" he asked, and T.B. was shown into a large
comfortably furnished sitting-room.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you can't see Mr. Moole," said the man, as he
closed the door behind him; "he is, as you probably know, a
partial invalid, but if there is anything I can do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can take me to Mr. Moole," said T.B. with a smile; "short
of that&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>"If you insist," he began.</p>

<p>The detective nodded.</p>

<p>"I am his secretary and his doctor&mdash;Doctor Fall," the
other introduced himself, "and it may mean trouble for
me&mdash;perhaps you will tell me your business?"</p>

<p>"My business is with Mr. Moole."</p>

<p>The doctor bowed.</p>

<p>"Come this way," he said, and he led the detective across the
broad hall. He opened a plain door, and disclosed a small lift,
standing aside for the other to enter.</p>

<p>"After you," said T.B. politely.</p>

<p>Dr. Fall smiled and entered, and T.B. Smith followed.</p>

<p>The lift shot swiftly upward and came to a rest at the third
floor.</p>

<p>It was not unlike an hotel, thought T.B., in the general
arrangement of the place.</p>

<p>Two carpeted corridors ran left and right, and the wall before
him was punctured with doorways at regular intervals. His guide
led him to the left, to the end of the passage, and opened the
big rosewood door which faced him. Inside was another door. This
he opened and entered a big apartment and T.B. followed. The room
contained scarcely any furniture. The panelling on the walls was
of polished myrtle; a square of deep blue carpet of heavy pile
was set exactly in the centre, and upon this stood a silver
bedstead. But it was not the furnishing or the rich little gilt
table by the bedside or the hanging electrolier which attracted
T.B.'s attention; rather his eyes fell instantly upon the man on
the bed.</p>

<p>A man with an odd yellow face, who, with his steady unwinking
eyes might have been a figure of wax save for the regular rise
and fall of his breast, and the spasmodic twitching of his lips.
T.B. judged him to be somewhere in the neighbourhood of seventy,
and, if anything, older. His face was without expression; his
eyes, which turned upon the intruder, were bright and beady.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Moole," said the suave secretary. "I am afraid if
you talk to him you will get little in the way of
information."</p>

<p>T.B. stepped to the side of the bed and looked down. He nodded
his head in greeting, but the other made no response.</p>

<p>"How are you, Mr. Moole?" said T.B. gently. "I have come down
from London to see you."</p>

<p>There was still no response from the shrunken figure under the
bedclothes.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked T.B. after a while.</p>

<p>For an instant a gleam of intelligence came to the eyes of the
wreck. His mouth opened tremulously and a husky voice answered
him.</p>

<p>"Jim Moole," it croaked, "poor old Jim Moole; ain't done
nobody harm."</p>

<p>Then his eyes turned fearfully to the man at T.B.'s side; the
old lips came tightly together and no further encouragement from
T.B. could make him speak again.</p>

<p>A little later T.B. was ushered out of the room.</p>

<p>"You agree with me," said the doctor smoothly, "Mr. Moole is
not in a position to carry on a very long conversation."</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"I quite agree," he said, pleasantly. "An American
millionaire&mdash;Mr. Moole&mdash;is he not?"</p>

<p>Dr. Fall inclined his head. His black eyes never left T.B.'s
face.</p>

<p>"An American millionaire," he repeated.</p>

<p>"He does not talk like an American," said T.B.; "even making
allowances that one must for his mental condition, there is no
inducement to accept the phenomenon."</p>

<p>"Which phenomenon?" asked the other, quickly.</p>

<p>"That which causes an American millionaire, a man probably of
some refinement and education, at any rate of some lingual
characteristics, to talk like a Somerset farm labourer."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the other harshly.</p>

<p>"Just what I say," said T.B. Smith; "he has the burr of a man
who has been brought up in Somerset. He is obviously one who has
had very little education. My impression of him does not coincide
with your description."</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Smith," said the other, quietly, "that you have
had very little acquaintance with people who are mentally
deficient, otherwise you would know that those unfortunate
fellow-creatures of ours who are so afflicted are very frequently
as unrecognizable from their speech as from their actions."</p>

<p>He led the way to the lift door, but T.B. declined its
service.</p>

<p>"I would rather walk down," he said.</p>

<p>He wanted to be better acquainted with this house, to have a
larger knowledge of its topography than the ascent and descent by
means of an electric lift would allow him. Dr. Fall offered no
objection, and led the way down the red carpeted stairs.</p>

<p>"I am well acquainted with people of unsound mind," T.B. went
on, "especially that section of the insane whose lunacy takes the
form of dropping their aitches."</p>

<p>"You are being sarcastic at my expense," said the other,
suddenly turning to him with a lowered brow. "I think it is only
right to tell you that, in addition to being Mr. Moole's
secretary, I am a doctor."</p>

<p>"That is also no news to me," smiled T.B. "You are an American
doctor with a Pennsylvania degree. You came to England in
eighteen hundred and ninety-six, on board the Lucania. You left
New York hurriedly as the result of some scandal in which you
were involved. It is, in fact, much easier to trace your
movements since the date of your arrival than it is to secure
exact information concerning Mr. Moole, who is apparently quite
unknown to the American Embassy."</p>

<p>The large face of the secretary flushed to a deep purple.</p>

<p>"You are possibly exceeding your duty," he said, gratingly,
"in recalling a happening of which I was but an innocent
victim."</p>

<p>"Possibly I am," agreed T.B.</p>

<p>He bowed slightly to the man, and descended the broad steps to
the unkempt lawn in front of the house. He was joined at the gate
by the two men he had brought down. One of these was Ela.</p>

<p>"What did you find?" asked that worthy man.</p>

<p>"I found much that will probably be useful to us in the
future," said T.B., as he stepped into the fly, followed by his
subordinate.</p>

<p>He turned to the third detective.</p>

<p>"You had better wait here," he said, "and report on who
arrives and who departs. I shall be back within a couple of
hours."</p>

<p>The man saluted, and the fly drove off.</p>

<p>"I have one more call to make," said T.B. Smith, "and I had
better make that alone, I think. Tell the flyman to drop me at
Little Bradley Rectory."</p>

<p>Lady Constance Dex was not unprepared for the visit of the
detective. She had seen him from the window of her room, driving
past the rectory in the direction of the Secret House, and he
found her expectantly waiting him in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>He came straight to the heart of the matter.</p>

<p>"I have just been to visit a man who I understand is a friend
of yours," he said.</p>

<p>She inclined her head.</p>

<p>"You mean Mr. Moole?"</p>

<p>"That is the man," said the cheerful T.B.</p>

<p>She thought for a long time before she spoke again. She was
evidently making up her mind as to how much she would tell this
insistent officer of the law.</p>

<p>"I suppose you might as well know the whole facts of the
case," she said; "if you will sit over there, I will supplement
the information I gave you in Brakely Square a few days ago."</p>

<p>T.B. seated himself.</p>

<p>"I am certainly a visitor to the Secret House," she said,
after a while. She did not look at the detective as she spoke,
but kept her gaze fixed upon the window and the garden
without.</p>

<p>"I told you that I have had one love affair in my life; that
affair," she went on steadily, "was with George Doughton; you
probably know his son."</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"It was a case of love at first sight. George Doughton was a
widower, a good-natured, easygoing, lovable man. He was a brave
and brilliant man too, famous as an explorer as you know. I met
him first in London; he introduced me to the late Mr. Farrington,
who was a friend of his, and when Mr. Farrington came to Great
Bradley and took a house here for the summer, George Doughton
came down as his guest, and I got to know him better than ever I
had known any human being before in my life."</p>

<p>She hesitated again.</p>

<p>"We were lovers," she went on, defiantly, "why should I not
confess to an experience of which I am proud?&mdash;and our
marriage was to have taken place on the very day he sailed for
West Africa. George Doughton was the very soul of honour, a man
to whom the breath of scandal was as a desert wind, withering and
terrible. He was never in sympathy with the modern spirit of our
type, was old-fashioned in some respects, had an immense and
beautiful conception of women and their purity, and carried his
prejudices against, what we call smart society, to such an extent
that, if a man or woman of his set was divorced in circumstances
discreditable to themselves, he would cut them out of his
life."</p>

<p>Her voice faltered, and she seemed to find difficulty in
continuing, but she braced herself to it.</p>

<p>"I had been divorced," she went on, in a low voice; "in my
folly I had been guilty of an indiscretion which was sinless as
it was foolish. I had married a cold, rigid and remorseless man
when I was little more than a child, and I had run away from him
with one who was never more to me than a brother. A chivalrous,
kindly soul who paid for his chivalry dearly. All the evidence
looked black against me, and my husband had no difficulty in
securing a divorce. It passed into the oblivion of forgotten
things, yet in those tender days when my love for George Doughton
grew I lived in terror least a breath of the old scandal should
be revived. I had reason for that terror, as I will tell you. I
was, as I say, engaged to be married. Two days before the wedding
George Doughton left me without a word of explanation. The first
news that I received was that he had sailed for Africa;
thereafter I never heard from him." She dropped her voice until
she was hardly audible.</p>

<p>T.B. preserved a sympathetic silence. It was impossible to
doubt the truth of all she was saying, or to question her
anguish. Presently she spoke again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Farrington was most kind, and it was he who introduced me
to Dr. Fall."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked T.B. quickly.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I never understood until quite lately," she said. "At the
time I accepted as a fact that Dr. Fall had large interests in
West Africa, and would enable me to get into communication with
George Doughton. I clutched at straws, so to speak; I became a
constant visitor to the Secret House, the only outside visitor
that extraordinary domain has ever had within memory. I found
that my visits were not without result. I was enabled to trace
the movements of my lover; I was enabled, too, to send letters to
him in the certainty that they would reach him. I have reason now
to know that Mr. Farrington had another object in introducing me;
he wanted me kept under the closest observation lest I should get
into independent communication with George Doughton. That is all
the story so far as my acquaintance with the Secret House is
concerned. I have only seen Mr. Moole on one occasion."</p>

<p>"And Farrington?" asked T.B.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I have never seen Mr. Farrington in the house," she
replied.</p>

<p>"Or Montague Fallock?" he suggested.</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I have never seen Montague Fallock," she said slowly, "though
I have heard from him. He, too, knew of the scandal; he it was
who blackmailed me in the days of my courtship."</p>

<p>"You did not tell me about that," said T.B.</p>

<p>"There is little to tell," she said, with a weary gesture; "it
was this mysterious blackmailer who terrified me, and to whose
machinations I ascribe George Doughton's discovery, for now I
know that he was told of my past, and was told by Montague
Fallock. He demanded impossible sums. I gave him as much as I
could, almost ruined myself to keep this blackmailer at bay, but
all to no purpose."</p>

<p>She rose and paced the room.</p>

<p>"I have not finished with Montague Fallock," she said.</p>

<p>She turned her white face to the detective, and he saw a hard
gleam in her eye.</p>

<p>"There is much that I could tell you, Mr. Smith, which would
enable you perhaps to bring to justice the most dastardly villain
that has ever walked the earth."</p>

<p>"May I suggest," said T.B. gently, "that you place me in
possession of those facts?"</p>

<p>She smiled, implying a negative.</p>

<p>"I have my own plans for avenging the murder of my lover and
the ruin of my life," she said hardly. "When Montague Fallock
dies, I would rather he died by my hand."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="first">COUNT POLTAVO, a busy man of affairs in these
days, walked up the stairs of the big block of flats in which he
had his modest dwelling with a little smile upon his lips and a
sense of cheer in his heart. There were many reasons why this
broken adventurer, who had arrived in London only a few months
before with little more than his magnificent wardrobe, should
feel happy. He had been admitted suddenly into the circle of the
elect. Introductions had been found which paved a way for further
introductions. He was the confidential adviser of the most
beautiful woman in London, was the trusted of aristocrats. If
there was a wrathful and suspicious young newspaper man obviously
and undisguisedly thirsting for his blood that was not a matter
which greatly affected the Count. It had been his good fortune to
surprise the secret of the late Mr. Farrington; by the merest of
chances he had happened upon the true financial position of this
alleged millionaire; had discovered him to be a swindler and in
league, so he guessed, with the mysterious Montague Fallock. All
this fine position which Farrington had built up was a veritable
house of cards. It remained now for the Count to discover how far
Farrington's affection for his niece had stayed his hand in his
predatory raid upon the cash balances of his friends and
relatives. Anyway, the Count thought, as he fitted a tiny key
into the lock of his flat, he was in a commanding position. He
had all the winning cards in his hand, and if the prizes included
so delectable a reward as Doris Gray might be, the Count, a
sentimental if unscrupulous man, was perfectly satisfied. He
walked through his sitting-room to the bedroom beyond and stood
for a moment before the long mirror. It was a trick of Count
Poltavo to commune with himself, and when he was rallied on this
practice, suggestive of vanity to the uninitiated, he confirmed
rather than disabused that criticism by protesting that there was
none whom he could trust with such absence of fear of consequence
as his own bright worthy image.</p>

<p>He had reason for the smile which curved his thin lips. Every
day he was making progress which placed Doris Gray more and more,
if not in his power, at least under his influence.</p>

<p>He lived alone without any servants save for the old woman who
came every morning to tidy his flat, and when the bell rang as he
stood before the mirror, he answered it himself without any
thought as to the importance of the summons. For Count Poltavo
was not above taking in the milk or chaffering with tradesmen
over the quality of a cabbage. It was necessary that he must
jealously husband his slender resources until fate placed him in
possession of a larger and a more generous fortune than that
which he now possessed. He opened the door, and took a step back,
then with a little bow:</p>

<p>"Come in, Mr. Doughton," he said.</p>

<p>Frank Doughton strode across the tiny hall, waited until the
Count had closed the door, and opened another, ushering the
visitor into his study.</p>

<p>"To what am I indebted for the honour of this visit?" asked
Poltavo, as he pushed forward a chair.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you on a matter which deeply affects you and
me," said the young man briskly, even rudely.</p>

<p>Count Poltavo inclined his head. He recognized all the
disagreeable portents, but he was not in any way abashed or
afraid. He had had experience of many situations less pleasant
than this threatened to be and had played his part worthily.</p>

<p>"I can give you exactly a quarter of an hour," he said,
looking at his watch; "at the end of that period I must leave for
Brakely Square. You understand there is to be a reading of the
will of our departed friend, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know all about that," interrupted Frank, roughly; "you are
not the only person who has been invited to that pleasant
function."</p>

<p>"You also?" The Count was a little surprised. He himself went
as friend and adviser to the bereaved girl, a position which a
certain letter had secured for him. That letter in three brief
lines had told the girl to trust Poltavo. It was about this
letter that Frank had come, and he came straight to the
point.</p>

<p>"Count Poltavo," he said, "the day after Mr. Farrington's
disappearance a messenger brought a letter for Miss Gray."</p>

<p>Poltavo nodded.</p>

<p>"So I understand," he said, smoothly.</p>

<p>"So you know," challenged the other, "because it concerned
you. It was a letter in which Doris was told to trust you
absolutely; it was a letter also which gave her hope that the man
whose body was found in the Thames was not that of
Farrington."</p>

<p>Poltavo frowned.</p>

<p>"That is not a view that has been accepted by the
authorities," he said quickly. "The jury had no doubt that this
was the body of Mr. Farrington, and brought in a verdict
accordingly."'</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"What a jury thinks and what Scotland Yard thinks," he said,
drily, "are not always in agreement. As a result of that letter,"
he went on, "Miss Gray has reposed a great deal of trust in you,
Count, and day by day my efforts to serve her have been made more
difficult by her attitude. I am a plain-speaking Englishman, and
I am coming to the point, right now,"&mdash;he thumped the table:
"Doris Gray's mind is becoming poisoned against one who has no
other object in life than to serve her faithfully."</p>

<p>Count Poltavo shrugged his shoulders and smiled.</p>

<p>"My dear young man," he said, smoothly, "you do not come to
me, I trust, to act as your agent in order to induce Miss Gray to
take any other view of you than she does. Because if you do," he
went on suavely, "I am afraid that I cannot help you very much.
There is an axiom in the English language to which I subscribe
most thoroughly, and it is that 'all is fair in love and
war.'"</p>

<p>"In love?" repeated Frank, looking the other straight in the
eyes.</p>

<p>"In love," the Count asserted, with a nod of his head, "it is
not the privilege of any human being to monopolize in his heart
all the love in the world, or to say this thing I love and none
other shall love it. Those qualities in Miss Gray which are so
adorable to you are equally adorable to me."</p>

<p>He spread out his hands in deprecation.</p>

<p>"It is a pity," he said, with his little smile, "and I would
do anything to avoid an unpleasant outcome to our rivalry. It is
a fact that cannot be gainsaid that such a rivalry exists. I have
reason to know that the late Mr. Farrington had certain views
concerning his niece and ward, and I flatter myself that those
views were immensely favourable to me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Frank, harshly.</p>

<p>The Count shrugged again.</p>

<p>"I had a little conversation with Mr. Farrington in the course
of which he informed me that he would like nothing better than to
see the future of Doris assured in my hands."</p>

<p>Frank went white.</p>

<p>"That is a lie," he said, hoarsely. "The views of Mr.
Farrington were as well known to me as they are to
you&mdash;better, if that is your interpretation of them."</p>

<p>"And they were?" asked the Count, curiously,</p>

<p>"I decline to discuss the matter with you," said Frank. "I
want only to tell you this. If by chance I discover that you are
working against me by your lies or your cunning, I will make you
very sorry that you ever came into my life."</p>

<p>"Allow me to show you the door," said Count Poltavo. "People
of my race and of my family are not usually threatened with
impunity."</p>

<p>"Your race I pretty well know," said Frank, coolly; "your
family is a little more obscure. If it is necessary for me to go
any farther into the matter, and if I am so curious that I am
anxious for information, I shall know where to apply."</p>

<p>"And where will that be?" asked the Count softly, his hand
upon the door.</p>

<p>"To the Governor of Alexandrovski Prison," said Frank.</p>

<p>The Count closed the door behind his visitor, and stood for
some moments in thought.</p>

<p>It was a depressed little party which assembled an hour later
in the drawing-room of the Brakely Square house. To the Count's
annoyance, Frank was one of these, and he had contrived to secure
a place near the sad-faced girl and engage her in conversation.
The Count did not deem it advisable at this particular moment to
make any attempt to separate them: he was content to wait.</p>

<p>T.B. Smith was there.</p>

<p>He had secured an invitation by the simple process of
informing those responsible for the arrangements that if that
courtesy was not offered to him he would come in another capacity
than that of a friend.</p>

<p>The senior partner of Messrs. Debenham &amp; Tree, the great
city lawyers, was also present, seated at a table with his clerk,
on which paper and ink was placed, and where too, under the
watchful eyes of his assistant, was a bulky envelope heavily
sealed.</p>

<p>There were many people present to whom the reading of this
will would be a matter of the greatest moment. Farrington had
left no private debts. Whatever plight the shareholders of the
company might be in, he himself, so far as his personal fortune
was concerned, was certainly solvent.</p>

<p>T.B.'s inquiries had revealed, to his great astonishment, that
the girl's fortune was adequately secured. Much of the contents
of the will, which was to astonish at least three people that
day, was known to T.B. Smith, and he had pursued his
investigations to the end of confirming much which the dead
millionaire had stated.</p>

<p>Presently, when Doris left the young man to go to the lawyer
for a little consultation, T.B. made his way across the room and
sat down by the side of Frank Doughton.</p>

<p>"You were a friend of Mr. Farrington's, were you not?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"A great friend?"</p>

<p>"I hardly like to say that I was a great friend," said the
other; "he was very kind to me."</p>

<p>"In what way was he kind?" asked T.B. "You will forgive me for
asking these somewhat brutal questions, but as you know I have
every reason to be interested."</p>

<p>Frank smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"I do not think that you are particularly friendly disposed
toward him, Mr. Smith," he said; "in fact, I rather wonder that
you are present, after what happened at the theatre."</p>

<p>"After my saying that I wanted to arrest him," smiled T.B.
"But why not? Even millionaires get mixed up in curious illegal
proceedings," he said; "but I am rather curious to know what is
the reason for Mr. Farrington's affection and in what way he was
kind to you."</p>

<p>Frank hesitated. He desired most of all to be loyal to the man
who, with all his faults, had treated him with such kindness.</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing," he said, "he gave me a jolly good
commission, a commission which might easily have brought me in a
hundred thousand pounds."</p>

<p>T.B.'s interest was awakened.</p>

<p>"What was that?" he asked.</p>

<p>In as few words as possible Frank told the story of the search
for the heir to the Tollington millions.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, with an apologetic smile, "I was not the
man for the job&mdash;he should have given it to you. I am afraid
I am not cut out for a detective, but he was very keen on my
taking the matter in hand."</p>

<p>T.B. bit his lips thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I know something of the Tollington millions," he said; "they
were left by the timber king of America who died without issue,
and whose heir or heirs were supposed to be in this country. We
have had communications about the matter."</p>

<p>He frowned again as he conjured to his mind all the data of
this particular case.</p>

<p>"Of course, Farrington was one of the trustees; he was a
friend of old Tollington. That money would not be involved," he
said, half to himself, "because the four other trustees are men
of integrity holding high positions in the financial world of the
United States. Thank you for telling me; I will look up the
matter, and if I can be of any assistance to you in carrying out
Mr. Farrington's wishes you may be sure that I will."</p>

<p>There was a stir at the other end of the room. With a
preliminary cough, the lawyer rose, the papers in his hand.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, and a silence fell upon the
room, "it is my duty to read to you the terms of the late Mr.
Farrington's will, and since it affects a great number of people
in this room, I shall be glad if you will retain the deepest
silence."</p>

<p>There was a murmur of agreement all round, and the lawyer
began reading the preliminary and conventional opening of the
legal document. The will began with one or two small bequests to
charitable institutions, and the lawyer looking over his glasses
said pointedly:</p>

<p>"I need hardly say that there will be no funds available from
the estate for carrying out the wishes of the deceased gentleman
in this respect, since they are all contingent upon Mr.
Farrington possessing a certain sum at his death which I fear he
did not possess. The will goes on to say," he continued
reading:</p>

<p>"'Knowing that my dear niece and ward is amply provided for, I
can do no more than leave her an expression of my trust and love,
and it may be taken as my last and final request that she marries
with the least possible delay the person whom it is my most
earnest desire she should take as a husband."</p>

<p>Two people in the audience felt a sudden cold thrill of
anticipation.</p>

<p>"'That person,'" continued the lawyer, solemnly, "'is my good
friend, Frank Doughton.'"</p>

<p>There was a gasp from Frank; a startled exclamation from the
girl. Poltavo went red and white and his eyes glowed. T.B. Smith,
to whom this portion of the will was known, watched the actors
keenly. He saw the bewildered face of the girl, the rage in
Poltavo's eyes, and the blank astonishment on the face of Frank
as the lawyer went on:</p>

<p>"'Knowing the insecurity of present-day investments, and
seized with the fear that the fortune entrusted to my keeping
might be dissipated by one of those strange accidents of finance
with which we are all acquainted, I have placed the whole of her
fortune, to the value of eight hundred thousand pounds, in a safe
at the London Safe Deposit, and in the terms of the power vested
in me as trustee by her late father I have instructed my lawyers
to hand her the key and the authority to open the safe on the day
she marries the aforesaid Frank Doughton. And if she should
refuse or through any cause or circumstance decline to carry out
my wishes in this respect, I direct that the fortune contained
therein shall be withheld from her for the space of five years as
from the date of my death.'"</p>

<p>There was another long silence. T.B. saw the change come over
the face of Poltavo. From rage he had passed to wonder, from
wonder to suspicion, and from suspicion to anger again. T.B.
would have given something substantial to have known what was
going on inside the mind of this smooth adventurer. Again the
lawyer's voice insisted upon attention.</p>

<p>"'To Frank Doughton,'" he read, "'I bequeath the sum of a
thousand pounds to aid him in his search for the Tollington heir.
To T.B. Smith, the assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard with
whom I have had some acquaintance, and whose ability I hold in
the highest regard, I leave the sum of a thousand pounds as a
slight reward for his service to civilization, and I direct that
on the day he discovers the most insidious enemy to society,
Montague Fallock, he shall receive a further sum of one thousand
pounds from the trustees of the estate."</p>

<p>The lawyer looked up from his reading.</p>

<p>"That again, Mr. Smith, is contingent upon certain
matters."</p>

<p>T.B. smiled.</p>

<p>"I quite understand that," he said, drily, "though possibly
you don't," he added under his breath.</p>

<p>This was a portion of the will about which he knew nothing for
the document had been executed but a few days before the tragedy
which had deprived the world of Gregory Farrington. There were a
few more paragraphs to read; certain jewelleries had been left to
his dear friend Count Ernesto Poltavo, and the reading was
finished.</p>

<p>"I have only to say now," said the lawyer, as he carefully
folded his glasses and put them away in his pocket, "that there
is a very considerable sum of money at Mr. Farrington's bank. It
will be for the courts to decide in how so far that money is to
be applied to the liquidation of debts incurred by the deceased
as director of a public company. That is to say, that it will be
a question for the supreme judicature whether the private fortune
of the late Mr. Farrington will be seized to satisfy his other
creditors."</p>

<p>There was a haze and a babble of talk. Poltavo crossed with
quick steps to the lawyer, and for a moment they were engaged in
quick conversation; then suddenly the adventurer turned and left
the room. T.B. had seen the move and followed with rapid steps.
He overtook the Count in the open doorway of the house.</p>

<p>"A word with you, Count," he said, and they descended the
steps together into the street. "The will was rather a surprise
to you?"</p>

<p>Count Poltavo was now all smooth equanimity.</p>

<p>"You might not have thought from his smooth face and his
smile, and his gentle drawling tone, that he had been affected by
the reading of this strange document.</p>

<p>"It is a surprise, I confess," he said. "I do not understand
my friend Farrington's action in regard to&mdash;" he
hesitated.</p>

<p>"In regard to Miss Gray," smiled T.B.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the self-control of the man left him, and he
turned with a snarling voice on the detective, but his wrath was
not directed toward the cool man who stood before him.</p>

<p>"The treacherous dog!" he hissed, "to do this&mdash;to me. But
it shall not be, it shall not be, I tell you; this woman is more
to me than you can imagine." He struck his breast violently. "Can
I speak with you privately?"</p>

<p>"I thought you might wish to," said T.B.</p>

<p>He lifted his hand and made an almost imperceptible signal,
and a taxicab which had stood on the opposite side of the road,
and followed them slowly as they walked along Brakely Square,
suddenly developed symptoms of activity, and came whirring across
the road to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>T.B. opened the door and Poltavo stepped in, the detective
following. There was no need to give any instructions, and
without any further order the cab whirled its way through the
West End until it came to the arched entrance of Scotland Yard,
and there the man alighted. By the time they had reached T.B.'s
room, Poltavo had regained something of his self-possession. He
walked up and down the room, his hands thrust into his pockets,
his head sunk upon his breast.</p>

<p>"Now," said T.B., seating himself at his desk, "what would you
like to say?"</p>

<p>"There is much I would like to say," said Poltavo, quietly,
"and I am now considering whether it will be in my interest to
tell all at this moment or whether it would be best that I should
maintain my silence longer."</p>

<p>"Your silence in regard to Farrington I presume you are
referring to," suggested T.B. Smith easily; "perhaps I can assist
you a little to unburden your mind."</p>

<p>"I think not," said Poltavo, quickly; "you cannot know as much
about this man as I. I had intended," he said, frankly, "to tell
you much that would have surprised you; at present it is
advisable that I should wait for one or two days in order that I
may give some interested people an opportunity of undoing a great
deal of mischief which they have done. I must go to Paris at
once."</p>

<p>T.B. said nothing; there was no purpose to be served in
hastening the issue at this particular moment. The man had
recovered his self-possession, he would talk later, and T.B. was
content to wait, and for the moment to entertain his unexpected
guest.</p>

<p>"It is a strange place," said the Count calmly, scrutinizing
the room; "this is Scotland Yard! The Great Scotland Yard! of
which all criminals stand in terror, even with which our local
criminals in Poland have some acquaintance."</p>

<p>"It is indeed a strange place," said T.B. "Shall I show you
the strangest place of all?"</p>

<p>"I should be delighted," said the other.</p>

<p>T.B. led the way along the corridor, rang for the lift, and
they were shot up to the third floor. Here at the end of a long
passage, was a large room, in which row after row of cabinets
were methodically arrayed.</p>

<p>"This is our record department," said T. B.; "it will have a
special interest for you, Count Poltavo."</p>

<p>"Why for me?" asked the other, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Because I take it you are interested in the study of criminal
detection," replied T.B. easily.</p>

<p>He walked aimlessly along one extensive row of drawers, and
suddenly came to a halt.</p>

<p>"Here, for instance, is a record of a remarkable man," he
said. He pulled open a drawer unerringly, ran his fingers along
the top of a batch of envelopes and selected one. He nodded the
Count to a polished table near the window, and pulled up two
chairs.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he said, "and I will introduce you to one of the
minor masters of the criminal world."</p>

<p>Count Poltavo was an interested man as T.B. opened the
envelope and took out two plain folders, and laid them on the
table.</p>

<p>He opened the first of these; the photograph of a
military-looking man in Russian uniform lay upon the top. Poltavo
saw it, gasped, and looked up, his face livid.</p>

<p>"That was the Military Governor of Poland," said T.B., easily;
"he was assassinated by one who posed as his son many years
ago."</p>

<p>The Count had risen quickly, and stood shaking from head to
foot, his trembling hand at his mouth.</p>

<p>"I have never seen him," he muttered, "I think your record
office is very close&mdash;you have no ventilation."</p>

<p>"Wait a little," said T.B., and he turned to the second
dossier.</p>

<p>Presently he extracted another photograph, the photograph of a
young man, a singularly good-looking youth, and laid it on the
table by the side of the other picture.</p>

<p>"Do you know this gentleman?" asked T.B.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>"It is the photograph of the murderer," the detective went on,
"and unfortunately this was not his only crime. You will observe
there are two distinct folders, each filled with particulars of
our young friend's progress along the path which leads to the
gallows."</p>

<p>He sorted out another photograph. It was a beautiful girl in a
Russian peasant costume; evidently the portrait of some one taken
at a fancy dress ball, because both the refined face and the
figure of the girl were inconsistent with the costume.</p>

<p>"That is the Princess Lydia Bontasky," said T.B., "one of the
victims of our young friend's treachery. Here is another."</p>

<p>The face of the fourth photograph was plain, and marked with
sorrow.</p>

<p>"She was shot at Kieff by our young and high-spirited friend,
and died of her wounds. Here are particulars of a bank robbery
organized five years ago by a number of people who called
themselves anarchists, but who were in reality very commonplace,
conventional thieves unpossessed of any respect for human life.
But I see this does not interest you."</p>

<p>He closed the dossier and put it back into its envelope,
before he looked up at the Count's face. The man was pale now,
with a waxen pallor of death.</p>

<p>"They are very interesting," he muttered.</p>

<p>He stumbled rather than walked the length of the room, and he
had not recovered when they reached the corridor.</p>

<p>"This is the way out," said T.B., as he indicated the broad
stairs. "I advise you, Count Poltavo, to step warily. It will be
my duty to inform the Russian police that you are at present in
this country. Whether they move or do not move is a problematical
matter. Your fellow-countrymen are not specially energetic where
crimes of five years' standing are concerned. But this I warn
you,"&mdash;he dropped his hand upon the other's
shoulder,&mdash;"that if you stand in my way I shall give you
trouble which will have much more serious consequences for
you."</p>

<p>Three minutes later Poltavo walked out of Scotland Yard like a
man in a dream. He hailed the first cab that came past and drove
back to his flat. He was there for ten minutes and emerged with a
handbag.</p>

<p>He drove to the Grand Marylebone Hotel, and detective
inspector Ela, who had watched his every movement, followed in
another taxi. He waited until he saw Poltavo enter the hotel,
then the officer descended some distance from the door, and
walked nonchalantly to the entrance.</p>

<p>There was no sign of Poltavo.</p>

<p>Ela strolled carelessly through the corridor, and down into
the big palm court. From the palm court another entrance led into
the Marylebone Road. Ela quickened his steps, went through the
big swing doors to the vestibule.</p>

<p>Yes, the porter on duty had seen the gentleman; he had called
a taxi and gone a few minutes before.</p>

<p>Ela cursed himself for his folly in letting the man out of his
sight.</p>

<p>He reported the result of his shadowing to T.B. Smith over the
telephone, and T.B. was frankly uncomplimentary.</p>

<p>"However, I think I know where we will pick him up," he said.
"Meet me at Waterloo; we must catch the 6:15 to Great
Bradley."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">"YOU want to see Mr. Moole?" Dr. Fall asked the
visitor.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Mr. Moole," replied Poltavo. He stood at the
door of the Secret House, and after a brief scrutiny the
big-faced doctor admitted him, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>"Tell me, what do you want?" he asked. He had seen the curious
gesture that Poltavo had made&mdash;the pass sign which had
unbarred the entrance to many strange people.</p>

<p>"I want to see Farrington!" replied Poltavo, coolly.</p>

<p>"Farrington!" Fall's brow knit in a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>"Farrington," repeated Poltavo, impatiently. "Do not let us
have any of this nonsense, Fall. I want to see him on a matter of
urgency. I am Poltavo."</p>

<p>"I know just who you are," said Fall, calmly, "but why you
should come here under the impression that the late Mr.
Farrington is an inmate of this establishment I do not
understand. We are a lunatic asylum, not a mortuary," he said,
with heavy humour.</p>

<p>Still, he led the way upstairs to the drawing-room on the
first floor.</p>

<p>"What is the trouble?" he asked, as he closed the door behind
him.</p>

<p>Poltavo chose to tell the story of his identification by T.B.
Smith rather than the real object of his journey. Fall listened
in silence.</p>

<p>"I doubt very much whether he will see you," he said: "he is
in his worst mood. However, I will go along and find out what his
wishes are."</p>

<p>He was absent for ten minutes, and when he returned he
beckoned to the visitor.</p>

<p>Poltavo followed him up the stairs till he came to the room in
which the bedridden Mr. Moole lay.</p>

<p>A man turned as the two visitors came in&mdash;it was
Farrington in the life, Farrington as he had seen him on the
night of his disappearance from the box at the Jollity. The big
man nodded curtly.</p>

<p>"Why have you come down here," he asked, harshly, "leading
half the detectives in London to me?"</p>

<p>"I do not think you need bother about half the detectives in
London," said Poltavo. He looked at Fall. "I want to see you
alone," he said.</p>

<p>Farrington nodded his head and the other departed, closing the
door behind him.</p>

<p>"Now," said Poltavo,&mdash;he crossed the room with two
strides,&mdash;"I want to know what you mean&mdash;you
treacherous dog&mdash;by this infernal will of yours!"</p>

<p>"You can sit down," said Farrington, coolly, "and you can
learn right now, Poltavo, that I do not stand for any man
questioning me as to why I should do this or that, and I
certainly do not stand for any human being in the world speaking
to me as you are doing."</p>

<p>"You know that you are in my power," said Poltavo, viciously.
"Are you aware that I could raise my finger and tumble your
precious plot into the dust?"</p>

<p>"There are many things I know," said Farrington, "and if you
knew them too you would keep a civil tongue in your head. Sit
down. What is the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Why did you leave that instruction in your will? That Doris
was to marry this infernal Doughton?"</p>

<p>"For a very good reason."</p>

<p>"Explain the reason!" stormed the angry man.</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing so absurd," smiled Farrington, crookedly;
"it is enough when I say I want this girl's happiness. Don't you
realize," he went on rapidly, "that the only thing I have in my
life, that is at all clean, or precious, or worthwhile, is my
affection for my niece? I want to see her happy; I know that her
happiness lies with Doughton."</p>

<p>"You are mad," snarled the other; "the girl is half in love
with me."</p>

<p>"With you," Farrington's eyes narrowed; "that is absolutely
impossible."</p>

<p>"Why impossible?" demanded Poltavo loudly; "why impossible?"
He thumped the table angrily.</p>

<p>"For many reasons," said Farrington. "First, because you are
unworthy to be her under-gardener, much less her husband. You
are, forgive my frankness, a blackguard, a thief, a murderer, a
forger and a bank robber, so far as I know." He smiled. "Yes, I
was an interested listener to your conversation with Fall. I have
all sorts of weird instruments here by which I can pick up
unguarded items of talk, but fortunately I have no need to be
informed on this subject. I have as complete a record of your
past as our friend Smith, and I tell you, Poltavo, that whilst I
am willing that you shall be my agent, and that you shall profit
enormously by working hand in hand with me, I would sooner see
myself dead than I should hand Doris over to your tender
mercies."</p>

<p>An ugly smile played about the lips of Poltavo.</p>

<p>"That is your last word?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That is my last word," said Farrington; "if you will be
advised by me, you will let the matter stand where it is. Leave
things as they are, Poltavo. You are on the way to making a huge
fortune; do not let this absurd sentiment, or this equally absurd
ambition of yours, step in and spoil everything."</p>

<p>"And whatever happens you would never allow Doris to marry
me?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I meant, and exactly what I still say,"
said Farrington, firmly.</p>

<p>"But, suppose,"&mdash;Poltavo's hands caressed his little
moustache, and he was smiling wickedly,&mdash;"suppose I force
your hand?"</p>

<p>Farrington's eyebrows rose. "How?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Suppose I take advantage of the fact that Miss Doris Gray, an
impressionable young English girl, receptive to sympathetic
admiration and half in love with me&mdash;suppose, I say, I took
advantage of this fact, and we marry in the face of your
will?"</p>

<p>"You would be sorry," said Farrington, grimly; "you may be
sorry that you even threatened as much."</p>

<p>"I not only threaten," snarled Poltavo, "but I will carry out
my threat, and you interfere with me at your peril!" He shook his
clenched fist in Farrington's face. The elder man looked at him
with a long, earnest glance in which his keen eyes seemed to
search the very soul of the Russian.</p>

<p>"I wish this had not happened," he said, half to himself. "I
had hoped that there was the making of a useful man in you,
Poltavo, but I have been mistaken. I never thought that sentiment
would creep in. Is it money&mdash;her fortune?" he asked,
suddenly.</p>

<p>Poltavo shook his head.</p>

<p>"Curse the money," he said, roughly; "I want the girl. I tell
you, Farrington, every day she grows more precious and more
desirable to me."</p>

<p>"Other women have become precious and desirable to you," said
Farrington in a low, passionate voice, "and they have enjoyed the
fleeting happiness of your favour for&mdash;how long? Just as
long as you wanted, Poltavo, and when you have been satisfied and
sated yourself with joy, you have cast them out as they had been
nothing to you. I know your record, my man," he said. "All that I
want now is to assure myself that you are in earnest, because if
you are&mdash;" He paused.</p>

<p>"If I am&mdash;?" sneered Poltavo.</p>

<p>"You will not leave this house alive," said Farrington.</p>

<p>He said it in a matter-of-fact tone, and the full significance
of his speech did not dawn upon the Russian until long after he
had said it.</p>

<p>For the space of a second or two his lips were smiling, and
then the smile suddenly froze. His hand went back to his hip
pocket and reappeared, holding a long-barrelled automatic
pistol.</p>

<p>"Don't you try any of your tricks on me," he breathed. "I am
quite prepared for all eventualities, Mr. Farrington; you make a
mistake to threaten me.</p>

<p>"Not such a mistake as you have made," smiled Farrington. "You
may fire your pistol to see if it will go off. My own impression
is that the magazine has been removed."</p>

<p>One glance at the weapon was sufficient to demonstrate to the
other that the man had spoken the truth. He went deathly
white.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, genially, "let us make an end to this
absurd breach of friendship. I have come down to see what I can
do for you."</p>

<p>"You have come down now to force me to grant your wishes
regarding Doris," said Farrington. "I think the matter had better
end." He pressed the bell, and Fall came in after a few moments'
interval.</p>

<p>"Give the Count some refreshment before he goes," he said; "he
is going to London."</p>

<p>The very matter-of-factness of the instructions reassured
Count Poltavo, who for one moment had stood in a panic of fear;
there was that in this big silent house which terrified him. And
with the removal of this fear his insolent assurance returned. He
stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"You have made up your mind about Doris?" he said.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," said Farrington.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Poltavo.</p>

<p>He followed Fall along the corridor, and the doctor opened a
small door and illuminated a tiny lift inside, and Poltavo
stepped in. As he did so the door clicked.</p>

<p>"How do I work this lift?" he asked through the ornamental
ironwork of the doorway.</p>

<p>"I work it from outside," said Dr. Fall, cheerfully, and
pressed a button. The lift sank. It passed one steel
door&mdash;that was the first floor; and another&mdash;that was
the ground floor, but still the lift did not stop. It went on
falling slowly, evenly, without jar or haste, and suddenly it
came to a stop before a door made of a number of thin steel bars
placed horizontally. As the lift stopped, the steel-barred
doorway opened noiselessly. All Poltavo's senses were now alert;
he, a past master in the art of treachery, had been at last its
victim. He did not leave the tiny lift for a moment, but prepared
for eventualities. He took a pencil out of his pocket and wrote
rapidly on the wooden panelling of the elevator, and then he
stepped out into the semi-darkness. He saw a large apartment, a
bed and chair, and above a large table one dim light. A number of
switches on the wall facing him promised further illumination.
Anyway, if the worst came to the worst, he could find a way by
the lift well to safety again. He searched his pockets with
feverish haste. He usually carried one or two pistol cartridges
in case of necessity, and he was rewarded, for, in his top
waistcoat pocket, he discovered two nickel-pointed shapes.
Hastily he removed the dummy magazine from the butt of his
pistol. The removal of the magazine must have been effected by
his servant, and the servant, now he came to give the matter
consideration, was possibly in the pay of Farrington, and had
probably warned the occupants of the Secret House of Poltavo's
departure.</p>

<p>It was but natural that the big man would take no chances, and
Poltavo cursed himself for a fool for allowing himself to be
lured into a sense of security. He stepped out of the lift; there
was enough light to guide him across the room. He reached the
switchboard and pulled one of the little levers. Three lights
appeared at the far end of the room; he pulled over the rest and
the room was brilliantly illuminated.</p>

<p>It was an underground chamber, with red, distempered walls,
artistically furnished. The small bed in the corner was of brass;
the air was conveyed to his gloomy chamber by means of
ventilators placed at intervals in the wall.</p>

<p>Not an uncomfortable prison, thought Poltavo. He was making
his inspection when he heard a clang, and swung round. The steel
door of the lift had closed and he reached it just in time to see
the floor of the little cage ascending out of sight. He cursed
himself again for his insensate folly; he might have fixed the
door with a chair; it was an elementary precaution to take, but
he had not realized the possibilities of this house of
mystery.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chairs were fixed. He tried than, but found he was
mistaken, except in one case. The great chair at the head of the
table, solid and heavy, was immovable, for it was clamped to the
floor.</p>

<p>In one corner was a framework, and he guessed it to be the
slide in which the small provision lift ran.</p>

<p>His surmise was accurate, for even while he was examining it,
a trap opened in the ceiling, and there slid down noiselessly
between the oiled grids a tiny platform on which was a tray
filled with covered dishes. He lifted the viands from the little
elevator to the table and inspected them. There was a note
written in pencil.</p>

<p>"You need have no fear in consuming the food we provide for
you," it ran. "Dr. Fall will personally vouch for its purity, and
will, if necessary, sample it in your presence. If you should
need attendance you will find a small bell fixed on the under
side of the table."</p>

<p>Poltavo looked at the dinner. He was ravenously hungry; he
must take the chance of poison; after all, these people had him
so completely in their power that there was no necessity to take
any precaution so far as his food was concerned. He attacked an
excellent dinner without discomfort to himself, and when he had
finished he bethought himself of the bell, and finding it under
the edge of the table, he pressed the button. He had not long to
wait; he heard the faint hum of machinery and walked across to
the barred gate of the lift, his pistol ready. He waited, his
eyes fixed up at the black square through which he expected the
lift to sink, and heard himself suddenly called by name.</p>

<p>He turned; Doctor Fall was standing in the centre of the room.
By what means he had arrived there was no evidence to show.</p>

<p>"I hope I did not surprise you," said the doctor, with his
quiet smile; "I did not come the way you expected. There are
three entrances to this room, and they are all equally difficult
to negotiate."</p>

<p>"May I inquire the meaning of this outrage?" asked
Poltavo.</p>

<p>"Your virtuous indignation does you credit, Count," said the
doctor. He sat down by the table, took a cigar-case from his
pocket, and offered it to his unwilling guest.</p>

<p>"You do not smoke; I am sorry. Would you like a
cigarette?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I have all the cigarettes I require," said
Poltavo, briefly.</p>

<p>The doctor did not speak until he had leisurely bitten off the
end of a cigar and lit it.</p>

<p>"As I say," he went on, "I admire your sang froid. The word
'outrage' comes curiously from you, Count, but I am merely
carrying out Mr. Farrington's wishes, when I say that I am
perfectly willing to explain your present unhappy position. In
some way you have made our friend very angry," he went on,
easily; "and at present he is disposed to treat you with
considerable harshness, to mete out the same harsh justice, in
fact, that he accorded to two of the people who were engaged in
the building of this house, and who were predisposed to blackmail
him with a threat of betrayal."</p>

<p>"I knew nothing of these," said Poltavo.</p>

<p>"Then you are one of the few people in London who do not,"
said Dr. Fall, with a smile. "One was an architect, the other a
fairly efficient man of a type you will find on the continent of
Europe, and who will be an electrician's assistant or a waiter
with equal felicity. These men were engaged to assist in the
construction of the house. They were brought from Italy with a
number of other workmen, and entrusted with a section of its
completion. Not satisfied with the handsome pay they received for
their workmanship, they instituted a system of blackmail which
culminated one night at Brakely Square in their untimely
death."</p>

<p>"Did Farrington kill them?" gasped Poltavo.</p>

<p>"I will not go so far as to say that," said the suave
secretary; "I only say that they died. Unfortunately for them,
they were acting independently of one another and quarreled
violently when they found that they had both come upon a similar
errand, having at last identified the mysterious gentleman, who
had commissioned the house, with Gregory Farrington, a worthy and
blackmailable millionaire."</p>

<p>"So that was it," said Poltavo, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"What a fool I was not to understand, not to see the
connection. They were shot dead outside Farrington's house. Who
else could have committed the crime but he?"</p>

<p>"Again, I will not go so far as to say that," repeated the
secretary; "I merely remark that the men died a most untimely
death, as a result of their eagerness to extract advantages from
Mr. Farrington, which he was not prepared to offer. You, Count
Poltavo, are in some danger of sharing the same fate."</p>

<p>"I have been in tighter holes than this," smiled Poltavo, but
he was uneasy.</p>

<p>"Do not boast," said the doctor quietly. "I doubt very much
whether in your life you have been in so tight a hole as you are
in now. We are quite prepared to kill you; I tell you that much,
because Mr. Farrington does not ordinarily take risks. In your
case, however, he is prepared, just so long as you are impressed
with his power to punish, to give you one chance of life. Whether
you take that chance or not entirely depends upon yourself. He
will not extract any oaths or promises or pledges of any kind; he
will release you with the assurance that if you will serve him
you will be handsomely rewarded, and if you fail him you will be
most handsomely killed; do I make myself clear?"</p>

<p>"Very," said Poltavo, and the hand that raised the cigarette
to his lips trembled a little.</p>

<p>"I would like to add," began the doctor, when the shrill sound
of a ringing bell rang through the vaulted apartment. Fall sprang
up, walked quietly to the wall, and placed his ear against a
portion which appeared to be no different to any other, but
which, as Poltavo gathered, concealed a hidden telephone.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he asked. He listened. "Very good," he said.</p>

<p>He turned to Poltavo, and surveyed him gravely.</p>

<p>"You will be interested to learn," he said, "that the house is
entirely surrounded by police. You have evidently been followed
here."</p>

<p>A light sprang into Poltavo's eyes.</p>

<p>"That is very awkward for you," he said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"More awkward for you, I think," said Doctor Fall, walking
slowly to the farthermost wall of the room.</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Poltavo.</p>

<p>The doctor turned. He was covered by the black barrel of
Poltavo's pistol.</p>

<p>"I beg to assure you," said the Count mockingly, "that this
pistol is loaded with two small cartridges which I found in my
waistcoat pocket, and which I usually carry in case of emergency.
There is at any rate sufficient&mdash;"</p>

<p>He said no more, for suddenly the room was plunged in
darkness, the lights were extinguished by an unseen hand as at
some signal, and a mocking laugh came back to him from where Fall
had stood.</p>

<p>"Shoot!" said the voice, but the two cartridges were too
precious for Poltavo to take any risks in the dark. He stood
waiting, suddenly heard a click, and then the lights came up
again. He was alone in the room. He shrugged his shoulders; there
was nothing to do but wait.</p>

<p>If T.B. Smith had followed him here, and if he had taken the
drastic step of surrounding the house with police, there was hope
that he might be rescued from his present unhappy plight. If not,
he had the promise which Farrington had given of his release on
terms.</p>

<p>He heard the whirr of the descending lift; this time it was
the elevator by which he himself had descended. It came to a halt
at the floor level and the steel gates swung open invitingly. He
must take his chance; anyway, anything was better than remaining
in this underground room.</p>

<p>He stepped into the lift and pulled the gates close after him.
To his surprise they answered readily, and as the lock snapped
the lift went upwards slowly. Two overhanging electric lamps
illuminated the little elevator. They were dangerous to him. With
the steel barrel of his pistol he smashed the bulbs and crouched
down in the darkness, his finger on the trigger, ready for any
emergency.</p>

<p>T.B. Smith was standing in the hall, and behind him three
hard-featured men from the Yard. Before him was Dr. Fall,
imperturbable and obeying as ever.</p>

<p>"You are perfectly at liberty to search the house," he was
saying, "and, as far as Count Poltavo is concerned, there is no
mystery whatever. He is one of the people who have been attracted
here by curiosity, and at the present moment he is inspecting the
wonders of our beautiful establishment."</p>

<p>There was something of truth in his ironic tone, and T.B. was
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Will you kindly produce Count Poltavo?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said the secretary.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that the lift door opened and Poltavo
stepped out, pistol in hand.</p>

<p>He saw the group and took in its significance. He had now to
decide in that moment with whom he should run. His mind was made
up quickly; he knew he had no friends in the police force;
whatever prosperity awaited him must come from Farrington and his
influence.</p>

<p>"An interesting weapon you have in your hand, Count," drawled
T.B. "Do I understand that you have been inspecting the art
treasures of the Secret House in some fear of your life?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Poltavo, as he slipped the pistol into his
pocket. "I have merely been engaged in a little pistol practice
in the underground shooting gallery; it is an interesting place;
you should see it."</p>

<p>Dr. Fall's eyes did not leave the face of his late prisoner,
and Poltavo saw an approving gleam in the dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I should not, ordinarily, take the trouble to inspect your
shooting gallery," said T.B. Smith with a smile, "because I know
that you are not speaking the exact truth, Count Poltavo. My own
impression is that you have every reason to be thankful for my
arrival. In the present circumstances, perhaps, it would be
advisable to look over a portion of your domain which, so far,
has escaped my inspection."</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It is hardly a shooting gallery, but since it is so far
removed from the living portion of the house we sometimes use it
for that purpose," he said. "I have not the slightest objection
to your descending."</p>

<p>T.B. entered the lift. It was in darkness, as a result of
Poltavo's precautions.</p>

<p>"I will go alone," said T.B., and Fall, with a little bow,
closed the gates, and the lift descended.</p>

<p>They waited some time; Fall had the power, from where he was,
of closing the gates below and bringing the lift up again. This
Poltavo knew to his cost, but there were good reasons why the
doctor should not exercise his knowledge, and in a few minutes
the lift came back to its original position and T.B. stepped
out.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I have learned all I want to know," he said with a
keen glance at Poltavo. "Really, you have an extraordinary house,
Dr. Fall."</p>

<p>"It is always open to your inspection," said the doctor, with
a heavy smile.</p>

<p>T.B. was fingering the little electric lamp, which he carried
in his hand, in an absent-minded manner. Presently he put it
into his pocket, and, with a nod to his host, walked across the
hall. He turned suddenly and addressed Poltavo.</p>

<p>"When you were trapped in this house," he said, quietly, "and
expected considerable trouble in escaping from the trap, you took
the precaution, like the careful man that you are, of inscribing
a message which might aid those who came to your relief. This
message has now served its purpose," he smiled, as he saw the
look of consternation on Poltavo's face, "and you will be well
advised to invite your friend to wipe it out"; and with another
nod he passed from the house, followed by his three men.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" asked Fall, quickly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;" stammered Poltavo, flustered for once in
his life, "wrote on the side of the lift a few words only,
nothing incriminating, my dear doctor, just a line to say that I
was imprisoned below."</p>

<p>With a curse Fall dashed into the little elevator.</p>

<p>"Bring a light," he said, and struck a match to read the
scrawl which Poltavo had written. Fortunately there was nothing
in it which betrayed the great secret of the house, but it was
enough, as he realized, to awaken the dormant suspicion, even
supposing it was dormant, of this indefatigable detective.</p>

<p>"You have made a nice mess of things," he said to Poltavo,
sternly; "see that you do not make a greater. We will forgive you
once, but the second attempt will be fatal."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">THE distant chime of Little Bradley church had
struck one o'clock, when T.B. Smith stepped from the shadow of
the hedge on the east side of the Secret House, and walked slowly
toward the road. Two men, crouched in the darkness, rose silently
to meet him.</p>

<p>"I think I have found a place," said T.B., in a low voice. "As
I thought, there are electric alarms on the top of the walls, and
electric wires threaded through all the hedges. There is a break,
however, where, I think, I can circumvent the alarm."</p>

<p>He led the way back to the place from which he had been making
his reconnaissance.</p>

<p>"Here it is," said T.B.</p>

<p>He touched a thin twine-like wire with his finger.</p>

<p>The third man put the concentrated ray of an electric lamp
upon it.</p>

<p>"I can make another circuit for this," he said, and pulled a
length of wire from his pocket. Two minutes later, thanks to
quick manipulation of his wire, they were able to step in safety
across the wall and drop noiselessly into the grounds.</p>

<p>"We shall find a man on duty," whispered T.B.; "he is
patrolling the house, and I have an idea that there are
trip-wires on the lawn."</p>

<p>He had fixed a funnel-like arrangement to the head of his
lamp, and now he carefully scrutinized the ground as he walked
forward. The funnel was so fixed that it showed no light save on
the actual patch of ground he was surveying.</p>

<p>"Here is one," he said, suddenly.</p>

<p>The party stepped cautiously over the almost invisible line of
wire, supported a few inches from the ground by steel uprights,
placed at regular intervals.</p>

<p>"They fix these every night after sunset; I have watched them
doing it," said T.B. "There is another line nearer the
house."</p>

<p>They found this, too, and carefully negotiated it.</p>

<p>"Down!" whispered T.B. suddenly, and the party sank flat on
the turf.</p>

<p>Ela for a moment could not see the cause for alarm, but
presently he discerned the slow moving figure of the sentry as it
passed between them and the house. The man was walking leisurely
along, and even in the starlight they could see the short rifle
slung at his shoulder. They waited until he had disappeared round
the corner of the house, and then crossed the remaining space of
lawn. T.B. had been carrying a little canvas bag, and now he put
his hand inside and withdrew by the ears a struggling rabbit.</p>

<p>"Little friend," he whispered, "You must be sacrificed in the
cause of scientific criminal investigation."</p>

<p>He mounted the steps which led to the entrance hall. The
steel-beaded curtain still hung before the door almost brushing
the mat as he had seen it. He released the rabbit, and the
startled beast, after a vain attempt to escape back to the lawn,
went with hesitating hop on to the mat, and then, at a
threatening gesture from T.B., pushed his nose to the hanging
curtain to penetrate his way to safety. Instantly as he touched
it there was a quick flicker of blue light, and the unfortunate
animal was hurled back past T.B. to the gravel path below. The
detective descended hastily and picked it up. It was quite dead.
He felt the singed hair about its head, and murmured a
sympathetic "vale."</p>

<p>"As I suspected," he said in a low voice, "an electric
death-trap for anybody trying to get into the house that way.
Now, Johnson."</p>

<p>The third man was busy pulling out a pair of rubber boots; he
took from his pocket a pair of thick rubber gloves, and made his
way with confidence up the steps. He leant down and tried to pull
the mat from its place, but that was impossible. He gathered up
the beads cautiously with his hands; he was free, by reason of
his boots and his hand-covering, from the danger of a shock, but
he took good care that no portion of the curtain touched any
other part of his body. Very cautiously he drew the bead "chick"
aside, looping it back by means of strong rubber bands, and then
T.B. went forward. In the meantime he had followed the other's
example, and had drawn stout rubber galoshes over his feet and
had put on gloves of a similar material. The lock that he had
noticed earlier in the day was of a commonplace type; the only
danger was that the inmates had taken the precaution of bolting
or chaining the door, but apparently they were content with the
protection which their electric curtain might reasonably be
expected to afford. The door opened after a brief manipulation of
keys, and T.B. stepped into the hall. He listened, all his senses
strained, for the sound of a warning bell, but none came. Ela and
the other man followed.</p>

<p>"Better remain in the hall," said T.B. "We shall have to
chance the guard not noticing what has happened to the curtain,
anyway; perhaps he will not be round for some time," he added,
hopefully.</p>

<p>They made a quick scrutiny of the hall, and found no
indication of cables or of wires which would suggest that an
alarm had been fixed. T.B. stole carefully up the stairs, leaving
the two men to guard the hall below. At every landing he halted,
and listened, but the house was wrapped in silence, and he
searched the third floor without mishap.</p>

<p>He recognized the corridor, having taken very careful note of
certain peculiarities, and a scratch on the side of the lift
door, which he had mentally noted for future reference, showed
him he was on the right track.</p>

<p>Unerringly and swiftly he passed along the passage till he
came to the big rosewood doors which opened upon the invalid's
bedroom. He turned the handle gently, it yielded, and he stepped
noiselessly through the door, and pushed the inner door
cautiously. The room was dimly illuminated, evidently by a night
light, thought T.B., and he pressed the door farther open that he
might secure a better view of the apartment, and then he gasped,
for this was not the room he had been in before.</p>

<p>It was a sumptuously arranged bureau, paneled in rosewood, and
set about with costly furniture. A man was sitting at the desk,
busily writing by the light of a table lamp; his back was toward
T.B. The detective pushed the door farther open, and suddenly the
man at the desk leapt up, and turning round, confronted the
midnight visitor.</p>

<p>T.B. had only time to see that his face was hidden behind a
black mask which extended from his forehead to his chin. As soon
as he saw T.B. standing in the doorway, he reached out his hand.
Instantly the room was in darkness, and the door, which T.B. was
holding ajar, was suddenly forced back as if by an irresistible
power, flinging the detective into the corridor, which almost
simultaneously was flooded with light. T.B. turned to meet the
smiling face of Dr. Fall.</p>

<p>The big man, with his white, expressionless countenance, was
regarding him gravely, and with amused resentment.</p>

<p>Where he had come from T.B. could only conjecture; he had
appeared as if by magic and was fully dressed.</p>

<p>"To what do I owe the honour of this visit, Mr. Smith?" he
said, in his dry, grim way.</p>

<p>"A spirit of curiosity," said T.B., coolly. "I was anxious to
secure another peep at your Mr. Moole."</p>

<p>"And how did he look?" asked the other, with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," said T.B., "I have mistaken the floor, and
instead of seeing our friend, I have unexpectedly and quite
unwittingly interrupted a gentleman who, for reasons best known
to himself, has hidden his face."</p>

<p>Dr. Fall frowned.</p>

<p>"I do not quite follow you," he said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if I were to follow you back to the room," said T.B.
good humouredly, "you might understand better."</p>

<p>He heard a strange wailing sound and a shivering motion
beneath his feet, as though a heavy traction engine were passing
close to the house.</p>

<p>"What is that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is one of the unpleasant consequences of building one's
house over a disused coal-mine," said the doctor easily; "but as
regards your strange hallucination," he went on, "I should rather
like to disabuse your mind of your fantastic vision."</p>

<p>He walked slowly back to the room which T.B. had quitted, and
the inner door yielded to his touch. It was in darkness. Dr. Fall
put his hand inside the room and there was a click of a
switch.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said, and T.B. stepped into the room.</p>

<p>It was the room he had left in the earlier part of the day.
There was the blue square of carpet and the silver bedstead, and
the same yellow face and unwinking eyes of the patient. The walls
were paneled in myrtle, the same electrolier hung from the
ceiling as he had seen on his previous visit. Smith gasped, and
passed his hand over his forehead.</p>

<p>"You see," said the secretary, "you have been the victim of a
peculiar and unhappy trick of eyesight; in fact, Mr. Smith, may I
suggest that you have been dreaming?"</p>

<p>"You may suggest just what you like," said T.B. pleasantly. "I
should like to see the room below and the room above."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said the other; "there is a storeroom up
above which you may see if you wish."</p>

<p>He led the way upstairs, unlocked the door of the room
immediately over that which they had just left, and entered; The
room was bare, and the plain deal floor, the distempered walls,
and the high skylight showed it to be just as the doctor had
described, a typical storeroom.</p>

<p>"You do not seem to use it," said T.B.</p>

<p>"We are very tidy people," smiled the doctor; "and now you
shall see the room below."</p>

<p>As they went down the stairs again they heard the curious
wail, and T.B. experienced a tremulous jar which he had noted
before.</p>

<p>"Unpleasant, is it not?" said Dr. Fall. "I was quite alarmed
at that at first, but it has no unpleasant consequences."</p>

<p>On the second floor he entered the third room, immediately
below that in which the sick Mr. Moole was lying. He unlocked
this door and they entered a well-furnished bedroom; on a more
elaborate scale than that which T.B. had seen before.</p>

<p>"This is our spare bedroom," said Dr. Fall, easily; "we seldom
use it."</p>

<p>T.B. slipped into the apartment and made a quick scrutiny.
There was nothing of a suspicious character here.</p>

<p>"I hope you are satisfied now," said Dr. Fall as he led the
way out, "and that your two friends below are not growing
impatient."</p>

<p>"You have seen them, then," said T.B.</p>

<p>"I have seen them," said the other gravely. "I saw them a few
moments after you entered the hall. You see, Mr. Smith," he went
on, "we do not employ anything so vulgar as bells to alarm us.
When the entrance door opens, a red light shows above my bed.
Unfortunately, the moment you came in I happened to be in an
adjoining room at work. I had to go into my bedroom to get a
paper, when I saw the light. So, though I am perhaps inaccurate
in saying that I have been keeping you under observation from the
moment you arrived, there was little you did which was not
witnessed. I will show you, if you will be good enough to
accompany me to my room."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted," said T.B.</p>

<p>He was curious to learn anything that the house or its
custodian could teach him. Dr. Fall's room was on the first
floor, immediately over the entrance hall, a plain office with a
door leading to a cosily, though comparatively expensively
furnished bedroom. By the side of the doctor's bed was a round
pillar, which looked for all the world like one of those
conventional and useless articles of furniture which the suburban
housewife employs to balance a palm upon.</p>

<p>"Look down into that," said the doctor.</p>

<p>T.B. obeyed. It was quite hollow, and a little way down was
what appeared to be a square sheet of silver paper. It was unlike
any other silver paper because it appeared to be alive. He could
see figures standing against it, two figures that he had no
difficulty in recognizing as Ela and Johnson.</p>

<p>"It is a preparation of my own," said the doctor. "I thought
of taking out a patent for it. An adjustment of mirrors throws
the image upon a luminous screen which is so sensitive to light
that it can record an impression of your two friends even in the
semi-darkness of the hall."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said T.B.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to accept his defeat as graciously
as possible. For baffled he was, caught at every turn, and
puzzled, moreover, by his extraordinary experience.</p>

<p>"You will find some difficulty in opening the door," said the
pleasant Doctor Fall.</p>

<p>"In that I think you are mistaken," smiled T.B.</p>

<p>The doctor stopped to switch on the light, and the two
discomforted detectives watched the scene curiously.</p>

<p>"We have left the door ajar."</p>

<p>"Still I think you will find a difficulty in getting out,"
insisted the other. "Open the door."</p>

<p>Ela pulled at it, but it was impossible to move the heavy
oaken panel.</p>

<p>"Electrically controlled," said the doctor; "and you can
neither move it one way nor the other. It is an ingenious idea of
mine, for which I may also apply for a patent one of these
days."</p>

<p>He took a key from his pocket and inserted it in an almost
invisible hole in the oak panelling of the hall; instantly the
door opened slowly.</p>

<p>"I wish you a very good night," said Doctor Fall, as they
stood on the steps. "I hope we shall meet again."</p>

<p>"You may be sure," said T.B. Smith, grimly, "that we
shall."</p>

<h2><a id="chap13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="first">DORIS GRAY was face to face with a dilemma. She
stood in a tragic position; even now, she could not be sure that
her guardian was dead. But dead or alive, he had left her a
terrible problem, for terrible it seemed to her, for
solution.</p>

<p>She liked Frank Doughton well enough, but she was perhaps too
young, had too small a knowledge of the great elements of life to
appreciate fully her true feelings in the matter; and then the
influence of this polished man of the world, this Count of the
Roman Empire as he described himself, with his stories of foreign
capitals, his easy conversation, his acquaintance with all the
niceties of social intercourse, had made a profound impression
upon her. At the moment, she might not say with any certainty,
whether she preferred the young Englishman or this suave man of
the world.</p>

<p>The balance was against Frank, and the command contained in
the will, the knowledge that she must, so she told herself, make
something of a sacrifice, was a subject for resentment. Not even
the sweetest girl in the world, obeying as she thought the
command of a dead man, who was especially fond and proud of her,
could be compensated for the fact that he had laid upon her his
dead hands, charging her to obey a command which might very
easily be repugnant and hateful to her.</p>

<p>She did not, in truth, wish to marry anybody. She could well
afford to allow the question of her fortune to lapse; she had at
least five years in which to make up her mind, as to how she felt
toward Frank Doughton. She liked him, there was something
especially invigorating and wholesome in his presence and in his
very attitude towards her. He was so courteous, so kindly, so
full of quick, strong sympathy and yet&mdash;there were some
depths he could not touch, she told herself, and was vague
herself as to what those depths were.</p>

<p>She was strolling in Green Park on a glorious April morning,
in a complacent mood, for the trees were in fresh green bud and
the flower beds were a blaze of colour, when she met Frank, and
Frank was so obviously exhilarated that something of his
enthusiasm was conveyed to her. He saw her before she had seen
him, and came with quickening footsteps toward her.</p>

<p>"I say," he said explosively, "I have some splendid news!"</p>

<p>"Let us sit down," she said, with a kindly smile, and made a
place for him by her side on a bench near by. "Now, what is this
wonderful news?"</p>

<p>"You remember Mr. Farrington gave me a commission to find the
missing heir of Tollington?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, I have found him," he said, triumphantly; "it is an
extraordinary thing," he went on, "that I should have done so,
because I am not a detective. I told Mr. Farrington quite a long
time ago that I never expected to make any discovery which would
be of any use to him. You see Mr. Farrington was not able to give
me any very definite data to work on. It appears that old
Tollington had a nephew, the son of his dead sister, and it was
to this nephew that his fortune was left. Tollington's sister had
been engaged to a wealthy Chicago stockbroker, and the day before
the wedding she had run away with an Englishman, with whom her
family was acquainted, but about whom they knew very little. She
guessed that he was a ne'er-do-well, who had come out to the
States to redeem his fallen fortune. But he was not a common
adventurer apparently, for he not only refused to communicate
with the girl's parents, although he knew they were tremendously
wealthy, but he never allowed them to know his real name. It
appears that he was in Chicago under a name which was not his
own. From that moment they lost sight of him. In a roundabout way
they learned that he had gone back to England and that he had by
his own efforts and labours established himself there. This news
was afterwards confirmed. The girl was in the habit of writing
regularly to her parents, giving neither her surname nor address.
They answered through the columns of the London Times. That is
how, though they knew where she was situated, all efforts to get
in touch with her proved to be unavailing; and when her parents
died, and her brother renewed his search, he was met with a blank
wall. You see," Frank went on, a little naively, "it is quite
impossible to discover anybody when their name is not even known
to one."</p>

<p>"I see," smiled the girl; "and have you succeeded where all
these people have failed?"</p>

<p>"I have hardly progressed so far as that," he laughed. "What I
have discovered is this: that the man, who seventy years ago left
the United States with the sister of old Tollington, lived for
some years in Great Bradley."</p>

<p>"Great Bradley!" she said, in surprise; "why, isn't that where
Lady Constance Dex lives?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Everybody seems to live there," he said, ruefully; "even our
friend," he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Our friend?" she repeated, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Your friend Poltavo is there now," he said, "permanently
established as the guest of Dr. Fall. You have heard of the
Secret House?&mdash;but everybody in England has heard of
it."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that everybody does not include me," she smiled,
"but go on with your story; how did you find that he lived in
Great Bradley?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was rather a case of luck," he explained. "You see,
I lived some years in Great Bradley myself; that is where I first
met your uncle. I was a little boy at the time. But it wasn't my
acquaintance with Great Bradley which helped me. Did you see in
the paper the other day the fact that, in pulling down an old
post office building, a number of letters were discovered which
had evidently slipped through the floor of the old letter-box,
and had not been delivered?"</p>

<p>"I read something about it," she smiled; "forty or fifty years
old, were they not?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"One of these," he said, quietly, "was addressed to
Tollington, and was signed by his sister. I saw it this morning
at the General Post Office. I happened to spot the paragraph,
which was sent in to my paper, to the effect that these letters
had been undelivered for forty or fifty years, and fortunately
our correspondent at Great Bradley had secured a list of the
addresses. I saw that one of these was to George Tollington of
Chicago, and on the off chance I went down to Great Bradley.
Thanks to the courtesy of the Postmaster-General I was able to
copy the letter. It was a short one."</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pocket and produced a sheet of paper.</p>

<br>

<p class="first"><i>"<span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,"</i>
he read, <i>"this is just to tell you that we are quite well and
prosperous. I saw your advertisement in the Times newspaper and
was pleased to hear from you. Henry sends to you his kindest
regards and duties.</i></p>

<p><i>"Your loving sister,</i></p>

<p><i>"<span class="smcap">Annie</span>."</i></p>

<br>

<p>"Of course, it is not much to go on," he said apologetically,
folding the letter up and replacing it in his pocket. "I suppose
Great Bradley has had a constant procession of Annies, but at any
rate it is something."</p>

<p>"It is indeed," she smiled.</p>

<p>"It means quite a lot to me, or at least it did," he corrected
himself. "I had an arrangement with your uncle, which was
approved by the other trustees of the estate. It means a
tremendous lot," he repeated. There was some significance in his
tone and she looked up to him quickly.</p>

<p>"In money?" she asked.</p>

<p>"In other things," he said, lowering his voice. "Doris, I have
not had an opportunity of saying how sorry I am about the will;
it is hateful that you should be forced by the wishes of your
guardian to take a step which may be unpleasant to you."</p>

<p>She coloured a little and turned her eyes away.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do not want to take advantage of that wish," he
went on awkwardly. "I want you to be happy. I want you to come to
me for no other reason than the only one that is worth while;
that you have learned to care for me as I care for you."</p>

<p>Still she made no response and he sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"Some day," he said, wistfully, "I had hoped to bring in my
hands all the material advantages which a man can offer to the
woman he loves."</p>

<p>"And do you think that would make a difference?" she asked
quickly.</p>

<p>"It would make this difference," he replied, in the same quiet
tone, "that you could not think of me as one who loved you for
your fortune, or one who hoped to gain anything from the marriage
but the dearest, sweetest woman in the world."</p>

<p>The eyes which she turned upon him were bright with unshed
tears.</p>

<p>"I do not know how I feel, Frank," she said. "I am almost as
much a mystery to myself as I must be to you. I care for you in a
way, but I am not sure that I care for you as you would like me
to."</p>

<p>"Is there anybody else?" he asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>She avoided his glance, and sat twining the cord of her
sunshade about her fingers.</p>

<p>"There is nobody else&mdash;definitely," she said.</p>

<p>"Or tentatively?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"There are always tentative people in life," she smiled,
parrying his question. "I think, Frank, you stand as great a
chance as anybody." She shrugged her shoulders. "I speak as
though I were some wonderful prize to be bestowed; I assure you I
do not feel at all like that. I have a very humble opinion of my
own qualities. I do not think I have felt so meek or so modest
about my own qualities as I do just now."</p>

<p>He walked with her to the end of the park, and saw her into a
taxicab, standing on the pavement and watching as she was whirled
into the enveloping traffic, out of sight.</p>

<p>As for Doris Gray, she herself was suffering from some
uneasiness of mind. She needed a shock to make her realize one
way or the other where her affections lay. Poltavo loomed very
largely; his face, his voice, the very atmosphere which enveloped
him, was constantly present with her.</p>

<p>She reached Brakely Square and would have passed straight up
to her room, but the butler, with an air of importance, stopped
her.</p>

<p>"I have a letter here, miss. It is very urgent. The messenger
asked that it should be placed in your hands at the earliest
possible moment."</p>

<p>She took the letter from him. It was addressed to her in
typewritten characters. She stripped the envelope and found yet
another inside. On it was typewritten:</p>

<br>

<p class="typewriter">Read this letter when you are absolutely
alone. Lock the door and be sure that nobody is near when you
read it.</p>

<br>


<p>She raised her pretty eyebrows. What mystery was this? she
asked. Still, she was curious enough to carry out the request.
She went straight to her own room, opened the envelope, and took
out a letter containing half a dozen lines of writing.</p>

<p>She gasped, and went white, for she recognized the hand the
moment her eyes fell upon it. The letter she held in her shaking
hand ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">I command you to marry Frank Doughton within
seven days. My whole fortune and my very life may depend upon
this.</p>

<br>

<p>It was signed "Gregory Farrington," and heavily underlined
beneath the signature were the words, <i>"Burn this, as you
value my safety."</i></p>

<p><br>
T.B. SMITH stepped briskly into the office of his chief and
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>"What is the news?" asked Sir George, looking up.</p>

<p>"I can tell you all the news that I know," said T.B., "and a
great deal that I do not know, but only surmise."</p>

<p>"Let us hear the facts first and the romance afterwards,"
growled Sir George, leaning back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Fact one," said T.B. drawing up a chair to the table, and
ticking off his fact on the first finger of his hand, "is that
Gregory Farrington is alive, The man whose body was picked up in
the Thames is undoubtedly the gentleman who was shot in the raid
upon the Custom House. The inference is, that Gregory was the
second party in the raid, and that the attempt to secure the
trunk of the admirable Dr. Goldworthy was carefully conceived.
The box apparently contained a diary which gave away Gregory to
one who had it in her power to do him an immense amount of
harm."</p>

<p>"You refer to Lady Constance Dex?" asked the chief,
interestedly.</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"That is the lady," he said. "Evidently Farrington has played
it pretty low down upon her; was responsible for the death of her
lover, and, moreover, for a great deal of her unhappiness.
Farrington was the man who told George Doughton about some
scandal of her youth, and Doughton, that high-spirited man, went
straight off to Africa without communicating with the lady or
discovering how far she was guilty in the matter. The documents
in the box would, I surmise, prove this to Lady Dex's
satisfaction, and Farrington, who was well informed through his
agents on the Coast, would have every reason for preventing these
letters getting into the hands of a woman who would be
remorseless in her vengeance."</p>

<p>"Is that fact established?" asked the chief.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," said T.B.</p>

<p>He took some papers out of his pocket and laid them on the
desk before him.</p>

<p>"I have now got a copy of the letter which the dead lover
wrote to Lady Constance. I need not say," he said lightly, "how I
obtained possession of this, but we in our department do not
hesitate to adopt the most drastic methods&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know all about that," said the chief, with a little smile;
"there was burglary at the rectory two days ago, and I presume
your interesting burglar was your own Private Sikes."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said T.B. cheerfully. "Fact number two," he went
on, "is that Gregory Farrington and the international blackmailer
named Montague Fallock are one and the same person."</p>

<p>The chief looked up.</p>

<p>"You do not mean that?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed," said T.B. "That interesting paragraph in the
will of the late Mr. Farrington confirms this view. The will was
especially prepared to put me off the scent. Letters which have
been received by eminent personages signed 'Montague Fallock' and
demanding, as usual, money with threats of exposure have recently
been received and confirm this theory."</p>

<p>"Where is Montague Fallock now?"</p>

<p>"Montague Fallock is an inmate of the Secret House," said
T.B.</p>

<p>"It seems pretty easy to take him, does it not?" asked Sir
George, in surprise. "Have you moved in the matter?"</p>

<p>T.B. shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is not so easy as you imagine," he said. "The Secret House
contains more secrets than we can at present unravel. It was
built, evidently and obviously, by a man of extraordinary
mechanical genius as Farrington was, and the primary object with
which it was built was to enable him on some future occasion to
make his escape. I am perfectly certain that any attempt to raid
the house would result immediately in the bird flying. We have
got to wait patiently."</p>

<p>"What I cannot understand," said his chief, after awhile, "is
why he should make a dramatic exit from the world."</p>

<p>"That is the easiest of all to explain," smiled T.B. "He was
scared; he knew that I identified him with the missing Fallock;
he knew, too, that I strongly suspected him of the murder of the
two men in Brakely Square. Don't you see the whole thing fits
together? He imported from various places on the Continent, and
at various periods, workmen of every kind to complete the house
at Great Bradley. Although he began his work thirty years ago,
the actual finishing touches have not been made until within the
last few years. Those finishing touches were the most essential.
I have discovered that the two men who were shot in Brakely
Square, were separately and individually employed in making
certain alterations to the house and installing certain
machinery.</p>

<p>"One was a young architect, the other was a general utility
man. They were unknown to each other; each did his separate piece
of work and was sent back to his native land. By some mischance
they succeeded in discovering who their employer was, and they
both arrived, unfortunately for them, simultaneously at the door
of Fallock or Farrington's house with the object of blackmailing
him. Farrington overheard the conversation; he admitted as
much.</p>

<p>"He stood at the door, saw them flourishing their pistols and
thought it was an excellent opportunity to rid himself of a very
serious danger. He shot them from the doorway, closed the doorway
behind him, and returned the revolver to its drawer in his study,
and came down in time to meet the policeman with energetic
protestations of his terror. I smelt the powder when I went into
the house; there is no mistaking the smell of cordite fired in so
confined a place as the hallway of a house. And Lady Dex was also
there; she must have witnessed the shooting."</p>

<p>"Why did she come?" asked the chief.</p>

<p>"My conjecture is that she came either to confront Farrington
with evidence of his complicity, which is unlikely, or else to
secure confirmation of the story her lover told in his last
letter."</p>

<p>"But why shouldn't Farrington disappear in an ordinary
way&mdash;or why need he disappear at all?" asked Sir George. "He
had plenty of credit in the city. He had the handling of his
niece's fortune. He could have blocked out your suspicion; he is
not the kind of man to be scared of a little thing like
that."</p>

<p>"That is where I am at sea," said T.B. "I must confess his
disappearance is not consistent with his known character. He
certainly had the fortune of the girl, and I have no doubt in my
mind that he has a very genuine affection for his niece. Her
inheritance, by the way, falls due next month; I do not suppose
that had anything to do with it. If he had robbed her of it, or
he had dissipated this money which was left in his care, one
could have understood it, but the fact that he is dead will not
restore the fortune if it is gone."</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked the chief.</p>

<p>"About Farrington?" asked T.B. "I am having the house kept
under observation, and I am taking whatever precautions I can to
prevent our friend from being scared. I am even attempting to
lure him into the open. Once I can catch him outside of the
Secret House, I think he will be a clever man to escape."</p>

<p>"And Poltavo?"</p>

<p>"He is in town," said T.B. "I think he will be a fairly easy
man to circumvent; he is obviously acting now as the agent of our
friend Farrington, and he is horribly proud of himself!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">AS T.B. had said, Poltavo had returned from his
brief sojourn in Great Bradley, and emerged into society a new
and more radiant being than ever he had been before.</p>

<p>There had always been some doubt as to the Count's exact
financial position, and cautious hostesses had hesitated before
they had invited this plausible and polished man to their social
functions. There were whispers adverse as to his standing; there
were even bold people who called into question his right to
employ the title which graced his visiting cards. There were half
a dozen Poltavos in the Almanack De Gotha, any one of whom might
have been Ernesto, for so vague is the Polish hierarchy that it
was impossible to fix him to any particular family, and he
himself answered careless inquiries with a cryptic smile which
might have meant anything.</p>

<p>But with his return to London, after his brief absence, there
was no excuse for any hostess, even the most sceptical, in
refusing to admit him to social equality on the ground of
poverty. The very day he returned he acquired the lease of a
house in Burlington Gardens, purchased two motor-cars, paying
cash down for an early delivery, gave orders left and right for
the enrichment of his person and his domicile, and in forty-eight
hours had established himself in a certain mode of living which
suggested that he had never known any other.</p>

<p>He had had his lesson and had profited thereby. He had
experienced an unpleasant fright, though he might not admit it to
Dr. Fall and his master; it was nevertheless a fact that,
realizing as he did that he had stood face to face with a
particularly unpleasant death, he had been seized by a panic
which had destroyed his ordinary equilibrium.</p>

<p>"You may trust me, my friend," he muttered to himself, as he
sorted over the papers on his brand-new desk in his brand-new
study, in a house which was still redolent of the painter's art
and presence. "You may trust me just so long as I find it
convenient for you to trust me, but you may be sure that never
again will I give you the benefit of my presence in the Secret
House."</p>

<p>He had come back with a large sum of money to carry out his
employer's plans. There were a hundred agents through the
country, particulars of whom Poltavo now had in his possession.
Innocent agents, and guilty agents; agents in high places and
active agents in the servants' hall. Undoubtedly Gossip's Corner
was a useful institution.</p>

<p>Farrington had not made a great deal of money from its sale;
indeed, as often as not, it showed a dead loss every year. But he
paid well for contributions which were sent to him, and offered a
price, which exceeded the standard rate of pay, for such
paragraphs as were acceptable.</p>

<p>Men and women, with a malicious desire to score off some
enemy, would send him items which the newspapers would publish if
they concerned somebody who might not be bled. Many of these
facts in an amended form were, in fact, printed.</p>

<p>But more often than not the paragraphs and articles which came
to the unknown editor dealt with scandal which it was impossible
to put into print. Nevertheless, the informant would be rewarded.
In some far-away country home a treacherous servant would receive
postal orders to his or her great delight, but the news she or he
had sent in their malice, a tit-bit concerning some poor erring
woman or some foolish man, would never see the light of day, and
the contributor might look in vain for the spicy paragraph which
had been composed with such labour.</p>

<p>The unfortunate subjects of domestic treachery would receive
in a day or two a letter from the mysterious Montague Fallock,
retailing, to their horror, those precious secrets which they had
imagined none knew but themselves. They would not associate the
gossipy little rag, which sometimes found its way to the
servants' hall, with the magnificent demand of this prince of
blackmailers, and more often than not they would pay to the
utmost of their ability to avoid exposure.</p>

<p>It was not only the servants' hall which supplied Montague
Fallock with all the material for his dastardly work. There were
men scarcely deserving the name, and women lost to all sense of
honour, who found in this little journal means by which they
could "come back" at those favoured people who had offered them
directly or indirectly some slight offence. Sometimes the
communication would reach the Gossip anonymously, but if the
facts retailed were sufficiently promising, one of Fallock's
investigators would be told off to discover how much truth there
was in it. A bland letter would follow, and the wretched victim
would emerge from the transaction the poorer in pocket and often
in health.</p>

<p>For this remorseless and ruthless man destroyed more than
fortunes; he trafficked in human lives. There had been half a
dozen mysterious suicides which had been investigated by Scotland
Yard, and found directly traceable to letters received in the
morning, and burnt by the despairing victim before his untimely
and violent departure from life.</p>

<p>The office of the paper was situated at the top of a building
in Fleet Street; one back room comprised the whole of its
editorial space, and one dour man its entire staff. It was his
duty to receive the correspondence as it came and to convey it to
the cloakroom of a London station. An hour later it would be
called for by a messenger and transferred to another cloakroom.
Eventually it would arrive in the possession of the man who was
responsible for the contents of the paper. Many of these letters
contained contributions in the ordinary way of business, a story
or two contributed by a more or less well-known writer. Fallock,
or Farrington, needed these outside contributions, not only to
give the newspaper a verisimilitude of genuineness, but also to
fill the columns of the journal.</p>

<p>He himself devoted his energies to two pages of shrewdly
edited tit-bits of information about the great. They were
carefully written, often devoid of any reference to the person
whom they affected, and were more or less innocuous. But in every
batch of letters there were always one or two which gave the
master blackmailer an opportunity for extracting money from
people, who had been betrayed by servants or friends. There was a
standing offer in the Gossip of five guineas for any paragraph
which might be useful to the editor, and it is a commentary upon
the morality of human nature that there were times when
Farrington paid out nearly a thousand pounds a week for the
information which his unscrupulous contributors gave him.</p>

<p>There was work here for Poltavo; he was an accomplished
scholar, and a shrewd man of affairs. If Farrington had been
forced to accept his service, having accepted them, he could do
no less than admit the wisdom of his choice. In his big study,
with the door locked, Poltavo carefully sorted the
correspondence, thinking the while.</p>

<p>If he played his cards well he knew his future was assured.
The consequence of his present employment, the misery it might
bring to the innocent and to the foolishly guilty alike, did not
greatly trouble him; he was perfectly satisfied with his own
position in the matter. He had found a means of livelihood, which
offered enormous rewards and the minimum of risk. In his brief
stay at the Secret House, Farrington had impressed upon him the
necessity for respecting trifles.</p>

<p>"If you can make five shillings out of a working man," was his
dictum, "make it. We cannot afford to despise the smallest
amount," and in consequence Poltavo was paying as much attention
to the ill-written and illiterate scrawls which came from the
East End of London, as he was to the equally illiterate efforts
of the under-butler, describing an error of his master's in a
northern ducal seat. Poltavo went through the letters
systematically, putting this epistle to the right, and that to
the left; this to make food for the newspaper; that, as a subject
for further operations. Presently he stopped and looked up at the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"So she must marry Frank Doughton within a week," he said to
himself in wonder.</p>

<p>Yes, Farrington had insisted upon carrying out his plans,
knowing the power he held, and he, Poltavo, had accepted the
ultimatum in all meekness of spirit.</p>

<p>"I must be losing my nerve," he muttered. "Married in a week!
Am I to give her up, this gracious, beautiful girl&mdash;with her
future, or without her fortune?"</p>

<p>He smiled, and it was not a pleasant smile to see. "No, my
friend, I think you have gone a little too far. You depended too
much upon my acquiescence. Ernesto, mon ami, you have to do some
quick thinking between now and next Monday."</p>

<p>A telephone buzzed at his elbow, and he took it off and
listened.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he asked, and then he recognized the speaker's voice,
and his voice went soft and caressing, for it was the voice of
Doris Gray that he heard.</p>

<p>"Can you see me to-morrow?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I can see you to-day, my lady, at once, if you wish it," he
said, lightly.</p>

<p>There was a little hesitation at the other end of the
wire.</p>

<p>"If you could, I should feel glad," she said. "I am rather
troubled."</p>

<p>"Not seriously, I hope?" he asked, anxiously,</p>

<p>"I have had a letter from some one," she said, meaningly.</p>

<p>"I think I understand," he replied; "some one wishes you to do
a thing which is a repugnant to you."</p>

<p>"I cannot say that," she said, and there was despair in her
voice; "all I know is that I am bewildered by the turn events
have taken. Do you know the contents of the letter?"</p>

<p>"I know," he said, gently; "it was my misfortune to be the
bearer of the communication."</p>

<p>"What do you think?" she asked, after a while.</p>

<p>"You know what I think," he said, passionately. "Can you
expect me to agree to this?"</p>

<p>The intensity of his voice frightened her, and she rapidly
strove to bring him down to a condition of normality.</p>

<p>"Come to-morrow," she said, hastily. "I would like to talk it
over with you."</p>

<p>"I will come at once," he said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better not," she hesitated.</p>

<p>"I am coming at once," he said, firmly, and hung up the
receiver.</p>

<p>In that moment of resentment against the tyranny of his
employer, he forgot all the dangers which the Secret House
threatened; all its swift and wicked vengeance. He only knew,
with the instinct of a beast of prey who saw its quarry stolen
under its very eyes, the loss which this man was inflicting upon
him. Five minutes later he was in Brakely Square with the girl.
She was pale and worried; there were dark circles round her eyes
which spoke eloquently of a sleepless night.</p>

<p>"I do not know what to do," she said. "I am very fond of
Frank. I can speak to you, can I not, Count Poltavo?"</p>

<p>"You may confide in me absolutely," he said, gravely.</p>

<p>"And yet I am not so fond of him," she went on, "that I can
marry him yet."</p>

<p>"Then why do you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"How can I disobey this?" She held the letter out.</p>

<p>He took it from her hand with a little smile, walked to the
fireplace and dropped it gently upon the glowing coals.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are not carrying out instructions," he said,
playfully.</p>

<p>There was something in this action which chilled her; he was
thinking more of his safety and his duty to Farrington than he
was of her, she thought: a curiously inconsistent view to take in
all the circumstances, but it was one which had an effect upon
her later actions.</p>

<p>"Now listen to me," he said, with his kindly smile; "you have
not to trouble about this; you are to go your own way and allow
me to make it right with Farrington. He is a very headstrong and
ambitious man, and there is some reason perhaps why he should
want you to marry Doughton, but as to that I will gain a little
more information. In the meantime you are to dismiss the matter
from your mind, leaving everything to me."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot do that," she said. "Unless I have a
letter from my guardian expressing wishes to the contrary, I must
carry out his desires. It is dreadful&mdash;dreadful!"&mdash;she
wrung her hands piteously,&mdash;"that I should be placed in this
wretched position. How can I help him by marrying Frank Doughton?
How can I save him&mdash;can you tell me?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Have you communicated with Mr. Doughton?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I sent him a letter," she hesitated. "I have kept a draft of
it; would you like to see it?"</p>

<p>A little shade of bitter anger swept across his face, but with
an effort he mastered himself.</p>

<p>"I should," he said, evenly.</p>

<p>She handed the sheet of paper to him.</p>

<br>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Frank</span>, it ran,</p>

<p class="letter">For some reason which I cannot explain
to you, it is necessary that the marriage which my uncle desired
should take place within the next week. You know my feelings
towards you; that I do not love you, and that if it were left to
my own wishes this marriage would not take place, but for a
reason which I cannot at the moment give you I must act contrary
to my own wishes. This is not a gracious nor an easy thing to say
to you, but I know you well enough, with your large, generous
heart and your kindly nature to realize that you will understand
something of the turmoil of feelings which at present dominate my
heart."</p>

<p><br>
Poltavo finished reading, and put the letter back on the
table; he walked up and down the room without saying a word, then
he turned on her suddenly.</p>

<p>"Madonna!" he said, in the liquid Southern accents of
his&mdash;he had spent his early life in Italy and the address
came naturally to him&mdash;"if Frank Doughton were I, would you
hesitate?"</p>

<p>A look of alarm came into the girl's eyes; he saw then his
mistake. He had confounded her response to his sympathy with a
deeper feeling which she did not possess. In that one glimpse he
saw more than she knew herself, that of the two Frank was the
preferable. He raised his hand and arrested her stammering
speech.</p>

<p>"There is no need to tell me," he smiled; "perhaps some day
you will realize that the love Count Poltavo offered you was the
greatest compliment that has ever been paid to you, for you have
inspired the one passion of my life which is without baseness and
without ulterior motives."</p>

<p>He said this in a tremulous voice, and possibly he believed
it. He had said as much before to women whom he had long since
forgotten, but who carried the memory of his wicked face to their
graves.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, briskly, "we must wait for Mr. Doughton's
answer."</p>

<p>"He has already answered," she said; "he telephoned me."</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"How typically English, almost American, in his hustle; and
when is the happy event to take place?" he bantered.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, don't, don't,"&mdash;she raised her hands and
covered her face,&mdash;"I hardly know that, even now, I have the
strength to carry out my uncle's wishes."</p>

<p>"But when?" he asked, more soberly.</p>

<p>"In three days. Frank is getting a special licence; we
are&mdash;" She hesitated, and he waited.</p>

<p>"We are going to Paris," she said, with a pink flush in her
face, "but Frank wishes that we shall live "&mdash;she stopped
again, and then went on almost defiantly&mdash;"that we shall
live apart, although we shall not be able to preserve that fact a
secret."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said; "therein Mr. Doughton shows an innate
delicacy, which I greatly appreciate."</p>

<p>Again that little sense of resentment swept through her; the
patronage in his tone, the indefinable suggestion of possession
was, she thought, uncalled for. That he should approve of Frank
in that possessive manner was not far removed from an
impertinence.</p>

<p>"Have you thought?" he asked, after a while, "what would
happen if you did not marry Frank Doughton in accordance with
your uncle's wishes&mdash;what terrible calamity would fall upon
your uncle?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I do not know," she said, frankly. "I am only beginning to
get a dim idea of Mr. Farrington's real character. I always
thought he was a kindly and considerate man; now I know him to
be&mdash;" She stopped, and Poltavo supplied her deficiency of
speech.</p>

<p>"You know him to be a criminal," he smiled, "a man who has for
years been playing upon the fears and the credulity of his
fellow-creatures. That must have been a shocking discovery, Miss
Gray, but at least you will acquit him of having stolen your
fortune."</p>

<p>"It is all very terrible," she said; "somehow every day brings
it to me. My aunt, Lady Dinsmore, was right."</p>

<p>"Lady Dinsmore is always right," he said, lightly; "it is one
of the privileges of her age and position. But in what respect
was she right?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"I do not think it is loyal of me to tell you, but I must. She
always thought Mr. Farrington was engaged in some shady business
and has warned me time after time."</p>

<p>"An admirable woman," said Poltavo, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"In three days," he went on, thoughtfully. "Well, much may
happen in three days. I must confess that I am anxious to know
what would be the result of this marriage not taking place."</p>

<p>He did not wait for an expression of her views, but with a
curt little bow he ushered himself out of the room.</p>

<p>"Three days," he found himself repeating, as he made his way
back to his house. "Why should Farrington be in such a frantic
hurry to marry the girl off, and why should he have chosen this
penniless reporter?"</p>

<p>This was a matter which required a great deal of
examination.</p>

<p>Two of those three days were dream days for Frank Doughton; he
could not believe it possible that such a fortune could be his.
But with his joy there ran the knowledge that he was marrying a
woman who had no desire for such a union.</p>

<p>But she would learn to love him; so he promised himself in his
optimism and the assurance of his own love. He had unbounded
faith in himself, and was working hard in these days, not only
upon his stories, but upon the clue which the discovery of the
belated letter afforded him. He had carefully gone through the
parish list to discover the Annies of the past fifty years. In
this he was somewhat handicapped by the fact that there must have
been hundreds of Annies who enjoyed no separate existence,
married women who had no property qualification to appear on
ratepayers' lists; anonymous Annies, who perhaps employed that as
a pet name, instead of the name with which they had been
christened.</p>

<p>He had one or two clues and was following these industriously.
For the moment, however, he must drop this work and concentrate
his mind upon the tremendous and remarkable business which his
coming marriage involved. He had a series of articles to write
for the Monitor, and he applied himself feverishly to this
work.</p>

<p>It was two nights before his marriage that he carried the last
of his work to the great newspaper office on the Thames
Embankment, and delivered his manuscript in person to the
editor.</p>

<p>That smiling man offered his congratulations to the
embarrassed youth.</p>

<p>"I suppose we shall not be looking for any articles from you
for quite a long time," he said, at parting.</p>

<p>"I hope so," said the other. "I do not see why I should starve
because I am married. My wife will be a very rich woman," he said
quietly, "but so far as I am concerned that will make no
difference; I do not intend taking one penny of her fortune."</p>

<p>The journalist clapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Good lad," he said, approvingly; "the man who lives on his
wife's income is a man who has ceased to live."</p>

<p>"That sounds like an epigram," smiled Frank.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch as he descended the stairs. It was nine
o'clock and he had not dined; he would go up to an eating house
in Soho and have his frugal meal before he retired for the night.
He had had a heavy day, and a heavier day threatened on the
morrow. Outside the newspaper office was a handsome new car, its
lacquer work shining in the electric light Frank was passing when
the chauffeur called him.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," he said, touching his cap, "are you Mr.
Frank Doughton?"</p>

<p>"That is my name," said Frank, in surprise, for he did not
recognize the man.</p>

<p>"I have been asked to call and pick you up, sir."</p>

<p>"Pick me up?" asked the astonished Frank&mdash;"by whom?"</p>

<p>"By Sir George Frederick," said the man, respectfully.</p>

<p>Frank knew the name of the member of Parliament and puzzled
his brain as to whether he had ever met him.</p>

<p>"But what does Sir George want with me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He wanted five minutes' conversation with you, sir," said the
man.</p>

<p>It would have been churlish to have refused the member's
request; besides, the errand would take him partly on his way. He
opened the door of the landaulet and stepped in, and as the door
swung to behind him, he found he was not alone in the car.</p>

<p>"What is the&mdash;" he began, when a powerful hand gripped
his throat, and he was swung backward on the padded seat as the
car moved slowly forward and, gathering speed as it went, flew
along the Thames Embankment with its prisoner.</p>

<h2><a id="chap15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">IN the rectory at Great Bradley, Lady Constance
Dex arose from a sleepless night to confront her placid brother
at the breakfast table. The Reverend Jeremiah Bangley, a stout
and easy man, who spent as much of his time in London as in his
rectory, was frankly nonplussed by the apparition. He was one of
those men, common enough, who accept the most extraordinary
happenings as being part of life's normal round. An earthquake in
Little Bradley which swallowed up his church and the major
portion of his congregation would not have interested him any
more than the budding of the trees, or a sudden arrival of flower
life in his big walled garden. Now, however, he was obviously
astonished.</p>

<p>"What brings you to breakfast, Constance?" he asked. "I have
not seen you at this table for many years."</p>

<p>"I could not sleep," she said, as she helped herself at the
sideboard to a crisp morsel of bacon. "I think I will take my
writing pad to Moor Cottage."</p>

<p>He pursed his lips, this easy going rector of Little
Bradley.</p>

<p>"I have always thought," he said, "that Moor Cottage was not
the most desirable gift the late Mr. Farrington could have made
to you." He paused, to allow her a rejoinder, but as she made no
reply, he went on: "It is isolated, standing on the edge of the
moor, away from the ordinary track of people. I am always scared,
my dear Constance, that one of these days you will have some
wretched tramp, or a person of the criminal classes, causing you
a great deal of distress and no little inconvenience."</p>

<p>There was much of truth in what he said. Moor Cottage, a
pretty little one-storied dwelling, had been built by the owner
of the Secret House at the same time that the house itself had
been erected. It was intended, so the builder said, to serve the
purpose of a summer house, and certainly it offered seclusion,
for it was placed on the edge of the moor, approached by a
by-road which was scarcely ever traversed, since Bradley mines
had been worked out and abandoned.</p>

<p>Many years ago when the earth beneath the moor had been
tunnelled left and right by the seekers after tin and lead, Moor
Cottage might have stood in the centre of a hive of industry. The
ramshackle remains of the miners' cottage were to be seen on the
other side of the hill; the broken and deserted headgear of the
pit, and the discoloured chimney of the old power house were
still visible a quarter of a mile from the cottage.</p>

<p>It suited the owner of the Secret House, however, to have this
little cottage erected, though it was nearly two miles from the
Secret House, and he had spared neither expense nor trouble in
preparing a handsome interior.</p>

<p>Lady Constance Dex had been the recipient of many gifts from
Mr. Farrington and his friends. There had been a period when
Farrington could not do enough for her, and had showered upon her
every mark of his esteem, and Moor Cottage had perhaps been the
most magnificent of these presents. Here she could find
seclusion, and in the pretty oak-paneled rooms reconstruct those
happy days which Great Bradley had at one time offered to
her.</p>

<p>"It is a little lonely," she smiled at her brother.</p>

<p>She had a good-natured contempt for his opinion. He was a
large, lethargic man, who had commonplace views on all
subjects.</p>

<p>"But really you know, Jerry, I am quite a capable person, and
Brown will be near by, in case of necessity."</p>

<p>He nodded, and addressed himself again to the Times, the
perusal of which she had interrupted.</p>

<p>"I have nothing more to say," he said from behind his
newspaper. By and by he put it down.</p>

<p>"Who is this Mr. Smith?" he asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith?" she said, with interest. "Which Mr. Smith are you
referring to?"</p>

<p>"I think he is a detective person," said the Reverend Jeremiah
Bangley; "he has honoured us with a great number of visits
lately."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I mean Great Bradley," he explained. "Do you think there is
anything wrong at the Secret House?"</p>

<p>"What could there be wrong," she asked, "that has not been
wrong for the last ten or twenty years?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his massive shoulders.</p>

<p>"I have never quite approved of the Secret House," he said,
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>She finished her hurried breakfast and rose.</p>

<p>"You have never approved of anything, Jerry," she said,
tapping him on the shoulder as she passed.</p>

<p>She looked through the window; the victoria she had ordered
was waiting at the door, with the imperturbable Brown sitting on
the box.</p>

<p>"I shall be back to lunch," she said.</p>

<p>Looking through a window he saw her mount into the carriage
carrying a portfolio. In that letter case, although he did not
know it, were the letters and diaries which Dr. Goldworthy had
brought from the Congo. In the seclusion of Moor Cottage she
found the atmosphere to understand the words, written now in fire
upon her very soul, and to plan her future.</p>

<p>There was no servant at Moor Cottage. She was in the habit of
sending one of her own domestic staff after her visit to make it
tidy for her future reception.</p>

<p>She let herself in through the little door placed under the
green-covered porch.</p>

<p>"You can unharness the horse; I shall be here two hours," she
said to the waiting Brown.</p>

<p>The man touched his hat. He was used to these excursions and
was possessed of the patience of his class. He backed the
victoria on to the moor by the side of the fence which surrounded
the house. There was a little stable at the back, but it was
never used. He unharnessed the horse, fixed his nosebag, and sat
down to read his favourite newspaper; a little journal which
dealt familiarly with the erratic conduct of the upper classes.
He was not a quick reader, and there was sufficient in the
gossipy journal to occupy his attention for three or four hours.
At the end of an hour he thought he heard his lady's voice
calling him, and jumping up, he walked to the door of the
cottage.</p>

<p>He listened, but there was no other sound, and he came back to
his previous position, and continued his study of the decadent
aristocracy. Four hours he waited, and assailed by a most human
hunger, his patience was pardonably exhausted.</p>

<p>He rose slowly, harnessed the horse, and drove the victoria
ostentatiously before the window of the little sitting-room which
Lady Constance Dex used as a study. Another half an hour passed
without any response, and he got down from his box and knocked at
the door.</p>

<p>There was no answer; he knocked again; still no reply.</p>

<p>In alarm he went to the window and peered in. The floor was
strewn with papers scattered in confusion. A chair had been
overturned. More to the point, he saw an overturned inkpot, which
was eloquent to his ordered mind of an unusual happening.</p>

<p>Increasingly alarmed, he put his shoulder to the door, but it
did not yield. He tried the window; it was locked.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that a motor came swiftly-over the hill
from the direction of the rectory. With a jar it came to a sudden
stop before the house, and T.B. Smith leapt out.</p>

<p>Brown had seen the detective before on his visits to the
rectory, and now hailed him as veritably god-sent.</p>

<p>"Where is Lady Constance?" asked T.B., quickly.</p>

<p>The man pointed to the house with trembling finger.</p>

<p>"She's in there somewhere," he said, fretfully, "but I can't
make her answer... and the room appears to be very
disordered."</p>

<p>He led the way to the window. T.B. looked in and saw that
which confirmed his worst fears.</p>

<p>"Stand back," he said.</p>

<p>He raised his ebony stick and sent it smashing through the
glass. In a second his hand was inside unlocking the latch of the
window; a few seconds later he was in the room itself. He passed
swiftly from room to room, but there was no sign of Lady
Constance. On the floor of the study was a piece of lace collar,
evidently wrenched from her gown.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Ela, who had followed him. He pointed to the
table. On a sheet of paper was the print of a bloody palm.</p>

<p>"Farrington," said T.B., briefly, "he has been here; but how
did he get out?"</p>

<p>He questioned the coachman closely, but the man was
emphatic.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said, "it would have been impossible for anybody
to have passed out of here without my seeing them. Not only could
I see the cottage from where I sat, but the whole of the
hillside."</p>

<p>"Is there any other place where she could be?"</p>

<p>"There is the outhouse," said Brown, after a moment's thought;
"we used to put up the victoria there, but we never use it
nowadays in fine weather."</p>

<p>The outhouse consisted of a large coachhouse and a small
stable. There was no lock to the doors, T.B. noticed, and he
pulled them open wide. There was a heap of straw in one corner,
kept evidently as a provision against the need of the visiting
coachman. T.B. stepped into the outhouse, then suddenly with a
cry he leant down, and caught a figure by the collar and swung
him to his feet.</p>

<p>"Will you kindly explain what you are doing here?" he asked,
and then gave a gasp of astonishment, for the sleepy-eyed
prisoner in his hands was Frank Doughton.</p>

<p>"It is a curious story you tell me," said T.B.</p>

<p>"I admit it is curious," said Frank, with a smile, "and I am
so sleepy that I do not know how much I have told you, and how
much I have imagined."</p>

<p>"You told me," recapitulated T.B., "that you were kidnapped
last night in London, that you were carried through London and
into the country in an unknown direction, and that you made your
escape from the motor-car by springing out in the early hours of
this morning, whilst the car was going at a slackened speed."</p>

<p>"That is it," said the other. "I have not the slightest idea
where I am; perhaps you can tell me?"</p>

<p>"You are near Great Bradley," said T.B., with a smile. "I
wonder you do not recognize your home; for home it is, as I
understand."</p>

<p>Frank looked round with astonished eyes.</p>

<p>"What were they bringing me here for?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"That remains to be discovered," replied T.B.; "my own
impression is that you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think I was being taken to the Secret House?"
interrupted the young man, suddenly.</p>

<p>T.B. shook his head.</p>

<p>"I should think that was unlikely. I suspect our friend
Poltavo of having carried out this little coup entirely on his
own. I further suspect his having brought the car in this
direction with no other object than to throw suspicion upon our
worthy friends across the hill&mdash;and how did you come to the
outhouse?"</p>

<p>"I was dead beat," explained Frank. "I had a sudden spasm of
strength which enabled me to out-distance those people who were
pursuing me, but after I had shaken them off I felt that I could
drop. I came upon this cottage, which seemed the only habitation
in view, and after endeavouring to waken the occupants I did the
next best thing, I made my way into the coachhouse and fell
asleep."</p>

<p>T.B. had no misgivings so far as this story was concerned; he
accepted it as adding only another obstacle to the difficulties
of his already difficult task.</p>

<p>"You heard no sound whilst you lay there?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," said the young man.</p>

<p>"No sound of a struggle, I mean," said T.B., and then it was
that he explained to Frank Doughton the extraordinary
disappearance of the owner of Moor Cottage.</p>

<p>"She must be in the house," said Frank.</p>

<p>They went back and resumed their search. Upstairs was a
bedroom, and adjoining a bath-room. On the ground floor were two
rooms: the study he had quitted and a smaller room beautifully
decorated and containing a piano. But the search was fruitless;
Lady Constance Dex had disappeared as though the earth had opened
and swallowed her up. There was no sign of a trap in the whole of
the little building, and T.B. was baffled.</p>

<p>"It is a scientific axiom," he said, addressing Ela with a
thoughtful glint in his eye, "that matter must occupy space,
therefore Lady Constance Dex must be in existence, she cannot
have evaporated into thin air, and I am not going to leave this
place until I find her."</p>

<p>Ela was thinking deeply, and frowning at the untidiness of the
table.</p>

<p>"Do you remember that locket which you found on one of the
dead men in Brakely Square?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>T.B. nodded. He put his hand in his waistcoat pocket, for he
had carried that locket ever since the night of its
discovery.</p>

<p>"Let us have a look at the inscription again," said Ela.</p>

<p>They drew up chairs to the table and examined the little
circular label which they had found in the battered interior.</p>

<p>"Mor: Cot<br> God sav the Keng."</p>

<p>Ela shook his head helplessly.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly sure there is a solution here," he said. "Do
you see those words on the top? 'Mor: Cot:'&mdash;that stands for
Moor Cottage."</p>

<p>"By Jove, so it does," said T.B., picking up the locket; "that
never struck me before. It was the secret of Moor Cottage which
this man discovered, and with which he was trying to blackmail
our friend. So far as the patriotic postscript is concerned that
is beyond my understanding."</p>

<p>"There is a meaning to it," said Ela, "and it is not a
cryptogram either. You see how he has forgotten to put the 'e' in
'save'? And he has spelt 'king' 'keng.'"</p>

<p>They waited before the house whilst Brown drove to the
rectory, and then on to the town. Jeremiah Bangley arrived in a
state of calm anticipation. That his sister had disappeared did
not seem to strike him as a matter for surprise, though he
permitted himself to say that it was a very remarkable
occurrence.</p>

<p>"I have always warned Constance not to be here alone, and I
should never have forgiven myself if Brown had not been on the
spot," he said.</p>

<p>"Can you offer any explanation?"</p>

<p>The rector shook his head. He was totally ignorant of the
arrangements of the house, had never, so he said, put foot in it
in his life. This was perfectly true, for he was an incurious man
who did not greatly bother himself about the affairs of other
people. The local police arrived in half an hour, headed by the
chief inspector, who happened to be in the station when the
report was brought in.</p>

<p>"I suppose I had better take this young man to the station?"
he said, indicating Frank.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked T.B. calmly; "what do you gain by arresting him?
As a matter of fact there is no evidence whatever which would
implicate Mr. Doughton, and I am quite prepared to give you my
own guarantee to produce him whenever you may require him.</p>

<p>"The best thing you can do is to get back to town," he said
kindly to that young man; "you need a little sleep. It is not a
pleasant prelude to your marriage. By the way, that is to-morrow,
is it not?" he asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"I wonder if that has anything to do with your kidnapping,"
said T.B. thoughtfully. "Is there any person who is anxious that
this marriage should not come about?"</p>

<p>Frank hesitated.</p>

<p>"I hardly like to accuse a man," he said, "but
Poltavo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poltavo?" repeated T.B. quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Frank; "he has some views on the question of Miss
Gray."</p>

<p>He spoke reluctantly, for he was loath to introduce Doris'
name into the argument.</p>

<p>"Poltavo would have a good reason," mused T.B. Smith. "Tell me
what happened in the car."</p>

<p>Briefly Frank related the circumstances which had led up to
his capture.</p>

<p>"When I found myself in their hands," he said, "I decided to
play 'possum for a while. The car was moving at incredible speed,
remembering your stringent traffic regulations,"&mdash;he
smiled,&mdash;"and I knew that any attempt to escape on my part
would result in serious injury to myself. They made no bones
about their intentions. Before we were clear of London they had
pulled the blinds, and one of them had switched on the electric
lamp. They were both masked, and were, I think, foreigners. One
sat opposite to me, all through the night, a revolver on his
knees, and he did not make any disguise of his intention of
employing his weapon if I gave the slightest trouble.</p>

<p>"I could not tell, because of the lowered blinds, which
direction we were taking, but presently we struck the country and
they let down one of the windows without raising the blind and I
could smell the sweet scent of the fields, and knew we were miles
away from London.</p>

<p>"I think I must have dozed a little, for very suddenly, it
seemed, daylight came, and I had the good sense in waking to make
as little stir as possible. I found the man sitting opposite was
also in a mild doze, and the other at my side was nodding.</p>

<p>"I took a very careful survey of the situation. The car was
moving very slowly, and evidently the driver had orders to move
at no particular pace through the night, in order to economize
the petrol. There was an inside handle to each of the doors, and
I had to make up my mind by which I was to make my escape. I
decided upon the near side. Gathering up my energies for one
supreme effort, I suddenly leapt up, flung open the door, and
jumped out. I had enough experience of the London traffic to
clear the car without stumbling.</p>

<p>"I found myself upon a heath, innocent of any cover, save for
a belt of trees about half a mile ahead of me as I ran.
Fortunately the down, which was apparently flat, was, in fact, of
a rolling character, and in two minutes I must have been out of
sight of the car&mdash;long before they had brought the driver,
himself half asleep probably, to an understanding that I had made
my escape. They caught sight of me as I came up from the hollow,
and one of them must have fired at me, for I heard the whistle of
a bullet pass my head. That is all the story I have to tell. It
was rather a tame conclusion to what promised to be a most
sensational adventure."</p>

<p>At the invitation of the Reverend Jeremiah he drove back to
the rectory, and left T.B. to continue his search for the missing
Lady Constance. No better result attended the second scrutiny of
the rooms than had resulted from the first.</p>

<p>"The only suggestion I can make now," said T.B., helplessly,
"is that whilst our friend the coachman was reading, his lady
slipped out without attracting his attention and strolled away;
she will in all probability be awaiting us at the rectory."</p>

<p>Yet in his heart he knew that this view was absolutely wrong.
The locked doors, the evidence of a struggle in the room, the
bloody hand print, all pointed conclusively to foul play.</p>

<p>"At any rate Lady Constance Dex is somewhere within the radius
of four miles," he said, grimly, "and I will find her if I have
to pull down the Secret House stone by stone."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">THE morning of Doris Gray's wedding dawned fair
and bright, and she sat by the window which overlooked the
gardens in Brakely Square, her hands clasped across her knees,
her mind in a very tangle of confusion. It was happy for her (she
argued) that there were so many considerations attached to this
wedding that she had not an opportunity of thinking out,
logically and to its proper end, the consequence of this act of
hers.</p>

<p>She had had a wire from Frank on the night previous, and to
her surprise it had been dated from Great Bradley. For some
reason which she could not define she was annoyed that he could
leave London, and be so absorbed in his work on the eve of his
wedding. She gathered that his presence in that town had to do
with his investigations in the Tollington case. She thought that
at least he might have spent one day near her in case she wished
to consult him. He took much for granted, she thought petulantly.
Poltavo, on the contrary, had been most assiduous in his
attention. He had had tea with her the previous afternoon, and
with singular delicacy had avoided any reference to the
forthcoming marriage or to his own views on the subject. But all
that he did not speak, he looked. He conveyed the misery in which
he stood with subtle suggestion. She felt sorry for him, had no
doubt of the genuineness of his affection, or his
disinterestedness. A profitable day for Poltavo in ordinary
circumstances.</p>

<p>A maid brought her from her reverie to the practical realities
of life.</p>

<p>"Mr. Debenham has called, miss," said the girl. "I have shown
him into the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Mr. Debenham?" repeated Doris, with a puzzled frown. "Oh,
yes, the lawyer; I will come down to him."</p>

<p>She found the staid solicitor walking up and down the
drawing-room abstractedly.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know that I shall be a necessary guest at your
wedding," he said, as he shook hands. "I have to deliver to you
the keys of your uncle's safe at the London Safe Deposit. I have
a memorandum here of the exact amount of money which should be in
that safe."</p>

<p>He laid the paper on the table.</p>

<p>"You can look at the items at your leisure, but roughly it
amounts to eight hundred thousand pounds, which was left you by
your late father, who, I understand, died when you were a
child."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"That sum is in gilt-edged securities, and you will probably
find that a number of dividends are due to you. The late Mr.
Farrington, when he made his arrangements for your future, chose
this somewhat unusual and bizarre method of protecting your
money, much against my will. I might tell you," he went on, "that
he consulted me about six years ago on the subject, and I
strongly advised him against it. As it happened, I was wrong, for
immediately afterwards, as his books show, he must have suffered
enormous losses, and although I make no suggestion against his
character,"&mdash;he raised his hand deprecatingly,&mdash;"yet I
do say that the situation which was created by the slump in
Canadian Pacifics of which he was a large holder, might very
easily have tempted a man not so strong-willed as Mr. Farrington.
At the present moment," he went on, "I have no more to do than
discharge my duty, and I have called beforehand to see you and to
ask whether your uncle spoke of the great Tollington fortune of
which he was one of the trustees, though as I believe&mdash;as I
know, in fact&mdash;he never handled the money."</p>

<p>She looked surprised.</p>

<p>"It is curious that you should ask that," she said. "Mr.
Doughton is engaged in searching for the heir to that
fortune."</p>

<p>Debenham nodded.</p>

<p>"So I understand," he said. "I ask because I received a
communication from the other trustees in America, and I am afraid
your future husband's search will be unavailing unless he can
produce the heir within the next forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>"Why is that?" she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"The terms of the will are peculiar," said Mr. Debenham,
walking up and down as he spoke. "The Tollington fortune, as you
may know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it," she interrupted.</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you." He smiled. "The fortune descends to
the heir and to his wife in equal proportions."</p>

<p>"Suppose he is not blessed with a wife?" She smiled with
something like her old gaiety.</p>

<p>"In that case the money automatically goes to the woman the
heir eventually marries. But the terms of the will are that the
heir shall be discovered within twenty years of the date of
Tollington's death. The time of grace expires to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Poor Frank," she said, shaking her head, "and he is working
so hard with his clues. I suppose if he does not produce that
mysterious individual by to-morrow there will be no reward for
him?"</p>

<p>The lawyer shook his head.</p>

<p>"I should hardly think it likely," he said, "because the
reward is for the man who complies with the conditions of the
will within a stipulated time, It was because I knew Mr. Doughton
had some interest in it, and because also"&mdash;he
hesitated&mdash;"I thought that your uncle might have taken you
into his confidence."</p>

<p>"That he might have told me who this missing person was, and
that he himself knew; and for some reason suppressed the fact?"
she asked, quickly. "Is that what you suggest, Mr. Debenham?"</p>

<p>"Please do not be angry with me," said the lawyer, quickly; "I
do not wish to say anything against Mr. Farrington; but I know he
was a very shrewd and calculating man, and I thought possibly
that he might have taken you that much into his confidence, and
that you might be able to help your future husband a part of the
way to a very large sum of money."</p>

<p>She shook her head again.</p>

<p>"I have absolutely no knowledge of the subject My uncle never
took me into his confidence," she said; "he was very
uncommunicative where business was concerned&mdash;although I am
sure he was fond of me." Her eyes filled with tears, not at the
recollection of his kindness, but at the humiliation she
experienced at playing a part in which she had no heart. It made
her feel inexpressibly mean and small.</p>

<p>"That is all," said Mr. Debenham. "I shall see you at the
registrar's office."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"May I express the hope," he said, in his heavy manner, "that
your life will be a very happy one, and that your marriage will
prove all you hope it will be?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know what I hope it will be," she said wearily, as
she accompanied him to the door.</p>

<p>That good man shook his head sadly as he made his way back to
his office.</p>

<p>Was there ever so unromantic and prosaic affair as this
marriage, thought Doris, as she stepped into the taxicab which
was to convey her to the registrar's office? She had had her
dreams, as other girls had had, of that wonderful day when with
pealing of the organ she would walk up the aisle perhaps upon the
arm of Gregory Farrington, to a marriage which would bring
nothing but delight and happiness. And here was the end of her
dreams, a great heiress and a beautiful girl rocking across
London in a hired cab to a furtive marriage.</p>

<p>Frank was waiting for her on the pavement outside the grimy
little office. Mr. Debenham was there, and a clerk he had brought
with him as witness. The ceremony was brief and uninteresting;
she became Mrs. Doughton before she quite realized what was
happening.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing to do now," said the lawyer as they
stood outside again on the sunlit pavement.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"We had best go straight away to the London Safe Deposit, and,
if you will give me the authority, I will take formal possession
of your fortune and place it in the hands of my bankers. I think
these things had better be done regularly."</p>

<p>The girl acquiesced.</p>

<p>Frank was singularly silent during the drive; save to make
some comment upon the amount of traffic in the streets, he did
not speak to her and she was grateful for his forbearance. Her
mind was in a turmoil; she was married&mdash;that was all she
knew&mdash;married to somebody she liked but did not love.
Married to a man who had been chosen for her partly against her
will. She glanced at him out of the corners of her eyes; if she
was joyless, no less was he. It was an inauspicious beginning to
a married life which would end who knew how? Before the
depressing granite facade of the London Safe Deposit the party
descended, Mr. Debenham paid the cabman, and they went down the
stone steps into the vaults of the repository.</p>

<p>There was a brief check whilst Mr. Debenham explained his
authority for the visit, and it was when the officials were
making reference to their books that the party was augmented by
the arrival of Poltavo.</p>

<p>He bowed over the girl's hand, holding it a little longer than
Frank could have liked, murmured colourless congratulations and
nodded to Debenham.</p>

<p>"Count Poltavo is here, I may say," explained the lawyer, "by
your late uncle's wishes. They were contained in a letter he
wrote to me a few days before he disappeared."</p>

<p>Frank nodded grudgingly; still he was generous enough to
realize something of this man's feelings if he loved Doris, and
he made an especial effort to be gracious to the new-comer.</p>

<p>A uniformed attendant led them through innumerable corridors
till they came to a private vault guarded by stout bars. The
attendant opened these and they walked into a little stone
chamber, illuminated by overhead lights.</p>

<p>The only article of furniture in the room was a small safe
which stood in one corner. A very small safe indeed, thought
Frank, to contain so large a fortune. The lawyer turned the key
in the lock methodically, and the steel door swung back. The back
of Mr. Debenham obscured their view of the safe's interior. Then
he turned with an expression of wonder.</p>

<p>"There is nothing here," he said.</p>

<p>"Nothing!" gasped Doris.</p>

<p>"Save this," said the lawyer.</p>

<p>He took a small envelope and handed it to the girl. She opened
it mechanically and read:</p>

<p>"I have, unfortunately, found it necessary to utilize your
fortune for the furtherance of my plans. You must try and forgive
me for this; but I have given you a greater one than you have
lost, a husband."</p>

<p>She looked up.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" she whispered.</p>

<p>Frank took the letter from her hand and concluded the
reading.</p>

<p><i>"A husband in Frank Doughton..."</i></p>

<p>The words swam before his eyes.</p>

<p>"And Frank Doughton is the heir to the Tollington millions, as
his father was before him. All the necessary proofs to establish
his identity will be discovered in the sealed envelope which the
lawyer holds, and which is inscribed 'C.'"</p>

<p>The letter was signed <i>"Gregory Farrington."</i></p>

<p>The lawyer was the first to recover his self-possession; his
practical mind went straight to the business at hand.</p>

<p>"There is such an envelope in my office," he said, "given to
me by Mr. Farrington with strict instructions that it was not to
be handed to his executors or to any person until definite
instructions arrived&mdash;instructions which would be
accompanied by unmistakable proof as to the necessity for its
being handed over. I congratulate you, Mr. Dough-ton."</p>

<p>He turned and shook hands with the bewildered Frank, who had
been listening like a man in a dream; the heir to the Tollington
millions; he, the son of George Doughton, and all the time he had
been looking for&mdash;what? For his own grandmother!</p>

<p>It came on him all of a rush. He knew now that all his
efforts, all his search might have been saved, if he had only
realized the Christian name of his father's mother.</p>

<p>He had only the dimmest recollection of the placid-faced lady
who had died whilst he was at school; he had never associated in
his mind this serene old lady, who had passed away only a few
hours before her beloved husband, with the Annie for whom he had
searched. It made him gasp&mdash;then he came to earth quickly as
he realized that his success had come with the knowledge of his
wife's financial ruin. He looked at her as she stood
there&mdash;it was too vast a shock for her to realize at
once.</p>

<p>He put his arm about her shoulder, and Poltavo, twirling his
little moustache, looked at the two through his lowered lids with
an ugly smile playing at the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>"It is all right, dear," said Frank soothingly; "your money is
secure&mdash;it was only a temporary use he made of it."</p>

<p>"It is not that," she said, with a catch in her throat; "it is
the feeling that my uncle trapped you into this marriage. I did
not mind his dissipating my own fortune; the money is nothing to
me. But he has caught you by a trick, and he has used me as a
bait." She covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>In a few moments she had composed herself; she spoke no other
word, but suffered herself to be led out of the building into the
waiting cab. Poltavo watched them drive off with that fierce
little smile of his, and turned to the lawyer.</p>

<p>"A clever man, Mr. Farrington," he said, in a bitter tone of
reluctant admiration.</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>"His Majesty's prisons are filled with men who specialize in
that kind of cleverness," he said, drily, and left Poltavo
without another word.</p>

<h2><a id="chap17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="first">T.B. SMITH was playing a round of golf at Walton
Heath, when the news was telephoned through to him.</p>

<p>He left immediately for town, and picked up Ela at luncheon at
the Fritz Hotel, where the detective had his headquarters.</p>

<p>"The whole thing is perfectly clear, now," he said. "The
inexplicable disappearance of Mr. Farrington is explained in
poster type, 'that he who runs may read.'"</p>

<p>"I am a little hazy about the solution myself,' said Ela
dubiously.</p>

<p>"Then I will put it in plain language for you," said T.B. as
he speared a sardine from the <i>hors d'oeuvre</i> dish.
"Farrington knew all along that the heir to the Tollington
millions was George Doughton. He knew it years and years ago, and
it was for that reason he settled at Great Bradley, where the
Doughtons had their home. Evidently the two older Doughtons were
dead at this time, and only George Doughton, the romantic and
altogether unpractical explorer, represented the family.</p>

<p>"George was in love with the lady who is now known as Lady
Constance Dex, and knowing this, Farrington evidently took every
step that was possible to ingratiate himself into her good
graces. He knew that the fortune would descend equally to
Doughton and to his wife. Doughton was a widower and had a son, a
youngster at the time, and it is very possible that, the boy
being at school, and being very rarely in Great Bradley,
Farrington had no idea of his existence.</p>

<p>"The knowledge that this boy was alive must have changed all
his plans; at any rate, the engagement was allowed to drift on,
whilst he matured some scheme whereby he could obtain a large
portion of the Tollington millions for his own use. Again I think
his plans must have been changed.</p>

<p>"It was whilst he was at Great Bradley that he was entrusted
with the guardianship of Doris Gray, and as his affection for the
young girl grew&mdash;an affection which I think was one of the
few wholesome things in his life&mdash;he must have seen the
extraordinary chance which fate had placed in his way.</p>

<p>"With diabolical ingenuity and with a remorselessness which is
reminiscent of the Borgias he planned first George Doughton's
death, and then the bringing together of Doughton's son and his
own ward. There is every proof of this to be found in his
subsequent actions. He was prepared to introduce the young people
to one another, and by affording them opportunities for meeting,
and such encouragement as he could give, to bring about the
result he so desired.</p>

<p>"But things did not move fast enough for him, and then he must
have learnt, as the other trustees seem to have learnt recently,
that there was an undiscovered time limit. He threw out hints to
his niece, hints which were received rather coldly. He had taken
the bold step of employing Frank Doughton to
discover&mdash;himself! That was a move which had a twofold
purpose. It kept the young man in contact with him. It also
satisfied the other trustees, who had entrusted to Farrington the
task of employing the necessary measures to discover the missing
heir.</p>

<p>"But neither hint nor suggestion served him. The girl's
fortune was due for delivery to her care, and his guardianship
expired almost at the same time as the time limit for discovery
of the Tollington millionaire came to an end. He had to take a
desperate step; there were other reasons, of course, contributing
to his move.</p>

<p>"The knowledge that he was suspected by me, the certainty that
Lady Constance Dex would betray him, once she discovered that he
had sent her lover to his death, all these were contributing
factors, but the main reason for his disappearance was the will
that was read after his bogus death.</p>

<p>"In that will he conveyed unchallengeable instructions for the
girl to marry Frank Doughton without delay. I suspect that the
girl now knows he is alive. Probably, panic-stricken by her
tardiness, he has disclosed his hand so far as the alleged death
is concerned."</p>

<p>T.B. looked out of the window on to the stream of life which
was flowing east and west along Piccadilly; his face was set in a
little frown of doubt and anxiety.</p>

<p>"I can take Farrington to-morrow if I want to," he said after
a moment, "but I wish to gather up every string of organization
in my hands."</p>

<p>"What of Lady Constance Dex?" asked Ela. "Whilst we are
waiting, she is in some little danger."</p>

<p>T.B. shook his head.</p>

<p>"If she is not dead now," he said simply, "she will be spared.
If Farrington wished to kill her&mdash;for Farrington it was who
spirited her away&mdash;he could have done so in the house; no
one would have been any the wiser as to the murderer. Lady
Constance must wait; we must trust to luck before I inspect that
underground chamber of which I imagine she is at present an
unwilling inmate. I want to crush this blackmailing force," he
said, thumping the table with energy; "I want to sweep out of
England the whole organization which is working right under the
nose of the police and in defiance of all laws; and until I have
done that, I shall not sleep soundly in my bed."</p>

<p>"And Poltavo?"</p>

<p>"Poltavo," smiled T.B., "can wait for just a little
while."</p>

<p>He paid the bill and the two men passed out of the hotel and
crossed Piccadilly. A man who had been lounging along apparently
studying the shop windows saw them out of the corner of his eye
and followed them carelessly. Another man, no less ostentatiously
reading a newspaper, as he walked along the pavement on the
opposite side of the thoroughfare, followed close behind.</p>

<p>T.B. and his companion turned into Burlington Arcade and
reached Cork Street. Save for one or two pedestrians the street
was utterly deserted, and the first of the shadowers quickened
his pace. He put his hand in his tail pocket and took out
something which glinted in the April sunlight, but before he
could raise his hand the fourth man, now on his heels, dropped
his newspaper, and flinging one arm around the shadower's neck,
and placing his knee in the small of the other's back, wrenched
the pistol away with his disengaged hand.</p>

<p>T.B. turned at the sound of the struggle and came back to
assist the shadowing detective. The prisoner was a little man,
sharp-featured, and obviously a member of one of the great Latin
branches of the human race. A tiny black moustache, fierce
scowling eyebrows, and liquid brown eyes now blazing with hate,
spoke of a Southern origin.</p>

<p>Deftly the three police officers searched and disarmed him; a
pair of adjustable handcuffs snapped upon the man's thin wrists,
and before the inevitable crowd could gather the prisoner and his
custodians were being whirled to Vine Street in a cab.</p>

<p>They placed the man in the steel dock and asked him the usual
questions, but he maintained a dogged silence. That his object
had been assassination no one could doubt, for in addition to the
automatic pistol, which he had obviously intended using at short
range, trusting to luck to make his escape, they found a long
stiletto in his breast pocket.</p>

<p>More to the point, and of greater interest to T.B., there was
a three-line scrawl on a piece of paper in Italian, which,
translated, showed that minute instructions had been given to the
would-be murderer as to T.B.'s whereabouts.</p>

<p>"Put him in a cell," said T.B. "I think we are going to find
things out. If this is not one of Poltavo's hired thugs, I am
greatly mistaken."</p>

<p>Whatever he was, the man offered no information which might
assist the detective in his search for the truth, but maintained
an unbroken silence, and T.B. gave up the task of questioning him
in sheer despair.</p>

<p>The next morning at daybreak the prisoner was aroused and told
to dress. He was taken out to where a motor car was awaiting him,
and a few moments later he was speeding on the way to Dover. Two
detective officers placed him on a steamer and accompanied him to
Calais. At Calais they took a courteous leave of him, handing him
a hundred francs and the information in his own tongue that he
had been deported on an order from the Home Secretary, obtained
at midnight the previous night.</p>

<p>The prisoner took his departure with some eagerness and spent
the greater portion of his hundred francs in addressing a
telegram to Poltavo.</p>

<p>T.B. Smith, who knew that telegram would come, was sitting in
the Continental instrument room of the General Post Office when
it arrived. He was handed a copy of the telegram and read it.
Then he smiled.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, as he passed it back to the
Superintendent of the department, "this may now be transmitted
for delivery. I know all I want to know."</p>

<p>Poltavo received the message an hour later, and having read
it, cursed his subordinate's indiscretion, for the message was in
Italian, plain for everybody to read who understood that
language, and its purport easy to understand for anybody who had
a knowledge of the facts.</p>

<p>He waited all that day for a visit from the police, and when
T.B. arrived in the evening Poltavo was ready with an excuse and
an explanation. But neither excuse nor explanation was asked for.
T.B.'s questions had to do with something quite different, namely
the new Mrs. Doughton and her vanished fortune.</p>

<p>"I was in the confidence of Mr. Farrington," said Poltavo,
relieved to find the visit had nothing to do with that which he
most dreaded, "but I was amazed to discover that the safe was
empty. It was a tremendous tragedy for the poor young lady. She
is in Paris now with her husband," he added.</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will give me their address?" he asked.</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said Count Poltavo, reaching for his address
book.</p>

<p>"I may be going to Paris myself to-morrow," T.B. went on, "and
I will look these young people up. I suppose it is not the
correct thing for any one to call upon honeymoon couples, but a
police officer has privileges."</p>

<p>There was an exchange of smiles. Poltavo was almost
exhilarated that T.B.'s visit had nothing to do with him
personally. A respect, which amounted almost to fear,
characterized his attitude toward the great Scotland Yard
detective. He credited T.B. with qualities which perhaps that
admirable man did not possess, but, as a setoff against this, he
failed to credit him with a wiliness which was peculiarly T.B.'s
chief asset. For who could imagine that the detective's chief
object in calling upon Poltavo that evening was to allay his
suspicions and soothe down his fears. Yet T.B. came for no other
reason and with no other purpose. It was absolutely necessary
that Poltavo should be taken off his guard, for T.B. was planning
the coup which was to end for all time the terror under which
hundreds of innocent people in England were lying.</p>

<p>After an exchange of commonplace civilities the two men
parted,&mdash;T.B., as he said, with his hand on the door, to
prepare for his Paris trip, and Poltavo to take up what promised
to be one of the most interesting cases that the Fallock
blackmailers had ever handled.</p>

<p>He waited until he heard the door close after the detective;
until he had watched him, from the window, step into his cab and
be whirled away, then he unlocked the lower drawer of his desk,
touched a spring in the false bottom, and took from a secret
recess a small bundle of letters.</p>

<p>Many of the sheets of notepaper which he spread out on the
table before him bore the strawberry crest of his grace the Duke
of Ambury. The letters were all in the same sprawling
handwriting; ill-spelt and blotted, but they were very much to
the point. The Duke of Ambury, in his exuberant youth, had
contracted a marriage with a lady in Gibraltar. His regiment had
been stationed at that fortress when his succession to the
dukedom had been a very remote possibility, and the Spanish lady
to whom, as the letters showed, he had plighted his troth, and to
whom he was eventually married in the name of Wilson (a copy of
the marriage certificate was in the drawer), had been a typical
Spaniard of singular beauty and fascination, though of no
distinguished birth.</p>

<p>Apparently his grace had regretted his hasty alliance, for two
years after his succession to the title, he had married the third
daughter of the Earl of Westchester without&mdash;so far as the
evidence in Poltavo's possession showed&mdash;having gone through
the formality of releasing himself from his previous union.</p>

<p>Here was a magnificent coup, the most splendid that had ever
come into the vision of the blackmailers, for the Duke of Ambury
was one of the richest men in England, a landlord who owned half
London and had estates in almost every county. If ever there was
a victim who was in a position to be handsomely bled, here was
one.</p>

<p>The Spanish wife was now dead, but an heir had been born to
the Duke of Ambury before the death, and the whole question of
succession was affected by the threatened disclosure. All the
facts of the case were in Poltavo's possession; they were written
in this curiously uneducated hand which filled the pages of the
letters now spread upon the table in front of him. The marriage
certificate had been supplied, and a copy of the death
certificate had also been obligingly extracted by a peccant
servant, and matters were now so far advanced that Poltavo had
received, through the Agony column of the Times, a reply to the
demand he had sent to his victim.</p>

<p>That reply had been very favourable; there had been no
suggestion of lawyers; no hint of any intervention on the part of
the police. Ambury was willing to be bled, willing indeed, so the
agony advertisement indicated to Poltavo, to make any financial
sacrifice in order to save the honour of his house.</p>

<p>It was only a question of terms now. Poltavo had decided upon
fifty thousand pounds. That sum would be sufficient to enable him
to clear out of England and to enjoy life as he best loved it,
without the necessity for taking any further risks. With Doris
Gray removed from his hands, with the approval of society already
palling upon him, he thirsted for new fields and new adventures.
The fifty thousand seemed now within his grasp. He should, by his
agreement with Farrington, hand two-thirds of that sum to his
employer, but even the possibility of his doing this never for
one moment occurred to him.</p>

<p>Farrington, so he told himself, a man in hiding, powerless and
in Poltavo's hands practically, could not strike back at him; the
cards were all in favour of the Count. He had already received
some ten thousand pounds as a result of his work in London, and
he had frantic and ominous letters from Dr. Fall demanding that
the "house" share should be forwarded without delay. These
demands Poltavo had treated with contempt. He felt master of the
situation, inasmuch that he had placed the major portion of the
balance of money in hand, other than that which had been actually
supplied by Farrington, to his own credit in a Paris bank. He was
prepared for all eventualities, and here he was promised the
choicest of all his pickings&mdash;for the bleeding of the Duke
of Ambury would set a seal upon previous accomplishments.</p>

<p>He rang a bell, and a man came, letting himself into the room
with a key. He was an Italian with a peculiarly repulsive face;
one of the small fry whom Poltavo had employed from time to time
to do such work as was beneath his own dignity, or which promised
an unnecessary measure of danger in its performance.</p>

<p>"Carlos," said Poltavo, speaking in Italian, "Antonio has been
arrested, and has been taken to Calais by the police."</p>

<p>"That I know, signor," nodded the man. "He is very fortunate.
I was afraid when the news came that he would be put into
prison."</p>

<p>Poltavo smiled.</p>

<p>"The ways of the English police are beyond understanding," he
said lightly. "Here was our Antonio, anxious and willing to kill
the head of the detective department, and they release him! Is it
not madness? At any rate, Antonio will not be coming back,
because though they are mad, the police are not so foolish as to
allow him to land again. I have telegraphed to our friend to go
on to Paris and await me, and here let me say, Carlos,"&mdash;he
tapped the table with the end of his penholder,&mdash;"that if
you by ill-fortune should ever find yourself in the same position
of our admirable and worthy Antonio, I beg that you will not send
me telegrams."</p>

<p>"You may be assured, excellent signor," said the man with a
little grin, "that I shall not send you telegrams, for I cannot
write."</p>

<p>"A splendid deficiency," said Poltavo.</p>

<p>He took up a letter from the table.</p>

<p>"You will deliver this to a person who will meet you at the
corner of Branson Square. The exact position I have already
indicated to you."</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>"This person will give you in exchange another letter. You
will not return to me but you will go to your brother's house in
Great Saffron Street, and outside that house you will see a man
standing who wears a long overcoat. You will brush past him, and
in doing so you will drop this envelope into his pocket&mdash;you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Excellency, I quite understand," said the man.</p>

<p>"Go, and God be with you," said the pious Poltavo, sending
forth a message which he believed would bring consternation and
terror into the bosom of the Duke of Ambury.</p>

<p>It was late that night when Carlos Freggetti came down a steep
declivity into Great Saffron Street and walked swiftly along that
deserted thoroughfare till he came to his brother's house. His
brother was a respectable Italian artisan, engaged by an asphalt
company in London. Near the narrow door of the tenement in which
his relative lived, a stranger stood, apparently awaiting some
one. Carlos, in passing him, stumbled and apologized under his
breath. At that moment he slipped the letter into the other's
pocket. His quick eyes noted the identity of the stranger. It was
Poltavo. No one else was in the street, and in the dim light even
the keenest of eyes would not have seen the transfer of the
envelope. Poltavo strolled to the end of the thoroughfare, jumped
into the taxi-cab which was waiting and reached his house after
various transferences of cabs without encountering any of T.B.'s
watchful agents. In his room he opened the letter with an anxious
air. Would Ambury agree to the exorbitant sum he had demanded?
And if he did not agree, what sum would he be prepared to pay as
the price of the blackmailer's silence? The first words brought
relief to him.</p>

<br>

<p class="first"><i>"I am willing to pay the sum you ask,
although I think you are guilty of a dastardly crime,"</i> read
the letter, <i>"and since you seem to suspect my bona-fides, I
shall chose, as an agent to carry the money to you, an old
labourer on my Lancashire estate who will be quite ignorant of
the business in hand, and who will give you the money in exchange
for the marriage certificate. If you will choose a rendezvous
where you can meet, a rendezvous which fulfills all your
requirements as to privacy, I will undertake to have my man on
the spot at the time you wish."</i></p>

<p><br>
There was a triumphant smile on Poltavo's face as he folded
the letter.</p>

<p>"Now," he said half aloud, "now, my friend Farrington, you and
I will part company. You have ceased to be of any service to me;
your value has decreased in the same proportion as my desire for
freedom has advanced. Fifty thousand pounds!" he repeated
admiringly. "Ernesto, you have a happy time before you. All the
continent of Europe is at your feet, and this sad England is
behind you. Congratulations, amigo!"</p>

<p>The question of the rendezvous was an important one. Though he
read into the letter an eagerness on the part of his victim to do
anything to avoid the scandal and the exposure which Poltavo
threatened, yet he did not trust him. The old farm labourer was a
good idea, but where could they meet? When Poltavo had kidnapped
Frank Doughton he had intended taking him to a little house he
had hired in the East End of London. The journey to the Secret
House was a mere blind to throw suspicion upon Farrington and to
put the police off the real track. The car would have returned to
London, and under the influence of a drug he had intended to
smuggle Frank into the small house at West Ham, where he was to
be detained until the period which Farrington had stipulated had
expired.</p>

<p>But the transfer of money in the house was a different matter.
The place could be surrounded by police. No, it must be an open
space; such a space as would enable Poltavo to command a clear
view on every side.</p>

<p>Why not Great Bradley, he thought, after a while? Again he
would be serving two purposes. He would be leading the police to
the Secret House, and he would have the mansion of mystery and
all its resources as a refuge in case anything went wrong at the
last moment He could, in the worst extremity, explain that he was
collecting the money on behalf of Farrington.</p>

<p>Yes, Great Bradley and the wild stretch of down on the south
of the town was the place. He made his arrangements
accordingly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">IT was three days after the exchange of letters
that Count Poltavo, in the rough tweeds of a country
gentleman&mdash;a garb which hardly suited his figure or
presence&mdash;strolled carelessly across the downs, making his
way to their highest point, a great rolling slope, from the crest
of which a man could see half a dozen miles in every
direction.</p>

<p>The sky was overcast and a chill wind blew; it was such a day
upon which he might be certain no pleasure-seekers would be
abroad. To his left, half hidden in the furthermost shelter of
the downs, veiled as it was for ever under a haze of blue grey
smoke, lay Great Bradley, with its chimneys and its busy
industrial life. To his right he caught a glimpse of the square
ugly facade of the Secret House, half hidden by the encircling
trees. To its right was a chimney stack from which a lazy feather
of smoke was drifting. Behind him the old engine house of the
deserted mines, and to the right of that the pretty little
cottage from which a week before Lady Constance Dex had so
mysteriously disappeared, and which in consequence had been an
object of pilgrimage for the whole countryside.</p>

<p>But Lady Constance Dex's disappearance had become a nine days'
wonder. There were many explanations offered for her unexpected
absence. The police of the country were hunting systematically
and leisurely, and only T.B. and those in his immediate
confidence were satisfied that the missing woman was less than
two miles away from the scene of her disappearance.</p>

<p>Count Poltavo had armed himself with a pair of field-glasses,
and now he carefully scrutinized all the roads which led to the
downs. A motor-car, absurdly diminutive from the distance, came
spinning along the winding white road two miles away. He watched
it as it mounted the one hill and descended the other, and kept
his glasses on it until it vanished in a cloud of dust on the
London road. Then he saw what he sought. Coming across the downs
a mile away was the bent figure of a man who stopped now and
again to look about, as though uncertain as to the direction he
should take. Poltavo, lying flat upon the ground, his glasses
fixed upon the man, waited, watching the slow progress with lazy
interest.</p>

<p>He saw an old man, white-bearded and grey-haired, carrying his
hat in his hand as he walked. His rough homespun clothing, his
collarless shirt open at the throat, the plaid scarf around his
neck, all these Poltavo saw through his powerful glasses and was
satisfied.</p>

<p>This was not the kind of man to play tricks, he smiled to
himself. Poltavo's precautions had been of an elaborate nature.
Three roads led to the downs, and in positions at equal distances
from where he stood he had placed three cars. He was ready for
all emergencies. If he had to fly, then whichever way of escape
was necessary would bring him to a means of placing a distance
between himself and any possible pursuer.</p>

<p>The old man came nearer. Poltavo made a hasty but narrow
survey of the messenger.</p>

<p>"Good," he said.</p>

<p>He walked to meet the old man.</p>

<p>"You have a letter for me?" he inquired.</p>

<p>The other glanced at him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Name?" he asked gruffly.</p>

<p>"My name," said the smiling Pole, "is Poltavo."</p>

<p>Slowly the messenger groped in his pockets and produced a
heavy package. "You've got to give me something," he said.</p>

<p>Poltavo handed over a sealed packet, receiving in exchange the
messenger's.</p>

<p>Again Poltavo shot a smiling glance at this sturdy old man.
Save for the beard and the grey hair which showed beneath the
broad-brimmed, wide-awake hat, this might have been a young
man.</p>

<p>"This is an historic meeting," Poltavo went on gaily. His
heart was light and his spirits as buoyant as ever they had been
in his life. All the prospects which this envelope, now bulging
in his pocket, promised, rose vividly before his eyes.</p>

<p>"Tell me your name, my old friend, that I may carry it with
me, and on some occasion which is not yet, that I may toast your
health."</p>

<p>"My name," said the old man, "is T.B. Smith, and I shall take
you into custody on a charge of attempting to extort money by
blackmail."</p>

<p>Poltavo sprang back, his face ashen. One hand dived for his
pistol-pocket, but before he could reach it T.B. was at his
throat. That moment the Pole felt two arms gripping him, two
steel bands they seemed, and likely to crush his arms into his
very body. Then he went over with the full weight of the
detective upon him, and was momentarily stunned by the shock. He
came to himself rapidly, but not quickly enough. He was conscious
of something cold about his wrists, and a none too kindly hand
dragged him to his feet T.B. with his white beard all awry was a
comical figure, but Poltavo had no sense of humour at that
moment.</p>

<p>"I think I have you at last, my friend," said T.B. pleasantly.
He was busy removing his disguise and wiping his face clean of
the grease paint, which had been necessary, with a handkerchief
which was already grimy with his exertions.</p>

<p>"You will have some difficulty in proving anything against
me," said the other defiantly; "there is only you and I, and my
word is as good as yours. As to the Duke of Ambury&mdash;"</p>

<p>T.B. laughed, a long chuckling laugh of delight.</p>

<p>"My poor man," he said pityingly, "there is no Duke of Ambury.
I depended somewhat upon your ignorance of English nobility, but
I confess that I did not think you would fall so quickly to the
bait The Dukedom of Ambury ceased to exist two hundred years ago.
It is one of those titles which have fallen into disuse. Ambury
Castle, from which the letters were addressed to you, is a small
suburban villa on the outskirts of Bolton, the rent of which," he
said carefully, "is, I believe, some forty pounds a year. We
English have a greater imagination than you credit us with,
Count," he went on, "and imagination takes no more common flight
than the namings of the small dwellings of our humble
fellow-citizens."</p>

<p>He took his prisoner by the arm and led him across the
downs.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" asked Poltavo.</p>

<p>"I shall first of all take you to Great Bradley police
station, and then I shall convey you to London," said T.B. "I
have three warrants for you, including an extradition warrant
issued on behalf of the Russian Government, but I think they may
have to wait a little while before they obtain any satisfaction
for your past misdeeds."</p>

<p>The direction they took led them to Moor Cottage. In a quarter
of an hour a force of police would be on the spot, for T.B. had
timed his arrangements almost to the minute. He opened the door
of the cottage and pushed his prisoner inside.</p>

<p>"We will avoid the study," he smiled; "you probably know our
mutual friend Lady Constance Dex disappeared under somewhat
extraordinary circumstances from that room, and since I have
every wish to keep you, we will take the drawing-room as a
temporary prison."</p>

<p>He opened the door of the little room in which the piano was,
and indicated to his captive to sit in one of the deep-seated
chairs.</p>

<p>"Now, my friend," said T.B., "we have a chance of mutual
understanding. I do not wish to disguise from you the fact that
you are liable to a very heavy sentence. That you are only an
agent I am aware, but in this particular case you were acting
entirely on your own account. You have made elaborate and
thorough preparations for leaving England."</p>

<p>Poltavo smiled.</p>

<p>"That is true," he said, frankly.</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"I have seen your trunks all beautifully new, and imposingly
labelled," he smiled, "and I have searched them."</p>

<p>Poltavo sat, his elbows on his knees, reflectively smoothing
his moustache with his manacled hands.</p>

<p>"Is there any way I can get out of this?" he asked, after a
while.</p>

<p>"You can make things much easier for yourself," replied T.B.
quietly.</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"By telling me all you know about Farrington and giving me any
information you can about the Secret House. Where, for instance,
is Lady Constance Dex?"</p>

<p>The other shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"She is alive, I can tell you that. I had a letter from Fall
in which he hinted as much. I do not know how they captured her,
or the circumstances of the case. All I can tell you is that she
is perfectly well and being looked after. You see Farrington had
to take her&mdash;she shot at him once&mdash;hastened his
disappearance in fact, and there was evidence that she was
planning further reprisals. As to the mysteries of the Secret
House," he said, frankly, "I know little or nothing. Farrington,
of course, is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Montague Fallock," said T.B. quietly. "I know that also."</p>

<p>"Then what else do you want to know?" asked the other, in
surprise. "I am perfectly willing, if you can make it easy for
me, to tell you everything. The man who is known as Moole is a
half-witted old farm labourer who was picked up by Farrington
some years ago to serve his purpose. He is the man who
unknowingly poses as a millionaire. It is his estate which
Farrington is supposed to be administering. You see," he
explained, "this rather takes off the suspicion which naturally
attaches to a house which nobody visits, and it gives the inmates
a certain amount of protection."</p>

<p>"That I understand," said T.B.; "it is, as you say, an
ingenious idea&mdash;what of Fall?"</p>

<p>Poltavo shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You know as much of him as I. There are, however, many things
which you may not know," he went on slowly, "and of these there
is one which you would pay a high price to learn. You will never
take Farrington."</p>

<p>"May I ask why?" asked T.B. interestedly.</p>

<p>"That is my secret," said the other; "that is the secret I am
willing to sell you."</p>

<p>"And the price?" asked T.B. after a pause.</p>

<p>"The price is my freedom," said the other boldly. "I know you
can do anything with the police. As yet, no charge has been made
against me. At the most, it is merely a question of attempting to
obtain money by a trick&mdash;and even so you will have some
difficulty in proving that I am guilty. Yes, I know you will deny
this, but I have some knowledge of the law, Mr. Smith, and I have
also some small experience of English juries. It is not the
English law that I am afraid of, and it is not the sentence which
your judges will pass upon me which fills me with apprehension. I
am afraid of my treatment at the hands of the Russian
Government."</p>

<p>He shivered a little.</p>

<p>"It is because I wish to avoid extradition that I make this
offer. Put things right for me, and I will place in your hands,
not only the secret of Farrington's scheme for escape, but also
the full list of his agents through the country. You will find
them in no books," he said with a smile; "my stay in the Secret
House was mainly occupied from morning till night in memorizing
those names and those addresses."</p>

<p>T.B. looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"There is something in what you say," he said. "I must have a
moment to consider your offer."</p>

<p>He heard a noise from the road without and pulled aside the
blind. A car had driven up and was discharging a little knot of
plain clothes Scotland Yard men. Amongst them he recognized
Ela.</p>

<p>"I shall take the liberty of locking you in this room for a
few moments whilst I consult my friends," said T.B.</p>

<p>He went out, turned the key in the lock and put it in his
pocket. Outside he met Ela.</p>

<p>"Have you got him?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>T.B. nodded.</p>

<p>"I have taken him," he said; "moreover, I rather fancy I have
got the whole outfit in my hands."</p>

<p>"The Secret House?" asked Ela eagerly.</p>

<p>"Everything," said T.B.; "it all depends upon what we can do
with Poltavo. If we can avoid bringing him before a magistrate, I
can smash this organization. I know it is contrary to the law,
but it is in the interests of the law. How many men have we
available?"</p>

<p>"There are a hundred and fifty in the town of Great Bradley
itself," said Ela calmly; "half of them local constabulary, and
half of them our own men."</p>

<p>"Send a man down to order them to take up a position round the
Secret House, allow nobody to leave it, stop all motor-cars
approaching or departing from the house, and above all things no
car is to leave Great Bradley without its occupants being
carefully scrutinized. What's that?" he turned suddenly.</p>

<p>A sudden muffled scream had broken into the conversation and
it had come from the inside of the cottage.</p>

<p>"Quick!" snapped T.B.</p>

<p>He sprang into the passage of the cottage, reached the door of
the room where he had left his prisoner, slipped the key in the
lock with an unerring hand and flung open the door.</p>

<p>The room was empty.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">FARRINGTON and Dr. Fall were closeted together
in the latter's office. Something had happened, which was
responsible for the gloom on the face of the usually
imperturbable doctor, and for the red rage which glowered in the
older man's eyes.</p>

<p>"You are sure of this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Quite sure," said Dr. Fall briefly; "he is making every
preparation to leave London. His trunks went away from Charing
Cross last night for Paris. He has let his house and collected
the rent in advance, and he has practically sold the furniture.
There can be no question whatever that our friend has betrayed
us."</p>

<p>"He would not dare," breathed Farrington.</p>

<p>The veins stood out on his forehead; he was controlling his
passionate temper by a supreme effort.</p>

<p>"I saved this man from beggary, Fall; I took the dog out of
the gutter, and I gave him a chance when he had already forfeited
his life. He would not dare!"</p>

<p>"My experience of criminals of this character," said Dr. Fall
calmly, "is that they will dare anything. You see, he is a
particularly obnoxious specimen of his race; all suaveness,
treachery, and remorseless energy. He would betray you; he would
betray his own brother. Did he not shoot his father&mdash;or his
alleged father, some years ago? I asked you not to trust him,
Farrington; if I had had my way, he would never have left this
house."</p>

<p>Farrington shook his head.</p>

<p>"It was for the girl's sake I let him go. Yes, yes," he went
on, seeing the look of surprise in the other's face, "it was
necessary that I should have somebody who stood in fear of me,
who would further my plans in that direction. The marriage was
necessary."</p>

<p>"You have been, if you will pardon my expressing the opinion,"
said Dr. Fall moodily, "just a little bit sentimental,
Farrington."</p>

<p>The other turned on him with an oath.</p>

<p>"I want none of your opinions," he said gruffly. "You will
never understand how I feel about this child. I took her from her
dead father, who was one of my best friends, and I confess, that
in the early days the thought of exploiting her fortune did occur
to me. But as the years passed she grew towards me&mdash;a new
and a beautiful influence in life, Fall. It was something that I
had never had before, a factor which had never occurred in my
stormy career. I grew to love the child, to love her more than I
love money, and that is saying a lot. I wanted to do the right
thing for her, and when my speculations were going wrong and I
had to borrow from her fortune I never had any doubt but what I
should be able to pay it back. When all the money
went,"&mdash;his voice sank until it was little more than a
whisper,&mdash;"and I realized that I had ruined the one human
being in the world whom I loved, I took the step which of all my
crimes I have most regretted. I sent George Doughton out of the
way in order that I might scheme to marry Doris to the Tollington
millionaire. For I knew the man we were seeking was Doughton. I
killed him," he said defiantly, "for the sake of his son's wife.
Oh, the irony of it!" He raised his hand with a harsh laugh. "The
comedy of it! As to Poltavo," he went on more calmly, "I let him
go because, as I say, I wanted him to further my object. That he
failed, or that he was remiss, does not affect the argument.
Doris is safely married," he mused; "if she does not love her
husband now, she will love him in time. She respects Frank
Doughton, and every day that passes will solidify that respect. I
know Doris, and I know something of her secret thoughts and her
secret wishes. She will forget me,"&mdash;his voice
shook,&mdash;"please God she will forget me."</p>

<p>He changed the subject quickly.</p>

<p>"Have you heard from Poltavo this morning?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," said Fall; "he has been communicating with
somebody or other, and the usual letters have been passing. Our
man says that he has a big coup on, but upon that Poltavo has not
informed us."</p>

<p>"If I thought he was going to play us false&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What would you do?" asked Fall quietly. "He is out of our
hands now."</p>

<p>There was a little buzz in one corner of the room, and Fall
turned his startled gaze upon the other.</p>

<p>"From the signal tower," he said. "I wonder what is
wrong."</p>

<p>High above the house was one square solitary tower, in which,
day and night, a watcher was stationed. Fall went to the
telephone and took down the receiver. He spoke a few words and
listened, then he hung up the receiver again and turned to
Farrington.</p>

<p>"Poltavo is in Great Bradley," he said; "one of our men has
seen him and signalled to the house."</p>

<p>"In Great Bradley!" Farrington's eyes narrowed. "What is he
doing here?"</p>

<p>"What was his car doing here the other day," asked Fall, "when
he kidnapped Frank Doughton? It was here to throw suspicion on us
and take suspicion off himself, the most obvious thing in the
world."</p>

<p>Again the buzzer sounded, and again Fall carried on a
conversation with the man on the roof in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Poltavo is on the downs," he said; "he has evidently come to
meet somebody; the look-out says he can see him from the tower
through his glasses, and that there is a man making his way
towards him."</p>

<p>"Let us see for ourselves," said Farrington.</p>

<p>They passed out of the room into another, opened what appeared
to be a cupboard door, but which was in reality one of the
innumerable elevators with which the house was furnished, and for
the working of which the great electrical plant was so
necessary.</p>

<p>They stepped into the lift, and in a few seconds had reached
the interior of the tower, with its glass-paned observation
windows and its telescopes. One of the foreign workmen, whom
Farrington employed, was carefully scrutinizing the distant downs
through a telescope which stood upon a large tripod.</p>

<p>"There he is," he said.</p>

<p>Farrington looked. There was no mistaking Poltavo, but who the
other man was, an old man doubled with age, his white beard
floating in the wind, Farrington could not say; he could only
conjecture.</p>

<p>Dr. Fall, searching the downs with another telescope, was
equally in the dark.</p>

<p>"This is the intermediary," said Farrington at last.</p>

<p>They watched the meeting, saw the exchange of the letters, and
Farrington uttered a curse. Then suddenly he saw the other leap
upon Poltavo and witnessed the brief struggle on the ground. Saw
the glitter of handcuffs and turned with a white face to the
doctor.</p>

<p>"My God!" he whispered. "Trapped!"</p>

<p>For the space of a few seconds they looked one at the
other.</p>

<p>"Will he betray us?" asked Farrington, voicing the unspoken
thoughts of Fall.</p>

<p>"He will betray us as much as he can," said the other. "We
must watch and see what happens. If he takes him into town, we
are lost."</p>

<p>"Is there any sign of police?" asked Farrington.</p>

<p>They scanned the horizon, but there was no evidence of a
lurking force, and they turned to watch T.B. Smith and his
prisoner making their slow way across the downs. For five minutes
they stood watching, then Fall uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"They are going to the cottage!" he said, and again the men's
eyes met.</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Farrington, but there was a little glint in
his eye which spoke of the hope behind the word.</p>

<p>Again an interval of silence. Three pairs of eyes followed the
men.</p>

<p>"It is the cottage!" said Fall. "Quick!"</p>

<p>In an instant the two men were in the lift and shooting
downwards; they did not stop till they reached the basement.</p>

<p>"You have a pistol?" asked Farrington.</p>

<p>Fall nodded. They quitted the lift and walked swiftly, along a
vaulted corridor, lighted at intervals with lamps set in niches.
On their way they passed a door made in the solid wall to their
left.</p>

<p>"We must get her out of this, if necessary," said Farrington
in a low voice. "She is not giving any trouble?"</p>

<p>Dr. Fall shook his head.</p>

<p>"A most tactful prisoner," he said, dryly.</p>

<p>At the end of the corridor was another door. Fall fitted a key
and swung open the heavy iron portal and the two men passed
through to a darkened chamber. Fall found the switch and
illuminated the apartment. It was a little room innocent of
windows, and lit as all the rest of the basement was by cornice
lamps. In one corner was a grey-painted iron door. This Fall
pushed aside on its noiseless runners. There was another elevator
here. The two men stepped in and the lift sunk and sunk until it
seemed as though it would never come to the end. It stopped at
last, and the men stepped out into a rock-hewn gallery.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that this was one of the old disused
galleries of the old mine over which the house was built. Fall
found the switch he sought and instantly the corridor was flooded
with bright light.</p>

<p>On a set of rails which ran the whole length of the gallery to
a point which was out of sight from where they stood, was a small
trolley. It was unlike the average trolley in that it was
obviously electrically driven. A third rail supplied the energy,
and the controlling levers were at the driver's hand.</p>

<p>Farrington climbed to the seat, and his companion followed,
and with a whirr of wheels and a splutter of sparks where the
motor brush caught the rail, the little trolley drove forward at
full speed.</p>

<p>They slowed at the gentle curves, increased speed again when
any uninterrupted length of gallery gave them encouragement, and
after five minutes' travel Farrington pulled back the lever and
applied the brake. They stepped out into a huge chamber similar
to that which they had just left. There was the inevitable lift
set, as it seemed, in the heart of the rock, though in reality it
was a bricked space. The two men entered and the lift rose
noiselessly.</p>

<p>"We will go up slowly," whispered Fall in the other's ear; "it
will not do to make a noise or to arouse any suspicions; we must
not forget that we have T.B. Smith to deal with."</p>

<p>Farrington nodded, and presently the lift stopped of its own
accord. They made no attempt to open whatever door was before
them. They could hear voices: one was T.B.'s, and the other was
unmistakably Poltavo's, and Poltavo was speaking.</p>

<p>Poltavo was offering in his eager way to betray the men who
sat in the darkness listening to his treachery. They heard the
motor-car's arrival outside, and presently T.B.'s voice
announcing his temporary retirement. They heard the slam of the
door, and the key click in the lock, and then Dr. Fall stepped
forward, pressed a spring in the rough woodwork in front of him
and one of the panels of the room slid silently back.</p>

<p>Poltavo did not see his visitors until they stood over him,
then he read in those hateful faces which were turned toward him
an unmistakable forecast of his doom.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he almost whispered.</p>

<p>"Do not raise your voice," said Farrington in the same tone,
"or you are a dead man." He held the point of a knife at the
other's throat.</p>

<p>"To where are you taking me?" asked Poltavo, ghastly white of
face and shaking from head to foot.</p>

<p>"We are taking you to a place where your opportunity for
betraying us will be a mighty small one," said Fall.</p>

<p>There was a horrible smile on his thin lips, and Poltavo, with
a premonition of what awaited him beyond the tunnel, forgot the
menacing knife at his throat and screamed.</p>

<p>Hands gripped him and strangled the cry as it escaped him.
Something heavy struck him behind the ear and he lost
consciousness. He awoke to find himself travelling smoothly along
the rock gallery. He was half lying, half reclining on Fall's
knees. He did not attempt to move; he knew now that he was in
mortal peril of his life. No word was spoken when he was dragged
roughly from the car, placed in another elevator and whirled
upwards, emerging into a little chamber at the end of the
underground corridor which ran beneath the Secret House.</p>

<p>A door was opened and he was thrust in without a word. He
heard the clang of the steel door behind him, and the lights came
on to show him that once again he was in the underground room
where he had been confined before.</p>

<p>There was the table, there was the heavy chair, there in the
far corner of the room was the barred entrance to the other
elevator. Anyway he was free from the police; that was something.
He was safe just so long as it suited the book of Farrington and
his friend to keep him safe. What would they do? What excuse
could he offer? They had overheard the conversation between
himself and T.B., he knew that, and cursed his folly. He ought to
have kept away from Moor Cottage. He knew there was something
sinister about the place, but T.B. should have known that even
better than he. Why had T.B. left him?</p>

<p>These and a thousand other thoughts shot through his mind as
he paced the vaulted apartment. They were in no hurry to feed
him. He had almost forgotten what time it was; whether it was day
or night in that underground vault into which no ray of sunlight
ever penetrated. They had left him with the handcuffs on his
wrists; they would come and relieve him of these encumbrances.
What were their plans with him? He felt his pockets carefully.
T.B. had taken away the only weapon he had had, and for the first
time for many years Count Poltavo was unarmed.</p>

<p>His heart was beating with painful rapidity and his breath
came laboriously. He was terror-stricken. He turned to find the
door through which he had come, and to his surprise he could not
see it. So far as he could detect, the stone wall ran without a
break from one end of the apartment to the other. Escape could
not lie that way; of that he was satisfied. There was nothing to
do but to wait, with whatever patience he could summon, to
discover their plans. He did not doubt that he was to suffer. He
had forfeited all right to their confidence, but if this was to
be the only consequence of his ill-doing he was not greatly
worried. Count Poltavo, as he had boasted before in this
identical room, had been in some tight corners and had faced
death in many strange and terrible guises, but the inevitability
of doom was never so impressed upon his mind as it was at this
moment when he lay guarded by a hundred secret forces in the tomb
of the Secret House.</p>

<p>He had one hope, a faint one, that T.B. would discover the
method of his exit from the room in Moor Cottage and would track
him here.</p>

<p>Evidently the occupants of the Secret House had the same fear,
for even here, in the quietness of his underground prison,
Poltavo could hear strange whining noises, rumbling, and groaning
and grinding, as though the whole of the house were changing its
construction.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait for news. A corner lift came swiftly
down and Fall stepped briskly towards his prisoner.</p>

<p>"T.B. Smith is in the house," he said, "and is making an
inspection; he will be down here in a moment. In these
circumstances I shall have to betray one of the secrets of this
house." He caught the other roughly by the arm and half led, half
dragged, him to a corner of the room. Handcuffed as he was,
Poltavo could offer no resistance. Dr. Fall apparently only
touched one portion of the wall, but he must have moved, either
with his foot or with his hand, some particularly powerful
spring, for a section of the stone wall swung backwards revealing
a black gap.</p>

<p>"Get in there," said Fall, and pushed him into the
darkness.</p>

<p>A few moments later T.B. Smith, accompanied by three
detectives, inspected the room which Poltavo had left. There was
no sign of the man, no evidence of his having so recently been an
occupant of his prison house.</p>

<p>For an interminable time Poltavo stood in the darkness. He
found he was in a small cell-like apartment with apparently no
outlet save that through which he had come.</p>

<p>He was able to breathe without difficulty, for the perfect
system of ventilation throughout the dungeons of the Secret House
had been its architect's greatest triumph.</p>

<p>It seemed hours that he waited there, though in reality it was
less than twenty minutes after his entrance that the door swung
open again and he was called out.</p>

<p>Farrington was in the room now, Farrington with his trusty
lieutenant, and behind them the one-eyed Italian desperado whom
Poltavo remembered seeing in the power house one day, when he had
been allowed the privilege of inspection.</p>

<p>Some slight change had been made in the room since he was
there last. Poltavo's nerves were in such a condition that he was
sensitive to this variation. He saw now what the change was. The
table had been drawn back leaving the chair where it was
fixed.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a fixed chair, he remembered that and wondered why
it had been screwed to the mock wood floor. Dr. Fall and the
engineer grasped him roughly and hurried him across the room,
thrusting him into the chair.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Poltavo, white as death.</p>

<p>"That you shall see."</p>

<p>Deftly they strapped him to the chair; his wrists and elbows
were securely fastened to the arms, and his ankles to the legs of
the massive piece of furniture.</p>

<p>From where he sat Poltavo confronted Farrington, but the big
man's mask-like face did not move, nor his eyes waiver as he
surveyed his treacherous prisoner. Then Fall knelt down and did
something, and Poltavo heard the ripping and tearing of
cloth.</p>

<p>They were slitting up each trouser leg, and he could not
understand why.</p>

<p>"Is this a joke?" he asked with a desperate attempt at
airiness.</p>

<p>No reply was made. Poltavo watched his captors curiously. What
was the object of it all? The two men busy at the chair lifted a
number of curious-looking objects from the floor; they clamped
one on each wrist, and he felt the cold surface of some
instrument pressing against each calf. Still he did not realize
the danger, or the grim determination of these men whose secret
he would have betrayed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Farrington," he appealed to the big man, "let us have an
understanding. I have played my game and lost."</p>

<p>"You have indeed," said Farrington.</p>

<p>They were the first words he had spoken.</p>

<p>"Give me enough to get out of the country," Poltavo appealed,
"just the money that I have in my pocket, and I promise you that
I will never trouble you again."</p>

<p>"My friend," said Farrington, "I have trusted you too long.
You forced yourself upon me when I did not desire you, you
thwarted me at every turn, you betrayed me whenever it was
possible to betray me, or whenever it was to your advantage to do
so, and I am determined that you shall have no other chance of
doing me an injury."</p>

<p>"What is this foolery?" asked Poltavo, in a mixture of blind
fear and rage. They had unlocked the handcuffs and taken them off
him, and now for the first time Poltavo noticed that the curious
bronze clamps on his wrists were attached by thick green cords to
a plug in the wall.</p>

<p>He shrieked aloud as he saw this, and the full horror of the
situation flashed upon him.</p>

<p>"My God," he screamed, "you are not going to kill me?"</p>

<p>Farrington nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"We are going to kill you painlessly, Poltavo," he said. "It
was your life or ours. We do not desire to cause you unnecessary
suffering, but here is the end of the adventure for you, my
friend."</p>

<p>"You are not going to electrocute me?" croaked the man in the
chair, in a hoarse cracked voice. "Don't say that you are going
to electrocute me, Farrington! It is diabolical, it is terrible.
Give me a chance of life! Give me a pistol, give me a knife, but
fight me fair. Treat me as you will; hand me to the police,
anything but this; for God's sake, Farrington, don't do
this!"</p>

<p>The doctor reached down and lifted a leather helmet from the
floor and placed it gently over the doomed man's head.</p>

<p>"Don't do it, Farrington." Poltavo's muffled voice came
painfully from behind the leather screen. "Don't! I swear I will
not betray you."</p>

<p>Farrington made a little signal and the doctor walked to the
wall and placed his hand upon a black switch.</p>

<p>"I will not betray you," said the man in the chair in hollow
tones. "Give me a chance. I will not tell them anything that
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not speak again, for the black switch had been pressed
down and death came with merciful swiftness.</p>

<p>They stood watching the figure. A slight quivering of the
hands and then Farrington nodded and the doctor turned the switch
over again.</p>

<p>Rapidly they unfastened the straps, and the limp thing which
was once human, with a brain to think and a capacity for life and
love, slipped out of the chair in an inanimate heap upon the
ground.</p>

<p>So passed Ernesto Poltavo, an adventurer and a villain, in the
prime of his life.</p>

<p>Farrington looked down upon the body with sombre eyes and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>He had opened his mouth to speak and Fall had walked to the
switchboard and was about to put the deadly apparatus out of
gear, when a sharp voice made them both turn.</p>

<p>"Hands up!" it said.</p>

<p>The stone door, through which Poltavo had passed to his doom
from the corridor without, was wide open, and in the doorway
stood T.B. and a little behind him Ela, and in T.B.'s hand was a
pistol.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="first">T.B. SMITH'S inspection of the Secret House had
yielded nothing satisfactory; he had not expected that it would;
he was perfectly satisfied that the keen, shrewd brains which
dominated the menage would remove any trace there was of foul
play.</p>

<p>"Where now?" asked Ela, as they turned out of the house.</p>

<p>"Back to Moor Cottage," said T.B., climbing into the car. "I
am certain that we are on the verge of our big discovery. There
is a way out of the cottage by some underground chamber, a way by
which first Lady Constance and then Poltavo were smuggled, and if
it is necessary I am going to smash every panel in those two
ground floor rooms, but I will find the way in to Mr.
Farrington's mystery house."</p>

<p>For half an hour the two men were engaged in the room from
which Poltavo had been taken. They probed with centre bits and
gimlets into every portion of the room.</p>

<p>The first discovery that they made was that the oaken panels
of the chamber were backed with sheet iron or steel.</p>

<p>"It is a hopeless job; we shall have to get another kind of
smith here to tear down all the panellings," said T.B., lighting
the gloom of his despair with a little flash of humour.</p>

<p>He fingered the tiny locket absently and opened it again.</p>

<p>"It is absurd," he laughed helplessly. "Here is the solution
in these simple words, and yet we brainy folk from the Yard
cannot understand them!"</p>

<p>"God sav the Keng!" said Ela ruefully. "I wonder how on earth
that is going to help us."</p>

<p>A gasp from T.B. made him turn his face to his chief.</p>

<p>T.B. Smith was pointing at the piano. In two strides he was
across the room, and sitting on the stool he lifted the cover and
struck a chord. The instrument sounded a little flat and
apparently had not received the attention of a tuner for some
time.</p>

<p>"I am going to play 'God save the King,'" said T.B. with a
light in his eyes, "and I think something is going to
happen."</p>

<p>Slowly he pounded forth the familiar tune; from beginning to
end he played it, and when he had finished he looked at Ela.</p>

<p>"Try it in another key," suggested Ela, and again T.B. played
the anthem. He was nearing the last few bars when there was a
click and he leapt up. One long panel had disappeared from the
side of the wall. For a moment the two men looked at one another.
They were alone in the house, although a policeman was within
call. The main force was gathered in the vicinity of the Secret
House.</p>

<p>T.B. flashed the light of his indispensable and inseparable
little electric lamp into the dark interior.</p>

<p>"I will go in first and see what happens," he said.</p>

<p>"I think we will both go together," said Ela grimly.</p>

<p>"There is a switch here," said T.B.</p>

<p>He pulled it down and a small lamp glowed, illuminating a tiny
lift cage.</p>

<p>"And here I presume are the necessary controlling buttons,"
said T.B., pointing to a number of white discs; "we will try this
one."</p>

<p>He pressed the button and instantly the cage began to fall. It
came to a standstill after a while and the men stepped out.</p>

<p>"Part of the old working," said T.B.; "a very ingenious
idea."</p>

<p>He flashed his lamp over the walls to find the electrical
connection. They were here, as they were at the other end,
perfectly accessible. An instant later the long corridor was
lighted up.</p>

<p>"By heavens," said T.B. admiringly, "they have even got an
underground tramway; look here!"</p>

<p>At this tiny terminus there were two branches of rails and a
car was in waiting. A few minutes later T.B. Smith had reached
the other end of the mine gallery and was seeking the second
elevator.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he said&mdash;"everything run by electricity. I
thought that power house of Farrington's had a pretty stiff job,
and now I see how heavy is the load which it has to carry. Step
carefully into this," he continued, "and make a careful note of
the way we are going. I think we must be about a hundred feet
below the level of the earth; just gauge it roughly as we go up.
Here we go."</p>

<p>He pressed a button and up went the lift. They passed out of
the little mine chamber, carefully propping back the swing door,
and made their way along the corridor.</p>

<p>"This looks like an apartment," said T.B., as he stopped
before a red-painted steel door in one of the walls. He pressed
it gently, but it did not yield. He made a further examination,
but there was no keyhole visible.</p>

<p>"This is either worked by a hidden spring or it does not work
at all," he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"If it is a spring," said Ela, "I will find it"</p>

<p>His sensitive hands went up and down the surface of the door
and presently they stopped.</p>

<p>"There is something which is little larger than a pin hole,"
he said. He took from his pocket a general utility knife and
slipped out a thin steel needle. "Pipe cleaners may be very
useful," he said, and pressed the long slender bodkin into the
aperture. Instantly, and without sound, the door opened.</p>

<p>T.B. was the first to go in, revolver in hand. He found
himself in a room which, even if it were a prison, was a
well-disguised prison. The walls were hung with costly tapestry,
the carpet under foot was thick and velvety and the furniture
which garnished the room was of a most costly and luxurious
description.</p>

<p>"Lady Constance!" gasped T.B. in surprise.</p>

<p>A woman who was sitting in a chair near the reading lamp rose
quickly and turned her startled gaze to the detective.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith," she said, and ran towards him. "Oh, thank God you
have come!"</p>

<p>She grasped him by his two arms; she was half hysterical in
that moment of her release, and was babbling an incoherent string
of words; a description of her capture&mdash;her fear&mdash;her
gratitude&mdash;all in an inextricably confused rush of half
completed phrases.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Lady Constance," said T.B. gently; "collect
yourself and try to remember&mdash;have you seen Poltavo?"</p>

<p>"Poltavo?" she said, startled into coherence. "No, is he
here?"</p>

<p>"He is somewhere here," said T.B. "I am seeking for him now.
Will you stay here or will you come with us?"</p>

<p>"I would rather come with you," she said with a shiver.</p>

<p>They passed through the door together.</p>

<p>"Do all these doors open upon rooms similar to this?" asked
T.B.</p>

<p>"I believe there are a number of underground cells," she
answered in a whisper, "but the principal one is that which is
near." She pointed to a red-painted door some twenty paces away
from the one from which they were emerging. There was another
pause whilst Ela repeated his examination of the door.</p>

<p>Apparently they all worked on the pick system, a method which
medieval conspirators favoured, and which the Italian workmen
probably imported from the land of their birth; a land which has
given the world the Borgias and the Medicis and the Visconti.</p>

<p>"Stay here," said T.B. in a low voice, and Lady Constance
shrank back against the wall.</p>

<p>Ela pressed in his little needle and again the result was
satisfactory. The door opened slowly and T.B. stepped in.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment trying to understand all that the
terrible scene signified. The limp body on the floor; the two
remorseless men standing close by; Farrington with folded arms
and his eye glowering down upon the dead man at his feet; Fall at
the switchboard.</p>

<p>Then T.B.'s revolver rose swiftly.</p>

<p>"Hands up!" he said.</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth when the room was
plunged in darkness, his companion was flung violently backward
as the electrical control came into operation and the door
slammed in Ela's face. He pressed it without avail. He brought to
his aid the little needle, but this time the lock would not
move.</p>

<p>Ela's face went chalk white.</p>

<p>"My God!" he gasped, "they've got T.B.!"</p>

<p>He stood for a moment in indecision. He had visualized the
scene and knew what fate would befall his chief.</p>

<p>"Back to the gallery," he said harshly, and led the way,
holding the woman's arm in support. He found his way without
difficulty to the lift, sprang into it, after Lady Constance, and
pressed the button.... Now they were speeding along the sparking
rail... now they were in the lift rising swiftly to the room in
Moor Cottage. T.B.'s car was outside.</p>

<p>"You had better come with me," said Ela quickly.</p>

<p>Lady Constance jumped into the car after him.</p>

<p>"To the Secret House," said Ela to the chauffeur, and as the
car drove forward he turned to the woman at his side.</p>

<p>"I will put you amongst your friends in a few moments," he
said; "at present I dare not risk the loss of a second."</p>

<p>"But what will they do?"</p>

<p>"I pretty well know what they will do," said Ela grimly.
"Farrington is playing his last hand, and T.B. Smith is to be his
last victim."</p>

<p>In the darkness of the underground chamber T.B. faced his
enemies, striving to pierce the gloom, his finger in position
upon the delicate trigger of his automatic pistol.</p>

<p>"Do not move," he said softly; "I will shoot without any
hesitation."</p>

<p>"There is no need to shoot," said the suave voice of the
doctor; "the lights went out, quite by accident, I assure you,
and you and your friends have no need to fear."</p>

<p>T.B. groped his way along the wall, his revolver extended. In
the gloom he felt rather than saw the bulky figure of the doctor
and reached out his hand gingerly.</p>

<p>Then something touched the outstretched palm, something that
in ordinary circumstances might have felt like the rough points
of a bass broom. T.B. was flung violently backwards and fell
heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>"Get him into the chair quick," he heard Farrington's voice
say. "That was a good idea of yours, doctor."</p>

<p>"Just a sprayed wire," said Dr. Fall complacently; "it is a
pretty useful check upon a man. You took a wonderful assistant
when you pressed electricity to your aid, Farrington."</p>

<p>The lights were all on now, and T.B. was being strapped to the
chair. He had recovered from the shock, but he had recovered too
late. In the interval of his unconsciousness the body of Poltavo
had been removed out of his sight. They were doing to him all
that they had done to Poltavo. He felt the electrodes at his calf
and on his wrists and clenched his teeth, for he knew in what
desperate strait he was.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Smith," said Farrington pleasantly, "I am afraid
you have got yourself into rather a mess. Where is the other
man?" he asked quickly. He looked at Fall, and the doctor
returned his gaze.</p>

<p>"I forgot the other man," said Fall slowly; "in the corridor
outside." He went to the invisible door and it opened at his
touch. He was out of the room a few minutes, and returned looking
old and drawn.</p>

<p>"He has got away," he said; "the woman has gone too."</p>

<p>Farrington nodded.</p>

<p>"What does he matter?" he asked roughly; "they know as much as
they are likely to know. Put the control on the door."</p>

<p>Fall turned over a switch and the other renewed his attention
to T.B.</p>

<p>"You know exactly how you are situated, Mr. Smith," said
Farrington, "and now I am going to tell you exactly how you may
escape from your position."</p>

<p>"I shall be interested to learn," said T.B. coolly, "but I
warn you before you tell me that if my escape is contingent upon
your own, then I am afraid I am doomed to dissolution."</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>"As you surmise," he said, "your escape is indeed contingent
upon mine and that of my friends. My terms to you are that you
shall pass me out of England. I know you are going to tell me
that you have not the power, but I am as well acquainted with the
extraordinary privileges of your department as you are. I know
that you can take me out of the Secret House and land me in
Calais to-morrow morning, and there is not one man throughout the
length and breadth of England who will say you nay. I offer you
your life on condition that you do this, otherwise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Otherwise?" asked T.B.</p>

<p>"Otherwise I shall kill you," said Farrington briefly, "just
as I killed Poltavo. You are the worst enemy I have and the most
dangerous. I have always marked you down as one whose attention
was to be avoided, and I shall probably kill you with less
compunction because I know that but for you I should not have
been forced to live this mad dog's life that has been mine for
the past few months. You will be interested, Mr. Smith, to learn
that you nearly had me once. You see the whole wing of the house
in which Mr. Moole lies," he smiled, "works on the principle of a
huge elevator. The secret of the Secret House is really the
secret of perfectly arranged lifts; that is to say," he went on,
"I can take my room to the first floor and I can transport it to
the fourth floor with greater ease than you can carry a chair
from a basement to an attic&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I guessed that much," said T.B. "Do you realize that you
might have made a fortune as a practical electrician?"</p>

<p>Farrington smiled.</p>

<p>"I very much doubt it," he said coolly; "but my career and my
wasted opportunities are of less interest to me at the moment
than my future and yours. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>T.B. smiled.</p>

<p>"I am going to do nothing," he said cheerfully, "unless it be
that I am going to die, for I can imagine no circumstance or
danger that threatens me or those I love best which would induce
me to loose upon the world such dangerous criminals as yourself
and your fellow-murderers. Your time has come, Farrington.
Whether my time comes a little sooner or later does not alter the
fact that you are within a month of your own death, whether you
kill me or whether you let me go."</p>

<p>"You are a bold man to tell me that," said Farrington between
his teeth.</p>

<p>T.B. saw from a glance at the blanched faces of the men that
his words had struck home.</p>

<p>"If you imagine you can escape," T.B. went on unconcernedly,
"why, I think you are wasting valuable time which might be better
utilized, for every moment of delay is a moment nearer to the
gallows for both of you."</p>

<p>"My friend, you are urging your own death," said Fall.</p>

<p>"As to that," said T.B., shrugging his shoulders, "I have no
means of foretelling, because I cannot look into the future any
more than you, and if it is the will of Providence that I should
die in the execution of my duty, I am as content to do so as any
soldier upon the battle-field, for it seems to me," he continued
half to himself, "that the arrayed enemies of society are more
terrible, more formidable, and more dangerous than the massed
enemies that a soldier is called upon to confront. They are only
enemies for a period; for a time of madness which is called
'war'; but you in your lives are enemies to society for all
time."</p>

<p>Fall exchanged glances with his superior, and Farrington
nodded.</p>

<p>The doctor leant down and picked up the leather helmet, and
placed it with the same tender care that he had displayed before
over the head of his previous victim.</p>

<p>"I give you three minutes to decide," said Farrington.</p>

<p>"You are wasting three minutes," said the muffled voice of
T.B. from under the helmet.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Farrington took out his watch and held it in his
unshaking palm; for the space of a hundred and eighty seconds
there was no sound in the room save the loud ticking of the
watch.</p>

<p>At the end of that time he replaced it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Will you agree to do as I ask?" he said.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply with undiminished vigour.</p>

<p>"Let him have it," said Farrington savagely.</p>

<p>Dr. Fall put up his hand to the switch, and as he did so the
lights flickered for a moment and slowly their brilliancy
diminished.</p>

<p>"Quick," said Farrington, and the doctor brought the switch
over just as the lights went out.</p>

<p>T.B. felt a sharp burning sensation that thrilled his whole
being and then lost consciousness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a group of police officers about the
gates of the Secret House as the car bearing Ela and the woman
came flying up.</p>

<p>The detective leapt out.</p>

<p>"They have taken T.B.," he said. He addressed a divisional
inspector, who was in charge of the corps.</p>

<p>"Close up the cordon," he went on, "and all men who are armed
follow me."</p>

<p>He raced up the garden path, but it was not toward the Secret
House that he directed his steps; he made a detour through a
little plantation to the power house.</p>

<p>A man stood at the door, a grimy-faced foreign workman who
scowled at the intruders. He tried to pull the sliding doors to
their place, but Ela caught the blue-coated man under the jaw and
sent him sprawling into the interior.</p>

<p>In an instant the detective was inside, confronting more
scowling workmen. A tall, good-looking man of middle age,
evidently a decent artisan, was in control, and he came forward,
a spanner in his hand, to repel the intruders.</p>

<p>But the pistol Ela carried was eloquent of his
earnestness.</p>

<p>"Stand back," he said. "Are you in charge?"</p>

<p>The detective spoke Italian fluently.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, signor?" asked the foreman.</p>

<p>"It means that I give you three minutes to stop the
dynamo."</p>

<p>"But that is impossible," said the other. "I cannot stop the
dynamo; it is against all orders."</p>

<p>"Stop that dynamo," hissed Ela between his teeth. "Stop it at
once, or you are a dead man."</p>

<p>The man hesitated, then walked to the great switchboard,
brilliant with a score of lights.</p>

<p>"I will not do it," he said sulkily. "There is the signal;
give it yourself."</p>

<p>A little red lamp suddenly glowed on the marble
switchboard.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Ela.</p>

<p>"That is a signal from the lower rooms," said the man
sullenly; "they want more power."</p>

<p>Ela turned on the man with a snarl, raised his pistol and
there was murder in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" gasped the Italian, and putting out his hand he
grasped a long red switch marked 'Danger' and pulled it over.
Instantly all the lights in the power house went dim, and the
great whirling wheels slowed down and stopped. Only the light of
day illuminated the power house. Ela, standing on the controlling
platform, wiped his perspiring face with the back of a hand which
was shaking as though with ague.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I was in time?" he muttered.</p>

<p>The big machinery hall was now alive with detectives.</p>

<p>"Take charge of every man," Ela ordered; "see that nobody
touches any of these switches. Arrest stokers and keep them
apart. Now you," he said, addressing the foreman in Italian, "you
seem a decent fellow, and I am going to give you a chance of
earning not only your freedom, but a substantial reward. I am a
police officer and I have come to make an inspection of this
house. You spoke of the lower rooms&mdash;do you know the way
there?"</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>"The lift cannot work, signor," he said, with a shrug of his
shoulders, "now that the electric current is stopped."</p>

<p>"Is there no other way?"</p>

<p>Again the man hesitated.</p>

<p>"There are stairs, signor," he stammered after a while, then
continued rapidly: "If this is a crime and Signor Moole is an
anarchist, I know nothing of it, I swear to you by the Virgin. I
am an honest man from Padua, and I have no knowledge of such
things as your Excellency speaks about."</p>

<p>Ela nodded.</p>

<p>"I am willing to believe that," he said in a milder tone.
"Now, my friend, you shall undo a great deal of mischief that has
been done by showing me the way to the underground rooms."</p>

<p>"I am at your service," said the man helplessly. "I call all
men to witness that I have done my best to carry out the
instructions which the padrone has given me."</p>

<p>He led the way out of the power house through a door which led
to a large stretch of private garden behind the main building,
across a well-kept lawn to an area basement which ran the whole
length of the house.</p>

<p>In this, at the far end, was a door, and the man opened it
with a key upon a bunch which he took from his pocket. They had
to pass through two more doors before they came to the spiral
staircase which led down into the gloomy depths beneath the
Secret House.</p>

<p>To Ela's surprise they were illuminated and he feared that
against his orders the dynamo had been restarted, but the man
reassured him.</p>

<p>"They are from the storage batteries," he said. "There is
sufficient to afford light all over the house, but not enough to
give power."</p>

<p>The steps seemed never ending. Ela counted eighty-seven before
at last they came to a landing from which one door opened. The
detective noticed that the man employed the same method of
entering here as he himself had done. A bodkin slipped into an
almost invisible hole produced the mechanical unsealing of this
doorway.</p>

<p>Ela stepped through the open door. Two lights burned dimly; he
saw the strapped figure in the chair and his heart sank. He went
forward at a run and Farrington was the first to hear him.</p>

<p>The big man turned, a revolver in his hand. There was a quick
deafening report, and another, and a third. Ela stood up unmoved,
unharmed, but Farrington, rocking as he staggered to the table,
slid to the ground with a bullet through his heart.</p>

<p>"Take that man," said Ela, and in an instant Fall was
handcuffed and secure.</p>

<p>Then Ela heard a silent sneeze and through the smoke from the
revolver shots the voice of T.B. Smith, saying: "A pity it takes
such ill-smelling powder to send our clever friend on his long
journey."</p>
