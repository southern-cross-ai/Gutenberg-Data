<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1. Strong Men</h2>

<p>The clock on Trinity Church pointed to half-past four. Rufus Kayne
glanced up from the letter at which he was scowling, observed the
lateness of the hour and pressed a pearl button upon the desk
beside him. He had not noticed the swift fading of the November
afternoon, for he worked in an artificial glare. The light which
beats upon the president of a trust company rivals that which in
past days was said to beat upon a throne.

<p>A young woman answered the bell, note-book in hand.</p>

<p>"If anything important comes up," said Kayne without removing
the cigar from his mouth, "you can get me at Mr. Pepperill's
office, and after that at the Corner Store Club. By the way, how
are my daughters' accounts?"</p>

<p>"Miss Diana is overdrawn thirty-five hundred dollars," replied
the secretary. "Miss Sheila only six hundred."</p>

<p>"Tell the cashier to write each of them a stiff letter,"
directed Kayne. "But transfer enough from my account to make the
overdrafts good." He crumpled the letter he had been reading into
his pocket. The writer&mdash;his other daughter, Claudia&mdash;was,
luckily for him, not in a position to overdraw. He had closed her
account because her husband was a blackguard. He got up and put on
his coat and hat.</p>

<p>"Well, that's all, I guess. Good night!"</p>

<p>He descended in the private elevator&mdash;sacred to the use of
the more exalted of the company's officers&mdash;to the great
marble entrance hall below, gaudy as a hotel, brilliant with giant
clusters of electric globes held aloft by bronze stands like
bunches of incandescent toy balloons. The place resembled a
railroad station. A pleasing sense of his power came over him as he
watched the multitude of clerks at the bronze grills, the rows of
grave officials at their desks. The doorman held back the crowd for
him to pass. Like royalty he emerged into Broadway. A few moments
later he was being similarly ushered into the offices of
Crutchfield &amp; Pepperill, his attorneys.</p>

<p>Rufus Kayne was a certain sort of gentleman. The crease in his
trousers was very marked; for the generation to which he belonged
regarded elegance of exterior as the <i>sine qua non</i> of
respectability, and after "the public be damned" epoch there were
few circles so ostentatiously, even painfully, respectable as the
upper crust of New' York society. The "high financiers" of the
'70's and '80's were all distinguished for their philanthropy and
tall hats. Dick Turpin's grandson doubtless passed the plate on
Sundays. So it was with the offspring of old Peter Kayne, "the
Pirate"&mdash;Rufus's father&mdash;and of the other freebooters of
the last century.</p>

<p>These founders of some of our best families had been a cutthroat
gang who gave neither themselves nor the public any quarter and who
slaughtered the lambs in uncounted flocks until Wall Street ran
with blood. The lambs had no business to be in Wall Street, and any
one who sat in the game took his chance of becoming a
millionaire&mdash;the word in those days savored of "gold, and
silver, ivory and apes, and peacocks"&mdash;or a pauper overnight.
He also ran the risk of having his pockets picked, his studs
removed, his ears slit, and his heart cut out&mdash;while he was
watching his adversary's draw. They were&mdash;those
old-timers&mdash;a husky brood of self-confessed rascals who chewed
tobacco, smoked raw cigars, ate and drank prodigiously, swore big
round oaths and drove fast horses&mdash;highwaymen who had held up
the stage and were now sitting on the box. Unscrupulous and cruel
in business matters, they were otherwise amiable, and, having made
their piles, immediately set about establishing themselves properly
upon the social ladder.</p>

<p>Here the fickleness of fortune showed itself, for, while some
had not the slightest difficulty in climbing to the top, others,
equally wealthy, for no tangible reason never got their feet off
the ground. Generically they were the same crew that fought over
the possession of the copper-mines, the street railroads, and the
insurance companies. Many of their children to-day are received in
the very best society, and beyond peradventure all of their
grandchildren will be.</p>

<p>Rufus himself had been among the fortunate ones. None had been
less respectable than his father, and none was now more so than he.
In some measure he had achieved this by associating both in
business and society only with those of impeccable antecedents and
position, of whom by no means the least distinguished was Mr.
Vincent Pepperill, his lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill, like most native New Yorkers, had been bom
elsewhere, but he had lived in Washington Square for over half a
century and the firm of Crutchfield &amp; Pepperill&mdash;although
there was no longer any Crutchfield and had not been for a
generation&mdash;was a legal institution. Officials, without
knowing exactly why, did things for Crutchfield &amp; Pepperill
that they did for nobody else, and the power of Mr.
Pepperill&mdash;although he was a delicate, slender old man with
tiny bones and a small birdlike head&mdash;was far-reaching. He now
leaned back in his swivel chair before a sea-coal fire regarding
somewhat superciliously the tall figure of his client who sat on
the other side of the desk, his broad shoulders stiffly erect, his
deep chest giving an impression of being expanded slightly above
the normal.</p>

<p>"At any rate," the lawyer now declared, "something should be
done about her." He tapped his fingertips together with a delicate
air, for he liked to drive the team of destiny with a rein of
gossamer. "She must not be left alone over there in England to her
own devices any longer!"</p>

<p>He spoke severely&mdash;with a touch of huskiness in his high
old voice&mdash;in the manner he habitually used, inevitably
suggesting that his clients were to blame for whatever difficulties
they found themselves in, which was indeed the case in the present
instance.</p>

<p>Rufus Kayne felt uneasily in his waistcoat pocket for a dgar.
His sallow face was too wide between the cheek bones, but his gray
eyes were keen, his forehead high and impressive.</p>

<p>"Claudia certainly has made a mess of it!" he said. "I had
another letter from her this afternoon."</p>

<p>Had he not been conferring with Mr. Pepperill he would have used
stronger language, but there was an austerity about the
aristocratic and somewhat condescending old lawyer which had a
subduing effect upon his more careless use of the vernacular, and
made him feel, when in his presence, somewhat like a schoolboy
summoned to the principal's office. Of this Mr. Pepperill was f ull
y aware and from it he drew satisfaction, since, on the whole, he
rather enjoyed patronizing the Kaynes and directing their
affairs.</p>

<p>"Don't blame the poor child too much," replied the lawyer.
"Harrowdale deceived everybody. I had the fellow up to dinner
myself. He had letters from some of the best people in
England."</p>

<p>"Who were no doubt glad to ship him over here to get rid of
him," growled his client. "It was his uniform caught her. Put a bit
of red flannel on a lapel and any woman will jump at it like a
bullfrog." He laughed grimly.</p>

<p>"Where is Lady Harrowdale now?" inquired Mr. Pepperill with a
trace of irony.</p>

<p>"Down in Surrey. The place stands in her name."</p>

<p>"You are lucky not to have made any settlement on him. Most of
these fortune-hunters insist on it."</p>

<p>"It may have put him off her at that," returned Kayne. "Perhaps
he doesn't like enforced domesticity as a condition to sharing his
wife's income. I ought to have known he was a rotter by his
manner."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't always tell by that!" answered his adviser. "What
a shame he couldn't behave himself! At any rate, she wants to come
home and naturally to bring her children along with her. The
question is how to go about it."</p>

<p>"I suppose they're her children as much as his," hazarded
Kayne.</p>

<p>"Not in England," grumbled Mr. Pepperill. "That's the trouble.
If once we could get them over here there'd be no difficulty
whatever. No American court would surrender them to him under any
circumstances as long as she was alive. We could show him up easily
enough. He'd never have the nerve even to try to get them; I'm
confident of that. But they're not here&mdash;they're over
there!"</p>

<p>"Can't she fight it out in the English courts?"</p>

<p>"She can fight all she wants, but she won't get anywhere. She
can't get a divorce&mdash;she hasn't the requisite legal grounds.
Mere adultery on the part of a husband isn't sufficient in England.
There must be 'cruelty' as well. Whatever else he may have done,
Harrowdale's never been guilty of cruelty in the technical sense,
and he's never in fact absolutely deserted her."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Kayne bitterly. "He just makes her life a hell by
openly amusing himself with other women. What a farce the English
divorce law is!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll have to buy him off!" averred the attorney.
"After all, as we were just saying, you didn't make any settlement
on him to begin with, and your daughter's liberty is worth
something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He'll never get a cent of my money!" retorted Kayne hotly.
"I'll go over myself first and take her away by force if
necessary."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" returned Mr. Pepperill with impatience. "Don't talk
nonsense. The first thing you knew you'd be in jail. Harrowdale's
got clever counsel&mdash;and he's acting strictly according to
their advice. Samuels &amp; Samuels&mdash;I know 'em
well&mdash;have retained them myself in important matters. They've
put those children in Chancery and she can't take them out of
England without making herself liable to imprisonment for contempt.
And there you are!"</p>

<p>"My grandchildren 'in Chancery'? How do you mean?" demanded his
client, scowling.</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill uncrossed his legs and crossed them again the
other way. From a legal point of view it was an interesting
case.</p>

<p>"Merely that old Samuels has deposited fifty pounds sterling to
the credit of each of the children,
which&mdash;technically&mdash;places them under the control of the
Lord Chancellor. His permission must be procured before they can be
taken out of his jurisdiction. And of course he wouldn't give it if
their father objected."</p>

<p>"Doesn't a mother have any rights in England?" demanded
Kayne.</p>

<p>"None worth mentioning. At any rate, your son-in-law has been
clever enough to clap a lien down on the children, and now he'll
make your daughter Claudia's life desperate in the hope that some
time or other you'll be willing to pay his price to lift it."</p>

<p>Kayne's face darkened.</p>

<p>"It looks as if he had a strangle hold on her! I suppose,
though, if she gets over here we can get her some kind of a
divorce?"</p>

<p>"Divorce? Certainly not&mdash;that is, not one that would be
worth anything. It would reflect on all of you."</p>

<p>"Do you really think," challenged Kayne, "that today anybody
cares two cents about divorce or anything else?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill did not conceal his disapproval. What Kayne had
said slurred indirectly everything that he held most sacred. It was
an insult to the permanent order of things.</p>

<p>The old lawyer had the irascible and violent pessimism incident
to his gout, and&mdash;in common with thousands of other equally
crotchety persons&mdash;was accustomed to declare that the world
was going to the dogs, and that nobody any longer had any reverence
for anything,&mdash;but he did not believe it. He belonged to a
generation that in spite of the fact that it had choked indignantly
over the Darwinian Theory, had yet after an acute spiritual
indigestion successfully ingurgitated it, although recalling the
process with no pleasure. He regarded the church's survival and
apparent recovery as proof positive of its permanence. It was there
and always would be there, in spite of golf, moral laxity,
scepticism, or plain indifference&mdash;of the existence of all of
which he was acutely aware.</p>

<p>He had been greatly depressed during the war; but he had never
had the slightest doubt as to its outcome or conceived the
possibility of a social overturn afterward. Others might believe
constitutional government&mdash;civilization even&mdash;to be
trembling in the balance and the whole world, like a house of
cards, on the verge of going Bolshevik&mdash;Russia toppling over
Poland, Poland collapsing Republican Germany&mdash;then
France&mdash;then England&mdash;and then what, by George! can save
us? But not he!</p>

<p>The world had justified his confidence. It had repudiated Lenine
and Trotzky and all their works. No communists&mdash;hardly a
socialist&mdash;dared peep. The rocking universe was solidly on its
bottom again. There was a Republican President in the White House,
the coal and railroad strikes had proved failures. God was in His
Heaven, all was fundamentally right with the world. Mr. Pepperill's
anchors were all holding. His good old order was rapidly coming
back to its own&mdash;Church, State, and Society. And perhaps the
greatest of these was Society&mdash;the Society of the best people,
of the conservative element who owned the pews in St. Timothy's,
the stock in the older banking-houses, the big blocks of realty in
lower New York, and who somehow still quietly ran things. To be
indifferent to their approval&mdash;to challenge their
opinion&mdash;was an admission of vulgarity or even worse. Mr.
Pepperill felt that a man with less remote claims to gentility
would not have made such a remark. Therefore he compressed his thin
lips and, looking at Kayne severely, said:</p>

<p>"I don't know what kind of people you have in mind, but my own
friends certainly have not changed their standards and"&mdash;he
hesitated pointedly&mdash;"they still seem to have some
influence."</p>

<p>Rufus Kayne perceived that he had been rebuked. He had no desire
to be exiled from the lawyer's esteem, even if the latter was an
old fogy.</p>

<p>"Oh," he hastened to explain, "I didn't mean exactly that; only
people nowadays seem to take that kind of thing a good deal more
easily than they used to."</p>

<p>"The right sort don't&mdash;the people who make sound public
opinion&mdash;like the Grahams, for example. I've been all through
this business, my dear sir&mdash;again and again, and there are
very few who go into it that don't suffer. Among the people who
count there is exactly the same underlying feeling about divorce
to-day as there was thirty&mdash;even forty&mdash;years ago. You
can't shake the solid foundation of American morals. However, a
couple of hundred thousand dollars would no doubt induce Sir Percy
to give your daughter the evidence upon which the courts would
grant her a decree. It's done every day over there&mdash;just as it
is here."</p>

<p>He tapped with his fingers impatiently upon his desk.</p>

<p>"Well! Think it over!"</p>

<p>There was dismissal in his tone. His client arose. He felt a
lack of sympathy in the old lawyer's attitude.</p>

<p>"I shan't pay a cent!" he repeated stubbornly. "But I don't want
to bother you. Your time is too valuable. Isn't there some young
man in your office that I can take it up with? I might want to do
something"&mdash;he smiled slyly&mdash;"that isn't quite
respectable&mdash;that the best people wouldn't approve of!"</p>

<p>The same thought had flashed through Mr. Pepperill's own mind.
He was a little tired of Kayne. The fellow was getting
bumptious&mdash;As for his wife!</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea!" he readily assented. He pressed a button, and
a page boy appeared at the door. "Ask Mr. Maitland to step in here
for a moment if he's not busy," said Mr. Pepperill. The boy nodded
and disappeared. "Maitland's a very capable fellow, I had him here
eight years, before the war, and now that it's over he's come back.
I've made him a junior partner. You'll find him all right. Ah!
There he is now. Mr. Kayne&mdash;this is Mr. Maitland. You can tell
him your troubles."</p>

<p>Rufus Kayne saw advancing toward him a tall, rather bony youth,
with gentle brown eyes and a singularly attractive wide-angle
smile, in which modesty was combined with quiet determination. His
curly hair, which was the same color as his eyes, grew into a sort
of peak in the centre of his forehead, and his complexion was of
that dusty brown with a touch of red-grape bloom so often found
among plainsmen. His bearing was at once deferential and
self-reliant, and his attitude toward the banker partook of that of
a younger officer addressing an older one.</p>

<p>"We might go into my room, if you don't mind," he suggested, and
Mr. Pepperill shook hands with Mr. Kayne.</p>

<p>"Remember me to your wife," said the lawyer. "You must both give
me the pleasure of your company at dinner soon. And thank her for
the invitation to your daughter Sheila's coming-out
party&mdash;when is it, by the way?"</p>

<p>"Friday of next week," replied Kayne.</p>

<p>"My commiserations," remarked Mr. Pepperill dryly. "Good
night."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2. The Laodicean</h2>

<p>The rise of the Haynes had been neither more rapid nor more
spectacular than that of many another of our first New York
families. As late as the year 1867 Peter B., its founder&mdash;then
twenty-six years of age, and still sound after two years in Libby
Prison&mdash;had been wielding a pick and carrying a dinner-pail on
the upper Merced in the company of his friend Billy McGaw.</p>

<p>Five years&mdash;during which he and Billy had wandered the
length of California and Nevada&mdash;and he had struck it rich by
bidding in an abandoned mine which instinct had told him was still
unexhausted. Then while his luck was strong he had hastened on to
Virginia City and had cleaned up a milli on or so with Flood, Fair,
and O'Brien, and then after roaring around the globe in yachts and
private cars in the company of select parties of ladies invited
from Butte and Denver for their charm of face and figure, had at
length become bored with the whole damn business, and returned East
to enter the game of "Bet-you-a-railroad." With him, on his
coat-tails, came Billy McGaw&mdash;unchanged from the days of the
upper Merced.</p>

<p>Ten years more and he had smashed two systems beyond recovery,
and incidentally had gilded the edges of the securities of three
others previously almost worthless. In this way he had drawn public
attention to the value of the investment and stimulated
railroad-building. People forgot about the roads he had put into
bankruptcy, and thought of him only as a financier. The
rumors&mdash;once common enough gossip&mdash;about the "Zara-zota"
and the "Aphrodite," with their painted guests, faded from official
memory.</p>

<p>Then the directors of a certain hospital published a benefaction
in the form of a half-million-dollar endowment to be known as "The
Peter B. Kayne Orthopaedic Wing," a commodious house was built on
the then upper reaches of Fifth Avenue, and the family rented a pew
in the Madison Avenue Methodist Church. This last, proving an
obvious social error, they gradually and unostentatiously withdrew,
Rufus and his sister Bridget transferring their allegiance to St.
Timothy's, to which they presented a reredos of surpassing beauty
in memory of their mother, and James affiliating himself with the
somewhat less fashionable but none the less respectable synod of
the Marble Presbyterian Church on Thirty-fourth Street.</p>

<p>James and his wife, although Presbyterians, had pronounced
social ambitions and, accordingly, while jealous of the Rufuses,
made a point of more or less keeping up with them; while Bridget,
their only sister, who had married a dyspeptic and who in
consequence spent most of her time with him at various salt and hot
sanitariums when in her native country, and at a similar collection
of <i>bads, bains</i>, and hydros when the state of the world
permitted her to go abroad, was always, between times, at the house
of "my brother, Mr. Rufus Kayne," the relationship constituting in
her opinion her chief social asset. But there could hardly be said
to be much family feeling, and the Rufuses and the Jameses had been
known to stay at different hotels in Paris contemporaneously for
several weeks without going to see one another. This preference for
standing upon their own feet may have had its origin in a suspicion
that the less there was made of the family the better, and that it
would not do to let the world suppose for one instant that they
needed any mutual support.</p>

<p>They all were, still, it must be confessed, just a little
sensitive about their antecedents, and preferred to go it alone
rather than run any risk of inconvenient family intimacies. Things
were well enough&mdash;let them be. Needless to say, the fact that
they had originally lived in Brooklyn&mdash;"the Heights&mdash;not
the Hill!"&mdash;was never mentioned, although Brooklyn had been at
the time socially quite impeccable. The embarrassment lay in the
fact that during the same period old Peter had owned the
"Zarazota."</p>

<p>It is doubtful if either Uncle James or Aunt Bridget would have
admitted their prehistoric association with the place or
acknowledged that they knew how to get there. Yet the Kayne plot in
Greenwood was one of the most magnificent in the cemetery,
commanding a beautiful view of the neighboring outskirts of
Flatbush, and adorned with a polished pink monument in the best
possible taste marked "KAYNE" in raised letters of great size and
dignity. Eventually they would all go back there whether they
wanted to or not.</p>

<p>They all showed an astonishing lack of pride in the wide-spread
culinary reputation, especially for cookies, doughnuts, and apple
turnovers, enjoyed by their mother in an era when "piazza parties"
were fashionable and it was quite the thing for whole families to
sit on the front steps together on summer evenings calling across
mild witticisms to their neighbors on the opposite side of the
street, or even humming sentimental melodies to Bridget's&mdash;the
present Mrs. Mallory's&mdash;ivory-inlaid guitar, which she had
discarded long years ago for the far more convenient pianola with
its unlimited repertory. Had it not been for the tintype secretly
preserved in a cherished album it would have been impossible to
associate her with a guitar, even with one inlaid with ivory. Yet
Rufus, clad in a red-and-black flannel blazer with three-inch
stripes, had once innocently sung to it on Remsen Street, strumming
a lopsided tennis racket and twisting imaginary mustachios to the
childish delight of Bridget and James.</p>

<p class="poem">"I'm Pierre de Bonton de Paree de Paree,<br>
An' I drink the divine odervee, odervee!<br>
As I drive out each day in my leettle coupay<br>
I tell you I'm something to see-e-e!"</p>

<p>Both Bridget and James forever after visualized the aristocracy
of the Faubourg St. Germain as wearing red-and-black blazers, and
taking the air in diminutive broughams.</p>

<p>It was a violent transition from the Remsen Street Rufus of the
Polytechnic Institute to the Fifth Avenue Rufus of the Utopia Trust
Company. Yale University and some three millions of dollars had
both been of material assistance in consummating it.</p>

<p>No two characters are equally clear-cut. Old Peter Kayne was
like a granite figure chiselled by nature on a mountainside&mdash;a
man of energy and individuality who crushed his opponents by direct
methods and had no sympathy with dissimulation; who laid his cards
on the table, betting his high hands high and his low hands low;
brutally intolerant perhaps, but straight in his crookedness. Rufus
endeavored to imitate his father's qualities, adopting a shortness
of speech and a brusqueness of manner designed to convey the
impression of force and frankness. But because he had no definite
convictions, unless business policies can be called Such, there was
nothing really definite about him except his desire to get on. He
was a good bluffer and talked confidently of art, music, and
literature, of which he in fact knew little except what he
remembered from a few "snap" courses at Yale. He read almost
nothing except the daily papers, and an occasional review, yet he
posed as a man of culture&mdash;rather "an intellectual" than
otherwise&mdash;and could probably have defended his title
satisfactorily enough for his own purposes. No one challenged it,
however, for there was no one in his set capable of doing so. At a
meeting of the board of trustees of the New York Public Library, of
which, like Mr. Pepperill, he was a member, he could preside with
all the dignity of a college president.</p>

<p>In one respect dogmatic theology had profoundly affected his
life, although he would have been surprised to learn it. Rufus
Kayne believed confidently in a kind of heaven to which years would
give him right of access. While he had no faith in the creed which
he professed, he was nevertheless unwilling to surrender the joys
of the hereafter, and looked forward in lieu of it to a future
period of compensating enjoyment here on earth.</p>

<p>So does almost every other American business man. Some time or
other, when he has made his pile, when he reaches the age of
fifty-five or sixty or sixty-five, when the children are all
married, or the business is properly established, every man of
Rufus Kayne's type expects to "lay off" and begin to have a good
time. Then&mdash;and apparently not until then&mdash;does he
anticipate getting very much out of life. Then his stocks will all
pay dividends, and he will begin to be repaid for his hard work. At
that fair but far-distant day he purposes taking up golf,
travelling round the world, reading history, and indulging that
natural taste for all the arts which he confidently assumes is
latent in his nature, and will burst into fragrant blossom at his
call. Why does he imagine that the sun will shine more brightly
then than it does now, that Beethoven rather than Irving Berlin
will then inthrall him, Walter Pater (if he has heard the name)
rather than Ring Lardner and Irv Cobb, that his rather indifferent
friends will experience a new burst of affection and come crowding
about him, or that the young girls will find him any more
attractive than they do to-day? Fatuous mirage of Mohammed's
paradise! Bitter is the day of realization that the Goddess of
Pleasure demands more persistent wooing than any other
mistress!</p>

<p>Rufus Kayne took it for granted that he was a good husband and
father, and that his home was of the kind referred to in the
newspapers as "model" and "American," although apart from signing a
check each month for the servants' wages he paid it no attention
whatever. Intellectually, his wife Elizabeth was entirely
unsympathetic to him. As for his two daughters who still remained
at home, Diana, the elder, lived a life of her own, while Sheila,
the younger, now about to make her début into society, had really
been "out" since she was fifteen, her existence being composed of a
continuous series of juvenile dances, dinner, theatre, and house
parties in the winter, with the added delights in summer of picnics
and wild excursions on land and water lasting half the night. Kayne
himself was in effect a stranger to the members of his family, who
rarely since childhood had gathered around the hearth or
reading-lamp for an evening, and none of whom ever knew which of
the others was going to be home for dinner.</p>

<p>He also took it for granted that he was a patriotic and
unselfish citizen. It was marvellous how many committees he
belonged to, and how adept he was in organizing them, getting
himself chosen chairman, and then turning the whole thing over to a
hired secretary whose salary was the first charge on the funds
collected. Sometimes unfortunately the funds only sufficed to pay
for room rent, stationery, and the services of the professional
uplift worker who usually assisted in Rufus Kayne's civic
enterprises and made a very neat living out of them.</p>

<p>There his interest in his fellow men, his city, his native
country and its flag, stopped. So long as stocks were strong and
real-estate values soared his soul leaped with them in patriotic
fervor. When they were down he sulked. About once a year his
lithograph accompanied by a short but laudatory account of his
achievements would appear in some magazine. In it he would be shown
seated at his desk, an engraving of George Washington on the wall
behind him, pondering deeply some problem of the moment, his nose,
chin, and shoulders touched up just enough to give that effect of
power, determination, and will so desirable in one of those leaders
who make America what it is&mdash;and who at the same time make
what they can out of America.</p>

<p>Sometimes when he felt the need of exercise, after a too heavy
luncheon with some of his fellow directors, he would take a turn up
Fourth Avenue in the neighborhood of Twenty-third Street, and find
himself struggling against the horde of dark-skinned, furtive-eyed
foreigners who were pouring out of the lofts recently converted
into sweat-shops. There were so many of them that it made him
uneasy. Who were these hostile-looking thousands? Whence did they
come? Would they overrun and devour America like a plague of
locusts? Would they by virtue of expanding numbers take possession
of the polls, the public offices, and the central government? What
respect had they for American traditions? For the flag to which he
scrupulously doffed his hat whenever he met it "carried in line"?
These children of the proletariat and the revolution, who regarded
the freedom of the Constitution as only one more new tyranny, would
cut his throat in a moment&mdash;run a pike through his bourgeois
belly&mdash;without a thought save for the glory of the new order.
Aliens! who cared nothing for America save to exploit it, to make
money out of it, and to propagate in it, strangling in their fierce
individualism the native inhabitants who loved and cherished the
land. With a shudder Kayne would turn into the nearest side street
to avoid meeting those dangerous men so different from himself!</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3. Claudia's Affair</h2>

<p>This was the man who followed his new adviser through the
phalanx of desks in the outer office of Crutchfield &amp;
Pepperill's at which a dozen or so of very young men were
ostentatiously engrossed, past a double row of rapid-firing
typewriting machines, and into a cubicle that smelled strongly of
pipe-tobacco. Beside a window opening into an interior court stood
a small oak desk upon which lay a single bundle of papers, a
package of cheap cigarettes, a card of matches, and a tin box of
cut plug. Lloyd Maitland pulled a chair forward and offered it to
the banker.</p>

<p>In his earlier years in the office and before joining the army
he had often heard vaguely of Kayne as one of the "strong" men in
Wall Street. As, however, the banker had become a client of Mr.
Pepperill's only upon the formation of the Utopia Trust Company in
1917, Maitland had never before met him. Now he regarded him with
interest since he had always pictured to him self men of that type
as having something superhuman about them or, at any rate, about
their mentality. He was glad that they had it&mdash;they needed to
have it&mdash;for he knew that, democracy or no democracy, such men
controlled the destinies of the nation far more than public
office-holders elected by the ballot. When a man like Kayne sent a
telegram to the White House&mdash;he received an immediate answer.
With his natural diffidence Maitland felt&mdash;at first&mdash;even
more awe for Rufus Kayne than the latter felt for Mr.
Pepperill.</p>

<p>"Please sit down," said he with a slightly embarrassed laugh.
"This is the star-chamber!" Then perceiving Kayne's cigar he
produced with evident relief a short pipe (which it appeared he had
been carrying in his left hand all the while) and blew through it
with a whistling sound.</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to be much of a lawyer," he remarked, as he
refilled it elaborately after this natural vacuum-cleaning process,
"and I'm afraid I can't be of much help to you, but you might
explain your difficulty and I'll do the best I can."</p>

<p>The modesty of this introduction impressed Kayne favorably. From
his experience most young men were assertive and overconfident. He
did not realize to what an extent they modelled themselves upon
their elders. But this chap, as he sat there sucking small hollows
in his gaunt cheeks, looked, he thought, like a capable citizen. He
might as well get on friendly terms with him at once. He had found
most returned soldiers not averse to acknowledging their services.
So with his accustomed diplomacy he said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Pepperill has told me that you were at the front. On what
sector were you?"</p>

<p>But Maitland responded only vaguely.</p>

<p>"Oh, all over the lot," he answered. "Now about this affair of
your daughter's-?"</p>

<p>And Kayne, in the calm, even tone that he used when addressing
his board of directors, which suggested such weighty consideration
and such an infinity of reserve, found himself recounting to
Maitland the history of his daughter Claudia's unfortunate marriage
to Sir Percy Harrowdale.</p>

<p>Nobody had been particularly to blame for it, he explained; for
Harrowdale had appeared in every respect an attractive and
gentlemanly fellow&mdash;girls were half-hysterical at that age
anyhow!&mdash;an exceptionally good-looking chap&mdash;with a
supercilious air about him that was tremendously effective,
particularly in dress uniform. It had been quite an affair&mdash;a
military wedding&mdash;numerous officials on from
Washington&mdash;and cables of congratulation from several
distinguished members of the British peerage. The couple had
returned to England, Harrowdale had resigned his commission in the
Commissary or whatever it was, and they had bought a place in the
country. Claudia had had two children&mdash;a girl first, then a
boy, and for a while her letters had indicated entire
happiness.</p>

<p>Then had come the inevitable change. Harrowdale had shown no
intention of re-entering the army, as he had assured everybody that
he would. He had demanded more money and she had given it to him
and had then made application to her father to increase her
allowance. The old story! Now Harrowdale was openly unfaithful to
her and evidently trying&mdash;with the aid of a shrewd and
unscrupulous pair of solicitors&mdash;to blackmail her family into
buying him off. But he was going to be disappointed!</p>

<p>The banker's studied reserve vanished and he banged the table
with his fist, his sallow cheeks taking on a ruddy tinge. Through
this affair of Claudia's he had suffered his first setback at the
hands of fate. Until then everything had gone well with
him&mdash;in business and society.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon!" muttered Maitland through his pipe, as he
tilted back in his chair and nursed his left elbow with his right
hand. "Didn't you look this fellow up&mdash;at all?"</p>

<p>Kayne shifted his eyes.</p>

<p>"There wasn't any particular need to. He was in
DeBrett&mdash;and he had a captain's commission."</p>

<p>"In what branch of the service?" inquired Maitland. "Why wasn't
he at the front?"</p>

<p>The banker shrugged his shoulders, while Maitland sucked on his
pipe disgustedly and then emptied it on the window-sill.</p>

<p>"Some of those fellows who came over here were all right," he
commented, "the ones who had been wounded, but a lot of them were
just bounders whose people wanted to get rid of them. I don't
suppose you ever inquired what this chap's duties were? Or how he
had the time to be hanging around doing the social act? If you had,
maybe you'd have discovered that his job was buying sardines and
wrist-watches for the Camel Corps. I've seen a lot of those bally
boys. They're quite fascinating, some of them. But I shouldn't want
them for sons-in-law. I suppose your daughter thought he was in
love with her; but of course he was only after your money, and as
he couldn't get it one way he's now trying to get it another.
However, if you aren't willing to give it to him, I don't know how
he can get it&mdash;that's one comfort!"</p>

<p>He dropped the legs of his chair forward to the floor.</p>

<p>"As to the other aspect of it, they've got you on the law. She's
the wife of a British subject, domiciled and resident in England,
and with no legal ground for a decree of divorce under their
statutes. Of course her husband can't keep her
there&mdash;matrimonial slavery doesn't go that far in England, but
he can put a legal padlock on the children, and apparently he's
done it. Well, that being so, there's nothing for it but to let the
law go hang and take the matter into our own hands."</p>

<p>Kayne's eyes brightened. This fellow was a man of action.</p>

<p>"How do you suggest going about it?" he inquired. "I don't want
to have the Lord Chancellor clap my daughter into the Tower."</p>

<p>Maitland slowly refilled his pipe, and having lighted it, once
more tilted back his chair until his head touched the wall.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know anybody in the steamship business?" he
asked meditatively.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes. I'm a director in one company myself," replied
Kayne.</p>

<p>"I should say," continued Maitland, "that somebody would have to
run them out of England when the Lord Chancellor wasn't looking,
and put them aboard a vessel outside the three-mile limit. It
shouldn't be difficult. May cost you a trifle, but I should think
you could combine the adventure with a cargo of machinery or
something. Of course you can't go publishing their proposed sailing
in the London papers and you can't write to your daughter about it;
but the actual thing&mdash;the 'getaway'&mdash;ought to be fairly
easy."</p>

<p>"How shall we go about it?" asked Kayne.</p>

<p>Maitland caressed his bony jaw.</p>

<p>"The whole thing will have to be explained personally to her, of
course. Somebody will have to go over there and handle it
directly&mdash;on the spot."</p>

<p>"Have you anybody you can send?"</p>

<p>The young lawyer looked contemplatively at the banker.</p>

<p>"I have an idea," he answered slowly, "that I know exactly the
man for you&mdash;if he'll go&mdash;and I think he will. I'll talk
it over with him and let you know. Anyhow, the whole thing will
have to be worked out rather carefully. Suppose I call you up about
it in the course of a day or so?"</p>

<p>"Good!" cried his client, rising. "The sooner it is done the
better. And," he added with a smile, "you must meet my wife and
family. If you ever bring yourself to go to such things, I'll see
that you're sent a card to my daughter's dance next week.
Goodnight!"</p>

<p>He gave Maitland a friendly nod, shook hands, and walked out,
leaving the lawyer wondering how any man in his senses could let
his daughter marry an utter stranger on the latter's own
representations. This Kayne was clearly a man of affairs, who in
business probably never took a chance, yet who when it came to the
most important event of his family life&mdash;the marriage of his
daughter&mdash;shut his eyes and turned her over to a wretched
adventurer too yellow to stay in his own country. His own butler
would have required a fuller identification before delivering
"goods to be called for" at the front door!</p>

<p>The elder lawyer was still poring over some papers at his desk
when Maitland came into his office.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of him?" he asked, looking up
whimsically.</p>

<p>"Frankly, I don't understand him at all!" answered his junior.
"What sort of a person is he?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill made a wry face over his manuscript.</p>

<p>"One of our best materialists! The greater success a man is in
business the bigger failure he is apt to be at home. He's so busy
feathering his nest that he hasn't any chance to look after his
eggs. He is like a prima donna&mdash;whose art engrosses all her
intention. Our financiers shouldn't marry, they haven't time!"</p>

<p>Maitland shook his head in mute amazement.</p>

<p>"Is his daughter herself&mdash;are the whole family like
that?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill thrust his pen into its bed of bird-shot and
leaned back.</p>

<p>"More or less," he replied. "You've escaped&mdash;being away as
you have&mdash;getting mixed up in their affairs; but now that
you're back I think I shall turn them all over to you. Why have a
junior partner unless he can relieve one of distasteful tasks? I've
reached an age when I want to do business only for people I like.
If you have finished with your work for the day, suppose we take
the subway to Fifth Avenue and Sixtieth Street and walk back as far
as Madison Square? That will give me an opportunity to tell you
something more about the Kaynes."</p>

<p>"With pleasure, sir!" agreed Lloyd. "I'll meet you in the outer
office in five minutes?"</p>

<p>The door closed, leaving Mr. Pepperill alone with hims elf; and
with just the faintest shadow on his desiccated old heart because
he did not have a tall, bony, strong, good-natured son like that.
But it was only the faintest shadow, since apart from his gout Mr.
Pepperill saw to it that he had no sorrows and regrets, having
eliminated all such possibilities early in life. Death could not
hurt him, for he had no relations&mdash;no wife, no child; his
caution had kept him continent and he had nothing to fear from
women; his fortune&mdash;and it was large&mdash;was invested in
government securities; he never expressed himself publicly or took
part in acrimonious discussions; he never climbed over an obstacle,
but always made his way carefully around it; he was always
courteous, diplomatic&mdash;qualifying all his opinions so as by no
possibility to give offense or to prevent later a reasonable change
of mind; in a word, he took no chances, but lived sanely and
reputably, playing safe and keeping the talent of his heart hidden
in the napkin of discretion. So he had never suffered&mdash;except
from the gout.</p>

<p>He signed a letter or two for Williamson, his secretary, a
decorous but depressed quasi-legal gentleman, and then having put
on his tight-fitting blue overcoat and tall hat, stood for a moment
beside his desk glancing over the front page of the evening
paper.</p>

<p>"Grand jury sifts new charges of city maladministration." "Forty
more indictments in building inquiry." "Jury acquits bartender
accused of liquor violation," he read. Kayne's query returned to
his mind: "Do you think that to-day anybody cares?" He wondered if,
after all, there might not be something in what the banker had
said. Before him in cold print were the detailed reports of several
official investigations into alleged corruption in public office,
business abuses and conspiracies, all being conducted at the same
time, and in spite of the evidence adduced exciting little
interest. He could remember the time when any one of them would
have turned a municipal election and aroused public indignation to
the highest pitch. You had only to go back to Jerome's
campaign.</p>

<p>"Too much politics!" muttered Mr. Pepperill. "The people don't
trust these fellows, always hallooing 'Wolf! Wolf!' at one
another."</p>

<p>The war probably had had something to do with it, too. And look
at the way the liquor law was being turned into a farce by juries
sworn to uphold it! It was nothing less than perjury! If one didn't
know the inherent soundness of the American people!</p>

<p>He glanced around the room for reassurance&mdash;at the picture
of Lord Eldon in his full-bottomed wig, at the steel-engravings of
Alexander Hamilton, Rufus Choate, Chief Justice Marshall, and
Chancellor Kent, and, on the shelves at the end of the bookcase, at
the green tin boxes containing the tangible records of his clients'
stability and success. There they stood like solid rectangular
blocks in the temple of his own prosperous career&mdash;bearing in
letters of gold the names of the persons, estates, and corporations
to which they were sacred. "Graham &amp; Co."; "Peter B. Kayne";
"Utopia Trust Co."; "Estate of Mungo Graham, dec'd"; "Estate of
Ezra Graham, dec'd"; "Kayne vs. Gould." There was an annual income
of fifty thousand dollars in new retainers on the bottom shelf
alone!</p>

<p>Yes, the world was all right. The war had disturbed things a
little, but everything was fundamentally sound. Which reminded him
that he was entertaining at dinner that very evening a small,
select group of those who made it so. He had almost forgotten about
it. Ringing for Williamson again, he instructed him to call up the
house and tell Griffin, his butler, to be sure to cool the burgundy
but not to chill it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4. The House of Kayne</h2>

<p>A half-hour later Mr. Pepperill accompanied by Colonel Maitland
emerged from the subway in front of the Metropolitan Club at
Sixtieth Street and started briskly southward. It had been snowing,
and a white powder already marked by countless footprints lay upon
the sidewalks. Maitland amused himself by wondering what different
species of human animals had made them. Ahead&mdash;an infinite
parallel of yellow lights&mdash;the vivid thoroughfare descended in
a graceful curve, rising slightly half a mile beyond at
Forty-second Street, only to sink again farther on near
Thirty-fourth, and punctuated by traffic towers flashing their
singing colors, now orange, now red, now green, while the jam of
motors stopped and moved on in automatic obedience. His blood
pricked in response to the bite of the frosty air, the surge of the
crowds, the dim reverberation of churchbells, the "punch," the
"pep," the gay gesture of the city after the day's work.</p>

<p>"That," said Mr. Pepperill, waving his malacca stick at a large
brownstone mansion on one of the opposite corners in the
neighborhood of the Cathedral, "is the Kayne house."</p>

<p>At almost the same instant a closed motor drew up at the curb, a
footman leaped down and whipped open the door, and a stout lady got
out.</p>

<p>"The car at five minutes before eight for Miss Diana, Albert,"
she said in a conciliatory tone as he touched his visor. "And Miss
Sheila will want you to take her to the Croyon at eleven."</p>

<p>"There is Mrs. Kayne, now," continued Mr. Pepperill, his
quizzical glance following the figure of the lady into the house.
In his mind's eye he pictured the heavy walnut wainscoting of the
entrance-hall with its great organ surmounted by the carved
mezzanine gallery, the five-foot porcelain and gilt Sevres jars,
the Greek slave of glistening Carrara marble peeping out coyly from
behind its screen of palms, the bald, fat
butler&mdash;Jarmon&mdash;closing the front door behind his
mistress and bowing her ceremoniously into the elevator.</p>

<p>Maitland, however, saw only the substantial respectability of
the brownstone facade.</p>

<p>"Some house!" he commented in the vernacular of five allies.</p>

<p>"Ought to be! Cost nearly a million&mdash;with the furniture,"
answered Mr. Pepperill tartly.</p>

<p>"But why don't you like the Kaynes? What's the matter with
them?" persisted the younger man.</p>

<p>"Because," said he, "they think of nothing but money and
fashion. Rank materialists all of them&mdash;from old Peter B., the
founder of the family and the builder of that brownstone
horror&mdash;to his children, Rufus and his brother and
sister&mdash;and his grandchildren, the present younger generation.
No doubt his great-grandchildren will be the worst of all! That's
what the century of greatest commercial and scientific progress in
the world's history did for us!" Mr. Pepperill paused and shook his
cane so that a passing errand boy ducked involuntarily. "I know
what I'm talking about because I was bom in it like the elder
Kaynes&mdash;although, thank God! I trust I'm not like them! It
gave us porcelain plumbing, but it stifled the spiritual sense in
most people. Too much comfort! Too much prosperity! No ideals!"</p>

<p>They had reached Forty-second Street and their innocent attempt
to cross had been abruptly prevented by a genial if patronizing
policeman.</p>

<p>"Don't try it, boys!" he cautioned them. "Step back there! Take
your time!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill, ruffled, returned protestingly to the curb. There
was no respect left for anything!</p>

<p>"The Bible says," remarked Maitland, "that the Lord visits the
sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
generation. Perhaps God, through the war, visited the sin of
materialism upon all mankind?"</p>

<p>"A very apt analogy!" agreed Mr. Pepperill. "And the same thing
has happened throughout all history from Babylon to Berlin. Look at
the children of Israel when they worshipped the golden calf! Look
at Rome!"</p>

<p>"Only this time the penalty was fifteen milli on lives!" thought
the younger man.</p>

<p>"All right! Now ye can go!" announced the policeman, and the
crowd burst over the curb, carrying Mr. Pepperill and his young
partner along with it like logs upon the crest of a tidal wave.</p>

<p>The latter took his friend's arm affectionately. He had a great
admiration for his ability and a keen regard for his wisdom. But it
occurred to him as he guided the old man's steps to the opposite
sidewalk that perhaps Mr. Pepperill's vision was slightly
astigmatic. Was he able to see himself as he was? He was quite
ready to pull the mote out of Kayne's eye&mdash;but wasn't there a
beam in his own? Was he really any less of a materialist than the
other?</p>

<p>To Maitland there was something terrible in the perfection with
which the old lawyer handled all his earthly affairs, and the
importance with which he invested them. His briefs were conclusive,
his business was transacted with precision, his bachelor residence
perfectly appointed, the attiring of his person attended to by a
skilful valet. An English housekeeper saw that he was well served.
A gentleman of the old school; a stickler for convention; something
of a snob; a firm believer in tradition, inheritance, and the value
of money; but a public-spirited citizen withal.</p>

<p>An old swell! who condescended to people like the Kaynes, but
who yet did not hesitate to handle their business or to participate
in their prosperity, upon which his own success&mdash;and that of
"Crutchfield &amp; Pepperill" as a firm&mdash;was in part based.
The dear old gentleman shared their profits, no less ill-gotten, if
ill-gotten, because he shared them; although the Kaynes and their
kind may have fairly assumed that if an aristocrat like Mr.
Pepperill took their money he, by a sort of king's touch, thereby
removed the taint. And in a sense he did. The Kaynes owed their
standing in a measure to Mr. Pepperill, just as they did to their
doctor, clergyman, caterer, tailor, dressmaker, and dentist. For a
part of what a client pays for is his lawyer's respectability. His
fee is the entrance due into good company; and many a rascal would
go to jail but for the gray hairs and suavity of the leader of the
bar beside him who so eloquently defends the scurvy trick by which
other clients of his may perchance have been robbed.</p>

<p>Weren't they in fact all a part of the same system&mdash;six of
one to the half-dozen of the other&mdash;"the pot calling the
kettle black"? As long as the Crutchfields and Pepperills would
shake them by the hand and cash their checks in return for letters
of "marque and reprisal," the Peter Kaynes would probably continue
to scuttle the ship of commerce and marry their granddaughters to
princes!</p>

<p>"And over there," nodded the lawyer toward a twin brownstone
mansion a few moments later, "is the James Kaynes's. They're very
philanthropic and tiresome! I don't personally attend to their
affairs&mdash;but I hear a great deal about them through my cousin
Mrs. Brice-Brewster, and then, to be sure, I go there
myself"&mdash;he coughed slightly&mdash;"occasionally. Typical
Victorians!"</p>

<p>He clutched his partner's arm as they came to a
dangerous-looking curb. "Confound it! Why don't they clean their
sidewalks&mdash;After all, the Kaynes are the result of a natural
social evolution. First generation, virile and
predatory&mdash;that's Peter B.&mdash;a caveman and adventurer but
a lovable old rascal at that; second generation, ultrarespectable,
selfish, snobbish, hypocritical&mdash;that's Rufus and his brother
and sister&mdash;what one might call the 'Brownstone
Bourgeoisie.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill's blue eyes twinkled as if he considered the
phrase he had coined distinctly good.</p>

<p>"Respectable to a degree! But without imagination! All gunning
for what the first generation didn't have, and had the sense not to
try for&mdash;social position. Bom in Brooklyn and ashamed of
it&mdash;because it's joked about in the musical shows. They forget
that most of our best New York fa mili es came from Brooklyn just
as most of the first families of Boston came from Salem&mdash;your
great-grandfather, for instance."</p>

<p>"Did he?" answered Maitland. "I'd quite forgotten it!"</p>

<p>"Of course he did!" snapped Mr. Pepperill, as he halted suddenly
on a crossing. "That rascal's not paying the slightest attention!
Why don't you look where you're going, sir?"</p>

<p>"And the third generation?" asked his companion as they reached
the other side.</p>

<p>The older lawyer gave a vague shrug.</p>

<p>"They don't look where they're going, either! I don't really
know what the world is coming to!" he ejaculated. "But the outcome
is not surprising. You see, the second generation&mdash;the Jameses
and the Rufuses and the rest&mdash;never woke up to the fact that
their game wasn't worth the candle. Whereas their children
did&mdash;in their cradles&mdash;and started out to make up for
lost time! At two hundred miles an hour&mdash;Wasters most of them!
No wonder they call this 'The Jazz Age'!"</p>

<p>"I won't quarrel with the term!" said Maitland. "But did these
Kaynes&mdash;I mean the generation represented by our client
Rufus&mdash;get what they were after?"</p>

<p>"Only in part!" answered Mr. Pepperill. "Only what they could
buy. They achieved a kind of social position&mdash;the newspaper
variety&mdash;but without any distinction. They're not really
'smart'&mdash;although their children are&mdash;if you know what I
mean."</p>

<p>Maitland nodded.</p>

<p>"I get you!" he replied. "How many Kayne children are there? And
what are they like?"</p>

<p>"Three girls," returned Mr. Pepperill. "Sheila, who's coming out
next week, just a little bundle of nerves, the helpless victim of
her environment; Claudia, whom you know about already; and
Diana&mdash;the eldest. They're a good example of what materialism
has brought us to! Talk about the sins of the fathers being visited
upon their children&mdash;you couldn't have a better illustration
of it than these Kaynes. Of course part of it is war reaction and
part of it is just kicking over the traces&mdash;a repudiation of
Victorian conventionality."</p>

<p>"Action and reaction are equal and opposite!" smiled
Maitland.</p>

<p>"But it's more than that," went on Mr. Pepperill. "The Kaynes
are running to seed. Moral shirt-sleeves to moral shirt-sleeves in
three generations. They're 'going bad,' as the saying is."</p>

<p>"Running to seed," were they? The words of the burial service
flashed through Maitland's mind: "That which thou sowest is not
quickened except it die." Perhaps there was more in the situation
than the old man thought. Not so simple! Some hope, at any
rate.</p>

<p>"But such people!" growled Mr. Pepperill. "If they didn't belong
to an infinitesimally small class I should think that America was
going to the devil, but they exert no influence and aren't of the
slightest importance!"</p>

<p>Maitland wondered. Were the Kaynes and their kind as unimportant
as Mr. Pepperill alleged? In spite of their small number were they
not typical of modern American tendencies? Was there not a writing
for all to read upon the brownstone facade of the Kayne mansion?
The Kaynes&mdash;America&mdash;the world! These jazzing boys and
girls, whirling and vibrating like water insects upon the surface
of a stagnant pool&mdash;what would they breed?</p>

<p>"How about the eldest girl?" he asked as they neared Madison
Square.</p>

<p>"Diana?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill raised his hands in simulated horror, thereby
dropping his precious cane.</p>

<p>"The wildest of all of them!" he exclaimed, while Maitland
picked it up. "Clever, reckless; talked about for years before she
came out; reported engaged every six months. Goes with an entirely
different crowd from her family&mdash;ever so much smarter
socially&mdash;a sort of inner-inner circle. And between ourselves
very likely a 'wrong 'un.' Before she gets through&mdash;mark my
words!&mdash;she'll be in twice the pickle her sister Claudia is in
already or her sister Sheila ever will be! She's really dangerous,
that girl! If you meet her, take my advice and give her plenty of
room."</p>

<p>"I hope we shall meet her!" murmured Maitland.</p>

<p>"We shan't!" returned his friend as the traffic stopped at the
red flash. "She never walks. She's much too expensive. You turn off
here, don't you? Forgive my chatter."</p>

<p>"We seem to have walked straight through the Victorian era!"
laughed the younger man.</p>

<p>"And thank Heaven for it!" ejaculated Mr. Pepperill.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," added Maitland hurriedly, "I'd like to get
away early Friday and skip Saturday altogether. Mr. Lawrence
Devereaux has asked me down for a couple of days' shooting at his
place&mdash;'Treasure Island,' I think they call it. I've nothing
pressing on hand except this matter of Lady Harrowdale's, and that
will probably take some time."</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill clucked with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my boy! Go and stay as long as you like. Larry
Devereaux is the right sort! Sends me a brace of pheasants every
year. Wish I were going with you. Well, good night, and good luck
to you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill with a nod and a smile over his dapper shoulder
continued to walk straight on down Fifth Avenue, while Maitland
swung across Madison Square in the direction of Irving Place, where
he lodged with the young Englishman, Nigel Craig, whom he had met
in Paris and induced to come to America with him. He had a great
affection for this gentle, almost girlish-looking lad, the youngest
of five brothers, the others all killed in action, himself so badly
gassed at Ypres that the doctors had at first given him up&mdash;a
colonel of infantry at twenty-four.</p>

<p>At that moment Craig was sitting before the grate in their
sitting-room staring with bent head into the fire. He was at the
end of his resources. That he could find no situation appropriate
to a man of his training in the great city of New York made him
desperate. Of course he could work with his hands on some farm in
Australia or Manitoba, but it seemed rather hard to throw away an
Oxford education. There was a writing-pad on his knee and a pencil
in the right hand that drooped, like the left, over the arm of the
chair. On the pad had been written in a schoolboy's hand the
following:</p>

<p>To Capt. Roy Kincardine,</p>

<p>Queens Own Huzzars, Aldershot.</p>

<p>Dear Kinky:</p>

<p>Thanks for your letter which reached me in Cologne about two
months ago. It is very jolly of you to offer to put me up but as
you see, I've pulled my stakes and gone to America. I can never
bring myself to live in England again. It would be different if I
had even a sister left. As it is I shall try to work out something
for myself over here. Just now I am sharing lodgings with Maitland,
the chap you saw with me in Coblenz. He's a great fellow! I wish
you knew him better. The weather here has been wonderfully clear
and sparkling, such as we had that winter we were at Chateau d'Oex.
It is not a bit like what we have at home. You must be getting a
lot of hunting. I should like to see England again, but&mdash;</p>

<p>The writing stopped here abruptly, for he had found he could no
longer see to write. Since his gassing the tears often came quite
unexpectedly. There was nothing the matter with him now, though,
except the fits of stupor that overcame him at intervals like some
deadly narcotic. But they did not last as long as at first and he
was physically feeling much more fit. Nigel Craig's mother had been
the acknowledged beauty of her generation in her part of England
and John Sargent's picture of her, famous as "The Girl with the
Gray Eyes" had been the talk of the hour at the Academy the year
she was presented. She had died shortly after receiving the news of
the death of her third son in the countersurprise at Bapaume. "I
should like to see England again, but&mdash;" No, he could not go
back!</p>

<p>Maitland walked around Gramercy Park, stopped in front of a
small brick house on Irving Place, unlatched the door, and
shouted:</p>

<p>"Oh, Nigel!"</p>

<p>A cheerful whistle answered him and he bounded upstairs, while
Craig arose quickly and stood with his back to the fire, forcing a
smile to his face as Maitland came in.</p>

<p>"Hello!" remarked the Englishman. "You must have been drawing a
will for Mr. Methuselah!"</p>

<p>Lloyd took his offered cigarette and borrowed a light.</p>

<p>"Any luck?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Craig shook his head grimly.</p>

<p>"Not yet. Nobody pressed me to go into partnership with him or
to show him how to spend his money, or to marry his daughter.
However, I'm not discouraged. If I can't find any other job I'll
pretend I'm Irish, get myself naturalized, and join the police
force."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll find something!" declared Lloyd. "Just hang on a bit
and luck will come your way."</p>

<p>"Right-o!" replied his friend. "'Are we down-hearted?' Something
tells me that to-morrow&mdash;or at very latest the day
after&mdash;a dark woman will come into my young life."</p>

<p>Lloyd spread his hands before the fire.</p>

<p>"It's just possible," he said casually, "that I can get you a
job that would take you to England&mdash;if you'd be willing to
go."</p>

<p>He explained Claudia Kayne's predicament, and how he purposed to
get her out of it. It was, he said, an undertaking for which Nigel
was in every way qualified. He knew England&mdash;perhaps he knew
Surrey?</p>

<p>Craig nodded. Into the gray eyes, which he alone of her sons had
inherited from his mother, came an eager look. He had been bom in
Surrey! By merely closing those eyes he could hear the evening
callings of the rooks above the grove back of the old, ivy-covered
stone house. The village boys would be playing football on the
common; there would be a smell of burning leaves; old Collomb, the
vicar, would be smoking his pipe standing by his gate, and from the
bams would come the sweet odor of cattle and the rhythmic sing-song
of the milk-pails, as the violet dusk came creeping from beneath
the trees.</p>

<p>He could imagine himself a little boy trudging homeward at
sunset over the dusty roadway, to find his mother waiting for him
at the wicket. Now the wicket was locked and fastened with wire and
the boys on the common were new boys who would stare curiously at
him as he went by. Only the gray-haired Collomb would recognize him
with a "Bless me, if it isn't Nigel! How are you, my dear fellow!
Yes, Mrs. Collomb is nicely, thank you," and then there would be
the awkward silence in which the mind of each walked over to the
deserted house, and like a ghost stalked through the silent rooms.
"Well, I must be going back to London!" "Oh, must you? Well, look
in on us again some day!" Could he endure it? And yet there stood
another ghost at his elbow whispering that if he didn't go now he
might never see any of it again.</p>

<p>"When do you want me to start?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Soon. Next week, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Nigel. "And"&mdash;he put out his
hand&mdash;"thank you a thousand times, old boy! You don't know
what this means to me! I say, hurry and wash. Let's go out and
forage for some chow and go to a bally show!"</p>

<p>Thus these two young men, who three months before had been
strangers to each other, now began to be drawn into the life of a
family no one of whom up to that day either of them had ever
met.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5. "The Corner Store"</h2>

<p>When Rufus Kayne left the law offices of Crutchfield &amp;
Pepperill, although he ordered his chauffeur to go up-town, it was
not with any intention of returning home. Except upon those
occasions when he spent an hour or so with his father, he avoided
his own house deliberately until forced to put in an appearance for
dinner. His habits were regular. Thrice each week he drove to
McMahon's Turkish Baths, and thrice he stopped his motor at the
junction of Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street and walked to "The
Corner Store," the dub his membership in which he most highly
prized. On this particular evening, owing, no doubt, to the
recrudescence of his daughter Claudia's misfortunes, he felt so
disgruntled that he drove there directly.</p>

<p>Few men go to more than one club, just as few dogs lie in more
than one corner. The club is man's last untaken fortress in the
onward rush of feminism; the husbands' union; the final rally for
independence of an old guard determined to die behind its
plate-glass intrenchments rather than surrender; the sanctuary
where its members can cast aside pretense and hypocrisy, speak
their minds without pother, and do as they choose within the limits
of the by-laws. Here all men are truly equal; less obviously in
their virtues than in their weaknesses; and here for a hundred and
fifty a year one may carp and growl to his heart's content, exhibit
all his natural idiosyncrasies, and cast aside all conversational
shackles without fear of protest or recrimination.</p>

<p>A dub never changes, but remains the sepulchre of the era in
which it was erected. Men do not go there to delight their souls,
but to forget that they have them. The tarnished tables, the
sagging chairs, the ancient hangings produce a pleasing sense of
permanence and continuity. The scent of tobacco smoke, decaying
leather, and dusty plush hovers like incense over the altar of the
past at which the ghosts of departed members officiate as priests.
Take away old Jones's chair from its corner? The mere suggestion is
a profanation. Did not he sit in it for thirty years? His shade
hovers about it still. Cantankerous, mean-minded, stingy,
foul-mouthed, but "a member in good standing." We abhorred him when
alive but we cherish fond memories of him now that he is gone. One
of our dead comrades. Good old Jones! Don't you remember the night
he got more than usually tight, wandered into the Turkish bath, and
fell into the swimming-tank? The recollection of that historic
incident warms the cockles of our hearts.</p>

<p>Thus by visiting the club we renew our innate conviction of male
superiority and gain an assurance of sex solidarity that makes us
loth to see its physical aspect altered in any particular. We want
the old cave left just as it always has been, smoky, smelly, dirty
doubtless, but a refuge protected from she-wolves and tigresses,
where we can crawl away to be by ourselves and eventually die
without female interference. So outwardly a dub does not change;
and since protective coloring is the wise order of a beneficent
nature, the general tone and character of its membership remains
the same, until in time by a natural process of dissolution it
ceases to be a club at all and becomes a fashionable dressmaking
establishment or second-class restaurant.</p>

<p>Whenever Rufus Kayne's confidence in the actual value of his
success faltered&mdash;as, particularly of recent years, it
occasionally did&mdash;he had only to cross the marble threshold
into the genial atmosphere of "The Corner Store" to have that
confidence restored, to be hailed jovially by half a dozen of New
York's most successful men, and to share instantly the hearty,
good-natured optimism which permeates it. Your "Corner Boy" always
sings a prosperous song, even if he is rather noisy over it, like a
fat robin. He finds the world a jolly place to live in, and he
wants everybody to know it. How could it be otherwise when he is
making money? And his conversation is calculated to drive dull care
away although limited to such intellectualities as: "Did you see
where General Motors went to?"&mdash;"How's the new Rolls going?"
or "I've got a little fellow who lets me have it for seventy a
case." Chatting with these sleek men of affairs who played golf at
a hundred dollars a hole and bridge at ten cents a point, Kayne
could not but be reassured.</p>

<p>Having told his chauffeur to wait, he entered the club,
surrendered his coat and hat to a white-haired shabby man servant,
and walked up-stairs to the card-room. It was full and several men
who saw him in the doorway nodded. The library was empty, but from
the "chapel," where the local sacraments were being incidentally
administered despite the constitutional amendment, came a sound of
revelry. "Uncle Jerry" Plumley was having a birthday-party and
unlimited champagne was flowing.</p>

<p>The old clubman who had been in a state of saturation for fifty
years was now swaying unsteadily beside the bar drinking with all
comers at his own expense, and he hailed Kayne by his first name
like a lost son.</p>

<p>"Hello, Ruf', old man. 'S my birthday&mdash;I'm seventy. Yes,
I've beaten the doctors! They'd 'a' buried me twenty years ago. But
there's life in the old dog yet. 'Nuther bottle, Sam."</p>

<p>The crowd in the little room surged toward the temporary
barkeeper, who obediently produced another bottle from Uncle
Jerry's apparently unfailing cruse and filled the row of glasses.
To Kayne there was something horrible in the aspect of this
bleary-eyed old man who, having reached life's allotted span, could
honor his gray hairs in no better way than by getting drunk.</p>

<p>"Well, good luck to you, Uncle Jerry! May you live long and
prosper!" he said and raised his glass with a forced smile.</p>

<p>There was a cheer from the others.</p>

<p>"Here's to Uncle Jerry&mdash;luck! Many happy returns! Good old
boy! Dear old Jerry!"</p>

<p>Uncle Jerry, clinging with one hand to the bar, raised his
glass.</p>

<p>"Boys!" he announced with dr unk en solemnity. "You
know&mdash;hup!&mdash;I love you all! Each and every one! I'm an
old, old man an' I've done nothing but drink all my
life&mdash;hup!&mdash;but I've done that pretty well."</p>

<p>He looked around for confirmation.</p>

<p>"I've not done a damn thing 'cept drink, but I'm seventy years
old an' I've&mdash;hup!&mdash;enjoyed every minute of it. Now I'm
goin' to tell you somethin'. Any man who doesn't have a good time
while he can&mdash;hup!&mdash;he's a fool! Tha's worth
knowing!"</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Kayne, putting his arm around the old
man and urging him gently toward the door. "And you've had an
exceptionally good time. No one can deny that!"</p>

<p>"In which case," cried Uncle Jerry, wheeling suddenly, "let's
have another! Who knows where we'll all be this time next year?</p>

<p class="poem">"'One little dog!<br>
And another little dog!<br>
Sat on a piec-e of char-coal!'"</p>

<p>Kayne backed across the threshold. He had had enough of this
ribald old Noah. On the stairs he ran into Darcy, a golfing banker,
revered by him as moving in circles smarter than his own.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Darcy as he passed. "I understand the immortal
Jeremiah has a load on. What's the matter? You look off your
peck!"</p>

<p>"Makes me sick!" answered Kayne with a frown. "An old man like
that!"</p>

<p>"It is rather raw," agreed Darcy. He paused, one foot on the top
stair. "By the way, I'm motoring your daughter down to Devereaux's
with me to-morrow morning&mdash;for the week-end. The birds are
coming in strong. He wires me the ponds are black with 'em!"</p>

<p>"I hadn't heard anything about it," replied Kayne. "She never
tells me anything. Who else is to be there?"</p>

<p>"Nobody but Longwood and some young chap Larry picked up
abroad&mdash;Maitland, I think the name is."</p>

<p>"Fellow in Pepperill's office?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Please remember me to my daughter," remarked Rufus
ironically.</p>

<p>Down the stairs floated a straggling chorus.</p>

<p>"One little dog! And another little dog!"</p>

<p>He turned into the deserted library and sank into a seat on the
Fifth Avenue side. Purple lights gleamed through the park, each
surrounded by a reflected nimbus from the russet leaves which now
and again fluttered to the earth like dying moths.</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette. So Diana was on the loose again! Why the
devil didn't she marry Devereaux and be done with it? This going
off alone with men would get her talked about more than ever. A lot
she cared. Nobody'd ever been able to do anything with her. Yet he
was conscious of a secret pride that his daughter should be a real
high-flyer. If she actually married Devereaux! That would be a ten
strike for a Kayne! And that young Maitland must be a swell in
disguise. Foxy old Pepperill knew all about people and kept his
eyes open. He was glad he had been cordial to Maitland and invited
him to Sheila's dance. Dance?&mdash;he'd have him round to dinner!
Maybe if he were that sort he'd do for Sheila. He scowled into the
shadow and an old woman, whose feet were wrapped in bagging stuffed
with imperial to keep off chilblains, and who had been stealing
fire-wood from the dwelling in course of erection across the way,
wondered why a gentleman who was so obviously warm and well-fed
should be concerned about any thing.</p>

<p>Kayne did not even notice the bent figure as it crouched by
under its load of lath. Why, he asked himself, with a growing
irritation, hadn't he ever become a swell himself? Wasn't he as
much of a gentleman as Darcy? Yet Devereaux never asked him down to
Treasure Island, and never accepted their invitations to dinner.
Well, frankly, why should he? A lot of stodgy people with double
chins sitting around a table and cackling about nothing, and then
yawning surreptitiously until the butler passed the fizzy water,
and they could stagger to their feet and say with a smirk: "Thank
you so much, Mrs. Kayne! We have had such a delightful evening!"
Delightful evening! Bah! That was old stuff! He knew well enough
that big dinners were no longer in fashion, and that the smart
people had learned to do as they liked.</p>

<p>The old woman had shuffled off dreaming of tea and Yarmouth
bloater, and a young policeman swinging his club impatiently as he
waited on the curb for the pretty laundress who worked next door to
keep her evening tryst with him, cried for want of anything better
to say: "Beat it, grandma, before I run you in!"</p>

<p>Kayne screwed his cigarette into the ash-receiver. Damn it all,
what had he got out of it? What did being a successful man amount
to? The people who ate his dinners came to his house merely because
it gave them something to do. Dinner for dinner!</p>

<p>This business of bringing up a family&mdash;which his pious old
mother had taught him was such a sacred duty&mdash;was all
nonsense! What good was it? What satisfaction was there in having
children who were never at home from one week's end to another? As
for Elizabeth, his wife, she bored him so with her eternal talk
about bridge, dinners, and what Mrs. Brice-Brewster and her other
friends thought about this, that, and the other, that he dreaded an
evening with her. He'd rather live at a hotel&mdash;where at least
you could see what was going on. A great life!</p>

<p>With a grimace he banged the bell and lighted a fresh
cigarette.</p>

<p>"Order my motor!" he told the servant who came grudgingly from
the hall.</p>

<p>Slowly&mdash;almost feebly&mdash;Rufus Kayne went downstairs and
mechanically allowed the doorman to put on his coat.</p>

<p>Outside he paused with one foot on the running-board of the
limousine. Where should he go? Where could he find relief from
himself?</p>

<p>"Home!" he said at length.&mdash;"Hell!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6. Treasure Island</h2>

<p>"Deep Cove. You get out here, sir. End of the road."</p>

<p>The friendly conductor gave Maitland a hand with his bags as the
wabbly train ground to a stop in the darkness, and he dropped to
the platform by the light of a lantern held by a rat-faced young
fellow in oversized golf cap and trim gaiters, who touched his
forelock with a "This way, sir. Let me have your bags, sir. Gun,
sir?" in the clipped, snappy speech of the dependent aristocracy of
the British sporting class.</p>

<p>Lloyd confessed to having brought no gun and was conscious of a
certain alteration in the youth's demeanor, imagining that he now
detected in it a shade of condescension.</p>

<p>"Mr. Devereaux wished me to say he was sorry he couldn't come
across himself to meet you, but they were walking up the West
Heather this afternoon and wouldn't be in till late. You'll find it
a bit cold, sir, on the boat. So I brought you an overcoat."</p>

<p>The night was foggy and Maitland had to exercise care to prevent
slipping as he followed the lantern along a sandy stretch of road,
and out upon a long dock at the end of which glowed nebulously the
red and green lights of the waiting launch. He was aware of several
black forms moving along with them, and once a hand took him by the
arm and gently directed him aright, and these men, whoever they
were, murmured now and again to one another in subdued tones. A
chill wind from the sound tossed the mist in fantastic streams from
the lantern and bore with it the harsh smell of eel-grass and kelp
and the softer odors of the receding tide. From the unseen darkness
came the squeak of an occasional gull.</p>

<p>"Careful, sir!"</p>

<p>He was looking down into a lighted cockpit and upon several men
who with outstretched hands assisted him to descend. He experienced
surprise and a sort of elated embarrassment at his own importance.
A bell rang and the launch churned the water at her stem and moved
away, the lights of the station and upon the dock end receding
swiftly. The breeze bit his face and the waves slapped the sides
viciously.</p>

<p>"Better put on the overcoat, sir!"</p>

<p>He obeyed, and ascended to the deck.</p>

<p>"Will you have tea, sir? Or something to drink? It's all ready
below."</p>

<p>Maitland thanked the steward but declined. He was too interested
in what was going to happen to lose a moment. He knew that
"Treasure Island" lay but a few miles offshore, and the sturdy
launch was making the water fly at fifteen miles an hour. In twenty
minutes at most he would reach his destination&mdash;an island
owned in its entirety by a single individual, possessing over it so
far as was possible under our form of government feudal rights
directly inherited from colonial days, when it had been ceded to
his ancestors as a manorial grant by the royal charter of King
James.</p>

<p>Not a gun had been fired upon its shores and uplands since 1635
save by the lord proprietor and his guests. Its coverts teemed with
pheasants and lesser game-birds; deer sprang from the bracken at
the approach of the stranger, and bounded away across the green
open and through the scrub-oak; while myriads of sea-fowl sought
passing haven on its salt coves and dime-protected marshes. A
huntsman's paradise!</p>

<p>Suddenly a faint glow appeared above the distant pines. The moon
was coming up. Ahead unexpectedly loomed the black outline of the
island, with its ghostly white dunes. The breeze dropped, cut off
by some unseen headland, and the launch slipped silently ahead
preceded by a ripple that spread wide like two great wings on
either side beating the shore. The bell rang again. Then twice! A
faint halloo! A light&mdash;several lights&mdash;shone bright among
the trees, and from the land came the sweet smell of wood smoke. A
rope was thrown, there was a scramble of dark forms, and the
visitor was led up a narrow gang-plank, at the top of which a lean
man in shooting togs received him&mdash;the head keeper.</p>

<p>"Mr. Devereaux is at the house, sir."</p>

<p>A mannish redolence of leather, pipe-tobacco, gunpowder, and
dogs floated on the mist. A setter, curveting, got between
Maitland's legs and nearly upset him, and another leaped up and
kissed his neck. "Down Petain! Down Foch! What luck on the High
Ground? Forty-eight? Not bad that! Rest 'em to-morrow, I suppose.
That bitch has something the matter with her ear. Mr. Blythe isn't
cornin'&mdash;I brought the telegram&mdash;Good night, captain!
Goodnight!"</p>

<p>Maitland strode quickly toward the lights. This was really
jolly! The smell of smoke grew stronger, now mingled with that of
cooking. The path brought him to a white wicket gate and to
irregular flags leading through an old-fashioned garden redolent of
pungent herbs and dying bloom. Just ahead of him the manor-house
rose against a grove of oaks, its open door pouring forth a yellow
welcome across the mist-silvered hedges beside him. He climbed up a
steep flight of wooden steps to a veranda.</p>

<p>Through the doorway he could look into a narrow hall and thence
into a wide, low-studded, homelike room, furnished with
chintz-covered lounging-chairs, where a fire crackled in an immense
fireplace. Through the door drifted a haze of cigarette smoke and
echoed the sporadic click of cards. He allowed a servant to help
him off with his coat, tossed his cap onto a table littered with
miscellaneous garments, and stepped to the threshold of the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>At one end of the mantel stood Devereaux, ruddy and smiling, and
beside him with her back to the door a girl in a Norfolk jacket of
rough tweed, khaki breeches, and leather gaiters. A lamp beyond
shone redly through her hair and outlined a supple figure a shade
above middle height. Their two heads were close together, the girl
engaged in filling from a silver receptacle in her right hand a
glass held by her host. This accomplished, she raised her face to
his with a laughing remark and he bent quickly over and kissed her.
From the back of the room a man's voice drawled:</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Larry!"</p>

<p>Across her shoulder Devereaux's eyes caught Maitland's figure in
the doorway and he called out, apparently in nowise
embarrassed:</p>

<p>"Caught, eh! Hallo, there, old boy! Welcome to our ancestral
shades! We only got in a moment ago or I'd have been on the
dock."</p>

<p>He placed the cocktail on the mantelpiece and gripped his
guest's hand heartily. Then he turned to the girl, who still held
the shaker.</p>

<p>"Lloyd, let me present you to Miss Kayne. Di&mdash;this is my
friend&mdash;Colonel Maitland."</p>

<p>Lloyd could hardly conceal his surprise at the girl's presence.
He had had no idea that his host was entertaining ladies, or that
he even knew this one who had happened to be the subject of Mr.
Pepperill's diatribe the afternoon before. And Diana, because all
men stimulated her, and especially on account of what Larry had
told her of this one, returned his gaze with interest.</p>

<p>She was used to the hunting type, rangy men tall enough to allow
their clothes to hang well, and the newcomer qualified as to
height. But his clothes did not hang on him well at all, and
apparently he had none of the graces of the courtier, for his
steady brown eyes seemed to Diana to be taking her all in rather
critically and rather disapprovingly. "He's heard something about
me!" flashed through her mind. "And of course he thinks it's true.
Well&mdash;let him!" She could not account for the fact that she
should care, but Lloyd was instantly conscious that she did. He had
never seen a face like hers. It rose from her slightly drooping
shoulders, on the swathed neck of her heavy, brown worsted sweater
like a white jungle flower shot with scarlet, and it seemed to him
as if some subtle odor, also like that of a mysterious flower,
emanated from her and drew him to her against his will. Yet she had
done nothing, said nothing. He had merely passed into the sphere of
her gravitational influence and felt the slight pull which might or
might not set him whirling round her, depending upon the strength
of her desire or his self-control.</p>

<p>In the stirring of his blood was mingled another and more
spiritual constituent&mdash;of pity, almost approaching
pain&mdash;that she should not be everything that her beauty
symbolized. He knew that she was not and the knowledge hurt him.
She was far too sensuous with her almond eyes, her complexion of
creamy alabaster, her high cheek-bones, her pouting, half-sullen
mouth, and that great mass of bronze-red hair looped across her
wide, low forehead.</p>

<p>"Why does Larry have such a girl around!" he asked himself.</p>

<p>Then the girl smiled and his question was answered.</p>

<p>"How are you?" she said in a husky voice, strangely like a
man's. "Have a drink? It's a great life if you don't weaken!"</p>

<p>"Thanks!" answered Lloyd as she filled his glass. "But I'll not
weaken!" he added to himself. His impulse to refer to her sister
Claudia he restrained. He was not there in the capacity of family
lawyer.</p>

<p>"What's doin' over there?" called the same voice that had
challenged Devereaux's salute. "Aren't we in on this?"</p>

<p>"Of course you are! Come to the Pierian spring!" retorted the
girl. "I'm playing no favorites!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" sighed Devereaux. "Here, you chaps, I want you to know
my friend Maitland. This is 'Bud' Longwood&mdash;he makes a living
knocking ivory balls around with a mallet&mdash;and, of course, you
know Dick Darcy."</p>

<p>Maitland recognized the names of a celebrated polo back and a no
less famous golfer who in his idle moments played at banking.
Longwood was a big, curly-headed, forthright chap who apparently
sought to relieve himself from all intellectual responsibility by
pretending to an almost infantile simplicity of mind, which,
however, frequently disclosed a considerable insight into men and
affairs, his constant introductory phrase being: "Oh, I haven't any
brains! All I know about is horses and not much about them, but it
seems to me&mdash;" He sat loosely, his legs wide apart and
sprawling, his head thrown back with his arms behind it and his
shirt-collar generally open. He spoke habitually in a loud,
resonant voice without varying the pitch.</p>

<p>Darcy, too, struck Maitland as far from a lightweight, for while
this bronzed veteran of sport carried hims elf with a jaunty,
almost rakish, air, his bronzed cheeks were heavily lined, and his
faded eyes were shrewdly appraising.</p>

<p>Both greeted Lloyd warmly. Then Devereaux drove them all
up-stairs and, with his arm linked through his new guest's,
conducted him to his room and showed him its cabinet of colonial
costumes, pointing out those which particular ancestors had worn,
the sampler worked by his great-great-grandmother, the
duelling-pistols over the fireplace, and the whereabouts of the
whiskey decanter and cigarettes.</p>

<p>"My room is directly across the landing opposite, old man! If
you want anything, shout for it! You've got forty minutes before
dinner. Jolly glad to have you down here!"</p>

<p>He clapped his guest on the shoulder and closed the door behind
him.</p>

<p>Devereaux's valet was already unpacking Lloyd's bags.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said. "The gentlemen almost always dress for
dinner&mdash;particularly when Miss Kayne is here."</p>

<p>For some unknown reason his words filled Maitland with an
unjustifiable sense of personal injury.</p>

<p>When an hour later Miss Kayne appeared on the threshold of the
drawing-room she seemed altogether a different person. The touch of
the bizarre and the daring was gone with the breeches and gaiters,
the sweater and the disarray of her hair, which now was wound like
a heavy crown about her head. Over her forehead she had pinned in
it a tiny crescent of diamonds. Exotic before, she was exquisite
now. Devereaux stepped forward, but, instead of offering her his
arm as he might have done, threw it about her&mdash;somewhat
ostentatiously it seemed to his guest&mdash;and drew her thus into
the room.</p>

<p>"Don't get up, boys!" she protested as they arose. "Larry, why
so affectionate? Your friend isn't used to our playful little
ways!"</p>

<p>"He must concede me my feudal prerogatives!" retorted the lord
of the manor. "And&mdash;I insist upon them all!"</p>

<p>Miss Kayne lit a cigarette and gave a little sigh of
contentment. Apparently although she had been carrying a gun all
day, she felt no fatigue and remained standing in front of the
fire, perhaps consciously adding a note of completeness to the
picture of luxurious comfort presented by the smouldering five-foot
logs, the oil-paintings of rosy old boys in lace and wigs, and of
pallid ladies with the bottle shoulders and narrow satin bodices of
the seventeenth century. There were hanging there, although
Maitland did not know it, Van Dycks, Copleys, and Stuarts, and the
firelight played carelessly on armchairs, cabinets, and gate-leg
tables brought overseas together with the very bricks of which the
manor-house was built, nearly three hundred years before, and now
worth at any dealer's sale ten times their weight in silver.</p>

<p>The butler announced dinner, and Devereaux with Diana led the
way down the hall to a low, oak-panelled dining-room with leaded
casement windows where snapped another open fire, beneath a mantel
crowded with trophies of silver and pewter. Here and there a
hunting print, a pair of antlers, or a cub's head broke the wall's
monotony, but what gave the room its cheeriest aspect was the broad
seats of red leather in the embrasures of the windows and the red
chairs ranged about the table.</p>

<p>Devereaux seated Diana with some ceremony upon his right and
then waved Lloyd into the place opposite her, while Darcy took the
chair at the other end seemingly as a matter of course, and
Longwood sprawled beside Lloyd, lifting one of the silver candles
from its socket to light his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Some of the old Irroy, Wilmot," whispered Devereaux to the
butler in an aside, and when the latter had filled the glasses he
arose and said:</p>

<p>"Beautiful lady and gallant gentlemen! I have a toast to
propose. To our latest arrival, our friend Lloyd Maitland!"</p>

<p>"Hear! Hear!" cried Diana, and they turned to Lloyd and drank.
Clearly they knew all about him, the story of his rescue of
Devereaux in the Argonne when the latter's plane had fallen between
the lines.</p>

<p>"Now you're a full-fledged member," Diana confidentially assured
him. "Larry has to be awfully soft on anybody to make a speech.
Nothing else could induce him to stagger to his little feet."</p>

<p>"He saved my worthless life!" cut in Devereaux. "If it weren't
for his childish modesty I'd tell you all about it."</p>

<p>"Then we're all equally in his debt!" declared Diana. "We
couldn't get on without Larry, you know, Colonel Maitland! When he
dies we're going to have him stuffed!"</p>

<p>There followed a moment of slight self-consciousness; then
Longwood, imitating Larry's manner, cried out grandiloquently:</p>

<p>"Beautiful lady and gallant gentlemen! I'll give you a toast! To
our last drink&mdash;it saved my life! Let's have another!" And he
held out his glass to the sedate man servant, who at a gesture from
Devereaux placed the bottle beside the polo-player's plate.</p>

<p>Darcy was obviously bored. "D'y'see that pheasant of yours tower
this afternoon, Larry?" he asked. "It went up so high it must have
come down some'eres off Montauk. Di wiped my eye badly on the
knoll. Damn bird corkscrewed like a snipe. Forty-eight in all,
wasn't it? That's better than we did last year!"</p>

<p>"By six," answered their host. "Am I right, Di?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>"But then we got seventy-one on the West Upland. And
ninety-seven brace on the Big Drive. What a day!"</p>

<p>"We must show Lloyd what we can do! Fergus says there never have
been so many birds."</p>

<p>Devereaux turned and laid his hand on Maitland's sleeve.</p>

<p>"Honestly, old man! you don't know how glad I am to have you
here."</p>

<p>Lloyd patted his friend's hand.</p>

<p>"And I to be here! I didn't know there was anything like this in
America&mdash;or anywhere else, for that matter."</p>

<p>He was warm with wine; thrilled with a strange excitement, like
a neophyte newly admitted to some esoteric order. It was not his
life&mdash;he could be at best only a non-resident member, but he
saw that whatever its faults it was virile, chivalrous, and without
pretense, and he felt for these comparative strangers a sense of
comradeship akin to that which he had had for his own men at the
front.</p>

<p>He saw, too, that these men had achieved a perfection in their
undertakings which marked them as of genuine intelligence and moral
quality, whatever the cosmic value of those undertakings may have
been. And he felt the glamour of being behind the scenes and the
fascination of a life where as a matter of course one knew
everybody one wanted to know, from statesmen and generals to
actresses and royalty. Devereaux was indeed a "lord proprietor." To
know him and his friends was to be one of those who secretly pull
the strings to which the world dances.</p>

<p>Darcy had got up and was standing before the fire. The
candle-light brought out the shadows beneath his eyes and the lines
about his deeply carven chin.</p>

<p>"Democracy?" he growled. "If the war proved anything it was the
absolute failure of democracy. The next radical is going to be the
man who has the courage to come out frankly and say so and to
advocate a benevolent autocracy!"</p>

<p>"In that case I nominate Larry for the job!" Longwood
emphatically declared.</p>

<p>The girl opposite Maitland lifted her eyes and smiled
cryptically. He seemed to read in their dreamy glance a challenge,
as if she were thinking: "Say what you like! Let dynasties,
philosophies, and religions fall. I alone remain. I rule the
world."</p>

<p>She had pushed back her chair and, as she sat with her hands
clasped in her lap, the candle-light glowed upon the white softness
of her shoulders and the white roundness of her arms, upon the odd
spread of her cheekbones that gave her that foreign look, and upon
the scornful curve of her mouth.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware of the fact that he desired this woman
as he had never desired anything in his life before, that he wanted
to lean across the table and seize those drooping shoulders in his
arms and press those red lips to his own, just as Devereaux had
done. This desire grew upon him until it became quite obvious to
that highly trained observer, Mr. Wilmot, who from his superior
point of vantage had observed many men under similar conditions for
several generations in the best society of both England and
America. Indeed, when he went out to the pantry to fetch the brandy
he remarked confidently to Fergus McLeod, the half-decrepit and now
practically retired "head keeper emeritus," who was waiting to get
the orders for the next day's shooting: "Fergus, that Colonel
Maitland 'as fallen flat for Lady Di. 'E's got it bad, 'e 'as. I
know that look. An' she's not averse to 'im, either, to my way of
thinkin'."</p>

<p>To which Fergus replied laconically, if prophetically:</p>

<p>"Then there be 'ell to pay, Mr. Wilmot."</p>

<p>Something&mdash;the wine, perhaps&mdash;had slightly suffused
Maitland's eyes. He heard Longwood getting off some silly crack
about "low highbrows" and "high lowbrows," and Darcy barking about
things political&mdash;and they annoyed him, for across the candles
he could scent haunting perfumes of the East, and hear above the
beating of the blood in his forehead the chiming of temple
bells.</p>

<p>Larry had taken down from the mantel an ornately chased
communion chalice purloined doubtless in the middle ages&mdash;"The
Augsburg Cup"&mdash;and with a strained expression was scribbling
upon a pad.</p>

<p>"It's bedtime," he remarked with an effort noticeable to none
but Wilmot. "We're to be called early to-morrow."</p>

<p>He tore off four slips from the pad and dropped them into the
cup.</p>

<p>"Fergus says'the wind's come up, with a dash of rain from the
northeast. That will bring the birds in. We'll shoot the Salt
Marsh, the Lagoon, Pirate's Cove, and the Tam. I'll take the Marsh.
You draw for the others."</p>

<p>He pushed the cup toward Diana, who negligently withdrew the
nearest slip.</p>

<p>"The Tam," she said.</p>

<p>Darcy and Longwood drew together, and Maitland after them.</p>

<p>"I've pulled the Cove," announced Longwood.</p>

<p>"Mine's the Lagoon," added the golfer. Only one slip
remained.</p>

<p>"That means you shoot with Miss Kayne," said Devereaux. "And now
how about a gun for you?"</p>

<p>They drifted into the dimly lit hall, one side of which was
filled with a great sliding panel of glass. Behind it were ranged a
dozen or so guns of all sizes.</p>

<p>"Let him try the Nichols you gave the rector," suggested
Longwood. "It's got just the right spread!"</p>

<p>"No," answered Devereaux, as he took down an elaborately chased
weapon. "I'm going to give him mine. All that I have is his!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Aren't you going out?" demanded Darcy.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'd like to see what he can do with it. Besides, I may
change my mind and try to walk up some of those odd birds that got
away from us yesterday&mdash;Candles, everybody? How about a 'wee
doc and doris'? Well, good night. Look out for her, Maitland. Don't
let her take your birds!"</p>

<p>He stood at the foot of the stairs holding his candle for them,
debonair, valiant; staring after the slowly ascending shadows.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7. The Tarn</h2>

<p>"Time to get up, sir!"</p>

<p>A hand grasping Maitland's ankle awoke him with a start to a
world softly flooded with lamplight.</p>

<p>"It's four o'clock, sir. The other gentlemen have been up some
time."</p>

<p>For a moment he could not recollect why it was that they were
all getting up at that hour, and then the peculiar habits of the
duck recurred to him. Down-stairs he could hear feet coming and
going, an occasional muffled bark, and the murmur of voices in the
diningroom. A friendly aroma of coffee came from the stairway.</p>

<p>"I hope I'm not late!" he thought as he hurried into his
clothes, apprehension gripping him by the throat lest by a few
moments' delay he should lose something.</p>

<p>They had nearly finished breakfast when he entered, including
Diana, but Devereaux insisted on sending out for fresh coffee.</p>

<p>"You'll find it bitter cold in the blinds," he said. "You'd
better stoke your engine well before you start."</p>

<p>Outside in the heavy mist loomed the shadows of keepers,
"duckmen," dogs, and boys carrying guns, ammunition boxes and
baskets, and stumbling over one another with politely uttered
imprecations. A ghostly line of wagons, a lantern suspended from
each rear axle, stood in waiting, and one by one each guest
clambered in beside the shrouded driver and pulled up his
buffalorobe, while an under-keeper shoved in the lunch-basket and
cartridge-box and scrambled up behind.</p>

<p>Maitland had gone to bed elated at the thought of having Diana
alone to himself the next day. But in the frosty air of the
four-o'clock reality he felt ill at ease. Silently they took their
seats in the last wagon. The driver clucked to his unseen horse and
they moved off into the darkness. The wind had dropped and thick
fog covered the earth with a motionless pall. Lloyd could see
nothing, save the gigantic shadows cast by the horses' legs
stalking among the bushes ahead of them.</p>

<p>"The Tam ought to be all right," said the girl in her hoarse,
fluty voice, which seemed startlingly close. "They'll be coming in
on the wind and take the first water they see. It's devilish cold!"
And she kicked her feet together.</p>

<p>It grew no warmer as they proceeded, first plunging through the
impenetrable blackness of the oak woods, and then emerging upon the
high ground where here and there through holes in the mist they
could see the stars. Presently they descended toward the shore. The
moon had gone down now, and again they lost the stars. The road
turned to sand in which the steel tires crunched against shells and
the desiccated skeletons of crabs.</p>

<p>Then without warning they stopped. A figure stood in the road
before them. The under-keeper was already removing the
lunch-basket. The figure beckoned, and climbing over the wheel they
followed him down the road, and thence along a path through high
grass to the beach. The lantern had been left behind. The darkness
was opaque. Alm ost, at their feet Lloyd could hear the lapping of
waves as grasping the guide's coat he felt his way to the blind.
Somewhere out in the night the decoys were quacking
sporadically.</p>

<p>"Here, miss!" whispered the duckman, parting the rushes of the
entrance, and Lloyd gave her a hand past him. He felt himself
standing on wood, surrounded by some invisible barrier. Behind him
was a seat made of a single board upon which the girl had already
taken her place. The under-keeper fumbling with the lock of the
cartridge-box shoved it between them.</p>

<p>"Anything you want, sir? I've left lunch with the duckman."</p>

<p>Then they were alone in their strange intimacy&mdash;Antony and
Cleopatra&mdash;within two inches of each other in darkness
appropriately Egyptian. He had an almost uncontrollable impulse to
move his hand and touch her, if only to see if she were really
there, but shyness restrained him. Once the board creaked as she
rearranged herself. He became drowsy. Presently the seat trembled
and he heard a sound as of metal screwed against metal, followed by
a liquid gurgling. The pungent odor of whiskey filled the blind.
His leg was pinched.</p>

<p>"Have a drink?"</p>

<p>He felt along her arm to her hand and guided it, still holding
the flask, to his mouth. Her fingers brushed his cheek almost in a
caress. The liquor permeated his being and restored his confidence.
A light breath stirred the reeds, and looking upward he discovered
that he could see the sky, in which the stars were now but paling
points. There was a difference in quality between the two horizons.
Shadows diffused themselves. Unexpectedly he perceived the reeds in
front of him and saw the mist like a luminous cloud of smoke
lifting about the blind. His eyes refused to focus in the unreality
of this phantom world. It was still dark, but silver;&mdash;dawn,
yet not dawn.</p>

<p>"Ssh-ssh! Ssh-ssh!"</p>

<p>It was the ghost of a sound like the echo of the faintest
hiss.</p>

<p>"Ssh-ssh! Ssh-ssh!"</p>

<p>Again his leg was pinched.</p>

<p>"One's coming!" breathed the girl. "He's yours!"</p>

<p>The whisper of wings grew loud and faster.</p>

<p>"Ready! Or you'll lose him!" she muttered.</p>

<p>Fifty yards away a gray spectre shot from left to right through
the mist and was gone.</p>

<p>"Quick!" she ordered. "He's turning! Now!"</p>

<p>But Lloyd's numb hands refused obedience, and before he could
bring his gun to his shoulder Diana had sprung to her feet and
fired&mdash;once. A heavy splash&mdash;a momentary
flapping&mdash;silence. The reek of powder hung all about them.
Lloyd turned slightly faint. The duckman, his outline now clearly
visible, waded slowly out and drew in the duck with a long net.
Then he vanished.</p>

<p>"May I borrow your flask?" asked Lloyd. Something in his voice
made her look at him.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Anything the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>She bent over and peered into his face, as she took out her
flask.</p>

<p>"Are you gun shy?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"It's the smell of the smoke," he answered.</p>

<p>In truth there had risen before his eyes the vision of other
misty mornings in the ravines of the Argonne.</p>

<p>"Were many of you like that?" she asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I can only speak for myself. I never went into a fight that I
wasn't scared sick. I don't like killing people."</p>

<p>Suddenly she bent over and drew him down.</p>

<p>"Steady. There they come&mdash;a squadron. Pull yourself
together!&mdash;Now, bore 'em!"</p>

<p>By noon they had killed nearly their limit. The sun had come out
bright and hot, and only an occasional bird answered the decoys to
fall an inevitable victim to the girl's closely choked left barrel.
They lunched among the scrub-oaks of the hillside behind them, on
cold pheasant, pimento sandwiches, claret and hot coffee, and then
lay among the leaves smoking their cigarettes and looking across
the silver mirror of the Tam fringed with the maroons and yellows
of autumn to the High Ground with its great patches of red and
russet&mdash;remote as if on a desert island.</p>

<p>Diana had cast aside her leather coat with its collar of gray
squirrel and was leaning back against a tree-trunk, her blouse
thrown open at the neck to catch such slight zephyrs as might be
stirring. In the unrelenting sunlight her neck and bosom were as
white as beneath the shaded candles of the manor-house. Stretched
at full length beside her with his arms behind his head, Maitland
felt again the witchery of her smile, the lure of her full lips.
Puritan that he was at heart he was ashamed of the wave of passion
that swept over him.</p>

<p>Diana herself was not unconscious of the effect that she
produced upon him. In his civilian clothes of the night before he
had not struck her as more than ordinarily good-looking; but now,
brown-red from the wind and the sun's glare, in the worn khaki
uniform that he had put on for a shooting-suit, with his eyes fixed
hungrily upon hers, she discovered that he was handsome. She liked
his wide, slow smile, his reticence which was coupled to a frank
warmth of heart and an almost naive enthusiasm quite foreign to her
own character. She would have liked to smooth back the curly brown
hair just where it ran into the peak in the middle of his forehead;
perhaps to give him a kiss. And she might have done so at that, had
he been some one else. But because it was Lloyd something prevented
her from doing so. He, even more, longed to rest his cheek against
her hand; to press his lips to its open palm. Then in the midst of
the riot his blood was making in his throat and ears he heard Mr.
Pepperill's crisp old voice.</p>

<p>"A wrong 'un! Give her plenty of room!"</p>

<p>He dug his fingers into the sod. Was that what she was? "A wrong
'un!" She looked it fast enough with her queer eyes and smouldering
hair. He had seen the evidence of it himself&mdash;the caress that
had passed between her and Devereaux! It was no idle jest to call
him "the lord of the manor." And he had boldly insisted upon all
"his privileges"! What were they? Ugly thoughts came crowding into
Maitland's brain. Had he saved Devereaux's life that the
capitalist-aviator might have this wonderful young creature for a
mistress? If so, he were better dead&mdash;and "stuffed"!</p>

<p>"Yonder's where they found Blackboard's treasure!"</p>

<p>Diana waved her cigarette lazily toward a distant cove. He did
not reply. He was not interested at that moment in treasure of gold
and silver.</p>

<p>"A great iron box," she went on, "full of moidores and pistoles,
and Spanish doubloons, and pieces of eight. The black cross marks
the place. It's a matter of court record. It was all delivered up
to the state authorities as treasure-trove."</p>

<p>The claret&mdash;or was it something else?&mdash;was making his
ears sing a little. Well, if she was Devereaux's, he'd let her see
that she couldn't deceive anybody.</p>

<p>"Not kept, then, as one of Larry's feudal perquisites?" he asked
significantly.</p>

<p>At his words a red tide swept upward from her throat to her
hair. Furious, she scrambled to her feet; he did the same, and they
stood motionless face to face. Diana clenched her fist and drew
back her arm. Another instant and she would have struck him in the
face. Then at the sight of his bloodless cheeks her hand slowly
lowered to her side. Something beyond herself restrained her. He
had insulted her&mdash;degraded her. And yet&mdash;! After all, as
she realized, she had given him full reason for his opinion of her.
The abjectness of his contrition touched her. He had bowed his head
and stood waiting for the blow. Her eyes softened. He raised his
face&mdash;drawn with regret.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she gasped. "How could you!"</p>

<p>Disregarding every tradition and habit of his life, he did what
he could have done to no other girl under like circumstances, he
gathered her in his arms and kissed her forehead&mdash;her
eyes&mdash;her mouth!</p>

<p>"Forgive me!" he cried. "Forgive me! I'm
sorry&mdash;sorry&mdash;sorry! Say that you forgive
me&mdash;Diana!"</p>

<p>She let him hold her&mdash;head thrown back, lips slightly
parted, eyes closed&mdash;for one heavenly moment.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;forgive&mdash;you!" she whispered.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8. "What Can We Do About
It?"</h2>

<p>The afternoon that Diana and Maitland had shot from the same
blind at Treasure Island, Mrs. Kayne, "stopping in" at the house
for a moment after lunch at the Croyon before hastening on for
bridge at Mrs. Brice-Brewster's, met her daughter Sheila
unexpectedly upon the stairs. The girl was coming down on the run
and the bizarre patch of artificial red in either cheek was
surrounded by a charming glow of natural color.</p>

<p>"Hello, Moms!" she cried, panting as she paused in her
descent.</p>

<p>Her mother, also slightly breathless, although from another
cause, regarded her disapprovingly.</p>

<p>"Where on earth are you going at such a rate, Sheila? I do wish
you'd be more dignified. What do you suppose the servants t hink of
your ramping around like that?"</p>

<p>She glanced down over the banister at the broad back and
tonsured head of Jarmon, the butler, who was looking out through
the Venetian lace of the front door. Mrs. Kayne spent much of her
time wondering what the servants thought, but, as she never found
out, she was not unduly disturbed.</p>

<p>"Bosh! Who cares what they think!" retorted Sheila. "It's good
exercise! I'm going to the movies&mdash;we've just time for the
second show."</p>

<p>"Who's <i>we?</i>" demanded her mother suspiciously.</p>

<p>"'Chubby' Jones."</p>

<p>"Are you two going alone?"</p>

<p>"Of course! Why not?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayne drew in the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>"Who is this 'Chubby' Jones, as you call him?"</p>

<p>Sheila rolled her eyes ceilingward and then dropped her lids
wearily, thus registering both astonishment at such ignorance and
disgust at parental interference.</p>

<p>"Friend of mine. I met him at a dance last week. He's horribly
nice. He's giving me quite a heavy rush."</p>

<p>"But who is he? Where does he come from?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" replied the girl blandly. "He must be all
right. He goes everywhere. Invited to all the smartest parties. And
he's got a Stutz."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayne uttered a sigh of pathetic protest. Such goings on
genuinely offended her idea of good taste, for she had difficulty
in bringing herself to believe that the right people really allowed
their children so much freedom.</p>

<p>"I don't like it! I won't have it!" she declared with a show of
firmness. "I can't let you go into those places and sit all the
afternoon in the dark with a strange boy!"</p>

<p>Sheila stamped her foot.</p>

<p>"He's not a strange boy!" she retorted. "You don't understand.
Everybody does it. All my friends go with 'Chubby'&mdash;and with
other boys. Please let me get by!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayne stared at her helplessly.</p>

<p>"I don't believe their mothers know about it!" she protested
vaguely. Sheila caught her up.</p>

<p>"Know about it? Of course they do! Ask Mrs. Brice-Brewster. She
knows. She lets Frances do it. Now, mother. Do let me by! Chubby is
out in the car, and he mightn't wait for me if I keep him too
long."</p>

<p>"What other girls that you know go to the movies with this Jones
boy?" continued her mother feebly, but still in the ring.</p>

<p>"Everybody. He's all the rage. Jennie Talmage, Rose Wynant, and
Priscilla Blair&mdash;all of them!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't approve of it at all. I wish you wouldn't. Just
to please&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, mother!" cried the girl, almost beside herself. "If I
didn't go with Chubby he'd think I was a dud. Don't you want me to
be popular? We have to do all sorts of things or the boys won't
dance with us. Going to the movies is nothing. Really, mother,
you're too old-fashioned! Please, mother, don't keep me any
longer!"</p>

<p>She spoke wildly, her lips quivering, her whole body a-tremble.
Mrs. Kayne was afraid the girl might have hysterics right there in
front of Jarmon. He had heard the whole conversation, anyway.</p>

<p>"Well, dear," she said soothingly, "if you're quite sure all the
other mothers&mdash;including Mrs. Brice-Brewster&mdash;let their
daughters do it, I suppose I mustn't object. But really&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sheila was already half-way down-stairs.</p>

<p>"I do wish you'd find out something about this Jones boy,"
finished her mother distressfully.</p>

<p>"I will!" Sheila tossed over her shoulder. "But why don't you
look in the Social Register?"</p>

<p>Sheila took the three bottom steps at a leap, almost knocking
down Jarmon, who was solemnly holding the front door open for her,
and caromed through it with a shrill cry.</p>

<p>"Coming, Chubby!"</p>

<p>The door closed behind her. Mrs. Kayne uttered a deep
suspiration largely for the effect on Jarmon and continued her
somewhat laborious ascent. She never used the elevator for one
flight&mdash;as a matter of principle.</p>

<p>It was part of her regimen adhered to rigorously, ever since she
had learned that the beautiful Mrs. Cyril Northrup&mdash;the one
who had visited Mrs. Absolom at Northampton the summer before
last&mdash;never used the elevator for one flight and took only an
orange for her lunch on Thursdays. But although Mrs. Kayne in
consequence had religiously eaten nothing at luncheon save a single
orange for upward of one hundred and twenty Thursdays, for some
peculiar reason the effect upon the two ladies was not the
same.</p>

<p>She had been the only daughter of Cephas Hargeth, a wealthy and
religious stockbroker of excellent social position&mdash;he later
was indicted by a runaway Federal Grand Jury for "bucketing," but
never tried&mdash;and it was commonly thought at the time that
young Kayne&mdash;then twenty-eight&mdash;had done very well by
himself in getting her to marry him. At any rate it had certainly
been a step in the right direction. And it had been immediately
followed by another, the purchase of the summer place at
Northampton to which all those who did not feel quite up to Newport
were then flocking.</p>

<p>Her one ambition was to be fashionable, and she gave her
daughters fashionable names&mdash;Diana, Claudia, Sheila. Had
Elizabeth Hargeth been a cleverer woman their ascent would have
been less deliberate, but although she had been a Tuxedo belle with
a marvellous complexion&mdash;which in spite of squirrel cheeks and
an oversharp nose had won her a reputation as "that pretty Lizzie
Hargeth"&mdash;she was remarkable for dulness in a generation which
made of dulness a religion. Since, however, it had even a greater
reverence for money they progressed rapidly enough.</p>

<p>As Kayne's financial importance grew and he became a popular
figure upon the local golf-links&mdash;it cost him several thousand
dollars to learn the game under proper auspices&mdash;the quality
of their dinner guests likewise improved until they really knew
everybody. By the end of ten years practically all Northampton was
dining at the Kaynes' and dining well. At the conclusion of another
like period Lizzie Hargeth, now a matron of forty-five, could look
down the rows of smoothly upholstered female bosoms and gleaming
shirt fronts at her mahogany and know that they belonged to the
best people not only on Long Island, but in New York City as
well&mdash;Newport or no Newport! Rufus even had his little joke
about what he called "the Pittsburgoisie."</p>

<p>As time went on, Mrs. Kayne, like many another of our best
ladies, realizing perhaps that the walls of society will not fall
down of their own accord, adopted, when away from her own fireside,
a slightly assertive and even aggressive manner, which entirely
belied her innately gentle and retiring nature. She had, in
reality, so little self-confidence that she was apt to decide most
questions by asking what other people were doing, and doing the
same. Thus it was quite enough for her if her friend Mrs.
Brice-Brewster&mdash;particularly since she was so closely related
to a man of Mr. Vincent Pepperill's position&mdash;approved of
whatever was under discussion, wholly irrespective of its nature,
and whether material or spiritual.</p>

<p>She was by no means a fool, but although she might have improved
her mind after graduating from school, she had allowed it to lie
fallow and she had so small an amount of imagination that, once
having achieved a satisfactory place in society, she had, so to
speak, dug herself in, rarely even taking the chance incident to
adding a new name to her list, and preserving her dinner cards and
using them over again year after year, with the result that as her
mind worked with regularity, her guests found themselves inevitably
in the same general company and usually between the same table
companions as when last invited. She was placid, nerveless, kindly,
her favorite color was terra-cotta, and she was passionately fond
of emeralds.</p>

<p>Yet, when all is said, under the crust of pretense and
conventionality the heart of this simple and well-meaning woman
yearned deeply to her children and was often tom by her inability
to understand them.</p>

<p>She loved her husband, without romance and without passion,
believing him to be the best and truest of men, ignorant that she
bored him or that her cackling laugh drove him nearly frantic. Yet
after the first three months of married life she had ceased to make
any effort to render herself personally attractive to him, assuming
that having consented to be his wife all that it was necessary for
her to do to keep alive his interest was to eat her meals in his
company and occupy an adjoining bed chamber.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayne was surprised at many of the things which she
understood were done by the younger people in society or just
entering it. But as her ambitions for her children were exactly
what her own had been, she was not so much worried by the things
themselves as by whether they were actually being done. At first
when the new style of dancing made its appearance she had
vehemently objected to it, but presently fin ding herself in the
minority she speedily ran to cover and kept her peace. It may be
said in her defense that, since whatever is unmannerly, illegal, or
even criminal is supposed to derive its character in that respect
from the prevailing public opinion, if the majority of us are
willing to caper about naked to the beating of the tom-tom it
thereby becomes the proper thing and all one needs to do is to
count noses to learn, how to behave.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayne always counted noses and acted accordingly, and it is
to be suspected that sometimes, if the result was not precisely to
her satisfaction, she went back and counted them over again. After
all, it is not the number of noses that matters so much as to whom
they belong. Mrs. Kayne found ample precedent among the best people
for letting her children do exactly as they wished. They would do
it, anyway, she said, so, after all, what difference did it make?
It was reassuring to know that they were in good company.</p>

<p>Yet somewhere in the back of her mind lurked a feeling of
uneasiness&mdash;the ghost of the soul that has to live with
itself. She knew that she had never done things like that. And she
could not remember ever having defied her mother. But her own
children once out of her sight made no pretense of obedience, and
she had long since abandoned any real attempt to enforce it upon
them. To do so would have taken all her vitality, and, after all,
one must live one's own life a little of the time!</p>

<p>Actually her life was consecrated to bridge-whist, which, being
to a considerable degree a matter of rule, she had learned to play
fairly well at a cost but slightly exceeding that of her husband's
golf. Had she but realized it her interest in the game was largely
due to the fact that it was the only exercise her mind received, it
being led out, as it were, for a brisk canter round the track
afternoon and evening, and the rest of the time left munching in
the stall.</p>

<p>That was her life; luncheon with from seven to eleven other
women from one-thirty to three-thirty; and bridge from four to six,
which fitted in nicely with Rufus's engagements at the "Corner
Store" and the Turkish bath. In the evening she had, of course, her
regular social duties to perform in addition.</p>

<p>She had returned for her purse, a necessary adjunct to her game,
which she had forgotten, and having secured it she descended to the
front hall where the butler, now reinforced by a tall young footman
in white silk stockings, bowed her out with ceremony. Mrs. Kayne
was a great stickler for form and for many years had had a butler
who had scored heavily when first interviewed by inadvertently
addressing her as "My lady."</p>

<p>The young footman&mdash;Capper&mdash;who had served three years
in Flanders and wore a silver plate in his skull, from which he
suffered constant headache, adjusted the lace over the door,
turned, and busied himself with the coats upon the table, to hide
the fact that he was feeling very ill; for Mr. Jarmon was not a
sympathetic man. He was firmly persuaded that the young footman
drank.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayne, relieved of the momentary problem presented by
Sheila and young Mr. Jones, entered Mrs. Brice-Brewster's with a
tranquil mind. She and that lady were kindred spirits,
astonishingly alike in most particulars, as were the other six
ladies of fashion there assembled. Much of their pleasure in one
another's society lay in their knowing beforehand exactly what
everybody was going to say. There was none of the awkwardness
incident to the introduction of foreign topics such as politics and
literature, always possible&mdash;if improbable&mdash;in mixed
gatherings.</p>

<p>These good-natured ladies greatly enjoyed their tiny cushioned
corner of life and had a real affection for one another. Being so
much alike, it was only natural that they should somewhat
overeulogize one another's virtues, since by so doing each
emphasized her own. For this reason they rarely disagreed with
whoever spoke first, discussion being often annoying, generally
fatiguing, and always useless. They were, in fact, like a small
flock of fat pouter pigeons&mdash;punctiliously pecking at grain
and cooing with contentment.</p>

<p>Each, as soon as she had married, had settled down into a life
of indolence and become an old woman, passing at once from youth to
age. For in the Victorian era there was no middle period, and a
woman having assumed the bonds of holy matrimony became thereby
shackled to the rocking-chair. They had awakened from their
twenty-year postmarital dream to discover that, save for
themselves, there were no longer any old women, and, perceiving
with dismay that their husbands were still comparatively young,
they had hastened to rejuvenate themselves so far as decorum
permitted.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Brice-Brewster's set, however, where the sense of
propriety was strong, this did not go beyond a slight affectation
of light-mindedness, an occasional cocktail, and an attitude of
toleration toward conduct which a few years before they would
certainly have regarded as disgraceful. And none of them, although
they followed the fashion of short skirts, had gone so far as to
take up dancing.</p>

<p>It is not astonishing that their husbands found their
companionship tiresome and sought amusement away from home when
possible, that their children regarded them as relics of
mediaevalism and their servants as geese stuffed with
chestnuts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayne, already a few minutes late, hurried in, fluent with
apology, to find the company engrossed in discussing the very
subject last pressed upon her attention.</p>

<p>"We were just saying, Lizzie dear," said Mrs. Brice-Brewster,
"that there seems to be absolutely no way to control children
nowadays. They are simply running wild. Parents don't seem to have
the slightest influence any longer. Take the Mothers' and Fathers'
Guild, for example. We all joined it three years ago and we thought
we could do something by concerted action. But what happened? None
of the children would go to any of the plays the Guild recommended,
and in fact they all insisted on going to those it disapproved
of."</p>

<p>"What do you expect?" asked Mrs. Percival Ray, who had a
twenty-year-old daughter already divorced and hence adopted an
aggrieved attitude for the purpose of showing that it was not her
fault. "It's the whole world. The war has destroyed all our
ideals&mdash;everything!"</p>

<p>"I don't think the plays matter so much&mdash;they're bound to
see everything, anyway," said Mrs. Kayne.</p>

<p>"Exactly," agreed another lady. "I don't think the plays matter.
It's so hard to tell what they mean, anyway. One person will find a
play moral when another will think it immoral. And they get all the
same sort of thing in the papers. One can't keep one's children
from reading the papers, can one? One <i>wants</i> them to read
them."</p>

<p>"And novels!" added Mrs. Kayne. "They get it all in the
novels&mdash;even the very best. Take the 'Scarlet Letter,' for
instance, I mean the classic&mdash;by Hawthorne." She spoke as one
bowing&mdash;or having bowed&mdash;to the inevitable.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I'm told that last party at the Rumpels was a public
scandal," continued Mrs. Brice-Brewster. "In the first place, ever
so many boys came who hadn't been asked, and most of them brought
their flasks. Then they put the lights out and smashed half a dozen
mirrors and a lot of furniture; and after that they played
hide-and-seek all over the house. Mrs. Rumpel found two couples in
the cellar and several in the servants' bedrooms. And a lot of the
girls egg the boys on. I don't mean that any of ours do, but
daughters of people we know. I understand they say they don't get
any fun dancing with a man unless he has had something to
drink."</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do?" demanded a lady conspicuous
for her earrings, who was adroitly shuffling a new pack of cards by
means of her thumbs. "You can't keep a girl from going to the
dances. If you did she'd never know anybody. You can't keep her at
home and get her married."</p>

<p>"That's the whole trouble," answered Mrs. Brice-Brewster. "Of
course, the nice girls&mdash;ours&mdash;don't do these things, but
even they complain that unless they do the boys don't want to dance
with them. You really can't blame a girl for wanting to be popular.
Nobody wants to be a wall-flower."</p>

<p>"It's the parents' fault," alleged a stout lady in green
brocade, who happened to be childless. "They should exert a little
discipline. Girls like that, who don't behave themselves, ought to
be spanked."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" expostulated the lady who thought that the plays
didn't matter. "That would only make them worse. And
besides&mdash;I'm sure you don't really mean that!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!" returned the stout lady resolutely. "When I was a
girl I know what would have happened to me if I'd disobeyed my
mother!"</p>

<p>There was an embarrassed silence; all felt that the remark
savored of indelicacy. Then Mrs. Allison, one of Mrs. Kayne's
childhood friends, still domiciled in Tuxedo, said earnestly:</p>

<p>"Of course, I don't approve of much that goes on&mdash;not at
all! I wouldn't for the world have any of you suppose that I did.
But what I say is that I do want my children to have a good time
while they can. I'm sure I don't want them to go through what I did
when I was young. The world is a hard enough place to live in as it
is!"</p>

<p>There was a murmur of sympathy from all of the ladies in the
group, although none of them knew exactly to what Mrs. Allison
referred, it being generally supposed that she had always lived in
the lap of luxury. However, it was clear that the memory of
something unhappy in the past rankled in her breast and it awakened
in them a vague echo of response, based on their common juvenile
experience of doleful Sunday afternoons.</p>

<p>"Why, I think most of the young people are perfectly
well-meaning," said Mrs. Kayne. "After all, they are only trying to
have a good time. Some of them will always be a little wild, of
course&mdash;but that doesn't mean that there is anything wrong.
And I <i>want</i> them to have a good time!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Brice-Brewster rose and moved toward the bridge table, and
the others did the same.</p>

<p>"Well, shall we begin?" she asked, as she cut for partners.
Then, as Mrs. Kayne hovered near her, she turned with a smile and
said encouragingly:</p>

<p>"Well, it's nice to feel that <i>our</i> girls are all right,
isn't it, dear?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayne smiled affectionately at her friend.</p>

<p>"What do you think of all these movies?" she asked
confidentially. "Are you sure they're all right? For girls to go
alone to, with boys, I mean?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Brice-Brewster gave her a slightly puzzled glance.</p>

<p>"Why," she answered, "I had my doubts at first. But when Frances
told me that you let Sheila do it, I made no further objection. I
suppose it's all right. After all, they don't take what they see
seriously."</p>

<p>At that precise moment Sheila and her escort Mr. Chubby Jones
were sitting in the dark, side by side in two "divans" directly
behind another boy and girl in close embrace. The atmosphere was
heavy with nitrogen and cheap perfume, while from the neighboring
aisle came the stench of a dead cigar too precious to be
surrendered by its owner. On the screen a girl, her gown half tom
from her body, was struggling in the arms of a ruffian whose face
was distorted in a grin of sensual anticipation. The gown slipped
lower and lower as the pair rocked toward the neighboring
couch.</p>

<p>"Hot stuff!" sniggered the man of the world beside Sheila, who,
ignorant of the proper etiquette on such occasions, giggled
awkwardly in reply&mdash;then shivered as she felt his fingers
creep up under her sleeve and clasp her elbow. For an instant she
doubted her senses. The mouthing face upon the screen was gloating
at her in a close-up depicting "The untamable animal lurking in
every man." The fingers stroked her arm and she sickened, waves of
heat and cold chasing across her body. Feebly she tried to pull
herself away. But he did not relax his grasp. They always pretended
that they didn't like it at first.</p>

<p>Helpless&mdash;alone in this black prison&mdash;in a world
apparently dedicated to lust&mdash;with only ignorant girls as
ushers for protection&mdash;shri nking from the publicity incident
to an open resistance&mdash;wanting her mother but realizing that
she would not find her there if she went home&mdash;she submitted.
Writhing, she allowed his hand to fondle her, each instant feeling
more and more polluted until she could have screamed, her face and
bosom flaming with the consciousness that she had led him on, aping
a sophistication not really hers but designed to pique and arouse
his interest and trying to talk as she had heard Diana talk.</p>

<p>Doubtless he supposed that it was for just this that she had
come with him. Tears of shame and disgust scorched her eyes.</p>

<p>"Nice arm you've got, Sheila!" she heard him say.</p>

<p>After all, perhaps that is what the movies are for. Was not
"Onderdoncking," as it was then called, known in the earlier
Victorian era&mdash;even among high ecclesiastics?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9. Children of
Yesterday</h2>

<p>Diana, eldest of the three children of Rufus and Elizabeth
Kayne, unfortunate in her parentage, was fortunate at least in the
decade of her birth, and the fact that of them all she had
inherited most of her grandfather's vigor of body and intrepidity
of spirit.</p>

<p>Her girlhood had been passed during her mother's "On to
Newport!" period, when the Northampton house was filled with
"hen-parties" at both luncheon and dinner&mdash;bridge after
each&mdash;from Tuesday until Friday, and with aromatic golfers
over every week-end. Fortunately for her this was also the epoch of
the "athletic girl," so that being driven out of the house was
tantamount to being driven upon the tennis courts and links, which
in the "dull waste and middle" of the week were practically
deserted. Had not motors been still an innovation she might have
been driven onto Broadway. As it was, she scraped an acquaintance
with a beach-combing family of summer Brooklynites whose
harum-scarum existence would have shocked the society folk of
Northampton had they dreamed of it&mdash;and learned from a tomboy
girl and her two equally rowdy younger brothers to shoot snipe and
duck and to land striped bass through the surf.</p>

<p>Somewhat later, at the childis h age of fifteen, she had
suddenly appeared one day at the tennis dub and not only captured
the women's senior and junior singles before a crowded gallery, but
took away the day-pigeon trophy from one Mr. Richard Darcy who,
since he had already won it twice in succession, had confidently
expected it to become his permanent property. Sport may or may not
have saved her, but at least it made her a celebrity, and next
Sunday at "Treasure Island" Mr. Darcy sang the praises of the
"red-headed child-wonder" to his friend Mr. Lawrence Devereaux,
who, hastening to Northampton, became at once her slave.</p>

<p>But Diana was too interested in outdoor life to listen to
sentiment. "I can wait!" he had decided, and purchasing her
photograph from the art department of a magazine had hung it over
his shaving-mirror. He waited&mdash;without result, although his
devotion naturally won him Diana's friendship&mdash;nothing
more.</p>

<p>Kayne and his wife perceived too late for their own purposes
that the girl was a social asset, else they might have achieved
Newport through her. She had become "the thing" while her mother
was still wondering whom it was safe to invite to dinner. Poor
placid Mrs. Kayne looked on in helpless wonderment as Diana took a
single, graceful dive into the middle of the social pool, bobbed
up, shook the water from her eyes and vanished from the family
view. From that time on they regarded her with awe, envy, and
disapproval on such fleeting occasions as they were vouchsafed a
glimpse of her en route from the Everglades to Government House,
Ottawa, or from some Adirondack lodge to Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>Then broke the war and everything flattened out. She kissed
Larry Devereaux good-by in his aviator's uniform of the Lafayette
Escadrille, for a moment fancying herself in love with him. But her
circle was smashed and she plunged furiously into "war
work"&mdash;canteens, pageants, officers' clubs, "drives," and all
the rest of it&mdash;returning in the meantime to an echo of family
life which she found as tedious as ever. The silly female struggle
for notoriety&mdash;the unproductiveness of wasted
effort&mdash;disgusted her. In the scarce intervals of her
work&mdash;at first at odd times, but later on more
steadily&mdash;she began to read, amusing herself with politics and
philosophy, and for the first time discovered the world of
ideas.</p>

<p>The war ended leaving her flatter than ever. Then the component
parts of her smashed circle reassembled themselves and it began
spinning faster than before. And Diana, even more cynical, spun
with it&mdash;desperately now, for what had before been theory had
been demonstrated as fact. She knew that if men had to die they
could die singing&mdash;that drugged by a vision of glory they
would sacrifice themselves&mdash;but it was the heroism of fools or
hysterics. Civilization was only a cloak, a gossamer one at that.
Men liked to kill, to destroy. Life was a fierce
contest&mdash;waged under grandiloquent and high-sounding appeals
to "principle" for material ends. Men struggled among themselves
for money just as the beasts fought among themselves for
food&mdash;and the women battled for the men. Given the chance and
guaranteed against discovery there was no one who would not take
his price. Religion was a clever invention to keep miserable people
contented. You took away a man's life and told him he would get it
back again&mdash;by and by. There were no future rewards nor
punishments and everybody knew it. Sin, as she observed, was
frequently rewarded with earthly blessings, and in fact most of the
wicked that she knew flourished like the bay-tree.</p>

<p>Anything else was childish pretense, mere mockery. All there
was&mdash;and even that might be mere illusion&mdash;was the fresh
breeze blowing across the moors or the stinging spindrift "from the
rainbow round the bow," the taut humming line with a leaping salmon
at its end, the smell of wood smoke under the stars seen through
the pines, the stealing warmth of wine or the soft pressure of a
man's arm about one's waist.</p>

<p>The war had undeceived everybody who thought differently. That
was the real reason why people were letting their children have a
good time while they could&mdash;before they died, or became
crippled from disease, or lost their money, or married. Marriage! A
ghastly joke&mdash;resulting in jealousy, hatred, or insufferable
boredom! Not for her. Liberty was too sweet. Give her twenty more
years of vigor in which to enjoy what there was to enjoy! And then
let her die like a sportsman&mdash;asking and believing in nothing
more.</p>

<p>Claudia Kayne&mdash;Lady Harrowdale&mdash;had never been
formally introduced, but the social game had become an old story to
her by the time the innovations of "cheek-to-cheek" dancing and the
"shimmy" had added a momentary fillip to a war-denuded society. So
she had been ready and waiting for Captain Sir Percy Harrowdale
when his discriminating eye fell upon her at the dinner table of
Mrs. Brice-Brewster, to whom he had letters.</p>

<p>That stalwart social warrior, flattered at the thought of
entertaining an English officer who was also a baronet, perceived
at once what a wonderful match they would make. This probably also
occurred to others who saw them together, for Harrowdale, in his
smart evening uniform of dark blue, was a st riking figure and
Claudia, with her Burne-Jones face and hair, no less so.</p>

<p>Visionary child that she was&mdash;already bored with her
surroundings&mdash;she would have been an easy victim under any
circumstances, but Harrowdale's uniform and his air of
supercilious, almost arrogant, distinction so captured her
imagination that she could not conceal her infatuation.</p>

<p>Sheila, the little schoolgirl crouching on the landing and
peering through the banisters, watched the course of her sister's
romance with excited interest. She would have given a great deal to
marry a soldier, but the boys she knew had been too young to go to
the war, and when it was over she discovered to her infinite
disappointment that the real heroes were all busy looking for
jobs.</p>

<p>In one way the war had been of advantage to her and her
contemporaries, for it had somewhat delayed the period of their
social sophistication, yet this enforced repression had resulted in
an even greater exuberance when they got their chance. Sheila was
exactly sixteen at the time of the Armistice. The dam of restraint
had burst all over the civilized world and she had been carried
along in the swirling flood, while three of the four grim Horsemen
still galloped through the sky.</p>

<p>Diana, from her ten years' superiority, stigmatized Sheila and
her friends as a lot of little jackasses, but did not take their
antics seriously. While her own relations with men had always been
unconventional and easygoing, and while she was fully aware of the
attraction she excited, there was little of the flirt about her.
She would have resented a real liberty, as she would have resented
any other insult. The majority of the men she met made love to her,
but she took this as a matter of course and it left her cold. She
had passed through life untouched by any real emotion until her
encounter with Maitland the previous Saturday. Here was something
new altogether.</p>

<p>As she dressed for Sheila's ball she found herself wondering
whether he would be there. She could no longer nonchalantly take
the position that he was free to think what he liked about her. She
cared, and she knew that she cared. Yet if he was too blind to see,
too stupid to understand her true character&mdash;well, there was
nothing she could do about it.</p>

<p>As for Lloyd, the recollection of this strange girl had haunted
and tormented him. It had been his first experience of passion, and
that he had yielded to it at all humiliated him. He had been
brought up to believe that any such yielding was a sin. He did not
realize that love, whether sacred or profane&mdash;flower or
weed&mdash;sprouts from a single seed, that the flower may wither
and grow rank and that out of passion may spring a blossom of
spiritual beauty. That much depends upon the watering.</p>

<p>When Maitland entered the Croyon he was conscious of an
atmosphere of excitement hardly to be accounted for by the strong
odor of whiskey in the crowded coat-room. Although things were in
full swing Mrs. Kayne and her daughter still stood receiving on the
upper landing. The girl's face was flushed, her dilated eyes
shining, and it was dear that she was impatiently awaiting the
moment when she should be at liberty to join the dancing throng
about her.</p>

<p>That she did not recognize the tall youth who was coming up the
stairs had no significance&mdash;she did not know a third of
them&mdash;but she observed that he had a military air, and he was
on the whole, she thought, rather handsome&mdash;at any rate, quite
nice-looking. She had four categories, in one of which she
instantly classified every new male&mdash;perfectly stunning,
rather handsome, quite nice-looking, and simply awful. Then he
smiled disarmingly and she put him back into the higher rating,
where he remained for nearly an hour, before being
reclassified.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayne returned Lloyd's smile with the fixed gleam of a
lighthouse and allowed him to press her hand. He was merely the
four hundred and fifty-first young man whose name had been vainly
shouted at her against the din of the orchestra. She didn't know
any of them herself and there was really no use of her standing
there or of Sheila's doing so either, since the boys Sheila did
know would dance with her anyway, and the others would do as they
pleased, having, naturally, no oppressive feeling of obligation
toward a hostess who had invited them in order to make sure of
having enough men and who did not even know whom she had
invited.</p>

<p>As was customary with those who could stand the price, the whole
affair had been left in the hands of Mrs. Bougereau, one of the
many "social secretaries," so called, who, perhaps because the
field of interior decoration was becoming exhausted, had gone into
the business of organizing juvenile society and could guarantee to
deliver an indefinite number of dancing young gentlemen like
shorthorns on the hoof, at what was, in effect, so much per head.
That they were personally unknown to her or to her clients was a
matter of indifference&mdash;since they usually, at least, belonged
to families whose names were printed in the Social Register, and
hence were presumptively quite all right. Thus Mrs. Bougereau for a
substantial consideration not only relieved the mother of all the
trouble and annoyance incident to introducing her daughter to
society, but supplied the "society" as well.</p>

<p>Under our system of avoiding responsibility by delegating our
duties to others whenever possible, the New York mother of 1921 no
longer introduced her daughter at the latter's début to her friends
but to a heterogeneous mob of juveniles patched up by the
professional exploiter of society from the various "lists" supplied
her by the débutantes. The girls jotted down such names as they
could recall of any boys whom they had met, no matter under what
circumstances, and when they could not remember a surname, if
indeed they had ever known it, they used any available means of
identification including nicknames or brief personal
descriptions.</p>

<p>The lists furnished to Mrs. Bougereau contained such accurate
and pleasing aliases as "Rough" Bangs, "Slick" Thompson, "the
curly-haired man with broad shoulders who visited Ada Sims at
Tuxedo&mdash;named 'Orange' or something," and "Smith&mdash;the
yellow-haired one." But she skilfully interpreted them and
forwarded the necessary invitations to those for whom they were
intended.</p>

<p>By a convenient laxity of social standards, since tickets of
admission were not issued, many young men in need of amusement came
who were not invited at all, as did also, it must be admitted, a
few of the opposite sex. The ball once over and the débutante
"introduced to society," the galaxy of youth and beauty thus
assembled dispersed until Mrs. Bougereau's assistance was required
by some other mother who desired to advertise to the public that
she had a daughter to marry off and could afford to hire a hotel
for an evening. Thus Mrs. Bougereau became a sort of social
clearing-house, and, once on her list, particularly on one of her
smaller ones, since they were graduated, one's daughter was invited
everywhere that the young were gathered together. On Mrs.
Bougereau's smaller lists were the scions of all those who were
expected to entertain extensively or who employed Mrs.
Bougereau.</p>

<p>That capable woman had arrived early and had given very definite
instructions to the dressing-room maids, the men in the coat-room,
and the head waiters. She wanted it positively understood&mdash;as
she couldn't be everywhere herself&mdash;that no girls were to be
allowed to go up-stairs without shoulder-straps and that, if the
dresses were too low, Emma must stitch in some tulle of the
appropriate color before they left the dressing-room. And no young
lady should be allowed to take off anything. If any undergarments
were discovered lying around they should be instantly concealed. Of
course if the girls left them at home nothing could be done about
it. Flasks were to be confiscated but returned to their owners at
the end of the evening&mdash;she looked severely at the row of
sophisticated domestics&mdash;<i>with their contents
intact</i>.</p>

<p>She begged Rheinart, the captain in charge of the supper, to use
discretion about the amount of "white grape juice" he
served&mdash;if any table was too noisy he might even remove the
pitcher on the pretext of refilling it and then not bring it back.
The dance was going to be one of the high spots in her business
career, and, while she wanted plenty of "pep," there must be
nothing that could offend anybody&mdash;that Geroud dance, where it
was said they had passed around bedroom keys and one couple had
been discovered under the piano&mdash;and that other recent costume
party where each guest had gone as a character in the Stillboy case
had started a lot of talk.</p>

<p>There was to be no "necking"&mdash;no skipping off on the part
of any couple into the storage loft back of the music balcony.
Rheinart must station a special man there whom he could absolutely
trust to refuse all bribes&mdash;a real scandal would ruin her
business. They knew what she wanted and if she got it they could
rely on her seeing that Mrs. Kayne treated them generously.
Rheinart personally should break up any rough stuff.</p>

<p>Tall, angular, efficient, good-natured, herself a devoted
daughter supporting a decrepit old mother, she was but part of a
system, the object of which was pleasure. One emphatic protest to
the mothers and she could have prevented much of the mild
misconduct that went on. But she dared not antagonize the
daughters.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bougereau realized that she was in a dangerous business
from many points of view and tried to trim her sails to the breeze
of public opinion. She would have been genuinely horrified had it
been suggested to her that the Croyon ballroom was in the slightest
degree a menace to morals. Yet it was, in fact, nothing less,
although every New York mother felt quite safe in letting her
daughter go to any entertainment given by the Kaynes. Mrs.
Bougereau, whose digestion was good, took Mrs. Kayne's
responsibilities lightly; and as neither the daughter nor the money
to be spent was hers she did not worry.</p>

<p>As she had climbed up the stairs and gazed upon the work of her
hands she had seen that it was good. The huge mirror-lined ballroom
had been latticed and turned into a rose garden, with a platform at
one end disguised as a "gazebo" or bower from which Mrs. Kayne,
with specially favored friends, might view Sheila's social triumph.
In an acre of polished floor were reflected a multitude of electric
lights peeping through screens of flowering green. The
contract&mdash;on which she took ten per cent&mdash;had been only
twenty-five hundred dollars&mdash;and the job had been complete.
The orchestra was already mildly jazzing "All I want is a little
bit of love, a little bit of love from you!" The supper-room, into
which she glanced, was a real tropical glade&mdash;thirty-five
hundred dollars. She felt a thrill of genuine pride&mdash;if only
her classmates back in the Oswego Normal School could see it with
their own eyes instead of merely reading about it in the
papers!</p>

<p>Then Rheinart called her and she hurried back to the landing in
time to receive the Kaynes&mdash;very distinguished, she thought,
and Sheila&mdash;as she called her, for she called all the girls by
their first names&mdash;perfectly sweet in white and mauve.</p>

<p>Rufus, stiff and self-conscious, nervously congratulated her
upon her achievement.</p>

<p>"Looks very nice. What did you do about the champagne?"</p>

<p>"Successfully camouflaged."</p>

<p>The banker started to light a cigarette but changed his mind in
spite of Rheinart's lighted match.</p>

<p>"I trust everything will be satisfactory, sir," said the latter,
bowing low.</p>

<p>Rufus handed him a fifty-dollar bill.</p>

<p>Then everybody began to arrive at once&mdash;for the theatres
were out. At a quarter to twelve they were still coming. Maitland,
shoved along by an even later comer and knowing nobody, paused just
inside the main doorway. In the centre of the ballroom stood a
compact mass of boys, which, being constantly augmented, had
gradually driven the dancers closer and closer toward the walls
until only a narrow aisle was left. Many of the boys and some of
the girls were smoking cigarettes while they danced, and he saw
several lighted stubs tossed upon the floor without any effort
being made to extinguish them by the boys in the "stag line." A
pungent aroma of alcohol floated above this group and mingled with
the smoke arising from it.</p>

<p>These young gentlemen about town were intensely
serious&mdash;their time was valuable. Occasionally one of them
would dart into the crowded throng of dancers, tear a girl from the
arms of her partner, press her madly to him and drag her away only
to lose her to another after a few yards. Then the dejected youth
would rejoin his companions and his eyes would resume their
fiercely penetrating search. It reminded Maitland of a struggling
mass of scintillating fish from which the trawlers were choosing
the most toothsome. Sheila was among them now, followed by a crowd
of insistent admirers, and merely stepping from one pair of arms to
another. With luck a partner might manage adroitly to dodge all
pursuers for a few paces.</p>

<p>The air was hot; the speed of the dance so swift that the girls
seemed clinging to their partners' bodies merely to prevent being
trampled upon, as one unhorsed might cling to a slipped girth;
while a cynical drummer with a face like a snapping turtle drove
them on faster and ever faster with a frenzy of whistles, yells,
and catcalls, accompanied by the jangle of cow-bells and the crash
of crockery.</p>

<p>Rufus, after having been twice mistaken for a waiter, at length
perceived that his only function was to pay the bill and decided,
as soon as the receiving was over, that he might as well slip over
to the club for a game of bridge. It was not as if he were going to
leave Elizabeth entirely alone, for by that time his brother James
had arrived with his wife and daughter, his sister Bridget, with
her husband Ward Mallory, had put in an appearance, and Mrs.
Brice-Brewster had come in after the opera, escorted by Mr.
Pepperill. Accordingly, having led the way to the "gazebo" and
installed the party of adults beneath the rose-entwined lattices,
the host made his escape, intending to return in time for the
supper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bougereau hovered in the background, retrieving couples who
sought to lose themselves. A great hubbub came up from below, where
the men congregated outside the coat-room. The overflow from the
ballroom had swamped the landings and the stairs were crowded with
girls ostentatiously smoking cigarettes with an air of arch abandon
while their youthful companions tried to give the effect of being
dashing men about town. In ordinary life they were normal boys and
girls. But here in this artificial atmosphere most of them felt
obliged to conduct themselves as they imagined chorus girls and
roués would conduct themselves&mdash;and to fill their conversation
with innuendo and what was referred to as a "warm line" of
dialogue. The situation was for the most part due to a small group
of supposedly "smart" girls who aped an air of profligacy which the
others foolishly fancied that they must copy or be neglected.</p>

<p>It was Maitland's first dance since his return from the other
side and it struck him as an extraordinary performance. No European
cocotte would publicly conduct herself as some of these young girls
were doing. Women like that had too much sense to advertise. If
this was the "society" into which the mothers introduced their
daughters, why not turn them loose on Broadway and be done with
it?</p>

<p>He pushed through the throng and took his stand nearer the
orchestra, where, if possible, it was less crowded and whence he
could view the dancers to better advantage. And then among them he
saw Diana dancing with Devereaux. They must have come there
together! She passed at a distance, observed him, and faintly
smiled, only to be instantly lost to view. Then unexpectedly she
was just in front of him again.</p>

<p>"Well!" she cried, laughing. "Here I am! Aren't you going to
dance with me? Don't you want me?"</p>

<p>Lloyd took her hand, nodding at his friend.</p>

<p>"Want you!" he murmured, reddening. "Of course I do!
But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I must be running along, Di," said Devereaux, releasing her.
"Good night! So long, Lloyd!"</p>

<p>The sportsman's tall figure struggled for a moment against the
current of dancers and was engulfed. Diana lifted her
half-encircled arms as if to place them upon Lloyd's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well?" she protested, "I'm beginning to think you <i>don't</i>
want me!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he stammered, "I don't know how to dance
this&mdash;whatever it is. I'd ruin your dress!"</p>

<p>She dropped her arms and flirted her fan.</p>

<p>"Never mind!" she answered at once. "Then we can sit down over
there with the old folks and watch the children. Aren't they
funny?"</p>

<p>"I don't find them particularly so!" he replied as he led her
toward the "gazebo."</p>

<p>She interpreted his note of disapprobation as a
condescension.</p>

<p>"Don't take our modern Babylon too seriously!" she said,
obviously intending to convey as well: "Don't take yourself too
seriously!"</p>

<p>He saw that she was piqued and was sorry, yet neither then nor
at any other time could he tell her less than the whole truth.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I could take it too seriously! It seems to me
it's pretty bad!"</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows slightly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Savonarola?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he retorted. "Just an interested observer. It isn't
exactly what America went into the war to make the world safe
for&mdash;is it?"</p>

<p>She did not know it, but the real reason for her resentment of
his disapproval was her consciousness of his disapproval of
her.</p>

<p>"It's democratic enough!" she laughed, in an attempt at a
lighter tone. "Our system brings a girl into contact with nearly
every sort of man."</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about the contact!" he muttered, as a couple
cantered past them.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you're qualified to judge of us?" she asked
sharply.</p>

<p>Her tone hurt him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," he answered. "I didn't mean to be discourteous.
You asked me a question and I tried to answer it honestly. I might
have evaded it, I suppose. But I didn't want to&mdash;with
you."</p>

<p>She looked up quickly and her eyes softened as they had on the
former occasion when he had asked her forgiveness.</p>

<p>"It is really a wonderful party!" he declared. An expression
such as he had not before seen there came into her face.</p>

<p>"I don't blame you for being disgusted!" she confessed. "But
they're not really rotten&mdash;just silly kids!"</p>

<p>The situation thus momentarily relieved was saved by the doors
of the supper-room being thrown open at that moment. In the mad
rush for tables that ensued Maitland and Diana, who had almost
reached the "gazebo," found themselves deserted with the adults at
the upper end of the ballroom. The James Haynes and the Mallorys,
having felicitated Mrs. Rufus upon the distinguished character of
the entertainment, now took their departure, and as Rufus had not
returned, and as Sheila had made up a separate table of her own,
Maitland was constrained to assist Mr. Pepperill in convoying the
remaining Olympians to the dining-room, where, Mrs. Kayne
explained, a special table with extra waiters had been reserved for
herself and favored guests.</p>

<p>There was no longer any question as to the success of the party,
and Mrs. Bougereau, who, all smiles, conducted them to their seats,
admitted modestly that things were going very well. As the moments
passed they went better and better, owing, no doubt, to Mrs.
Bougereau's "camouflage." The tropic glade was soon thick with
tobacco smoke and sickly sweet with the odor of food, whiskey, and
toilet perfumes. Here and there a girl could be seen unconcernedly
powdering her nose, combing her bobbed hair, daubing her cheeks
with rouge, and using her lip stick as she sat among her companions
at the supper table. The din was deafening. It was the supreme
moment of the young.</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill, sitting at his hostess's right, caught Lloyd's
eye across the table and made his customary wry face. Diana watched
him with amusement.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what can have become of Rufus!" ejaculated Mrs.
Kayne. "However&mdash;they seem to be getting along all right!"</p>

<p>At that instant, as if in confirmation of her statement, a boy
at an adjoining table half rose and waved a flask in her direction.
The girl beside him seized it and pulled him back into his chair
before Mrs. Kayne had time to grasp exactly what had occurred. She
was glad they were all having such a good time, she told Mr.
Pepperill. Across the room Sheila, unable to eat a mouthful, sat in
speechless ecstasy.</p>

<p>It was at about this juncture that Mr. Pepperill assisted Mrs.
Brice-Brewster to arise and make her adieus. Their departure,
however, had no perceptible result upon the spirits of the company,
which were already as effervescent as they well could be. And now
from behind a screen of palms six saxophone players&mdash;"The Jazz
Kings"&mdash;made up in exaggerated imitation of negro
minstrels&mdash;filed in amid cheers of recognition and wild
applause from the company, with whom they appeared to be on terms
of intimacy. It was Mrs. Bougereau's final touch that gave the
fillip to the whole affair. Everybody would talk about a party
where they had champagne and the "Six Little Saxophones."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, the minstrels having departed, a new
excitement arose. At one side of the room a long table had been set
especially for the use of the "stags." This had been usurped by a
very noisy party who, in spite of Mrs. Bougereau and Rheinart,
became steadily more and more uproarious, until at the departure of
the vaudeville artists they were attracting the attention of the
entire room. They were now engaged in the gentle pastime of
breaking the silverware in two and throwing it into a heap in the
middle of the table amid shrill cries of joy. Rheinart expostulated
in vain. They offered to break him in two and throw him in with the
silverware. Mrs. Bougereau was at her wits' end. She did not wish
to make a scene, but, really&mdash;breaking silverware! She had
chaperoned some rough parties, but there had been nothing like this
before in her entire experience. They might begin to throw crockery
next! The girls, however, were thrilled. They called excitedly upon
one another to look! That was "Snooky" Brown standing up with the
ladle! Was he really going to break it in two? Oh, dear! Wasn't it
awful! What a funny boy he was!</p>

<p>Lloyd was shocked, his sense of decency offended. He had not
believed such a scene possible. At a negro cake-walk, perhaps; but
not at the formal introduction to society of the daughter of a
respectable New York family at one of the supposedly best hotels in
the city. These young bounders ought to be thrown out! Where was
the host? It was really none of his business and he hated all
scenes. He looked quickly at Mrs. Kayne, but her face showed only
helpless bewilderment. The Brown boy, waving the ladle about his
head, was yelling incoherently. At the opposite end of the table
another boy with a sweep of his arm pushed the adjacent china to
the floor with a crash.</p>

<p>Diana glanced meaningly at Lloyd. It was all the authority he
needed. He sprang to his feet, crossed the intervening space and
wrenched the ladle from the boy's hands.</p>

<p>"Get out, all of you!" he ordered.</p>

<p>In spite of their condition neither Mr. Brown nor any of his
associates had any doubt that he meant exactly what he said. In
silence the embarrassed boys made their way out of the room. Next
instant there was as much noise as ever&mdash;perhaps even more,
since everybody was discussing the incident in great excitement.
Lloyd, rather white, returned to his seat.</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;Mr. Savonarola!" she whispered. "They were
outrageous!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think so!" he answered grimly, pouring himself a
glass of water. "I was afraid you might think they were only being
silly!"</p>

<p>Diana laughed good-naturedly at the thrust. After all, it was
not her funeral, she said. Mrs. Kayne still looked like a
frightened sheep. She really didn't know what to think. In a way
she was relieved, although she was not altogether certain that such
Spartan methods were really necessary. If only Rufus had been
there&mdash;he would not have made it so obvious, perhaps.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bougereau was aghast. She wished that young man had not
interfered. The boys would have quieted down in a moment or
two&mdash;there would not have been any thing left to break.
Calling attention to it would only make for notoriety&mdash;and
hurt her business. Rheinart, however, heaved a sigh of relief and
from behind Lloyd's chair muttered: "Well done, sir! Thank
you!"</p>

<p>But it was Sheila who, coming across to where Maitland stood,
thrust her hand into his impulsively and thanked him for having
saved her party. He really had been perfectly splendid! Why hadn't
he danced with her? Then she would teach him! And so, Mrs.
Bougereau having just then by an inspiration directed the orchestra
to start up again, she dragged the pupil away and refused to have
her lesson interrupted for at least fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Gradually, the sobering effect of the chastisement administered
to Mr. Brown and his friends having worn away, the dance regained
most of its original vivacity. Rufus, who had lost ninety dollars
at bridge, having thus escaped at that slight expense the necessity
of assuming the responsibility of preserving order, returned just
as Lloyd was going away and, ignorant of what had occurred during
supper, expressed much pleasure at findin g him there. Perhaps he
<i>would</i> do for Sheila! When Lloyd bade Diana good night at
half past one, she said, with a quizzical laugh:</p>

<p>"I should think you'd feel quite like a member of the family!
However, it can't be helped!"</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairs fifteen or twenty maids sat in a
somnolent row, their heads at varying angles. They would all sit
there for from two to three hours longer waiting for their young
charges to have just one last dance. A semi-comatose youth in the
coat-room received Lloyd's check and accompanying half dollar as in
a trance. One young gentleman&mdash;as yet unobserved by the eagle
eye of Mrs. Bougereau&mdash;was lying prone on the floor behind the
curve of the main staircase.</p>

<p>The effect of the grape juice had slightly worn off by two
o'clock. At three another supper was served and at four-thirty,
breakfast&mdash;consisting of scrambled eggs, sausages, bouillon,
and coffee.</p>

<p>Sheila, exhausted to the point of semi-unconsciousness, kept on
mechanically, staggering from one partner to another until the last
bedraggled flapper had departed. She heard dimly the orchestra
playing "Home, Sweet Home!" but she had no recollection of how she
got to her own sweet home or into bed&mdash;where she dreamed of a
perfectly stunning man who drove everybody down the Croyon's stairs
and then carried her away in his powerful arms.</p>

<p>A few of the young gentlemen shook hands with Mrs. Kayne and
thanked her for a pleasant evening, but most of them disregarded
her. Mrs. Bougereau, however, was as lively as she had been seven
hours earlier. Almost regretfully she watched one of the omnibuses
sweeping up the cigarette butts. There were many&mdash;and in the
strangest places! Then, having distributed largesse on behalf of
the hostess among the maids, waiters, and other attendants, she
donned her fur coat and entered her waiting taxi just as the east
was paling behind the black bulk of the Grand Central Palace.
Up-stairs Rheinart carefully looked around everywhere to make sure
nothing was burning.</p>

<p>A fat black cat stole out of the storage loft and came tripping
daintily down the balcony stairs precisely like a lady, although
she was really the commonest sort of cat.</p>

<p>"Here, kitty-kitty-kitty!" called Rheinart alluringly. But the
cat ignored him, her attention being concentrated upon a crimson
makaw.</p>

<p>The carpenters were already taking down the lattice-work from
the walls of the ballroom and piling it in a heap in the middle of
the floor. The roses were all withered.</p>

<p>Some three hours later Rufus, in response to the young footman
Capper's knock, awoke and sat up stiffly to take the breakfast tray
across his knees. Lying folded by the toast and marmalade was a
copy of the morning paper and he turned automatically to the
familiar "society column" opposite the editorial page. Yes, there
it was!</p>

<p>"Ball at Croyon Hotel for Miss Sheila Kayne." In the middle of
the sheet was a picture purporting to be that of his débutante
daughter, but in reality that of a young person unknown to him.</p>

<p>"At a dance, easily the most brilliant as yet of the season,
Miss Sheila Kayne, youngest daughter of Rufus Kayne, Esq.,
President of the Utopia Trust Co., was introduced last evening to a
large but select gathering of New York's best society. The ballroom
was exquisitely decorated to represent a rose garden in full bloom
while the supper was served in a tropical grove where live parrots
and makaws swung among the branches of exotic trees. Music was
furnished by Joseph's Orchestra assisted by 'The Six Little
Saxophones.' Among those present were Mrs. Kayne, Mrs.
Brice-Brewster, etc. etc., the Misses Kayne, Brice-Brewster, etc.,
etc., and the Messrs. Brown, Black, Bell, Bangs, Bullard, etc.,
etc."</p>

<p>How had they referred to him? "President of the Utopia Trust
Co." Suppose it had been his obituary and that was all they had
said?' But what more could they have said? What more was he? The
affair had gone off well, anyhow. That Mrs. Bougereau was a clever
woman. Not every one could have handled those reporters so as to
keep that silver-breaking incident out of the papers!</p>

<p>Greatly relieved, he poured a smoking golden stream of coffee
into his particular cup of Spode and reached for the hot milk. That
Maitland fellow! Curious how he was always mixing into his affairs.
He hoped none of the boys' parents would be cut up at their being
put out. No use treading on people's toes. Personally he'd rather
have let it go. By the time he put in the cream he had reached the
conclusion that, on the whole, Maitland had been too officious. At
all events Sheila was "out." Thank God, that was over!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10. Knight Errant</h2>

<p>Lloyd did not see the inside of the Kayne house until the week
following Sheila's party, when he brought Nigel Craig there to
confer with the banker regarding Lady Harrowdale's projected escape
from England. The two youths had looked forward to the interview
with interest, Lloyd since he hoped to see Diana again and Nigel
because it marked the beginning of an experience that would fill
for a time his otherwise empty existence.</p>

<p>Kayne had made the necessary arrangements to have a large
auxiliary schooner in the neighborhood of the Isle of Wight at the
time when his daughter Claudia might be expected to desire to leave
England, and nothing now remained but for Craig to receive his
credentials and start upon his adventure.</p>

<p>It was nearly six o'clock as they ascended the brownstone steps,
and they had hardly pressed the bell inside the vestibule before a
motor stopped in front of the house and Diana came running up. She
was smiling to herself and this gave the corners of her slanting
eyes&mdash;bluer than ever&mdash;an upward twist. Against the glare
of the doorway she did not notice the visitors until they had
followed her inside. Then observing who they were she turned and
held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Savonarola!" she cried. "So you managed to survive
your horrible experience of the other evening?"</p>

<p>Lloyd presented Nigel to her.</p>

<p>"We've come to see your father," he said. "I don't know&mdash;"
he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do know all about it!" she answered. "He's told me. It's
splendid." Then, addressing Craig, she laughed: "Somehow I've come
to regard Colonel Maitland as our family savior&mdash;'women and
children first.' Capper, take these gentlemen to the library,
please!"</p>

<p>"Shan't I see you again?" asked Lloyd.</p>

<p>"Do you doubt it?" she retorted. "You don't know half of us yet
and the season has only just begun. Well, I must go and make my
daily visit to grandfather."</p>

<p>With a nod Diana disappeared into the elevator. Nigel squeezed
Lloyd's arm.</p>

<p>"If Lady Harrowdale is anything like her sister I shall owe you
a debt of gratitude!" he whispered.</p>

<p>The young footman, having taken their coats, had started up the
stairs and, as they followed, Maitland glanced about him with
curiosity tinged with a slight amusement. The main feature of the
house was its great entrance-hall lined with huge vases and its
massive organ at the farther end, surrounded by palms among which
glinted half-hidden statuary. This hall, large enough for dancing,
was three full stories in height and surrounded by a carved gallery
or "mezzanine" from which hung several huge tapestries of modern
design. On one side rose the stairway, its newel post decorated
with a bronze electrolier representing Mercury "new-lighted on some
heaven-kissing hill." On the other were several ponderous tables.
The floor was of pink marble. The whole affair was wainscoted in
black walnut and inexpressibly ugly.</p>

<p>Mr. Kayne, who had evidently been waiting for them, arose, upon
their entrance, from a heavy, leathern armchair and greeted them
both cordially. He was anxious, quite naturally, he explained, to
meet the man who was to be responsible for the safety of his
daughter and her two children&mdash;Lloyd noticed that he did not
refer to himself as a grandfather&mdash;and to discuss the
arrangements. He was evidently favorably impressed by Nigel's
appearance.</p>

<p>Lloyd outlined the plan. Craig was to go straight to London,
confer with Lady Harrowdale's solicitors, ascertain Sir Percy's
personal movements, and, when notified of the presence of the
schooner in the Solent, make himself known to Claudia in whatever
manner seemed most advisable. The details of her escape were to be
left entirely to his judgment. She was to make no attempt to take
any of her possessions away with her. All her property rights would
be safeguarded by her solicitors. It might all be accomplished in
three weeks&mdash;it might, on the other hand, take three months.
There must be no slip-up.</p>

<p>"I guess there won't be!" remarked Rufus, as he handed Nigel a
packet of letters, including one to Claudia. "I guess you fellows
are all right."</p>

<p>"Of course, I'll keep you informed of everything by cable,"
Nigel assured him. "Good-by, sir!"</p>

<p>"Good-by&mdash;and good luck!" answered Rufus.</p>

<p>Just then Sheila tripped in.</p>

<p>"I was up with Grandpa and Uncle Billy, and Di told me Colonel
Maitland was here!" she called from the doorway to her father. "I
want to see Colonel Maitland!"</p>

<p>"Here I am!" answered Lloyd. "But I'm sorry I took you away from
your grandfather. I hope some time to meet him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's got Diana," she protested. "Besides, I'm up there all
the time."</p>

<p>Rufus introduced Nigel and after a few desultory words the two
men descended to the hall, where the young footman, having helped
them on with their coats, hesitated for a moment and then said:</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, Colonel Craig! But don't you recognize me,
sir?"</p>

<p>Nigel glanced at his face. Suddenly he slapped the footman on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why, if it isn't old Capper!" he cried. "Good old Capper! What
on earth are you doing over here?"</p>

<p>"Just earnin' a livin', sir," beamed Capper. "There's no work at
'ome, sir. An' this is all I know 'ow to do, sir!"</p>

<p>"Well! Well!" ejaculated Nigel. "This is a surprise. I'm off for
England on Saturday, but when I get back I'll send for you and
we'll have a good time talking things over. I'm living with Colonel
Maitland. You can always find me through him. Glad to have seen
you! Good luck!"</p>

<p>"Good luck to you, sir!" said Capper. The tears were in his
eyes, as they shook hands.</p>

<p>Then he became a footman again and opened the door for them.</p>

<p>"One of your men?" asked Lloyd, as they descended the steps.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;my mess orderly. One of the boys from my
village&mdash;my 'home town' as you would say over here, was with
me all through the big show at Ypres. The night I got gassed he was
bringing me up a brandy and soda through a communication trench. He
stole the soda from the G. Q. M's. It was the time they blew up the
big angle, you remember&mdash;and things were pretty hot."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember very well," answered Lloyd as they reached the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>"A shell knocked him over before he reached me about ten feet
from where I was lying. The same squad carried us both back to the
field hospital. When he came to, the first thing he did was to ask
for the 'B. &amp; S.' Didn't purpose any one else should have it,
you know! Well, here we are&mdash;two of the eight hundred thousand
casualties of the Paschendael swamp."</p>

<p>They turned down the avenue against the fluctuating current of
pedestrians and paused with a knot of people in front of a picture
dealer's. Unable to see what the attraction was, owing to the
intervening heads, they were about to pass on when their way was
momentarily blocked by a stout gentleman in a fur-trimmed overcoat
to whose arm a Spanish-looking girl was clinging. Lloyd could hear
her say something about "silver fox."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!" snapped the man with her. "Aren't you ever going
to be satisfied! You want the earth!"</p>

<p>Three days later Nigel sailed, but it was over three weeks
before his letter came, announcing his safe arrival and saying that
he was in contact with Claudia's solicitors. He feared, he said,
that the matter would take longer than they had anticipated owing
to the fact that Harrowdale had temporarily developed a sudden and
unexpected taste for domesticity and for the first time in eighteen
months was sticking closely to home. This did not interfere,
however, with his general habits. As the season advanced he would
probably go up to London and give them the chance for which they
were waiting.</p>

<p>Lloyd found life in the Irving Place establishment rather
dreary. He would have liked to call upon Diana but she had not
suggested it. He had not been invited to Treasure Island again, for
the season there was practically over and Devereaux had gone south
to his shooting-lodge in Georgia. With quite unreasonable chagrin
he learned from her father that Diana&mdash;with Darcy and
Longwood, the same unfailing quartet&mdash;had spent the Christmas
holidays there.</p>

<p>He was far too busy, however, to leave New York himself even had
he been invited to be of the party, for Mr. Pepperill had placed
him in general charge of the legal business of the Utopia Trust Co.
This occupied all his attention. In consequence he was thrown
constantly with Kayne and gradually found himself almost in the
position of a financial understudy. Banking he discovered to be as
fascinating as law, if not more so. He liked participating in big
things&mdash;constructive rather than destructive, which latter he
perceived his own profession so often to be.</p>

<p>But there was nothing to take him to the Kayne residence and his
social connection with the family ceased abruptly until the latter
part of January, when he received an engraved invitation from Mr.
and Mrs. Rufus Kayne to dine with them upon the tenth of the
following month.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter 11. "Pirate Emeritus"</h2>

<p>Peter B., now a white-whiskered, round-shouldered octogenarian,
who spent most of his time reading detective novels and sitting on
a bench in Central Park, had found his son Rufus everything he had
hoped for. He had got rid of the "Zarazota" just in time to save
his own reputation and to prevent Rufus from contamination; but it
would, he confessed, have been better if he had sent him to one of
those swell boarding-schools instead of forcing him directly into
Yale without any previous social experience by means of a
tutor.</p>

<p>However, the boy had done well enough. No one could say he
wasn't a gentleman! Top of the heap! His wife a leader in society!
His children carrying on with the richest people in the city. Rufus
was connected with everything you could think of&mdash;museums,
hospitals, charity organizations, international committees. A big
man&mdash;known all over the country. Old Peter could hardly keep
down a chuckle. Money had done it! And he'd made that money. That
was on his naughty side.</p>

<p>But he had another&mdash;the side that warmed to the sweet
breath of the first grass and the soft blue of the sky, when he sat
alone in the "Ramble," his eyes half closed, his long knobby hands
with their large blue veins folded on the paper in his lap, the hot
sun pouring down upon his back and the cool breeze filtering gently
through his white beard, as he breathed in the mysterious,
life-giving magnetism of the coming year.</p>

<p>He knew that his time was nearly come&mdash;no matter what the
doctors told him. They only wanted to jolly him along the better to
stick him up. Eighty-one! He had beaten the allotted time by over a
decade! Just as he had outdistanced the majority of men in their
pursuit of riches and pleasure and excitement. He would be going
soon&mdash;back to Brooklyn, back to the polished pink
monument&mdash;and when he went the papers would deal generously
with him, for he had given his money generously.</p>

<p>They would not mention the "Zarazota" or the "Aphrodite"; they
would probably speak of him rather proudly as "a sturdy pioneer,"
the "prototype of earlier and more virile days," a "constructive
force," an "empire builder," a picturesque figure in the financial
world, who had done much for the art and public welfare of the
metropolis, and who would go to his rest leaving behind him an
example of unselfish devotion to the highest ideals of citizenship.
Yes, they would! Not on his own account, but on that of Rufus! And
he was responsible for Rufus, through whom his own name had been
purged of calumny and derision. A good citizen! A good son! He had
not been good himself, but he had left goodness after him. He had
wiped out the stain.</p>

<p>He was glad that Rufus was a good man, a religious man. Queer
how his own religion had come to him all of a sudden that time out
in the Denver yards where he had sidetracked the "Zarazota!" The
quartet in the blue uniforms and the dangling red ribbons, the lean
t nau with the absurd flag, the fat one with the comet, and the two
thin girls.</p>

<p>Miss Flossie McCann and he had watched them interestedly from
the back platform of the car where they were refreshing themselves
with whiskey and soda. The valiant four had come to convert the
train-hands and quite a little crowd had gathered round them, not
altogether jeering, at the quavering solo sung by the younger
woman:</p>

<p class="poem">"Jesus, lover of my soul,<br>
Let me to thy bosom fly,<br>
While the nearer waters roll,<br>
While the tempest still is high.<br>
Hide me, oh, my Saviour hide&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gee!" snickered Miss McCann, who had, as the expression was,
been lapping it up. "Gee! Listen to the fool! Send her out a
drink!"</p>

<p>But the tune&mdash;or perchance the voice&mdash;had stirred
faintly some string in the lyre of the Pirate's memory, recalled
some other woman too long forgotten&mdash;with silvering hair,
perhaps&mdash;singing the same hymn. A lump swelled in his throat
and he felt blindly for the table flap and put down his glass.</p>

<p>The little band was kneeling now&mdash;alone&mdash;and the lean
man with clasped hands raised above his head was calling upon their
Father in Heaven, while the train-hands stood about awkwardly
waiting until they should arise. This they did presently and the
younger girl, the soloist, stepped forward and, with her pale face
lifted to the crowd, began to speak. She was pleading with them,
that was clear enough, and throwing her heart into it. Some one of
the loafers made a half-smothered remark and there was a coarse
laugh. The girl flinched, but only took another step forward,
raising her voice.</p>

<p>"My friends," Peter could hear her shrill interrogation, "do you
realize that Christ died for you?"</p>

<p>"Gee, ain't it the limit!" exclaimed Miss McCann. "No rest for
the weary!"</p>

<p>The Pirate disregarded his companion. That girl had grit. To get
a better view of her he stood up at the end of the platform over
the couplings. Then he perceived that she had observed him and was
coming toward the "Zarazota."</p>

<p>A strange sense of spiritual comradeship with her possessed him.
It was as if the years has been torn asunder and his mother&mdash;a
young girl again&mdash;were holding out her arms to him. In the
neurotic, rather pasty face he saw the vision of a soul's
emancipation. To the Pirate at that instant she was his mother, all
mothers, the Madonna&mdash;a sacred, holy thing. Her sad excited
eyes fell upon Miss McCann.</p>

<p>"Sister!" she cried eagerly, "do you realize that Christ died
for you?"</p>

<p>Miss McCann, the victim of an unexpected and undesired
publicity, turned a furious painted face down at her.</p>

<p>"Cut it, you fool!" she burst out. "Who do you think you are?
Get out of here!"</p>

<p>The next instant the Pirate towered above her, his fists
clenched, his face red with anger. She knew well the force of that
fury.</p>

<p>"Get out of here yourself!" he roared. "Take your things and
vamose!"</p>

<p>He wrenched open the gate and the steps automatically fell into
place.</p>

<p>Miss McCann gave him a single frightened glance. Quietly she
went inside, returning in a few moments with a suitcase and
parasol. He waited savagely until she had descended, then smashed
the gate to again. The Salvationist had disappeared. Without doubt
she was lingering hard by to salvage what was left of Miss McCann's
soul. The Pirate strode into the "Zarazota."</p>

<p>His eye wandered around the ornate gilded carvings of the
"salon" with its rose-tinted cushioned arm-chairs. Something was
working in him. Some hidden voice was speaking to him. He looked
intently at the row of chairs. Was anybody there? Goose-flesh broke
out on his body and he went into his stateroom and flung himself
upon his knees by the brass bedstead that he had had installed
there&mdash;an innovation&mdash;while the colored porter peered
fascinated through the crack of the door. Without knowing it he
found himself repeating "Now I lay me down to sleep&mdash;" the
first and only personal prayer he had ever been taught. He stopped,
feeling foolish. Then he bit his lips and with a sob buried his
head in the rose-tinted satin quilt.</p>

<p>"I pray Thee, Lord, my soul to keep!"</p>

<p>From that day a change had come over Peter Kayne. Something had
continued to work in him. The "Zara-zota" disappeared shortly after
the exodus of Miss McCann. He developed a fondness for revival
meetings and underwrote the expenses of more than one travelling
exhorter. But he was secretive and surreptitious about the business
and never spoke of it to anybody&mdash;not even his most intimate
associates. Practically no one but Uncle Billy McGaw, his half
body-guard, half valet, knew the Pirate had got religion. It was a
curious sort at that&mdash;not so much a combination of remorse and
the desire to atone for his past performances, as a longing to feel
as that girl's face had told him that she had felt out there in the
Denver yards when she had asked him if he realized that Christ had
died for him. He perceived that he had lost something, something
that had once been his, and he hungered to find it again.</p>

<p>It was not at all the ordinary millionaire's desire to square
himself with his fellow man, to re-establish diplomatic relations
with the Hereafter, to pay his money now that he had had his run,
as if life were a sort of trolley trip where, instead of
"pay-as-you-enter," the rule was, "pay-as-you-leave." And it took
no account of form, ritual, or creed. Occasionally when confronted
by some ethical problem he would raise a puzzled face to Uncle
Billy and ask: "What does the Bible say about that? Does the Bible
say anything about that, Bill?" But usually his religion, whatever
it was, bore no relation to conduct&mdash;it was merely a state of
mind in which he saw himself as cleansed&mdash;worthy.</p>

<p>The tie between the father and son was singularly tender. In
Rufus, old Peter imagined himself raised uncorrupted and was happy
in his vicarious resurrection. He did not permit his memory to go
back farther than the "Zarazota." As for the children, he adored
all of them&mdash;the defiant, wayward, Sphinx-like
Diana&mdash;who, as a child, had always been asking
"Why?"&mdash;with her funny smile, like that Italian picture, and
her queer Chinese eyes that always shone sweetly for him yet held
so often a mocking devil when her father and mother were
speaking&mdash;a high-stepping filly&mdash;a wild one&mdash;but God
bless her! And the dark-eyed Claudia&mdash;poor little Claudia, who
had married that English fellow Harrowdale&mdash;a nice-looking
chap&mdash;he'd never seen a girl so in love&mdash;or in love with
love, whichever it was&mdash;he often thought of her most tenderly,
although he had never quite understood what she said to him and
took refuge in patting her hand with a "Yes, yes, my dear, I'm
certain of it!" But his favorite of them all was his little sprite
Sheila&mdash;the last one&mdash;the baby&mdash;the child of
April&mdash;with her darting eyes and restless feet&mdash;who would
steal behind him and clap her hands over his rheumy old optics and,
when he guessed wrong on purpose, would stamp her foot and cry
furiously: "No! No! It's Sheila! You <i>know</i> it's me,
Grandpa!"</p>

<p>He never tired of having her dancing about and ordering him to
do this and that, until Uncle Billy would try to bribe her into
tranquillity with a geological specimen from the big cabinet which
she was too small to reach of herself&mdash;and he nourished her
from his great heart, watching her grow, with a deep tremulous joy,
daily into ever blither and more winsome loveliness. His little
Sheila! His little fairy moonbeam! And every night he prayed a
special prayer that God would keep her and watch over her and let
no harm come to her&mdash;"for it would sure kill me, O God!
Amen!"</p>

<p>He was fortunate that he had the companionship of Uncle Billy,
his lifelong friend and retainer, else doubtless he would have been
very lonely, for Billy's education was about on a par with his own,
and the past afforded them an inexhaustible treasure of
recollection.</p>

<p>Peter B., having no social ambitions and disliking all form and
circumstance in connection with the obviously simple processes of
eating and drinking&mdash;particularly with a lot of "cackling
women"&mdash;lived with Uncle Billy on the top floor of the house
and, when he wanted them, had his meals brought up on a tray.
Sometimes he ate them and sometimes he did not, his lifelong habits
in this respect having been inconsequential. He had a "grub-box"
and a small refrigerator in which were kept milk, sliced meat, and
fruit, and, with the assistance of powdered coffee and an electric
heater, the two old warriors managed very well by themselves, often
spending long days in the Park, subsisting, like the gray squirrels
there, on what they could forage from peanut men and candy
venders.</p>

<p>They knew the Park end to end, from the forest fastness on the
north where one may lose oneself as in a wilderness, to the sunken
half-hidden ponds upon the south, where wild dueks wheel and settle
within a stone's throw of the dust of motors and within ear-shot of
the music of the Plaza's orchestra; they knew when the snow-drops
came, and the forsythia, when to expect the first robins and
blackbirds, and that elusive moment when the wistaria would flower;
they had their favorite nooks for every season and for each shift
of wind, and special benches whence from experience they knew that
they best could view the little tragedies and comedies of bird and
squirrel life.</p>

<p>They had their pets at the sheep cote and the zoo, were
intimates of Angus the old Scotch shepherd and his collie Bruce,
and with Snyder the wizard keeper, whose mere presence would calm
the most unruly animals because in some occult way these recognized
the fact that he was their friend; they knew the mounted cops, some
of whom had lived, as they had, in the West and, like them,
hankered for it still; they knew odd secrets shared by few, such as
the hidden groves beloved of the Greeks and the glades which, on
Sunday, held whole villages from Calabria and Sicily; the corner on
the hillside where the anarchists had their secret meetings; and
the bowers dedicated to both sacred and profane love. There were
wonderful rock gardens&mdash;like the "Shakespeare"&mdash;Japanese
waterfalls, dark, echoing caves where boys played "robbers and
police" and where actual criminals had sometimes lain concealed for
days; unfrequented mossy glades where grew rare ferns and exotic
flowers; and acres of hothouses tended by expert gardeners.</p>

<p>It was a marvellous little world in itself, with its streams and
lakes, its hills, plains, and woods offering a sanctuary for a
multitude of birds and small wild animals, its ever-changing human
population speaking a hundred dialects, its feast-days and
processions, religious and political, its herbariums,
conservatories, and, above all, its great museum of art, filled
with statuary and paintings and priceless treasures of ancient
civilizations, where on wet days the two ancients would wander for
hours, sometimes lunching in the cafeteria, but more often not at
all, half imagining themselves armored knights of the Middle Ages,
Japanese princes of the Samurai, or bearded kings of
Babylon:&mdash;a principality not unlike that of Monaco without the
gambling concession, where old Peter B., his pipe in his mouth,
could sit enthroned on a certain green park bench of the Belvedere,
with Billy McGaw beside him as his grand vizier, and let his eyes
wander for miles over a beautiful fertile plain surrounded on four
sides by distant mountain ranges of brick and mortar but dimly
visible above the trees&mdash;like the Happy Valley of Prince
Rasselas&mdash;and feel that it was his.</p>

<p>Seated tranquilly upon a bench he would gaze for hours at the
tiny horsemen cantering along the bridlepaths, at the slowly
sauntering pedestrians, and at the unbroken torrent of motors
tearing ceaselessly along in both directions. He observed that the
motors never stopped and never slowed down, while, except for the
athletic gentlemen who, with expanded chests, sprinted "heel and
toe" around the reservoir, no one on foot ever hurried; and once he
called Uncle Billy's attention to the phenomenon with the comment
that folks who had autos never seemed to have time to enjoy
themselves.</p>

<p>Thus the Pirate who had cut many a financial throat and forced
many a man to walk the plank of bankruptcy, who at one time or
another could have put his name to a check for the price of a small
kingdom, found the keenest delight of his old age in that which
cost him nothing and which was as free to any tramp as to
himself.</p>

<p>When business permitted, Rufus sometimes left the Trust Company
early and, seeking his father out in his customary haunts in the
Park, would walk home with him if the weather was fine or, if not,
would take the old gentleman for a run up the Riverside in his
limousine. It was during one of these latter trips in early
February that the Pirate turned unexpectedly to his son and
said:</p>

<p>"Ruf, somehow I don't like the way Sheila looks. Seems to me as
if she must be doin' too much with this goin' out every night an'
all! She's that nervous she can't sit still a minute. Always
hoppin' up an' settin' down again. An' her eyes look tired."</p>

<p>They were whirring over the viaduct at One Hundred and
Twenty-fifth Street. Across the indigo-blue Hudson the winter sun
was dropping behind the snow-patched Palisades into a driftwood
blaze. In front of them a huge sign exalted the merits of a certain
well-known brand of cigarettes&mdash;"a shilling in London, a
quarter here." Rufus comfortably exhaled a lungful of grayish cigar
smoke.</p>

<p>"She's all right, father!" he assured him. "They're all like
that! It's natural they should get a little fagged out&mdash;but it
doesn't hurt 'em. Sheila never gets up until nearly twelve o'clock
and, even if she doesn't go to bed till four, eight hours sleep is
enough for anybody."</p>

<p>Rufus, having made up his mind to give Sheila a good time, was
not disturbed. He had no intention of having another marital fiasco
in the family like Claudia's. Sheila should have every opportunity
to meet the very nicest boys of her age and set&mdash;the Kaynes'
set. A girl came out only once. It cost something, but it was worth
the price.</p>

<p>So Sheila had been provided with a dress allowance ample for a
royal princess, furnished with a motor of her own, and supplied
with two maids&mdash;her own regular maid and an extra one, whose
sole function was to attend her whenever she went out at night,
wait for her and bring her home. Each earned her pay, but Sheila
herself worked harder than either of them, falling into her bed so
weary that no amount of repose could possibly rest her aching limbs
or relieve her frayed nerves.</p>

<p>So she staggered bravely on&mdash;doing a fifteen-hour day in a
single shift in which her muscles, brain, and senses were
unrelieved for a single instant. At times all feeling seemed to
leave her body and she had the impression of being only a
head&mdash;or rather the upper part of a head&mdash;floating
through the air. And her conversation became that of a mere talking
machine&mdash;into which she put the proper
cylinder&mdash;"Dinner," "Dance," "Theatre," or "Tea," turned it on
and let it go of itself until it ran down.</p>

<p>"All the same I don't like the way she looks!" insisted the old
man. "Her color ain't healthy and she's got hollows 'round her eyes
like saucers. An' she looks sort of yellow. I know we're all
something like that in color. But Sheila's got a queer look. It
ain't natural. I wish you'd send her away to the country or make
her take a rest."</p>

<p>"Oh, she's all right!" repeated Rufus. "Don't be such a worrier,
father. The season only lasts a few weeks longer and then she won't
have anything to do but rest!"</p>

<p>The Pirate grunted.</p>

<p>"Do you expect me to swallow that, Ruf'? Don't I know that as
soon's she gets through here in New York she'll be skippin' off to
Palm Beach or Miammy an' like as not to Californy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess not!" said Rufus.</p>

<p>"Yes, she will!" prophesied his father. "Unless she drops in her
tracks first, which sometimes I think she will do right up-stairs
with me an' Uncle Billy. An' then, when she comes back from
wherever she goes of those places, it'll start in all over agin'
down to Northampton and Newport maybe!"</p>

<p>Rufus laughed easily.</p>

<p>"It'll be all right, father! Don't you worry!"</p>

<p>They rode in silence for some ten minutes.</p>

<p>"Well!" finally answered the old man with unconvinced
reluctance, as they swung into Seventy-second Street, "maybe it
will! But&mdash;I tell you she don't look healthy! No, sir! She
don't look healthy to me!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter 12. The Last of the
Victorians</h2>

<p>The dinner-party to which Maitland had been bidden at the Rufus
Kaynes'&mdash;"on February the tenth, nineteen twenty-two, at eight
o'clock"&mdash;and the pleasure of which he anticipated with such
eagerness&mdash;owing to his natural assumption that he would see
Diana there&mdash;was, in fact, a biennial event savoring of what
in ecclesiastical circles is referred to as a "fixed feast."</p>

<p>Those of us who keep any sort of written record, no matter how
abbreviated, of those whom we have invited to partake of meat with
us cannot fail to be impressed with the fact that most social
gatherings are preordained or at least predetermined. We are not
satisfied that our friends will "go together" simply because they
come together or that they will enjoy themselves as united in a
common friendship for ourselves. We never invite the Smiths with
the Robinsons, or the Blacks with the Browns. Year after year we
carefully bid the Smiths with the Blacks and the Browns with the
Robinsons, and marshal our other guests into the Black or Brown
group into which they naturally fall. By a similar process of
natural selection, did we but realize it, Mr. Smith inevitably
experiences the annual delight of having Mrs. Black assigned to him
as a table companion. But he realizes it! Oh, yes, Smith realizes
it! Who has not stopped short and shuddered while partaking of
either soup, fish, or roast&mdash;at the sudden materialization
beside his plate of the ghost of his last year's dinner
conversation evoked by some familiar pleasantry or phrase?</p>

<p>The James Kaynes, while privately accusing the Rufuses of
worldliness, rather envied them their prominence and were nothing
loth to reflect a vicarious social lustre by reason of the
relationship. This was rendered less difficult owing to the fact
that in Mrs. Brice-Brewster the ladies had a mutual friend, equally
intimate with each, whose daughter Frances belonged to the same set
as Sheila and her cousin Rachel.</p>

<p>The two families entertained one another at least twice every
winter and on these occasions Mrs. Brice-Brewster, her cousin Mr.
Vincent Pepperill, and the Reverend Roderick Thrum, the rector of
St. Timothy's, were invariably present, for, although the Jameses
were not members of his flock, they were glad to show their
catholicity by including him and at the same time to add the little
touch of distinction given by his presence. It was, in a way, like
saying in so many words: "You know, dear Mr. Thrum, we really ought
to belong to your church, but while we are with you in spirit we
find it quite impossible at this late date, much as we should like
to do so, to make another change."</p>

<p>However, owing to the activity of the Jameses in a multitude of
civic and charitable enterprises, they knew Mr. Thrum even better
than most of his own parishioners. Indeed, charity was to Mrs.
James what bridge was to her sister-in-law; while Mrs.
Brice-Brewster struggled with both, devoting herself to
social-service work on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings and
to cards the rest of the time. Diana, too, was usually included,
since she livened things up and Mr. Thrum liked to sit next to
her.</p>

<p>The Jameses lived in a house built by the same architect as the
Rufuses and decorated by the same decorator, and a guest might
easily have found himself in the wrong pew without realizing any
mistake. And whenever Mrs. Rufus purchased anything new in the way
of rugs, furniture, or motors, Mrs. James was apt to do the same,
probably on the theory of-preserving the balance of power and
making an equal impression upon Mrs. Brice-Brewster, who, since she
had gone out of mourning and now that the war was over, had resumed
entertaining with all the pent-up appetite and enthusiasm of four
lean years.</p>

<p>Sheila had loudly protested that she couldn't possibly give up
an evening, but having put in a requisition for a new ball dress
she did not like to be too recalcitrant, and finally yielded on the
condition that her mother should ask that terribly nice Mr.
Maitland who had been at her party. To this her mother had offered
no objection, being glad to get either of her daughters to stay at
home on any terms. For Rachel had been invited young Professor
Carraway of Columbia&mdash;who had been excavating at Antioch and,
although quite penniless and without any New York connections, was
interesting and in the "distinctly good-looking class," most
parents feeling quite certain that their daughters would not elect
a domestic career in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The Mallorys, on their annual migration from the White Mountains
via Lenox and Briarcliff to Hot Springs, Augusta, Palm Beach, and
the other recognized feeding places for birds of equally brilliant
plumage, and being momentarily at roost at the Croyon, Mrs. Rufus
had regarded this as an excellent opportunity to kill them off. Not
that they were not in every way acceptable, but Bridget, being a
cosmopolite and spending much of her time in Paris, was apt to run
to extremes in matters of dress and coiffure and sometimes
attracted attention by her readiness to adopt fashions as yet
hardly recognizable as such. However&mdash;you had to have them
some time! And there was this to be said for Bridget, that she
always talked and talked loud, which got things going. To Mrs.
Rufus the great thing was to get things going, and to keep them
going, and the louder the hubbub at her dinner-parties the better
she liked it.</p>

<p>Besides, Bridget went well with Senator Krass, who, both because
he was a member of the congregation of St. Timothy's and for the
reason that he was heavily interested in the Utopia Trust Co., was
a natural if not an inevitable addition to the party, being at the
point in his financial career when, like the elder Kayne, he was
about to shed the wolf hide in which he had made his position for
the woollen clothing of a philanthropic sheep. Mrs. Krass was a
sheep already.</p>

<p>She had also been fortunate in being able to get a
representative of the old, established Graham family, Mr.
Pepperill's pet clients, in the person of Mr. Homer Graham, a jaded
connoisseur of art who possessed a fine collection of death-masks
and an exceedingly bad digestion. To balance him she had asked Miss
Antoinette Smyth, the popular settlement worker everybody liked so
much; indeed it was often hard to tell exactly what sort of social
work she was most engaged in.</p>

<p>Then there was little Doctor Follansbee, who went everywhere and
had so much personal information that merely to talk with him gave
one a feeling of vicarious intimacy with his patients among whom he
numbered many of the smartest people in town. He would do
splendidly for Cynthia Mallory who, although not out as yet, was so
tall and had travelled so much that she seemed much older than she
really was.</p>

<p>That made twenty&mdash;a very good number, and no one could say
that it was not a smart party, the family element strongly diluted
by church, state, the legal and medical professions, and society
proper represented in the abounding personality of Mrs.
Brice-Brewster.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayne had hesitated about putting on her new terra-cotta
dress, partly because her emerald stomacher did not go very well
with it somehow and partly because she had wished it to make its
first appearance at the opera, but Mrs. Brice-Brewster had seen
everything else of hers at least twice. So she had put it on
regretfully. Rufus was still up-stairs with his father, but he
always managed to get down to dinner on time, breezing in with a
"sorry-to-be-late-but-I-was-kept-down-town" air, so that she did
not worry. In fact, Mrs. Kayne did not worry much about anything,
except what Jarmon might think.</p>

<p>At three minutes to eight she descended to the drawing-room
which had recently been done over in an attempt to modernize its
previous walnut solidity. Over the fireplace hun g a portrait of
her in another terracotta dress done by Carolus Durand shortly
before the birth of Diana. It did not harmonize very well with the
pink-and-mauve hangings which Miss Lamb had selected for the
walls&mdash;and for an instant she entertained the thought that
possibly an artist could be found who could retouch the dress to
match. Then Sheila came skipping down the stairs. She had just been
up, she said, to pay her regular evening visit to her grandfather
and he was anxious to see Mr. Maitland. Couldn't she take him up
for a moment after dinner? Mrs. Kayne was seriously disturbed.</p>

<p>"Don't you see, dear, you can't do that sort of thing? It would
be very marked! You have only seen this young man once or twice! I
hardly know anything about him except that he works in Mr.
Pepperill's office. You can't treat him like a member of the
family."</p>

<p>"But you let me go to the movies with 'Chubby' Jones and you'd
never even heard of him!" argued Sheila, forgetting the method she
had used to secure her mother's acquiescence as well as her
resulting experience. Just then Jarmon appeared at the door, and
the subject was dropped.</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Kayne&mdash;Miss ELayne!"</p>

<p>The two Mrs. Kaynes embraced, Rachel kissed her aunt, and James,
a large, shining man, smelling of soap, took his sister-in-law's
hand jocularly.</p>

<p>"And how's the society matron?" he exclaimed in a cheerful
voice. "How does it seem to have a daughter who is out?"</p>

<p>"Hello, Edna! Hello, Rachel! How are you, James! Well, here we
are again!"</p>

<p>Rufus had arrived, as usual, almost on time, a shade exhausted,
but up to form. Jarmon reappeared in the near offing and discharged
another signal gun.</p>

<p>"The Reverend Mr. Thrum."</p>

<p>A moment later the rector entered with genial sweep around the
room as he offered a fat hand to his hostess and her husband and
then turned to Sheila with a hearty: "Well! Well! Well! So we are
out in society, are we!" and looked eagerly for Diana.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;are we to have the pleasure of your eldest daughter's
company?" he asked anxiously of Mrs. Kayne.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brice-Brewster&mdash;Mr. Pepperill!" shouted Jarmon,
standing aside to assure the lady sufficient gangway, for she was
one of those copious women who give the impression of getting
behind their fagades and propelling themselves forward by means of
a rear drive.</p>

<p>"How <i>do</i> you do, Emily!" exclaimed Mrs. Kayne with as much
solicitude as if her guest had just returned after a protracted
absence abroad, although they had separated less than an hour and a
half before. "Oh, how <i>do</i> you do, Mr. Pepperill!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill, immaculate and discriminating, shook hands with
each one. He hated such parties.</p>

<p>"Hello, Kayne, how are you? Glad to see you, Thrum. Ah, Miss
Sheila&mdash;how charming you look!"</p>

<p>"Senator and Mrs. Krass&mdash;Doctor Follansbee&mdash;Mr. and
Mrs. Mallory&mdash;Miss Mallory&mdash;Miss Smyth&mdash;Mr. Graham!"
shot Jarmon from the doorway, a gun every second, for they were all
coming together, it being now nearly ten minutes past the hour.</p>

<p>The Senator, a tall man with a face like an underdone ham, shook
hands and having sighted the church immediately bore down upon it.
He was seriously contemplating the donation of a new lectern.
Bridget Mallory, strongly tinted as to cheeks and skittishly
dressed in a costume that would have been suitable as gala attire
in any state of the Balkan Peninsula, lost no time in annexing
herself to Mrs. Brice-Brewster and introducing Cynthia, a
grotesquely tall and rather supercilious girl, prematurely aged
owing to the process of unnatural forcing to which she had been
subjected and, as her mother intimated, to the fatiguing attentions
of the continental male. In pale blue she suggested a heron
standing high above the surrounding scenery.</p>

<p>"Professor Carraway&mdash;Mr. Maitland."</p>

<p>The room was already noisy as Lloyd crossed the threshold close
upon the heels of the cadaverous young archaeologist. But his eye
searching among the various groups caught no glimpse of Diana.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, Maitland!" exclaimed Rufus coming forward. "I
don't suppose you know many of these people. Let me introduce you
to my brother-in-law, Mr. Ward Mallory."</p>

<p>Maitland found himself shaking hands with a smooth-shaven little
man in baggy dress clothes whose round pink head gave him a vague
resemblance to a loosely rolled umbrella with a ball handle. He had
no business to be there, he confided to Lloyd, as his doctor had
absolutely forbidden him to go out in the evening. The war had
interfered seriously with his regular cures and he was beginning to
feel the effect of it; he appeared to take a feverish delight in
imparting this information.</p>

<p>"Shall I announce dinner, madam?" inquired Jarmon in an agitated
whisper of his mistress. "Miss Diana hasn't come down&mdash;I think
she forgot and went out."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayne endeavored to conceal her annoyance.</p>

<p>"Yes!" she answered after a moment's consideration. "You may
announce dinner."</p>

<p>Jarmon accordingly walked out into the hall, waited a few
seconds, and then, returning to the threshold, bowed in the
direction of his mistress. Rufus immediately offered his arm to
Mrs. Brice-Brewster, James his to Mrs. Krass, the Senator gallantly
approached Mrs. Mallory, and the rest of the couples followed in
accordance with the instructions on the little cards which Jarmon
had handed to each gentleman as he came in. The rector being
without his favorite partner, Diana, he fell in beside her mother
and Mr. Pepperill, and the party moved in to dinner.</p>

<p>A momentary confusion was caused by Mrs. Brice-Brewster's
absent-mindedly sitting down before the Reverend Thrum could say
grace and by her futile efforts to get up again, which he
disregarded with his accustomed social tact. The Amen was followed
by an audible gasp of relief as the real business of the evening
began.</p>

<p>Maitland, who had only to let Sheila chatter on without
interruption to make her entirely happy, looked around the table
with interest as she gave him the names of the guests with a little
biography of each.</p>

<p>"That's Aunt Edna over there&mdash;the one with the bright-red
cheeks&mdash;Uncle James's wife. No, she doesn't put anything on
them at all, I swear it! In the daytime they're
purple&mdash;perfectly terrible. She spends all her time presiding
at meetings. I heard her say she had three each week until
April&mdash;has them in her drawingroom, you know. She's got two
hundred gilt chairs of her own that she keeps in the basement."</p>

<p>In the pause, caused by the passing of sherry, he could hear
Mrs. Mallory loudly asking Senator Krass how he liked living in
Washington, which, since the latter lived in New York&mdash;his
senatorial experience having been confined to Ohio&mdash;got things
going excellently. The Senator and his wife were lodged in what was
supposed to be the newest and finest apartment-house in the
world&mdash;they paid twenty-nine thousand dollars a year for their
duplex&mdash;overlooking the Park, and he liked to talk about it
and about the high class of tenants due to the high rent. Everybody
in the Senator's apartment-house paid at least twenty-five thousand
dollars a year for the privilege of being there. Folks, he said,
thought maybe the suites hadn't really been rented, but that was
all wrong, they had&mdash;all of 'em, and there was a waiting list.
It was a wonder where all the money came from!
"Cave-dwellers&mdash;Ha-ha!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mallory countered coquettishly in reply by shouting that
she and her husband were "tent-dwellers"&mdash;whether or not in
those of wickedness she did not divulge. Yes, indeed! Apartments
were much better than houses. It was so easy just to lock your door
and put the key in your pocket and go away and not have to think
about servants or anything, wasn't it? That was the great advantage
of an apartment, but a hotel was even better&mdash;there were such
splendid hotels now everywhere, weren't there?</p>

<p>The Senator agreed that there were many excellent hotels and
inquired courteously which ones she favored in the summer. He went
to Bretton Woods, had the same suite every year&mdash;there was
good golf. Mrs. Mallory thought Bretton Woods delightful, but she
liked the bridge at the Profile House&mdash;it was quite
exceptional and the people unusually pleasant. They played every
afternoon and evening.</p>

<p>Across the way pallid little Mrs. Krass, who assumed quite
justifiably that the Jameses were fashionable, listened with
tensely simulated interest to her partner's account of the great
drive about to be launched for public swimming-pools in every city
throughout the land. The motto "Cleanliness Next to Godliness" was
to appear simultaneously on a hundred thousand hoardings all over
the United States and national opinion was to be roused to the
necessary pitch of giving by a skilled firm of publicity experts.
It was just a question of money, James said. All these movements
were just a question of money, and if you spent enough to begin
with you would get it back and all you wanted besides. Mrs. Krass
said it was quite wonderful and that he must be a great
organizer&mdash;very executive; she knew about public opinion,
because the Senator had done a good deal from time to time in that
line.</p>

<p>At the end of the table Maitland could hear the rector's
penetrating nasal voice decrying modern socialistic tendencies and
Mr. Pepperill's laconic agreement. Opposite him, little Doctor
Follansbee was telling a very funny professional anecdote to Mrs.
James. Following Lloyd's impatient glances toward the empty chair
to which his eyes were constantly straying, Sheila took occasion to
eulogize her absent sister. She did not conceal her intense
admiration for Diana, whom she thought the most fascinating human
being in the world&mdash;yes, "perfectly wonderful!" although she
clearly regarded her as well with a sort of delighted disapproval.
Wasn't she "simply awful" to stay away? When it disarranged the
table so? And on account of Mr. Thrum particularly, whose weakness
for Diana appeared to be a family joke. Personally, she confessed,
she did not like Mr. Thrum&mdash;he bored her to death. She
couldn't imagine what had become of Diana! who was perfectly
capable of having departed for the Orient without notice. The South
Seas must be so wonderful! Had he read "White Shadows"? Wouldn't he
just love surf-riding?</p>

<p>Lloyd strained his ears for something from Mrs. Kayne or her
husband which might explain Diana's defection&mdash;could she be
ill? But Sheila, having finished off her Aunt Edna, had now got
onto the movies and was demanding his attention. Most of the boys
in the upper school forms, she said, went every afternoon in New
York, and one Princeton man had told her that his entire class went
every evening&mdash;it rested their minds. Wasn't Uncle James
terrible? But Rachel was a dear, not the least bit like her
parents&mdash;and awfully full of pep. So was Frances
Brice-Brewster.</p>

<p>She hoped he didn't think all their dinners were like this! He
must come to a real party soon and go to the theatre and the
Crystal Room afterward. He'd been perfectly wonderful the night of
her dance. It had been a success, hadn't it! Didn't he love the Six
Little Saxophones? They said one of them was the second son of an
English viscount! How did he like "The Four Horsemen"? And had he
seen "The Music Box Revue"? Wasn't it simply great? She had been
eight times. They were getting fourteen dollars for the best
seats&mdash;wasn't it awful? He must let her give him another
lesson in the fox-trot.</p>

<p>The roast was going around followed by Jarmon with the
champagne&mdash;his employer having had the foresight to stock up
heavily just before the act went into effect.</p>

<p>"Cliquot '98?" he breathed hotly into Lloyd's ear like a small
sirocco.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rufus, with the aid of the rector and Mr. Pepperill, had
turned the table, and Mrs. Brice-Brewster now swung a pillow-like
bosom of finest texture incrusted with diamonds in the direction of
Lloyd. She had been telling Mr. Kayne, she said, that her solution
of the labor problem&mdash;socialism and all that sort of
thing&mdash;was to make the lower classes feel that the upper
classes took a genuine interest in their welfare. Of course while
the war was on one had been overwhelmed with other work, but now
that it was over everybody ought to do their part. That was the
only way to "stem the r ising tide of discontent"&mdash;by personal
service. She was trying to impress that upon her own Frances,
Sheila Kayne, and all their young friends&mdash;that they ought to
give part of a day every week&mdash;in spite of their social
engagements&mdash;to some sort of personal service, such as
teaching classes of working girls or helping mothers to take care
of their children. That was what she was doing herself&mdash;three
mornings a week&mdash;trying, as she put it, to do her own small
part.</p>

<p>He murmured a polite acquiescence, wondering what instruction to
working girls Sheila could give in any subject&mdash;lessons in the
"toddle," perhaps&mdash;or how much assistance she could be in
taking care of children when she herself was so obviously in need
of supervision.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness we're through with radicalism for the moment at
any rate," the rector was remarking over his champagne glass.
"These socialists overlook the paradox that if, as they say, wealth
is social disorder, to distribute it is merely to scatter the
disease!"</p>

<p>"Hear! Hear! That's really clever&mdash;I call it!" exclaimed
Doctor Follansbee in delighted accents. "The number of cases would
be increased&mdash;that is all!&mdash;epidemic instead of
endemic!"</p>

<p>"I have no patience," continued Mr. Thrum severely, "with the
claim that any approval of socialism can be deduced from the New
Testament. 'Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and
unto God the things that are God's.'"</p>

<p>"Divide up all the wealth and in twenty years it would be back
again in substantiallv the same hands!" said Senator Krass
impressively. "The right to possess and retain the fruits of a
man's industry&mdash;and, I may say, to pass it on to his
children&mdash;is ingrained in human nature. Do away with it and
ambition would cease and the nation sink into sloth. Look at
Russia!" For a moment or two everybody appeared to be taking a look
at Russia, and then Mrs. Rufus terminated the temporary silence
induced by the polite desire to give proper weight to the Senator's
words, by saying with a slight flutter at her own temerity:</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad those Bolsheviks have got what they deserved at
last!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" echoed Mrs. James, her philanthropic mind
instantly obsessed with a sudden vision of new millions to be fed.
"I hear their condition is terrible."</p>

<p>Sheila tweaked Maitland's sleeve.</p>

<p>"Aunt Edna always makes me think of a robin redbreast carrying a
worm to somebody. She has such a wonderful time doing it!" she
whispered.</p>

<p>Maitland wondered what direction Mrs. James's energies would
take if famine there should no longer be.</p>

<p>James, who had hitherto been apparently engrossed in
contemplating his own image as reflected from his gold plate,
looked up suddenly and announced that from his observation the
unions had got enough of it. He was evidently referring to a part
of the conversation between the rector and Mr. Pepperill which had
lingered in his recollection but had escaped that of the rest. Its
inconsequence passed unnoticed, however, and Mrs. Rufus felt
gratified that James was really making an effort.</p>

<p>"I hear," announced Mr. Mallory brightly to Mrs. Krass, and loud
enough for general conversation, "that the new hotel at Red Sulphur
is quite good. Brock's got it, you know. Great friend of mine.
Bright fellow. Must try it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Krass, who had been under the impression that the best
people did not use hotels, but somehow managed to carry their
establishments with them, like snails, wherever they went, became
vaguely uneasy, but said that she liked hotels because the coffee
was always so good. You couldn't seem to get your own coffee to be
like that. From hotels the talk drifted toward the drama, the
various members of the party firing off their views in short,
emphatic salvos.</p>

<p>"That first act&mdash;! Simply immense! But then it petered out
somehow, didn't you think?&mdash;Oh, I didn't like it at all!
Sentimental nonsense&mdash; But I love sentiment! I had tears in my
eyes most of the time! Barrie, you know&mdash;Quite fanciful but
perfectly sweet!"</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Brice-Brewster, evidently not wishing young Professor
Carraway to think her light-minded, asked everybody if they had
been to the new Egyptian wing of the Museum and seen those
extraordinary little models that had been unearthed recently and
were on special exhibition&mdash;little models of boats and fishes
and pieces of meat and other things that they put right in the tomb
with a dead king so that he could use them in the next
world&mdash;perfectly charming!</p>

<p>Maitland wondered what on earth it was all about. These people
presumably were not fools. Yet they were talking baby talk. The
burden of their remarks had been entirely about things&mdash;things
to eat, things to wear, things to live in, things to play with,
restaurants, resorts, dressmakers, hotels, golf-links, theatres,
travel, yachts, and cards. It was the talk of the rich&mdash;oozing
with money in spite of war, pestilence, and famine, of death,
income, and excess-profit taxes, of the high cost of living, the
collapse of foreign markets, and the plunge downward of
securities.</p>

<p>There they all were&mdash;eminently representative of their
respective branches of the social organism, of its business, law,
politics, its ostentatious and patronizing charity, its vapid life
of flitting pleasure and its capable commercial clergy. They were
incredible! Complacent survivals of the Victorian era who had
hardly been aware that a world war was going on and had now
forgotten that there had ever been one. Or mummies, rather!
Curiosities&mdash;perpetuated like flies embedded in the yellow
amber of their golden age. They had settled down over a quarter of
a century ago assured of their own permanence and had gathered
their wealth about them, adding to it, year by year, decade by
decade, until they were entombed in it.</p>

<p>Their sole idea of progress was a continued increase in
prosperity! There was still a church but it was empty of religion.
Mr. Thrum would have been successful in any other kind of business.
The socialism he was so anxious about was, after all, just
quarrelling about money! Property, possessions, respectability,
hypocrisy!</p>

<p>Materialism! It fairly shouted at you from the ponderous walnut
stairway of the wainscoted entrance-hall, from the onyx and
marble-topped tables of the gilt drawing-room crowded with
photographs in ornate gold and silver frames, and from the braid
upon the claret liveries of the footmen!</p>

<p>He recalled, looking across the table at Mr. Pepperill, what the
latter had said on their walk down Fifth Avenue the afternoon when
he had first learned of the Haynes' existence. The old gentleman
had been quite right! There had never been such a century of
material progress in history, but the sense of beauty had been lost
in the whir of machinery. The blue arc of heaven glinted with
wings&mdash;not those of angels&mdash;but of gas-driven airplanes;
the whisper that leapt across the ether was not the voice of God.
We had become self-sufficient supermen. We could get along by
ourselves. This whole generation&mdash;with its ingenuity, its
efficiency, its worship of wealth and success&mdash;had been the
same all over the world.</p>

<p>He wondered if what was true of civilization as a whole, was not
equally true of nations, of families, of individuals? Just as the
Roman Empire had succumbed to materialism, so in its turn had the
German Empire. Whether or not one believed that God had traced the
second commandment with his own finger upon the tablet of stone
given to Moses upon Mt. Sinai, there was no law more fixed in
nature than that the sins of the fathers were visited upon the
children&mdash;collectively and individually. The sins of their
fathers were being visited even now upon the children of Russia, of
Austria, of Germany&mdash;upon the Romanoffs, the Hapsburgs, the
Hohenzollems&mdash;and would be for generations yet to come.</p>

<p>And wasn't it the same with the Kaynes and the whole
materialistic bunch they played with? Weren't the children paying
the penalty of their father's and grandfather's materialism? Was
not retribution descending upon the neurotic, excited child at his
side, whose chatter had never once ceased; upon her sister
sacrificed for a title; upon that other who should have occupied
the vacant chair opposite? He played with the idea. Even so, had
the Victorian era, the end of the nineteenth century, or the period
just before the war been a whit more materialistic than the present
transitional epoch? Had the world learned anything? Where would it
all end?</p>

<p>The crystal finger-bowls on their squares of damask had been
passed and pyramids of nectarines and South African peaches waved
before each guest. Jarmon was moving from place to place tenderly
carrying a bottle, as a high priest might hold a sacred vessel.</p>

<p>"Madeira, sir?"</p>

<p>"Aha! The Russell Madeira!" chirped Mr. Mallory, his eye
glistening. "It had its voyage around the world in '48. I advise
you ladies to take some while you can get it."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the majority of the ladies allowed their
glasses to be filled, and after tasting the wine cautiously, gave
vent to various commendatory murmurs.</p>

<p>"I think it's perfectly nasty!" confessed Sheila, puckering her
lips.</p>

<p>Capper pushed open the heavy doors and the ladies arose. Mrs.
Kayne turned archly and said to her husband:</p>

<p>"Don't stay out too long, Rufus. You mustn't deprive us poor
women of the charms of your masculine conversation."</p>

<p>Diana had not appeared.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter 13. "The Spirit of
1921"</h2>

<p>It was but eleven o'clock when Lloyd inserted his latch-key in
his front door, for the dinner, as the dinners of true Victorians
always do, had broken up precisely at half past ten. On the table
in the hall lay a note in a gray envelope bearing his name, the
flap still damp from sealing.</p>

<p>"Dear Lloyd," it read: "I am giving a small party this evening
for Miss Kayne. I could not get you on the telephone either at your
office or your house. If you get back before eleven-thirty won't
you join us at the Revels? Or, if you can't make that, ask for me
at the Croyon. Don't fail us!&mdash;Larry."</p>

<p>Diana's absence was accounted for! It was decent of Devereaux to
want to include him. He was lucky enough to intercept a taxi at the
Players', and reached Forty-second Street while the performance was
still on. "Show's about over," warned the man in the box-office,
but Lloyd paid for his entrance and went in.</p>

<p>A "Vision of the Ages" was being presented, each era personified
by some beauty in an extravagant costume of the period, who
descended mincingly a long flight of steps toward the audience amid
an ear-splitting racket from the tiny wooden mallets furnished to
the spectators. Either Madame de Staël or the Du Barry was just
being acclaimed, as Lloyd, working his way along the outer fringe
of tables, began his search for Diana's party.</p>

<p>At first he thought that the plan must have been changed, for he
could see nothing of her, but having made the rear circuit he
suddenly observed her directly opposite him at the table nearest
the stage. Returning, he wove through the maze of chairs amid
audible curses from the occupants.</p>

<p>"Good boy!" whispered Devereaux, squeezing his hand as Lloyd
slipped into the vacant place, while Diana's face registered
pseudo-horror and humiliation.</p>

<p>"Was anything left of me?" she asked of him across the
débris-strewn table-top. "Honestly, I forgot all about having to
dine at home."</p>

<p>"The Reverend Thumb&mdash;or whatever his name is&mdash;seemed
quite distressed at not finding you there," he retorted. "That was
all."</p>

<p>She turned her head toward the stage, and Lloyd glanced round
the group. Two tables had been pushed together to make room for
eleven persons besides himself. At the first were Diana, another
girl whom he did not recognize, Darcy, Longwood, and Devereaux;
while at the next, forming another or perhaps a part of the same
group, were two women and four men none of whom he had ever
seen.</p>

<p>The elder of the women, who wore a double string of large pearls
and a striking cerise and silver-gray gown open in the back to the
waist, must have been over fifty years of age, for her hair was
white in spite of her girlish complexion. Her features, though
diminutive, were clear-cut, her small teeth regular, her head with
its cluster of white curls exquisite.</p>

<p>The other woman, perhaps twenty years younger and in her own way
equally striking, was a slender brunette with brilliantly glowing
cheeks. Of the men, two were very young&mdash;almost boys, and
nondescript; the third was pursy and lackadaisical, with a
light-brown pointed, beard designed to conceal the inadequacy of
his chin, and the flowing black tie and velvet collar
characteristic of stage artists. His nose was too small, as was his
mouth, which had rosebud lips. But it was the remaining member of
the party who interested Maitland most.</p>

<p>This was a man of uncertain age, pallid skin, a flat triangular
nose, and lizard-like eyes which seemed never to drop their lids.
The short upper lip was slightly lifted, revealing pointed and
widely set teeth, the chin round, the cheek-bones high, the
chestnut hair long, thick, and wavy. To Lloyd, who had been thrown
constantly during his military service with men of all races, this
one appeared an ethnological miscellany&mdash;a Eurasian possibly.
He had on a short dinner-jacket which fitted him
admirably&mdash;and wore in his soft pleated silk shirt pearl studs
of enormous size. His arms appeared to be too short for his body
and from them dangled short thick hands. His expression was
arrogant, his general effect subtly unwholesome. His gaze at that
moment was concentrated upon the back of Diana's neck and she
seemed conscious of it, for she half turned her shoulder.</p>

<p>The Du Barry and her attendants surrendered the spot-light to a
succession of young ladies, each allegorical of an epoch adapted to
the display of the human figure. At the end "The Spirit of 1921," a
lovely girl, nude save for a leopard-skin, leaped forward,
fireflies flickering in her hair. The orchestra struck up a
frenzied bacchanale. Faster and faster the girl whirled amid the
fusillade of the hammers, dropping at last breathless on her knees
not far from Diana, the spot-light enhaloing them both while the
audience renewed its volume of applause.</p>

<p>"Well done, Mercedes!" cried Diana, clapping her hands. "You're
coming to-night, aren't you?" she added.</p>

<p>"Of course I am!" panted the girl. "Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"To my studio."</p>

<p>"I'll be there in twenty minutes!" answered Mercedes, rising
gracefully to her bare feet and loping to the wings.</p>

<p>The lights sprang up and the hubbub incident to a dispersing
throng filled the hall. Devereaux presented Lloyd first to the girl
beside Diana&mdash;Longwood's sister&mdash;and then to the other
two women, Mrs. Wingate&mdash;the name was familiar to Maitland as
having figured in the divorce court&mdash;and Miss Ricardo. The men
were not introduced.</p>

<p>"I told Mercedes we'd go to my studio," remarked Diana, as she
lit a cigarette, "but if Larry wants to take us right over to the
Croyon, I can leave a note for her."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were artistic!" said Lloyd.</p>

<p>"I'm not," replied Diana. "I merely have a studio. Everybody
does nowadays!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should like to see your studio!" exclaimed Mrs. Wingate.
She nodded toward the bearded man. "Mr. Florian says it is
charming!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Florian should be at the Court of St. James!" laughed the
girl.</p>

<p>"I prefer to serve in the Temple of Diana," he countered half
insolently, as they strolled toward the door.</p>

<p>Only part of the party could be accommodated in the elevator,
and Larry, Darcy, and Lloyd, with the two Longwoods, waited for the
next trip.</p>

<p>"Awfully glad you could come, old man," said Devereaux. "We
happened to be next to Mrs. Wingate and her crowd, so I had to ask
them to join us."</p>

<p>"Who's the queer-looking man with her?" asked Lloyd of the group
generally.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you know Doctor Dhal?" exclaimed Miss Longwood, an
amiable, horsy-looking young woman. "He's her <i>guru</i>! She has
him around everywhere. She's studying Yogi. So many people are, you
know. She says she never felt so well in her life. She can stand on
her head beautifully."</p>

<p>"Dhal's all the rage," explained Devereaux. "Nobody knows
exactly who he is, but he has got an extraordinary hold on all
sorts of people&mdash;of both sexes. He has two institutions or
sanitariums here, one up-town for women, and one in Wall Street for
the tired business man. You can get your soul into complete
equilibrium for a hundred dollars. Or if you have a sufficiently
white soul and large enough purse, you may be initiated into the
inner mysteries of his order.</p>

<p>"But why does she take him around with her?" innocently asked
Lloyd.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's part of it," explained Darcy. "She's his
<i>chela</i> and can do nothing without his approval. She's way up
in it&mdash;thirty-third degree or whatever it is. Spends most of
her time down at his place on Long Island&mdash;a sort of health
club&mdash;where the members do all the work, cook, scrub the
floors, clean the windows&mdash;very nice for Doctor Dhal!"</p>

<p>"I'd like to see Lulie Wingate down on her knees scrubbing
floors!" exclaimed Miss Longwood. "That would be enough to cure me
of almost anything!"</p>

<p>"And those two boys?" inquired Lloyd. "They seem very
young."</p>

<p>Miss Longwood smiled sardonically.</p>

<p>"Why, they're her '<i>gigolos</i>.' Every elderly rich woman has
a '<i>gigolo</i>' nowadays, and Lulie has two&mdash;besides her
<i>guru</i>&mdash;a complete establishment."</p>

<p>The elevator had returned by this time and it now engulfed them.
Lloyd was crowded into a motor with the Longwoods and the two
"<i>gigolos</i>," and they whirred off across town, drawing up
behind the other machines in front of a low brick house with solid
green shutters. He had a vague impression of being near the river.
Near by a tall chimney poured forth a pillar of velvet smoke.</p>

<p>Diana received them at the door and waved them into a large room
on the ground floor containing an immense low divan, a half-dozen
Italian chairs, a large tapestry, and a teak-wood table covered
with innumerable tin boxes of cigarettes. The studio was already
thick with smoke, and Mr. Florian, at the request of Miss Ricardo,
was playing on the piano some incidental music composed by himself
for a play for which he was painting the scenery. Doctor Dhal was
sitting beside Mrs. Wingate on the divan. None of them seemed to
know exactly why they were there.</p>

<p>"Lulie," cried Miss Longwood, "do get Doctor Dhal to show us
some of his wonderful tricks."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingate looked apprehensively at her companion. Everybody
was clamoring for a wonderful trick. Doctor Dhal smiled
indolently.</p>

<p>"They are only for children," he remarked in a mucilaginous
voice. "They can be bought for a few dollars."</p>

<p>His audience, however, vociferously insisting that they were all
children, demanded a trick. Dhal bent over and said something in a
low tone to his <i>chela</i>.</p>

<p>"My <i>guru</i> asks you to draw up in a close circle and link
elbows," said Mrs. Wingate. "You can tie his hands and feet with
handkerchiefs and three of you must hold him tightly. Then, on the
putting out of the lights, perhaps he will disappear!"</p>

<p>"Let's get in on this!" whispered Longwood to Maitland and
Devereaux, producing a heavy silk handkerchief. Doctor Dhal, his
cigarette hanging from his lips, slowly arose and held out his
short fat arms. The rest made a circle about the four men. Longwood
tied the <i>guru's</i> ankles as tight as he could draw the
handkerchief, fastening it with a double bowline. Lloyd and
Devereaux bound his wrists, pulling the knots until the flesh
bulged on either side.</p>

<p>"Hurt?" demanded Lloyd, noting the clamminess of the skin.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," answered Doctor Dhal. "Now let each of you take
one of my arms. And be sure not to let me get away! Stand
close."</p>

<p>"Got him?" asked Longwood.</p>

<p>"Put out the light," said Doctor Dhal.</p>

<p>Diana pulled the chain of the concealed ceiling light. For a
moment no sound could be heard in the darkness save the excited
breathing of those in the circle around the four men. Then Lloyd
heard a sharp suspiration followed by a groan. The arm which he
held twitched convulsively, but he did not relax his grip.
Something uttered a strange cattish cry, beside and below him. He
felt a hot breath on his neck and two hands grasped him by the
throat. Furious, he clutched at his assailant's head. Yogi or no
Yogi, this was no joke!</p>

<p>"Light!" he choked, and Diana flashed it on.</p>

<p>He found himself struggling fiercely with Longwood. On the floor
beside their feet lay a scattered pile of handkerchiefs. The
<i>guru</i> had vanished. They all gasped with astonishment,
peering stupidly at the place where they had last seen him.</p>

<p>"Here is where you should look!" said Doctor Dhal sweetly, as he
sauntered forward unruffled from the other end of the room, his
cigarette still hanging from his lips.</p>

<p>Diana was watching him intently, her brow drawn into a
frown.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," he said to her familiarly, his eyes holding
hers; then, dropping his voice, he added: "The tantra grows in the
hearts of those that know Brahma; to them all mysteries are known,
and all things are possible."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" ejaculated Miss Longwood. "You ought to be ashamed of
yourself, Bud!"</p>

<p>Her brother grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>"That would come in very handy on occasion!" he replied. "You
certainly put one over that time, doctor."</p>

<p>A faint sneer curled the <i>guru's</i> lips.</p>

<p>"A child's trick!" he said and turned to Miss Ricardo. "Dear
lady, show them what a month of Yogi has done for you."</p>

<p>The company were still standing in the circle they had
originally formed. Miss Ricardo, obediently placing her hands palm
upward one over the other upon the top of her head, bent over until
they touched the floor and, without any apparent difficulty, slowly
raised her legs in the air, and then, after waving them to the
right and left, gradually lowered them to the floor again, amid
expressions of wonder from the onlookers.</p>

<p>Lloyd began to think he must be in a madhouse.</p>

<p>"I feel as light as a feather. I have been taking Doctor Dhal's
exercises only a month," said Miss Ricardo.</p>

<p>"You do it beautifully, but of course you are very light
anyway!" commented Diana. "A heavier person might find it more
difficult."</p>

<p>"Any one who knows Yogi has complete control of the body,"
replied Doctor Dhal. He addressed Mrs. Wingate: "Beloved lady, will
you not also do the exercise?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wingate without hesitation handed Mr. Florian her pearls
and elevated herself upside down in the air, accomplishing the feat
with a disclosure of fascinating pink silk tights.</p>

<p>"Who was it," murmured Darcy to Lloyd significantly, "who said
'We should have respect for gray hairs&mdash;particularly our own
'?"</p>

<p>At that moment Mercedes burst radiantly into the studio, having
discarded her leopard-skin for an elaborate evening dress by no
means as abbreviated as those of the non-professional ladies
present. Diana, putting her arm about the newcomer, led her across
the room to Mrs. Wingate and Miss Ricardo.</p>

<p>"How about going along?" suggested Darcy. "I'm an old man and
it's getting toward morning. If you're going anywhere to dance, why
not begin?"</p>

<p>"There's a room, supper, and three colored artists waiting for
us up at the Croyon," announced Larry. "Why not have some exercise
in which we can all take part? Dancing is viewed with favor by the
Vedas, isn't it, doctor?"</p>

<p>The <i>guru</i> bowed gravely.</p>

<p>"Among all tantriks dancing is regarded as both honorable and
holy, and every temple has its troop of nautch-girls, to whom are
given the greatest reverence and respect."</p>

<p>"Let's go!" cried Diana. "My feet are twitching for that
jazz!"</p>

<p>She shooed them all out and extinguished the lights, locking the
door behind her and putting the key in the pocket of her wrap.</p>

<p>The taxi-drivers, fraternizing under an electric light, tossed
aside their cigarettes and came running to their respective cars.
It was the consensus of their opinion, after comparing their
experiences, that people did not go to out-of-the-way places like
this in the middle of the night for any good purpose. The lights
had been put out&mdash;all had seen it. Rough stuff undoubtedly. A
queer crowd. Well, if the swells went in for that sort of tiling!
Why not either get rid of them or give everybody else a chance!
From Second Avenue came the gathering roar of an elevated train. It
flashed by, dropping a few sparks on the surface tracks below.
Nobody had ever heard of a spark like that starting a fire, but
then perhaps the proper tinder had not been ready.</p>

<p>Behind the newel post of a flight of brownstone steps a
policeman's eye searched the deserted street for lurking shadows.
It caught one&mdash;that of a fat Chinaman with bent head, and
hands folded in his sleeves, padding swiftly toward his scuttle; it
overtook another&mdash;a bedraggled, limp ing figure in a tawdry
hat. The policeman emerging followed this&mdash;alert for a
violation of the "Tenement House Law"&mdash;and came upon Diana's
party. He too wondered what sort of goings-on there had been in
there behind those curtains. He knew what kind of folk were up at
that hour of the night. That was his business.</p>

<p>They were off again, packed in like sardines, Lloyd having
lingered behind in order to be with Diana. He got in last and took
one of the collapsible seats, riding backward opposite her. Since
that day in the blind he had not been able to keep his thoughts
from her, although he did not regard himself as in love. She was
beautiful, she interested him, she piqued his curiosity, she filled
him with a strange exhilaration&mdash;but he knew, or thought he
knew, other things about her that rendered real love out of the
question. One did not fall in love with such a woman.</p>

<p>He did not realize that Diana was one of those women bom to love
and to be loved, who by a singular allurement stimulate the
instincts and enthrall the imagination. She had possessed this
curious charm even as a child and had used it more or less
consciously upon the men with whom she had been thrown. Artists had
wished to paint her. Older men had found pleasure in talking to
her. Little boys had quarrelled over her, they knew not why. For
there escaped from her a palpable radiance, a strange warmth and
perfume, and her lips, delicately mobile and sensuous, drew the eye
and held it, saying as they did so much more than the words they
uttered.</p>

<p>The Croyon was still ablaze when they rolled up to its side
entrance. Through the revolving door drifted the subdued strains of
music&mdash;a coming-out dance the doorkeeper informed them. They
had just got out when another taxi drew up to the curb. An
embarrassed youth, his coat-collar turned up and his tall hat
pushed upon the back of his head, emerged and stood holding the
door of the vehicle open. Maitland was curious to see who else was
in the cab. Then a slim leg appeared below the aperture of the door
and a young girl, her coat hanging from one shoulder, half
stumbled, half fell into the boy's arms.</p>

<p>It was Sheila. Before Maitland could recover from the shock of
this discovery her comrade had lifted her to her feet and pulled
her cloak into position as if she were an automaton. But obviously
there was something the matter with the automaton's machinery, for
she could hardly walk and her eyes were fixed upon some
indeterminate point in space. To protect the girl from the
observation of his associates, Lloyd hastily interposed himself
between her and them.</p>

<p>"Are you all right?" he heard the boy ask uncertainly.</p>

<p>Sheila did not reply, but slowly walked toward the door, feeling
her way, as it seemed. Lloyd kept beside her.</p>

<p>"Miss Kayne!" he said.</p>

<p>She turned a chalky fatuous face to him.</p>

<p>"Oh 's you!" she mumbled. "I'm all 'ight! Had terrible funny
time. So many trees! But they're absolutely nothing to me!
Absolutely nothing! Absolutely&mdash;nothing!"</p>

<p>She swayed and he grasped her arm.</p>

<p>"Come along!" he said. "The party's over. I'll take you
home."</p>

<p>"I'm so sleepy!" she sighed. "An' I don't want to see any more
trees!"</p>

<p>The boy, acknowledging instinctively Maitland's authority,
attempted to give an account of himself.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we only went once around the Park," he stammered. "We
were at the dance and a whole lot of us got taxis and took a
ride."</p>

<p>Sheila's head fell forward.</p>

<p>"I'm so-o sleepy!" she whimpered.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Lloyd of the boy.</p>

<p>"My name's Jones&mdash;Mansfield Jones!" he answered. "She was
all right when she got in. But I saw her take something out of her
bag. It was in a pink box. All of a sudden she began to
talk&mdash;and talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell her sister to come here," he ordered. "That tall girl in
the blue wrap."</p>

<p>The boy darted off relieved at being directed what to do.</p>

<p>A moment later they were rolling up Fifth Avenue, Sheila's inert
form between them, her head lolling on Diana's shoulder. From her
half-open lips came a sickly sweet odor.</p>

<p>"Here's the key," said Diana in a hard voice, and Lloyd hurried
up the brownstone steps and unlocked and pushed open the heavy
door. An electric light burned in the hall inside. It was but a few
hours since he had last seen Sheila there. Her doom had been
visited upon her far more swiftly than he had fancied probable!
Poor kid!</p>

<p>He returned to the cab and together they guided the dazed child
up the steps. On the inner threshold Diana turned to him.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, none of them saw!" she said, looking twenty years
older than he had ever seen her.</p>

<p>It was two o'clock when Lloyd re-entered the house on Irving
Place and climbed wearily up to his room. Two miles away Diana with
haggard face was bending over the little huddled heap in Sheila's
bed. The room was in an incredible state of disorder, clothes lying
about everywhere upon the floor, drawers half open. The child was
sleeping profoundly.</p>

<p>Diana opened her vanity bag. There was the usual "Dorine,"
lip-stick, puff, mirror, a ten-dollar bill, two one-dollar bills,
three silver half-dollars&mdash;for tips&mdash;a tiny pad and
pencil, a latch-key, and a pink-enamelled silver box containing
four white tablets.</p>

<p>Her eye swept the bureau, searched the top drawer, flashed to
the mantel, where lay three garishly bound books dealing with the
practices of Yogi and various forms of Hindoo philosophy and
religion, the titles of which she did not pause to take in.</p>

<p>She went into the adjoining bathroom and turned on the light.
The silver-plated mirror of the medicine-closet above the
wash-basin was ajar, and on its lower shelf was crowded a row of
bottles of all sizes&mdash;a medical zoo. Diana was unfamiliar with
drugs but she recognized a blue bottle of crystals of bromide, a
can of ether, a large vial of aromatic spirits of ammonia, a bottle
of "Kaufman's Anodyne," and a small jar without a label containing
tablets similar to those in the bag. These last she confiscated,
together with those in the enamelled box.</p>

<p>As she returned this empty to the bag a card fluttered to the
floor. She picked it up. It was one of her mother's dinner-cards,
bearing the heavy gold crest that had been adopted by the Kaynes.
On it were the words: "Mr. Maitland."</p>

<p>Diana, with a last look at her sister's motionless form, turned
off the light and closed the door of Sheila's room, feeling as she
stood outside upon the landing as if she had just left a chamber of
death. She had received the severest shock of her life. Unnerved,
her muscles trembling, she paced her unlighted room, incapable of
undressing, sleep out of the question. The spectacle of Sheila
under the influence of a drug, mumbling like an insane person,
without self-control, at the mercy of the first stranger who might
have passed, filled her with a horror that excluded any possibility
of her ordinary interrogation as to why a thing should not be done
if the doer were willing to take the consequences.</p>

<p>This was her own sister&mdash;flesh of her flesh&mdash;yet what
had she ever done for her to help her to run straight? She had
looked contemptuously upon her father and mother, but was she any
better? Not a bit! She had scoffed at their dulness, their
snobbishness, their egotism, their materialism&mdash;although she
had not called it that&mdash;but she herself was just as stupid, as
sordid, even more selfish than they were. What sort of sister had
she been?</p>

<p>It was not what she had done so much as what she had not done
that had contributed to this catastrophe. Surely <i>she</i>, far
better than her father and mother, knew the sort of temptations
girls were subjected to in these days. But she had never uttered a
word of warning or advice to Sheila, had not stretched forth a
finger to keep her from plunging over the cliff&mdash;had been
ready to let her go. Her negligence was criminal.</p>

<p>She perceived that she was not indifferent to Sheila, as she had
thought, but that she loved her and that her love was something
real. It was because of that love that she now stood there pressing
her fists to her temples in an agony of self-reproach. Had she
acknowledged that love before, this awful thing would not have
happened to her sister and she herself would not be suffering the
recriminations of that conscience whose sanction she had denied.
What difference did it make about the origin of that silent voice?
She could not escape it. The fact of its existence transcended any
theory or doubt concerning it. And if love were a real thing like
that, perhaps, as well, were those other things which she had
derided, that love demanded&mdash;self-sacrifice and the rest.</p>

<p>All her life she had insisted on being shown; and in what she
could not see she had refused to believe. Let metaphysicians
speculate and saints see visions; she would accept only what she
could know through her senses! She was an independent human
being&mdash;brought into the world without her
will&mdash;acknowledging no responsibilities&mdash;a law unto
herself!</p>

<p>This hypothesis now fell with a crash about her. Independent?
Irresponsible? As what? The vagabond winds? The quenchless planets?
The meteor's trailing fire? The drifting clouds? The flickering
northern lights? The thunder and the rain?&mdash;Nothing in the
universe was independent of anything else. Everything was subject
to immutable laws that controlled each vagrant breath of wind, each
prismatic drop falling from cataract, wave-crest or shower, each
wandering planet and plunging star, each vibration of the thunder,
each dancing flicker from the electric north! And each was bound
unto each and to all else in nature, each in some mysterious way
was necessary to the whole, and each obedient to the eternal laws
under which it came into being.</p>

<p>She knew it, but how did she know it? How could she recognize
these laws? She could touch the waves and satisfy herself of their
existence, but she could not touch the tide; she could smell the
grass but she could not smell the spring; she could see the moon
but not the force that held it in the sky! All were
inferential.</p>

<p>She did not question the orbit of the earth around the sun, the
precession of the equinoxes, the coming of the harvest, the pull of
the magnetic pole that infallibly dragged the compass needle to the
north, the electric power that turned the dynamo. She could not see
any of them, but she acknowledged them all readily enough. Was love
any less real than magnetism? Certainly it exerted as great an
influence. That we could not explain the origin of what we called
electricity did not lead us to question its existence or its power.
We called magnetism a physical fact. Why was it any more of a
physical fact than love? Was there any difference between the
physical and the spiritual? If so, what was it? Was not a cruel
word as deadly as a knife thrust? Were not loyalty and sympathy,
the love of liberty and truth, just as real in every way as
anything else in nature, and was not love a law of nature?</p>

<p>She had disobeyed those laws in her neglect of Sheila, and both
her sister and herself were suffering the inevitable consequences.
That her father and mother had likewise neglected those laws
neither affected her own responsibility nor the results of her
having disregarded it. Both&mdash;all of them&mdash;were guilty.
Who was she that she should defy the laws of the universe&mdash;of
life&mdash;whether they were called physical or spiritual?</p>

<p>She groped her way to the window and looked out eastward across
the chimney-pots. Low over the horizon defying the coming dawn
blazed the morning star. For a moment she thought it must be a huge
electric light on the apex of some distant tower. Then she realized
that this could not be so.</p>

<p>This glittering orb was no human fabrication. Whatever
mysterious force had created the universe had hung it there. It
threw a soft effulgence&mdash;a path of star-dust&mdash;through the
window to her feet. And it seemed almost like a lighted lamp set in
the window of the sky and illuminating the darkness of her
mind.</p>

<p>Just as half a century before the old pirate, her grandfather,
had got religion on the back platform of the "Zarazota"
side-tracked in the Denver yards, and had thrown himself on his
knees beside his brass bed and called upon God to keep his soul
and, should he die, to take it to himself&mdash;so Diana, cynic as
hitherto she had been&mdash;self-sufficient, contumacious,
defiant&mdash;now experienced a change of heart somewhat akin to
the conversion of old Peter.</p>

<p>She did not fall upon her knees and stretch out her arms to the
Almighty. She did not call upon Christ as the pirate had done fifty
years before. She stood silent, with her hands clasped upon her
breast, gazing at the star.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter 14. Rufus "Goes Bad"</h2>

<p>Diana watched the star slowly set behind the chimney-pots of the
dty. It was as if the lamp to which she had likened it in her
imagination had been gradually extinguished. A curtain seemed to
have been drawn down across the heavens. Darkness descended upon
her spirit.</p>

<p>She threw herself upon her bed trying to snatch a few moments of
sleep and, when at last she succeeded in losing consciousness, she
saw Sheila, her eyes bandaged with a handkerchief, dancing straight
toward the edge of a precipice at the foot of which she knew lay
Claudia. She herself was somewhere about and she could hear herself
saying: "Let her go! What difference does it make?" Then in some
mysterious way Sheila disappeared and there was left only the
handkerchief, which floated down&mdash;down&mdash;toward
trees&mdash;infinite in
number&mdash;grotesque&mdash;horrible&mdash;yet "terribly
funny"&mdash;that "meant absolutely nothing"&mdash;"ab-solutely
nothing!" while Doctor Dhal stood on his head near by and chanted
glutinously: "Let her go! Let her go! Let her go!"</p>

<p>She awoke and found herself sitting up in bed shivering. In the
east a pale efflorescence made a background for the sky-line. She
recalled the last time she had seen the dawn. It had been down at
Treasure Island in November in the blind at "The Tam" with Lloyd.
The thought of him now gave her courage; just as the sight of the
star had given her hope. He had been right.</p>

<p>How decent of him not to have thrown her own words back in her
teeth. "Silly kids!" Never again would that expression pass her
lips. If only she had paid some attention to Claudia! Given her a
word or two of sisterly advice!</p>

<p>Even as she sat there staring out of the window the east grew
brighter. Yes, the dawn was coming&mdash;a new day&mdash;an
entirely new day! She ceased shivering and lay back upon her
pillow. Peace took possession of her. When she came to herself the
room was bright with sunlight.</p>

<p>She arose, rang for her maid, bathed, dressed, and dr ank a cup
of coffee. Then she went downstairs to Sheila's room. The child was
lying upon her back, half awake.</p>

<p>"Hello, Di!" she murmured drowsily. "You're up early."</p>

<p>Diana kissed her and sat down upon the bed&mdash;something she
had not done for years. Sheila gazed at her surprised.</p>

<p>It was clear that she remembered nothing of the occurrences of
the night before. Her recollection stopped with her leaving the
dance to go for her taxi ride with the others. The drug had
obliterated everything else. Against the white pillow her face
looked yellow&mdash;like that of a little old woman.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Diana, "where did you get the drug you took last
night?"</p>

<p>A look of terror came into the child's face.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't take any drug!" she answered in a thick voice.
"How can you say such a thing! It's horrid of you!"</p>

<p>Diana laid her cool hand on her sister's forehead.</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?" she repeated gently. "How long have you
been taking it? Tell me the truth. I'm going to stand back of you
and we'll fight this thing out together!"</p>

<p>She put her arms around the girl and laid her own head upon the
pillow beside her. Sheila, starved for want of family affection,
was melted. Sobbing, she pressed her face to her sister's.</p>

<p>"Oh, Di!" she moaned, clinging wildly to her, "oh, Di! If only
I'd had you before!"</p>

<p>"Never mind!" answered Diana, "you've got me now, and you'll
always have me&mdash;as long as I live. I swear it!"</p>

<p>Gradually Diana learned the story. She couldn't stand the pace
going out night after night, Sheila said, and first had tried to
stimulate herself with tea and coffee, but this had given her
headache and made her sleepless. Some girls could come home from a
dance and sleep right through until noon the next day. But she
couldn't. As soon as it got light she woke up and couldn't go to
sleep again at all. She was naturally sleepless and this was
intensified by excitement, she supposed. So she had resorted, at
the suggestion of a friend, to bromide. This had accomplished the
purpose for a week or two but soon ceased to have any effect.</p>

<p>A drug clerk had recommended "Kaufman's Anodyne," and she had
tried that. But it was not enough. Almost ready to jump out of her
skin with lack of sleep, bodily fatigue, and nerves, she had
experimented unsuccessfully with ether. That had brought her to
cocaine. She had only taken it once&mdash;the night before.</p>

<p>"But where did you get the stuff?" demanded Diana.</p>

<p>Sheila turned away her head.</p>

<p>"Don't make me tell you!" she begged. "It isn't fair! Please,
don't!"</p>

<p>"But you must tell me!" insisted Diana. "It isn't fair to the
others if you don't!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, if I've got to tell," answered her sister, "Cecily
Marden's mother hired a woman to take Cecily out at night and wait
for her&mdash;a sort of 'accommodating maid,' you know&mdash;and
she carries it round and sells it at dances. The girls buy it from
her. She charges ten dollars for a dozen pills or she'll sell you a
whole bottle for fifty. I got it from her&mdash;last evening in the
dressing-room at the Croyon. You say you want 'bicarbonate of
soda.'"</p>

<p>Diana shuddered. What an escape&mdash;if it was an escape!</p>

<p>"But you won't tell anybody&mdash;father or mother&mdash;will
you!" begged Sheila. "If you won't, I'll do anything you
say&mdash;promise you anything!"</p>

<p>"What you need is to get yourself into decent physical
condition," declared Diana as she rose to go, after making Sheila
agree to take no medicine of any sort without a doctor's
prescription. "You're in frightful shape! You ought to give up
lunches, matinees, and movies, and take some open-air exercise. Why
don't you skate? Or, anyhow go to a gym a couple of times a week.
Limit your number of dances. They're all alike and most of them
probably bore you to death. And cut out cocktails and cigarettes. I
know you'll laugh at me for that! But I do, whenever I feel the
least bit seedy or am going on a shooting trip. The first thing is
to get thoroughly rested. I want you to stay in bed until after
lunch to-day&mdash;sleep or no sleep, understand? And then go and
take grandfather for a run in the motor. No fox-trotting to-night.
Bed at nine. And old Doctor Di will call in again to-morrow
morning. You'll be all right!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Diana!" cried Sheila, giving her a hug. "You are a wonder!
I'll do exactly as you say. Tell grandfather I'll be up there to
get him at three o'clock and that we'll go out to the Bronx to see
the new birds. Um-m!" she stretched. "I feel as if I were going to
have a real holiday!"</p>

<p>Rufus Kayne breakfasted downstairs that morning,&mdash;as he
usually did when he had not been up too late,&mdash;and when at
about ten o'clock he descended his brownstone steps no one, not
even Jarmon, would have suspected that he was anything but a
contented man.</p>

<p>It is true that the night before the butler had clocked off five
glasses of champagne, one of sherry and two of Madeira, in addition
to the double cocktail he had privately served upstairs in the
dressing-room before dinner, but his master, in spite of a slight
fustiness remotely prophetic of a headache to come, nevertheless
appeared to him unusually fit. Accordingly Jarmon had taken the
opportunity to inform him that he had been obliged to give the
young footman notice for getting intoxicated. The miscreant was, at
that moment, lying upstairs in his room in a drunken stupor and he
was only waiting for him to come to himself to pack him off.</p>

<p>"Quite right, Jarmon," commended Rufus. "We can't have that sort
of thing here. Get another man as soon as you can."</p>

<p>Thus domestic justice took its course, for owing to having been
gassed, the footman had been unable to withstand the effect of the
glass of champagne remaining in the last bottle at the end of the
dinner.</p>

<p>It was one of those ineffably blue mornings that come to
American seaboard cities, and a film of light snow lingered here
and there upon the pavement of Fifth Avenue. Ten years ago,
reflected Rufus, some idiot would have been jingling up to the Park
in a cutter toward McGowan's Pass Tavern and the "magnum" awarded
annually to the first adventurer to reach it on runners.</p>

<p>Champagne! It always gave him a headache. Why did he drink the
stuff? Only because it was forbidden. Since prohibition had come in
he had felt it a moral obligation to let slip no opportunity to
take a drink&mdash;and then another. Yet he had always been a
moderate drinker, just as he had, from a strong preservative
instinct, always been moderate in everything.</p>

<p>Like Clive, he was often tempted to wonder at that moderation in
view of the unlimited opportunity for profligacy afforded him by
his wealth. For Rufus Kayne was a rich man, and apart from his
salary of fifty thousand a year as president of the Utopia Trust
Company, his income ran well over another hundred. But always his
natural caution had led him to postpone the indulgence of his
occasional furtive impulses to let him self go, in spite of what he
saw other men of his type doing and what he knew they did unseen.
Later on, likely enough&mdash;in that confidently expected but
always slowly receding period of relaxation in time to
come,&mdash;in Paris or in some foreign city, perhaps, when he
would be unobserved,&mdash;even sooner, doubtless, if anything
should happen to Elizabeth. But in the meantime in his prominent
position in Wall Street and society it would be unseemly and
dangerous.</p>

<p>Recently, however, it had often come to him that, after all,
maybe he was a fool not to seize his chance before it should be too
late. Fifteen years of vitality at the most was all that was left
to him; and here he was living just as continently as when he had
married the pink-skinned Elizabeth. More so! Imagine a fellow with
a hundred and fifty thousand a year living like a Trappist monk!
Poverty&mdash;labor&mdash;chastity. He laughed grimly. What a
world! There was the old man once worth his five millions sitting
up in the Ramble in Central Park with Unde Billy and feeding
peanuts to the squirrels; and here was he&mdash;Rufus
Kayne&mdash;with all the wealth of an Eastern potentate and an
equal opportunity to gratify his natural appetites, working like a
dog and living a life of humdrum domesticity with a woman who had
allowed herself to run to seed at thirty-five. Terracotta! That
awful dinner the evening before had finished him. Diana's truancy
had been the last straw.</p>

<p>He had been absolutely sincere in his question to Mr. Pepperill:
"Do you think anybody cares two cents any longer what anybody
does?" He knew no one really did, in spite of the emphasis of the
old lawyer's opinion and that of the Reverend Roderick Thrum.
Everybody, inclu ding Thrum himself, was fully aware that Senator
Krass had been married three times and that at least two of his
wives were still alive. Yet, because the facts surrounding his
various divorces were not presented to the vestry of St. Timothy's
in affidavit form, he was permitted to go on giving lecterns and
anything else he liked. The whole thing was "bunk."</p>

<p>More than that; this being compelled to live with a woman after
you had ceased to love her was cruel to both and a wickedly immoral
thing. People had believed in it once&mdash;no doubt about that.
They had believed in it during the period while he was making his
career. But all that was gone. He had nothing to show for his
self-restraint. He knew well enough what he would do if he had his
chance over again!</p>

<p>He felt that he had been cheated out of a good time. It was like
working all your life to own a house on Madison Square and then
finding that everybody had moved on up to Murray Hill. Now
everybody was way up above Fifty-ninth Street, and still moving. By
the time society reached One Hundred and Tenth, perhaps polygamy
would be openly condoned, if it were not then the correct thing. He
had been bom twenty years too soon. And the irony of it all was
that the younger men were doing what they pleased without any
comeback.</p>

<p>There was that boy Fannin of the Oriental Trust&mdash;divorced
by his wife for living with a chorus girl&mdash;married again and
still cheerfully doing business at the old stand. A coming man! And
Wigton of the Aurora&mdash;and Newman of the Cottonseed
National&mdash;both divorced and remarried. He mentally ran over
the names of some twenty of the men active in financial affairs
with whom he was most frequently thrown&mdash;thirteen were
divorced, a fair proportion of them with considerable scandal. Yet
nobody cared.</p>

<p>Why not get on board the joy-wagon before it was too late? Ten
years hence there would be no better chance to enjoy himself than
there was now. Everything would be exactly the same in 1931 as in
1921. He'd be coming down the same old steps feeling in just the
same old way&mdash;if he was there at all!</p>

<p>The air had the brilliant dryness of high places and across the
avenue came the mellow boom of the cathedral bells. He wondered
what festival or saint's day it was&mdash;more bunk! The church
business was the worst of all&mdash;he could hardly bear any longer
to go through with it. A senior warden and an utter agnostic,
mumbling prayers and creeds that he did not believe. He wondered
what Thrum&mdash;way down in his heart&mdash;really believed, or if
he believed anything. He doubted it. And he recalled the ancient
saw to the effect that all wise men believe the same thing, but no
wise man ever tells what it is. A true saying!</p>

<p>As for honesty being the best policy&mdash;there was nothing in
it and nobody for a single instant supposed that there was. The
only commandment one could not afford to ignore was the eleventh.
So long as a man stole enough, the world would hail him with
enthusiasm and struggle for a seat at his table. Nobody pretended
to be honest in the old-fashioned sense any longer. Suppose you
told the truth about your underwritings? Or your bonuses and
commissions? Or your political contributions or the money that was
paid out in legalized blackmail? The irresponsible accounts carried
for bosses and public officers? The items concealed in the profit
and loss account? Or the facts underlying the euphemisms in your
income-tax returns?</p>

<p>He walked on briskly, nodding occasionally to some one he knew,
hiding the gnawing dissatisfaction with himself and his life that
recently had grown almost desperate. He had realized for a long
time that there was nothing in what he had worked so hard to get,
that now that he had all the money he wanted there was nothing for
him to spend it on, that nothing really mattered, that his
so-called social position amounted to no more than that of a wax
figure in a tailor's window.</p>

<p>But he had not realized its full futility until the evening
before. Was it Mrs. Brice-Brewster or his brother-in-law Ward
Mallory, the dour collector of death-masks, Homer Graham, or that
little chattering idiot of a Follansbee? Was it any single one of
those stuffed parrots or the whole flock of them? Or was it the
fact that his own daughter had deliberately&mdash;as he
supposed&mdash;absented herself from his table? Well! Let her go
with her smart friends if his weren't good enough for her! Even
Sheila had only waited for the coffee to be served before hurrying
off with Rachel to a dance somewhere&mdash;or was it the Revels or
Scandals?</p>

<p>But at that the frivolity of the young was nothing to the
frivolity of the old! What was the world coming to, anyway, when
even old women like his sister Bridget Mallory bobbed their
hair&mdash;he thought it was bobbed&mdash;exposed their lean arms
to the shoulders&mdash;wore skirts up to their knees? Bah! A good
joke to work all your life for this and then have your children
turn up their noses at it!</p>

<p>A flaxen-haired, poorly dressed girl with corn-flower eyes
glanced sideways at him and half smiled as she walked past. His
blood quickened. After all, he was only fifty-five! Why shouldn't
he take what he could get? Why hadn't he had the courage to be
independent and express his own individuality? What was public
opinion, anyhow? He'd paid to have it
manufactured&mdash;"accelerated," as the slang was&mdash;again and
again. They had a regular publicity man on the trust company's
pay-roll.</p>

<p>This idea that everybody had his eyes fixed upon you all the
time was rot. People were too busy thinking of themselves. So long
as you did not cost them money you could do as you liked. The only
people who took any interest in you or your conduct were those to
whom you were personally known. These people&mdash;who might
possibly care&mdash;were scattered all around&mdash;unrelated and
disconnected individuals. If you squared them either by persuasion
or by purchase, there was nobody left to be afraid of. A strong man
could defy them, anyhow. If you were emphatic enough, you could get
away with anything&mdash;put them all in the Ananias Club. The
world liked a real man who was not afraid of it.</p>

<p>Rufus looked back over his shoulder but the girl had turned down
a side street&mdash;given him up. His step became a trifle defiant.
Already he felt a freer man. When he reached the motor waiting for
him in front of the Public Library he paused and lit a second cigar
before getting in.</p>

<p>The Utopia Trust Company is a grand affair of marble and
polished steel, mahogany and Kurdistan rugs, time-locks, old-young
men and trim, discreet girls. One of these last arose from her desk
in the glass-partitioned anteroom outside his door as Rufus entered
his office, picked up a red-leather note-book and followed him in.
It occurred to him that he had never before really appreciated Miss
Dolan's figure. What was there about these women who earned their
own living&mdash;did something? Why wasn't Elizabeth more like
that? Elizabeth! But she never had been like that! He noted the
girl's alert carriage, the charming simplicity of her plain,
dark-blue skirt and white shirt-waist, the way in which her small
round head rose on the slender reed of her neck like a flower, the
smoothness of her skin, the length of the dark fringes veiling her
brown eyes. Yet he realized that it was in none of these things
that her lure lay. It was because she was "all
there"&mdash;alive&mdash;on her toes, speaking his language,
responsive, ready to deliver the best of herself.</p>

<p>Miss Dolan replied to his greeting without looking at him. His
mail was already opened and arranged for his inspection, but he did
not examine it. Instead, his gaze continued to linger upon the
graceful stenographer. Shape, he concluded, was more important than
face. But besides having a form like Hebe's, this young creature
was pretty as a girl on a magazine cover. A pippin! Earning two
thousand a year and entirely dependent for her livelihood upon his
fancy. His Christian slave! The slave opened the scarlet note-book
and appeared to glance at the exposed page&mdash;a mere matter of
form, as she knew all his engagements by heart.</p>

<p>"You have nothing until eleven-thirty, when you have to meet Mr.
Stein and Mr. Savoy at Mr. Pepperill's office," said Miss Dolan in
a detached voice. "But there is the regular board meeting at
twelve-fifteen. Shall I take any letters now? Or will you go over
your mail first?"</p>

<p>She had lowered her head to look at the book in her hand and now
she raised her eyes without changing its position. They were large
and full of implications. Rufus looked back at her. His income
would support seventy-five such young persons in idleness. The
fancy amused him. He recalled a song he had heard in a vulgar
musical show: "The Turk Had the Right Idea!" Rufus was no
simpleton. A man cannot rise to the presidency of a trust company
and be one. A girl like this was not the kind to fall for a drink,
a dinner, or a diamond ring, but&mdash;how about ten thousand
dollars a year?</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;have I a lunch engagement?" he stammered.</p>

<p>She shook her head, meaning "no."</p>

<p>"M-m," she said. It was her only inelegance, and with its
suggestion of intimacy it seemed&mdash;in her&mdash;childish and
rather appealing. He wondered what she would do if he told her to
write down: "One o'clock. Lunch with Miss Dolan."</p>

<p>For an instant he was tempted to try it; then his common sense
intervened. No, better keep his hands off the office. The town was
full of women looking for trouble. Later, if he didn't find
anything elsewhere, he could come back. She would be
there&mdash;right on the pay-roll.</p>

<p>"Never mind," he muttered. "I'll read my mail, I guess."</p>

<p>His eyes lingered on hers for still another instant. As she
turned away, Miss Dolan smiled&mdash;ever so slightly, but
enough.</p>

<p>He felt rejuvenated. He would take his time&mdash;look around.
Eleven-thirty came before he knew it and he hurried across the
street to Pepperill's office to find the others already there and
waiting for him&mdash;the old lawyer rather impatiently, for he did
not approve of the trust company launching out as it was doing even
if technically within its charter powers.</p>

<p>The business in hand was a loan from the Utopia to Messrs. Stein
and Savoy in their capacity as moving-picture producers, one of
their many enterprises in the amusement field. Stein had an
extraordinary way of inspiring confidence in people, largely
because of his taciturnity. He rarely said anything, letting others
do the talking, and was reputed to have made several fortunes. He
was big, fish-faced, pop-eyed, imperturbable, and whenever a
hippodrome, opera-house, theatre, casino, or moving-picture company
went on the rocks he salvaged it, taking most of the stock. There
was hardly any large project dedicated to the entertainment and
recuperation of the tired business man from New York to San
Francisco&mdash;or as Savoy, his <i>alter ego</i>, preferred to put
it, "From Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon"&mdash;in which they
had not a finger.</p>

<p>Savoy, <i>né</i> Lefkowitz, now an individual theatrical
producer, had made his first money as a speculator surreptitiously
hawking tickets from Long Acre Square doorways&mdash;but aided by a
real flair for finance and a first-hand knowledge of what the
public wanted, he had pushed his way into the front rank of
Broadway potentates in less than fifteen years, changed his name,
married the most beautiful chorus girl seen on the Rialto in two
generations, made a few millions, helped a Wall Street banker or so
to make others, and had in consequence been taken up by society. He
and his wife had been feted and made much of, until by an
extraordinary fillip of fortune's penny, they were on familiar
terms with a set that Rufus himself would have given much to
know.</p>

<p>Savoy was still a comparatively young man&mdash;sallow, smooth,
insinuating&mdash;and Rufus, impressed by his ability and by his
friendship with certain persons in high social places, had financed
several business deals for him. Stein and he were now about to
amalgamate several moving-picture concerns, and against Mr.
Pepperill's protest Rufus had orally agreed that the trust company
should advance a million dollars to put the new corporation upon
its feet, provided the notes should be secured by the individual
indorsements of both promoters. The loan was to be secured by a
mortgage on the realty of the combining companies, and the issue
was to consist of ten notes, each for one hundred thousand dollars,
the first payable May 1, 1922, the others at intervals of three
months.</p>

<p>The two promoters, Krabfleisch, their lawyer, and Maitland were
waiting, but Rufus, being informed at the door that Mr. Pepperill
would like to see him before the conference, stepped into the
latter's office. The old lawyer, who had just finished going over
the papers, looked up at his client over his glasses and remarked
querulously:</p>

<p>"See here, Kayne, I don't know that I much fancy a trust company
with which I am connected going into the moving-picture business.
Somehow, it doesn't seem exactly like banking. You'll be
manufacturing baby-carriages next! Can't you call this thing
off?"</p>

<p>Kayne shook his head.</p>

<p>"We've got to do something with our money. You know the
condition of the railroads and what European trade amounts
to&mdash;there isn't any. Do you realize we've got over twenty
millions surplus? What's the matter with baby-carriages? Couldn't
we make them under our charter? You drew it. You ought to
know."</p>

<p>He was feeling rather bobbish. Mr. Pepperill observed this fact
and scowled.</p>

<p>"Under your charter you could finance an expedition to colonize
the North Pole! I saw to that&mdash;out of abundant caution. But
that's not saying you had better do it. Who knows what's going to
happen to this movie business? The bottom might drop out of it any
minute."</p>

<p>"It's the third biggest industry in the United States," replied
Kayne. "And the Alpha-Omega is a consolidation of several of the
strongest companies. The loan is individually guaranteed' by both
Mr. Stein and Mr. Savoy and secured by a first mortgage on all the
property&mdash;valued at six millions."</p>

<p>"Six million fiddlesticks!" retorted the lawyer disgustedly. "A
mortgage on a lot of hothouses! I'd rather take a chance on
something that was actually <i>ultra vires</i> than go into any
such silly amusement enterprise. It isn't respectable&mdash;or, at
any rate, not reputable. These fellows go through bankruptcy just
as you might drink a cocktail. I don't like the crowd."</p>

<p>The banker shrugged his shoulders. He had heard the same line of
argument many times.</p>

<p>"Well," he answered shortly, "I'm responsible. If we can do it
under our charter powers, we'll do it. Are the papers all
right?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill, without replying, collected his documents, arose
and walked stiffly to the door, where again he paused and faced
Rufus.</p>

<p>"I want to say once more," he declared huskily, "that whatever
its purely legal aspect may be, I don't approve of this loan! It's
not good business and if it becomes public it is bound to subject
the trust company to unfavorable criticism. I mean this
seriously."</p>

<p>Rufus was annoyed. He did not regard the propriety of the loan
as any concern of Mr. Pepperill's.</p>

<p>"The loan is going to be made!" he retorted. "But if you feel
that way I'll personally guarantee the notes myself. Nobody can
criticise that!"</p>

<p>"That is only beating the devil around the stump!" answered the
lawyer. "The loan is not a proper loan, in my opinion."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," replied Rufus drily. "But my opinion, not yours,
controls."</p>

<p>"As you please," said Mr. Pepperill, and stalked out before his
client.</p>

<p>The group in the conference-room arose upon his entry.</p>

<p>"The papers seem to be correct," he remarked briefly. "Have you
got the notes?"</p>

<p>Mr. Krabfleisch handed him a sheaf of oblong papers, and Mr.
Pepperill counted them and turned them over to Kayne, who, having
added his own name with a fountain pen to the indorsements upon
each one, produced a certified check for a million dollars and gave
it to Mr. Stein. The latter gentleman, such transactions being, as
it were, matters of ordinary occurrence with him, barely glanced at
it and placed it in a thick wallet.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said after he had returned this casually to his
inside pocket, "that's all, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperill went back to his office, while Maitland and
Krabfleisch compared copies of the various documents.</p>

<p>"How about some lunch?" suggested Mr. Stein to Kayne. "I can run
you up to the Croyon in twenty minu tes and we can talk more
business maybe." He turned to his associate: "Better join us,
Tad!"</p>

<p>There was to Rufus, the business man of stereotyped habits,
something exhilarating and slightly surreptitious in abandoning his
office and slipping off up-town to a gay restaurant in the middle
of the working-day; and this feeling was intensified, not only by
the size of Mr. Stein's red-panelled motor with its brocaded
wallcovering and nodding artificial flowers, but by the averted
faces of the traffic policemen at sight of its mysterious license
number. Clearly the fellow had pull.</p>

<p>The pull was again manifest upon their arrival at the Croyon,
where Rheinart, in spite of a waiting throng, instantly conducted
them to a choicely located table; and by the discovery that his
bouillon cup camouflaged a Bronx. He noted several acquaintances at
the various tables who he had always assumed never lunched above
Fulton Street. The atmosphere was one of studied vivacity and showy
smartness, but to Rufus, after his evening with Mrs. Brice-Brewster
and her supporting company, it had the dash and sparkle of a
careless aristocracy at carnival.</p>

<p>This impression was undisturbed by the obvious fact that the
gathering was not eclectic. Apparently everybody, not only whom he
had ever known but had ever heard of, was there. Plainly he was the
only one so stupid as to lunch monotonously down-town every day. It
was an auspicious beginning to his era of romance!</p>

<p>His eye ran along the tables appraisingly&mdash;perhaps the
unknown she might even now be lunching there. He hardly listened to
what Stein and Savoy were saying. At first he had had a vague
uneasiness over being seen with them&mdash;especially
Stein&mdash;but this soon changed to complacency. To his surprise
they seemed to be on familiar terms with all the smartest people
there&mdash;much more so than himself. It was not long before he
learned the reason. Through the Steins, the Savoys and their like,
the smart people found contact with the am using crowd of stage
beauties, matinée idols, clever playwrights and composers,
opera-singers, comediennes, and all the rest who went to make up
that bizarre, wicked, but entrancing, world of Broadway, and whose
society was now eagerly sought by the most fastidious of Fifth
Avenue hostesses because they "did something."</p>

<p>Rufus began to perceive that already the door stood half-way
open into an enchanted and joyous land of gay abandonment. His
chance to slip gracefully in came even more quickly than he had
dared to hope. Two tables away a girl, whose profile had all along
attracted him, turned at a remark from her companion, and tossed a
smile of recognition in their direction.</p>

<p>"I wondered if she'd notice us," remarked Stein.</p>

<p>"Nothing gets by little Mercedes!" answered Savoy. "That reminds
me&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He jotted something on the back of a menu and handed it to a
waiter to take to her. Miss Mercedes received and read it. Then
borrowing the waiter's pencil, she scribbled:</p>

<p class="letter">"Am I coming? Sure! With bells on! M."</p>

<p>Savoy blew her a kiss.</p>

<p>"I'm having a little party Sunday night and I hadn't heard from
yon proud beauty. I've asked Larry Devereaux and Dick Darcy and one
or two others. Care to come? Glad to have you, if you've nothing
more interesting on."</p>

<p>Rufus tried to be equally casual as he replied that he'd like to
come if he hadn't anything on&mdash;he'd ask his secretary when he
returned to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. Stein called for the bill, paid it, and they got up. The
tables were emptying rapidly, owing to the approach of the
theatre-hour. On their way to the door they came face to face with
Diana and Darcy. Miss Kayne nodded familiarly to the other two.</p>

<p>"Hello, Al! Hello, Tad!"</p>

<p>Then regarding her father with an air of quizzical disapproval,
she concluded:</p>

<p>"And hello, pa-pa!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter 15. A Real Party</h2>

<p>Rufus, as might have been foreseen, managed to adjust his
engagements so that he was able to attend Mr. Savoy's party the
following Sunday night. This was not difficult, for Elizabeth was
going to the Jameses, who were having an affair of their own, the
attraction being a colored missionary from Mozambique.</p>

<p>Rufus had balked at the color line&mdash;an excellent excuse;
but Edna had succeeded in entan g lin g Maitland as well as Mrs.
Brice-Brewster, Homer Graham and the Krasses. The Jameses, in fact,
were rather too fond of startling their dinner-guests by producing
out of the tall hat of their hospitality an unexpected rabbit in
the shape of a Hindoo, a Chinaman, an Ethiope, or a Christianized
cannibal, who could entertain them all afterward with strange
gurgling songs, syncopated with roars and grunts and accompanied by
the rattle of castanets made of human bones&mdash;for there is
fashion even in philanthropy.</p>

<p>Providence having thus smiled upon his enterprise, Rufus donned
his dress clothes and fared forth upon his second blooming. The
primrose path&mdash;he had yielded the motor to his wife for the
evening with relief&mdash;led straight to Broadway. He felt, in
spite of himself, as he joined the crowds pouring from the movie
palaces, a little out of place&mdash;the people were a pretty cheap
lot, he thought&mdash;shoddy against the scintillating kaleidoscope
of the flashing signs. Such radiance should fall only upon brave
men and beautiful women, who presumably would not use the
pavements.</p>

<p>Mr. Savoy's apartment proved to be over a famous restaurant, but
it was none the less elegant for that, and the convenient
juxtaposition enabled its owner to entertain easily and
promiscuously. The beautiful women and brave men were all there
when Rufus arrived, and the negro who took his tall hat gave him,
in exchange, a soiled check numbered "189."</p>

<p>Rufus, fluttered as a girl at her first dance, regretted that he
had not realized the informal character of the gathering and worn a
dinner-jacket, like the other men. He stood stiffly in the doorway
looking for his host, very much in the way.</p>

<p>In one room dancing was going on, the guests resting
occasionally to watch some vaudeville favorite do his or her latest
stunt. Opening out of this was a buffet with a bar&mdash;"wide
open" and crowded. In the other rooms&mdash;some well lighted,
others not so much so&mdash;couples came and went or sat in
secluded nooks, or gay groups told stories to one another. Indeed,
the side-shows seemed to be more popular than the main tent, and
competition among the performers was often such that some of them
were with difficulty restrained from interrupting the offerings of
others to give the company the benefit of their own.</p>

<p>The effusiveness of the greetings, the back-slapping, the
"hello, dearies," and the inevitable suffix of "sweetheart" and
"darling," the way they all patted and pawed and hung on to one
another, embarrassed Rufus. From time to time some celebrated diva
would make an appearance, calling attention to her entrance by
throwing her arms violently about the neck of a no less famous
manager or producer. There was a noticeably Semitic flavor to the
men, the racial characteristics of the women being somewhat
concealed by their enamel. Rufus was annoyed by the lack of
conversational syntax, recognizing with a sinking of the heart that
in many respects Jarmon was socially superior to the majority of
those present, among whom Devereaux and Darcy were conspicuous by
their absence. What would the Jameses think if they could see him
there! Then his eye caught the profile of a well-known member of
the judiciary and he brightened. Simultaneously a hand clapped his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Honored!" said Mr. Savoy. "Let's duck this riffraff and get
hold of some real people. Of course I have to ask everybody. Any
one you want particularly to meet?"</p>

<p>Rufus took courage at this recognition of his own paramount
standing. After all, any big jam on Fifth Avenue was almost as
heterogeneous. He decided to adopt a casual
"just-looked-in-for-a-moment" manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Savoy led him along until they reached a small smoking-room
or den where a select company were sitting; among them the pretty
girl Rufus had noticed at the Croyon. Her declared intention of
being present had been in his mind when he had refused James's
invitation to dinner. Well, there she was! Rufus was introduced to
the members of the party and presently found himself talking to
Mercedes.</p>

<p>He was struck at once by her extreme youth&mdash;nineteen, she
admitted, with a childish laugh at his surprise. Only a year older
than Sheila. Nineteen was really quite old, she told him. She had
been on the stage since she was ten. But it flattered him to
believe that her slightly deferential&mdash;almost
respectful&mdash;manner was not due entirely to his age. Amid the
noise and boisterous familiarity of the other rooms he had felt out
of his element, but here in the quiet intimacy of their retirement
he regained all his usual confidence and did his best to make
himself agreeable without being paternal.</p>

<p>After all, there was nothing out of the way in what he was
doing. It merely showed him to be alive. Miss Delaval&mdash;for
such was her surname&mdash;struck him as unusually intelligent and
even more attractive than his recollection of her. He had assumed
that she was "professional," but his unfamiliarity with the gayer
life of the city had prevented his recognition of her identify. Had
this not been so he would have been more upon his guard; but as it
was, apart from the fact that she was clearly anxious to make a
favorable impression upon him, he took her very nearly at her face
value&mdash;which was certainly high.</p>

<p>He had never talked to an actress before, although he found it
hard to believe that she was an actress and a show-girl at that.
Apart from a few minor mispronunciations which were only
occasionally disconcerting, she might have been one of the young
things who were always ru nning in and out of the Fifth Avenue
house&mdash;only prettier.</p>

<p>The word did not do her justice. Exquisite was more like it! All
the charm of Miss Dolan with the added fascination of the unknown.
And she had something elusively provocative about her that made
Rufus want to climb over the wall of her reserve and see for
himself what there was behind it.</p>

<p>He could attract when he chose, and she let him see that she was
complimented by his interest. She was so natural, earnest, and
trustful&mdash;and he so ready to be trusted&mdash;that they were
soon talking with entire informality; and she knew just when to
place her hand impulsively upon his knee&mdash;the others had gone
out&mdash;and let him enclose it for a moment in his. She was so
young, her limbs so slender, her skin so softly warm, her eyes so
guileless, the little chuckle of her laugh so contagious! A wonder
child! And like a child she talked.</p>

<p>Part of what he learned surprised and interested him. What she
really liked most, she said, was books&mdash;history,
poetry&mdash;a good novel once in a while for variety&mdash;music,
real music such as was provided by the concerts at Carnegie
Hall&mdash;and nature, the open country, the seashore. People
didn't know how hard a show-girl had to work! If only she could
have time to read and cultivate herself! She gazed appealingly at
Rufus as she said that she had almost never been in an automobile,
and out of compassion Rufus forgave her the horror of the accented
third syllable.</p>

<p>She did have the audacity to say that she had never been farther
from New York than Atlantic City. She had loved it there&mdash;the
bathing and lying on the hot sand. She and her mother had gone
there together for a week last year. Oh, yes, she lived with her
mother&mdash;had always lived with her.</p>

<p>Rufus, only half convinced but eager to be convinced, assured
himself that here was a sweet girl who had never had a chance. The
trouble with her life, she said with a pathetic droop of her
shoulders, was that she knew so few decent men. This kind of thing,
waving a graceful hand toward the room containing the jazzing
crowd, seemed to her a foolish waste of time and money! She would
have preferred a quiet evening of music and conversation, or
perhaps a walk around the reservoir. Of course she had to work for
her living, and had no choice, but did he suppose if she had Mrs.
Wingate's money she would be fox-trotting around with one of those
simpering little <i>gigolos</i> or with that Hindoo or whatever he
was who was dancing with her now?</p>

<p>Rufus, bewildered by her apparent ingenuousness, wondered if
such innocence were possible in view of her associations. He could
hardly believe it, yet looking at her demure little face and
listening to her artless chatter he wanted to believe that the
miracle was true. At any rate, this girl was talking to him because
she liked to talk to him. He had made a hit with her. There must be
something about him still, in spite of his grizzled hair. He had
not a suspicion that she knew Diana. Perhaps his very maturity was
an asset. He was glad he had come. He was not going to rush into
anything, but this girl really had fallen for him. Well, he would
see what happened.</p>

<p>When she said that she must go home he held her hand a long
time. He would have kissed it had he known how to do so with the
proper air. And Mercedes, with a pathetic look, thanked him
gratefully for being so nice to her. He made no reference to a
possible continuation of their acquaintance; and neither did
she&mdash;an exhibition of good taste which pleased him. No use
being in a hurry! He had made a good start.</p>

<p>He lingered on, meeting in due course an ex-ambassador, a famous
moving-picture star, several leading actresses, a pickle
millionaire, Degautet the sculptor, and a horde of lesser
celebrities. Everybody seemed to be on the most cordial terms with
everybody else, and many of the ladies laid hands on him as if he
had been their friend from boyhood. After all, it was genuine,
spontaneous! Why knock anything that was real? Rufus protested to
himself that he liked it. He was glad he had made the loan to the
Alpha-Omega. Jolly, good-hearted, impulsive folk, these of the
Rialto!</p>

<p>The colored missionary from Mozambique had long since ceased his
exhortation to the Jameses' two hundred golden friends ranged in
the two hundred golden chairs&mdash;kept down in the basement when
not in use&mdash;but a perforated roll still hung dejectedly by one
spindle from the Aeolian organ on the upper landing.</p>

<p>Rufus thanked his stars he hadn't been there! And yet&mdash;and
yet&mdash;as he inserted his latch-key in his own front door on
Fifth Avenue, he wondered&mdash;half shamefacedly&mdash;if, after
all, the nicest people weren't really the nicest people.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter 16. Claudia's Escape</h2>

<p>Claudia, Lady Harrowdale, stood at the library window of "The
Bandbox," her country house in Surrey, smoking a cigarette and
watching young Hawker sauntering toward the clump of firs at the
foot of the garden. Mr. Hawker had walked over from "Folly House"
for lunch and to make&mdash;for the thirteenth time&mdash;the
kindly suggestion that she should, with his assistance, give her
lord and master a taste of his own medicine.</p>

<p>Hawker seemed a well-meaning lad&mdash;slightly corrupted
perhaps by the general social demoralization of the post-war
period, but who wasn't?&mdash;and he took no pains to conceal the
fact that he liked Claudia very much and hated to see her so
neglected. But in spite of her gratitude for his affection and
companionship she had to-day given him quite plainly to understand
that he must not come again. As his broad back in its well-cut
Norfolk jacket disappeared among the tree-trunks, she felt like a
marooned sailor who sees the ship that has abandoned him on his
island vanish over the horizon.</p>

<p>Leaning her forehead against the cool pane and staring out into
the drizzle, it seemed to her as if she had done nothing
else&mdash;except to bring little Peter and Bess into the
world&mdash;for nearly four years; nothing but that, and quarrel
with Harrowdale when he deigned to put in an appearance, which was
now seldom. Ever since Bess had been born he had been entirely
devoid of shame in his various escapades. There was even a woman
from the village who had been seen constantly in London with
him.</p>

<p>Claudia could not understand why the neighbors in some
paradoxical way seemed to hold her responsible for his desertion.
In England, apparently, it was not respectable to be deserted by
one's husband. The stability of the social order was so eternally
precious that if any disgruntled mate kicked over the marital
traces, the easiest and safest course, no matter whether the wife
was in any way to blame or not, was for people to drop her at the
same time that they dropped him. Harrowdale had brought her down
into a nest of hidebound old county families who had paid her scant
courtesy in the first instance, and now she found herself
ostracized.</p>

<p>During the four years in which she had lived in "The Bandbox"
she had aged fifteen. She had left America a gay, triumphant "war
bride" looking forward to a life of active, colorful service in her
husband's country&mdash;and had instead found herself married to a
slacker and a rake. She had borne his infidelities as long as she
could and then had taken the advice of counsel, who had informed
her that since she lacked evidence of legal cruelty&mdash;although
his adultery was open and unabashed&mdash;she could not win her
freedom under English law.</p>

<p>Harrowdale, who watched all her movements, derided her. So she
had tried to have the law upon him, had she? Well, two could work
that game! She had better not try to play him any trick! Five days
later she had received a letter from his solicitors stating that
her children had become wards in Chancery and that any attempt on
her part to take them out of the country or interfere with them
without the permission of the Lord Chancellor would be a contempt
of court punishable by indefinite imprisonment.</p>

<p>Indignantly she had gone back to her distinguished counsel, who
had with reluctance&mdash;for she was still a pretty
woman&mdash;acknowledged that Messrs. Skifington, Wells &amp;
Company had correctly enunciated the law. Harrowdale, it seemed,
had deposited some trifling sum in Chancery for the benefit of
little Peter and little Bess when they should become of age, with
the result that although the Lord Chancellor probably had not the
slightest suspicion of their existence, they were now under his
legal protection and could not be removed from within sight of his
eagle eye. A little American mouse in an English legal
rat-trap!</p>

<p>Harrowdale, swaggering, had challenged her to defy the
Chancery&mdash;unless her father was willing to talk business. He
did not like the idea of his children becoming Americans, but he
had no money and&mdash;well, she might write to her father and
suggest some sort of a <i>quid pro quo</i>. Small wonder that her
dark-brown hair had lost its lustre, that her face, once full of
charming contours, had grown peaked, and that the moth-wing bloom
on her dusky cheeks had vanished. She was virtually a prisoner in
her own house, unable to free herself from a worthless husband
frankly unfaithful to his marriage vows, unable to leave England
unless she left her children behind her.</p>

<p>Small wonder that, in spite of little Peter who was
enthusiastically pushing a woolly bear on wheels along the
hearth-rug, she saw young Hawker's figure vanish with a tinge of
regret. Why, as he had said, should not what was sauce for the
gander be sauce for the goose as well? It might have been had not
Ventnor, the butler, who, although paid by her, was a spy of her
husband's, informed her at that moment that a gentleman was calling
on Lady Harrowdale&mdash;and handed her the card of Captain Nigel
Craig.</p>

<p>At first she assumed that he must have come to ask her for a
subscription to some war charity. Even so, any caller was a welcome
relief, for apart from young Hawker, Claudia had seen no one for a
week; and she welcomed him cordially, especially since she noticed
that he had very large and beautiful gray eyes, and made up her
mind instantly that she would give him a subscription.</p>

<p>Nigel, expecting to find a dashing American beauty, worthy
sister to those two other young modems, Diana and Sheila, was
shocked at her appearance. He knew that she was younger than Diana,
yet she looked far older, and in her eyes, even when she smiled, as
she was doing then, he could read tragic signs. He happened to be
staying near by, he explained, and as he had had the pleasure of
meeting her sister in New York, had taken the liberty of dropping
in to see her. Claudia was delighted. Then, Ventnor having silently
departed, Nigel told her why he had come and showed her her
father's letter. The girl's breath quickened and the color mounted
to her drab cheeks and the tears to her eyes.</p>

<p>"We mustn't talk here," Nigel whispered. "I've a closed car at
the inn garage. We can talk in that. My chauffeur is perfectly
safe. We've got to act quickly. Can you meet me in twenty minutes,
say, on the road through the woods to Denby?"</p>

<p>"In ten," she answered. "I'll be walking on the right-hand
side."</p>

<p>She rang for Ventnor and, when he came, said with a real thrill
at playing a part:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Captain Craig, that I can't afford to give you a
subscription. I'm sure it's a very noble work."</p>

<p>They shook hands punctiliously and Ventnor showed the visitor
out. Five minutes later Claudia, her knitted shopping-bag on her
arm, started for the village. From his second-story window young
Hawker watched her through a spy-glass until she turned into the
Denby road. Then he reached for a cigarette. "She can't stand it
forever," he muttered. "She'll cave in sooner or later!"</p>

<p>Claudia walked slowly through the woods and soon heard behind
her the muffled cough of a Klaxon. A limousine passed her, stopped,
and Nigel leaped out.</p>

<p>"Much better!" he declared as together they took their seats
inside. "Now we can talk all we want. Do you mind if I smoke? Have
a cigarette? This E. Phillips Oppenheim sort of thing does seem
rather silly! All right, Nisbet, go ahead slowly until I stop you.
Well, here we are! I suppose you thought you had been quite
forgotten!"</p>

<p>In the broad light that fell through the plate-glass windows of
the car Claudia marvelled at the sweetness of his smile and the
play of color under his brown skin&mdash;a complexion that any
woman might have envied. Could this girlish-looking boy have slept
in the slime of Ypres and Mennin&mdash;this young Lochinvar who had
come out of the West to rescue her?</p>

<p>He had been in London a month, he said, laying his plans,
consulting her lawyers, and getting a line on Harrowdale. The
solicitors had funked it&mdash;had absolutely refused to help them.
You couldn't blame them much, considering that they were right
under the Lord Chancellor's paw and might be held responsible if
their connection with the matter ever leaked out. So he had had to
make all the arrangements himself. Rather good fun!</p>

<p>He had had a man watching her husband and knew everything he
did. Harrowdale would be in London until the following Sunday. This
was Tuesday. There was an American vessel&mdash;a three-masted
auxiliary schooner&mdash;lying in the Solent waiting to take her to
America. Let her pack in valises what things she needed for herself
and her children for the voyage, and give out to the servants that
she was tired of being left all alone by herself down in the
country, and that she was going up to town to stay for a while at
an hotel. She must also pack and send up to London by goods-train
enough trunks to give verisimilitude to her statement. Everything
was prepared, and a launch would be waiting in an inlet to take
them to the schooner, which once they were aboard would weigh
anchor and carry them back to her own country, where the laws were
so much better adapted to accomplish justice.</p>

<p>Claudia was ecstatic at first. Then her smile faded. Bess was
less than a year old! If it should be rough&mdash;the exposure in
the launch! Nigel reassured her. They would pick a fair day. Really
there was nothing to fear. If they did not act quickly Harrowdale
might do something which would make any such attempted escape
abortive&mdash;take the children off somewhere with him, for
example. It was the best opportunity they were ever likely to
have.</p>

<p>Claudia endeavored to suppress her fears. She ought, if
possible, Nigel said, to take a female servant to help her with the
children. Had she a single maid out of the lot whom she could
trust? Claudia assured him that luckily there was one whose loyalty
could not be questioned&mdash;old Spedding, the nurse who had been
with Peter since his birth. Ventnor might be a Judas&mdash;so might
be one or more of the others, but faithful Spedding she could
absolutely count on. Good! Now, to go on with the plan&mdash;Lady
Harrowdale should take the afternoon train for London with her
children, having bought through tickets in order to avert
suspicion. At Basingstoke, however, they should all get out. He
would be waiting for them there in the car and motor them back to
the coast, to the hamlet near Christ Church where the launch would
be waiting. By midnight they would be outside the three-mile limit
and the Lord Chancellor could go hang!</p>

<p>He outlined the plan to her in a slightly whimsical way, as if
the whole business were rather melodramatic and absurd even
if&mdash;for some preposterous reason&mdash;necessary. Indeed, he
found it hard to believe, as they sat there so comfortably in the
cushioned car chatting through the smoke of their cigarettes, that
he wasn't talking balderdash.</p>

<p>Was it possible in this the twentieth century, when fifteen
million men had just died for freedom, that an Englishman who was
brazenly unfaithful to his wife&mdash;made no bones about
it&mdash;and did nothing to support her or her children, could
nevertheless hold them all prisoners under a legal fiction? Could
he arbitrarily refuse to allow the woman whom he had deceived and
with whom he no longer wished to live to take the children, whom he
would not maintain, and return to her family?</p>

<p>Was it conceivable that down in this quiet countryside, if she
took a single step to exert her natural maternal rights over her
offspring, some bewigged functionary, sitting in smoky chambers
before a green baize-covered desk in London, would issue a thing
called a writ of attachment, and hand it to a clerk, who would
deliver it to a sheriff commanding him to "take into his custody
the body of the said Claudia, Lady Harrowdale, and produce her"
before him, the said Lord Chancellor of England, for chastisement;
and that, if the said Claudia wanted to keep her beautiful young
body for her own uses and refused to go with the sheriff or
whatever, the telegraph instruments would begin to click, and
sleepy constables would be routed out of bed, and posses assembled,
and the yeomanry called out if need be, and the coast guard
notified, and the admiralty send wireless messages for
destroyers&mdash;all because the said Claudia, out of love for her
children, wished to bring them up beyond the reach of a drunken,
dissolute father? It just couldn't be!</p>

<p>Things were not like that! It was not only mediaeval&mdash;it
was barbaric! A mad dream worthy of Lewis Carroll! Would any Lord
Chancellor, no matter how dried up, order this lovely creature to
jail if she defied him for her children's sake? The solicitors had
said so. It was the law! Yet it was no more silly than that because
a half-crazy anarchist had shot an heir presumptive to one of the
Balkan States in far-off Sarajevo, he, Nigel Craig, should have had
four brothers killed with high explosives and should himself have
lain in a hospital for half a year. The world had not believed any
such thing possible. He could hardly believe this possible. A bally
England! He resented the situation bitterly. So this was what his
brothers had died for? That he&mdash;!</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, as he ordered the chauffeur to turn
around. "The only thing we've got to be careful of is that no one
in your employ, or in the village, has the least suspicion of what
you're up to. We mustn't give 'em time to think it over. If you
start to-morrow you'd better not pack your bags until after lunch.
You can leave your maid behind to attend to the trunks and send
them up to London. Funny, isn't it&mdash;to sit here and talk like
this! Planning, as they say in the movies, a 'get-away.' I must say
it's asking you to take me a good deal on faith!"</p>

<p>She touched his sleeve. "I know whom I can trust!" she said.</p>

<p>Nigel raised her hand to his lips. For him the act was not
merely chivalric, but a kind of sacrament. This girl was putting
herself unreservedly in his hands&mdash;herself, her life, her
children&mdash;a grave responsibility. Already he felt for her
something more than mere sympathy. Fate, which had hitherto treated
them both so malignantly, had thrust them together in a strange
way. Was Fate perhaps trying to make amends?</p>

<p>"That villain butler of yours," he remarked as they neared the
village&mdash;"Ventnor's his name, isn't it?&mdash;he writes to
your husband every second day. But I don't worry much over him. The
chap I'm afraid of is that fellow Hawker&mdash;who lives across the
way from you. He's spent most of his time with Harrowdale whenever
he's gone up to London. I've an idea they're hatching
something!"</p>

<p>He was unprepared for the result of this declaration upon his
companion. She turned suddenly white and leaned her head against
the side of the car.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she moaned. "Take me away from here! Take me away!"</p>

<p>For the first time Claudia realized the depth of her husband's
infamy. The beast was willing to give her to Hawker in order to
have an additional hold over her&mdash;a defense to a possible suit
for divorce&mdash;a counteraction!</p>

<p>The car had stopped at the turn in the road above the grove of
firs behind "The Bandbox." The rain had ended and bars of
reddish-golden light were slanting through the tall ranks of
spear-like boles. A faint mist rose here and there from the damp
ground like fairy pipe-smoke.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" said Nigel. "I suppose you had better get out
here."</p>

<p>He opened the door and put one foot upon the running-board,
possessed by a curious excitement. The thing was becoming vivid. A
real adventure! After all, she was taking a chance! He was asking a
tremendous lot of her! And she looked so childlike, so frail.</p>

<p>"I suppose I must!" she sighed. "I hate to go back to that
house!"</p>

<p>She held out her hand and took his with a firm pressure. Then,
closing her eyes for a moment, she arose, and he helped her down
into the road.</p>

<p>"At Basingstoke, then&mdash;to-morrow night at seven. I'll be
just across from the station," he said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Very well! Good night!" she answered, her eyes holding his.</p>

<p>"Good night!" he replied, and as she turned away from him and
started down the road, he added under his breath&mdash;"you
darling!"</p>

<p>Without reflecting on Sir Percy Harrowdale's intelligence, it
must be admitted that it had never once occurred to him that
Claudia would take the bit in her teeth. What with her
child-bearing and her loneliness she had seemed too cowed to do
anything. Young Mr. Hawker, however, with time hanging heavy on his
hands, found pleasurable excitement in imagining all sorts of
possibilities. That she could be faithful to her husband struck him
as so wholly unlikely as to be ridiculous. He'd heard all about
these fast American girls! They didn't stop at anything! If she
wouldn't fall for him, why&mdash;there must be somebody else. She
was merely playing a deucedly clever game, that was all!</p>

<p>Strolling by the inn after he had seen her go out, he learned
that the dark, good-looking chap who had lunched there had then
gone over to "The Bandbox," had afterward paid his bill, and
started off toward Denby.</p>

<p>"Aha!" thought Hawker. "That's the road my lady took."</p>

<p>He decided that a little exercise would be a good thing for him.
If he walked fast enough he could certainly overtake Claudia in
half a mile, and if he didn't overtake her&mdash;well, the chances
were that she was taking a spin with the dark, good-looking young
man.</p>

<p>He did not overtake her and, accordingly, he strolled off the
road and sat down behind a rock among the firs, whence a half-hour
later he was an inconspicuous spectator of the little tableau at
the door of the car. It was good enough! If he couldn't have her
himself, the next best thing was to spot the fellow who did have
her. That evening he sent a wire to Harrowdale from the next
town.</p>

<p>"Our ladybird has found a mate. Better stay away. I am on the
watch and will report."</p>

<p>When at three o'clock the following afternoon he met Ventnor as
usual in the village, he found the butler much excited. Lady
Harrowdale had unexpectedly decided to go up to London on the five
o'clock, taking the children with her. The trunks were to follow
next day. He couldn't make it out&mdash;so sudden like. Hawker said
nothing. He knew what was doing. She was going to London to be near
the dark, good-looking young man. He must keep track of her and see
where she went. He had no particular objection to a day or so in
London. On the whole, he thought he might as well take the five
o'clock himself.</p>

<p>"Why, hello!" he exclaimed in feigned astonishment as he ran
into her with Peter and Bess on the "up" platform. "Goin' up to
town? Is Harrowdale at the Berkeley? The fellow never tells me
where he's stoppin'!"</p>

<p>For a moment she feared he would get into the compartment with
them, but she carefully selected a "nosmoking" one, and to her
relief, after promising to get a porter for her at Waterloo, he
sought another.</p>

<p>Once on the train, with the children upon the seat beside her
and her luggage in the rack, Claudia experienced her first
anxieties. Until that moment excitement had buoyed her up and she
had had no time to take counsel of her fears. But now in the
gathering twilight of an ominous nightfall doubt as to the wisdom
of her course possessed her. Had she the right to hazard her
children's lives in a winter crossing of the Atlantic on a small
sailing-vessel? To ruin their digestions perhaps with coarse food
or condensed milk? They might even be drowned in the launch if the
weather were rough! Hadn't she better take Peter and Bess up to
London after all and put them safely to bed in the Berkeley!</p>

<p>Peter was lying flat on his back with his head on his nurse's
lap, the woolly bear mounting guard upon his small stomach. Bess,
too, was sound asleep. After all, what right had she to jeopardize
their safety? Then in the dusk she seemed to see Nigel standing
there beside them, feel his lips upon her hand, and his gray eyes
fixed on hers. And she knew, that she must go&mdash;not for the
children's sake alone, but for her own.</p>

<p>"Basingstoke! Basingstoke!"</p>

<p>The guard threw open the door, letting in a blast of cold air.
Terror seized her, but she signalled for a porter, and, with
Spedding, bundled out the still sleeping Peter and Bess. With her
heart fluttering she followed the porter, expecting every instant
to see Hawker behind them. The bell rang, the whistle blew, the
train moved out. Next instant Nigel was beside her lifting Peter
from her arms.</p>

<p>"This way. Everything is all right."</p>

<p>"I was so frightened," she gasped. "Mr. Hawker was on the train.
I think he was following us."</p>

<p>Three minutes and they were off, roaring southward through the
darkness whence they had come, now slowing up to rumble through a
half-lighted town, then hurtling on through miles of countryside,
never stopping, never hesitating.</p>

<p>"You've a good chauffeur!" she said as the car swung sharply
around a turn and threw her against him.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;very!" he replied. "He knows every inch of road
between here and Land's End."</p>

<p>It had begun to snow as they left Winchester and great flakes
had splotched the windows, sagging down in crystal masses to the
bottom of the panes, but by the time they had passed through
Southampton it had changed to rain and they were running along
narrow country by-roads through a thick mist which turned back the
headlights like a stone wall.</p>

<p>Once near Minster they stopped suddenly, confronted by the huge
white face of an astonished cart-horse surrounded by a frosty halo,
and shortly after that the motor slowed down as the road became
soft and rutty, and now and again a bush scratched the sides.</p>

<p>It seemed to her as if they had been travelling all night,
although the dock on the dashboard showed that it was only just
after ten. They were approaching Christ Church, Nigel said. Claudia
smelled the sea and once more her heart failed her. The car inside
was unlighted, so that Nigel could not see her face, but his hand
reached for hers in the darkness.</p>

<p>Then with a bump or two and a lurch they stopped. Fearfully she
looked out. A sailor in dripping oilskins stood by the roadside
holding a lantern. It was pouring now&mdash;the drops leaping up in
companies as they struck the puddles.</p>

<p>"Here we are! Only a step from the gang-plank!" laughed Nigel as
he took up the inert form of little Peter. "We can dry off on
board. The launch is only a few feet away."</p>

<p>The sailor took the luggage and disappeared. The chauffeur had
climbed down off his seat and was standing cap in hand, unmindful
of the rain. For the first time Claudia noticed his features. They
were those of a Crusader.</p>

<p>"Lady Harrowdale," said Nigel, "I want to present my friend
Captain Nisbet. He was with me in Belgium and volunteered for this
service."</p>

<p>The water leaked into her shoes as Claudia, clinging to Nigel's
arm in the darkness, floundered through the slime of the reeds that
fringed the inlet. A moment before she had been dry, warm,
protected; now, but a step or two away from the motor, she was
groping her way through the stinging rain, her face whipped by the
reeds, exposed to the biting wind which drew in from the sea across
the marsh.</p>

<p>What might not lurk equally near outside the slender, swaying
circle of light that Nigel's torch threw against the swirling fog?
Seasickness, cold, hunger, every kind of physical
discomfort&mdash;shipwreck&mdash;death perhaps? She was about to
abandon terra firma for the uncertainties of a winter sea, on which
their ship would be tossed about like a leaf or smothered beneath
mountainous waves. Had she the right to expose her two children to
such dangers? There was yet time to change her mind.</p>

<p>The motor was still there&mdash;twenty paces behind them in the
road! Then against the mist she seemed to see Harrowdale's leering
face. And she had a momentary vision of Hawker, as smiling over his
glass of port he had asked her so casually the day before to take a
run with him down to Wales. No! Better that they should all drown
together than that Peter and Bess should be brought up under the
influence of such a man!</p>

<p>Next instant she was beside the launch, and the sailor was
helping her in. How tiny it was! There was hardly room for them to
sit down. She turned to speak to Nigel, but already they were
pushing off. The bottom of the launch ground over the silt, slid
free and slipped into the current. The tide was running out and
they let her drift. There was little motion and Claudia took
courage. She had been a fool to be so afraid! Nigel handed her his
flask and she took a sip. It burned her throat but it somehow gave
her confidence. It was rather funny, the way she and Spedding were
sitting in the bottom of the boat&mdash;right in pools of
water&mdash;each holding a child! She even laughed a little
hysterically!</p>

<p>The launch swayed and swung half round sideways. Distant
lights&mdash;white lights&mdash;were running by in streaks. The
boat began to bob up and down. There was a stench of gasolene.
Suddenly, with a roar like a machine-gun the engine started just
behind her, and the launch straightened and shot ahead, spanking
the waves. A gust of spray leaped over the bow and fell upon them.
Peter began to scream. She tried to still his cries, but she was
terrified also.</p>

<p>The launch was doing all sorts of queer things now, lifting
itself high into the air and then gyrating downward again with a
strange, sickening, scooping motion. Any instant they might upset.
She could not maintain her balance. They were going over! She
screamed. Then she felt Nigel's arm tight about her.</p>

<p>Again they rose into a staggering sea that almost overturned
them. They were lifted high in the
blackness&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;toward a bright yellow
gleam&mdash;a lighthouse?&mdash;then sucked down, dropping away
from it to unfathomable depths.</p>

<p>Again they shot toward the light! She heard hoarse shouts from
above borne on the wind. The engine stopped. She saw waves creaming
in a black abyss and ropes swinging. Nigel was holding up Peter
toward the ropes. He must not! She could not let him risk Peter's
life! They struck something heavily. She was grasped by rough hands
and lifted toward the light. She could never cling to the
ropes&mdash;never reach those lights!</p>

<p>The launch sunk from beneath her, leaving her clinging to
something wet and slimy. Hysterically she clung to it&mdash;vowing
never to leave it! More arms seized her and she was dragged up and
over a hard thing that hurt her shins. Her legs gave way and she
sank upon a deck...</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter 17. Weed And Flower</h2>

<p>The alchemy of what we call love defies analysis. No matter how
"thick and slab" the gruel of passion, there will be at the bottom
of the witches' caldron some tiny fleck of gold to reflect the
flash of an angel's wing. Whatever the love may be&mdash;whether a
temporary physical reaction, an ecstasy, or a sacrament&mdash;there
is in it, unless we be but brute beasts, some element of the
spiritual. Wherever there is tenderness in the drawing together of
two people, within or without what we call law&mdash;there is mixed
in the evil something of the divine. The danger lies in mistaking
the one for the other.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to conceive a more deliberate seeking of
the merely carnal than that of Rufus Kayne. It was no more than
that in his own mind, and he made no effort to deceive himself into
thinking that it was any thing else. Yet his instinct was not
utterly sensual. He was a lonely man and his nature yearned for
affection. His marriage was arid of sentiment; he was a stranger to
the hearts of his children; he had few friends&mdash;and none who
really loved him.</p>

<p>This longing to love and to be loved&mdash;tinged as it was with
an unsatisfied natural appetite&mdash;he took to be wholly sinful,
for, looking always for the worst in others, he looked always for
the worst in him self. Had he but known it, this yearning for love
was a tender flower of the soul that might have been nurtured into
a thing of spiritual beauty. But beside it grew a rank and baneful
weed heavy with sinister perfume. Grasping at the weed, he plucked
them both and, for a space, with the odor of the one was mingled
the fragrance of the other. Then the fragile flower withered, while
the weed stretched its shoots toward his heart.</p>

<p>He awoke next mor ning rejuvenated and with an exquisite sense
of adventure. Lying there under his silk coverlet waiting for the
new second man to bring in his breakfast-tray, he saw himself
justified in everything. The chintz had never glowed so brightly,
the aroma of the coffee had never been so satisfying, the toast so
crisp, the marmalade so delicious. The new servant, who had
replaced Capper and who had hitherto been in fear of him, was
surprised by his geniality and left the room convinced that he had
made good and that his job was safe. Rufus, propped luxuriously
against the pillows, having eaten his breakfast, lit a cigarette,
and gave himself over to day-dreaming. He perceived that the world
was not so bad. A little touch of kindliness, a cheery
word&mdash;the "personal note"&mdash;was all it needed. He even
laid his hand on Jarmon's shoulder as the butler gave him his
hat.</p>

<p>"You've been with us a long time, Jarmon!" he said. "How the
years fly!"</p>

<p>"No one would suspect it, lookin' at you, sir!" answered the
pantry diplomat, and Rufus mentally raised him ten.</p>

<p>The avenue seemed brilliantly gay to him. Everybody was smiling.
"Laugh and the world laughs with you!" Miss Dolan did not know what
had come over him. She had never seen her employer so boyish, and
her hopes rose. He cracked a joke at the directors' meeting, and,
remembering that Elizabeth liked violets, ordered a double bunch
sent to the house from Thorley's.</p>

<p>He spent a quiet hour thinking about the Mercedes affair, and
was glad he had made no further advances at the time. There was no
use being excited, letting the girl think he couldn't get on
without her. He could get on without her if it came to that. His
eye switched to the trim back at the desk outside his door.
"Christian slave." He would go slow. If anything happened, it must
be natural and&mdash;as it were&mdash;inevitable.</p>

<p>Borrowing the telephone-book from Miss Dolan, he ascertained
Miss Delaval's number, but checked an impulse to call her up and
ask how she was. However, feeling that it would be only courteous,
and certainly good business, to acknowledge her existence, he
stopped on his way out at the public telephone adjoining the
lunch-counter in the basement, and ordered another bunch of violets
sent to her address.</p>

<p>During the succeeding weeks&mdash;whether from excitement or
from altruism&mdash;Rufus became so changed as to be almost
unrecognizable. At home he was considerate and even demonstrative;
at the office he jollied his subordinates and exhibited a keen
interest in their family affairs. He lived in a state of delicious
perturbation. Mercedes's little note thanking him for the violets
had raised him to ecstasy. It had contained no salutation or
signature, reading simply:</p>

<p class="letter">"How dear of you to send my favorite flowers.
They always make me so happy. I hope you are happy too."</p>

<p>He wondered why merely leaving off their names made it seem so
much more intimate. Could it be that she had done so in case that
note should fall into other hands, instinctively aware that he
might not wish their acquaintance to be known? That was
considerate, or, at any rate, discreet. Naturally she would be
discreet. Girls on the stage had to be. An actress! And a beauty!
Rufus felt an increased circulation around his thorax. Well, he
would be equally discreet.</p>

<p>She had written her acknowledgment in longhand, and, although,
of course, it did not require a reply, it was a good
opening&mdash;too good to let pass entirely. But he would not
write. He was too wise a bird for that! He would send her a
typewritten note without any name at the beginning&mdash;just as
she had done&mdash;which would render his signature&mdash;possibly
compromising&mdash;superfluous. He had never used a typewriter, but
he sent Miss Dolan to a matinee, locked the outer door, and fiddled
with the keys. In the end he gave it up.</p>

<p>Three days later he sent more violets and, after allowing plenty
of time for them to arrive, telephoned to her apartment. She was
out, and he felt the world to be empty. He had not left his name or
number, because he preferred not to have her call him up on his
office telephone, although he did not wish to hurt her feelings by
telling her so.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he was delighted when next morning he found an
envelope addressed in her handwriting among the letters upon his
desk&mdash;less so on discovery that Miss Dolan had slit the
envelope along with the rest of the mail. But he said nothing about
it. He could not remark out of a clear sky, no matter how casually:
"Oh, by the way, Miss Dolan, if any other letters addressed in that
handwriting happen to come in my mail, you need not open them after
this." Impossible! No, there must be no correspondence&mdash;unless
he hired a private box at the post-office, and he did not purpose
to let the girl think he was in it as deep as that. Besides, it was
rather too surreptitious. All letters were dangerous. The telephone
was the thing.</p>

<p>Thus there developed between them that most modern of
relationships&mdash;a love-affair by telephone, so stimulating to
rapid intimacy. If imagination enhances the attractions of the
unseen letter-writer, how much more active will that imagination
prove when aided by the caressing tones of a silvery voice or an
endearing little laugh. He often spoke of her as his "Voice on the
Wire." Soon he was calling her up every morning on his way
down-town, hungry to hear her drowsy tones answering from her bed,
for she did not get up until noon. And then, of course, he had to
call her again&mdash;she could not call him over the trust
company's line&mdash;before he went out to lunch.</p>

<p>During this period Rufus saw a great deal of Mr. Savoy and went
to several of his parties, at which Mercedes was invariably
present. He also was unusually affectionate with Elizabeth and sent
her many bunches of violets. His benignity was ubiquitous. He was
intensely proud of his success with this darling of the
footlights&mdash;particularly after he had discovered how much of a
celebrity she was. He wondered what the Corner Boys would say if
they knew old Rufus was on the loose! It gave him an exultant
satisfaction to go to the Revels and&mdash;as he watched her
dancing amid the thunder of the little wooden hammers&mdash;to say
to himself that this glorious young thing was his or might be if he
but dropped his handkerchief.</p>

<p>Toying with sin at this comparatively safe distance, he had no
particular consciousness of guilt even when he kissed his wife.
What guilt he felt gave only an added zest to the
affair&mdash;"bread eaten in secret." For of course he told
nobody&mdash;kept it dark absolutely&mdash;allowed no whisper nor
hint nor even suspicion to escape&mdash;although he had a furtive
mistrust of Miss Dolan's apparent ignorance of what was going on,
for Mercedes, in spite of everything, had been obliged to call him
on his office wire once or twice.</p>

<p>Savoy and he took to lunching together with frequency up-town,
and Rufus was astonished at the tremendous profits shown by the
quarterly balance-sheets of the moving-picture producing companies.
The selected producers, "directors," and managers to whom he was
introduced seemed to be rolling in wealth. Quite inadvertently at
his own solicitation he learned that Savoy thought well of the
preferred stock of "Celebrated Celluloid"&mdash;a new
concern&mdash;which paid eight per cent and carried a heavy bonus
of common, and quietly bought five thousand shares without
disclosing the fact to his new friend.</p>

<p>He was in exuberant spirits and spent an hour almost every
evening with the old pirate, who had not seen Ruf' so perky for a
long time. The dawn was coming and the birds were singing in the
mysterious twilight.</p>

<p>He did not, however, altogether escape a feeling of cheapness.
The fact that he, the president of the Utopia Trust Company, should
have to go down to the basement to speak to Mercedes&mdash;drop a
nickel in a slot in a fetid, overheated booth, smelling of
wintergreen&mdash;murmur&mdash;and at times very distinctly
articulate&mdash;tender nothings into a sticky mouthpiece while
frowsy girls and mousy-looking boys were doing the same in other
booths on either side of him&mdash;put his passion to a severe
test.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he could hear his heart thump as he waited
expectantly for her sweetly modulated voice, and the blood would
rush to his face at the words:</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you! How dear of you to call me up! Yes, the violets
were lovely. Yes, I'm happy. As much as I can be." And one day she
accidentally added a little "dear"&mdash;"I'm happy as much as I
can be, dear"&mdash;and he felt the unspoken words&mdash;"without
you."</p>

<p>It was so easy to make love to her over the telephone! Yet it
was rather unsatisfying. In his imagination she daily grew more and
more desirable. She had never asked him to call upon her. He would
not have done so. But this telephone business was tantalizing
nonsense. He pondered deeply the problem of how to see her without
running the risk of being seen, discarding the possibility of
taking her openly to any place of public amusement or
restaurant&mdash;as he knew many men did their mistresses&mdash;and
feeling&mdash;what was undoubtedly the fact&mdash;his very
reputation for respectability to be a handicap.</p>

<p>Finally he evolved a clever plan, the very openness of which
would disarm all suspicion. He and she would go independently to
Washington Square and wait for the up-town bus. She should get in
and climb to the top and, after she had taken her seat, he would go
up and&mdash;without seeming to have done so
intentionally&mdash;sit down beside her. Then having talked as much
as they wished, they could get off separately&mdash;without any one
being the wiser.</p>

<p>The plan worked perfectly, and Rufus experienced an exultant
sense of proprietorship when Mercedes tripped coyly past him to the
stage without even raising her eyes from beneath her little
moleskin cap. Above, in the blue twilight of the arc-lamps, he
squeezed the small gloved hand under her cape.</p>

<p>"How kind of you to come!" he whispered out of the corner of his
mouth, pretending not to know her.</p>

<p>"I had to! You asked me, didn't you!" she sighed.</p>

<p>It was difficult to converse and yet not to
converse&mdash;without being a ventriloquist&mdash;so he contented
himself with holding her hand&mdash;kid-covered&mdash;for several
miles. They repeated the adventure next day and then again, but
while eminently safe, Rufus felt that he was not getting much out
of it and that it was even somewhat <i>infra dig</i>. As if at his
age he couldn't ask a woman to have tea with him! So rather
dashingly&mdash;he thought&mdash;he took her first to a tea-house
in Greenwich Village&mdash;"The Seven Buccaneers" or "The Scarlet
Parrot" or something&mdash;and a week or so later to one of those
quiet little English chop-houses in the Forties.</p>

<p>"Coming&mdash;but slow!" was little Mercedes's comment to Mr.
Savoy.</p>

<p>"I'll give a party to crank him up!" said he. "He's worth
playing with."</p>

<p>"All the same, I've only one life to live," she replied tartly.
"If something doesn't happen pretty soon, I shall cut the whole
thing. It hasn't cost him a cent. My time's too valuable!"</p>

<p>"Don't be an idiot!" cautioned her adviser. "Kayne's a big
fellow. Give him time!"</p>

<p>To Rufus things seemed to be moving rapidly enough. He now met
her regularly thrice a week for a walk in some secluded part of
town, sent her books, fruit, or flowers daily, and offered to buy
her a little runabout so that she could drive herself around the
Park. This she refused. He had fallen by this time desperately in
love with her and everything about her&mdash;her slim, lithe
figure, her piquant little nose, her quizzical, twisted
smile&mdash;her gurgling laugh. He was disconsolate without her;
deliciously palpitant in her company. In his wilder moments he even
considered the possibility of getting a divorce from Elizabeth and
doing the thing regularly. But he had never kissed her!</p>

<p>Then, unexpectedly, Mr. Savoy bade him to a friendly little
Sunday-night dinner at his apartment, at which, among others,
appeared young Fannin of the Oriental Trust in the company of a
blond young woman with copperish hair. Rufus with a slight gasp of
surprise perceived at once that this could not be the second Mrs.
Fannin, and he was rather offended that under the circumstances
Mercedes should have been invited.</p>

<p>However, it was a very quiet and well-behaved party, with just
enough to drink, and afterward it separated into couples and
wandered off idyllically through the rooms. Rufus found himself
once more beside Mercedes on the divan of Mr. Savoy's smoking-den.
Six weeks had elapsed since they had met there before&mdash;a
lifetime! Now they called one another by their first names, knew
one another's every trick of voice, speech, and gesture, had their
own catch phrases, terms of endearment, and code of innuendo. They
could hardly have been more intimate.</p>

<p>Sitting there together she was conscious that the atmosphere of
the den was surcharged. Her moment was at hand. He had come hard
but he had come at last. She could feel that he was trembling while
he was puffing his Corona. She lowered her head and allowed her
shoulders to droop toward the hands which she had folded in her
lap, like the Henner picture of the Magdalen which she so much
admired. As she waited, every sense on the alert, she could hear
his shirt-front creak as he breathed. A reddish light fell from a
brass lantern pierced with holes hanging overhead. She had not lit
a cigarette&mdash;intentionally. Everything was ready. Fruition!
Another instant and he would be crushing her to him. Rough
stuff!</p>

<p>She waited. Cautiously she glanced up. What was the matter with
him? Conscience? or merely cold feet? That was no way for a man to
look! Suddenly a suspicion turned her sick! Was it possible that
she had overplayed her game? That he had really fallen in love with
her?</p>

<p>She was sick at having so bungled so simple a business. It would
have been all right to let him invest her with qualities she did
not possess if he could have married her, but he could not! He had
a wife, a family&mdash;position. Her pretense of sweetness and
innocence had been too successful and had roused his chivalry. What
damnable foolishness! Was she going to lose it all?</p>

<p>Cold-blooded, mercenary little thing? Judge her not too
severely! For what had been true of Rufus was also true of
Mercedes. She too had plucked flower as well as weed. But as sex is
more entwined with woman's tenderness than with man's, she, having
at the time no other loyalty to restrain her, felt no hesitancy in
making the relationship complete. Harried by men&mdash;living by
her smiles and by her wits&mdash;drifting from one boardinghouse or
cheap apartment to another&mdash;getting her meals here and
there&mdash;always in debt&mdash;subjected daily to insult, she
suffered the embittered and jealous loneliness of the woman who
faces the world by herself and knows that she can never be more
than a plaything to the men who applaud and pet her.</p>

<p>In Rufus she saw not only a possible lover but a powerful
friend, through whom she might achieve at best the glittering world
of society&mdash;or even a possible marriage; at least, safety
under his protection, a semirespectability&mdash;a curious kind of
"position." She was grateful to him for his admiration, his
friendship, his attentions. She really liked him&mdash;her
sentiment for him was more real than her callous "line" of speech
disclosed.</p>

<p>He represented in her shoddy, vagrant existence, affection,
tranquillity of mind, financial security, and stability. His
friendship brought with it a sort of self-respect. With Rufus
behind her she could tell all the Steins and the Savoys to go hang.
She may not have loved him, but she loved what he meant to her and
she was genuinely fond of him. Without him her life would
be&mdash;at least for a long time&mdash;dreary. How many wives can
say more of their husbands? Therefore, she was willing to go the
limit, while he was not!</p>

<p>Her intuition had told her the truth. Rufus, too, realized that
the time had come. Things could not go on as they were. They had
reached the point where he must either fish or cut bait. He had
drunk a good deal at dinner and it had increased his natural
sentimentality. In fact, as Mercedes had suspected, he had been
getting entirely too sentimental of late and in consequence his
conscience had begun to worry him severely. The flower, withered at
first by its proximity to the heat of passion, suddenly revived
under the dew of tenderness.</p>

<p>She had become a cherished object&mdash;too sweet for him to
defile. He felt like a murderer for having made her love him. She
was such a darling! Such a nice kid! She might possibly be damaged
goods&mdash;how could you tell?&mdash;but he wouldn't take the
chance of being the first, no matter if she did care for him and
was ready to go the whole way. No, he'd made a mess of it! Got his
feet in the molasses. What a coil! Poor little Mercedes! He must
look out for her&mdash;protect her against him self&mdash;and
perhaps herself.</p>

<p>"Look here, dear," he said suddenly and his eye glistened.
"You've gone far enough with me!"</p>

<p>She lifted a face frightened to pallor.</p>

<p>"Do you mean it's all over?"</p>

<p>He nodded, swallowing.</p>

<p>"I thought you cared for me!" she expostulated.</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;God knows! That's why&mdash;"</p>

<p>Things were going all wrong. She moved her hand, palm upward,
toward him&mdash;a gesture of sympathy and affection never failing
of result. As he covered it with his, she saw that his cheeks were
wet.</p>

<p>"I had no business to get you into this!" he said. "I can't keep
you and I can't bear to let you go! But it's my own fault."</p>

<p>"No! No!" she cried. "It's mine! Oh, Rufus!"</p>

<p>She wormed her slim, warm fingers into his and clung there. He
pressed her wrist to his damp cheek.</p>

<p>"Darling!" he whispered for the first and only time.</p>

<p>Now or never!</p>

<p>He felt her arms around his neck, her body against his. No man
could stand it. With a groan he clasped her to him and, as she
closed her eyes, kissed her fiercely. His tears were salt on her
cheeks. Had she got him or not?</p>

<p>"Nothing matters, sweetheart," she assured him, "so long as you
love me! Nothing! Nothing in the world."</p>

<p>A footstep echoed in the hall outside and they broke apart.
Rufus reached quickly for his cigar and was relighting it when Mr.
Savoy appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"I just got an idea!" said the producer. "Tomorrow's
Monday&mdash;an off night at the theatre. How about a run down to
Atlantic City? I can always get accommodations, and if we started
by half past ten we'd get down there shortly after midnight. Half a
dozen of 'em in there are quite keen for it! If you want to stay
over, you can wire the management from there to put in your
understudy. Ziggy'll do it in a minute for you!"</p>

<p>Rufus looked slowly at Mercedes. The hand that held the match
shook perceptibly.</p>

<p>"I'm game for it," he answered after a moment's
hesitation&mdash;"if Miss Delaval is!"</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He was relieved when the party dwindled to the Savoys, another
couple whom he had not known before, Mercedes, and himself, and he
was glad&mdash;if a little surprised&mdash;that Fannin and that
queer-looking girl of his were not going. A whiskey and soda and he
was perfectly himself again&mdash;as he thought.</p>

<p>Savoy sent out for taxis, Mercedes went off to her apartment to
pack, and Rufus telephoned to the Corner Store and engaged a
landaulet. Then he returned home for the few things he would need
over the holiday. He let himself in with his latch-key, although
the servants were still up, and, having told the taxi-driver to
wait, sneaked upstairs to his room, where he hurriedly threw some
clean linen and toilet articles into a valise after fortifying
himself with another drink from the decanter by his bed.</p>

<p>A half-hour later they were off, the two other couples leading
the way in the Savoys' pearl-gray touring-car, Mercedes and himself
following behind in the landaulet. It was exhilarating and romantic
whirling down Broadway under the lights, and after they had crossed
the river and increased their speed, Mercedes complained of the
cold and he put his arm around her and held her tight with a
certain exultation. And he had his flask.</p>

<p>He told himself that everything would work out&mdash;somehow;
but as they jounced through the long hours he began to have greater
doubts as to her innocence. By the time they had reached Atlantic
City under the sickly light of a gibbous moon he no longer had any.
When at last they drew up in front of the dimly lit hotel he
disentangled himself from her with a sense of abasement and
lingered behind the group with averted face while they went to the
desk to register. Only then did he realize to what an extent he was
committed.</p>

<p>Thoroughly upset&mdash;frightened almost at what was in
prospect&mdash;and with a choking sensation in his gullet&mdash;he
debated sign ing a fictitious name. But the thought was repugnant
to him and he realized that, anyhow, such an act would inevitably
be misconstrued. He could not deny his visit when so
many&mdash;including the chauffeur of the landaulet&mdash;knew of
it. Better put on a bold face.</p>

<p>However, he would have avoided registering at all had not the
clerk, disregarding his elaborate unconcern, called his attention
to the omission. With a leaden arm and icy fingers he signed "R.
Kayne, N. Y.," at the end of the procession in a cramped, unnatural
handwriting. Then, as Savoy busied himself with the bell-hop, he
said to the clerk in an undertone:</p>

<p>"Put the others together. You can tuck me in anywhere."</p>

<p>Emotionally exhausted, fatigued by his long ride in the freezing
wind, it was nearly noon before he awoke in his room in the
"Annex," after a heavy alcoholic sleep. At home his return to
consciousness would have been greeted by tempered light falling
through silken curtains, the soft crackle of a fire, the sound of a
running bath, the sense of security that comes from familiar
objects. Now he looked about him bewildered.</p>

<p>The sunlight was pouring through dirty uncurtained windows upon
a warped floor of hard pine. He was lying uncomfortably upon the
sagging wire spring of a chipped white iron bed. The air was close
and smelled of stale tobacco. His mouth was thick with carpet dust
and a fine steel wire vibrated through his temples. The walls of
plaster, once white perhaps, were cracked and scarred by trunk
corners. A blowzy mirror stared at him from a badly stained bureau
top, on which was a porcelain tray containing ashes and a cigar
butt he could not remember putting there. A cuspidor stood upon a
soiled strip of carpet at the foot of the bed and next it lay his
open valise, the arms of an unfolded shirt sprawling from it in
drunken fashion. His golf-cap hung nonchalantly upon a bed-post. He
felt like a drummer after a spree! So this was the gay life!</p>

<p>He fumbled for his watch beneath the pillow&mdash;quarter past
twelve. The others must have been up for hours&mdash;no, Mercedes
never got up. Mercedes! He shuddered as he recalled their arrival
of the night before. What was he, Rufus Kayne, doing at Atlantic
City? It was horrible! He felt as if, having died, he had waked up
in a strange hostelry en route to some place of torment. How could
he have imagined for an instant that Mercedes was anything but what
he now knew her to be? His cheeks burned as he remembered their
tender talks over the telephone&mdash;their billet-doux&mdash;the
bus-top philandering. And she was in the same hotel with him at
that very moment. Suppose he should be seen with her&mdash;on the
boardwalk or in the dining-room? How could he help being seen with
her? How could he explain it?</p>

<p>In a flash he saw the scandal that would overwhelm the entire
family. It would kill Elizabeth! Smash his feeble old
father&mdash;who took such pride in him! Besmirch Diana, Claudia,
Sheila. They could never live it down. After all, he had pledged
his oath to be faithful to his wife. Recollections of the teachings
of his childhood, his half-belief in the prohibitions of his creed,
every somnolent feeling of decency and loyalty, united with his
instinct of self-preservation to emphasize the danger not only to
himself but to those he was responsible for.</p>

<p>He must get out of it somehow before it was too late. Thank God,
it was not too late! Better make a booby of himself than take a
chance of being compromised or of doing something he would regret
all his life. What did he care what these Broadway folk thought of
him? Who were they, anyhow?</p>

<p>Like that of a cornered rat, his eye darted round the shabby
room. There was a telephone on the wall by the door and he unhooked
it and asked the operator the hour of departure of the next train
for New York. One-ten! The bus left at twelve-fifty-five. He could
make it&mdash;if he hurried. He telephoned for his bill and began
to dress.</p>

<p>It would be easy enough to leave letters for Mercedes, Savoy,
and the chauffeur explaining that he had overlooked an important
dinner engagement and been obliged to return to New York. But he
was sick of deceptions; and he did not like the idea of having in
existence a letter on the hotel paper bearing his signature. He
gave the money for his bill to the chief bell-hop, who brought it
to his room, and without going to the office, descended in the
elevator to the ground level, where the porter handed him his
reservation. He handed the man five dollars, and instructed him to
tell Miss Delaval that he had been unexpectedly obliged to return
to the city and that he was placing his car at her disposal for the
afternoon.</p>

<p>Half an hour later as the express scudded across the
snow-covered fields he sat in the smoker feeling almost young. No
one could catch him now!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter 18. The Calm</h2>

<p>As the months passed and winter drew toward spring, a certain
peace came into the soul of Rufus Kayne&mdash;the relief of him
who, having plunged part way down the face of a precipice, has
caught a finger-hold in a crevice and, after hanging perilously
over the abyss, has managed to climb back and now lies panting
but&mdash;for the moment&mdash;safe upon the edge.
Something&mdash;if only a faint adumbration&mdash;of his earlier
affection for Elizabeth had crept back into their intercourse and,
although it may have, in fact, been only a greater toleration on
his part for her limitations, she noticed it and it gratified her.
Diana, too, was different, and often came into the library for a
chat with her father&mdash;a hitherto almost unheard-of thing. But
what gave the house itself an entirely new atmosphere was the
presence of Claudia and her children.</p>

<p>Had anything further been necessary to awaken Rufus from his
dream of romantic passion&mdash;to dispel his illusion of a
vanished youth miraculously restored&mdash;it was the realization
that he was a grandfather. Grandfathers, he perceived, did not do
the things that he had had it in his mind to do. At any rate, one
never heard of their doing them: any more than one heard of
great-grandfathers doing unseemly things. The time to sow one's
wild oats was in the spring&mdash;not when the snow was falling. No
more Indian summer for him! Not even a crop of winter wheat!
Tranquillity&mdash;!</p>

<p>Rufus had forgotten his years during his little flurry with
Mercedes, thinking of himself as still a young man, or, at any
rate, as possessed of an eternal middle age; but the presence of
two babies in the house accentuated the unseemly character of the
episode, and not a day, hardly an hour, went by that he did not
thank his stars that he had slipped out from her clutches. He had
not heard from her again after that night; and Mr. Savoy had
remained utterly silent&mdash;quite naturally, Rufus acknowledged,
after the shabby way in which he had abandoned them. He had to
confess in fairness that, after all, the trip had been merely the
outcome of Mr. Savoy's solicitude for his friend's success with the
young actress.</p>

<p>Oh, well, the whole thing had been a mistake and he had had
quite enough of these theatrical people. Thank Heaven, nobody in
his circle called anybody else "dear" or "dearie" or "darling" or
"sweetheart"&mdash;at least audibly&mdash;he could not have borne
it. He was through with Broadway&mdash;had washed his hands of it
forever. All he wanted now&mdash;after his abortive fling&mdash;was
to get his wild oats back into the seed-bag.</p>

<p>While he felt somewhat chagrined at the discovery that he was
already too old&mdash;at only fifty-five&mdash;for amorous romance,
he told himself that this kind of success demanded sacrifices and
that he must not expect to have his cake and eat it. The
golf-course was more in his line than the boudoir.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would wake up in the night and shudder at the
thought of what he had escaped, and once he dreamed that he was at
Atlantic City&mdash;so vividly that he started up in a sweat and
turned on the electric light in order to satisfy himself that he
was not there but safe in his own pink, silk-covered bed.</p>

<p>Tranquillity&mdash;that was all he wanted. Nothing perturbing or
hectic! He would take what he could get&mdash;respectably&mdash;and
be content. The daily sight of Miss Dolan gave rise to unpleasant
recollections and he transferred her to the trust department and
secured a male stenographer. Shortly afterward he issued an order
forbidding bobbed hair. He paid a great deal of attention to his
father, the old pirate, and as the days grew warmer walked with him
in the Park in the late afternoon, self-consciously aware of the
benches where he had so often sat with Mercedes, their faces
averted from the traffic.</p>

<p>He was shocked to find how fast the old man was aging. At times
it almost seemed as if his mind wandered a little. A scandal would
have finished him. On these occasions Rufus was doubly glad that he
had acted as he had. Sometimes he would take his father with little
Peter and Bess and spend a whole Sunday morning wandering around
the Zoo and the Carousel, the starchy Spedding hovering
disapprovingly in the offing.</p>

<p>A grandfather! And the pirate a great-grandfather! When to Rufus
it only seemed yesterday that he had sat on the front steps of the
Remsen Street house singing "Pierre de Bon ton de Paree!" Yet that
was forty years ago! During that forty years he had struggled,
schemed, manoeuvred, and worried to become what he was. As he sat
in the Park watching his two grandchildren sprawling on the young
grass he realized that the forty years had been wasted. All his
father wanted was peace. All he wanted was peace. Funny! It was so
little to want, so easy to get.</p>

<p>If only Diana would marry some nice chap; and Claudia could be
made happier; and Sheila brought to her senses! Up to this time he
had not realized that his own happiness depended in any way upon
the happiness of his children. Now he saw that it was all part and
parcel of the same thing; just as the happiness of his father was.
Dear old pirate! During these days not a shadow troubled his
conscience. His heart was even light. The weed had died; something
of the flower's fragrance lingered.</p>

<p>To Peter B. his great-grandchildren were an ecstasy. As a young
man he had been too much occupied with business to take any
particular interest in Rufus or James or Bridget. His
railroad-busting had left him little time for domesticity. But
now&mdash;in his old age&mdash;these two little people stirred in
him a deep and wondering interest with which was combined a curious
quality of understanding. He had never understood Diana or Claudia.
Sheila had always bewildered him. And he had never wanted to
understand any of his own children except Rufus.</p>

<p>Of late years it had seemed as though the world had been getting
away from him. Everything had changed so since he was
young&mdash;everything! People, houses, ships, the way you got
about, what doctors did to you&mdash;no more
kings&mdash;Bamum&mdash;Henry Ward Beecher&mdash;Artemus
Ward&mdash;Jo Jefferson&mdash;Buffalo Bill, dead&mdash;the
government taking all you had in taxes&mdash;Germany a
republic&mdash;everything in a mess&mdash;this Jewish fellow
Einstein upsetting the universe&mdash;these outlandish ideas about
free love, and "glands"&mdash;aeroplanes buzzing around
everywhere&mdash;the way they could photograph your
insides&mdash;that man Wells saying the world was twenty-five
million years old&mdash;and women with short hair!</p>

<p>There was hardly anything that hadn't altered 'so as to be
almost unrecognizable. Yet in this world of flux, where, as the
chap said, the only changeless thing was the law of change, where
you never knew what crazy idea was going to be sprung on you and
nothing was too preposterous to be a fact&mdash;cows being milked
by electricity, for instance, and old ladies prancing around and
smoking cigarettes&mdash;in this wabbling, rocking, jazzing
universe where nothing seemed the same as when he was a boy, there
was one thing that never changed&mdash;childhood. Constant,
immutable, unvarying&mdash;the great permanent fact that told him
that he was still "at home"! Children were exactly the same as they
always had been. They would always be the same&mdash;even if the
world lasted for twenty-five million years more.</p>

<p>Of course boys and girls were not the same&mdash;he should say
not! But it made no difference whether children were white or black
or yellow, whether their hair was straight, curled, or in pigtails,
or whether they ate off gold or china or pine boards, or wore
calico or ermine, a "g"-string or nothing at all, or whether their
papas were emperors or millionaires or street-sweepers&mdash;all
were exactly the same. They spoke the same language, they played
the same games, the same things would make them smile. A sugar-plum
was legal tender in the republic of childhood all over the
world.</p>

<p>The pirate took an intense pleasure in this knowledge. If one
understood this all-important fact, it gave one the key to a sort
of masonic order to which all children belonged. Old Peter had the
grip and all the passwords. He knew just the casual, matter-of-fact
way one should speak to a child, in which pieces of string and
glass, giants and dwarfs, lions and bears, policemen and nurses,
milk-bottles, safety-pins, fairies, and bedtime are all equally
important and coexisting facts.</p>

<p>Rufus had discovered him, shortly after Claudia's return,
engaged in demonstrating this near the entrance of the Park, by
throwing coppers to a group of temporarily deserted
infants&mdash;dad in lace and ermine&mdash;who, under the impulse
of a disgracefully plebeian possessive instinct, hurled themselves
upon the ground with squeals of joy and fell furiously upon one
another like so many little paupers. Therefore, since the pirate,
little Peter, and baby Bess understood one another, they became
great friends and spent most of their time together; and as this
enabled Claudia to be more with Nigel, it gave the greater
satisfaction all round.</p>

<p>For, in defiance of nature and probability, Lady Harrowdale had
arrived home from her stormy voyage across the Atlantic strangely
happy. From the first the whole adventure had partaken of the
quality of a mediseval romance&mdash;he the valiant, the beautiful,
the mystic knight, she the maiden in distress. She loved him as she
had never loved, and he loved her passionately in return, with an
attitude almost reverential. Rufus approved the attachment, for not
only was Craig a fine fellow but it would solve the problem of
Claudia's future. She could get a divorce. They could marry. He
would set Nigel up in some high-class business connected with Wall
Street, give Claudia a handsome allowance, and she would be as well
off as if her first En glis hm an had not proved a scamp.</p>

<p>Diana, who hitherto had paid but scant attention to her sister
except as a subject for cynical and satirical dissection, was well
satisfied. She had viewed Claudia's marriage to Harrowdale with no
favor but as none of her business, and so had held her tongue. Now
her sister's escape from England under the protection of a man for
whom she knew that Lloyd had the highest respect, and the pending
presumptive marriage of the hero and heroine of the adventure,
surrounded Claudia for her with a glamour, which Maitland's
connection with it intensified. For Diana no longer endeavored to
conceal her growing regard for this youth so different in all his
traditions and ideals from herself, whom fate had pitchforked into
her life and who had become so much involved in their affairs.</p>

<p>Yet they had seen each other only a few times since the night at
"The Revels." Diana had dashed off again almost immediately to join
a party on Devereaux's house-boat in Florida, and, as she had
stopped over at Jekyl Island and Hot Springs upon her return, had
been away nearly six weeks. During that time Lloyd had heard
nothing from her.</p>

<p>He was immersed now in the business of the trust company and
spent many hours each week in the company of Rufus, who assigned
him office room near his own in the Utopia's building. There had
been some dissatisfaction with the company's new enterprises, and
at Lloyd's suggestion a new corporation with larger charter powers
had been formed to take over some of them. This had kept him very
busy, but he had found time to dine at the Kaynes' several times,
and once or twice had been included in theatre-parties given by her
mother for Sheila, who now openly rated him to her family as
"perfectly stunning" and a "terrible darling." Sheila, in fact, had
been looking very well on the few occasions when he had passed an
evening in her society, and her conversation, while no less
voluble, seemed to him less hectic. She was certainly a nice kid.
He tried, quite hopelessly, to banish Diana from his mind.</p>

<p>The discharge of Capper, the footman, who had sought him out,
had upset and incensed him, but he had stifled his resentment and
kept his peace, making a place for the man at the Irving Place
establishment as a half valet, half general servant to the various
lodgers, who paid his wages between them.</p>

<p>Nigel had returned after his ten weeks' absence tanned and
happy. It had been a regular lark, he said, and he had enjoyed
every minute of it. His spirits were irrepressible, and his delight
at finding Capper installed as their majordomo was unbounded. But
he avoided mentioning Claudia to Lloyd, feeling that until she was
made free from her husband by American law it was ill taste for him
to disclose his attachment even to his roommate and friend.</p>

<p>And so to the guardian angel of sailors, drunken men, and
lunatics, or whatever special providence was then watching over the
house of Kayne, it may have seemed in the mad month of earliest
spring that all was well, and indeed better than it ever had been;
for Rufus had had his belated fling and no harm had come of it,
Claudia with her two children had achieved a safe return, Sheila
had been saved&mdash;snatched like a brand from the
burning&mdash;and Diana had awakened to a strange new sense of
responsibility.</p>

<p>All these things had come to pass without the public or any of
their friends being any the wiser. To the world at large, from the
"white wing" scraping the asphalt in front of the Cathedral to the
Reverend Mr. Thrum, the Kaynes were still leading the identical
lives which they had always led. The same motors rolled to the
curb, the same footmen ran up the steps, Jarmon opened the front
door just as usual, and the family came and went as if none of the
events heretofore chronicled had taken place. Yet with the
exception of Jarmon and Mrs. Kayne, and the two old men living
their detached and physically exalted existence upon the top story
of the house, there was not one of them to whom the winter had not
brought a vital change.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter 19. The Law Trap</h2>

<p>On a morning about three weeks after Claudia's arrival in New
York, Rufus appeared at the doorway of Maitland's office, which
adjoined his own at the Utopia Trust Company. He looked, the
younger man thought, fitter than he had seemed for some time, less
puffy under the eyes, a better color, more on his toes.</p>

<p>"By the way," remarked the banker, "my daughter&mdash;Lady
Harrowdale&mdash;is coming down this morning. Will it be convenient
for you to see her?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly!"</p>

<p>"I guess you know what she wants&mdash;and why she wants
it?"</p>

<p>Maitland shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, but I'll be glad to help her in any way I can. Wouldn't it
be better for her to see Mr. Pepperill?"</p>

<p>"Damn Pepperill!"</p>

<p>Rufus stepped over the threshold and in front of the lawyer's
desk.</p>

<p>"Look here!" he said, "I don't mind telling you that I'm through
with Pepperill&mdash;so far as my private affairs are concerned. Of
course he's the attorney for the trust company and will continue to
be so&mdash;nominally, at any rate&mdash;but I don't care for his
manner. I'm sick of his patronizing airs. He's too infernally
supercilious. He turned me over to you, anyhow. I don't want
him&mdash;I do want you."</p>

<p>Lloyd was embarrassed. He was fully aware of his partner's
attitude toward the Kaynes, and for some unformulated reason he
slightly resented it. They might be individually and collectively
what Mr. Pepperill had said they were on that walk down Fifth
Avenue the November before&mdash;he could even now remember exactly
how the old lawyer had stigmatized each and every one of
them&mdash;but he felt somehow that there was an element of
unfairness&mdash;at least of prejudice&mdash;in his point of view.
How much did the old gentleman really know about them, anyhow?</p>

<p>"So far as Lady Harrowdale is concerned, the matter is already
in my hands," he answered. "We can cross the other bridge when we
come to it."</p>

<p>Rufus nodded approval.</p>

<p>"Pepperill is getting old&mdash;crotchety!" he commented.
"You've done a first-class job so far for Claudia. I hope you'll
manage to finish it up as well."</p>

<p>"How are Miss Diana and Miss Sheila?" asked Lloyd.</p>

<p>"Both fit as fiddles!" answered their father. "'Diana's brown as
a berry, and as for Sheila, she looks like a different girl
altogether. You know she's taken up this Yogi business&mdash;a lot
of her friends have and it seems to be doing her a world of
good."</p>

<p>"Doctor Dhal, you mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know the man's name. Very likely that's it. Of course
there's a lot of bunk mixed in with it&mdash;they have a weird
lingo&mdash;pretend they're sitting cross-legged on lily-pads and
all that sort of rot&mdash;but he gives them exercises that
certainly do wonders."</p>

<p>"I don't care much for Doctor Dhal," said Maitland, recalling
vividly the evening at Diana's studio.</p>

<p>"I guess he can't do them any harm. Well, look out the best you
can for Claudia!"</p>

<p>Rufus turned and walked toward his own room, leaving Maitland
alone. So Diana was back again, was she? And brown as a nut! The
little pagan! Across the underwriting agreement lying before him
floated a dim mist, and through it he heard the laughter of running
water, saw nymphs dancing among tree-trunks, caught the gleam of
white marble and the odor of moss and dead leaves.</p>

<p>He pushed back his chair and went to the window. Across the
crater formed by the tops of the great buildings he could see the
deep blue of the harbor glinting in the sunlight&mdash;like Diana's
eyes. The marble shafts rose about him like the columns of Grecian
temples&mdash;the white steam&mdash;like clouds of incense. Her
temple&mdash;he the worshipper! The world was full of
light&mdash;sparkling&mdash;joyous! White arms held themselves out
to him. He breathed deeply&mdash;tremulously. A wonderful
world&mdash;golden, like Diana.</p>

<p>The voice of the uniformed attendant interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Lady Harrowdale to see you, sir."</p>

<p>A slight figure was framed in the doorway. He had never seen her
before and he was startled at the contrast between her appearance
and that of Diana. Claudia, in deference to her complexion, had
always affected dark colors.</p>

<p>"Lady Harrowdale? Come in."</p>

<p>They shook hands and he offered her a chair.</p>

<p>"I suppose father told you to expect me?"</p>

<p>Her tone was both wistful and apprehensive.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! You know I've had charge of your affairs for some
time," he answered for her encouragement.</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes, finding it difficult to go on.</p>

<p>"I want you to get me a divorce," she said finally.</p>

<p>He frowned. So far as he had been concerned the idea of a
divorce had not entered into the original scheme. It was because
she could not get a divorce in the country of her legal residence
that he had urged her escape from England&mdash;and from her
husband. Why hadn't her father spoken to him and saved her the
embarrassment of an interview with a lawyer?</p>

<p>"But, Lady Harrowdale!" he protested. "Did not Nigel&mdash;Mr.
Craig&mdash;explain to you that your leaving England with your
children was in lieu of a divorce? that it was owing to the fact
that the English courts would not grant you one that we decided to
have you take the matter into your own hands?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, without looking up. "He didn't tell me. I don't
think he knew. I am quite sure he did not know," she added, with a
rising color.</p>

<p>Lloyd was distressed. Was it possible that he had never
discussed that phase of the situation with his friend? He was
forced to admit that it was; and that his own emphasis had always
been upon the purely adventurous aspect of the affair.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that you cannot get a divorce in this country
which will be good in England, Lady Harrowdale," he announced in a
tone of sympathy.</p>

<p>Her color melted away.</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"It's quite simple&mdash;as a legal proposition. In a word, and
as applicable to your own case, the English courts would refuse to
recognize a decree of divorce secured outside their jurisdiction by
the wife of a British subject domiciled and resident in England.
The fact that you were married to him in this country would be
viewed as immaterial. Your husband being an Englishman, his
marriage is regarded by the English courts as an English marriage,
to be dissolved only by English law. You had not the legal grounds
for a divorce in England and for that reason were helpless. No
decree obtained here would avail you there. In England you would
still be Harrowdale's wife."</p>

<p>She looked at him, incredulous.</p>

<p>"Oh, that can't be the law!" she exclaimed. "How terrible!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted. "The English law does seem rather
cruel."</p>

<p>"And if I went ahead just the same and got an American
divorce&mdash;?" She hesitated.</p>

<p>"If you should marry again, your English husband could divorce
you under English law on&mdash;the only ground they recognize."</p>

<p>He let her have it. There was no use min cin g matters. She
winced, and flushed again to her hair.</p>

<p>"Oh! But what can I do!" she cried helplessly. Maitland was very
sorry for her.</p>

<p>"Of course," he answered, "you could get a divorce in some State
like Maine or Nevada on the ground of abandonment. That would not
be difficult. You would simply have to take up a residence there
for the required statutory period and allege that your husband had
deserted you. Hundreds&mdash;perhaps thousands&mdash;of such
decrees are handed down every year. But unless your husband
actually appeared in person or by attorney in the case, the decree
would have only a limited operation. You would be married in some
States and not married in others&mdash;and you would still, as I
said, be Harrowdale's wife under the law of England."</p>

<p>"How unjust!"</p>

<p>She clenched her fists, then looked at him appealingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, please help me! Isn't there some way of my getting a
divorce that will be good in England? Can't nay marriage be
annulled or something? I was so young&mdash;and so frightfully
ignorant! Nobody told me anything! Harrowdale has never contributed
a cent to my support or to that of my children. He's been openly
unfaithful to me and publicly joked about it! What sort of justice
is it that keeps me bound to him?"</p>

<p>"English!" answered Lloyd grimly. "There are, no doubt, hundreds
of American women in precisely your position."</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do!" she begged of him, wringing her hands.
"What shall I do!"</p>

<p>He would have given much to be able to tell her that it made no
matter what she did so long as she was happy&mdash;but he could
not. Yet to him it seemed that here was of the law's iniquities the
wickedest of all. A beautiful young woman&mdash;on the threshold of
life&mdash;shackled by an archaic system to a confessedly
unfaithful husband because she could not prove what the English
statutes called "cruelty"&mdash;whereas, had she on her part been
once unfaithful to him, the same courts would have granted him
instant relief. That the poor child was Diana's sister made it all
the worse for him. She was like a drooping flower thirsting for air
and moisture. Could he crush her to the ground under the heavy heel
of legal ethics?</p>

<p>"I don't know," he began, "whether or not you want my personal
opinion of what you should do."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Yes!" she cried eagerly. "That's exactly what I do
want."</p>

<p>"Then," he said gently, "I should let it be enough that I no
longer was compelled to live with my husband. An American divorce
would not improve your position, and there would be unpleasant
publicity and a certain amount of legal hocus-pocus connected with
getting it. You would have to base your claim on an alleged
desertion by your husband, whereas in fact, if not strictly in law,
you have deserted him, by running away from England. Your status
would always be ambiguous&mdash;a sort of 'grass-widowhood.' You
don't want to become a member of any widely advertised divorce
colony?"</p>

<p>He spoke a shade ironically to try her out.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Particularly if you don't want to marry again."</p>

<p>She bowed her head on the desk.</p>

<p>"Even if you did, my advice would be all the stronger. For in
that case your own church would not recognize your second marriage
after a decree granted merely on the ground of abandonment.
Harrowdale could drag your name through the divorce courts in
England and get judgment against you just as if you had never been
freed from him here. Even if you were prepared to face
that&mdash;live it down yourself&mdash;it would be pretty tough on
your children to have for a mother a woman who had been
held&mdash;even in a foreign court&mdash;to be living illegally
with the man who called him self her husband. Luckily, though, we
don't have to go into that. You really wouldn't accomplish anything
by getting an American divorce and you don't need one."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;I do!" she confessed. "I never knew! I
thought that of course&mdash;I&mdash;could get free! Who could have
imagined that there were such horrible laws&mdash;so
heartless&mdash;utterly unfair? And now&mdash;now there's not only
myself and the children to consider; there's&mdash;there's&mdash;"
she raised her face streaked with tears to his.
"&mdash;<i>Nigel!</i>"</p>

<p>"Nigel?" he cried. "Craig?"</p>

<p>The surprise of it lashed his face like a whip. Nigel! Out of
the frying-pan into the fire. After all it was natural enough. He
could not blame her for falling in love with the boy, or
Nigel&mdash;anybody, for that matter&mdash;for falling in love with
her. Why had not Nigel given him some inkling of the situation? A
hypersensitive delicacy probably. He got up and walked to the
window again, as if to find in the swirling smoke-wreaths some
answer to his riddle.</p>

<p>There was a light footfall outside the door. Diana, in a buff
sport suit and blue muffler capped by an ochre tarn, stood upon the
threshold glancing quizzically from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Hello, Claudia!&mdash;Whose funeral is this?" she asked in the
low, husky voice that to Lloyd was sweeter than the bells of
Shannon. "What are you and Mr. Savonarola weeping about? Is there
room for another mourner?"</p>

<p>Then she rested her hand on her sister's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry!" she said. "I didn't mean to be rotten. But what has
happened?"</p>

<p>Claudia pressed Diana's hand against her cheek.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's <i>my</i> funeral!" she answered.</p>

<p>Diana turned quickly to Lloyd. All her jocularity had
vanished.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble? Can't Claudia get a divorce?"</p>

<p>Maitland made a helpless gesture.</p>

<p>"Not one that would be recognized in England&mdash;and Craig is
an Englishman. If she married him here, Harrowdale could divorce
her in London. Besides, no clergyman of her own church would marry
her. Her position would be ambiguous and intolerable. She would be
married to one man in one place and to another man in another;
Nigel's legal wife in New York and Nevada&mdash;and a bigamist in
England. Think of her children!"</p>

<p>Diana's eyes glinted.</p>

<p>"Is that the law?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Unquestionably."</p>

<p>"Then," she cried, "I would let the law go to the devil! Who
cares whether her divorce is good in England or Siam or Patagonia?
She's never going to live there. If she marries the man she loves,
what difference does it make to her what Harrowdale can do under
English law? Let him divorce her if he wants to! As many times as
he chooses! How can you stand there and calmly interpose these
technical objections? They love each other, don't they? Under the
laws of the United States a way can be found for them to marry?
You're speaking merely as a lawyer! Why don't you talk like a human
being? If I loved a man, I'd go to him law or no law&mdash;marriage
or no marriage!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Diana!" expostulated Claudia.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would!" retorted Lloyd. "But you are not my client.
It is my duty to advise your sister as to the law and the practical
consequences in the event of her taking such a step."</p>

<p>"But who can tell what the 'consequences'&mdash;as you call
them&mdash;would be?" she asked. "We all know plenty of women who
have gone out to Nevada and got divorces and nobody thinks any the
less of them. As for your preposterous clergyman&mdash;! Who cares
whether he is married by a priest or a rabbi or an alderman?
Personally I'd prefer a justice of the peace&mdash;as simpler and
cheaper. The world looks deeper than that if it looks at all, which
it usually doesn't. Nowadays people regard this kind of thing as
none of their business. After all&mdash;is it?</p>

<p>"The world has progressed a long way since these old laws were
invented," she continued indignantly. "Such laws ought to be
scrapped&mdash;and they will be. As for the church, am I going to
let my sister suffer all her life because some idiot like Mr. Thrum
isn't willing to read the marriage service over her? Did you ever
hear him say grace? Do you suppose Thrum ever sanctified any thing?
If Claudia wants to marry Nigel Craig, let her get any sort of a
divorce she can&mdash;and marry him&mdash;any way she wants!"</p>

<p>She turned and placed her arm protectingly about her sister.</p>

<p>"Come along, dear!" she said. "After all, you're free, white,
and twenty-one. I've no patience with these old-fashioned theories
that sacrifice the spirit to the letter and the heart to the
conscience!"</p>

<p>"Shall we ask your father's opinion?" suggested Lloyd.</p>

<p>Diana threw back her head, and a beam of sunlight from the high
window played through her hair.</p>

<p>"What has he got to do with it? Do you suppose that I would let
his opinion influence Claudia one way or another? What's the use
pretending? Whose fault is it that she's in this mess? If my father
had been on his job&mdash;or if I had been, for that
matter&mdash;Claudia would never have been allowed to marry a
bounder like that! Of course dad realizes his mistake now. How
could he help it? But he has forfeited his right to be considered.
His judgment isn't what it should be. He's lost his point of view.
He can't put the right values on things. Let's leave dad out of
it!"</p>

<p>A smile fluttered over her lips.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Savonarola?"</p>

<p>Claudia looked up at her proudly. Diana's words had inspired her
with hope. After all, Lloyd asked himself, wasn't he playing a
rather pusillanimous part? Suppose instead of Claudia and
Harrowdale it were Diana and himself? Would he hesitate to marry
her?</p>

<p>"Oh, you wonderful girl!" he thought, hardly able to resist an
impulse to kiss her hair just where the sunbeam turned it to gold.
"You marvellous, wonderful girl!"</p>

<p>But he realized that he must not let his inclination influence
his judgment. Even if one could cast off the shackles of
conscience, disregard the doctrines of one's church, one could not
defy society. There it stood like a policeman with his dub. And he
knew that it had a way of using it.</p>

<p>"I wish I could say that I agree with you," he replied, knowing
that he was inviting her scorn. "But I don't. These archaic ideas,
as you call them, are based on pretty fundamental prindples. What
you say about going to a man if you loved him, and all that, is the
way they write in novels. But it doesn't work out in practice, and
not always in the novels either. All I say is that Lady Harrowdale
should consider carefully before she decides to take so vital a
step."</p>

<p>"I shan't call you 'Mr. Savonarola' any longer!" retorted Diana.
"Didn't some one say that the boy who wasn't w illing to take a
chance was already an old man? After this, I think I shall call you
'Mr. Methuselah '! Come along, Claudia! We might as well go up and
ask Mr. Thrum what he thinks about it."</p>

<p>Claudia held out her hand to him.</p>

<p>"Don't mind Di! This has been very upsetting to both of us. I'm
all confused. I don't know what to do. But thank you very much for
your advice. I'm sure it's excellent!"</p>

<p>Lloyd shook hands, first with her and then with Diana. The
wicked young creature gave him a sphinx-like smile.</p>

<p>"It's the advice of a very good young man!" she said.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter 20. "Dictum"</h2>

<p>Lloyd found difficulty in concentrating his thoughts upon the
trust company's affairs during the rest of the day. He felt that he
had been placed in a false position by Diana; her sarcasm had
wounded him. After all, he had not attempted to dictate to Claudia.
He had merely advised her as a lawyer. Given her sound&mdash;even,
one might say, worldly&mdash;advice.</p>

<p>Yet he was worried. He knew that he had made a poor show of
himself before Diana. Might she not be right in what she had said
about sacrificing the spirit to the letter and the heart to the
conscience? What authority had he to presume to tell any other
human being what he or she ought or ought not to do? <i>Was</i> he, as she
had hinted, an old man who wasn't willing to take a chance? He
admitted that there might be something in the indictment. Hadn't he
perhaps confused law with morality? Wasn't there, really, something
higher than law? And of this could anybody be the judge except the
individual himself? You could hardly expect a lawyer to take the
stand that the law might go to the devil. Only a breezy young
sportswoman like Diana could have the nerve to do that! Yet she had
made him feel hidebound, dry as dust! He wondered if he were
overburdened with conscience just as some people were overburdened
with money. He did not like being called "Mr. Savonarola" or "Mr.
Methuselah" either! Nobody else seemed to take that view of him. He
always got on well with other men, knew himself to be generally
popular at his dubs&mdash;the Players, for instance.</p>

<p>He liked the Players, for it was cheap, it was
convenient&mdash;his quarters were just around the corner, and,
while the members were a heterogeneous lot, their very diversity
was entertaining, and almost all of them earned their living by
being interested in what was going on in the world. At the Players
you could always find some chap, in the smoking-room or downstairs
watching the billiard-players, who had just come back from Tahiti
or Moscow, or had been interviewing Lloyd George, or was going to
write a book that he profoundly believed would revolutionize
sodety. One of these last, old Peter Parradym, was even then
standing on the landing smoking a small, black pipe as Lloyd
entered the dub, where he had gone to look for Nigel.</p>

<p>"Hello, Maitland," nodded the author, whose whimsical face
belied the acidity of his style. "Looking for anybody?"</p>

<p>"Haven't seen Nigel Craig, have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's around here somewhere," answered Parradym. "Are you
going to be in New York for a while?"</p>

<p>"I merely live here," Maitland informed him. "What are you up
to?"</p>

<p>Parradym came slowly downstairs.</p>

<p>"My usual stunt&mdash;a novel. Horribly ungrateful work. By the
time you've written it and got it published, nobody cares what
you've been writing about. It's all over, including the
shouting."</p>

<p>"Well, what <i>are</i> you writing about?" asked Lloyd. "Why not
select a topic of permanent interest?"</p>

<p>"There isn't any!" replied the author mournfully refilling his
pipe. "When I began my book everybody was terribly excited over the
demoralization of the young&mdash;this 'flapper' stuff. By the time
I get it done and out in covers, they'll all be wailing about the
depravity of the old! In fact I think they've begun already!"</p>

<p>Maitland laughed sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Then you must cover them both!"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm trying to do," plaintively answered Parradym.
"I'm doing a novel of three generations of the New York of to-day.
It's interesting work, very, notwithstanding that nobody ever
believes what you say, even though it's true. They're right, in a
way; mere facts don't constitute truth, any more than a nose, eyes,
and teeth make a face. I know my facts&mdash;they're pretty
bad&mdash;and hard to believe, some of 'em, but the inference to be
drawn from them is another matter. It would take a wiser chap than
I am to say what we're coming to; whether this so-called revolt
upon the part of the young is in the end going to make life saner
or plunge us permanently into sensuality. Just now we're getting
the sensuality."</p>

<p>"You mean that seriously?" challenged Lloyd.</p>

<p>Parradym stared at him.</p>

<p>"Do I mean it? Dear boy, I know it!"</p>

<p>"Maybe it's merely superficial!" remarked Lloyd reminiscently.
"Doesn't mean any thing. 'They're just silly kids.'"</p>

<p>The writer grunted.</p>

<p>"Superficial? Not much! There's a distinct swing everywhere
toward sexual laxity. Not merely among the smart folk&mdash;but
among the people whom we have always regarded as being the
back-bone of society. Just listen the next time you go out to
dinner and compare what you hear with what you heard ten years
ago.</p>

<p>"The girls discuss subjects that their mothers would have died
rather than mention. It wasn't out of prudishness, either! It was a
natural instinct of self-preservation!</p>

<p>"Frankly, I'm a reactionary on this sex stuff. There's a lot of
so-called morality that is merely lack of opportunity. Why supply
it? We're all naturally curious to find things out
first-hand&mdash;particularly those which are forbidden. Shove them
under our noses and, well&mdash;you can't blame people much if they
yield to temptation. There wouldn't be much difference of opinion
about a father who took his son into a barroom and ordered a Scotch
high-ball, showed it to him and said that it was a great drink, but
that, while he might smell it, he mustn't touch it! You'd classify
the old man right with the morons, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>Maitland smiled acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Well, son! You can draw the analogy as well as I can. The
subject's personally distasteful to me, but I can't stand all this
rot that otherwise sensible people are getting off about what is as
plain as the nose on one's face. At the best a girl can't be pawed
without having some of the bloom&mdash;or, at any rate, the
powder&mdash;rubbed off!"</p>

<p>"I quite agree!" said his listener drily.</p>

<p>"It's a mighty subtle and insidious poison," went on Parradym.
"And it's everywhere&mdash;disguised under the most innocent
appearances. Look at this 'Doctor Dhal,' as he calls himself."</p>

<p>"Who?" demanded Maitland quickly.</p>

<p>"Why, 'Dhal Shastri'&mdash;the fellow who runs the Butterfly
Club and has half the fashionable women in New York following him
around and contributing to his support. You know what's really at
the bottom of it! His clients don't, of course&mdash;in the earlier
stages anyhow. They hear how wonderful his exercises are, and they
go to one of his places and do a little hard work for the first
time in their lives&mdash;and naturally they feel fine think
they've been rejuvenated. Well, perhaps a lot of 'em are. Then his
assistants pick out the easy marks and flatter them by saying that
they are among the rare few qualified to understand the mysteries
of the weird religion which the great Doctor Dhal teaches. They
fall for it and go down there. That is where Dhal gets in his
insidious work. Through their natural curiosity stimulated by a
peculiar physical attraction of his own&mdash;something like
Rasputin's, I fancy&mdash;Dhal gradually gets them deeper and
deeper under his influence, until they half believe in him, are
half in love with him, and are wholly afraid of him. An
extraordinary phenomenon!"</p>

<p>"But isn't this known?" protested Maitland.</p>

<p>"He's been shown up in the newspapers time after time!" answered
Parradym. "Indicted here and in other States, but never convicted.
Jerome, Whitman&mdash;all the district attorneys knew about him and
had his number. He's not a Yogi&mdash;he was a professional
bicycle-rider before he became the menace to society that he is
to-day."</p>

<p>Maitland could hardly credit it. Yet he had himself been witness
to the influence which the man had seemed to exert over Mrs.
Wingate and her friend. If, as Kayne had said, Sheila had taken up
with him, the connection must be broken up in short order.</p>

<p>"But are all his followers necessarily victims?" he asked.</p>

<p>"By no means!" returned the novelist. "That's where he's so
clever. Plenty of men and women go down to his place and never
suspect what goes on behind the scenes. All they see is a lot of
other respectable-looking people like themselves who indulge in
games which are rather fantastic, to be sure, but which in
themselves are harmless enough. They cook and sweep and make beds
and play basket-ball and dance around in tights&mdash;'Annettes,' I
believe they're called&mdash;and they really enjoy it. Swear by the
old boy! It's only the ones with a natural predilection for the
rites that are practised in secret who are 'initiated' into the
inner circle. After all, I suppose what occurs there occasionally
is no worse than what goes on in many of the hotels at Atlantic
City most of the time. But that is only one manifestation of what
I'm talking about. What do you think of conditions yourself? You
probably go around a bit. You're an 'available.' How does the jazz
age strike you?"</p>

<p>"As pretty rotten," answered Lloyd tersely.</p>

<p>"Well, so it does me!" ejaculated Parradym. "And I don't think
it's entirely the fault of the young either. No doubt the whole
business will right itself, but in the meantime there's going to be
a lot of unhappiness. I like boys and girls. Haven't any of my own
or maybe I wouldn't. Want to give 'em a fair deal. They're bully,
most of 'em, especially the boys. It's natural for them to want
happiness&mdash;just as we all do&mdash;and to mistake pleasure for
it&mdash;just as we do. We're all living at high speed&mdash;all
imagine that the more things we crowd into a day the more we get
out of it. Rot, of course. Can't blame the kids for thinking the
same thing. They speed it up&mdash;and we speed it up for them.
They're not really interested or even amused; they're only
excited."</p>

<p>"I should say," assented Lloyd, sitting down on the arm of the
nearest chair and taking out his cigarette-case, "that most of the
people here in New York were trying so hard to have a good time
that they overloaded themselves with pleasure and got spiritual
indigestion!"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" agreed Parradym in turn. "But that doesn't explain
the new attitude of the young people toward their parents and
toward life since the war. And they've got one!</p>

<p>"You can understand it on the part of the boys. We sent a milli
on of them over for cannon-fodder, to make the world safe for
'business as usual,' and the ones that came back are wiser than
when they went. They know now that with all our hurrah over them at
the time, we were mighty glad we were over military age. It's made
them pretty cynical. They're right in thinking that the world owes
them something. I don't mind telling you that the world owes them a
lot."</p>

<p>Maitland made no reply.</p>

<p>"They've had a great disillusionment," continued Parradym
seriously. "They've had a chance to see the difference between what
mankind pretends to be and what it really is. You can't fool them
any longer with noble sentiments and high principles. They don't
regard girls as angels any longer. Anyhow, they look 'em straight
in the eye and call spades spades. No more humbug for them.</p>

<p>"And the girls have naturally been affected by the same spirit.
In a word, the war has knocked all the old Victorian ideas sky
high. You can't put anything over on the modern child. Bunk doesn't
go any longer. The children are 'wise,' and for the time being it
hasn't made them attractive.</p>

<p>"Discounting all the false impressions created by the girls who
try to advertise themselves and win popularity by pretending to be
vamps, or who merely try to shock for the love of shocking, as a
lot of them do, the girls to-day have lost something that they
can't afford to be without. They're a lot faster than they ever
thought of being before&mdash;a little tough. They're allowed to do
and say things that a girl would have been dropped for ten years
ago. In a word, they're too sophisticated. They like being
manhandled and they've no manners!"</p>

<p>"Isn't the whole world the same way?" inquired Lloyd.</p>

<p>"That is what I'm coming to!" answered Parradym. "It is! The
whole world is in revolt against the old
hypocrisies&mdash;religious, political, and social. The children
are sharing in it, and motors and movies, jazz music, feminism and
woman suffrage, are all helping. We've discarded the old
sanctimonious, straight-laced theology that pretended to believe in
Gladstone's 'Impregnable Rock of Holy Scripture,' when, in reality,
its real doctrine was that 'what a man don't know can't hurt him';
but we've got nothing in its place.</p>

<p>"People go around growling about children having no reverence
any longer&mdash;when they haven't any themselves! 'Honor thy
father and thy mother'?&mdash;Good Lord! How on earth can they,
with their mothers cutting up the way they do, dancing, and
drinking and gambling, and having 'emotional friendships' with boys
half their age?</p>

<p>"When you come right down to it, it's a tribute to human nature
that the children are not worse than they are. Most of the girls,
in spite of their gabble, are surprisingly innocent. It's my
opinion that the young folks are objectionable less for what they
are than for what they are not; and that, whatever they are or are
not, they are exactly what they have been brought up to be, what
you'd expect from knowing their fathers and mothers and the homes
they've come from.</p>

<p>"On the one hand, you've got a lot of silly women who ruin their
children by spoiling them; and on the other you've got a lot who
are so much interested in having a good time themselves that they
pay no attention to them at all. In neither case is it fair to
blame the kids. They've never had a chance to learn anything; never
have been made to do anything worth while.</p>

<p>"The reason the boys, as a whole, are nicer than the girls is
that the majority of them have been educated at boarding-schools,
away from their parents. Hotels and apartments are poor substitutes
for houses. And even houses don't have to be homes. There's no
sense of permanence; of being a part of the social organism and
accountable to it. You can hire a social secretary to 'bring out'
your daughter for you, but you can't hire a woman to be a mother to
her and expect to build up moral character at so much per month.
Our young people go out into society without having the faintest
idea that there is such a thing as a world of retribution and
punishment.</p>

<p>"And there you are! Why don't the parents have the proper sense
of duty? It's because they've got their minds fixed on cocktails
and Texas Oil, golf, bridge, Palm Beach and the Rue de la Paix.
It's because they spend their lives trying to avoid responsibility,
by refusing to perform the simplest obligations of parenthood or
citizenship. In a word, it's because they live 'by bread
alone'!"</p>

<p>"That's pretty good stuff, Parry!" declared Lloyd. "Right out of
the galleys, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," confessed the novelist, "it's all in my blasted
book&mdash;only, of course, not in such tabloid form. I started
out, you see, to paint a cross-section of the period&mdash;of my
own little&mdash;I should say, microscopic&mdash;environment. Well,
naturally, the most obvious fact about our post-war society is that
it's in a transitional stage. We'd got rid long ago of our
brownstone Victorianism&mdash;America, you know, was twice as
Victorian as England ever thought of being&mdash;we'd got rid
rather of its false modesty and conventionality and timidity and
worn-out dogma. Then the war came and a lot of us were optimistic
enough to believe that a new nation would arise baptized in blood;
that that awful crucifixion of youth was going to save the world;
that the lesson of suffering and self-sacrifice would change a
materialistic age into one of spiritual beauty.</p>

<p>"It was a bad guess! Victorian materialism&mdash;like the
Victorian generation itself&mdash;still survives, twice as
materialistic as before&mdash;twice as crass, twice as
ostentatious&mdash;but for that reason, by George, I'll
admit&mdash;only half as dangerous. To that extent there's hope,
anyway! It was the old-fashioned respectable materialism that was
rotting away our roots, destroying our possibility of
salvation&mdash;the materialism of the heavy Sunday dinn er and the
Easter bonnet. To-day a bounder who has made a dozen millions
during the war out of an abandoned rubber plantation can join the
mob of greasy profiteers and force an admittance to what is known
as society, imposing upon it his own standards of morals and
manners; whereas in the old days he used to come crawling on his
knees with his hat in his hand. To-day he's in the majority. The
Victorians are being driven to the wall! Yes, my boy, the
materialist of the moment is right on top, but, by gad, we all know
the sort of materialist he is! And we all say, even while we drink
his bootlegged whiskey and jazz around to his nigger band, 'Poor
devil!' or 'Poor ass!'&mdash;when twenty years ago we were saying
that he was a clever fellow and not really as bad as he seemed.
Well, son, that's some comfort! We've got our eyes open.</p>

<p>"If we're on the way to perdition, we know it&mdash;and we don't
mistake it for the road to paradise. I tell you the war pulled the
cork out of the bottle of life and it's fizzing to beat all, but
pretty soon it will settle down&mdash;become 'still'!"</p>

<p>"Yes," retorted Lloyd&mdash;"and flat."</p>

<p>"If truth is flat, yes!" retorted Parradym. "At any rate, no
longer charged with the old false hopes, superstitions, and
hypocrisies. But we've got to have something instead of what has
escaped. It's not going to be enough for us to know that we were
wrong; we've got to know how to be right. We've got to have a
religion&mdash;something to take the place of what we've discarded.
We'll find it! It'll take time&mdash;and money&mdash;but we shall
find it&mdash;or our children's children will!"</p>

<p>Parradym took up an illustrated weekly.</p>

<p>"Sorry to have bored you with all this. I know it's old stuff to
you. I guess it is, anyway, and that my poor old novel will be 'way
behind the times. I see bobbed hair is going out and that skirts
are coming down. Well, glad to have caught a glimpse of you. Why
not dine here some night with me?"</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Maitland's tongue to suggest that they
should do so then. But at that instant he saw Nigel coming down the
stairs guiding himself by the hand-rail. The boy did not look well,
and there was an uncertainty in his movements not characteristic of
him.</p>

<p>"Hello, Nigel!" Lloyd called to him. "I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Upstairs in the front room," answered the other, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"What doing? Reading?"</p>

<p>Nigel reached the bottom step and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"No, no. Just sitting around."</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you," said Maitland. "Come into the front
room."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" queried Nigel. "Disclose the fact to
me that I have inherited an earldom?"</p>

<p>"Not much like that! Have a cigarette?"</p>

<p>They threw themselves upon a heavily stuffed lounge before the
fire. "Now for it!" thought Lloyd.</p>

<p>"I had a visit from Lady Harrowdale to-day," said he. Nigel
turned to him eagerly.</p>

<p>"Did you? She told you?"</p>

<p>Lloyd laid his hand on his friend's knee.</p>

<p>"Yes, old man. I congratulate you. She is a charming woman."</p>

<p>"Will it take long for her to get a divorce?"</p>

<p>"No time at all," answered Lloyd. "But she can never get a
divorce here which will be recognized in England. If she remarried
here, Harrowdale could divorce her there upon the us ual statutory
ground."</p>

<p>He could hear Nigel swallow once&mdash;twice&mdash;a dry click.
Then a high strained voice beside him said:</p>

<p>"Can't she get a divorce in England, then?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Maitland; "the English law requires both adultery
and also what it calls 'cruelty'; she cannot technically establish
that."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, during which he finished his cigarette
and lighted another. Nigel did not speak.</p>

<p>"But," added Lloyd at length, "she could get a divorce here that
would make your marriage legal in America. I suppose you'll always
live here. It would make little practical difference."</p>

<p>"You forget," said Nigel, "I'm an Englishman. If we marry,
she'll be an Englishwoman&mdash;!" He covered his face with his
hands. "There's luck for you!"</p>

<p>He arose weakly and walked to the window, a taut figure against
the twilight. The crack and hiss of the soft coal in the grate was
the only sound breaking the silence.</p>

<p>Again Maitland saw himself an ungallant figure, forcing an
artificial morality upon others at the cost of everything that made
life worth living for them. Diana's appeal to the heart rather than
to the conscience had conquered him. He now wanted Nigel to send
the whole tangle to the devil just as she had. He was satisfied
that the lad would be a fool to sacrifice Claudia for any
consideration whatever. And, of course, he wouldn't; no boy of that
age was going to let a technicality stand in his way!</p>

<p>Then Maitland saw Nigel's narrow shoulders square
themselves.</p>

<p>"I couldn't let any woman I loved put herself in that
position&mdash;for me! I couldn't! Let's go on over to the rooms!"
he said, sliding his arm along the back of the sofa until it
reached Lloyd's shoulder and circled it.</p>

<p>They went down to the coat-room together, Nigel holding Lloyd's
arm, got their hats and passed out into the street. It was quite
dark&mdash;a purple darkness ringed with pale gold about the
street-lamps, blue where the scattered windows beyond the trees
stencilled it with yellow squares. There was a dusty fragrance in
the air; a hardly perceptible whiff of gasolene, as if the trees
had been cleaned with it. The roar of the street-cars was muffled;
but the diapason of the city vibrated above, on every side, beneath
their feet.</p>

<p>"You know, Lloyd, somehow this always makes me think of
Bryanstone Square, although it isn't the least bit like it!" said
Nigel. "I suppose an Englishman sees England everywhere he
looks.</p>

<p>"There's another thing, too! I don't suppose you can appreciate
exactly what it means to be English," he went on apologetically
after a moment. "An Englishman has the same feeling about England
as a family of boys and girls have about their mother&mdash;a
terribly wise old woman to whom they owe
everything&mdash;everything. A chap may be an awful bounder, but if
anybody speaks a word against his mother&mdash;you know what I
mean! And down in his insides the only thing he really cares about
is her approval or disapproval.</p>

<p>"She may be all wrong&mdash;what she tells you to do may seem
perfect rot&mdash;but, although you may grouse a bit, you always do
it&mdash;you can't help yourself. You've got to be loyal to the
family, you know. Do you get the idea? The law may be
old-fashioned&mdash;just as your mother may be
old-fashioned&mdash;but, after all, she's your mother." He was
silent until they had almost reached the front steps of their
house. Then he said: "I couldn't let any woman do that&mdash;throw
herself away&mdash;for me. But even if I were that much of a
rotter, if I disregarded the law of my country, I should feel I
wasn't playing the game."</p>

<p>Their feet made a hard clumping on the uncarpeted wooden stairs.
Lloyd unlocked the door and turned on the lights. Capper's head had
been troubling him of late and the room had not been put in
order.</p>

<p>"I'm going out to dinner," said Lloyd. "What are you going to
do?"</p>

<p>Nigel had taken his customary stand in front of the fire with
his arms behind his back.</p>

<p>"Stay here and fight this out!"</p>

<p>Lloyd crossed to his room and began dressing. What Nigel had
said had unsettled his mind more than ever&mdash;put him back just
where he was before, nearly. But one thing was quite clear to him.
He perceived that the Craig morality was of a higher order than the
Pepperill morality, even if they both arrived at the same end. With
his knowledge of Nigel's quality he should have known beforehand
that the boy would never consent to put Claudia in the position of
being his mistress under English law. As he re-entered the
sitting-room, Nigel was still standing before the mantelpiece,
shading his eyes with his hand. He looked hardly twenty!</p>

<p>"Good luck to you!" he said. "Good night!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be back before eleven," answered Lloyd, putting on his
hat.</p>

<p>"Well, good night, anyhow!" repeated Nigel, dropping his hand
without looking at him.</p>

<p>The door closed, leaving Nigel alone. For a moment he stood
listening intently as the footsteps on the stairs grew fainter,
followed by the bang of the front door. An expression of
bewilderment and of dread settled upon his face as he passed his
hand slowly from left to right through the air. Then, as if
dissatisfied with the result, he reached out and touched the
centre-table.</p>

<p>Below, the door banged again and somebody came running up the
stairs and turned the knob. Instantly Nigel straightened himself
and assumed his customary smile.</p>

<p>"Back again so soon, Lloyd? Forgotten something?"</p>

<p>He looked straight at the doorway, and at that moment his gray
eyes had all the beauty of his mother's. For perhaps a quarter of a
minute there was silence. Then the man who had entered said in a
puzzled tone:</p>

<p>"But it isn't Colonel Maitland, sir. It's me&mdash;Capper!"</p>

<p>Craig turned and rested his hands upon the edge of the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"It's got me!" he said quietly. "Well, Capper, I'm done for!
They said it was an even break, but luck went against me. No doubt
in time I'll manage to muddle along well enough.&mdash;Light me a
cigarette, will you, Capper?&mdash;Yes, I've got
it!&mdash;Thanks!&mdash;I want you to pack my kit-bag and get me
out of here to-night. No use being a millstone on your friends, eh?
We'll find a place where they won't look for me&mdash;until I can
make a plan&mdash;"</p>

<p>He felt for the armchair and lowered himself slowly into it.</p>

<p>"As long as I can smoke!&mdash;I thought they said the blind
didn't enjoy it!&mdash;Yes, the old kit's back of the
bed&mdash;where I chucked it when I came off the schooner.&mdash;I
haven't got much stuff to take. Leave everything I don't need. I'll
send for it&mdash;maybe. Better telephone for a taxi now, Capper;
they take so long coming&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give me that package of fags, will you, before you go into the
other room?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter 21. The Storm</h2>

<p>"Mr. Kayne," said old Brackmar, the chief loan clerk, one
morning in late April, coming into the president's office with a
newspaper in his hand, "I suppose, sir, you've seen this?"</p>

<p>"What is it?" carelessly asked Rufus.</p>

<p>"The Alpha-Omega Pictures Company have gone into voluntary
bankruptcy. We have a million of their notes, you remember. In
fact, I believe, sir, you personally guaranteed the loan."</p>

<p>Rufus experienced a queer, buzzing sensation in the pit of his
stomach.</p>

<p>"That's bad!" he answered, catching his breath. The news
resurrected the corpse of the whole unfortunate episode. Mercedes's
ghost floated before him. Somehow the integrity of the loan did not
appear quite the same now as then. He should have taken Pepperill's
advice.</p>

<p>"They put their liabilities at nine million and their assets at
two hundred and fifty thousand," added Brackmar in a distressed
tone. "We're at the top of the list."</p>

<p>"The deuce we are!"</p>

<p>"The indorsements may be good, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good!" snapped Kayne. "Of course they're good! Stein and Savoy
are worth several millions between them."</p>

<p>"But they're creditors themselves."</p>

<p>"For how much?"</p>

<p>"A million and a half!"</p>

<p>The root of Kayne's tongue seemed to fill his throat. Suppose
for any reason Stein and Savoy could not pay? They were in all
sorts of things&mdash;crazy enterprises of every kind that people
ordinarily would not know about&mdash;judgment-proof, doubtless! A
milli on cash! If they defaulted he would at present prices be
practically ruined! Perspiration beaded his brow with a fillet of
tiny seed-pearls. He must have been crazy to go on those
notes&mdash;particularly when he had had no need to do so. But he
had been crazy&mdash;there was no other word for the whole
miserable business. He had seen his lost youth beckoning to him and
had rushed hysterically, blindly, after her.</p>

<p>"God!" he muttered, staring around the room after Brackmar had
gone out. "This is bad!"</p>

<p>The papers would say things.</p>

<p><br><br>Fourteen of the eighteen directors of the Utopia Trust Company
had lunch together in an upper chamber of the Down Town Association
the following Friday noon at the invitation of Mr. Phillips, the
chairman of the board. It had been felt that it would be wiser to
discuss the Alpha-Omega's failure and the Utopia's connection with
it in the first instance informally rather than in the
quasi-publicity of a directors' meeting. It would give them time to
exchange views, look around, and insure against precipitate
action.</p>

<p>They were a keen-looking, middle-aged lot, with a few old
veterans and one or two tanned faces&mdash;like
Devereaux's&mdash;that suggested more attention to sport than to
finance. They talked together in low tones without mentioning the
purpose of their gathering until the servants had passed around the
coffee and cigars and closed the door behind them. Then Mr.
Phillips, whose massive, clean-cut face suggested Gladstone's,
glanced round the table and said without more ado:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I suppose you all know why we're here?"</p>

<p>There was no sound of dissent. They had lighted their cigars and
settled back, turning their faces expectantly toward his end of the
table.</p>

<p>"I don't need to tell you that this Alpha-Omega failure puts us
in a most unpleasant position. Of course the loan is safe
enough&mdash;owing to Mr. Kayne's guaranty; but it will do us no
good to appear as the chief creditor of a bankrupt fly-by-night
moving-picture concern. There has been a lot of talk&mdash;and I
may say just criticism&mdash;directed lately against the kind of
enterprises trust companies are financing. Stockholders are getting
uneasy. You all know about the strike suits brought against the
Cottonseed National? Confidentially, I understand they had to be
settled&mdash;for a lot of money. This will hurt our credit. The
question is, does the situation call for any unusual action, and,
if so, what?"</p>

<p>Silence followed his remarks. No one seemed anxious to take the
responsibility of suggesting what was in everybody's mind. Then
Thornton Graham, the head of the old, established banking-house of
Graham &amp; Co., leaned forward and said:</p>

<p>"Do I understand that the loan was approved by our committee in
the usual way?"</p>

<p>"It was not," replied Mr. Phillips. "And I may add that it was
made against the express advice and strong opposition of our
counsel, Mr. Pepperill."</p>

<p>A murmur ran in and out among the coffee-cups.</p>

<p>"Who are the indorsers?" asked Mr. Graham. "Are they able to
meet their obligations as they fall due?"</p>

<p>"I have a confidential report on each of them from our
information department," answered the chairman. "I need not bother
you with it. They are both theatrical people tied up in a variety
of schemes and with no particular financial rating. They are
reputed to be well off." He smiled faintly. "But very likely that
merely means that their wives are well off."</p>

<p>The banker frowned.</p>

<p>"I should say that the chances of their taking up these notes
were more than problematical. Further, it seems to me that our
president had shown an extraordinary lack of caution&mdash;to say
the least&mdash;in making such a loan. I am very much
surprised!"</p>

<p>Devereaux moved uneasily. That Diana's father should have been
guilty of such an indiscretion-!</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips turned to an oldish man beside him&mdash;an
ex-chairman.</p>

<p>"Mr. Putnam, have you anything to say? Is there any explanation
for this&mdash;er&mdash;extraordinary proceeding of Mr.
Kayne's?"</p>

<p>He paused, clearly reluctant to say more.</p>

<p>"Inferentially&mdash;but only inferentially," Mr. Putnam
admitted at length. "It appears from the newspaper reports of the
failure that the capital stock of the Alpha-Omega is controlled by
another corporation known as the 'Celebrated Celluloid.' Mr. Kayne
holds five thousand shares of the latter company's stock. He may of
course be able to explain fully his reasons for the loan, and of
course no one has as yet broached the subject."</p>

<p>"Whew!" suddenly whistled the youngest member of the board, who
had been gazing out of the window at some pigeons fluttering over
the neighboring roof. "Looks to me as though Kayne had been lending
money to <i>himself!</i>"</p>

<p>A hush of stupefaction descended upon the group. Then suddenly
all began to talk at once, gesticulating, pounding the table,
arising in couples to argue in corners. What could have struck
Kayne? He must have some explanation for a thing like that! It was
plain crooked.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! Gentlemen!" called Mr. Phillips, rapping with his
coffee-spoon against his saucer. "Kindly come to order. What shall
we do?"</p>

<p>"Fire Mm!" answered Lamar, the sportsman, crisply.</p>

<p>Devereaux had been sitting with Ms chin in Ms hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Phillips!" he interjected, "I am a very inconspicuous
member of this board and I hesitate to make any suggestions to men
so much more experienced than I am, but I feel we should not decide
so important a matter hastily. If Mr. Kayne has, as Mr. Lamar
assumes, been lending money to himself or to a corporation in which
he has a financial interest&mdash;and he has no justification or
adequate explanation&mdash;I agree that he should be asked to
resign. But he should be given an opportunity to make a defense.
Why not call a special meeting of the board, and notify him of the
charges against Mm."</p>

<p>"I don't see why we need notify him of anything," retorted
Lamar. "Why give him a chance to&mdash;to"&mdash;he hesitated a
shade confusedly&mdash;"to cook up anything? Let's have a special
meeting to-morrow noon and simply ask what he's got to say."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, you have heard what Mr. Devereaux and Mr. Lamar have
suggested," remarked Mr. Phillips, "what is your will? Suppose all
who are in favor of calling a special meeting as Mr. Lamar proposes
raise their right hands."</p>

<p>His eyes swept the circle.</p>

<p>"It is a vote," he announced. "To-morrow, then."</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter 22. Playing the Game</h2>

<p>Claudia, Lady Harrowdale, was sitting in her room trying to
read. She had heard nothing from Nigel for five days, although
flowers had come from him regularly. Usually he called at least
twice, and often three times, each week.</p>

<p>She had thought of little during those five days except the
problem which Maitland's explanation of the law had raised, and she
had reached the conclusion that Diana was right and that he was
wrong. As soon as she could discuss the matter properly with Nigel
she intended, if he approved, to have Messrs. Crutchfield &amp;
Pepperill institute proceedings in Maine for a divorce based on
Harrowdale's desertion. She could get her decree in a little over a
year, and then Nigel and she could marry.</p>

<p>How curious it seemed to be sitting dreaming of love and
marriage for the second time in the same chair where one had first
dreamed of love and marriage with another! She got up and looked
into the mirror over her mantel. In that light, at any rate, she
could see little change in her appearance. Really, not any. Even
now she was only twenty-one! Twenty-one! Only just entitled in law
to be regarded as an adult. Life all before her! Perhaps in time
she would forget the nightmare of her English experience! Nigel was
such a dear! She would drop him a line and stir him up! From a
silver frame on her table his face with its dark eyes&mdash;eyes
much like her own&mdash;looked out at her. Her desk was in the bay
window, and on her way to it she stopped and struck a few chords
upon the piano.</p>

<p class="poem">"Drink to me only with thine eyes<br>
And I will pledge with mine!<br>
Leave but a kiss&mdash;"</p>

<p>A knock interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Come in!" she called over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Jarmon entered bearing a registered letter on a tray.</p>

<p>"Hi took the liberty of signin' for it, me lady," said he in a
confidential manner.</p>

<p>He was in fact consumed with curiosity, since while the return
card had borne the name of Nigel Craig as the sender, the address
had not been in his handwriting.</p>

<p>"That is quite all right," she answered, picking up the heavy
envelope.</p>

<p>Jarmon lingered, adjusting a table-cover to watch her. Why was
Craig writing instead of coming to see her? And why was the address
not in his hand?</p>

<p>"That is all, Jarmon," said Lady Harrowdale, waiting until he
should go to open the letter and filled with a strange disquietude.
Why should Nigel be writing to her!</p>

<p class="letter">To The Lady Harrowdale<br>
In Care of Rufus Kayne, Esqr.,<br>
Fifth Avenue,<br>
New York, N. Y.</p>

<p>Whose hand had printed that scrambling humpbacked address? Why
not his? Foreboding prevented her for the moment from opening the
envelope. Then his face in the photograph reassured her and with a
paper-cutter she slit the wrapper. The blood fled from her heart.
The entire letter was in the handwriting of some one totally
uneducated.</p>

<p>At the top of the first sheet were the words:</p>

<p class="letter">Written by James Capper for Conolel Nigel Craig
at his Request.</p>

<p>The letter itself read:</p>

<p class="letter">dearest Claudia our Problem has been Decided for
us we shall not hav to Worry about what we ought to do I hav lost
my Site I hav known that this might happen ever since we came back
from England but the Doctors told me that unless my eyes got so
bad I could not see at all there was still hope for me but last
Thursday it happened my Site has gone entirely if the doctors are
rite and time only can tell definitely our Dream of happiness is
ended for I cannot saddle you with a Blind Man at first I thought I
could not bear to go on living but although the War taught me that
life was cheap it is not cheap enough for that britons must never
be Slaves must they I shall go away drop out of site without any
fuss it is the best way do not try to find me God bless you always
my darling<br>
<br>
Nigel.</p>

<p>She sat staring at it. She wanted to scream, to shriek at the
top of her voice: "No! No! No! It can't be! It can't be!" She could
hear herself screaming, but no sound came from her lips. She stared
and stared at the letter while the little clock at her elbow ticked
and ticked: "Gone! Gone! Everything gone!&mdash;Gone! Gone!
Everything gone!" It was as if a great iron heel had come crashing
down out of the sky and crushed Nigel and herself to earth.
Everything gone! The hours passed. She grew stiff and cold, but
still she sat staring at the letter, anesthetized by the shock of
her grief.</p>

<p>The sounds on the avenue below diminished in volume and finally
ceased altogether. The ticking of the clock filled the
room&mdash;each tick a knife-thrust through her heart of which she
was conscious, yet which she could not feel. Then some unaccustomed
noise roused her from coma and for an instant she tried to believe
that she had been dreaming. She raised her eyes to the table,
whence Nigel looked at her from the silver frame. No!&mdash;No! It
could not be true! The letter crackled in her hand, and this time a
tiny whimper came from her lips. With a cry Claudia threw herself
upon her knees before the photograph and crushed it wildly to her
with hysterical sobs. Now that her blood moved again&mdash;now that
she could once more feel&mdash;her agony seemed insupportable. Why
had God done this to her? Given her Nigel simply to rob her of him!
In that moment she reaped the full harvest of her parents' neglect.
She saw herself a defenseless child, cheated of every chance of
happiness, defrauded of home, marriage, f amil y, love. For in that
moment her children meant nothing to her. She had had no parents,
her sisters had been strangers to her, her existence with
Harrowdale one of unutterable wretchedness!</p>

<p>Then in the depth of her misery, the darkness of her despair,
Nigel had come and led her forth into the sunlight again. Once more
the sky, the sea, the earth, the flowers had resumed their normal
colors. Youth, hope, love, had beckoned to her, laughed with her,
showered her with blossoms. How wonderful life could be!&mdash;Ah!
How terrible life could be! Clasping the picture to her breast, she
sank to the floor rocking herself to and fro. The ticking of the
clock was now like the pounding of a sledge-hammer upon her
brain:</p>

<p>"Gone! Gone! Every thing gone!"</p>

<p>She glanced round her room&mdash;the hateful room in which her
childhood had been spent. Her childhood! She had never had any
childhood! She had never had anything&mdash;except Nigel, and now
Nigel was tom from her&mdash;forever! The walls seemed to
contract&mdash;to be about to crush her. She hated that house! And
everything about it! A prison&mdash;a tomb! She could not stay
there! Yet there was nowhere for her to go&mdash;no arms to which
she could flee. She felt that she must die&mdash;but that she could
not die in that house.</p>

<p>Still holding the picture, she struggled to her feet, threw a
wrap over her shoulders, and opened her bedroom door. The landing
outside was diml y lighted from below and she silently felt her way
down-stairs, past the mezzanine gallery leading to the organ, past
the bronze Mercury, until she reached the pink-and-white marble
squares of the entrance-hall. An odor of cigarette-smoke lingered
there. From among the palms about the organ a gleam of white
bespoke the presence of the Greek Slave.</p>

<p>She bungled the heavy chain on the front door, but at length it
fell, the key turned, and she pushed it open, standing alone at the
top of the brownstone steps. The avenue was a gleaming, leaden
river, reflecting endless pools of yellow light. If she could only
have thrown herself into it and forgotten her misery! Was she to
suffer thus forever? The thought was unbearable.</p>

<p>Did one have to suffer forever? A few blocks away the twin
towers of the Cathedral rose toward the stars. She had passed them
a thousand times in the past without a thought. But now they seemed
like two arms stretched upward in supplication&mdash;the arms of
the world beseeching the divine mercy. Her own church had meant no
more to her than to her father and mother. It had been merely a
structure of stone and mortar, like any other semi-official
edifice. But in these twin spires typifying man's aspiration for
the spiritual, she now for the first time saw an evidence of his
dependency upon a strength greater than his own. As she looked at
them something of awe, something of consolation, stole over her.
They were, she felt, like two fingers raised in pitying
benediction. "O God, our help in ages past!"</p>

<p>Hesitatingly&mdash;drawn by an intangible but positive spiritual
force&mdash;Claudia crossed the street. Slowly she climbed the long
flight of entrance steps, each moment her strange feeling of
dependency growing stronger and bringing with it a mysterious
comfort. The door of the Cathedral was open. Inside, a pale path
led through a dark forest of columns to where at a great distance,
high upon the altar, two candles burned on either side of the red
flickering gleam of the sanctuary lamp. All about her crowded the
mysterious shadows of the vast edifice, yet she had no thought of
being frightened. Instead, a sense of exaltation&mdash;of
love&mdash;of being merged in something greater than
herself&mdash;possessed her&mdash;she knew that God in some form
was there, had always been there, would always be there.
Forever!</p>

<p>As she crept toward the altar the light of the candles seemed to
grow brighter. Timidly she sank upon her knees at the rail, hugging
the photograph to her bosom. "God have mercy upon me!&mdash;Christ
have mercy upon me!" she murmured over and over. A short distance
away hung a crucifix, the features of the dying Saviour shining in
relief against the shadows. With her lips to the lips of the
photograph she raised her eyes to the crucifix and kept them there;
until at length it seemed to her that the eyes that looked down
with such tender compassion into her own were none other than the
eyes of Nigel.</p>

<p><br><br>On the outskirts of a Western city, where the trolleylines run
out and stop in the caked mud of the prairie, the dark mass of a
brick building rose against the yellowing east. It had been hastily
erected during the war as a munitions factory, and from its portal
thousands of wooden cases had been discharged upon the flatcars of
the switch line connecting it with the terminal four miles distant.
Farmers driving to town across the prairie, whether by day or by
night, could see the velvet smoke pouring in thick oily masses from
its towering chimneys, the flare of its furnaces, hear the dull
pound and clank of its never-pausing machines. Its owner and his
business associates had divided between them a neat net of five
million dollars. For a month or two the building had stood there
deserted and silent, looking eastward across the prairie with
sightless eyes. Grass had grown up between the ties of the switch
line. Small boys had amused themselves by throwing stones through
the windows. Tramps had crept in and sheltered themselves among the
piles of wastage on the lower floors.</p>

<p>Then one day two men had appeared in a smart limousine and
climbed over the building, measuring-tape and note-book in
hand.</p>

<p>"Well, what will it cost?" the elder had asked as they emerged
from the front door and paused to light cigarettes. The younger
made a rapid calculation.</p>

<p>"You can put it into pretty good shape for about eight thousand
dollars&mdash;at a rough estimate," he replied.</p>

<p>"How about furniture?"</p>

<p>The architect shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"That oughtn't to cost anything to speak of," he said. "I should
think you could do that by contract for two or three more."</p>

<p>A few weeks later carpenters, painters, and glaziers had taken
possession. New panes took the place of the broken ones in the
windows. The sound of the plane, the hammer and the saw resounded
through the empty rooms. Green and white shades appeared in the
windows. White paint supplanted black on the doors and trim. A
colored man with a rake and hoe wandered about digging up weeds and
making piles of the débris. The trolley, which during the war had
stopped a quarter of a mile away, extended itself by that much
farther toward the prairie. An open shed for waiting passengers was
built just outside the gate of the grounds. But paint could not
disguise it. It still remained what it had always been&mdash;a
factory, a repair-shop.</p>

<p>A wisp of gray smoke uncoiled itself from the central
chimney&mdash;the only moving thing in the otherwise motionless
dawn. From the direction of the city came a long-drawn bellow
summoning the workers of the world to their tasks. Here and there
along the front of the building shades went up. The distant edge of
the prairie smouldered and burst into flame. The smoke from the
chimney thickened. Another day was coming.</p>

<p>The assistant superintendent stood at the window of his office
waiting for his breakfast and holding a telegram in his hand. The
thin partitions overhead and about him echoed to all sorts of
multitudinous noises. A young man on crutches swung himself into
the doorway.</p>

<p>"Breakfast, sir."</p>

<p>"Tell Timmins that new man ought to be here by nine o'clock. He
wired that he was taking the night train from Kansas City," said
the assistant superintendent.</p>

<p>As he spoke his eye caught a taxi floundering through the ruts
at the trolley crossing.</p>

<p>"I guess that's him now!" he said.</p>

<p>The taxi, having crossed the tracks, turned in at the gate and
stopped at the foot of the steps, but no one got out. The Irishman
who was driving pulled the brake tight, shut off his gas, and
slowly climbed down. Then, having opened the door of the taxi, he
removed from inside a heavy kit-bag, which he carried to the
vestibule above. Returning, he thrust his head inside the vehicle,
and with extraordinary gentleness assisted his passenger to get
out. The latter stood there patiently. He was obviously young and
far better dressed than most of those whose business brought them
there, including the superintendent himself.</p>

<p>"Which way?" asked Nigel.</p>

<p>The cabby put his arm about the slight figure.</p>

<p>"This way, sorr! That's good! Two steps more, sorr! There ye
are!"</p>

<p>At the top they paused. Nigel handed the man his pocketbook.</p>

<p>"Take your fare and a half-dollar extra for your trouble," said
he.</p>

<p>The Irishman fumbled in the purse, carefully counted out the
right amount, and added the tip as directed. Having done so, he
looked inside the purse, hesitated, glanced at Nigel, and slipped
back the half-dollar. Then he returned the purse to its owner.</p>

<p>"Thank ye, sorr!" said he. "I hope ye'll have good luck."</p>

<p>Once more he took Nigel's arm and together they crossed the
threshold into the Burton Vocational School for Disabled
Soldiers.</p>

<p>Presently he came out, cranked up his car, and took his seat
again. With a roar the taxi lurched forward. Across the tracks
drifted a cloud of yellow dust, tinged almost to gold by the sun
just peeping above the horizon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter 23. The Sentence</h2>

<p>To Rufus Kayne, ignorant of the real crux of the Alpha-Omega
situation, the saving grace, so far as it affected himself, seemed
to be that none of the notes were as yet due. One for a hundred
thousand dollars would mature upon May 1. If by any chance Stein
and Savoy did not take it up, he could, he told himself, easily
arrange to raise a hundred thousand, and, in a like event, still
another hundred three months later. By that time doubtless he could
force the indorsers, if backward, to toe the mark. There was no
question in his mind as to their finan ci al responsibility,
although he knew that such people were always slow about meeting
their obligations and usually tried to avoid them in every way
possible.</p>

<p>Going all over it, he was satisfied that even if he were obliged
ultimately to take up the notes himself, he could manage it. It
would cripple him somewhat, but he could manage it&mdash;the whole
million, if need be, in two years and a half. There was no reason,
however, to borrow trouble&mdash;Stein and Savoy would come across.
There were still six days before the first note would be due and
there was no way to anticipate it. Until the day came, the trust
company could not fall back upon the indorsers, whose liability
would not arise until an actual default in payment upon that
date.</p>

<p>Meantime, however, he would do a little investigating, and
incidentally put his own house in order. He had quite a block of
railroad stock, and in addition the five thousand shares of
"Celebrated Celluloid," the proceeds of which would be almost
enough to meet the first note. But he had not liked the old loan
clerk's attitude; it worried him. And the <i>Post</i> had an editorial on
the dangers of modern banking methods, mentioning no names, but
only too obviously aimed at the Utopia.</p>

<p>He tried to take an optimistic view of the whole matter, but
that night he had difficulty in getting any sleep. Daybreak found
him wide awake staring at the ceiling. At that depressing hour he
was filled with all sorts of apprehensions. He even wondered if
Mercedes might not be planning to hold him up for some money. She
had a lot of his handwriting. If she wanted to be nasty&mdash;!</p>

<p>The sun rose and the clouds of anxiety began to dissolve.
Breakfast revived him considerably. But the <i>Times</i> and the <i>World</i>
both commented editorially upon the invidious practice on the part
of trust companies of engaging in speculative businesses under the
guise of making loans. The next regular board meeting would be on
April 30, and he realized that very likely some one would bring the
matter up. He must be prepared with a plausible explanation.
Meanwhile he would liquidate enough securities to pay off the note
if Stein and Savoy should welch.</p>

<p>He glanced through his mail with some nervousness, fearful lest
it might contain a letter from Mercedes. Then, reassured, and
having lit a cigar, he called for a quotation on "Celebrated
Celluloid." He had paid 14 5/8 for his five thousand shares, and it
had fluctuated around that figure ever since, but the slip came
back "Offered at 3; no bid." He stared at it dumbfounded. Then he
smiled feebly. The "three" must be an error for "thirteen."</p>

<p>He told the clerk to verify the quotation and turned to the
<i>Wall Street Journal</i> to look up the last sale. "Celebrated
Celuloid" had been active for several days around 2 1/2! The last
sale had been of 16,000 shares at 2 3/8. The knowledge roused all
his fears. He had lost nearly seventy-five thousand dollars. Bad
enough! Particularly as that was the money he had intended to use
to meet the Alpha-Omega note&mdash;if he had to meet it. Was the
bottom dropping out of the whole moving-picture business?</p>

<p>He recalled with some dismay that Stein and Savoy had both said
they were heavy holders of "C. C." The two promoters might go under
with it! Well, he would not sell his stock at any such figure as
that! It was disconcerting, for he would now be obliged to take a
fifty-point loss if he sold his Great Northern and Northern
Pacific. It was small consolation that he could offset it against
profits on his income-tax return.</p>

<p>His cigar soured and he screwed it savagely into the tray of
Pompeian bronze on the desk beside him. Anyhow, he had plenty of
time. He would consult Pepperill&mdash;no, he could not bear the
thought of the old man's sardonic smile, his dry "I-told-you-so"
chuckle! He'd ask Maitland to step over. In his agitation he had
overlooked the notice lying on his desk.</p>

<p>A few minutes before noon, returning from the trust department,
where he had gone to verify an inventory of securities, he noticed
that the door of the board room was open and that several of the
directors, including Senator Krass, were standing in the outer
office. Inquiring the reason, he was informed by a clerk that a
special directors' meeting had been called for twelve o'clock. They
had been too quick for him! He had had no time to work out an
adequate explanation with regard to his part in making the loan.
Somebody must have smelled a rat. And they had not given him
notice&mdash;that was suspicious, even irregular! This struck him
as most ominous. He decided not to attend the meeting, but went
back to his office and lit another dgar. They should not catch him
napping!</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later old Brackmar appeared and informed him
that the directors wished to examine the papers lying upon the desk
beside him relating to the loan to the Alpha-Omega. The
significance of the request was heightened by the loan clerk's
obvious nervousness. Yes! They were looking the matter up. It was
bad! Without reply, Rufus pushed the envelope toward the old man.
He had wanted to ask him what the devil it was all about, but the
words would not come.</p>

<p>After the clerk had gone out with the papers he was relieved
that he had not shown any such anxiety. He must put on a bold
front. He was going to see the loan paid&mdash;and that was all
there was to it. A million dollars&mdash;penalty enough! But why
had they called a special meeting?</p>

<p>His throat went dry and he got up heavily and poured out a glass
of the Poland water that always stood on a side-table, spilling
some of it down the front of his waistcoat. He wiped it off and
leaned against the table. An odd sound came from his parched lips.
If only there was somebody he could talk to&mdash;somebody who
would understand! He almost wished that Elizabeth were there; she,
at least, would be sympathetic, if unintelligently so.
Never&mdash;not even that horrible morning in the Annex at Atlantic
City&mdash;had he felt so utterly alone&mdash;an unloved atom in a
hostile, malevolent universe. Alone&mdash;! He was roused by old
Brackmar's queer, rusty voice:</p>

<p>"Mr. Phillips wished me to ask if it would be convenient for you
to step into the board room for a moment, sir."</p>

<p>Rufus nodded. The muscles in his neck were vibrating. The
objects about him refused to focus. He reached for the Poland
bottle and drank another glass of water&mdash;and then part of a
third, again spilling it. This would not do. He must pull himself
together.</p>

<p>He went into the tiled lavatory adjoining his office and looked
in the glass. The face he saw reflected there was
yellow&mdash;drawn&mdash;aged. He adjusted his necktie carefully
and brushed his hair. Well, now for it!</p>

<p>As he opened the door of the board room he wondered why he had
been so flustered, for there was a half-rising movement and a
general murmur of greeting as Mr. Phillips arose and ushered him to
a vacant chair at the head of the table next to Senator Krass.</p>

<p>"Good morning, gentlemen," said Rufus, with a smile. "What can I
do for you?"</p>

<p>Then he saw Mr. Pepperill sitting in a corner and something
turned over inside his abdomen. Mr. Phillips, who had returned to
his own seat at the other end of the room, took up a sheaf of
papers.</p>

<p>"Mr. President," he said, and his tone and manner were very
gentle, for he was a kindly man and had real sympathy for Kayne,
"the board has been in conference regarding the million-dollar loan
to the Alpha-Omega Company which has just gone into the hands of a
receiver. This loan seems to have been made upon security so
doubtful, as well as for the purpose of financing a venture so out
of the usual course of this company's business, that the directors
feel that they should ask for a full statement of the circumstances
surrounding it. In the interest of time, however, I might add that
Mr. Pepperill states that he advised you against making this loan,
both on grounds of business and general policy. Is that
correct?"</p>

<p>Rufus inclined his head.</p>

<p>"My recollection is that it did not meet with his approval," he
replied calmly. "Mr. Pepperill's opinion was not asked, and it was
not followed. He was consulted only with regard to the sufficiency
of the papers. The loan was made upon realty free and clear of
mortgage, valued at over six million dollars. The business showed
large profits. Our company had an enormous surplus and a limited
field of investment. The notes were indorsed by two gentlemen of
the highest financial responsibility.</p>

<p>"But even if there had been any virtue in Mr. Pepperill's
original objections, the fact that I personally guaranteed the loan
did away with them entirely and made it absolutely safe. Looking
back over the transaction, I see nothing to regret. The business
has not lived up to expectations. That is the fortune of war. But
the notes are good and will be met as they fall due. That is the
salient fact."</p>

<p>He spoke deliberately, confidently. After all, he knew these men
and they knew him.</p>

<p>"May I inquire," remarked Senator Krass sententiously, turning a
cold gray eye upon him, "why, if, as you say, you regarded this
proposed loan of a million dollars as safe and desirable, you
should have added your own indorsement to those already on the
notes?"</p>

<p>Kayne smiled again&mdash;this time familiarly. Krass was an old
friend.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you ask, senator," he answered easily. "My only
reason was that Mr. Pepperill had expressed dissatisfaction with
the security. I believe that he referred to the studios as 'a lot
of hothouses.' Isn't that what you called them, Mr. Pepperill?"</p>

<p>"It was," replied the old lawyer grimly.</p>

<p>"Besides which," went on Rufus more hurriedly, "he had
animadverted upon the indorsers, whom, however, he did not know. I
did know them, on the other hand, and I had implicit confidence in
them. But I felt that if the loan&mdash;to which I was already
morally committed&mdash;was to be made the subject of criticism, I
would, in order to show my own good faith in the matter, guarantee
it myself. I could hardly have done more!"</p>

<p>Rufus paused, believing that he had made a telling point.
Several of the others were smoking and he felt in his pocket for
the cigar that was always there, opened his penknife, deliberately
cut off the end, and lighted it. He congratulated himself on having
run in the words "good faith" so unostentatiously and made them do
double duty.</p>

<p>Then young Lamar&mdash;Lamar, who had dined repeatedly at the
Kaynes' at Northampton and to whom Rufus had lost hundreds of
dollars at golf and poker&mdash;playing with the inkstand in front
of him, asked almost insolently:</p>

<p>"Pardon the question, but did you have a personal interest in
this loan?"</p>

<p>The color flared into Rufus's face and he thrust out his jaw, as
he looked expectantly around the table for the others to share his
resentment.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" he shot back angrily.</p>

<p>Senator Krass stroked his pale, purple chin.</p>

<p>"Are we explicitly to understand," he inquired, "that you had no
personal interest whatever to advance in the making of this
loan&mdash;either directly or indirectly? That you held none of the
stock, bonds, or other obligations of this corporation? Or of
others associated with it?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely! How can you ask such a question, senator?"</p>

<p>There was a ring of honest indignation in Kayne's voice. If they
thought anything like that, they were jolly well barking up the
wrong tree! But how could either Krass or Lamar imagine any such
thing! The sportsman muttered at the paper-cutter, to which he
seemed suddenly to have taken a violent prejudice.</p>

<p>"Do you own stock in any moving-picture concern?" pursued
Senator Krass.</p>

<p>They had got to the fact, Rufus perceived, that he owned some
"Celebrated Celluloid "! Well, there was nothing in that.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I do," he replied, simulating a faint touch of
amusement. "I own several thousand shares in a moving-picture
company, which cost me nearly seventy-five thousand dollars, but
which to-day I could hardly get rid of as a present."</p>

<p>He grinned slightly at Mr. Phillips, as if to suggest that
everybody made mistakes on occasion and that there were accidents
in the best-regulated families.</p>

<p>"And you still say that you had no interest in making this
loan?" demanded Lamar with obvious disgust.</p>

<p>The brutality of his manner did not seem to create a
particularly unfavorable impression upon any one except Rufus.</p>

<p>"What do you expect me to infer from your question, sir?" he
demanded haughtily.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;! What's the use!" roared Lamar. "Have you got the
face to tell us that you didn't know your 'Celebrated Celluloid'
company owned the 'Alpha-Omega'?"</p>

<p>"I do! Yes!" answered Rufus in a thick voice. Thump-thump-thump!
Involuntarily he put his hand to his heart.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" he cried. "You can't believe that I&mdash;!
It's&mdash;it's&mdash;preposterous!"</p>

<p>"But it's the fact, isn't it?" retorted Lamar.</p>

<p>"Not to my knowledge!" said Rufus. "I bought that stock only a
few weeks ago on what I regarded as inside information&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From whom?" inquired Lamar, interrupting. "Let's get at the
bottom of this!"</p>

<p>Rufus choked. There must be a way out of this utterly false
position. And yet every minute he was getting in deeper and
deeper.</p>

<p>"From Mr. Savoy," he answered faintly.</p>

<p>"One of the indorsers on the 'Alpha-Omega' notes?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;" stammered Rufus, red to his hair. "But it never
occurred to me that there was any connection between the two
companies. My word ought to suffice for that. You ought to know me
well enough-!"</p>

<p>He stared at them desperately, but they refused to meet his
glance. Krass even wandered over and took a seat beside Mr.
Pepperill. The plane of the table seemed to shift and to float for
a moment in mid-air. They must believe him! How could they help
doing so! Mr. Phillips was speaking:</p>

<p>"Of course you recognize that if at the time you made this loan
you owned or contemplated purchasing an interest in a corporation
holding stock in the borrowing company, your action would be
subject to severe criticism&mdash;irrespective of whether you did
or did not personally guaranty the payment of the money?"</p>

<p>"Naturally," murmured Kayne.</p>

<p>"Then," continued the chairman, and his tone was not devoid of
pity, "as all the other facts seem to be conceded, the only
question at issue is whether at the time you had, or expected to
acquire, an interest in this holding company."</p>

<p>The tears rose to Rufus's eyes and his body shook. He bowed his
face on the table in his hands. So they thought him a crook! After
all these years!</p>

<p>"My God!" he groaned. "I suppose you've only my word for it, but
isn't that enough? Do you suppose I'd jeopardize my name, my
position, the honor of my family for a few extra dividends? I've no
need of money. I made that loan honestly. And I guaranteed it
voluntarily in order that no one could question my sincerity.
Later, I bought the other stock simply because I heard it talked
about. I see now how the whole thing is susceptible of
misconstruction. I admit that it has a bad look&mdash;if you
disbelieve what I say!"</p>

<p>His chin quivered.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" he begged, stretching out his arms. "You must take
my word for this! My services to this company entitle me to your
consideration. My record is clean. My reputation is of the best. I
have an old father over eighty years of age; I have a wife, three
grown children, and two grandchildren. Do you believe that at
fifty-five years of age I would do a thing&mdash;a cheap
thing&mdash;like this?"</p>

<p>His welled tears blotted the faces about him&mdash;once so
kindly, now so merciless&mdash;as he realized that this of which he
was now under suspicion was no more cheap and contemptible than his
conduct with Mercedes had been. He was a rotter! Then, to his
surprise, he felt a hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kayne," he heard Phillips saying, "I think I can assure you
on behalf of myself and my associates that we do not any longer
suspect you of having any ulterior motive in making this loan. This
has been very painful for all of us. Perhaps it would be as well if
you should retire and give us an opportunity for discussion."</p>

<p>"Thank you, gentlemen!" said Rufus humbly, as with bent head he
left the room.</p>

<p>The men around the table looked silently at one another for
several seconds. Then Senator Krass remarked:</p>

<p>"You did quite right, Mr. Phillips. We're all sorry for the man.
There's no use rubbing it in."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe what he says?" challenged Devereaux
indignantly.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I don't have to decide that question," answered the
senator in a pointed manner.</p>

<p>Thornton Graham signed that he desired to be heard.</p>

<p>"Of course Mr. Kayne should be required to refund at once the
entire sum advanced on the loan. But should he be asked to resign?
That is the point. I do not think he intended to commit any
irregularity, but under the circumstances is he a fit man to
continue as president of the company?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Lamar shortly. "He's not! There's too much of this
sort of thing going on. Officers of trust companies should be held
to their responsibilities. Stockholders have rights, and we
represent them."</p>

<p>"This incident will seriously affect the company's credit and
its business," continued Mr. Graham. "We're all sorry for Mr.
Kayne. He has made a good president&mdash;an exceptionally good
president&mdash;up to this time, but so far as we are concerned his
usefulness is over. I subscribe heartily to Mr. Lamar's remarks
about our duty to our stockholders. We have no right to retain such
a man as president of our company after he has demonstrated his
inability to conduct our business with proper regard for their
interests."</p>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter 24. His Back to the
Wall</h2>

<p>Carlyle said that for one man who can stand prosperity there are
a hundred who will stand adversity. Rufus Kayne took his blow like
a man. It had fallen swiftly. Twenty minutes after leaving the
directors' meeting he had been officially informed that he must,
within thirty days, reimburse the trust company for the full amount
of the loan to the Alpha-Omega and immediately place his
resignation in the hands of the board, to take effect at the end of
the same period.</p>

<p>He neither questioned the justice of this decision nor
entertained the thought of denying his responsibility, partly
because he realized that the evidence against him was sufficient to
convince the court of public opinion, and partly, as well, because
of a curious desire to make a clean sweep of everything&mdash;pay
the price&mdash;and start all over again. There would be enough
money left to keep them going, he had no fear of the wolf of famine
howling at the kitchen door, but the raising of a mill ion
dollars&mdash;unless Stein and Savoy could be forced to make
good&mdash;would mean an entire readjustment of his affairs, the
liquidation of all his negotiable securities, and the sale of his
houses, both in New York and Northampton.</p>

<p>As each day passed he had less and less confidence that Stein
and Savoy would pay. In the pride of his financial power he had
handed them a million nonchalantly, carelessly&mdash;almost as a
gesture; but he now discovered that he could not borrow a like
amount himself. His original fortune had shrunk, owing to the war,
to less than two million dollars, and the bulk of it was invested
in such forms that it could not be withdrawn. He was, in addition,
carrying several heavy loans. Only by disposing of his realty could
he meet his obligation; and the sale of the Fifth Avenue house
would necessitate the disclosure to his father of what had
happened.</p>

<p>The thought of this dismayed him. If only some way could be
devised whereby the house could be saved from the wreck. He
revolved this ceaselessly. If Stein and Savoy could be made to pay
up promptly as each note fell due, he might be able to work it out.
He would know soon enough. He had already deposited a hundred
thousand dollars, the proceeds of his railroad
stock&mdash;representing a net loss of over fifty thousand&mdash;to
cover their default in case it should occur. No word of what had
taken place at the directors' meeting had leaked out, and he still
came and went as usual, transacting the company's business as its
president.</p>

<p>Rufus had, in fact&mdash;after all his years of easy
success&mdash;taken hold of the desperate situation in which he now
found himself with a certain sense of exhilaration. It would be
fanciful to say that he derived any enjoyment from his grim
determination to make the best of a bad business, but the necessity
of a struggle, even only of one to save his material fortunes,
stimulated and invigorated him. If it were not for his father!
After all, he was not too old to begin life over again and make a
success! Success! Poor Rufus!</p>

<p>On the afternoon of April 30 he received a call from Mr. Mark
Krabfleisch, who, it appeared, had in some mysterious way secured
his own appointment as attorney for the receiver of the bankrupt
Alpha-Omega Company. There was about him an excess of
cordiality&mdash;an unctuousness&mdash;that filled Rufus with
distaste from the moment of his entrance.</p>

<p>The attorney took from his pocket two very large cigars and
offered one to the banker even before the latter had invited him to
be seated, and it was obvious that he wished his visit to be a
friendly one. Afterward Rufus recalled the fact that the lawyer had
closed the door to the outer office, complaining of a slight cold
in his head. At the time, however, the incident had made no
impression upon him.</p>

<p>Mr. Krabfleisch, whose flabby cheeks lost themselves in a
turn-over collar, leaving his small chin protruding like a
misplaced Adam's apple, proved to be of an astonishing volubility.
Fixing Rufus with a beady black eye, he poured forth a breathless
torrent of soft sound not susceptible of interruption; and which
instantly surrounded, overran, and submerged any comment or
question from the listener. Having exhausted his breath, he inhaled
and instantly began again, as if fearful lest a moment of silence
should be fatal.</p>

<p>Rufus could not make out what it was all about. Indeed, Mr.
Krabfleisch managed in the short space of half an hour to cover
most topics of interest, if not concerned with the heavens above,
at least connected with things earthly or subterranean. And all
this, so far as Rufus could observe, in complete repose save for a
slight oscillation of the lower lip and the sudden shifting of his
little eyes.</p>

<p>He began by expressing much regret over the unexpected failure
of the Alpha-Omega Company and its consequent inability to meet its
notes&mdash;at least for the present. It was quite possible that in
time they could get on their feet again. The moving-picture
business, he explained, like all enterprises in any way dependent
upon public caprice, had violent ups and downs. What he would like
to do&mdash;and confidentially what Judge Marcus, who had appointed
him, thought ought to be done&mdash;was to arrange a settlement on
a basis of part cash and the balance in long-term notes. It might,
at first glance, look like pretty small pickings, but the only way
anybody would ever get any money was by giving them a chance.</p>

<p>In a word, then, he proposed that the Utopia Trust Company
should take in exchange for its million-dollar claim a cash payment
of fifteen thousand dollars and a series of notes payable at the
end of three years, aggregating nine hundred and eighty-five
thousand. Then sweeping aside Rufus's involuntary ejaculation of
protest, he wheezed on again.</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Kayne had better think it over. Everything was worth
thinking over. But that was what Mr. Stein and Mr. Savoy were going
to do, and their claims were considerably larger than that of the
Utopia.</p>

<p>This seemed to remind him, for the first time, that Mr. Stein
and Mr. Savoy were indorsers on the Utopia notes and that they had
a contingent liability. He remarked with seeming inconsequence that
they were peculiar men&mdash;both of them; and told a long rambling
story of their various misfortunes in different parts of the world,
in each of which somebody seemed to have gone to jail. It was all
very confused, and Rufus wondered what on earth it had to do with
anything in which he was concerned.</p>

<p>And then suddenly a chill crept up his spine. Mr. Krabfleisch
was recounting an experience of Mr. Savoy in which the latter had
joined a party of ladies and gentlemen in an excursion to Cape
May&mdash;in New Jersey, of all places in the world! On their
return there had been a great deal of trouble about the Mann Act.
Of course Mr. Kayne knew about the Mann Act?</p>

<p>Rufus, gazing hypnotized at him, made no answer. It was the act,
Mr. Krabfleisch recalled, that made it a crime for a gentleman and
lady to go from one State of the Union to another for certain
purposes. Mr. Savoy had had a very unpleasant time&mdash;very, very
unpleasant&mdash;with the United States District Attorney. He had
had to spend a lot of money&mdash;a lot of money! And he had never
forgotten it. He was a peculiar man.</p>

<p>Now about the notes. Both Mr. Stein and Mr. Savoy were down and
out. They had put everything they had into the Alpha-Omega; and had
nothing left in the world but their own claims against it. It was
hopeless to expect to hold them to their liability on those notes.
It would be much more agreeable all around if they could be
released in some way. Mr. Krabfleisch felt sure that Mr. Kayne with
all his influence could arrange it. After all, it would make no
difference in the end, but it would be so much pleasanter. Mr.
Savoy was a very nice man, but he was peculiar. Mr. Kayne knew Mr.
Savoy very well, did he not? Mr. Krabfleisch understood that they
had a mutual friend in&mdash;<i>Miss Delaval</i>.</p>

<p>Stark terror congealed the membranes of Rufus Kavne's throat.
The Mann Act! He knew all about it&mdash;a frequent subject of jest
at "The Corner Store." The devils! They had got him! Had put up a
game on him. Planned it all along from the very first. Salted away
their million, probably, and given that little slut of a Mercedes
her rake-off!</p>

<p>He stared at Krabfleisch with the fixed stare of a dead
man&mdash;his jaw hanging. But he could not see Krabfleisch, for
his eyes would not focus. He heard him speaking and was conscious
of the blur when he arose. Krabfleisch was sure the matter could be
arranged! The door closed softly behind him.</p>

<p>But Rufus did not move. He was choking. Sweat poured from him.
Blackmail! He thrust two fingers into his collar the better to
breathe. This would ruin him forever&mdash;prevent his ever taking
another position&mdash;disgrace the whole lot of them!</p>

<p>Trembling he got up and locked the door through which
Krabfleisch had made his exit. Then he felt his way into the
lavatory and washed his face. It was like washing the face of a
corpse! He felt weak&mdash;hardly able to stand&mdash;as if he had
been ill. He was ill. Everything seemed to be tumbling about
him&mdash;going to pieces! He could hear himself making queer,
meaningless sounds. Going mad, was he?</p>

<p>He felt for a cigar and tried to light it,
unsuccessfully&mdash;by the wrong end. He dropped it and began to
cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" he whimpered. "Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>But God did not answer.</p>

<p>He perceived that he could not stand this thing alone. That,
left to himself, he was quite capable of doing something foolish.
But to whom could he turn? What friend had he in whom he could
confide? Not one! His brother James?&mdash;Krass?&mdash;Thrum? He
uttered a hollow laugh more like a groan. Pepperill? There had been
a time&mdash;No! Not Pepperill! Anybody but
Pepperill!&mdash;Maitland! Why, yes! Of course! He turned to him
for everything. Only that very morning he had brought his will down
from the house and asked Lloyd to draw a codicil to it. They ought
to get busy and execute it.</p>

<p>The youth was in his customary attitude&mdash;leaning back in
his chair sucking on his short pipe&mdash;when the banker entered
his office. The smell of the smoke was comforting to Kayne. The
will lying on the blotter caught his eye. He was not interested in
wills! Under the electric light his face was livid, and Lloyd was
startled&mdash;fearing that Kayne had had a heart attack.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, sir?" he cried, leaping to his feet and
seizing him by the arm. "Take this chair!"</p>

<p>Kayne sank into it.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," he said. "I've merely had a bit of a jar."</p>

<p>He pulled out another cigar, fumbling it like an old man, as he
gradually regained control of himself.</p>

<p>"Thanks!"</p>

<p>This time he got the right end.</p>

<p>"I want your advice on a personal matter. The fact is, I've made
rather a fool of myself. I haven't done anything wrong&mdash;but
what I have done is susceptible of misconstruction. The fact is I
loaned some of our money to a subsidiary company of a corporation
in which I am a stockholder without knowing the relationship
between them. And it's all mixed up with another affair with a
young woman&mdash;to whom I never did the slightest harm.
However&mdash;I'm threatened with blackmail."</p>

<p>His face had resumed its normal color. He spoke in his customary
even tone.</p>

<p>"It's rather 'a tangled web'&mdash;complicated as those things
are apt to be. Anyhow, I have been asked to resign."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Lloyd. It was inconceivable!</p>

<p>"Yes. My connection with the Utopia ceases after May 25."</p>

<p>Maitland did not reply for several moments.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you how sorry I am for you!" he said at length.
"If there is anything in the wide world I can do&mdash;! Of course
I can't understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't blame you!" answered Rufus. "I can hardly understand it
myself. But the situation has got beyond me. I can't cope with it.
You have managed to become tied up with most of my
affairs&mdash;and I wish your good opinion besides, I want somebody
to know the truth. If anything should happen to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lloyd looked at him quickly.</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean that!" retorted Kayne shortly. "I want help. I
know you'll give me a fair hearing and an honest opinion. You can
imagine this is pretty hard forme!"</p>

<p>His lip quivered.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to think I am any worse than I am! You know my
family, you see, and&mdash;well, some time perhaps you can explain,
if worst comes to worst, that in a way I'm the victim of
circumstances." He laughed. "I suppose every&mdash;convict says the
same thing! But I think you'll agree that I really am. Now that
I've made a mess of my life&mdash;now that it's too late&mdash;I
can see why&mdash;I've had the wrong idea from the start. The
things I've been after haven't been worth while. I've been good
from a wrong motive and, I suppose, that's the next thing to being
bad."</p>

<p>He let his head sink between his shoulders, which seemed to
crumple beneath its weight.</p>

<p>"The irony of the situation is," he went on half as if to
himself, "that if I hadn't always lived clean&mdash;hadn't followed
the straight and narrow path&mdash;had let myself go like other
fellows&mdash;I'd probably not be in the mess I'm in now. The
children of evil are said to be wiser than the children of light,
aren't they? I'd have had the wisdom of experience. I would have
avoided the appearance of evil&mdash;good advice, that!"</p>

<p>He straightened himself and laid his cigar on the desk.</p>

<p>"One doesn't realize how close he is to the precipice. One
misstep and he's gone&mdash;dragging everything with him! I'm
telling you this merely so you'll not judge me too harshly. I can
see now that I should not have made that million-dollar loan to the
Alpha-Omega in the face of Pepperill's opposition. You remember
that I guaranteed the notes?"</p>

<p>Maitland nodded.</p>

<p>"I never did understand why," he said.</p>

<p>"Simply because Mr. Pepperill disapproved the loan&mdash;only to
be decent! Yet that is the reason they are throwing me
out&mdash;forcing me to resign. Coupled with the fact that
afterward I bought some stock in another company that controlled
the first&mdash;of which I was ignorant at the time.</p>

<p>"Well, that's done. I'm going! I've got to start all over again.
But I don't mind that so much. I don't even mind being obliged to
take up the loan myself&mdash;although it may mean selling all my
real property. What I do mind is the fact that these two scoundrels
who induced me to make the loan are now threatening me with a
prosecution under the Mann Act if I proceed against them upon their
indorsements."</p>

<p>"But what does the Mann Act have to do with their liability upon
these notes?"</p>

<p>"Through this man Savoy I made the acquaintance of a young
actress named Mercedes Delaval. She interested me. I 'fell for
her,' as the expression goes&mdash;made a fool of myself over her,
but I never did her any harm. I'm not proud of the affair, but
there was nothing wrong about it in the ordinary sense. There might
have been, of course. No doubt they intended that there should be.
I'm satisfied it was a put-up job to get me in a position where I
would not dare to sue them on their indorsements. Krabfleisch,
their lawyer, has just left my office&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how does Miss Delaval&mdash;" began Maitland.</p>

<p>"I took her to Atlantic City. There was a party of us. We
motored down. It was all entirely regular. Just a lark&mdash;an
excursion. But my name is on the hotel register and so is
hers."</p>

<p>Maitland was aghast.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he ejaculated. He could see the headlines in the
papers&mdash;the photographs of Mercedes in her leopard-skin
juxtaposed with those of Rufus Kayne in his cutaway&mdash;of Mrs.
Kayne, of Diana, Claudia, Sheila!</p>

<p>They need not even go to the length of having Kayne arrested for
a violation of the Mann Act to accomplish that. It would be amply
sufficient and quite in order for Mercedes to bring an action
against him based on some imaginary contractual obligation. They
could hold the other in reserve lest he should fight the case. And
if he did, and they stimulated a prosecution under the Federal law,
they might even succeed in putting Kayne in jail. He would not be
the only obstinate millionaire who had landed in Atlanta under the
same charge.</p>

<p>"If you do not proceed against Stein and Savoy on their
indorsements, will they stay quiet?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"How about the Delaval woman? Is she likely to make
trouble?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why she should," answered Rufus bluntly. "She has
no claim on me of any kind whatsoever. It's quite possible that she
may have been an unconscious tool in Savoy's hands, or he may have
utilized a situation which grew up inadvertently. She seemed like a
nice girl. I do not think that she would make any trouble for me if
left to herself."</p>

<p>"She's a friend of your daughter's."</p>

<p>Kayne blinked at him.</p>

<p>"A friend&mdash;of Diana's?" he repeated, incredulous.</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>A flush gathered upon the face of the banker.</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"I have met her myself at Miss Kayne's studio."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that Diana associates with women like that?"</p>

<p>His mind reverted to the midnight motor run with Mercedes to
Atlantic City.</p>

<p>"You said yourself that she seemed like a nice girl!"</p>

<p>The color of Kayne's face deepened and his eyes refused to meet
those of the lawyer. Nothing could have more startlingly
demonstrated to him the consequences of his own reckless disregard
of his responsibility toward his children than the fact that he
might have taken as his mistress this girl who was a friend of one
of them.</p>

<p>He remembered how Diana, on the occasion when he had lunched at
the Croyon in the company of Stein and Savoy, had addressed the
former familiarly as "Al" and the latter as "Tad." Was it
conceivable that his eldest daughter was a friend and intimate of
these two blackmailers? That she was accustomed to entertain them
and their women? What did he know of her habits, of her associates?
What was there to prevent her from becoming another Mercedes?</p>

<p>"How soon are you obliged to take up these notes?" asked
Maitland, drawing over a pad and taking up a pencil.</p>

<p>"By May 25&mdash;the day my resignation takes effect," replied
the banker.</p>

<p>"Of course they are valueless&mdash;can't be discounted for
anything?"</p>

<p>"Not for a cent!"</p>

<p>"Can you raise the money?"</p>

<p>"Only by selling my two houses&mdash;unless Stein or Savoy make
good."</p>

<p>Suddenly Rufus Kayne laid his head upon his hands.</p>

<p>"I'm at my wit's end!" he declared. "I've lost my nerve. I want
somebody to buck me up&mdash;to tell me what to do. To think for me
and stand back of me."</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which Kayne mopped his eyes with his
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Well, you've come to the right place!" Lloyd assured him. "And
we'll hope for the best. Let's see now, our first question is:
Shall you sue Stein and Savoy or settle on their terms? Well,
they're a pair of professional blackmailers and bankrupts. If you
proceed against them, you'll get nothing except a summons and you
may find yourself in jail&mdash;a rich man has very little chance
these days. No. I guess you'd better not sue Messrs. Stein and
Savoy."</p>

<p>He made a dot on the pad, smiled slightly, and carefully drew a
circle around it.</p>

<p>"Now then! Next question: How are you going to raise a million
dollars by May 25? You say that you can do so by the sale of your
real estate, but of course you don't want to do that unless you
have to. Can't you borrow the money?"</p>

<p>Rufus shook his head.</p>

<p>"I've already sold most of my marketable securities and realized
one hundred thousand dollars. I might perhaps, at the outside,
raise another hundred thousand. All my other investments are
non-liquid&mdash;frozen, so to speak. I shall need at least eight
hundred thousand dollars. My father has already turned over his
fortune to my brother James, to my sister Mrs. Mallory, and myself.
Neither of them is in a position to lend me any such sum or even a
substantial fraction of it. My town house has a mortgage on it
already, put there for the purpose of meeting taxation. My country
house is not worth more than a hundred and fifty thousand&mdash;if
that much. I shall have to sell both of them. I can't raise the
money otherwise."</p>

<p>It almost seemed at the moment as if Rufus Kayne took a certain
grim satisfaction in the definiteness of this knowledge.</p>

<p>"But, after all," continued Lloyd, "this is only a temporary
embarrassment. Haven't you any friends or business associates who
either individually or as a syndicate could underwrite your
liability or let you have the money on what collateral you
have?"</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;None!" answered Kayne laconically.</p>

<p>There was a circular containing a printed list of the trust
company's directors lying upon Maitland's desk and he reached out
and pulled it toward him. Surely among them there must be one or
more who would come to the banker's assistance. After all, it would
be only a temporary accommodation and ultimately safe.</p>

<p>"How about Senator Krass?" he inquired, running his eye down the
list. He knew the two had been very friendly.</p>

<p>"The hypocritical old wolf!" ejaculated Rufus.</p>

<p>"Mr. Phillips?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Or Mr. Graham?"</p>

<p>"Never in the world!"</p>

<p>Maitland kept on, rapidly skimming over the names.</p>

<p>"Vandergrift&mdash;Phelps&mdash;Thompson?"</p>

<p>"No! No! You don't suppose the very men who are kicking me out
and insisting upon my paying this money are going to lend it to
me?"</p>

<p>"How about Mr. Pepperill?"</p>

<p>"Bah!"</p>

<p>"Devereaux?"</p>

<p>Maitland bit his lips. He had read the name automatically. The
two men looked away from one another. Rufus had already thought of
Devereaux as a solution of his difficulties. To the proprietor of
Treasure Island a loan of a million dollars on any sort of security
would be a bagatelle. Any bank in the city would make it upon his
indorsement or possibly upon his mere request. But on what ground
could Rufus ask him for financial assistance? They were not
friends. Their only business connection was as co-directors of the
trust company from which Kayne was about to resign and to which he
was obligated to refund the million dollars in question.</p>

<p>The only possible claim which Rufus had upon the sportsman was
through his daughter. Should it be known that he had borrowed from
Devereaux&mdash;particularly any such sum&mdash;the situation would
be susceptible of the grossest misconstruction; would suggest an
intimacy between the sportsman and Diana which, even if it in fact
did not exist, might then fairly be assumed, and which naturally
would be viewed by a cynical world as polite blackmail.</p>

<p>"Leave Devereaux out of it!" he answered with a scowl. "There's
no one. All my business associates are connected with the Utopia.
There's no help for it. I've gone over the whole thing. I've got to
realize on my two houses&mdash;and at once. Frankly, I don't care
very much. I never liked either of them. The thing that hurts is
telling my father. He's eighty-one years old and not very strong.
I'm afraid it will hit him pretty hard. He has a grossly
exaggerated idea of my position&mdash;and my character. There's no
other way out of this mess."</p>

<p>"Not on your statement of the case," agreed Lloyd.</p>

<p>"Then the sooner we get rid of them the better. I'll leave the
matter entirely to you. Private sale or auction, as you may deem
best."</p>

<p>"There's very little time to negotiate a sale," said
Maitland.</p>

<p>"Then arrange for an auction. Real estate is pretty high now,
everything considered. Sell the furnishings at the same time.
Whoever buys the house might bid them up. We ought to clear six
hundred thousand over the mortgage."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir!&mdash;I'll take it up with the Peterman people
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>Rufus arose and stretched his arms.</p>

<p>The action, while natural enough&mdash;had a certain
automaton-like quality. He seemed pretematurally calm. Lloyd
watched him nervously, expecting momentarily an explosion of some
sort. People didn't act like that under such circumstances!</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, that's settled!" remarked Rufus, using almost the
same formula as he had on reading of Sheila's début the morning
after. "Sometimes it seems as if everything were tumbling about
your head, but if you take 'em one by one somehow&mdash;you
generally manage to muddle through. Do you remember our first
meeting?"</p>

<p>Maitland recalled it very well. The memory of it had in fact
been obtruding itself upon him for some time during the
interview.</p>

<p>"You consulted me about your daughter, Lady Harrowdale," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Yes. Pepperill turned me over to you. I thought at first you
were too inexperienced. But I was mistaken. You've done a lot more
for me than Pepperill ever did. Funny how you associate good or bad
fortune with different people. I'm not superstitious&mdash;not a
bit! But I've never had any luck with Pepperill."</p>

<p>"Wasn't he your adviser during the most successful part of your
business career?" inquired Maitland, rallying to the support of his
old friend.</p>

<p>Kayne brushed a stray lock from his temple.</p>

<p>"That's so&mdash;he was," he admitted with a puzzled air. "All
the same, I don't have the feeling that I had any luck with him.
Now with you it's entirely different. I feel somehow as if I'd had
good luck&mdash;whereas, in fact ever since you've acted as my
attorney, it's been just one damn thing after another!
Funny&mdash;isn't it?"</p>

<p>He put one foot on a rung of the chair in front of him and gazed
round the room as if amused by his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Queer old world! I suppose you'd say that I'd been a successful
man. I guess I can say that without false modesty. I was successful
right up to the moment they demanded my resignation as president of
this trust company. A hard wallop, that! Hurt my pride. The curious
part of it is, though, that looking back over my life&mdash;just as
I had the idea I'd never had any luck with Pepperill&mdash;it
doesn't seem as if I'd had any luck at all. Understand me? I have
an impression just the other way&mdash;of failure&mdash;up to the
time they fired me. And the queerest part of all is that since that
time, ever since I've been down and out&mdash;except possibly for a
bad moment over that Delaval thing&mdash;I've had a sense of being
in luck&mdash;of relief&mdash;silver-lining-to-the-cloud sort of
business. That's where you come in&mdash;with the silver
lining."</p>

<p>He chuckled, stroking his chin.</p>

<p>"Krass would think I was a fool if he heard me. So would James,
Thrum, Graham, Follansbee&mdash;all that old crowd, I guess. Well,
they're all part of my bad luck! I'd be glad never to see any of
'em again! Be glad of a fresh deal all round."</p>

<p>Maitland had lit his pipe again and was leaning back against the
wall. He had never had much respect for Kayne&mdash;had always
regarded him as a rather poor thing&mdash;until now.</p>

<p>"If you really feel that way," he said, "there must be a reason
for it."</p>

<p>"Of course there's a reason!" answered his client eagerly. "If
you knew the whole story&mdash;all the details of this Mercedes
business, for instance&mdash;you'd understand it&mdash;just as I
do. We're all of us walking the tight rope&mdash;every man jack of
us. The ones who have learned to keep their balance go right along
as a matter of course&mdash;no danger at all! The others fall off.
If you've got the right sort of ideals and stick to them, you never
get into any trouble&mdash;never have to worry&mdash;you're safe.
If you haven't, you're in danger every minute. Well, I didn't have
the right sort of ideals&mdash;I didn't have the balance. Over I
went!"</p>

<p>He put on his hat. There was a look akin to serenity on his
broad sallow face.</p>

<p>"Well, good night!" he said.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>Chapter 25. Himself Again</h2>

<p>Rufus Kayne had entered his trust company that morning a figure;
he left it a man. He had for some time been going through a process
by virtue of which the sawdust in his veins was being liquefied
into blood. Even his disreputable experience with Mercedes had
helped to humanize him. But it had been left for the experiences of
the afternoon to complete his awakening, to open his eyes and show
him exactly what he was&mdash;a shoddy second-rater, a cheap sham,
a person whose conduct had even savored of criminality. Pride
vanished. He no longer&mdash;as usual, when riding down in the
elevator&mdash;saw himself a financial Jove descending in a cloud
from his Olympian throne; no longer felt it necessary to bear
himself as one of the great ones of the earth, to "throw a front,"
as he might have said; no longer to look down upon his fellows as
from a height.</p>

<p>The balloon of his arrogance had burst and he was sailing
earthward, dangling from the parachute of humiliation. He had not
yet got near enough to the ground for the common herd to be able to
see him, but he was coming&mdash;a swaying, deflated dummy of what
had once been a regal figure in the court of Vanity Fair. Always
Rufus theretofore had condescended to those about him, nodding
stiffly to the starter&mdash;if at all. To-night he called him
"Jim" and asked how much off time he got. He really felt the relief
which any royal personage must feel when <i>incognito</i> he finds it no
longer necessary to pose and strut. For he perceived that he had
been strutting and posing all his life, trying to make himself
conform to his idea of what a financier should appear to be, and
wholly unconcerned about what he himself was really like. In a
word, he was looking through the shell and crust of his outside
into the vacant dusty chamber of his soul.</p>

<p>His attitude toward others was also changed. Six months before
he had viewed Maitland as a mere youngster&mdash;an unimportant
underling of Pepperill's, who "cut no particular ice" and whom he
could patronize as he chose; to-day his attitude was quite the
reverse. He saw that Maitland was his superior in every way and he
was ready frankly to acknowledge it. The boy was true, and he was
false.</p>

<p>He was no philosopher, always remarking with an air of
complacency that he didn't even understand the <i>lingo</i>, but now, for
the first time, his mind began seriously to dwell upon ideas rather
than things&mdash;because those ideas had a vital application to
him and his. "It's something born in you!" he said to himself as he
walked up Broadway. "And if you haven't got it&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He wondered whether if "it" wasn't bom in you, it was possible
to acquire "it"&mdash;and pass "it" on to your children. He almost
wished he was going to change his social status, cease to belong to
the army of the prosperous. Tackle life all over again and see how
heavily he would score. No, it was too late. He'd had his chance
and lost it&mdash;had foozled life completely.</p>

<p>Yet he had done pretty nearly what Peter B. had
planned&mdash;followed his instructions&mdash;obeyed orders
implicitly&mdash;and accomplished what the old man had hoped for.
It was the fault of both of them. The old man could hardly be
blamed for not having known better. But he himself should have
known better! He could not tell his father that, for that would be
accusing his father, and his father wouldn't understand it, anyway.
No, so far as the old man was concerned he would have to play the
game and confess failure: "Father, I have sinned against Heaven and
in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son." It made
him laugh ironically&mdash;the idea of that deception!</p>

<p>Suppose he should go in and say, as he truthfully might: "Well,
dad, I've lost my job&mdash;I'm down and
out&mdash;busted&mdash;done for! But it's largely your fault,
because you taught me that the only purpose of the game was to make
money. For forty years I've spent all my energy, all my time, all
my brains on that, and now the money is gone, there's nothing
left&mdash;not a damn thing!" The old man would think him crazy, of
course. Wouldn't have an idea of what he was talking about!</p>

<p>Poor old pirate! What a shame he had to be told. Just at the
moment when he was so happy with his greatgrandchildren! And
Elizabeth&mdash;she'd certainly make a scene! A woman as old as
that got so set in her ways. Not that she would really have to
change her mode of life, but she would think that she would. She'd
still be in the motor class. They'd have a million&mdash;maybe a
little more. Simply have to give up Northampton in the summer for a
less expensive place. And thank God for it!</p>

<p>But it would hurt his father to have to move out of the house.
It would hurt him badly&mdash;for in the old man's mind the house
stood for everything that he had in life. All his dreams, all his
ambitions for himself and his family after him. Besides, it didn't
do to move old people. They were apt not to last long afterward. It
was a shame!</p>

<p>A swelling rose in his throat as he came in sight of the house.
A shame! The old fellow at that very moment, probably, was sitting
up there on the top floor smoking his pipe, after cooking his own
supper and playing a game of checkers with Uncle Billy McGaw or
with Sheila&mdash;perfectly contented and happy. What would he say?
He'd think his son had done something crooked! Old people were
suspicious. It might break his heart.</p>

<p>The tears smarted in his eyes as he winked them back, ashamed to
use his handkerchief for that purpose. He knew that the old man's
heart was the dearest thing in his whole life, and that beside his
love for his father his love for his children was small indeed. He
wondered why. Could it be that there had always been a barrier
between him and them? The barrier reared of his own neglect? Of his
own insincerity? The barrier erected by the knowledge that he had
not been true to them?</p>

<p>The nearer Rufus approached to his home, which must needs be
sacrificed, the more fearful he became as to the effect the
disclosure he was about to make might have upon his father. It
struck him&mdash;as he approached the corner upon which he had
lived for so many busy years, where his children had all been bom,
where one of them had been married, and where his personal life had
centred&mdash;it struck him as peculiar that this house of his did
not mean more to him, that he was not more familiar with it and its
appearance outside and inside. Come to think of it, he had never
paid any particular attention to its appearance. Had taken it for
granted, as it were. Beyond the fact that it was rectangular, four
stories high, of brownstone, with some patches of red brick and
here and there a panel or entablature of wreaths and flowers, he
could not have described it to save his life.</p>

<p>There were steps, of course; and a heavy brownstone balustrade;
but he could not have stated more if his life had been at stake. A
queer thing! And it was the same way with the inside. He knew the
general plan, yes. Could recall the hall, the dining-room and
library and his own bedroom; but the rest of the house&mdash;except
the top floor where his father lived with Uncle Billy&mdash;was
almost a blank to him.</p>

<p>How was this possible? Was it because he had never really lived
in that house at all? Was it because his life had been all
down-town, in Wall Street? "For where thy treasure is, there will
thy heart be also!" And his treasure was all down-town. No, his
heart had not been in this brownstone house.</p>

<p>Now it took on a new interest for him. He might have had so much
pleasure out of it&mdash;out of his up-town life&mdash;if he hadn't
focussed all his attention on his downtown life. Even at his own
dinner table he had been always thinking about business, although
he carefully refrained from discussing it with his wife and
daughters, as if it were too sacred a subject to be profaned by
domestic talk. Frankly, this house had been nothing more than a
hotel to him&mdash;a hall bedroom where he slept. Suppose the old
man had foreseen all this, would he have built it? Rufus thanked
God in his heart that his father had not foreseen. Most blessed of
all limitations&mdash;the inability to know the future!</p>

<p>The humidity, the reeking atmosphere, added to Rufus's
weariness. His shoulders were hunched a little as he walked along,
grasping his unrolled umbrella in the middle; he looked worried and
old. Even his clothes&mdash;the carefully cut black overcoat with
silk lapels, the sharply creased trousers, the smoothly brushed
derby hat that always looked a little too large for him&mdash;had
lost their spruceness.</p>

<p>It had been drizzling all day, the clouds lying low and ominous,
giving the tall buildings the effect of hills hung with mist; and
the sidewalks were wet, with wide, slow-draining pools upon the
crossings. Ahead of him&mdash;up by the Park somewhere&mdash;a
narrow blue strip showed beneath the bank of wind-torn cumulus. A
velvet wind, beneath which one felt an icy claw, whisked out of a
side street and yanked his coat-tails. There was a "lift" in the
air. People bent to the April flurry.</p>

<p>The blue band widened, deepening into an aperture of
unfathomable opalescence. The edges of the overhanging fog-bank
smoked with writhing wisps of gold. A magic beam of red shot from
the west and tipped the gilded weather cock on the tower of the
Heckscher Building a half-mile above him at Fifty-seventh Street.
Then the clouds dissolved. The universe went blue. The white
shafts, the corniced roofs, the chimneys, all the canyon tops, swam
in a dazzling flood of rose.</p>

<p>Rufus raised his eyes to the glory. They rested upon his own
roof, illuminated as by a crimson spot-light. He had never observed
it before under such auspices. He winked and looked again. A
man&mdash;two men!&mdash;were sitting cross-legged up
there&mdash;on two of the chimneys. He stopped and put on his
glasses. A tramp, a ragged little girl, a salesman, and a young
couple out for a walk also stopped out of curiosity. He remembered
the figures now well enough. They had always been there. A fancy of
the architect's! There was old Howlett himself, in smock and tarn,
sitting in effigy, smiling, chin in cupped hand, and gazing down
upon his work; and opposite&mdash;watching him, it seemed to Rufus,
with a malicious, mocking grin&mdash;was a naked homed devil, his
forked-tail swung over his shoulder. They had been sitting there
for the last forty years! And few the wiser. Hardly anybody ever
noticed them from the street. He had almost forgotten that they
were there.</p>

<p>Funny old bird, Howlett! But it was a bit uncanny. He did not
like to think that that devil had been sitting there all the time
almost within reach of his old father&mdash;with only the roof
between them. And right over his own head! The devil laughing at
the architect&mdash;the architect laughing at the owner. Well,
architects always laughed at owners. He straightened out the frown
into which his features had unconsciously drawn and started on.</p>

<p>"I say, guv'nor," wheezed the tramp slouching along beside him,
"cairn't yer help a poor feller to a bite?"</p>

<p>Rufus handed him what change he had. The salesman nodded
good-naturedly as he passed them.</p>

<p>"Funny thing&mdash;those two up there!" he remarked.</p>

<p>The eerie sensation he had experienced lingered with him as he
climbed the steps and rang the bell. He always made a point of
ringing the bell instead of using his key, the better to keep the
servants on their job. No, he'd had no luck living there.</p>

<p>An old couplet floated in his memory:</p>

<p class="poem">"For there's nae luck about the house,<br>
There's nae luck at a'!"</p>

<p>He forgot that it ended "when our gudeman's awa'." Yet it would
have been just as apposite&mdash;Rufus had always been away.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it was his house&mdash;even if it had never had for him
the quality of a home&mdash;and he was used to it, just as he was
used to Elizabeth, even if she wasn't much of a wife. Too bad!</p>

<p>Jarmon opened the door, inclining himself deferentially, and
Rufus stepped across the threshold into the heavy upholstered
atmosphere of the front hall. Somehow he always fancied that he
could detect just a suggestion of moth-balls. A strange hat and
coat were lying on the table.</p>

<p>"Mr. Devereaux is waiting to see you, sir. I showed him into the
library."</p>

<p>Kayne raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>What could Devereaux be calling about?</p>

<p>"Tell him I have come in and will be with him in a moment." He
let Jarmon help him off with his coat.</p>

<p>"I'm in for dinner to-night. Tell Mrs. Kayne."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Are my daughters dining in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That is, Lady Harrowdale is&mdash;and Miss Kayne.
Miss Sheila is away."</p>

<p>"Well. Take my message to Mr. Devereaux."</p>

<p>Rufus turned into a small room leading off the hall while Jarmon
plodded up the stairs.</p>

<p>What had brought Devereaux there? He had never called before.
Never called anywhere. It must be something of importance.
Perhaps&mdash;perhaps he had come to offer his help! Wouldn't that
make a difference in the whole aspect of the thing? If a man
voluntarily offered you money, it wasn't at all the same as asking
him for it. He breathed rapidly, standing in the shadowy
reception-room. By George! A way out. Well, he must wait and see.
One thing sure, he must not turn anything like that down offhand.
He walked to the elevator, mopping his forehead with a large silk
handkerchief. The ride up cooled him off. A tall figure was
standing at the window.</p>

<p>"Mr. Devereaux?"</p>

<p>The figure turned quickly.</p>

<p>"How do you do, sir!"</p>

<p>There was no suggestion of embarrassment or self-consciousness.
His tone was respectful&mdash;deferential even.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down? Have a cigar?"</p>

<p>"I'll smoke a cigarette if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"A whiskey and soda?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>The two sank into opposite chairs, Rufus reaching first for a
cigar from the small humidor on the adjacent table.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kayne," began Devereaux, "I have come here this afternoon
partly to express my regret at the action of the directors, which I
regard as unnecessarily severe, and partly to attempt to rectify
their mistake or, at any rate, to mitigate the harshness of their
exaction. Of course I don't know anything in detail about your
affairs, but a million dollars is something of an amount to raise
in these days without good security."</p>

<p>Rufus gripped his cigar tight between his lips to conceal his
excitement.</p>

<p>"I took the trouble to have those two indorsers looked up, and
I'm sorry to say that I don't see a chance of your getting anything
from them. No doubt you've already found out the same thing for
yourself. Now, what I really called to say is that, if this demand
of the board that you assume the Alpha-Omega notes is going to
embarrass you, I think I know a bank which, it so happens, might
loan you the money&mdash;even without the ordinary sort of
security."</p>

<p>He spoke simply, with no suggestion that what he proposed was in
any way unusual; and his narrow, highbred face, with its black hair
brushed straight back from the forehead, seemed to Kayne quite the
most amiable, sympathetic, and handsome that he had ever seen. He
saw he had done Devereaux a great injustice in thinking of him as a
snob&mdash;or a fellow who put on dog. He now ascribed the
millionaire's previous aloofness to the difference in their ages.
Whatever he did about Devereaux's offer, he was glad it had been
made.</p>

<p>A warm-hearted, generous act! Its acceptance would save the
situation, render it unnecessary for him to disclose his disgrace
to the old man upstairs, enable the family to maintain its social
prestige. What a pity it couldn't be accepted! Must it be refused,
after all? The vision of the feeble old man up there on the top
floor came to him&mdash;tottering around his cabinet of specimens.
Didn't he owe it to him to keep the roof over his head no matter on
what terms? It was the pirate's house&mdash;mot his own, except in
form. He opened his mouth to speak&mdash;and closed it again. The
silence had become awkward.</p>

<p>The light had faded from the sky-line and the room had become
quite dark where the outlines of the furniture bulked black against
the windows. He ran two fingers part way round his collar. His last
chance. Last call to save his old dad and his house. And then he
suddenly straightened in his chair. Why was Devereaux offering to
do this thing? A man didn't hand around a million dollars just out
of amiability! Suppose Devereaux was in love with Diana? By George!
Suppose he wanted to marry her? There would be nothing
objectionable in taking a loan from a prospective son-in-law.
Perhaps he had never proposed to her&mdash;was going to ask for her
hand now. Why not? Something&mdash;the smoke of his
cigar&mdash;made Rufus cough. In that case&mdash;everything would
be all right! Smooth sailing forevermore! With Devereaux for a
son-in-law&mdash;success assured! He must give him a chance to
speak before he threw away such an opportunity as this!</p>

<p>"I&mdash;really&mdash;" he said, never having felt more awkward.
"This is totally unexpected&mdash;more than generous of you."</p>

<p>Devereaux made a belittling gesture with his cigarette.</p>

<p>"There's nothing particularly generous about it," he returned.
"Of course I assume you're in a position to secure the loan
somehow. It's an accommodation&mdash;but there's no risk&mdash;the
kind of thing that any man who could would be glad to do for a
friend."</p>

<p>For a friend! Rufus drew heavily on his cigar. Once more he was
the man of business&mdash;studying his next move. Slowly feeling
his way he said:</p>

<p>"I am delighted that you regard me in that light."</p>

<p>"Then I hope you will let me to do you this slight service?"</p>

<p>Rufus broke his cigar-ash against the handle of a bronze
receiver.</p>

<p>"I am most grateful, of course," he temporized. "But I really
don't know why you should offer to do this for me."</p>

<p>"Simply on account of your daughter, sir," replied
Devereaux.</p>

<p>Anybody could see the fellow was as straight as a string! There
was no funny business between him and Diana. But if he were so fond
of her, why didn't he marry her? Perhaps this was his way of going
about it.</p>

<p>"Well, how are things there?" blundered Rufus hopefully.</p>

<p>Devereaux drew back, frowning.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you!" he answered coldly.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see," stammered the banker, "if you were in love
with my daughter and wanted to marry her&mdash;that would be one
thing! Otherwise there wouldn't be any adequate
explanation&mdash;In a word, the business might be
misinterpreted."</p>

<p>"But I do want to marry her!" burst out Devereaux. "I've wanted
to marry her for five years&mdash;and have asked her over and over
again. But she won't have me&mdash;says she doesn't care for me
that way!"</p>

<p>"In that case I can't take your money!" declared Rufus. Then, as
he thought of the old man upstairs, he gave way. "By gad, I wish
she would marry you!" he groaned with real emotion.</p>

<p>An exclamation caused them to turn toward the door. Diana stood
between the portieres, one hand upon the electric push-button. It
snapped and the room leaped into light.</p>

<p>"Marry <i>whom?</i>" she demanded of them furiously.</p>

<p>Devereaux stepped forward, his hand outstretched.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Diana!" he greeted her. Rufus had turned away
toward the fireplace. Diana, scornfully erect, kept her
distance.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help overhearing you. Jarmon said you were here, and
I came to the door to see if you were nearly through talking to
father. What's all this about money and marrying? Tell me!" She
stamped her foot.</p>

<p>"Don't go off the handle, Diana," protested her father. "It's
all simple enough! I'm a ruined man&mdash;lost my position, salary,
and everything&mdash;got to sell this house over your grandfather's
head unless I can raise a lot of money inside of three weeks!"</p>

<p>"And you tried to get it from Larry? Oh, Father!"</p>

<p>"No! No!" interrupted Devereaux. "The idea was my own. I came
here and made the suggestion voluntarily."</p>

<p>"That's God's truth!" confirmed her father.</p>

<p>She focussed on each of them in turn a flash of suspicion.</p>

<p>"And did your suggestion include a proposal of marriage? Oh,
Larry! Did you think you could buy my father?"</p>

<p>He stepped swiftly toward her and grasped her arms.</p>

<p>"Steady, Di!" he cried. "You know me too well to make a charge
like that. I offered to lend your father a million dollars. He
asked me why I did it. I said it was because I had always been fond
of you and wanted to marry you. I also said that I knew it was no
use but that it naturally made me wish to do him a good turn if I
could. Then he said what you overheard."</p>

<p>"That's just how it was," echoed the banker. "Why are you always
raising the devil and upsetting everything? Here we were having a
perfectly friendly talk and in you come like an actress making a
grand entrance and turn it into a scene for a theatre. Nothing's
happened at all! Except that I'm smashed! I'd intended to break the
news to you all to-night. Well, you've got it now. Maybe it'll do
you good."</p>

<p>He leaned his elbow on the mantel and rested his head on his
hand. Diana faced him.</p>

<p>"Let go of me, Larry! How did you lose your money, father?"</p>

<p>"I guaranteed some notes that turned out no good."</p>

<p>"Whose?"</p>

<p>"Your friends&mdash;'Al' Stein and 'Tad' Savoy."</p>

<p>She spread her hands.</p>

<p>"No wonder you're ruined!"</p>

<p>"But your father is being made to suffer unduly&mdash;he is
being penalized for a perfectly honest and well-intentioned
business action," explained Devereaux. "He has been forced to
resign his position and required to take up the notes, besides. I'm
on the board that has made this demand, and I feel it my duty to
assist him to find the money."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"A million."</p>

<p>Diana shook her head defiantly.</p>

<p>"No, Larry! Not on your life! Father has made his bed&mdash;we
all have&mdash;now let us lie in it! I'm glad the money's gone.
What good has it been? What's the good of this house? What's the
good of any of us? All we do is to eat and sleep and buy clothes
and amuse ourselves&mdash;except father, and all he does is to earn
the money so we can eat and sleep and play. I'm tired of this house
and I'm tired of our sort of life. It would be a good thing if we
all of us had to work. We're too soft! No, Larry! Leave us alone!
The house is too old, the timbers are decayed, the dry-rot is on
the beams, it's going to collapse&mdash;let it go!"</p>

<p>Rufus was staring at her fixedly. Devereaux took her hand as it
hung at her side.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid this has upset you, dear. Good night, Mr. Kayne.
Think my offer over. There's plenty of time."</p>

<p>He pressed her hand, holding it for a moment, and then stepped
past her to the stairs. She watched him pathetically, hating to
have him go. After all, he had done a fine and chivalrous thing in
making his offer to her father, and she had treated him as if he
had been the bearer of an insult. She could not let him go like
that.</p>

<p>"Larry! Larry!" she called.</p>

<p>He was just going out the door as she ran down the stairs. He
stepped back.</p>

<p>"What is it, Di?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you something," she said, dragging him toward
the small reception-room, which, like the hall, was not
lighted.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said, as she led him into the bay window, where
Jarmon could not see them.</p>

<p>"It's just that you're a dear!" she whispered, and putting her
arms around his neck she drew down his head and kissed him.</p>

<p>They stood there thus for several seconds, their shadows merged
into a single outline upon the curtain of the middle
window&mdash;long enough for Maitland, who was just coming up the
front steps with the codicil to Rufus's will which they had
forgotten to execute in his pocket, to have the silhouette branded
upon his vision. Without carrying out his errand, he turned on his
heel and descended to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>But this time what he had seen did not merely arouse in him an
inexplicable sense of personal injury. Rather, it filled him with
blank despair. Now he knew that he loved Diana&mdash;as she
was&mdash;whatever she was! Too late. There was no mistaking the
scene inside the window. The house of Kayne would not fall with the
Devereaux millions behind it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter 26. The Devil and the
Architect</h2>

<p>Rufus stood gazing stupidly through the portieres. Put his foot
in it again, had he? And for the same reason! Couldn't he ever
stick to a course of conduct? If not, what chance of success had
he? "Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel!" But why should he be
unstable? How foolish of him to be diverted&mdash;to weaken that
way. Those two roosting upon the roof, had they put a curse on him,
on the house! No wonder they wore those ironical grins. Anyway,
he'd broken the news to Diana. The worst was over. The rest would
be comparatively easy.</p>

<p>He threw his cigar into the fireplace and pressed the bell.
Jarmon appeared.</p>

<p>"Where is Mrs. Kayne?"</p>

<p>"I t hink she's upstairs in her room, sir."</p>

<p>"How many to dinner?"</p>

<p>"Only you and the madam, sir."</p>

<p>Rufus looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>"How's that? Isn't Lady Harrowdale at home?"</p>

<p>"She sent word she's not cornin' down, sir."</p>

<p>"But the others?"</p>

<p>"Miss Diana 'as just gone out again, sir. Said she wouldn't be
back. And Miss Sheila 'as gone away."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir; she didn't say. She went day before
yesterday."</p>

<p>Rufus, still staring at Jarmon, grunted.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Jarmon. "Anything more, sir?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Rufus. There you were! A great sort of a
home&mdash;nobody ever in! Was that why those two were grinning so
up there on the roof? Had old Howlett known how it was going to be
when he had built the house? Who had built it? Old Howlett or that
other; the one with the tail and the shrouded, bat-like wings? What
was he doing up there, cross-legged on the chimney? It was a damned
outrage on Howlett's part! A thing like that might have an
influence, you never could tell. A damned outrage! The room seemed
unconscionably hot. Automatically he put his handkerchief to his
face and wiped off a slight film of dew that had gathered about his
lips. He had had a bad day. The Krabfleisch business had taken the
guts out of him. His path to the door was slightly irregular.</p>

<p>"Jarmon!" he called over the banister. "Get me a glass of
Scotch."</p>

<p>He tossed it off while the butler waited to take away the empty
glass.</p>

<p>"Is there an axe in the house?"</p>

<p>"A <i>what</i>, sir!"</p>

<p>Jarmon seemed to take the inquiry as a personal affront.</p>

<p>"An axe&mdash;or a hatchet?"</p>

<p>"I think William 'as an 'atchet, sir. In the cellar."</p>

<p>"Well, bring it up here."</p>

<p>He put the glass down on the tray with a bang.</p>

<p>"Do you wish it 'ere, sir?" incredulously.</p>

<p>"I said 'here'!"</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>Jarmon withdrew with an air of protest. Expect him to go down
into the cellar, did they? It was a bit thick! However, he
reappeared shortly holding the hatchet wrapped in a newspaper
before him in both hands.</p>

<p>"All right!" said Rufus. "That's all!"</p>

<p>He had acted on impulse in sending Jarmon for the hatchet. Now
that it was there&mdash;actually in his grasp&mdash;the impulse was
even stronger. A damned outrage! Lucky he hadn't had it when
Krabfleisch was in his office. An immens e indignation possessed
him against Howlett. The elevator groaned and scraped as it bore
him upward to the unaccustomed penthouse on the roof containing its
complicated machinery; and it refused to go the full distance.
Rufus had to step up seven or eight inches. The lock on the
penthouse door was rusty, and at first he was afraid he could not
manage it. Then unexpectedly the key turned. He forced the heavy
door open with his shoulder amid a shower of dislodged particles of
dust, and stepped out upon the grimy tin-covered roof.</p>

<p>He paused, amazed at the beauty of the city blazing below him.
The wind had died. The heavens were coruscated with stars. A hidden
war-ship on the Hudson was feeling for a constellation with
wavering antennae. Times Square glowed like a bonfire. All about
him rose strange bulwarks, tanks, ventilators, chimneys. Funny
place, like the unfrequented top deck of an ocean liner!</p>

<p>He closed the door of the penthouse behind him, carefully
adjusting the elevator so that he would not be left there stranded.
He had never been up there before, and it seemed to him a terrific
height above the street. Very dirty! An old broom, black and half
rubbed away, lay at his feet, the only sign of human attention.
Cautiously&mdash;self-consciously, his eye searched for the two
figures. There was no difficulty about finding them. Enormous, they
were! Pretty human, they looked, when you got right up to them! The
one of Howlett, especially!</p>

<p>He walked around the statue of the architect, gripping the
hatchet tightly. But a curious feeling of taking an unfair
advantage held him back. Some atavistic reverberation&mdash;or the
lifelike pose&mdash;momentarily persuaded him that it was
Howlett&mdash;or part of him. He could not bring hims elf to strike
the defenseless image. After all, Howlett had not meant any harm
and he was dead&mdash;long ago. Hatchet in hand, he walked to the
other side of the roof, looking for Satan. Suddenly the
search-light in its sweep around the horizon caught the roof, and
the statue fairly leaped at him, its features distorted in a
mocking, reddish grin. There it sat, chin in hand, with its forked
tail cocked over its shoulder, leering straight at him. Howlett's
silent partner! The full glare of the search-light turned the
statue to fire.</p>

<p>Below lay the purple city like an imperial courtesan, the
bridges and avenues looped like pearls upon its bosom, its squares
and parks flashing like great golden brooches, its towers like
diamond pendants. In all directions delicate traceries of light led
like a phantasmagorical web into the efflorescent night. The Empire
of the Children of Darkness! Rufus scowled back at the image. The
left arm was extended downward, the hand pointing
earthward&mdash;toward the city. He followed the finger. Yes, it
was pointing toward the seething conflagration of Times Square. It
burned there beyond the housetops like a great sulphurous pit, and
the steam rising about it heightened the demoniac resemblance. "All
these things will I give thee, if-!"</p>

<p>Rufus struck the statue in the face with all his strength.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" he cried hysterically, half blinded by the
search-light.</p>

<p>Pieces of stone flew about him and one hit him on the cheek. A
second blow and the devil's jaw together with the dependent right
hand broke off and fell, leaving only the upper portion of the face
still attached to the overarching wings, its eyebrows curved in
fatuous astonishment. Against the screen of the sky the
search-light played for a second or two upon the figure of a stout
man frenziedly attacking a statue with an axe, then swept on. But
Rufus continued to belabor the statue in the darkness until it was
but a shapeless mass, resembling a snow-image after a February
thaw.</p>

<p>He descended in the elevator badly winded and reeking with sweat
to the door of his wife's room and knocked. He had not entered it
for months. Elizabeth in her chemise before her dressing-table was
brushing her hair. T hinking his knock to be that of her maid, she
answered "Come in." Each looked grotesque to the other.</p>

<p>"Why, Rufus!" she exclaimed. "What on earth have you been doing
with that hatchet! Is anything the matter?"</p>

<p>Rufus gazed stupidly at the implement in his hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!" he replied vaguely.</p>

<p>"You've got blood on your cheek!" she insisted, becoming a
little frightened. "Don't keep anything from me!"</p>

<p>He laid the hatchet on the hearth.</p>

<p>"I was up poking around on the roof."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you needed an axe for that!"</p>

<p>He threw himself into a Louis-Quinze armchair upholstered in
light blue.</p>

<p>"Oh, I just took it along," he answered. "Look here, Elizabeth.
I've got something I want to tell you."</p>

<p>His wife, who had kept on with her hair while they had been
talking, gave it a final twist and sat down on the chaise
longue.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;" she began quickly.</p>

<p>"No, you don't know!" he retorted. "Nobody knows&mdash;that is
no one in the family except Diana&mdash;and I've only just told
her. I want you to be brave about it."</p>

<p>She had turned pale and stretched out her hand.</p>

<p>"I know more than you think! But why Sheila&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you seen Diana?" he interrupted.</p>

<p>"Not since lunch."</p>

<p>"Then you don't know&mdash;anything about this, at any rate! See
here, Elizabeth! It isn't anything so terrible. Nobody's dead or
anything like that. It's just that I've lost my position and a lot
of money besides."</p>

<p>Her expression did not change. She seemed curiously
preoccupied.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" she asked calmly.</p>

<p>"Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"How much money have you lost?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a million."</p>

<p>"Is that very much?"</p>

<p>He burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Some people would think so."</p>

<p>"Well," she said. "Of course I know it's a lot of money, but
you've got a great deal more than that, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. But we'll have to sell this house."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"I don't care so very much," she remarked in a detached way. "A
house isn't everything."</p>

<p>"You bet it isn't!" he agreed. "A house isn't worth anything
unless there's something inside of it to make it so."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry if you have lost your position!" she continued
sympathetically. "But of course you can easily get another&mdash;a
man of your reputation."</p>

<p>"But don't you really mind giving up the house?" he persisted.
"After all these years?"</p>

<p>"Why, no!" she answered. "We can find another house. I'm rather
tired of entertaining the same people over and over again. You
know, Rufus, I don't think the smart people go out nearly so much
as they used to&mdash;not nearly so much. And our girls have all
been introduced to society. I'm not sure I'd not just as leave have
an apartment&mdash;one of those new ones up on Park Avenue above
Sixtieth Street. Park is getting quite fashionable. Half my friends
are up there. It would be very convenient for my bridge."</p>

<p>Rufus felt a pang of contrition which, in his over-emotional
condition, was enough to make his eyes water. After all, she was a
good sport&mdash;this old wife of his! No need to worry about her
having courage! The mother of his children, she had been loyal to
him for a quarter of a century! What had she got out of it except
bridge? He'd hardly paid any attention to her existence at all! A
pretty rough deal she'd had! And when he came right down to it, she
was the nearest human being to him in the world. Whatever she was,
she was his! And he was hers! They had no one else. He experienced
a profound pity for both of them&mdash;himself and her. Something
trembled inside his jowls. Poor old Liz!</p>

<p>He got up awkwardly, went over to where she sat and put his arm
around her.</p>

<p>"Lizzie," he said, "I'm sorry if I've not been all I should be
to you. I'm afraid I haven't been much of a husband, my dear."</p>

<p>Her face quivered. He had not spoken to her like that for
years.</p>

<p>"Why, Rufus!" she assured him. "You've been a perfectly
wonderful husband! No two people could possibly have been
happier."</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! That's so!" he said hastily, staggered by her reply.
He kissed her on the cheek.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rufus!" she exclaimed, blushing faintly. "Poor dear! You're
all covered with dust! Why don't you go and take a nice hot bath
before dinner?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter 27. "More Matter for a May
Morning"</h2>

<p>Rufus decided not to tell his father about the house that
evening lest it prevent his getting a proper night's sleep. The
morning would do exactly as well. For the same reason Mrs. Kayne
forbore to tell her husband what was on her mind&mdash;the
insufficiently explained departure of Sheila.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the old pirate got little sleep that night. The
great event to take place upon the morrow would have kept him awake
anyway. For how can an old gentleman of eighty-one who is giving a
May-party be expected to sleep the night before? Particularly if it
is his first? And this was to be a grand affair. With a
recrudescence of his old powers of organization the pirate had
conceived the idea of amalgamating all the different individual and
separate parties that occur in Central Park upon May Day into one
great, glorious, harmonious festival and frolic, in which he and
Uncle Billy should participate as managers, directors, and patron
saints. Sitting with their pipes in the Ramble, the two old fellows
for days had studied the scheme with care from every angle until no
item, physical or psychological, had been overlooked.</p>

<p>Only one objection had presented itself&mdash;the fact that
whereas each May-party usually had its own queen, their proposed
amalgamation or May-party trust would afford opportunity for but
one. They solved it by deciding to have no single official queen,
but to let all the queens assemble together under the May-pole and
officiate there in a body. Again they had observed that much
unhappiness arose out of the inequality in the character and
quantity of the lunches which the children ordinarily brought.
Antonio Spaloni might proudly appear with a dozen half-ripe
bananas, and Hans Fursen with a beautiful piece of cheese, but
inevitably each wanted what the other had brought, and what is the
"valuta" between bananas and cheese? Therefore, the pirate decided
that he would furnish a regular lunch for all of them&mdash;two
thousand sandwiches, two thousand pieces of cake, thirty gallons of
milk, a wagon-load of ice-cream, etc., and, what was much more
important, the pony-carts and donkeys would run free up and down
the Mall all day and every child might have at least one ride and
perhaps another if there was time. In addition, there would be a
Scotch piper with his bags as well as an artist upon the accordion,
a Punch and Judy show, a marionette theatre and a
conjurer&mdash;and prizes for the prettiest decorations.</p>

<p>Some of it, to be sure, was wholly in violation of the rules
laid down by the Park Commission against the introduction of
"pedlers, beggars, and musicians," or the "setting up of tents,
booths, or other structures for the giving of plays or games," but
any policeman in the Park would have sacrificed his job rather than
interfere. Indeed, it is to be suspected that the commissioner knew
a great deal more about what was going to happen than his
associates suspected. Anyhow, everybody else did. Not a child on
the east side of Third Avenue but knew weeks in advance that "Uncle
Peter" and "Uncle Billy" were going to have a May-party to which
all the world was invited&mdash;irrespective of race, color, or
previous condition of servitude.</p>

<p>They sat excitedly discussing every detail until long after
midnight. Would the Punch and Judy man surely be over from
Brooklyn? Hadn't they better order the ice-cream wagon a half-hour
earlier so as to be sure it would be there on time? Suppose it
rained? Suppose it rained only a little? There must be a special
man to look after the children who wanted donkey-rides! How about
those cocoanut-cakes? Was five hundred enough? Where was "Accordion
Jo" to meet them?</p>

<p>The pirate had asked constantly the last day or two for Sheila,
for he naturally wished her to be at his party; but to his intense
disappointment he was informed that she had gone away on a visit
and was not expected back in time to participate in the festivity.
This tinged his preparations with sadness. It was not enough that
Claudia with little Peter and Bess would be there. Sheila ought not
to have gone away without telling him! He had come to rely upon her
companionship more and more, particularly as he was beginning to be
conscious of a certain lack of elasticity in his old bones. He
didn't have the "go-at-ive-ness" he used to, he told her. Sheila
had enough "go-at-ive-ness" for an army. No! Sheila should have
told him that she was going away. It cast a shadow!</p>

<p>He was up with the first streak of daylight, pottering around
and boiling water for the coffee. Uncle Billy, more lethargic, was
still asleep when Peter B. waked him at six-thirty for
breakfast&mdash;toast, marmalade, scrambled eggs and bacon, and
strawberries out of the ice-box. The old man was much excited, and
had already tired himself with his worrying, and Billy made him sit
down and smoke for an hour after they had put away the breakfast
things.</p>

<p>"Sheila'd ought to be here!" Peter B. kept saying over and
over.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe she'll turn up in time!" Billy would encourage
him.</p>

<p>But the pirate would shake his great white mane and repeat
resignedly:</p>

<p>"She oughtn't to have gone! 'Twarn't right for her to go without
tellin' me!"</p>

<p>By eight o'clock the two old codgers were ready, each with a
Panama, a frisky pocket handkerchief, and a bamboo cane&mdash;two
"Champagne Charlies," as the pirate, brightening for a moment,
said. The fact that it was a fine day and the thought of all the
gladness it was going to bring to the little children partly
compensated for Sheila's absence. Anyhow, it was his fault, he
should have told her about it sooner. Too bad she was going to miss
seeing their enjoyment. However&mdash;! But there was an ache in
his heart.</p>

<p>The asphalt of the street was still wet as they came down the
brownstone steps, for the sun had not yet risen high enough to dry
it, and the air was cool and sweet. William, the second man, put
them on the bus, smiling after the "pair of jolly old geezers." He
liked old men. Made him think of his old gaffer back home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rufus, exhausted after his nervous explosion of the
night before, slept profoundly.</p>

<p>He did not awaken until after ten o'clock, and by the time he
had breakfasted, bathed, and dressed it was nearly eleven. He had
made up his mind that he would not go down-town that morning until
he had broken the news to the pirate. It was going to be a hard
job, but it had to be done; and until it was done his mind could
not be free. But when he arrived up-stairs braced to carry out his
purpose, the apartment on the top floor was vacant&mdash;the two
old men had already long since gone out.</p>

<p>From the second man Rufus learned that his father had gone with
Uncle Billy to the Park, and forthwith started in pursuit of him.
It would really be easier to talk to him there, anyway, he thought,
out in the open air. Not so much like saying: "You've got to get
out of this! The house&mdash;understand?" Much better! He had
nothing to attend to in the way of business until after lunch, and
Maitland was always there at the trust company. He decided to walk
up to the Park. It would do him good, he was feeling
lackadaisical&mdash;as if he needed exercise. His right arm, too,
was strangely stiff. Afterward he could take the B. R. T. down to
the office from Sixtieth Street and Fifth Avenue. So, receiving his
straw hat and gray suede gloves from the valet, Kayne stepped forth
from his house, a different man, both from the Utopia Trust Rufus
that he had been six months ago and the Remsen Street Rufus of a
half-century before.</p>

<p>He crossed to the shade of the opposite side of the Avenue,
where there still lingered a cool dampness, before turning
northward. There was no cloud anywhere. There had been a
water-color in the Remsen Street house of a scene on the Ponte
Vecchio&mdash;full of blues and brownish reds, and he recalled it
vividly, not quite sure why he did so.</p>

<p>He had imagined that he could easily find his father, supposing
that there would be comparatively few people in the Park in the
morning. The old gentleman was usually hanging around the upper end
of the Mall. But as he neared Fifty-ninth Street he noticed that
the traffic was being held up to permit a procession of little
children dressed all in white to cross the Avenue. May Day! The
Park would be jammed with children. Why hadn't he thought of it? He
would never be able to find the old man!</p>

<p>At the head of the column four solemn young ladies of nine or
ten were holding an improvised canopy, decorated with flowers and
trailing garlands, over the head of a tiny girl just able to toddle
along under her huge golden pasteboard crown. Behind the canopy
shuffled a couple of hundred other infants, all crisply starched
and immaculately white, their eyes large with anticipation. The
sound of their little feet was like the never-ceasing lapping of
wavelets upon rocks. Although the children sought to keep in line,
the procession bobbed and bulged from side to side, undulating like
a white sea-serpent, and when a gap fell in the line those behind
came running up breathlessly. The processions came from all
directions. For the Pied Piper was calling them.</p>

<p>As Rufus stood debating what to do, he heard the word "Father!"
and looking up saw Claudia and the children sitting in one of the
waiting motors. She beckoned to him and he walked out into the
street and got in.</p>

<p>"Going to grandfather's May-party?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I didn't know he was giving a party," he replied as he tickled
little Peter under the collar. "Nobody told me anything about
it."</p>

<p>"He's been full of it for the last two days," she went on. "I
hope he won't exhaust himself! When he once gets going&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rufus smiled.</p>

<p>"He can do more than any of us! Where is the party?"</p>

<p>"Up by the Casino in that big open space."</p>

<p>The end of the wavering line of white had reached the opposite
sidewalk, and the traffic moved on again. The chauffeur swung round
the Sherman statue and into the Park. As far as Rufus could see the
greensward was covered with groups of white-clad children. Up
toward Seventy-second Street they were in such numbers that the
ground looked as if it were strewn with gigantic apple-blossoms.
The focus or apex of this congestion was a great pole wound with
red and white ribbons and decked with streaming garlands held in
the hands of scores of children who danced gaily around it. Already
Peter and Bess were clamoring to be set down to join in the
frolic.</p>

<p>"Where can your grandfather be?" exclaimed Rufus. "Suppose you
look after the children and let me try to find him?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur had drawn up close to a balloon hawker, and Rufus
lifted out the children and gave them some small change.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, "buy yourselves some balloons. Don't wait for
me, Claudia."</p>

<p>Beside the balloon man and the caterer's assistants there was no
man in sight other than Rufus himself. The acre or so of space
usually dedicated to picnics was one huge mass of white. Children
of every age sprawled and rolled on the grass, chased one another
with shouts of joy or sat busily eating. The crowd around the
May-pole was rivalled in density by another which struggled about a
muscular youth in a white cap and apron who, with a big wooden
spoon, was ladling out ice-cream from an immense can. The mothers
sat or lay seemingly blissfully contented, as their offspring
walked, ran, and fought over them. Over in the Mall the pony-wagons
swayed and creaked under their swarming loads, and the donkeys
stalked patiently and ceaselessly up and down carrying little girls
congealed with fearful happiness. Here and there groups of other
children were playing games or dancing in a ring. It would have
stirred a tougher heart than old Rufus's. All these children! Where
had they ever come from?</p>

<p>He strolled slowly across the turf toward the May-pole. From
beneath his feet rose to his nostrils the hot, moist smell of grass
and earth. How soft and springy it was! He bent his knees; then
lifted himself on the balls of his feet. He wasn't so old!
Something made him want to laugh. Everywhere about him the twigs
and boughs were covered with golden or reddish buds&mdash;here and
there thrusting forth tiny, fanlike green fingers. Over by the wall
the forsythia bloomed like a yellow bower and the Japanese quince
made scarlet patches among the rocks. There was a smell like that
of lilacs in the air. The ceaseless clatter of little tongues
mingled with the drone and skirl of bagpipes. The earth seemed to
yearn to reach up and draw down the dancing children to itself and
kiss them.</p>

<p>There were myriads of tiny insects jigging about, pigeons
flapped and strutted under one's feet, and in the elms of the Mall
swung starlings and blackbirds&mdash;life everywhere. The fecund
universe trembled and quivered to it, buzzed and hummed and
whistled to it, danced and laughed and shouted to it. The earth was
straining, bursting with it. The stale blood of the materialist
flowed faster, tingling. The ice was melting. Fifty-five? He
couldn't be fifty-five! He was no older than when he had married
Elizabeth. These were not his grandchildren! There was no such
thing as age. Look at his father! Eighty-one and spry as a
grasshopper. Where was his father?</p>

<p>Between where he stood and the May-pole the Punch and Judy and
the marionette theatre had been set up, each conducting a
continuous performance before an enthralled, gasping, and
ever-changing audience. Farther away, in the isolation of
superiority, the professor of legerdemain was busy squeezing
guinea-pigs out of minute noses and filling the air with
innumerable yards of parti-colored ribbon whisked from the mouths
and ears of the infantile spectators. The sandwich man had long
since been despoiled of all his wares. The cocoanut-cakes had
vanished, the milk-cans been drained of their last drops. But the
noise and hurly-burly kept on, the ground reverberated to the
thumping of feet&mdash;perpetual motion everywhere. One could feel
the life oozing up from the teeming ground and into the children.
It was a frenzy of vitality.</p>

<p>He wormed himself through the crowds of children toward the
May-pole, for his instinct told him that there in the very thick of
it he should find his father. Brought thus into closer proximity,
he noticed that many of the children had taken off their white
dresses and hung them upon the trees in order not to soil them. Not
a tree whose lower limbs did not blossom with this strange foliage.
After all, Sunday was coming, and a dress was a dress, even if one
was so small that to take it off left one comparatively naked.</p>

<p>Rufus, proceeding slowly to avoid accidents, at length reached
the outer edge of the crowd about the May-pole, in the centre of
which stood a dozen or more juvenile crowned heads gazing upon the
scene with royal condescension. There too was the piper in full
regalia playing frantically upon his pipes, and the instant he
paused for breath "Accordion Jo" took up the refrain, while the
circle of children danced and capered around them. Just inside the
ring, holding a small negro boy by one hand and a little Italian
girl by the other, stood old Peter, hatless and in his
shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>Tears rose to Rufus's eyes. To interrupt his father at such a
moment would be an unthinkable cruelty. There would be plenty of
time later on. That evening perhaps&mdash;or, if the old man were
tired, then to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>Claudia, with the two children had left the motor and gone over
to watch the Punch and Judy; Rufus got in and ordered the chauffeur
to take him to the subway. As they drove off he turned and looked
back across the swarm of children. Between him and the May-pole he
could see a motionless white spot that he knew was his father's
head.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter 28. The End of a
Chapter</h2>

<p>It was five o'clock and all the children had gone home. Some men
were taking down the May-pole and rolling up the streamers, and the
respective proprietors of the Punch and Judy and the miniature
theatre were dismantling them and reducing them to bundles of
boards which they tied up with rope. The ground was strewn with
pasteboard boxes, tom newspapers, crushed lily-cups, wrappings of
every sort&mdash;the débris of the party. Not a square yard but was
littered with paper, and the grass itself was tousled in every
direction from the erratic movements of the merrymakers. Where the
air had been alive with the tumult of voices, the wheezing of the
accordion, the whine of the bagpipes, and the raucous cries of Mr.
Punch&mdash;"Crack! That's the way to do it!"&mdash;now brooded a
startling silence&mdash;as if the conjurer, having swallowed his
final rabbit, had waved his wand and they had vanished like pixies
into the grass. Yet something of that intense, vibrant life seemed
yet to hover there, charging the air with unseen pulsations. The
pirate, sitting alone on a green bench, could still feel in his
ears the vibration, hear the pounding of hundreds of little feet.
He had been glad to sit down at last, although he did not feel
exactly tired. Rather, he did not seem to have much feeling at all.
Uncle Billy, mousing with his pipe around the remains of the
marionette theatre, thought the old man had gone to sleep&mdash;but
Uncle Billy was mistaken. Old Peter was not asleep, although he was
dreaming.</p>

<p>He sat erect and high&mdash;the Kaynes were all
long-barrelled&mdash;his thin old legs crossed, his lean brown
hands with their blue-black veins laid one athwart the other upon
his knee. Through the boughs of the plane-tree studded with
pea-green fronds of bursting buds above, the low sun dappled his
Zeus-like hair and beard with patches of whiter light. Beneath the
Panama his sunken eyes held a sad serenity, and in his pose there
was a certain mild majesty.</p>

<p>Old Peter was just a shade bewildered. There had been so many
children. So many! And they had darted about so quickly! They had
tired his eyes. But not him&mdash;only his eyes. He half closed
them. The air was sweet, surprisingly so&mdash;except for an
occasional whiff of camel from the hutch at Sixty-sixth
Street&mdash;and the fragrance that stole along the grass was more
redolent of blossoms than in the morning's stabbing heat. He took
several long breaths, in spite of a slight tightness in his chest.
Oh, it was good! Good! Good to breathe and mingle the air with
yourself&mdash;make it part of you, just as the earth was part of
you and you were part of the earth. His eyelids sank lower. He
wondered he did not feel more exhausted after such a long day. He
had got up at five o'clock&mdash;twelve hours!</p>

<p>But it had been worth it! A wonderful party I Twelve hours was
nothing! In the old days he had often worked longer than that with
pick and shovel. That had been worth doing too! Life had been good
to him. He had been very lucky&mdash;very happy. Everything had
been worth having. Even, he admitted with a self-conscious chuckle,
those wild days of the "Zarazota." It was all a part of life. He
had no consciousness of having done anybody any harm. In his heart
of hearts he did not really regret anything now. As for the men he
had smashed, whose fortunes he had wrecked&mdash;they could not
bear him any ill will. It was part of the game. "Win or lose." They
had taken their chance when they had pushed in their stacks of
chips. He had held the winning hand&mdash;that was all. A pretty
good bunch! Most of them dead now, anyway. He wondered at it a
little, feeling in himself no consciousness of age. No reason, he
thought, why he should not be good for years yet. He was going
strong at eighty-one. Even ninety was not so old. He recalled that
his great-uncle had ridden horseback at a hundred and one, and had
given it up then only because, as he said, it wasn't exactly
"seemly."</p>

<p>The sun, dropping ever lower, wrapped a blanket of warmth about
him. Yes, life was sweet at any age. It might be different if you
were left alone, but he had so much! So much to enjoy! So much to
be proud of! There never had been a better son, a finer man, than
Rufus! His boy! What a contrast to that other&mdash;the smug,
sanctimonious James! Rufus had shown 'em! Made a big man of
himself. Walked away with everything! Respected throughout the
land. Yes, sir! One of the leading financiers of the country. He
had known the boy would make good and he had!</p>

<p>He would never have built the house if he had not known that
Rufus would make good. The house! He remembered his first talk with
Howlett about it. He had never really liked Howlett. He was too
autocratic, too much of a swelled head, stuck on himself! "I want
you should build me the best house you know how&mdash;latest
type&mdash;solid&mdash;best material&mdash;something to last!" he
had told him. Well, he had got it. There was nothing finer in New
York&mdash;and it would last, too! Long, long after he was
gone&mdash;it would still be there. No one could want anything
better. When little Peter was an old man&mdash;living maybe up on
the top story just as he was now&mdash;his children's children
would be going in and out, running up and down the stairs, and the
megaphone men on the rubber-neck coaches would wave at it and say:
"On your right is the magnificent residence of Peter Hargeth Kayne,
the well-known banker, built in 1885 at a cost of a million
dollars." His house! His family!</p>

<p>You'd travel a long way to find three girls like those
granddaughters of his! He'd seen plenty of pretty women but never
one to touch Diana! A beauty&mdash;yet a Kayne every inch of her.
Just like his mother with her red hair and those slanting Chinese
eyes and broad high cheek-bones. Funny how it cropped out in just
one like that and skipped the rest! And Claudia&mdash;she took
after the other, the Hargeth side&mdash;another lovely one. Poor
girl&mdash;but with such wonderful children. What fun Peter and
Bess had had! He could hardly get them away from the Punch and
Judy. And Sheila! The dearest of all! Why hadn't she been there to
share his happiness? But it wasn't her fault! Not her fault! He'd
tell her about it that evening.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes for a moment the better to savor it all. Yes,
he had had a good life&mdash;a fine, full life&mdash;and not over
yet by any maimer of means. Diana and Sheila would both be getting
married presently&mdash;he'd have to see that they made no such
mistake as Claudia. Peter and Bess&mdash;fifteen years or so more,
and they would be getting married, too. And there would be other
greatgrandchildren coming along! Great great-grandchildren! Plenty
to do! Plenty to be interested in. It kept broadening
out&mdash;broadening out&mdash;like a river&mdash;that swept you
along&mdash;along&mdash;</p>

<p>The shadows from the Mall crept closer and closer&mdash;drawing
a coverlet of partial obscurity over the refuse of the picnic. A
robin ran toward him, struggled with an unseen worm, hesitated, and
ventured nearer still; and three sparrows, perched on the bough
above, seeing some crumbs on the bench beside him came fluttering
down. Old Peter watched them out of the corner of his eye. One
paused for a moment upon the toe of his congress shoe, and he felt
its weight.</p>

<p>The sparrows, seized with a sudden impulse, flew away; the robin
circled the bench and disappeared. Old Peter had been only half
conscious of them. They were there, to be sure; but so now were the
children who seemed to him to have come back. He could hear them
babbling all about him&mdash;babbling, babbling. He opened his eyes
a little wider. The evening breeze stirred the papers on the grass
and sent some of them flying. Yes, there the children
were&mdash;everywhere, all in white&mdash;all over the grass. He
was glad they had come back. He had been lonely without them. Now
it was all right. Their voices were getting louder all the
time&mdash;rising higher and higher, drowning out everything, like
the roar of waves. And throughout it all he seemed to hear the
skirl of bagpipes&mdash;above his head somewhere. The wind swayed
his whiskers gently to and fro. His eyes closed. Ladies passing by
in their landaulet saw the old man at a distance and supposed him
to be asleep. A gray squirrel&mdash;stultified with high
living&mdash;came loping across the turf to exact his daily tribute
of peanuts. He had seen this old man frequently. Leaping upon the
bench, the squirrel nosed the remaining crumbs, spumed them, and
then crept upon the pirate's extended arm.</p>

<p>Old Peter's eyes cracked again and, recognizing his visitor, his
mustaches moved in a slight smile. He had noticed him many times
before on account of his frayed, scraggy tail&mdash;bald like a
rat's at the end. The squirrel nipped his finger and ran down his
trouser leg to the ground.</p>

<p>It was distinctly cooler. The shadow had reached almost to the
bench. He could no longer hear the voices of the children, and he
perceived to his surprise that they had gone away again. Those
white things were only pieces of paper! But there was no doubt that
they had been there a moment ago. He had seen them distinctly.
Children were all like that&mdash;here one second and gone the
next! Sheila was just like that. His little Sheila&mdash;his "fairy
moonbeam." What a shame she could not have been there to see the
children! Where was she? Where had she gone? Why had she not told
him that she expected to be away? It was not like her. She was
always so thoughtful&mdash;so sweet! He began to worry. Suddenly he
became convinced that she was in danger. The children had come back
again and the sound of their voices was like the shouting of the
sea. They were pushing dose about him, stretching out their
hands&mdash;fear on their faces&mdash;and they were all in
danger&mdash;terrible danger&mdash;and as he stared at them he saw
that each one was Sheila&mdash;a thousand Sheilas&mdash;and each
one dearer to him than anything else on earth. And above the roar
of the sea which now poured all about him he could hear the skirl
of the bagpipes&mdash;"The Campbells Are Coming&mdash;The Campbells
Are Coming"&mdash;and then the sun set&mdash;suddenly&mdash;and
darkness.</p>

<p>"Gently! Hold him like that!" he heard some one saying, and he
opened one eye. It was still bright daylight. The sun had come
back. There was a group of people about him and he recognized Rufus
and Uncle Billy. What were they worrying about? He tried to smile
but he could not move his face. It seemed stiff&mdash;cramped. He
tried to get up but his left arm and leg refused to budge. There
was something the matter with his tongue. It made him angry. He
wanted to tell them about Sheila. What were they waiting for? Why
were all those motors stopping just there, with their staring
occupants? His brain ordered his defiant muscles to wave them on,
without result. Why did they not move on? They were very impolite.
From the distant avenue came a faint clanging which grew louder and
then louder. Then some one hit the gong a Vicious penultimate
stroke right beside him. He was furious at his own futility. And
then&mdash;crowning insult!&mdash;he felt the bench with himself
upon it being lifted in air and carried toward the motors.</p>

<p>He remembered little of his trip home, or of how he got up the
front steps of the house and into his bed. But his sense of relief
at being once more surrounded by his own personal effects was
great. It was such a comfort to feel that he was back home&mdash;in
his own house&mdash;with his family. Everybody was
there&mdash;Rufus, Elizabeth, Billy, Diana, Claudia, even that fool
James&mdash;everybody except Sheila. He endeavored to communicate
to them the important fact that she was in danger, but his mouth
gave forth only a succession of meaningless sounds. Disgusted he
gave up trying. Then a long time passed during which&mdash;so far
as he was aware&mdash;nothing happened at all.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>Chapter 29. The Butterfly
Club</h2>

<p>It is probable that both Elizabeth and Diana would have been
more dismayed by Rufus's disclosure of his misfortunes had not
their minds been distracted by Sheila's mysterious departure, of
which they had first learned when Diana, returning home the
previous afternoon, had found a pencilled note in her sister's
handwriting telling her that she was going down to spend a few days
at Doctor Dhal's Butterfly Club. This discovery coming so shortly
after Diana's talk with Sheila and She latter's expressed
willingness to abandon Dhal and all his works was to that extent
the more appalling. That, as Sheila had said in her note, Lulie
Wingate, Rita Ricardo, Oscar Florian, and others equally
conspicuous were also down there did not assuage her anxiety. Diana
had formed an intense distaste for Mr. Oscar Florian ever since he
had appeared at the last artist's festival dad in a lion skin and
with his legs gilded.</p>

<p>She had given up her own studio long ago, finding no attraction
in subdued lights, low music, incense, decadent French verse,
vermilion decorations, or the mysteries of Mahadeva. Florian and
his associates were almost as antipathetic to her as Dhal himself.
Rita Ricardo kept snakes and, indeed, there was, to Diana,
something reptilian about all of therm This made her the more ready
to believe all the implications in what Maitland had repeated to
her about Dhal. But that there was something unwholesome or worse
about Doctor Dhal she had not needed Maitland to tell her.</p>

<p>She had communicated his information at once to Sheila, who had
at first ridiculed it. The child had never, she assured Diana, felt
half so well as since she had been taking the exercises at his
sanitarium. They were perfectly simple&mdash;deep breathing, fresh
air, a mild diet. Doctor Dhal himself was never there and the
instruction was given entirely by young women. If it benefited her,
what difference did it make whether it was called "Yogi" or
anything else?</p>

<p>When Diana endeavored to explain, Sheila became indignant. She
did not know what Diana was talking about. What she said was all
nonsense! Why didn't she go around there and find out for herself,
instead of listening to a lot of silly gossip which was utterly
false? It was horrid of Diana to suggest that there was anything
about the exercises that was in the slightest degree undesirable.
Diana assured her that she was quite satisfied that there was not.
She could not understand the intense feeling of resentment which
she seemed to have aroused in Sheila. Finally the girl promised to
give it all up.</p>

<p>That had been six weeks before, and Diana had been lulled into a
specious sense of security by Sheila's apparent willingness to
yield to her sister's wishes. There was something ominous in the
fact that Sheila had lied to her&mdash;must deliberately have
broken her promise to her and have intended to do so all along.
Some subtle influence must have undermined her normal standards of
conduct. It was like finding that one's sister had been associating
with some one who had a contagious disease or had gone to stay in
an infected house. At least Sheila had had the decency to let them
know where she was. Could the child have gone back to drugs again?
But a search of Sheila's bureau and medicine-closet revealed
nothing to suggest a resumption of the habit, if it could be called
such. And her appearance for the last three months belied any such
suggestion. Lying in a corner, where evidently Sheila had dropped
and overlooked it, Diana found a curious cone-shaped object. It was
round at the base and about five inches in diameter, made of brass
wire twisted into a spiral and terminating in a crudely fashioned
serpent's head. She recalled with a shudder having seen a similar
object worn by a dancing-girl. Something far more dangerous and
terrible was hanging over Sheila, gradually overpowering her
senses&mdash;physical and moral&mdash;as with an anaesthetic. It
was like death lurking in a flower, death borne on a sunlit breeze,
death dancing to a joyous tune upon the grass, death in the kiss of
a laughing child. What was inside this whited sepulchre into which
Sheila had vanished?</p>

<p>Diana had telephoned Lloyd at once, but had found him neither at
his office nor his rooms. It was in fact the moment when he had
been on his way to the Kayne house with Rufus's will, which he was
eventually to take away with him undelivered after seeing the
tableau of Devereaux and Diana in the window. That telltale
silhouette, following on the very heels of his talk with Rufus that
afternoon, had confirmed his worst suspicions. Theretofore he had
often lain awake at night tortured by the possibility of what he
now accepted as a fact. There was no mistaking the abandon with
which Diana had thrown herself into her lover's arms&mdash;no
longer room for doubt that he was her lover. Devereaux wasn't "out
of it"&mdash;after all. Why should he be? Let him pay for her! He
had the money!</p>

<p>And yet for some perverse reason Lloyd knew that he loved her
none the less himself&mdash;loved and hated her at the same
time&mdash;refusing to face that which his reason told him must be
the truth. Was instinct&mdash;the wider spiritual knowledge of his
subconscious self&mdash;teaching him to question reason? Or was the
great wave of his passion lifting him off his feet and carrying him
bodily toward the rocks? A change had come over him. So far as this
woman was concerned he would now have thrown conscience to the
winds&mdash;while surrendering no other jot of his integrity. This
emotion that now possessed him&mdash;this lust of Satan or thirst
of the soul, whichever it may have been&mdash;had overcome his
will, and had even bred a certain ruthlessness toward its object.
He would bide his time. Perhaps she would tire of Devereaux.
Then--?</p>

<p>But he was in no conciliatory mood when next morning Diana
called him on the telephone, told him the news regarding Sheila,
and asked for his advice. What did she take him for? he asked
himself. Did she imagine that she could fool him about her
relations with Devereaux and, while keeping him in suspense, use
him to the limit? Rather gruffly he told her that she had better go
to Jamaica, where the Butterfly Club was situated, and see if she
couldn't persuade the child to return home with her. If she was
unsuccessful, he'd see what could be done next. She could call him
up again. Why, he demanded peremptorily, hadn't she kept track of
what Sheila was doing? At least, enough to know whether or not she
had been faithful to her promise? Diana could make no defense.
There was none to make.</p>

<p>"Don't be cross with me!" she had begged.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he had answered brusquely. "I've a right to be! I'm
furious with you!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I need you, Lloyd!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;!" he answered, slightly mollified. Then, in a
sudden rush of sympathy for her, all his coldness melted away. "O,
what's the use! I'm sorry I spoke that way. You know I didn't mean
it!&mdash;I'll always be there when you want me&mdash;Diana!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lloyd! Thank you! I know it!"</p>

<p>It had been too late to do anything that evening, and,
accordingly, it was not until the next morning&mdash;that of
May-Day&mdash;that Diana, shortly before her father had left the
house for Central Park, started for Long Island. She drove herself,
taking no chauffeur, and the exhilaration induced by the glory of
the spring, and her swift flight through the soft green
countryside, gradually allayed her fears. In this gorgeous,
dazzling world of crystalline blue, of budding hillsides white with
apple-blossom and dogwood, of fragrant air, of birds and flowers
and sparkling sea, there could be no hidden menace! No wonder
Sheila had wished to be in the country at such a moment.</p>

<p>She had looked up her route in the road-book before starting
and, at a wooded corner by a duck-pond, left the turnpike for a
sandy road leading toward the water. For a mile or so she traversed
open fields, black and oozing with the rain of the afternoon
before, then crossed a barren area sparsely covered with scrub-oak,
and at length came unexpectedly upon a high brick wall surmounted
by iron palings. Beside this wall the road ran for a hundred yards
or more before plunging down a hill toward the Sound. Midway was a
heavy door painted green with a small barred opening or peep-hole
closed from within by a slide. On one side was an ordinary
push-button marked "RING." There was no name or mark on the door
save a "<i>swastika</i>" on the lintel above.</p>

<p>This was enough of a cue, and Diana, having parked her car on
the other side of the road, pressed the bell, which after some
delay was answered by a negro servant.</p>

<p>Through the door Diana could see an extensive lawn where a
number of persons were playing tennis, basketball, battledore and
shuttlecock, ringtoss and throwing a medicine-ball. The negro, on
learning her errand, conducted her up the path toward a large
yellow house with several additions and many windows. In a grove of
trees farther up the hill behind the house were a number of
bright-colored bungalows. Several women were walking about the
piazzas in pink, blue, and purple kimonos. From inside came the
insistent whine of a gramophone. The sunlight falling through the
upstairs windows seemed to reflect as many different colors as
there were in the kimonos, and Diana now observed that all the
athletes had on black tights, over which they threw the wrappers
when they were done playing. A pleasant-faced young woman dressed
in a sort of bathing-suit de luxe came forward, shook hands with
the visitor, and led her into a small, bare reception-room.</p>

<p>"I will try to find Miss Kayne for you," she said civilly. "She
may be at one of the lectures. If not, she may have gone out
walking."</p>

<p>A few moments later Sheila herself came in dressed in the street
costume which she had worn when she had left New York.</p>

<p>"What have you followed me down here for?" she asked coldly,
suffering Diana's kiss.</p>

<p>"To take you home."</p>

<p>"I'm not going home!" answered Sheila, moving toward the door by
which she had entered.</p>

<p>Diana became angry.</p>

<p>"You promised me to give up all this!" she protested
sharply.</p>

<p>Sheila's face remained expressionless. She did not reply.</p>

<p>"Mother is frightfully upset about your going away without
saying anything to her. It was very inconsiderate of
you&mdash;heartless, in fact. Please get your things and come at
once. I have the motor outside."</p>

<p>Sheila shook her head. There was a look in her eyes that
frightened Diana.</p>

<p>"I insist!"</p>

<p>Sheila tittered. The sound was harsh, uncanny. It drove
everything from Diana's mind that she had purposed using as an
argument with her sister, including their father's financial
embarrassment, the loss of his position, the necessity of
retrenchment.</p>

<p>"You've lied to me!" she cried furiously. "What has come over
you! Have you gone back to taking drugs?"</p>

<p>Sheila's face, hitherto merely scornful and antagonistic,
hardened. Turning her back upon her sister, she walked haughtily
through the doorway.</p>

<p>"Sheila!" cried Diana, hurrying after her. "Sheila&mdash;dear!
Oh, Sheila! Please come back!" But the child had vanished.</p>

<p>Diana, turning into the adjacent corridor, came face to face
with Oscar Florian, arrayed in white trousers and sleeveless purple
jersey. He exhaled an odor of <i>quelques fleurs</i>. There was something
about the chubbiness of his chin, with its little pointed beard,
and the whiteness of his arms that seemed positively indecent. To
Diana he was more repulsive than ever.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he cried gaily, holding out a soft white hand with shiny
nails. "Are we to have the pleasure of welcoming you to our circle?
I understand your sister is here."</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said Diana rigidly. "Can you tell me if Doctor
Dhal is in? I am anxious to see him."</p>

<p>Florian smiled as if something amused him and withdrew his
hand.</p>

<p>"I will see," he answered with his old insolence. "Excuse my
dishabille!"</p>

<p>Diana returned to the waiting-room and stood looking out of the
window. What was behind all this? A terrible dread lest Sheila
should be already lost possessed her. Her tension increased as the
minutes passed. Unexpectedly a thick, oily voice close behind her
said:</p>

<p>"Dear lady, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>She had heard no one enter and the shock of hearing that sudden
voice drove the blood from her face. She shrank back; then,
overcoming her sensation of horror and disgust, faced about. Doctor
Dhal was standing there in a gown of blue crash, a red sash about
his waist, a bland smile upon his pasty face, his short arms
dangling at his sides. Underneath one of them was tucked a
red-covered book.</p>

<p>"Please tell my sister to come home with me!" she besought
him.</p>

<p>"Does she not desire to remain?" he asked in apparent
surprise.</p>

<p>"Her father and mother don't want her to stay. They didn't know
that she was coming. They wish her to return at once," she
said.</p>

<p>Dhal bowed.</p>

<p>"Dear lady, I will speak to her. She will, of course, go if she
wishes. No one ever stays here unwillingly. All are as free as the
air."</p>

<p>He spoke with such sincerity that Diana's feeling of repugnance
was somewhat weakened. Superficially, at least, the man was a
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Will you not sit down?" he asked. He placed a chair for her and
she sank into it. Coinddently Doctor Dhal slid into another. He was
looking into her eyes now&mdash;his glance never leaving them for
an instant. She had been foolish to be afraid of this man!</p>

<p>"Are you sure your father and mother are correctly informed
about what we teach here?" he asked in a kindly tone. "We are
seeking only perfect health&mdash;'mens sana in corpore
sano'&mdash;self-realization, perfect and harmonious development of
body, mind, and soul. I should be glad to show you over our plant.
It is the quintessence of democracy. Or to have your father and
mother visit it. Before taking away your sister, would it not be
well to do so? Our doctrines take a very firm hold upon those who
study them. Much harm can be done by interruption.
Sheila&mdash;"</p>

<p>The f amili ar use of her sister's Christian name by this
stranger released Diana's will from any momentary ascendancy which
his personality might have achieved over it. To hear those sensual
lips uttering the word "Sheila" revived all her original
loathing.</p>

<p>"I wish to take my sister away with me&mdash;now!" she answered
definitely.</p>

<p>The sweetness of Doctor Dhal's smile faded, but his urbanity did
not.</p>

<p>"Very well!" he answered with a bow. "Doubtless you have
sufficient reasons. But it is a pity not to let her stay. She is
very ductile! She is making great progress&mdash;and it is possible
that she may not wish to go."</p>

<p>Doctor Dhal appeared to dissolve in a bluish mist and to be
sucked through the doorway as by a draft. Diana found herself alone
again. The atmospheric pressure in the room had lightened; it
seemed cooler, drier. She felt, after her two interviews, nervous,
verging on tears. The Swami did not come back, but at the end of a
quarter of an hour the young lady in the bathing-suit beamed in
once more.</p>

<p>"Doctor Dhal wishes me to tell you that he has spoken to your
sister and that she is unwilling to return to the city. Of course
he has no way to make her do so."</p>

<p>The room had become overwhelmingly hot again. Millions of motes
floating in the sunlight seemed to obscure Diana's vision. She
arose feeling faint. From the other side of the corridor came the
rasping of somebody's famous ragtime orchestra accompanying a
hoarse vibrant voice upon the gramophone&mdash;"All I want is a
little bit of love! A little bit of love from you!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>Chapter 30. "Vi et Armis!"</h2>

<p>On the elaborate dais of an ornate court-room five middle-aged
gentlemen in black bombazine gowns sprawled in postures indicating
respectively indifference, irritation, resentment, scorn, and coma.
The one who would later write their joint opinion was listening,
one&mdash;the last&mdash;was sleeping, one was wondering where the
devil he could find an apartment for his mother, who insisted on
moving to New York, and two were dreaming of the Garden City
golf-course. In front of them stood a tall young man with a bald
head.</p>

<p>"And so, as Your Honors will observe," he remarked, sweeping the
half-circle for a possible gleam of response and then fixing his
eye bumingly upon the only one of his auditors who appeared in any
way conscious of his presence, "as Your Honors cannot fail to have
observed the analogy between <i>res adjudicata</i> and <i>stare decisis</i>
sought to be drawn by my learned opponent, and upon which he
has&mdash;er&mdash;permitted himself to become so
eloquent&mdash;utterly falls to the ground. I submit unhesitatingly
that the order should be affirmed." He bowed, picked up his papers
from the table before him and returned to his chair.</p>

<p>The eyes of the listening judge followed him, unblinking as an
alligator's. The judge in the centre came back from Garden City
and, looking around the room vaguely, murmured: "Respondent?"</p>

<p>Maitland had been sitting in this luxurious legal conservatory
since one o'clock waiting for his case to be reached, for it had
been too late to secure an adjournment from the opposing counsel
when Diana had telephoned. Through the drone of the arguments he
had heard only her voice as it had come over the wire. "I need you!
I need you!" She was waiting for him now in one of the rear rows of
spectators, her car outside. There had been only a moment's
opportunity to shake hands and assure her that at the earliest
possible instant he would be with her. "<i>Res adjudicata!&mdash;Stare
decisis!</i>" What were they when a human soul was fluttering nearer
and nearer to the darting tongue of that moral python?</p>

<p>"Crutchfield &amp; Pepperill?&mdash;Mr. Maitland?"</p>

<p>He heard the name and mechanically arose and made his way
forward. As if his astral body were concealed somewhere behind a
cornice, he could see himself bowing and hear his voice saying in
the monotonous, slightly bored tone that it was the fashion to
affect:</p>

<p>"If the Court please, I have listened to my learned adversary's
argument with the closest attention and I am utterly at a loss to
understand his inability to grasp what is the fundamental principle
of law in this state. Ever since Beadleston versus Boyle in the
Eighty-first New York&mdash;which, as you all remember, was later
approved in McGillicuddy versus Pettybone, ex rel.
Swackhammer,&mdash;the law has been definitely settled. What my
learned friend calls an analogy with <i>stare decisis IS stare
decisis</i>."</p>

<p>The postures behind the dais had not altered. The listening
judge leaned back his head and looked up at the chandelier as if in
search of a possible "<i>stare decisis</i>" roosting among its
candelabra. The apartment-hunting judge sank into even lower depths
of gloom. There were no apartments to be had in New York! What a
waste of time, thought Maitland! Nobody was paying any attention to
him&mdash;nobody was listening to him. A matter of form. Eventually
they would glance over the briefs, hear a few words from the judge
selected to write the opinion, and "concur." If that learned
gentleman had had a lucky turn in the stock-market he might take
one view, or if he had had too many cocktails the night before he
might take another. But whatever view he took they would most of
them "concur" just the same, because that was the obvious thing to
do. And so was made the law&mdash;and out of the law grew morals,
and standards and ideals for which men died. <i>Res adjudicata</i>!
Things that had been <i>settled</i>. But by whom? What did this
loyalty to the past amount to? The crimes of to-day were the
virtues of to-morrow. A miscount in a ballot-box might mean a
radically different moral code!</p>

<p>"Therefore," he heard himself declaim with a dying fall, "while
the dictum in Peapack versus Twelvetrees may show a momentary
vacillation in the minds of the Court of Appeals as then
constituted, the opinion in McGillicuddy ex rel. Swackhammer
remains the law of the state."</p>

<p>He bowed&mdash;five swivel chairs squeaked in a common relief, a
distinguished-looking man, much more like a judge than any of the
others, but who was only a clerk, arose and murmured: "Hear ye!
Hear ye! This court stands adjourned until to-morrow at one
o'clock!"&mdash;the assembled lawyers got up with an assumption of
leisure and drifted slowly out conversing in low tones.</p>

<p>Lloyd gathered up his papers and followed. The pantomime was
over; the masks thrown aside; the judges were golfers again; the
lawyers men! Instead of a lot of stuffed puppets talking a queer
sort of gibberish, they had all become live people, breathing the
fresh air of reality, not the dust-laden atmosphere of an
artificial past.</p>

<p>Another moment and Diana and he were in the car, entangled in
the traffic of Fourth Avenue, but with as yet no opportunity to
relax the nervous tension induced in both of them by their
suppressed excitement and the long delay. The face of the girl
beside him was set; her eyes tortured; but she nevertheless drove
with control. The great arms of the Queensboro Bridge spanned the
twisting, uncoiling river with festoons of palely glowing lights.
Ahead over the smoke of Long Island a snow-capped Bernese Oberland
reared itself rose-pink in the afterglow. It faded to mauve, to
gray, then disappeared. An interminable procession of red lights
fled before them.</p>

<p>Neither spoke. She was longing to pour out her heart to him, to
abase herself to him, to paint her dread of the invisible menace
that threatened her sister. Once over the bridge she began to speak
in detached, jerky sentences. Crouched at the wheel, her eyes fixed
on the road, she recounted her experiences of the morning, sparing
herself neither with regard to her neglect of Sheila in the past
nor the stupidity of her last approach. She had, she admitted, been
a prize fool all along. She held nothing back from him. Her
unrestrained selfrecrimination had almost the savor of a
confession. He had never seen her like that. All her
confidence&mdash;the pretty arrogance she used with Devereaux,
Longwood, and their friends&mdash;had fallen from her. It was clear
that she wanted him to know her exactly as she was.</p>

<p>Her helplessness, her dependency, touched him. That she had
called upon him in this way instead of upon Devereaux puzzled yet
gratified him. He ceased to resent being made use of. Instead, he
found himself oblivious of the purpose of their errand or the
danger hanging over Sheila, to everything save that he was by her
side. He exulted in the consciousness of her reliance upon him. Up
to this time she had always seemed to him to be stronger than
himself. It was an exquisite delight to feel that she needed
him&mdash;no one else, only him!</p>

<p>Holding his hat-rim with one hand, he watched her driving
through the night. Now and again his arm would touch hers, and once
he was thrown sharply against her and felt the warmth of her body.
What a contrast between this dash through the odoriferous darkness
and his afternoon in the stuffy court-room! He tingled with a
growing excitement. What were law or morals or anything else
compared with life? "One crowded hour&mdash;!" Was he going to let
it go for any fusty regard for traditional conventionalities
acquired Heaven knows how or where? From McGillicuddy ex rel.
Swackhammer and the like? He leaned toward her and he fancied that
her arm returned his pressure. A strange, wild
irresponsibility&mdash;utterly foreign to the calm, cool
Maitland&mdash;took possession of him. She was his! What did it
matter what she was, or had been, or done if he loved her? What did
anything matter if she could be made to love him? Life!</p>

<p>They swung off the main road and before long came upon the brick
wall.</p>

<p>"Here we are," she said abruptly. "It's up to you from now
on!"</p>

<p>"Then let's turn the motor," he answered, coming back to earth
again. "We may want to leave in a hurry."</p>

<p>She ran the car a few yards beyond the end of the wall, backed
it, and left it headed in the direction whence they had come.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she asked, as if whatever his reply
might be she would be entirely satisfied.</p>

<p>"I don't know!" he confessed. "But I'm going to do
something!"</p>

<p>The negro eyed them suspiciously through the wicket before
opening the door, but admitted them. Clearly Doctor Dhal relied on
forces more potent than prison-bars. Light poured from the windows
of the Butterfly Club, but the veranda was empty and so were the
adjacent corridors. A faint odor was noticeable. Was it
incense&mdash;or cabbage? The negro left them in the
reception-room, explaining that the members were at dinner.
Glancing about at the banal cottage furniture and the cheaply
finished woodwork, it struck the lawyer that the whole thing must
be a joke. What he had heard was simply incredible.</p>

<p>They were kept waiting what seemed an interminable time.
Maitland became first impatient, then irritated. He looked for a
bell, but there was none. At length from a distance came the sound
of chairs being moved, then of many footsteps. Dinner evidently was
over. At the end of the corridor an irregular procession of figures
began to pass. Maitland, who had no plan of campaign, found himself
at a loss. Suppose they were simply left kicking their heels just
where they were all the evening? He walked part way down the
corridor to see what was going on. A large hall hung with
brilliantly colored stuffs opened to the right. At one end was a
platform faced by rows of chairs. Twenty or thirty people were
already occupying them. Clearly some sort of evening entertainment
was toward. The incongruity of his presence&mdash;like that of a
gentleman burglar&mdash;slightly amused him. Florian&mdash;in a
scarlet dinner-jacket&mdash;obviously an effort at
self-expression&mdash;passed along talking to a young girl. Sheila!
Then Maitland became conscious of reality. The sight of the pursy
artist with his chubby chin and little pointed beard infuriated
him. He saw Florian lay his hand upon Sheila's shoulder; and could
see her as if by instinct draw away from him.</p>

<p>Maitland stepped boldly into the room.</p>

<p>"Miss Kayne!" he called.</p>

<p>Engrossed in what Florian was saying, she did not at first hear
him. But he was conscious that others in the room were gazing at
him in surprise.</p>

<p>"Miss Kayne!" he repeated, approaching her.</p>

<p>Sheila turned, and every vestige of color left her face.</p>

<p>"I have come to take you home," he said simply, without noticing
Florian.</p>

<p>Sheila put her hand to her breast.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;sent&mdash;you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nobody&mdash;I came," he replied. "I want you to come with
me."</p>

<p>Florian had not moved from where he had been standing. Sheila
looked first at him, then at Maitland.</p>

<p>"I can't, Mr. Maitland!" she said. "Really, I can't!"</p>

<p>"Why, of course you can!" he insisted. "Do you mean you are
afraid to leave?"</p>

<p>A troubled look crossed her face, into which the color was now
slowly returning.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Miss Kayne means that it would not be courteous to
Doctor Dhal to go away as you suggest," said Florian, looking at
her fixedly.</p>

<p>"Miss Kayne will speak for herself!" retorted Maitland. He
appealed to her once more. "May I have a. few words with you
alone&mdash;Sheila?"</p>

<p>At his use of her Christian name she lifted her face and he saw
that her eyes were wet.</p>

<p>"Come to the reception-room!" he said, taking her by the arm and
leading her toward the door. She followed willingly
enough&mdash;but rather as in a trance. Over his shoulder Maitland
could see Florian hurrying down the corridor in the direction of
the dining-room. How young the child seemed in contrast with the
other people in the bedlam lecture-hall, a majority of whom were
elderly or middle-aged women! They reached the reception-room and
Maitland pushed Sheila gently across the threshold in front of him,
closing the door as Diana took her sister in her arms.</p>

<p>"Forgive me!" she begged. "I was horrid to you this
morning!"</p>

<p>Sheila let Diana kiss her; then stepped back and threw a glance
of inquiry at Maitland.</p>

<p>"Did you two come together?"</p>

<p>"Naturally," he answered with a smile. "I couldn't take you back
to New York with me without a chaperon, could I? And, you see, you
really can't stay here, because your father is in trouble and needs
you all to stand by him. He would not understand it if you didn't
want to go."</p>

<p>"He never stood by <i>me!</i>" she retorted. "Neither he nor mama ever
took any real interest in me! Everything that makes life really
beautiful I've learned more from Doctor Dhal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doctor Dhal!" cried Diana fiercely. "That miserable sham!"</p>

<p>Sheila's eyes flashed and she clenched her fists.</p>

<p>"He is nothing of the kind! He is very wise and good." Her voice
became thin and high. "He is 'all good.' I will not hear you say
anything against my <i>guru</i>!"</p>

<p>She faced Maitland with clasped hands. "I will go with you if
you really want me to," she said. "I will go because you ask
me&mdash;for no other reason. I do not believe papa needs me at
all. That is just a trick to get me away. But I don't mind if <i>you</i>
ask me to go. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I do ask you!" Maitland assured her.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "I will come. But I must get my things.
They are in the little house in the grove. I shall only be gone a
minute."</p>

<p>She walked the few steps toward the door, but as she stretched
out her hand to turn the knob it opened disclosing Doctor Dhal upon
the threshold.</p>

<p>"What is this?" asked the Yogi.</p>

<p>"Miss Kayne has decided to return to New York with her sister,"
said Maitland sternly.</p>

<p>Doctor Dhal bowed.</p>

<p>"No one stays here against his will," he answered with a smile.
"All are free to come and go as they will. How is it, my
child&mdash;do you wish to leave your <i>guru</i>?"</p>

<p>He leaned toward her, looking into her eyes, still smiling, and
his wreathed lips murmured some word in a foreign tongue.</p>

<p>Sheila faltered, smiling faintly in return.</p>

<p>"You do not wish to leave your <i>guru</i>!" he said in a harsh
metallic tone quite different from his ordinary glutinous
utterance. "You do not wish to go! You will not go!"</p>

<p>"I do not wish to go!" repeated Sheila mechanically.</p>

<p>"You see, she says herself she does not wish to go," smiled Dhal
without taking his eyes from her face.</p>

<p>Maitland saw that he was losing ground.</p>

<p>"Sheila!" he said authoritatively, stepping between them. "I ask
you to come with me. You said you would do so if I asked you.
Come!"</p>

<p>He put his arm around her, and drawing her to him led her toward
the door where stood the Yogi. The smile did not leave Dhal's face,
although a gleam flashed for an instant in his black eyes. Maitland
could feel the malignity concealed beneath the saccharine curve of
those sensuous lips.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment!" said Doctor Dhal.</p>

<p>He raised one of his short dangling arms, barring their passage
with a pudgy open palm.</p>

<p>"Get out of the way!" ordered Maitland sharply.</p>

<p>"Sheila! Little one&mdash;" purred the Yogi, dropping his hand
to the child's shoulder.</p>

<p>With his full weight back of his fist Maitland drove for the
pulpy face just where the parted lips showed a glint of white. It
was a blow that would have felled a far tougher philosopher than
Doctor Dhal. The Yogi's head flew back, his knees gave way, and he
pitched forward to the floor, where he lay motionless, a bizarre
and grotesque figure, his arms flung wide like a gaudy doll.</p>

<p>Maitland had struck without full realization of his act or of
its possible consequences. But the satisfaction he derived from the
blow would have amply compensated him for a month in jail.</p>

<p>Sheila seized him convulsively by the arm and buried her face in
his shoulder. Diana and he stared at the body on the floor as if
they rather expected another Doctor Dhal to come floating sweetly
out of a corner with a "Here you should look!" But nothing of that
sort occurred. Apparently, if you hit him quick enough and hard
enough, you could dislocate Dhal's astral machinery.</p>

<p>The left foot in its crimson slipper twitched. An arm stirred; a
stertorous sigh came from the swollen mouth. The omnipotent one was
coming back from Nirvana or wherever he had been excursioning. From
the other end of the corridor could be heard the echo of
approaching voices. Maitland quickly snapped off the light in the
reception-room and dragged Sheila into the hall. Mr. Oscar
Florian's scarlet dinner-jacket flared close by. One of the women
in bathing-suits followed just behind him.</p>

<p>"Have you spoken with Doctor Dhal?" demanded the artist.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Diana. "I am taking my sister away."</p>

<p>Florian turned inquiringly to the young woman, who was evidently
puzzled.</p>

<p>"I am afraid there must be some misunderstanding," she
interposed, stepping forward. "Miss Kayne told me within less than
ten minutes that she expected to remain at the club for at least a
week."</p>

<p>"She can speak for herself," said Lloyd. "Are you coming with
me, Sheila?"</p>

<p>The girl raised her head, but at the sight of Florian and his
companion she turned away her face with a look of aversion.</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered.</p>

<p>Without further parley, Maitland and Diana hurried Sheila down
the hall to the veranda. As they stepped upon the gravel path the
lights in the reception-room burst forth again. They could hear the
frenzied ringing of an electric bell. Shadows, like huge bats,
darted to and fro past the windows. There were muffled shouts.</p>

<p>"Run!" directed Maitland. "Let's do a vanishing act
ourselves!"</p>

<p>There was a key in the door in the wall and Maitland removed it,
closed and locked the door behind them on the outside, and tossed
the key into the bushes.</p>

<p>"And that's that!" he remarked. "Don't throw on your lights
until we get farther down the road."</p>

<p>Next instant they had glided off into the darkness, Diana at the
wheel, Sheila and Lloyd upon the back seat. She was trembling, and
after putting his coat over her shoulders he kept his arm about
her. But she soon became calm and by the time they reached the
highroad she was in her usual spirits. She would not permit Lloyd
to remove his arm, however; it was more comfortable, she said.</p>

<p>The prosaic red and white lights in the drug-store windows at
Flushing gave them all a sense of comfort. It was quite natural to
Sheila to let her head rest on Lloyd's shoulder, as she so often
had in her dreams, and to find herself answering all his questions
so unreservedly. Now that the Butterfly Club was miles behind them,
her visit there seemed to have a curious quality of
unreality&mdash;as if she had not herself experienced what had
actually occurred but merely seen it depicted upon the screen.</p>

<p>Tactfully, and by degrees, Lloyd extracted from her what little
there was to tell. She was sorry for Doctor Dhal, she said. He was
really a well-meaning man; but of course once you got away from it
the whole thing did seem rather silly. She had had a pleasant
enough time. It was queer at first being called by your first name
by a lot of strangers, but they were agreeable and friendly, and
the only lecture she had listened to&mdash;"The Nature of Perfect
Health"&mdash;had been quite interesting. She had been given a room
furnished in red and green because her physical examination had
revealed the fact that her system needed certain tonic vibrations
which these colors supplied. Perhaps it did, she didn't know. But
Doctor Dhal was all right. There had not been the slightest need to
worry about her. She was half asleep by the time they reached
Queensboro Bridge, and when Diana pulled up at the curb in front of
the house, the child seemed disinclined to get out. Before she did
so Sheila lowered her head as if to look for something in the
bottom of the car, caught Lloyd's hand and pressed it swiftly to
her lips.</p>

<p>There were two closed motors already there, and Jarmon threw
open the front door before they had reached the top of the steps.
Two strangers were talking together in the front hall. The elevator
stood open. A woman in street costume with a bag beside her sat
near the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Has anything happened, Jarmon?" asked Diana apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Your grandfather, miss. He had a stroke in the Park. He's
upstairs in his room."</p>

<p>One of the strange men accosted them.</p>

<p>"Miss Kayne? I am Doctor Warren. Is your sister Sheila here?
Your grandfather keeps asking for her&mdash;that is, so we
understand him. Will you see that she goes to him at once?"</p>

<p>Diana half closed her eyes. The wainscoting seemed to sway.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lloyd! Lloyd!" she murmured. He took her hands.</p>

<p>"This is where <i>you're</i> needed!" he said.</p>

<p>"And where we all&mdash;I&mdash;need you too!" she answered
feverishly. "Come, Sheila!"</p>

<p>They found Claudia upstairs sitting with Unde Billy. The old man
appeared stupefied by what had happened. The door to her
grandfather's bedroom was open, light streaming from it.</p>

<p>The pirate lay on his cot, his shaggy white head slightly thrust
forward by the extra pillow behind it, staring at the door. A nurse
stood in the background. Their father was kneeling beside the bed
in his business clothes. In a chair at the foot sat their mother in
her best terra-cotta evening dress, and wearing her emerald
stomacher and her diamond-and-emerald necklace and tiara. There was
something noticeably unnatural in her grandfather's position. A
shadow obscured the color of his face. Every moment or two he would
make a spasmodic effort with his right arm and from his lips would
issue an odd sibilation, a grotesque labial hissing.</p>

<p>The nurse saw them and stepped forward with a smile of
professional encouragement. Their father lifted his head, but Diana
could hardly recognize his face. Elizabeth had the strained look of
the self-consciously sympathetic. She got up and motioned to
Sheila.</p>

<p>"Here!" she said. "You take this!"</p>

<p>"Speak to him," suggested the nurse.</p>

<p>Sheila, her hands clasped before her, drew near the foot of the
bed.</p>

<p>"Grandpa!" she whispered, forcing back a sob. "It's
me&mdash;Sheila."</p>

<p>The eyes of the pirate widened, and he lifted his head the
fraction of an inch. It could not be said that a light came into
his face, but the lines of his forehead moved upward and the
pathetic semblance of a smile twisted one cheek. He made an heroic
effort to articulate but his tongue had lost its power.</p>

<p>"Th&mdash;th&mdash;ss&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Then his head sank to his chest and he gave vent to a long sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>When half an hour later she came downstairs, Diana found Lloyd
waiting in the hall. To his glance of inquiry she said:</p>

<p>"He is quite helpless, poor old man! He may live as he is for
some time. Conceivably he might make a partial recovery. But
another shock would end it. It's terrible for father! It's killing
him!"</p>

<p>"Come and let us get a bite to eat somewhere," he proposed, and
he could see that the suggestion pleased her. They descended the
steps just as the chauffeur was taking the car away.</p>

<p>"How lucky Sheila came with us!" she said as they walked along
the avenue. "Grandfather knew her at once and it seemed to make him
quite happy."</p>

<p>They were passing a street-light and she raised her eyes to
him.</p>

<p>"Of course you know the reason she came back?"</p>

<p>He read the answer and hurriedly looked away.</p>

<p>"I never suspected," he answered in a gruff voice. "Poor
kid!"</p>

<p>"But why?" she continued very softly. "She's so sweet! And she
needs some one so!"</p>

<p>"No!" he replied. "It can't be! It's no use!! I'm sorry. But
I've nothing to blame myself for!"</p>

<p>"Except for being you!" she said.</p>

<p>His heart was leaping, leaping! Was it possible that he had been
wrong, misjudged her entirely all along?</p>

<p>"Oh, Lloyd, you can't guess how I've been worrying about her the
last forty-eight hours. She's so innocent! So easily influenced.
And now everything seems to be falling about our ears. If I could
only feel that she was safe!"</p>

<p>"It can't be!" he repeated, his brain awhirl. He was not going
to find Diana merely to lose her! "It can't be!"</p>

<p>They walked on nearly a block without speaking. Then she
said:</p>

<p>"How strange that all these misfortunes should happen to us at
once. If I believed in a God I should almost feel as if it were a
judgment of some sort. If it weren't for you, Lloyd, I don't know
what I should do."</p>

<p>Again his heart leaped, forcing the blood to his eyes, his ears,
his very fingertips!</p>

<p>"I need you, Lloyd!" she went on. "For I have no one else to
turn to. I've never had any father of the ordinary kind at all.
Church and all that sort of thing has never meant anything to me.
I've never believed in a future existence of any sort. We're bom,
we live, we die&mdash;and as far as I'm concerned that's the end of
it. I've never been able to satisfy myself that there's any reason
why any of us should accept the moral doctrines that are preached
to us. We find ourselves here&mdash;that's all! And usually it
seems wiser to play the game according to the rules."</p>

<p>She lowered her head and dropped her voice.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I've followed the rules and sometimes I haven't. I
have always been sorry&mdash;but for no reason that has seemed
adequate."</p>

<p>His heart stopped entirely. Obviously she was speaking of
Devereaux! It was as if a lance had been thrust through his breast.
Yet he knew that the pang was only lest she should still love
Devereaux and not himself.</p>

<p>"At first it doesn't seem to matter what you believe, because
life is such fun anyway. You have the idea that nobody is really
bad except in books; and that people are good as a matter of
course. You imagine even if you don't go any farther that honesty
is, at least, really the best policy. And then you discover that in
point' of fact the world is full of all kinds of crookedness and
that the people on top and often the most respected are apt to be
the worst of all. You wonder what is the use of trying to be on the
level yourself. You rim into two poor souls like Claudia and Nigel
and you realize that there isn't any justice in the world.
And&mdash;and&mdash;sometimes you want to kill yourself!"</p>

<p>She spoke with an intensity that frightened him.</p>

<p>"You have never felt like that!" he challenged desperately.</p>

<p>"Indeed I have!" she answered. "With nothing to look forward to,
why not? Most lives on their face aren't worth living. You know
that! And sometimes it seems as if the game weren't worth the
candle."</p>

<p>"Then why," he demanded, "are so many sure that it is? If life
is nothing but 'dead sea fruit,' why are there so many people who
are really happy?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they aren't!" she replied. "Perhaps something has
blinded&mdash;doped them. Perhaps in every case the man or woman
who thinks he or she is happy is doped by success, or money, or
fame, or popularity, or&mdash;something? If they die before it
wears off, well and good; then perhaps they die happy. If they live
too long, they just&mdash;for the most part&mdash;keep up a
pretense."</p>

<p>"But haven't you been happy?" he asked in surprise. "I certainly
always thought of you as that!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lloyd!" she answered sadly, "if you only knew!"</p>

<p>"Then you were never doped by money or popularity?"</p>

<p>"For a year or two perhaps&mdash;not any longer. You see now why
I need your help&mdash;your encouragement. I'm the only one of the
family that isn't in some sort of trouble. I've got to piece things
out if I can. And somehow I feel as if I were entirely alone. I've
got nothing really to go by. I don't say I'm an absolute cynic; but
only that, so far as I can see, there's no logical answer to the
cynic's argument of 'what's the use?' I don't know of any reason
for being honest or decent or sincere. That's what makes everything
so hopeless!"</p>

<p>"Why do you tell me this?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Because it's only fair that you should know&mdash;if I am
asking your friendship."</p>

<p>He began laughing excitedly.</p>

<p>"But, Diana!" he cried, pulling her around so that she faced
him. "Don't you see&mdash;hang it all!&mdash;that you've answered
the question yourself? The reason you do the things you ought to do
is because you must do them if you want to be happy. And you always
know what it is, every time!&mdash;or pretty nearly every time," he
qualified himself.</p>

<p>"Conscience?"</p>

<p>"That's what I call it."</p>

<p>"But I don't believe in conscience!"</p>

<p>"Call it anything you like, then."</p>

<p>"Conscience didn't make me want to tell you about myself."</p>

<p>"But something did!"</p>

<p>She twisted away from him, but he caught her by the arm.</p>

<p>"Diana! Why tell me the truth if you don't believe in it? It's
because you do believe in it! Because it's part of you and you're
always true to yourself. You couldn't be anything else! You may
think you don't believe in anything; and refuse to admit that
you've got any religion. But all the time you know that you're part
of the whole big scheme, and recognize it by what you call 'playing
the game' and 'being a sport.' I'd rather have your instinct than
my conscience, all confused as it is with law and ethics and
inherited conventions. Oh, Diana, you are just as you look! You
think you are cynical and materialistic but you're not&mdash;you're
generous and true&mdash;and&mdash;and beautiful!"</p>

<p>"No! No!" she protested.</p>

<p>"Diana!" he cried, "I love you! I love you!&mdash;I love
you!"</p>

<p>They were passing a flight of steps and he led her into the
shadow. A policeman eyed them suspiciously. Maitland took her by
both shoulders. She lifted her face to his, her eyes closed.</p>

<p>"I love! I love you!" he repeated tremulously. "You're
everything there is for me in life! I've always loved you! You're
the most wonderful, astounding person in the world for me! I can't
go on without you! You must have known it! Of course you knew it.
Why did you try to get me to say I cared for Sheila! When I love
you&mdash;only you&mdash;never any one else! Diana! Say you love
me! Say it!&mdash;Say it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lloyd! Lloyd!" was all she said.</p>

<p>He was kissing her now, holding her head in his two hands, and
her tears were slipping warm across his fingers. He brushed them
away with his lips.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, say you need me!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;<i>love</i>&mdash;you!" she answered, holding her cheek to
his.</p>

<p>So they stood on the sidewalk of Fifth Avenue&mdash;yet in
paradise.</p>

<p>"Quick! Let me go! That policeman is coming across the street!"
she said.</p>

<p>He felt like a giddy fool, as, tightly holding her hand, they
continued without consciousness of effort or of direction along the
thoroughfare.</p>

<p>"And I always thought&mdash;was sure you were in love with
Larry. Are you quite positive that you were not?"</p>

<p>"Quite!" she answered. "I liked him tremendously but I never was
the least little bit in love with him. I never was in love before.
One can't mistake it, you know!" And then she added, glancing up at
him with a little husky laugh: "I may be 'doped'&mdash;but I'm
happy!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>Chapter 31. "Babylon is Fallen, is
Fallen"</h2>

<p>A red flag drooped&mdash;flapping intermittently&mdash;from an
oaken pole protruding from one of the lower windows of the Kayne
house. The bunting itself had seen hard service, the pole was
stained and battered, but the cords that laced it in place were
white and new and, as if to allay possible apprehension on the part
of passers-by who might otherwise have inferred the presence of
scarlet fever or something else contagious, it bore in large dirty
letters the word "Auction."</p>

<p>It was the hour when Rufus Kayne usually made his appearance at
the head of the brownstone steps, deferentially followed by Jarmon,
and descended buttoning his gloves to his waiting motor. But on
this particular morning his place was occupied by a colored boy in
green livery, wearing a pill-box cap marked "Peterman" in gold
letters.</p>

<p>The colored boy, leaning against the iron grill of the open
door, regarded the pedestrians below with hauteur. Until Mr.
Burleigh should arrive&mdash;which would not be until precisely one
minute before ten o'clock&mdash;he was in charge, and he was full
of the insolence of office. No other human being so feels the pride
of complete authority, of absolute possession, as an auctioneer,
unless it be a caterer or an undertaker. Most of the walkers, whose
business allowed them to do so, had sought the shade of the
opposite side of the street. The colored boy, however, invited the
sun's full onslaught.</p>

<p>Spring had burst the invisible bonds forged secretly by winter,
and in an unrestrained paroxysm of relief had scattered its
evidences everywhere up and down the avenue like confetti after a
carnival. The sporadic buttonwoods and maples in their wire corsets
at the curb's edge were showered with reddish leafy buds, like
flights of tiny butterflies; there was grass behind some of the
iron fences and brownstone balustrades; and a multitude of small
worms had pushed up from their subterranean homes beneath the flags
and were sprawling in an abandoned manner in public view. And on
the ledges of the Kayne house bloomed window-boxes full of
geraniums, heliotrope, crocuses, and yellow cowslips, since nobody
had warned the florist that his semiannual visit was to be
unnecessary that spring.</p>

<p>There was certainly something incongruous in this tax on
permanency, this last touch of personal luxury and elegance, and
the huge canvas sign suspended between those flower-decked windows,
reading:</p>

<pre>
         To Be Sold
   THIS MAGNIFICENT PRIVATE
          RESIDENCE
             At
           AUCTION
  on Friday, May 19th, 1922
        at 10 o'clock
      together with all
FURNISHINGS and OBJECTS OF ART.
    The Peterman Galleries
   T. Burleigh, Auctioneer.
</pre>

<p>For two weeks now the pirate had hovered between life and death
upon the upper floor. In the excitement attendant upon the old
man's collapse no one had had time to think of business matters and
the preparations for the auction had gone on until it was too
late&mdash;at any rate, Mr. Burleigh said it was too late&mdash;to
cancel them. After all, the house and contents had to be sold.
Simply because the family were still in occupancy made no
particular difference&mdash;they could eat in the library. Rufus,
overwhelmed by the calamity to his father, let him have his
way.</p>

<p>The old man had hardly stirred since they had laid him upon his
narrow cot&mdash;the hard, narrow cot that he so preferred to Miss
Lamb's box springs. They knew that he was probably dying, and by
virtue of that fact he regained for the time being in their
imaginations all his colossal proportions. The head of the house,
the founder of the family, the giant&mdash;was dying! They thought
no more of him as a gentle, feeble octogenarian&mdash;a sort of
living relic of former days miraculously preserved. That phase was
over. The frail body that lay motionless in that silent room
harbored the soul of a great man, a hero, a pioneer&mdash;and they
thought only of that great soul. He had come back. Once more he
dominated their minds, their very bodies, seeming to pervade all
the rooms and to stand at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>Just as their steps inevitably led them to his door, so their
thoughts centred ceaselessly about his bed. Rufus left the room
only for his meals. He was dazed, dumbfounded by his own grief.
Nothing else had touched him. He could imagine life without the
trust company, without Elizabeth, without any of his
children&mdash;but not without the pirate. He knew that the
pirate's room was the only church in which he had ever really
worshipped. And now the shrine would soon be empty&mdash;the
candles upon the altar extinguished. The doctor would come like a
sexton, close the door and&mdash;shut him out. Anxiously he watched
his father's set face&mdash;watched until his eyelids were weary
and his eyeballs ached, watched until he seemed to be in the same
sort of trance as that in which the old man lay.</p>

<p>The girls spent much of their time there too&mdash;sitting in
the adjoining room near Uncle Billy McGaw, who fumbled ceaselessly
over the cabinet&mdash;sorting out, arranging, and rearranging the
specimens. Uncle Billy had been acting very queerly ever since the
pirate's stroke, and at times seemed to have entirely forgotten
where he was, muttering to himself as he examined caressingly some
sparkling bit of quartz, holding it to the light, patting it and at
length laying it down tenderly in the place selected for it.</p>

<p>"This here," he might say dreamily to Claudia, "this here sure
looks good to me! Tom Sisson brought it in from Jawbone Canyon the
other day. Says there's a streak runs clear down through to Chiny!
Wants three thousand for it&mdash;but he'd work it on shares, I
reckon. I dunno&mdash;I'm goin' to get the boss to look it over
some day!"</p>

<p>Then perhaps he would pick up some other one equally
enticing.</p>

<p>"Now jest look at that! You kin see gold all over it. Gold
everywheres. That one came out of that old shaft over by Forty-two.
We oughter do somethin' about that right away!"</p>

<p>James had, of course, been most attentive, calling daily with
Edna and Rachel; and Bridget, suddenly telegraphed for, had left
the dyspeptic Mallory, her husband, at Atlantic City, and with
Cynthia had taken up a temporary residence at the St. Regis in
order to be close by. Everybody had been very kind and the front
hall had been kept full of flowers, for which Diana wrote the
letters of acknowledgment, besides taking over the entire
management of the house, Elizabeth having proved unequal to the
emergency.</p>

<p>It was astonishing how many people for the first time in years
had suddenly remembered the pirate's existence. Somebody's motor
was always in front of the door; some chauffeur always running up
the steps with a box or note or card; and twice Mr. Pepperill had
called punctiliously&mdash;and had enjoined upon Jarmon to express
to the family his deep regret, his very deep regret, at the most
distressing news.</p>

<p>But, although they all made a pretense of being cheerful and of
believing that the pirate would get Well, they knew in their hearts
that he would never leave his room again.</p>

<p>Still, on the morning of the auction Doctor Follansbee, who had
been in faithful attendance, said that the old man really seemed
better. He could detect a slight return of muscular power in the
leg and arm. The nurse might even use her discretion about letting
him sit up for a while in the armchair. It was possible that it
would do him good. But they must watch him and not let him make any
undue effort. For the present they could let him go to sleep
again.</p>

<p>So while the colored boy in his pill-box cap lounged below in
the sunshine smoking his cigarette, and waiting for his master to
come and knock the house down to the highest bidder, the man who
had built it lay up-stairs ignorant of all that had happened. So
far as old Peter knew, the house of Kayne might last forever.
Rufus, sitting beside the bed with his hand thrust beneath that of
his father, was struck by the dignity of the old man's profile as
he slept, the nobility of the marble forehead as it rose from the
aureole of untrimmed hair and beard in which it was framed. There
was in the face an austere and august stateliness.</p>

<p>Gently, so very gently as hardly to be noticeable, the sheet
upon the pirate's breast rose and fell. The room itself was still
except when Rufus changed his position or the nurse tiptoed behind
the bed. Through the open window came faintly from below the sound
of a hurdy-gurdy playing "My Country, 'tis of thee." Two sparrows
lit upon the adjacent sill, twittered, cocked their heads at Rufus,
and darted off again. Far up in the blue there could be heard the
drone of an aeroplane. The fragrance of the air from outside was
tinctured with an odor of medicines. Now and again there came from
the distance the dimmed rattle and roar of an elevated train.
Rufus, sitting there motionless, never shifted his glance from his
father's face.</p>

<p>The pirate thought he heard a fly buzzing and awoke. It annoyed
him that there should be a fly in his room. He was feeling much
stronger; could even stir his right arm and foot a little, and his
soup had tasted good to him. The nurse thought him a very dear old
fellow, although a bit irritable. He objected to flies, and there
was a bell&mdash;a doleful bell&mdash;tolling! All his senses were
alert. He had not suffered; he was not suffering now. It was only
that strange numbness of his left side&mdash;a touch of sun in the
Park the doctor had said. He'd be all right. Well, it had been
worth it! Those children! How they had enjoyed it! He mustn't be
cross! And Sheila had come back. She was over by the window looking
up into the air.</p>

<p>"An aeroplane, grandpa!" she said. "Right up there!"</p>

<p>He followed her glance, but his eyes could not get beyond the
frame of the window in which she stood. Not a fly, then. That was
good! The sound of the plane&mdash;a rumbling roar that waxed and
waned and waxed again&mdash;filled the room, drowning out the
tolling of the bell. He forgot the bell in marvelling at the plane.
It was a wonder what men had succeeded in doing! Perhaps some day
he'd muster courage enough to go up in one&mdash;with Rufus. The
clatter of the plane filled the room. It made him angry. He stirred
and uttered a sound of feeble protest.</p>

<p>"Yes, father! I'm here!" answered Rufus.</p>

<p>Sheila came from the window.</p>

<p>"What is it, grandpa, dear?" she asked, standing at the foot of
the bed.</p>

<p>"I want to get up!"</p>

<p>They were startled. It was the first time that he had
articulated normally since he had been stricken, and his voice
seemed like a voice from the tomb. Yet his appearance was
reassuring.</p>

<p>Surely there was a tinge of color in those waxen cheeks! Could
it be that the old vitality had triumphed? That the fighting spirit
which in the past had overborne all his competitors was now to
vanquish his last and greatest enemy for another round?</p>

<p>The nurse hurried forward from the corner.</p>

<p>"If he wants to!" she said. "The doctor suggested it himself.
This lying in bed is so weakening!"</p>

<p>She turned down the sheet and Rufus winced at the sight of the
old man's emaciated form, the tubular hollows between the cords of
his neck, the shrunken shoulders seen through the linen nightgown.
With care they put their arms about him, and Rufus could feel the
astonishing protuberance of his spine. Each muscle, each bone, each
organ had an amazing separate individuality. The shrivelled body
filled Rufus with acute compassion. Contrasted with the size of his
face the white mustache looked enormous&mdash;terrific. Slowly they
raised him to a sitting posture and lifted his thin old legs over
the side of the bed. Tears were in Rufus's eyes as he knelt down
and put his father's feet into his slippers.</p>

<p>Then the nurse thrust his arms through the wide-flowing sleeves
of his dressing-gown, and unassisted transferred the wasted body to
the invalid chair, stuffing pillows about it for support.</p>

<p>"Fine!" said the pirate, highly excited by so great an
adventure. "I'm&mdash;going&mdash;to get&mdash;well! You'll
see&mdash;Sheila!"</p>

<p><br><br>It was half past nine as Maitland approached the Kayne house.
There was to be a military funeral at the Cathedral that morning,
and as a member of the Legion's local post he had put on his
uniform for the first time since returning from overseas. Although
it had been freshly cleaned and pressed it still bore many marks of
service. How strange to be walking up Fifth Avenue in a unif orm
which he had worn within sound of German guns. How much more
natural, after all, it was to be in khaki than in mufti! How
familiar the old belt, the baggy breeches, the scratched and
wrinkled gaiters!</p>

<p>He had thought constantly of Dorman ever since the news of the
latter's suicide had been made public. A brave soldier, a loyal
friend, a good fellow, a chivalrous spirit! One of the heroes of
the war! Their regiments had struggled side by side through the
ravines of the Argonne! His mind refused to grasp the fact that
Dorman was dead&mdash;and by his own hand. He had seen him only
recently at the Players, and he now recalled that he had seemed
discouraged over his lack of success in finding work for the
partially disabled survivors of his regiment.</p>

<p>So Dorman was dead! He could make light of hunger, thirst, cold,
and lack of sleep, the interminable pounding of artillery, the
torture of the gas-mask&mdash;could lead his men g rinning
cheerfully into a hornet's nest of machine-guns, face death a
hundred times a day, and then sit up all night with his arm about a
dying doughboy, but he couldn't stand the harrowing appeals of
those same men for help when they had dragged their shattered
bodies back to the lonely farms or overflowing city tenements
whence they had come. He could suffer himself&mdash;but he couldn't
stand watching their suffering. His nerves had buckled under the
strain. His poor brain had cracked. Another gallant lad gone
West!</p>

<p>Poor Dorman! Past him in an uninterrupted succession rolled the
line of limousines carrying their sleek occupants down-town
to&mdash;business. "Business as usual!" Plate-glass windows on
every hand exhibited flower-gardens of women's spring hats. As
usual! Everywhere the pandering to pleasure and to extravagance! As
usual!</p>

<p>He paused on the corner opposite the house. It wore an
unfamiliar look, as if its mouth and eyes were opened in surprise
at what was going on; and the white auction sign affixed to the
front had the appearance of an artificial nose stuck on to complete
the resemblance to a face. He stood and looked at it. So it was
going! Just as the Kaynes were going. Such houses&mdash;such
families&mdash;came and went&mdash;with hardly anybody the wiser!
Monuments to the inconsequentiality of human life!</p>

<p>He crossed the street, ascended the steps, and entered the front
hall, where the auction was to take place. It had an air of being
swept and garnished, looking gloomier than ever with its rows of
folding chairs and runners of red paper laid between. The Sevres
vases had not been moved, but the palms had been shoved together
into one corner, revealing all the charms of the Greek slave, and
one of the big tables had been swung around crossways at the foot
of the organ. Upon it had been placed a huge pile of catalogues,
done in the accustomed style of the Peterman Galleries, a pitcher
of ice-water and a tumbler. Nothing else in the hall had been
changed.</p>

<p>There were a score of people already seated or wandering around
examining the <i>objets d'art</i>, and more were coming in at the
doorway every moment, bringing with them an odor of cigars
reluctantly discarded upon the topmost steps. These earlier
arrivals were for the most part seedy-looking men, among whom was a
scattering of sharp-featured, capable women&mdash;obviously
professionals, second-hand dealers, who made a business of buying
to sell again, bargain-hunters, knowing to a dollar the market
value of household goods. Some of them were in the employ of hotels
who found it cheaper to buy thus than from the wholesalers; others
belonged to the great brotherhood for whom an auction savors of all
the excitement of a lottery; others again&mdash;of
curiosity-seekers&mdash;were drifted in because the door was open
and presently would drift out again.</p>

<p>What were they doing there, these strangers? Were they lost to
all sense of decency that they could thus swarm through another's
house, straggling through the apartments, fingering the rugs and
window-curtains, tracking up the stairways, examining the pictures
and china, prying into the closets, and opening the piano? The soul
of the house was being violated; its sentiment, its atmosphere
defiled! Who was it thus dared to expose to public view the private
precincts hitherto occupied by the Kaynes? By what right did these
men come invading it with their signs and red flags, their colored
boys and catalogues, their camp-chairs and moving-vans? It was
shocking to expose these intimate possessions of the family sacred
to them by long association!</p>

<p>Here they had dwelt&mdash;four generations of
them&mdash;sheltered from public view in what the law had said was
their castle. Here Rufus had brought his young wife and entertained
their friends. Here his children had been bom. Here they had passed
their girlhood. Here Claudia had been married with the organ
pealing out the wedding-march and the hall crowded with uniforms.
Here Elizabeth had lived her life, such as it was, and gathered her
fat friends about her. Here the old pirate had climbed&mdash;before
the elevator&mdash;to his room on Uncle Billy's arm. Here, in the
earlier days, at least, there had taken place family quarrels and
conclaves, childish tears, confessions and repentances, whispered
avowals and laughing protests, sad goings-away and gay
homecomings&mdash;and up those stairs no longer than two weeks ago
the stricken form of the old pirate had been carried to the room
where now he lay.</p>

<p>With what care and study&mdash;no matter what the taste
exercised&mdash;each of the pieces of furniture had been chosen!
What an event the purchase of the tapestries! No room, no passage,
no landing, no stair, no square foot of floor space that was not
crowded with memory, peopled by the ghosts of former years!</p>

<p>The crowd behind shoved Maitland along and he made his way
through the hall and ascended to the second story, where he
encountered Jarmon coming from Mrs. Kayne's room with her
breakfast-tray in his hands. From him Lloyd learned that the old
gentleman seemed to be somewhat better and that Miss Diana had gone
out. Colonel Maitland didn't 'appen to know of anybody lookin' for
an hexperienced man servant, did 'e? Jarmon himself explained that
he had just given notice. Rats and sinking ships!</p>

<p>Lloyd descended to the landing on the mezzanine floor and
paused, surveying the hall below. The visitors were coming in now
in a steady stream, each at the door receiving one of the
circulars, then working around among the chairs for an advantageous
place, after furtively removing a catalogue from the pile upon the
table as if fearful of being asked to pay for it. The avenue
outside was blocked with motors, and a black man in maroon livery
with a tall hat and cockade had mysteriously appeared and was
opening the doors in the grandest possible manner. The Kayne
auction had begun to take on the flavor of a society function.</p>

<p>Squarely implanted in the middle of the second row Lloyd could
see the robust figure of Mrs. Brice-Brewster in a coquettish straw
hat fringed with spears of wheat. She was evidently expecting
somebody, for she had carefully spread a portion of her purple
pongee skirt over a part of the chair beside her and had placed a
plump white-gloved hand in the middle of the seat. Senator Krass, a
vacant expression upon his long pink face, his tall figure arrayed
in a gray cutaway suit and wearing a gray derby hat with a black
band, made his way toward the front followed anxiously by his small
wife like a dog at heel. He indicated a seat in the front row,
removed his hat with solemnity, reached for a catalogue, and sank
down beside her. In the centre of the room sat Mrs. Wingate in a
tan-colored toque with a silver tassel, and beside her Rita
Ricardo, to whom, evidently, Doctor Dhal had extended a
half-holiday. Most of the chairs were taken by this time, and a
line of standees had formed on the side next the staircase. In one
of the front windows he could see Darcy and Longwood, and wondered
what they could be doing there. A couple of hundred women formed a
solid phalanx in the middle of the hall. It was like an afternoon
tea.</p>

<p>The same old crowd&mdash;drawn by curiosity, cupidity, or by the
desire to experience that satisfaction which La Rochefoucauld so
cynically asserts the best of us derive from the misfortunes of our
friends. This tragedy of success was nothing to any of them. With
the exception of a few dull souls who, like Emily Brice-Brewster,
had a sincere if mild affection for Elizabeth, none of these people
cared two straws for the Kaynes or what became of them. Most of
them actually disliked Rufus and disapproved of his
children&mdash;were glad of the opportunity to say "I told you so!"
At best those assembled were there on business, coldly indifferent
to the misfortunes of the owner which now offered them their
present entertainment and fin ancial opportunity.</p>

<p>The delicate figure of Mr. Pepperill appeared picking his way
through the crowd and casting about for Mrs. Brice-Brewster, who
tried to attract his attention by anxiously waving at him.
Impatience manifested itself&mdash;by a rustling of programmes. The
colored boy, abandoning the doorway in obedience to some inaudible
instruction, approached the table and passed catalogues to those
who had been too shy to take them. Then he produced a small table
from behind the organ and carried it up the four steps to the
landing on the stairway, which made a half-turn at this point
before following the wainscoting to the mezzanine. Upon the table
he placed the pitcher of ice-water, the tumbler, and one of the
catalogues. Evidently this was to be the rostrum from which the
sale was to take place. Last he carried up a chair. The crowd
watched his movements with tense expectancy. A broad-shouldered
young man with a high-arched nose and faun-shaped ears whispered
something to the boy, who thereupon retired beneath the
staircase.</p>

<p>Maitland glanced at his watch. It was one minute to ten. He
looked about him for a place where he could comfortably see and
hear all that went on, self-consciously aware that his uniform made
him too conspicuous to go downstairs. He was vitally interested in
the price which the house itself might bring, since upon the
success of the sale depended his future father-in-law's ability to
meet his obligations. There was no "upset" price; it was to go for
what it would fetch, and the auction might be a fiasco.</p>

<p>The mezzanine gallery ran entirely around the wall, and he
stepped into it and sat down on a bench over the organ. On his left
hung the three great Flemish tapestries purchased by old Peter
thirty years before for forty thousand dollars&mdash;to cover up
Howlett's original scheme of decoration which Elizabeth had
regarded as too commonplace&mdash;crude in taste, yet sufficiently
expensive to satisfy the aesthetic standards of their original
purchaser. So, after elaborately disingenuous apologies to the
architect, they had superseded the elaborate Gothic carvings and
the gilded "Domus" and had hung there ever since&mdash;subject to
an occasional "rejuvenation" by Miss Lamb: huge affairs eighteen
feet by twenty-two and correspondingly heavy; supported by a few
brass hooks on a gilded moulding and entirely covering the westerly
side of the hall, including the cornice. On the one nearest was
depicted an amorous, or possibly merely amiable, group of Olympians
quaffing goblets of nectar amid the clouds, their muscular arms
about one another's pillar-like necks&mdash;undoubtedly the best
people of their time.</p>

<p>At that instant, as foreordained, Mr. Burleigh made his
entrance, pushing authoritatively through the crowd about the
threshold. The vital moment had at last arrived. In spite of
himself Maitland experienced a choking of excitement. Mr.
Burleigh&mdash;short, abdominal, with a gray beard, and hom-rimmed
glasses over his watery blue eyes, a carnation in his buttonhole
and a tiny pair of golden antlers pinned just below it&mdash;strode
past the rows of chairs with the air of a benign autocrat. For
thirty years he had been the popular auctioneer of the metropolis.
He was the master of ceremonies&mdash;the whole show&mdash;they
could not get on without him. He knew who everybody was, who meant
business and who was there merely for the fun of it. Moreover, he
knew everybody who was buying for somebody else. But knowing these
things did not affect his detachment. It was nothing to him what
price anything brought or who bought it. It was his business to
sell to the highest bidder whatever was offered; and he would sell
with like indifference a rug, a picture, a bassinet, a statue, or a
rolling-pin. Had he lived prior to 1861 he would, with equal
nonchalance, have sold slaves.</p>

<p>There was that about Mr. Burleigh which made Maitland shiver.
Was it possible that the man was entirely destitute of feeling? The
little auctioneer stepped briskly up to the landing, nodding here
and there at various familiar faces among the crowd as he laid down
his straw hat and glanced critically about him. The assistant
seated himself on a corner of the large table below and began
sharpening a pencil. The audience rustled itself to silence. Mr.
Burleigh poured out a glass of ice-water and took a sip.</p>

<p>"I'll sell the house first," said he in a mild but penetrating
voice. That was all: "I'll sell the house first." With no more
ceremony than that did he open the obsequies of this palatial
brownstone edifice. He was no barker&mdash;no mountebank, although
he knew his business.</p>

<p>"The house itself is, of course, worth nothing," he continued.
"But the land&mdash;the possibilities of this location&mdash;are
immensely valuable. It is undoubtedly one of the best sites in the
city."</p>

<p>Worth nothing? Lucky that old Peter Kayne, lying on the top
story, could not hear him! Worth not hing? Had it not cost with its
furniture a million dollars? Did Burleigh imagine that a
million-dollar house would deteriorate in forty years so as to be
valueless? Did he not know that that house had been built to last?
That it was the best house of its time? That Howlett&mdash;the
justly celebrated Howlett&mdash;up there on the roof&mdash;had
designed it? That its beams and rafters were of the best seasoned
lumber, its brownstone chiselled from a special quarry, each brick
hand-pressed and baked, its foundations excavated to the solid
rock, its floors soundproof, its walls of double thickness&mdash;a
mansion, a castle, a citadel, a stronghold, a fortress! Worth
nothing? Maitland imagined the walls quivering with mortification,
the floors trembling with indignation. Worth nothing? A lot he
knew! Lucky old Howlett was firmly fastened to the roof! Worth
nothing? Worth nothing!</p>

<p>Maitland no longer heard what Burleigh was saying. Could it be
true that it was worth nothing? The house of Kayne worth nothing?
He looked over the rail behind which he was concealed. Directly
below him, in the second row beside Mrs. Brice-Brewster, was his
partner, Mr. Vincent Pepperill, nodding at the remarks of the
auctioneer. He recalled vividly what the old gentleman had said the
first time he had deigned to discuss the Kaynes&mdash;stigmatizing
them as materialists&mdash;all the more significantly for that he
was one himself&mdash;had intimated that they worshipped the golden
calf of wealth, place, and fashion&mdash;that they lived "by bread
alone." Had not he been right? And was not Burleigh
right&mdash;although in a different sense? Was the house worth
anything? Did it not stand for selfishness and hypocrisy, for greed
and luxury, for worldliness? He had seen those figures on the
roof!&mdash;had Howlett, with his keen insight into men, known what
would happen to the Kaynes?&mdash;to this "house made with hands"?
Had not Howlett known that the house was ugly and that the period
was ugly&mdash;the period of plush furniture and the Albert
Memorial? Hadn't he simply given old Peter Kayne what he wanted?
And did not the physical ugliness of the period symbolize, in a
way, the sordidness of its ideals? Was it worth anything? On the
whole, wouldn't it be a good thing to tear the hideous old thing
down&mdash;with all its decorations and furnishings&mdash;to give
place to something better?</p>

<p>Mr. Burleigh was announcing the terms and conditions of
sale&mdash;twenty-five thousand dollars down&mdash;balance in
fifteen days. Maitland, stretching his spurred and booted legs,
became conscious again of being in uniform. In a few minutes he
would be following Dorman's coffin up the aisle of the
Cathedral.</p>

<p>"Boom!"</p>

<p>Already the bell had begun to toll. It trembled in the
organ-pipes and the shudder in the air took him back to the
Argonne. It was like the detonation of a German heavy: like those
on that misty morning after the Boche had felt them out and got the
range, when the two regiments had received the order to advance,
and he had talked to Dorman over the field-telephone and they had
wished each other luck. Had that been for nothing? Was it all for
nothing?</p>

<p>"Boom!" He must go&mdash;go to Dorman!</p>

<p>What was Burleigh saying? "Seven hundred thousand "? Ha-ha! He
and the faim-eared assistant were laughing at such an offer! Some
one had bid seven hundred and twenty-five!</p>

<p>The floor creaked. A hand fell lightly on his shoulder. A kiss
brushed his cheek. Diana! He seized her hand, drew her down beside
him on the bench, and touched his lips to her forehead and
hair.</p>

<p>"Grandfather's better!" she whispered. "He's quite wonderful
this morning! The doctor has let him sit up in the armchair. But if
he should get well, he'd be frightfully upset about the house. Poor
old house!"</p>

<p>Maitland held her to him without reply.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;have you heard?&mdash;father's got a new job? A very
good one&mdash;as vice-president of a national bank. Mr. Graham
found it for him?"</p>

<p>"Splendid!" he answered.</p>

<p>"Why are you in uniform?" she asked suddenly. "I like you in
it!"</p>

<p>"I'm going to a military funeral," he answered. "You can hear
the bell."</p>

<p>"Whose funeral?"</p>

<p>"'Chuck' Dorman's&mdash;we were together on the other side."</p>

<p>She shivered and drew closer. He looked at his watch. Ten
minutes yet.</p>

<p>Burleigh's rasping voice rose from the floor below punctuated by
the tolling bell.</p>

<p>"Seven hundred and thirty thousand? Giving it away, I tell you!
Do I hear the five? Thank you! Do I hear forty?
Forty&mdash;forty&mdash;forty? Thank you! And five?&mdash;it's your
bid, sir. Thank you. Seven hundred and forty-five thousand dollars!
Do I hear the fifty? Fifty&mdash;fifty&mdash;fifty? Do I hear the
fifty?"</p>

<p>The bidding had centred between two men in the front row, and
the audience was pressing forward the better to see and hear what
was going on. Mr. Burleigh leaned over the banister and looked
inquiringly at a snuffy little man next the aisle. The little man
nodded almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>"And fifty!" ejaculated Mr. Burleigh, and the crowd exhaled with
relief.</p>

<p>"Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars! Do I hear the five?
Going at seven hundred and fifty.
Fifty-five&mdash;fifty-five&mdash;fifty-five? Do I hear the five?"
He looked at the opposing bidder, who shook his head and reached
for his hat.</p>

<p>"Boom!" went the Cathedral bell.</p>

<p>"Going at seven hundred and fifty thousand!" intoned Mr.
Burleigh in the same key.</p>

<p><br><br>The pirate sat in his chair, his arms extended, his shaggy head
protruding from the pillows, like that of some lawgiver of old.
Rufus had gone down-town to finish up his business at the trust
company, and Sheila had taken out Uncle Billy for a walk. The
nurse, hoping that her patient would go to sleep again, had stepped
into the next room and, leaving the door open between, was reading
a detective story. But the pirate could not go to sleep, and he did
not want to. All his irritation had disappeared. It was not right
to be fussy when they were all so kind.</p>

<p>The aeroplane had passed over the house and the sound of it was
dying away&mdash;nothing but a hum, or was it a fly, after all?
There was no other sound save the faint strains of the hurdy-gurdy,
its tune hardly distinguishable, and the bell, which seemed to be
always tolling. The air was sweet&mdash;sweet. The pirate could
feel new strength stealing into his veins. He could not fail to
respond to the influence of the spring outside, to the love in
those hearts near by. A rheumy tear gathered in the corner of his
eye and slid gently along the furrow between his nose and his right
cheek. Yes, he was going to get well! More of life! The thought
filled him with painful gladness. The numbness that had made his
left side feel like lead was almost gone.</p>

<p>And now, through the door left open by the nurse, there came to
his ears a sound like that of a distant talking-machine. It rose
and fell, paused and began again&mdash;a curious noise to be in a
private house, as if somebody were delivering a lecture
down-stairs. He stood it patiently for a while, although it
bothered him. Yes, somebody was talking in an exasperatingly loud
nasal tone. His irritation returned. Why couldn't they keep the
house quiet! Where was the nurse? Why had she left the door open?
He called her name, but at that moment she had gone down to the
pantry for a glass of milk. Angry at his failure to get any
response, the pirate pushed off the coverlet from his knees and
stood miraculously up. The effort did not inconvenience him and he
took a step toward the door, intending to close it to keep out the
noise. He seemed to be able to walk as well as ever!</p>

<p>He paused with his hand on the door-jamb and listened. From
where he stood the whole house seemed full of strange squeaks and
murmurs, whisperings and rustlings, broken by the singsong shouting
of the voice which floated up from the front hall. What was going
on down there? Strange people had intruded into his house. Who
could they be? He must see about that!</p>

<p>Shakily, with his hand upon the banister, the pirate felt his
way down the stairs. The noises grew louder with each step of his
descent; and his anger grew proportionately. Who was making all
that fuss in his house? He reached the third landing and started
down toward the second, just below which led off the gallery of the
mezzanine. The noise that now filled the house was like that of the
sea crashing upon the rocks. Above the thunder of the surf he could
hear the tolling of a bell-buoy. Some one was shouting to him, but
the waves drowned the voice so that he could not distinguish what
it was saying. Clang! went the knell of the buoy. Clang! It was
bewildering having the sea come into your house. He hoped Sheila
was safe! and Rufus! He was on the second landing now, and the roar
of the breakers in the entrance-hall was like thunder in his ears.
He would not go down there. He would but go into the gallery and
peek over to see what was happening.</p>

<p><br><br>"Going at seven hundred and fifty thousand!" Mr. Burleigh was
chanting down below. "Do I hear the
five?&mdash;fifty-five&mdash;fifty-five&mdash;fifty-five? It's
being thrown away, I tell you! Thrown away! For the last
time&mdash;going at seven hundred and fifty thousand! Going once!
Going twice!" He raised his pencil and looked round the hall.
"Going three times!" He brought the end of the pencil down with a
smart tap.</p>

<p>"Sold! To the Goethals-Schwenken Company for seven hundred and
fifty thousand dollars!"</p>

<p>There was a general murmur of relief and a shuffling of feet.
Mr. Burleigh poured out a glass of water and drank it slowly. Half
a dozen people got up and went out.</p>

<p>"And now," continued the auctioneer, picking up the catalogue
and opening it at the first page, "we will dispose of the furniture
and <i>objets d'art</i>. I will begin with the three tapestries
hanging on your right. Number One. Very rare allegorical
eighteenth-century Flemish&mdash;eighteen by twenty-two. Buyer to
have option of purchasing either or both of the others at same
price."</p>

<p>The spectators resettled themselves, turning with one accord
toward the corner by the organ where hung the Olympians.</p>

<p>"These tapestries, ladies and gentlemen, are museum pieces and
should bring a handsome figure. They were bought in Europe for Mr.
Peter Kayne at the time the house was built. I may say they were
the talk of New York."</p>

<p>At this Senator Krass arose and, putting on his eyeglasses,
examined the fabric with the air of a connoisseur.</p>

<p>"I hope you can all see, ladies and gentlemen?" said Mr.
Burleigh. "It would be a shame to have these tapestries sold
without a full appreciation of their artistic value."</p>

<p>He looked around at his assistant.</p>

<p>"Do you mind throwing on those lights, Mr. Wolf?"</p>

<p>The faun-eared man pressed a button near the organ and a glare
of electricity illuminated the top of the wainscoting.</p>

<p>"That's better!" said Mr. Burleigh. He beckoned to the negro.
"Now, Jo, just lift up the corner of Number One&mdash;yes, that
next to the organ&mdash;so the ladies and gentlemen back there can
see the design."</p>

<p>Diana and Maitland, from the gallery above, watched the boy walk
across in front of the first row of chairs, past Senator Krass,
past Mr. Pepperill and Mrs. Brice-Brewster, bend over and take the
corner of the tapestry in his hands. Many of the audience moved
forward to get a better view. There was going to be a chance for
everybody to pick up a bargain.</p>

<p>"Boom!"</p>

<p>The Cathedral bell had begun again. The "minute-bell" for the
dead.</p>

<p>Suddenly Maitland felt Diana's clasp tighten.</p>

<p>"Look!" she gasped. "Look!"</p>

<p>At the other end of the mezzanine, but twenty feet from where
they sat, under the full glare of the electricity, stood the
patriarchal figure of her grandfather in his dressing-gown, gazing
down upon the throng. His face wore a puzzled look, but his figure
in its flowing garment had an austere and rugged grandeur. For an
instant only did he stand there. Before either Diana or Maitland
could stir to help him, they saw his left hand clutch the tapestry
at his side, his body stiffen and collapse backward into the
gallery.</p>

<p>The tug on the tapestry loosened one corner from its fastenings.
The group of Olympians sagged sideways. A hook leaped singing into
the air over the heads of the audience. The moulding cracked
ominously.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried a voice. "It's going to fall!"</p>

<p>"Boom!" came from the Cathedral.</p>

<p>There was a frenzied rush on the part of the spectators to get
clear. Two or three women screamed. Chairs were overturned. With a
loud report the tapestry ripped the moulding from the wall and fell
upon the floor in a crumpled heap.</p>

<p>There was a momentary hush. A cloud of dust rose toward the
mezzanine, slowly settling again, while the startled onlookers
gradually regained their composure. There burst forth a confused
hubbub of ejaculation, jocularity, laughter, followed by silence as
their eyes turned to where the tapestry had hung. Upon the
wainscoting beneath, totally forgotten and now revealed for the
first time since it had been carven there forty years before,
appeared the inscription:</p>

<p class="poem">"Except the Lord build the house<br>
they labour in vain that build it."</p>
