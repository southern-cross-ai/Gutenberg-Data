<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p class="first">The Author would like to anticipate certain
of the objections which may be raised by some of the kindly
critics and reviewers who gave so friendly and encouraging
a chorus of praise to <i>Beau Geste, The Wages of Virtue,</i>
and <i>The Stepsons of France.</i></p>

<p>Certain of the events chronicled in these books were
objected to, as being impossible.</p>

<p>They were impossible.</p>

<p>The only defence that the Author can offer is that,
although perfectly impossible, they actually happened.</p>

<p>In reviewing <i>The Wages of Virtue,</i> for example, a very
distinguished literary critic remarked that the incident
of a girl being found in the French Foreign Legion was
absurd, and merely added an impossibility to a number of
improbabilities.</p>

<p>The Author admitted the justice of the criticism, and
then, as now, put forth the same feeble defence that,
although perfectly impossible, it was the simple truth. He
further offered to accompany the critic (at the latter's
expense) to the merry town of Figuig in Northern Africa,
and there to show him the tombstone (with its official
epitaph) of a girl who served for many years, <i>in the
Spahis, as a cavalry trooper,</i> rose to the rank of
Sergeant, and remained, until her death in battle, quite
unsuspected of being what she was--a European woman.</p>

<p>And in this book, nothing is set forth as having
happened which has not happened--including the adoption of
two ex-Legionaries by an Arab tribe, and their rising to
Sheikdom and to such power that they were signatories to a
treaty with the Republic.</p>

<p>One of them, indeed, was conducted over a French
troopship, and his simple wonder at the marvels of the
<i>Roumi</i> was rather touching, and of pleasing interest to
all who witnessed it...</p>

<p>The reader may rest assured that the deeds narrated, and
the scenes and personalities pictured, in this book, are
not the vain outpourings of a film-fed imagination, but
the re-arrangement of actual happenings and the assembling
of real people who have actually lived, loved, fought and
suffered&mdash;and some of whom, indeed, live, love, fight and
suffer to this day.</p>

<p>Truth <i>is</i> stranger than fiction.</p>

<h2><a name="c101" id="c101"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>"OUT OF THE DEPTHS I RISE"</h3>

<p class="first">
I will start at the very nadir of my fortunes, at the
very lowest depths, and you shall see them rise to their
zenith, that highest point where they are crowned by
Failure.</p>

<p>Behold me, then, clad in a dirty canvas stable-suit and
wooden clogs, stretched upon a broad sloping shelf; my
head, near the wall, resting on a wooden ledge, a foot wide
and two inches thick, meant for a pillow; and my feet near
the ledge that terminates this beautiful bed, which is some
thirty feet long and seven feet wide. It is as long as the
room, in fact, and about two feet from the filthy brick
floor.</p>

<p>Between my pampered person and the wooden bed, polished
by the rubbing of many vile bodies, is nothing. Covering
me is a canvas "bread-bag," four feet long and two
wide, a sack used for the carrying of army loaves. As a
substitute for sheets, blankets and eider-down quilt, it is
inadequate.</p>

<p>The night is bitterly cold, and, beneath my canvas
stable-suit, I am wearing my entire wardrobe of
underclothes, in spite of which, my teeth are chattering
and I shiver from head to foot as though stricken with
ague.</p>

<p>I am not allowed to wear my warm regimentals and cloak
or overcoat, for, alas! I am in prison.</p>

<p>There is nothing else in the prison but myself and a
noisy, <i>nouveau riche,</i> assertive kind of odour.</p>

<p>I am wrong&mdash;and I wish to be strictly accurate and
perfectly truthful&mdash;there are hungry and insidious insects,
number unknown, industrious, ambitious, and successful.</p>

<p>Some of my fellow troopers pride themselves on being
men of intelligence and reason, and therefore believe only
in what they can see. I cannot see the insects, but I,
intelligent or not, believe in them firmly.</p>

<p>Hullo! there is something else.... A rat has run
across my face.... I am glad so rude a beast is in
prison. Serve him right.... On the whole, though, I wish
he were not in prison, for he is nibbling at my ambrosial
locks.... If I smite at him wildly I shall administer a
severe blow to the brick wall, with my knuckles....</p>

<p>The door, of six-inch oak, is flung open, and by the
light of the lantern in the hand of the Sergeant of the
Guard, I see a man and a brother flung into my retreat. He
falls heavily and lies where he falls, in peaceful slumber.
He has been worshipping at the shrine of Bacchus, a false
god. The door clangs shut and leaves the world to darkness
and to me, and the drunken trooper, and the rat, and the
insects.</p>

<p>I shiver and wriggle and scratch and wonder whether
the assertive odour will conquer, or my proud stomach
rise victorious over... Yes, it is rising...
Victorious?... No...</p>

<p>Again the door opens and a trooper enters, thanking
the Sergeant of the Guard, in the politest terms, for
all his care and kindness. The Sergeant of the Guard, in
the impolitest terms, bids the trooper remove his canvas
trousers.</p>

<p>He does so, and confirms what the Sergeant had
feared&mdash;that he is wearing his uniform trousers beneath
them. The Sergeant of the Guard confiscates the nethermost
garments, consigns the prisoner to the nethermost regions,
gives him two extra days in this particular region, and
goes out.</p>

<p>As the door clangs, the new-comer strikes a match,
produces half a candle, lights it, and politely greets me
and the happy sleeper on the floor.</p>

<p>"Let us put this one to bed," he suggests, sticking his
candle on the pillow-shelf; and I arise, and we lift the
bibulous one from the hard floor to the harder, but less
damp and filthy, "bed."</p>

<p>Evidently a humane and kindly soul this. I stand
rebuked for my callousness in leaving the drunkard on the
ground.</p>

<p>But he does not carry these virtues to excess, for,
observing that the Bacchanal has been cast into prison in
his walking-out uniform (in which he was evidently brought
helpless into barracks), he removes the man's tunic, and
puts it on over his own canvas stable-jacket.</p>

<p>"The drunk feel nothing," he observes sententiously.
"Why should the sober feel cold?"</p>

<p>I no longer stand rebuked.</p>

<p>By the light of his candle, I study the pleasing black
hole in which we lie, its walls decorated by drawings,
poems, aphorisms, and <i>obiter dicta</i> which do not repay
study.</p>

<p>It is a reeking, damp and verminous cellar, some thirty
feet square, ventilated only by a single grated aperture,
high up in one of the walls, and is an unfit habitation for
a horse or dog.</p>

<p>In fact, Colonel du Plessis, our Commanding Officer,
would not have one of the horses here for an hour. But I am
here for fifteen days (save when doing punishment-drill)
and serve me jolly well right.</p>

<p>For I have <i>tir&eacute;e une bord&eacute;e</i>&mdash;absented
myself, without leave, for five days&mdash;the longest period
that one can be absent without becoming a deserter and
getting three years' hard labour as such.</p>

<p>Mind, I am not complaining in the very least. I knew
the penalty and accepted it. But there was a lady in the
case, the very one who had amused us with her remark
to de Lannec, anent a stingy Jew politician of her
acquaintance&mdash;"When a man with a Future visits a lady
with a Past, he should be thoughtful of the Present,
that it be acceptable&mdash;and expensive." She had written
to me, beseeching me in the name of old kindnesses, to
come quickly to Paris, and saying that she knew nothing
but Death would keep me from helping her in her terrible
need....</p>

<p>And Death stayed his hand until I had justified this
brave and witty little lady's faith; and now, after the
event, sends his fleas, and odours, and hideous cold too
late.... Dear little V&eacute;ronique Vaux!...</p>

<p>There is a great commotion without, and the candle
is instantly extinguished by its owner, who pinches the
wick.</p>

<p>Evidently one foolishly and futilely rebels against
Fate, and more foolishly and futilely resists the Guard.</p>

<p>The door opens and the victim is flung into the cell
with a tremendous crash. The Sergeant of the Guard makes
promises. The prisoner makes sounds and the sounds drown
the promises. He must be raging mad, fighting-drunk, and
full of vile cheap canteen-brandy.</p>

<p>The humane man re-lights his candle, and we see a huge
and powerful trooper gibbering in the corner.</p>

<p>What <i>he</i> sees is, apparently, a gathering of his
deadliest foes, for he draws a long and nasty knife from
the back of his trouser-belt, and, with a wild yell, makes
a rush for us.</p>

<p>The humane man promptly knocks the candle flying, and
leaps off the bed. I spring like a&mdash;well, <i>flea</i> is the
most appropriate simile, just here and now&mdash;in the opposite
direction, and take up an attitude of offensive defence,
and to anybody who steps in my direction I will give of my
best&mdash;where I think it will do most good....</p>

<p>Apparently the furious one has missed the humane one and
the Bacchanalian one, and has struck with such terrific
force as to drive his knife so deeply into the wood that he
cannot get it out again.</p>

<p>I am glad that my proud stomach, annoyed as I am with
it, was not between the knife and the bed....</p>

<p>And I had always supposed that life in prison was so
dull and full of <i>ennui</i>....</p>

<p class="first">
The violent one now weeps, the humane one snores, the
Bacchanalian one grunts chokingly, and I lie down again,
this time without my bread-bag.</p>

<p>Soon the cruel cold, the clammy damp, the wicked flea,
the furtive rat, the noisy odour, and the proud stomach
combine with the hard bench and aching bones to make me
wish that I were not a sick and dirty man starving in
prison.</p>

<p>And a few months ago I was at Eton!... It is all very
amusing....</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c102" id="c102"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>UNCLE</h3>

<p class="first">
Doubtless you wonder how a man may be an Etonian one
year and a trooper in a French Hussar Regiment the next.</p>

<p>I am a Frenchman, I am proud to say; but my dear mother,
God rest her soul, was an Englishwoman; and my father,
like myself, was a great admirer of England and of English
institutions. Hence my being sent to school at Eton.</p>

<p>On my father's death, soon after I had left school, my
uncle sent for me.</p>

<p>He was even then a General, the youngest in the
French Army, and his wife is the sister of an extremely
prominent and powerful politician, at that time&mdash;and again
since&mdash;Minister of State for War.</p>

<p>My uncle is fantastically patriotic, and <i>La France</i> is
his goddess. For her he would love to die, and for her he
would see everybody else die&mdash;even so agreeable a person as
myself. When his last moments come, he will be frightfully
sick if circumstances are not appropriate for him to say,
"<i>I die</i>&mdash;<i>that France may live</i>"&mdash;a difficult statement to
make convincingly, if you are sitting in a Bath chair at
ninety, and at Vichy or Aix.</p>

<p>He is also a really great soldier and a man of vision.
He has a mind that plans broadly, grasps tenaciously, sees
clearly.</p>

<p class="first">
Well, he sent for me, and, leaving my mother in
Devonshire, I hurried to Paris and, without even stopping
for <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner,</i> to his room at the War
Office.</p>

<p>Although I had spent all my holidays in France, I
had never seen him before, as he had been on foreign
service, and I found him to be my <i>beau id&eacute;al</i> of a
French General&mdash;tall, spare, hawk-like, a fierce dynamic
person.</p>

<p>He eyed me keenly, greeted me coldly, and
observed&mdash;"Since your father is spilt milk, as the English
say, it is useless to cry over him."</p>

<p>"Now," continued he, after this brief exordium, "you
are a Frenchman, the son of a Frenchman. Are you going to
renounce your glorious birth-right and live in England, or
are you going to be worthy of your honoured name?"</p>

<p>I replied that I was born a Frenchman, and that I should
live and die a Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Good," said my uncle. "In that case you will have to do
your military service.... Do it at once, and do it as I
shall direct....</p>

<p>"Someday I am going to be the master-builder in
consolidating an African Empire for France, and I shall
need tools <i>that will not turn in my hand....</i> Tools
on which I can rely <i>absolutely....</i> If you have
ambition, if you are a <i>man,</i> obey me and follow me. Help
me, and I will make you.... Fail me, and I will break
you...."</p>

<p>I stared and gaped like the imbecile that I sometimes
choose to appear.</p>

<p>My uncle rose from his desk and paced the room. Soon
I was forgotten, I think, as he gazed upon his splendid
Vision of the future, rather than on his splendid Nephew of
the present.</p>

<p>"France... France..." he murmured. "A mighty
Empire... Triumphant over her jealous greedy foes....
"England dominates all the east of Africa, but what of
the rest&mdash;from Egypt to the Atlantic, from Tangier to the
Gulf?... Morocco, the Sahara, the Soudan, all the vast
teeming West...</p>

<p>"Algeria we have, Tunisia, and corners here
and there.... It is not enough.... It is
nothing...."</p>

<p>I coughed and looked more imbecile.</p>

<p>"Menaced France," he continued, "with declining
birthrate and failing man-power... Germany only awaiting
<i>The Day....</i> Africa, an inexhaustible reservoir of the
finest fighting material in the world. The Sahara&mdash;with
irrigation, an inexhaustible reservoir of food...."</p>

<p>It was lunch-time, and I realized that I too needed
irrigation and would like to approach an inexhaustible
reservoir of food. If he were going to send me to the
Sahara, I would go at once. I looked intelligent, and
murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>rather,</i> Uncle!"</p>

<p>"France must expand or die," he continued. And I felt
that I was just like France in that respect.</p>

<p>"The Soudan," he went on, "could be made a very
Argentine of corn and cattle, a very Egypt of cotton&mdash;and
ah! those Soudanese! What soldiers for France!...</p>

<p>"The Bedouin must be tamed, the Touareg broken, the
Senussi won over.... <i>There</i> is where we want trained
emissaries&mdash;France's secret ambassadors at work among the
tribes...</p>

<p>"Shall the West come beneath the Tri-couleur of France,
or the Green Banner of Pan-Islamism?..."</p>

<p>At the moment I did not greatly care. The schemes of
irrigation and food-supply interested me more. Corn and
cattle... suitably prepared, and perhaps a little soup,
fish and chicken too....</p>

<p>"We must have safe Trans-Saharan Routes; and then
Engineering and Agricultural Science shall turn the desert
to a garden&mdash;France's great kitchen-garden. France's
orchard and cornfield. And the sun's very rays shall be
harnessed that their heat may provide France with the
greatest power-station in the world...."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Uncle," I said. Certainly France should have
the sun's rays if I might have lunch.</p>

<p>"But conquest first! Conquest by diplomacy....
Divide and rule&mdash;that Earth's poorest and emptiest place
may become its richest and fullest&mdash;and that France may
triumph...."</p>

<p>Selfishly I thought that if my poorest and emptiest
place could soon become the richest and fullest, <i>I</i> should
triumph....</p>

<p>"Now, Boy," concluded my uncle, ceasing his swift
pacing, and impaling me with a penetrating stare, "I will
try you, and I will give you such a chance to become
a Marshal of France as falls to few.... Listen. Go
to the Headquarters of the military division of the
<i>arrondissement</i> in which you were born, show your papers,
and enlist as a <i>Volontaire.</i> You will then have to serve
for only one year instead of the three compulsory for the
ordinary conscript&mdash;because you are the son of a widow,
have voluntarily enlisted before your time, and can pay the
<i>Volontaire's</i> fee of 1,500 francs.... I will see that
you are posted to the Blue Hussars, and you will do a year
in the ranks. You will never mention my name to a soul,
and you will be treated precisely as any other private
soldier....</p>

<p>"If you pass out with high marks at the end of the
period, come to me, and I will see that you go to Africa
with a commission in the Spahis, and your foot will be
on the ladder.... There, learn Arabic until you know
it better than your mother-tongue; and learn to know the
Arab better than you know yourself.... <i>Then</i> I can use
you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>yes,</i> Uncle," I dutifully responded, as he
paused.</p>

<p>"And some day&mdash;some day&mdash;I swear it&mdash;you will be one of
France's most valuable and valued servants, leading a life
of the deepest interest, highest usefulness and greatest
danger.... You will be tried as a cavalryman, tried as
a Spahi officer, tried as my aide-de-camp, tried as an
emissary, a negotiator, a Secret-Service officer, and will
get such a training as shall fit you to succeed me&mdash;and
<i>I</i> shall be a Marshal of France&mdash;and Commander-in-Chief
and Governor-General of the great African Empire of
France....</p>

<p>"But&mdash;fail in any way, at any one step or stage of
your career, and I have done with you.... Be worthy of
my trust, and I will make you one of France's greatest
servants.... And, mind, Boy&mdash;you will have to <i>ride
alone,</i> on the road that I shall open to you...." He
fell silent.</p>

<p>His fierce and fanatical face relaxed, a sweet smile
changed it wholly, and he held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Would you care to lunch with me, my boy?" he said
kindly.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;<i>lunch,</i> Uncle?" I replied. "Thank you&mdash;yes, I think I could manage a little lunch perhaps...."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c103" id="c103"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE BLUE HUSSAR</h3>

<p class="first">
Excellent! I would be worthy of this uncle of mine, and
I would devote my life to my country. (Incidentally I had
no objection to being made a Marshal of France, in due
course.)</p>

<p>I regarded myself as a most fortunate young man, for
all I had to do was my best. And I <i>was</i> lucky, beyond
belief&mdash;not only in having such an uncle behind me, but
in having an English education and an English training in
sports and games. I had won the Public Schools Championship
for boxing (Middle-weight) and for fencing as well. I was a
fine gymnast, I had ridden from childhood, and I possessed
perfect health and strength.</p>

<p>Being blessed with a cavalry figure, excellent
spirits, a perfect digestion, a love of adventure, and
an intense zest for Life, I felt that all was for the
best in the best of all possible worlds. As for "riding
alone"&mdash;excellent... <i>I</i> was not going to be the sort of
man that allows his career to be hampered by a woman!</p>


<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
A few weeks after applying at the proper military
headquarters, I received orders to appear before the
<i>Conseil de Revision</i> with my papers, at the Town Hall of
my native district; and, with a hundred or so other young
men of every social class and kind, was duly examined,
physically and mentally.</p>

<p>Soon after this, I received a notice directing me to
present myself at the cavalry barracks, to be examined in
equitation. If I failed in the test, I could not enter a
cavalry regiment as a one-year <i>Volontaire.</i></p>

<p>I passed all right, of course, and, a little later,
received my <i>feuille de route</i> and notification that I was
posted to the Blue Hussars and was to proceed forthwith to
their barracks at St. Denis, and report myself.</p>

<p>I had spent the interval, partly with my mother and her
people, the Carys; and partly in Paris with a Lieutenant
de Lannec, appointed my guide, philosopher and friend by
my uncle, under whom de Lannec was then working at the
War Office. To this gentleman I was indebted for much
good advice and innumerable hints and tips that proved
invaluable. Also for the friendship of the dear clever
little V&eacute;ronique Vaux, and, most of all, for that of
Raoul d'Auray de Redon, at a later date.</p>

<p>To de Lannec I owed it that if in my raw-recruit days I
was a fool, I was not a sanguinary fool; and that I escaped
most of the pit-falls digged for the feet of the unwary
by those who had themselves only become wary by painful
experience therein.</p>

<p>Thanks to him, I also knew enough to engage permanently
a private room for myself at a hotel in St. Denis, where I
could have meals and a bath; to have my cavalry boots and
uniform privately made for me; and to equip myself with a
spare complete outfit of all those articles of clothing
and of use, the loss or lack of which brings the private
soldier to so much trouble and punishment.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
And one fine morning I presented myself at the great
gates of the barracks of the famous Blue Hussars, trying to
look happier than I felt.</p>

<p>I beheld an enormous parade ground, about a quarter of
a mile square, with the Riding School in the middle of
it, and beyond it a huge barracks for men and horses. The
horses occupied the ground-floor and the men the floors
above&mdash;not a nice arrangement I thought. (I continued to
think it, when I lived just above the horses, in a room
that held a hundred and twenty unwashed men, a hundred and
twenty pairs of stable-boots, a hundred and twenty pairs of
never-cleaned blankets&mdash;and windows that had been kept shut
for a hundred and twenty years, to exclude the exhalations
from the stable (because more than enough came up through
the floor).</p>

<p>I passed through the gates, and a Sergeant came out from
the Guard-Room, which was just beside them.</p>

<p>"Hi, there! Where d'ye think you're going?" he
shouted.</p>

<p>"I have come to report myself, Sergeant," I replied
meekly, and produced my <i>feuille de route.</i></p>

<p>He looked at it.</p>

<p>"One of those anointed <i>Volontaires,</i> are you?" he
growled. "Well, my fine gentleman, I don't like them, d'you
understand?... And I don't like you.... I don't like
your face, nor your voice, nor your clothes, nor anything
about you. D'you see?..."</p>

<p>Mindful of de Lannec's advice, I held my tongue. It is
the one thing of his own that the soldier may hold. But a
good Sergeant is not to be defeated.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare to stand there and sulk, you dumb image
of a dead fish," he shouted.</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant," I replied.</p>

<p>"And don't you back-answer me either, you chattering
baboon," he roared.</p>

<p>"You have made a bad beginning," he went on menacingly,
before I could be either silent or responsive,
"and I'll see you make a bad end too, you pimply
<i>p&eacute;kin!...</i> Get out of this&mdash;go on&mdash;before
I..."</p>

<p>"But, Sergeant," I murmured, "I have come to
join..."</p>

<p>"You <i>will</i> interrupt me, will you?" he yelled. "That's
settled it! Wait till you're in uniform&mdash;and I'll show
you the inside of a little stone box I know of. That'll
teach you to contradict Sergeants.... Get out of this,
you insubordinate rascal&mdash;and take your <i>feuille de
route</i> to the Paymaster's Office in the <i>Rue des Enfants
Abandonn&eacute;s....</i> I'll deal with you when you come
back. Name of an Anointed Poodle, I will!..."</p>

<p>In silence I turned about and went in search of the <i>Rue
des Enfants Abandonn&eacute;s,</i> and the Paymaster's Office,
feeling that I was indeed going to begin at the bottom
of a fairly steep ladder, and to receive some valuable
discipline and training in self-control.</p>

<p>I believe that, for the fraction of a second, I was
tempted to seek the train for Calais and England, instead
of the Street of the Abandoned Children and the Office of
the Paymaster. (Were they Children of Abandoned Character,
or Children who had Been Abandoned by Others? Alas, I
knew not; but feeling something of a poor Abandoned Child
myself, I decided that it was the latter.)</p>

<p>Expecting otherwise, I found the non-commissioned
officer who was the Paymaster's Clerk, a courteous person.
He asked me which Squadron I would like to join, and I
replied that I should like to join any Squadron to which
the present Sergeant of the Guard did not belong.</p>

<p>"Who's he?" asked the clerk.</p>

<p>I described the Sergeant as a ruffianly brute with a
bristly moustache, bristly eyebrows, bristly hair, and
bristly manners. A bullying blackguard in fact.</p>

<p>"Any private to any Sergeant," smiled the clerk; "but
it sounds like Bl&uuml;m. Did he swear by the name of an
Anointed Poodle, by any chance?"</p>

<p>"That's the man," said I.</p>

<p>"Third Squadron. I'll put you down for the Second....
Take this paper and ask for the Sergeant-Major of the
Second Squadron. And don't forget that if you can stand
well with the S.S.M. and the <i>Adjudant</i> of your Squadron,
you'll be all right...."</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
On my return to the Barracks, I again encountered the
engaging Sergeant Bl&uuml;m at the Guard-Room by the
gates.</p>

<p>"To what Squadron are you drafted?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To the Second, Sergeant," I replied innocently.</p>

<p>"And that's the worst news I have heard this year," was
the reply. "I hoped you would be in the Third. I'd have had
you put in my own <i>peloton.</i> I have a way with aristocrats
and <i>Volontaires,</i> and <i>macquereaux....</i>"</p>

<p>"I did my best, Sergeant," I replied truthfully.</p>

<p>"<i>Tais donc ta sale gueule,</i>" he roared, and turning
into the Guard-Room, bade a trooper do some scavenging
work by removing me and taking me to the Office of the
Sergeant-Major of the Second Squadron.</p>

<p>I followed the trooper, a tall fair Norman, across the
great parade-ground, now alive with men in stable-kit,
carrying brooms or buckets, wheeling barrows, leading
horses, pumping water into great drinking-troughs,
and generally fulfilling the law of their being, as
cavalrymen.</p>

<p>"Come along, you gaping pig," said my guide, as I gazed
around the pleasing purlieus of my new home.</p>

<p>I came along.</p>

<p>"Hurry yourself, or I'll chuck you into the manure-heap,
after the S.S.M. has seen you," added my conducting
Virgil.</p>

<p>"Friend and brother-in-arms," said I, "let us go to the
manure-heap at once, and we'll see who goes on it.... I
don't know why you ever left it...."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you're one of those beastly <i>bullies,</i> are you?"
replied the trooper, and knocked at the door of a small
bare room which contained four beds, some military
accoutrements, a table, a chair, and the Squadron
Sergeant-Major, a small grey-haired man with an ascetic
lean face, and moustache of grey wire, neatly clipped.</p>

<p>This was a person of a type different altogether from
Sergeant Bl&uuml;m's. A dog that never barked, but bit
hard, Sergeant-Major Martin was a cold stern man, forceful
and fierce, but in manner quiet, distant, and almost
polite.</p>

<p>"A <i>Volontaire!</i>" he said. "A pity. One does not like
them, but such things must be...."</p>

<p>He took my papers, asked me questions, and recorded the
answers in the <i>livret</i> or regimental-book, which every
French soldier must cherish. He then bade the trooper
conduct me to Sergeant de Poncey with the bad news that I
was to be in his <i>peloton.</i></p>

<p>"Follow me, bully," said the trooper after he
had saluted the Sergeant-Major and wheeled from the
room....</p>

<p>Sergeant de Poncey was discovered in the exercise of his
duty, giving painful sword-drill to a punishment-squad,
outside the Riding School. He was a handsome man who looked
as though life held nothing for him but pain. His voice was
that of an educated man.</p>

<p>The troopers, clad in canvas uniform and clogs, looked
desperately miserable.</p>

<p>They had cause, since they had spent the night in
prison, had had no breakfast, and were undergoing a kind of
torture. The Sergeant would give an order, the squad would
obey it, and there the matter would rest&mdash;until some poor
devil, sick and half-starved, would be unable to keep his
arm, and heavy sword, extended any longer. At the first
quiver and sinking down of the blade, the monotonous voice
would announce:</p>

<p>"Trooper Ponthieu, two more days <i>salle de police,</i>
for not keeping still," and a new order would be given
for a fresh form of grief, and another punishment to the
weakest.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;they were there for punishment, and they were
certainly getting it.</p>

<p>When the squad had been marched back to prison, Sergeant
de Poncey attended to me. He looked me over from head to
foot.</p>

<p>"A gentleman," said he. "Good! I was one myself, once.
Come with me," and he led the way to the <i>quartiers</i> of
the Second Squadron, and the part of the room in which his
<i>peloton</i> slept.</p>

<p>Two partitions, some eight feet in height, divided
the room into three, and along partitions and walls were
rows of beds. Each bed was so narrow that there was no
discomfort in eating one's meals as one sat astride the
bed, as though seated on a horse, with a basin of <i>soupe</i>
before one. It was thus that, for a year, I took all meals
that I did not have at my hotel.</p>

<p>At the head of each bed hung a cavalry-sword and bag of
stable-brushes and cleaning-kit; while above each were a
couple of shelves bearing folded uniforms covered with a
canvas bag on which was painted their owner's <i>matricule</i>
number. Crowning each edifice was a <i>shako</i> and two pairs
of boots. Cavalry carbines stood in racks in the corners
of the room.... As I stared round, the Sergeant put his
hand on my arm.</p>

<p>"You'll have a rough time here," he said. "Your only
chance will be to be rougher than the time."</p>

<p>"I am going to be a real rough, Sergeant," I smiled. I
liked this Sergeant de Poncey from the first.</p>

<p>"The worst of it is that it <i>stays,</i> my son," replied
Sergeant de Poncey. "Habit becomes second nature&mdash;and then
first nature. As I told you, I was a gentleman once; and
now I am going to ask you to lend me twenty francs, for I
am in serious trouble.... Will you?"</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant," I said, and his unhappy face darkened
with pain and annoyance. "I am going to give you a hundred,
if I may.... Will you?"</p>

<p>"You'll have a friend in me," was the reply, and the
poor fellow positively flushed&mdash;I supposed with mingled
emotions of gratitude, relief and discomfort.</p>

<p>And a good friend Sergeant de Poncey proved, and
particularly valuable after he became Sergeant-Major;
for though a Sergeant-Major may not have power to permit
certain doings, he has complete power to prevent Higher
Authority from knowing that they have been done....</p>

<p>A Corporal entering the room at that minute, Sergeant
de Poncey called him and handed me over to him with the
words:</p>

<p>"A recruit for your <i>escouade,</i> Lepage. A
<i>Volontaire</i>&mdash;but a good fellow. Old friend of mine....
See?"</p>

<p>The Corporal saw. He had good eyesight; for the moment
Sergeant de Poncey was out of earshot, he added:</p>

<p>"Come and be an 'old friend' of mine too," and
led the way out of the <i>quartiers,</i> across the great
barrack-square, to the canteen.</p>

<p>Cheaply and greasily handsome, the swarthy Corporal
Lepage was a very wicked little man indeed, but likeable,
by reason of an unfailing sense of humour and a paradoxical
trustworthiness. He had every vice and would do any evil
thing&mdash;except betray a trust or fail a friend. Half
educated, he was a clerk by profession, and an ornament of
the city of Paris. Small, dissipated and drunken, he yet
had remarkable strength and agility, and was never ill.</p>

<p>In the canteen he drank neat cognac at my expense, and
frankly said that his goodwill and kind offices could be
purchased for ten francs. I purchased them, and, having
pouched the gold piece and swallowed his seventh cognac,
the worthy man inquired whether I intended to jabber there
the <i>entire</i> day, or go to the medical inspection to which
he was endeavouring to conduct me.</p>

<p>"This is the first I have heard of it, Corporal," I
protested.</p>

<p>"Well, it won't be the last, Mr. Snipe, unless you
obey my orders and cease this taverning, chambering and
wantonness," replied the good Lepage. "Hurry, you idle
apprentice and worthless <i>Volontaire.</i>"</p>

<p>I hurried.</p>

<p>Pulling himself together, Corporal Lepage marched me
from the canteen to the dispensary near by.</p>

<p>The place was empty save for an Orderly.</p>

<p>"Surgeon-Major not come yet, Corporal," said the man.</p>

<p>Lepage turned upon me.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll let me finish my coffee in peace another
time," he said, in apparent wrath, and displaying sharp
little teeth beneath his waxed moustache. "Come back and do
your duty."</p>

<p>And promising the Orderly that <i>I</i> would give him a
cognac if he came and called the Corporal from the canteen
as soon as the Surgeon-Major returned, he led the way
back.</p>

<p>In the end, I left Corporal Lepage drunk in the canteen,
passed the medical examination, and made myself a friend
for life by returning and getting the uplifted warrior
safely back to the barrack-room and bed.</p>

<p>An amusing morning.</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">
I shall never forget being tailored by the
<i>Sergent-Fourrier</i> that afternoon. His store was
a kind of mighty shop in which the Regimental
Sergeant-Tailor, Sergeant-Bootmaker Sergeant-Saddler and
Sergeant-Storekeeper were his shop-assistants.</p>

<p>Here I was given a pair of red trousers to try on&mdash;"for
size." They were as stiff, as heavy, and nearly as big, as
a diver's suit and clogs, and from the knees downwards were
of solid leather.</p>

<p>They were not riding-breeches, but huge trousers, the
legs being each as big round as my waist. As in the case of
an axiom of Euclid, no demonstration was needed, but since
the Sergeant-Tailor bade me get into them&mdash;I got.</p>

<p>When the heavy leather ends of them rested on the
ground, the top cut me under the arm-pits. The top of that
inch-thick, red felt garment, hard and stiff as a board,
literally cut me.</p>

<p>I looked over the edge and smiled at the
Sergeant-Tailor.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, "<i>excellent,</i>" and handed me a blue
tunic to try on, "for size." The only faults in this case
were that my hands were invisible within the sleeves, and
that I could put my chin inside the collar after it had
been hooked. I flapped my wings at the Sergeant-Tailor.</p>

<p>"Yes, you go into that nicely, too," he said, and he was
quite right. That there was room for him, as well, did not
seem to be of importance.</p>

<p>The difficulty now was to move, as the trousers seemed
to be like jointless armour, but I struggled across the
store to where sat the Sergeant-Bootmaker, with an entire
range of boots of all sizes awaiting me. The "entire range"
consisted of four pairs, and of these the smallest was two
inches too long, but would not permit the passage of my
instep.</p>

<p>They were curious leather buildings, these alleged
boots. They were as wide as they were long, were perfectly
square at both ends, had a leg a foot high, heels two and a
half inches thick, and great rusty spurs nailed on to them.
The idea was to put them on under the trousers. "You've got
deformed feet, oh, <i>esp&egrave;ce d'imb&eacute;cile,</i>" said
the Sergeant-Bootmaker, when his complete range of four
sizes had produced nothing suitable. "You ought not to be
in the army. The likes of you are a curse and an undeserved
punishment to good Sergeants, you orphaned Misfortune of
God.... Put on the biggest pair...."</p>

<p>"But, Sergeant," I protested, "they are exactly five
inches longer than my feet!"</p>

<p>"And is straw so dear in a cavalry regiment that you
cannot stuff the toes with it, Most Complete Idiot?"
inquired the man of ideas.</p>

<p>"But they'd simply fall off my feet if I tried to walk
in them," I pointed out.</p>

<p>"And will not the straps of your trousers, that go
underneath the boots, keep the boots on your feet, Most
Polished and Perfected Idiot?" replied this prince of
bootmakers. "And the trousers will hide the fact that the
boots are a little large."</p>

<p>As all I had to do was to get from the barracks to my
hotel, where I had everything awaiting me, it did not so
much matter. But what of the poor devil who had to accept
such things without alternative?</p>

<p>When I was standing precariously balanced inside these
boots and garments, the <i>Sergent-Fourrier</i> gave me a Hussar
shako which my ears insecurely supported; wound a blue
scarf round my neck, inside the collar of the tunic, and
bade me go and show myself to the Captain of the Week&mdash;who
was incidentally <i>Capitaine en Second</i> of my Squadron.</p>

<p>Dressed as I was, I would not willingly have shown
myself to a mule, lest the poor animal laugh itself into a
state of dangerous hysteria.</p>

<p>Walking as a diver walks along the deck of a ship,
I plunged heavily forward, lifting and dropping a huge
boot, that hung at the end of a huge trouser-leg, at each
step.</p>

<p>It was more like the progression of a hobbled
clown-elephant over the tan of a circus, than the marching
of a smart Hussar. I felt very foolish, humiliated and
angry.</p>

<p>Guided by a storeroom Orderly, I eventually reached the
door of the Captain's office, and burst upon his sight.</p>

<p>I do not know what I expected him to do. He did not
faint, nor call upon Heaven for strength.</p>

<p>He eyed me as one does a horse offered for sale. He
was of the younger school&mdash;smart, cool and efficient;
a handsome, spare man, pink and white above a shaven
blueness. In manner he was of a suavely sinister politeness
that thinly covered real cruelty.</p>

<p>"Take off that tunic," he said.</p>

<p>I obeyed with alacrity.</p>

<p>"Yes, the trousers are too short," he observed, and
added: "Are you a natural fool, that you come before me
with trousers that are too short?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, mon Capitaine,</i>" I replied. I felt I <i>was</i> a
natural fool, to be there in those, or in any other,
trousers.</p>

<p>"And look at your boots. Each is big enough to contain
both your feet. Are you an <i>un</i>natural fool to come before
me in such boots?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, mon Capitaine,</i>" I replied. I felt I <i>was</i> an
unnatural fool, to be there in those, or in any other,
boots.</p>

<p>"I will make a note of it, recruit," said the officer,
and I felt he had said more than any roaring Sergeant,
shouting definite promises of definite punishments.</p>

<p>"Have the goodness to go," he continued in his
silky-steely voice, "and return in trousers twice as large
and boots half as big. You may tell the <i>Sergent-Fourrier</i>
that he will shortly hear something to his
disadvantage.... It will interest him in you...."</p>

<p>It did. It interested all the denizens of that horrible
storeroom, that stank of stale leather, stale fustian,
stale brass, and stale people.</p>

<p>("I would get them into trouble, would I?... I would
bring reprimands and punishments upon senior Sergeants,
would I?... Oh, Ho! and Ah, Ha! Let me but wait until I
was in their hands... !")</p>

<p>A little later, I was sent back to the Captain's room,
in the identical clothes that I had worn on the first
visit. My trousers were braced to my chin, the leather ends
of the legs were pulled further forward over the boots,
a piece of cloth was folded and pushed up the back of my
tunic, my sleeves were pulled back, and a fold or tuck of
the cloth was made inside each elbow. A crushed-up ball of
brown paper relieved my ears of some of the weight of my
shako.</p>

<p>"You come back here again, unpassed by the Captain, and
I swear I'll have you in prison within the week," promised
the <i>Sergent-Fourrier.</i></p>

<p>I thanked him and shuffled back.</p>

<p>My Captain eyed me blandly across the table, as I
saluted.</p>

<p>"Trousers are now too big," he observed, "and the
tunic too small. Are you <i>really</i> determined to annoy
me, recruit?" he added. "If so, I must take steps
to protect myself.... Kindly return and inform
the <i>Sergent-Fourrier</i> that I will interview him
later...."</p>

<p>Pending that time, the <i>Sergent-Fourrier</i> and his
myrmidons interviewed <i>me.</i> They also sent me back in
precisely the same garments; this time with trousers braced
only to my breast and with the sleeves of my tunic as they
had been at first.</p>

<p>My Captain was not in his room, and I promptly returned
and told the truth&mdash;that he had found no fault in me this
time....</p>

<p>Eventually I dragged my leaden-footed, swaddled,
creaking carcase from the store, burdened with an extra
tunic, an extra pair of incredible trousers, an extra pair
of impossible boots, a drill-jacket, a <i>k&eacute;pi,</i> two
canvas stable-suits, an overcoat, a huge cape, two pairs
of thick white leather gauntlets big enough for Goliath of
Gath, two terrible shirts, two pairs of pants, a huge pair
of clogs, and no socks at all.</p>

<p>Much of this impedimenta was stuffed into a big canvas
bag.</p>

<p>With this on my back, and looking like Bunyan's
<i>Christian</i> and feeling like no kind of Christian, I
staggered to my room.</p>

<p>Here, Corporal Lepage, in a discourse punctuated with
brandified hiccups, informed me that I must mark each
article with my <i>matricule</i> number, using for that purpose
stencils supplied by the <i>Sergent-Fourrier.</i></p>

<p>Feeling that more than stencils would be supplied by
that choleric and unsocial person, if I again encountered
him ere the sun had gone down upon his wrath, I bethought
me of certain advice given me in Paris by my friend de
Lannec&mdash;and cast about for one in search of lucrative
employment.</p>

<p>Seated on the next bed to mine, and polishing his sword,
was a likely-looking lad. He had a strong and pleasing
face, calm and thoughtful in expression, and with a nice
fresh air of countrified health.</p>

<p>"Here, comrade," said I, "do you want a job and a franc
or two?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he replied, "or two jobs and a franc or
three... I am badly broke, and I am also in peculiar and
particular need to square Corporal Lepage."</p>

<p>I found that his name was Dufour, that he was the son
of a horse-dealer, and had had to do with both horses and
gentlemen to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>From that hour he became my friend and servant, to
the day when he gave his life for France and for me,
nearly twenty years later. He was very clever, honest and
extremely brave; a faithful, loyal, noble soul.</p>

<p>I engaged him then and there; and his first job in my
service was to get my kit stencilled, cleaned and arranged
<i>en paquetage</i> on the shelves.</p>

<p>He then helped me to make myself as presentable as was
possible in the appalling uniform that had been issued to
me, for I had to pass the Guard (and in full dress, as it
was now noon) in order to get out to my hotel where my
other uniforms, well cut by my own tailor, were awaiting
me, together with boots of regulation pattern, made for me
in Paris.</p>

<p>To this day I do not know how I managed to waddle past
the Sergeant of the Guard, my sword held in a gloved hand
that felt as though cased in cast iron, my big shako
wobbling on my head, and the clumsy spurs of my vast and
uncontrollable boots catching in the leather ends of my
vaster trousers.</p>

<p>I did it however, with Dufour's help; and, a few minutes
later, was in my own private room and tearing the vile
things from my outraged person.</p>

<p>As I sat over my coffee, at a quarter to nine that
evening, after a tolerable dinner and a bottle of <i>Mouton
Rothschild,</i> dreaming great dreams, I was brought back to
hard facts by the sudden sound of the trumpeters of the
Blue Hussars playing the <i>retraite</i> in the <i>Place.</i></p>

<p>That meant that, within a quarter of an hour, they
would march thence back to Barracks, blowing their instant
summons to all soldiers who had not a late pass&mdash;and that I
must hurry.</p>

<p>My return journey was a very different one from my last,
for my uniform, boots, and shako fitted me perfectly; my
gauntlets enabled me to carry my sword easily ("<i>in left
hand; hilt turned downwards and six inches behind hip; tip
of scabbard in front of left foot</i>," etc.), and feeling
that I could salute any officer or non-commissioned officer
otherwise than by flapping a half-empty sleeve at him.</p>

<p>Once more I felt like a man and almost like a soldier.
My spirits rose nearly to the old Eton level.</p>

<p>They sank to the new Barrack level, however, when I
entered the room in which I was to live for a year, and
its terrific and terrible stench took me by the throat.
As I stood at the foot of my bed, as everybody else did,
awaiting the evening roll-call, I began to think I should
be violently unwell; and by the time the Sergeant of the
Week had made his round and received the Corporal's report
as to absentees (stables, guard, leave, etc.) I was feeling
certain that I must publicly disgrace myself.</p>

<p>However, I am a good sailor, and when the roll-call
(which has no "calling" whatever) was finished, and all
were free to do as they liked until ten o'clock, when the
"<i>Lights out</i>" trumpet would be blown, I fled to the outer
air, and saved my honour and my dinner.</p>

<p>I had to return, of course, but not to stand to
attention like a statue while my head swam; and I
soon found that I could support life with the help of
a handkerchief which I had had the fore-thought to
perfume.</p>

<p>While I was sitting on my bed (which consisted of two
trestles supporting two narrow planks, and a sausage-like
roll of straw-mattress and blankets, the whole being only
two feet six inches wide), gazing blankly around upon
the specimen of my fellow-man in bulk, and wondering if
and when and where he washed, I was aware of a party
approaching me, headed by the fair trooper who had been my
guide to the office of the Squadron Sergeant-Major that
morning.</p>

<p>"That is it," said their leader, pointing to me.
"It is a <i>Volontaire.</i> It is dangerous too. A dreadful
bully. Tried to throw me into the muck-heap when I wasn't
looking..."</p>

<p>"Behold it," said a short, square, swarthy man, who
looked, in spite of much fat, very powerful. "Regard it. It
uses a scented handkerchief so as not to smell us."</p>

<p>"Well, we are not roses. Why <i>should</i> he smell us?" put
in a little rat-like villain, edging forward.</p>

<p>He and the fat man were pushed aside by a typical
hard-case fighting-man, such as one sees in boxing-booths,
fencing-schools and gymnasia.</p>

<p>"See, <i>Volontaire</i>," he said, "you have insulted the
Blue Hussars in the person of Trooper Mornec and by using a
handkerchief in our presence. I am the champion swordsman
of the Regiment, and I say that such insults can only be
washed out in..."</p>

<p>"Blood," said I, reaching for my sword.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;<i>wine</i>," roared the gang as one man, and, rising, I
put one arm through that of the champion swordsman and the
other through that of Trooper Mornec, and we three headed a
joyous procession to the canteen, where we solemnly danced
the <i>can-can</i> with spirit and abandon.</p>

<p>I should think that the whole of my <i>peloton</i> (three
<i>escouades</i> of ten men each) was present by the time we
reached the bar, and it was there quickly enriched by the
presence of the rest of the Squadron.</p>

<p>However, brandy was only a shilling a quart, and red
wine fourpence, so it was no very serious matter to
entertain these good fellows, nor was there any fear that
their capacity to pour in would exceed mine to pay out.</p>

<p>But, upon my word, I think the combined smells of the
canteen&mdash;rank tobacco-smoke, garlic, spirits, cooking,
frying onions, wine, burning fat and packed humanity&mdash;were
worse than those of the barrack-room; and it was borne in
upon me that not only must the soldier's heart be in the
right place, but his stomach also....</p>

<p>The "<i>Lights out</i>" trumpet saved me from death in the
canteen, and I returned to die in the barrack-room, if I
must.</p>

<p>Apparently I returned a highly popular person, for none
of the usual tricks was played upon me, such as the jerking
away (by means of a rope) of one of the trestles supporting
the bed, as soon as the recruit has forgotten his sorrows
in sleep.</p>

<p>De Lannec had told me what to expect, and I had decided
to submit to most of the inflictions with a good grace and
cheerful spirit, while certain possible indignities I was
determined to resist to the point of serious bloodshed.</p>

<p>With Dufour's help, I inserted my person into the
sausage precariously balanced on the planks, and fell
asleep in spite of sharp-pointed straws, the impossibility
of turning in my cocoon, the noisy illness of several
gentlemen who had spent the evening unwisely, the stamping
and chain-rattling of horses, the cavalry-trumpet snoring
of a hundred cavalry noses, and the firm belief that I
should in the morning be found dead from poisoning and
asphyxiation.</p>

<p>All very amusing....</p>

<h2><a name="c104" id="c104">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h3>A PERFECT DAY</h3>

<p class="first">
I found myself quite alive, however, at five o'clock the
next morning, when the Corporal of the Week passed through
the room bawling, "Anyone sick here?"</p>

<p>I was about to reply that although I was not being
sick at the moment, I feared I shortly should be, when I
realized that the Corporal was collecting names for the
Sergeant-Major's morning report, and not making polite
inquiries as to how we were feeling after a night spent
in the most mephitic atmosphere that human beings could
possibly breathe, and live.</p>

<p>There is no morning roll-call in the Cavalry, but the
Sergeant-Major gets the names of those who apply for
medical attention, and removes them from the duty-list of
each <i>peloton.</i></p>

<p>For half an hour I lay awake wondering what would
happen if I sprang from my bed and opened a window&mdash;or
broke a window if they were not made for opening. I was on
the point of making this interesting discovery when the
<i>reveill&eacute;</i> trumpets rang out, in the square below,
and I was free to leave my bed&mdash;at five-thirty of a bitter
cold morning.</p>

<p>Corporal Lepage came to me as I repressed my first yawn
(fearing to inhale the poison-gas unnecessarily) and bade
me endue my form with canvas and clogs, and hie me to the
stables.</p>

<p>Hastily I put on the garb of a gutter-scavenger and
guided by Dufour, hurried through the rain to my pleasing
task.</p>

<p>In the stable was a different smell, but it was
homogeneous and, on the whole, I preferred the smell of
the horses to that of their riders. (You see, we clean
the horses thoroughly, daily. In the Regulations it is so
ordered. But as to the horsemen, it says, "<i>A Corporal must
sleep in the same room with the troopers of his escouade
and must see that his troopers wash their heads, faces,
hands and feet</i>." This much would be something, at any
rate, if only he carried out the Regulations.)</p>

<p>At the stables I received my first military order.</p>

<p>"Clean the straw under those four horses," said the
Sergeant on stable-duty.</p>

<p>An unpleasing but necessary work.</p>

<p>Some one had to do it, and why not I? Doubtless the
study of the art of separation of filthy straw from
filthier straw, and the removal of manure, is part of a
sound military training.</p>

<p>I looked round for implements. I believed that a
pitchfork and shovel were the appropriate and provided
tools for the craftsman in this line of business.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you gaping at? You..." inquired
the Sergeant, with more liberty of speech than fraternity
or equality.</p>

<p>"What shall I do it with, Sergeant?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Heaven help me from killing it!" he moaned, and
then roared: "Have you no <i>hands,</i> Village Idiot? D'you
suppose you do it with your toe-nails, or the back of your
neck?"</p>

<p>And it was so. With my lily-white hands I laboured well
and truly, and loaded barrows until they were piled high.
I took an artistic interest in my work, patting a shapely
pyramid upon the barrow, until:</p>

<p>"Dufour," I said, "I am going to be so <i>very</i> sick.
What's the punishment?..."</p>

<p>The good Dufour glanced hastily around.</p>

<p>"Run to the canteen," he whispered. "I can do the eight
stalls easy. Have a hot coffee and cognac."</p>

<p>I picked up a bucket and rushed forth across the
barrack-square, trying to look like one fulfilling a high
and honourable function. If anybody stopped me, I would say
I was going to get the Colonel a bucket of champagne for
his bath....</p>

<p>At the canteen I found a man following a new profession.
He called himself a Saviour-from-Selfish-Sin, and explained
to me that the basest thing a soldier could do was to
<i>faire Suisse,</i> to drink alone.</p>

<p>No one need drink alone when <i>he</i> was there, he said,
and he gave up his valuable time and energy to frequenting
the canteen at such hours as it might be empty, and a man
might come and fall into sin.</p>

<p>I drank my coffee and cognac and then went outside,
inhaled deeply for some minutes, and soon felt better.
Catching up my bucket, I returned to the stables, trying
to look like one who has, by prompt and determined effort,
saved the Republic.</p>

<p>Dufour finished our work and told me we must now
return to the barrack-room in time to get our bags of
grooming-implements before the trumpets sounded "<i>Stables</i>"
at six o'clock.</p>

<p>"You begin on the horse that's given you, sir," said
Dufour, "and as soon as the Sergeant's back is turned,
clear out again, and I'll finish for you."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," I replied. "I shall be able to groom
a horse all right. It was loading those barrows with my
bare hands that made me feel so sea-sick."</p>

<p>"You'll get used to it," Dufour assured me.</p>

<p>But I doubted it. "Use is second nature," as de Poncey
said, but I did not think it would become my second
nature to scavenge with my bare hands.... Nor my
third....</p>

<p>At six o'clock we returned to the stables, and the
Lieutenant of the Week allotted me my horse and ordered me
to set about grooming him.</p>

<p>Now I have the horse-gift. I love and understand horses,
and horses love and understand me. I was not, therefore,
depressed when the horse laid his ears back, showed me
a white eye, and lashed out viciously as I approached
the stall. It merely meant that the poor brute had been
mishandled by a bigger brute, and that fear, instead of
love, had been the motive appealed to.</p>

<p>However, I had got to make friends with him before
he could be friendly, and the first step was to enter
his stall&mdash;a thing he seemed determined to prevent. I
accordingly slipped into the next one, climbed over, and
dropped down beside him. In a minute I was grooming him,
talking to him, handling him, making much of him, and
winning his confidence.</p>

<p>I swore to myself I would never touch him with whip
nor spur: for whip and spur had been his trouble. He was
a well-bred beast, and I felt certain from his colour,
socks, head, eye and general "feel" that he was not really
vicious. I don't know how I know what a horse thinks and
feels and <i>is,</i> but I do know it.</p>

<p>I groomed him thoroughly for nearly an hour, and then
fondled him and got him used to my voice, hands and smell.
I rather expected trouble when I took him to water, as
Dufour had put his head round the partition and warned me
that <i>Le Boucher</i> was a dangerous brute who had sent more
than one man on a stretcher to hospital.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock the order was given for the horses to
be taken to the water-troughs, and I led <i>Le Boucher</i> out
of his stall. Seizing a lock of his mane, I vaulted on to
his bare back and prepared for trouble.</p>

<p>He reared until I thought he would fall; he put down
his head and threw up his heels until I thought that <i>I</i>
should; and then he bucked and bounded in a way that
enabled me to give an exhibition of riding.</p>

<p>But it was all half-hearted. I felt that he was going
through the performance mechanically, and, at worst,
finding out what sort of rider I was.</p>

<p>After this brief period of protest he trotted off to the
watering-tank, and I never again had the slightest trouble
with <i>Le Boucher.</i> I soon changed the stupid name of "The
Butcher," to "Angelique," partly in tribute to one of the
nicest of girls, and partly in recognition of the horse's
real temper and disposition....</p>

<p class="first">
After "Stables," I was sent to get the rest of my
kit, and was endowed with carbine, saddle, sword-belt,
cartridge-box and all sorts of straps and trappings. I
found my saddle to be of English make and with a high
straight back, behind which was strapped the cylindrical
blue portmanteau, with the regimental crest at each end.</p>

<p>I also found that the bridle was of the English model,
not the "9th Lancer" pattern, but with bit and snaffle so
made that the head-stall remained on the horse when the
bit-straps were taken off.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock by the time that I had received the
whole of the kit for myself and horse, and that is the hour
of breakfast. Our trumpets sang "<i>Soupe</i>" and the bucket
was lowered from the hand of the soldier who crossed the
wide plain&mdash;of the barrack-square.</p>

<p>Everybody rushed to put away whatever he held in
his hand, and to join the throng that poured into the
Regimental kitchen and out by another door, each man
bearing a <i>gamelle</i> (or saucepan-shaped tin pot), of
<i>soupe</i> and a loaf of bread. Having washed my hands,
without soap, at the horse-trough, I followed.</p>

<p>Holding my own, I proceeded to my room, placed it on my
bed, sat astride the bed with the <i>gamelle</i> before me, and
fell to.</p>

<p>It wasn't at all bad, and I was very hungry in spite of
my previous nausea.</p>

<p>The meal finished, the Orderly of the <i>Caporal
d'Ordinaire</i> collected the pots and took them back to the
kitchen.</p>

<p>My immediate desire now was a hot-and-cold-water
lavatory and a good barber. It was the first day of my
life that had found me, at eleven o'clock, unwashen and
uncombed, to say nothing of unbathed. At the moment
I wanted a shave more ardently than I wanted eternal
salvation.</p>

<p>"And now, where is the lavatory, Dufour?" I asked,
as that youth stowed away his spare bread behind his
<i>paquetage.</i></p>

<p>"Beside the forage-store, sir," he replied, "and it is
a grain-store itself. There is an old Sergeant-pensioner
at the hospital, who remembers the day, before the
Franco-Prussian War, when it was used as a lavatory, but
no one else has ever seen anything in it but sacks of
corn."</p>

<p>"Isn't washing compulsory, then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. In the summer, all have to go, once a fortnight,
to the swimming-baths," was the interesting reply.</p>

<p>"Do people ever wash voluntarily?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Dufour. "Men going on guard, or on
parade, often wash their faces, and there are many who wash
their hands and necks as well, on Sundays, or when they go
out with their girls.... You must not think we are dirty
people...."</p>

<p>"No," said I. "And where can this be done?"</p>

<p>"Oh, under the pump, whenever you like," was the reply,
and I found that it was the unsullied truth.</p>

<p>No one was hindered from washing under the pump, if he
wished to do such a thing....</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock, Corporal Lepage sent me to join the
Medical-Inspection Squad, as I must be vaccinated.</p>

<p>After that operation, dubiously beneficial by reason
of the probability of one's contracting tetanus or other
sorrows as well as immunity from smallpox, I returned to my
bright home to deal with the chaos of kit that adorned my
bed-side; and with Dufour's help had it reduced to order
and cleanliness by three in the afternoon, when "<i>Stables</i>"
was again the pursuit in being.</p>

<p>After "Stables" we stood in solemn circles around our
respective <i>Caporaux-fourriers</i> to hear the Regimental
Orders of the Day read out, while Squadron Sergeant-Majors
eyed everybody with profound suspicion and sure conviction
of their state of sin.</p>

<p>So far as I could make out, the Regimental Orders of
that particular day consisted of a list of punishments
inflicted upon all and sundry (for every conceivable, and
many an inconceivable, military offence), including the
officers themselves&mdash;which surprised me.</p>

<p>So far as I remember, the sort of thing was:</p>

<p>"<i>Chef d'Escadron</i> de Montreson, fifteen days'
<i>arr&ecirc;ts de rigueur</i> for being drunk and disorderly in
the town last night.</p>

<p>"<i>Capitaine Instructeur</i> Robert, eight days'
<i>arr&ecirc;ts simples</i> for over-staying leave and returning
with uniform in untidy condition.</p>

<p>"<i>Adjudant</i> Petit, four days' confinement to room for
allowing that room to be untidy.</p>

<p>"<i>Trooper</i> Leduc, eight days' <i>salle de police</i>
for looking resentful when given four days' <i>salle de
police.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Trooper</i> Blanc, eight days' <i>salle de police</i> for
possessing and reading a newspaper in <i>quartiers.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Trooper</i> Delamer, thirty days' extra <i>salle de police</i>
from the Colonel for having received sixteen days' extra
<i>salle de police</i> from his Captain because he had received
four days' extra <i>salle de police</i> from Sergeant Bl&uuml;m,
who caught him sleeping in the stables when he should have
been sleeping in the <i>salle de police.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Trooper</i> Mangeur, eight days' confinement to Barracks
for smiling when given four days' Inspection with the Guard
Parade."</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>When the joyous parade was finished, I was free, and
having cleaned and beautified myself, I passed the Sergeant
of the Guard in full-dress uniform, and sought mine inn for
dinner, peace, and privacy.</p>

<p>But oh! how my heart ached for any poor soul who, being
gently nurtured, had to remain in that horrible place for
three years, and without the privilege, even if he could
afford it, of a private place to which he could retire to
bathe and eat, to rest and be alone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c105" id="c105"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>BECQUE&mdash;AND RAOUL D'AURAY DE REDON</h3>

<p class="first">
I settled into the routine of my new life very quickly,
and it was not long before I felt it was as though I had
known no other.</p>

<p>At times I came near to desperation, but not so near
as I should have come had it not been for my private room
at the hotel, the fact that I did much of my work with
other <i>Volontaires</i> in a special class, and the one great
certainty, in a world of uncertainty, that there are only
twelve months in a year.</p>

<p>From 6.30 to 8 we <i>Volontaires</i> were in "school"; from
8 to 10 we drilled on foot; from 10 to 11 we breakfasted;
from 11 to 12 we were at school again; from 12 to 1 we had
gymnastics; from 1 to 2 <i>voltige</i> (as though we were going
to be circus riders); from 2.30 to 5 "school" once more;
from 5 to 6 dinner; from 6 to 8 mounted drill&mdash;and, after
that, kit-cleaning!</p>

<p>It was some time before my days grew monotonous, and
shortly after they had begun to do so, I contrived to
brighten the tedium of life by pretending to kill a man,
deliberately, in cold blood, and with cold steel. I fear I
give the impression of being a bloodthirsty and murderous
youth, and I contend that at the time I had good reason.</p>

<p>It happened like this.</p>

<p>Dufour came to me one night as I was undressing for bed,
and asked me whether I would care to spend an interesting
evening on the morrow.</p>

<p>Upon inquiry it turned out that he had been approached
by a certain Trooper Becque, a few days earlier, and
invited to spend a jolly evening with him and some other
good fellows.</p>

<p>Having accepted the invitation, Dufour found that
Becque and the good fellows were a kind of club or society
that met in a room above a little wine-shop in the Rue de
Salm.</p>

<p>Becque seemed to have plenty of money and plenty of
ideas&mdash;of an interesting and curious kind. Gradually
it dawned upon the intrigued Dufour that Becque was an
"agent," a Man with a Message, a propagandist, and an
agitator.</p>

<p>Apparently his object was to "agitate" the Regiment, and
his Message was that Law and Order were invented by knaves
for the enslavement of fools.</p>

<p>Dufour, I gathered, had played the country bumpkin that
he looked; had gathered all the wisdom and wine that he
could get; and had replied to Becque's eloquence with no
more than profound looks, profounder nods, and profoundest
hiccups as the evening progressed; tongues were loosened,
and, through a roseate, vinous glow, the good Becque
was seen for the noble friend of poor troopers that he
professed to be.</p>

<p>Guided by a proper love of sound political philosophy
and sound free wine, Dufour had attended the next meeting
of this brave brotherhood, and had so far fallen beneath
the spell of Becque's eloquence as to cheer it to the echo,
to embrace him warmly and then to collapse, very drunk,
upon a bench; and to listen with both his ears.</p>

<p>After his third or fourth visit, he had asked the good
Becque if he might formally join his society, and bring a
friend for whom he could vouch as one who would listen to
Becque's sentiments with the deepest interest.... Would
I come?</p>

<p>I would&mdash;though I feared that if Becque knew I was a
<i>Volontaire,</i> it would be difficult to persuade him that I
was promising anarchistic material. However, I could but
try, and if I failed on my own account, I could still take
what action I thought fit, on the word of Dufour.</p>

<p>On the following evening, having arrayed myself
in the uniform that had been issued to me by the
<i>Sergent-Fourrier</i> when I joined, I accompanied Dufour
to the rendezvous. Becque I did not know, nor he me, and
I received a hearty welcome. Watching the man, I decided
that he was a half-educated "intelligent." He had an evil,
fanatical face and a most powerful muscular frame.</p>

<p>I played the gullible brainless trooper and took stock
of Becque and his gang. The latter consisted of three
classes, I decided: First, the malcontent dregs of the
Regiment&mdash;men with grievances, real or imaginary, of the
kind known as "hard cases" and "King's hard bargains," in
England; secondly, men who in private life were violent
and dangerous "politicians"; and thirdly, men who would go
anywhere, agree with anything, and applaud anybody&mdash;for a
bottle of wine.</p>

<p>Becque's talk interested me.</p>

<p>He was clearly a monomaniac whose whole mental content
was <i>hate</i>&mdash;hate of France; hate of all who had what he
had not; hate of control, discipline and government;
hate of whatsoever and whomsoever did not meet with his
approval. I put him down as one of those sane lunatics,
afflicted with a destruction-complex; a diseased egoist,
and a treacherous, dangerous mad dog. Also a very
clever man indeed, an eloquent, plausible and forceful
personality.... The perfect <i>agent-provocateur,</i> in
fact.</p>

<p>After a certain amount of noisy good fellowship in the
bar of this low wine-shop, part of the company adjourned to
the room above, the door was locked, and the business of
the evening began.</p>

<p>It appeared that Dufour had not taken the Oath of
Initiation, and it was forthwith administered to him and
to me. We were given the choice of immediate departure
or swearing upon the Bible, with terrific oaths and
solemnities, that we would never divulge the secret
of the Society nor give any account whatsoever of its
proceedings.</p>

<p>The penalty for the infringement of this oath was
certain death.</p>

<p>We took the oath, and settled ourselves to endure
an address from Becque on the subject of The Rights of
Man&mdash;always meaning unwashen, uneducated, unpatriotic and
wholly worthless Man, <i>bien entendu.</i></p>

<p>Coming from the general to the particular, Becque
inveighed eloquently against all forms and manifestations
of Militarism, and our folly in aiding and abetting it
by conducting ourselves as disciplined soldiers. What we
ought to do was to "demonstrate," to be insubordinate,
to be lazy, dirty, inefficient, and, for a start, to be
passively mutinous. By the time we had spread his views
throughout the Regiment and each man in the Regiment had
written unsigned letters to a man in another Regiment, with
a request that these might again be forwarded to other
Regiments, the day would be in sight when passive mutiny
could become active.</p>

<p>Who were a handful of miserable officers, and more
miserable N.C.O.'s, to oppose the will of eight hundred
united and determined men?...</p>

<p>After the address, as proper to an ignorant but
inquiring disciple, I humbly propounded the question:</p>

<p>"And what happens to France when her army has disbanded
itself? What about Germany?"</p>

<p>The reply was enlightening as to the man's honesty, and
his opinion of our intelligence.</p>

<p>"The German Army will do the same, my young friend,"
answered Becque. "Our German brothers will join hands with
us. So will our Italian and Austrian and Russian brothers,
and we will form a Great Republic of the Free Proletariat
of Europe. All shall own all, and none shall oppress any.
There shall be no rich, no police, no prisons, no law, no
poor...."</p>

<p>"And no <i>Work</i>," hiccupped a drunken man, torn from the
arms of Morpheus by these stirring promises.</p>

<p>As the meeting broke up, I buttonholed the good Becque,
and, in manner mysterious, earnestly besought him to meet
me <i>alone</i> outside the H&ocirc;tel Coq d'Or to-morrow
evening at eight-fifteen. I assured him that great things
would result from this meeting, and he promised to come.
Whereupon, taking my sword, I dragged my mighty boots and
creaking uniform from his foul presence, lest I be tempted
to take him by the throat and kill him.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
At eight-fifteen the next evening I was awaiting Becque
outside my hotel, and when he arrived I led him, to his
great mystification, to my private room.</p>

<p>"So you are a <i>Volontaire,</i> are you?" he began. "Are you
a spy&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or what?" I asked.</p>

<p>He made what I took to be a secret sign.</p>

<p>With my left hand I patted my right elbow, each knee,
the top of my head, the back of my neck and the tip of my
nose.</p>

<p>Becque glared at me angrily.</p>

<p>I raised my eyebrows inquiringly, and with my right
hand twice patted my left shin, my heart, my stomach, and
the seat of my trousers.... I also could make "secret
signs"! I then rang for a bottle of wine wherewith I might
return his hospitality of the previous night&mdash;before I
dealt with him.</p>

<p>When the waiter retired I became serious, and got down
to business promptly.</p>

<p>"Are you a Frenchman?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am, I suppose," replied Becque. "My mother was
of Alsace, my father a Parisian&mdash;God curse him!...
Yes... I am a Frenchman...."</p>

<p>"Good," said I. "Have you ever been wrongfully
imprisoned, or in any way injured or punished by the
State?"</p>

<p>"<i>Me?... Prison?... No!</i> What d'you mean?...
Except that we're <i>all</i> injured by the State, aren't we?
There didn't ought to be any State."</p>

<p>"And you hold your tenets of revolution, anarchy,
murder, mutiny, and the overthrow and destruction of France
and the Republic, firmly, and with all your heart and soul,
do you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"With all my heart and soul," replied Becque, and added,
"What's the game? Are you fooling&mdash;or are you from the
Third Central? Or&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," I replied. "Are you prepared to die for
your faith? That's what I want to know."</p>

<p>"I am," answered Becque.</p>

<p>"<i>You shall</i>," said I, and arose to signify that the
conversation was ended.</p>

<p>Opening the door, I motioned to the creature to remove
itself.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
At that time, you must know, duelling was not merely
permitted but, under certain conditions, was compulsory, in
the French Army, for officers and troopers alike.</p>

<p>It was considered, rightly or wrongly, that the
knowledge that a challenge to a duel would follow insulting
conduct, must tend to prevent such conduct, and to ensure
propriety of behaviour among people of the same rank.</p>

<p>(Unfortunately, no one was allowed to fight a duel with
any person of a rank superior to his own. There would
otherwise have been a heavy mortality among Sergeants, for
example!)</p>

<p>I do not know whether it may be the result or the cause
of this duelling system, but the use of fists is regarded,
in the French cavalry, as vulgar, ruffianly and low. Under
no circumstances would two soldiers "come down and settle
it behind the Riding School," in the good old Anglo-Saxon
way. If they fought at all, they would fight with swords,
under supervision, with seconds and surgeons present, and
"by order."</p>

<p>A little careful management, and I should have friend
Becque where I wanted him, give him the fright of his life,
and perhaps put him out of the "agitating" business for a
time.</p>

<p>I told Dufour exactly what I had in mind, and, on the
following evening, instead of dining at my hotel, I went in
search of the scoundrel.</p>

<p>He was no good to me in the canteen, on the
parade-ground, nor in the street. I needed him where the
eye of authority would be quickly turned upon any unseemly
<i>fracas.</i></p>

<p>Dufour discovered him doing a scavenging <i>corv&eacute;e</i>
in the Riding School, under the eye of Sergeant Bl&uuml;m.
This would do excellently....</p>

<p>As the fatigue-party was dismissed by the Sergeant,
Dufour and I strolled by, passing one on either side of
Becque, who carried a broom. Lurching slightly, Dufour
pushed Becque against me, and I gave him a shove that sent
him sprawling.</p>

<p>Springing up, he rushed at me, using the filthy broom as
though it had been a bayonet. This I seized with one hand,
and, with the other, smacked the face of friend Becque
right heartily. Like any other member of the snake tribe,
Becque spat, and then, being annoyed, I really hit him.</p>

<p>As he went head-over-heels, Sergeant Bl&uuml;m rushed
forth from the Riding School, attracted by the scuffling
and the shouts of the fatigue-party and of Dufour, who had
certainly made noise enough for six.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he roared. "Are you street curs, snapping
and snarling and scrapping in the gutter, or soldiers of
France?... Take eight days' <i>salle de police</i> both of
you.... Who began it, and what happened?"</p>

<p>The excellent Dufour gabbled a most untruthful version
of the affair, and Sergeant Bl&uuml;m took notes. Trooper
Becque had publicly spat upon <i>Volontaire</i> de Beaujolais,
who had then knocked him down....</p>

<p>The next evening's orders, read out to the troopers by
the <i>Caporaux-Fourriers,</i> contained the paragraph, by order
of the Colonel:</p>

<p class="first">
"The Troopers Becque and de Beaujolais will fight a duel
on Monday morning at ten o'clock, with cavalry-swords, in
the Riding School, in the presence of the Major of the
Week, the Captain of the Week, and of the Second Captains
of their respective Squadrons, of Surgeon-Major Philippe
and Surgeon-Major Patti-Reville, and of the Fencing-Master,
in accordance with Army Regulation 869:&mdash;<i>If</i> <i>a soldier
has been gravely insulted by one of his comrades, and the
insult has taken place in public, he must not hesitate to
claim reparation for it by a duel. He should address his
demand to his Captain Commanding, who should transmit it
to the Colonel. But it must not be forgotten that a good
soldier ought to avoid quarrels....</i></p>

<p>"The successful combatant in this duel will receive
fifteen days' imprisonment, and the loser will receive
thirty days'."</p>

<p class="first">
On hearing the order, I was of opinion that the loser
would disappear from human ken for more than thirty
days.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
On entering the Riding School with Dufour on the Monday
morning, I was delighted to see Sergeant Bl&uuml;m in the
place of the Fencing-Master, who was ill in hospital.</p>

<p>This was doubly excellent, as my task was rendered
easier and Sergeant Bl&uuml;m was placed in an unpleasant
and risky situation. For it was the Fencing-Master's job,
while acting as Master of Ceremonies and referee, to stand
close by, with a steel scabbard in his hand, and prevent
either of the combatants from killing, or even dangerously
wounding the other!</p>

<p>Severe punishment would follow his failing to do his
duty in this respect&mdash;and the noisy, swaggering Bl&uuml;m
was no <i>maitre d'armes.</i></p>

<p>As instructed, we were "in stable kit, with any footwear
preferred," so I had tucked my canvas trousers into socks,
and put on a pair of gymnasium shoes.</p>

<p>Scrutinizing Becque carefully, I came to the conclusion
that he would show the fierce and desperate courage of a
cornered rat, and that if he had paid as much attention to
fencing as to physical culture and anarchistic sedition,
he would put up a pretty useful fight. I wondered what
sort of a swordsman he was, and whether he was in the
habit, like myself and a good many troopers, of voluntarily
supplementing the compulsory attendance at fencing-school
for instruction in "foils and sabres."...</p>

<p>When all the officers and official spectators were
present, we were ordered to strip to the waist, were given
heavy cavalry-swords, and put face to face, by Sergeant
Bl&uuml;m, who vehemently impressed upon us the imperative
duty of instantly stopping when he cried "<i>Halt!</i>"</p>

<p>Bl&uuml;m then gave the order "<i>On guard,</i>" and stood
with his steel scabbard beneath our crossed swords.
Throughout the fight he held this ready to parry any
head-cuts, or to strike down a dangerous thrust. (And they
called this a <i>duel</i>!)</p>

<p>My great fear was, that with the clumsy lout sticking
his scabbard into the fight and deflecting cuts and
thrusts, I should scratch Becque or Becque would scratch
me. This would end the preposterous fight at once, as these
glorious affairs were "first-blood" duels&mdash;and my object
was to incapacitate Becque, and both frighten and punish a
viperous and treacherous enemy of my beloved country.</p>

<p>I stared hard into Becque's shifty eyes. Bl&uuml;m
gave the word&mdash;"<i>Go</i>!" and Becque rushed at me, making a
hurricane attack and showing himself to be a very good and
determined fighter.</p>

<p>I parried for dear life, and allowed him to tire his
arm and exhaust his lungs. Bl&uuml;m worried me nearly
as much as Becque, for he leapt around yelling to us to
be "careful," and swiping at both our swords. He made me
laugh, and that made me angry (and him furious), for it was
no laughing matter.</p>

<p>"<i>Halt</i>!" he cried, and I sprang back, Becque aiming
another cut at my head, after the order had been given.</p>

<p>"You, Becque," he shouted, "be more careful, will you?
D'you think you are beating carpets, or fighting a duel,
you..."</p>

<p>Becque was pale and puffing like a porpoise. He had
not attempted a single thrust or feint, but had merely
slashed with tremendous speed, force and orthodoxy. He was
a strong, plain swordsman, but not a really good and pretty
fencer.</p>

<p>Provided neither of us scratched the other's arm, nor
drew blood prematurely, I could put Becque where I wanted
him&mdash;unless the fool Bl&uuml;m foiled me. It was like
fighting two men at once....</p>

<p>"<i>On guard</i>!" cried Bl&uuml;m. "<i>Go</i>!"...</p>

<p>Becque instantly cut, with a <i>coup de flanc,</i> and, as
I parried, struck at my head. He was fighting even more
quickly than in the first round, but with less violence and
ferocity. He was tiring, and my chance was coming.... I
could have touched him a dozen times, but that was not my
object.... I was sorely tempted, a moment later, when
he missed my head, and the heavy sword was carried out of
guard, but the wretched Bl&uuml;m's scabbard was between us
in a second....</p>

<p>Becque was breathing heavily, and it was my turn to
attack.... <i>Now!...</i> Suddenly Becque sprang backward
and thrust the point of his sword into the ground. Quite
unnecessarily, Bl&uuml;m struck my sword down, and stepped
between us.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, you?" snapped Major de Montreson.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied," panted Becque. This was a trick to get
a much-needed breathing-space.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not," replied the Major sourly. "Are you?" he
asked, pointing to me.</p>

<p>"It is a duel <i>au premier sang,</i> Monsieur le Majeur," I
replied, "and there is no blood yet."</p>

<p>"Quite so," agreed the Major. "The duel will continue
at once. And if you, Becque, retreat again like that, you
shall fight with your back to a corner...."</p>

<p>"<i>On guard</i>!" cried Sergeant Bl&uuml;m, and we crossed
swords again. "<i>Go</i>!"... Becque made another most
violent assault. I parried until I judged that his arm
was again tired, and then feinted at his head. Up went
his sword and Blum's scabbard, and my feint became a
thrust&mdash;beneath the pair of them, and through Becque's
right breast....</p>

<p>France, my beautiful France, my second Mother, had one
active enemy the less for quite a good while.</p>

<p>"I'll do that for you again, when you come out of
hospital, friend Becque," said I, as he staggered back.</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">
There was a most tremendous row, ending in a <i>Conseil
de discipline,</i> with myself in the dock, Becque being in
the Infirmary. As all was in order, however, and nothing
had been irregular (except that the duellists had really
fought), I was not sent, as my comrades had cheerfully
prophesied, to three years' hard labour in the <i>Compagnies
de discipline</i> in Algeria. I was merely given fifteen days'
prison, to teach me not to fight when duelling another
time; and, joy of joys, Sergeant Bl&uuml;m was given
<i>retrogradation</i>&mdash;reduction in rank.</p>

<p>I walked most warily in the presence of Corporal
Bl&uuml;m, until, as the result of my being second in
the April examination (in Riding, Drill and Command,
Topography, <i>Voltige,</i> Hippology and Gymnastics) for
<i>Volontaires,</i> I became a Corporal myself.</p>

<p>Life, after that promotion, became a little less
complex, and improved still further when I headed the list
of <i>Volontaires</i> at the October examination, and became a
Sergeant.</p>

<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p class="first">
After hanging between life and death for several weeks,
Becque began to mend, and Surgeon-Major Patti-Reville
pronounced him to be out of danger.</p>

<p>That same day I received an order through Sergeant
de Poncey to visit the junior officer of our squadron,
<i>Sous-Lieutenant</i> Raoul d'Auray de Redon, in his quarters,
after stables.</p>

<p>"And what the devil does that mean, Sergeant?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"I know no more than you," was the reply, "but I do know
that Sub-Lieutenant d'Auray de Redon is one of the very
finest gentlemen God ever made.... He has often saved
me from suicide&mdash;simply by a kind word and his splendid
smile.... If only our officers were all like him!"</p>

<p>I, too, had noticed the young gentleman, and had
been struck by his beauty. I do not mean prettiness nor
handsomeness, but <i>beauty.</i> It shone from within him,
and illuminated a perfectly formed face. A light of
truth, strength, courage and gentleness burned like a
flame within the glorious lamp of his body. He radiated
friendliness, kindness, helpfulness, and was yet the best
disciplinarian in the Regiment&mdash;because he had no need to
"keep" discipline. It kept itself, where he was concerned.
And with all his gentle goodness of heart he was a strong
man. Nay, he was a lion of strength and courage. He had the
noble <i>&eacute;lan</i> of the French and the cool forceful
determination and bulldog tenacity of the Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>After a wash and some valeting by Dufour, I made my way
to Sub-Lieutenant d'Auray de Redon's quarters....</p>

<p>He was seated at a table, and looked up with a long
appraising stare, as I saluted and stood at attention. "You
sent for me, <i>mon Lieutenant</i>," I murmured.</p>

<p>"I did," replied de Redon, and the brilliant brown eyes
smiled, although the strong handsome face did not.</p>

<p>"Why did you want to fight this Becque?" he suddenly
shot at me.</p>

<p>I was somewhat taken aback.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;he&mdash;ah&mdash;he has dirty finger-nails, <i>mon
Lieutenant</i>," I replied.</p>

<p>"Quite probably," observed de Redon. "Quite.... And
are you going to start a Clean Finger-nail Crusade in the
Blue Hussars, and fight all those who do not join it and
live up to its excellent tenets?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>mon Lieutenant</i>," I admitted.</p>

<p>"Then why Becque in particular, out of a few hundreds?"
continued de Redon.</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;he eats garlic&mdash;and sometimes has a cast in his
eye&mdash;and he jerks at his horse's mouth&mdash;and had a German
mother&mdash;and wipes his nose with the back of his hand&mdash;and
grins sideways exposing a long yellow dog-tooth, <i>mon
Lieutenant</i>," I replied.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you supply one with interesting information,"
observed my officer dryly. "Now I will supply you with
some, though it won't be so interesting&mdash;because you
already know it.... In addition to his garlic, cast,
jerks, German mother, nose-wiping and dog-tooth, he is a
seditious scoundrel and a hireling spy and agitator, and is
trying to seduce and corrupt foolish troopers.... You
have attended his meetings, taken the oath of secrecy and
fidelity to his Society, and you have been closeted with
him in private at your hotel."</p>

<p>I stared at de Redon in astonishment, and said what is
frequently an excellent thing to say&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>"Now," continued my interlocutor, "perhaps you will
answer my questions a little more fully.... Why did you
challenge Becque, after you had joined his little Society
for engineering a mutiny in the Regiment, for achieving the
destruction of the State, and for encompassing the ruin of
France?"</p>

<p>"Because of the things I have already mentioned, <i>mon
ofjicier,</i> and because I thought he would be the better for
a rest," I replied. "I considered it a good way to end his
little activities. My idea was to threaten him with a duel
for every meeting that he held...."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you did, eh?" smiled de Redon. "And now I want
you to tell me just what happened at these meetings, just
what was said, and the names of the troopers who were
present."</p>

<p>"I cannot do that, sir," I replied.... "As you
seem to be aware, I took a solemn oath to reveal nothing
whatsoever."</p>

<p>Sub-Lieutenant Raoul d'Auray de Redon rose from his
chair, and came round to where I was standing. Was he&mdash;a
gentleman&mdash;going to demand with threats and menaces that I
break my word&mdash;even to such a rat as Becque?</p>

<p>"Stand at ease, Trooper Henri de Beaujolais," he said,
"and shake hands with a brother of the Service!...
Oh, yes, I know all about you, old chap.... From de
Lannec&mdash;though I don't know whether your uncle is aware of
the fact...."</p>

<p>I took the proffered hand and stammered my thanks at
this honour from my superior officer.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, my dear boy. You'll be <i>my</i> 'superior
officer' some day, I have no doubt.... I must say
I admire your pluck in coming to <i>Us</i> by way of the
ranks.... How soon will you come to Africa?... I
am off next month... Spahis... until I am perfect
in languages and disguises.... Isn't it a glorious
honour to be one of your uncle's picked men?... And
now about this Becque. You needn't pursue him any more. I
have been giving myself a little Secret Service practice
and experiment. Much easier here in France than it will be
in Africa, by Jove!... Well, we know all about Becque,
and when he leaves hospital he will go where there will be
nothing to distract his great mind from his great thoughts
for two or three years.... He may be a mad dog, as you
say, but I fancy that the mad dog has some pretty sane
owners and employers."</p>

<p>"Some one has denounced him, then?" I said.</p>

<p>"No, my dear de Beaujolais, not yet. But some one is
going to do so. Some one who attended his last meeting&mdash;and
who was too drunk to take any oaths.... So drunk that he
could only giggle helplessly when invited to swear!"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Me," replied Sub-Lieutenant d'Auray de Redon. "'And no
<i>Work'</i>! You may remember my valuable contribution to the
great ideas of the evening...."</p>

<p>Such was my first encounter with this brilliant and
splendid man, whom I came to love as a brother is rarely
loved. I will tell in due course of my last encounter with
him.</p>

<h3>§ 7</h3>

<p class="first">
A letter from de Lannec apprised me of the fact that my
uncle had heard of the duel, and seemed amused and far from
displeased with me....</p>

<p>Poor old de Lannec! He wrote that his very soul was dead
within him, and his life "but dust and ashes, a vale of woe
and mourning, a desert of grief and despair in which was no
oasis of joy or hope."...</p>

<p>For he had lost his adored V&eacute;ronique Vaux....
She had transferred her affections to a colonel of
Chasseurs d'Afrique, and departed with him to Fez!...</p>

<h2><a name="c106" id="c106"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>AFRICA</h3>

<p class="first">
At the end of the year, my uncle was pleased grimly to
express himself as satisfied, and to send me forthwith
to the Military School of Saumur, where selected
Cavalry-Sergeants of good family and superior education are
made into officers.</p>

<p>Here nothing amusing occurred, and I was glad when, once
more, wires were pulled and I was instructed to betake
myself and my new commission to Algeria and present myself
at the <i>Quartier des Spahis</i> at Sidi-bel-Abb&egrave;s.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my first glimpse of my new home. It
is indelibly etched upon the tablets of my memory.</p>

<p>I stood at the great gates in the lane that separates
the Spahis' barracks from those of the Foreign Legion, and
thought of the day&mdash;so recently passed&mdash;when I had stood,
a wretched civilian, at those of the Blue Hussars in St.
Denis....</p>

<p>Outside the red-white-and-blue-striped sentry-box stood
a bearded dusky giant, a huge red turban crowning the snowy
linen <i>kafiya</i> that framed his face; a scarlet be-medalled
Zouave jacket covering a gaudy waistcoat and tremendous
red sash; and the most voluminous skirt-like white baggy
trousers almost concealing his great spurred cavalry-boots.
A huge curved cavalry-sabre hung at his left side, and in
his right hand he bore a carbine.</p>

<p>"And so this is the type of warrior I am to lead in
cavalry-charges!" thought I, and wondered if there were any
to equal it in the world.</p>

<p>He saluted me with faultless smartness and precision,
and little guessed how I was thrilled to the marrow of my
bones as I returned the first salute I had received from a
man of my own Regiment.</p>

<p>Standing at the big open window of the <i>Salle de
Rapport</i> in the regimental offices near the gate, was a
strikingly smart and masculine figure&mdash;that of an officer
in a gold-frogged white tunic (that must surely have
covered a pair of corsets), which fitted his wide shoulders
and narrow waist as paper fits the walls of a room.</p>

<p>Beneath a high red <i>tarbush</i> smiled one of the
handsomest faces I have ever seen. So charming was the
smile, so really beautiful the whole man, that it could be
none other than Raoul d'Auray de Redon, here a couple of
years before me.</p>

<p>I know now that one man <i>can</i> really love another with
the love that is described as existing between David and
Jonathan.... I do not believe in love "at first sight,"
but tremendous attraction, and the strongest liking at
first sight, soon came, in this case, to be a case of love
at second sight.... To this day I can never look upon
the portrait of Raoul d'Auray de Redon, of whom more anon,
without a pang of bitter-sweet pain and a half-conscious
prayer....</p>

<p>By the Guard-Room stood a group that I can see
now&mdash;a statuesque <i>sous-officier</i> in spotless white
drill tunic and trousers, white shoes and a <i>tarbush</i>
(miscalled a fez cap)&mdash;<i>l'Adjudant</i> Lescault; an elderly
French Sergeant-Major in scarlet patrol-jacket, white
riding-breeches with a double black stripe down the sides,
and a red <i>k&eacute;pi</i> with a gold band; an Arab Sergeant,
dressed like the sentry, save for his chevrons; and the
Guard, who seemed to me to be a mixture of Arabs and
Frenchmen&mdash;for some of them were as fair in complexion as
myself.</p>

<p>Beyond this group stood a Lieutenant, examining a horse
held by an Arab groom, and I was constrained to stare at
this gentleman, for beneath a red tunic he wore a pair
of the colossal Spahi white skirt-trousers, and these
were gathered in at the ankle to reveal a pair of tiny
pointed-toed patent shoes. His other extremity was adorned
by a rakish peaked <i>k&eacute;pi</i> in scarlet and gold.</p>

<p>My future brothers-in-arms these....</p>

<p>I glanced beyond them to the Oriental garden,
tree-embowered, which lay between the gates and the distant
low-colonnaded stables that housed the magnificent grey
Arab horses of the Regiment; and feeling that I could
embrace all men, I stepped forward and entered upon my
heritage....</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
Nevertheless, it was not very long before life at the
dep&ocirc;t in Sidi-bel-Abb&egrave;s grew very boring
indeed. One quickly grew tired of the mild dissipations of
our club, the <i>Cercle Militaire,</i> and of the more sordid
ones of the alleged haunts of pleasure boasted by that dull
provincial garrison-town.</p>

<p>Work saved me from weariness, however, for I worked
like a blinded well-camel&mdash;at Arabic&mdash;in addition to the
ordinary duties of a cavalry-officer.</p>

<p>To the Spahis came Dufour, sent by my uncle at my
request, and together we pursued our studies in the
language and in disguises. Nor was I sorry when, at the
earliest possible moment, my uncle again pulled wires, and
I was ordered to Morocco.</p>

<p>In that fascinating country I was extremely lucky&mdash;lucky
enough, after weary garrison-duty at Casa Blanca, or
rather Ain Bourdja, outside its walls, Rabat, Mequinez,
Fez, Dar-Debibagh and elsewhere&mdash;to be at the gory fight
of R'fakha and to charge at the head of a squadron; and to
play my little part in the Chaiova campaigns at Settat,
M'koun, Sidi el Mekhi and the M'karto.</p>

<p>After the heavy fighting round, and in, Fez, I was
a Captain, and had two pretty little pieces of metal
and ribbon to hang on my tunic; and in the nasty little
business with the Zarhoun tribe (who took it upon them
to close the roads between Fez and Tangier and between
Meknes and Rabat) I was given command of the squadron that
formed part of the composite battalion entrusted with the
job....</p>

<p>With this squadron was my good Dufour, of course, a
non-commissioned officer already wearing the <i>medaille
militaire</i> for valour. Of its winning I must briefly tell
the tale, because the memory of it was so cruelly and
poignantly before my mind in the awful hour when I had to
leave him to his death, instead of dying with him as I
longed to do....</p>

<p>On that black day I saw again, in clear and glowing
colours, this picture:</p>

<p>I am charging a great <i>harka</i> of very brave and
fanatical Moors, at the head of my squadron.... We do
not charge in line as the English do, but every man for
himself, hell-for-leather, at the most tremendous pace to
which he can spur his horse.... Being the best mounted,
I am naturally well ahead.... The earth seems to tremble
beneath the thundering onrush of the finest squadron in
the world.... I am wildly happy.... I wave my sabre
and shout for joy.... As we are about to close with the
enemy, I lower my point and straighten my arm. (Always
use the point until you are brought to a standstill, and
then use the edge with the speed and force of lightning.)
The Moors are as cunning as they are brave. Hundreds of
infantry drop behind rocks and big stones and into nullahs,
level their long guns and European rifles, and blaze into
the brown of us. Hundreds of cavalry swerve off to right
and left, to take us in flank and surround us, when the
shock of our impact upon the main body has broken our
charge and brought us to a halt. They do not know that we
shall go through them like a knife through cheese, re-form
and charge back again&mdash;and even if we do not scatter
them like chaff, will effectually prevent their charging
and capturing our silent and almost defenceless little
mountain-guns....</p>

<p>We thunder on, an irresistible avalanche of men and
horses, and, like a swimmer diving from a cliff into the
sea&mdash;I am into them with a mighty crash.... A big
Moor and his Barbary stallion go head-over-heels, as my
good horse and I strike them amidships, like a single
projectile; and, but for the sword-knot whose cord is
round my wrist, I should have lost my sabre, pulled from
my hand as I withdrew it from beneath the Moor's right
arm....</p>

<p>I spur my horse; he bounds over the prostrate horse
and man; I give another big Moslem my point&mdash;right in the
middle of his long black beard as I charge past him&mdash;and
then run full tilt into a solid mass of men and horses. I
cut and parry; slash, parry and cut; thrust and strike, and
rise in my stirrups and hack and hew&mdash;until I am through
and spurring again to a gallop.... And then I know that
my horse is hit and going down, and I am flying over his
head and that the earth rises up and smashes my face, and
strikes my chest so cruel a blow that the breath is driven
from my body, and I am a living pain....</p>

<p>Oh! the agony of that struggle for breath, after the
smashing crash that has broken half my ribs, my right arm
and my jaw-bone.... And, oh! the torture of my dead
horse's weight on my broken leg and ankle....</p>

<p class="first">
And why was my throat not being cut? Why no spears being
driven through my back? Why was my skull not being battered
in?...</p>

<p>I got my dripping face from out of the dust, wiped it
with my left sleeve, and got on to my left elbow....</p>

<p>I was the centre of a terrific "dog-fight," and,
standing across me, leaping over me, whirling round and
round, jumping from side to side like a fiend and a madman,
a grand athlete and a great hero&mdash;was Dufour.... Sick
and shattered as I was, I could still admire his wonderful
swordsmanship, and marvel at his extraordinary agility,
strength, and skill.... Soon I realized that I could
do more than admire him. I could help, although pinned to
the ground by my horse and feeling sick, shattered, and
smashed.... With infinite pain I dragged my revolver
from its holster, and rejoiced that I had made myself as
good a shot with my left hand as with my right.</p>

<p>Then, lying on my right side, and sighting as well and
quickly as I could in so awkward a position, I fired at a
man whose spear was driving at Dufour's back; at another
whose great sword was swung up to cleave him; at a third,
whose long gun was presented at him; and then, after a wave
of death-like faintness had passed, into the very face of
one who had sprung past him and was in the act of driving
his big curved dagger into my breast....</p>

<p>As I aimed my last shot&mdash;at the man whose sword was
clashing on Dufour's sabre&mdash;the squadron came thundering
back, headed by Lieutenant d'Auray de Redon, and never was
I more glad to see the face of my beloved Raoul....</p>

<p>He and several of the Spahis drew rein, scattered
our assailants and pursued them, while Dufour caught a
riderless troop-horse and&mdash;I am told&mdash;lifted me across the
saddle, jumped on its back, behind the saddle, and galloped
back to our position.</p>

<p>It seems that he had been behind me when my horse came
down, had deliberately reined up, dismounted, and run to
rescue me&mdash;when he was attacked. Nor had he striven to
cut his way out from among the few who were surrounding
him, but had stood his ground, defending me until he was
the centre of the mob of wild fanatics from which Raoul's
charge saved us in the nick of time. He was bleeding from
half a dozen sword-cuts by the time he got me away, though
not one of them was severe....</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;this was the picture that burned before my eyes on
the dreadful day of which I shall tell you.</p>

<p>Duty is a stern and jealous God....</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
I made a quick recovery, and thanked Heaven and our
splendid surgeons when I found that I was not, as I had
feared, to be lame for life.</p>

<p>I got back to work, and when my uncle, punctual to
his life's programme, came out to Africa, I was able to
join his Staff as an officer who knew more than a little
about the country and its fascinating towns and people;
an officer who could speak Arabic and its Moorish variant
like a native; and who could wander through <i>s&#363;q</i>
and street and bazaar as a beggar; a pedlar; a swaggering
Riffian <i>askri</i> of the <i>bled;</i> a nervous, cringing Jew of
the <i>mellah;</i> a fanatic of Mulai Idris; a camel-man, or
donkey-driver&mdash;without the least fear of discovery.</p>

<p>And I believe I could tell him things that no other
officer in all Morocco could tell him of subterranean
tribal politics; gutter intrigues of the fanatical mobs of
towns that mattered (such as Meknes, for example, where
I relieved my friend Captain de Lannec and where I was
soon playing the Jew pedlar, and sending out messengers
up to the day of its rising and the great massacre); and
the respective attitudes, at different times, of various
parts of the country and various classes of the people
towards the Sultan Abd-el-Aziz; the would-be Sultan, Mulai
Hafid; the Pretender Mulai Zine, his brother; or the great
powerful <i>marabout</i> Ibn Nualla.</p>

<p>My uncle was pleased with the tool of his
fashioning&mdash;the tool that would <i>never</i> "turn in his hand,"
and my name was writ large in the books of the <i>Bureau des
Affaires Indig&egrave;nes</i> at Rabat....</p>

<p>Nor do I think that there was any jealousy or grumbling
when I became the youngest Major in the French Army, and
disappeared from human ken to watch affairs in Zaguig and
in the disguise of a native of that mean city.... I
entered it on foot, in the guise of a hill-man from the
north, and as I passed through the tunnel of the great gate
in the mighty ramparts, a camel-driver rose from where he
squatted beside his beast and accosted me.</p>

<p>We gave what I think was an unexceptionable rendering of
the meeting of two Arab friends who had not seen each other
for a long time.</p>

<p>"Let me be the proud means of giving your honoured legs
a rest, my brother," said the man loudly, as he again
embraced me and patted my back with both hands. "Let
my camel bear you to the lodging you honour with your
shining presence.... God make you strong.... God
give you many sons.... God send rain upon your barley
crops...." And he led me to where his kneeling camel
snarled.</p>

<p>And may I be believed when I say that it was not until
he had patted my back (three right hand, two left, one
right, one left) that I knew that this dirty, bearded,
shaggy camel-man was Raoul d'Auray de Redon, whom I was to
relieve here! I was to do this that he might make a long,
long journey with a caravan of a certain Sidi Ibrahim
Maghruf, a Europeanized Arab merchant whom our Secret
Service trusted&mdash;to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Raoul it was however, and, at Sidi Ibrahim Maghruf's
house, he told me all he could of local politics,
intrigues, under-currents and native affairs in general.</p>

<p>"It's high time we made a plain gesture and took a firm
forward step," he concluded. "It is known, of course, that
we are coming and that the Military Mission will be a
strong one&mdash;and it is anticipated that it will be followed
by a column that will eventually remark <i>J'y suis</i>&mdash;<i>J'y
reste....</i> Well, the brutes have asked for it, and
they'll get it&mdash;but I think it is a case of the sooner the
quicker....</p>

<p>"I'll tell you a curious thing, my friend. I have been
attending some very interesting gatherings, and at one or
two of them was a heavily-bearded fanatic who harangued the
audience volubly and eloquently&mdash;but methought his Arabic
had an accent.... I got Sidi Ibrahim Maghruf to let me
take his trusted old factotum, Ali Mansur, with me to a
little fruit-party which the eloquent one was giving.</p>

<p>"When old Ali Mansur had gobbled all the fruit he
could hold and we sat replete, listening to our host's
harangue upon the greatness of Islam and the littleness
(and nastiness) of Unbelievers&mdash;especially the <i>Franzawi</i>
Unbelievers who have conquered Algeria and penetrated
Tunisia and Morocco and intended to come to Zaguig&mdash;I asked
old Ali if he thought the man spoke curious Arabic and was
a foreigner himself.</p>

<p>"'He is an Egyptian or a Moor or a Turk or something
else, doubtless,' grunted Ali. 'But he is a true son
of Islam and a father of the poor and the oppressed.
<i>Wallahi,</i> but those melons and figs and dates were
good&mdash;Allah reward him.'</p>

<p>"So I decided that I was right and that this fellow's
Arabic <i>was</i> a little queer.... Well, I followed
him about, and, one evening, saw him meet another man,
evidently by appointment, in the Zaouia Gardens....
And the other man made a much quicker job of tucking
his legs up under him on the stone seat, and squatting
cross-legged like a true native, than my suspect did. He
was a little slow and clumsy about it, and I fancied that
he would have sat on the seat in <i>European</i> fashion, if he
had been alone and unobserved.... Whereupon I became a
wicked cut-purse robber of a mountaineer, crept up behind
those two, in barefooted silence, and suddenly fetched our
eloquent friend a very sharp crack on the head with my
heavy <i>matrack</i> stick.... He let out one word and sprang
to his feet. The hood of my dirty <i>burnous</i> was well over
my ingenuous countenance and the evening was growing dark,
but I got a clear glimpse of his face, and then fled for
my life.... I am a good runner, as you know, and I had
learned what I wanted&mdash;or most of it."</p>

<p>I waited, deeply interested, while Raoul paused and
smiled at me.</p>

<p>"When a man has an exclamation fairly <i>knocked</i> out
of him, so to speak, that exclamation will be in his
mother-tongue," continued Raoul. "And if a man has, at
times, a very slight cast in his eye, that cast is much
enhanced and emphasized in a moment of sudden shock,
fright, anger or other violent emotion."</p>

<p>" True," I agreed.</p>

<p>"My friend," said Raoul, "that man's exclamation, when I
hit him, was '<i>Himmel</i>!' and, as he turned round, there was
a most pronounced cast in his left eye. He almost squinted,
in fact...."</p>

<p>"The former point is highly interesting," I observed.
"What of the other?"</p>

<p>"Henri," replied Raoul. "Do you remember a man who&mdash;let
me see&mdash;had dirty finger-nails, ate garlic, jerked his
horse's mouth, had a German mother, wiped his nose with the
back of his hand, revealed a long dog-tooth when he grinned
sideways, and had a cast in his eye?... A man in the
Blue Hussars, a dozen years and more ago?... Eh, <i>do</i>
you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Becque!</i>" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Becque, I verily believe," said Raoul.</p>

<p>"But wouldn't he exclaim in French, under such sudden
and violent shock?" I demurred.</p>

<p>"Not if he had been bred and born speaking the German of
his German mother in Alsace," replied my friend. "German
would be literally his mother-tongue. He would learn from
his French father to speak perfect French, and we know that
his parents were of the two nationalities."</p>

<p>"It <i>may</i> be Becque, of course," I said doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I believe it is he," replied Raoul, "and I also believe
you're the man to make certain.... What about continuing
that little duel&mdash;with no Sergeant Bl&uuml;m to interrupt,
eh?"</p>

<p>"If it is he, and I can manage it, the duel will
be taken up at the point where it was stopped owing
to circumstances beyond Monsieur Becque's control," I
remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I think <i>ce bon</i> Becque ought to die," smiled
Raoul, "as a traitor, a renegade and a spy.... For those
things he is&mdash;as the French-born son of a Frenchman, and as
a soldier who has worn the uniform of France and taken the
oath of true and faithful service to the Republic."</p>

<p>"Where was he born?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Paris," replied Raoul. "Bred and born in Paris. He
was known to the police as a criminal and an anarchist
from his youth, and it appears that he got into the Blue
Hussars by means of stolen or forged papers in this name
of Becque.... They lost sight of him after he had
served his sentence for incitement to mutiny in the Blue
Hussars...."</p>

<p>And we talked on far into the night in Sidi Ibrahim
Maghruf's great moonlit garden.</p>

<p>Next day, Raoul departed on his journey of terrible
hardships&mdash;a camel-man in the employ of Sidi Ibrahim
Maghruf, to Lake Tchad and Timbuktu, with his life in his
hands and all his notes and observations to be kept in his
head.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
Of the man who might or might not be Becque, I saw
nothing whatever in Zaguig. He may have taken fright at
Raoul's sudden and inexplicable assault upon him, and
thought that his secret was discovered, or he may have
departed by reason of the approach of the French forces. On
the other hand he may merely have gone away to report upon
the situation in Zaguig, or again, he may have been in the
place the whole time.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I got no news nor trace of him, and soon
dismissed him from my mind. In due course I was relieved
in turn by Captain de Lannec and returned to Morocco,
and was sent thence into the far south, ostensibly to
organize Mounted Infantry companies out of mules and the
Foreign Legion, but really to do a little finding-out and
a little intelligence-organizing in the direction of the
territories of our various southern neighbours, and to
travel from Senegal to Wadai, with peeps into Nigeria and
the Cameroons. I was in the Soudan a long while.</p>

<p>Here I had some very instructive experiences, and a very
weird one at a place called Zinderneuf, whence I went on
leave <i>via</i> Nigeria, actually travelling home with a most
excellent Briton named George Lawrence, who had been my
very senior and revered fag-master at Eton!</p>

<p>It is a queer little world, and very amusing.</p>

<p class="first">
And everywhere I went, the good Dufour, brave, staunch
and an extraordinarily clever mimic of any kind of
native, went also, "seconded for special service in the
Intelligence Department"&mdash;and invaluable service it was.
At disguise and dialect he was as good as, if not better
than, myself; and it delighted me to get him still further
decorated and promoted as he deserved.</p>

<p>And so Fate, my uncle, and my own hard, dangerous and
exciting work, brought me to the great adventure of my
life, and to the supreme failure that rewarded my labours
at the crisis of my career.</p>

<p>Little did I dream what awaited me when I got the
laconic message from my uncle (now Commander-in-Chief and
Governor-General):</p>

<p>"<i>Return forthwith to Zaguig and wait instructions.</i>"</p>

<p>Zaguig, as I knew to my sorrow, was a "holy" city,
and like most holy cities, was tenanted by some of the
unholiest scum of mankind that pollute the earth.</p>

<p>Does not the Arab proverb itself say, "<i>The holier the
city, the wickeder its citizens</i>"?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c107" id="c107"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>ZAGUIG</h3>

<p class="first">
After the cities of Morocco, the Enchantress, I hated
going back to Zaguig, the last-won and least-subdued of our
Saharan outposts of civilization; and after the bold Moor I
hated the secretive, furtive, evil Zaguigans, who reminded
me of the fat, fair and false Fezai.</p>

<p>Not that Zaguig could compare with Fez or Marrakesh,
of course, that bright jewel sunk in its green ocean of
palms, with its wonderful gardens, Moorish architecture,
cool marble, bright tiles, fountains and charming hidden
<i>patios.</i></p>

<p>This Zaguig (now occupied by French troops) was an
ash-heap populated with vermin, and very dangerous vermin,
too.</p>

<p>I did not like the position of affairs at all. I
did not like the careless over-confident attitude of
Colonel Levasseur; I did not like the extremely scattered
disposition of the small garrison, a mere advance-guard;
and I did not like the fact that Miss Mary Hankinson
Vanbrugh was, with her brother, the guest of the said
Colonel Levasseur.</p>

<p>You see, I <i>knew</i> what was going on beneath the surface,
and what I did not know from personal observation, Dufour
could tell me.</p>

<p>(When I was not Major de Beaujolais, I was a
water-carrier, and when Dufour was not Adjudant Dufour of
the Spahis, he was a seller of dates and melons in the
<i>s&#363;q</i>. When I was here before, I had been a blind
leper&mdash;when not a coolie in the garden of Sidi Ibrahim
Maghruf, the friend of France.)</p>

<p>Nor could I do more than lay my information before
Colonel Levasseur. He was Commanding Officer of the troops
and Governor of the town, and I was merely a detached
officer of the Intelligence Department, sent to Zaguig
to make arrangements for pushing off "into the blue" (on
<i>very</i> Secret Service) as soon as word came that the moment
was ripe....</p>

<p>Extracts from a letter, written by my uncle at Algiers,
and which I found awaiting me at Zaguig, will tell you
nearly as much as I knew myself.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
"... and so, my dear Henri, comes your chance&mdash;the
work for which the tool has been fashioned.... Succeed
and you will have struck a mighty blow for France (and you
will not find France ungrateful). But mind&mdash;you will have
to be as swift and as silent as you will have to be clever,
and you must stand or fall absolutely alone. If they fillet
you and boil you in oil&mdash;you will have to boil unavenged.
A desert column operating in that direction would rouse
such a howl in the German Press (and in one or two others)
as would do infinite harm at home, and would hamper and
hinder my work out here for years. The Government is none
too firmly seated, and has powerful enemies, and you must
not provide the stick wherewith to beat the dog.</p>

<p class="letter">
"On the other hand, I am expecting, and only waiting
for, the dispatch which will sanction a subsidy of a
million francs, so long as this Federation remains
in alliance with France and rejects all overtures to
Pan-Islamism. That is the fear and the danger, the one
great menace to our young and growing African Empire.</p>

<p class="letter">
"God grant that you are successful and that you are
before Bartels, Wassmuss or any Senussi emissaries.</p>

<p class="letter">"What makes me anxious, is the possibility
of this new and remarkable Emir el Hamel el Kebir announcing
himself to be that very Mahdi whom the Bedouin tribes of that part
are always expecting&mdash;a sort of Messiah.</p>

<p class="letter">
"As you know, the Senussi Sidi el Mahdi, the holiest
prophet since Mahommet, is supposed to be still alive.
He disappeared at Garu on the way to Wadai, and an empty
coffin was buried with tremendous pomp and religious
fervour at holy Kufara. He reappears from time to time, in
the desert, and makes oracular pronouncements&mdash;and then
there is a sort of 'revival' hysteria where he is supposed
to have manifested himself.</p>

<p class="letter">
"If this Emir el Hamel el Kebir takes it into his head
to announce that he is the Mahdi, we shall get precisely
what the British got from their Mahdi at Khartoum&mdash;(and
that son of a Dongola carpenter conquered 2,000,000 square
miles in two years)&mdash;for he has got the strongest tribal
confederation yet known....</p>

<p class="letter">
"Well&mdash;I hope you won't be a Gordon, nor I a

<p class="letter">
"You get a treaty made with this Emir&mdash;whereby he
guarantees the trade routes, and guarantees the friendship
of his tributary tribes to us, and a 'hostile neutrality'
towards the Senussi and any European power in Africa, and
you will have created a buffer-state, just where France
needs it most.</p>

<p class="letter">
"Incidentally you will have earned my undying gratitude
and approbation&mdash;and what you like to ask by way of
recognition of such invaluable work.... We <u>must</u> have
peace in the East in view of the fact that the Riffs will
always give trouble in the West....</p>

<p class="letter">

you will have plenty of time for your preparations. (When
you get word, be gone in the same hour, and let nothing

caravans and saw this Mahdi or Prophet himself....
He also takes a very serious view, and thinks it means a jehad sooner or later.... And, mind you, he may be
Abd el Kadir (grandson of the Great Abd el Kadir, himself),
though I believe that devil is still in Syria.</p>

<p class="letter">
"The fellow is already a very noted miracle-monger and
has a tremendous reputation as a warrior. He is to the Emir
Mohammed Bishari bin Mustafha Korayim abd Rahu what the
eagle is to the hawk&mdash;a dead hawk too, according to an Arab
who fell in with Ibrahim Maghruf's caravan, when fleeing
from a great slaughter at the Pass of Bab-el-Haggar,
where this new 'Prophet' obliterated the Emir Mohammed
Bishari.... The said Arab was so bitter about the
'Prophet,' and had such a personal grudge, that d'Auray de
Redon cultivated him with talk of revenge and gold, and we
may be able to make great use of him.... I shall send
him to you at Zaguig with d'Auray de Redon who will bring
you word to start, and any orders that I do not care to
write....</p>

<p class="letter">
"In conclusion&mdash;regard this as <u>the</u> most important
thing in the world&mdash;to yourself, to me, and to
France...."</p>

<p class="first">
Attached to this letter was a sheet of notepaper on
which was written that which, later, gave me furiously
to think, and at the time, saddened and depressed me.
I wondered if it were intended as a warning and "<i>pour
encourager les autres</i>," for it was not like my uncle to
write me mere Service news.</p>

<p class="first">
"<i>By the way, I have broken Captain de Lannec, as I
promised him (and you too) that I would do to anyone who,
in any way, failed me....</i> A woman, of course<i>.... He
had my most strict and stringent orders to go absolutely
straight and instantly to Mulai Idris, the Holy City,
and establish himself there, relieving Captain St.
Andr&eacute;, with whom it was vitally important that I
should have a personal interview within the month.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Passing through the Zarhoun, de Lannec got word from
one of our friendlies that a missing Frenchwoman was in a
village among the mountains. She was the</i> amie <i>of a French
officer, and had been carried off during the last massacre,
and was in the</i> hareem <i>of the big man of the place....
It seems de Lannec had known her in Paris.... One
V&eacute;ronique Vaux.... Loved her, perhaps.... He
turned aside from his duty; he wasted a week in getting
the woman; another in placing her in safety; and then was
so good as to attend to the affairs of his General, his
Service and his Country!...</i></p>

<p>"<i>Exit de Lannec....</i>"</p>

<p class="first">
Serve him right, of course!... Yes&mdash;of
course....</p>

<p>A little hard?... Very, very sad&mdash;for he was a most
promising officer, a tiger in battle, and a fox on Secret
Service; no braver, cleverer, finer fellow in the French
Army.... But yes, it served him right, certainly....
He had acted very wrongly&mdash;putting personal feelings
and the fate of <i>a woman</i> before the welfare of France,
before the orders of his Commander, before the selfless,
self-effacing tradition of the Service.... Before his
<i>God</i>&mdash;Duty, in short.</p>

<p>He deserved his punishment.... Yes.... He had
actually put a mere woman before <i>Duty....</i> "<i>Exit de
Lannec.</i>" <i>...</i> Serve him right, poor devil....</p>

<p>And then the Imp that dwells at the Back of my Mind said
to the Angel that dwells at the Front of my Mind:</p>

<p>"<i>Suppose the captured woman, dwelling in that
unthinkable slavery of pollution and torture, had been that
beautiful, queenly and adored lady, the noble wife of the
stern General Bertrand de Beaujolais himself?</i>"</p>

<p>Silence, vile Imp! <i>No one</i> comes before Duty.</p>

<p>Duty is a Jealous God....</p>

<p class="first">
I was to think more about de Lannec ere long.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
I confess to beginning with a distinct dislike for
the extremely beautiful Miss Vanbrugh, when I met her at
dinner, at Colonel Levasseur's, with her brother. Her
brother, by the way, was an honorary ornament of the
American Embassy at Paris, and was spending his leave with
his adventurous sister and her maid-companion in "doing"
Algeria, and seeing something of the desert. The Colonel
had rather foolishly consented to their coming to Zaguig
"to see something of the <i>real</i> desert and of Empire in the
making," as Otis Hankinson Vanbrugh had written to him.</p>

<p>I rather fancy that the <i>beaux yeux</i> of Miss Mary,
whom Colonel Levasseur had met in Paris and at Mustapha
Sup&eacute;rieur, had more to do with it than a desire to
return the Paris hospitality of her brother.</p>

<p>Anyhow, a young girl had no business to be there at that
time....</p>

<p>Probably my initial lack of liking for Mary Vanbrugh
was prompted by her curious attitude towards myself, and
my utter inability to fathom and understand her. The
said attitude was one of faintly mocking mild amusement,
and I have not been accustomed to regarding myself as an
unintentionally amusing person. In fact, I have generally
found people rather chary of laughing at me.</p>

<p>But not so Mary Vanbrugh. And for some obscure reason
she affected to suppose that my name was "<i>Ivan</i>." Even
at dinner that first evening, when she sat on Levasseur's
right and my left, she addressed me as "<i>Major Ivan</i>."</p>

<p>To my stiff query, "Why <i>Ivan,</i> Miss Vanbrugh?" her
half-suppressed provoking smile would dimple her very
beautiful cheeks as she replied:</p>

<p>"But surely?... You <i>are</i> really <i>Ivan
What's-his-name</i> in disguise, aren't you?... Colonel
Levasseur told me you are a most distinguished Intelligence
Officer on Secret Service, and I think that must be one of
the Secrets...."</p>

<p>I was puzzled and piqued. Certainly I have played many
parts in the course of an adventurous career, but my duties
have never brought me in contact with Russians, nor have
I ever adopted a Russian disguise and name. Who was this
"<i>Ivan What's-his-name</i>"?... However, if the joke amused
her... and I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i> do that again, Major Ivan," she said.
"It <i>was</i> so delightfully French and expressive. You
dear people can talk with your shoulders and eyebrows
as eloquently as we barbarous Americans can with our
tongues."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;we are amusing little funny foreigners,
Mademoiselle," I observed. "And if, as Ivan
What's-his-name, I have made you smile, I have not lived
wholly in vain...."</p>

<p>"No. You have not, Major Ivan," she agreed. A cooler,
calmer creature I have never encountered.... A man might
murder her, but he would never fluster nor discompose her
serenity while she lived.</p>

<p>Level-eyed, slow-spoken, unhurried, she was something
new and strange to me, and she intrigued me in spite of
myself.</p>

<p>Before that evening finished and I had to leave that
wide moonlit verandah, her low rich voice, extreme
self-possession, poise, grace, and perfection almost
conquered my dislike of her, in spite of her annoying air
of ironic mockery, her mildly contemptuous amusement at me,
my sayings and my doings.</p>

<p>As I made my way back to my quarters by the Bab-el-Souq,
I found myself saying, "Who the devil <i>is</i> this <i>Ivan
What's-his-name?</i>" and trying to re-capture an air that she
had hummed once or twice as I sat coldly silent after some
piece of slightly mocking irony. How did it go?</p>

<center><img alt="Music" src="0601261h-images/BeauSabreur-music.jpg"
height="62" width= "554"></center>

<p>Yes, that was it.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
Miss Vanbrugh's curiosity and interest in native life
were insatiable. She was a living interrogation-mark,
and to me she turned, on the advice of the over-worked
Levasseur, for information&mdash;as it was supposed that what I
did not know about the Arab, in all his moods and tenses,
was not worth knowing.</p>

<p>I was able to bring that sparkling dancing flash of
pleasure to her eyes, that seemed literally to light them
up, although already as bright as stars, by promising
to take her to dinner with my old friend Sidi Ibrahim
Maghruf.</p>

<p>At his house she would have a real Arab dinner in real
Arab fashion, be able to see exactly how a wealthy native
lived, and to penetrate into the innermost arcana of a real
<i>hareem.</i></p>

<p class="first">
I had absolute faith in old Ibrahim Maghruf, and I had
known him for many years and in many places.</p>

<p>Not only was he patently and provenly honest and
reliable in himself&mdash;but his son and heir was in France,
and much of his money in French banks and companies. He
was a most lovable old chap, and most interesting too&mdash;but
still he was a <i>native,</i> when all is said, and his heart
was Arab.</p>

<p>It was difficult to realize, seeing him seated
cross-legged upon his cushions and rugs in the marble-tiled
French-Oriental reception-room of his luxurious villa,
that he was a self-made man who had led his caravans from
Siwa to Timbuctu, from Wadai to Algiers, and had fought
in a hundred fights for his property and life against the
Tebu, Zouaia, Chambaa, Bedouin, and Touareg robbers of the
desert. He had indeed fulfilled the Arab saying, "<i>A man
should not sleep on silk until he has walked on sand</i>."</p>

<p>Now he exported dates to France, imported cotton goods
from Manchester, and was a merchant-prince in Islam. And
I had the pleasant feeling that old Ibrahim Maghruf loved
me for myself, without <i>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e,</i> and
apart from the value of my reports to Government on the
subject of his services, his loyalty, and his influence.</p>

<p>In his house I was safe, and in his hands my secret
(that I was a French Intelligence-Officer) was safe; so if
in the maximum of gossip, inquiry and research, I told him
the minimum of truth, I told him no untruth whatsoever.
He, I believe, responded with the maximum of truth and
the minimum of untruth, as between a good Mussulman and a
polite, friendly, and useful Hell-doomed Infidel.</p>

<p>Anyhow, my disguise, my <i>hejin</i> camels&mdash;of the finest
breed, brindled, grey-and-white, bluish-eyed, lean, slender
greyhounds of the desert, good for a steady ten kilometres
an hour&mdash;and my carefully selected outfit of necessities,
watched night and day by my Soudanese orderly, Djikki, were
safe in his charge.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
It was on calling at the Vanbrughs' quarters in the big
house occupied by Colonel Levasseur, to take Miss Vanbrugh
to Sidi Maghruf's, that I first encountered the pretty and
piquant "Maudie," an artless and refreshing soul. She met
me in the verandah, showed me into the drawing-room, and
said that Miss Vanbrugh would be ready in half a minute. I
wondered if she were as flirtatious as she looked....</p>

<p class="first">
Maudie Atkinson, I learned later, was a London girl,&mdash;a
trained parlour-maid who had attracted Miss Vanbrugh's
notice and liking by her great courage, coolness and
resource on the occasion of a disastrous fire in the
English country-house at which Miss Vanbrugh was visiting.
Maudie had been badly burnt in going to the rescue of a
fellow-servant, and had then broken an arm in jumping out
of a window.</p>

<p>Visiting the girl in the cottage-hospital, and finding
that she would be homeless and workless when she left
the hospital, Miss Vanbrugh had offered her the post of
maid-companion, and in her democratic American way, treated
her much more as companion than maid....</p>

<p>When asked in Paris, by Miss Vanbrugh, if she were
willing to accompany her to Africa, Maudie had replied,</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss! That's where <i>the Sheikhs</i> live, isn't it?"
And on being assured that she need not be afraid of falling
into the hands of Arabs, had replied,</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss! I'd give anything in the world to be carried
off by a Sheikh! They <i>are</i> such lovely men. I <i>adores</i>
Sheikhs!"</p>

<p>Further inquiry established the fact of Maudie's belief
that Sheikhs were wealthy persons, clad in silken robes,
exhaling an odour of attar of roses, residing on the
backs of wondrous Arab steeds when not in more wondrous
silken tents&mdash;slightly sunburnt Young Lochinvars in fact,
and, like that gentleman, of most amazingly oncoming
disposition; and, albeit deft and delightful, amorous
beyond all telling.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Miss</i>," had Maudie added, "they catches you up
into their saddles and gallops off with you into the
sunset! No good smacking their faces neither, for they
don't take 'No' for an answer, when they're looking out for
a wife...."</p>

<p>"Or wives," Miss Vanbrugh had observed.</p>

<p>"Not if you're the first, Miss. They're true to
you.... And they fair <i>burn</i> your lips with hot kisses,
Miss."</p>

<p>"You can do that much for yourself, with hot tea,
Maudie.... Where did you learn so much about
Sheikhs?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I've got a book all about a Sheikh, Miss. By a
lady..."</p>

<p>"Wonder whether the fair sob-sister ever left her native
shores&mdash;or saw all her Sheikhs on the movies, Maudie?" was
Miss Vanbrugh's damping reply.</p>

<p>And when she told me all this, I could almost have
wished that Maudie's authoress could herself have been
carried off by one of the dirty, smelly desert-thieves;
lousy, ruffianly and vile, who are much nearer the average
"Sheikh" of fact than are those of the false and vain
imaginings of her fiction....</p>

<p><i>Some</i> Fiction is much stranger than Truth....</p>

<p class="first">
The dinner was a huge success, and I am not sure which
of the two, Sidi Ibrahim Maghruf or Miss Mary Vanbrugh,
enjoyed the other the more.</p>

<p>On my translating Ibrahim's courteous and sonorous,
"<i>Keif halak,</i> Sitt Miriyam! All that is in this house is
yours," and she had replied,</p>

<p>"What a bright old gentleman! Isn't he too cute and
sweet? I certainly should like to kiss him," and I had
translated this as,</p>

<p>"The Sitt admires all that you have and prays that God
may make you strong to enjoy it," we got down to it, and
old Ibrahim did his best to do us to death with the noblest
and hugest feast by which I was ever defeated....</p>

<p>A gazelle stalked solemnly in from the garden and
pattered over the marble floor.</p>

<p>"Major Ivan, it isn't gazelles that Grandpapa Maghruf
should pet. It's boa-constrictors..." groaned Miss
Vanbrugh, as the thirty-seventh high-piled dish was laid on
the red cloth at our feet....</p>

<p class="first">
The feast ended at long last and we got away, surprised
at our power to carry our burden, and staggered home
through the silent moonlit night, preceded by Dufour and
followed by Achmet (my splendid faithful servant, loving
and beloved, Allah rest his brave soul!)&mdash;and Djikki, for I
was taking no chances.</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">
For next day, at an hour before sunset, the good
Colonel Levasseur, in his wisdom, had decreed a formal and
full-dress parade of the entire garrison, to salute the
Flag, and "to impress the populace." It seemed to me that
he would certainly impress the populace with the fact of
the utter inadequacy of his force, and I told him so.</p>

<p>He replied by officiously ordering me to be present, and
"thereby render the garrison adequate to anything."</p>

<p>The good Levasseur did not like me and I wondered
whether it was on account of Miss Vanbrugh or the fact that
he was twenty years my senior and but one grade my superior
in rank.... Nor did I myself greatly love the good
Levasseur, a man very much <i>du peuple,</i> with his stubble
hair, goggle-eyes, bulbous nose, purple face and enormous
moustache, like the curling horns of a buffalo.</p>

<p>But I must be just to the brave Colonel&mdash;for he died in
Zaguig with a reddened sword in one hand and an emptied
revolver in the other, at the head of his splendid Zouaves;
and he gave me, thanks to this officious command of his,
some of the best minutes of my life....</p>

<p class="first">
Cursing <i>ce bon</i> Levasseur, I clattered down the wooden
stairs of my billet, in full fig, spurred cavalry-boots
and sword and all, out into a narrow stinking lane,
turned to the right&mdash;and began running as I believe I
have never run before or since, not even when I won the
senior quarter-mile at Eton&mdash;in somewhat more suitable
running-kit.</p>

<p>For I had seen a sight which made the blood run cold
throughout my body and yet boil in my head.</p>

<p>A woman in white riding-kit, on a big horse, followed by
a gang of men, was galloping across an open space.</p>

<p>One of the men, racing level with her and apparently
holding to her stirrup with one hand, drove a great knife
into her horse's heart with the other, just as she smashed
him across the head with her riding-crop.</p>

<p>As the horse lurched and fell, the woman sprang clear
and dashed through the open gate of a compound.</p>

<p>It all happened in less time than it takes to tell,
and by the time she was through the gate, followed by the
Arabs, I was not twenty yards behind.</p>

<p><i>Mon Dieu!</i> How I ran&mdash;and blessed Levasseur's
officiousness as I ran&mdash;for there was only one woman in
Zaguig who rode astride officers' chargers; only one who
wore boots and breeches, long coat and white solar-topi.</p>

<p>By the mercy of God I was just in time to see the last
of her pursuers vanish up a wooden outside stair that led
to the flat roof of a building in this compound&mdash;a sort
of fire-wood-and-hay store, now locked up and entirely
deserted, like the streets, by reason of the Review.</p>

<p>When I reached the roof, with bursting lungs and
dry mouth, I saw Miss Vanbrugh in a corner, her raised
riding-crop reversed in her hand, as, with set mouth and
protruding chin, she faced the bloodthirsty and bestial
fanatics, whom, to my horror, I saw to be armed with swords
as well as long knives.</p>

<p>In view of the stringent regulations of the Arms Act,
this meant that the inevitable rising and massacre was
about to begin, or had already begun.</p>

<p>It was no moment for kid-gloved warfare, nor for the
niceties of chivalrous fighting, and I drove my sword
through the back of one man who was in the very act of
yelling, "Hack the... in pieces and throw her to the
dogs," and I cut half-way through the neck of another
before it was realized that the flying feet behind them had
not been those of a brother.</p>

<p>My rush carried me through to Miss Vanbrugh, and as I
wheeled about, I laid one black throat open to the bone and
sent my point through another filthy and ragged <i>jellabia</i>
in the region of its owner's fifth rib.</p>

<p>And then the rest were on me, and it was parry, and
parry, and parry, for dear life, with no chance to do
anything else&mdash;until suddenly a heavy crop fell crashing on
an Arab wrist and I could thrust home as the stricken hand
swerved.</p>

<p>Only two remained, and, as I took on my hilt a smashing
blow aimed at my head, dropped my point into the brute's
face and thrust hard&mdash;the while I expected the other man's
sword in my side&mdash;I was aware, with the tail of my eye,
of a pair of white-clad arms flung round a black neck
from behind. As the great sword of the disconcerted Arab
went wildly up, I sprang sideways, and thrust beneath his
arm-pit....</p>

<p>Then I sat me down, panting like a dog, and fought for
breath&mdash;while from among seven bodies, some yet twitching
in the pool of blood, a spouting Thing dragged itself by
its fingers and toes towards the stairs.... Had I been
a true Hero of Romance, I should have struck an attitude,
leaning on my dripping sword, and awaited applause. In
point of actual fact, I felt sick and shaky.</p>

<p>"The boys seem a little&mdash;er&mdash;<i>fresh</i>," complained a
cool quiet voice, and I looked up from my labours of
breath-getting. She was pale, but calm and collected,
though splashed with blood from head to foot.</p>

<p>"<i>Some</i> dog-fight, Major Ivan," she said. "Are you
hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Vanbrugh," I answered. "Scratched and chipped
a bit, that's all.... Are you all right?... You are
the coolest and bravest woman I have ever met.... You
saved my life...."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" was the reply. "What about mine? I certainly
was in some trouble when you strolled in.... And I was
<i>mad</i> that I couldn't explain to these beauties that this
was the first time I had ever come out without my little
gun!... I could have wept at myself....</p>

<p>"Major, I'm going to be just a bit sick.... I've got
to go home right now.... Steward! <i>Basin</i>..."</p>

<p>I wiped my sword (and almost kissed it), sheathed it,
picked the girl up, and carried her like a baby, straight
to my quarters.... That I had heard no rifle-fire nor
mob-howling, showed that the revolt had not begun....</p>

<p>Achmet was on guard at my door, but Dufour had taken his
place at the Review as I had told him.</p>

<p>I laid her on my bed, brought cognac and water, and
said, "Listen, Miss Vanbrugh. I am going to bring your maid
here. Don't you dare go out of this room till I return with
her&mdash;in fact Achmet won't let you. There's going to be Hell
to-night&mdash;or sooner&mdash;and you'll be safer here than at the
Governor's house, until I can get <i>burkahs</i> and <i>barracans</i>
for you and the maid, and smuggle you down to Ibrahim
Maghruf's...."</p>

<p>"But what about all the pretty soldier-boys, won't they
deal with the Arabs?" interrupted the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, while they're alive to do it," I replied, and ran
off....</p>

<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p class="first">
Not a soul in the streets! A very bad sign, though
fortunate for my immediate purpose of getting Maudie to my
quarters unseen.</p>

<p>I had not far to go, and was thankful to find she was
at home. Otis Vanbrugh had gone out. I noted that the
maid was exhilarated and thrilled rather than frightened
and anxious, when I explained that there was likely to be
trouble.</p>

<p>"Just like Jenny What's-her-name, the Scotch girl in the
Indian Mutiny.... You know, sir, the Siege of Lucknow
and the bagpipes and all that.... I know a bit of po'try
about it.... Gimme half a mo', sir, and I'll put some
things together for Miss Mary.... <i>Lumme!</i> What a lark!"
and as the droll, brave little soul bustled off, I swear
she murmured "<i>Sheikhs!</i>"</p>

<p>Sheikhs! A lark! <i>Une escapade!...</i> And suppose
the house of Sidi Ibrahim Maghruf was the first that was
looted and burnt by a victorious blood-mad mob, as being
the house of a rich, renegade friend of the Hell-doomed
Infidel?...</p>

<p>"Hurry, Maudie," I shouted, and out she came&mdash;her
pretty face alight and alive at the anticipation of her
"lark"&mdash;with a big portmanteau or suit-case. Taking this, I
hurried her at top speed back to the Bab-el-Souq.</p>

<p>"Oh, my <i>Gord</i>! Look!" ejaculated poor Maudie as we
came to where the slaughtered horse lay in its blackening
pool, and a Thing still edged along with toes and
fingers, leaving a trail. It must have rolled down those
stairs....</p>

<p>Some of the bloom was gone from the "lark" for the gay
little Cockney, and from her bright cheeks too....</p>

<p class="first">
For me a stiff cognac and off again, this time to the
house of Sidi Ibrahim Maghruf. It was useless to go to
Colonel Levasseur yet. I had said all I could say, and
he had got all his men&mdash;for the moment&mdash;precisely where
they ought to be, all in one place, under one command;
and if the rising came while they were there, so much the
better.</p>

<p>I would see Sidi Ibrahim Maghruf, and then, borrowing a
horse, ride to Levasseur, tell him of the attack on Miss
Vanbrugh, assure him that the rising would be that night,
and beg him to act accordingly.</p>

<p class="first">
Sidi Ibrahim Maghruf's house, as usual, appeared to be
deserted, empty and dead. From behind high blind walls rose
a high blind house, and from neither of the lanes that
passed the place could a window be seen.</p>

<p>My private and particular knock with my sword-hilt&mdash;two
heavy, two light, and two heavy&mdash;brought a trembling
ancient to the iron-plated wicket in the tremendously heavy
door. It was good old Ali Mansur.</p>

<p>I stepped inside and the old mummy, whose eye was still
bright and wits keen, gave me a message which I doubt not
was word for word as his master and owner had delivered it
to him.</p>

<p>"Ya, Sidi, the Protection of the Prophet and the
Favour of Allah upon Your Honour's head. My Master has
been suddenly called away upon a journey to a far place,
and this slave is alone here with Djikki, the Soudanese
soldier. This slave is to render faithful account to
your Excellency of his property in the camel-sacks; and
Djikki, the Soudanese, is ready with the beautiful camels.
The house of my Master, and all that is in it, is at the
disposal of the Sidi, and these words of my Master are for
the Sidi's ear. '<i>Jackals and hyenas enter the cave of the
absent lion to steal his meat!</i>'"...</p>

<p>Quite so. The wily Ibrahim knew more than he had said.
He had cleared out in time, taking his family and money,
until after the massacre of the tiny garrison and the
subsequent looting was over, the town had been recaptured,
a sharp lesson taught it, and an adequate garrison
installed.... There is a time to run like the hare and a
time to hunt with the hounds.</p>

<p>No&mdash;this would be no place to which to bring the two
women.</p>

<p>I ordered the ancient Ali to tell Djikki to saddle me a
horse quickly, and then to fetch me any women's clothing
he could find&mdash;<i>tobhs, aabaias, foutas, guenaders, haiks,
lougas, melah'af, mendilat, roba, sederiya, hezaam,
barracan&mdash;</i>any mortal thing he could produce, of female
attire.</p>

<p>My big Soudanese, Private Djikki, grinning all over
his hideous face, brought the horse from the huge stables
in the big compound, reserved for camels, asses, mules,
well-bullocks, milch-cows and goats, and I once again gave
him the strictest orders to have everything absolutely
ready for a desert journey, at ten minutes' notice.</p>

<p>"It always is, Sidi," he grinned. "On my head and my
life be it."</p>

<p>There are times when I love these huge, fierce, staunch
Soudanese, childish and lazy as they are. (I had particular
reason to love this one.) They are like coal-black English
bull-dogs&mdash;if there are such things....</p>

<p>I again told him where to take the camels and baggage,
by way of the other gate, if the mob attacked the house.</p>

<p>The ancient returning with the bundle of clothing, I
bade Djikki run with it to my quarters and give it to his
old pal Achmet, and to come back at once.</p>

<p>I then mounted and rode off through the strangely
silent town, to where Colonel Levasseur was holding his
futile parade in the vast market-square&mdash;a poor handful
consisting of his 3rd Zouaves, a company of <i>Tirailleurs
Alg&eacute;riens</i>&mdash;possibly none too loyal when the Cry
of the Faith went up and the Mullahs poured forth from
the mosques to head a Holy War&mdash;and a half-squadron of
<i>Chasseurs d'Afrique.</i> What were these against a hundred
thousand fanatics, each anxious to attain remission of
sins, and Paradise, by the slaying of an Infidel, a
<i>giaour,</i> a <i>meleccha,</i> a dog whose mere existence was an
affront and an offence to the One God?</p>

<p>There should have been a strong brigade and a battery of
artillery in the place....</p>

<p>The old story of the work of the soldier ruined by the
hand of the politician&mdash;not to mention the subject of mere
lives of men....</p>

<p class="first">
A dense and silent throng watched the review, every
house-top crowded, every balcony filled, though no women
were visible, and you could have walked on the heads of the
people in the Square and in every street and lane leading
to the Square, save four, at the ends of which Levasseur
had placed pickets&mdash;for the easier scattering of his little
force after the parade finished!</p>

<p>By one of these empty streets I rode, and, through an
ocean of sullen faces, to where the Governor sat his horse,
his <i>officier d'ordonnance</i> behind him, with a bugler and a
four of Zouave drummers.</p>

<p>The band of the 3rd Zouaves was playing the
<i>Marseillaise,</i> and I wondered if its wild strains bore any
message to the silent thousands who watched motionless,
save when their eyes turned expectantly to the minaret
of the principal mosque.... To the minaret....
Expectantly?... Of course!</p>

<p>It was from there that the signal would come. On to that
high-perched balcony, like a swallow's nest on that lofty
tower, the muezzin would step at sunset. The deep diapason
of his wonderful voice would boom forth the <i>shehada,</i> the
Moslem profession of faith, "<i>Ash hadu illa illaha ill
Allah, wa ash hadu inna Mohammed an rasul Allah</i>"; he would
recite the <i>mogh'reb</i> prayer, and <i>then</i>&mdash;then he would
raise his arms to Allah and call curses on the Infidel; his
voice would break into a scream of "<i>Kill! Kill!</i>" and from
beneath every dirty <i>jellabia</i> would come sword and knife,
from every house-top a blast of musketry.... I could see
it all....</p>

<p>"You are late, Major," growled the Governor, accusingly
and offensively, as I rode up.</p>

<p>"I am, Colonel," I agreed, "but I am alive. Which none
of us will be in a few hours unless you'll take my advice
and expect to be attacked at odds of a hundred to one,
in an hour's time." And I told him of Miss Vanbrugh's
experience.</p>

<p>"Oh, you Intelligence people and your mares'-nests!
A gang of rude little street-boys I expect!" laughed
this wise man; and ten minutes later he dismissed the
parade&mdash;the men marching off in five detachments, to the
four chief gates of the city and to the Colonel's own
headquarters respectively.</p>

<p>As the troops left the Square, the mob, still silent,
closed in, and every eye was turned unwaveringly to the
minaret of the mosque....</p>

<h3>§ 7</h3>

<p class="first">
I rode back towards my quarters, cudgelling my brains as
to the best thing to do with the two girls. The Governor's
house would be in the thick of the fighting, and it was
more than probable that Ibrahim Maghruf's house would be
looted and burnt....</p>

<p>Yes, they would perhaps be safest in my quarters,
in Arab dress, with Achmet to defend them with tongue
and weapons.... I had better send for Otis Vanbrugh
too, and give him a chance to save himself&mdash;if he'd
listen to reason&mdash;and to look after his sister....
But my house was known as the habitation of a <i>Franzawi</i>
officer....</p>

<p>And I myself would be in an awkward dilemma, for it was
no part of my duty to get killed in the gutters of Zaguig
when my uncle was relying on me to be setting off on the
job of my life&mdash;that should crown the work of <i>his.</i> Nor
was it any part of my inclination to sit cowering in an
upper back room with two women and a civilian, while my
comrades fought their last fight.... Hell!...</p>

<p>As I swung myself down from my horse, by the door in the
lane at the back of my house, I was conscious of a very
filthy and ragged Arab, squatting against the wall on a
piece of foul old horse-blanket, his staff, begging-bowl,
and rosary beside him. He begged and held out his hand,
quavering for alms in the name of Allah, the Merciful,
the Compassionate&mdash;"<i>Bismillah arahman arahmim!</i>" in
Arabic&mdash;and in French, "<i>Start at once!</i>"...</p>

<p>The creature's eyes were bloodshot and red-rimmed, his
mangily-bearded cheeks were gaunt and hollow, his ribs
showed separate and ridged through the rents in his foul
<i>jellabia,</i> and a wisp of rag failed to cover his dusty
shaggy hair. And at the third stare I saw that it was my
friend, the beautiful and smart Captain Raoul d'Auray de
Redon.</p>

<p>I winked at him, led my horse to the stable on the other
side of the courtyard, and ran up the wooden stair at the
back of the house.... So it had come! I thought of my
uncle's letter and the underlined words&mdash;"<i>begone in the
same hour.</i>"</p>

<p>I tore off my uniform, pulled on my Arab kit, the
dress of a good-class Bedouin, complete from <i>agal</i>-bound
<i>kafiyeh</i> to red-leather <i>fil-fil</i> boots&mdash;and, as I did
this and rubbed dye into my face and hands, I thought of
a dozen things at once&mdash;and chiefly of the fate of the
girls.</p>

<p>I could not leave them alone in this empty house, and it
would be delivering them to death to take them back to the
Governor's villa....</p>

<p>I shouted for Achmet and learned that he had given the
Arab clothing to Miss Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>"Run to the house of His Excellency the Governor, and
tell the Roumi Americani lord, Vanbrugh, the brother of the
Sitt Miriyam Vanbrugh, to come here in greatest haste. Tell
him the Sitt is in danger here. Go on the horse that is
below, and give it to the Americani...."</p>

<p>This was ghastly! I should be <i>escaping in disguise</i>
from Zaguig, at the very time my brothers-in-arms were
fighting for their lives.... I should be leaving Mary
Vanbrugh to death or worse than death....</p>

<p>I ran down the stairs again and glanced round the
courtyard, beckoning to Raoul who was now sitting just
inside the gate. Turning back, I snatched up a cold chicken
and a loaf from my larder and, followed by Raoul, hurried
back to my room to make a bundle of my uniform. Wringing
Raoul's hand, I told him to talk while he ate and I worked.
He told me all about the Emir upstart and about the guide,
as he drew a route on my map.</p>

<p>"The tribes are up, all round the north-west of here,"
he said later, "and hurrying in. It's for sunset this
evening&mdash;as I suppose you have found out...."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and warned Levasseur.... He's besotted....
Says they'd never dare do anything while <i>he</i> and his
Zouaves are here! And he's got them scattered in small
detachments&mdash;and, Raoul, there are two <i>white</i> girls
here...."</p>

<p>"Where?" interrupted my friend.</p>

<p>"In the next room," I answered, and hurriedly told him
about them.</p>

<p>"God help them," he said. "They'll be <i>alone</i> in an
hour...."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" I asked. "Are you to come
with me?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;the General doesn't want us both killed by this
Emir lad, he says. And he thinks you're the man to pull
it off, now that poor de Lannec's gone.... I confess
I begged him to let me go, as it was I who brought him
confirmation of the news.... He said it was your right
to have the chance, Henri, on your seniority as well
as your record, apart from the fact that you'd handle
the situation better than I.... Said it was such
almost-certain death too, that he'd prefer to send his
own nephew!... I nearly wept, old chap, but he was
absolutely right. You are the man...."</p>

<p>Noble loyal soul! Steel-true and generous&mdash;knowing not
the very name of jealousy. He gave me every ounce of help,
information and guidance that it lay in his power to do.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I'm not even to come with you, Henri....
I shall join the mob here and lead them all over the
shop on false scents. Confuse their councils and start
rumours that there's a big French army at the gates, and
so on.... Then I'll get back with the news of what's
happened here.... There's one thing&mdash;it'll strengthen
the General's hand and get more troops into Africa, so poor
Levasseur and his men won't have..."</p>

<p>There came a bang at the door, Raoul crouched in a dark
corner and Otis Vanbrugh burst in, followed by Achmet.</p>

<p>"Where's my sister!" he shouted, looking wildly round
and seeing two Arabs, as he thought.</p>

<p>"I am Major de Beaujolais, Mr. Vanbrugh," said I.
"Your sister and her maid are in the next room&mdash;putting
on Arab dress. There will be a rising this evening and a
massacre.... The worst place for you and your sister
will be the Governor's house. Will you hide here until
it's over&mdash;and try to keep alive somehow until the French
troops arrive? Levasseur will start telegraphing the moment
fighting begins, but it'll be a matter of days before they
can get here&mdash;even if the wires aren't cut already&mdash;and
you and the two girls will be the sole living white
people in the city.... If you don't starve and aren't
discovered.... Anyhow, your only chance is to hide here
with the girls...."</p>

<p>"Hide nothing, sir!" burst out Vanbrugh. "I shall fight
alongside my host and his men."</p>

<p>"And your sister?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She'll fight too. Good as a man, with a gun."</p>

<p>"And when the end comes?" I said gently.</p>

<p>"Isn't there a chance?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not the shadow of a ghost of a chance," I said.
"Five little scattered detachments&mdash;each against ten
thousand! They'll be smothered by sheer numbers....
And you haven't seen an African mob out for massacre and
loot...."</p>

<p>"Let's talk to my sister," he answered, and dashed out
of the room.</p>

<p>"<i>Un brave,</i>" said Raoul as we followed.</p>

<p>He was&mdash;and yet he was a gentle, refined and scholarly
person, an ascetic-looking bookman and ornament of
Chancelleries. I had thought of James Lane Allen and
"Kentucky Cardinals," for some reason, when I first
met him. He had the eyes and forehead of a dreaming
philosopher&mdash;but he had the mouth and chin of a
<i>man....</i></p>

<p>In the next room were two convincing Arab females each
peering at us through the muslin-covered slit in the
all-enveloping <i>bourkah</i> that covered her from head to
foot.</p>

<p>"Say, Otis, what d'you know about <i>that,</i>" said one of
the figures, and spun round on her heel.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>sir,</i>" said the other, "<i>isn't</i> it a lark! Oh,
<i>Sheikhs!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, Shucks! you mean," replied Vanbrugh, and hastily
laid the situation before his sister.</p>

<p>"And what does Major Ivan say?" inquired she. "I think
we'd better go with him.... Doesn't he look cunning in
his Arab glad rags?"</p>

<p>I think I should have turned pale but for my Arab
dye.</p>

<p>"I'm leaving Zaguig at once," I said.</p>

<p>"Not <i>escaping?</i>" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am leaving Zaguig at once," I repeated.</p>

<p>"Major de Beaujolais has just received dispatches," said
Raoul in English, "and has to go."</p>

<p>"How <i>very</i> convenient for the Major!" replied Mary
Vanbrugh.... "And who's <i>this</i> nobleman, anyway, might
one ask?"</p>

<p>"Let me present Captain Raoul d'Auray de Redon," said I,
indicating the filthy beggar.</p>

<p>"Well, don't present him too close.... Pleased to
meet you, Captain. You <i>escaping</i> too?"</p>

<p>"No, Mademoiselle, I am not escaping," said Raoul, and
added, "Neither is Major de Beaujolais. He is going on
duty, infinitely against his will at such a time. But he's
also going to dangers quite as great as those in Zaguig at
this moment...."</p>

<p>I could have embraced my friend.</p>

<p>Miss Vanbrugh considered this.</p>

<p>"Then, I think perhaps I'll go with him," she said.
"Come on, Maudie. Grab the grip.... I suppose you'll
stay and fight, Otis? Good-bye, dear old boy, take care of
yourself..." and she threw her arms round her brother's
neck.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu,</i> what a girl!" Raoul laughed.</p>

<p>"You have heard of the frying-pan and the fire, Miss
Vanbrugh?" I began.</p>

<p>"Yes, and of pots and pans and cabbages and kings. I'm
quite tired of this gay city, anyway, and I'm coming along
to see this Where-is-it place...."</p>

<p>Vanbrugh turned to me.</p>

<p>"For God's sake take her," he said, "and Maudie too."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>yes,</i> sir," said Maudie, thinking doubtless of
Sheikhs.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;surely," chimed in Miss Vanbrugh. "Think of Major
Ivan's good name.... He <i>must</i> be chaperoned."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Vanbrugh," I said. "I can't take your
sister... I'm going on a Secret Service mission&mdash;of
the greatest importance and the greatest danger.... My
instructions are to go as nearly alone as is possible&mdash;and
I'm only taking three natives and a white subordinate
as guide, camel-man and cook and so forth.... It's
<i>impossible</i>..."</p>

<p>(No <i>de Lannec</i> follies for Henri de Beaujolais!)</p>

<p>But he drew me aside and whispered, "Good God, man, I'm
her brother! I <i>can't</i> shoot her at the last. You are a
stranger.... There is a <i>chance</i> for her, surely, with
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Impossible," I replied.</p>

<p>Some one came up the stair and to the door. It was
Dufour in Arab dress. He had hurried back and changed, in
his quarters.</p>

<p>"We should be out of this in a few minutes, sir, I
think," he said. "They are only waiting for the muezzin.
Hundreds followed each detachment to the gates...."</p>

<p>"We <i>shall</i> be out of it in a few minutes, Dufour," I
answered. "Get on down to Ibrahim Maghruf's. Take Achmet.
Don't forget anything&mdash;food, water, rifles, ammunition,
compasses. See that Achmet takes my uniform.... I'll be
there in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Let the gentle Achmet take the grip, then," said Miss
Vanbrugh, indicating her portmanteau.</p>

<p>Raoul touched my arm.</p>

<p>"Take the two girls in a <i>bassourab,</i>" he whispered.
"It would add to your plausibility, in a way, to have
a <i>hareem</i> with you.... You might be able to hand
them over to a north-bound caravan too, with promise of
a tremendous reward if they're taken safe to a French
outpost."</p>

<p>"Look here, couldn't Vanbrugh ride north-west with them
himself?" I suggested. "He's a plucky chap and..."</p>

<p>"And can't speak a word of Arabic. Not a ghost of a
chance&mdash;the country's swarming, I tell you. They wouldn't
get a mile. Too late..."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't <i>you...?</i>" I began.</p>

<p>"Stop it, Henri," he answered. "I'm not de Lannec...
My job's here, and you know it.... I may be able to
do a lot of good when they get going. Mobs always follow
anybody who's got a definite plan and a loud voice and
bloody-minded urgings...."</p>

<p>"De Beaujolais&mdash;what can I say&mdash;I <i>implore</i> you..."
began Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>"Very well," I said. "On the distinct understanding that
I take <i>no</i> responsibility for Miss Vanbrugh, that she
realizes what she is doing, and that I shall not deviate a
hair's breadth from what I consider my duty.... Not to
save her from death or torture...."</p>

<p>There could be no harm in my taking her out of the
massacre&mdash;but neither was <i>I</i> a de Lannec!</p>

<p>"Oh, Major! you <i>are</i> so pressing.... Come on,
Maudie, we're going from certain death to sure destruction,
so cheer up, child, and let's get busy..." said the
girl.</p>

<p>I turned away as Vanbrugh crushed his sister to his
breast, and with a last look round my room, I led the
way down the stairs, and out into the deserted silent
street, my ears tingling for the first mob-howl, the first
rifle-shot.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p class="verse">
"Somewhere upon that trackless wide, it may be we shall meet<br>
The Ancient Prophet's caravan, and glimpse his camel fleet."</p>

<p class="quote">A. Farquhar.</p>

<p class="first">
We were quite an ordinary party. Two sturdy desert
Bedouins, Dufour and I, followed by two heavily shrouded
females and trailed by a whining beggar&mdash;Raoul.</p>

<p>I had refused to let Vanbrugh come to Ibrahim Maghruf's
house with us, partly because his only chance of not being
torn to pieces in the streets was to get quickly back to
the Governor's, where he could use a rifle with the rest;
partly because I wanted him to take a last message and
appeal to the Governor; and partly because I did not want a
European to be seen going into Ibrahim's, should the place
be watched.</p>

<p>I had taken farewell of him in the compound of my
quarters, repeating my regrets that I could take <i>no</i>
responsibility for his sister, and feeling that I was
saying goodbye to a heroic man, already as good as dead.</p>

<p>He would not listen to a word about escaping from the
town and taking his chance with my party until we were well
away, and then shifting for himself.</p>

<p>He didn't desert friends in danger, he said; and with
a silent hand-grip and nod, we parted, he to hurry to his
death, and I to take his sister out into the savage desert
and the power of more savage fanatics&mdash;if she were not
killed or captured on the way....</p>

<p>All was ordered confusion and swift achievement at
Ibrahim Maghruf's house, as the splendid riding-camels were
saddled and the special trotting baggage-camels were loaded
with the long-prepared necessities of the journey.</p>

<p>Here Raoul presented to me a big, powerful and surly
Arab, apparently, named "Suleiman the Strong," who was to
be my guide. He was the man who had escaped from one of
this new Mahdi's slaughters, and been picked up by the
caravan in which Raoul had been carrying on his work,
disguised as a camel-driver....</p>

<p>This Suleiman the Strong actually knew the Mahdi,
having had the honour of being tortured by him personally;
and apparently he only lived for his revenge. I thought
he should be an extremely useful person, as he knew the
wells and water-holes on the route, though I did not like
his face and did not intend to trust him an inch farther
than was necessary. Anyhow, he would lead me to the Great
Oasis all right, for he had much to gain in the French
Service&mdash;pay, promotion and pension&mdash;and nothing to
lose.</p>

<p>Luckily there were spare camels, left behind by Ibrahim
Maghruf, as well as my own: and Djikki and Achmet soon had
a <i>bassourab</i> (a striped hooped tent&mdash;shaped something like
a balloon) on to a riding-camel for the girls, and another
baggage-camel loaded with extra sacks of dates, <i>girbas</i> of
water, and bags of rice, tea, coffee, sugar and salt, as
well as tinned provisions.</p>

<p class="first">
As I was helping the girls into the <i>bassourab,</i>
showing them how to sit most comfortably&mdash;or least
uncomfortably&mdash;and giving them strictest injunctions
against parting the curtains until I gave permission, Raoul
touched my arm.</p>

<p>"Better go, Major," he said. "<i>It's
begun</i>&mdash;hark!..."</p>

<p>As he spoke, a growing murmur, of which I had been
subconsciously aware for some minutes&mdash;a murmur like the
sound of a distant sea breaking on a pebble beach&mdash;rose
swiftly to a roar, menacing and dreadful, a roar above
which individual yells leapt clear like leaping spray above
the waves. Rifles banged irregularly and then came crash
after crash of steady volley-firing....</p>

<p>"<i>En avant</i>&mdash;<i>marche!</i>" said I; the old mummy opened the
compound gate; and I rode out first, on my giant camel,
followed by Djikki leading the one that bore the two girls.
After them rode Suleiman, in charge of the baggage-camels,
behind which came Achmet. Last of all rode Dufour.</p>

<p>For a minute, Raoul ran along the narrow lane in
front of us. As we turned into the street that led to
the southeastern gate&mdash;luckily not one of the four at
which poor Levasseur had stationed detachments&mdash;a mob of
country-dwelling tribesmen came running along it, waving
swords, spears, long guns and good rifles above their
heads, and yelling "<i>Kill! Kill!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Halt!... Back!...</i>" I shouted to Djikki, and
brought my little caravan to a stand-still at the mouth
of the lane, wondering if our journey was to end here in
Zaguig. I had my rifle ready, and Dufour, Djikki, Achmet
and Suleiman pushed up beside me with theirs....</p>

<p>The mob drew level.</p>

<p>"<i>Good-bye, Henri,</i>" said a voice from below me, and out
in front of them bounded Captain Raoul d'Auray de Redon&mdash;a
filthy dancing-dervish&mdash;span round and round, and then,
with his great staff raised in one hand and his rosary in
the other, yelled:</p>

<p>"<i>The Faith! The Faith! The Faith!... Kill!
Kill!...</i> This way, my brothers!... <i>Quick!
Quick!...</i> I can show you where there are infidel
dogs!... <i>White women!... Loot!</i>" and he dashed off,
followed by the mob, down a turning opposite to ours,
across the main street. That was the last I ever saw of
Raoul.</p>

<p class="first">
It was the last ever seen of him in life by any
Frenchman, save for the glimpses that Levasseur and his
comrades got, by the light of burning houses, of a wild
dervish that harangued the mob just when it was about to
charge&mdash;or led great sections of it off from where it could
do most harm to where it could do least.</p>

<p>One cannot blame poor Levasseur that he supposed the man
to be a blood-mad fanatical ring-leader of the mob&mdash;and
himself ordered and directed the volley that riddled the
breast of my heroic friend and stilled for ever the noblest
heart that ever beat for France.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
As the mob streamed off after their self-constituted
leader, I gave the word to resume the order of march, and
led the way at a fast camel-trot toward and through the
gate, and out into the open country.</p>

<p>I breathed more freely outside that accursed City of the
Plain.... Another small mob came running along the road,
and I swerved off across some irrigated market-gardens to
make a chord across the arc of the winding road.</p>

<p>A few scoundrels detached themselves from the mob and
ran towards us, headed by a big brute with a six-foot gun
in one hand and a great sword in the other. I did not see
how he could use both. He showed me.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer, I raised my rifle.</p>

<p>"Get your <i>own</i> loot," I snarled. "There's plenty more
in Zaguig...." There was a laugh, and half of them
turned back.</p>

<p>The leader however stuck his sword in the ground, knelt,
and aimed his long gun at my camel. Evidently his simple
system was to shoot the beasts of mounted men and then hack
the head off the rider as he came to earth.</p>

<p>However, rifles are quicker than <i>jezails,</i>
blunderbusses, snap-haunces or arquebusses, and without
reluctance I shot the gentleman through the head.</p>

<p>My followers, who, with a disciplined restraint
that delighted me, had refrained from shooting without
orders, now made up for lost time, and the remainder
of the tribesmen fled, doubtless under the impression
that they had stirred up a hornets' nest of loot-laden
Touareg....</p>

<p>I again pushed forward quickly, smiling to myself as
I remembered the small voice that had issued from the
<i>bassourab</i> after I had fired, remarking, "A bell-ringer
for Major Ivan!"</p>

<p>Evidently those <i>bassourab</i> curtains had been opened in
spite of what I had said....</p>

<p>A red glare lit the sky. The mob-howl&mdash;that most
terrible and soul-shaking of all dreadful sounds&mdash;rose
higher and louder, and the crashing volleys of disciplined
fire-control answered the myriad hangings of the guns and
rifles of the mob.</p>

<p>At a bend of the road, I found myself right into another
hurrying crowd, and I visualized the northern roads as
covered with them. There was no time to swerve, and into
them we rode.</p>

<p>"Hurry, brothers, or you'll be too late," I shouted, and
behind me my four followers yelled "<i>Kill! Kill!</i>" and we
were through the lot, either before they realized that we
were so few, or because they took us for what we were&mdash;a
well-armed band from whom loot would only be snatched with
the maximum of bloodshed.</p>

<p>And to these wild hill-tribesmen, the glare of the
burning city was a magnet that would have drawn them almost
from their graves.</p>

<p>On once again, and, but for a straggler here and there,
we were clear of the danger-zone.</p>

<p>In a couple of hours we were as much in the lonely
uninhabited desert as if we had been a hundred miles from
the town.</p>

<p>I held the pace however, and as we drove on into the
moonlit silence, I tried to put from me the thoughts of
what was happening in Zaguig, and of the fate of my beloved
friend and of my comrades whom harsh Duty had made me
desert in their last agony.... I yearned to flee from my
very self.... I could have wept....</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
It was after midnight when I drew rein and gave the word
to <i>barrak</i> the camels and to camp.</p>

<p>Before I could interfere, Djikki had brought the girls'
camel to its knees, with a guttural "<i>Adar-ya-yan,</i>"
and with such suddenness that poor Maudie was shot head
foremost out of the <i>bassourab</i> on to the sand, as a tired
voice within said,</p>

<p>"What is it <i>now?</i> Earthquakes?..."</p>

<p>Maudie laughed, and Miss Vanbrugh crawled out of the
<i>bassourab.</i> "Major," she observed, "I'm through with
the cabin of the Ship of the Desert.... The deck for
me. I don't ride any more in that wobbling wig-wam after
to-night.... And there isn't real <i>room</i> for two. Not to
be sea-sick in solid comfort."</p>

<p>"You'll ride exactly where and how I direct, Miss
Vanbrugh," I replied, "until I can dispose of you
somehow."</p>

<p>"<i>Dear</i> Major Ivan," she smiled. "I <i>love</i> to hear him
say his little piece," and weary as she was, she hummed a
bar of that eternal irritating air.</p>

<p>In a surprisingly short time we had the little <i>tentes
d'arbri,</i> which should have been mine and Dufour's, up and
occupied by the girls; fires lighted; water on to boil for
tea; a pot issuing savoury odours, as its contents of lamb,
rice, butter, vegetables and spice simmered beneath the eye
of Achmet, who turned a roasting chicken on a stick.</p>

<p>Maudie wanted to "wait" on Miss Vanbrugh and myself,
but was told by her kind employer and friend to want
something different. So the two girls, Dufour, and I
made a <i>partie-carr&eacute;e</i> at one fire, while Achmet
ministered to us; and Djikki and Suleiman fed the camels,
and afterwards did what Miss Vanbrugh described as their
"chores," about another.</p>

<p>After we had eaten, I made certain things clear to Miss
Vanbrugh and Maudie, including the matter of the strictest
economy of water for their ablutions, when we were away
from oases; and the absolute necessity of the promptest and
exactest obedience to my orders.</p>

<p>After supper the girls retired to the stick-and-canvas
camp-beds belonging to Dufour and myself; and I allotted
two-hour watches to Djikki, Achmet, and Suleiman, with
"rounds" for Dufour and myself at alternate hours.</p>

<p>Visiting the camels and stacked loads, I saw that all
was well&mdash;as I expected from such experienced desert-men as
my followers....</p>

<p>None of the water<i>-girbas</i> appeared to be leaking....
I rolled myself in a rug and lay down to count the
stars....</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
"Good-morning, Major Ivan," said a cool voice, at
daybreak next morning, as I issued stores and water for
breakfast. "Anything in the papers this morning?"</p>

<p>"I hope you and Maudie slept well, Miss Vanbrugh," I
replied. "Have you everything you want?"</p>

<p>"No, Kind Sir, she said," was the reply. "I want a hot
bath and some tea, and a chafing-dish&mdash;and then I'll show
you some <i>real</i> cookery."</p>

<p>She looked as fresh as the glorious morning, and as
sweet in Arab dress as in one of her own frocks.</p>

<p>"You may perhaps get a bath in a week or two," I
replied.</p>

<p>"A <i>hot</i> bath?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. In a saucepan," I promised.</p>

<p>"And to-day we're going to make a forced march," I
added, "with you and Maudie safe in the <i>bassourab.</i>
After that it will have to be the natural pace of the
baggage-camels and we'll travel mostly by night&mdash;and you
can ride as you please,&mdash;until we bid you farewell."</p>

<p>"Why at night?" asked the girl. "Not just for my
whims?"</p>

<p>"No.... Cooler travelling," I replied, "and the
camels go better. They can't see to graze&mdash;and our enemies
can't see <i>us.</i>"</p>

<p>"Of course. I was afraid you were thinking of what I
said about the <i>bassourab,</i> Major, and planning to save the
women and children...."</p>

<p>"How's Maudie?" I asked.</p>

<p>"All in, but cheerful," she replied. "She's not used to
riding, and her poor back's breaking."</p>

<p>"And yours?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I grew up on a horse," she laughed, "and can grow
old on a camel.... Let me dye my face and dress like
a man, and carry a rifle, Major. Maudie could have the
<i>bassourab</i> to herself then, with the curtains open."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," I replied.</p>

<p>All that day we marched, Suleiman riding far ahead, as
scout and guide....</p>

<p>After going my rounds that night, I had a talk with this
fellow, and a very interesting and illuminating talk it
was.</p>

<p>I learned, in the first place, that the Emir el Hamel
el Kebir was a desert "foundling," of whom no one knew
anything whatsoever.</p>

<p>This looked bad, and suggested one of the "miraculous"
appearances of the Mahdi el Senussi or an imitation of
it.</p>

<p>Also, from Suleiman's grudging admissions, and allowing
for his obvious hatred, the Emir appeared to be a mighty
worker of miracles in the sight of all men&mdash;an Invincible
Commander of the Faithful in battle, and a man of great
ability and power.</p>

<p>He was evidently adored by his own tribe&mdash;or the tribe
of his adoption, to whom he had appeared in the desert&mdash;and
apparently they regarded their present importance, success
and wealth, as their direct reward from Allah for their
hospitable acceptance of this "Prophet" when he had
appeared to them.</p>

<p>I reflected upon my earlier studies of the British
campaigns in Egypt against Osman Digna, and Mohammed Ahmed
the Mahdi, and the Khalifa&mdash;and upon the fate of any
Englishman who had ridden&mdash;with two white women&mdash;into the
camp of any of these savage and fanatical warriors.</p>

<p>On my trying to get some idea of the personality and
character of the Emir, Suleiman could only growl:</p>

<p>"He is a treacherous Son of Satan. He poisoned the old
Sheikh whose salt he had eaten, and he tortured me. <i>Me,</i>
who should have succeeded the good old man&mdash;to whom I was
as a son...."</p>

<p>This sounded bad, but there are two sides to every
story, and I could well imagine our Suleiman handsomely
earning a little torture.</p>

<p>"I fled from the Tribe," continued Suleiman, "and
went to the Emir Mohammed Bishari bin Mustapha Korayim
abd Rabu, who took me in and poured oil and wine into my
wounds....</p>

<p>"Him also this <i>Emir</i> el Hamel el Kebir slew, falling
upon him treacherously in the Pass of Bab-el-Haggar, and
again I had to flee for my life. A caravan found me weeks
later, at the point of death in the desert, and they took
me with them....</p>

<p>"The man who brought me to you befriended me from the
first, and showed me how to make a living as well as how
to get my revenge on this foul pretender and usurper.
This '<i>Emir</i>' el Hamel"&mdash;and the gentle Suleiman spat
vigorously.</p>

<p>"Are you a <i>Franzawi,</i> Sidi?" he asked, after a brief
silence.</p>

<p>"Like you, I work for them," I replied. "They pay,
splendidly, those who serve them well; but their vengeance
is terrible upon those who betray them&mdash;and their arm is
long," I added.</p>

<p>"Allah smite them," he growled; and asked, "Will they
send an army and wipe out this el Hamel?"</p>

<p>"What do I know?" I replied. "It is now for us to spy
upon him and report to them, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Let him beware my knife," he grunted, and I bethought
me that were I a Borgia, or my country another that I could
mention, here would be one way of solving the problem of
the new Mahdi menace.</p>

<p>"The <i>Franzawi</i> hire no assassins, nor allow
assassination," I replied coldly...." Keep good
watch..." and left him, pondering many things in my
heart....</p>

<p>Oh for a friendly north-bound caravan to whose leader I
might give these two girls, with a reasonably easy mind,
and every hope that they would be safe....</p>

<p>Poor old de Lannec.... None of that nonsense for
<i>me!</i></p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">
Day followed lazy day and night followed active night,
as weeks became a month and we steadily marched southeast;
but no caravan gladdened my eyes, nor sight of any human
being, away from the few oases, save once a lonely Targui
scout, motionless on his <i>mehara</i> camel on a high sand-hill
at evening.</p>

<p>After seeing this disturbing sight, I made a forced
march all through the night and far into the next day, and
hoped that we had escaped unseen and unfollowed.</p>

<p>I was very troubled in mind during these days.</p>

<p>Not only was my anxiety as to the fate of the two girls
constant, but I was annoyed to find that I thought rather
more about Mary Vanbrugh than about the tremendously
important work that lay before me.</p>

<p>My mind was becoming more occupied by this slip of a
girl, and less by my mission, upon which might depend
the issues of Peace and War, the lives of thousands of
men, the loss or gain of an Empire perhaps&mdash;certainly of
milliards of francs and years of the labour of soldiers and
statesmen....</p>

<p>I could not sleep at night for thinking of this woman,
and for thinking of her fate; and again for thinking of
how she was disturbing my thoughts which should have been
concentrated on Duty....</p>

<p>And she was adding to my trouble by her behaviour toward
me personally.</p>

<p>At times she appeared positively to loathe me, and again
at times she was so kind that I could scarcely forbear
to take her in my arms&mdash;when she called me "<i>Nice Major
Ivan,</i>" and showed her gratitude&mdash;though for what, God
knows, for life was hard for her and for poor Maudie, the
brave uncomplaining souls.</p>

<p>For the fact that her brother's fate must be a terrible
grief to her I made allowance, and ascribed to it her
changeful and capricious attitude toward me.</p>

<p class="first">
Never shall I forget one perfect night of full moon, by
a glorious palm-shaded desert pool, one of those little
oases that seem like Paradise and make the desert seem even
more like Hell.</p>

<p>It was an evening that began badly, too.</p>

<p>While fires were being lighted, camels fed, and tents
pitched, the two girls went to bathe.</p>

<p>Strolling, I met Maudie returning, and she looked so
fresh and sweet, and my troubled soul was so full of
admiration of her, for her courage and her cheerfulness,
that, as she stopped and, with a delightful smile, said:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, but is that Mr. Dufour a <i>married</i>
man?" I laughed and, putting a brotherly arm about her,
kissed her warmly.</p>

<p>With remarkable speed and violence she smacked my
face.</p>

<p>"<i>Maudie!</i>" said I aghast, "you misunderstood me
entirely!"</p>

<p>"Well, you won't misunderstand <i>me</i> again, sir, anyhow!"
replied Maudie, with a toss of her pretty head, and marched
off, chin in air.</p>

<p>As she did so, a tinkling laugh from among the palms
apprised me of the fact that Miss Vanbrugh had been an
interested witness of this romantic little episode!</p>

<p>Nothing was said at dinner that evening, however, and
after it, I sat apart with Mary Vanbrugh and had one of the
delightfullest hours of my life.</p>

<p>She began by speaking of her brother Otis, and the
possibilities of his being yet alive, and then of her
parents and of her other brother and sister.</p>

<p>Papa was what she called "a bold bad beef-baron," and
I gathered that he owned millions of acres of land and
hundreds of thousands of cattle in Western America.</p>

<p>A widower, and, I gathered, a man the warmth of whose
temper was only exceeded by the warmth of his heart. The
other girl, in giving birth to whom his beloved wife had
died, was, strangely enough, the very apple of his eye, and
she it was who kept house for him while Mary wandered.</p>

<p>The older brother had apparently been too like his
father to agree with him.</p>

<p>"Dad surely was hard on Noel," she told me, "and Noel
certainly riled Dad.... Would he go to school or
college? Not he! He rode ranch with the cow-boys and was
just one of them. Slept down in their bunk-house too. Ran
away from school as often as he was sent&mdash;and there Dad
would find him, hidden by the cow-boys, when he thought the
boy was 'way East.</p>

<p>"Dad was all for education, having had none
himself. Noel was all for avoiding it, having had some
himself....</p>

<p>"One merry morn he got so fresh with Dad, that when he
rode off, Dad pulled himself together and lassoed him&mdash;just
roped him like a steer&mdash;pulled him off his pony and laid
into him with his quirt!</p>

<p>"Noel jumped up and pulled his gun. Then he threw it on
the ground and just said, '<i>Good-bye, Dad. I'm through,</i>'
and that was the last we saw of brother Noel.... How
I did cry! I worshipped Noel, although he was so much
older than I. So did Dad&mdash;although Otis never gave him a
minute's trouble, and took to education like a duck....
He's a Harvard graduate and Noel's a 'roughneck,' if he's
alive...."</p>

<p>"And you never saw Noel again?" I said. I wanted to keep
her talking, to listen to that beautiful voice and watch
that lovely face.</p>

<p>"Never. Nor heard from him. We heard <i>of</i> him though
once&mdash;that after hoboing all over the States he was an
enlisted man in a cavalry regiment, and then that a
broncho-buster, whom our overseer knew, had seen him on a
cattle-ship bound for Liverpool."</p>

<p>"And now you roam the wide world o'er, searching for
the beloved playmate of your youth?" I remarked, perhaps
fatuously.</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" was the reply. "I've almost forgotten what he
looked like, and might not know him if I met him.... I'd
just love to see him again though&mdash;dear old Noel. He never
had an enemy but himself and never did a mean thing....
And now tell me all about <i>you,</i> Major Ivan, you stern,
harsh, terrible man!"...</p>

<p>I talked about myself, as a man will do&mdash;to the right
woman. And by-and-by I took her hand and she did not
withdraw it&mdash;rather clasped it as I said:</p>

<p>"Do you know, the devil tried to tempt me last night to
give the order to saddle up and ride north, and put you in
a place of safety...."</p>

<p>"Did you fall, Major?" she asked quietly&mdash;and yes, she
did return my pressure of her strong little hand.</p>

<p>"I did not even listen to the tempter," I replied
promptly. "But I'm feeling horribly worried and frightened
and anxious about you...."</p>

<p>"Business down yonder urgent, Major?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"And your chief's trusting you to put it through quick,
neat and clean?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then defy the devil and all his works, Major,"
she said, "and don't let my welfare interfere with
yours...."</p>

<p>"I shan't, Miss Vanbrugh," I replied. "But if we could
only meet a caravan..."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You don't play Joseph's Brethren with <i>me,</i>
Major."</p>

<p>"How can I take you into the power of a man who, for all
I know, may be a devil incarnate.... I should do better
to shoot you myself...."</p>

<p>"I was going to say, 'Make a camp near the oasis and
ride in alone,' but I shan't let you do that, Major."</p>

<p>"It is what I had thought of&mdash;but a man like this Emir
would know all about us and our movements, long before we
were near his territory.... And what happens to you, if
I am made a prisoner or killed? Dufour would not go without
me&mdash;nor would Achmet and Djikki for that matter."</p>

<p>"You are going to carry on, just as if I were not here,
my friend," she said, "and I'm coming right there with
you&mdash;to share and share alike. I can always shoot myself
when I'm bored with things.... So can Maudie. She's
got a little gun all right... I wouldn't be a drag on
you, Major, for anything in the world... Duty before
pleasure&mdash;of course...."</p>

<p>And as she said those words, and rubbed her shoulder
nestlingly against mine, I took her other hand... I drew
her towards me... I nearly kissed her smiling lips...
when she snatched her hand away, and, springing up, pointed
in excitement towards the oasis.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I cried in some alarm, for my nerves were
frayed with sleeplessness.</p>

<p>"I thought I saw a kind of winged elephant cavorting
above the trees. You know&mdash;like a flying shrimp or
whistling water-rat of the upper air, Major Ivan...."</p>

<p>And as I raged, she laughed and sang that cursed air
again, <i>with</i> words this time&mdash;and the words were:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"There are heroes in plenty, and well known to fame<br>
In the ranks that are led by the Czar;<br>
But among the most reckless of name or of fame<br>
Was Ivan Petruski Skivah.</p>

<p class="verse">"
"He could imitate Irving, play euchre, or pool,<br>
And perform on the Spanish guitar:&mdash;<br>
In fact, quite the cream of the Muscovite team<br>
Was <i>Ivan</i> Petruski Skivah."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
Damn the girl, she had been laughing at me the whole
time!</p>

<p>I gave the order to saddle up and did a double march, on
towards the south of the rising sun&mdash;when it did rise&mdash;to
punish her for her impertinence and to remind her that she
was only with me on sufferance.... She should see who
was the one to laugh last in <i>my</i> caravan....</p>

<p>And, <i>mon Dieu!</i> What a fool de Lannec was!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c109" id="c109"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE TOUAREG&mdash;AND "DEAR IVAN"</h3>

<p class="first">
One or two days later, as we jogged along in the "cool"
of the evening, Dufour, the trusty rearguard of my little
caravan, rode up to me.</p>

<p>"We're followed, sir," said he. "Touareg, I think. I
have sent Djikki back to scout."</p>

<p>"If they're Touareg they'll surround our next camp and
rush us suddenly," I said. "Our night-travelling has upset
them, as there has been no chance for the surprise-at-dawn
that they're so fond of."</p>

<p>"They'll follow us all night and attack when they think
we are busy making camp to-morrow morning," said Dufour.</p>

<p>"We'll try to shake them off by zig-zagging and
circling," I replied. "If it weren't for the women, it
would be amusing to ride right round behind them and
attack.... They may be only a small gang and not a
<i>harka.</i>"</p>

<p>Mary Vanbrugh closed up. I had been riding ahead in
haughty displeasure, until Dufour came to me.</p>

<p>I had done with Mary Vanbrugh. "What is it, Major?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing, Miss Vanbrugh," I replied.</p>

<p>"What men-folk usually wag their heads and their tongues
about," she agreed.</p>

<p>Maudie's <i>bassourab</i>-adorned camel overtook us as we
dropped into a walk and then halted.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mr. Dufour?" I heard her ask.</p>

<p>"<i>Sheikhs!</i>" replied Dufour maliciously, and I wondered
if his face had also been slapped.</p>

<p>I looked at Maudie. Methought she beamed joyously.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Djikki of the wonderful eye-sight
came riding up at top-speed.</p>

<p>"Veiled Touareg," he said. "The Forgotten of God. About
five hands of fingers. Like the crescent moon&mdash;" from which
I knew that we were being followed by about five and twenty
Touareg, and that they were riding in a curved line&mdash;the
horns of which would encircle us at the right time.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to ride on. We were
five rifles&mdash;six counting Mary Vanbrugh&mdash;and shooting
from behind our camels we should give a good account
of ourselves against mounted men advancing over open
country.</p>

<p>Nor would so small a gang resolutely push home an
attack upon so straight-shooting and determined a band as
ourselves.</p>

<p>But what if they managed to kill our camels?</p>

<p>"Ride after Suleiman as fast as you can, Miss Vanbrugh,
with Maudie. Achmet will ride behind you," said I. "You and
I and Djikki will do rear-guard, Dufour...."</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed if you hear firing," I added to the
girls.</p>

<p>"Oh, Major, I shall jibber with fright, and look foolish
in the face," drawled Mary Vanbrugh, and I was under the
impression that Maudie's lips parted to breathe the word
"<i>Sheikhs!</i>"</p>

<p>We rode in this order for an hour, and I then left
Djikki on a sand-dune, with orders to watch while the light
lasted. I thought he would get our pursuers silhouetted
against the sunset and see if their numbers had increased,
their formation or direction changed, and judge whether
their pace had quickened or slackened.</p>

<p>"As soon as it is dark, we'll turn sharp-right, for a
couple of hours, and then left again," I said to Dufour.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said he. "They won't be able to follow
tracks in the dark. Not above a walking pace."</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken when a rifle cracked....
Again twice.... Aimed from us, by the sound....
Djikki!... We wheeled round together and rode back along
our tracks. We passed Djikki's <i>barraked</i> camel and saw the
Soudanese lying behind the crest of a sand-hill. He stood
up and came down to us.</p>

<p>"Three," he said. "Swift scouts in advance of the rest.
I hit one man and one camel. The others fled. Four hundred
metres."</p>

<p>For a Soudanese it was very fine marksmanship.</p>

<p>"It'll show them we're awake, anyhow," said Dufour; and
we rode off quickly, to overtake the others.</p>

<p>As soon as it was as dark as it ever is in the star-lit
desert, I took the lead, and turned sharply from our line
as we were riding over a rocky stony patch that would show
no prints of the soft feet of camels.</p>

<p>For an hour or two I followed the line, and then turned
sharply to the left, parallel with our original track.</p>

<p>Thereafter I dropped to the rear, leaving Dufour to
lead. I preferred to rely upon his acquired scientific
skill rather than upon Suleiman's desert sense of
direction, when I left the head of the caravan at night.
Dropping back, I halted until I could only just see the
outline of the last rider, Achmet, sometimes as a blur of
white in the star-shine, sometimes as a silhouette against
the blue-black starry sky....</p>

<p>Vast, vast emptiness.... Universes beyond
universes.... Rhythmic fall of soft feet on sand....
Rhythmic swaying of the great camel's warm body....
World swaying.... Stars swaying....</p>

<p>I will not falsely accuse myself of having fallen
asleep, for I do not believe I slept&mdash;though I have done
such a thing on the back of a camel. But I was certainly
slightly hypnotized by star-staring and the perfect rhythm
of my camel's tireless changeless trot.... And I had
been very short of sleep for weeks.... Perhaps I did
sleep for a few seconds?...</p>

<p>Anyhow, I came quite gradually from a general
inattentiveness toward the phenomena of reality, to an
interest therein, and then to an awareness that gripped my
heart like the clutch of a cold hand.</p>

<p>First I noted dully that I had drawn level with Achmet
and was some yards to his right.... Then that Djikki, or
Suleiman perhaps, was riding a few yards to my right....
And then that some one else was close behind me.</p>

<p>I must have got right into the middle of the caravan.
Curious.... <i>Why, what was this?...</i> I rubbed my
eyes.... None of <i>us</i> carried a lance or spear of any
kind!</p>

<p>It was then that my blood ran cold, for I knew I was
<i>riding with the Touareg!</i></p>

<p>I pulled myself together and did some quick thinking.
Did each of them take me for some other member of their
band who had ridden to the front and been overtaken
again? Or were they chuckling to themselves at the poor
fool whom they had outwitted, and who was now in their
power?...</p>

<p>Was it their object to ride on with me, silently, until
the Touareg band and the caravan were one body&mdash;and then
each robber select his victim and slay him?</p>

<p>What should I do? My rifle was across my thighs. No; I
could not have been asleep or I should have dropped it.</p>

<p>I slowly turned my head and looked behind me. I could
see no others&mdash;but it was very dark and others might
be near, besides the three whom I could distinguish
clearly.</p>

<p>Achmet was not in sight. What <i>should</i> I do?...</p>

<p><i>Work, poor brain, work!</i> Her life depends on
it....</p>

<p>Could I draw ahead of them sufficiently fast to overtake
the caravan, give a swift order, and have my men wheeled
about and ready to meet our pursuers with a sudden volley
and then rapid fire?</p>

<p>I could try, anyhow. I raised the long camel-stick that
dangled from my wrist, and my camel quickened its pace
instantly. There is never any need to strike a well-trained
<i>mehara....</i> The ghostly riders to right and left of me
kept their positions.... I had gained nothing....</p>

<p>I must not appear to be trying to escape.... With
faint pressure on the left nose-rein of my camel, I
endeavoured to edge imperceptibly toward the shadow on
my left. I would speak to him as though I were a brother
Targui, as soon as I was close enough to shoot with
certainty if he attacked me.</p>

<p>The result showed me that the raiders had not taken me
for one of themselves&mdash;I could get no nearer to the man,
nor draw further from the rider on my right....</p>

<p>Wits against wits&mdash;and Mary Vanbrugh's life in the
balance....</p>

<p>Gently I drew rein, and slowed down very gradually. My
silent nightmare companions did the same.</p>

<p>This would let the caravan draw ahead of us, and give my
men more time for action, when the time for action came.</p>

<p>Slower and slower grew my pace, and I drooped forward,
nodding like a man asleep, my eyes straining beneath my
<i>haik</i> to watch these devils who shepherded me along.</p>

<p>My camel dropped into a walk, and very gradually the two
shadows converged upon me to do a silent job with sword or
spear....</p>

<p>And what of the man behind me? The muscles of my
shoulder-blades writhed as I thought of the cold steel that
even then might be within a yard of my back....</p>

<p>Suddenly I pulled up, raised my rifle, and fired
carefully, and with the speed that has no haste, at the
rider on my right. I aimed where, if I missed his thigh, I
should hit his camel, and hoped to hit both. As my rifle
roared in the deep silence of the night, I swung left for
the easier shot, fired again, and drove my camel bounding
forward. I crouched low, as I worked the bolt of my rifle,
in the hope of evading spear-thrust or sword-stroke from
behind.</p>

<p>As I did so a rifle banged behind me, at a few yards
range, and I felt as though my left arm had been struck
with a red-hot axe.</p>

<p>With the right hand that held the rifle, I wheeled my
camel round in a flash, steadied the beast and myself and,
one-handed, fired from my hip at a camel that suddenly
loomed up before me. Then I wheeled about again and sent my
good beast forward at racing speed.</p>

<p>My left arm swung useless, and I could feel the blood
pouring down over my hand, in a stream....</p>

<p>This would not do....</p>

<p>I shoved my rifle under my thigh, and with my right hand
raised my left and got the arm up so that I could hold it
by the elbow, with the left hand beneath my chin.</p>

<p>I fought off the feeling of faintness caused by
shock and the loss of blood&mdash;and wondered if Suleiman,
Djikki, Achmet and Dufour would shoot first and challenge
afterwards, as I rode into them....</p>

<p>Evidently I had brought down the three camels at which I
had aimed&mdash;not a difficult thing to do, save in darkness,
and when firing from the back of a camel, whose very
breathing sways one's rifle....</p>

<p>I was getting faint again.... It would soon pass
off.... If I could only plug the holes and improvise
a sling.... As the numbness of the arm wore off and
I worried at it, I began to hope and believe that the
bone was not broken.... Fancy a shattered elbow-joint,
in the desert, and with the need to ride hard and
constantly....</p>

<p>I was aware of three dark masses in line....</p>

<p>"Major! <i>Shout!</i>" cried a voice, and with great
promptitude I shouted&mdash;and three rifles came down from the
firing position.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I made her ride on with Achmet, hell-for-leather,"
replied Dufour. "I swore she'd help us more that way, till
we can see what's doing.... What happened, sir?"</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>"They'll trail us all right," said Dufour. "Those were
scouts and there would be a line of connecting-links
between them and the main body. Shall we wait, and get them
one by one?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied. "They'd circle us and they'd get
the others while we waited here. It'll be daylight
soon...."</p>

<p class="first">
It was in the dim daylight of the false dawn that we
sighted the baggage-camels of the caravan.</p>

<p>"Those baggage-camels will have to be left," said
Dufour.</p>

<p>"You can't ride away from Touareg," I answered.</p>

<p>"It's hopeless. We've got to fight, if they attack. They
may not do so, having been badly stung already. But the
Targui is a vengeful beast. It isn't as though they were
ordinary Bedouin...."</p>

<p>The light grew stronger, and we drew near to the others.
I told Djikki to drop back and to fire directly he saw
anything of the robbers&mdash;thus warning us, and standing them
off while we made what preparations we could.</p>

<p>I suddenly felt extremely giddy, sick, and faint. My
white <i>burnous</i> made a ghastly show. I was wet through,
from my waist to my left foot, with blood. I must have lost
a frightful lot... artery....</p>

<p>Help!...</p>

<p class="first">
The next thing that I knew was that I was lying with my
head on Maudie's lap, while Mary Vanbrugh, white of face
but deft of hand, bandaged my arm and strapped it across
my chest. She had evidently torn up some linen garment
for this purpose. Mary's eyes were fixed on her work, and
Maudie's on the horizon. The men were crouched each behind
his kneeling camel.</p>

<p>"<i>Dear</i> Major Ivan," murmured Mary as she worked.</p>

<p>I shut my eyes again, quickly and without shame. It was
heavenly to rest thus for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Oh, is he <i>dead,</i> Miss?" quavered poor Maudie.</p>

<p>"We shall all be dead in a few minutes, I expect,
child," replied Mary. "Have you a safety-pin?... Dead
as cold mutton.... <i>Sheikhs,</i> my dear!... Shall I
shoot you at the last, Maudie, or would you rather do it
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if you wouldn't <i>mind,</i> Miss? Thank you very
much, if it's not troubling you."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"<i>Dear</i> Major Ivan," came a sweet whisper. "Oh, I <i>have</i>
been a beast to him, Maudie.... Yes, I'll shoot you with
pleasure, child.... How <i>could</i> I be such a wretch as
to treat him like that.... He is the bravest, nicest,
sternest..."</p>

<p>I felt a cad, and opened my eyes&mdash;almost into those of
Mary, whose lips were just... were they... <i>were</i>
they?...</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss," said Maudie, her eyes and thoughts afar
off. "He is a beautiful gentleman...."</p>

<p>"Hallo! the patient has woken up!" cried Mary,
drawing back quickly. "Had a nice nap, Major? How do you
feel?... Here, have a look into the cup that cheers and
inebriates"; and she lifted a mug, containing cognac and
water, to my lips.</p>

<p>I drank the lot and felt better.</p>

<p>"My heart come into my mouth it did, sir, when I saw you
fall head-first off that camel. You fair <i>splashed</i> blood,
sir," said Maudie. "Clean into me mouth me heart come,
sir."</p>

<p>"Hope you swallowed the little thing again, Maud. Such
a sweet <i>garden</i> of romance as it is!... '<i>Come into
the maud, Garden!</i>' for a change.... That's the way,
Major.... Drinks it up like milk and looks round for
more. Got a nice clean flesh wound and no bones touched,
the clever man...."</p>

<p>I sat up.</p>

<p>"Get those camels further apart, Dufour," I shouted.
"Absolute focal point to draw concentrated fire bunched
like that..."</p>

<p>Nobody must think that I was down and out, and that the
reins were slipping from a sick man's grasp.</p>

<p>The men were eating dates as they watched, and Mary had
opened a tin of biscuits and one of sardines.</p>

<p>"Hark at the Major saying his piece," a voice murmured
from beneath a flowing <i>kafiyeh</i> beside me. "Isn't he
fierce this morning!"</p>

<p>I got to my feet and pulled myself together....
Splendid.... Either the brandy, or the idea of a kiss
I foolishly fancied that I had nearly received, had gone
to my head. I ate ravenously for the next ten minutes, and
drank cold tea from a water-bottle.</p>

<p>"There's many a slip between the kiss and the lip," I
murmured anon, in a voice to match the one that had last
spoken.</p>

<p>I was unwise.</p>

<p>"Wrong again, Major Ivan Petruski Ski<i>vah</i>! I was just
going to blow a smut off your grubby little nose," was the
prompt reply, and I seemed to hear thereafter a crooning
of:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"But among the most reckless of name and of fame<br>
Was Ivan Petruski Skivah...<br>
..........<br>
...and perform on the Spanish guitar<br>
In fact, quite the cream of 'Intelligence' team<br>
Was Ivan Petruski Skivah..."</p>

<br>

<p>...as Miss Vanbrugh cleaned her hands with sand and then re-
packed iodine and boric lint in the little medicine-
chest.</p>

<p>I managed to get on to my camel, and soon began to feel
a great deal better, perhaps helped by my ferocious anger
at myself for collapsing. Still, blood is blood, and one
misses it when too much is gone.</p>

<p>"Hide on with Achmet again," I called to Miss Vanbrugh,
and bade the rest mount. "We'll keep on now, just as long
as we can," I said to Dufour, and ordered Djikki to hang
as far behind us as was safe. In a matter of that sort,
Djikki's judgment was as good as anybody's....</p>

<p>Dufour then told me a piece of news.</p>

<p>A few miles to the south-east of us was, according to
Suleiman, a <i>shott,</i> a salt-lake or marsh that extended
to the base of a chain of mountains. The strip of country
between the two was very narrow.</p>

<p>We could camp there.</p>

<p>If the Touareg attacked us, they could only do so on a
narrow front, and could not possibly surround us. To go
north round the lake, or south round the mountains, would
be several days' journey.</p>

<p>"That will be the place for us, sir," concluded
Dufour.</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed, "if the Touareg are not there before
us."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c110" id="c110"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>MY ABANDONED CHILDREN</h3>

<p class="first">
That would have been one of the worst days of my life,
and that is saying a good deal, had it not been for a
certain exaltation and joy that bubbled up in my heart as
I thought of the look in Miss Vanbrugh's eyes when I had
opened mine....</p>

<p>What made it so terrible was not merely the maddening
ache in my arm that seemed to throb in unison with the
movement of my camel, but the thought of what I must do if
this pass was what I pictured it to be, and if the Touareg
attacked us in strength.</p>

<p>It would be a very miserable and heart-breaking duty&mdash;to
ride on and leave my men to hold that pass&mdash;that I might
escape and fulfil my mission. How could I leave Dufour
to die that I might live? How could I desert Achmet and
Djikki, my servants and my friends?...</p>

<p>However&mdash;it is useless to attempt to serve one's country
in the Secret Service, if one's private feelings, desires,
loves, sorrows, likes and dislikes are to be allowed to
come between one and one's country's good.... Poor de
Lannec! How weak and unworthy he had been....</p>

<p>There was one grain of comfort&mdash;nothing would be gained
by my staying and dying with my followers.... It would
profit them nothing at all.... They would die just the
same....</p>

<p>If the Touareg could, by dint of numbers, overcome four,
they could overcome five. I could not save them by staying
with them....</p>

<p>But oh, the misery, the agony, of ordering them to hold
that pass while I rode to safety!</p>

<p>How could I give the order: "Die, but do not
retire&mdash;until <i>I</i> have had time to get well away"?</p>

<p>And the girls? Would they be a hindrance to me on two
of the fleetest camels.... And perhaps any of my little
band who did not understand my desertion of them would
think they were fighting to save the women, whom I was
taking to safety&mdash;<i>if I decided to take them.</i></p>

<p>But it would be ten times worse than leaving my comrades
in Zaguig....</p>

<p>How could I leave <i>Mary Vanbrugh</i>&mdash;perhaps to fall,
living, into the hands of those bestial devils?</p>

<p class="first">
The place proved an ideal spot for a rearguard action,
and the Touareg were not before us.</p>

<p>Lofty and forbidding rocks rose high, sheer from the
edge of a malodorous swamp, from whose salt-caked edge grew
dry bents that rattled in the wind.</p>

<p>Between the swamp and the stone cliffs was a tract of
boulder-strewn sand, averaging a hundred yards in width.</p>

<p>Here we camped, lit fires, and prepared to have a long
and thorough rest&mdash;unless the Touareg attacked&mdash;until
night.</p>

<p>Achmet quickly pitched the little <i>tentes d'abri,</i> fixed
the camp-beds for the girls, and unrolled the "flea-bags"
and thin mattresses, while his kettle boiled. It was a
strangely peaceful and domestic scene&mdash;in view of the fact
that sudden death&mdash;or slow torture&mdash;loomed so large and
near.</p>

<p>Dufour himself ungirthed and fed the camels while
Suleiman stood upon a rock and stared out into the desert.
He could probably see twice as far as Dufour or I....</p>

<p>"<i>Into</i> that tent, Major," said the cool sweet voice
that I was beginning to like again. "I have made the bed as
comfy as I can. Have Achmet pull your boots off. I'll come
in ten minutes or so, and dress your arm again."</p>

<p>"And what about <i>you?</i>" I replied. "I'm not going to
take your tent. I am quite all right now, thanks."</p>

<p>"Maudie and I are going to take turns on the other bed,"
she replied. "And you <i>are</i> going to take 'my' tent, and
lie down too. What's going to happen to the show if you get
ill? Suppose you get fever? Suppose your arm mortifies and
falls into the soup?... Let's get the wound fixed again,
before those low-brow Touareg shoot us up again....
You'll find a cold water compress very soothing.... Go
along, Major...."</p>

<p>I thought of something more soothing than that&mdash;the
touch of cool deft fingers.</p>

<p>"I'd be shot daily if you were there to bind me up, Miss
Vanbrugh," I said as I gave in to her urgency, and went to
the tent.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;perhaps they'll oblige after breakfast, Major,
and plug your other arm," observed this most unsentimental
young woman.</p>

<p>"But, my dear!" I expostulated. "If I had no arms at
all, how could I...?"</p>

<p>"Just what <i>I</i> was thinking, Major," was the reply, as,
to hide a smile, she stooped over the big suit-case and
extracted the medicine chest....</p>

<p>As we hastily swallowed our meal of dates, rice,
biscuits and tinned milk, I gave my last orders to
Dufour....</p>

<p>"You'll hold this pass while there is a man of you
alive," I said.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, mon Commandant,</i>" replied the brave man, with
the same quiet nonchalance that would have marked his
acknowledgment of an order to have the camels saddled.</p>

<p>"Should the Touareg abandon the attempt (which they will
not do), any survivor is to ride due south-east until he
reaches the Great Oasis."</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, mon Commandant.</i>"</p>

<p>"Even if Suleiman is killed, there will be no difficulty
in finding the place, but we'll hear what he has to say
about wells and water-holes&mdash;while he is still hale and
hearty."</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, mon Commandant.</i>"</p>

<p>"But I fear there won't be any survivors&mdash;four against
a <i>harka</i>&mdash;say, a hundred to one.... But you must hold
them up until I am well away.... They won't charge while
your shooting is quick and accurate.... When they do,
they'll get you, of course.... Don't ride for it at
the last moment.... See it through here, to give the
impression that you are the whole party. I must not be
pursued.... Die here...."</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, mon Commandant.</i>"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Major de Beaujolais," cut in the voice
of Miss Vanbrugh, icily cold and most incisive, "is
it possible that you are talking about <i>deserting
your men?...</i> Leaving them to die here while you
escape?... <i>Ordering</i> them to remain here to increase
your own chance of safety, in fact...."</p>

<p>"I was giving instructions to my subordinate, who
will remain here with the others, Miss Vanbrugh," I
replied coldly. "Would you be good enough to refrain from
interrupting...."</p>

<p>My uncle's words burned before my eyes!&mdash;"<i>A woman, of
course!... He turned aside from his duty.... Exit de
Lannec...</i> ."</p>

<p>Miss Vanbrugh put her hand on Dufour's arm.</p>

<p>"If you'll be so kind as to enrol me, Mr. Dufour&mdash;I am a
very good rifle shot," she said. "I shall dislike perishing
with you intensely, but I should dislike deserting you
infinitely more," and she smiled very sweetly on my brave
Dufour.</p>

<p>He kissed her hand respectfully and looked inquiringly
at me.</p>

<p>"And Maudie?" I asked Miss Vanbrugh. "Is she to be a
romantic heroine, too? I hope she can throw stones better
than most girls, for I understand she has never fired a
rifle or pistol in her life...."</p>

<p>"I think you really are the most insufferable and
detestable creature I have <i>ever</i> met," replied Miss
Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>"Interesting, but hardly germane to the discussion," I
replied.</p>

<p>"Listen, Miss Vanbrugh," I continued. "If the Touareg
are upon us, as I have no doubt they are, I am going
to ride straight for the Great Oasis. Dufour, Achmet,
Djikki and Suleiman will stand the Touareg off as long as
possible. Eventually my men will be rushed and slaughtered.
If sufficiently alive, when overcome and seized, they will
be tortured unbelievably. The Touareg may or may not then
follow me, but they will have no chance of overtaking me
as I shall have a long start. I shall have the best of
the riding camels, and I shall make forced marches....
Now&mdash;I see no reason why you and Maudie should not
accompany me <i>for just as long as you can stand the
pace....</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, Major&mdash;we might conceivably hinder you and so
imperil your most precious life, endanger your safety&mdash;so
essential to France and the world in general...."</p>

<p>"I'll take good care you don't do that, Miss Vanbrugh,"
I replied. "But, as I say, there is no reason why you and
your maid should not ride off with me&mdash;though, I give you
fair warning, I shall probably ride for twenty-four hours
without stopping&mdash;and you will be most welcome. In fact,
I pray you to do so.... Trust me to see to it that you
are no hindrance nor source of danger to the success of my
mission...."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I fully trust you for <i>that,</i> Major de Beaujolais,"
she replied bitterly.</p>

<p>"Then be ready to start as soon as we get word from
Djikki that they are coming," I said. "Once again, there is
no reason why you should not come with me..."</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;but there is a very strong reason. I would
sooner die twice over.... I remain here," was the girl's
reply. "I can think of only one thing worse than falling
alive into the hands of these beasts&mdash;and that is deserting
my <i>friends,</i> Mr. Dufour, Achmet and Djikki.... Why,
I wouldn't desert even that evil-looking Suleiman after
he had served me faithfully.... I wouldn't desert a
dog...."</p>

<p>"And Maudie?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She shall do exactly as she pleases," answered the
girl.</p>

<p>Turning to Maudie, who was listening open-mouthed, she
said:</p>

<p>"Will you ride off with Major de Beaujolais, my child,
or will you stay with me? You may get to safety with this
gallant gentleman&mdash;if you can keep him in sight.... It
is death to stay here, apparently, but I will take care
that it <i>is</i> death and not torture for you, my dear."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't the Sheikhs treat us well, Miss?" asked
Maudie.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Sheikhs!</i>" snapped Miss Vanbrugh. "These are
two-legged <i>beasts,</i> my good idiot. They are human wolves,
torturing <i>devils,</i> merciless <i>brutes....</i> What is the
worst thing you've got in your country?"</p>

<p>"Burglars, Miss," replied Maudie promptly.</p>

<p>"Well, the ugliest cut-throat burglar that ever hid
under your bed or came in at your window in the middle of
the night, is just a dear little woolly lambkin, compared
with the best of these murderous savages...."</p>

<p>Maudie's face fell.</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps these was Sheikhs, Miss.... Like
in the book.... But, anyhow, I was going to do what you
do, Miss, and go where you go&mdash;of course, please, Miss."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are another of those ordinary queer
creatures that think faithfulness to friends and loyalty to
comrades come first, dear," said Miss Vanbrugh, and gave
Maudie's hand a squeeze. "But you'll do what I tell you,
Maudie, won't you?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm here for, please, Miss, thank you,"
replied the girl.</p>

<p>"Well, you're going with Major de Beaujolais," said Miss
Vanbrugh. "I hate sending you off with a gentleman of his
advanced views and superior standards&mdash;but I should hate
shooting you, even more."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss, thank you," answered Maudie, and I rose and
strolled to my tent.</p>

<p>Ours is not an easy service. Duty is a <i>very</i> jealous
God....</p>

<p class="first">
Miss Vanbrugh came and dressed my arm, and we spoke
no word to each other during the process. How I <i>hated</i>
her!... The unfair, illogical little vixen!... The
<i>woman!...</i></p>

<p>A few minutes later Suleiman uttered a shout. He could
see a rider on the horizon. I hurried towards him.</p>

<p>"It is Djikki, the black slave," he said.</p>

<p>"Djikki, the French Soudanese soldier, you dog," I
growled at him, and at any other time would have fittingly
rewarded the ugly scowl with which he regarded me.</p>

<p>"They are coming," shouted Djikki as his swift camel
drew near; and we all rushed to work like fiends at
packing-up and making preparations, for flight and fight
respectively.</p>

<p>"They are more than ten hands of five fingers now," said
Djikki, as he dismounted.... "More than a battalion
of soldiers in numbers.... They are riding along our
track.... Here in an hour."</p>

<p>"Miss Vanbrugh," said I, "I have got to go. If you
stay here I shall go on and do my work. When that is
successfully completed, I shall come back to this spot and
shoot myself.... Think of Maudie, too&mdash;if you won't
think of yourself or me. Do you want the girl to meet some
of her 'Desert Sheikhs' at last?"</p>

<p>"<i>Can</i> you leave Dufour and the Brown Brothers, Major de
Beaujolais?... I love that little Djikki-bird...."</p>

<p>"I can, Miss Vanbrugh, because I <i>must.</i> And if I, a
soldier, can do such a thing, a girl can. What could you do
by stopping to die here?"</p>

<p>"Shoot," she replied, "as fast and as straight as any of
them."</p>

<p>"My dear lady," I said, "if four rifles won't keep off
a hundred, five won't. If five can, four can.... And I
must slink off...."</p>

<p>I could have wept. We stood silent, staring at each
other.</p>

<p>"Your say goes, Major. I suppose you are right,"
answered the girl, and my heart leapt up again. "But I
<i>hate</i> myself&mdash;and I <i>loathe</i> you...."</p>

<p>All worked like slaves to get the four swiftest camels
saddled and loaded with light and indispensable things. The
fourth one, although a <i>mehara,</i> had to carry one <i>tente
d'abri</i> and bed, water, and food.</p>

<p>I could hardly trust myself to speak as I wrung Dufour's
hand, nor when I patted the shoulder of my splendid Achmet.
Djikki put my hand to his forehead and his heart, and then
knelt to kiss my feet.</p>

<p>The drop of comfort in the bitter suffering of that
moment was my knowledge that these splendid colleagues of
mine&mdash;white man, brown man, and black&mdash;knew that what I was
doing was my Duty and that what they were about to do was
theirs....</p>

<p>I bade Suleiman fight for his life; he was too new a
recruit to the Service to be expected to fight for an
ideal....</p>

<p>Miss Vanbrugh and Maudie mounted their <i>mehari</i>&mdash;Maudie
still as cheerful and plucky as ever, and, I am certain,
thrilled, and still hopeful of tender adventure.</p>

<p>I should be surprised if her novelette-turned brain
and rubbish-fed imagination did not even yet picture
the villainous desert wolves, who were so close on our
trail, as the brave band of a "lovely" Desert Sheikh in
hot pursuit of one Maudie Atkinson, of whose beauty and
desirability he had somehow heard....</p>

<p>There was a shout from Suleiman again. Something moving
on the horizon.</p>

<p>I gave the word to start, and took a last look round.</p>

<p>My men's camels were <i>barraked</i> out of danger. Each man
had a hundred rounds of ammunition, a <i>girba</i> of water, a
little heap of dates, and an impregnable position behind a
convenient rock....</p>

<p>Four against scores&mdash;perhaps hundreds.... But in
a narrow pass.... If only the Touareg would content
themselves with shooting, and lack the courage to charge.
"Say, Major," called Mary, "let those desert dead-beats
hear six rifles for a bit! They may remember an urgent
date back in their home-town, to see a man about a dog or
something.... Think we're a regular sheriff's posse of
<i>vigilantes</i> or a big, bold band of Bad Men...."</p>

<p>Dare I? It would take a tiny trifle of the load of
misery from my shoulders....</p>

<p>I would!</p>

<p>We brought our camels to their knees again, and
re-joined the garrison of the pass, the men of this little
African Thermopyl&aelig;....</p>

<p>Miss Vanbrugh chose her rock, rested her rifle on it,
sighted, raised the slide of her back-sight a little&mdash;all
in a most business-like manner.</p>

<p>Maudie crouched at my feet, behind my rock, and I showed
her how to work the bolt of my rifle, after each shot. I
was one-handed, and Maudie had, of course, never handled a
rifle in her life.</p>

<p>I waited until we could distinguish human and animal
forms in the approaching cloud of dust, and then gave
the range at 2,000 metres. "<i>Fixe!</i>" I cried coolly
thereafter, for the benefit of my native soldiers. "<i>Feux
de salve....</i> <i>En Joue!... Feu!</i>"</p>

<p>It was an admirable volley, even Suleiman firing exactly
on my word, "<i>Feu,</i>"although he knew no word of French.</p>

<p>Three times I repeated the volley, and then gave the
order for a rapid <i>feu de joie</i> as it were, at 1,500
metres, so that the advancing Touareg should hear at least
six rifles, and suppose that there were probably many
more.</p>

<p>I then ordered my men, in succession, to fire two shots
as quickly as possible, each firing as soon as the man on
his left had got his two shots off. This should create
doubt and anxiety as to our numbers.</p>

<p>I then ordered rapid independent fire.</p>

<p>The Touareg had deployed wildly, dismounted, and opened
fire. This rejoiced me, for I had conceived the quite
unlikely possibility of their charging in one headlong
overwhelming wave....</p>

<p>It was time to go.</p>

<p>"Run to your camel, Maudie. Come on, Miss Vanbrugh," I
shouted; and called to Dufour, "God watch over you, my dear
friend."</p>

<p>I had to go to the American girl and drag her from
the rock behind which she stood, firing steadily and
methodically, changing her sights occasionally, a
handful of empty cartridge-cases on the ground to her
right, a handful of cartridges ready to her hand on the
rock....</p>

<p>I shall never forget that picture of Mary
Vanbrugh&mdash;dressed as an Arab girl and fighting like a
trained soldier....</p>

<p>"<i>I'm not coming!</i>" she cried.</p>

<p>I shook her as hard as I could and then literally
dragged her to her camel.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my children," I cried as I abandoned them.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
"We rode for the rest of that day, and I thanked God
when I could no longer hear the sounds of rifle-fire, glad
though I was that they had only died away as distance
weakened them, and not with the suddenness that would have
meant a charge, massacre and pursuit.</p>

<p>I was a bitter, miserable and savage man when at last I
was compelled to draw rein, and Miss Vanbrugh bore my evil
temper with a gentle womanly sweetness of which I had not
thought her capable.</p>

<p>She dressed my arm again (and I almost hoped that
it might never heal while she was near) and absolutely
insisted that she and Maudie should share watches with me.
When I refused this, she said:</p>

<p>"Very well, Major, then instead of one watching while
two sleep, we'll both watch, and Maudie shall chaperone
us&mdash;and that's the sort of thing Euclid calls <i>reductio ad
absurdum,</i> or plumb-silly." And nothing would shake her,
although I could have done so willingly.</p>

<p>What with the wound in my arm and the wound in my soul,
I was near the end of my tether....</p>

<p>We took a two-hour watch in turn, poor Maudie nursing a
rifle of which she was mortally afraid.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c111" id="c111"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE CROSS OF DUTY</h3>

<p class="first">
We rode hard all the next day, and the two girls, thanks
to the hard training of the previous weeks, stood the
strain well.</p>

<p>It was for the sake of the camels and not for that of
the two brave women that I at length drew rein and halted
for a four-hour rest at a water-hole.</p>

<p>As I strode up and down, in misery and grief at the
thoughts that filled my mind&mdash;thoughts of those splendid
men whom I had left to die, Mary Vanbrugh came from the
little <i>tente d'abri</i> which I had insisted that she and
Maudie should use.</p>

<p>"Go and lie down," she said. "You'll get fever and make
that arm worse.... You must rest <i>sometimes,</i> if you are
to carry on at all."</p>

<p>"I can't," I said. "They were like brothers to me and I
<i>loved</i> each one of them."</p>

<p>"Talk then, if you can't rest," replied the wise woman.
"Tell me about them...."</p>

<p>"Go and lie down yourself," I said.</p>

<p>"It's Maudie's turn for the bed," she answered. "Tell me
about them.... Sit down here...."</p>

<p>I told her about Dufour and his faithful service of
nearly twenty years; of how he had offered his life for
mine, and had saved it, more than once.</p>

<p>"And Djikki?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He, too," I replied. "He is a Senegalese soldier, and I
took him for my orderly because of his great strength and
endurance, his courage, fidelity and patience.... He
was with me when I was doing some risky work down Dahomey
way.... There was a certain king who was giving trouble
and threatening worse trouble&mdash;and it was believed that he
was actually getting Krupp guns from a German trading-post
on the coast....</p>

<p>"We were ambushed in that unspeakable jungle, and only
Djikki and I survived the fight.... We were driven along
for days, thrashed with sticks, prodded with spears, tied
to trees at night, and bound so tightly that our limbs
swelled and turned blue.</p>

<p>"We were given entrails to eat and carefully defiled
water to drink.... And one morning, as they untied
us, that we might stagger on&mdash;towards the king's
capital&mdash;Djikki snatched a <i>machete,</i> a kind of heavy
hiltless sword, from a man's hand, and put up such a noble
fight as has rarely been fought by one man against a crowd.
In spite of what we had been through, he fought like a
fiend incarnate.... It was Homeric.... It was like a
gorilla fighting baboons, a tiger fighting dogs.</p>

<p>That heavy razor-edged blade rose and fell like
lightning, and every time it descended, a head or an arm
was almost severed from a body&mdash;and he whirled and sprang
and slashed and struck until the whole gang of them gave
ground, and as he bellowed and charged and then smote their
leader's head clean from his shoulders, they broke and
ran.... And Djikki&mdash;dripping blood, a mass of gashes and
gaping wounds&mdash;ran too.... With me in his arms....</p>

<p>"And when he could run no longer, he laid me down and
cut the hide thongs that bound my wrists and elbows behind
me, and those that cut into the flesh of my knees and
ankles. Then he fainted from loss of blood....</p>

<p>"I collapsed next day with fever, dysentery,
and blood-poisoning, and Djikki&mdash;that black
ex-cannibal&mdash;carried me in his arms, like a mother her
baby, day after day, for five weeks, and got food for the
two of us as well....</p>

<p>"During that time I tasted the warm blood of monkeys
and the cold flesh of lizards.... And when, at last, we
were found, by pure good luck, near a French post on the
Great River, he had not, as I discovered later, eaten for
three days (although I had) and he had not slept for four
nights.... But he had not left me and saved himself, as
he could so easily have done....</p>

<p>"Instead of doing thirty miles a day and eating all he
got, he did ten miles a day with me in his arms, and gave
me the food&mdash;pretending he had eaten.... The doctor
at the Fort said he had never seen anyone so starved and
emaciated, and yet able to keep his feet.... No, he
never left me...."</p>

<p>"And <i>you</i> have left <i>him,</i>" said Miss Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>"I have left him," I replied....</p>

<p>"And Achmet?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The most faithful servant a man ever had," I said. "He
has nursed me through fever, dysentery, blindness, wounds,
and all sorts of illnesses, as gently and tirelessly as any
woman could have done.</p>

<p>"He is a Spahi and a brave soldier.... Once I was
getting my squadron across a deep crocodile-infested river,
swollen and swift, very difficult and dangerous work if
you have not had plenty of practice in handling a swimming
horse.... I crossed first and then returned. Finally,
I came over last, and a huge crocodile took my horse&mdash;the
noise and splashing of the crossing squadron having
subsided&mdash;and I went down with the pair of them, heavily
weighted too.... It was my Achmet who spurred his horse
back into the water, swam to the spot and dived for me,
regardless of crocodiles and the swift current.... We
were both pretty well dead by the time he managed to grab
an overhanging branch, and they dragged us out...."</p>

<p>A silence fell between us....</p>

<p>"Another time, too," I went on, "Achmet and Dufour
undoubtedly saved my life&mdash;and not only at the risk of
their own, but at the cost of horrible suffering.</p>

<p>"We were besieged in a tiny entrenched bivouac, starving
and nearly dead with thirst. All that came into that little
hell was a hail of tribesmen's bullets by day and a gentle
rain of snipers' bullets by night....</p>

<p>"Had we been of the kind that surrenders&mdash;which we were
not&mdash;we should only have exchanged the tortures of thirst
for the almost unimaginable tortures of the knives and
red-hot irons of the tribesmen and their women.... Day
by day our sufferings increased and our numbers diminished
as men died of starvation, thirst, dysentery, fever,
heat-stroke, wounds&mdash;or the merciful bullet....</p>

<p>"The day temperature was rarely much above 120&deg;
and never below it, and from the sun we had no shelter.
Generally a sirocco was blowing at fifty miles an hour, as
hot as the blast from the open door of a furnace, and the
sun was hidden in the black clouds of its dust.... Often
it was as though night fell ere noon; and men, whose ration
of water was a teacupful a day, had to breathe this dust.
Our mouths, nostrils, eyes, ears were filled with it....
And, on dark nights, those devils would place fat <i>girbas</i>
of water where, at dawn, they would be in full view of men
dying of thirst... in the hope of luring them from the
shelter of rocks and sand-trenches to certain death...
and in the certainty of adding to their tortures....
But my men were Spahis, and not one of them complained,
or grumbled, or cast off discipline to make a dash for a
<i>girba</i> and death....</p>

<p>"Dufour asked to be allowed to crawl out at night and
try to get one of those skins&mdash;in which there might still
remain a few drops of water&mdash;or possibly catch one of the
fiends placing a <i>girba</i>&mdash;and I would not allow it....
I would not weigh Dufour's life against the ghost of a
chance of getting a little water&mdash;and that poisoned,
perhaps.... Nor did I feel that I had any right to go
myself, nor to send any of my few remaining men....</p>

<p>"Then Achmet volunteered to try....</p>

<p>"But I am wandering... what I started to say was
this.... Three days before we were relieved I was shot
in the head, and for those three days Dufour not only
maintained the defence of that post, garrisoned by dying
men, but <i>devoted half his own tiny ration of water to me
and my wound....</i> Achmet threatened to knife him when
Dufour tried to prevent him from contributing <i>the whole</i>
of his!...</p>

<p>"And when the relief-column arrived there was not a
man on his feet, except Dufour, though there were several
lying, still alive, gripping their rifles and facing their
foes....</p>

<p>"Dufour could give no information to the Colonel
commanding the relief-column, because he could not speak,
and when he sat down to write an answer to a question, he
collapsed, and the surgeons took him over...."</p>

<p>"You <i>accepted</i> half Dufour's and the whole of Achmet's
water-ration?" asked Miss Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>"I was unconscious from the time I was hit until the
day after the relief," I replied. "I should never have
recovered consciousness at all had not the excellent
Surgeon-Major arrived&mdash;nor should I have lived until he
did arrive, but for Achmet's bathing my head and keeping
it clean and 'cool'&mdash;in a temperature of 120&deg; and a
howling dust-storm.... I learnt all about it afterwards
from a Spahi Sergeant who was one of the survivors....
Achmet did not sleep during those three days.... Nor did
he taste water...."</p>

<p>"And I have left <i>him</i> too," I added.</p>

<p>Mary Vanbrugh was silent for a while.</p>

<p>"Major de Beaujolais," she said at length, "suppose
there had been only one camel, when you&mdash;er&mdash;departed from
the pass. Suppose the Touareg had contrived to shoot the
rest.... Would you have taken that camel and gone off
alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Leaving Maudie&mdash;and me?"</p>

<p>"Unhesitatingly," I replied.</p>

<p>She regarded me long and thoughtfully, and then,
without speaking, returned to the tent where Maudie slept,
dreaming, doubtless, of Sheikhs.</p>

<p>Of course I would have left them. Was I to be another
de Lannec and turn aside from the service of my country,
imperil the interests and welfare of my Motherland, be
false to the traditions of my great and noble Service,
stultify the arduous and painful training of a lifetime,
fail the trust reposed in me, and betray my General&mdash;<i>for a
woman?</i></p>

<p>But, oh, the thought of that woman struggling and
shrieking in the vile hands of those inhuman lustful
devils!</p>

<p>And, oh, my splendid, brave Dufour; simple, unswerving,
inflexible devotee of Duty&mdash;who loved me.... Oh, my
great-hearted faithful Djikki, who had done for me what
few white men could or would have done; Djikki, who loved
me....</p>

<p>Oh, my beloved Achmet, strong, gentle soul, soldier,
nurse, servant and friend... who loved me....</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;<i>of course</i> I would have taken the last camel,
and with only one rider, too, to give it every chance of
reaching the Great Oasis by forced marches.</p>

<p>And, <i>of course,</i> I would leave those three to die
alone, to-morrow, if they survived to-day....</p>

<p>Hard?...</p>

<p>Indeed, and indeed, ours is a hard service, a Service
for hard men, but a noble Service. And&mdash;Duty is indeed a
jealous God.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
And, one weary day, as we topped a long hill, we saw a
sight that made me rub my eyes and say, "This is fever and
madness!"</p>

<p>For, a few hundred yards from us, rode a Camel Corps&mdash;a
drilled and disciplined unit that, even as we crossed their
skyline, deployed from column to line, at a signal from
their leader, as though they had been Spahis, <i>barraked</i>
their camels, in perfect line and with perfect intervals,
and sank from sight behind them, with levelled rifles.</p>

<p>Surely none but European officers or drill-sergeants had
wrought that wonder?</p>

<p>I raised my hands above my head and rode toward their
leader, as it was equally absurd to think of flight or of
fight....</p>

<p>Caught!... Trapped!...</p>

<p>The commander was a misshapen dwarf with huge hunched
shoulders and big head.</p>

<p>"<i>Aselamu, Aleikum,</i>" I called pleasantly and coolly.
"Greeting to you."</p>

<p>"<i>Salaam aleikum wa Rahmat Allah,</i>" growled the
Bedouin gutturally, and staring fiercely from me to the
<i>bourkah-</i>covered women. "Greeting to you, and the peace of
Allah."</p>

<p>"<i>Keif halak?</i>" I went on. "How do you do?" and wondered
if this were the end.... Would Mary shoot herself in
time?... Did my mission end here?...</p>

<p>No&mdash;discipline like this did not go hand-in-hand with
foul savagery. There was a hope....</p>

<p>"<i>Taiyib,</i>" replied the dwarf. "Well"&mdash;and proceeded to
ask if we were alone.</p>

<p>"Quite," I assured him, swiftly rejecting the idea of
saying there was an army of my friends close behind, and
asked in turn, with flowery compliments upon the drill and
discipline of his squadron, who he was.</p>

<p>"Commander of a hundred in the army of my Lord <i>the Emir
el Hamel el Kebir,</i> Leader of the Faithful, and Shadow
of the Prophet of God," was the sonorous reply; and with
a falsely cheerful ejaculation of surprise and joy, I
announced that I was the emissary of a Great Power to the
Court of the Emir....</p>

<p class="first">
We rode on, prisoner-guests of this fierce, rough, but
fairly courteous Arab, in a hollow-square of riflemen
whose equipment, bearing and discipline I could not but
admire....</p>

<p>And what if this Emir had an army of such&mdash;and chose to
preach a <i>jehad,</i> a Holy War for the establishment of a
Pan-Islamic Empire and the overthrow of the power of the
Infidel in Africa?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c112" id="c112"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE EMIR AND THE VIZIER</h3>

<p class="verse">
"And all around, God's mantle of illimitable space..."</p>

<p class="quote">A. Farquhar.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
In a few hours we reached the Great Oasis, an astounding
forest of palm-trees, roughly square in shape, with a
ten-mile side.</p>

<p>My first glimpse of the Bedouin inhabitants of this area
showed me that here was a people as different in spirit
from those of Zaguig as it was possible to be.</p>

<p>There was nothing here of the furtively evil, lowering
suspicious fanaticism that makes "holy" places so utterly
damnable.</p>

<p>Practically no notice was taken of our passage through
the tent-villages and the more permanent little <i>qsars</i> of
sand-brick and baked mud. The clean orderliness, prevalent
everywhere, made me rub my eyes and stare again.</p>

<p>At the "capital" we were, after a long and anxious
waiting, handed over to a person of some importance, a
<i>hadji</i> by his green turban, and, after a brief explanation
of us by our captor&mdash;addressed as Marbruk ben Hassan by the
<i>hadji</i>&mdash;we were conducted to the Guest-tents.</p>

<p>To my enormous relief, the girls were to be beneath
the same roof as myself, and to occupy the <i>anderun</i> or
<i>hareem</i> part of a great tent, which was divided from
the rest by a heavy partition of felt. Presumably it was
supposed that they were my wives.</p>

<p>This Guest-tent stood apart from the big village and
near to a group of the largest and finest tents I ever saw
in use by Arabs. They were not of the low black Bedouin
type, spreading and squat, but rather of the pavilion type,
such as the great Kaids of Morocco, or the Sultan himself,
uses.</p>

<p>Not very far away was a neat row of the usual kind of
low goatskin tent, which was evidently the "lines" of the
soldiers of the bodyguard.</p>

<p>Flags, flying from spears stuck in the ground, showed
that the pavilions were those of the Emir&mdash;and a Soudanese
soldier who came on sentry-go near the Guest-tent, that we
were his prisoners.</p>

<p>The <i>hadji</i> (a man whom I was to know later as the
Hadji Abdul Salam, a <i>marabout</i> or <i>mullah</i> and a <i>hakim</i>
or doctor), returned from announcing our arrival to the
Emir.</p>

<p>"Our Lord the Emir el Hamel el Kebir offers you the
three days' hospitality, due by Koranic Law&mdash;and by the
generosity of his heart&mdash;to all travellers. He will see
you when you have rested. All that he has is yours," said
he.</p>

<p>"Including the edge of his sword," I said to myself.</p>

<p>But this was really excellent. I thought of poor Rohlfs
and contrasted my reception at the Great Oasis with his
at Kufara, near where he was foully betrayed and evilly
treated.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, two black slave-women bore pots of
steaming water to the <i>anderun,</i> and a boy brought me my
share, less picturesquely, in kerosene-oil tins.</p>

<p>"Can I come in, Major?" called Miss Vanbrugh. "I've
knocked at the felt door.... More felt than heard....
I want to dress your arm."</p>

<p>I told her that I was feeling happier about her than
I had done since we started, for I was beginning to hope
and to believe that we were in the hands of an enlightened
and merciful despot, instead of those of the truculent and
destructive savage I had expected to find.</p>

<p>"How do you like this hotel?" I inquired as she pinned
the bandage.</p>

<p>"Nothing like it in N'York," she replied. "Maudie's
sitting on cushions and feeling she's half a Sheikhess
already...."</p>

<p>"I'm going to put on my uniform," I announced. "Will you
and she help a one-armed cripple?"</p>

<p>They did. And when the Hadji Abdul Salam, and a dear old
gentleman named Dawad Fetata, came with one or two more
<i>ekhwan</i> to conduct me to the presence of the Emir, I was a
French Field-Officer again, bathed, shaven, and not looking
wholly unworthy of the part I had to play.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
Seated on dyed camel-hair rugs piled on a carpet, were
the Emir el Hamel el Kebir and his Vizier, the Sheikh el
Habibka, stately men in fine raiment.</p>

<p>I saw at a glance that the Emir, whatever he might
claim to be, was no member of the family of Es Sayed
Yussuf Haroun es Sayed es Mahdi es Senussi, and that if he
pretended to be the expected "Messiah," Sidi Sayed el Mahdi
el Senussi, he was an impostor.</p>

<p>For he was most unmistakably of Touareg stock, and from
nowhere else could he have got the grey eyes of Vandal
origin, which are fairly common among the Touareg, many of
whom are blue-eyed and ruddy-haired.</p>

<p>I liked his face immediately. This black-bearded,
black-browed, hawk-faced Arab was a man of character,
force and power. But I wished I could see the mouth hidden
beneath the mass of moustache and beard. Dignified, calm,
courteous, strong, this was no ruffianly and swashbuckling
fanatic.</p>

<p>My hopes rose high.</p>

<p>The Vizier, whose favour might be most important, I took
to be of Touareg or Berber-Bedouin stock, he too being
somewhat fair for a desert-Arab. He was obviously a distaff
blood-relation of the Emir.</p>

<p>These two men removed the mouth-pieces of their
long-stemmed <i>narghilehs</i> from their lips and stared <i>and</i>
stared a<i>nd</i> stared at me, in petrified astonishment&mdash;to
which they were too stoical or too well-bred to give other
expression.</p>

<p>I suppose the last person they expected to see was
a French officer in uniform, and they sat in stupefied
silence.</p>

<p>Had not the idea been too absurd, I could almost have
thought that I saw a look of fear in their eyes. Perhaps
they thought for a moment that I was the herald of a French
army that was even then getting into position round the
oasis!</p>

<p>Fear is the father of cruelty, so I hoped that my
fleeting impression was a false one. I would have disabused
their minds by plunging straight <i>in medias res,</i> and
announcing my business forthwith, but that this is not the
way to handle Arabs.</p>

<p>Only by devious paths can the goal be reached, and much
meaningless <i>faddhling</i> (gossip) must precede the real
matter on which the mind is fixed.</p>

<p>I greeted the Emir with the correct honorifics and in
the Arabic of the educated.</p>

<p>He replied in an accent with which I was not familiar,
that of the classical Arabic of the <i>Hejaz,</i> I supposed,
called "the Tongue of the Angels" by the Arabs.</p>

<p>Having exchanged compliments and inquired after each
other's health, with repeated "<i>Kief halaks?</i>" and
"<i>Taiyibs,</i>" I told the Emir of the attack upon us by the
Touareg at the Salt Lake, and of my fears as to the fate of
my followers.</p>

<p>"The Sons of Shaitan and the Forgotten of God! May they
burn in Eblis eternally! Do they dare come within seven
days of <i>me</i>!" growled the Emir, and clapped his hands. A
black youth came running.</p>

<p>"Send me Marbruk ben Hassan, the Commander of a
Hundred," said the Emir, and when the deformed but powerful
cripple came, and humbly saluted his Lord, the latter gave
a prompt order.</p>

<p>"A hundred men. Ten days' rations. Ride to the Pass of
the Salt Lake. A band of the Forgotten of God were there
three days ago. Start within the hour..." He then
whispered with him apart for a moment, and the man was
gone.</p>

<p>The Vizier had not ceased to stare unwaveringly at me,
but he uttered no word.</p>

<p>The Emir and I maintained a desultory and pointless
conversation which concluded with an invitation to feast
with him that night.</p>

<p>"I hear that you are accompanied by two Nazrani ladies.
I am informed that wives of <i>Roumis</i> eat with their Lords
and in the presence of other men. I shall be honoured
if the Sitts&mdash;your wives doubtless?&mdash;will grace my poor
tent...."</p>

<p>One thing I liked about the Emir was the gentlemanly way
in which he had forborne to question me on the subject of
the astounding presence of two white women. I accordingly
told him the plain truth at once, thinking it wisest and
safest.</p>

<p>"You will receive no such treatment here as they of
Zaguig meted unto you," said the Emir, when I had finished
my story. "They who come in peace may remain in peace.
They who come in war remain in peace also&mdash;the peace of
Death.</p>

<p>" His voice was steely if not menacing. "Do you come
in peace or in war, <i>Roumi?</i>" he then asked, and as I
replied,</p>

<p>"On my head and my life, I come in peace, bearing a
great and peaceful message," I fancied that both he and
the Vizier looked relieved&mdash;and I again wondered if they
imagined the presence or approach of a French army.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
Whatever I may forget, I shall remember that night's
<i>diffa</i> of <i>cous-cous;</i> a lamb stuffed with almonds and
raisins, and roasted whole; <i>bamia,</i> a favourite vegetable
of the Arabs; stewed chicken; a <i>pillau</i> of rice, nuts,
raisins and chopped meat; <i>kaibabs</i> of kid; camel-milk
curds; a paste-like macaroni cooked in butter, and heavy
shortbread fried in oil and eaten with sugar. Between
the courses, we drank bowls of lemon-juice to aid our
appetites, and they needed aid as the hours wore on.</p>

<p>When we were full to bursting, distended, comatose, came
the ceremonial drinking of mint tea. After that, coffee.
Finally we were offered very large cakes of very hard plain
sugar.</p>

<p>Only five were present, the Emir, the Vizier, Mary,
Maudie, and myself. We sat cross-legged on a carpet round
a red cotton cloth upon which was a vast brass tray, laden
with blue bowls filled to overflowing, and we ate with our
fingers.</p>

<p>As I entered with Miss Vanbrugh and Maudie, and they
dropped their <i>barracans,</i> thus exposing the two Paris
frocks which the latter had put in the portmanteau at
Zaguig, the effect upon the two Arabs was electrical. They
were as men dreaming dreams and seeing visions.</p>

<p>I thought the Emir was going to collapse as he looked at
Mary; and I watched the Vizier devouring her with hungry
eyes. I grew a little nervous.</p>

<p>"The Lady Sitt Miriyam Hankinson el Vanbrugh," said I,
to make an imposing and sonorous mouthful of title, "and
the Sitt Moad el Atkinson."</p>

<p>I suppose they were the first white women the Arabs had
seen, and they were struck dumb and senseless by their
beauty.</p>

<p>Nor was the effect of their hosts much less upon the
girls. Miss Vanbrugh stared, fascinated, at the gorgeous
figure of the Emir, while poor Maudie did not know whether
she was on her head or her heels.</p>

<p>"<i>Sheikhs!</i>" she murmured. "<i>Real</i> Sheikhs! Oh, sir,
<i>isn't</i> the big one a lovely man!..." The Emir, dragging
his eyes from Mary, smiled graciously at the other fair
woman, and murmured:</p>

<p>"<i>Bismillah! Sitt Moad. Oua Aleikoume Esselema,
'lhamdoula!</i>" and to me in his classic Arabic, "Sweet
as the dates of Buseima is her presence," which I duly,
translated.</p>

<p>And then Mary found her voice.</p>

<p>"Well! Well! Major," she observed. "Aren't they
sure-enough genuine Parlour Sheikhs of song and story!" and
before I could stop her, she offered her hand to the Emir,
her eyes dancing with delight.</p>

<p>Probably neither the Emir nor the Vizier had ever
"shaken hands" before, but Mary's smile, gesture
and "<i>Very</i> pleased to meet you, Sheikh," were
self-explanatory, and both the Arabs made a good showing
at this new ceremonial of the strange <i>Roumis</i> and their
somewhat brazen, unveiled females.</p>

<p>Indeed the Vizier seemed to know more about holding
Mary's hand than releasing it, and again I grew nervous.</p>

<p>When the Emir said to me, "Let the other Lady, the Sitt
Moadi, lay her hand upon my hands also," and I translated,
I thought Maudie would have swooned with pleasure and
confusion. Not only did the Emir "shake hands"&mdash;he stroked
hands, and I grew less and less happy.</p>

<p>An amorous Arab is something very amorous indeed. With
these desert despots, to desire is to take, and if I were
an obstacle it would be very easy to remove me. And what
of the girls <i>then?...</i> As the meal progressed and the
sense of strangeness and shyness wore off, I was glad that
the Sheikh and his Vizier could not possibly know a word of
English, for Miss Vanbrugh's criticisms were pungent and
Maudie's admiration fulsome.</p>

<p>I was kept busy translating the Emir's remarks to the
girls, and mistranslating the girls' remarks concerning
the appearance, manners, and probable customs of their
hosts.</p>

<p>At times I was in a cold perspiration of fear, as I
thought of how utterly these two women were in the power
of these men, and again at times, watching their faces, I
saw no evil in them. Hard they were, perhaps relentless and
ruthless, but not cruel, sensual nor debauched.</p>

<p>"Major," Miss Vanbrugh remarked, "d'you think these
Parlour Sheikhs would like to hear a little song?...
Tell them it's grace after meat," and before I could offer
my views on the propriety of thus entertaining our hosts,
or translating her remark, I once more heard the familiar
air, but this time to the words:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"The Sons of the Prophet are hardy and bold,<br>
And quite unaccustomed to fear;<br>
But of all&mdash;the most reckless of life and of limb,<br>
Was Abdul the Bul-bul Emir!...</p>

<p class="verse">
"When they wanted a man to encourage the van.<br>
Or to shout 'Attaboy!' in the rear,<br>
Or to storm a redoubt,<br>
They always sent out<br>
For Abdul the Bul-bul Emir!<br><br>
For Abdul the Bul-bul Emir!"</p>"

<br>

<p class="first">
The Arabs stared, almost open-mouthed, and I explained
that after-dinner singing was a custom with the <i>Roumis</i>
and that the song, out of compliment to our hosts,
described the greatness, wisdom, virtue, and courage of
another famous Emir.</p>

<p>When we were at last permitted to cease from eating, and
white-clad servants removed the remains of the <i>diffa,</i> the
Emir bade me request Mary Vanbrugh to talk of her country
and her home, that I might translate her words to him.</p>

<p>He then asked many questions through me.</p>

<p>Thereafter he directed that Maudie should talk.</p>

<p>But having almost realized the ambition of her life,
Maudie was shy and could only stammer incoherently while
gazing bright-eyed, flushed, with parted lips and quickened
breathing, at the huge, handsome, and gorgeously arrayed
Emir.</p>

<p>The Vizier, the Sheikh el Habibka, scarcely uttered a
word the whole evening, but he hardly took his eyes from
Miss Vanbrugh's face.</p>

<p>In the bad moments to which I have alluded, I felt that
if the worst came to the worst, Maudie would be imprisoned
in the Emir's <i>hareem,</i> and Mary in that of this Sheikh el
Habibka&mdash;unless the Emir took them both....</p>

<p>The sooner I could dangle before their eyes the million
francs and the enormous advantages of an <i>entente</i> and an
alliance with France, the better it would be; and the less
they saw of the girls the better it would be also....</p>

<p>"Well, Major, it's time you went to bed," said Mary.
"Remember you're a sick man!"</p>

<p>"We can't move till the Emir gives the hint," I
replied.</p>

<p>"Well, I wish he'd do it, the great old coot. Tell him
what I'm saying, Major&mdash;that he fancies he's some punkins,
but he's not the perfect little gentleman he thinks he
is, or he'd see I'm tired to death," and she yawned
heavily....</p>

<p>Luckily the Emir shortly afterwards suggested that we
might be weary, and though I told him that no one could
be weary in his presence, he hinted that <i>he</i> was so in
mine.</p>

<p>The leave-taking made it clear that Maudie's hand
delighted the Emir, while that of Mary was precious in
the sight of the Sheikh el Habibka. There was a look of
determination in that man's eye....</p>

<p>As we entered the Guest-tent I said to Miss Vanbrugh,
"Scream if there's any trouble in the night."</p>

<p>"Scream? I shall <i>shoot.</i> Let the 'trouble' do the
screaming. Good night, Major," was this independent and
courageous young lady's reply.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
The next day I had an interview with the Emir, in the
presence, as always, of the Vizier, and, after infinite
meanderings around all subjects but the real one, we came
to it at last.</p>

<p>I made it clear that what I offered him was the
friendship of a most powerful protector, great wealth,
and all the advantages that would ensue if a caravan-road
were made and guarded from the Great Oasis to Zaguig,
and trade-relations opened up between his people and the
North.</p>

<p>I glanced at the possibility of our supplying him
with arms, including machine-guns and, possibly, light
artillery&mdash;later on.</p>

<p>I grew eloquent in showing him how the friendship of
France could raise him to a safe independence, and how,
in the r&ocirc;le of prot&eacute;g&eacute; of France, he
could benefit his people and give them the blessings of
civilization.</p>

<p>The Emir repeated my phrase, but with a peculiar
intonation.</p>

<p>"The blessings of civilization!" he mused. "Drink....
Disease.... Unrest.... Machine-guns.... Has the
civilization of the <i>Roumis</i> always proved such a blessing
to the darker races who have come in contact with it?"</p>

<p>The two stroked their beards, and eyed me long and
thoughtfully. I assured the Emir that it would be in his
power to pick and choose. Isolated as his people were,
there need be no "contact." All France wanted was his
friendship.</p>

<p>Provided he were loyal and kept the terms of the treaty
exactly, he could use the subsidy as he pleased, and could
discriminate between the curses and the real blessings of
western civilization.</p>

<p>Surely he could see to it that only good ensued? Nothing
was farther from the thoughts of the French Government
than interference&mdash;much less conquest, or even "peaceful
penetration." All we asked was that the Confederation which
he ruled should be a source of strength and not of weakness
to us&mdash;that the Great Oasis should be an outpost of France
in the hands of the Emir el Hamel el Kebir.... And I
hinted at his own danger from others who would not come
to him thus, with offers of gold and protection, but with
armies....</p>

<p>"We will talk of these matters again," said the Emir at
length. "<i>Khallas!</i> It is finished...."</p>

<p>That evening, a riding-party was arranged, and, mounted
on beautiful horses, the Sheikh el Habibka and Miss
Vanbrugh rode together; the Emir, on a white camel, rode
with Maudie&mdash;who, very wisely, would not get on a horse;
and I rode with a party of fine courteous Arabs who were
minor sheikhs, officers of the soldiery, councillors,
friends and hangers-on of the Emir and the Vizier.</p>

<p>We rode through the oasis out into the desert.</p>

<p>I did not enjoy my ride, for, before very long, I lost
sight of the two girls, and could only hope for the best
while fearing the worst.... Women are so attracted by
externals and so easily deceived by a courteous and gallant
manner.</p>

<p>One comfort was that neither girl could speak a word
of Arabic, so there was nothing to fear from plausible
tongues.</p>

<p>Any love-making would have to be done in dumb-show,
and I was beginning to feel that there was no likelihood
of <i>force majeure</i>&mdash;both men giving me the impression of
innate gentlemanliness and decency.</p>

<p>Still&mdash;Arabs are Arabs and this was the Sahara&mdash;and, as
I noted that the Emir returned with Miss Vanbrugh and the
Vizier with Maud, I wanted nothing so much as to get safely
away with my women-folk and a signed treaty of alliance.</p>

<p class="first">
But this was just what I could not do.</p>

<p>Time after time, I sought audience with the Emir, only
to find that he was engaged or sleeping or busy or absent
from the Oasis.</p>

<p>Time after time, when his guest at meat, riding, or
<i>faddhling</i> with him on the rug-strewn carpet before the
pavilions, I tried to get him to discuss the object of my
visit&mdash;but in vain.</p>

<p>Always it was, "We will talk of it to-morrow,
<i>Inshallah.</i>"</p>

<p>His eternal "<i>Bokra! Bokra!</i>" was as bad as the
<i>ma&ntilde;ana</i> of the Spaniards. And "to-morrow" never
came....</p>

<p>The return of Marbruk ben Hassan and his camel-squadron
brought me news that depressed me to the depths and
darkened my life for days. I was given understanding of the
expression "a broken heart."...</p>

<p>Evidently my heroes had fought to their last cartridge
and had then been overwhelmed. Beneath a great cairn of
stones, Marbruk and his men had buried the tortured,
defiled, mangled remains of Dufour, Achmet and Djikki.</p>

<p>It was plain to me that Suleiman had deserted, for the
parts of only three corpses were found, and the track of a
single camel fleeing south-eastward from the spot.</p>

<p>That he had not fought to the last, and then escaped
or been captured alive by the Touareg, was shown by the
fact that, where he had lain, there were but few empty
cartridge-cases, compared with the number lying where my
men had died; and by the fact of the track of the fleeing
camel.</p>

<p>I retired to my tent, saying I wished to see no one for
a day, and that I wanted no food.</p>

<p>It was a black and dreadful day for me, the man for whom
those humble heroes had fought and died; and, for hours, I
was hard put to it to contain myself.</p>

<p>I did see some one however&mdash;for Miss Vanbrugh entered
silently, dressed my rapidly healing wound, and then
stroked my hair and brow and cheek so kindly, so gently,
and with such deep understanding sympathy that I broke
down.</p>

<p>I could almost have taken her in my arms, but that
I would not trade on my misery and her sympathy&mdash;and
without a word spoken between us she went back to the
<i>anderun...</i> the blessed, beautiful, glorious woman.</p>

<p><i>Did she understand at last?... Duty.... My duty
to my General, my Service, and my Country.</i></p>

<p class="first">
That evening she was visited by the future Sheikh of
the tribe that had first accepted the Emir, a charming and
delightful little boy, dressed exactly like a grown man.</p>

<p>With him came his sister, a most lovely girl, the Sitt
Leila Nakhla.</p>

<p>Her, the two girls found haughty, distant, disapproving,
and I gathered that the visit was not a success&mdash;apart from
the question of the language difficulty.</p>

<p>Bedouin women do not go veiled in their own villages and
camps, and I saw this Arab "princess" at a feast given by
her guardian, the white-bearded, delightful old gentleman,
Sidi Dawad Fetata.</p>

<p>It was soon very clear to me that the Sitt Leila Nakhla
worshipped the Emir; that the grandson of old Sidi Dawad
Fetata worshipped the Sitt Leila Nakhla; and that the
latter detested our Maudie, from whose face the Emir's eye
roved but seldom.</p>

<p>The little London sparrow was the hated rival of a
princess, for the hand of a powerful ruler! Oh, Songs of
Araby and Tales of fair Kashmir! What a world it is!</p>

<p>But what troubled me more than hate was love&mdash;the love
that I could see dawning in the eyes of the Sheikh el
Habibka as he sat beside Miss Vanbrugh and plied her with
tit-bits from the bowls.</p>

<p>I watched him like a lynx, and he me. How he <i>hated</i>
me!...</p>

<p>Time after time I saw him open his lips to speak,
sigh heavily, and say nothing. But if he said nothing he
did a good deal&mdash;including frequent repetitions of the
<i>Roumi</i> "shake-hands" custom, which he misinterpreted as a
hold-hands habit.</p>

<p>He had learnt the words, and would say, "<i>Shakand,
Mees,</i>" from time to time, in what he thought was
English.</p>

<p>And Mary? She was infinitely amused. Amused beyond all
cause that I could see; and I was really angry when she
glanced from me to the Sheikh el Habibka&mdash;he holding her
hand warmly clasped in both of his&mdash;and quietly hummed, in
a conversational sort of voice:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Said the Bul-bul, 'Young man, is your life then so dull<br>
That you're anxious to end your career?<br>
For Infidel, know&mdash;that you've trod on the toe<br>
Of Abdul, the Bul-bul Emir!'</p>

<p class="verse">
"The Bul-bul then drew out his trusty chibouque,<br>
And shouting out 'Allah Akbar!'<br>
Being also intent on slaughter, he went<br>
For Ivan Petruski Skivah!"...</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
This interested the Sitt Leila Nakhla not at all. She
watched Maudie, while young Yussuf Latif Fetata watched
Leila. To me this girl was most charming, but became a
little troublesome in her demands that I should translate
every remark that Maudie made. I believe the Sitt's
position in the Tribe was unique, owing to her relationship
to the future Sheikh, and the kind indulgence of the Emir,
who treated her as a child.</p>

<p>The chief result of this feast was to increase my
anxiety and to add to my determination to bring my business
to an issue and depart.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c113" id="c113"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>"CHOOSE"</h3>

<p class="first">
But now, alas! the attitude of the Emir, and of his
all-important and powerful Vizier toward me began to
change. They grew less friendly and my position less that
of guest than prisoner-guest, if not prisoner.</p>

<p>The most foolish proverb of the most foolish nation
in the world is, "When you get near women you get near
trouble," but in this instance it seemed to apply.</p>

<p>Mary and Maudie were the trouble; for the Emir was
undoubtedly falling in love with Maudie, and the Vizier
with Mary.</p>

<p>I wondered what would have happened if they had both
fallen in love with the same girl. I suppose one of them
would have died suddenly, in spite of the fact that
they appeared to be more like brothers than master and
servant.</p>

<p>And there was no hope in me for Maudie. Maudie blossomed
and Maudie bloomed. If ever I saw a wildly-quietly,
composedly-distractedly, madly-sanely happy woman, it was
our Maudie.</p>

<p>She grew almost lovely. How many of us have an
incredibly impossible beautiful dream&mdash;and find it come
impossibly true? Maudie had dreamed of attar-scented,
silk-clad, compelling but courtly Sheikhs, ever since she
had read some idiotic trash; and now an attar-scented,
silk-clad, compelling but courtly Sheikh <i>was</i> (in Maudie's
words) "after" Maudie!</p>

<p>And Miss Vanbrugh? She, too, seemed happy as the day was
long, albeit capricious; and though she did not apparently
encourage the Sheikh el Habibka, nor "flirt" exactly, she
undoubtedly enjoyed his society, as well as that of the
Emir, and rode alone with either of them, without fear.
They must have been silent rides&mdash;with a strange dumb
alphabet! Nor would she listen to my words of warning.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, Major de Beaujolais," she would say,
"I tell you they are <i>all right.</i> Yes, <i>both</i> of them. I
am just as safe with them as I am with you.... And I'm
<i>awfully</i> safe with you, Major, am I not?"</p>

<p>Women always know better than men&mdash;until they find they
know nothing about the matter at all.</p>

<p>The next thing that I did not like, was the giving of
feasts to which the girls alone were invited; and then
feasts at which Mary alone, or Maudie alone, was the
guest.</p>

<p>However, such invitations were commands, of course; the
feasts were held in the Emir's pavilion, which was but a
few yards from our tent; I took care that the girls had
their pistols, and I always sat ready for instant action
if I should hear a scream when either of them was there
alone.</p>

<p>Nor was there any great privacy observed, for servants
were in and out with dishes, and unless there was a strong
<i>gibli</i> blowing, the pavilion entrance was open.</p>

<p>But more and more I became a prisoner, and now when I
took my daily ride it was with Marbruk ben Hassan and an
escort&mdash;for my "protection."</p>

<p>One night, as I lay awake, the horrible thought occurred
to me of using Miss Vanbrugh and Maudie to further my
ends&mdash;and I was almost sick at the bare idea. Whence come
these devilish thoughts into clean minds?</p>

<p>No. At that I drew the line. My life for France, but
not a girl's honour.... I thrust the vile thought from
me.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards I fell asleep and had a curious
dream....</p>

<p>I was in a vast hall, greater than any built by mortal
hands. At the end to which I faced were vast black velvet
curtains. As I stood gazing at these, expectant, they
parted and rolled away, revealing a huge pair of golden
scales, in each great cup of which was seated a most
beautiful woman.</p>

<p>One, a noble and commanding figure, wore the Cap of
Liberty and I knew her to be the Genius and Goddess and
Embodiment of France.... The other, a beautiful and
beseeching figure, I saw to be Mary Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>Each of these lovely creatures gave me a smile of
ineffable sweetness and extended a welcoming hand....
A great voice cried "<i>Choose,</i>" and, as I strode forward,
the great curtains fell&mdash;and the dream became a nightmare
in which a colossal brazen god stretched a vast hand from a
brazen sky to destroy me where I stood in the midst of an
illimitable arid desert....</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
Then to me, one night, came the Emir and the Vizier,
clearly on business bent. There was no <i>faddhling.</i> As soon
as I had offered them seats upon the rugs and produced my
last Turkish cigarettes, the Emir got to business.</p>

<p>"Touching the treaty with your Excellency's great
country," he began, and my heart leapt with hope. "I will
sign it&mdash;on terms.... On terms further than those named
hitherto."</p>

<p>He stopped and appeared to be enjoying the Turkish
cigarette intensely.</p>

<p>"And they are, Commander of the Faithful and Shadow of
the Prophet?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"That you take the treaty, signed and sealed by me, and
witnessed by my Vizier and twelve ekhwan&mdash;<i>and leave the
two Sitts whom you brought here.</i>"</p>

<p class="first">
So it had come! I was faced with the decision of a
lifetime!</p>

<p>"<i>That is impossible,</i> Emir el Hamel el Kebir," I seemed
to hear myself reply, after a minute of acute agony, which
bathed me in perspiration from head to foot.</p>

<p>The Emir raised his big black eyebrows and gave me
a supercilious, penetrating hawk-stare of surprise and
anger.</p>

<p>"And why?" he inquired quietly.</p>

<p>"Because they put themselves under my protection,"
I replied, "and I have put myself and them under
yours...."</p>

<p>"And I am merely suggesting that they remain there,"
interrupted the Emir.</p>

<p>"For how long?" I sneered.</p>

<p>"That is for <i>them</i> to say," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then let them say it," I answered. "Emir, I have
treated you as a Bedouin Chief, a true Arab of the Desert,
a man of chivalry, honour, hospitality, and greatness.
Would you, in return, speak to me of trafficking in
women?..."</p>

<p><i>To Hell with their treaty and their tribes....</i>&mdash;and
then the face of my uncle, the words of his letters,
and memories of my life-work rose before my eyes....
Neither of these girls was a Frenchwoman.... I had not
asked them to come here.... I had warned them <i>against</i>
coming.... I had told them plainly that I was going on a
mission of national importance.... And de Lannec....
"<i>Exit de Lannec</i>"!...</p>

<p>I strode up and down the tent, the two Arabs, calm,
imperturbable, stroking their beards and watching
me.... I reasoned with myself, as a Frenchman should,
<i>logically.</i></p>

<p>Glorious logic&mdash;the foe of sloppiness, emotionalism,
sentimentality.</p>

<p>I can but hope, looking back upon this crucial moment
of my life, that such matters as my utter ruin and
disgrace; my loss of all that made life good; my fall from
a place of honour, dignity, and opportunity, to the very
gutters of life; my renunciation of ambition, reward and
success&mdash;weighed with me not at all, and were but as dust
in the balance....</p>

<p>I can but hope that, coolly and without bias, I answered
the question as to whether the interests of France, the
lives of thousands of men, the loss of incalculable
treasure should, or should not, out-weigh the interests of
two foreign women.</p>

<p>Should thousands of French soldiers suffer wounds and
death&mdash;or should these two girls enter the <i>hareems</i> of
Arab Sheikhs?...</p>

<p>Should I fulfil the trust reposed in me or betray it?</p>

<p>"<i>I want tools that will not turn in my hand....
Tools on which I can absolutely rely,</i>" my uncle&mdash;my
General, the representative of my Country&mdash;had said to
me; and I had willingly offered myself as a tool that
would <i>not</i> turn in his hand... that would <i>not</i> fail
him....</p>

<p>And if "it is expedient that one man shall die for the
people," was it not expedient that two foreign women should
be sacrificed to prevent a war, to save an Empire?...
Two lives instead of two thousand, twenty thousand, two
hundred thousand....</p>

<p>If, as my uncle said, there would always be danger in
Morocco to the French African Empire, and if, whenever that
danger arose, this great Tribal Confederation became a
source of even greater danger... ?</p>

<p>"And for what was I <i>here?</i> For what had I been
fashioned and made, taught and trained, hammered on
the hard anvil of experience?... Why was I <i>in</i> my
Service&mdash;<i>but to do the very thing that it now lay to my
hand to do?</i>"</p>

<p>As an honest and honourable man, I must put the orders
of my General, the honour and tradition of my Service,
and, above all, the welfare of my Country, before
everything&mdash;and <i>everybody.</i></p>

<p>Logic showed me the truth&mdash;and, suddenly, I stopped in
my stride, turned and shook my fist in the Emir's very face
and shouted: "<i>Damn your black face and blacker</i> s<i>oul, you
filthy hound! Get out of my tent before I throw you out,
you bestial swine!...</i> WHITE WOMEN! <i>You black dogs and
sons of dogs... !</i>" and, shaking with rage, I pointed to
the doorway of my tent.</p>

<p class="first">
They rose and went&mdash;and, with them, went all my hopes
of success. What had I done? What <i>had</i> I done?... But
Mary&mdash;sweet, lovely, brave, fascinating Mary... <i>and
that black-bearded dog!</i></p>

<p>Let France sink beneath the sea first....</p>

<p>But what <i>had</i> I done?... What had I <i>done?...</i>
What is 'Right' and what is 'Wrong'? What voice had I
obeyed?</p>

<p>Anyhow, I was unfit, utterly unfit, for my great
Service&mdash;and I would break my sword and burn my uniform, go
back to my uncle, confess what I had done and enlist in the
Foreign Legion....</p>

<p>Oh, <i>splendid de Lannec!...</i> <i>He was right, of
course...</i> .</p>

<p>But this was ruin and the end of Henri de Beaujolais.</p>

<p>Then a voice through the felt wall that cut off my part
of the tent from the <i>anderun</i> said,</p>

<p>"Your language certainly sounded bad, Major! I am glad I
don't understand Arabic!"</p>

<p>I was not very sure that <i>I</i> was glad she did not.</p>

<p>And as little as she understood Arabic did I understand
whether I had done right or wrong.</p>

<p>But one thing I understood. I was a Failure.... I had
failed my General, my Service, and my Country&mdash;but yet I
somehow felt I had not failed my higher Self....</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
It was the next morning that Miss Vanbrugh greeted me
with the words:</p>

<p>"Major, you haven't congratulated me yet. I had an
honest-to-God offer of marriage from a leading citizen
of this burg yesterday.... I'm blushing still....
Inwardly...."</p>

<p>I was horrified.... What next?</p>

<p>"From whom?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The Sheikh el Habibka el Wazir."</p>

<p>"Good God!" I groaned. "Miss Vanbrugh, we shall have to
walk very very delicately...."</p>

<p>"So'll the Sheikh-lad," observed Mary grimly.</p>

<p>"But how did he make the proposal?" I inquired, knowing
that no one in the place could translate and interpret
except myself.</p>

<p>"By signs and wonders," answered the girl. "<i>Some</i>
wonders! He certainly made himself clear... !"</p>

<p>"Was he?... Did he?..." I stammered, hardly
knowing how to ask if the ruffian had seized her in his
hot, amorous embrace and made fierce love to her.... My
blood boiled, though my heart sank, and I knew that depth
of trembling apprehension that is the true Fear&mdash;the fear
for another whom we&mdash;whom we&mdash;esteem.</p>

<p>"Now don't you go prying heavy-hoofed into a young
thing's first love affair, Major&mdash;because I shan't stand
for it," replied Miss Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>"Had you your pistol with you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I had, Major," was the reply. "I don't get caught that
way twice."</p>

<p>And I reflected that if the Sheikh el Habibka el Wazir
was still alive, he had not been violent.</p>

<p class="first">
That day I was not allowed to ride out for exercise,
and a big Soudanese sentry was posted closer to my
tent-door.</p>

<p>Hitherto I had felt myself under strict surveillance;
now I was under actual arrest.</p>

<p>The girls were invited, or ordered, to go riding as
usual, and my frame of mind can be imagined.</p>

<p>Nothing could save them.... Nothing could now bring
about the success of my mission&mdash;unless it were the fierce
greed of these Arabs for gold.... I was a wretchedly
impotent puppet in their hands....</p>

<p>Now that I had mortally insulted and antagonized these
fierce despots, what could I do to protect the woman...
the women... whom I had brought here, and whose sole
hope and trust was in me?...</p>

<p>I realized that a mighty change had been slowly taking
place in my mind, and that it had been completed in the
moment that the Emir had offered to sell me the treaty for
the bodies of these girls.... I knew now that&mdash;instead
of the fate of Mary Vanbrugh being an extra anxiety at the
back of a mind filled with care concerning the treaty&mdash;the
fate of the treaty was an extra anxiety at the back of
a mind filled with care concerning the fate of Mary
Vanbrugh!</p>

<p>Why should this be?</p>

<p>I had begun by disliking her.... At times I had hated
her... and certainly there were times when she appeared
to loathe me utterly.... Why should life, success, duty,
France herself, all weigh as nothing in the balance against
her safety?...</p>

<p>De Lannec? Fool, trifler, infirm of purpose, devoid
of sense of proportion, broken reed and betrayer of his
Service and his Motherland&mdash;<i>or unselfish hero and gallant
gentleman?</i></p>

<p class="first">
And what mattered the answer to that question, if I
was an impotent prisoner, absolutely helpless in the
power of this outraged Emir&mdash;and she was riding with him,
alone....</p>

<h3>A SECOND STRING</h3>

<p class="first">
That night I was honoured by a visit from the Hadji
Abdul Salam, the chief <i>marabout</i> and <i>hakim</i> of this
particular tribe, and a man whose immense influence and
power seemed disproportionate to his virtues and merits.
(One of the things the Occidental mind can never grasp, is
the way in which the Oriental mind can divorce Faith from
Works, the office from its holder, and yield unstinted
veneration to the holy <i>priest,</i> knowing him to be, at the
same time, a worthless and scoundrelly <i>man</i>.)...</p>

<p>The good Hadji crept silently into my tent, in the dead
of night, and very nearly got a bullet through his scheming
brain.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was alone and apparently unarmed, I put
my pistol under my pillow again, and asked him what he
wanted.</p>

<p>The Reverend Father-in-Islam wanted to talk&mdash;in
whispers&mdash;if I would take a most solemn oath to reveal
nothing that he said. I was more than ready, and we
talked of Cabbages and Kings, and also of Sealing-Wax and
Whether Pigs have Wings.... And, after a while, we
talked of Murder&mdash;or rather the Holy One did so.... He
either trusted my keeping faith with him or knew he could
repudiate anything I might say against him later.</p>

<p>I had a touch of fever again, and I was still in the
state of mental turmoil natural to one who has just seen
the edifice of a life's labour go crashing to the earth,
and yet sits rejoicing among the ruins&mdash;thanking God for
failure; his mind moaning a funeral dirge over the grave
of all his hopes and strivings&mdash;his heart chanting a
p&aelig;an of praise and thanksgiving over the saving of
his Self....</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"<i>Come, let us sit upon the ground<br>
And tell sad stories of the death of Kings,<br>
How some have been deposed, some sleeping killed,</i>"</p>

<br>

<p style="text-indent: 0em;">I quoted, from Etonian
memories of Shakespeare's <i>Richard the Second.</i></p>

<p>The Reverend Father looked surprised, and said he had a
proposal to make.</p>

<p>This was that he should contrive to effect my escape,
and that I should return with an army, defeat the Emir, and
make the Hadji Abdul Salam ruler in his place.</p>

<p>An alternative idea was suggested by the probable
assassination of the Emir by one Suleiman the Strong, "of
whom I knew," and who was even now somewhere in the Great
Oasis, <i>and had visited the tents of the Holy Hadji!</i></p>

<p>Would I, on the death of the Emir, help the Hadji to
seize the Seat of Power? He could easily poison Suleiman
the Strong when he had fulfilled his vengeance&mdash;and his
usefulness&mdash;or denounce him to the Tribe as the murderer of
the Emir, and have him impaled alive....</p>

<p>The pious man swore he would be a true and faithful
friend to France.</p>

<p>"As you are to your master, the Emir?" I asked.</p>

<p>The Hadji replied that the Emir was a usurper, and that
no one owed fealty to a usurper.</p>

<p>Moreover this was positively my only chance, as I was
to be put to death shortly.... The Emir might then send
a deputation to the Governor-General of French Africa,
offering to make an alliance on receipt of a subsidy of a
million francs and other advantages, and swearing that no
emissary of the Governor-General's had ever reached him.</p>

<p>Or he might just let the matter rest&mdash;merely keeping
the women, killing me, and washing his hands of French
affairs, or, rather, declining to dirty his hands with
them.... Or, of course, Suleiman might get him&mdash;and then
the Wazir could be eliminated, and the good Hadji, with
French support, could become the Emir and the Friend of
France....</p>

<p>"Supposing you could enable me to escape," I said when
the good Hadji had finished. "I should not do so without
the women. Could you effect their escape with me?"</p>

<p>He could not and would not. Here the Holy One spat and
quoted the unkind words of the great Arab poet, Imr el
Kais:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"One said to me, 'Marry!'<br>
I replied, 'I am happy&mdash;<br>
Why take to my breast<br>
A sackful of serpents?<br>
May Allah curse all woman-kind!'"</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
Two faithful slave-women always slept across the
entrance to the <i>anderun,</i> where the girls were. Even if
the slaves could be killed silently, it would be impossible
to get so big a party away from the place&mdash;many camels,
much food, <i>girbas</i> of water.... No, he could only
manage it for me alone.</p>

<p>He could visit me at night and I could leave the tent
in his <i>burnous</i> and green turban.... He could easily
bribe or terrify a certain Arab soldier, now on sentry-go
outside, and who was bound to be on duty at my tent again
sooner or later. I could simply ride for dear life, with
two good camels, and take my chance.</p>

<p>But the women&mdash;<i>no.</i> Besides, if it ever came out that
he had helped <i>me</i> to escape, it would not be so bad....
But as for getting the women away, he simply would not
consider it....</p>

<p>No&mdash;if I were so extremely anxious about the fate of
my two women ("and, Merciful Allah! what are women, that
serious men should bother about them?"), the best thing I
could do was to consider his firm and generous offer&mdash;the
heads of the Emir and his Vizier on a charger, and the
faithful friendship to France of their successor in power,
the Hadji Abdul Salam.... The Emir had announced his
intention of making the boy-Sheikh not only Sheikh of his
Tribe, but eventually Emir of the Confederation also. The
Hadji would be the young prince's Spiritual Guide, Tutor,
Guardian and Regent&mdash;until the time came to cut the lad's
throat....</p>

<p>"So Suleiman the Strong is here&mdash;and is going to
assassinate the Emir, is he?" I said, after we had sat
eyeing each other, warily and in silence, for some
minutes.</p>

<p>(<i>I must warn the Emir as soon as possible.</i>)</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Hadji. "And where will you be <i>then,</i>
if I am your enemy?"</p>

<p>"Where I am now, I expect," I replied, yawning with a
nonchalance wholly affected.</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> your women?" asked the good man.</p>

<p>I ground my teeth, and my fingers itched to seize this
scoundrel's throat.</p>

<p>"Take my advice and <i>go,</i>" he continued. "Go in the
certainty that you will have done what you came for&mdash;made
an indissoluble and everlasting treaty of alliance between
the <i>Franzawi</i> and the Great Confederation, through their
real ruler, the Hadji Abdul Salam, Regent for the young
Emir after the assassination of the Emir el Hamel el Kebir,
impostor and usurper.... And if he is not assassinated,
no matter&mdash;come with an army&mdash;and a million francs, of
course&mdash;kill him, and make the boy nominal Emir.... I
swear by the Sacred names of God that France shall be as my
father and my mother, and I will be France's most obedient
child.... <i>Go,</i> Sidi, while you can...."</p>

<p>"Get two facts clearly and firmly into your noble mind,
Holy One," I replied. "The first is that I do not leave
this place without the lady Sitts; and the second is that
France has no dealings whatsoever in assassination&mdash;nor
with assassins!"</p>

<p>Then the reverend gentleman played his trump card.</p>

<p>"You are in even greater danger than you think, Sidi,"
he murmured, smiling wryly with his mouth and scowling
fiercely with his eyes. "And our honourable, gracious and
fair-dealing Lord, the Emir el Hamil el Kebir, is but
playing with you as the cat with the mouse.... <i>For you
are not the only mouse in his trap</i>&mdash;oh, no! Not by any
means.... What are <i>Roumi</i> brains against those of the
Arabs, the most wise, learned, subtle and ancient of all
the races of the earth?... Why, you poor fool, <i>there
are other messengers from another Power, here, in the Great
Oasis</i>&mdash;and our fair-spoken Lord gives them audience daily
in their camp...."</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet.... Could this scoundrel be
speaking the truth.... A cold fear settled on my
heart.... What likelihood was there of my leaving this
place alive, if this were true and my own folly and madness
had driven the Emir into the arms of these agents of some
other Power?</p>

<p>My life was nothing&mdash;but what of the fate of Mary
Vanbrugh, when my throat was cut?... I broke out into a
cold perspiration, and the fever left me.... My brain
grew clearer and began to act more quickly. I smiled
derisively and shook an incredulous head.</p>

<p>"And supposing I showed you their camp, Sidi?" sneered
the Hadji. "Suppose I gave you the opportunity to <i>see</i> a
disguised <i>Roumi</i> and <i>to speak to him?</i>"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;then I should be convinced," I replied, and
added&mdash;"And that would certainly change my&mdash;er&mdash;attitude
toward you and your proposal.... When I have seen
these men, and spoken with them&mdash;you may visit me again,
with advantage to your purse...." I must play this
foul-feeding fish on a long line, and match his tricks with
tricks of my own. If it was to be <i>Roumi</i> brains against
Arab brains here also&mdash;well, we would see what we should
see....</p>

<p>"What manner of man is the leader of these emissaries
of another Power?" I asked. "How many of them are
there?... What is the Emir's attitude... ? Tell me
all you can.... I can buy true information at a high
price...."</p>

<p>"So can these others," grinned the pious Hadji. "The
leader has already shaken a bag of good fat Turkish
<i>medjidies</i> before my eyes, and promised it in return for
my help."</p>

<p>"I could shake a bag of something better than that dirty
depreciated Turkish rubbish before your eyes, Hadji," I
replied, "and pour it into your lap too.... Fine new
coins of pure gold! French twenty-franc pieces! Beautiful
for women's chains and bangles, and even more beautiful
to spend on fine raiment, tents, camels, weapons, food,
servants, rugs, horses..."</p>

<p>The rascal's eyes glittered.</p>

<p>"How many, Sidi?" he asked.</p>

<p>"As many as you earn.... As many as your help is
worth.... Now talk...."</p>

<p>"It is a small caravan, Sidi," began this saintly
<i>marabout,</i> "but very well equipped. There is plenty of
money behind it.... I never saw better camels nor
weapons, and their hired camel-men are well-paid and
content.... I do not know from whom they really come,
but they have the blessing of the Father of the Faithful,
God's Vicar upon Earth, who rules at Stamboul, and of
the Great Sheikh of the Senussi. They say this openly in
<i>mejliss&mdash;</i>and prove it with documents, passes, <i>firmans</i>
and letters&mdash;but they talk privately, at night, with the
Emir and the Wazir...."</p>

<p>"What do they offer, openly?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The friendship and protection of the King of Kings,
the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Father of the Faithful,
who dwells at Stamboul; and the friendship and alliance of
the powerful Sheikh el Senussi.... A great Pan-Islamic
Alliance is being formed, in readiness for a certain Day of
<i>Jehad...</i> ."</p>

<p>"And in private?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That I do not know," was the reply. "Only that
dog of a Wazir&mdash;may swine defile the graves of his
ancestors&mdash;knoweth the mind of the Emir; and he alone
accompanies him to the tents of the <i>Roumi.</i>"</p>

<p>"But this I <i>do</i> know," he continued, "<i>they will give
me wealth untold if I will poison you and the two Sitts,</i>
whom they declare to be female spies of the French&mdash;sent to
debauch and beguile the Emir with their charms...."</p>

<p>"How do they know of our presence here?" I asked
quietly, though my blood boiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, I visit them!... I visit them!... And we
talk.... We talk...." replied this treacherous
reptile. "They say I might, if I preferred, kill you and
seize the Sitts for my <i>hareem</i> for a while, before I
either slay them or cut out their tongues.... Dumb women
are the only discreet ones..." and the Hadji laughed
merrily.</p>

<p>I managed to smile coldly, while I burned hotly with
fierce rage, and changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Are they Great Men, Lords, Sidis, Nobles, Officers,
Born Leaders, these emissaries?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied the Hadji. "They are low men on high
horses. They do not walk, speak, look, give, ride, eat nor
act as men of noble birth...."</p>

<p>Through a narrow aperture at the entrance to my tent I
could see that the stars were paling.</p>

<p>"You shall take me to their camp&mdash;now&mdash;Hadji," I said,
and pulled on <i>burnous, haik, kafiyeh,</i> and <i>fil-fil</i>
boots.</p>

<p>The Hadji seemed a little startled.</p>

<p>"It would not look well for me to be seen visiting their
camp now," he said. "It will soon be light...."</p>

<p>"You need not visit their camp," I replied. "Take me to
where I can see it, and then disappear."</p>

<p>The good man sat awhile in thought.</p>

<p>"How much, Sidi?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am not like those others," I replied. "I do not shake
bags of money in the faces of pious and honest men, nor
haggle and bargain. I richly reward those who serve me
well&mdash;very richly&mdash;when their service is completed....
Now do as I say, or go away, and let me sleep in peace, for
this chatter wearies me..." and I yawned.</p>

<p>The Hadji went to the doorway and collogued with the
soldier without.</p>

<p>Returning, he said that he had dispatched my sentry
to inform the guard at the camp of the emissaries that
a man would shortly visit the latter, and must not be
challenged, as he came from the Emir on secret business.
The countersign was "Stamboul."</p>

<p>"This fellow, one Gharibeel Zarrug, is entirely faithful
to me, Sidi," he added. "You can always send me messages
by his mouth. I can arrange that he is very frequently on
guard over your tent."</p>

<p>We sat in silence for a few minutes, a silence broken
by the Hadji's request for a taste of the <i>sharab</i> of
the Infidels. I gave the good man a nip of cognac and I
believe this bound him to my interests (until they clashed
with his) more strongly than gold would have done. He had
all the stigmata of the secret drunkard, and his tongue
continually flickered at his lips like that of a snake.</p>

<p>The soldier returned and whispered.</p>

<p>"Come, Sidi," said the Hadji, "I will take you as far as
is safe."</p>

<p>"Safe for me or for you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nowhere is safe for <i>you,</i> Sidi," was the reply. "Take
my advice and flee for your life&mdash;to return with an army,
and a treaty which I will sign as Regent...."</p>

<p>I did my best by careful noting of direction, the stars,
clumps of trees, tents, water-runnels and stones, to ensure
my being able to make the return journey....</p>

<p>After we had walked for about a mile, the Hadji stopped
in the black shadow of some palms and pointed to an orderly
cluster of tents, just visible from where we stood.</p>

<p>"That is their camp, Sidi," said the Hadji, "and beyond
those palms are their camel-lines and servants' quarters
and the bivouac of a Camel Corps section&mdash;provided for
the&mdash;ah&mdash;protection of the party..." and without another
word the Reverend Father vanished.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
I walked boldly across to the principal tent, ignored
the distant sentry, and entered.</p>

<p>Two men slept on rugs, one an obvious Oriental, the
other slightly fairer of complexion and with heavy
moustache and huge beard.</p>

<p>I studied his face by the light of the lantern that hung
from the tent-pole, and learned nothing from it&mdash;but I
suspected a disguised European. The man's hands were larger
than those of an Arab and there was more colour, in what I
could see of his cheeks, than I should expect in those of a
native.</p>

<p>Turning to the lamp, I unhooked it and held it to his
face, so that the light fell upon it while mine was in the
shadow thrown by the back of the lamp&mdash;a common bazaar
affair of European make, such as hangs on the walls of the
cheap hotels of Algeria and Tunis. I then drew a bow at a
venture.</p>

<p>I struck the sleeper heavily on the chest, and, as he
opened his eyes and sat up, said coolly:</p>

<p>"<i>Bon jour, mon cher Monsieur Becque!</i>"</p>

<p>My shaft winged true.</p>

<p>"<i>Himmel!</i>" he exclaimed, half awake and startled into
unguarded speech. And then, collecting his scattered wits,
said in French&mdash;"<i>What is it? Who are you?</i>" and his hand
went under his pillow.</p>

<p>"Keep still!" I said sternly, and my revolver came from
under my <i>burnous,</i> and he looked into the muzzle of it.</p>

<p>And, as he looked, the cast in his left eye was
obvious.</p>

<p>"Who <i>are</i> you?" he said again in French.</p>

<p>And then a third voice added, in the same tongue,
"Whoever you are, drop that pistol. <i>Quick&mdash;</i>I have you
covered."</p>

<p>Like a fool, I had absolutely forgotten the second
man in my excitement at discovering that it was indeed
<i>Becque,</i> the man whom Raoul d'Auray de Redon had seen in
Zaguig before its occupation by the French.... My old
friend, <i>Becque!</i>...</p>

<p>An awkward dilemma!... If I dropped my revolver
I should be at their mercy, and if I did not I should
probably be shot in the back and buried in the sand beneath
their tent&mdash;for even if they did not know who I was, they
knew (thanks to the triple traitor, Abdul Salam) that I was
a rival and an enemy.... Who else would speak French in
that place?</p>

<p>How neatly should I be removed from their path!</p>

<p>None but the rogue Abdul Salam knew that I was aware
of their existence&mdash;much less that I had actually entered
their tent.... The sentry of course did not know me,
in my disguise, and the sound of the pistol-shot could
easily be explained, if it were heard and inquiries were
made.... An accident.... A shot at a prowling pariah
cur or jackal that had entered the tent and alarmed one of
them, suddenly awakened....</p>

<p>I should simply <i>disappear,</i> and my disappearance would
be a soon-forgotten mystery, and probably ascribed to
sudden flight prompted by fear&mdash;for had I not abused the
Emir with unforgettable and unforgiveable insults?...
And then what of Mary Vanbrugh and Maudie&mdash;the French
female spies sent to beguile and debauch the Emir and win
his consent to the treaty?... <i>Mary Vanbrugh would think
I had fled, deserting her</i>&mdash;<i>in the name of Duty!</i></p>

<p>All this flashed through my mind like lightning. What
should I do?... What about a shot into Becque's vile
heart and a swift wheel about and a shot at the Arab?</p>

<p>No&mdash;he would fire in the same second that I shot Becque,
and he could not miss me at a range of six feet.... Nor
could I, even in such a situation, shoot a defenceless man
in his bed....</p>

<p>Perhaps I could have done so in the days before Mary
Vanbrugh had made me see Life and Honour and true Duty in
so different a light....</p>

<p><i>Then</i> I should have said, "What would France have me
do?" Now I said, "What would Mary Vanbrugh have me do?"</p>

<p>And I somehow felt that Mary would say: "Live
if you can, and die if you must&mdash;but not with this
defenceless man's blood on your hands, his murder on your
conscience..." even if she knew what he had plotted and
proposed concerning her and her maid.</p>

<p>Perhaps a couple of seconds had passed&mdash;and then the
voice behind me spoke again with sharp menace.</p>

<p>"<i>Quick</i>&mdash;I am going to shoot!..."</p>

<p>"<i>So am I,</i>" said yet a fourth voice coolly, in Arabic,
and even, in that moment, I marvelled that the Arab
speaker should so aptly have gathered the import of the
French words&mdash;though actions, of course, speak louder than
words.</p>

<p>I recognized the voice of the Emir.</p>

<p>"Everybody shooting everybody this morning," added the
Vizier&mdash;inevitable shadow of his master.</p>

<p>Keeping Becque covered I turned my head. Two excellent
European revolvers threatened the fellow who, green with
fright, put his automatic on the ground.</p>

<p>I put my own back into the holster beneath my <i>burnous.</i>
Evidently the Emir was making one of his unobtrusive visits
to the excellent Becque&mdash;and he had come in the nick of
time. Or was he so well served that he had known of my
visit here, and come to catch me and Becque together?</p>

<p>"<i>Kief halak,</i> Emir el Hamel el Kebir," I said coolly.
"The sound of thy voice is sweet in my ears and the sight
of thy face as the first gleam of the rising sun."</p>

<p>"In the circumstances, I do not doubt it, <i>Roumi,</i>" was
the reply, "for you stood at the Gates of Death.... What
do you here?"</p>

<p>"I am visiting an old friend, Sidi Emir," I replied,
"and my purpose is to resume a discussion, interrupted,
owing to circumstances beyond his control, many years
ago."</p>

<p>The Emir and the Vizier, their inscrutable, penetrating
eyes fixed on mine, stared in thoughtful silence.</p>

<p>"Explain," said the Emir at length.</p>

<p>"Lord Emir of Many Tents and Ruler of many Tribes,
Leader of the Faithful and Shadow of the Prophet," I said,
"you are a person of honour, a warrior, a man of your
hands as well as a man of your word.... Like me, you
are a soldier.... Now, I once honoured this dog&mdash;for an
excellent reason&mdash;by crossing swords with him. For an even
better and greater reason I would cross swords with him
again&mdash;and finish, utterly and completely, the duel begun
so long ago.... I tell you, a lover of your People, that
this cur would betray his People. I tell you, a respecter
of women, that this white reptile is trying to achieve
the dishonour and death of two white women.... You may
think I wish merely to kill one who is a rival for your
favour and alliance. Were that all he is, I would not try
to defeat him thus. I would meet a fair adversary with fair
attempts to out-bid and out-man&oelig;uvre him.... But
as he has secretly plotted most foully against my country
(and his own), against the lives and honour of the lady
Sitts, and against my life&mdash;I ask you to let me meet him
face to face and foot to foot and sword to sword&mdash;that
I may punish him and rid my country of a matricidal
renegade...."</p>

<p>The two Sheikhs stared in silence, stroking their
beards, their hard unreadable eyes, enigmatic, faintly
mocking, watching my face unwaveringly.</p>

<p>"Swords are sharp and final arguments&mdash;and some quarrels
can only be settled with them," mused the Emir. "What says
our other honoured guest... ?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll fight him!" spoke up Becque. "It will give me
real pleasure to kill this chatter-box...."</p>

<p>He turned to me with a smile that lifted one corner of
his mouth and showed a gleaming dog-tooth.</p>

<p>"And so you are the bright <i>de Beaujolais,</i> are you?" he
marvelled. "Well, well, well! Think of that now!... De
Beaujolais&mdash;the Beau Sabreur of the Blue Hussars!... De
Beaujolais, the Beau Sabreur of the Spahis and the Secret
Service!... De Beaujolais, the Hero of Zinderneuf!...
Well, my friend, I'll make you de Beaujolais of a little
hole in the sand, shortly, and see you where the birds
won't trouble you&mdash;and you won't trouble <i>me!...</i> The
great and clever de Beaujolais!... Ha! Ha! Ha!" And the
brave, brazen rogue roared with laughter.</p>

<p>(But how in the name of his father the Devil did he know
anything of the affair at Zinderneuf?)</p>

<p>"You shall fight as soon as the light is good," said
the Emir. "And you shall fight with Arab swords&mdash;a strange
weapon to each of you, and therefore fair for both"; and,
calling to Yussuf Fetata, he bade him send for two swords
of equal length and weight and of exactly similar shape.</p>

<h2><a name="c115" id="c115"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>"MEN HAVE THEIR EXITS..."</h3>

<p class="first">
Half an hour later, Becque and I stood face to face in
the shadow, cast by the rising sun, of a great clump of
palms.</p>

<p>We were stripped to the waist, and wore only baggy Arab
trousers and soft boots.</p>

<p>Each held a noble two-edged sword, pliant as cane, sharp
as a razor, exact model of those brought to the country by
Louis the Good and his Crusaders. I verily believe they
<i>were</i> Crusaders' swords, for there are many such in that
dry desert where nothing rusts and a good sword is more
prized, cared for, and treasured, than a good woman.</p>

<p>I looked for a knightly crest on the blade of mine.
Had there been one, and had it been the very crest of
the de Beaujolais family (for I have ancestors who went
on Crusade)&mdash;what an omen! What a glorious and wonderful
coincidence! What a tale to tell!</p>

<p>But I will be truthful and admit that there was no
private mark whatever. Such things do not happen in real
life&mdash;though it is stark fact that a venerable friend
of mine killed a Dahomeyan warrior in Dodd's advance on
Dahomey, and took from him the <i>very Gras rifle that he
himself had carried as a private in</i> 1870! (He knew it
both by its number and by a bullet-hole in the butt. It
had evidently been sold to these people by some dealer in
condemned army stores.)</p>

<p>The only fault I had to find with my beautiful Crusader-
sword was that it had no hand-guard, nothing between handle
and blade but a thin straight cross-piece. However, the
same applied to Becque's weapon.</p>

<p>I looked at Becque. He "peeled well" as English boxers
say, was finely muscled, and in splendid condition.</p>

<p>Whether the strangeness of our weapons would be in his
favour as a stronger if less finished swordsman, or in
mine, remained to be seen.</p>

<p>He spat upon his right hand&mdash;coarse and vulgar as
ever&mdash;and swung his sword mightily, trying its weight and
balance.</p>

<p>In a little group under the trees stood the Emir, the
Vizier; young Yussuf Fetata (to whose family the swords
belonged); the powerful dwarf who had first captured me,
Marbruk ben Hassan; the Emir's body-servant, El R'Orab the
Crow; the Egyptian-Arab colleague of Becque, and a few
soldiers.</p>

<p>"Hear my words," said the Emir, and his hawk-like stare
was turned to Becque, "for the least attempt at foul play,
I will shoot you dead.... When I say '<i>Begin</i>'&mdash;do
so. When I say '<i>Stop,</i>' do so instantly.... I shall
not say '<i>Stop</i>' while both of you are on your feet,
unless one of you does anything unbecoming a chivalrous
warrior...."</p>

<p>I bowed and gave the Emir the sword-salute....</p>

<p>"<i>Begin!</i>" he said a moment later, and Becque repeated
the very tactics of our previous duel.</p>

<p>He rushed at me like a tiger, his sword moving like
forked lightning, and I gave my whole mind and body to
parry and defence. I was not in the best of health and
strength, thanks to my wound, my sleepless nights of
anxiety, and my confinement to the tent&mdash;and if Becque
chose to force the pace and tire himself, I was content.</p>

<p>All critics of my "form" have praised my foot-work, and
I used my feet and brain to save my arm, for the swords
were heavy.</p>

<p>At the end of his first wild whirling attack, when his
sword ceased for a moment to rise and fall like a flail in
the hands of a madman, I feinted for his head, and, as his
sword went up, I lunged as though I held a sabre. He sprang
back like a cat, and then made a Maltese-cross pattern with
his sword&mdash;as though he were a Highlander wielding a light
claymore&mdash;when I pursued.</p>

<p>Nothing could pass that guard&mdash;but it was expensive
work, costly in strength and breath, and he was very
welcome to make that impressive display&mdash;and I kept him at
it by light and rapid feints....</p>

<p>Suddenly his sword went up and back, as to smite
straight down upon my skull, and, judging that I had time
for the man&oelig;uvre, I did not parry&mdash;but sprang to my
left and slashed in a smart <i>coup de flanc</i> that took him
across the ribs beneath the raised right arm. A little
higher and he would never have lifted his arm again;
but, as it was, I gave him a gash that would mean a nice
little blood-letting. In the same second, his sword fell
perpendicularly on my right thigh, merely slicing off an
inconsiderable&mdash;shall I say "rasher"&mdash;and touching no
artery nor vein of importance.</p>

<p>I had drawn first blood&mdash;first by a fraction of a
second&mdash;and I had inflicted a wound and received a
graze.</p>

<p>"<i>Mary Vanbrugh,</i>" I whispered.</p>

<p>I saw momentary fear in Becque's eyes, but knew it was
only fear that I had wounded him too severely for him to
continue the fight.</p>

<p>He began to retreat; he retreated quickly; he almost
ran backward for a few paces&mdash;and, as I swiftly followed,
he ducked, most cleverly and swiftly, below my sword&mdash;as
it cut sideways at his neck&mdash;and lunged splendidly at my
breast. A side step only just saved me, for his point and
edge ploughed along the flesh of my left side and the other
edge cut my upper arm as it rested for the moment against
my body.... But the quick <i>riposte</i> has always been my
strong point, and before his sword returned on guard, I cut
him heavily across the head.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it was only a back-handed blow delivered
as my sword returned to guard, and it was almost the hilt
that struck him. Had it been the middle of the edge&mdash;even
at such close quarters and back-handed&mdash;the cut would have
been more worthy of the occasion. As it was, it did friend
Becque no good at all.</p>

<p>"<i>Mary Vanbrugh,</i>" I whispered, a second time.</p>

<p>And then my opponent changed his tactics and used his
sword two-handed.</p>

<p>One successful stroke delivered thus would lop off a
limb or sever a head from a body&mdash;but though the force of
every blow is doubled in value, the quickness of every
parry is halved, and, since my opponent chose to turn his
weapon into a mace, I turned mine into a foil, instead of
obediently following his tactics.</p>

<p>It was rhinoceros against leopard now, strong dog
against quick cat&mdash;possibly Goliath against David....</p>

<p>Hitherto we had crossed swords point downward, as in
"sabres," now I held mine point upward as in "foils," and
dodged and danced on my toes, feinting for a thrust.</p>

<p>Cut or thrust?...</p>

<p>A cut from Becque would be death for de Beaujolais&mdash;and
I was very sure a thrust from de Beaujolais would be death
for Becque....</p>

<p>My foe forced the pace again.... He rushed like a
bull, and I dodged like a matador. A hundred times his
sword swept past my head like a mighty scythe, and so
swift was he that never had I a chance for the matador's
stroke&mdash;the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce.</i> We were both panting,
our breath whistling through parched throats and mouths,
our bare chests heaving like bellows.... We were
streaming with sweat and blood&mdash;and, with glaring glassy
eye, Becque was fiercely scowling, and he was hoarsely
croaking:</p>

<p>"<i>Curse you!</i> you damned dancing-master! <i>God smite
you!... Blast you,</i> you jumping monkey!" with each
terrific stroke; and de Beaujolais was smiling and
whispering "<i>Mary Vanbrugh... Mary... Mary</i>..."
but, believe me, de Beaujolais was weakening, for he had
lost a lot of blood, his left arm was a useless weight of
lead, he was growing giddy and sick and faint&mdash;and suddenly
Becque, with a look of devilish hate and rage upon his
contorted face, swept his sword once more above his head,
and this time swept it up too far!</p>

<p>It was well above his head&mdash;and pointing downward behind
him&mdash;for a stroke that should cleave me to the chin, when
I dropped my point and lunged with all my strength and
speed.... "<i>Mary Vanbrugh!</i>"...</p>

<p class="first">
I had won. My sword stood out a foot behind
him....</p>

<p>He tottered and fell.... My knees turned to water and
I collapsed across his body.</p>

<p>"<i>Exit Becque!</i>" thought I, as I went down&mdash;"and perhaps
de Beaujolais too!..."</p>

<p class="first">
I recovered in a few minutes, to find that the Emir
himself was holding my head and pouring glorious cold water
on my face, chest and hands.... The Vizier was washing
my cuts....</p>

<p>Becque was not dead&mdash;but, far from surgeons and
hospitals, no man could long survive the driving of that
huge sword through his body....</p>

<p>Poor devil!&mdash;but he <i>was</i> a devil!</p>

<p class="first">
"The Sitt has bandages and cordials," I said to the
Emir, as I rose to my feet, and he at once despatched
R'Orab the Crow to bid the slave-girls of the <i>anderun</i> to
ask the lady Sitt to send what was needed for a wounded
man.</p>

<p>I did what I could for the unconscious Becque and then
I resumed my <i>jelabia, haik, kafiyeh</i> and <i>burnous,</i> after
drinking deeply of the cool water, and dabbing my bleeding
wounds.</p>

<p>The congratulatory Arabs crowded round me, filled
with admiration of the victor. Would they have done
the same with Becque, if he had won?... Nothing
succeeds like success.... To him that hath shall be
given.... <i>V&aelig; victis</i>.... Thumbs down for the
loser....</p>

<p>"Do you send for medicaments for yourself or for your
enemy, Sidi?" asked the Emir.</p>

<p>"For my enemy, Emir," I replied. "It is the Christian
custom."</p>

<p>"But he <i>is</i> your enemy," said the Emir.</p>

<p>"Anyone can help an injured <i>friend,</i>" I replied. "If
that is held to be a virtue, how much more is it a virtue
to help a fallen foe?"</p>

<p>Sententious&mdash;but suitable to the company and the
occasion.</p>

<p>The Emir smiled and shook my hand in European fashion,
and the Vizier followed his example.</p>

<p>I was in high favour and regard&mdash;for the moment&mdash;as the
winner of a good stout fight.... <i>For the moment!...</i>
What of the morrow, when their chivalrous fighting
blood had cooled&mdash;and my foul insults and abuse were
remembered?...</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
And then appeared Mary Vanbrugh, following El R'Orab,
who carried the medicine chest and a bottle and some white
stuff&mdash;lint or cotton-wool and bandages.</p>

<p>I might have known that she would not merely send the
necessary things, when she heard of wounds and injuries.</p>

<p>She glanced at the semi-conscious Becque, a hideous
gory spectacle, and then at me. I suppose I looked haggard
and dishevelled and there was a little blood on my
clothes&mdash;also I held the good sword, that had perhaps saved
her life and honour, in my hand.</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> work?" she said in a voice of ice and steel.</p>

<p>I did not deny it.</p>

<p>"More <i>Duty?</i>" she asked most bitterly, and her voice
was scathing. "Oh, you <i>Killer,</i> you professional paid
hireling <i>Slayer....</i> Oh, you <i>Murderer</i> in the sacred
name of your noble <i>Duty!...</i> Tell these men to bring me
a lot more water&mdash;and to make a stretcher with spears or
tent-poles and some rugs..." and she got to work like a
trained nurse.</p>

<p>"Tear up a clean <i>burnous,</i> or something, in long
strips," she said as I knelt to help her..." and then
get out of my sight&mdash;you <i>sicken</i> me...."</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, too?" she asked a moment later, as more
blood oozed through from my thigh, ribs and arm.</p>

<p>"A little," I replied.</p>

<p>"I am glad you <i>are,</i>" said Miss Vanbrugh; "it serves
you right"&mdash;and then..." Suppose it had been <i>you</i> lying
here dying... ?"</p>

<p>I supposed it, and thanked the good God that it was
not&mdash;for her sake.</p>

<p>When she had cleaned, sterilized and bandaged Becque's
ghastly wound, she bade me tell the Arabs to have him
carried to the Guest-tents and laid on my bed, that she
might nurse him! Her orders were obeyed, and, under her
superintendence, the wounded man was carried away with all
possible care.</p>

<p>I noticed that the Emir bade Yussuf Fetata conduct the
Egyptian-Arab back to his tent, and see that he did not
leave it.</p>

<p>When everything possible had been done for Becque,
and he lay on my bed motionless and only imperceptibly
breathing, Mary Vanbrugh turned to me.</p>

<p>"I'll attend to <i>you</i> now, Killer," said she.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Vanbrugh," I replied, "I can attend to
what scratches I have quite well."</p>

<p>She looked at me, as in doubt. Her instinctive love
of mothering and succouring the injured seemed to be at
war with her instinctive hatred of those who cause the
injury.</p>

<p>"Let me see the wound in your side," she said. "If you
can look after your leg yourself, you cannot dress and
bandage a wound in the ribs properly."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't trouble you for worlds, Miss Vanbrugh," I
replied. "Doubtless the noted Doctor Hadji Abdul Salam
will treat me.... These Arab specialists have some
quite remarkable methods, such as making one swallow an
appropriate quotation from the <i>Q'ran,</i> written on paper or
rag, correctly blessed and suitably sanctified.... Do me
a lot of good, I should think.... And possibly Maudie
would lend a hand if the Doctor thinks a bandage..." And
then loss of blood, following a terrific fight (on an empty
stomach) had its humiliating effect on my already enfeebled
body, and down I went in a heap....</p>

<p class="first">
When I recovered consciousness, Mary Vanbrugh and a
very white-faced Maudie were in the tent, and I was lying,
bandaged, on some rugs.</p>

<p>Dear Becque and I&mdash;side by side!</p>

<p>"Brandy," said Mary Vanbrugh to Maudie, as I opened my
eyes. Maudie poured some out, and gave it to me. I drank
the cognac, and was very soon my own man again. How often
was this drama to be repeated?... First the Touareg
bullet; now Becque's sword. What would the third be?</p>

<p>I was soon to know.</p>

<p>I sat up, got to my feet, stiff, sore, bruised and
giddy, but by no means a "cot-case."</p>

<p>"Lie down again at once, Killer," said Mary Vanbrugh
sharply.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Vanbrugh," I replied. "I am all right
again now, and very greatly regret the trouble I have given
you. I am most grateful...."</p>

<p>"I do not desire your gratitude, Killer," interrupted
the pale, competent, angry girl.</p>

<p>"... To Becque&mdash;I was going to say&mdash;for being so
tender with me," I continued. And then I said a thing that
I have regretted ever since&mdash;and when I think of it, I have
to find some peace in the excuse that I was a little off my
balance.</p>

<p>"It is not so long since you were fairly glad of the
killing-powers of a Killer, Miss Vanbrugh," I went on, and
felt myself a cad as I said it.... "On a certain roof
in Zaguig, the Killer against eight, and your life in the
balance.... I apologize for reminding you.... I am
ashamed..."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> am ashamed <i>... I</i> apologize&mdash;humbly, Major
de Beaujolais," she replied, and her eyes were slightly
suffused as I took her hand and pressed it to my
lips.... "But oh! why <i>do</i> you... why <i>must</i>
you... all these fine men... that Mr. Dufour,
Achmet, Djikki, and now this poor mangled, butchered
creature.... Can you find <i>no</i> Duty that is help and
kindness and love, instead of this Duty of killing,
maiming, hurting... ?"</p>

<p class="first">
Yes&mdash;I was beginning to think that I could find a Duty
that was Love....</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
Becque rallied that night, incredibly. His strong spirit
flickered, flared up, and then burnt clearly.</p>

<p>I was getting myself a drink, being consumed with
thirst, when he spoke:</p>

<p>"So you win, de Beaujolais," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"I win, Becque," I replied.</p>

<p>I would not rejoice over a fallen foe, and I would not
express regret to a villainous renegade and a treacherous
cur&mdash;who, moreover, had plotted the death, mutilation
and dishonour of two white girls (and one of them <i>Mary
Vanbrugh).</i></p>

<p>"It's a queer world," he mused. "You all but shot me
that day, and I all but got you hanged.... The merest
chance saved me, and luck saved you...."</p>

<p>I supposed this to be the semi-delirious wanderings of a
fevered mind.... But the brave evil Becque did not look,
nor sound, delirious.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I said, more for the sake of saying
something than seriously to ask a question.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;the brilliant de Beaujolais&mdash;Beau Sabreur of the
Blue Hussars and the Spahis!... Bright particular star
of the <i>Bureau Arabe,</i> the Secret Service, the Intelligence
Department of the French Army in Africa!... You think
you know a lot, don't you, and you're very pleased with
your beautiful self&mdash;but you don't know who it was
that turned your own men from down-trodden slaves into
bloodthirsty mutineers, do you?... And you were never
nearer death in all your days.... Do you know, my
clever friend, that if those cursed Arabs had not attacked
at that moment, nothing could have saved you&mdash;thanks to
me?... Do you know that your own men were going to hang
you to the flag-staff and then burn the place and march
off?... '<i>Another mutiny in the discontented and rotten
French Army</i>'!... Headlines in the foreign Press!...
Encouragement to the enemies of France!... That would
have been splendid, eh?"</p>

<p>I thought hard, and cast back in my memory....</p>

<p>Most certainly I had never attempted to shoot Becque,
and still more certainly I had never been in danger of
hanging, at the hands of the gentleman.</p>

<p>In spite of his apparent command of his faculties, he
must be wandering in his mind&mdash;indeed, a place of devious
and tortuous paths in which to wander.</p>

<p>Silence fell, disturbed only by the droning of the flies
which I whisked from his face.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the closed eyes opened and glared at
me like those of a serpent.</p>

<p>"Beautiful, brainy de Beaujolais," the hateful voice
began again. "How nearly I got you that day and how I have
cursed those Arabs ever since&mdash;those black devils from Hell
that saved you...."</p>

<p>Delirium, undoubtedly.... I brushed the flies again
from the sticky lips and moistened them with a corner of a
handkerchief dipped in lemon-juice.</p>

<p>"And when and where was that, Becque?" I asked
conversationally.</p>

<p>"I suppose the mighty warrior, the Beau Sabreur, the
brain of the French Army, has forgotten the little episode
of Zinderneuf?..."</p>

<p>Zinderneuf!...</p>

<p>What <i>could</i> this Becque know of Zinderneuf?...</p>

<p>Was yet another mystery to be added to those
that clustered round the name of that ill-omened
shambles?<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class="first">
<sup>1</sup> <i>Vide</i> "<i>Beau Geste</i>".</p>

<p class="first">
<i>Zinderneuf!... Mutiny</i>...</p>

<p>What was it Dufour had said to me when I ordered the
parade before entering that silent fort, garrisoned by
the Dead, every man on his feet and at his post....
("The Dead forbidden to die. The Fallen who were not
allowed to fall?").... He had said "<i>There is going
to be trouble.... They are rotten with</i> cafard <i>and
over-fatigue.... They will shoot you and desert</i> en
masse!..."</p>

<p>Could this Becque have been there?... Utterly
impossible....</p>

<p>Again I thought hard, cast back in my memory, and
concentrated my whole mind upon the events of that terrible
day....</p>

<p>Dufour was there, of course....</p>

<p>Yes, and that excellent Sergeant Lebaudy, I remembered,
the man who was said to have the biggest voice in the
French Army....</p>

<p>And that punishing Corporal Brille whom I once
threatened with a taste of the <i>crapaudine,</i> when I
found him administering it unlawfully.... I could see
their faces.... Yes.... And that trumpeter who
volunteered to enter that House of the Dead.... Of
course... he was one of the three Gestes, as I learned
when I went to Brandon Abbas in England to be best man at
George Lawrence's wedding.... Lady Brandon was their
aunt....</p>

<p>Yes, and I remembered two fine American soldiers with
whom I spoke in English&mdash;men whom I had, alas, sent to
their deaths by thirst or Arabs, in an attempt to warn St.
Andr&eacute; and his Senegalese, that awful night.</p>

<p>I could recall no one else.... No one at
all....</p>

<p>"And what do <i>you</i> know about Zinderneuf, Becque?" I
asked.</p>

<p>His bitter sneering laugh was unpleasant to hear.
"Oh, you poor fool," he replied. "I know this much
about Zinderneuf&mdash;that you nearly stepped into your
grave there.... Into the grave that <i>I</i> dug for you
there.... However, this place will do equally well."</p>

<p>With my mind back in Zinderneuf, I absently replied:</p>

<p>"You think I shall find my grave <i>here,</i> do you,
Becque?"</p>

<p>"I most earnestly hope so," replied Becque, "I truly
hope, and firmly believe, this Emir will do to you and your
women what I have urged him&mdash;and tried to bribe him&mdash;to
do."</p>

<p>I kept silent, for the man was dying.</p>

<p>"You are not out of the wood yet, Beautiful de
Beaujolais, Beau Sabreur," the cruel, bitter voice went
on.... "My colleague has a brain&mdash;if he hasn't much
guts&mdash;and he has money too. And the power to put down franc
for franc against you or anybody else, and then double
it.... Oh, we shall win.... And I'd give my soul to
survive to see the hour of success&mdash;and you impaled living
on a sharpened palm-trunk and <i>your Secret Service women
given to the Soudanese soldiers....</i>"</p>

<p>I bit my lips and kept silence, for the man was surely
dying.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
In spite of the considered opinion of which Miss
Vanbrugh had delivered herself, I am a humane man, and if
I fight my foe as a soldier should fight him, I try to be
<i>sans rancune</i> when the fight is over.</p>

<p>While Becque was awake and conscious, I would sit with
him, bear with his vileness, and do what I could to assuage
the sufferings of his last hours.... Sometimes men
change and relent and repent on their death-beds.... I
am not a religious man, but I hold tenaciously to what is
good and right, and if approaching death brought a better
frame of mind to Becque, I would do everything in my power
to encourage and develop it.... I would meet him more
than half-way, and if his change of heart were real, I
would readily forgive him, in the name of France and of
Mary Vanbrugh....</p>

<p>"Well, Becque," I said, "I shall do my best against your
colleague&mdash;and <i>I</i> would give a great deal to survive to
see the hour of success, and you, not impaled living, but
speeded on your way, with a safe conduct, back to whence
you came."</p>

<p>"You mealy-mouthed liar," replied my gentleman. "You
have killed me, and there you sit and <i>gloat....</i>"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Becque," I replied. "I am glad I won the
fight&mdash;but I'd do anything I could to help or ease or
comfort you, poor chap...."</p>

<p>"Another lie, you canting hypocrite and swine," Becque
answered me.</p>

<p>"No," I said. "The simple truth."</p>

<p>"Prove it, then," was the quick answer.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked, and rose to get him anything he wanted
or to do anything that he might desire.</p>

<p>"Look you, de Beaujolais," he said, "you are a
soldier.... So am I.... We have both lived hard&mdash;and
my time has come.... Nothing can possibly save me&mdash;here
in the desert without surgeons, an&aelig;sthetics,
oxygen, antiseptics&mdash;and I may linger for days&mdash;wounded
as I am.... I <i>know</i> that nothing on God's earth can
save me&mdash;so do you.... Then let me die now and like a
soldier.... Not like a sick cow in the straw....
Shoot me, de Beaujolais...."</p>

<p>"I can't," I replied.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;as I said&mdash;you are a mealy-mouthed liar, and a
canting hypocrite, full of words and words..." answered
Becque; and then in bitter mockery he mimicked my "<i>I'd do
anything I could for you, poor chap!...</i>"</p>

<p>"I can't murder you, Becque," I said.</p>

<p>"You <i>have,</i>" he replied. "Can't you complete your
job?... No.... The Bold-and-Beautiful de Beaujolais
couldn't do that&mdash;he could only gloat upon his handiwork
and spin out the last hours of the man he had killed....
You and your Arab-debauching women from the stews of
Paris...." And he spat.</p>

<p>"One of those women worked over you like a nurse or a
mother, Becque," I said. "She lavished her tiny store of
cognac, <i>eau-de-Cologne,</i> antiseptics and surgery stuff on
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As I said," he interrupted, "to keep me alive and
gloat...."</p>

<p>Silence fell in that hot, dimly-lighted tent, and I sat
and watched this Becque.</p>

<p>After a while he spoke again.</p>

<p>"De Beaujolais," he said, "I make a last appeal as a
soldier to a soldier.... Don't keep me alive, in agony,
for days&mdash;knowing that I shall be a mortifying mass of
gangrene and corruption before I die.... Knowing that
nothing can save me.... I appeal to you, to you on whose
head my blood is, to spare me <i>that....</i> Put your pistol
near me&mdash;and let Becque die as he has lived, with a weapon
in his hand...."</p>

<p>I thought rapidly.</p>

<p>"... Come, come, de Beaujolais, it is not <i>much</i>
to ask, surely. It leaves your lily-white hands clean
and saves your conscience the reproach that you let me
suffer tortures that the Arabs themselves would spare
me...."</p>

<p>I came to a decision.</p>

<p>"De Beaujolais&mdash;if I have the ghost of a chance of
life, refuse my request.... If I have no chance, and
you <i>know</i> I have none&mdash;as surely as you know the sun will
rise&mdash;then, if you are a man, a human creature with a spark
of humane feeling in you&mdash;put your pistol by my hand....
You can turn your back if you are squeamish.... Do it,
de Beaujolais, and I will die forgiving you and repenting
my sins...."</p>

<p>His voice broke, and I swallowed a lump in my throat
as I rose and went to where my revolver hung to the
tent-pole. My sword had passed below his lungs and had
penetrated the liver and stomach and probably the spinal
cord. He would never leave that bed, nothing upon earth
could save him, and his long lingering death would be a
ghastly thing.... It <i>was</i> the one thing I could do for
him....</p>

<p>I put the pistol beside his right hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Becque," I said. "In the name of France and
Mary Vanbrugh I forgive the evil you tried to do to them
both.... Personally I feel no hate whatsoever....
Good-bye, brave man&mdash;good-bye, old chap...." And I
touched his hand and turned my back.</p>

<p class="first">
The bullet cut my ear.</p>

<p>I sprang round and knocked the pistol from Becque's
hand.</p>

<p>"You treacherous <i>devil</i>!" I cried.</p>

<p>"You poor gullible <i>fool</i>!" he answered, with the wry
smile that showed the gleaming fang.</p>

<p>The sentry raised the door flap and looked in, and Mary
Vanbrugh rushed from the <i>anderun</i> half of the tent, as I
picked up my revolver.</p>

<p>"<i>Oh! What is it?</i>" she asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"An accident," replied Becque. "One of the most
deplorable that ever happened.... I shall regret it all
my life...." And he laughed.</p>

<p>There was no denying the gameness and stout heart of
this dear Becque.</p>

<p>"More Duty, I thought, perhaps, Major de Beaujolais,"
observed the girl.</p>

<p>"It was. As I conceived it, Miss Vanbrugh," I
replied.</p>

<p>After looking at Becque's bandages and giving him a sip
of hot <i>soupe,</i> made with our compressed meat-tablets and
a little cognac, she returned to the <i>anderun,</i> bidding me
drink the <i>soupe,</i> for Becque could do little more than
taste it.</p>

<p>"You win again, you dog!" said Becque, as soon as we
were alone. "What a fool I was to aim at your head&mdash;with
a shaking hand!... But I did so want to see those poor
brains you are so proud of.... <i>Now,</i> will you kill
me?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered.</p>

<p>"<i>I know you won't!</i>" he replied. "You haven't the
guts.... <i>And I know I shall recover....</i> Why, you
fool, I breathe almost without pain.... My lungs are
absolutely sound.... You only gave me a flesh wound and
I heal splendidly. Always have done...."</p>

<p>The poor wretch evidently did not know that the bandages
hid as surely mortal a wound as ever man received. His talk
of fatal injuries and certain death, which he had supposed
to be a ruse that would gull and fool me, was but the
simple truth.</p>

<p>"I'll be on my feet in a week, you witless ape," he
continued, "and I'll get you yet!... Believe me,
Beautiful de Beaujolais, I won't miss you next time I
shoot.... But I hope it won't come to that.... I
want to see you die quite otherwise&mdash;and then I'll deal
with your Arab-debauching harlots.... But I'll get you
somehow! I'll <i>get</i> you, my Beau Sabreur!..."</p>

<p>He raised himself on one elbow, pointed a shaking hand
at my face, spat, and fell back dead....</p>

<h3>FOR MY LADY</h3>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"The worldly hopes men set their hearts upon,<br>
Turn ashes&mdash;or they prosper;<br>
Anon, like snow upon the desert's dusty face,<br>
Lighting a little hour or two&mdash;are gone...."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
Becque's body having been borne away at dawn for burial,
I soon began to wonder if the events of the previous day
and night had really occurred, or whether they were the
nightmare imaginings of a delirious fever-victim.</p>

<p>My wounds were real enough, however, and though slight,
were painful in the extreme, throbbing almost unbearably
and making movement a torture.</p>

<p>I would not have been without them though, for three
times that day Mary Vanbrugh dressed them, and if I
scarcely heard her voice, I felt the blessed touch of her
fingers.</p>

<p>But she attended me as impersonally and coldly as a
queen washing the feet of beggars, or as a certain type of
army-surgeon doctoring a sick negro soldier.</p>

<p>As she left the tent on the last of her almost silent
visits, she paused at the door-curtain and turned to me.</p>

<p>"What exactly <i>was</i> that shot in the night, Major de
Beaujolais?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It was Becque shooting at me," I replied. "You did not
suppose that it was me shooting at Becque, did you, Miss
Vanbrugh?"</p>

<p>"I really did not know, Major de Beaujolais," answered
the girl. "I should not be so foolish as to set <i>any</i> limit
to what you might do in the name of <i>Duty!...</i> Nothing
<i>whatever</i> would surprise me in that direction, now, I
think...."</p>

<p>"A man's duty <i>is</i> his duty," I replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite," she answered. "I would not have you
deviate a hair's breadth from your splendid path....
But since the day you informed me that you would have left
me to the mercies of the Touareg&mdash;had there been but one
camel&mdash;I have been thinking... a good deal.... Yes,
'<i>A man's duty is his duty,'</i> and&mdash;if I might venture to
speak so presumptuously&mdash;a woman's duty is <i>her</i> duty,
too...."</p>

<p>"Surely," I agreed.</p>

<p>"And so I find it <i>my</i> duty to hinder you no further,
and to remain in the Oasis with these fine Arabs&mdash;<i>under
the protection of the Emir el Hamel el Kebir....</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" I shouted, startled out of my habitual calm
and courtesy. "You find it your '<i>duty</i>' to do <i>what?</i>"</p>

<p>I felt actually faint&mdash;and began to tremble with horror,
fear, and a deadly sickness of soul.</p>

<p>"I think you heard what I said," the girl replied
coldly, "and I think you know that I always mean what I
say, and say what I mean.... Oh, believe me, Major de
Beaujolais&mdash;I have some notions of my own on <i>duty</i>&mdash;and it
is no part of mine to hinder yours...."</p>

<p>I drank some water, and my trembling hand spilt more
than my dry throat swallowed.</p>

<p>"So I shall remain here," she went on, "and I think too
that I prefer the standards and ideals of this Emir....
Somehow I do not think that <i>anything</i> would have induced
<i>him</i> to leave a woman to certain death or worse.... Not
even a <i>treaty!</i>" and the bitter scorn of her accents, as
she said that word, was terrible.</p>

<p>Her voice seared and scorched me.... I tried to speak
and could not.</p>

<p>"Nor do I feel that I shall incur any greater danger
here than I should in setting off into the Desert again
with a gentleman of your pronounced views on the subject
of the relative importance of a woman and a piece of
paper.... Nor shall my maid go with you.... I prefer
to trust her, as well as myself, to these people of a
less-developed singleness of purpose... and I <i>like</i>
this Emir&mdash;enormously."</p>

<p>I found my voice.... Clumsily, owing to my wounds, I
knelt before her....</p>

<p>"Miss Vanbrugh... <i>Mary</i>..." I cried. "This
is inhuman cruelty.... This is <i>madness!...</i>
Think!... A girl like yourself&mdash;a lovely fascinating
woman&mdash;<i>here... alone....</i> You must be insane....
Think.... A <i>hareem</i>&mdash;these Arabs.... I would sooner
shoot you here and now.... This is sheer incredible
<i>madness....</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;like yourself, Major de Beaujolais," she replied,
drawing back from me. "<i>I</i> am now 'mad' on the subject of
<i>Duty....</i> It has become an obsession with <i>me</i> too&mdash;(an
example of the influence of one's companions upon one's
character!)&mdash;and I find it my duty to leave you entirely
free to give the whole of your mind to more important
matters&mdash;to leave you entirely free to depart alone as soon
as your business is completed&mdash;for I will be no further
hindrance to you.... Good-bye, and&mdash;as I do not think
I shall see you again&mdash;many thanks for bringing me here
in safety, and for setting me so high a standard and so
glorious an example...."</p>

<p class="first">
I do not know what I replied&mdash;nor what I did. I was
<i>all</i> French in that moment, and gave full rein to my
terrible emotion.</p>

<p>But I know that Mary Vanbrugh left the tent with the
cold words:</p>

<p>"Duty, Major de Beaujolais&mdash;before <i>everything!</i> We
will <i>both</i> do our Duty.... I shall tell the Emir el
Hamel el Kebir that I intend to remain here indefinitely,
under his protection, and that I hope he will give you
your precious treaty, and send you off at once.... My
conscience&mdash;awakened by you&mdash;will approve my doing what
<i>I</i> now see to be <i>my</i> duty.... Good-bye, Major de
Beaujolais...."</p>

<p>I sat for hours with my pistol in my hand, and I think
I may now claim to know what suffering <i>is....</i> Never
since that hour have I had a word of blame for the poor
soul who blows his brains out....</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
I saw no one else that day, but during the night I was
awakened from a fitful and nightmare-ridden doze by the
Hadji Abdul Salam.</p>

<p>Once more he rehearsed his proposals and warnings,
modified now by the elimination of Becque.</p>

<p>ONE: Would I, by his help, escape alone, immediately,
and return with a strong French force and make him France's
faithful (well-paid) vassal Emir Regent of the Great
Confederation? Or</p>

<p>TWO: Would I promise him a great bag of gold and my help
in his obtaining the Regency of the Confederation, if he
procured the death of the Emir at the hands of Suleiman
the Strong, and solemnly swore to poison the said Suleiman
at as early a date thereafter as convenient? (He could
not poison the Emir, for that distrustful man took all
precautions against such accidents.)</p>

<p>He fully warned me that by rejecting both his proposals
I should most certainly come to a painful and untimely
end, and my two women become <i>hareem</i> slaves. He was in a
position to state with certainty and truth that the Emir
had decided to kill me and the Arab-Egyptian, keep the
money, camels, weapons and other effects of both of us,
and then accept the earlier offer of the Great Sheikh el
Senussi and make an offensive and defensive alliance with
him.</p>

<p>I heard him out, on the chance that I might glean
something new.</p>

<p>When he had finished and I had replied with some
terseness, I pointed to the doorway and remarked:</p>

<p>"And now, Holy One, depart in peace, before I commit an
impiety. In other words&mdash;get out, you villainous, filthy,
treacherous dog, before I shoot you...."</p>

<p>The Hadji went, and as he crept from my tent, he ran
into the arms of the Sheikh el Habibka el Wazir&mdash;and I saw
him no more in this life, and do not expect to see him in
the next.</p>

<p>I heard that he fell ill and died shortly after. People
are apt to do so if they obstruct the ways of desert
Emirs.</p>

<p>I lay awake till dawn, probably the most anxious,
distracted, troubled man in Africa....</p>

<p>Mary Vanbrugh.... France.... My Service....
My uncle.... My Duty.... An outraged, unforgivably
insulted despot, a fierce, untrammelled tyrant whose
"honour" was his life&mdash;and in whose hands lay the fate of
the two women for whose safety I was responsible.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
Things came to a head the next night.</p>

<p>The Emir el Hamel el Kebir and the Sheikh el Habibka el
Wazir entered my tent, and, as though nothing had happened
to disturb the friendliest relationship, were cordially
pleasant.</p>

<p>Much too friendly methought, and, knowing Arabs as I do,
I could not suppress the feeling that their visit boded me
no good. I grew certain of it&mdash;and I was right.</p>

<p>After formal courtesies and the refusal of such
hospitalities as I could offer, the Emir said:</p>

<p>"Your Excellency has the successful accomplishment of
this mission much at heart?"</p>

<p>"It would be a fine thing for your people and pleasing
to mine," I replied. "Yes, I have it much at heart."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency has the welfare and happiness of the
Sitt Miriyam much at heart?" went on the sonorous voice.</p>

<p>Was there a mocking note in it?</p>

<p>"So much so that I value it more than the Treaty," I
replied.</p>

<p>"And the other night Your Excellency called me <i>dog</i> and
<i>swine,</i> and <i>filthy black devil,</i> I think," was the Emir's
next utterance.</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on, as I was silent. "Yes. And Your
Excellency has these matters much at heart. He admires this
fair woman greatly. Perhaps he loves her? <i>Possibly he
would even die for her?...</i>"</p>

<p>The Vizier watched the Emir, stroked his beard, and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency would achieve a great deed for
France?... But perhaps he loves France not so much that
he would die for her? Perhaps this woman is as his Faith,
since he is an Infidel?... Yes, perchance she <i>is</i> his
Faith?..."</p>

<p>The two men now stared at me with enigmatic eyes, cruel,
hard and unfathomable, the unreadable alien eyes of the
Oriental....</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, a contest of wills, a
dramatic struggle of personalities.</p>

<p>"<i>Are you prepared to die for your Faith?</i>" asked the
Emir&mdash;and I started as though stung. Where had I heard
those words before? Who had said them?</p>

<p><i>I</i> had. I had used those identical words to Becque
himself at St. Denis, years ago.... Well, perhaps I
could make a better showing than Becque had then done&mdash;as
much better as my cause was nobler.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> <i>am,</i>" I replied in the words of the dead man.</p>

<p>"<i>You shall,</i>" said the Emir, as I had said to
Becque&mdash;and I swear that as he said it, the Vizier's face
fell, and he smote his thigh in anger.... Was he my
friend?</p>

<p>"Listen," said the Emir. "These two women shall go free,
in honour and safety, on the day after Death has wiped out
the insults you have put upon me. After those words '<i>dog'
'son of a dog,' 'swine,' 'black-faced devil,'</i> I think that
we may not both live.... Nor would I slay with mine own
hand the man who comes in peace and eats my salt....
Speak <i>Roumi....</i>"</p>

<p>"What proof and assurance have I that you would keep
your word, Emir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"None whatever&mdash;save that I have given it," was the
reply. "It is known to all men who know me, that I
have never broken faith; never failed in promise or in
threat.... <i>If you die by your own hand to-night, your
white women are as free as air.</i> I, the Emir el Hamel el
Kebir, swear upon the Holy Q'ran and by the Beard of the
Prophet and the Sacred Names of God that I will deliver
the two Sitts, in perfect safety, wheresoever they would
be."</p>

<p>"And if I decline your kind suggestion that I should
commit suicide?" I sneered in my fear, misery and rage.</p>

<p>"Then you can slink away in safety; the signed Treaty
goes with you; the Sitt Miriyam enters the <i>hareem</i> of
the Sheikh el Habibka el Wazir; and the Sitt Moadi enters
mine...."</p>

<p>"You Son of Satan! You devilish dog&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"<i>Choose</i>&mdash;do not chatter," said the Emir.</p>

<p>Now my revolver was in its holster and my sword leant
against the tent-pole....</p>

<p>Let me think.... Kind God, let me think.... If
I could shoot both these dogs and the sentry who would
rush in&mdash;could I get the girls out of their beds and on to
camels and away&mdash;I, single-handed, against the bodyguard
of Soudanese, whose lines were not a hundred yards away,
and against the whole mob that would come running? Such
things were done in the kind of books that Maudie read, no
doubt.</p>

<p>No. I was utterly and hopelessly in the power of these
men. And what of the Treaty, if it <i>were</i> possible for us
to escape?</p>

<p>"Since you give your word that the Treaty shall be
signed and loyally kept, or, on the other hand, that the
two Sitts shall be escorted to safety&mdash;why not do these
wise and noble actions without sullying them with murder?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Do you not punish those who mortally insult <i>you?</i>"
asked the Emir.</p>

<p>"I fight them," I replied, and my heart gave a little
bound of hope as an idea occurred to me. "I fight them&mdash;I
do not murder them. Fight me to-morrow, Emir&mdash;and if I die,
let the Sitts go, taking the Treaty with them."</p>

<p>"And if <i>I</i> die?" asked the Emir.</p>

<p>"It will be the Hand of Allah," I replied. "It will be a
sign that you have done wrong. The Vizier must have orders
to see that we all go in safety, bearing the Treaty with
us."</p>

<p>The Emir smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"A <i>brave</i> man would fight me with the condition that
the Sitts go in any case and take the Treaty with them&mdash;and
that I go if I win," said I.</p>

<p>"I do not fight those who come to me in peace and
receive my hospitality," answered the Emir with his mocking
smile.</p>

<p>He was but playing with me, as the cat plays with the
mouse it is about to kill.</p>

<p>"No? You only murder them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Never," replied the Emir. "But I cannot prevent their
taking their own lives if they are bent upon it....
If you die to-night, the Sitts leave here to-morrow. You
<i>know</i> I speak the truth...."</p>

<p>I did. I rose, and my hand went slowly and reluctantly
to my holster. Life was very sweet&mdash;with Mary so near and
dear.</p>

<p>I grasped the butt of the weapon&mdash;and almost drew and
fired it, with one motion, into the smiling face of the
Emir. But that could lead to nothing but the worst. There
was no shadow of possibility of any appeal to force doing
anything but harm.</p>

<p>I drew my revolver, and the hands of the two Arabs moved
beneath their robes.</p>

<p>"Your pistol is unloaded," said the Sheikh, "but ours
are not."</p>

<p>I opened the breech of the weapon, and saw that the
cartridges had been extracted....</p>

<p class="first">
"Get on with the murder, noble Emir&mdash;true pattern of
chivalry and model of hospitality," I said, and added: "But
remember, if evil befalls the Sitts, never again shall
you fall asleep without my cold hand clutching you by the
throat&mdash;you disgrace to the name of man, Mussulman and
Arab.... You defiler of the Koran and enemy of God."</p>

<p>"If you mean that you wish to die that the Sitts may
go free, and my honour may be cleansed of insult..."
replied the Emir, and he softly clapped his hands, as the
Vizier angrily growled an oath in his beard.... <i>Was</i> he
my friend?...</p>

<p>The slave who was the Emir's constant attendant and whom
he called El R'Orab the Crow, stooped into the tent.</p>

<p>"Bring the cur and some water," said the Emir.</p>

<p>El R'Orab the Crow left the tent and soon returned,
leading a pariah-dog on a string, and carrying an
earthenware bowl of water.</p>

<p>Producing a phial from beneath his sash, the Vizier
poured what looked like milk into the bowl. The slave set
it before the dog, and retired from the tent. Evidently the
matter had been arranged beforehand....</p>

<p>As such dogs invariably do, this one gulped the water
greedily.</p>

<p>The imperturbable Arabs, chin on hand, watched.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the dog swallowed the last of the water,
when it sneezed, gave a kind of choking howl, staggered,
and fell.</p>

<p><i>In less than a minute it was dead.</i> I admit that it
seemed to die fairly painlessly.</p>

<p>I rose again, quickly produced the Treaty from the back
of my map-case, and got sealing-wax and matches from my
bag....</p>

<p>"<i>Sign the Treaty,</i>" I said, "<i>and let me go.</i>"...</p>

<p class="first">
The Emir, smiling scornfully, signed with my
fountain-pen, and sealed with a great old ring that bore
cabalistic designs and ancient Arabic lettering.</p>

<p>The Vizier, grinning cheerfully, witnessed the
signature&mdash;both making a jumbled mass of Arabic
scratchings which were their "marks" rather than legible
signatures.... I could understand the Emir's contempt,
but not the obvious joy of the Vizier.</p>

<p>Again the Emir clapped his hands. R'Orab the Crow
entered, and the dog and the bowl were removed.</p>

<p>"Bring us tea," said the Emir; and, returning, the
slave brought four steaming cups of mint tea, inevitable
accompaniment of any "ceremony."</p>

<p>Into one the Emir poured the remainder of the contents
of the phial and passed it to me.</p>

<p>"We would have drunk together," he said, "you drinking
that cup&mdash;and we would have wished prosperity and happiness
to the Sitts. '<i>May each marry the man she loves,</i>' we
would have said, and you would have died like a brave
man.... Now cast the poison on the ground, O Seller of
Women, and take this other cup. Drink tea with us&mdash;to the
prosperity of our alliance with France instead."</p>

<p>And beneath the smiling eyes of the Emir and the fierce
stare of the Vizier, I said in Arabic: "<i>The Treaty is
signed and witnessed, Emir!</i>" and in my own mother-tongue
I cried: "<i>Happiness to my Lady, and success to my
Country,</i>"and, rising to my feet, I drank off the poisoned
cup&mdash;clutched at my throat&mdash;tried to speak and choked...
remembered Suleiman the Strong and tried to tell the
Emir of his presence and his threat... choked...
choked... saw the tent, the lamp, the men, whirl round
me and dissolve&mdash;and knew I was falling, falling&mdash;falling
through interstellar space into Eternity&mdash;and, as I did so,
was aware that the two Arabs sprang to their feet....
Blind, and dying, I heard a woman scream.... I...</p>

<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p class="first">
<i>Thus abruptly ends the autobiography of Major Henri de
Beaujolais&mdash;which he began long after leaving the Great
Oasis and the society of the Emir el Hamel el Kebir and his
Wazir (or Vizier).</i></p>

<p><i>The abrupt ending of his literary labours, at the point
of so dramatic a crisis in his affairs, was not due to his
skill as a cunning writer, so much as to the skill of a
Riffian tribesman as a cunning sniper.</i></p>

<p><i>Major de Beaujolais, being guilty of the rashness
of writing in a tent, by the light of a lamp, paid the
penalty, and the said tribesman's bullet found its billet
in his wrist-watch and arm, distributing the works of the
former throughout the latter, and rendering him incapable
of wielding either pen or sword for a considerable
period....</i></p>

<p class="first">
<i>It happens, however, that the compiler of this book is
in a position to augment the memoirs of his friend, whom he
has called Henri de Beaujolais, and to shed some light upon
the puzzling situation. Paradoxically, the light came from

wicked lips completed the story, and it is hereinafter set

<h3>LOST</h3>

<p class="first">
Golden sand and copper sky; copper sky and golden sand;
and nothing else. Nothing to relieve the aching human eye,
in all that dreadful boundless waste of blistering earth
and burning heaven.</p>

<p>To the bright tireless eye of the vulture, an infinite
speck hung motionless in the empyreal heights of cosmic
space, was something else&mdash;the swaying, tottering, reeling
figure of a man.</p>

<p>The vulture watched and waited, knowing, either from
marvellous instinct or from more marvellous mental process,
that he would not have long to wait. As the man fell, the
predatory bird, with motionless wing, slid down the sky
in graceful circling swoop, and again hung motionless, a
little nearer to his quarry.</p>

<p>As the man rose, tottered on, staggered and again fell,
the vulture repeated its man&oelig;uvre, and again hung
motionless, nearer to its prey....</p>

<p class="first">
Would the still figure move again? Was it yet too feeble
to resist the onslaught of the fierce beak that should tear
the eyeballs from the living head?</p>

<p>The vulture dropped a few thousand feet lower....</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
With a groan, the recumbent man drew up his knees,
turned on his side, planted his hands on the hot sand, and,
after kneeling prone for a minute, struggled once more to
his feet, and bravely strove to climb the long billow of
soft loose sand that lay before him.</p>

<p>Beneath the hood of his dirty white <i>kafiyeh</i>
head-dress, bound round with <i>agal</i> ropes of camel-hair,
his dark face was that of a dead man&mdash;the eyes glazed, the
protruding tongue black, the cracked skin tight across the
jutting bones. Through the rags of his filthy <i>jellabia,</i>
his arms and shoulders showed lean and black; his bare
legs were those of a skeleton.... An Arab scarecrow, a
<i>khaiyul,</i> endowed with a spark of life.</p>

<p>At the top of the ridge the man swayed, put his hand
above his eyes, and peered out into the dancing heat-haze
ahead.</p>

<p>Burning sand and burning sky.... Not even a mirage to
give a faint hope that it might not be what it was&mdash;a last
added torture.</p>

<p>He sank to the ground....</p>

<p>An hour later the vulture did the same, and settled
himself, with huddled head and drooping wings, to continue
his patient watch with unwinking eye.</p>

<p>Anon he strutted toward the body, with clumsy gait,
and foolishly jerking head, his cruel hooked beak open in
anticipation.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
"Allah! What is that?... Look, brothers, something
white on yonder sand-hill&mdash;and a vulture...."</p>

<p>The speaker reined-in his camel and pointed, his
long-sighted gaze fixed on the far-distant spot where he
had seen something that to European eyes would have been
invisible.</p>

<p>Lowering his outstretched hand, he unslung his rifle as
the other Touareg came to a halt around him.</p>

<p>"A trap perchance," growled another of the Wolves of the
Desert, from behind the heavy blue veil that hid all but
his eyes. He was a huge man, more negroid of countenance
than the rest.</p>

<p>"Go, thou, and spring it then," said the leader; and the
score or so of raiders sat motionless on their camels while
the black-faced man rode off.</p>

<p>Cautiously scanning the terrain from the top of each
sand-hill, he circled round the motionless bundle of rags,
as the vulture flapped heavily away to alight at a safe and
convenient distance.</p>

<p>After a long and searching stare around him, the rider
approached the body, his ready rifle in both hands. He
brought the camel to its knees.</p>

<p>As he dismounted, the rest of the band rode toward the
spot. By the time they reached it, the scout had turned
the man upon his back and discovered that he was unarmed,
unprovided, foodless, waterless, and utterly valueless.
There was not so much as a rag of clothing that was worth
the trouble of removing.</p>

<p>"A miserable <i>miskeen</i> indeed," said the scout to the
leader of the band, as he rode up. "Not a <i>mitkal</i> on the
dog's carcase. Not even an empty purse...."</p>

<p>"Curse the son of Satan!" replied the leader, and
spat.</p>

<p>"There may be something on his camel, if we follow his
tracks back to where he left its carcase," observed a lean
and hawk-faced rogue, who was trying to force his beautiful
white <i>mehara</i> to tread upon the body.</p>

<p>"Yea, a sack of pearls, thou fool," agreed the leader,
and added: "Come on. Shall we waste the day chattering
around this carrion?"</p>

<p>As the band rode off, he of the negroid countenance
jumped on to his kneeling beast, and as it lurched to
its feet, he emitted a joyous whoop, and either in
light-hearted playfulness, or as a mark of his disgust at
the poverty of so poor a thing, he discharged his rifle at
the body. The body jerked and quivered, and, as the robber
rode off, it writhed over on to its face, to the annoyance
of the observant vulture.</p>

<p>Not a man of this band of mysterious blue-veiled
robbers, the terrible "Forgotten of God," looked round; and
all rode on as heartlessly indifferent to the dreadful fate
of this fellow desert-dweller, as if it might not well be
their own upon the morrow's morrow.</p>

<p>Life is very cheap in the desert.</p>

<h3>EL HAMEL</h3>

<p class="first">
Towards evening of the same day, a desert caravan
of semi-nomad Arabs&mdash;"peaceful" herdsmen, armed to the
teeth, and desiring to fight no foe of greater strength
than themselves, followed in the track of the Touareg
raiders.</p>

<p>At their head rode their aged Sheikh, a venerable
white-bearded gentleman, with the noble face of a Biblical
patriarch, and much of the philosophy, standards, ideals
and habits of such&mdash;a modern Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob.</p>

<p>Beside him rode an Esau, a hairy man, a mighty hunter
before the Lord. In his dark face was nothing noble, save
in so far as a look of forceful and ruthless determination
makes for nobility of countenance.</p>

<p>"Yea&mdash;of a surety are we safest in the very tracks of
these sons of Shaitan, these Forgotten of Allah&mdash;may they
burn in Gehennum," said the Sheikh to his companions,
and, turning on his camel, he looked back at the long and
straggling column whereon the bobbing rolling <i>bassourabs</i>
showed that prized and honoured women rode hidden from the
eyes of men.</p>

<p>"Thou art right, Wise One," replied the burly younger
man. "No bullet enters the hole made by another bullet,
and no knife nor spear strikes a bleeding wound. No other
raiding-party will follow this one, nor will these Enemies
of God turn about in their own tracks."</p>

<p>And it came to pass that as the sun began to set, and
the old Sheikh prepared to halt the caravan for the evening
<i>asha</i> prayer&mdash;when all would dismount, and, kneeling in
long lines behind their leader, would follow him in devout
supplication to Allah, their heads bowed to the sand in
the direction of Mecca&mdash;the eyes of his companion, called
Suleiman the Strong, fell upon the bundle of rags on the
distant sand-hill.</p>

<p>"By the Beard of the Prophet," he exclaimed, pointing.
"A man! And he may not be dead, or that vulture would be at
work."</p>

<p>"If it is one of the Forgotten of God he will soon be
dead," said the aged Sheikh, laying his hand upon the
silver hilt of the curved dagger that was stuck through
the front of the broad girdle bound about the long white
<i>jellabia</i> beneath his <i>burnous.</i></p>

<p>"Not too soon, let us hope, my father," growled
Suleiman.</p>

<p>"He may live long enough to suffer something of what my
brother suffered at Touareg hands, before his brave soul
went to the bosom of the Prophet.... May dogs defile the
graves of their grandfathers...."</p>

<p>The two rode to the spot where the man lay, followed
by several of the caravan guards, fighting-men armed with
flintlock guns, rifles, or long lances, and straight heavy
swords.</p>

<p>"He is no Touareg, but a victim of the Touareg," said
Suleiman, slipping down from his camel without stopping
to make it kneel. "See, they have shot him, and he with
scarcely any blood to flow...."</p>

<p>"He may not be dead even yet," he added, after placing
his ear to the man's heart and holding the bright blade
of his sword to the latter's nostrils. "He is only shot
through the shoulder.... Shall I cut his throat?"</p>

<p>"No. Give him water," replied the Sheikh, and crying,
"<i>Adar-ya-yan! Adar-ya-yan!</i>"to his camel, brought it to
its knees. "He who is merciful to the poor and needy is
acceptable to Allah."</p>

<p>"Go, one of you, for Hadji Abdul Salam," he added,
turning to the impassive fighting-men, who looked on with
calm indifference, viewing this evidence of desert tragedy,
this agony and death of a fellow-man, with as much interest
as they would the fall of a sparrow to the ground.</p>

<p>Is not "Here is a stranger&mdash;let us cut his throat" the
expression of a sound, safe and profitable principle?</p>

<p>Taking his goatskin water-bottle from where it hung at
the high peak of his saddle, the Sheikh untied the neck of
it, and dropped a little of the desert's most priceless and
precious treasure upon the black lips and tongue.</p>

<p>A fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind, and the fact
that this derelict was a Touareg victim gave him a claim
that he would otherwise not have had, and brought him
kindnesses he might not have received. Skeletons and dried
corpses of men are, in the desert, too common a sight to
warrant a second glance; wounded men are a burden; and
dying men will soon be dead.</p>

<p>Hadji Abdul Salam, a fat and (for an Arab) jolly rogue,
rode up from beside the camel that bore his two wives in
a gaily striped <i>bassourab</i> (or balloon-like tent), and,
putting on an air of wisdom, examined the body. He had a
great reputation in the Tribe, by reason of having cured
the Sheikh of a mortal sickness by the right use of a hair
of the Prophet's beard, a cup of water, in which was soaked
a paper bearing a very special extract from the Q'ran, and
the application of a very hot iron to the old gentleman's
stomach. He also had a most valuable prescription for
ophthalmia&mdash;muttering another Q'ranic extract seven times,
and spitting in the patient's eyes seven times after each
mutter.</p>

<p>This learned physician pronounced life extinct.</p>

<p>"Starved to death," he said. "Then died of thirst.
Whereafter he received a wound which killed him."</p>

<p>This bulletin satisfied all present, save, apparently,
the corpse, whose eyelids fluttered as the blackened tongue
moved feebly in a kind of lip-licking motion.</p>

<p>"But I have brought him back to life, as you see," the
good doctor promptly added, and his great reputation was
enhanced.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
And alive, just alive, the foundling proved to be.
Curiously, and inconsequently enough, and yet again
naturally enough, the old Sheikh set great store by the
recovery of the man whom he had saved.</p>

<p>Had he not thus thwarted the Touareg, undone what they
had done, plucked a brand from their burning, and was not
this human salvage his, and a record and proof of his
virtue? The Sheikh had reached an age at which proofs of
virtue may soon be wanted in the sight of Allah.</p>

<p>He had the sick and wounded man rolled up in <i>feloudji</i>
tent-coverings, splinted with tent-poles, and slung at the
side of a good <i>djemel</i> baggage-camel.</p>

<p>"See that the dog dies, you," whispered Suleiman the
Strong to the camel-man in charge of the <i>djemel,</i> as the
caravan moved on again, after the evening prayer had been
said. "If he be alive at the next halt, squeeze his throat
a little. On thy head be it."</p>

<p>Why add a burden and a useless mouth to a caravan
crossing a waterless desert?</p>

<p>A little later the Sheikh sent for this camel-man.
"See that this stranger lives," said he. "The succour of
the afflicted is pleasing to Allah the Compassionate, the
All-Merciful. On thy head be it."</p>

<p>Abdullah, the camel-man, felt that there was altogether
too much on his head; but the old Sheikh was still the
Sheikh, and he had better "hear his words" and put prudence
before pleasure. Abdullah was a good killer, and, like the
rest of us, enjoyed doing that which he could do well.</p>

<p>At the next halt, the foundling was still alive, and was
distinctly seen to swallow the water that was poured into
his mouth.</p>

<p>Suleiman the Strong looked at Abdullah el Jemmal, the
camel-man, and, with a decidedly unpleasant smile, touched
the hilt of his knife. The old Sheikh praised Abdullah, and
said it was well. Of this, Abdullah felt doubtful.</p>

<p>After some hours spent lying flat and still upon
the ground, the Unknown was certainly better. He drank
camel-milk and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>Doctor Abdul Salam also had time to give proper care and
attention to the man's wound.</p>

<p>He wrote a really potent quotation from the Q'ran upon a
piece of paper, and fixed it, with blood and saliva, just
where it would do most good&mdash;over the entry-hole of the
bullet.</p>

<p>As the bullet had passed right through the man's
shoulder, the good doctor confessed that he was really
only wasting time in probing for it with a pair of pliers
generally used for gun repairs&mdash;though this was, in a
manner of speaking, really a kind of gun-repair, as it
were.</p>

<p>Doctor Abdul Salam explained further to the old Sheikh,
as they fingered the rather large exit-hole, that he would
leave it open for a few days&mdash;in order that anything
in the nature of a devil might escape without let or
hindrance&mdash;and that then he would close it nicely with some
clay, should they be fortunate enough to find any at the
next oasis.</p>

<p>This, he explained, would effectually prevent the
entrance of anything in the nature of a devil, and so
the man really ought to be all right. And, in any case,
whatever Allah willed was obviously the will of Allah.
Quite so. <i>Inshallah.</i></p>

<p>The doctor thought the Sheikh was getting a bit senile,
to pursue a whim to this extreme&mdash;but if the Sheikh wished
to oblige Allah, the doctor wished to oblige the Sheikh.</p>

<p>After another long rest at the next halt, the Unknown
was again better&mdash;if his wound was worse. He drank <i>halib</i>
and water greedily, and looked about him. But if he could
use his eyes, he could not use his tongue, or else did not
understand what was said to him.</p>

<p>After each halt he grew a little stronger, and by the
time the tribe reached an oasis, he could totter about on
his feet, and wash his wound for himself.</p>

<p>The good <i>hakim,</i> Hadji Abdul Salam, however, washed
his hands&mdash;of the patient. He would take no further
responsibility for the fool, since he thought he knew
more about the treatment of gun-shot wounds than the
doctor did; and either could not, or would not, swallow
the doctor's words&mdash;written on wads of paper&mdash;precious
<i>hejabs,</i> warranted to exorcise all devils of sickness and
destruction.</p>

<p>Hearing the physician complain, Suleiman the Strong
bade him waste neither words nor skill, for as soon as the
Sheikh tired of his fancy, he himself intended to cure the
Unknown of all troubles, with complete finality. He had a
feeling against him, inexplicable but powerful.</p>

<p>And daily the Unknown grew in strength, and by the time
the caravan reached its destination, some weeks later,
the <i>qsar</i> of the Tribe, he could ride a camel, and could
almost fend for himself.</p>

<p>But his wound grew worse, and for months he seemed like
to die, for he could not get at the hole in his back,
whereas the flies could.</p>

<p>The Tribe called him "El Gherib," the Poor Stranger, and
"El Hamel," the Foundling, the Lost One, and waited for the
old Sheikh to tire of him.</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
But as the months went by, the old Sheikh's fancy seemed
to turn to infatuation, and, far from tiring of the man and
ceasing to interest himself in his existence, he cherished
and cared for him. When, eventually, he recovered, the
Sheikh raised him to prominence and importance.</p>

<p>El Hamel was he whom the Sheikh delighted to honour,
and Suleiman the Strong sharpened his knife and bided
his time&mdash;for the Sheikh was getting old, and his sole
surviving son was but a boy.</p>

<p>When the Sheikh was gathered to his fathers, the
stranger would die, for Suleiman would be Regent of the
Tribe.</p>

<p class="first">
Undeniably, however, El Hamel was a remarkable person.
In the first place, he was Afflicted of Allah and quite
dumb; in the second place, he was unbelievably skilful with
a rifle and with the throwing-knife; in the third place, he
was incredibly strong; in the fourth, he was a most notable
horseman and horse-master, even among Arab horsemen; in
the fifth, he was indubitably a far better doctor than the
<i>hakim</i> himself; and lastly, and most remarkable of all, he
was a magician&mdash;and a magician of power.</p>

<p>This wonderful great gift had come to light in this
wise. The Sheikh had lost his <i>djedouel,</i> his famous
amulet, a silver box wherein reposed a Hair of the Beard
of the Prophet, bought in Mecca for an enormous sum; as
well as an extremely holy and potent <i>hejab</i> or charm&mdash;a
knuckle-bone of one of the holiest <i>marabouts</i> who had ever
adorned this terrestrial sphere.</p>

<p>Surely no one could have sunk so low as to have stolen
so holy a thing from the Sheikh's own person, and so he
must have lost it. Gone it was, anyhow, and great was the
commotion throughout the big <i>douar</i> (encampment), and
great the rewards offered for its recovery....</p>

<p>On the seventh evening from the day of the loss, El
Hamel, that sad and silent man, sat, as usual, before the
little, low black tent that was his, and looked remote
and wise. Cross-legged, on his small striped carpet,
silent and inscrutable, he made a goatskin thong for his
sandal, and, anon, regarded Infinity and the doings of his
fellow-men.</p>

<p>A goat-herd slave-boy sat and watched him, one, Moussa
el R'Orab, Moussa the Crow.</p>

<p>Anon the old Sheikh, terribly upset by his loss, and
still more upset by the evil augury of such a loss,
strolled past the seated man who salaamed with deep
respect.</p>

<p>The Sheikh paused, turned, seated himself beside
his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and settled down for a good
<i>faddhl,</i> the meandering idle gossip so dear to his old
heart&mdash;as to that of most Arabs. And a gossip with this
fine-looking dignified man was particularly agreeable, as
the poor fellow's infirmity prevented his taking an active
part in it, and rendered him an accomplished listener.</p>

<p>The Sheikh talked on&mdash;about his loss; Suleiman the
Strong strolled up, accompanied by his good friend, Hadji
Abdul Salam, and from time to time various other prominent
citizens of this tent-city joined the growing circle of
listeners and respectful talkers.</p>

<p>It was the first time since the Sheikh's loss that the
evening <i>faddhl</i> had taken place outside the tent of El
Hamel, a thing that occurred fairly frequently....</p>

<p>The talk dragged on interminably, and the great full
moon rose and illuminated the oasis, and the groves of
date palms, the hundreds of low black goatskin and felt
camel-hair tents of various sizes, the flocks and herds of
goats and camels, the gossiping groups, the women at the
cooking-fires, the water-drawers at the <i>shaduf,</i> and wide
ring of watchful sentries.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dumb man raised both of his clenched fists
above his head, pointed to the moon, again to where the sun
had set, and then threw his open hands dramatically towards
the sky in an attitude of beseeching prayer.</p>

<p>Soon a mass of snow-white foam issued from his dumb lips
and flecked his black beard, and his eyes rolled back until
only the whites showed.</p>

<p>He looked terrible, and the Hadji Abdul Salam prepared
to become professional. The grave Arabs stared in awed
wonder at this manifestation of the work of <i>djinns,</i>
spirits, or devils, and a deep silence fell.</p>

<p>The man seemed to recover, put his hand behind him into
his tent, brought out a vessel of water, and drank.</p>

<p>He then stared with starting eyeballs at the ground
before his feet. All eyes followed his gaze....
Nothing... nothing but flat trodden sand, no scorpion,
snake, nor horn&eacute;d toad was there.</p>

<p>The dumb man made passes with his hands above the
spot at which he stared. He poured water on the ground,
as though pouring libations to the memory of departed
friends.</p>

<p>More passes, more pouring forth of water, more
impassioned gesticulations toward the unanswering sky&mdash;and
then&mdash;did their eyes deceive them? Or even as the man sat,
with eyes and hands strained beseechingly aloft, did a
gleam of silver show through the sand, and <i>did the lost
box of the Sheikh rise up through the earth at their very
feet,</i> before their very eyes, as they stared and stared
incredulous?</p>

<p>It did.</p>

<p>The large audience sat for seconds as though turned
to stone, and then a shudder ran through it, a gasping
sigh escaped it, and, as the old Sheikh's quivering hand
tentatively went out towards this magic thing, a great cry
went up, so that men came running.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
The Sheikh summoned up his undoubted courage and seized
the box firmly, fondled it, opened it, restored it to its
place in his bosom&mdash;and then turned and embraced the dumb
man as warmly and fervently as he had ever embraced his
favourite wife.</p>

<p>"Let him be addressed as <i>Sidi,</i> and let him be known
as '<i>the Magician</i>' henceforth," he said. "<i>The Dumb
Magician</i>&mdash;<i>the Gift of Allah,</i>" and again embracing the
Magician, he arose, cast a leathern bag of money into the
man's lap, heavy Turkish <i>medjidies</i>&mdash;and retired to pray
apart.</p>

<p>Tongues were loosened.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;there was no humbug about it. It was no conjuror's
trick."</p>

<p>"His hands were above his head, and his eyes fixed on
the sky when it happened."</p>

<p>"No, he had not flung the box there, nor had it been
flung from the dark tent by an accomplice. It had suddenly
appeared from below the sand and had quietly and steadily
risen up to the surface and lain there, while all men
watched."</p>

<p>"No, he had not buried it and then shoved it up with his
toe. His feet had never been off the carpet on which he
sat, and he had never once touched the sand from beneath
which the box had risen...."</p>

<p>It was a plain sheer miracle, worked in brilliant
moonlight before the eyes of all!...</p>

<p>The dumb man sat silent and still, with abstracted
gaze, while the rest broke into chattering, gesticulating
knots of bewildered men, arguing and shouting in wild
excitement.</p>

<p>He then prostrated himself in prayer, upon the site of
the miracle, his head upon the ground, and thus the awed
crowd left him.</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">
"Yea, brother," agreed Hadji Abdul Salam, as he and
Suleiman the Strong, followed at a respectful distance
by one, Moussa el R'Orab, Moussa the Crow, goat-herd and
admiring slave of El Hamel, walked away in the direction of
the tent of the former.</p>

<p>"It is, as thou sayest, time that he died."</p>

<p>"I will let that accursed dog Abdullah el Jemmal, the
camel-driver, know that unless this dumb devil and father
of devils dies before the next moon, it will be the last
moon that Abdullah sees," growled Suleiman, grinding his
teeth. Not for nothing was he known as El Ma'ian&mdash;he who
has the Evil Eye.</p>

<p>"He has marvellous powers, and the strength of ten,"
observed the <i>hakim.</i> "But there are draughts which are
more powerful than he.... A little something of which I
know, in his <i>cous-cous</i> or curds..."</p>

<p>"The cunning dog has a portion of all his cooked food
eaten by Moussa, the goat-boy, long before he tastes
it," was the moody reply. "The hungry Moussa eats right
willingly, knowing that none try to poison him who hath a
food-taster.... No, it is a task for Abdullah.... A
stab in the dark...."</p>

<p>"And what would the Sheikh do?" smiled the good
<i>hakim.</i></p>

<p>"Impale Abdullah, living, on a stake, after hearing my
evidence," replied Suleiman; "and thus shall we be rid of
two nuisances at one blow...."</p>

<p>The two gentlemen discussed the matter further, sitting
at the door of Abdul Salam's tent, and&mdash;while Moussa the
Crow, enthusiastic spy of El Hamel's, lay behind the tent
and listened, feigning sleep&mdash;Suleiman sounded his host as
to his willingness to consider a scheme, whereby their food
should disagree with both the Sheikh and the Dumb Magician
simultaneously, on the occasion of the next invitation
to eat, extended by the Sheikh to his now glorified
prot&eacute;g&eacute;. There would be no previous "tasting"
then.</p>

<p>But Suleiman the Strong quickly saw that he was going
too fast, and that he was proposing to Abdul Salam a risky
thing, the doing of a dangerous deed for which the <i>hakim</i>
saw no present reason, and in which he saw no personal
profit either. And as he distrusted the Hadji as much as
the Hadji distrusted him, Suleiman affected to be jesting,
and turned the conversation to the miracle, to which he
alluded as a rascally trick.</p>

<p>But it appeared that neither he nor the worthy doctor
could offer the slightest suggestion as to how the "trick"
was done, nor propound the vaguest outline of a theory in
elucidation of the mystery.</p>

<p>Nor could any man of the few scoffers who were among
the intimates, toadies, and followers of Suleiman the
Strong; and the remainder of the tribe believed in the Dumb
Magician to a man.</p>

<p class="first">
Nevertheless, there are those who, having beheld a
similar miracle in other parts of the world, say that the
miracle-worker excavates a hole at the required spot and
then fills it with some material that expands rapidly and
quickly when made wet&mdash;some such substance, for example, as
<i>bhoosa,</i> yeast, sawdust, grain, or bran.</p>

<p>They aver that the miracle-monger presses the substance
tightly together between four stones, covers it with a
layer of sand, places the object (which is to spring
miraculously out of the earth) upon the pressed expansive
material, and lightly covers all with dust, earth and sand.
The hour strikes, and soon after the material is wetted&mdash;up
comes the hidden object.</p>

<p>It is said that Mother Earth has been safely delivered
of many brazen gods in this wise, to the credit and
enrichment of their even more brazen priests.</p>

<p>But those who talk thus of expansive "material" are
obviously materialists, and certainly not of those to whom
miracles appeal....</p>

<p class="first">
That night Moussa el R'Orab had something to tell El
Hamel, the latter smiling gently as the boy spoke and
gesticulated.</p>

<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p class="first">
As the infatuation of the old Sheikh waxed, so did the
jealousy and wrath of El Ma'ian, known as Suleiman the
Strong; and it grew apparent to all men that the same
<i>qsar</i> could not much longer contain both him and El Hamel,
the Foundling, the Dumb Magician, the Given of Allah.</p>

<p>Even to the Sheikh it grew clear that one of them
must go; so truculent, surly, outrageous, did Suleiman
increasingly become; and the old man's heart was heavy
within him, for he loved his strong, wise Foundling, this
big man of dignity and strength and magic power, whom he
himself had found and saved; and he feared the forceful and
influential Suleiman.</p>

<p>But one of them must go, or there would be quarrels and
strife, parties and factions in that united tribe....</p>

<p>It was Suleiman the Strong who went....</p>

<p>And he nearly went by <i>sirath,</i> the bridge that spans
Hell....</p>

<p>One evening, the sullen brooding temper that seemed to
smoulder behind his cruel eyes, blazed up, and he was as
one possessed by <i>djinns.</i></p>

<p>The old Sheikh was standing by the lance (which, planted
before his tent, bore his <i>bairaq</i> or flag and ensign of
rule) talking to El Hamel and others of his favourites.</p>

<p>To him came Suleiman, a <i>mish'ab</i> camel-stick in his
hand, and a black sullen scowl on his face. He was followed
by fat and smiling Hadji Abdul Salam, Abdullah el Jemmal,
and certain others.</p>

<p>Thrusting into the circle of gravely conversing elders,
Suleiman confronted the Sheikh and poured forth a torrent
of indignant and minatory words, pointing as he did so at
the impassive, silent El Hamel&mdash;his outstretched shaking
hand almost touching the latter's face.</p>

<p>The Sheikh rebuked him sharply, and raised his hand to
point. "<i>Emshi!</i>" he snapped. "Go&mdash;thou growling dog&mdash;or by
the Beard of the Prophet..."</p>

<p>And then the impossible happened. For, even as
the venerable Sheikh uttered the word "Beard," the
jealousy-maddened Suleiman seized the long grey beard of
the Sheikh in his left hand, shook him to and fro, and
raised aloft his right hand, clutching the <i>mish'ab,</i> as
though about to strike!</p>

<p>But it was Sidi el Hamel who struck.</p>

<p>With incredible swiftness and terrible force, he smote
the impious madman with his clenched fist, and men gasped
in wonder as Suleiman the Strong reeled staggering back,
and fell, apparently dead.</p>

<p>"Bind him," stammered the Sheikh, almost speechless with
rage at the unbelievable, unforgivable insult. "I will have
him impaled, dead or alive..." and the old man trembled
with wrath and indignation.</p>

<p>Sidi el Hamel ventured to intervene. Touching his breast
and forehead, he salaamed to the Sheikh, joined his hands
in entreaty and then, stooping, seized Suleiman by the
arm, and partly dragging, partly carrying him, bore him to
where the women crowded round the <i>jalib</i> draw-well, and
the <i>darraja</i> roller creaked and groaned above the '<i>idda</i>
superstructure, as a harnessed camel hauled upon the
well-rope.</p>

<p>At the foot of a kind of palisade of split palm-trunks
that banked up the earth around the stone-built mouth of
the well, he flung the man down, and made signs to those
who had brought camel-ropes wherewith to bind him, that
they should secure him to the wooden wall.</p>

<p>Tearing off Suleiman's <i>burnous,</i> El Hamel raised him
to his feet, and held him upright while his outspread
arms were lashed to the tops of two posts, and his feet
secured to a stump by a stout cord that passed round it and
them....</p>

<p>What was the Magician about to do? Would he leave the
sacrilegious villain, the almost parricidal criminal to die
of starvation and thirst, or was he going to shoot the dog?
Men crowded round, with growls of indignant wrath, and the
women fled to the tents of their lords.</p>

<p>El Hamel dashed water, from a dug-out trough, in the
face of Suleiman, and waited. In a few minutes he recovered
his senses, opened his eyes, and stared about him. The
Magician stepped back several yards and motioned the
onlookers to stand aside. He drew his knife.</p>

<p>Ah! He was going to give an exhibition of
knife-throwing, to plant the dagger in the black heart
of the dog who had most foully insulted and outraged his
Chief and Master, Allah's representative to the Tribe,
the Prophet's Vicar upon earth, the Giver of Salt. It was
well.</p>

<p>The Sheikh approached and stood beside El Hamel. That
great man removed his <i>burnous,</i> balanced the dagger upon
his hand, and with a swift movement&mdash;threw.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by the sound of a swift intaking
of breath as the knife stuck and quivered, not in the broad
breast of Suleiman the Strong, but in the wood beside his
right ear.</p>

<p>El Hamel had missed for once! No matter&mdash;the more
torture for the foul Suleiman.</p>

<p>With a merry laugh, Hadji Abdul Salam tendered his own
knife that El Hamel might throw again.</p>

<p>"This one balances well, Sidi," said he.</p>

<p>El Hamel took the knife, balanced it upon the palm of
his great hand, and, with a lightning swoop of his huge
arm&mdash;threw.</p>

<p>The knife quivered&mdash;in wood; beside the left ear of
Suleiman the Strong.</p>

<p>Again there was the sound of swift intaking of breath,
and the good <i>hakim</i> giggled like a girl.</p>

<p>"Try again, my son, and may Allah guide thine arm," said
the Sheikh, and placed his great silver-hilted dagger in
the hand of El Hamel.</p>

<p>"Make an end, thou squinting, cross-eyed dumb dog,"
cried Suleiman the Strong, and stared hardily at his
slayer, though his face had taken on a sickly greenish
hue.</p>

<p>Once again the Magician poised the knife and his great
powerful body and&mdash;threw.</p>

<p>With a thud the heavy knife stuck in the post above
Suleiman's head, and all but touched it. The three knives
seemed to hold and frame his face in glistening metal. And
then it dawned upon the watchers that El Hamel was <i>not</i>
missing his mark, and all men marvelled. Suleiman the
Strong stood like a statue. Abdullah el Jemmal respectfully
tendered a long lean blade. A moment later it stood out
from beside the shoulder of Suleiman, its point buried in
wood, its blade an inch from his flesh....</p>

<p>Another stuck exactly opposite that.... A dozen
knives were offered to the thrower, and in as many minutes
stood in pairs on either side of the motionless man.</p>

<p>Suddenly he cried, "Enough! Make an end, in the Name of
Allah the Merciful, the Compassionate," and, as the thrower
raised another knife, he collapsed and hung forward,
fainting, in his bonds.</p>

<p>But El Hamel had heard from Moussa the Crow of plotted
poisonings and the encompassing of the death of the kindly
Sheikh by the vilest treachery and ingratitude.</p>

<p>Striding to the man, he again dashed water in his face,
and soon Suleiman the Strong was strong once more, and held
himself erect.</p>

<p>"Make an end, Sidi," he said. "In the Name of the
Prophet make an end."</p>

<p>"<i>As thou wouldest have made an end,</i>" screamed Moussa
el R'Orab, pointing&mdash;and Hadji Abdul Salam eyed the boy
sharply.</p>

<p>El Hamel pulled out the Sheikh's knife from where it
stuck above Suleiman's head, and Suleiman closed his eyes
and awaited the cutting of his throat.</p>

<p>El Hamel took the knife to where the old Sheikh stood,
and returned it to him, touching his forehead and breast as
he did so.</p>

<p>He then made the sign of a man putting a rifle to his
shoulder to fire it, and pointed to his tent, and Moussa
the Crow sped thither and brought him the fine Italian
magazine-rifle that the Sheikh had bestowed upon his
favourite.</p>

<p>Men smiled and nodded. So this was how Suleiman the
Strong was to die!</p>

<p>Throwing the rifle to his shoulder, El Hamel pointed it
at the face of Suleiman the Strong.</p>

<p>"Look upon thy death, thou dog," cried the Sheikh, and
Suleiman opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> make an end, Sidi," he begged, "in the Sacred
Names of God," and El Hamel fired rapidly five times.</p>

<p>Suleiman the Strong sank to the ground&mdash;untouched&mdash;the
cords that fastened his wrists severed against the posts,
and hanging idly.</p>

<p>El Hamel pointed out into the desert.</p>

<p>"Yea, go, thou dog," cried the old Sheikh. "Thou bitter
tentless dog, go forth and scavenge. With nothing that is
thine, begone within the hour...." And El Hamel nodded
in approval, drew his hand across his throat significantly,
and pointed again.</p>

<p>The feet of Suleiman the Strong were untied, and with
blows and curses he was driven to his tents.</p>

<p>When he departed, well within the allotted hour, he was
followed by a flight of stones, some of the best-aimed
of which came from the hand of the good physician, Abdul
Salam....</p>

<p>But Hadji Abdul Salam thereafter fancied that El Hamel
eyed him unduly, and perhaps more critically, than a
<i>mou'abbir,</i> a pious and learned man, should be eyed by a
desert Foundling....</p>

<p class="first">
And so the fame and honour of Sidi el Hamel, the
Magician, the Given of Allah, grew apace, and his standing
and importance in the tribe waxed with them.</p>

<p>More and more the Sheikh depended upon him, and more and
more the Sidi strove for the common weal.</p>

<p>He trained riflemen until a few were almost as skilful
as himself, many were as good as Marbruk ben Hassan, the
Lame, hitherto undisputed best shot of the Tribe, and
all (who possessed rifles) were far above the desert
average.</p>

<p>Dumb though he was, he also taught them, patiently and
slowly, how to attack unscathed, instead of charging wildly
into a hail of bullets.</p>

<p>After getting squads of fighting-men to lie in line,
flat upon the ground, he would make a few wriggle forward,
while the rest aimed their rifles at the imaginary foe; and
these halt and aim their rifles while yet others wriggled
forward; and so on.</p>

<p>He taught the enthusiastic and devoted fighting-men the
arts of volley-firing and fire-control. He made a whistle
of wood, like a short <i>quaita,</i> and gave signals with it,
standing afar off.</p>

<p>He taught selected leaders an elementary drill by
signals, and these taught their followers. He showed the
horsemen and camel-men many things that they did not know,
such as the treatment of ailments, and he scowled angrily
and dangerously upon any whom he found saddling a galled
beast and neglecting back-sores.</p>

<p>Hadji Abdul Salam, who knew nothing more than the
administering of <i>zarnikh,</i> an acid concoction, to
sick camels, and the muttering of charms over sick
horses, looked on with merry laughing face and unsmiling
eyes. El Hamel also cultivated the Sheikh's Soudanese
soldier-slaves, between whom and the Bedouin fighting-men
there is always jealousy, and made a small camel-corps of
them, a nucleus of the <i>&eacute;lite.</i></p>

<p>He also made smiling overtures to an aged wonder called
"Yakoub-who-goes-without-water" and his family. He and
his three ancient brothers were famous for their gift of
living, when others died, if lost in the waterless desert,
or on finding the waterhole dried up, at the end of a long
and terrible journey.</p>

<p>An ordinary man will make a <i>girba</i> of water last five
or six days in winter and three in summer, but Yakub and
his brothers would double the time&mdash;and, as a camel can
only carry four <i>girbas,</i> this is a valuable gift....
Later El Hamel made these men into a wonderful Desert
Intelligence Department, and, as poor old worthless
beggars, they hung about oases, <i>douars, qsars</i> and
desert camps, learning much and bringing invaluable
information....</p>

<h3>§ 7</h3>

<p class="first">
And when the day dawned, of which the old Sheikh feared
he would not see the night, he gathered his <i>ekhwan</i> and
elders and chief men of the Tribe about his couch, and bade
them regard the Sidi el Hamel as Regent of the tribe during
the many remaining years of the childhood and youth of his
son, and commanded that his <i>aba</i> should descend upon the
shoulders of the Sidi during the boy's minority.</p>

<p>Upon the Sidi's hand he placed his ring, graven with
the sacred seal, in token of his power, and lifting up his
voice he blessed him in the Name of Allah and of Mahomet
his Prophet, ending with the words, "<i>Rahmat ullahi
Allahim</i>&mdash;the peace of God be upon him."</p>

<p>And the first "Amen" was that of Hadji Abdul Salam.</p>

<p>A little later, the old man was gathered to his fathers,
and was buried with great honour and much mourning in the
<i>kouba</i> by the little mosque, which stood near the oasis
and <i>qsar,</i> the headquarters and dep&ocirc;t of this
semi-nomadic tribe.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards came the great fast of Ramzan, and
at the end of that weary month, and on the occasion of the
great feast that marked its termination, the Sidi (accepted
by all men as Sheikh Regent) worked a new and wondrous
miracle.</p>

<p>He worked it upon himself. For, as all stood awaiting
the appearance of the new moon of the next month, he strode
forth before them, and with upraised arms stretched out his
hands towards the horizon.</p>

<p>He then turned toward the watching, waiting assembly and
pointed to his mouth. What was about to happen? All stared
and wondered in silence.</p>

<p>The moon rose and in that instant the miracle was
worked. The dumb Sheikh, Sidi el Hamel, the Magician,
opened his mouth, and in deep sonorous voice intoned the
<i>shehada.</i></p>

<p>Across the vast silence of the desert and the
awe-stricken throng, rolled the solemn words, "<i>As hadu
illa Illaha ill Allah wa as hadu inna Mahommed an rasul
Allah,</i>" and, as he turned in the direction of the <i>kubla</i>
at Mecca and recited the <i>fatha,</i> the opening <i>sura</i> of the
Q'ran, the people fell upon their faces.</p>

<p><i>The Dumb had spoken.</i></p>

<p class="first">
Thereafter the Sheikh, Sidi el Hamel, spoke seldom
and briefly. He uttered only short orders, curt replies,
concise comments. It almost seemed as though speech hurt
him, and that his long silence&mdash;perhaps the silence of a
lifetime&mdash;caused his Arabic to be halting, like the speech
of a man who has sojourned in foreign parts for many years,
speaking not the language of his people once in all that
time.</p>

<p>But now that the miracle had come to pass and he could
speak, his rule and influence became yet more powerful;
and more easily he trained his fighting-men; rebuked
and punished evil-doers; gave orders and instruction in
agricultural industry, animal management, tribal policies,
and pursued his strange fads of health-preservation,
sanitation, care of domestic beasts, and justice to all
prisoners and captives, mercy to slaves, women, and other
animals.</p>

<p>Nor would he ever act as <i>Imam</i> and lead the prayers,
leaving that pious duty to Hadji Abdul Salam, who on such
occasions contrived to look as holy as Sidi Mohammed ben
Ali, the Reformer of Islam, in spite of his round, fat,
laughing face, sleepy narrow eyes and loose lips&mdash;for
was he not a <i>hadji,</i> a man who had made the <i>hadj,</i> the
journey to Mecca, the House of Allah?</p>

<p>Was he not a <i>zawia</i>-trained <i>khouan,</i> a holy man
indeed?</p>

<p>Who could doubt it, that heard his sonorous call to
prayer, "<i>Haya alla Salat! Haya alla falah!</i>"&mdash;and his
leading of the <i>fedjr, dhuhr, asr, mogreb</i> and <i>asha</i>
prayers at morning, midday, afternoon, sunset and night?</p>

<p>Who so fanatical a good Moslem as he, and so fierce
against the <i>Ahl Kitab</i>&mdash;the People of the Book (Jews and
Christians) and all other unmentionable <i>kafirs.</i></p>

<p>So good Hadji Abdul Salam, the <i>hakim,</i> was the chief
<i>imam,</i> and, making himself the Sheikh's shadow and echo,
aspired to be the Sheikh's <i>Wakil</i> and <i>Wazir.</i></p>

<h3>§ 8</h3>

<p class="first">
It was not very long before the value of the Sheikh el
Hamel's innovations was proven. One of his wonderful old
desert-men, Yakoub-who-can-live-without-water, arrived one
night on foot, his camel lying dead a day's journey to the
north-west, with news of the great Touareg band that made
this the southernmost point of its annual journey in search
of plunder.</p>

<p>If unresisted by the Tribe it would rest and feast
fatly at the expense of its unhappy hosts, set them to
pack camel-fodder, have the date-harvest loaded on to the
<i>hamla</i> baggage-camels of the Tribe, make a selection of
children, young men, and maidens, and depart with such of
the camels, horses, asses, goats, rugs, clothing, and money
as could not be previously removed or hidden.</p>

<p>Slaughter there might or might not be&mdash;probably not very
much, and that only in a quite playful spirit....</p>

<p>Wholesale flight was out of the question. What tribe
burdened with women and children, tents, property, goats,
asses, and slow <i>hamla</i> camels, can flee before an
unencumbered <i>harka</i> of fierce hawk-like robbers, mounted
on swift <i>mehari</i> that travel like the wind?</p>

<p>The Forgotten of God, the Blue-Veiled Silent Ones,
would leave all their previously gathered booty at a
dep&ocirc;t, guarded by their precious and faithful black
slaves (whom they breed on slave-farms, like cattle); and
their lightning raid upon the fleeing tribe would be like
that of eagles upon chickens. Moreover the extra trouble
given to these Lords of the Desert would not be easily
atoned....</p>

<p class="first">
The <i>ekhwan</i> gathered at the tent of the Sheikh el
Hamel, and each spoke his mind in turn, the oldest
first.</p>

<p>Some were for following ancient custom and leaving the
<i>douar</i> to unhindered plundering by the Touareg. The sooner
they got what they wanted, the sooner they would be gone.
The less they were thwarted, the less bloodthirsty would
they be. The very pick of the youths, girls, and children
might be sent off into the desert, with the very best of
the camels, horses, asses and goats&mdash;but not too many must
go, lest the Touareg wax suspicious and torture the elders
until someone break down and confess....</p>

<p>Some were for drawing up as imposing an array of armed
camel-men, horsemen and infantry as was possible, and
letting them hover near, in full view of the Touareg, in
the hope that, as sometimes happened, the robbers would
decide not to over-provoke so dangerous a force, but to rob
reasonably and justly, leaving the victims a fair residue
of their property, the bare means of subsistence, and many
of their young relatives.</p>

<p>One or two, including Marbruk ben Hassan the Lame,
showing that the Sheikh el Hamel's lessons in Minor Tactics
of War had borne fruit, actually wanted to put up a genuine
fight&mdash;receive the visitors with volleys of rifle-fire, and
if they did not succeed in driving them off, see the thing
through and die in defence of tent and child.</p>

<p>"And what of tent and child when you are dead?" inquired
the Sheikh el Hamel.</p>

<p>Marbruk ben Hassan the Lame shrugged his enormous
shoulders.</p>

<p>"What of them in any case, Sidi?" he asked. "Shall our
eyes behold their defilement or, closed in brave death, see
nothing of their shame and misery?"</p>

<p>"What says the good Hadji Abdul Salam, the Learned and
Holy One?" asked the Sheikh.</p>

<p>The Learned and Holy One thought it would be a sound
move for all the wealthy and important men of the
Tribe&mdash;themselves there present, in fact&mdash;to clear out for
a space, with all that was theirs. After a sojourn in the
desert, away to the south-east, they could return, console
the survivors, and help to clear up the mess....</p>

<p>It seemed sound sense to several aged patriarchs, who
had seen too much of the Touareg and his ways to have any
desire to see more.</p>

<p>"They cut off the hands of my little son and the feet
of my favourite wife," wailed one white-bearded ancient.
"Had I fled instead of fighting, they would have been alive
now...."</p>

<p>"Yea, Father," murmured Marbruk ben Hassan, "and the
little son would have been a grandfather and the fair woman
a toothless hag.... We die but once...."</p>

<p>And all having spoken and given the counsel that their
experience, their courage, their hope and their caution
prompted, the Sheikh el Hamel lifted up his voice and gave
decision.</p>

<p>"We will not flee," he said. "We will not send the best
of what is ours out into the desert. We will not leave the
Tribe and go afar off with what is ours. We will not make a
show of strength and watch the enemy while he robs us. We
will not defend the oasis...."</p>

<p>All stared in silence upon this enigmatical strong man,
the Sheikh Regent of the Tribe, the Sheikh Magician. "We
will go and find our enemy," he concluded, "and fall upon
him and destroy him utterly."</p>

<p>And in the silence that followed, Marbruk ben Hassan
fired his rifle into the air.</p>

<p>"<i>Wallahi!</i>" he cried. "Our Sheikh is a <i>man,</i> by
Allah!"</p>

<p>"We will leave not one of them alive to return and tell
the tale," said the Sheikh again.</p>

<p>"<i>Inshallah,</i>" murmured the <i>ekhwan</i> doubtfully, and the
Sheikh strode away, calling for the chosen leaders of the
fighting-men and the aged scout Yakoub, who should be their
guide.</p>

<p>To these he made a brief speech in short curt sentences,
and illustrated his meaning by the ancient method of the
writing-on-the-sand. Around a stone which represented the
Touareg camp he drew a circle with his knife and then a
smaller circle within it, and then another. And to each
leader-of-a-score he spoke in turn, each hearing his words,
smiling, and replying,</p>

<p>"<i>Hamdulillah!</i> It shall be so. <i>Inshallah!</i>"</p>

<p>An hour later these men, each followed by a score of
men for whom he also had drawn a writing-on-the-sand,
assembled at the north-west corner of the oasis and, led by
the Sheikh el Hamel and the ancient guide, rode forth in
orderly array by the light of the moon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c203" id="c203"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>EL HABIBKA</h3>

<p class="first">
Once again was it proven that attack is the best defence
and that an invaluable principle of strategy is expressed
in the apophthegm, "Put yourself in your enemy's place, and
think as he would think."</p>

<p>The Sheikh Magician was well aware that the Touareg
attacks at dawn, and therefore expects to be attacked at
dawn.</p>

<p>For this reason he attacked at evening, when
cooking-fires were alight, food being prepared, "tents"
being made with camel-rug and sage-bush, camels being fed
and watered at the <i>ghadir,</i> and all men busy.</p>

<p>Well aware, moreover, that the correct and
orthodox attack is a wild rush and a hack-and-stab
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, wherein mounted men expect to ride
down and overcome dismounted men, unprepared and at a
disadvantage, he made a most incorrect and unorthodox
attack, wherein a complete circle of hidden riflemen opened
fire and shot down an enemy who rushed about in great
excitement and in full view, as he prepared to receive the
said wild rush of mounted men&mdash;that never came.</p>

<p>Instead of this, an ever-closing circle of accurate
rifle-fire ringed them about, and offered no concentrated
body of foemen upon which they might charge.</p>

<p>Always many were firing while some were crawling
nearer.</p>

<p>Always many were crawling nearer while yet more were
firing.</p>

<p>And from every point of the compass came the thudding
bullets and the stealthily approaching men.</p>

<p>At which point of this unbroken circle should they rush?
Where was the great ring thickest&mdash;or thinnest?...
Nowhere.</p>

<p>From time to time a Targui brave, with a shout of
"<i>Follow me! Ul-Ul-Ul-Allah Akbar!</i>" would dash forward at
the head of a few swordsmen, toward some part of the ring
of fire, only to fall with his followers ere steel could be
blooded.</p>

<p>And, from point to point of the attack, rushed the
Sheikh Magician, and wherever he paused and emptied the
magazine of his rifle, men fell fast. He seemed to be
everywhere at once, and to see everything at a glance. He
both fought and led.</p>

<p>He alone kept to his feet, and scarcely a man of his
well-trained force raised more than his head from the
ground, even when wriggling forward a few yards that he
might fire again from behind bush or stone yet nearer to
the foe&mdash;silhouetted against his camp-fires or striving to
capture and mount his beast.</p>

<p>Thus no attacker shot his brother on the opposite side
of the circle, and no attacker suffered from the ill-aimed
fire of the Touareg who endeavoured to imitate the tactics
of their assailants.</p>

<p>When, here and there, an excited follower of the
Sheikh Magician, spurred by his presence to a desire
to distinguish himself, would kneel up to rise beside
his leader&mdash;he found himself flung back to earth and to
remembrance of the fact that his sole business was to
creep and shoot, to creep ever nearer and to shoot ever
straighter, until disciplined co-operative tactics defeated
uncoordinated effort, and the well-used rifle asserted
its superiority over the sword, the spear and the casual
gun.</p>

<p>And so the net drew tighter, the end came in sight, and
the cool brain of the Sheikh Magician triumphed over the
hot courage and tradition-bolstered invincibility of the
terrible Touareg.</p>

<p>Not till the battle was fairly won and the victory
inevitable, did human nature triumph over discipline, and
his followers, with a wild yell, rise as one man and rush
upon the doomed remnant of their foe.</p>

<p>And not till this moment did they sustain a
casualty....</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
As the moon looked down upon the scene of the battle,
and beheld the Sheikh's followers, drunk with joy,
intoxicated with the heady fumes of Victory, feasting and
rejoicing about the camp-fires that had been lighted by
their dead or captured foes, it saw a sight more horrible
than that presented by the corpse of any man slain in the
fight, more horrible than that of all the corpses piled
together, and they were many.</p>

<p>A man had been tortured. His torturers must have been
at their foul and ghastly work, even as the first shot was
fired by the encircling foe, for he was still incredibly
alive, although he had no face and was otherwise mutilated
beyond belief or description.</p>

<p>With his own rifle the Sheikh Magician put an end to
this defiled creature's sufferings, and then turned to
where the shouts of some of his followers indicated that
another victim of the bestial savagery of the Touareg had
been found.</p>

<p>This man, trussed like a fowl, had evidently been
awaiting his turn. He was untouched by knife, but almost
dead from starvation, thirst and cruel treatment.</p>

<p>Him, the Sheikh Magician made his own special care.
Perhaps he thought of the time when he himself had been
saved from death at the eleventh hour, and would mete out
to this apparently dying man the measure that had then been
his.</p>

<p>With his own hand he poured water from his own
<i>zemzi-mayah</i> upon the face and mouth of the Touareg's
prisoner, cut the cords that bound him, and chafed his
limbs. As he did so, his face was suffused with a fine
glow of humane and tender sympathy, adorned with a look
of brotherly love, and animated with a new and generous
fire.</p>

<p>Raising the body into a sitting posture, he put his
arms about it, and embraced it,&mdash;a Biblical picture of an
Eastern father holding the body of his dead son.</p>

<p>Beneath the mask of Arab dignity and gravity, a
repressed soul shone forth and sought brief expression in a
moment of wild emotionalism.</p>

<p>The moon has seen the fierce tigress paw her helpless
cub, the savage lion lick its wounded mate, the terrible
and appalling gorilla weep above its slaughtered brother,
and it beheld this fierce and blood-stained avenger sit
among the dead and croon nurse-like above this inanimate
salvage of the slaughter he had made.</p>

<p class="first">
Encamped near the scene of his victory&mdash;the bodies of
his foes given to the vulture and the jackal, the wounds
of his followers tended by his own hand&mdash;the Sheikh set
himself to win back to life the man whom he had saved from
the knife of the torturer.</p>

<p>Scores and scores slain, dozens yet dying, and this one
to be nursed back to life even as he himself had been; this
one to be dragged back from the portals of the House of the
Dead, to be snatched from the jaws of Death.</p>

<p>As he himself had done, the almost-dead man made a brave
struggle for life, and, one day, opened his eyes in staring
wonder upon his saviour.</p>

<p>The Sheikh laid his finger on the bloodless lips, sent
all men away, and remained long alone with his piece of
human salvage from the ocean of the desert, and its storm
of war....</p>

<p>They named him <i>El Nazil,</i> the Newcomer, and later <i>El
Habibka,</i> the Friend, as he became the chosen Friend of the
Sheikh.</p>

<p>And in honour of his incredible victory over the dread
Touareg, they gave the Sheikh el Hamel the name of <i>El
Kebir</i>&mdash;the Lion.</p>

<p class="first">
And even as the old Sheikh had delighted to honour his
foundling, El Hamel, the Gift of Allah, so did the Sheikh
Magician delight to honour him whom he had thus saved and
brought back to life.</p>

<p>When he and his fighting-men returned to the
oasis-encampment, to be welcomed by the heart-stirring
"<i>Ulla-la-een! Ulla-la-een!</i>"&mdash;the wild shrill trilling of
the women, who screamed aloud as they rattled forefingers
up and down against the teeth of their opened mouths&mdash;he
sat the man upon his right hand, decked him in clean robes
of respect, and with his own hand fed him, from time to
time, with tit-bits from his own savoury stew of goat.</p>

<p>The tribe saw that their great Sheikh, the Great
Magician, the Gift of Allah&mdash;yea, the Beloved of Allah
the Merciful, the Compassionate&mdash;delighted to honour
the Unknown, even as he himself had been honoured when
unknown; and the tribe realized that a great bond of
sympathy existed between the Sheikh and the Tentless One,
in that the latter was dumb, even as the Sheikh himself had
been!</p>

<p>Perhaps the Sheikh Magician would cure him of his
affliction, as he had miraculously cured himself?...</p>

<p class="first">
And gradually it was borne in upon all men that the
second Unknown had much else in common with their Great
Sheikh, for he too was a very remarkable magician, a
marvellous shot, a mighty horseman and horse-master, a
great physician, and a man of curious and wondrous skill
with his hands.</p>

<p>Like the Great Sheikh himself, the man knew that special
form of <i>rabah</i> in which the empty hand is clenched, the
thumb upon the first and second closed fingers, and a blow
is delivered by shooting forward the hand in a straight
line from the shoulder.</p>

<p>This was a very fine and terrible form of <i>rabah;</i> for
a man may thus be smitten senseless, and apparently dead,
by an unarmed smiter; or in a few minutes be beaten into
a blood-stained feeble wreck, with closed eyes, scattered
teeth, and horrid cuts and bruises.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Great Sheikh and this Foundling came of the
same tribe&mdash;some distant southern tribe of great skill in
war, great magic, great strength, and great wisdom?</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
Public attention was first drawn to the remarkable
powers of the Foundling, the Tentless One, by his calmly
and quietly producing cartridges from the ears of Marbruk
ben Hassan the Lame.</p>

<p>Marbruk was one of the best shots in the tribe&mdash;nearly
as good as the Great Sheikh himself&mdash;for he had wonderful
eyesight, and great strong hands, arms and shoulders.</p>

<p>Perhaps his terrible lameness led him to practise more
than most men with the rifle, the one weapon he could
use, since he could only hobble about like a half-crushed
spider.</p>

<p>One day, as the Sheikh and certain elders and leaders
of the fighting-men sat and <i>faddhled</i> before the
Sheikh's tent, this Marbruk sidled up, patted his loved
rifle, showed an empty pouch, and sighed that he had no
ammunition.</p>

<p>Promptly the Sheikh's favourite, the Foundling, rose,
and, thrusting forth his hand from beneath his <i>burnous,</i>
produced a cartridge from Marbruk's ear!</p>

<p>Men stared open-mouthed.</p>

<p>He produced another; and then one from the other ear!
Men gasped. Marbruk ben Hassan turned almost pale.</p>

<p>The Unknown took two more from beneath the camel-hair
ropes that bound Marbruk's <i>haik.</i> Marbruk sat down and
perspired, and an awed whisper of <i>Magic! Magic!</i> rose from
the gaping onlookers.</p>

<p>The Foundling concluded this astounding performance by
extending an empty hand and a bare arm&mdash;and extracting a
cartridge from the circumambient air!</p>

<p>He then resumed his seat beside the quite unperturbed
Sheikh, who smiled tolerantly as upon the creditable effort
of a promising beginner in the science and art of the
Magician.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
For long, El Habibka remained dumb, and when various of
the <i>ekhwan</i> asked the Sheikh Magician if he would not cure
him of his dumbness, the Sheikh replied that such was his
hope and his intention.</p>

<p>He explained further that El Habibka was of his own
Tribe, from the South; a tribe of men mighty in magic
and in fighting, in knowledge and in wisdom,&mdash;but much
afflicted by the Djinns of the Desert, jealous of the gifts
so richly bestowed by Allah, the commonest of all their
afflictions being this almost incurable dumbness which came
upon them permanently when sick almost unto death.</p>

<p>However the Sheikh had little doubt that he would be
able to work a cure in time.</p>

<p>When this was effected it would be found that El
Habibka's speech would be halting and strange, even as his
own had been since his recovery and return from the very
Gates of the House of Death.</p>

<p>He assured the <i>ekhwan</i> and the leaders-of-twenty, when
<i>faddhling</i> with them, that El Habibka would prove a very
tower of strength to the Tribe, wondrous wise in Council,
a lion in battle, the equivalent of ten wise elders and a
hundred warriors.</p>

<p>He also delighted in making El Habibka display his
astounding powers with the rifle, with the little-gun, with
the knife, and with a long thin cord at the end of which
was a slip-knot and loop; his superlative skill on the
back of the wildest stallion; his wonderful adroitness and
strength at <i>rabah;</i> and, above all, his magic.</p>

<p>And indeed the magic of El Habibka swiftly reduced the
open-mouthed, staring onlookers to awed wonder, leaving
them speechless, save for murmurs of "<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>" and
"<i>Bismillah!</i>"</p>

<p>The things he could do were unbelievable until actually
seen. Nor was he any less a physician than the Sheikh
Magician himself, for his first great cure, known to all
men, was followed by many.</p>

<p>This first instance was the saving of none other than
the daughter of the late Sheikh, the Sitt Leila Nakhla, the
"Beautiful Young Palm Tree," herself. She had been suddenly
possessed of a devil which had entered her head, causing
terrible pain and making the head feel as though it would
swell to bursting.</p>

<p>To avert this catastrophe, she had bound a stout copper
wire so tightly around her head, that it was buried in the
flesh. But this gave no relief. The Sitt Leila Nakhla had
then sent a message, praying that the Sheikh Magician would
come and exercise his wondrous art upon her, or she would
die.</p>

<p>If she did not die she would kill herself, for the pain
was unbearable and she had no sleep.</p>

<p>The old woman who brought the message prostrated herself
at the feet of the Sheikh el Hamel el Kebir,&mdash;as he sat
on his carpet before his tent and talked to the dumb El
Habibka in a low voice,&mdash;and implored him to cure the Sitt,
her mistress.</p>

<p>And the Sheikh had bidden El Habibka exercise his
magic. Nothing loth, that doctor of medicine and science
had followed old Bint Fatma to the tent of the Sitt Leila
Nakhla, where she lay dressed and adorned in her best, on
dyed rugs of camel-hair and soft cushions, awaiting the
coming of the Sheikh el Hamel el Kebir.</p>

<p>Seizing her hot hands, El Habibka had stared long into
her affrighted eyes.</p>

<p>He had then uttered strange sounds, as the dumb
sometimes do; and, with quick passes and snatches, had
removed from the girl's very brain&mdash;by way of her ears,
nostril, mouth and eyes respectively, a rusty buckle, a
pebble, a large splinter of wood, and, what was probably
the worst offender, a big and lusty beetle, kicking and
buzzing like the Devil, whose emissary it doubtless was.</p>

<p>The horror-stricken girl shrieked and almost fainted
away.</p>

<p>El Habibka then removed the tightly twisted wire, as
no longer necessary, and, presumably to ensure that the
breath of life should remain in her, placed his lips firmly
upon the girl's, moved them with a slight sound, and then
retired swiftly from the tent....</p>

<p>The Sitt Leila Nakhla never had another headache from
that hour, and the reputation of El Habibka grew daily.</p>

<p>Men wondered that the Sheikh el Hamel el Kebir was not
jealous, and that he did not slit the throat of one who
bade fair to eclipse him as a healer.</p>

<p>Yet far otherwise was it, for the Sheikh moved not
without El Habibka, and kept him ever at his side when,
after prayers, he sat and <i>faddhled</i> before his tent at the
hour of sunset, peace and food.</p>

<p>Few sang the praises of El Habibka louder than the pious
Hadji Abdul Salam, and none of those who wondered at this
fact knew of the Hadji's long and quiet talks with one
Abdullah el Jemmal, the camel-man, and the really tempting
suggestions that the Hadji made for the poor camel-man's
enrichment.</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">
The hope and expectation of the Sheikh el Hamel el
Kebir that his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, El Habibka, would
be restored to completest health and fullest enjoyment of
all his faculties, was fulfilled&mdash;with a strange dramatic
suddenness&mdash;for Allah suddenly gave him the gift of speech
that he might save the life of his preserver!</p>

<p>It happened thus.</p>

<p>One evening, the Sheikh el Hamel el Kebir, El Habibka,
the Hadji Abdul Salam, old Dawad Fetata, Marbruk ben
Hassan and others of the <i>ekhwan</i> and chief leaders of the
fighting-men had strolled beneath the palms of the oasis,
after the <i>mogh'reb</i> prayer by the little white mosque.</p>

<p>Casting their eyes over the irrigation-plots, green
with their crops of onions, radishes, bisset, pumpkins,
and barley; over the rows and piles of sand-bricks drying
in the sun; over the groups of women at the well, in
their long indigo-blue, scarlet or orange <i>tobhs</i>; over
the jostling, noisy, dust-raising flocks of goats at
the water-runnels and troughs, the chieftains strode
<i>faddhling.</i></p>

<p>Anon darkness fell, the group dissolved (savoury smells
of cooking being the solvent), and the Sheikh el Hamel
el Kebir returned to his tent, passing as he did so, one
before which the Sitt Leila Nakhla sat, with her young
brother and two black slave-girls&mdash;that she might see and
smile as usual at the Sheikh, when he went by.</p>

<p>The boy sprang up and ran to El Hamel, reaching up to
play with his big silver-hilted dagger in its curly-ended
silver sheath; and, with her soul in her eyes, the Sitt
smiled upon the great and splendid man as he knelt and
embraced the boy, the future Sheikh, of whom he was fond
and proud as a father.</p>

<p>From the door of his tent El Habibka watched the scene,
an enigmatic smile playing beneath his beard, and softening
his hard eyes as he studied the lovely Leila.</p>

<p>Suddenly he shouted three words in a strange tongue and
snatched at the belt of his <i>gandoura,</i> as an almost naked
man bounded from the black shadow of the palms, straight at
the back of the kneeling Sheikh&mdash;a long knife gleaming in
his right hand.</p>

<p>At the sound of El Habibka's cry&mdash;the words of which he
evidently understood&mdash;the Sheikh swung round, keeping his
body between the assailant and the child, but not rising to
his feet.</p>

<p>The girl sprang forward like a tigress; up flashed the
keen knife of the assassin, and the Sheikh's great fist
shot out and smote him terribly, below the breast-bone. As
he staggered back, El Habibka's pistol banged twice, and
only then the Sheikh rose to his feet.</p>

<p>But El Habibka had spoken, a dozen people had heard, and
the Sheikh had understood.</p>

<p>For the moment, this portent was forgotten, as the
overwrought girl threw herself upon the Sheikh's breast and
entwined her arms about his neck, the boy clung to him in
alarm, and men rushed up to seize the murderer.</p>

<p>Gently pushing the girl and child from him, the Sheikh
shouted that the assassin was not to be further injured,
just as El Habibka seized the wrist of Hadji Abdul Salam,
even as the point of that pious man's knife was entering
the murderer's neck at the very spot for the neat severing
of the jugular vein.</p>

<p>It was surprising with what force the Hadji struggled
to execute justice, and with what a remarkable twist El
Habibka caused him to drop his knife and yelp with pain.</p>

<p>It was almost as though the Hadji did not want the man
to be taken alive.</p>

<p>It was soon seen that El Habibka's two shots had
crippled and not killed; and that when the captive had
recovered from the Sheikh's terrible blow, he would be able
to give an account of himself. Or rather would be in a
condition to respond to treatment designed and applied with
a view to persuading him to do so.</p>

<p>And when water had been thrown over the man, and, tied
to a palm-tree behind the Sheikh's tent, he had been left
in the excellent care of El R'Orab the Crow&mdash;men's minds
were free to turn to the more wonderful, if less exciting,
event of the evening&mdash;the fact that El Habibka the Silent,
the Dumb, the Afflicted of Allah, had been the object of
the Mercy of Allah, and had been given speech that he might
save his master.</p>

<p>None slept that night, and great was the <i>faddhling</i>
round every fire&mdash;especially when the news spread that the
assassin had at length yielded to treatment and confessed
that he had been sent on his errand of death by the great
Emir, Mohammed Bishari bin Mustapha Korayim abd Rabu, at
the instance and plotting of one, Suleiman the Strong, now
his <i>Wazir, Wakil,</i> and Commander-in-Chief combined!</p>

<p class="first">
Curiously enough, the Sheikh el Hamel el Kebir did not
torture the assassin&mdash;either for the purpose of extracting
information from him or in punishment for his murderous
attempt.</p>

<p>The sight of certain magics, worked before his
astonished eyes by the Sheikh and by El Habibka, appeared
to convince him that confession would be good for his soul,
even more than the contemplation of preparations for his
painful and protracted physical dissolution.</p>

<p>And his story was interesting, particularly those
chapters of it that bore upon the professed intention of
the Emir Mohammed Bishari bin Mustapha Korayim abd Rabu
to assemble his army and make Suleiman the Strong the
tributary Sheikh of the Tribe from which he had been cast
forth, and to add the Tribe to the small confederation of
tribes which the Emir ruled....</p>

<p>As he began to gain strength and hope of life, the
hireling murderer grew more communicative, and under
the influence of magnanimous kindness, brain-shaking
exhibitions of magic, and the ever-present fear of ghastly
torture, became as ardently and earnestly the willing tool
of the Sheikh Magician, as he had been of Suleiman the
Strong, and the Emir to whom Suleiman had escaped.</p>

<p>Many and long were the councils held by the Sheikh, El
Habibka, wise old Dawad Fetata, Marbruk ben Hassan, and
the elect of the <i>ekhwan</i> and fighting-men; and after a
decision had been reached, a great <i>mejliss</i> was held, a
great public meeting, which was harangued in turn by the
wise men and the fighting-men of the Inner Council, while
the Sheikh gravely nodded approval of the eloquence of
each.</p>

<p>At the end of the meeting, the hitherto dumb El Habibka
arose, and in a voice creaking and rusty from disuse, and
with words halting, and sometimes almost incomprehensible,
cried aloud,</p>

<p>"<i>Hamdulillah! Hamdulillah! Ana mabsut! Ana mabsut!</i>"
and, having recited the <i>fatha</i> with wide-stretched arms,
he fell upon his face before the Sheikh, his body quivering
with sobs, or the wild hysterical laughter of a joy too
great to bear....</p>

<p>And the decision of the council approved by the
<i>mejliss</i> was that at the coming season of sowing, when all
the tribes scatter far and wide for the planting of barley
for the next year's food-crop, the Tribe should migrate and
travel steadily north-west toward that wonderful land where
there was known to be a hundred square miles of palm-trees
and of all green things, a land flowing with milk and
honey, Allah's own Paradise on earth....</p>

<p>It had always been toward the north-west that the Sheikh
had looked, and of the north-west that he had talked, night
after night, to the <i>faddhling</i> circle and to the eagerly
listening El Habibka.</p>

<p class="first">
Meanwhile, Yakoub-who-can-go-without-water and his
shrivelled colleagues disappeared, and none of them was
seen for many days. By the time the first of them returned,
much of the organizing work preparatory to the migration
had been completed, and the Tribe was almost ready for
another of its many moves.</p>

<p>This exodus, however, was to differ from former ones,
in that the Tribe was going to move as an army that is
accompanied by a big baggage-and-sutler train, instead of a
straggling mob of men, women and children, and their flocks
and herds.</p>

<p>Four drilled and disciplined Camel Corps, proceeding
as an advance-guard, two flank guards and a powerful
rearguard, were to form the sides of a mighty oblong;
and inside this oblong, the Tribe and its animals would
march, each family being responsible for its own beasts and
commissariat....</p>

<p>Great was the sound of the querns throughout the <i>qsar</i>
as the women of every tent laboured in pairs at the
grinding of barley-meal for the filling of the sacks for
the journey; and high rose the prices of pitch and <i>zeit</i>
oil, as leaky <i>girbas</i> were made water-tight.</p>

<p>Day-long and night-long was the making and sewing of
<i>khoorgs</i> for loads of dates and of camel-fodder, since
the Tribe would "live on the country" where it could, and
be self-supporting where it must, and every fighting-man's
date-fed trotting-camel eats a sack of dates a day.</p>

<p>It was a hard and busy time, but a spirit of
cheerfulness prevailed, for change is the salt of life,
and great was the trust reposed by the Tribe in their
wonderful Sheikh, so full of ideas, of organizing power,
and of energy; and in his trusted lieutenant El Habibka,
now Commander-in-Chief of the fighting-men.</p>

<p>It was felt that the Sheikh Regent would safely and
surely lead the Tribe to the conquest or occupation of
the Great Oasis, and that he who had defeated a great
Touareg <i>harka,</i> would defeat anybody who opposed their
passage....</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c204" id="c204"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE CONFEDERATION</h3>

<p class="first">
A few miles from the Pass of Bab-el-Haggar, Yoluba, the
black Wadai slave and fighting-man, nearly seven feet high,
and famed for long sight among desert men famous for their
long sight, sat side-ways on his camel that he might watch
the horizon to which all other backs were turned.</p>

<p>He was alone, far in the rear of the rear-guard, behind
which rode the Sheikh el Hamel el Kebir.</p>

<p>From time to time, Yoluba of the Strong Eyes would
halt and turn his camel about, the while he stared with
unwavering gaze along the broad track made by the migrating
Tribe.... Suddenly he whirled about, waved his long
<i>mish'ab</i> stick towards his camel's head, and sent it along
at its top pace, until he drew alongside the Sheikh.</p>

<p class="first">
"One comes," he said gutturally, from deep down in his
thick throat. "A small man on a big camel. In great haste.
It will be Yakoub-who-goes-without-water."</p>

<p>At an order from the Sheikh, the rear-guard halted,
turned about and deployed. Camels were <i>barraked</i> in
line, and behind each knelt a man, his loaded rifle
levelled.... A piece of drill introduced by the
Sheikh, and much enjoyed, when once grasped, by his
fighting-men....</p>

<p>Yakoub it proved to be, and with a tale of weight to
tell.</p>

<p>"Well done, thou good and faithful servant," quoth the
Sheikh, on hearing it. "Ten silver <i>medjidies</i> and the best
camel thou canst pick, if all go well.... And so the
great Emir will do even as I did unto the Touaregs, and
attack at the hour of camp-making, will he?"</p>

<p>"Ya, Sidi! But we will ring the camp about with rifles
and await him, <i>Inshallah!</i>" grinned Yakoub.</p>

<p>"We will do better than that, Father Yakoub," replied
the Sheikh, and sent three of his specially mounted
messengers to El Habibka commanding the advance-guard,
and to Marbruk ben Hassan and to Yussuf Latif Fetata,
commanding the flank-guards, respectively.</p>

<p>The orders were simple. The vast caravan was to push
on at its best pace through the deep dunes and vile loose
sand that was the only way&mdash;churned to fine dust by fifty
centuries of caravan-traffic in a rainless land&mdash;through
the pass between the Bab-el-Haggar rocks, a few miles of
precipitous out-crop over which camels could not go.</p>

<p>At the far side of the pass, the advance-guard and
flank-guards were to halt and await the coming of the
rear-guard, while the caravan pushed on.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
A few hours before sunset, the Pass of Bab-el-Haggar
was silent and apparently deserted, but a quarter of a
mile to the north-west of it the camels of an obviously
well-drilled Camel Corps were <i>barraked</i> in orderly lines,
in charge of camel-guards and sentries. On the distant
horizon, a mighty cloud of dust indicated the passing of a
vast concourse of men and beasts....</p>

<p>An hour before sunset, a typical Arab <i>harka</i> swept
like a torrent into the wide pass; hundreds and hundreds
of well-armed fighting-men on magnificent buff, grey, and
white camels.</p>

<p>At their head rode a splendid group, one of whom bore
a green silk flag on which was a crescent and the device
of the Lord of Many Tents, the Emir Mohammed Bishari bin
Mustapha Korayim abd Rabu, spiritual and temporal head of a
small, but growing, confederation of Bedouin tribes.</p>

<p>The pace of the beautiful camels of the Emir and his
Sheikhs dropped from a swift mile-eating trot to a slow
walk, as they reached the area of flour-like yielding
dust-dunes into which even the broad feet of camels sank
deeply. The setting sun shone blood-red upon rich silken
<i>caftan,</i> gay <i>kafiyeh</i> bound about with golden <i>agals,</i>
flowing <i>burnous</i> and coloured camel-rugs with dangling
tassels....</p>

<p>After their leaders, ploughed the mass of fighting-men,
brave as the lions of the desert and as undisciplined as
the apes of the rocks.</p>

<p>"The curse of Allah on this corner of Hell! It will
upset my plan," growled the Emir, an impatient man, as his
camel dragged one foot painfully after another through the
bottomless dust.</p>

<p>"There is no need for haste, Lord," replied Suleiman the
Strong, who rode beside him. "<i>Inshallah,</i> our ways will
humbly resemble those of Allah Himself this day, for is it
not written, '<i>Allah fleeth with wings of lead but striketh
with hands of iron</i>'?"</p>

<p>"This cursed pass will spoil my plans, I say," growled
the Emir again.</p>

<p>It did.</p>

<p>A curious long whistling sound was heard, like a
sustained note on a <i>quaita,</i> the Arab flute, and, as all
eyes were raised to the rocks that bounded and formed the
defile, a sudden crash of musketry followed, and the pass
became a shambles.</p>

<p>Many flogged their camels as though that would give them
wings or firm ground on which to tread. Many wheeled about,
to escape by the way they had come, making confusion worse
confounded.</p>

<p>Many attempted to <i>barrak</i> their camels and fire from
behind them at the well-concealed enemy, only to find that
their unprotected backs were turned to another foe.</p>

<p>"<i>Kismet,</i>" groaned the Emir, putting his hand to his
bleeding chest. "<i>El Mektub, Mektub</i>..." and fell from
his camel.</p>

<p>The man to whom he spoke, this Suleiman the Strong,
brought his camel to its knees and then lay flat, close
beside it, feigning death.</p>

<p>Wild, almost unaimed, discharging of rifles by fully
exposed men, replied but for a brief space to steady,
careful short-range shooting by men lying, with resting
rifles, behind rocks.</p>

<p>The inevitable end came quickly, and the Sheikh el Hamel
el Kebir was prompt to save life.</p>

<p>To the surprise of the vanquished, not a throat was cut;
and to each wounded man the same help was given that would
have been rendered by his son.</p>

<p>But the defeat was utter, bitter and irretrievable, for
not a rifle, a round of ammunition nor a camel remained to
the leaderless army of the confederation of tribes, lately
strong and arrogant in the mighty hand of the Emir Mohammed
Bishari bin Mustapha.</p>

<p class="first">
Well acquainted with the truth of <i>v&aelig; victis,</i> it
did not take the Sheikhs of the prisoners long to accept
the small change of plan whereby the confederated tribes
became attached to the Tribe, instead of the decimated
Tribe being attached to the confederated tribes.</p>

<p>Nor did they see any loss in exchanging the leadership
and rule of the Emir Mohammed Bishari bin Mustapha Korayim
abd Rabu for that of the Emir el Hamel el Kebir who had
conquered him in war; who had behaved with the noblest
magnanimity to the vanquished, in the very finest Arab
tradition, now more often honoured in the breach than
in the observance; and who was undoubtedly a great and
remarkable man, who might be relied upon to lead the
confederation from strength to strength, until it could
dwell in unmolested safety, making sure to each his own,
that he might reap where he had sown....</p>

<p>So the tribal Sheikhs gave hostages of their sons and
daughters and of their flocks and herds and treasure; and
the Sheikh el Hamel el Kebir became the Emir el Hamel el
Kebir, the Victorious and Blessed of Allah the Merciful,
the Compassionate.</p>

<p>His days now being filled with labours of military and
civil organization, the new Emir appointed El Habibka
to be Sheikh Regent of the Tribe, and brought joy upon
the <i>ekhwan</i> and fighting-men by promising that he would
himself dwell with the Tribe, and none other.</p>

<p>At a great <i>diffa</i> given in the new Emir's honour by
aged Dawad Fetata, the Sitt Leila Nakhla delighted to
honour him by waiting on him herself.</p>

<p>The Emir was conscious of the honour, but not of the
fact that the girl pressed to her own lips and breast, the
bowl from which he drank, and let none but herself touch it
in future....</p>

<p class="first">
Other nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, some in wisdom
and some in fear lest they be eaten up, sent envoys to the
Emir, proposing that they should join his confederation and
enjoy his countenance and protection, in return for tribute
and the services of fighting-men.</p>

<p>These he visited, accompanied by his famous Camel Corps
of men who drilled and man&oelig;uvred like the <i>Franzawi</i>
and other <i>Roumi</i> soldiers, and who were reported to be
invincible.</p>

<p>And slowly the great and growing confederation moved
north-westward to the fabled Great Oasis of a Hundred
Square Miles of Palm Trees and green grass, where the Emir
el Hamel el Kebir talked of a permanent <i>douar,</i> that the
Tribe might occupy the land and possess it, waxing mighty,
self-supporting agriculturists and herdsmen, strong and
safe, as being the centre and focus of a powerful tribal
alliance.</p>

<p>He even talked of the building of a walled city with a
protected caravan-market, a great <i>s&#363;q</i> that should
become famous beneath his shadow, and attract caravans
from the north laden with sugar, tea, cotton stuffs, soap,
needles, scent and sandal; from the south with ivory and
feathers and Soudanese "orphans"; from the east with
coffee from Arabia; and from the west with the products of
Nigeria, Lake Tchad and Timbuctu.... A walled city with
schools, mosques, <i>zaouias, serais, hammams, madressahs,</i>
and cool houses with beautiful gardens.... And the
<i>ekhwan</i> stroked their beards and smiled at the Emir's
pleasing fantasies....</p>

<p><i>Inshallah!...</i></p>

<p>And, as unto him that hath shall be given, more and more
power was given to the Emir el Hamel el Kebir, as more and
more Sheikhs sought his protection and countenance; and
his Confederation waxed like Jonah's gourd, until its fame
spread abroad in all the land, north, south, east, and
west.</p>

<p>In the north and west it attracted the attention of
certain deeply-interested Great Ones....</p>

<p class="first">
The first intimation that Fame had come to the Emir
took the shape of an overture from the great Lord of the
Senussi, who sent one of his most important Sheikhs,
escorted by an imposing retinue bearing gifts and greetings
and proposals for an offensive and defensive alliance, and
the exchange of hostages for its better observance.</p>

<p>In full <i>mejliss</i> assembled, the Emir listened to
the words of the Senussi emissary, and made suitable
replies.</p>

<p>After some weeks of intermittent conversations, much
<i>faddhling,</i> feasting and ceremonial drinking of mint
tea, the ambassadorial caravan departed, taking with it a
deep impression of the strength of the Confederation, the
wisdom and greatness of the Emir, gifts for the Lord of the
Senussi, and little else....</p>

<p>"The Emir would deeply consider of the matter, confer
with his tribal Sheikhs, and send his messengers, anon, to
Holy Kufra with his reply...."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c205" id="c205"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>A VOICE FROM THE PAST</h3>

<p class="first">
It was the prudent custom of the Emir el Hamel el Kebir
and his Vizier, the Sheikh el Habibka, to sit apart from
all men, that they might converse of high matters of state
in the completest privacy.</p>

<p>This they did upon a rug-strewn carpet, above which a
roof-canopy of felt was supported by four poles. At the
corners of an imaginary square, four Soudanese sentries,
a hundred yards each from the other and from their Lords,
watched that no man approached without invitation....</p>

<p>To them, seated thus one evening, there came the Emir's
faithful body-servant, R'Orab the Crow, escorting the aged
but tough and enduring chief of the scouts who formed the
Intelligence Department of the Emir.</p>

<p>The two men prostrated themselves, salaaming
reverently.</p>

<p>"Speak," said the Emir.</p>

<p>"Lord Shereef, thy servant,
Yakoub-who-goes-without-water, hath news for thine ear,"
announced El R'Orab.</p>

<p>"Speak," said the Emir to the ancient.</p>

<p>"Lord Kalipha, a small caravan comes. Its leaders are
strange men. One is an Egyptian or an Arab from Egypt.
He is of the great Al Azhar <i>Zaouia</i> of Cairo. The other
speaks and dresses as the Bedouin, but his ways are
strange.... The two speak together in a foreign tongue.
They seized me and made me their guide"&mdash;the old man
grinned toothlessly&mdash;"and I slept against the wall of their
tent for warmth and shelter from the wind&mdash;but their talk
was in a strange tongue. They have much money and their
servants are faithful. Their hired camel-men could not tell
me much. They were engaged at Siwah and have come by way of
Holy Kufra. They think it possible that the chief leader
is a <i>Roumi,</i> but he carries papers that great Sheikhs,
Emirs, Kaliphas, Shereefs and Rulers kiss and place against
their foreheads and their hearts.... It is said that
much honour was shown them at Siwa and also at Holy Kufra
by the Lord of the Senussi.... I left them at the last
water-hole, escaping by night upon my fast camel...."</p>

<p class="first">
Three days later two heavily-bearded strangers sat and
talked long and eloquently with the Emir el Hamel el Kebir
and his Vizier.</p>

<p>Most of the talking was done by a curious hybrid product
of modern civilization who had been a student of the great
Al Azhar University at Cairo, and of the Paris <i>Sorbonne</i>
as well. He had been an employee of the <i>Bureau Arabe</i> and
had sojourned in Algiers. He had resigned his post and
visited Constantinople, departing thence for Baghdad. The
wanderlust or some other lust had then taken him to Europe
once more.</p>

<p>All that he said was confirmed in terse speech by
his master, a man whom the Emir and his Vizier studied
more carefully than they did the voluble cosmopolitan
Arab-Egyptian.</p>

<p>And what he said was of deep interest&mdash;a thrilling and
intriguing story....</p>

<p>He told these simple desert chieftains of a Great
<i>Roumi</i> King of Kings, one clad in shining armour, who had
long since been moved by Allah, in a dream, to see the
error of his ways and to embrace the True Faith.... So
great was he that the very Father of the Faithful himself
had called him Brother and had invited him to Stamboul that
he might embrace him.... So great was he that, once
upon a time, the very walls of the Holy City of Jerusalem
were thrown down that he might enter, when he went there
on pilgrimage, using no common gate trodden by the feet of
common men.</p>

<p>The simple devout chieftains, much impressed, were too
deeply enthralled to talk&mdash;until the Emir, stroking his
beard, sought enlightenment as to what all this had to do
with him.</p>

<p>He received it.</p>

<p>Stirred by the knowledge that there is no God but God
and that Mahomet is his Prophet, and shocked by the sight
of Islam groaning in bondage&mdash;yea, beneath the heel of
the <i>Franzawi Roumi</i> here in Africa, this mighty King of
Kings was about to urge his Brother, the Father of the
Faithful, in Stamboul, to preach a <i>jehad,</i> a Holy War, for
the overthrow of all oppressors of Islam throughout the
world&mdash;and especially in Morocco, Algiers, Tunisia and the
countries adjacent....</p>

<p>And to all great Chieftains, Emirs, Sheikhs, Kaliphas,
Shereefs, Rulers, and leaders of Tribal Confederations,
he was sending word to be prepared for the Great Day of
Islam, the Day of the creation of the Pan-Islamic State
in Africa, and the utter overthrow and extermination of
the <i>Roumi....</i> Already the greatest Islamic power in
Africa, the Senussi, were pledged to obey orders from
Stamboul, and it was hoped and believed that the Emir el
Hamel el Kebir would attack the French when the Senussi
attacked the English in Egypt.... Meanwhile&mdash;gifts,
arms, money, promises...</p>

<p class="first">
This first audience being concluded, and orders having
been given for the pitching of a camp for the strangers'
caravan, the Emir el Hamel el Kebir and the Sheikh el
Habibka el Wazir stared long and thoughtfully into each
other's faces.</p>

<p>"D'you place him, Bud?" asked the Emir.</p>

<p>"Search me, Hank Sheikh," replied the Vizier, "but
I cert'nly seen him before.... He's got me guessin'
and he's got me rattled.... There's a catch in it
somewhere.... I'm real uneasy...."</p>

<p>The Emir smiled; a slow and thoughtful smile indeed.</p>

<p>"He's going to be a whole heap uneasier than you are,
Buddy boy.... Remember a sure-enough real thug, way
back at Tokotu when we was in the Legion?... Came to us
at Douargala with a draft from the Saida depot. The boys
allowed it was him, and him alone, started that big Saida
mutiny, though it was never brought home to him.... Same
game at Tokotu.... Always had plenty of money and spent
it on gettin' popular.... Reg'lar professional mutineer
and trouble-brewer... a spell-binder&mdash;and a real brave
man.... Get him?"</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"He had been in the French Cavalry, he said, and got
jailed for mutinying there too, and later, he joined the
Legion to carry on the good work.... He was on that
march with us from Tokotu to Zinderneuf&mdash;the place those
two bright boys burnt out and killed old Lejaune&mdash;and Old
Man Bojolly shot this guy with his empty revolver, and then
put him under arrest&mdash;for refusing to obey orders....
He tried to work up a mutiny again that time, and he very
nearly..."</p>

<p>"<i>Rastignac!</i>" cried the Vizier, and smote his thigh.
"<i>Rastignac the Mutineer!</i> Good for you, Hank Sheikh....
That's the guy! I knew I knowed him, the moment I set eyes
on him.... Had too many drinks out of the old crook not
to know him.... Used to wear a pointed beard and big
moustache waxed up like you would stick corks on the ends
for safety."</p>

<p>"You said it, Bud. It's Old Man Rastignac. And what in
hell is the stiff doing in <i>this</i> outfit, I want to know.
Last we saw of him, he was for General Court Martial and
the Penal Battalion."</p>

<p>"Doin'? Earnin' some dirty money again, I s'pose. From
the same purse too, I guess.... What'll we do with him,
Hank?"</p>

<p>"Teach him poker, Son, and get all he's got.... Think
he reckernized us any?"</p>

<p>"Not on your life. I watched him mighty careful. We was
clean shaven, those days, and he wore a hairy face....
That's why we seemed to know him and he didn't know
us.... <i>You</i> look more like an ole goat in a bush than
a soldier, behind that flowin' door-mat of whiskers....
'<i>Hank!</i>' Huh! Sure&mdash;<i>a Hank of Hair....</i> Gee!"</p>

<p>"And you, Buddy Bashaw, you look just <i>eggs</i>actly like
a monkey in a haystack.... You ain't a little Man with
a beard on him, Son&mdash;you're a Beard with a little man in
it...."</p>

<p>The two simple desert chieftains eyed each other
critically, their strong faces impassive, sardonic, hard;
their eyes enigmatic, inscrutable, faintly humorous
perhaps....</p>

<p>Sending for one Yussuf Latif Fetata, grandson of the
High Sheikh, Sidi Dawad Fetata, the Emir bade him bivouac
a company of the Camel Corps beside the camp of the
strangers, for their honour and protection, and to protect
them so effectually that not a man of the caravan left
their camp by day or by night. Their camels were to be
"minded" for them in the <i>fondouk,</i> their rifles were to be
taken from them to be cleaned and also "minded"; and daily
they were to receive ample rations and water&mdash;for that day
alone. (No man could leave the Great Oasis without swift
camels and a good supply of food and water.)</p>

<p>"On my head and my life be it, Sidi," salaamed young
Latif Fetata, and departed to see that the honoured
guests were also honoured (and strictly guarded)
prisoners....</p>

<p class="first">
But though they could not leave their spacious and
comfortable camp, others could enter it&mdash;others, that is to
say, who had authorized business there&mdash;and no one dreamed
of hindering that influential and pious priest, Hadji Abdul
Salam, chief <i>imam,</i> and spiritual head of his Tribe, from
paying a ceremonial visit of honour to the Emir's honoured
guests.</p>

<p>He paid many visits, in fact, which were not ceremonial
and in the course of which this prophet, who was not
without honour in his own country, showed that honour might
not be without profit also....</p>

<p>When a certain soldier, one Gharibeel Zarrug, a young
man who feared and reverenced the Hadji, and whom the
tongue of malice declared to be the Hadji's son, was on
sentry over the tents of the leaders of the expedition, the
pious Hadji visited them by night, and much curious and
interesting conversation ensued.</p>

<p>After one such heart-to-heart talk, and the departure
of Hadji Abdul Salam, the Egyptian-Arab, who affected
patent-leather dancing pumps, silk socks, scent,
hair-pomade and other European vices&mdash;and who yearned
exceedingly for a high stiff collar, frock-coat, <i>tarbush</i>
and the pavements of Paris&mdash;observed to his colleague and
employer:</p>

<p>"Might do worse.... He'd be ours, body and soul, both
for the money and because we should know too much....
If he killed this Emir and his jackal, or had them killed,
he would be the power behind the throne&mdash;until he was the
throne itself...."</p>

<p>"Yes.... Might do much worse," agreed the other
man. "He would be Regent for this boy that the Emir is
nursing&mdash;until the time came for the boy to die.... I
don't like this Emir.... He says too little and stares
too much.... He's a strong ruler, and no tool for
anybody.... And it's a <i>tool</i> we want here...."</p>

<p>"No. I don't like him either," agreed the other, "and he
doesn't like us or our proposals, I fancy. I have an idea
that the French were here before us. Do you think we are in
any danger?"</p>

<p>"<i>Great</i> danger, I should say," rejoined the leader, and
smiled mockingly at his companion, whose invaluable gifts
he knew to be rather those of the fox than of the lion.</p>

<p>"Then we must get down to real business with the
Hadji, the next time he comes," was the reply of the
Egyptian-Arab. "We shall have deserved well of our masters
if we do nothing more here than remove the Emir, a
potential enemy of great importance...."</p>

<p>"We shall do more than that," prophesied the other.</p>

<h3>MORE VOICES PROM THE PAST</h3>

<p class="first">
In pride, peace, prosperity and patience sat the Emir
el Hamel el Kebir upon the rugs and cushions of the carpet
of his pavilion, a few days later, splendidly arrayed,
exhaling dignity, benevolence, and lordship.</p>

<p>Beside him sat his almost equally resplendent Vizier,
known to all men as the Sheikh el Habibka el Wazir.</p>

<p>Between their bearded lips were the mouth-pieces of
their long-stemmed <i>narghilehs,</i> from which they inhaled
deep draughts of soothing smoke.</p>

<p>A man came running, halted, and prostrated himself.</p>

<p>"Speak, O El R'Orab the Crow," murmured the Emir.</p>

<p>"Lord," said the man, "the leader Marbruk ben Hassan has
returned, with none missing. He brings three prisoners, two
of them women. The man prisoner says he comes to the Emir
with messages from the Rulers of his Tribe."</p>

<p>"Go to the Hadji Abdul Salam and say that the Emir bids
him receive these people and offer them hospitality for
three days in the Guest-tents. '<i>Are not we all the guests
of Allah?</i>' saith The Book.... When they are rested and
refreshed, let him bring the man before me.... I have
spoken."</p>

<p>The Emir and the Vizier sat in silence, their eyes
resting on the pleasant view before them, a scene
beautified by feathery palms, green grass and running
water, on which rested the benediction of the setting
sun....</p>

<p>Anon men approached, in the midst of whom walked a
French officer in full uniform.</p>

<p>The Vizier's elbow pressed that of the Emir.</p>

<p>"Sunday pants of Holy Moses!" murmured the Vizier.
"<i>It's Old Man Bojolly!...</i> Run us down at last!"</p>

<p>"Game's up, Bud," murmured the Emir. "This is where we
get what's comin' to us...."</p>

<p>And with severe dignity, and calm faces of perhaps more
than Oriental inscrutability, they received the officer, in
open <i>mejliss</i> or durbar.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
After the return of the French officer to the
Guest-tent, the Emir and the Vizier sat cross-legged
upon their cushions, and gazed each upon the face of the
other.</p>

<p>"Well, Hank Sheikh, and what do you know about <i>that?</i>"
asked the Vizier of his Lord.</p>

<p>"Our name's mud," replied the Emir. "Our monicker's
up.... Old Man Boje and his '<i>great and peaceful
message!</i>'... Be more great than peaceful when his
troops arrive...."</p>

<p>"They say they always get you, in the end," reflected
the Vizier. "I wonder what force he's brought and where
he's left it?"</p>

<p>"That's what's puzzlin' me, Bud. I allow no
desert-column, nor camel-corpse, nor squadron of Spahis,
nor company of the Legion, could have got within three days
of here without us knowing it."</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Son Hank&mdash;if a gang of Touareg Bohunks
couldn't, French troops couldn't.... I s'pose it <i>is</i> us
he's after?"</p>

<p>"Who else?... It cert'nly isn't this Rastignac
guy.... Anyhow, we'll play Sheikhs till Hell pops, and
'see him and raise him' every time, Bud."</p>

<p>"You've said it, Hank. We got better poker-faces than
Old Man Bojolly, I allow.... But what'll we do if he
gets up in <i>mejliss</i> and says:</p>

<p>"<i>'I rise to remark I've come to fetch you two hoboes
outa this for deserters from the Foreign Legion on
reconnaissance duty in the face o' the enemy an' the Lord
ha' mercy on your sinful souls amen, and you better come
quiet or I'll stretch you and call up my Desert Column</i>,'
eh, Hank Sheikh?"</p>

<p>"Bluff him out and say he's got a touch o' the sun and
oughter turn teetotal.... If we can't talk anything
but Arabic we <i>can't</i> be deserters from the Foreign
Legion...."</p>

<p>"Or else tie him up in a neat parcel an' run him into
Egypt," he continued. "That's British Territory....
Sit on the walls o' Jerusalem an' sing <i>Yankee Doodle</i> to
him.... Jerusalem <i>is</i> in the Land of Egypt, ain't it,
Bud?"</p>

<p>"Yep.... House of Bondage and Children of Israel, an'
all that.... But we needn't vamoose any. We can turn the
Injuns loose on him, if he starts handing out the rough
stuff and is all for marchin' us to the calaboose in Zaguig
or somewhere.... Or let his old friend Rastignac get
him...."</p>

<p>"<i>Can</i> it, Buddy Bashaw. Cut it out. We don't turn
Injuns on to a lone white man, Son.... No, and we
don't set 'em up against Christian machine-guns nor
Civilized artillery either.... Not after they elected
us to Congress like this, and made me President and
all.... Put their last dollar on us for Clean Politics
and the People's Party, Monroe Doctrine and No Foreign
Entanglements.... No, I guess we gotta hit the high
places again, and hike. But shan't I laugh some <i>if he gets
Rastignac too</i>!"</p>

<p>"Gee! Ain't it the hard and frost-bitten pertater,
Hank Sheikh&mdash;after we been livin' so respectable?
Like a Hard-Shell Baptist Minister in a hard-boiled
shirt...."</p>

<p>"It surely would jar you, Buddy.... We had our ups
and downs, Son, and now we're booked for a down."</p>

<p>"Some tracking Ole Man Bojolly's done! He's a cute
cuss and the fierce go-getter.... He's got a nerve
too, to ride straight in here like a Texas Ranger into a
Mex village&mdash;an' I hand it to him, an' no ill-will....
But I'd certainly like to go and paste him one....
And me just thinking of marrying and settling down and
all...."</p>

<p>"'Nother thing gets me guessing, Bud.... What's he
brought the two girls here for? They ain't labelled <i>A
Present from Biskra... For a Bad Sheikh...</i> are
they?"</p>

<p>"No. He's French, Hank. Shockin' morals they've got&mdash;but
I don't see that it's any affair of ours if Bojolly travels
comfortable.... But if he does gather us in for the Oran
General Court-Martial an' we're sentenced to death, I shall
get my own back, sure."</p>

<p>"As how?"</p>

<p>"When he's finished his evidence, I shall say, quiet
like, but with all the nacheral dignity and weight of
Truth, '<i>Oh, you Rambunctious Ole Goat</i>,' I shall say&mdash;an'
leave it at that...."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;look at here, Son.... He hasn't showed his
hand yet. We've staked him to a hash-party to-night, an'
told him to bring the girls. We'll play light till Marbruk
ben Hassan comes in&mdash;I whispered to Marbruk to scout clever
and find out if there was an escort hiding anywhere&mdash;and
we know for sure whether there's French troops around.
And until there is&mdash;what we say <i>goes....</i> Gee! Ain't
it some world we live in? Major Bojolly and Rastignac the
Mutineer, both leavin' visitin'-cards on <i>us.</i> It's our At
Home day, Son Bud...."</p>

<p>"We'll be wishin' it was our Go Home day, before long,
Hank Sheikh," replied the Vizier. "Anyhow, we'll see that
Boje and Rastignac don't meet yet awhile."</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
That evening, after the feast and the departure of their
guests, the Emir and the Vizier observed a long silence,
each apparently respecting the feelings of the other. At
length the Vizier groaned.</p>

<p>"Can you beat it, Son?" quoth he. "Do I sleep? Do I
dream and is Visions about?... Bite me in the stomach if
I'm wrong, Hank Sheikh&mdash;but I believe I've been talking to
an honest-to-God, genuine, sure-enough American girl, and
held her hand in mine...."</p>

<p>"I'm dazed and weak, Bud," murmured the Emir, "but I
testify you certainly held her hand in yours. I thought it
<i>was</i> yours...."</p>

<p>"<i>It's goin' to be,</i>" pronounced the Vizier, with a
fervour of resolution. "It's goin' to be!" he repeated.
"Say, Son Hank&mdash;don't go and fall in love with that li'll
Peach, or I shall hand in my checks and wilt to the
bone-orchard.... <i>I'm in love,</i> Hank Sheikh, for the
first time in my life!..."</p>

<p>The Emir emitted a rumble of sarcastic laughter.</p>

<p>"Huh! And yesterday you were going to marry four Arab
Janes and settle down respectable!"</p>

<p>"That ain't <i>Love;</i> you old fool! Not by a jugful....
That's matterimony and respectability, instead of living
like a skylarking lone wolf.... Say, Hank, old Son, you
<i>ain't</i> goin' to fall in love with that li'll lovely Peach
yourself?"</p>

<p>"No, Bud, I am not.... But I'll rise to remark that
Old Man Bojolly <i>is....</i> Yep, sure thing! He's fallen
for that little looker, all-right."</p>

<p>The Vizier closed a useful-looking fist and shook it
above his head.</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" he ejaculated in a whispering shout. "He'd
come here to arrest us an' get us shot&mdash;<i>and</i> he'd
steal our girls from under our very noses too!... He
would?... I allow that's torn it!... Old Man Bojolly
better git up an' git.... Let's ride him outa town and
tell him to go while the goin's good!... B'Gees! <i>I</i>'ll
paste him one to-morrow.... Sheikh Hank, Son&mdash;I'm goin'
to propose to that sweet and lovely American girl, and
lay my heart and life and fortune at her feet.... She
wouldn't look at that dam' Wop then, sure<i>ly</i>?"</p>

<p>"He ain't a Wop. And you ain't got a fortune," replied
the Emir patiently.</p>

<p>"Well, he's French, an' that's the same as a Wop or
worse.... And I allow I'll dern soon rustle a fortune if
she'll have me."</p>

<p>"<i>That's</i> the spirit, Son! Good luck to you,
Buddy-boy&mdash;and I'll back you up. You court her gentle and
lovin' an' respectful an' I'll give you a character....
Time you had one too.... But we sure got to tell her
all about ourselves, Bud.... All the truth about us, so
there's no deception like...."</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Hank Sheikh, I wouldn't deceive her&mdash;not
for anything."</p>

<p>"No, Son.... I'll mention about those four Arab
Janes&mdash;just to show you got the serious marryin' mind, and
prob'ly been collectin' the sticks o' furniture for the
Home...."</p>

<p>"Cut out the funny-stuff, Hank Sheikh.... It's
fierce, ain't it? I got to talk this Arabic gargle while
Ole Boje gets away with it in English&mdash;and French&mdash;and
American too! How I'm goin' to lay my feelin's before her
in Arabic? She won't reckernize 'em fer the respeckful
love-stuff.... Hell!"</p>

<p>"You got away with it in Agades, Son.... You remember
that black Jane.... You was <i>dumb</i> then, too...."</p>

<p>"<i>Can</i> it, I tell you, you Hank, or you'll get my
goat.... This is different.... This is a girl that's
Real Folks.... You don't know what love is, you ugly
low-life old moron.... The laughter of fools is as the
cackling of prawns in a pot.... You never bin in love, I
tell you!"</p>

<p>"Me? Love? No. Sure.... What you know about Miss
Maudie Atkinson, Bud?"</p>

<p>"Some looker&mdash;if Miss Mary Vanbrugh wasn't there....
An' not bad fer British.... Yep, I'd surely have fallen
for her, if the American girl hadn't been there...."</p>

<p>"You certainly would, Bud.... Thou Fragrance of the
Pit!"</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;I got an idea, Buddy," continued the Emir. "S'pose
we could tell Miss Vanbrugh all about us, and say we
trust her not to tell Ole Boje until he springs it on us
himself?... I got a hunch he <i>ain't</i> after us, and don't
reckernize us either....</p>

<p>"If I'm wrong, he's got the best bluff and the best
poker-face on any man I met yet&mdash;an' we're innercent
children beside him.... Him an' his <i>great and peaceful
message!...</i> We'll wait until Marbruk comes back, an'
then we'll force Boje to a show-down.... <i>I</i> don't
believe the old fox is on to <i>us</i> at all...."</p>

<p>"Then what is he here for, Son?" asked the Vizier.</p>

<p>"You got me guessing, pard," was the reply, and the Emir
drained a glass of lemon-water without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Silence fell. The Emir and the Vizier sank deep into
thought. From time to time the solemn face of each was
lighted by a reminiscent smile.</p>

<p>"Say, Hank&mdash;didn't she just jolly us! I nearly bust
with laffin' when she sang that <i>Bul-bul Emir</i> stuff. Gee!
Isn't she a sweet Peach!... <i>Allahu Akbar</i>&mdash;she's a
<i>houri</i>!..."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;and that li'll British girl.... '<i>Oh, Sir,
ain't the big one a lovely man!</i>'... That's me, Buddy
Bashaw&mdash;and don't you forget it. <i>I</i> got that bokay!
It gave me the fantods that I couldn't back-chat with
her...."</p>

<p>"<i>Lovely man!...</i> Sufferin' Moses!" groaned the
Vizier. "You ever see a g'rilla, Hank?"</p>

<p>"And I'll tell you something else, Bud," observed the
Emir. "I got a hunch that Miss Mary Vanbrugh isn't such a
fool as you look.... What about if she was joshing us
<i>double?...</i>"</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"Women are funny things, Bud. They see further through
a brick wall than you can spit.... They got a sort of
second sight and sixth sense, worth all your cleverness,
Son. It's what they call..."</p>

<p>"Instink?" suggested the Vizier.</p>

<p>"Yup, an' something else.... Institootion?... No.
<i>Intooition.</i> That's it. An' I got a hunch Miss Vanbrugh
saw clean through us&mdash;and out the other side!"</p>

<p>"<i>Gee!...</i> Think she's put Bojolly wise&mdash;if he wasn't
already?"</p>

<p>"No.... No&mdash;I think not.... I allow she'd watch
and wait.... If we weren't planning any harm to Boje,
she'd plan no harm to us.... But I may be wrong. I
usually am...."</p>

<p>"Sure, Son," agreed the Vizier.</p>

<p>"I got to get Miss Vanbrugh alone to-morrow..." mused
the Emir....</p>

<p>"Me too. <i>Some,</i>" murmured the Vizier.</p>

<p>Two minds with but a single thought.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
The next morning the Emir, in the presence of the
Vizier, granted an interview to his latest visitor.</p>

<p class="first">
Thereafter the two rulers sat in council.</p>

<p>"I said it, Son! <i>I said it!</i> He don't know us from
Adam," said the Emir, as the French officer returned to his
tent.</p>

<p>"Nor hardly from Eve, in these dam' petticoats," agreed
the Vizier. "You <i>said</i> it, Professor&mdash;and I hand it to
you, Son.... Sunday pants of Holy Moses, <i>he ain't after
us at all! Inshallah!</i>"</p>

<p>"No, Judge, he ain't," replied the Emir. "We thought he
had come gunning for us with half the French army&mdash;and he's
come to bring us a million francs.... Can you beat it,
Colonel?"</p>

<p>"How much <i>is</i> that, Sheriff?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred thousand bucks, Senator.... <i>Some</i>
jack!"</p>

<p>"<i>Hamdulillah!</i> What'll we do with it, President?"</p>

<p>"Earn it, Governor. And do good with it."</p>

<p>"Good to <i>us,</i> too, Judge?"</p>

<p>"You said it, Colonel! We'll have our rake-off. The
labourer is worthy of his wad.... Says those very words
in the Bible...."</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Pastor. <i>Allahu Akbar!...</i> Yea, verily
the face of Allah the Merciful, the Compassionate, is
turned unto these, his servants; and Muhammed, his Prophet,
hath spoke up for us like a li'll man. Small prophets and
quick returns maketh the heart glad."</p>

<p>"Glad goes, Son," agreed the Emir, and the two sat sunk
in deep thought.</p>

<p>"We'll go riding this evening," said the Emir at length,
"You can ride with Miss Vanbrugh, and I'll take Miss
Atkinson.... But let me have a turn with Miss Vanbrugh
too&mdash;on the way back, say&mdash;and if she starts joshing,
I'll own up and confess&mdash;if it's plain she's called our
bluff.... An American girl won't queer the pitch for
two poor American men in a tight place and pulling off
a big deal, 'specially if they own up and put it to her
honest...."</p>

<p>"What about the li'll Britisher?" asked the Vizier. "By
the Beard of the Prophet she's all-wool-an'-a-yard-wide.
<i>She</i> wouldn't butt in an' spoil things. 'Specially when
Miss Vanbrugh had a talk with her.... Then I can say
my spiel to <i>her</i> in good old U.S.A. language&mdash;bye'n'
bye...."</p>

<p>"Yep&mdash;an' by the Beard of the Prophet <i>and</i> the Whiskers
of Moses I can talk some good he-talk to Miss Mary," agreed
the Vizier.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;but we gotta go careful, Bud.... We
don't wanta get lead instead of gold out of Ole Man
Bojolly.... And b'lieve me, Son, it's Miss Vanbrugh for
his&mdash;if she'll fall for him... <i>.</i>"</p>

<p>"I'll cut his throat first," growled the Vizier.</p>

<p>"Cut nothing, Son," replied the Emir. "You're always
falling in and out of love.... We aren't goin' to lose
two hundred thousand bucks and the chance of settin'
these Injuns up for life, just because you haven't got
self-control of your passions.... Old Man Boje has come
here in his innocence, wanting to give us a fortune&mdash;and we
aren't going to hinder him any.... If Miss Vanbrugh'll
have you, Bud, I'll be the happiest Sheikh of the
Sahara&mdash;and I'll do all I know to bring it off. And if she
won't have you, Son, you gotta take your gruel (<i>and</i> your
sack of gold dust!), an' that's all there is to it....
Get me, Steve?"</p>

<p>"I get you, Father.... But by the Ninety and Nine
Names of Allah, I'll sure plaster Old Boje till..."</p>

<p>"Cut it <i>out,</i> I say, you thug.... If she's in love
with Bojolly we gotta remember that all the rest of the
Universe don't matter a hill of beans to <i>her</i>&mdash;and the
kinder we treat <i>him,</i> the fairer she treats <i>us....</i>
So go in and win if you can&mdash;and keep a poker-face if you
can't...."</p>

<p>"Huh! <i>You</i> aren't in love, you perishin'
politician!"</p>

<p>"Nope? Well then, p'raps I'll have the clearer head to
steer us past the doors of the Oran Gaol and through those
of the Bank of France, oh, Sheikh el Habibka.... Thou
love-sick lallapaloozer."</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">
"And you really are perfectly certain that you can bluff
it through to the end, and that Major de Beaujolais won't
place you?" said Miss Mary Vanbrugh, as she and the Emir el
Kebir rode side by side in the desert.</p>

<p>"Certain sure," replied the Emir. "We've been bluffing
Arabs with our lives depending on it, and got away with
it.... It'll take more than a Frenchman to..."</p>

<p>"He's one of the cleverest men that ever lived,"
interrupted the girl.</p>

<p>"Sure thing," agreed the Emir. "But he isn't an Arab.
Why should he suspect anything wrong when he sees the
Bedouin taking us as Bedouin? It wouldn't enter his head.
It isn't as though he was looking for European or American
crooks, or ever dreamt there was any about. I may tell you
there's another Frenchman here too, who has lived in the
same barrack-room with us! <i>He</i> hasn't an idea we're not
Arabs!"</p>

<p>"How you did it, I don't know."</p>

<p>"Easy enough. Buddy and I were wandering in the Sahara
for years&mdash;with a couple of bright boys, and with our eyes
and ears open. We stayed dumb but we learnt a lot.</p>

<p>"Then I got lost, and this Tribe picked me up&mdash;with one
foot in Heaven and the other twitching feeble but full of
hope.... I stayed dumb until I surely knew Arabic better
than American.... Got it from a three-year-old kid
mostly. As he learnt to talk so did I.... Then I did a
miracle on myself and came undumb. Even then I never said
a sentence nor a word that I hadn't heard and learnt by
heart. It was easy as fallin' off a log.</p>

<p>"The poor Injuns thought I was from a strange tribe, if
they thought anything at all, when my pronunciation was
funny, or I hadn't got quite the right religious dope. But
I wasn't far out anyway, for I'd been studying that like
Hell&mdash;for years."</p>

<p>"Your life must have hung by a thread at times."</p>

<p>"Well, it never hung by a palm-fibre rope, Miss Mary
Vanbrugh, which is what it deserved," and the Emir
smiled.</p>

<p>"And does still," replied the girl.... "And where did
you pick your friend up?"</p>

<p>"What, Buddy? Why, he and I have been friends since
I was a road-kid. We've been soldiers, sailors, hoboes,
cow-boys, hoss-wranglers, miners, lumber-jacks, Wild West
Showmen, conjurors, Foreign Legendaries and Sheikhs....
When I got lost in the desert, he got away to safety&mdash;and
what you think he did? Rustled some camels and a nigger,
and <i>come back to look for me,</i> right where he'd nearly
died himself.... And when I got sort of top-sergeant
there, I uster send scouts all round that same country to
see if they could get news of another poor Bedouin picked
up there like I was....</p>

<p>"I never did&mdash;but I got news of a gang of Touareg who'd
come up that way.... They'd got him&mdash;and I got them,
good and plenty and just in time."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man is he? He has certainly got good
taste, for he gives me the eye of warm approval....
Virtuous?"</p>

<p>"No. He isn't what I'd call that. I allow he's broken
all the Commandments and looks to do it again.... No, he
hasn't got any virtues that I know of, 'cept courage, and
loyalty, and gratitude, and reliability....</p>

<p>"There isn't much to Buddy beyond that he's braver
than any lion&mdash;for a lion hasn't got imagination&mdash;and
that he never did a mean thing in his life nor went back
on his word or his pal. No. He's only got a fine head and
a great heart, and doesn't know the meaning of the words
fear, despair, failure, selfishness, nor any kind of
meanness.... Just an 'ornery cuss.'..."</p>

<p>"You want me to like him, I see..." smiled the girl,
"so you damn him with faint praise. He sounds very like a
man to me."</p>

<p>"No, I'm praising him with faint damns like 'ornery
cuss.'... You see, I'm one myself, and so Bud and me
suits.... As to your liking him&mdash;you couldn't help
that&mdash;but it would be a dark day for me if you married him
an' took-him-home-to-Mother...."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Mr. Emir!... What would happen if
you two fell in love with the same girl?" asked Mary
Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>"Poor girl would be left a widow like, before she was
married. I wouldn't butt in on Bud and Bud wouldn't butt in
on me... <i>.</i>"</p>

<p>"And how long do you plan to stay in on this Sheikh
game?"</p>

<p>"Till the lill' kid's ready to come into the business
and sit on his father's stool. I promised his old Dad I'd
see the boy through teething and high-school.... There's
one or two sharks want his job."</p>

<p>"And will your friend stay here with you?"</p>

<p>"Sure.... Unless you take him away, Miss Mary
Vanbrugh."</p>

<p>"Keep a stout and hopeful heart, Mr. Emir."</p>

<p>"Or unless Major D. Bojol<i>lay</i> takes us both away in the
middle of a camel-corps of <i>goums</i> and things...."</p>

<p>"Why should he want to do that?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't <i>want</i> to, but it would be his painful
'Duty'&mdash;when it came out that we were swindlers and
Americans, a big man and a little man, the same being
wanted for departing from the Legion.... They'd prove
it on us too, as soon as they got our whiskers off. So if
you get mad with us any time, and tell him&mdash;it's us for big
trouble...."</p>

<p>"It's the very last thing in the world I'd tell
him&mdash;if you were my worst enemies.... I'd give
<i>anything in the world</i> for him to bring off this Treaty
successfully....</p>

<p>"If you only knew what it <i>means</i> to him!... He has
spent his life&mdash;and as hard a life as yours has been&mdash;in
fitting himself for just such a stroke as this. It's not
for himself either&mdash;it's for France.... He thinks of
<i>nothing</i> but France&mdash;and Duty....</p>

<p>"It's his one longing, to feel that he has <i>done</i>
something for France, and that his labour hasn't
been wasted.... His uncle is Commander-in-Chief
and Governor-General and he's almost God to Major de
Beaujolais. I think he'd value a pat on the back from
the old man more than the Grand Cross of the Legion of
Honour....</p>

<p>"How did you come to know the Major?" asked the girl
suddenly.</p>

<p>"He was mule-walloping with a detachment of the Foreign
Legion."</p>

<p>"And you actually served under him?"</p>

<p>"We did."</p>

<p>"How jolly&mdash;as they say in England."</p>

<p>"Yup. <i>Beau</i>-jolais&mdash;as they say in France."</p>

<p>"I wonder he doesn't recognize you."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we were clean-shaven in those days. A doormat of
whiskers and a <i>kafiyeh</i> make a lot of difference....
He might, yet&mdash;but people generally only see what they're
looking for...."</p>

<p>"It must be splendid to serve under him," said the
girl.</p>

<p>"We hid our joy," replied the Emir. "We even tore
ourselves away...."</p>

<p>"And of course you'll make this Treaty?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Why not? Provided there's no 'peaceful
penetration' nor the Blessings of Civilization, I'll make
it.... France protects us, and <i>we</i> keep this end o' the
Sahara quiet and healthy. We get a rake-off from France,
an' we wax rich and prosperous because the caravan-roads
and trade-routes'll be kept open and peaceful...."</p>

<p>"You mean you and your friend will get rich?" asked Miss
Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>"I surely hope we make our modest pile.... We aren't
in the Sheikh business solely for our health. But what I
meant was that these Injuns should prosper and get a bit
in the bank. I'd like to hand over the whole outfit as a
going concern when the young Sheikh's old enough.... And
I'd like to be one of the few white men who have left the
native better than he found him. It's a plumb silly idea of
mine...."</p>

<p>"You want to 'make two blades of grass grow where one
grew before'?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;not so much grass, as <i>loobiyeh.</i> It's better
grazing."</p>

<p>They approached the outlying palms of their corner of
the Oasis.</p>

<p>"It's a bargain, then, Mr. Parlour-Sheikh," said the
girl. "You'll do your utmost to keep Major de Beaujolais
thinking you two are real Arabs, and you'll make the Treaty
with him and see that it is kept&mdash;and I'll do my best for
you...."</p>

<p>"Sure. I'd sooner face a sack of gold twenty-franc
pieces than a firing squad, any day, Miss Mary
Vanbrugh.... There's everything to gain for everybody on
the one hand, and everything to lose for everybody on the
other...."</p>

<p>"There certainly is, including your beloved Arabs,
remember... I shall be just a tiny bit anxious until
we're away again, but, oh, I do enjoy seeing you two solemn
boys playing Sheikhs!"</p>

<p>"<i>Bismillah arahman arahmin. En nahs teyibin hena,</i>"
boomed the Emir el Hamel el Kebir, as they neared the
tents.</p>

<p>"Why certainly," replied Miss Vanbrugh. "You've said it,
Mr. Emir&mdash;whatever it is...."</p>

<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p class="first">
At eventide, the Sheikh el Habibka el Wazir was dining
with his lord, the Emir el Hamel el Kebir, as usual.</p>

<p>In sonorous Arabic these grave men discussed matters
of importance to the <i>haute politique</i> of the Tribal
Confederacy&mdash;until the servants had removed the tray of
bowls, and brought the earthern cups of black coffee and
the long <i>narghilehs.</i></p>

<p>As soon as they were alone, they ceased to express their
thoughts in the ancient tongue of the followers of the
Prophet.</p>

<p>The Emir, smiling broadly, nodded his head.</p>

<p>"I was right, Son," he said. "Soon as we were alone,
I turned a hose of Arabic on to Miss Mary Vanbrugh&mdash;best
Arabic I ever shot; real Hot Dog.... What did she reply?
Tell me that, O Father of Lies and Son of a Gun....
'<i>Cut it out, Bo</i>,' says she. '<i>Talk your mother-tongue and
let's get next. What's the game with Major de Beaujolais?</i>'
or words to that effect. And I fell for it, Son. I could
not look that young woman in the face and get away with
it...."</p>

<p>"You talked <i>American</i> to her?" interrupted the
Vizier.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you, Bud.... She had me back-chatting
like two old Irish women&mdash;almost before I knew
it...."</p>

<p>"Jiminy!" breathed the Sheikh. "The lill' devil!"</p>

<p>"Why?" inquired the Emir.</p>

<p>"Because she wouldn't talk a word of American when <i>I</i>
rode alone with her! She only knew French!... Gee!
She surely did get my goat! When I tried a bit of broken
English on her, as a sort of thin end of the wedge to
letting her know we also were hundred-per-cent Anglo-Saxon
Americans from God's own Country, she says:</p>

<p>"'<i>Commong-vous porty-vous'</i> an'
'<i>Doo-de-la-day.</i>'... I mostly forgot my French since
I left the Legion, but I twigged she was pulling my
leg.... I said:</p>

<p>"'<i>You spik Engleesh.... Las' night you spik 'im,</i>
'an' she replies, '<i>Nong Mossoo. Vous &eacute;tiez ivre.</i>'
(That means <i>drunk!)</i> '<i>Vous parlez Arabique,</i>' and every
time I tried to say something kind and loving in English,
she says, '<i>Parly Arabique, Mossoo le Sheikh. Je ne
comprong pas Anglais.</i>' <i>...</i> An' she don't know a word
of Arabic, I swear."</p>

<p>"How d'you know she don't?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;she'd have fell off her hoss if she had
understood what I said.... And there was me tryin' to
talk plain American, and her axin' me in French to talk
Arabic.... An' I didn't get any forrader...."</p>

<p>"Gee! Can you beat it?" smiled the Emir. "Well, Buddy,
my experience was more joyful than yours. Yea, verily,
O Rose of Delight and Charmer of Many... Thou Son of
None&mdash;and Father of Hundreds."</p>

<p>"Did you make love to her, Hank Sheikh... Thou
Son of Hundreds&mdash;and Father of None?" asked the Vizier
threateningly.</p>

<p>"Search me, Son! I hadn't the time nor the temptation.
We talked good, sound, solid business, in good, sound,
plain American. And let me put you wise, Son, and you quit
dreaming love-stuff, and listen....</p>

<p>"I've told Miss Mary Vanbrugh that we're two genuine
low-brow American stiffs, honest-to-God four-flushers
and fakers.... She says she could see that for
herself...."</p>

<p>"You speak for <i>yourself,</i> Hank Sheikh," interrupted the
Vizier.</p>

<p>"I did, Son... Miss Mary spoke for <i>you,</i>" replied
the Emir.</p>

<p>The Vizier looked elated.</p>

<p>"She says, '<i>Where did you pick up that lill' ornery
dead-beat that side-kicks with you, Mr. Emir? Did the cat
bring it in, or did the wind blow it along, or was it left
on the beach by the tide?</i>'... or words to that effect,
like."</p>

<p>The Vizier's face fell.</p>

<p>"Then <i>I</i> spoke for you, Son. I said, '<i>The pore guy
ain't sich a God-awful hoodlum as he looks,</i> Miss Mary,' I
said, and she replies kindly&mdash;'<i>No, Mr. Emir, I'm sure he
couldn't be!</i>' and then I spoke up for you hearty, Bud, and
I said there isn't your equal in Africa...."</p>

<p>The Vizier beamed.</p>

<p>"... to cut the throat of a goat, skin it and gut it,
while another man'd be sharpening his knife.... But you
interrupted me and I'm wandering around trifles....
Well... I had to admit that we're Americans, Boy, and
wanted by the police... wanted badly&mdash;for doing a glide
outa the Foreign Legion.... And I owned up that Old
Man Bojolly had got me scared stiff, and that you and I
allowed that we'd either got to find Boje a lone desert
grave, or get up and hike once more&mdash;or else give in and go
quietly....</p>

<p>"Then Mary..."</p>

<p>"Who you calling 'Mary' so familiar, Hank Sheikh?" asked
the Vizier, scowling indignantly.</p>

<p>"Then Miss Vanbrugh put her cards on the table too. A
clean show-down, Son.... Boje <i>ain't</i> deserter-huntin'.
He's got something better to do!... And he hasn't a
notion about Rastignac.... That bunk he pulled on us
about '<i>bearing a great and peaceful message,</i>' wasn't
bunk at all! What he said to us in the Great and Solemn
interview was <i>the Goods....</i></p>

<p>"We must have had uneasy consciences, Son.... He
surely thinks he's on a Mission for his Fatherland. He
ain't told Miss Vanbrugh too much about it&mdash;he being a
diplomatist and all, but she knows that much for sure...
And what do you know about <i>this,</i> Son? He's a Big
Noise in their Secret Service&mdash;not just a Major in the
Mule-Wallopers...."</p>

<p>"By the Beard of the Prophet and the Name of Allah
<i>I'll</i> wallop him," growled the Vizier.</p>

<p>"Well, as I was going to say when you injected that
vulgar remark, Miss Vanbrugh and I have done a deal.
She won't tell Bojolly that we're genuine swindlers and
deserters from the Legion, provided we treat ole Boje kind
and loving, and fall in with all his schemes...."</p>

<p>"We'll fall in with those two hundred thousand dollars
without a kick or a moan," observed the Vizier, "and I rise
to remark that Viziers are Treasurers in this undeveloped
rural State...."</p>

<p>"So we're on velvet again, Bud.... All Old Man
Bojolly wants to do, is to press the dough on us. All we
gotta do is sign this Treaty not to let the Senussi in on
the ground floor, and to have no truck with low foreigners.
That means all people that on earth do dwell who aren't
French.... Shall we boot Rastignac out an' tell him to
go while the going's good&mdash;or keep him around and make a
bit on the side?... But it's old Boje's Treaty we'll
sign!"</p>

<p>"You can't sign '<i>Hank</i>' in Arabic, Father, can you?"
inquired the Vizier.</p>

<p>"I certainly can, and you can sign '<i>Bud</i>' too. You only
do a lot of pot-hooks upside down, with their tails turning
to the left, and then scribble on it....</p>

<p>"And mind, you gotta do it from right to left, too. I
saw that boose-hoisting old rum-hound, Abdul Salam, doing
it.... No Arabs can't get their signatures forged,
because they never do 'em twice alike, and nobody can read
'em&mdash;least of all those who wrote 'em.... 'Sides, I've
got the ole Sheikh's family ring...." and he indicated a
great ancient seal ring that he wore on a slightly withered
finger, of which the top joint was missing, the only finger
that it would fit.</p>

<p>"Well, as I was trying to say, Buddy Bashaw, Miss
Mary is as set on Bojolly getting away with it as we
are...."</p>

<p>"Why? What's the graft?" inquired the Vizier.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;as I figger it&mdash;he's the golden-haired, blue-eyed
boy. Saved her life in Zaguig. Shot up some stiffs who
were handing out the rough stuff. Then brought her safe
out of Zaguig&mdash;where her own brother must have got <i>his</i>
by now, she says. Whole garrison shot up, and him with
'em...."</p>

<p>"Old Man Boje must have been mighty set on paying
a call here if he lit out from Zaguig while they were
fighting...."</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Son&mdash;you spoke the truth for once....
Mary&mdash;I mean Miss Vanbrugh&mdash;says it's <i>the</i> Big Thing of
his Life, and if he pulls it off he's a made man.... He
wouldn't stop in Zaguig for anything&mdash;though his comrades
and his life-long pard and chum were in the soup...."</p>

<p>"Then we raise our price, Hank Sheikh! What's a measly
million francs if it's as important as all that?...
Let's keep him guessing, and get some more in the
jack-pot.... Tell him we got other offers too...."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;Son of Temptation and Father of Joyful Ideas&mdash;we
won't hurry any. I certainly like having the girls
around&mdash;I could have wept bitter salt tears of joy all down
my whiskers when those two girls stepped into our li'll
home...."</p>

<p>"Me too, Hank! I went all wambly in my innards and
got a lump in my throat.... I nearly hugged 'em to my
bosom.... I may yet...."</p>

<p>"Not both, Son," remonstrated the Emir. "In the Name
of the Prophet let the Reins of Moderation restrain the
Stallion of Frowardness. Yup!"</p>

<p>"Only in the way of showing respect, I meant. I ain't a
Mormon, am I? If Miss Mary'll marry me...."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;don't go indulging your mind too much, Bud. It'll
only make it worse for you later.... The way Miss Mary
talked&mdash;I reckon she's a spinster for life or Mrs. Boje for
ditto&mdash;if he has the sense to ax her.... She wouldn't
do us any <i>harm</i>&mdash;not till Hell pops&mdash;but it's Old Man
Bojolly's good <i>she's</i> thinking of...."</p>

<p>The Vizier rose to his feet and strode up and down the
tent like a caged lion.</p>

<p>"Look at here, Hank Sheikh," he said at last. "Can't we
fix it for Mister Blasted Bojolly to take his punk Treaty
and <i>go</i>&mdash;leaving the girls behind?"</p>

<p>The Emir pondered the suggestion.</p>

<p>"We could put it to him, Son," he said at length, "but I
don't think you get old Boje right.... I could live the
rest of my young life without Boje, I allow&mdash;but I believe
he's a blowed-in-the-glass White Man, if he is a Wop or
a Dago or a Frenchman.... We haven't had a sporting
bet for some time, Bud&mdash;I'll lay you seven to three in
<i>medjidies</i> that Boje won't stand for it.... He isn't
going to leave two white girls in the wigwams of a camp of
Injuns, while he gets away with the goods.... Nope...
I'll make it ten to one on Boje and..."</p>

<p>"Done! <i>Shake!</i>" snapped the Vizier, extending his hand,
and the two "shook." "I should certainly enjoy marrying his
girl on his million francs.... Teach him not to come
here frightening people... <i>and</i>&mdash;don't forget&mdash;<i>he left
Dufour and Achmet and the others to die while he made his
getaway...!</i>"</p>

<p>"But we won't hurry things, Hank," he added. "Let Boje
get a bit anxious first. We'll coop him up some&mdash;an' pull
the fierce and treacherous Sheikh stuff on him. We might
pretend we was double-crossing him with the Rastignac
outfit."</p>

<p>"You can have it your own way and run it how you like,
Son," agreed the Emir, "but I promised Miss Vanbrugh we'd
not hurt a hair of his lovely hide, bless him...."</p>

<p>"He's a brave man, and he's straight. But I say he'd
leave the girls in the lurch to get that Treaty," said the
Vizier.</p>

<p>A silence fell.</p>

<p>The Vizier, his head on his hand-clasped knees, made the
cooing sounds that showed his friend he was indeed again in
love.</p>

<p>"Hank Sheikh, old Hoss," he said anon, "she is the plumb
loveliest girl from Egypt to 'Frisco an' from Hell to
breakfast.... <i>Yes,</i> Sir!"</p>

<p>"Mary or Maudie?" murmured the Emir, from the depths of
his own long thoughts....</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c207" id="c207"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>L'HOMME PROPOSE</h3>

<p class="first">
Once again the Emir el Hamel el Kebir and his guest Miss
Mary Vanbrugh, rode alone.</p>

<p>"... And why do you consult <i>me,</i> Mr. Emir?" said the
girl. "Unlike yourself, I'm no matchmaker."</p>

<p>"If you're alluding to poor Buddy, I only spoke up
for him because you were breaking his heart, Miss Mary
Vanbrugh....</p>

<p>"And why I wanted to consult you about Miss Maudie
Atkinson is because she's your hired help, and I don't want
to take her away from you while you're in the Desert&mdash;if
you can't blow your own nose....</p>

<p>"Also you're a woman&mdash;and you'd know better than a rough
and common man like me, how a girl'd feel, and if it's a
fair proposition....</p>

<p>"Also you're clever, and can see if it's likely to pan
out well for a girl like Maudie&mdash;who's been uster living in
gay and populous cities....</p>

<p>"Also if you think you could persuade Major D.
Bojol<i>lay</i> that it is all right to leave her behind with us
low Injuns. In fact what do you think about it?..."</p>

<p>"Well, I think that Love is the <i>only thing that
matters,</i>" replied the girl, flushing warmly. "I think that
Love is Heaven and Heaven is Love.</p>

<p>"No, I'm <i>certain</i> it is.... And if Maudie really
loved you and you really loved Maudie, I'd say, 'Go
to it, and God bless you, for you couldn't do a wiser
thing!...'"</p>

<p>"It's Maudie I'm thinking about, more," said the
Emir.</p>

<p>"So'm I.... And I believe she'd be as happy as the
day is long, for she's the most romantic soul that ever
lived&mdash;and one of the staunchest....</p>

<p>"I know you'd be kind and good to her, and I know you'd
have a splendid wife.... She's real pure gold all
through.... And she'd worship the ground you trod on,
for she's madly in love with Love...." The girl gazed
wistfully at the horizon....</p>

<p>"But remember," she continued, "she's very simple,
and she's no 'Janey that's Brainy.' She won't brighten
your wigwam with high-brow thoughts and bee-you-ti-ful
aspirations to make you lead a higher and a better life of
culture and uplift."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;God bless her," agreed the Emir.</p>

<p>"And how long did you plan to deceive her and play this
Sheikh-game with <i>her?</i>" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Just up to the day when she realizes that she's fair
fed full with Arabs and Desert Sheikhs, and begins to wish
I was an ornery White Man.... As soon as I see it in her
eye that she misses the shops an' movies an' street-cars
an' candy an' the-pianner-an'-canary-home-sweet-home stuff,
she becomes Mrs. Hank of the U.S.A...."</p>

<p>"That's sense. She'll want another woman to talk frocks
and scandal with, some day, however much she might love
you...."</p>

<p>"Sure. But me being willing to pull stakes and light out
as soon as she gets real weary of the Injun life&mdash;d'you
think it's fair to her if I... ?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If she loves you.... She's seen how you live;
and it's been the one great yearn of her young life to
behold the Desert Sheikh Sheikhing in the Desert....
Shall I say anything to her?..."</p>

<p>"Not on your life, Miss Mary Vanbrugh! I'm going to do
the thing as I believe she dreams it....</p>

<p>"All women are cave-women at heart, and would like to be
swept off their feet once in their lives.... It's when
they've got to wash the cave-man's shirt and pants, an'
he will leave his nasty stinking tobacco-pipe on the cave
drawing-room plush table-cloth; and bawls her out when he
can't find his slippers, that cave-life wears thin....
Yep, they do cert'nly like to be swept off their feet and
swept right away by a Strong Silent He-Cave-Man, once in
their lives...."</p>

<p>Miss Mary Vanbrugh sighed.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you'll both be very happy&mdash;and if Maudie
can stand desert life, you <i>will</i> be&mdash;for you're made for
each other."</p>

<p>"And what about Major D. Bojol<i>lay</i>?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Will he agree to leave her behind?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if I can persuade him that she'll be happy
here.... To these European aristocrats she's just a
'servant' and her tastes unaccountable.... Besides,
if Maudie <i>won't</i> go back, he can't take her by
force...."</p>

<p>"Would he leave her if he thought she'd get a bad
time?... <i>Would he leave the pair of you</i>&mdash;<i>in return
for my signing the Treaty,</i> say?"</p>

<p>"I don't think you quite understand a gentleman&mdash;if you
talk like that...." answered the girl.</p>

<p>"No. Sure. I haven't had much truck with gentlemen, Miss
Mary Vanbrugh. Only low common men like me and Buddy....
Sure.... 'Sides&mdash;to tell you the truth <i>I was thinking
of Dufour and the others that he left to die,</i> for the sake
of his Treaty!... I knew old Dufour. He was a man. He
was Sergeant-Major with Major D. Bojol<i>lay</i> when he was
mule-walloping at Tokotu.... I knew Achmet too.... He
was a real fine he-man and <i>some</i> scrapper...."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," broke in the girl, "but it was <i>duty.</i> Duty
is his God...."</p>

<p>"Sure. It's what I'm saying. Isn't this Treaty <i>still</i>
his Duty? It'll be real interestin'.... All a matter of
what's your own private <i>Bo Ideal</i> as they call it....
'Sides, Major D. Bojol<i>lay's</i> French, and as you said,
he'd give his soul to get that Treaty for his beloved
France...."</p>

<p>"His <i>soul,</i> perhaps&mdash;not his honour," was the proud
reply, but the Emir, closely watching, had seen her
wince.</p>

<p>"I always mistrusted people that go about with a wad
of 'honour' bulgin' outa their breast-pockets... I've
found..."</p>

<p>But Miss Mary Vanbrugh spurred her horse forward and the
Emir's further words of wisdom were lost.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
Miss Maudie Atkinson, bred and born in Cockaigne and the
sound of Bow Bells, stood at eventide on a sandhill of the
Oasis and gazed yearningly towards the setting sun.</p>

<p>She was a happy, happy girl, but the cup of her
happiness was not full. She had, she felt, been, in a
manner of speaking, captured by Sheikhs, but not by <i>a</i>
Sheikh.</p>

<p>True, the great and beautiful man, the <i>lovely</i> man,
in whose presence she had thrice feasted, had looked upon
her with the eye that is glad&mdash;and Miss Atkinson, as an
extremely attractive girl who had grown up in London, was
experienced in the Glad Eye....</p>

<p>She had had it, she was prepared to swear, from the
Great Sheikh, and, moreover, he had held, and squeezed and
stroked her hand....</p>

<p>But, as one who knew joyous days on the Mondays that are
holy, Bank Holy Days, at Easter, at Whitsun, and eke in
August, Miss Atkinson knew a sense of something lacking.</p>

<p>Young pages and footmen of on-coming disposition had
to be slapped and told to Give over, to Stop it, to Come
off it, Not to be so Fast, and had to be asked What they
thought they were Doing&mdash;pulling people about until their
back hair came down and all....</p>

<p>But there seemed to be no hope that the Great Sheikh was
going to earn a slap and an admonition to Stop it....</p>

<p>Not his to chase, with flying feet, a shrieking damsel
who fled across the daisy-pied sward to a quiet spot. Not
his to hug, wrestle, and mildly punch, a coy nymph, who
scolded laughingly.</p>

<p>Not his to behave thus, nor issue invitation to the
quiet walk that leads to "walking-out."</p>

<p>No; a calm and dignified man, alas, but oh, so big and
beautiful, and so authentic.... And his eyes fair burnt
into you.... Just as the lady had written in the book,
the lovely Book of Sheikhs....</p>

<p>Maudie dreamed.... And remembered passages from the
Book....</p>

<p>"<i>With a thunderous rush of heavy hoofs, the Desert
Sheikh was upon her, and ere she could so much as scream,
she found herself swung like a feather to his saddle-bow
and whirled afar across the desert.... On, on, into the
setting sun</i>&mdash;<i>while his hot lips found hers and drank deep
of her beauty the while they burnt her very flesh like
fire....</i>"</p>

<p>Ah-h-h-h-h. That was the stuff....</p>

<p>And even as the Cupid's bow of Maudie's mouth trembled
with the words, there <i>was</i> a thunderous rush of heavy
hoofs, two huge and powerful hands took her beneath the
arms, and she was mightily hauled from the ground and
dumped heavily on to a hard saddle&mdash;("<i>Oo</i>-er!")&mdash;...
and whirled afar across the Desert&mdash;on, on, into the
setting sun....</p>

<p>Maudie all but swooned. Half fainting with joy, and
with the hope fulfilled that maketh the heart too full for
speech, she summoned the strength to raise her arms and her
eyes.</p>

<p>The latter gazed straight into those of the Great Sheikh
Himself, and the former settled firmly about his neck.</p>

<p>His lips found hers in deed and very truth, and with
a shuddering sigh of the deepest content and the highest
gratitude for the fruition of a life's ambition, Maudie
gave the Great Sheikh Himself the First Kiss of Love&mdash;a
long, long clinging kiss&mdash;and was grateful to God for His
wondrous goodness.</p>

<p>When Maudie came to earth again, wondering to find the
earth still there and Maudie still in the strong arms of
this Wonder of the World, she wiped her eyes (and nose)
with the sleeve of her <i>barracan,</i> sniffed, and gave a
little sob.</p>

<p>The Emir reined in his horse, dismounted, and lifted her
to the ground. Her knees betrayed her, and she sat down
with some suddenness, on the soft warm sand.</p>

<p>The Emir seated himself beside her and took her hand.</p>

<p>"Lill' girl," he said, "will you marry me?" and Maudie
cast herself wildly upon his broad bosom.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Sheikh, darling</i>!" she said, and again flung her
arms about his neck.</p>

<p>"We'll get married by the mullah-bird here," said the
Emir later. "Then bye'n-bye we'll hike to where there's a
Christian marriage-dope man, an' get married some more.
Have <i>another</i> wedding, Maudie!"</p>

<p>Maudie snuggled.</p>

<p>"And have <i>another</i> honeymoon, darling," she
whispered.</p>

<p>They kissed until they could kiss no longer....</p>

<p>Anon she dragged herself from him and stared
wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;you spoke <i>English</i>!" she stammered in
amaze....</p>

<p>"Sure. I learnt it since you came&mdash;so's to talk to you,
Maudie...." said the Emir modestly, and again gathered
the girl in a huge embrace.</p>

<p>"But mind you, Maudie," he said impressively, when
they rose to go, "that Major de Bojolly mustn't know I've
learnt English or else he'd want to talk English all the
time&mdash;and get me muddled in business perhaps, while I'm
a beginner&mdash;or p'raps he'd think I wasn't a Sheikh at
all!"</p>

<p>"Oh, him!" murmured Maudie languidly. "He's only a
Frenchie...."</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
In the <i>hareem</i> portion of the chief Guest-tent were
four women, two white and two black.</p>

<p>The black women were slaves, brought as "orphans" from
Lake Tchad by a Senussi caravan, and sold to the old Sheikh
twenty years before.</p>

<p>The bad old days of the fire-and-slaughter Arab
slave-raider are gone for ever, but there is still some
slave-dealing carried on&mdash;chiefly in children.</p>

<p>These are sold by their parents, or adoptive parents in
the case of genuine orphans, to caravan-leaders, who sell
them again at a profit in the distant oases, where negroes,
other than slaves, are not.</p>

<p>The shocked European Authority confiscates the entire
caravan if a slave is found with it&mdash;but the caravan does
not seek the spots honoured by Authority.</p>

<p>And if Authority goes out of its way and seeks the
caravan, it finds none but happy adopted children, staring
big-eyed from the backs of camels, or toddling along
beside kindly men, or seated patting scarcely "fair" round
bellies, beside the cooking-pot.</p>

<p>The unshocked Arab Authority buys the healthy little
animal, and treats it well, because it is valuable
property; and, when it grows up, puts it in regiment or
<i>hareem</i> according to its sex&mdash;where it may rise to high
rank and power as a military commander, or to the position
of Sheikh's favourite, and mother of future Sheikhs.</p>

<p>Slave-raiding is the foullest and vilest pursuit ever
engaged in by man, but a great deal of misunderstanding
exists about slavery as an Arab institution....</p>

<p>And certainly the two black slave-women, who squatted in
the <i>hareem</i> side of the guest-tent, were happy enough, as
they produced beautiful Arab stuffs and clothing, <i>henna</i>
for the nails and hands, <i>hadida</i> for the hair, <i>djeldjala</i>
"golden drops," <i>khalouk</i> rouge, <i>koh'eul</i> for the eyes,
and other matters of feminine interest, from the big
<i>bahut</i> trunk they had carried over from the tents of Sidi
Dawad Fetata.</p>

<p>The four women chattered; the chirping sounds of a
Senegalese dialect mingled with the Cockney accent of
London and the refined tones of a Boston high-school and
college; and though in language they were divided, in
interest they were one, as the slave girls showed the uses
of the stuffs, clothing, unguents, paints and powders that
they had brought....</p>

<p>Anon came the aged Sidi Dawad Fetata, smiling sweetly,
and saying that his long white beard was a perfect
chaperone and his age-dimmed eyes were blinded by the
beauty of the Sitts.</p>

<p>"<i>Salamoune aleikoume Esseleme, Sitt Roumya,</i>" he said.
"<i>Marhaba, marhaba,</i>" and proceeded to hope that life
might be as sweet as <i>Mekhtoume,</i> the Wine of Paradise;
as beautiful as <i>jahwiyan</i> daisies in the desert; as
satisfying as the dates of Nabt al Saif; and as long and
flowing as the Tail of the Horse of the Prophet....</p>

<p>"The old dear is making a beautiful speech, Maudie, if
we could only understand a word of it," said Mary Vanbrugh,
and smiled graciously upon the visitor, who promptly
produced gifts&mdash;a silver <i>khams</i> Hand-of-Fatma charm, and
silver <i>maroued</i> box to hold <i>koh'eul</i> for Mary; with a
<i>sokhab</i> tiara of small coins and <i>a feisha</i> charm (to keep
a husband's affections) for Maudie.</p>

<p>The old gentleman then announced a <i>diffa,</i> clapped his
hands, and the slave girls brought in a huge <i>sahfa</i> dish,
on which was an appalling heterogeny of bowls and platters,
of <i>berkouks,</i> pellets of sweetened rice; cous-cous;
<i>cherchem</i> beans; <i>leben</i> curds; <i>burghal</i> mince-meat and
porridge; <i>asida</i> dough and onions; <i>fatta</i> carrots and
eggs; strange sweetmeats, fruits, and drinks.</p>

<p>"As good a death as any, Grandpa," replied Miss
Vanbrugh, to the old Sidi's "<i>Bilhana!</i> With Joy!
<i>Bilshifa!</i> With health!" and they fell to....</p>

<p class="first">
"Coming round, Maudie?" asked Miss Vanbrugh later, when
they were alone, comatose, replete, bursting with food.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>getting</i> round, Miss," replied Maudie.</p>

<p>"We shall be as round as one of those lovely fat Arab
babies dressed in a string of beads, if we go on like this,
Miss," she added. "I shall fair lose my figger."</p>

<p>"We'll offer a reward for it, Maudie... <i>Lost</i>&mdash;<i>a
lovely figure.... Anyone returning the same to Miss
Maudie Atkinson at No.</i> 1, <i>High Street, Emir's Camp, Great
Oasis....</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Miss,</i>" murmured Maudie, "may I tell you
something?... I'm not going to be Miss Atkinson much
longer."</p>

<p>"You've told me already, Maudie."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>no,</i> Miss!"</p>

<p>"But you have! You've been mad, Maudie, ever since it
happened. Perfectly insane&mdash;going about like a dying duck
in a thunderstorm; trying to do my hair with a tooth-brush;
trying to manicure my nails with sand-paper. You don't
know who you are nor where you are; nor whether you're
on your head or your heels.... Now tell me all about
it...."</p>

<p>Maudie told....</p>

<p class="first">
"If you see Major de Beaujolais, to speak to, don't tell
him that some of the Arab Sheikhs know English, Maudie,"
said Miss Vanbrugh, when Maudie's rapture-recital was
finished.</p>

<p>"<i>No,</i> Miss," replied Maudie. "The Great Sheikh told
me not to. He said the Major might take advantage of
his innocence and make him talk English when he was
bargaining&mdash;and do him down.... It would be a shame to
impose on him, wouldn't it, Miss?"</p>

<p>"I don't think the Major will impose on the Emir,
Maudie," said Miss Vanbrugh, a little coldly perhaps.
"Anyhow&mdash;say nothing about it."</p>

<p>"I'd sooner rather <i>die,</i> first, Miss," asseverated
Maudie warmly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if you do let it slip&mdash;you'll die <i>after,</i>"
observed Miss Vanbrugh, "for I'll certainly kill you,
Maudie."</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
During the days that followed, the Emir noticed a change
in the temper of his trusty Vizier.</p>

<p>Perhaps no one else would have seen it, but to the Emir,
who loved his friend with a love passing the love of women,
including Maudie, it was clear that the Vizier was really
suffering and unhappy.</p>

<p>Never, nowadays, in the privacy of the open desert, did
he sing,</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"O ki yi yip; O ki yi yi,<br>
O ki yi yip; and ki yi yi,<br>
Get along you stinkin' camels, don't you cry,<br>
We'll all be in Wyoming in the sweet bye-an'-bye,"</p>

<br>

<p class="first">or any other amended version
of any of the eighty verses of "<i>The Old Chisholm Trail.</i>"
... Nor did he utter vain longings for his old
mouth-organ....</p>

<p>His hard grey eyes, that saw so much and told so little,
enigmatic, ironic, unreadable, humorous, were humorous no
longer....</p>

<p>The Emir was troubled, torn between two emotions, and
quite unreasonably ashamed....</p>

<p>The object of his thoughts rode past on a lathered
horse, staring grimly before him, looking neither unto the
right hand nor unto the left.... He looked dangerous.</p>

<p>"Oh! Sidi Wazir!" called the Emir. "Come and <i>faddhl,</i>"
and El R'Orab the Crow ran and took the Vizier's horse and
led it away to its stable of plaited palm-leaves in the
<i>fondouk</i> horse-lines....</p>

<p>"Good job this is a Dry State, Hank Sheikh," growled
the Vizier, seating himself beside the Emir, "or I should
cert'nly lap the <i>laghbi</i> this night.... <i>Hamdulillah!</i>
I'd sure be off the gosh-dinged water-wagon, <i>some!</i>"</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Son?" asked the Emir, although he
knew too well.</p>

<p>"Trouble is, I'm going to bust that Sheikh-wrangler,
Bojolly.... <i>Rahmat Allah!</i> Treaty or no Treaty....
And tell him some talk in the only sensible language there
is...."</p>

<p>"What's he done now, Son?" inquired the Emir.</p>

<p>"Put me in Dutch with Miss Vanbrugh.... The Infiddle
Dorg...."</p>

<p>"I allow he'd play a square game, Bud."</p>

<p>"I mean it was through him I spoke rude to a lady an'
showed myself the low-life ornery bindle-stiff I am."</p>

<p>"You was never rude to any lady, Bud."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was, Hank Sheikh. I axed her if she was
engaged to be married to a scent-smellin', nose-wipin',
high-falutin dude French officer...."</p>

<p>"What you do that for, Son?"</p>

<p>"She turned down my respeckful proposal of
matterimony."</p>

<p>"And then you fired up about Bojolly?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"And what did Miss Vanbrugh say when you did that?...
She talked American at you all right this time, then?"</p>

<p>"Yep. You bet. When I began to call Bojolly
down..."</p>

<p>"What did she say when you asked if she was fixed up
with the Major?"</p>

<p>"She says, '<i>It's a beautiful sunset to-night, Mr.
Man</i>,' an' she thought she was ridin' with a decent an'
courteous American, and that Major D. Bojol<i>lay</i> was
the finest and noblest and bravest man she'd ever met,
an' thank you, she'd prefer to ride back to the Oasis
alone...."</p>

<p>"What you do then, Son?"</p>

<p>"I says, 'I thought <i>you</i> was American, Miss Vanbrugh,'
an' then I over-rode my hoss like the mean coyote I am."</p>

<p>"So you're sore and ashamed, Son. You hurt a hoss an' a
woman, the two best things there are...."</p>

<p>"I'm tellin' you.... And I'm goin' to eat
sand... and I'm goin' to bust that Sheikh-wrangler,
Bojolly...."</p>

<p>"As how?"</p>

<p>"He can shout his own fancy&mdash;knives, guns... rifles
if he likes. P'raps he'd prefer to use that sword he's
brought all this way to impress us and the girls....
I'll back my Arab sword against it, if he likes."</p>

<p>"What <i>d'you</i> like, Son?"</p>

<p>"Knives. I ain't had a knife-fight since when. And it's
a satisfying way of expressin' your feelings to a man you
don't much like...."</p>

<p>"And Miss Vanbrugh, Son? Miss Vanbrugh, who you love so
much, and who thinks Major D. Bojol<i>lay</i> the finest an'
noblest an' bravest man she ever saw?... Didn't I <i>tell</i>
you, right back at the very first?... Didn't I say to
you, '<i>Don't you go kidding yourself, you Bud&mdash;for she's
going to be a spinster or Mrs. Boje'?</i>"</p>

<p>The Vizier scowled glumly.</p>

<p>"Now I'll tell you something for your good, Buddy
Bashaw.... You aren't in love with anybody....
You're just plumb jealous of a better man than yourself,
because he's got away with it.... Who was first in
the field?... You talk about busting Boje! And why
for? Because you can't get his girl away from him!...
<i>Gee!</i>"</p>

<p>"Spill some more, you oozin' molasses-bar'l," growled
the Vizier.</p>

<p>"Certainly.... If you haven't got the innercence o'
the dove nor the wisdom of the serpent, you <i>can</i> have the
sense of a louse.... Ole Man Bojol<i>lay</i> brought Miss
Vanbrugh here, and he's goin' to take her away again....
You made your firm offer of marriage and it was declined
with thanks.... Now behave your silly self... and be
ashamed of you."</p>

<p>"Sure. But look at here, Hank Sheikh. I'm <i>plumb</i>
<i>jealous of a better man than me,</i> am I? Well&mdash;no objection
to makin' <i>certain</i> who's the better man, is there?"</p>

<p>"Yep. You aren't goin' to fight Major D. Bojol<i>lay</i>,
so don't think it. I dunno what's bitin' <i>you,</i> Buddy
Bashaw.... <i>Wallahi!</i>"</p>

<p>"Why not fight him?"</p>

<p>"Because he's our guest.... Because he's going to
give us a wad of jack.... Because we don't want any
French army here looking for him. Because Miss Vanbrugh
thinks he's the noblest, bravest, and..."</p>

<p>"Gee! I got a think come!" interrupted the Vizier....
"We'll sure try the brave man out.... We'll see if he
<i>is</i> worthy o' Miss Vanbrugh&mdash;which nobody is."</p>

<p>"'Cept Buddy Bashaw the Wild and Woolly Wazir," murmured
the Emir.</p>

<p>The Vizier pursued his great idea.</p>

<p>"You say he's the Almighty Goods, an' <i>you</i> seem to
want him to marry Miss Mary&mdash;well, <i>we'll try him out.
Inshallah!</i>"</p>

<p>"Now look at here, Son," interrupted the Emir again.
"Get this straight.... See that hand o' mine, Boy?"</p>

<p>"<i>Some! Allahbyjiminy!</i> I could see it seven mile away,
without a telescope neither&mdash;an' then mistake it for a leg
o' mutton...."</p>

<p>"See that hand o' mine, Bud," repeated the Emir
solemnly. "God's my witness, I'd cut it off, if that'd make
you an' Miss Mary happy for life. I cert'nly would....
But I got sense, tho' I ain't a clever li'll man like
you&mdash;an' I say no girl ever did a plumb sillier thing than
marry a man she didn't love.... Nor any man ever did
such a <i>damn</i> silly thing as wanta marry a gal that didn'
love him.... I'd sooner see Mary marry you and live
on goat's flesh and barley-bread in a tent, than marry
the Major and live in High Sassiety, provided she loved
you.... But she don't. And won't...."</p>

<p>"Very well, Pastor, an' that's <i>that....</i> Now then!
We're goin' to find out how much this French parlour-snake
and lounge-lizard <i>does</i> love Miss Vanbrugh.... First of
all I'm goin' to take ten <i>medjidies</i> off'n you, an' if I
don't, then you're goin' to take a hundred off <i>me.</i>"</p>

<p>"How's that, Son?"</p>

<p>"You forgot that li'll bet we made? We're goin' to knock
him up in the dead o' night an' offer him the Treaty,
signed, sealed and witnessed&mdash;<i>provided</i> he saddles up an'
lights out to-morrow <i>without</i> the girls...."</p>

<p>"Which he cert'nly won't."</p>

<p>"... An' if you're right you get your ten. <i>And</i>
soon after that, we'll give him a <i>real</i> test.... Now
I'd lay down my life for Miss Vanbrugh, or any other nice
girl..."</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Son. <i>Any</i> girl."</p>

<p>"... and if Boje <i>really</i> loves Miss Vanbrugh, let him
lay down his'n.... We'll give him the opportunity....
He oughta be proud of the chance to do it!... He won't
though, you betcha, and I put a hundred to one on it."</p>

<p>"<i>Done.</i> Shake. Put it there, Son," and the two erring
men shook hands.</p>

<p>"It's robbing you, Son&mdash;and I didn't oughta do it,"
pondered the Emir thereafter, "but you gotta live and
learn."</p>

<p>"You live till to-night and you'll learn you've lost ten
bucks, Hank Sheikh," was the cold reply.</p>

<p>"I'll live, Son, if Rastignac don't get me," answered
the Emir. "He'd poison our coffee when we visited him,
or shoot us unarmed as soon as look at us, if he thought
he could get away with it&mdash;and nominate his own Emir
here.... How <i>I</i> didn't shoot <i>him</i> when he started in
about murderin' Boje and doin' worse for his two female
spies, I do <i>not</i> know."</p>

<p>"Me, neither," agreed the Vizier. "I promise myself a
quiet heart-to-heart wrangle with Rastignac when the time
comes.... Reckon we should be layin' up trouble for the
tribes if Rastignac was never seen again?"</p>

<p>"Sooner or later.... It's bound to come though, when
we hitch up with the French, as we must.... The foul
filthy coyote&mdash;I'd like to hang him on a tree."</p>

<p>"I allow he's got the face of a shark and the heart of a
shark," observed the Vizier.</p>

<p>"No, no! That's an exaggeration, Son," reproved the
Emir. "There never wasn't any shark with a face as much
like a shark's as Rastignac's is. Nor any shark with a
heart as much like a shark's neither.... Still, he's a
brave man&mdash;and he shall die a man's death if we don't let
him go."</p>

<p>"Right, Hank Sheikh," agreed the Vizier. "Let me fight
him.... <i>Knives!</i>"</p>

<p>"We'll see how things pan out with Boje before we settle
Rastignac's hash," replied the Emir. "I should smile to
stick 'em in a ring, with any weapons they liked, and say,
'Now fight it out for yourselves'&mdash;<i>after</i> tellin' Boje
what Rastignac offered us big money to do to him <i>and the
girls....</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Rastignac!</i>" growled the Vizier, and spat in a vulgar
and coarse manner.</p>

<p>"You low common man," observed his lord. "You don't seem
to improve in your ways although you live with me."</p>

<p>"<i>No,</i>" replied the Vizier significantly.</p>

<h2><a name="c208" id="c208"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>LA FEMME DISPOSE</h3>

<p class="first">
Yoluba, the seven-foot Soudanese slave, on sentry-go
outside the Guest-tent, heard the murmur of voices rising
and falling within.</p>

<p>That did not interest him in the least.</p>

<p>Nothing interested him greatly, save to get the maximum
of food, love, fighting and sleep. And the approbation
of his Lord the Sidi el Hamel el Kebir, Commander of the
Faithful and Shadow of Heaven.</p>

<p>To do this, orders must be obeyed promptly and
exactly.</p>

<p>Present orders were to prevent the <i>Franzawi</i> Sidi from
leaving the Guest-tent&mdash;firmly but respectfully to tell him
he must stay within, because the sun (or moon) was very hot
without.</p>

<p>Suddenly the voices ceased and then the <i>Franzawi's</i>
rose to an angry and abusive shout! Should he rush in?</p>

<p>No&mdash;for the Emir and the Vizier were coming out.</p>

<p class="first">
"I hand it to you, Hank Sheikh," admitted the Vizier, as
the two entered the pavilion of the Emir. "Boje cert'nly
spoke up like a man.... He's made good <i>so far.</i>"</p>

<p>"You can hand me ten chips too, Son," observed the
Emir. "And if you go on with it, you'll hand me a hundred.
I'll let you back out if you wanta quit.... In fact I'd
like you to. I hate playing a low-down trick on a brave
man...."</p>

<p>"Cut out the sob-stuff, Hank Sheikh," was the prompt
reply. "If he's the blue-eyed hero, let him live up to
it&mdash;or <i>die</i> up to it. He won't know it's a trick either,
the way I figger it. 'Sides, you're so all-fired anxious
about Miss Vanbrugh&mdash;let's see if he's solid, before you
give him your blessin' and a weddin'-present."</p>

<p>"What's the frame-up, Son?" asked the Emir.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;we're goin' to be the fierce and changeable,
treacherous Sheikhs on him for a bit, and get him
buffaloed. Then we'll pay another midnight call on him, an'
tell him he's sure hurt our tenderest feelin's&mdash;callin'
us dorgs an' pigs an' such.... Got to be wiped out
in blood.... But we don't want to wipe a guest
ourselves&mdash;so if he likes to do it himself, we'll let the
girls go free and uninjured immediately."</p>

<p>"And if he won't?"</p>

<p>"Then we say, 'Very well, Mr. Roumi. Then the gals come
into our <i>hareems,</i> the Treaty gets signed, an' you can get
to Hell outa this with it....'"</p>

<p>"And if he says, '<i>How can I trust you to do me a square
deal when I'm dead?</i>'"</p>

<p>"Then we say, '<i>You</i> GOTTA <i>trust us. No option. But
when we noble savages give our word on the Q'ran</i>&mdash;<i>it
goes</i>.'"</p>

<p>"And how do we work it?... Tell R'Orab to pull the
cartridges outa his gun beforehand, and then let him shoot
himself with an empty gun.... When it clicks, our stony
bosoms relent and we embrace him in tears.... That it?"
asked the Emir.</p>

<p>"Nope. Too easy a death. Nothing in shootin' yourself.
'Sides, he might <i>find</i> his gun had been emptied, an'
double-cross us. Shoot himself with the empty gun, grinnin'
up his sleeve meantime."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Nasty sticky death. Poison."</p>

<p>"He might drink it, feeling sure it was a bluff and
grinning to himself while hopin' for the best."</p>

<p>"He's goin' to <i>know</i> it's poison. Good forty-mile,
mule-slayin', weed-killer.... What we took off old Abdul
Salam.... He's going to see it kill a dorg."</p>

<p>"Well, it'll kill <i>him</i> then, won't it?"</p>

<p>"Nope. The poison'll be in the poor dorg's
drinkin'-water <i>already.</i> Then I'll pour half a gill of
<i>pure milk</i> into it, an' the li'll dorg drinks an' hands in
his checks <i>pronto....</i> Then I give the rest o' the milk
to Boje in his cawfee.... Then it's up to him....
<i>If</i> he drinks, you get a hundred bucks, an' Boje gets Miss
Vanbrugh...."</p>

<p>"An' if he don't?"</p>

<p>"We'll ride him outa town an' tell Miss Vanbrugh that
the li'll hero&mdash;what was goin' to live for her&mdash;didn' see
his way to <i>die</i> for her."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> can tell her, Bud.... I'll be somewhere else
at the moment...."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we ain't goin' to put him in any danger, nor do a
thing <i>to</i> him, are we?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing.... And you're going to a girl to
bear the glad news that her hero's slunk off and left
her because his hide was in danger and to get his Treaty
signed. Shake, Son, I admire a brave man."</p>

<p>"But it'll be <i>true,</i> won't it?" expostulated the
Vizier.</p>

<p>"Yes, Son&mdash;and that's what she'll never forgive you,"
replied the Emir.</p>

<p>"But it won't be," he added. "Boje'll lap that fake
poison of yours like you'd drink whisky.... And he'll
come outa this job better'n we shall.... I don't like
it, Son. Sure thing, I don't&mdash;but it'll come back on your
own silly head.... Mary'll love the Major all the
more, and our name'll be Stinkin' Mud.... The Major'll
love Mary all the more, because he tried to die for
her...."</p>

<p>"Die nothing!" jeered the Vizier. "He's only a furriner
an' a scent-smellin' ornament.... Drinkin' poison at
three o'clock in the morning's a tougher proposition than
shootin' off guns in a scrap.... 'Sides&mdash;s'pose he did
play the li'll hero an' drink the fatal draught to save his
loved one's life&mdash;he won't tell her about it afterwards,
will he? 'Specially when he finds it was all a fake?"</p>

<p>"No. He won't say anything, Son. But <i>I</i> shall. If Boje
swills dorg-slaying poison on an empty stomach in the nasty
small hours o' the morning, he's goin' to get the credit
for it&mdash;an' I'll see he does...."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;he won't, Hank Sheikh, so don't spend those
hundred bucks before you collect.... Well, I'm goin' to
hit it for the downy...."</p>

<p>The Emir sat stroking his beard reflectively, and
murmured, "<i>Wallahi!</i> Verily '<i>he worketh well who worketh
with Allah</i>,' saith The Book.... Bust me if <i>I</i>
know&mdash;Anyway, it'd settle that li'll girl's doubts once for
all&mdash;an' poor Ole Man Dufour's ghost won't worry her....
If I guess her right, she hates one little corner of Boje
and worships the rest of him with all her soul....
It's an awful low-down trick in a way&mdash;but it'll settle
things once for all for Miss Mary Vanbrugh.... If Boje
is a dyed-in-the-wool and blowed-in-the-glass bachelor,
with his work as his wife and his job as his mistress,
she better know it&mdash;the sooner the quicker.... It is
a low-down game, Bud&mdash;awful mean and ornery&mdash;but those
Secret Service guys cert'nly spend their lives in bluffing
and playing tricks.... It's their job.... And
they ought to take it in good part if they're bluffed
themselves.... <i>Bluff!</i> Gee! What a bluff to pull on the
bluff-merchant.... Well, let it rip...."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," replied the departing Vizier. "G'night,
pard. <i>Emshi besselema.</i>"</p>

<p class="first">
As the Emir and his Vizier rode back from visiting
the camp of the emissary of the Sultan of Stamboul and
his great Brother; and from watching the drill of the
camel-corps recruits; inspecting the <i>fondouk</i> and lines;
and generally doing the things that most Oriental Rulers
leave to others to leave undone, the Emir asked his Vizier
if he had slept well, and if he had risen in a better frame
of mind.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to try Bojolly out, I tell you," replied the
Vizier.</p>

<p>"And you got it clear that whether he stands or falls,
it won't do you any good with Miss Vanbrugh?"</p>

<p>"Yup. I done with women. My heart's broke&mdash;but I shall
get over it. I don't ask any girl twice. She refused me
flat. Quite nice but quite certain. <i>And,</i> when I called
Bojolly down&mdash;quite nasty an' still more certain.... No,
Hank, my heart's broke, but I'm facin' up to life like a
man...."</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Bud.... Now drop this foolishness about
the Major. It won't do any good...."</p>

<p>"Do some good if it saves Miss Vanbrugh from a
fortune-huntin' French furriner, won't it? American girls
should marry American men...."</p>

<p>"And American men should marry American girls, I
s'pose?" observed the Emir.</p>

<p>"You said it, Son.... Say&mdash;ain't that li'll
Maudie-girl some peach?..."</p>

<p>"She surely is.... Pity your heart's broke, Bud.
Still&mdash;American men gotta marry American girls, anyway."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;Anglo-Saxon men oughta marry Anglo-Saxon girls,
I mean. <i>Course</i> they ought.... No frills an' doo-dahs
about Maudie, if she <i>is</i> British.... Make a fine plain
wife fer a plain man...."</p>

<p>"You cert'nly <i>are</i> a plain man, Bud," admitted the Emir
reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Maudie may be engaged already," he added.</p>

<p>"She don't wear any ring.... I looked to see..."
replied the Vizier.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I <i>have</i> known engaged girls not wear a ring,
Son," admitted the Emir.</p>

<p>"Then they was engaged to mean skunks," decided the
Vizier, and burst into song.</p>

<p>His broken heart evidently <i>was</i> mending, and cool dawn
in the desert is a very stimulating, lovely hour.</p>

<p>The Emir smiled tolerantly as he listened to one more
variation of "<i>The Old Chisholm Trail.</i>" <i>...</i> All was
well with Buddy when Buddy sang....</p>

<p>"Wish I got my ole mouth-organ," observed the Vizier.</p>

<p>"Your mouth is an organ in itself, Son," replied the
Emir, as the Vizier again lifted up his voice and informed
the wide Sahara that,</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Ole Hank Sheikh was a fine ole Boss,<br>
Rode off with a gal on a fat-backed hoss,<br>
Ole Hank Sheikh was fond of his liquor,
Allus had a bottle in the pocket of his slicker."</p>

<p class="first">
"How you know I rode off with a girl on a fat-backed
hoss, Son?" asked the Emir, as the Vizier paused for
breath.</p>

<p>"I didn't," admitted the Vizier.... "Did you? Sorta
thing you <i>would</i> do.... Many a true word spoken in
jest...."</p>

<p>"Sure, Son. And many a true jest spoken in words,"
agreed the Emir.</p>

<p>They rode on.</p>

<p>"Sing some more, Son," requested the Emir. "Thy voice
delights me, O Father of a Thousand Nightingales....
It's good training for these high-strung Arab hosses....
Make the animals calm in a mere battle...."</p>

<p>And the Vizier continued the Saga, in the vein of the
history-recording troubadours of old:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Foot in the stirrup and hand on the horn,<br>
Worst old Sheikh that ever was born.<br>
Foot in the stirrup, then his seat to the sky,<br>
Worst old Sheikh that ever rode by."...</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
Beside a little irrigation-runlet Miss Maudie Atkinson
sat&mdash;and waited, her mental attitude somewhat that with
which she had been familiar all her life at the hour
of one on the Sabbath Day, "<i>For what we are about to
receive.</i>..."</p>

<p>Emerging from the Guest-tent, at what, after much
peeping, she considered to be a propitious moment,
she had strolled past the tents of her <i>fianc&eacute;
(her fianc&eacute;!),</i> the Great Sheikh, and walked
slowly towards a strategic spot. Here she threw off her
<i>barracan</i> and stood revealed, Maudie Atkinson, in a nice
cotton frock, white stockings and white shoes. Much more
attractive to Arab eyes, she was sure, than shapeless
swaddlings of a lot of blooming nightdresses and baggy
trousers.</p>

<p>Silly clo'es for a girl with a figger....</p>

<p>Would he come?</p>

<p>Sure to, if he wasn't too busy, or hadn't got to take
Miss Mary for a ride.... When would that nice Major
come up to the scratch, and take what was waiting for
him?... Oh, what happy, lucky girls she and Miss Mary
were!...</p>

<p>Would he come?</p>

<p>A shadow moved beside her and she turned.</p>

<p>Golly! It was the little one. Didn't he look a nib in
those gay robes!</p>

<p>"Good-evening, sir," said Maudie.</p>

<p>"'Evening, Miss," replied the Vizier. "Shall we go for a
li'll stroll under the trees?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't mind if we do, sir," said Maudie, rising
promptly. <i>(Sheikhs!</i>)</p>

<p>"I been admiring you ever since you come, Miss,"
observed the Vizier as they strolled off.</p>

<p>"No! Straight? Have you <i>reely?</i>" ejaculated Maudie.</p>

<p>"Sure. All the time," replied her companion with
conviction. "In fact, I follered you to-night to say
so&mdash;an' to ask you if you thought you an' me might hitch up
an' be pards...."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't mind, sir," said Maudie. "Fancy <i>you</i>
speaking English, too...."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss.... Er&mdash;yes. You see, I sent for a
handbook as soon as I saw you that night."</p>

<p>"No! Not <i>reely?</i>"</p>

<p>"Sure! Fact! Would I tell you a <i>lie?</i> But you must
never let Major Bojolly know."</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir. Miss Vanbrugh said she'd kill me if I
did.... As if I <i>would!</i> Besides, I never see him now.
Why are you keeping him a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we're just making sure he doesn't run off an' take
you two ladies away from us...."</p>

<p>"He don't take <i>me! I'll</i> watch it," asserted Miss Maud
Atkinson.</p>

<p>"My heart would cert'nly break if he did.... Miss
Maudie, will you marry me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>sir</i>! If you'd only spoke sooner!" Maudie looked
down and blushed.</p>

<p>"I'm engaged to the other Sheikh.... We're going
to be married twice and have two honeymoons.... It's
reely very kind of you, sir, but things being as they are,
I..."</p>

<p>Maudie looked up. But the Sheikh had gone....</p>

<p>A few minutes later he thrust his head into the
sleeping-tent of the Emir, where that gentleman, dressing
for dinner, was washing his feet.</p>

<p>With a horrible scowl and a display of gleaming teeth,
the Vizier gazed upon his Lord.</p>

<p>"O you Ram<i>bunc</i>tious Ole Goat," he hissed, and withdrew
his Gorgon head from the aperture.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
But, being a man of noble forbearance and generosity,
this was the only allusion made by the Vizier to the human
frailties of his Lord.</p>

<p>The soul of determination, and slow to accept defeat, he
remarked during the course of the evening <i>faddhl:</i></p>

<p>"Say, Hank&mdash;how you like to be a <i>real</i> brother-in-law
to a Sheikh?"</p>

<p>"Fine, Bud.... You got a sister for me to marry?"</p>

<p>"No, Son. And if I had I'd be pertickler who she married
to.... No, I meant a real Sheikh, and I was referring to
me bein' his brother-in-law."</p>

<p>"You got me buffaloed, Pard. Spell it."</p>

<p>"S'pose I was to marry Miss Leila Nakhla, then? I'd be
brother-in-law to the young Sheikh, wouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Yup. And own brother to a dam' fool."</p>

<p>"Jealous of me again, Hank Sheikh?"</p>

<p>"You got marryin' on the brain, or where your brain
oughter be, Buddy Bashaw.... You had a rise in
salary&mdash;or feelin' the Spring?"</p>

<p>"It's partly your bad example, an' partly seein' these
lovely white girls, Hank.... I'm all of a doodah. I
wanta marry an' I wanta go Home.... I sets on end by
the hour and sings <i>The Old Chisholm Trail...</i> and then
I keeps on sayin' '<i>Idaho, Montana, Utah, Oregon, Nevada,
Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, California</i>'&mdash;till you'd
think I was going potty...."</p>

<p>"No, I'd never think you was <i>going</i> potty, Son,"
observed the Emir, regarding the face of his Vizier
benignly. "How long you had this consumin' passion for
Leila?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I got up with it this very morning, Hank Sheikh. I
s'pose it <i>is</i> your bad example?... <i>I</i> dunno....
I think I'll go an' have a talk with ole Daddy Pertater
and see what he knows about me an' Leila gettin'
engaged.... As you made him guardian, I s'pose he gets
the rake-off?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Son.... I allow I'd better go down the
bazaar and buy the weddin' present. Have a toast-rack or
fish-knives, Brigham-Young-and-Bring'em-Often?"</p>

<p>"Gee, Hank! If your brains was a furnace there wouldn't
be enough fire to scorch your hat.... I'm goin' to call
on Daddy Pertater right now...."</p>

<p>But when, after speaking with old Sidi Dawad Fetata of
all other subjects on the earth, in the heavens above, and
in the waters under the earth, the Vizier inquired&mdash;with
meaning&mdash;as to the health and happiness of the Sitt Leila
Nakhla, he learned a strange thing.</p>

<p>"My heart is sore for her, Sidi," announced the old
man. "She is possessed of <i>djinns....</i> She cannot
sleep.... Every night she rises from her cushions and
goes forth to walk beneath the stars. Old Bint Fatma
follows her, and she says the girl talks with spirits and
<i>afrits....</i> Always, too, she stands near the tent of
the Emir and calls the protection of the Prophet and the
blessings of Allah upon him.... No, she sleeps not, and
neither does she eat...."</p>

<p>"Marriage worketh wonders with women," suggested the
Vizier.</p>

<p>"Ya, Sidi," agreed the old man. "But the poor Leila's
pale bridegroom will be Death.... She will not live
to marry my grandson&mdash;and he will pine for her and die
also.... I am an old man, Sidi, but the grave will
close upon her and upon him, while I yet cumber the
earth...."</p>

<p class="first">
"And what do you know about <i>that</i> for a merry old
crape-hanger, my son?" the Vizier asked himself as he
strolled to his tent.</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">
Hadji Abdul Salam, doctor and saint, entertained
visitors that evening.</p>

<p>"Often they sleep in the big pavilion where they have
sat and <i>faddhled</i> till nearly dawn," he said to the more
important of his two guests. "More often they sleep each in
his own tent.... There is usually a Soudanese sentry on
the beat between the Guest-tent and those of the Emir and
the Vizier."</p>

<p>"We can wait till your man is on duty," said Suleiman
the Strong, called El Ma'ian, "or if it be a Soudanese, we
can kill him."</p>

<p>"There might be a noise, and if you are caught&mdash;I do
not think you will leave his presence alive, a second
time.... He knows it was you who sent the Emir Mahommed
Bishari bin Mustapha abd Rabu's assassin, too...."</p>

<p>"There will be no noise," said Suleiman the Strong,
grimly.</p>

<p>"Nor must either the Emir or the Vizier make a sound in
dying," warned the good Hadji. "They are lions possessed
by devils, and each would spring to the help of the
other...."</p>

<p>"Yea. See to it, thou Abdullah el Jemmal, that thy man
dies swiftly and in silence," growled Suleiman.</p>

<p>"Right through the heart, Sidi&mdash;or across the throat a
slash that all but takes the head off," smiled Abdullah,
"according to how he lies in sleep."</p>

<p>"Bungle not&mdash;or the Hadji here will put a curse upon
thee that shall cause the flesh to rot from thy bones."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>yes!</i>" chirped the doctor. "Surely!... Be not
taken alive in thy bungling, sweet Abdullah. A quick death
will be a lovely thing in comparison with what I will
arrange for thee, shouldst thou spoil our plans."</p>

<p>"And if I do my part well, I have <i>medjidies,</i> camels,
women, tents&mdash;to my heart's desire, and be made a man of
consequence in the Tribe?" said Abdullah the Camel-man.</p>

<p>"Yea! Verily! After the dawn that sees the death of
the Emir and the Vizier, thou wilt never work again,
Abdullah&mdash;never sweat, nor hunger, nor thirst again, good
Abdullah."</p>

<p>"Dost thou swear it, Sidi Hadji&mdash;on the Q'ran?" asked
the camel-driver.</p>

<p>"I swear on the Q'ran, and on my head and my life and by
the Beard of the Prophet and the Sacred Names of Allah that
thou shalt never hunger nor thirst again, Abdullah, after
thou hast slain the Vizier."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Suleiman the Strong, with a sinisterly
humorous glance into the merry face of the Hadji, "I myself
will see to it that thou shalt <i>never hunger nor thirst
again,</i> gentle Abdullah," and he displayed gleaming teeth
in a smile that quite won the camel-man's heart.</p>

<p>How delightful to bask in the smiles of the
future rulers of the Tribe, and to know that one was
shortly to become a Person of Quality and a Man of
Consequence!...</p>

<p class="first">
"And now&mdash;return to this tent no more," said the Hadji
in speeding his parting guests, "for it is dangerous to do
so.</p>

<p>"At times they visit me&mdash;though not often at night&mdash;and
I have a fancy that the accursed El R'Orab the Crow
spies upon me, and also the aged Yakoub.... Let them
beware&mdash;and watch their food, I say....</p>

<p>"Go in peace and with the blessing of Allah, and remain
hidden with the caravan-men in the <i>fondouk</i> of the

<h3>AUTOCRATS AT THE BREAKFAST-TABLE</h3>

<p class="first">
"Well, son Bud, what you know about <i>that</i> for a fight?"
asked the Emir of his Vizier as they broke fast after the
duel between the French officer and the <i>agent provocateur</i>
from the East. "What price Boje at the killing game?"</p>

<p>"I allow it was the best sword-fight I ever seen,"
replied the Vizier. "I never denied that Rastignac nor Boje
was real <i>men....</i>"</p>

<p>"And I'll tell the world that if Boje gets Miss Mary,
she gets a husband to be proud of," interrupted the
Emir.</p>

<p>"Yep&mdash;as a he-man that can hold up his end of a
dog-fight, all right, Hank. But I tell you a woman wants a
man that's something more than a bad man to fight....
S'pose he loves fightin' better than he loves her&mdash;what
then, Hank Sheikh? And s'pose his real views of women
is that they're just a dead-weight on the sword-arm or
gun-hand, and a dead-weight on your hoss's back?"...</p>

<p>The Vizier paused and pondered mournfully.</p>

<p>"Don't stop, Son," requested the Emir. "You remind me of
Abraham Lincoln. It's almost po'try too.... I can lend
you a bit.... Hark:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"'White hands cling where your wool is thickest:<br>
He rideth the fastest who rideth the quickest....'" </p>

<br>

<p class="first">
"Where you get that from, Hank Sheikh?" asked the Vizier
suspiciously. "'Tain't <i>Q'ran,</i> is it? Sounds more like
Shakespeare to me."</p>

<p>"No, Son, you're wrong for once. Bret Harte or
Chaucer.... I had to say it at school. There's a lot
more:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"'Fallin' down to Gehennum or off of a throne,<br>
He falleth the hardest who falleth alone<.'"</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
"Well! I allow he <i>would,</i>" commented the Vizier.
"Because if he weren't alone and fell on the other guy,
he'd fall softer...." he added.</p>

<p>"You're right, Bud, as usual," admitted the Emir. "My
mistake. I oughta said:</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">
"'Climbin' down to Gehennum or up on a throne,<br>
He goes by himself who goeth alone!'</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
"Yes&mdash;that's the poem&mdash;and, as I said, it's by Josh
Billings or a Wop named Dante.... I forget.... They
<i>did</i> tell me at school, when I had to learn it...."</p>

<p>"Don't believe there's any such pome, nor that you ever
was at school, Hank Sheikh. Put your tail down! And let
a yell for some more of this porridge-hash.... Yes&mdash;I
allow Boje is a good boy&mdash;he's straight; there ain't a
yeller streak in him; he's got sand; and it's pretty to
watch him fight.... But that don't make him the man for
Miss Mary Vanbrugh."</p>

<p>"What <i>would,</i> Bud?" asked the Emir.</p>

<p>"Lovin' her more than anything and everything else in
the world.... Bein' ready to lay down his life for
her...."</p>

<p>"He'd do that, Son."</p>

<p>"<i>That's</i> nothing!... Bein' ready, I was going to
say, when you butted in, to give up his army prospects
an' his chances, an' his promotion&mdash;<i>you</i> know&mdash;what
they call his career and his&mdash;future and all....
<i>To let everything go for the woman he loves&mdash;even his
country...</i> ."</p>

<p>"Say some more, Walt Whitman," the Emir stimulated his
flagging friend. "I'll lend you a bit for that too. Listen
at this:</p>

<p class="verse">
"'He made a solitude and called it Peace,<br>
(Largely because there weren't no P'lice)<br>
The world forgetting, by the world forgot<br><br>
He took her to that lovely spot.<br>
Saying I have now but you, my dove, and that's what the papers call<br>
The World well lost for Love.'</p>

<p class="first">
"That's Byron, Son. But you shouldn't read him till
you're older."</p>

<p>The Vizier stared long and critically at his lord.</p>

<p>"What's biting you now, you old fool?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Miss Mary Vanbrugh," replied the Emir. "Ever since she
came here I sit and think of all the things I learnt at
school&mdash;and how I uster talk pretty an' learn lessons...
and recite po'try... and play the pianner...."</p>

<p>"And I s'pose you wore a plug hat and a Prince Albert
and a tuxedo and lavender pants and white kid gloves and
pink silk socks on your pasterns in those days? Here&mdash;get a
lump o' this tough goat and chew hard instead o' talking,
Hank," advised the Vizier. "You got a touch of the sun or
else swallered a date-stone and it's displaced your brain.
Chew hard an' listen to me and improve your mind....
What I say is, that Boje's got to do something more than
killing Rastignac to prove he's the right husband for a
way-up American girl&mdash;and I don't agree to it until he
shows <i>and</i> proves that she's the Number One Proposition
of all his life, and nothing else isn't worth thirty cents
in the same continent.... Get me?... And the quicker
the sooner, for he's the wounded hero and she's nursing
of him&mdash;and women always falls in love with what they
nurse.... Amateur-like, I mean.... It isn't the same
with professional nurses o' course...."</p>

<p>"Right again, Son. I was in a Infirmary once and at
Death's Door, and if that old nurse had started lovin'
me, I'd certainly have crep' through that Door to
escape...."</p>

<p>The Emir was apparently in sardonic mood and of flippant
humour that morning&mdash;not an infrequent symptom, in his
case, of a troubled and anxious soul.</p>

<p>His friend was well aware of this peculiarity, and
classed it, in his puzzled mind, with other of Hank's
idiosyncrasies&mdash;such as his way of being dumbly taciturn
for days, and then having a mordantly loquacious hour; or
his habit of occasionally speaking like an Eastern dude
instead of talking properly like a genuine rough-neck hobo
and a he-man. However, whatever Hank chose to say or to do
was right in the sight of the man whose narrow, deep stream
of affection flowed undeviatingly and eternally towards
him, his hero, friend and ideal....</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we better try Boje out as soon as possible or
sooner," continued the Vizier. "He only got a bit chipped
in the fierce shemozzle this mornin', and he'll be able to
sit up and do business to-morrow.... Reckon Rastignac
will pull round?"</p>

<p>"No. Rastignac has got his, this time, and a damned
good job too, the swine!... He's for the land where the
tomb-stone bloometh beneath the weeping willow-tree, and
the wild whang-doodle mourneth for its mate," opined the
Emir.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we and the world can spare him, though I rise to
remark he died like he lived, makin' trouble, and seekin'
sorrow with a high and joyful heart," and the Vizier
turned down an empty cup&mdash;of clay&mdash;and poured a libation
of coffee-dregs. "What'll we do with that mouth-flappin',
jabbering, shave-tail breed he brought with him, if
Rastignac goeth below to organize mutinies against the
Devil?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Send him back with the soft answer that turneth away
wrath&mdash;and a soft and empty money-belt," replied the
Emir.</p>

<p>"You allow Boje's proposition is the best?" inquired the
Vizier.</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Son. It is. Yea, verily. And I got a
special reason for lending ear unto the words of Boje too.
We'll go in solid with him."</p>

<p>"You're right, Hank Sheikh. We don't wanta hitch up
with a gang of niggers, Turks, Touareg, Senussi and
anti-white-man trash.... We ain't French and we ain't
got no great cause to love 'em either&mdash;but we got our
feelings as White Men.... Yep&mdash;and we got some sacks
that'd just take a million francs too.... And if
ever we got caught out by the Legion hogs, and it was a
firing-party at dawn for ours, the French Big Noise would
say, 'Forget it&mdash;they're good useful boys, and we want 'em
whole and hearty in the Great Oasis?' Wouldn't they?"</p>

<p>"You said it all, Son," agreed the Emir, and clapped
his hands, that <i>narghilehs</i> might be brought by the slave
waiting at a respectful distance.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
"Who <i>was</i> this poor creature whom Major de Beaujolais
found it expedient to kill?" asked Mary Vanbrugh during the
evening ride with the Emir el Hamel el Kebir. "He was a
Frenchman too, so why was he treated as an enemy?"</p>

<p>"He wasn't treated as an enemy by <i>us,</i> though he
soon would have been," replied the Emir. "We received
him politely and we listened to all he had to say....
Listened too long for our comfort...."</p>

<p>"And it was interesting?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Some of it certainly was," replied the Emir. "He got to
know that there was a French officer here, openly wearing
his uniform, and accompanied by two white women.... He
told us exactly what I ought to do with the three of them,
and offered me quite a lot of money to do it."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"I won't put it in plain words," was the reply. "But you
just think of the plumb horriblest thing that could happen
to you, and then you double it&mdash;and you'll hardly be at the
beginning of it, Miss Mary Vanbrugh."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the girl.... "And was that why Major de
Beaujolais fought him?"</p>

<p>"Partly, I guess&mdash;along with other reasons. It certainly
didn't help the man's chances any, that the Major knew what
was proposed for <i>you...</i> ."</p>

<p>"How did he get to know?" asked the girl</p>

<p>"That's what I've got to find out," was the reply, "if
I have to pretend he won't get his Treaty unless he tells
me.... He'd do <i>anything</i> to get that safely signed,
sealed and delivered."</p>

<p>"Not <i>anything,</i>" said the girl, staring ahead
unseeingly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;<i>that</i> we may discover, perhaps, all in
good time," was the doubting reply.... "Life is
very dear&mdash;and a life's ambition is sometimes even
dearer...."</p>

<p>The Emir was speaking English, with the words, accent,
and intonation of a person of culture and refinement; and
his companion eyed him thoughtfully, her face wistful and
sad.</p>

<h2><a name="c210" id="c210"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE SITT LEILA NAKHLA, SULEIMAN<br>
THE STRONG, AND CERTAIN OTHERS</h3>

<p class="first">
At dead of night, the Sheikh el Habibka el Wazir awoke
with the feeling that there was something wrong. For as
long as he could remember, this invaluable gift had been
his, perhaps because, for as long as he could remember, he
had lived, off and on, in danger, and under such conditions
that light sleeping and quick waking had been essential to
continued existence.</p>

<p>Also the fact that, in the months before his birth, his
mother had slept alone in a log cabin, with a gun leaning
against her bed, and an ear sub-consciously attuned to the
sound of the approach of stealthy terrors&mdash;Indians, wolves,
mountain "lions," Bad Men, and, worst of all bad men, her
husband&mdash;may have had something to do with his possession
of this animal instinct or sixth sense.</p>

<p>Someone had passed the tent with stealthy steps....
The sentry had done that a hundred times, but this was
different.</p>

<p>The Vizier passed straight from deep dreams to the door
of his tent, his "gun" at the level of the stomach of
anyone who might be seeking sorrow.</p>

<p>"<i>Min da?</i>" he growled, as he peered out.</p>

<p>Nobody.... He crept toward the Emir's pavilion....
Nothing.... Yes&mdash;a shadow beside the Guest-tent sentry,
a young recruit, one Gharibeel Zarrug.</p>

<p>There should be no shadow on a moonless night....</p>

<p>The shadow stooped and went into the tent by the
entrance to the men's part of it.</p>

<p>Had it been the other entrance, the Vizier would have
fired; for persons wearing black clothing, for the sake of
invisibility, do not enter <i>anderuns</i> at midnight for any
good purpose.</p>

<p>The Vizier circled the Guest-tent in the darker darkness
of the palm-clumps, approached, and lay down behind it.
Ah!... The good and pious Hadji Abdul Salam!...
<i>What</i> was that?... <i>Murder,</i> eh?... The low-down,
treacherous swine!...</p>

<p>And Suleiman the Strong was back again, was he?...
And who might <i>he</i> be?... Good old Boje!... Spoken
like a man.... Wouldn't leave the girls, wouldn't
he?... He would&mdash;to save his life, and get the Treaty,
though.... Wouldn't stand for assassination of the Emir
nor the Wazir, eh?... Yep. Boje was certainly a White
Man!...</p>

<p>The Vizier crept round to the front of the tent and the
knees of Gharibeel Zarrug smote together, as a figure rose
beside him, and the voice of the Sheikh el Habibka el Wazir
gave him sarcastic greeting....</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the Vizier also gave the Hadji
Abdul Salam sarcastic greeting, and said he would see him
safely home to his tent: he would take no refusal of the
offer of his company, in fact....</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p class="first">
As the Emir el Kebir emerged from his pavilion before
dawn the next morning, and strode to where El R'Orab the
Crow led his master's great stallion up and down, he was
joined by the Vizier.</p>

<p>When the two were clear of the headquarter tents of the
"capital" of the Oasis, the Vizier told the Emir of the
events of the night.</p>

<p>"The worst of these holy <i>marabouts</i> and <i>hadjis</i> and
<i>imams</i> and things is that they <i>stay</i> holy in the sight
of these ignorant hick Injuns, no matter what they do; and
you can't get away from it," observed the Emir. "There'd be
a riot and a rebellion if I took good old Abdul and hanged
him on a tree.... I'd be real sorry to do it, too....
I like the cute old cuss... always merry an' bright."</p>

<p>"He's gettin' a whole heap too bright, Hank," opined
the Vizier. "But as you say&mdash;there's no lynchin' Holy
Sin-Busters in this State.... They can cut their
mothers' throats or even steal hosses, and they're still
Holy Men an' acceptable in the sight of Allah...."</p>

<p>"We better have a talk with old Dawad Fetata," said the
Emir. "He knows the etiquette of handling Holy Joes when
they get too rorty.... <i>Bismillah!</i> We mustn't make any
false moves on the religion dope, Son.... There'd be an
'Ell-of-an-Allahbaloo...."</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed the Vizier. "But Old Daddy Pertater
won't stand for havin' Abdul plottin' the death of the
Emir.... He'll know how to hand it to him....
We'll have a li'll <i>mejliss,</i> with Abdul absent, by
request.... What are we going to do about this Suleiman
guy that's got it in for you? Who <i>is</i> he?"</p>

<p>"Don't you remember the gink I told you about&mdash;that
left our outfit before you came&mdash;and joined the Emir
Mohammed Bishari bin Mustapha Korayim, that we shot up&mdash;at
Bab-el-Haggar? <i>He</i> was this Suleiman the Strong, and he
sent that thug to get me&mdash;the one you shot.... Let him
come when he feels like it. I allow he'll get his, good an'
plenty, this time," replied the Emir.</p>

<p>"Why not get a posse an' have a man-hunt?" suggested
the Vizier. "Man-hunts is good sport, and prowlin'
thugs lookin' for your liver with a long knife is bad
sport.... Catch him alive, and skin him at poker,
Son."</p>

<p>"I allow it was all lies of Abdul's," replied the
Emir.... "Suleiman's dead long ago, an' if he was alive
he wouldn't come snoopin' round here.... He's on'y
too willin' to keep away&mdash;with both feet.... Forget
it.... What you do with poor old Abdul?"</p>

<p>"Frightened him white.... <i>'Lhamdoulah!...</i> I
certainly did put the fear of God in Abdul.... Did
a magic on him.... Produced things from him that he
hadn't got.... Told him to watch his eyes and teeth
as they'd soon fall outa him; watch his arms an' legs as
they'd soon wither; watch his food becos it'd soon turn to
sand in him; watch his secret <i>laghbi</i> becos it'd boil in
his belly; watch his women becos each one had a dancin'
partner&mdash;secret, like his fermented palm-juice;&mdash;an'
watch all through the night becos Death an' the Devil was
coming for him.... He's <i>watchin'</i> all right!... He
surely is a sick man this mornin'.... I reckon he'll
die...."</p>

<p>"Poor old Abdul&mdash;I must go and hold his hand and cheer
him up some," said the Emir. "Promise him a real rousin'
funeral and start buildin' him a nice tomb.... Place of
pilgrimage for thousands...."</p>

<p>"Say, Son," he added, "I'm glad the Major played a clean
game. I told you he was a hundred per cent white."</p>

<p>"He was straight enough," admitted the Vizier. "But I
don't like him any.... Too all-fired pompshus....
Thinks he could play his Ace on the Last Trump....
Too golly-a-mighty own-the-earth.... Thinks he's
God's Own Bandmaster, Lord Luvvus, Count Again, an' the
Baron Fig-tree.... And he's one o' the hard-faced an'
soft-handed sort&mdash;that women fall for...."</p>

<p>"You're hard-faced, hard-handed, hard-hearted, an'
hard-headed, Son Bud.... Yep.... Head solid
bone...."</p>

<p>"We'll settle his hash one night, Hank Sheikh," replied
the Vizier, ignoring his Lord's rudeness. "Then we'll
<i>see.... Abka ala Kheir.</i>"</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p class="first">
They saw.</p>

<p>Never had the Emir and his Vizier cowered and fled
before armed men as they cowered and fled from the wrath of
the angry woman who burst into their presence, that night,
at the loud choking cry of the man whom they had foully
murdered.</p>

<p>She was a raging Death-angel, her tongue a flaming
sword.</p>

<p>"My God&mdash;<i>you killed him</i>!... You murdered him!...
Poisoned him like a sewer-rat.... What the Hell
<i>happened,</i> you ham-handed buffalo?" panted the Emir as
the two fled from the Guest-tent and went to earth in the
pavilion of the latter chieftain....</p>

<p>"Search me!" replied the Vizier, obviously badly shaken.
The Emir seized his friend's arm and glared into his
face.</p>

<p>"You didn't double-cross me and <i>poison</i> that fine man
a-purpose?... Not <i>poison</i> him? You wouldn't be such a
damned yellow dog?" he asked sternly.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," replied the Vizier. "I gave him
camel's milk. Part of what we had at supper.... <i>He's</i>
double-crossed <i>us....</i> Yelped so as Miss Vanbrugh sh'd
hear him, an' then threw a fake fit...."</p>

<p>"Don't be a mean hound.... He saw that dog die&mdash;an'
he drank what he thought killed the dog.... <i>And</i> he
choked like the dog did, and then collapsed&mdash;he went white
an' cold an' limp.... He's <i>dead,</i> I tell you....
<i>God! How'll I face Mary?...</i> Bud&mdash;if I thought
you..."</p>

<p>"You make me tired, Hank. If he's dead&mdash;the milk killed
him. 'Nuff to kill anybody too.... I near died myself,
first time I drunk milk!... Hank, Son, you hurt my
feelin's.... You seen me kill a few men.... Ever
know me <i>poison</i> 'em behind their backs?... You gotta
beastial mind, Hank Sheikh...."</p>

<p>They sat silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"Say, Hank," said the Vizier suddenly. "Think she'd
turn crool an' tell Bojolly on his death-bed that we're a
pair of four-flushers?... Or tell him to-morrow if he
lives?"</p>

<p>"No, Son, she'd die sooner. She allows the Major
would blow his brains out, in rage an' disgust an' fear
o' ridicule, if it came out that the Mahdee whom he'd
circumvented with his superior Secret Service Diplomacy
had circumvented <i>him,</i> the Pride o' the whole French
Intelligence Bureau, an' signed a treaty for a million
jimmy-o'-goblins.... Folks saying he didn't know a
Mahdee from an American high-jacker! Gee!..."</p>

<p>The Emir rose.</p>

<p>"I'm going back," he said. "If he's dead that girl will
go mad.... She ain't screamin' any.... She's got a
gun too.... Hope she shoots me first.... I take the
blame, Boy&mdash;for allowin' such monkeying.... I hadn't
oughter stood for it.... Shake, Son&mdash;you didn't mean any
harm...."</p>

<p>"I sure didn't, Hank pard.... I only meant it for her
good.... No I didn't! May I burn in Hell for a liar! I
was jealous of a better man. He <i>is</i> a better man....
<i>Was</i> I mean...."</p>

<p>"I'll put my gun in his dead hand and shoot
myself.... That oughta satisfy him," he added, as the
Emir crept out of the tent....</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p class="first">
The Emir returned beaming.</p>

<p>"<i>They're cuddling!</i>" he cried. "<i>Cuddling</i>&mdash;fit to
bust!... I didn't mean to intrude, and they didn't
see me.... <i>He was kissin' her face flat....</i> You
cert'nly brought it off, Buddy Bashaw... and serve you
damned well right!... They got <i>you</i> to thank....
Boje oughta ask you to be Best Man, B'Jimminy Gees!...
Allahluyer!..."</p>

<p>"But what <i>happened,</i> if he didn't throw that fit on
purpose?" asked the bewildered Vizier.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I'll tell you, Son. He was so blamed sure that
he <i>was</i> drinking poison that <i>he felt all the effects of
it.</i> He felt just like he saw that dog feel.... I knew
an Injun once, an Arapaho or a Shoshone, I think he was,
back on the Wind River Reservation at Fort Washakie&mdash;no, it
wasn't, you goat&mdash;it was in the Canyon, and the man was a
Navajo breed&mdash;and the boys played a trick on him one dark
night&mdash;stuck a fork in his heel and yelled '<i>Rattler</i>'&mdash;an'
he up an' died o' snake-bite, <i>pronto.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Can</i> it!" said the Vizier. "Cut out the
funny-staff."</p>

<p>"Fact, Son!... Yep&mdash;like old Doc' Winter, back in
Colorado in the old days. He sent out two letters, when he
couldn't go himself&mdash;one tellin' a sick man he'd better
make his will, and the other telling a Dude from the East
he was healthier than a mule.... Put 'em in the wrong
en<i>vell</i>ups!... The Dude made his will and died, and the
sick man got up and ate a steak.... Never felt another
pang or sorrow!..."</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed the Vizier. "Same sorta thing happened in
Idaho.... Only it was a young bride was sick, and a lone
ol' bachelor cattle-rustler that <i>thought</i> he was....
Same mistake like yours, Hank...."</p>

<p>"What happened?" inquired the Emir.</p>

<p>"Old bachelor had the babby o' course," was the reply.
"Only case on record I believe...."</p>

<p>"Prob'ly," agreed the Emir.... "And that's what
happened to the Major."</p>

<p>"What! Had a...?" began the Vizier.</p>

<p>"No," interrupted the Emir. "You got a <i>very</i> coarse
mind, Bud.... He thought the milk was poison, and he
thought it so hard that for a while it <i>was</i> poison, and it
acted according!..."</p>

<p>"It's a fierce world, Hank... <i>.</i> Let's pound our
ears, right here. It'll be daylight in an hour.... God
help us in the mawnin', when Miss Vanbrugh gets us!...
I'm glad you're the Emir and not me, Hank Sheikh...."</p>

<p>The troubled statesmen slept.</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p class="first">
Meanwhile, two men of simple passions and simple methods
of expressing them, prepared for strenuous action.</p>

<p>Wearing the minimum of clothing and the maximum of
razor-edged knife, Suleiman the Strong and Abdullah el
Jemmal crept from darkness to darkness until they could see
the pavilion of the Emir, wherein burned a single candle
in the wind-proof <i>shamadan</i> holder, that hung from a
tent-pole.</p>

<p>Not far from the big tent, a sentry, one Gharibeel
Zarrug, leaned heavily upon his rifle, his crossed arms
upon its muzzle and his head upon his arms....</p>

<p>Rightly considering that the place of the strategist
is a place of safety where he may strategize in peace,
Suleiman the Strong bade Abdullah the Camel-man reconnoitre
the tent and report.</p>

<p>Like a dark snake in the darkness, Abdullah crept to a
blacker spot beside the Guest-tent, whence he could see a
portion of the interior of the lighted pavilion.</p>

<p>No one moved therein, and, after a period of patient
observation, he crawled, writhed and wriggled until he
reached the aperture where a hanging curtain of heavy felt
did not quite close the entrance to the tent.</p>

<p>Perfect stillness reigned within, and a silence broken
only by the sound of breathing.</p>

<p>How many breathed?</p>

<p>It was unfortunate, but intentional on the part of the
occupants, that the light hung just where anyone entering
would see nothing but the light&mdash;the back of the tent being
in darkness, and the front well-lit.</p>

<p>Abdullah accepted the situation and moved slowly,
silently, almost imperceptibly, across the lighted carpet.
Once the light was behind him, he saw that the Emir el
Kebir and the Wazir el Habibka lay on their rugs, sleeping
the deep sleep of the innocent and just; the Vizier the
nearer to him.</p>

<p>What about two quick stabs?</p>

<p>No. These were not ordinary mortals. The Vizier would,
perhaps, make some sound as he died, and the Emir's great
arm would shoot out and seize the slayer.... Abdullah
had seen both these men in swift action....</p>

<p>No, he must stick to the programme and obey the orders
of his leader, to the letter.</p>

<p>He writhed backward as silently as he had come, and
wriggled crawling from the tent....</p>

<p>"He did that very neat and slick," observed the Emir, as
Abdullah departed.</p>

<p>"Not bad," agreed the Vizier. "He's a bit slow
though.... You ain't too near the side o' the tent,
Hank, are you?"</p>

<p>"Plenty o' room, Son; but he won't bother to come under
while he can come through the front door.... See his
silly face?"</p>

<p>"Nope. I allow it's that Suleiman guy what the Hadji was
talkin' to Boje about."</p>

<p>"Guess again, Son.... Suleiman the Strong's a real
big stiff. Twice the size o' that galoot," and the Emir
yawned hugely.</p>

<p>"What you reckon he's gone for, Hank?"</p>

<p>"Why, his bag o' tools or his plumber's-mate, I
s'pose."</p>

<p>"Wish he'd hurry up then, I'm real sleepy.... S'pose
we'd better hang Mister Gharibeel Zarrug bright an' early
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"We'll hand him over to Marbruk ben Hassan and the
body-guard. They can use him for a li'll court-martial
<i>mejliss.</i> Keep 'em happy all day."</p>

<p>"Pore Mister Gharibeel will be Mister Skinned-eel, time
they done with him. They'll treat him rough."</p>

<p>"Learn him not to double-cross&mdash;but it's poor old Hadji
Abdul Salam that oughta hang."</p>

<p>"Sure, Son. He's a bad ole possum.... G'night,
boy."</p>

<p class="first">
"They are both there, Sidi," whispered Abdullah the
Camel-man to Suleiman the Strong. "Sleeping on their rugs
like drunken <i>kif</i>-smokers, but the Emir lies beyond
the Vizier and cannot be reached. El Habibka must die
first...." And he proceeded to explain exactly the
position of affairs and of the victims.</p>

<p>"Now listen&mdash;and live," growled Suleiman, when all was
clear. "Go you back into that tent and crouch where you can
strike home&mdash;when the moment comes."</p>

<p>"When will that be?" asked Abdullah, whose knife was
brighter and keener than his brain.</p>

<p>"<i>Listen,</i> you dog," was the reply. "Crouch ready to
strike El Habibka at the moment I strike El Hamel. Watch
the tent-wall beyond him. I shall enter there.... And
our knives will fall at the same moment.... As your
knife goes through El Habibka's heart, clap your left
hand upon his mouth.... They must die together and die
silently.... Then we flee back to the <i>fondouk</i>&mdash;and
to-morrow I will appear to <i>my</i> friends and proclaim myself
Sheikh Regent of the Tribe...."</p>

<p>"And I shall be a camel-man no more," said Abdullah.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you will not be a camel-man after to-morrow,"
agreed Suleiman, and carefully repeated his
instructions.</p>

<p>"Now," he concluded, "Dawn's left hand will be in the
sky in half an hour.... Remember what will happen if you
bungle...."</p>

<p class="first">
Kneeling beside the sleeping Vizier, Abdullah el Jemmal
poised his long lean knife above his head, and stared
hard at the tent wall beyond the recumbent form of the
Emir....</p>

<p>In his sleep, the Emir rolled his heavy head round
and lay snoring, his face toward the very spot at which
Abdullah stared.</p>

<p>A bright blade silently penetrated the wall of the tent.
Slowly it travelled downward and the head of Suleiman
the Strong was thrust through the aperture, as the knife
completed the long cut and reached the ground.</p>

<p>Gently Suleiman edged his body forward until his arms
and shoulders had followed his head. As he raised himself
on his elbows, Abdullah lifted his knife a little higher,
drew a deep breath, and, ere it was completed, the silence
was horribly rent by the dreadful piercing scream of a
woman in mortal anguish.... A rifle banged....</p>

<p>Abdullah, unnerved, struck with all his strength, and
his wrist came with a sharp smack into the hand of the
waiting Vizier, whose other hand seized the throat of
Abdullah with a grip of steel.</p>

<p>Suleiman, with oaths and struggles, backed from the
tent, and the Emir, bounding across the struggling bodies
of the Vizier and Abdullah, rushed from the tent, with a
low exhortation of, "Attaboy, Bud! Bust him up," and dashed
round the tent&mdash;in time to see Suleiman the Strong drive
his knife into the breast of a woman (who grappled with him
fiercely), just as El R'Orab sprang upon the slayer from
behind.</p>

<p>Another woman stood and shrieked insanely, sentries came
running, and the French officer burst from his tent, sword
in hand....</p>

<p>The murderer was secured after a terrific struggle and
bound with camel-cords.</p>

<p>As soon as the Emir had shaken the shrieking woman into
coherence, it was learnt that it had become the custom of
the Sitt Leila, who slept badly, to rise and walk in the
hour before dawn&mdash;"when she had the world to herself," as
the old woman pathetically sobbed, "and unseen could pass
the tent of the Emir and pray for blessings on his sleeping
head...."</p>

<p>On this occasion, as they went by the road that ran
behind the Emir's pavilion, they had seen a man lying
prone, with his head beneath the tent-wall and inside the
tent.</p>

<p>Realizing that this could mean but one thing, the girl
had uttered a terrible scream and thrown herself upon the
man.... She had seized his foot and held on, with the
strength and courage of love.</p>

<p>The man, moaned the old Bint Fatma, had kicked and
struggled, knocking the girl down, had wriggled out
backwards, risen, and turned to flee, as the girl again
sprang at him and clung like Death....</p>

<p>As gently as any mother nursing her sick child, the big
Emir held the dying girl to his breast, her arms about his
neck, her eyes turned to his as turn those of a devoted
spaniel to its master&mdash;and if ever a woman died happily, it
was the little Arab girl....</p>

<p class="first">
Yussuf Latif Fetata arrived, at the double, with the
guard, and, even in such a moment, the man who had made
them what they were, noted with approval that it was a
disciplined guard under an officer, and not a mob of
Soudanese following an excited Arab....</p>

<p>"Keep that man here and hurt not a hair of his head,"
ordered the Emir, "I return," and he strode away, with the
dead girl in his arms, to the tents of Dawad Fetata.</p>

<p class="first">
As he came back, the Vizier emerged from the
pavilion.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Son," he whispered, "I croaked him...."</p>

<p>"Good," growled the Emir. "You'll see me croak the
other..." and it was plain to the Vizier that his
friend was in that terrible cold rage when he was truly
dangerous.</p>

<p>He himself had enjoyed that for which he had recently
expressed a wish&mdash;an intimate and heart-to-heart discussion
in a righteous cause and with a worthy foe.</p>

<p>Abdullah had really put up quite a good show, the Vizier
considered, and it had taken several minutes and several
good twists and turns and useful tricks, before he had had
his visitor where he wanted him&mdash;clasped immovably to his
bosom with his hawser-like right arm, while his equally
powerful left forced the assassin's knife-hand back and
over&mdash;until the hand was far behind the sharply crooked
elbow, in a position that Nature had never intended it to
occupy....</p>

<p>Abdullah had screamed like a wounded horse as the arm
and joint snapped, the knife fell from his hand, and the
Vizier seized his neck in a double grip.... Minutes had
passed.</p>

<p>"That'll learn you, Mr. Thug," the Vizier had grunted,
and released the murderer's throat.</p>

<p>But alas, it was the final lesson of his unlearning
misspent life.</p>

<p class="first">
"Let the guard charge magazines and form single rank,"
said the Emir to Yussuf Latif Fetata&mdash;who, beyond a
greenish pallor of countenance, showed nothing of what he
felt. None would have supposed that this stoic had just
beheld, borne in the arms of another man, the dripping
corpse of the girl for whom his soul and body hungered. "If
the prisoner tries to escape, give him fifty yards and a
volley...."</p>

<p>The Emir then bade El R'Orab and the sentries who had
seized Suleiman the Strong to unbind him and to chafe his
limbs.</p>

<p>"Do you thirst, dog?" he asked.</p>

<p>"For your blood, swine," was the answer.</p>

<p>The Emir made no reply, but waited awhile, that the
prisoner's strength and the daylight might increase.</p>

<p>"Give him his knife," he said anon, and gripped his
own.</p>

<p>The Vizier drew his revolver and stood near Suleiman the
Strong.</p>

<p>"Now, dog," said the Emir, "see if you can use your
knife upon a man.... Not upon a girl nor a sleeper, this
time, Suleiman the Jackal, the Pariah Cur, the Detested of
God...."</p>

<p>The two men stood face to face, the giant Emir and the
man whose strength was a proverb of his tribe; and the
staring breathless onlookers saw a fight of which they told
each move and stroke and feint and feature to their dying
day.</p>

<p>"Yea," said El R'Orab the Crow, later, to Marbruk
ben Hassan, who, to his abiding grief, had been absent
on patrol, "it was the fight of two blood-mad desert
lions&mdash;and they whirled and sprang and struck as lions
do....</p>

<p>"Time after time the point was at the eye and throat
and heart of each, and caught even as it reached the skin.
Time after time the left hand of each held the right hand
of other and they were still&mdash;still as graven images of
men, iron muscle holding back iron muscle, and all their
mighty strength enabled neither to move his knife an
inch....</p>

<p>"Then Suleiman weakened a little and our Lord's right
hand pressed Suleiman's left hand down, little by little,
as his left hand held Suleiman's right hand far out from
his body. Slowly, slowly, our Lord's knife came downward
toward that dog's throat, inch by inch&mdash;and Suleiman
sweated like a horse and his eyes started forth.</p>

<p>"Slowly, slowly his left hand grew feeble, and the
Emir's hand, which Suleiman held, came nearer, nearer to
Suleiman's throat....</p>

<p>"There was not a sound in all the desert as that
blade crept nearer and nearer, closer and closer&mdash;till
Suleiman uttered a shriek, a scream&mdash;even as the poor
Sitt Leila Nakhla had done&mdash;for the Emir's point had
pricked him, pricked him, right in the centre of his foul
throat....</p>

<p>"And then we heard the voice of our Lord saying:
'<i>Leila! Leila! Leila!</i>' and with each word he <i>thrust,</i>
and <i>thrust,</i> and <i>thrust,</i> till Suleiman gave way, and we
saw the knife-point appear at the base of that murderer's
skull.... Right through!... <i>Wallahi!</i> Our Emir is a
<i>man</i>!..."</p>

<p>And from this Sixteenth-Century atmosphere of primitive
expression of primitive passion, which from time to time
still dominated the Oasis, the Emir slowly returned to
the Twentieth Century and received the concise approving
comments of his Vizier....</p>

<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p class="first">
And it was an entirely Twentieth-Century young woman
whom they found awaiting them in the Emir's pavilion, when
they re-entered it an hour later, after visiting the tents
of Dawad Fetata, and then seeing the bodies of Suleiman
the Strong and Abdullah the Camel-man dragged away by a
washerman's donkey, followed by an angry crowd that cursed
the evil carrion and spat upon it....</p>

<p>Miss Mary Vanbrugh requested the privilege, if not the
pleasure, of a private interview with the Emir el Hamel el
Kebir; and the Vizier departed very precipitately to his
own tents....</p>

<p>The Emir's subsequent account of the interview confirmed
the Vizier's preconceived opinion that it was well worth
missing.</p>

<p>"I told you I took the blame for that foolishness, Son,"
the Emir said, "and I cert'nly got it.... I thought I
knew the worst about my evil nature, and I thought I'd said
it too.... I was wrong, Son.... I hadn't begun to
know myself till Mary put me wise to the facts...."</p>

<p>"Yup! I always said you was a bad ole Sheikh!" agreed
the Vizier, stroking his beard.</p>

<p>"And as for <i>you,</i> Son... <i>Gee!</i> I wouldn't repeat
it, boy!... That lady surely has got an eye for
character!... When she had done saying what she thought
of me&mdash;an' it left Bluebeard, Jezebel, Seizer Borjer,
Clearpartrer, and Judas Iscariot blameless and smilin' by
comparison&mdash;when she'd done, she said, '<i>An' I no doubt you
was a fairly decent man till you fell under the influence
o' that horrible li'll microbe that's led you astray an'
ruined you, body an' soul</i>,' she said...."</p>

<p>"Gee! And all becos ole Bojolly got too much
imagination, and the Lord have blessed us with the gift
of good poker faces!" observed the Vizier.... "Did you
tell her it was only our fun, an' we was tryin' him out for
her?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sure, Son. And she said she wished <i>he</i>'d tried <i>us</i>
out&mdash;with a gun.... And who were we to presume to
dare to think her Major D. Bojol<i>lay</i> wasn't the world's
noblest and bravest hero?... If Boje don't have a
devoted adoring wife to his dying day, he'll deserve
hanging....</p>

<p>"I said he surely was a real noble hero and a great
gentleman. And I praised him fit to bust, and said he also
left Napoleon Buonaparte, Abraham Lincoln, Horatio Nelson,
Alfred the Great an' John L. Sullivan all nowhere. Got 'em
beat to a frazzle.... She said I was quite right, and
when I'd said some more she began to get friendly....</p>

<p>"Time I'd done belaudin' Boje she said I was
not <i>really</i> a bad man&mdash;only misguided&mdash;but <i>you</i>
was the father of all pole-cats and son of a bald
he-goat...."</p>

<p>"Them very words, Hank?" inquired the Vizier, much
interested.</p>

<p>"No, Son. I wish to be strictly truthful.... Not
those very words, but words to that defect, as they say in
the p'lice-court.... She and the Major are going to get
married soon as they get away from us savages, and back to
civilization&mdash;and they're going to start right off, Son,
this very day...."</p>

<p>"Maudie too?"</p>

<p>"No. Maudie told Miss Mary wild camels won't drag her
away and Miss Mary agrees.... She's coming to our second
wedding. In Zaguig it's to be.... There'll be a White
Fathers' Mission there before long...."</p>

<p>"Ain't they Roman Cathlicks, Son?"</p>

<p>"Yup. Maudie and me's going to be, too&mdash;then."</p>

<p>"Wot are you now?"</p>

<p>"Mussulman and Mussulwoman, o' course."</p>

<p>"Then when we retire from business and go Back Home
you'll jest be a chapel-goin' Bible Christian agin, I
s'pose?"</p>

<p>"Sure.... We're going to get married a third time
then...."</p>

<p>"Well, Hank Sheikh, I rise to remark that you sure
oughta find your way into Heaven, <i>one</i> trail or the
other."</p>

<p>"That's so, Bud."</p>

<p>"Also you an' Maudie'll take a lot o' divorcin' by the
time you finished gettin' married."</p>

<p>"That's so, Son. And that's a pleasin' thought. She's
the first an' only girl I ever kissed, and she'll be the
last...."</p>

<p>"<i>Wot</i> a dull life you had, Hank Sheikh!"</p>

<p>"Won't be dull any more, Son.... Maudie's a live wire
and a ray o' sunshine...."</p>

<p>"She is... and I don't see why you couldn't ha'
kept your heavy hoof outa <i>my</i> affair with her, Hank
Sheikh...."</p>

<p>"But your poor heart was broke right then, Son....
I just thought I'd stake out a claim 'fore it
mended...."</p>

<p>"Ah, well! S'pose I'll die an ole bachelor...."</p>

<p>"Sure, Bud.... Girls are discernin' critturs....
But you might not, o' course. You might get hanged young
like...."</p>

<h3>ET VALE</h3>

<p class="first">
The imposing caravan and escort of Major Henri de
Beaujolais and Miss Mary Vanbrugh had departed and a
gentle sadness was settling upon the soul of the Sheikh
el Habibka el Wazir who was about to be left alone, alone
in a populous place, while the Emir departed on his
honeymoon.</p>

<p>That forethoughtful man had caused a beautiful camp to
be pitched in a beautiful place, far off in the desert,
and thither he and his bride would ride alone after a
ceremony and a great wedding-feast.... Ride "into
the sunset"... into Paradise... Maudie and her
Sheikh!... Dreams come true!...</p>

<p class="first">
The Emir and the Vizier sat alone for the last hour
of the former's bachelor life, and a not too poignant
melancholy informed the Vizier's voice as he said:</p>

<p>"Women always come between men an' their friends,
Hank, Pard. I reckon I better hike before Maudie does
it...."</p>

<p>"Son, Buddy," replied the Emir, "you're an ol' fool.
You always was. If I didn't know Maudie'd love you pretty
nigh as much as she does me&mdash;I'd never have asked her to
marry me.... Son, I wouldn't do it <i>now</i> if I thought it
would make any difference to <i>us....</i> We're like Saul
an' David... very beautiful in our lives and in our
marriages not divided.... Why, Maudie herself said it
was almost like marryin' <i>two</i> Sheikhs&mdash;what she's been set
on all her life...."</p>

<p>"Wot&mdash;marryin' two Sheikhs?"</p>

<p>"I'll give you a fat ear in 'two shakes' if you talk
blasphemous, Buddy Bashaw....</p>

<p>"Son," continued the Emir, "I got something to tell you.
Something about Miss Vanbrugh that I promised her most
solemn I wouldn't tell <i>anybody....</i>"</p>

<p>"Wot you wanta tell me for then, Hank?"</p>

<p>"Becos you <i>ain't</i> anybody, see? An' I ain't got
any secrets from you, Bud&mdash;so cheer up, you droolin'
crape-hanger.... You know I said I'd give my hand, for
you an' her to marry, <i>if</i> you loved each other?"</p>

<p>"Yup. And why was that, Hank?"</p>

<p>"<i>Becos she's my li'll sister, Mary!</i>"</p>

<p>The Vizier sat bolt upright on his rug and stared
open-mouthed at his friend.</p>

<p>"What you handin' me?" he asked feebly.</p>

<p>"Facts. <i>She's my li'll sister, Mary.</i>"</p>

<p>"What a norrible liar you are, Hank Sheikh!...
When did you reckernize her?" whispered the Vizier, and
collapsed heavily.</p>

<p>"The moment the Major said, '<i>Meet the Sitt Miriyam
Hankinson el Vanbrugh</i>.'"</p>

<p>"Then that's your name, Hank!"</p>

<p>"Sure. My monicker's Noel Hankinson Vanbrugh!"</p>

<p>"Sunday socks o' Sufferin' Samuel! That's the first
inter<i>est</i>in' thing I ever come across in a dull an'
quiet life. I surely thought you was born-in-the-bone an'
bred-in-the- butter plain 'Hank'!"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i>'d forgot it till Boje mentioned it, Bud. Tain't my
fault!"</p>

<p>"Won't she <i>tell</i> him?"</p>

<p>"No, you old fool. Don't I keep on tellin' you she'd do
any mortal thing rather than let Major D. Bojol<i>lay</i> know
that he's been the victim of a really high-class leg-pull
and bluff. He'd die of misery an' shame, thinkin' the whole
world was laughin' at him.... He takes himself mighty
serious.... <i>He's goin' to have me an' you come to Paris
to meet the President of the French Republic</i> if we keep
the Treaty nicely...."</p>

<p>"Why, cert'nly.... Very proper.... We'll paint
li'll ol' Paris red.... Paris girls like coloured gents
I'm told.... We'll surely give the public a treat....
How did she reckernize <i>you,</i> Son?"</p>

<p>"She says she took one look at my big nose&mdash;got a li'll
scar on it, as p'raps you may ha' noticed&mdash;an' my grey eyes
an' thick black eyebrows, an' then looked for my busted
finger.... I got the top shot off'n that, when Pop an'
me an' the boys were chasin' hoss-rustlers off the range.
She was a bright li'll looker then, and she thought she c'd
stick the bit on!... She knew me most as quick as I did
her...."</p>

<p>"Why you didn't tell me, Hank?"</p>

<p>"Because she made me swear not to tell a soul. She never
told Maudie either. She was scared stiff someone might
make a slip an' old Boje come to know.... She wants
Boje to be the Big Noise of the French African Empire some
day... with her helping.... Neither is she plumb
anxious for it to come out that we're the two Americans
that quitted the Legion unobtrusive-like, down Zinderneuf
way.... They'd get us, Son.... And they'd put us
against a wall at dawn too, and take over the Great Oasis
as a going concern.... All sorts of boot-leggers, thugs,
rollers, high-jackers, gunmen, ward-heelers, plug-uglies
and four-flusher five-ace fakers would come into this li'll
Garden of Eden then....</p>

<p>"Well, Son&mdash;I better go get Eve an' mooch to the
<i>Beit Ullah.</i> Come on, Serpent.... You've never been
a <i>good</i> man, Bud, but you're going to be a Best Man,
for once&mdash;unless you wanta be a bridesmaid in those gay
petticoats."</p>

<p>"An' what about <i>me</i> marryin', Adam Hank?... I reckon
I <i>will</i> marry those four Arab Janes after all and turn
respectable.... Come on!"</p>

<p>"<i>Four Arab Janes!</i>" said the Emir. "What <i>you</i> oughta
do, Buddy Bashaw, is to quit Sheikhing and go to the South
Seas!..."</p>

<p>"Whaffor, Hank Sheikh?"</p>

<p>"... An' be King o' the Can<i>nu</i>bial Islands...."</p>
