<h1>The Grindwell Governing Machine</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Anonymous</h2>

<h4>(From <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, 1858)</h4>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>On the other side of the Atlantic there is a populous city called
Grandville. It is, as its name indicates, a great city,--but it is
said that it thinks itself a good deal greater than it really is. I
meant to say that Grandville was its original name, and the name by
which even at the present day it is called by its own citizens. But
there are certain wits, or it may be, vulgar people, who by some
process have converted this name into Grindwell.</p>

<p>I may be able, in the course of this sketch, to give a reason why
so sounding and aristocratic a name as Grandville has been changed
into the plebeian one of Grindwell. I might account for it by
adducing similar instances of changes in the names of cities through
the bad pronunciation and spelling of foreigners. For instance, the
English nickname Livorno Leghorn, the Germans insist on calling
Venice Venedig, and the French convert Washington into the Chinese
word Voss- Hang-Tong. And so it may be that the name Grindwell has
originated among us Americans simply from miscalling or misspelling
the foreign name of Grandville.</p>

<p>I incline to think, however, that there is a better reason for the
name.</p>

<p>For a good many years Grandville has been famous for a great
machine, of a very curious construction, which is said to regulate
the movements of the whole city, and almost to convert the men,
women, and children into cranks, wheels, and pinions. As a model of
this machine does not exist in our Patent Office at Washington, I
shall beg the reader's indulgence while I attempt to give some
account of it. It may be thought a very curious affair, though I
believe there is little about it that is original or new. The idea of
it was handed down from remote generations.</p>

<p>In America I know that many persons may consider the Grindwell
Governing Machine a humbug,--an obsolete, absurd, and tyrannous
institution, wholly unfitted to the nineteenth century. A machine
that proposes to think and act for the whole people, and which is
rigidly opposed to the people's thinking and acting for themselves,
is likely to find little favor among us. With us the doctrine is,
that each one should think for himself,--be an individual mind and
will, and not the spoke of a wheel. Every American voter or votress
is allowed to keep his or her little intellectual wind-mill,
coffee-mill, pepper-mill, loom, steam-engine, hand-organ, or whatever
moral manufacturing or grinding apparatus he or she likes. Each one
may be his own Church or his own State, and yet be none the less a
good and useful citizen, and the union of the States be in none the
more danger. But it is not so in Grindwell. The rules of the
Grindwell machine allow no one to do his own grinding, unless his
mill-wheel is turned by the central governing power. He must allow
the big State machine to do everything,--he paying for it, of course.
A regular programme prescribes what he shall believe and say and do;
and any departure from this order is considered a violation of the
laws, or at least a reprehensible invasion of the time-honored
customs of the city.</p>

<p>The Grindwell Governing Machine (though a patent has been taken
out for it in Europe, and it is thought everything of by royal heads
and the gilded flies that buzz about them) is really an old machine,
nearly worn out, and every now and then patched up and painted and
varnished anew. If a committee of our knowing Yankees were sent over
to gain information with regard to its actual condition, I am
inclined to think they would bring back a curious and not very
favorable report. It wouldn't astonish me, if they should pronounce
the whole apparatus of the State rotten from top to bottom, and only
kept from falling to pieces by all sorts of ingenious contrivances of
an external and temporary nature,--here a wheel, or pivot, or spring
to be replaced,--there a prop or buttress to be set up,--here a pipe
choked up,--there a boiler burst,--and so on, from one end of the
works to the other. However, the machine keeps a-going, and many
persons think it works beautifully.</p>

<p>Everything is reduced to such perfect system in its operations,
that the necessity for individual opinion is almost superseded, and
even private consciences are laid upon the shelf,--just as people lay
by an antiquated timepiece that no winding-up or shaking can persuade
into marking the hours,--for have they not the clock on the
Government railroad station opposite, which they can at any time
consult by stepping to the window? For instance, individual honesty
is set aside and replaced by a system of rewards and punishments.
Honesty is an old-fashioned coat. The police, like a great sponge,
absorbs the private virtue. It says to conscience, "Stay
there,--don't trouble yourself,--I will act for you."</p>

<p>You drop your purse in the street. A rogue picks it up. In his
private conscience he says, "Honesty is a very good thing, perhaps,
but it is by no means the best policy,--it is simply no policy at
all,--it is sheer stupidity. What can be more politic than for me to
pocket this windfall and turn the corner quick?"--So preacheth his
crooked fag-end of a conscience, that very, very small still voice,
in very husky tones; but he knows that a policeman, walking behind
him, saw him pick up the purse, which alters the case,--which, in
fact, completely sets aside his fag-end of a husky-voiced conscience,
and makes virtue his necessity, and necessity his virtue. External
morality is hastily drawn on as a decent overcoat to hide the
tag-rags of his roguishness, while he magnanimously restores the
purse to the owner.</p>

<p>Jones left his umbrella in a cab one night. Discovering that he
hadn't it under his arm, he rushed after the cabman; but he was gone.
Jones had his number, however, and with it proceeded the next day to
the police-office, feeling sure that he would find his umbrella
there. And there, in a closet appropriated to articles left in
hackney-coaches,-- a perfect limbo of canes, parasols, shawls,
pocket-books, and what- not,--he found it, ticketed and awaiting its
lawful owner. The explanation of which mystery is, that the cabmen in
Grindwell are strictly amenable to the police for any departure from
the system which provides for the security of private property, and a
yearly reward is given to those of the coach-driving fraternity who
prove to be the most faithful restorers of articles left in their
carriages. Surely, the result of system can no farther go than
this,--that Monsieur Vaurien's moral sense, like his opinions, should
be absorbed and overruled by the governing powers.</p>

<p>What a capital thing it is to have the great governmental head and
heart thinking and feeling for us! Why, even the little boys, on
winter afternoons, are restricted by the policemen from sliding on
the ice in the streets, for fear the impetuous little fellows should
break or dislocate some of their bones, and the hospital might have
the expense of setting them; so patriarchal a regard has the machine
for its young friends!</p>

<p>I might allude here to a special department of the machine, which
once had great power in overruling the thoughts and consciences of
the people, and which is still considered by some as not altogether
powerless. I refer to the Ecclesiastic department of the Grindwell
works. This was formerly the greatest laborsaving machinery ever
invented. But however powerful the operation of the Church machinery
upon the grandmothers and grandfathers of the modern Grindwellites,
it has certainly fallen greatly into disuse, and is kept a-going now
more for the sake of appearances than for any real efficacy. The most
knowing ones think it rather old--fashioned and cumbrous,--at any
rate, not comparable to the State machinery, either in its design or
its mode of operation. And as in these days of percussion-caps and
Minie rifles we lay by an old matchlock or crossbow, using it only to
ornament our walls,--or as the powdered postilion with his horn and
his boots is superseded by the locomotive and the electric
telegraph,--so the old rusty Church wheels are removed into buildings
apart from the daily life of the people, where they seem to revolve
harmlessly and without any necessary connection with the State
wheels.</p>

<p>Not that I mean to say that it works smoothly and well at all
times,-- this Grindwell machine. How can such an old patched and
crumbling apparatus be expected always to work well? And how can you
hope to find, even in the most enslaved or routine-ridden community,
entire obedience to the will of the monarch and his satellites?
Unfortunately for the cause of order and quiet, there will always be
found certain tough lumps, in the shape of rebellious or
non-conformist men, which refuse to be melted in the strong solvents
or ground up in the swift mills of Absolutism. Government must look
after these impediments. If they are positively dangerous, they must
be destroyed or removed. If only suspected, or known to be powerless
or inactive, they must at least be watched.</p>

<p>And here, again, the machine of government shows a remarkable
ingenuity of organization.</p>

<p>For instance, it is said that there are pipes laid all along the
streets, like hose, leading from a central reservoir. Nobody knows
exactly what they are for; but if any one steps upon them, up spirts
something like a stream of gas, and takes the form of a
gendarme,--and the unlucky street-walker must pay dear for his
carelessness. Telegraph wires radiate like cobwebs from the chamber
of the main-spring, and carry intelligence of all that is going on
in the houses and streets. Man-traps are laid under the
pavements,--sometimes they are secretly introduced under your very
table or bed,--and if anything is said against that piece of
machinery called the main-spring, or against the head engineer, the
trap will nab you and fly away with you, like the spider that carried
off Margery Mopp. If a number of people get together to discuss the
meaning of and the reasons for the existence of the main-spring, or
any of the big wheels immediately connected therewith, the ground
under them will sometimes give way, and they will suddenly find
themselves in unfurnished apartments not to their liking. And if any
one should be so rash as to put his hand on the wheels, he is cut to
pieces or strangled by the silent, incessant, fatal whirl of the
engine.</p>

<p>The head engineer keeps his machine, and the city on which it
acts, as much in the dark as possible. He has a special horror of
sunshine. He seems to think that the sky is one great burning lens,
and his machine-rooms and the city a vast powder-magazine.</p>

<p>There are certain articles thought to be especially dangerous.
Newspapers are strictly forbidden,--unless first steeped in a
tincture of asbestos of a very dull color, expressly manufactured and
supplied by the Governing Machine. When properly saturated with the
essence of dulness and death, and brought down from a glaring white
and black to a decidedly ashy-gray neutral color, a few small
newspapers are permitted to be circulated, but with the greatest
caution. They sometimes take fire, it is said,--these journals,--when
brought too near any brain overcharged with electricity. Two or three
times, it is said, the Governing Machine has been put out of order by
the newspapers and their readers bringing too much electro-magnetism
(or something like it) to bear on parts of the works;--the machine
had even taken fire and been nearly burnt up, and the head engineer
got so singed that he never dared to take the management of the works
again.</p>

<p>So it is thought that nothing is so unfavorable to the working of
the wheels as light, heat, electricity, magnetism, and, generally,
all the imponderable and uncatchable essences that float about in the
air; and these, it is thought, are generated and diffused by these
villanous newspapers. Certain kinds of books are also forbidden, as
being electric conductors. Most of the books allowed in the city of
Grindwell are so heavy, that they are thought to be usually non-
conductors, and therefore quite safe in the hands of the people.</p>

<p>It is at the city gates that most vigilance is required with
regard to the prohibited articles. There the poor fellows who keep
the gates have no rest night or day,--so many suspicious-looking
boxes, bundles, bales, and barrels claim admittance. Quantities of
articles are arrested and prevented from entering. Nothing that can
in any way interfere with the great machine can come in. Newspapers
and books from other countries are torn and burnt up.
Speaking-trumpets, ear- trumpets, spectacles, microscopes,
spy--glasses, telescopes, and, generally, all instruments and
contrivances for extending the sphere of ordinary knowledge, are very
narrowly examined before they are admitted. The only trumpets freely
allowed are of a musical sort, fit to amuse the people,--the only
spectacles, green goggles to keep out the glare of truth's
sunshine,--the magnifying-glasses, those which exaggerate the
proportions of the imperial governor of the machinery. All sorts of
moral lightning-rods and telegraph-wires are arrested, and lie in
great piles outside the city walls.</p>

<p>But in spite of the utmost vigilance and care of the officers at
the gates and the sentinels on the thick walls, dangerous articles
and dangerous people will pass in. A man like Kossuth or Mazzini
going through would produce such a current of the electric fluid,
that the machine would be in great danger of combustion.
Remonstrances were sometimes sent to neighboring cities, to the
effect that they should keep their light and heat to themselves, and
not be throwing such strong reflections into the weak eyes of the
Grindwellites, and putting in danger the governmental
powder-magazine,--as the machine- offices were sometimes called. An
inundation or bad harvest, producing a famine among the poor, causes
great alarm, and the governmental officers have a time of it, running
about distributing alms, or raising money to keep down the price of
bread. Thousands of servants in livery, armed with terrific
instruments for the destruction of life, are kept standing on and
around the walls of the city, ready at a moment's notice to shoot
down any one who makes any movement or demonstration in a direction
contrary to the laws of the machine. And to support this great crowd
of liveried lackeys, the people are squeezed like sponges, till they
furnish the necessary money.</p>

<p>The respectable editors of the daily papers go about somewhat as
the dogs do in August, with muzzles on their mouths. They are
prohibited from printing more than a hundred words a day. Any
reference to the sunshine, or to any of the subtile and imponderable
substances before mentioned, is considered contrary to the order of
the machines; to compensate for which, there is great show of
gaslight (under glass covers) throughout the city. Gas and moonshine
are the staple subjects of conversation. Besides lighting the streets
and shops, the chief use of fire seems to be for cooking, lighting
pipes and cigars, and fireworks to amuse the working classes.</p>

<p>Great attention is paid to polishing and beautifying the outer
case of the machine, and the outer surface generally of the city of
Grindwell. Where any portion of the framework has fallen into
dilapidation and decay, the gaunt skeleton bones of the ruined
structure are decked and covered with leaves and flowers. Old rusty
boilers that are on the verge of bursting are newly painted,
varnished, and labelled with letters of gold. The main-spring, which
has grown old and weak, is said to be helped by the secret
application of steam,--and the fires are fed with huge bundles of
worthless bank-bills and other paper promises. The noise of the
clanking piston and wheels is drowned by orchestras of music; the
roofs and sides of the machine buildings are covered all over with
roses; and the smell of smoke and machine oil is prevented by
scattering delicious perfumes. The minds of the populace are turned
from the precarious condition of things by all sorts of public
amusements, such as mask balls, theatres, operas, public gardens,
etc.</p>

<p>But all this does not preserve some persons from the continual
apprehension that there will be one day a great and terrific
explosion. Some say the city is sleeping over volcanic fires, which
will sooner or later burst up from below and destroy or change the
whole upper surface. The actual state of things might be represented
on canvas by a gaping, laughing crowd pressing around a
Punch-and-Judy exhibition in the street, beneath a great ruined
palace in the process of repairing, where the rickety scaffolding,
the loose stones and mortar, and in fact the whole rotten building,
may at any moment topple down upon their heads.</p>

<p>But while such grave thoughts are passing in the minds of some
people, I must relate one or two amusing scenes which lately occurred
at the city gates.</p>

<p>Travellers are not prohibited from going and coming; but on
entering, it is necessary to be sure that they bring with their
passports and baggage no prohibited or dangerous articles. A young
man from our side of the Atlantic, engaged in commerce, had been
annoyed a good deal by the gate-officers opening and searching his
baggage. The next time he went to Grindwell, he brought, besides his
usual trunks and carpet- bags, a rather large and very
mysterious-looking box. After going through with the trunks and bags,
the officers took hold of this box.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the young practical joker, "I have great
objections to having that box opened. Yet it contains, I assure you,
nothing contraband, nothing dangerous to the peace of the Grindwell
government or people. It is simply a toy I am taking to a friend's
house as a Christmas present to his little boy. If I open it, I fear
I shall have difficulty in arranging it again as neatly as I
wish,--and it would be a great disappointment to my little friend
Auguste Henri, if he should not find it neatly packed. It would show
at once that it had been opened; and children like to have their
presents done up nicely, just as they issued from the shop.
Gentlemen, I shall take it as a great favor, if you will let it
pass."</p>

<p>"Sir," said the head officer, "it is impossible to grant the favor
you ask. The government is very strict. Many prohibited articles have
lately found their way in. We are determined to put a stop to
it."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the young man, "take hold of that box,--lift it.
You see how light it is; you see that there can be no contraband
goods there,--still less, anything dangerous. I pray you to let it
pass."</p>

<p>"Impossible, Sir!" said the officer. "How do I know that there is
nothing dangerous there? The weight is nothing. Its lightness rather
makes it the more suspicious. Boxes like this are usually heavy. This
is something out of the usual course. I'm afraid there's electricity
here. Gentlemen officers, proceed to do your duty!"</p>

<p>So a crowd of custom-house officers gathered around the suspected
box, with their noses bent down over the lid, awaiting the opening.
One of them was about to proceed with hammer and chisel.</p>

<p>"Stop," said the young merchant, "I can save you a great deal of
trouble. I can open it in an instant. Allow me--by touching a little
spring here---"</p>

<p>As he said this, he pressed a secret spring on the side of the
box. No sooner was it done than the lid was thrown back with sudden
and tremendous violence, as if by some living force, and up jumped a
hideous and shaggy monster which knocked the six custom-house
officers flat on their backs. It was an enormous Punchinello on
springs, who had been confined in the box like the Genie in the
Arabian story, and by the broad grin on his face he seemed delighted
with his liberty and his triumph over his inquisitors. The six
officers lay stunned by the blow; and while others ran up to see what
was the matter, the young traveller persuaded Mr. Punch back again
into his box, and, shutting him down, took advantage of the confusion
to carry it off with the rest of his baggage, and reach a cab in
safety. When the officers recovered their senses, the practical joker
had escaped into the crowded city. They could give no clear account
of what had happened; but I verily believe they thought that Lucifer
himself had knocked them down, and was now let loose in the city of
Grindwell.</p>

<p>Another amusing incident occurred afterwards at the city gates. An
American lady, who was a great lover of Art, had purchased a bronze
bust of Plato somewhere on the Continent. She had it carefully boxed,
and took it along with her baggage. She got on very well until she
reached the city of Grindwell. Here she was stopped, of course, and
her baggage examined. Finding nothing contraband, they were about to
let her pass, when they came to the box containing the ancient
philosopher's head.</p>

<p>"What's this?" they asked. "What's in this box, so heavy?"</p>

<p>"A bust," said the lady.</p>

<p>"A bust? so heavy? a bust in a lady's baggage?--Impossible!"</p>

<p>"I assure you, it is nothing but a bust."</p>

<p>"Pray, whose bust may it be, Madam?"</p>

<p>"The bust of Plato."</p>

<p>"Plato? Plato? Who is Plato? Is he an Italian?"</p>

<p>"He was a Greek philosopher."</p>

<p>"Why is it so heavy?"</p>

<p>"It is a bronze bust."</p>

<p>"We beg your pardon, Madam; but we fear there's something wrong
here. This Plato may be a conspirator,--a Carbonaro,--a member of
some secret society,--a red-republican,--a conductor of the electric
fluid. How can we answer for this Plato? We don't like this heavy
box;--these very heavy boxes are suspicious. Suppose it should be
some infernal- machine. Madam, we have our doubts. This box must be
detained till full inquiries are made."</p>

<p>There was no help for it. The box was detained. "It must be so,
Plato!" After waiting several hours, it was brought forward in
presence of the entire company of inquisitors, and cautiously opened.
Seeing no Plato, but only some sawdust, they grew still more
suspicious. Having placed the box on the ground, they all retired to
a safe distance, as if awaiting some explosion. They evidently took
it for an infernal-machine. In their eyes everything was a machine of
some sort or other. After waiting some time, and finding that it
didn't burst, nor emit even a smell of sulphur, the boldest man of
the party approached it very cautiously, and upset it with his foot
and ran.</p>

<p>All this while the lady and her friends stood by, silent
spectators of this farce. The only danger of explosion was on their
part, with laughter at the whole scene. They contrived, however, to
keep their countenances, though less rigidly than the Greek
philosopher in the box did his.</p>

<p>When the custom-house officials found, that, though the box was
upset, nothing occurred, they grew more bold, and, approaching, saw a
piece of the bronze head peering above the sawdust. Then, for the
first time, they began to feel ashamed of themselves. So replacing
the sawdust and the cover, they allowed the box to pass into the
city, and tried, by avoiding to speak of the affair among themselves
to forget what donkeys they had been.</p>

<p>The Grindwell government has many such alarms, and never appears
entirely at its ease. It is fully aware of the combustible nature of
the component parts of the Governing Machine. There is consequently
great outlay of means to insure its safety. An immense number of
public spies and functionaries are constantly employed in looking
after the fires and lights about the city. Heavy restrictions are
laid on all substances containing electricity, and great care is
taken lest this subtile fluid should condense in spots and take the
form of lightning. Fortunately, the unclouded sunshine seldom comes
into Grindwell, else there would be the same fears with regard to
light.</p>

<p>So long as this perpetual surveillance is kept up, the machine
seems to work on well enough in the main; but the moment there is any
remissness on the part of the police,--bang! goes a small explosion
somewhere,--or, crack! a bit of the machinery,--and out rush the
engineers with their bags of cotton-wool or tow to stop up the
chinks, or their bundles of paper money to keep up the steam, or
their buckets of oil and soft soap to pour upon the wheels.</p>

<p>One eccentric gentleman of my acquaintance persists in predicting
that any day there may be a general blow-up, and the whole concern,
engineers, financiers, priests, soldiers, and flunkies, all go to
smash. He evidently wishes to see it; though, as far as personal
comfort goes, one would rather be out of the way at such a time.</p>

<p>Most people seem to think, that, considering all things, the
present head engineer is about the best man that could be found for
the post he occupies. There are, however, a number of the Grindwell
people--I can't say how many, for they are afraid to speak--who feel
more and more that they are living in a stifled and altogether
abnormal condition, and wish for an indefinite supply of the light,
heat, air, and electricity which they see some of the neighboring
cities enjoying.</p>

<p>What the result is to be no one can yet tell. We are such stuff as
dreams are made of, and our little life is rounded with--a crust;
some say, a very thin crust, such as might be got up by a skilful
patissier, and over which gilded court-flies, and even scarabaei, may
crawl with safety, but which must inevitably cave in beneath the
boot- heels of a real, true, thinking man. We cannot forget that
there are measureless catacombs and caverns yawning beneath the
streets and houses of modern Grindwell.</p>
