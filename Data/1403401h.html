  <p class="quote">Hopeful Bill Dale he was called in the mining camps, where
  he made calls for supplies, and they jibed at his unquenchable optimism. Bill
  loved the desert; he delighted to pry and pick into some mineral outcropping
  in a far canyon where no prospector had been before and he was perfectly sure
  in his own mind that some day he would strike it lucky. And he did; he
  uncovered a gold vein that undoubtedly meant millions, which so elated him
  that he crowed over his good fortune to Luella, his parrot pet, who had an
  uncanny way of repeating any phrase that appealed to her fancy. So it
  happened that when Bill left her outside the recorder's office while he went
  in to file his claims, Luella chattered to the bystanders and "tipped Bill's
  hand." Unscrupulous ones heard, were quick to see the significance of
  Luella's remarks, and quicker still to start their own schemes to benefit by
  Bill's discovery.</p>

  <p class="quote">Thus started the boom on the Parowan Bonanza and thus
  started Bill Dale's troubles--for it was the gold that won him Doris Hunter.
  How Bill tackled his problems, how the Parowan boom worked out, how Doris
  developed, are all related in typical B.M. Bower style, with dramatic
  vividness, with accurate knowledge of types and their settings, and with
  refreshing, wholesome humor.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; HOPEFUL BILL DALE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TO those who do not know the desert, the word usually
  conjures a picture of hot, waterless wastes of sand made desolate by sparse,
  withered gray sage more depressing than no growth at all; blighted by
  rattlesnakes and scorpions and the bleached bones of men from which lean
  coyotes go skulking away in the brazen heat that comes with the dawn; a place
  where men go mad with thirst and die horribly, babbling the while of mountain
  brooks and the cool blur of lakes shining blue in the distance, painted
  treacherously there by the desert mirage.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the desert is like that in certain places and at certain seasons
  of the year, but the men who know it best forgive the desert its trespasses,
  and love it for its magnificent distances, always beautiful, always changing
  their panorama of lights and shadows on uptilted mesas and deep, gray-green
  valleys. Such men yield to the thrall of desert sorcery that paints
  wonderful, translucent tints of blue, violet and purple on all the mountains
  there against the sky. They love the desert nights when the stars come down
  in friendly fashion to gaze tranquilly upon them as they sit beside their
  camp fires and smoke and dream, and see rapturous visions of great wealth
  born of that mental mirage which is but another bit of desert
  enchantment.</p>

  <p>Bill Dale was such a man. Hopeful Bill, men called him, with the corners
  of their mouths tipped down. Bill loved the desert, loved to wander over it
  with his two burros waddling under full packs of grub and mining tools and
  dynamite. He loved to pry and peck into some mineral outcropping in a far
  canyon where no prospector had been before him. And though he sometimes
  cursed the heat and the wind and brackish water, where he expected a clear,
  cold spring, he loved the desert, nevertheless, and called it home.</p>

  <p>Men jibed at his unquenchable optimism and mistook the man behind his
  twinkling eyes for a rainbow chaser, mirage-mad in a mild way. For even in
  Nevada, where the hills have made many a man a millionaire, they laugh at the
  seeker and call failure after him until he has found what he seeks. Then they
  want his friendship and a share in his good fortune; and this merely because
  Nevada is peopled&mdash;very thinly&mdash;with human beings and not by gods
  or saints.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, when Bill Dale came to town for fresh supplies and mail,
  some one would wonder why a great, strapping fellow like Hopeful didn't go to
  work. Perhaps that was because Hopeful carried a safety razor in his pack,
  and had the knack of looking well-groomed on a pint of water, a clean shirt,
  an aluminum comb and six inches of mirror. Your orthodox prospector (at least
  in fiction) promises himself a bath and a clean shave when he strikes it
  rich, and frequently is made to forego the luxury for years.</p>

  <p>Men liked Hopeful Bill, but they thought he was a shiftless cuss who would
  never amount to anything, since he had taken to the burro trail. A few
  remembered that Hopeful's father had been unlucky in a boom when Hopeful was
  just a kid. They thought it was a bad thing to have the legend of a gold mine
  in the family. Personally they called him a good scout,&mdash;and that was
  because they could borrow money from him, if he had any, and need not fear
  the embarrassment of being asked to repay it. They could tell their private
  troubles to Bill and be sure that he would never betray the confidence. But
  it never occurred to any man that knew him that Hopeful Bill Dale might now
  and then need money, or sympathy, or some one besides his menagerie to tell
  his troubles to.</p>

  <p>It was the menagerie that belittled Hopeful Bill Dale in the eyes of his
  fellows. Commonplace souls they were, their brains dust-dry in that cranny
  where imagination should flourish. They could not see why any grown man
  should carry a green parrot and a great, gray, desert turtle around with him
  wherever he went. They were willing to concede the harmlessness of the
  fuzzy-faced Airedale, since any man is entitled to own a dog if he wants one.
  But they could not understand a man who would call a dog Hezekiah; which was
  not a dog's name at all. The mournful, hairy-chopped Hezekiah was therefore a
  walking proof of Hopeful Bill Dale's eccentricity. And as all the world
  knows, a man must be rich before he dare be different from his fellows.</p>

  <p>Of course, they argued in Goldfield, any grown man that would keep a
  turtle on a string&mdash;tied firmly through a hole bored in the tail of its
  shell&mdash;might be expected to call it Sister Mitchell and claim that it
  had a good Methodist face. Who ever heard of a turtle having a face? And
  there was the parrot, that cooed lovingly against Bill's cheek and made
  little kissing sounds with its beak,&mdash;the same beak that had taken a
  chunk out of a stranger's hand, swearing volubly at her victim afterward.
  Even if Goldfield could overlook the parrot, there was its name to damn
  Hopeful Bill Dale finally and completely. Couldn't call it Polly, which is
  the natural, normal name for a parrot! No, he had to name the thing Luella.
  Add to that Bill's burros, that answered gravely to the names Wise One and
  Angelface. Could any man know these things and still take Bill Dale
  seriously?</p>

  <p>Goldfield shook its head&mdash;behind Bill's back&mdash;and said he was a
  nice, likable fellow, but&mdash;a little bit "off" in some ways.</p>

  <p>So there you have him, according to the estimate of his acquaintances: A
  great, good-natured, fine-looking man in his early thirties; a man always
  ready to listen to a tale of woe or to put his hand in his pocket and give of
  what he had, nor question the worthiness of the cause; but a man who seemed
  content to wander through the hills prospecting, when he might have made a
  success of some business more certain of yielding a good living&mdash;and
  mediocrity; a man with a queer kink somewhere in his make-up that prevented
  his taking life seriously.</p>

  <p>Prospectors were usually men who, having failed, through age or other
  cause, to make good at anything else, took to burrowing in the hills and
  pecking at rocks and dreaming. If the habit fixed itself upon them they
  became plain desert rats, crack-brained and useless for any other vocation.
  Hopeful Bill Dale was too young, too vigorous to have the name "desert rat"
  laid upon him,&mdash;yet. But it was tacitly agreed that he was in a fair way
  to become a desert rat, if he did not pull up short and turn his mind to
  something else. The purposeless life he was leading would "get" him in a few
  more years, they prophesied sagely.</p>

  <p>One day in spring Bill Dale walked behind his burros into Goldfield and
  outfitted for a long trip. Had any one examined closely Bill's pack loads, he
  would have guessed that Hopeful Bill had a camp established somewhere in the
  wilderness and was in for all the grub his two burros and a borrowed one
  could carry.</p>

  <p>The storekeeper knew, as he weighed out sugar, rice, beans, dried fruit
  (prunes, raisins and apricots mostly), that Bill was buying with a careful
  regard for the maximum nourishment coupled with the minimum weight. For
  instance, Bill bought five pounds of black tea, though he loved coffee with
  true American fervor. Rolled oats he also bought,&mdash;a twenty-five pound
  sack. There was a great deal of nourishment in rolled oats, properly cooked.
  And when Bill called for two large cans of beef extract, the storekeeper
  looked at him knowingly.</p>

  <p>"Goin' to develop something you've struck, hey?" he guessed with
  unconscious presumption.</p>

  <p>"Going to stay till the grub's low, anyway," Bill drawled imperturbably.
  "Hazing burros over the trail is going to be hot work, from now on until
  fall. It's cooler in the hills. I'm taking out a rented burro that will come
  back alone. I figure this grubstake ought to run me until cool weather."</p>

  <p>"Got a pretty good claim?" Storekeepers in mining towns are likely to be
  inquisitive.</p>

  <p>"Can't say as I have," Bill grinned. "Open for engagements with old Dame
  Fortune, though. Kinda hoping, too, that she don't send her daughter,
  instead, to make a date with me."</p>

  <p>"Her daughter?" The storekeeper was one of those who had desert dust in
  the folds of his brain. "Who's she?"</p>

  <p>Bill looked at him soberly, rolling a smoke with fingers smoother and
  better kept than prospectors usually could show.</p>

  <p>"Mean to tell me you never met Miss Fortune yet?" His lips were serious;
  as for his eyes, one never could tell. His eyes always had a twinkle. "She
  can sure keep a man guessing," he added. "I like her mother better,
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Er&mdash;he-he! Pretty good," testified the storekeeper dubiously.
  Something queer about a fellow that springs things you never heard of before,
  he was thinking. The storekeeper liked best the familiar jokes he had heard
  all his life. He didn't have to think out their meaning.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Cut that out! Bill! Take a look at that!" A voice outside called
  imperiously, and Bill swung toward the door.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Luella?"</p>

  <p>"Take a look at that! Git a move on!"</p>

  <p>In the doorway Bill stopped. Luella was walking pigeon-toed up and down
  the back of Wise One, where she usually perched while Bill traveled the
  desert. Three half-grown boys were crowding close, trying to reach the string
  of Sister Mitchell, who had crawled under the store steps. The string was
  fastened to the crotch of Wise One's pack saddle, and Wise One was circling
  slowly, keeping his heels toward the enemy. Luella's tail was spread fanwise,
  showing the red which even Nature seems to recognize as a danger signal. Her
  eyes were yellow flames, her neck feathers were ruffled. By all these signs
  Luella was not to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>"Cut that out! Hez! Here, Hez! Where the hell is that dog? Hezekiah! Bill!
  Come alive, come alive!" Up and down, up and down, one foot lifted over the
  other, her eyes on the giggling boys, Luella expostulated and swore.</p>

  <p>Bill stepped outside, throwing away the burnt stub of a match. The three
  boys looked at him and fled, though Bill was not half so dangerous as Luella
  or Wise One, either of which would have sent them yelping in another
  minute.</p>

  <p>"Hez! Here, Hez! Where the hell's that dog?" Luella called again
  impatiently and wheeled, stepping up relievedly upon Bill's outstretched
  finger. "Lord, what a world!" she muttered pensively, and subsided under
  Bill's caressing hand.</p>

  <p>Bill dragged Sister Mitchell from under the steps and swung her, head
  down, to the porch. He sat down beside her, his knees drawn up, Luella
  perched upon one of them.</p>

  <p>"Add two cartons of Durham, will you?" Bill called over his shoulder to
  the storekeeper and turned back to his perturbed pets.</p>

  <p>Sister Mitchell thrust forth a cautious head and craned a skinny neck,
  looking for fresh alarms. Luella tilted her head and eyed the turtle
  speculatively. "Cut that out!" she commanded harshly, and Sister Mitchell
  drew in her head timorously before she realized that it was only parrot talk
  and not to be taken seriously.</p>

  <p>The storekeeper asked Bill a question which necessitated Bill's personal
  examination of two brands of bacon; wherefore, he placed Luella on the porch
  beside Sister Mitchell and went inside to finish making up his load of
  supplies. When he emerged with a sack of flour on his shoulder and three
  sides of bacon under one arm, Luella was riding up the platform on Sister
  Mitchell's back and telling her to "git a move on." At the other end of the
  porch a small audience stood laughing at the performance.</p>

  <p>"What'll you take for that parrot, Hopeful?" a man asked, grinning.</p>

  <p>"Same price you ask for your oldest kid," Bill retorted, and returned for
  another load from the store.</p>

  <p>"Make that strike yet?" another called, as Bill came out with his arms
  full.</p>

  <p>"You bet! Solid ledge of gold, Jim. Knock it off in chunks with a
  single-jack and gadget. Bring you a hunk next trip in&mdash;if I can think of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Hate to hang by the heels till you do," Jim retorted.</p>

  <p>"Hate to have you," Bill agreed placidly, stepping over Luella and her
  mount that he might deposit his load on the edge of the porch.</p>

  <p>"What yuh got out there, anyway?" Jim persisted curiously. "You aren't
  packing all that grub out in the desert just to eat in the shade of a
  Joshuway tree. What yuh got?"</p>

  <p>"Hopes." Bill bent and slid a sack from his shoulder to the pile of
  supplies. "Outcropping of lively looking rock, Jim. Good indications. I'm
  hoping it'll turn out something, maybe, when I get into it a ways."</p>

  <p>"Get an assay on it?" Jim's curiosity was fading perceptibly. The same old
  story: lively looking rock, indications; desert rats all came in with that
  elusive encouragement.</p>

  <p>"Trace of silver, two dollars in gold," Hopeful Bill replied. "I'm hoping
  it'll run into higher values when I hit the contact."</p>

  <p>"What contact you got?" Jim's tone was plainly disparaging. "You can't
  bank too strong on values at contact, Bill."</p>

  <p>"Well, this looks pretty fair," Bill argued mildly. "A showing of
  quartzite,&mdash;if it's in place; which I'm digging to find out. Nothing
  lost but a little sweat and powder, if I don't hit it. I can eat as cheaply
  in the hills as I can here. Cheaper." From under his dusty hat brim he sent a
  glance toward the restaurant across the street. "And I know it's clean. I
  like to have eat a fly, this noon."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you try the Waffle Parlor? They've got screens."</p>

  <p>"My own cooking suits me just fine," Bill returned amiably.</p>

  <p>"All right, if you like that kinda life," Jim carped. "I should think
  you'd want to get <i>into</i> something, Bill. You aren't any
  has-been&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nope, I'm a never-was," Bill retorted shamelessly. "And a going-to-be,"
  he added with naïve assurance. "You mark that down in your book, Jim. Some
  day you're going to brag about knowing Bill Dale. Some day your tone's going
  to be hearty and your hand'll be out when you see me coming. You guys will
  all of you be saying you knew me <i>when</i>."</p>

  <p>The group bent backward to let the laughs out full and free. Into the
  midst of their mirth Luella came scrabbling with her pigeon-toed walk, her
  tail spread wide and her throat ruffled.</p>

  <p>"You cut that out!" she shrieked angrily. "Hez! Here, Hez! Where the
  hell's that dog? Git outa here! Git a move on."</p>

  <p>Bill grabbed her before she succeeded in shedding blood.</p>

  <p>"Luella doesn't like the tone of that applause," he observed, holding her
  close to his chest while he smoothed her ruffled feathers. "Luella's a
  sensitive bird, and she stands up for her folks."</p>

  <p>With three loaded burros nipping along before him, the whiskered Hezekiah
  slouching at his heels, and Luella and Sister Mitchell riding serenely the
  pack of Wise One, Bill left the town and struck off up the hill by a trail he
  knew that would cut off a great elbow of the highway, which was dusty and
  rutted with the passing of great, heavy ore wagons and automobiles loaded
  with fortune-hunters and camp equipment. At the crest of the long slope the
  burros stopped to breathe, and Bill turned and stood gazing back at the camp
  whose first fever was already cooling a bit, leaving the restless ones a bit
  bored and eager for some new strike in a fresh district, with the whooping
  boom times that must inevitably follow.</p>

  <p>"Laugh, darn you!" Bill figuratively addressed Jim and his companions down
  there in the town. "You're bone from your necks up, or you'd see plumb
  through my talk&mdash;and be on my trail like ants after a leaky syrup can.
  Go ahead and laugh, and call me a fool behind my back! You won't take the
  notion to follow me, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Lord, what a world!" chuckled Luella, scrambling for fresh foothold on
  the canvas pack as Wise One started on with a lurch.</p>

  <p>"You're dead right, old girl," Bill agreed; and went on, grinning at
  something hidden in his thoughts.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; MUSIC HATH CHARMS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JUST before sundown, while Bill and his burros and Hezekiah
  were plodding down the highway toward the sporadic camp called Cuprite, a big
  touring car came roaring up behind and passed Hopeful Bill in a smothering
  cloud of yellow dust. Bill observed that it was loaded with luggage and
  stared after it with that aimless interest which the empty desert breeds in
  men. A coyote on a hilltop, a strange track in the trail, human beings
  traveling that way,&mdash;it matters little what trivial thing breaks the
  monotony of plodding through desert country.</p>

  <p>Bill could remember when this same road was peopled with men rushing here
  and there after elusive fortune. Good men and bad, honest men and thieves,
  the dust never settled to lie long upon the yellow trail. That last two years
  had made a difference. The tide was fast ebbing, and men were rushing
  elsewhere in search of the millions they coveted.</p>

  <p>"Get a move on!" Bill called to Wise One, at the head of the pack train,
  with the strange burro tied behind at a sufficient length of rope to protect
  him from Wise One's heels, which were likely to lift unexpectedly. Luella
  repeated the command three times without stopping, and the burros shuffled a
  bit faster in the lowering dust cloud kicked up by the speeding car.</p>

  <p>Farther on, Wise One stopped short, backing up from an object in the
  trail. Bill went forward to investigate, and lifted from the ground a black
  leather case such as musicians use to hold band instruments. Bill undid the
  catches and looked in upon a shining, silver object with a gold-lined,
  bell-shaped mouth and many flat discs all up and down its length. He gazed up
  the road, already veiled with the purplish haze that comes to the desert
  before dusk, when the sun has dipped behind a mountain. The car was gone,
  hidden completely from sight by a low ridge.</p>

  <p>"They'll be back," Bill observed tranquilly, and tied the case securely
  upon the pack of Angelface. "They're bound to miss a thing like that. Anyway,
  I'll probably run across 'em somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Hate to hang till yuh do," remarked Luella, who had evidently been adding
  to her repertoire in Goldfield while no one thought she was taking heed;
  which is the way of parrots the world over.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that, now," Bill grinned. "Anyway, if it was mine, I
  know I'd miss it. I always did want to play a horn."</p>

  <p>"Aw, cut it out!" Luella advised him shrewishly. "Git a move on!" Which
  pertinent retort may possibly explain why Hopeful Bill Dale looked upon the
  parrot as a real companion. He swore that the bird understood what he said
  and conversed intelligently, so far as her vocabulary permitted. And her
  vocabulary, while simple, seemed sufficient for her needs.</p>

  <p>Instead of turning aside to a certain spring and camping there for the
  night, Bill camped near the road where he could not miss seeing and being
  seen, if any came that way. It was quite a tramp to the spring, so he took a
  couple of desert water bags and mounted Wise One, leaving the other two
  burros to follow, and trusting his supplies to the care of Hezekiah and the
  parrot.</p>

  <p>He was not approached that night, nor the next day. Cars passed him, it is
  true, hurrying through dust clouds from either direction; but never the
  automobile that had lost the horn. So Bill arrived, in the course of time, at
  his camp, richer&mdash;or poorer, according to viewpoint&mdash;by one band
  instrument of doubtful name and unknown possibilities.</p>

  <p>In spring the desert is beautiful. Bill loved the desert flowers, vivid
  pinks and blues and yellows, dainty of form, sweet as honeycomb. He loved the
  desert lights, as delicately vivid as were the flowers growing out of the
  sandy soil, shyly snuggled against some stiff, scraggy bush. Cottontails
  romped through the sage in the afterglow that lingers long in that high
  altitude, and Bill let them go unmolested, and gave Hezekiah a lecture. He
  did not believe in killing just because one can, and there was meat in camp
  already. From the juniper bushes above the spring the quail were calling.
  "Shut-that-door! Shut-that-door!"&mdash;or so Bill and Luella interpreted the
  call. Farther up on the hillside, doves were crying mournfully. And Bill knew
  that higher, on the very top of the butte, mountain sheep, deer and antelope
  were hiding their bandy-legged young away from the prowling coyotes and "link
  cats" that were less conscientious than Bill when the chance came for a
  killing.</p>

  <p>Yet this was the desert, against which men rail. There was no mistaking.
  Out there stood a barrel cactus, almost within reach of a gaunt yucca whose
  awkward, spiny limbs were rigidly upheld like bloated
  arms,&mdash;colloquially called Joshua trees because they seemed always to be
  imploring the sun. Down in the valley a dry lake lay baked yellow, hard as
  cement, with dust devils whirling dizzily down its bald length when Bill
  looked that way. On the map you will see that valley. It is officially known
  as the Amargosa Desert. And over the ridge which wore a mystic veil of
  blended violet and amethyst, Death Valley lay crouched low amongst the hills.
  The maps call that amethyst and violet pile the Funeral Mountains; and away
  to the east, Bill could see the faint blue line of Skull Mountains and the
  Specter Range standing bold behind the Skeleton Hills; proof enough that this
  was the desert, since it bore the sinister names given it by those who knew
  too little and dared too much.</p>

  <p>It could be cruel,&mdash;but not crueller than the cities. It could be
  lonely, though not so lonely as a multitude. The air was clean and sweet and
  of that heady quality that only altitude can give. Bill squatted on his heels
  by his camp fire, just about four thousand feet above sea level,&mdash;higher
  than that above the floor of Death Valley, whose rim he could see, whose
  poison springs he knew, whose terrible breath he had drawn into his
  nostrils.</p>

  <p>From now on the geography will remain closed and you must take my word for
  it. And when I tell you that the great, blunt-topped butte behind him was
  Parowan Peak, don't look for it on the map; you'll never find it. It's a
  great, wild country, a beautiful, savage country, and if you don't love it
  you will fear it greatly. And fear it is that rouses the sleeping devil of
  the desert and sets the bones of men bleaching under the arid sky.</p>

  <p>Hopeful Bill Dale knew the desert, and loved it, and made friends with it.
  He plucked a bright red "Indian paintbrush" from beside a rock and held it up
  to Luella, watching him cock-eyed from her crude perch of juniper laid across
  two forked sticks driven into the sand. Luella took the flower in one claw,
  looked it over and dropped it disdainfully.</p>

  <p>"Aw, cut it out! Let's eat," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"You're on," Bill replied amiably, turning fried potatoes out of the
  frying pan. "Come and get it, old girl."</p>

  <p>Luella was not a flying bird, except under stress of great emotion. Now
  she leaned head downward, her beak closing upon a knob where a small branch
  had been lopped off the stick. Turning like an acrobat, she went down with
  the aid of beak and claws, and pigeon-toed over to Bill's crude table,
  crawled upon a convenient rock and waited solemnly for her first helping of
  fried potato, which she ate daintily, holding it in one claw.</p>

  <p>"I've got a surprise for you, old girl," Bill began, when the edge of
  their hunger had dulled a bit. "That horn we picked up in the
  road,&mdash;it's mine now, by right of discovery. You saw how I stuck to the
  Goldfield road and made an extra day's journey of the trip, just in case that
  car came back, hunting for the horn. Lord knows where they are, by now. So I
  figure the thing belongs to me. After supper, I'm going to open her up and
  give you some music."</p>

  <p>"Hate to hang till yuh do," Luella observed pessimistically. "Let's
  eat."</p>

  <p>Bill dipped a piece of bread in his coffee and gave it to her, unmoved by
  her pessimism. "One thing a fellow needs out here alone is distraction," he
  went on. "You're getting so you know more than I do&mdash;leave you to tell
  it&mdash;and you're more human than lots of folks. You've reached the point
  where I can't seem to teach you anything more, Luella. You could almost hold
  down a claim alone, except for the cooking and maybe swinging a single-jack.
  So I figure a little diversion will come in about right."</p>

  <p>"You're on," said Luella. "Git a move on."</p>

  <p>So that is how Hopeful Bill Dale conceived the idea of becoming a
  musician, thus making use of the opportunity which Providence&mdash;or
  something not so kind&mdash;had thrown in his way. It may seem a trivial
  thing, but trivial things have a fashion of tripping one's feet in the race
  for happiness, or perchance proving to be the one factor that makes success
  certain. Bill washed his dishes and tidied his camp, and then he opened the
  instrument case and for the first time removed the shining thing within.
  Luella, once more back on her perch, watched him distrustfully.</p>

  <p>"Luck's own baby boy!" he ejaculated under his breath. "Here's a book goes
  with it. 'Progressive Method for the Saxophone.' Saxophone, hunh? I always
  did want to learn one, Luella; believe it or not. Well, let's go."</p>

  <p>"Aw, cut it out!" Luella advised him gloomily, but Bill was absorbed in
  putting together the instrument and in reading certain directions on the
  first page of the book.</p>

  <p>Followed a muttered monologue, accompanied by certain unusual grimaces and
  gestures.</p>

  <p>"'Upper and lower lips slightly over the teeth&mdash;chin must be
  down&mdash;lips drawn back as when laughing.' I got that, all right. 'Put the
  mouthpiece into the mouth a little less than halfway.'" Goggling down at the
  page, Bill obeyed,&mdash;or tried to. When he recovered from that experiment,
  he read in silence and looked up at Luella puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Now if you were human, you could maybe explain to me how a fellow is
  going to breathe steadily without making use of his nose, mouth, ears or
  eyes," he hazarded. "Your mouth is full of saxophone to your palate and past
  it, and you mustn't breathe through your nose, because that looks bad, and
  your eyes must follow the notes and it's against the rule to puff out your
  cheeks, which is unbecoming. I figure, Luella, a man's got to curl up his
  toes and <i>die</i> till he's through playing. Hunh?"</p>

  <p>"Git a move on! Come alive, come alive!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well,&mdash;" said Bill, and began again.</p>

  <p>Nothing happened, save imminent death from strangulation. Bill looked
  foolishly at the instrument. Once more he placed certain fingers carefully
  upon certain keys, flattened his lips to a fixed, painful grin, swallowed as
  much mouthpiece as was possible without choking himself to death, and blew
  until his eyes popped. Sister Mitchell came slowly forward and stood with her
  skinny gray neck stretched toward Bill, her melancholy eyes regarding
  curiously the long silver thing in Bill's tense embrace. Hezekiah came up and
  squatted on his stump of a tail, his ugly, hairy face tilted sidewise while
  he stared. Bill's family were always keenly interested in everything that
  concerned Bill, if it were only a new label on a can of tomatoes.</p>

  <p>"Didn't get a rise out of it yet," Bill apologized embarrassedly, "but I
  will. I've heard fellows warble on these brutes till your heart fair melts in
  your chest. What they can do, I can do. A little music, evenings, is what
  this camp needs."</p>

  <p>In the dimming light he read the confusing instructions all over again,
  engulfed the ebony mouthpiece within his carefully grinning mouth, took a
  deep breath,&mdash;and something slipped. A terrific, deep bass note rumbled
  forth quite unexpectedly, before Bill had fairly begun to blow.</p>

  <p>Bill jumped. Sister Mitchell disappeared precipitately into her shell,
  Luella let out an oath which Bill only used under sudden overwhelming
  emotion, and Hezekiah gave a howl and streaked it into the desert.</p>

  <p>Bill recovered first, and on the whole he was pleased with himself. He had
  gotten the hang of it by sheer accident, and he sat and made terrible sounds
  while Luella paced up and down her perch with her tail spread, cursing and
  imploring by turns.</p>

  <p>She wronged Bill if she thought that Bill enjoyed his spasmodic blattings
  and squeakings. He did not. He winced at every squawk, even while he
  persisted doggedly in the uproar. Through discord only might he hope to
  become a master of the melody he craved, wherefore he endured the discord,
  thankful that no human being was near. It took him all the next day to round
  up the burros, however, and Sister Mitchell went into retirement in her shell
  and remained there stubbornly.</p>

  <p>Thereafter, the stars looked down upon a pathetic little desert comedy
  enacted every night: The pathetic comedy of Bill Dale tying up his burros and
  his dog and anchoring a gray desert turtle to a rock before he sat down, with
  a dull-green instruction book before him on the ground, its corners weighted
  with small rocks, and practiced dolefully and indefatigably upon a
  silver-plated saxophone. As long as he could see he would sit cross-legged,
  humped over his notes,&mdash;of which he possessed a rudimentary knowledge
  learned in school. When darkness blurred the staff, Bill would tootle up and
  down the scale to the accompaniment of vituperous remarks from Luella and an
  occasional howl from Hez.</p>

  <p>Down deep in his heart there was a reason, which he would not divulge to
  any one, much less Luella. Twenty miles away, in a vine-covered ranch house
  that looked out upon the desert from under the branches of cool, green
  cottonwoods, a certain Doris Hunter sang sweet old songs sometimes in the
  twilight, and played a sketchy, pleasant little accompaniment upon the piano.
  Bill knew no ecstasy sweeter than sitting in the gloaming, staring dreamily
  up through the cottonwood branches at the evening star, while Doris sang
  "Love's Old Sweet Song."</p>

  <p>The pathetic note in the little comedy, the note which his outraged
  menagerie missed altogether, was the fact that Bill would sit for hours,
  there under the stars, and try to play "Love's Old Sweet Song." And while he
  tried patiently to make the notes come true, his heart was away over the
  ridge and down in that little, vine-covered ranch house, worshiping Doris
  Hunter while she sang.</p>

  <p>A dream came to him every night while he played and watched the stars. He
  dreamed of some day going down to the Hunter ranch, with some perfectly
  convincing excuse for a visit. He would have the saxophone tied on Wise One,
  who was more dependable in his habits than Angelface, who was a devil. He
  would wait until after supper, when Doris would finally settle down on the
  piano stool. Then he would remember his saxophone and suggest nonchalantly
  that they try a few little things together. Doris would round her eyes at
  him, and the dimple would show in her left cheek when she begged him to bring
  it in.</p>

  <p>Then,&mdash;Bill's lips would smile in spite of the correct position of
  the mouth, when he reached that point in his dream&mdash;then, after a little
  talk, and the whole family gathering around to exclaim over the beautiful
  instrument (which really was beautiful, in cold reality), why, then Bill
  would suggest something, and Doris would strike a preliminary chord or two,
  and Bill would follow her voice softly with his music while she sang:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Just a song at twi-light,<br>
  When the lights ar-re low,<br>
  A-and the flick'ring sha-adows,<br>
  Sof-ftly come and go-o&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>Bill's lips would soften, his eyes would grow luminous and very, very
  tender. He would forget to play and would stare up into the gemmed purple,
  and wonder, and dream, and hope.</p>

  <p>After a long while, when Luella had tucked her head under her wing, Bill
  would lay the saxophone carefully in its velvet nest and begin absently to
  unlace his boots. Doris Hunter&mdash;the gold mine he meant to find&mdash;had
  indeed almost found&mdash;"Love's Old Sweet Song"&mdash;the skill to play
  while Doris sang; these things mingled indissolubly in his soul while he
  slept and dreamed, shuttled through his waking mind while he worked.</p>

  <p>So this was the real Bill Dale, whom men called Hopeful Bill with their
  mouths tipped down.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; LUELLA ANNOUNCES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the beginning of mining booms, accident and freaks of
  chance are popularly supposed to play the leading rôle. A mule, for instance,
  played fairy godmother when it let fly its heels and kicked a nub off a ledge
  of fabulous richness in gold. A man threw a rock at a jack rabbit, and then
  realized that the rock was heavier than it should be; sought its mates and
  found a mine. Or a man takes an inadvertent slide down a ledge and lands upon
  a bonanza.</p>

  <p>These things do happen occasionally; and, being ready-made romance, they
  are seized upon avidly by the teller of tales. So the public comes to believe
  that chance, and chance alone, discovers the precious minerals and leads men
  like blind children to the spot; a sort of
  "Shut-your-eyes-and-open-your-mouth" game played by Fate.</p>

  <p>In reality, more mines are found by careful prospecting than are ever
  given to the world by sheer accident. More and more is science turning
  prospector, and men go carefully, reading geologic formations, following
  volcanic breaks and mineral outcroppings. Your desert prospector may eat with
  his knife and forget to take off his hat in the house, but he can talk you
  blind on intrusions and sedimentary deposits and the dips, angles and faults
  of certain mineral formations he knows. Chlorides, "bromides,"
  sulphides,&mdash;these things are the shop talk of desert and mountains. Men
  speak of one another with praise or disparagement, as "knowing rock" or as
  not knowing rock. And the man who does not know rock is the man who goes
  about praying for a mule to kick the dirt off a gold outcropping for him.</p>

  <p>Bill Dale knew rock. He had spent two years, more or less, prospecting on
  the southern slope of Parowan, because there was a "break" running across,
  and because, in the lower end of a wash that had many feeders wrinkled into
  the mountainside, he had picked up a few pieces of "float" carrying free gold
  in such quantity that it would mean a real bonanza if he found it "in place,"
  which means in a continuous vein leading to the main body that produced
  it.</p>

  <p>As a bystander he had observed the boom at Goldfield, Tonopah, and at
  other lesser points. His father had been rich in a boom town for a few weeks.
  Then he had been a broken, old pauper until he died. Wherefore, Bill Dale did
  not want a premature boom, nor any boom at all. He wanted to find the ledge
  or vein that had produced that float, so that he would have something
  tangible to offer Doris Hunter,&mdash;in case he ever found courage enough to
  offer her anything. He knew that he was liked by the Hunters; but he also
  knew that as a prospective husband for Doris he was never for one moment
  seriously considered. Don Hunter, her father, was a stockman. He did not
  believe much in mines, and he looked askance, from a business viewpoint, at
  any man who spent good, working days in prospecting the desert. It was the
  most insidious, the most hopeless form of gambling, according to Don Hunter.
  He would rather see a man sit down to poker and play for a living than to see
  him wallowing around like a badger, digging holes in a sidehill looking for
  wealth.</p>

  <p>Bill had done a great deal of pecking and prying, up this wash and that.
  He believed he knew where the float had come from, but there seemed to be an
  overburden of soil, probably the result of some beating storm and consequent
  slide, which had covered the ledge that had at one time been an outcropping.
  It was slow, tedious work, but Bill was a patient man. Prospectors have to
  learn patience, or quit the game.</p>

  <p>Flaunting desert lilies, dainty blue bells, the deep magenta bloom of the
  cacti gave way to the tiny pink and pale lavender blossoms that cling close
  to the arid soil. The sky was brazen with heat, or it turned deep shades of
  slate as the thunderheads poked over Parowan and rumbled warningly at the
  desert. Bill worked on through the hot days and practised scales and simple
  melodies in the evening, and quarreled with Luella and confided to her many
  things which he would not want repeated.</p>

  <p>One sultry evening he brought into camp several pieces of rock and held
  them where Luella could gaze upon certain telltale, yellow specks. Bill's
  perspiring face glowed. His eyes were dancing with something akin to
  mirth.</p>

  <p>"We've struck it, old girl! What I've been looking for all this while.
  Biggest thing yet, from the looks. We're <i>rich</i>, I tell you! Doggone,
  thundering rich! You watch Parowan go on the map. Biggest thing in the
  country. If I showed that rock in Goldfield, they'd be down here like flies."
  He laid the rock down and broke a dry stick across his knee, meaning to start
  a fire. But he was excited and kept on talking,&mdash;now definitely to
  Luella, now to himself.</p>

  <p>"It's the kind of thing I've been hunting. I knew it should be here
  somewhere. This district is entitled to a big mine. It's got all the
  earmarks. I've got her traced, now. That rock is in place, or I'm a Chinaman.
  I tell you, old girl, we're rich! I've got a nugget in my shirt pocket that I
  didn't show you, for fear you might swallow it."</p>

  <p>"Aw, cut it out!" Luella snapped at him. She was a pessimistic bird, as a
  rule.</p>

  <p>Bill burrowed deeper and found more gold. Rock so rich that he could break
  it up by hand and pan it in the spring, and glean gold enough for another
  grubstake, more equipment. He was in no great hurry to proclaim his fortune
  to the world, and he did not mean to show himself in town until his grub was
  gone. Then he would make a trip, buy more supplies, perhaps hire a man if he
  could find one whom he could trust. He did not want the harpies to know about
  Parowan,&mdash;yet.</p>

  <p>He relieved his inner excitement by talking to Luella, and by tootling on
  the saxophone and dreaming of Doris Hunter, who did not seem quite so
  unattainable, now that he had found the mine he had wanted to find and was
  proving it richer than his most lavish expectations.</p>

  <p>With the first discovery he had put up his location notices on three
  claims, calling them simply Parowan Number One, Parowan Number Two and
  Parowan Number Three. And in compliment to the girl of his dreams he had
  located another, called it the Evening Star and signed Doris Hunter's name as
  the locator. Which is a chivalrous custom observed quite commonly among
  prospectors.</p>

  <p>He did the location work on all four claims, put up the corner and
  side-line monuments required by law, and then, having eaten most of his
  supplies, he cached the remainder and started for Goldfield, his mind at
  ease, his heart singing and his lips wearing an unconscious half-smile all
  the way.</p>

  <p>It was in Goldfield, while Bill was in the recorder's office, that the
  news leaked out where it shouldn't. Luella, like others of her sex, began
  talking, inspired by an audience of four men, one of whom was Jim Lambert,
  who had betrayed some curiosity over Bill Dale's affairs when Bill was last
  in town.</p>

  <p>"Bill Dale's outfit. Hello, Luella," Jim greeted.</p>

  <p>Luella looked down at him, seemed to recall having seen him before, and
  began her pigeon-toed march up and down Wise One's spinal column.</p>

  <p>"Boy, we've struck it rich!" she began, chuckling in vivid imitation of
  Hopeful Bill's tone when he was particularly pleased. "Got her traced now.
  Richest thing in Nevada. Goldfield can't show stuff like this. Tell you, old
  girl, we're rich! Doggone, thunderin' rich! Can't tell anybody. Don't want a
  boom. Git a move on! They'd be down here like flies. Hez! Hez'll have a gold
  collar. Gold perch for you. Luck's turned; luck's patting us on the back."
  Luella laughed, then, just as Bill laughed.</p>

  <p>Jim and his three companions had stood perfectly still, listening. Jim
  turned his head and looked at the others, who stared back at him
  inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Inside dope, boy, believe me." Jim plucked the nearest man by the sleeve.
  "Bill Dale's parrot has give us the real dope on Bill, if you want my
  opinion. Come on. We'll lay low, and I'll feel Bill out. He's
  inside&mdash;recording claims, I'll bet. Anyway, I've got a claim to record,
  come to think of it. I'll git all I can outa the recorder. Bill Dale's parrot
  has tipped Bill's hand. I'll see the recorder."</p>

  <p>They went away. Five minutes later, Bill came down the steps to his burros
  and discovered Luella toeing it up and down, up and down, practising new sets
  of words.</p>

  <p>"Bill Dale's parrot has tipped Bill's hand. I'll see the recor'," she
  muttered, over and over.</p>

  <p>"You damned huzzy," Bill reproved her, when he had got the full
  significance of her speech. He picked up Wise One's lead rope and went
  thoughtfully down to the store.</p>

  <p>"We'll lay low," Luella continued, bobbing her head as Wise One's empty
  pack swayed and lurched under her feet. "Come on. We'll lay low. I'll feel
  Bill out. Bill Dale's parrot has tipped Bill's hand. I'll see the
  recor-r'&mdash;&mdash;" She worried over the final syllable that defeated her
  powers of enunciation.</p>

  <p>Bill looked back at her speculatively. At the store, the first thing he
  asked for was a large, pasteboard carton. Having found one which he thought
  would do, he plucked Luella unceremoniously off her perch and shut her up,
  with the box lid tied firmly in place with much heavy twine.</p>

  <p>"Fellow tried to steal her, last time I was in," he explained
  good-humoredly. "She's a pet I'd hate to lose. I'll give you a dollar if
  you'll let me put her away somewhere till I'm ready to leave town."</p>

  <p>"Sure! Keep the dollar, though. It ain't any trouble&mdash;if you feed her
  yourself." Bill was a good customer. He bought largely when he did buy, and
  he never hinted at credit; which was more than could be said of most
  prospectors.</p>

  <p>"Wait! I'll just put the turtle in with her. Then she'll be more at home,
  and won't try to break out." Bill went out and returned, swinging a headless,
  footless, tailless mass of gray turtle insouciantly by the string. "Bunch of
  boys was after Sister Mitchell too, last time," he observed. "I hate to have
  trouble, and I can't always keep an eye on things in town. Got quite a lot of
  running around to do."</p>

  <p>He carried the turtle to the back of the store, opened the box and slid
  her in with little ceremony.</p>

  <p>"What the hell!" Luella ejaculated, but Bill slipped on the cover and left
  her in darkness, so that Luella subsided into throaty mutterings. She never
  talked in the dark, as Bill knew very well.</p>

  <p>"How's prospecting?" the storekeeper asked when Bill returned. "Found
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I've got a dandy prospect," Bill confided, lowering his voice and
  glancing sidelong toward the door. "I want to do some more digging, though,
  before I throw up my hat. Just recorded three claims, as I came past the
  courthouse. I've got to go in on a lead, and I want the work to count as
  location work. In fact," he further elucidated, "I've recorded what work I've
  done as location. No use digging for nothing, and even if they don't pan out
  rich enough to pay now, so far from transportation, there's enough showing of
  mineral to pay for hanging on awhile."</p>

  <p>"Um-hmm." The storekeeper nodded. "Pity all prospectors don't take the
  pains to make sure uh what they got. They come in here blattin' about their
  strikes&mdash;and want more grub on credit. I used to fall for it. What's
  your claims? Gold?"</p>

  <p>"Showing of gold," Bill told him unhesitatingly. "The formation entitles
  me to gold, too, so that's what I'm looking for. Here's a piece of rock. Take
  a look at it."</p>

  <p>The storekeeper tilted the specimen to the light and squinted. Bill
  obligingly lent him a miner's glass, and with his finger pointed to a certain
  spot on the sample. "Right there&mdash;at the edge of that iron stain;
  there's a speck of color."</p>

  <p>"Mh-hmm&mdash;yeah&mdash;I see it. Well, it's good, live-lookin' rock,
  Bill. I think you're wise to dig into it." He returned the sample, weighing
  it in his mind as he held it out.</p>

  <p>"I'm keeping quiet about it&mdash;to outsiders," Bill said, dropping the
  rock into his pocket again. "Don't want any stampede. But I do want a couple
  more burros, and a hundred pounds of powder, and four boxes of Six-X caps,
  and five hundred feet of fuse. If you can get me all the stuff I need, and
  get the two extra burros packed and headed down the trail with orders for the
  fellow to camp and wait till I show up, I'll make it right with you. This
  town's got big ears and big eyes. And&mdash;you can maybe remember why I hate
  boom stampedes that don't pan out. I'll give you ten per cent. on every
  dollar's worth of stuff and the cost of the burros you get to&mdash;say to
  Hick's Hot Spring for me, and twenty-five dollars for a good, trusty man that
  can swing a single-jack and throw a mess of sour-dough bread together."</p>

  <p>The storekeeper ruminated.</p>

  <p>"Why, I'll do it for nothing, Bill. You're a good customer, and if you do
  make a strike I guess I won't lose your trade by treating you white. Trade's
  slidin' into the credit class more'n what I like to see. You're hard cash
  when you buy. Just give me your order, and I'll fill it. And what's more,
  I'll keep my damn mouth shut. And glad to accommodate yuh, Bill."</p>

  <p>"Say, you're a white man!" Bill looked full at him and grinned
  appreciation. But he did not confide further in the storekeeper,
  nevertheless. "Don't let anybody hang around my pets, and don't say who's to
  own the burros. You buy 'em, and I'll buy 'em from you, same as I do bacon.
  And be careful, pickin' that man, will yuh? I want one that can swing
  something besides his tongue."</p>

  <p>"I getcha, Bill. How about booze?"</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;if he can do without for a month or two at a stretch. I
  don't pack any jugs into the desert, as you maybe know."</p>

  <p>"That's why I asked. Town's full of good men, but they are mostly
  booze-punishers. Well&mdash;how long you expect to be in town?"</p>

  <p>"Just until I'm hooked up with what I need."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I can get yuh out to-morrow, maybe."</p>

  <p>"Just in case you happen to run shy,&mdash;&mdash;" Bill wrote a check on
  a Reno bank and handed it over. "Any balance, either way, we'll straighten up
  before I leave."</p>

  <p>He purloined a handful of withered lettuce leaves and dropped them into
  the box for Sister Mitchell and Luella, and went out to idle here and there
  through town and discover, if he could, just how much damage Luella had done
  to his plans.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; GOOD, LIVELY PROSPECT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JIM LAMBERT had known Bill Dale since the beginning of the
  boom that had broken Bill's father,&mdash;broken him mentally and
  financially. Jim was a broker in Goldfield and sold real estate and
  underwrote fire insurance as a side line. Lately, the side line had become
  the chief industry, since mines had begun to close down and adventurers were
  drifting on to later excitements.</p>

  <p>Bill did not care much for Jim Lambert. Although he never troubled to
  explain to himself his indifference that edged close to dislike, he had no
  definite distrust of the man. Yet Jim Lambert had been active in his father's
  Myrtle Mine boom and had professed to suffer when the bubble burst. Bill's
  father had complained vaguely that Jim Lambert was largely responsible for
  the bursting of the bubble, but Bill had not paid much attention to that
  talk. He knew his dad too well. His dad always blamed some one for his
  misfortunes,&mdash;some one other than himself. Bill's nature was built of
  stiffer material. When his plans went wrong, Bill set all his energies to
  work planning the next move and wasted little thought upon the reason for his
  last failure; unless, to be sure, in that reason lay his safety in the
  future. Thus, Bill flatly refused to help his father play the game of
  find-the-guilty-party. He went to work and earned and saved all he could out
  of it, and when he had enough to keep him going for five years, he set out
  deliberately to spend that five years in finding a mine.</p>

  <p>Wherefore, Bill never did learn what part, if any, Jim Lambert had played
  in the failure of the Myrtle Mine. All he knew was that the mine had been
  attached and sold by its creditors, and his father had come out of it without
  a dollar. And he knew that he was not going to be caught that way when he had
  found his mine. He meant to steer clear of those speculating crooks who
  managed to loot every enterprise they got hold of and still kept out of
  jail.</p>

  <p>Jim Lambert met Bill by accident&mdash;or so Bill believed. It was in the
  Great Northern bar, where Bill was treating himself to a glass of beer and a
  San Francisco paper in a quiet corner. Both were inexpressibly refreshing
  after his long exile, but Bill was not too engrossed to keep a quiet eye open
  for those who came and went, or remained to chat desultorily before the
  polished bar.</p>

  <p>He was waiting for some one to approach him. Some one did, presently, and
  that one was Jim Lambert. Jim brought his schooner of beer over and sat down
  opposite Bill, grinning goodfellowship while he wiped his perspiring
  brow.</p>

  <p>"Got baked out, eh? Must be pretty hot in the desert, now."</p>

  <p>"Fair," said Bill, and folded the paper for politeness' sake. "Still, it
  hasn't been so bad. The man that cusses the desert is the man that strikes
  out into it and thinks he'll hurry up and get it over with. The desert's all
  right&mdash;if you know how to take it."</p>

  <p>"I guess you're right. The old-timers don't seem to have much
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"Not unless they're drunk, or have an accident," Bill agreed, and took two
  slow, satisfying swallows of beer.</p>

  <p>"Well, how's she going? Hit that contact yet you were after?" Jim spoke
  over his beer mug carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Not yet. Been doing location work on three claims. Located first and
  planned to prospect more thoroughly afterwards." He set down the mug and
  reached into his pocket for the specimen he had shown to the storekeeper. It
  was not a good sample of his ore; it was, in fact, the "leanest" rock he
  could find. But he pushed it across the table with an air of subdued
  pride.</p>

  <p>Jim picked it up, testing its weight as he did so. Bill hooked his toes
  behind his chair legs and leaned forward expectantly, watching Jim Lambert's
  face. He thought he read there a shade of disappointment, and he leaned back
  satisfied. Luella, he told himself, did not talk to perfect strangers except
  when goaded to profanity by teasing. Jim she had seen many times.</p>

  <p>"Good, lively-looking rock," Jim said at last, repeating the storekeeper's
  comment. "Carries gold, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You bet! Here, take this glass and look right there at the point of that
  iron stain. It shows color, there, under the glass. When I get depth on that,
  it ought to show good values, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"How deep is this?" Jim turned the rock under the glass. "Looks to me like
  surface rock."</p>

  <p>"You're right. That's outcropping. If I had enough of it, I'll bet it
  would pay, just as she is. Or if it was close to a railroad, even."</p>

  <p>Jim did not reply. He was pretending to study the rock; in reality he was
  studying Bill Dale. Bill's optimism was a byword, to be sure; yet Jim fancied
  he saw a slight discrepancy between Bill's keen eyes and the easy hopefulness
  of his words. He missed somewhere the good-natured twinkle and the drawl.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's pretty good for surface rock," Jim said, when the silence
  became noticeable. "Nothing to get excited over, though, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"I should say not! It'll have to look better than that before I get
  excited."</p>

  <p>"Well, good luck to yuh, Bill. If you do get something good, let me know.
  I might be able to turn a deal for you. There's money in this town
  yet&mdash;if you can show something good enough. It's shy, but it's here.
  I'll be glad to help you out, any way I can."</p>

  <p>"Thanks." Bill's drawl was quite apparent now. "I'll sure remember, if I
  want to turn anything, later on."</p>

  <p>Jim looked at his watch and said he must go; a simple expedient for
  breaking off a conversation that has grown barren of interest, and one that
  can never be gainsaid. And Bill, having finished his beer to the dregs, went
  away also, quite satisfied in his mind.</p>

  <p>His satisfaction was not so keen as Jim's, however. Had Bill Dale tiptoed
  to the door of Jim's office, half an hour later, and put his ear to the
  keyhole, he might have heard himself being talked about.</p>

  <p>"He didn't get by, with me," Jim was saying positively. "Not for one
  minute. He showed me a piece of rock no better than you can pick up on any
  tailing dump in Goldfield, and claimed that was his best showing. It wasn't
  good enough to account for what that parrot of his let out. Remember? I
  jotted it down, first thing. Parrot talk is just parrot talk, but they don't
  invent nothing. They've got to hear it said before they'll say it. And if you
  might say Bill Dale was teaching it that stuff for fun, that don't sound
  reasonable&mdash;knowing Bill."</p>

  <p>He fumbled for a minute and brought out a little, soiled, red book.</p>

  <p>"Now here's what the parrot reeled off, and I'll gamble she got it
  straight. A man out alone by himself lets go and says what he really thinks.
  We all know that. Now, the parrot says, 'Boy, we've struck it rich! Got her
  traced now. Richest thing in Nevada. Goldfield can't show stuff like this.
  Tell you we're rich. Won't tell anybody&mdash;don't want a boom. Git a move
  on!' (That's something else, run in). 'They'd be down here like flies. Gold
  perch for you. Luck's turned. Luck's patting us on the back.'"</p>

  <p>He looked at his companions and grinned. "Don't tell me that wasn't picked
  up from Bill Dale's camp talk."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he taught the parrot that lingo just to <i>have</i> her spill it in
  town and start a rush," one tight-faced man said cautiously.</p>

  <p>Jim shook his head. "I saw him in the Great Northern&mdash;trailed him
  there. Most generally, when Bill's in town, he takes the parrot around with
  him, riding on his shoulder. She's a smart bird. Bill's proud of her and
  likes to show her off. Talks everything, just like a human; everything she
  hears and takes a notion to, that is. Well, he didn't have her with him
  to-day. He's left her somewhere. From the saloon he went into the barber
  shop. He's getting a haircut. Shave too, probably. Never saw him in a barber
  shop before without that green parrot. My guess is, he's afraid she'll let
  out something." Jim put the book back in his pocket with a self-satisfied
  air. Men who live by their wits are usually a bit vain of their
  shrewdness.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you're right, he got scared too late to do any good," chuckled a
  jovial, round little man with one eye milky from cataract.</p>

  <p>"He was just coming into town. Leaving her in the street for five minutes,
  up there at the courthouse, would look safe enough to anybody. It's just luck
  we happened along."</p>

  <p>"Well, now, how's it to help <i>us</i>?" The tight-faced man had brown
  eyes that stared intently, as do the near-sighted. He leaned forward,
  bringing the conference to a point.</p>

  <p>Four heads went together, at that, and if Bill had been listening at the
  keyhole he wouldn't have heard much. They were a careful quartette, and they
  had worked in harmony through the complexities of several "deals."</p>

  <p>Bill saw Jim Lambert again the next day. Jim was in the store, looking
  boredly impatient to be served. The storekeeper's signal to Bill, of tilted
  head and lowered eyelid did not pass unobserved. Bill followed him back among
  the piled boxes of canned goods, and Jim idled over to a pile of overalls and
  inspected them carefully while he tried to listen.</p>

  <p>He did not hear as much as he desired, and much that he did hear was
  irrelevant. There was something about two burros leaving last night. Then,
  after some mumbling, he caught the storekeeper's earnest assurance,
  "&mdash;all right when he's sober. Just off a big drunk, so he's good for
  three months, anyway. Tommy's an old, hard-rock man; all around good guy if
  he takes a notion to yuh. And I got him cheap for yuh. Three dollars and
  found."</p>

  <p>Jim Lambert could not guess what Tommy this might be, but he was glad to
  know that Bill was hiring a man by the underground route, and that Tommy
  liked whisky. Working through the storekeeper meant only one thing; the need
  of absolute secrecy. Which provided wonderful illumination for a man like Jim
  Lambert.</p>

  <p>Jim moved carelessly back to the front of the store and was giving his
  order to the clerk when Bill emerged, carrying a spiteful-tongued parrot on
  one finger. Bill grinned a greeting at Jim.</p>

  <p>"Say, 'Hello, Jim,'" he instructed Luella in his coaxing tone.</p>

  <p>Luella's reply was just barely printable when the editor's sense of humor
  is keener than his puritanism. Luella blinked and said, "You damned hussy,
  git a move on!"</p>

  <p>"She's peevish," Bill apologized. "She's getting such a darned nuisance in
  town I had to shut her up. Now you listen to me, old girl. Back you go in the
  box, if you don't behave. Be quiet&mdash;you know I mean it."</p>

  <p>Luella turned and walked up Bill's arm to his shoulder, and leaned forward
  to click her beak against his neck. "Lord, what a world!" she murmured, and
  began daintily to eat half a banana which Bill gave her.</p>

  <p>Jim Lambert took his few small packages and went out, and Bill saw him no
  more. Which does not mean that Jim ceased to take an interest in Bill Dale's
  prosperity and personal affairs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; STRANGERS IN CAMP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FROM beside a camp fire at the springs which Bill Dale had
  designated as the rendezvous, an undersized, ape-bodied individual rose and
  goggled up at Bill through thick-lensed spectacles that magnified his eyelids
  grotesquely.</p>

  <p>"Hello," said Bill, looking down at him whimsically. "Is this the outfit
  the Goldfield Supply Company sent out?"</p>

  <p>"An' if ye'll tell me what business it might be uh yoors, I c'd maybe say
  yis er no to that," the undersized one retorted, raising his voice at the end
  of the sentence as if it were a question.</p>

  <p>"All right, Tommy. You'll do, I reckon. I'm Bill Dale, and if I'm not
  mistaken you'll be looking to me for your pay."</p>

  <p>"An' from the look of ye I'll be earnin' that same," Tommy suggested
  drily.</p>

  <p>Bill lifted Luella and Sister Mitchell off Wise One, and began to unlash
  the heavy pack, Tommy helping him. The two studied each other with covert
  interest; Tommy seeking to discover whether Bill Dale would make a good boss,
  one easy to work for, which, next to the security of his pay, is a laborer's
  chief consideration. Bill measured Tommy shrewdly as a man who would
  work&mdash;and gossip. A man who could be loyal to the last gasp, but a man
  who might easily choose to be disloyal. He was a garrulous little Irishman,
  was Tommy; a man of indeterminate age and of problematic usefulness. But Bill
  was not inclined to carp. He was content to give Tommy a trial, which was as
  much as the best man could justly expect.</p>

  <p>If Tommy had received any hint of the probable value of Bill's claims, he
  gave no sign of knowing. Until he slept he sat cross-legged by the fire and
  stared into the flames through his thick-lensed glasses, and regaled Bill
  with choice anecdotes culled from his past,&mdash;that endless, obvious
  odyssey of the common laborer whose world is bounded by his "job." His voice
  was a soft, complaining monotone saturated with the eternal vague question.
  Never did his inflection fall to a period. At a distance which would blur the
  words of his speech, his voice would inevitably give one the impression that
  Tommy was asking one reproachful question after another, with never a
  statement to relieve the endless inquiry.</p>

  <p>Bill was amused, but he was also convinced that Tommy would presently
  become a bore. He was interested to note that Luella preserved a dignified
  silence all through the evening. One yellow eye on the latest recruit, she
  sat humped upon the crotch of a packsaddle with her green feathers ruffled
  moodily, still sulking over her incarceration with Sister Mitchell.</p>

  <p>At Parowan, whither they arrived one sultry afternoon with a smell of rain
  in the air, Tommy went to work like an old hand on the desert. Bill watched
  him unobtrusively and decided that the storekeeper had shown pretty good
  judgment. While they were unpacking the burros, Tommy cocked an eye at the
  sullen clouds that tore themselves on Parowan Peak only to mend immediately
  and crowd lower down the slope, and began gathering heavy rocks which he
  piled in a row on the lower edge of Bill's tent, and to test the guy ropes
  and drive the pegs deeper.</p>

  <p>"She's a cloud-burst comin', er I never seen wan," he observed
  complainingly, when he was again lugging the supplies into the tent. "Them
  taties c'd stay outside, but watter will cause the bacon t' mold, Mr. Dale.
  An' beans is never the same, wancet they've been wrinkled wit' rain watter
  an' dried agin. I dunno, but that's been my experience wit' grub. I'd git it
  all under cover, if it was mine, Mr. Dale."</p>

  <p>"Does look bad, for a fact," Bill admitted. "I was going up to the
  workings; but I reckon we'd better make camp snug. Now, Hez, what'll happen
  if you bust a lung? What's on your fool mind?"</p>

  <p>Hez appeared to have a good deal on his mind. Presently his excitement was
  explained by four loaded burros laboring up the draw, followed by three men
  who hurried the animals up the uneven slope. Bill frowned when he saw them,
  wondering if they had followed him.</p>

  <p>But the men were strangers to him. If they came from Goldfield, he
  thought, they must have hurried,&mdash;because Bill himself had made the trip
  in record time. He nodded as they came up, and sent the impolite Hezekiah
  into the tent with his hindquarters drooping guiltily. Two of the men had the
  look of mining engineers (for your desert dwellers learn to judge a man's
  profession by the way he dresses and carries himself on the desert). The
  third, who evidently had charge of the burros, had "desert rat" written all
  over him.</p>

  <p>"Spring up here still workin', mister?" the burro driver asked in a flat
  voice raised shrilly by way of attaining some volume. "Used to be a spring up
  here."</p>

  <p>"The spring is still there," Bill replied neutrally.</p>

  <p>A pleasant, short man came forward, smiling and holding out his hand,
  never doubting his welcome.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you, sir. My name is Rayfield; Walter B. Rayfield. My
  partner, here, is John S. Emmett, a mining expert of whom you may have heard,
  if you're the mining man you look to be. Working for the government, making a
  report of the gold, silver and copper possibilities of Nevada. I examine the
  country for gold and silver, and Emmett, here, takes care of the copper
  report. We've been allotted what is called the Furnace Creek quadrangle.
  We're working the northern part first, so as to have cooler weather for the
  Death Valley neighborhood."</p>

  <p>"Glad to meet you." Bill's handshake was cordial, with a certain reticence
  behind it. Happy-go-lucky as he seemed, Bill Dale was slow in choosing his
  friends, while acquaintances never got below the surface of his mind. "My
  name is Dale; Bill for short, Hopeful Bill for sarcasm. You're just ahead of
  a big storm, by the looks, Mr. Rayfield."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it does look like rain." Mr. Rayfield glanced at the heavy clouds
  that were now hiding the peak. "We expect to camp here for a while, if the
  spring is all right. Glad to have a neighbor. Most of the time we have to put
  up with our own company. Well, Al, suppose you find a place for camp. You'll
  have to hustle, my man, if we're to get our tents up before it rains."</p>

  <p>"You've a nice little camp here," the man introduced as Emmett observed,
  his hard brown eyes taking in the surroundings appraisingly. It's certainly a
  great view you have here. We saw your tent from miles away, down there."</p>

  <p>"You came from Vegas way, then," Bill stated calmly. From that direction
  only could they see his camp from any distance; the Goldfield trail twisted
  around the mountain.</p>

  <p>"We started from Las Vegas. We've been out some time, though. Came down
  Forty Mile Canyon to the main road and followed that as far as we could." He
  pulled a pipe from his pocket and began filling it in leisurely fashion from
  a leather pouch while his gaze traveled sophisticatedly over the surrounding
  hills.</p>

  <p>"Prospecting, I suppose?" His eyes came back to Bill's face. His tone had
  the casual note of one who wishes to be civil.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a little," Bill replied guardedly. Even to research men he did not
  feel like telling all he knew. "She's a hard country to prospect in, though.
  Too much overburden. But I like the formation here. Seems to me there's a
  chance here to run on to something, if a fellow keeps right after it."</p>

  <p>"I see already why they call you Hopeful Bill," Mr. Emmett grinned over
  his pipe. "I don't think it's sarcasm, though." He gave another professional
  glance at the rough outcroppings near them. "Looks pretty fair, but my
  specialty is copper. Doesn't seem very promising for that&mdash;but one never
  can tell. You're looking for gold, I take it. That's more in Rayfield's
  line."</p>

  <p>"I'm looking for anything I can find," Bill corrected lazily. "Anything
  from gold to diamonds; just so there's money in it."</p>

  <p>The fitful breeze died suddenly to an ominous, stifling calm. The copper
  expert glanced up at the slatey mass moving up from the west and went to help
  the others set up the tent before the storm broke.</p>

  <p>"Want any help?" Bill called after him. But Mr. Emmett shook his head,
  waved a hand and went on.</p>

  <p>Tommy, who had retreated into the tent as the party drew near, pushed his
  head through the opening and goggled at the group fifty yards away. They were
  spreading a wall tent, preparing to make camp in the lee of a rocky ledge.
  Tommy wiped the tobacco stain from his lips with the back of his hand and
  glanced sidelong up at Bill.</p>

  <p>"That's Al Freeman they got wit' 'em," he drawled in his complaining,
  questioning way. "An' how he c'd git wit' 'em I dunno, fer I left him in
  Goldfield&mdash;I did&mdash;and him owin' me tin dollars and denying all
  knowledge of that same. He's a liar an' a t'ief, Mr. Dale, an' them that
  trusts him is like t' find their t'roats cut some marrnin' an' their pockets
  turned out.</p>

  <p>"How he got to Las Vegas t' join up with these fellers I dunno&mdash;fer
  he was in Goldfield whin I left, and there can't be two of 'im&mdash;an' the
  devil wit' his hands full a'ready just wit' wan of 'im. I'd tip off them
  gov-ment men, Mr. Dale, I sure would. He's worse ner a rattler in camp, an'
  he's the kind that'll lie wit' 'is ears open an' then run an' make bad use o'
  what he hears, Mr. Dale. He's a durrty claim-robber fer wan t'ing, an' if
  yuh've got annything here wort' robbin', Mr. Dale, yuh'd best set yer tent
  over it whilst Al Freeman's on the mountain. It's the Gawd's trut' I tellin'
  yuh&mdash;an' yuh better slip them experts the word&mdash;though how he got
  wit' 'em I dunno, fer I left him in Goldfield; I did that!"</p>

  <p>"That's mighty queer," Bill assented dubiously. "If you're sure of that,
  we'll step lightly till we know the bunch better. Keep your eye on him,
  Tommy, until I find out more about it. They won't get that tent up in time to
  save a wetting; I can see that right now."</p>

  <p>The man Tommy said was Al had unpacked one burro, but it was certain they
  would not have time to make themselves even passably comfortable. Even now
  the tent they were erecting was bellying like a balloon in a sudden blast of
  wind, and while they struggled with it pegs and guy ropes snapped loose. The
  short man, whose name was Rayfield, evidently made a suggestion. All three
  looked toward Bill's camp. Then, as the earth quivered under a deafening
  crash of thunder, Al hurriedly tied the burros to a couple of stunted
  junipers, wadded the tent hastily into an ungainly bundle and thrust it
  between two rocks.</p>

  <p>Heads down against the wind, holding their hats on with both hands, they
  came running. Bill opened the tent flaps and held it against the wind until
  the strangers and Tommy were inside. Then he double-tied the flaps and
  turned, grinning hospitably. His twelve-by-fourteen tent was more than
  comfortably full now, what with the piles of supplies, Bill's stove and table
  and bed, and the five men. But it was a shelter, set shrewdly against just
  such an emergency as this storm. It faced away from the wind, and a ledge
  protected it from the full force of the gale.</p>

  <p>Thunder, lightning, wind&mdash;then an abrupt silence, a holding of the
  breath. Tommy, crouched down in his corner, his shoulder held carefully away
  from the canvas wall, stared owl-like through his thick glasses.</p>

  <p>"She's comin'," he mumbled dolefully.</p>

  <p>She came. All the water in the clouds seemed to have been dumped
  unceremoniously upon the tent. A fine mist beat through the roof and sides
  until warp and woof became saturated, and shrunk to a waterproof texture that
  sent the water running off in streams.</p>

  <p>"She's a cloud-burst&mdash;I said she'd be a cloud-burst!" Tommy muttered
  again in melancholy triumph.</p>

  <p>"You didn't get here any too soon," Bill observed cheerfully. "It would be
  pretty tough, climbing through this. You're lucky."</p>

  <p>"We certainly are!" Mr. Rayfield's voice was raised almost to a shout, to
  carry above the storm. "Wouldn't want to be caught out in this!"</p>

  <p>They sat and listened to it,&mdash;the boom and crash of the thunder, the
  vivid flashes that lightened blindingly the gloom of the tent, the roar of
  the falling water.</p>

  <p>"She's a tough one, all right!" Bill rose and pried open the flaps with
  his fingers, and put an eye to the crack. "Now I know how old Noah felt when
  he shut the door of the ark. Nothing in sight but water&mdash;good Lord!"</p>

  <p>Something sagged against the tent, beat upon the taut canvas. A voice was
  raised shrilly, frantically.</p>

  <p>"Bill! Oh, Bill! Let me in!"</p>

  <p>Bill's face had whitened at the first sound. His fingers clawed at the
  stiff, canvas knots that held the flaps shut. His hands, reaching out to
  loosen the outside fastenings, touched other fingers that tore nervously at
  the soaked knots. Bill was hampered by those other fingers, as a swimmer is
  hampered by the frenzied clutchings of a drowning man. But he managed the two
  lower fastenings and was beginning on the upper when the person outside
  stooped and ducked in past Bill's knees.</p>

  <p>"Doris&mdash;&mdash; Miss Hunter! What&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's perfectly <i>awful</i>! I thought I'd never make it, Bill. I
  couldn't make the horses face it, so I tied them down the gulch and came on
  afoot. I could see your tent when it lightened&mdash;I'm just <i>soaked</i>!
  It's the worst storm this year."</p>

  <p>She was talking in gasping little rushes of words, talking because she
  must have some emotional outlet. Her hat had gone in the wind, and she wiped
  the water from her face with quick, impatient brushes of her palms outward
  from her nose. Her hair was wet as a drowned woman's, and as lank about her
  face and shoulders. She wore a khaki riding skirt and a striped cotton blouse
  that clung to her shoulders and arms like wet paper. Her high-laced boots
  squelched soppily when she moved. Had she been pulled from a river she could
  not have been wetter.</p>

  <p>"Tommy, start a fire in the stove; you're the closest," Bill commanded.
  "Miss Hunter, let me introduce some other storm birds&mdash;only they were
  luckier than you were. They beat it in. This is Mr. Rayfield, and Mr.
  Emmett&mdash;both government experts making an examination of the country for
  mineral. That's Al Freeman over there; working for them" (Mr. Rayfield looked
  surprised) "and Tommy, over there by the stove, is going to work for me. Get
  over there in the corner and dry out. It'll be hot in a minute. You must be
  chilled."</p>

  <p>The men moved back to leave clear passage to the stove, and she hurried
  toward it, nodding to them shyly as she went. Mr. Rayfield smiled upon her
  benignantly and drew a box from under the table for her to sit on.</p>

  <p>"Take off those wet boots, Miss Hunter, and put your feet in the oven," he
  commanded, in the same tone which he might have used to his own daughter. "A
  cup of coffee will take the chill out of your bones. My, my! I've heard that
  it could rain pitchforks in this country, but nobody mentioned raining
  angels!" His own hearty laugh robbed the remark of any offensive familiarity,
  as he picked a blanket off the bunk&mdash;disturbing Mr. Emmett and Al
  Freeman to do so&mdash;and laid it matter-of-factly upon her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Here, let me unlace your boots. Tommy, get the coffee pot working." Bill
  knelt and reverently lifted her small, booted foot to his knee. "Mr. Emmett,
  if you'll pass that war-bag over here, I'll dig up some dry socks. And if
  you'll remember to hold out your arms, Miss Hunter, so you won't fall in outa
  sight, I'll lend you a pair of my boots. Or maybe we could tie a loop under
  your arms and hitch you somehow. Anyway, we'll fix you up comfortably as we
  can.</p>

  <p>Miss Hunter laughed, which was exactly what Bill had intended that she
  should do. If every little happy nerve in his big body tingled while he
  unlaced her boots, that was his own business and none of his neighbors'. He
  did not mean to have Doris Hunter experience one moment's embarrassment if he
  could help it.</p>

  <p>With a fine tact for which Bill was silently grateful, the two government
  men resumed their casual talk of the storm and of the desert,&mdash;the small
  talk of the region which is useful for filling in the awkward spots in
  strange situations. Tommy busied himself with a ham, a few cans and the
  coffee pot, and said not a word. Al Freeman, over by the door, made himself
  as inconspicuous as possible,&mdash;perhaps for reasons which Tommy could
  guess.</p>

  <p>Bill casually turned his back upon Miss Hunter and the stove and stood
  there with his hands in his pockets and his legs slightly apart, throwing a
  sentence now and then into the talk of the others.</p>

  <p>Thus hidden away in the corner, ignored for the time being, Doris Hunter
  pulled the blanket tighter around her slim person, and fumbled within its
  shelter. She was a sensible girl, and she had lived all of her twenty years
  on the edge of the desert, and knew nothing much about cads and crooks. So
  presently her khaki skirt was spread over her knees to dry, and she was
  holding the blanket open to dry the rest of her. And not a man of the five
  noticed the skirt, or paid any attention to her whatever.</p>

  <p>But when Tommy said supper was ready, Bill moved from his position as
  screen, and pulled up a box to hold the girl's plate and cup so that she
  could eat without moving away from the stove. It was casually done; so
  casually that it would not have cost a nun the quiver of an eyelash.
  Certainly Miss Hunter felt no confusion, for presently she was chatting quite
  as composedly as if she were at home with her family around her.</p>

  <p>It rapidly grew dark, the lightning coming at more infrequent intervals as
  the downpour continued. Bill found a lantern, lighted it and hung it on a
  wire hook from the ridgepole, where it swayed to the spasmodic shuddering of
  the tent. Miss Hunter turned and turned her skirt, and Bill watched her boots
  that they did not dry too quickly. There seemed nothing unusual in this
  foregathering, which was but one more incident of the wilderness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; BILL GROWS SENTIMENTAL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"BILL, you haven't asked me if I were lost or just going
  somewhere," Miss Hunter accused suddenly, setting down her cup which she had
  twice emptied of coffee. "You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Any one else
  would have asked me that before I got the water out of my eyes."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;are you lost, or just going somewhere?" Bill inquired
  obediently. "I've known this young lady a good long while," he added to the
  others, glad of the opportunity. "She rides the range right alongside her
  dad, and can sling a pack or rope a critter better than lots of men that draw
  wages for doing it. She couldn't get lost to save her neck. Looking for cow
  brutes or horses, Miss Hunter?"</p>

  <p>"Neither one. And don't call me Miss when I've been Doris all my life.
  These gentlemen don't demand the starch in your speech, and I know it. Dad
  sent me over to see if you'd come and help him out for awhile. He's going to
  run the water by a tunnel through that little ridge back of the corrals, and
  water the lower meadow directly from the spring. It will save at least an
  inch" (she referred to a miner's inch of water, which is a cubic measurement)
  "that's lost now in seepage as it's carried around the hill.</p>

  <p>"He's been sort of looking for you over to the ranch. But you didn't show
  up, so he sent me over to see if you'd drive the tunnel for him. He thinks
  your cautious disposition will make the blasting safe for the cattle, I
  reckon. Anyway, that's what I came for, and the storm did the rest. I guess
  the horses will be all right, but if they ever get loose they'll beat it for
  home&mdash;and that will worry the folks. I brought old Rambler with my camp
  outfit, and of course I rode Little Dorrit."</p>

  <p>"My, my, if some of the young ladies back in Washington could hear you
  talk so calmly of traveling the desert alone with your own camp outfit!" Mr.
  Rayfield pursed his lips and then smiled at her. Mr. Rayfield was disfigured
  somewhat by a milky film over one eye, but for all that his face was a
  pleasant one that made friends for him easily.</p>

  <p>"If you folks can make out with a candle," said Bill, "I'll take the
  lantern and go see about the horses. I can bring them up closer to camp,
  maybe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll do nothing of the kind, Bill Dale. Don't you suppose I made sure
  they would stay tied? Or do you think I <i>like</i> to take a chance on being
  set afoot? I was, once. That was a plenty, thank you. You stay right where
  you are."</p>

  <p>Bill chuckled but declined to commit himself by any promise. Torrents of
  rain still pounded upon the roof with the hollow sound of a kettle-drum
  beaten at a distance. Like all the passionate outbursts in which Nature
  indulges throughout her desert lands, this was likely to be almost as brief
  as it was violent. Bill knew well the way of these sudden storms and did not
  worry over the immediate future. The present was sufficiently engrossing, and
  he was not loath to obey the command of his queen.</p>

  <p>Having Doris Hunter there beside his stove, her boots drying beside his
  fire, her eyes meeting his with a smile in them now and then, her voice a
  melody he loved against the drumming accompaniment of the storm, was like a
  dream come true. Never before had Doris Hunter come to his camp fire save in
  his most secret dreams. Never before had she needed him, felt the comfort of
  his presence, his protection. It was well that these men were all strangers
  to Bill,&mdash;else they might have read his secret in the shine of his eyes,
  the steady flush on his cheek bones, the smile that came twitching the
  corners of his lips at the slightest provocation.</p>

  <p>If Doris saw, she gave no sign. Outwardly Bill held himself rigidly to the
  usual friendliness of a man who has known a girl since she was a little thing
  just past babyhood, eager to ride on his shoulder with her heels drumming his
  chest. His manner was indulgent, almost paternal. He did not look at her
  often, he did not need to look at her; indeed, he did not dare. To know that
  she was there, close beside him, was like drinking wine.</p>

  <p>"Storm's letting up fast," he announced at length, his face raised, his
  eyes dwelling speculatively upon the roof. "I guess we're all tired enough to
  get under the covers&mdash;and I hope you won't take that as a hint to you
  fellows to go home to your own camp," he drawled meaningly. "I'll bunk with
  you to-night, Tommy, and let Miss Hunter have this tent. She's tired. I've
  caught her nodding twice in the last five minutes."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's just the heat," Doris protested briskly. "I&mdash;really, Bill,
  I can't turn you out of your tent! I've my own outfit, you know, just down
  the gulch."</p>

  <p>"Yours isn't set up," Bill pointed out to her calmly. "These fellows got
  here some time before the storm broke. And Tommy has his tent, so it's not
  putting me out. I'll leave you Luella and Sister Mitchell and Hez for
  company. Oh, they're all at home," he answered her look of inquiry. "They
  hate rain, and they've hunted cover. Well, fellows?"</p>

  <p>Obediently the two experts turned toward the doorway. Al Freeman had
  already untied the flaps and ducked out into the dark and the drizzle. Mr.
  Rayfield apologized weakly for keeping late hours, and herded the sour-faced
  Emmett out before him. Bill waited until they were gone.</p>

  <p>"I want you to keep Hez inside," he told Doris then, his voice lowered.
  "These fellows are all right, probably, but I don't know them. And here's my
  gun. If you just call me, though, I'll hear and come a-running."</p>

  <p>He started out, then turned and smiled at her whimsically. "There's a
  bundle of new blankets in that corner," he informed her. "Never been opened
  up. Help yourself. Good night."</p>

  <p>Over by the junipers Bill could hear the mutter of voices. He turned that
  way and presently came upon the three, fumbling with wet pack ropes and
  swearing softly at the rain pattering down upon them. Talk ceased entirely
  when Bill approached.</p>

  <p>"Hard luck, folks," he sympathized cheerfully. "But not a darn bit harder
  than if you hadn't run across my camp at all. I'm sorry you got here so late.
  Want any help?"</p>

  <p>They did not, but Bill remained and did what he could to help them raise
  the wet tent and get their stuff inside. They would not be comfortable, but
  they would be quite as comfortable as he would be.</p>

  <p>"We've got some tent-raising to do ourselves," he told them cheerfully,
  when he could do no more. "It'll let up raining after a bit, I think. Come
  over to my camp for breakfast. I'll sling together some pancakes that'll melt
  in your mouths. And I've got a gallon of alleged maple syrup to swim 'em in.
  Life will look a thousand per cent. better, to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"Oh, life looks all right to us now," Mr. Rayfield protested. "This is
  nothing&mdash;nothing at all. Don't apologize, Mr. Dale. Of course the young
  lady needed the tent; wouldn't think of such a thing as&mdash;but we'll just
  call you on that breakfast bluff&mdash;pancakes, maple syrup and all!"</p>

  <p>"You're on," said Bill, and went back to help Tommy find his bedding and
  tent.</p>

  <p>Tommy was ignoring his own troubles in a chortling glee at Al Freeman's
  discomfort.</p>

  <p>"An' that's where he got 'is come-uppance," he gloated. "Al planned it t'
  bunk in a warrm tent wit'out settin' up his own t'night!" He tittered while
  he groped for ten pegs. "That tent-settin' b'foor the starrm was a farce, as
  you know yerself, Mr. Dale. He's up to something sure as yuh live&mdash;and
  phwat it is I dunno, but I sleeps wit' wan eye open this night&mdash;I
  do."</p>

  <p>It is likely that he did just that, as did Bill, lying so that he could
  peer out through the opening of Tommy's little tent and see his own bulking
  vaguely in the dark and drizzle. Hezekiah, shut inside, would have lunged at
  the throat of any stranger who sought entrance in the dark, and Doris Hunter
  did not need even that protection, since she probably carried her own gun and
  would know what use to make of it in an emergency.</p>

  <p>But Bill discounted those things and himself kept watch; and smiled for
  sheer happiness while he pulled Tommy's soggy blankets over his shoulders. In
  the dark, so close in the dark&mdash;serene in the knowledge of her safety,
  the girl he loved lay asleep, her head touching the pillow where his head had
  lain while he dreamed of her. To-morrow she would go again. All the
  to-morrows thereafter Bill would have only the memory of her presence here
  to-night. But to-night he could lie and know that she was there,&mdash;and
  what fool would waste the hours in sleep, when he might lie awake and think,
  and thrill at the sense of her nearness?</p>

  <p>He wondered what she would say when he showed her his gold discovery; told
  her, too that she owned a claim quite as good as his. He hoped that the
  deluge of rain had not filled his cut and covered his vein of rich ore. But
  even if it had, there were his samples in the corner of the tent behind the
  door; and it would not take him and Tommy long to uncover the vein again.</p>

  <p>He thought uneasily of the government men camped so close. Not that he was
  afraid of anything they might do; indeed, he could not imagine anything that
  could rob him now of his claims. He had located according to law, and his
  location work was done and on record in Goldfield. It was Al Freeman who
  troubled him; not alone because of what Tommy had said (he suspected Tommy of
  being an arrant gossip and not too gentle with men's reputations behind their
  backs) but because Al looked the sneak, acted the sneak, and undoubtedly was
  the sneak Tommy had declared him to be.</p>

  <p>Still, there was nothing a sneak could do to harm him. Even if he were
  killed,&mdash;he thought swiftly of something he must do, and he smiled
  tenderly at the grayish blotch in the drizzling dark. He must make his will,
  so that if anything happened to him, Doris would have the claims. There was
  no one else. His father had been the last relative he knew anything about.
  Distant ones&mdash;cousins&mdash;they didn't count.</p>

  <p>No, Doris Hunter stood closer to him than any one else. He wasn't going to
  die yet awhile, but still accidents <i>could</i> happen, he admitted to
  himself. There must be no slip-up, no last-minute regrets. Mining is always
  more or less risky. If he went out, then Doris must have the Parowan group.
  And as for the rest, Bill did not worry.</p>

  <p>He fell asleep finally, thinking that these experts might be able to give
  him some good advice. There was no sense in trying to keep his discovery a
  secret from them. They meant to examine Parowan's mineral possibilities, and
  they would inevitably run across his claims. But he would not be in too great
  a hurry. First, he would tell Doris. It seemed to him a miracle of good
  fortune that had brought her to Parowan at that particular time, when he was
  aching to tell her and yet could not leave his claims and let Al
  Freeman&mdash;yes, and perhaps Tommy as well&mdash;"high-grade" his gold the
  minute his back was turned. Now he could show Doris, which was better than
  telling. And&mdash;the world could go hang, for all Bill cared.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; WHAT DRIVES PROSPECTORS CRAZY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER all it was Doris Hunter who called breakfast while
  Bill was yet busy with her horses and Tommy was profanely spreading damp
  blankets upon dry rocks that would presently be hot to the palm, when the sun
  had stared down at them for a few hours.</p>

  <p>There were hot cakes as good as Bill could have made, and bacon and coffee
  and potatoes sliced raw and fried just right. The eyes of Mr. Rayfield
  glistened when he saw them, and Bill drew his underlip between his teeth when
  he looked at the girl's flushed face bent solicitously over the coffee she
  was pouring; it was so like a daydream come true that he could scarcely trust
  himself to speak, for fear his tone would not be so normal as he meant it to
  be. But he had his part to play nevertheless.</p>

  <p>"Morning! I meant to get breakfast myself, but I didn't want to get you
  out too early. You had a hard trip&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, fudge! That wasn't a commencement to being caught out in a blizzard.
  Luella woke me about daylight. She came crawling up on the pillow, and the
  first I heard was 'What the'&mdash;something&mdash;in the most surprised tone
  you ever heard." Doris laughed at the memory of it. "Imagine hearing a man's
  voice saying <i>that</i> in your very ear when you're dreaming about putting
  up peaches! And that reminds me, Bill. Mother sent over a jar of preserves.
  If you'll watch these cakes, I'll get them out of the pack. I saw you had
  brought up the horses. Sit right down and eat, folks, I won't be a
  minute."</p>

  <p>Bill's table was small, but Doris had somehow crowded a sufficient number
  of plates and cups upon it. Mr. Rayfield voiced his opinion of her efficiency
  as he seated himself on Bill's neatly spread bunk and drew the potatoes
  toward himself.</p>

  <p>"My, my, what a difference there is in women nowadays!" he said
  cheerfully. "Take these Western-raised girls&mdash;you can't match them
  anywhere in the world for downright common sense and capableness. Seems to be
  a great climate for the growth of brain. Now a city girl out in a storm like
  that&mdash;well," he chuckled, "think of the hundreds of plays and stories
  that have been built around the fainting forms of beautiful maidens carried
  in from right center, just rescued by the hero from the falling dew! And
  here's a girl can come out of it smiling, with a breakfast fit for a steel
  king! Mr. Dale, if you can beat these cakes, I'll resign from government
  employ and be your burro puncher for life!"</p>

  <p>Into the responsive laugh walked Doris with a quart jar of peach preserves
  carried proudly in her two hands.</p>

  <p>"I heard that about the cakes, Mr. Rayfield," she announced gravely. "And
  all I can say is, you come down to the ranch where we have real milk, and
  thick yellow cream, and fresh eggs. I'll show what hot cakes can be
  like!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Emmett, pulling a box out of a corner for a seat, had stooped and
  picked up something from the ground,&mdash;something which the edge of the
  box had dragged forward. He turned it to the side where the sun was shining
  brightly on the canvas wall and examined the piece of ore interestedly.</p>

  <p>"Good-looking rock, that," he observed, glancing up at Bill. "Didn't pick
  it up in this neighborhood, did you?"</p>

  <p>Bill slanted a glance at the rock, and another at the sly, watchful eyes
  of Al Freeman. Mr. Emmett was holding in his fingers a bit of the richest ore
  Bill had taken from his vein on Parowan Number One. He had concealed it under
  some sacks in the corner, and its appearance at the breakfast table was, to
  say the least, inopportune.</p>

  <p>"That? That's a specimen I've been packing around for luck," he said
  carelessly. "Wish I had a mountain of it; then I could have fresh eggs and
  cream for breakfast too."</p>

  <p>Mr. Emmett laid the rich specimen in Rayfield's outstretched hand and
  seated himself on the box, his hard, brown eyes glancing sharply now and then
  at Bill. Mr. Rayfield set down his cup of coffee and pursed his lips over the
  sample. His pleasant face glowed with professional admiration for a pretty
  bit of ore.</p>

  <p>"Yes-s&mdash;a mountain of that would insure a man against canned milk for
  life!" he chuckled. "If you had even a good vein of ore like that, Mr. Dale,
  your friends would need to pray that millions wouldn't make you
  money-mad."</p>

  <p>Doris held out her hand for it, and Mr. Rayfield smiled as he placed it in
  her palm. He did not say anything at all.</p>

  <p>Doris bent her brown head over the sample, then looked up quickly at Bill,
  her eyes wide and questioning.</p>

  <p>"O-oh&mdash;that's gold&mdash;<i>is</i> that gold, Bill? All those yellow
  patches? It&mdash;it doesn't look just like pyrites&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's gold, Doris." To save his life Bill could not have kept the
  tenderness, the deep exultation out of his voice.</p>

  <p>"Gold! Why, it&mdash;it's almost <i>solid</i> gold! Why,
  where&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bill pulled himself together, laughed lazily and helped himself to the
  fried potatoes.</p>

  <p>"That's what drives prospectors crazy," he drawled. "Looking for more of
  the same. You keep that, Doris, if you like it. If I ever get hold of enough
  of that, I'll call it a mine." He laughed again disarmingly. "You know folks
  call me Hopeful Bill," he added quaintly.</p>

  <p>"You'd be Sure-thing Bill, if you ever found a mine of <i>that</i>." Mr.
  Rayfield's good eye dwelt hungrily upon the sample. "I suppose you're on the
  trail of it. You wouldn't be human if you weren't looking for more of the
  same. Well, I hope you locate it. I do, for a fact. I know I wouldn't rest
  until I located that."</p>

  <p>Bill's laugh betrayed nothing more than amusement, but his eyes forgot to
  twinkle. They were fixed rather intently on Mr. Rayfield's smooth, smiling
  face.</p>

  <p>"And when you had it located&mdash;then what would you do?"</p>

  <p>"Do?" Mr. Rayfield looked up, astonished. "What <i>would</i> a man do,
  with a gold mine like that?" He returned to the spreading of peach preserves
  carefully between two hot cakes. "Organize a company and avail myself of the
  most modern methods of mining it. A good, clean corporation, Mr. Dale, is the
  most efficient, the most satisfactory methods I know of to-day. I certainly
  would organize at once and start out right to get the gold cheaply as
  possible and market the product as profitably as possible. There is no other
  intelligent method, these days."</p>

  <p>Mr. Emmett looked up dissentingly. "There you go on your hobby," he
  remarked. "The country's been done to death with wild-cat organizations that
  found a showing of mineral and hustled a corporation together. Look at the
  companies we've been sent to investigate, Walter! I should think that would
  sicken you of corporations."</p>

  <p>"We investigated a lot of crooked corporations, yes." Mr. Rayfield
  admitted it calmly. "We helped the government send more than one bunch of
  crooked officers to the penitentiary&mdash;where they belong. But crooks
  always will take advantage of the best machinery invented, John. And those
  very investigations taught me the details of organizing and operating
  corporations. They proved to me that a man is a fool to potter along by
  himself with any mine&mdash;I don't care how rich it is! You can't work a
  mine as you would a farm. Why? Because your potential harvest is all there,
  in the ground, waiting for you to gather it. A farm yields its wealth season
  by season&mdash;on the installment plan, we'll say. Whereas the mineral in a
  mine <i>is there</i>; all of it. It was put there long before it was ever
  discovered. The faster and the cheaper you take it out, the greater your
  profit. That stands to reason. What man of intelligence would spend ten,
  twenty years, we'll say, taking out a million dollars, when an efficient
  corporation will get it for him in less than half that time?"</p>

  <p>He held up his cup for more coffee and smiled blandly at Doris, who was
  listening to him with flattering attention.</p>

  <p>"Miss Hunter, you see the point, don't you? I'll venture to say that you'd
  want your millions dug out by machinery, in the shortest time possible."</p>

  <p>Doris laughed and looked again at the gold ore beside her plate.</p>

  <p>"If I knew where there was a lot of that in the ground, and you could get
  a million dollars worth of it out in fifteen minutes," she said,
  "I'd&mdash;why, I'd probably stand around and abuse you because you weren't
  getting my million in ten minutes instead of fifteen!" She blushed a little
  as she met Mr. Rayfield's understanding smile. "That's just human nature,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"That's human nature." Mr. Rayfield sugared his coffee with the satisfied
  air of a man who has gained his point with less difficulty than he had
  anticipated.</p>

  <p>Then appeared Luella, walking offendedly out from under Bill's bunk, where
  she had retreated from the presence of strangers.</p>

  <p>"Aw, cut it out!" Luella complained gruffly. "Let's eat! Git a move on,
  there!"</p>

  <p>"And here we are, trying to starve poor Luella!" Doris stooped to her, and
  the bird eyed her hand sidewise and decided to trust it for once. She stepped
  solemnly upon the slim, brown wrist and so was lifted to a perch on the foot
  of the bunk where she gravely accepted a slice of fried potato. The
  advantages of a corporation over an individual miner got no further attention
  from any one, for a parrot is very much like a baby in its unfailing ability
  to monopolize attention. Luella would not talk, save now and then a curt
  ejaculation that was hailed with laughter. She was a temperamental bird and
  her manners were inhospitable; for which Bill was vaguely thankful.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he was grateful when Doris proceeded as a matter of course to
  clear away the breakfast. That little hint of hers, of rising and picking up
  Bill's plate and cup, scattered the group. They went, ducking their heads
  under the flaps, and Bill followed them with the thought in his mind that he
  would see the three strangers safely off about their business before he made
  any move toward his own claims with Doris.</p>

  <p>But the jovial Mr. Rayfield stuck to him like a burr, talking idly of many
  things save mineral. Bill wondered what he had on his mind; and as soon as
  they were out of hearing of the others, Mr. Rayfield proceeded to the subject
  uppermost.</p>

  <p>"You'll pardon my apparent presumption, Mr. Dale, I know. We government
  fellows are instructed to help miners in any way we can, and&mdash;well, this
  man of yours; have you had him with you long enough to be sure of him?"</p>

  <p>"I never," said Bill in his easy drawl, "consider that I'm sure of any
  man. Why?" And then he gave no time for an answer, but put a question of his
  own.</p>

  <p>"How long have you had your pot-walloper?&mdash;if I may ask a question
  that's none of my business."</p>

  <p>"Al Freeman? We picked him up just the other day. Our cook that we hired
  in Las Vegas was taken sick just as we struck the highway down there. We laid
  over, and did what we could; but he wasn't recovering, so when this Al
  Freeman came along with three other men in a car, headed for Las Vegas, we
  just made an exchange. Sent our man in to a doctor, and hired Al in his
  place." He laid his fingers lightly on Bill's arm, and lowered his voice
  confidentially. "He told us last night that your man, Tommy, is one of the
  toughest men out of Goldfield. They call him Slippery Tom up there, I
  believe. Al says he came near getting lynched, at one time&mdash;some murder
  and robbery, I believe."</p>

  <p>"Then there's a pair of them," Bill observed imperturbably. "Al's a liar
  and a thief, according to Tommy."</p>

  <p>Mr. Rayfield considered for a moment, then threw out his hands in a
  gesture of helplessness.</p>

  <p>"Might be a good idea to watch 'em both, don't you think?" He chuckled.
  "Pot is very likely calling the kettle black. And I don't know of anything
  worth stealing in our camp. Just thought I'd give you a hint for what it may
  be worth, in case you don't know your man. And we'll keep an eye on Al."</p>

  <p>"Aw, there's nothing they can do&mdash;but earn their wages," Bill
  dismissed the subject indifferently. "Time Tommy wrangles the burros and does
  the dirty work and slings a muck stick eight hours a day, crime won't look
  half so good to him as his blankets. Same with Al Freeman, if you handle him
  right."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Bill stopped at the corner of the tent and unobtrusively
  watched Mr. Rayfield when he joined his companions.</p>

  <p>So far as he could determine, Mr. Rayfield was concerning himself at
  present with the preparations for a day's fieldwork. Emmett was already
  waiting with his sample bag over his shoulder, his canteen at his feet ready
  to pick up at the last minute. Al, apparently, would be left in camp. Bill
  turned suddenly and beckoned to Tommy, who was glumly examining a dull
  pick.</p>

  <p>"You say you can sharpen steel, Tommy. I'll just let you do a little
  blacksmithing, this fore-noon, while I show Miss Hunter a claim I located for
  her," he said, when Tommy had come close. Then he lowered his voice. "You can
  keep an eye on camp, too. I saw Al Freeman looking hungry at that sample of
  gold ore, Tommy. You'll know what to do if he makes a break. Only&mdash;don't
  kill him. I don't want to take in boarders, and those experts can't
  cook."</p>

  <p>"I'll watch 'im, Mr. Dale. I will that!"</p>

  <p>Bill grinned, took a last pull at his cigarette, and went in to wipe the
  dishes for Doris and watch the dimple in her left cheek.</p>

  <p>And Destiny, that invisible, inscrutable companion whom men sometimes
  fear, sometimes curse and obey inevitably, smiled and waited to see how these
  souls would work out the problems she had set for them.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; "MONTE CRISTO WOULD ENJOY THIS!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"THE way this gulch is washed, I don't know whether I can
  show you anything or not," Bill explained worriedly, preparing for a flat
  failure of his little plan. "That was next thing to a cloud-burst last night,
  Doris&mdash;and I'll own now that I was uneasy last night when you said you
  had left your horses down the gulch. But then, I knew you wouldn't tie them
  in the bottom where they might get drowned out."</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope not," Doris retorted with some asperity. No desert-bred girl
  likes to be thought ignorant of desert hazards. "You'll have to make this
  short, you know. They'll expect me home early to-day. I don't see why you
  can't go. Now you've staked yourself to the luxury of a mucker, you can leave
  him in charge, I should think. Do you really think you've struck anything,
  Bill?"</p>

  <p>"You wait. If my location cut isn't filled in, I can show you in ten
  minutes. And&mdash;if it's good, you're in on it. I located a claim on the
  same ledge in your name."</p>

  <p>"You did?" Doris looked up at him quickly, but she could see only Bill's
  left cheek as he swung his face away from her. "Why, why for me,
  particularly? I couldn't develop it&mdash;dad wouldn't let me. You ought to
  keep your claims for yourself, Bill. You&mdash;you'd give away your head, if
  you could get it off!"</p>

  <p>"I might throw in the rest of me," Bill hinted meaningly, his heart
  pounding like a single-jack in a miners' contest. He stole a glance at her
  from the corner of his eye and was scared and a bit happy, too, at the flush
  on her cheek.</p>

  <p>"Well, fortunately for you&mdash;&mdash;" Doris bit her lip and left the
  sentence unfinished. She liked Bill Dale, but&mdash;there would always be
  unfinished sentences concerning her regard for him. A prospector is,
  paradoxically, not a good prospect for a girl. Doris had seen the poor,
  withered wives of miners who were forever just on the eve of striking
  something rich.</p>

  <p>Walking beside Bill, she thought of the wistful eyes and the draggled,
  cheap clothes of certain women she had met. Some of them even wore overalls
  and helped dig. Bill had been prospecting ever since she first met him at a
  dance in Goldfield. He had talked optimistically of his prospects then. He
  would always talk in the same vein. Always just going to strike rich
  ore,&mdash;never actually getting more than a bare living; if one could call
  grub and a tent a living.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately for me&mdash;what?" Bill was in the mood to bring about a
  crisis of some kind between them. He considered that he had gone too far now
  to retreat.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately for you, your friends have more regard for you than you have
  for yourself," Doris amended glibly. "Is it much farther, Bill? Because I
  really must&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's just up around this first turn." Bill's face sobered a bit. After
  all, Doris didn't seem to care much, one way or the other. She didn't seem
  very enthusiastic over her claim; didn't she know he would take care of the
  development work for her&mdash;at least the assessment work?</p>

  <p>"If a slide hasn't covered it up," he said heavily. "I wanted to show you
  what I&mdash;what I've got. Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, you know I'm no expert, Bill," Doris reminded him lightly. "I can
  tell silver&mdash;when it's in spoons. And gold is jewelry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bill caught her arm, stopping her perforce. His grip left marks in her
  soft flesh. She looked at him, startled, and paled before the fixed stare in
  his eyes. He lifted a shaking finger and pointed.</p>

  <p>Bill's cut in the side of the gulch had not been filled by any slide of
  the soft gravel higher up the slope. Instead it stood there naked, deep,
  clean as a dog's tooth. Even from where they stood the metal gleamed yellow
  in the ten-inch vein of quartz laid bare to the sunlight.</p>

  <p>Slowly, almost reverently, Bill went forward, still holding the girl's arm
  in his strong, unconsciously painful grip. He led her into the cut, stooped
  and broke off a point of the vein with his fingers where his last shot had
  seamed the quartz. He laid the gold-flecked piece in her hand. He looked at
  her standing there so close with the symbol of a great fortune in her
  hand,&mdash;the symbol too of his worshipful love.</p>

  <p>"Monte Cristo would enjoy this," he said and laughed unsteadily.
  "It's&mdash;I found it&mdash;it's yours&mdash;if you'll take me along with
  it. I couldn't&mdash;I had to strike something before I could
  dare&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is&mdash;is it&mdash;<i>gold</i>?" Doris whispered it awesomely. Looking
  up wide-eyed into his face. "Oh&mdash;Bill!"</p>

  <p>Bill took her in his arms, felt her yield, saw her head tilt back against
  his shoulder. He drew a deep breath that was like a sob, and bent and kissed
  her hair.</p>

  <p>Doris was looking from the gold-specked quartz in her hand to the
  gold-specked ridge lying naked to the sky. Her eyes were big and deep, like
  the blue of the sky.</p>

  <p>"Do you love me, Doris?" Bill dared to lean and speak his one absorbing
  hunger, his lips close to her ear.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Oh, Bill, it doesn't seem possible! I&mdash;I can't realize it.
  Can you? Doris was staring still at the gold.</p>

  <p>"It's like a dream come true&mdash;a thousand times better than I'd ever
  dare to dream it." Bill was looking at the way the sunlight turned her brown
  hair to burnished copper, strand by strand. His voice broke. He laid his
  cheek against the copper shine. "You love me! God, I was always scared to
  dream you ever would!"</p>

  <p>Doris stirred in his arms. She was lifting the piece of ore, turning it
  this way and that, watching it shine in the sun and in the shade alike. That
  was the test&mdash;pyrites wouldn't shine in the shade. It was gold,
  absolutely it <i>must</i> be gold!</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bill, aren't you&mdash;excited?" She had turned so that she could
  look into his face. "It's an awfully rich strike, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;yes, I suppose it is." Bill looked briefly at the vein. "Yes,
  it's the richest stuff I ever saw in the ground. But it doesn't mean anything
  to me, Doris, alongside your&mdash;love." He whispered the last word shyly
  against her cheek. "You'll marry me right away, won't you, Doris?
  I've&mdash;wanted you so long; ever since that first time I met you. I've
  thought and dreamed about you&mdash;but it didn't seem possible you could
  ever care. Only, I thought if I made a real stake, and you did like me well
  enough, I could give you everything in the world you wanted. It's as you say:
  I can't realize it yet. I&mdash;wish you'd say it again; just once more.
  <i>Do</i> you&mdash;care?"</p>

  <p>For answer Doris smiled up at him brilliantly. "You great, big silly," she
  said softly.</p>

  <p>Bill kissed her lips and wondered if a man could bear greater joy than was
  his. Not to have just weary, wishful dreams of her; to have Doris herself,
  her love, her willingness to trust herself to him. He felt humbled, ashamed
  of every little human, masculine fault. In one sweeping, swift repentance as
  he stood there, he resolved to attain perfection for her sake&mdash;or as
  near to perfection as a man may approach.</p>

  <p>"You know, daddy and mother will have to be asked before I
  can&mdash;promise absolutely," she reminded him prudently. "So let's not talk
  about it any more just now, Bill."</p>

  <p>"Why, I&mdash;I <i>couldn't</i> talk about it," Bill said slowly. "Some
  things go too deep. You just can't find any words; or I can't. I'll just have
  to prove as I go along&mdash;what it means to me."</p>

  <p>"Just think, Bill! We could go to California, couldn't we?" Doris
  suggested inconsistently. "Talk about dreams&mdash;I've dreamed of the ocean,
  and orange groves, and beautiful things, until sometimes I've nearly gone
  crazy. Bill, I almost hate the desert. It's beautiful, and of course I know
  it by heart and would probably miss it if I never saw it again; but all my
  life I've been hungry for California."</p>

  <p>"You're kind of glad I found the big strike, aren't you?" Bill smiled down
  at her, his eyes worshipful. "I guess we can go to California, all right. We
  could go to the South Pole, if we wanted to badly enough. Anywhere in the
  world you say, Doris. You and I together have four claims along this
  contact&mdash;as near as I could judge from surface indications. That ought
  to bring your dreams to life, don't you think?" Then he sobered. "But it's
  going to take a little time, at that. We've got to dig it out, you know.
  Unless," he added dubiously, "I sold out for just what I could get. That
  would be quick money, but it wouldn't be enough to let us play the rest of
  our lives. I'd have to take some of it and get into some business or other.
  And that would tie us down to one spot more or less."</p>

  <p>Doris shook her head at that. "No, we mustn't sell out. You remember what
  Mr. Rayfield said at the breakfast table, don't you? He certainly does know
  what he's talking about, and I know he'd be glad to advise&mdash;us." The
  last word she spoke with an adorable hesitation which registered an extra
  beat in Bill's pulse. "He's a government man, so of course you can trust him.
  I think we ought to show this vein to him, and let him tell us just what to
  do. His talk about corporations was awfully sensible, Bill."</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Doris." Bill's eyes became shadowed with an unhappy memory.
  "I'm kind of scared of corporations. One of them broke my dad. He found a
  mine&mdash;not so good as this by a long way, but still pretty good&mdash;and
  some crooks incorporated it for him. When they got through with him, he had a
  bunch of stock and no mine. No money, either. It got him. He lived about two
  years after that, and he spent all his time cursing corporations. I don't
  know, Doris, but it kind of left me with a chill whenever I hear the
  word."</p>

  <p>"Well, you say yourself that they were crooks. Mr. Rayfield and Mr. Emmett
  may have landed those very men in the penitentiary. "You've got nerves, Bill.
  I never would have suspected it."</p>

  <p>"Maybe there's a good deal about me you've never suspected," Bill hinted
  warily,&mdash;and almost told her about the saxophone. But he didn't. His
  courage was too new and timid, the mine was too wonderful, and the love of
  Doris too unbelievable.</p>

  <p>"One thing I'd better do," he said, dragging his mind back to the
  practical, "and that is to cover up this vein before some one goes to
  'high-grading' on us. Tommy says Al Freeman's a thief around mines."</p>

  <p>He pulled shovel and pick from under a ridge of washed gravel and began
  artfully filling the cut so that it looked as if the dirt had caved in on the
  side where the vein had been exposed. There was nothing crude in Bill's work.
  When he had finished, a stranger would have sworn that the earth, gravel and
  rocks had rattled down from above. Doris kept watch for him, and mourned
  openly because all that beautiful ore must be buried out of sight. It seemed
  to her almost a sacrilege.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Bill comforted her, standing with his arm around her
  shoulders while he contemplated his camouflage. "It can't run away or spoil,
  you know. That vein would be enough to tempt any man whose honesty didn't
  reach to the middle of his bones. Now you go on up the gulch while I brush
  out our tracks around this cut. There's a little vein up in the next location
  hole that's just a stringer&mdash;but it's fairly rich, and will do to show.
  We'll go up there, and I'll do a little digging and get some samples. And
  then, if you want me to put it up to the government men, Doris, I'll do it.
  But I'll do it on the strength of what shows up in Parowan Number
  Two&mdash;and we'll just keep this Number One vein a secret between us. Shall
  we?"</p>

  <p>"Yes-s, if you let me tell daddy and mother," Doris assented. "I don't
  believe I could keep it a secret from them, Bill."</p>

  <p>"We'll tell them, sure. I'll leave Tommy in charge of camp and go over
  with you to the ranch. I'd like to ask your dad what he thinks of it before I
  talk to the government men."</p>

  <p>"Well, I think that's a good plan. They'll all believe, of course, that
  you're going over to see about that water tunnel. You can't afford to dig
  tunnels for dad, <i>now</i>&mdash;&mdash;" she gave his arm an ecstatic
  squeeze "&mdash;&mdash;but they won't know that. Oh, I think it's just dandy
  to have to be secret about it!"</p>

  <p>"Anyway, it's a darn sight safer," Bill told her laconically, and led the
  way to Number Two.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">IX. &mdash; A "HINT" FROM DORIS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A SHORT-CUT from Number Two claim led them straight over a
  low ridge to camp. Not only did this trail shorten the distance considerably;
  it also avoided altogether the gulch and Parowan Number One&mdash;with its
  secret.</p>

  <p>Al Freeman was seen pottering around the camp by the junipers. Evidently
  the truce still held, for Tommy had finished his blacksmithing and was
  setting the camp to rights, mumbling unintelligibly over his work.</p>

  <p>Bill's plans had taken definite form, which means that he had
  half-unconsciously conceded every point brought forth by Doris, who was
  accustomed to having her say about things on the ranch. In one particular
  only had Bill stood firm. He would not take the experts into his confidence
  until he had talked with Don Hunter. To this Doris readily assented, feeling
  fairly certain that her dad would advise whatever Doris herself wanted. Bill
  reluctantly left the girl's side and joined Tommy over by the forge.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to make a trip over to the Hunter ranch," he announced. "I
  guess our mining will have to wait until I get back&mdash;unless our
  neighbors should happen to move on. But I've about decided that we're going
  to need a dugout to store our grub in. Right here in this bank is a good
  place to dig. While I'm gone you can be making the dugout, Tommy&mdash;and
  you can keep an eye on the camp while you're doing it. Right now, while Miss
  Hunter is in camp, I'll take you up and show you the claims. I've got a
  pretty rich vein and I don't want any one monkeying around there while I'm
  gone. I'll leave it to you and Hez."</p>

  <p>They went off together over the ridge, and Al Freeman stopped his work and
  openly watched their departure. When they were quite out of sight, he came
  shambling over to Bill's tent and pulled open the flap.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Doris looked up from spreading jam between cold biscuits for their
  lunch on the trail. She might have been speaking to one of her father's ranch
  hands, for all the emotion she showed.</p>

  <p>Al grinned slyly and placatingly.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," he said in his flat voice that grated unpleasantly on the
  ear. "I left my terbaccer in here somewhere this morning. If it ain't
  botherin' ye none, I just thought I'd come over an' git it."</p>

  <p>"It took you a long time to miss it," Doris observed coldly. "Why didn't
  you ask Bill for it?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't think of it then," Al grinned, edging into the tent.</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't let you go pawing around in here while he's gone." Doris
  continued to spread other split biscuits with jam. "Go on out, and wait till
  Mr. Dale comes."</p>

  <p>"He ain't likely to be back very soon," Al argued insinuatingly. "I just
  about got to have a smoke, Miss Hunter&mdash;no two ways about it. Won't take
  me but a minute to look where I laid my terbaccer."</p>

  <p>Doris straightened and stood eyeing him attentively, a butcher knife in
  her left hand.</p>

  <p>"Whereabouts did you lay it, then?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Right on a sack in this corner. I was gittin' up to go to breakfast, an'
  I laid my terbaccer down on a sack in this corner. I mind now that Mr. Emmett
  kinda joggled things 'round, pullin' out a box to set on. I never thought no
  more about it till I went to make a smoke." He turned to the corner and
  stooped, laying hold upon a half-filled sack of something. "It musta fell
  over behind," he mumbled.</p>

  <p>"You get out of that corner and out of this tent," Doris commanded
  sternly, laying down the knife.</p>

  <p>Al lifted his lip in a smile that was half a snarl. "Aw, you wouldn't make
  a man go without his terbaccer," he whined, lifting the sack and finding it
  unexpectedly heavy. "Must be gold bricks in this sack," he tittered. "I guess
  that sample he showed at breakfast ain't all he's got!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Will</i> you get out of here?" Doris took a step forward, her eyes,
  her whole face, hardening with anger.</p>

  <p>"Now, now, no use gittin' excited," Al protested, leering at her. "I can't
  go off without my terbaccer&mdash;mebby it fell into this sack. I'll just
  take a look."</p>

  <p>His hand was fumbling inside the sack when Doris fired. Hunkered down on
  his heels, Al gave a grotesque leap straight into the air, as the bullet
  spatted into the earthen floor and kicked dirt over his toes. He came down
  sidewise, sprawled awkwardly and clawing to get up.</p>

  <p>"That's just a hint," Doris announced dispassionately through the drifting
  little smoke cloud. "In about one minute&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Al went out on hands and knees and picked himself up and ran. Doris
  followed him out, saw him duck into his own tent and laughed a little.</p>

  <p>Al, too, was laughing silently, showing his broken, tobacco-stained teeth.
  He was staring gloatingly down at the piece of ore he had dragged from the
  sack, hidden in the palm of his big hand.</p>

  <p>Doris returned to the tent and stood looking reflectively down at the
  tilted sack. She stooped, reached inside it and brought out a lump of ore.
  She frowned over it, her under lip between her teeth.</p>

  <p>"Bill certainly needs a guardian," she said to herself. "Leaving half a
  sack of this stuff right where the first sneak thief could help himself! That
  fellow must have suspected it was here, too. I'll bet he never lost any
  tobacco in here&mdash;but it's easy enough to find out."</p>

  <p>She made a thorough search of the corner and convinced herself that Al had
  been lying to her and that his sole purpose was to get his hands on that ore.
  She tilted the sack again, spilling the contents out on the ground. She had
  no fear that Al would return. With her lifelong knowledge of the desert had
  come the understanding of desert types of men, and she needed no explanation
  of Al Freeman. She knew him for what he was: a coward at heart, mean and
  treacherous and capable of crime that might be hidden. She did not know that
  he had carried off a piece of the ore, but she knew that he suspected its
  richness. Only a tenderfoot will cumber his tent with valueless samples of
  mineral,&mdash;and Bill Dale was no tenderfoot.</p>

  <p>"He thought he could fool me," she analyzed the incident contemptuously.
  "Or maybe he thought I'd be scared to say anything to him." She sorted the
  pieces of ore, choosing those that showed the largest specks and splotches of
  gold. She fondled them, turned them to the light, feasted her eyes upon
  them.</p>

  <p>"Rich! Bill's rich, this minute. A millionaire, for all we know," she
  mused. "And maybe it's like this on my claim, too. Dear old Bill&mdash;he
  surely deserves a fortune. How he's worked to find it&mdash;and he's loved me
  all the time and wanted to strike it so we&mdash;I'm going to make him leave
  the working of the mine to some one else. He can afford to take life easy
  now&mdash;we'll live in Los Angeles, or maybe we'll travel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was sitting cross-legged, with her lap full of rich pieces of quartz,
  when Bill looked in upon her. She scrambled up, her two hands clutching the
  prettiest specimens. Bill was laughing at her, his eyes adoring. Doris pulled
  her fine eyebrows together and shook her head at him.</p>

  <p>"Good thing you've got some one to look after you, old boy," she scolded,
  half in earnest. "You'd have been robbed of all this, and maybe cleaned out
  of everything else, if I hadn't scared him off. He had his hand in the sack,
  mind you, when I shot at his feet. That put him on the run. Bill, you'd
  better tell Tommy to pack a gun while you're gone. That fellow, Al, needs a
  whole lot of watching. What in the world made you keep all this stuff here in
  the tent? He must have known it was here, or at least he suspected
  it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll mighty quick settle with <i>him</i>," Bill said grimly, and turned
  away.</p>

  <p>Doris stopped him. "Better let it pass, Bill. You see, I couldn't
  <i>prove</i> he wasn't after his tobacco, just as he claimed. He may have
  lost it here. I don't believe it, but he had his excuse for coming. And he
  didn't steal anything. I scared him off before he had a chance. Perhaps I
  should have waited and got the goods on him.</p>

  <p>"No, just gather up everything but that sample you had out in sight this
  morning, and we'll carry it over and show it to daddy. And have Tommy watch
  out. There really isn't anything Al can do, is there?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless he bats Tommy on the head; and from all accounts, Tommy's good
  at that game. So you took a shot at him, did you?"</p>

  <p>"And scared the life out of him, almost. We'll have to hurry, Bill. If you
  can pack my outfit on one of the burros, you could ride old Rambler. I wish
  you would. And can't we take Luella along?"</p>

  <p>Bill said that they could, but he would not ride Rambler. On the desert a
  horse seldom travels faster than a walk on a long journey, especially with a
  pack animal along. Bill was accustomed to depending on his own legs, and a
  twenty-mile hike was his regular day's travel when on the trail. He therefore
  packed an emergency camp outfit on Wise One and set out quite happily,
  walking beside Doris, sometimes touching her hand caressingly, his soul still
  hushed and trembling lest all this would prove itself a dream.</p>

  <p>In violet shadows they approached the house in its square of cottonwoods
  and saw a tall, rangy figure step leisurely down from the porch and come to
  meet them, holding a big-bowled, briar pipe from which lazy incense floated
  upward.</p>

  <p>Leaning both arms upon the top board of the yard fence, Don Hunter waited
  placidly until they came up, Rambler shuffling into a trot as he remembered
  his stall. Occasionally Don placed the pipestem between his teeth and took
  comfort from the slow inhalation of smoke. Content emanated from his
  personality as perfume of a flower gives a soothing quality to the air about
  it. He was a strong man, meant to dominate those lesser souls with whom he
  came in contact, and some with souls as great as his, but humble in their
  greatness. He was not an aggressive man, but most men feared to incur his ill
  will or his contempt, and his opinion was rated above that of his neighbors;
  and although he was slow to give advice, scarcely a day passed but he was
  asked for it. Bill did not know a man whom he liked better or respected more,
  and his attitude was not greatly influenced by the fact that Don was the
  father of Doris. Indeed, he had known Don Hunter long before he first met the
  girl. And if his prospecting were frowned upon by the older man, Bill knew
  that Don would be the first to throw up his hat over Bill's success, and
  never think of his own possible benefit from the strike.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Bill," Don called as the two came up, Bill walking briskly behind
  his burro. Doris had professed a reluctance to let daddy and mother know that
  night about the tentative engagement, and they had traveled apart for the
  last mile across the flat.</p>

  <p>"Howdy, Don. Well, we're here, all right."</p>

  <p>Don reached out a long arm and swung open the gate. Then he and Bill shook
  hands, looking into each other's eyes with frank pleasure in the meeting.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see yuh, Bill. Just slip the bridles off&mdash;there's hay in the
  corral&mdash;and come on in. Supper's been waiting on yuh."</p>

  <p>"We're half-starved, Daddy, and that's the truth," Doris declared, leaning
  from the saddle to kiss the top of his head as she rode past. "Bill's about
  all in, I reckon. We got a late start and hustled right along."</p>

  <p>"Just keep that pace up till you hit the supper table," Don suggested, and
  fastened the gate behind them before he returned to the porch. "They're here,
  Momma," he called within, and stood in the dusk of the doorway, waiting.</p>

  <p>Bill had stridden ahead and opened the corral gate, and Wise One nipped
  through the opening and made for the manger along one side where fresh hay
  was piled. Rambler crowded past Bill hurriedly and went trotting after the
  burro. Doris rode through, kicked her right foot free of the stirrup and
  swung down, landing unexpectedly in Bill's arms.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bill&mdash;daddy'll see us!" she protested weakly as Bill lifted her
  face with a palm under her chin.</p>

  <p>"Just one more kiss&mdash;and say you love me," Bill pleaded softly. "I
  can't believe it&mdash;it seems it like a dream. Kiss me, little Doris." In
  the last few hours Bill had attained a certain masterful manner, though he
  still suffered uneasy moments of incredulity that demanded instant proof of
  the sweet reality.</p>

  <p>Curiously, while they actually hurried, and Bill held her no longer than a
  few seconds in his arms, Don Hunter's voice came bellowing from the porch
  before they reached the corral gate. He looked at them searchingly too, when
  they came into the big kitchen where the light was mellow and homelike, and
  where Mrs. Don was spearing mealy, white potatoes out of an old-fashioned
  iron kettle.</p>

  <p>They were sighing in gastronomic bliss over the thick, quivery custard pie
  when Doris looked across at Bill in mild dismay.</p>

  <p>"Bill! You forgot Luella! I'll bet she's swearing herself black in the
  face, out there."</p>

  <p>Bill pushed back his chair and rose. "She must be hungry&mdash;thirsty,
  too," he said contritely. "Excuse me just four seconds and I'll bring her
  in."</p>

  <p>"First time I ever knew Bill to forget the parrot," Don observed drily.
  "Where's Sister Mitchell and Hezekiah? Didn't leave them behind, did he?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bill has a fellow with him in camp. Yes, he only brought Luella. She
  doesn't seem to like Tommy very well. She wouldn't say a word, hardly. Oh,
  come on, Luella!" But the smile Doris sent toward the door was too intimate
  to be wasted on a mere parrot. Don Hunter lifted one eyebrow, then pulled
  them both together in a puzzled frown.</p>

  <p>"Luella hungry? Let me have her, Bill. Here's a lovely wishbone,
  Luella."</p>

  <p>Luella tilted her head sidewise and regarded the proffered dainty
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it," she remarked with startling distinctness. "One more
  kiss&mdash;say you love me. Seems like a dream. Kiss me, Doris. Daddy'll see
  us. I can't believe it. We're rich, Bill, dear. I can't believe it. Do you
  love me?"</p>

  <p>Then, and then only, Luella accepted the wishbone and began daintily
  picking off tiny shreds of chicken meat.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X. &mdash; "WE'RE RICH, BILL, DEAR"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BILL started for the door, stumbling against a chair in his
  flight. "I'll kill this darned bird!" he threatened viciously. "That's the
  second time she's tipped my hand lately."</p>

  <p>Luella looked up at him sidewise and blinked in the effort to remember
  something.</p>

  <p>"Bill Dale's parrot tipped Bill's hand," she muttered, and turned her head
  the other way. "We'll lay low. See the recorr-r&mdash;&mdash;" She turned and
  walked up Bill's arm to his shoulder, tilting forward there and making kissy
  sounds against his crimson cheek. "I can't believe it. We're rich, Bill,
  dear." Then she laughed in a shrill falsetto.</p>

  <p>"Better come on back and finish your pie before I boot you outside," Don
  observed drily. "I reckon maybe you can explain where the bird learned all
  that. Never saw yuh on the run before, Bill."</p>

  <p>At that, Bill returned and stood behind his chair, looking down honestly
  into Don Hunter's searching eyes.</p>

  <p>"She learnt it eavesdropping," Bill said bluntly. "She does that trick,
  every once in awhile. She got it straight, too. I&mdash;asked Doris to marry
  me, and she said it would be a good deal as you two say. I didn't ask her
  until I was dead certain I'd be able to give her luxuries a prospector
  couldn't afford. I struck the richest vein of gold-bearing quartz, Don, that
  I ever saw in the ground. I've got three claims on the lead, and I located
  one for Doris, too.</p>

  <p>"I didn't come over to go to work. I came to ask you if you'd have me in
  the family, and I wanted to get your advice about what to do with my claims.
  There are several thousand dollars' worth in sight&mdash;at a rough guess.
  And the vein looks strong." He smiled at Mrs. Don, who smiled back mistily.
  "I didn't mean to spring it all on you folks this evening. I&mdash;kind of
  wanted to get my nerve tuned up, and tell you with trimmings. But the darned
  parrot beat me to it, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So you'd better sit right down and eat your pie," Mrs. Don finished for
  him, laughing tremulously. "You're a good boy, Bill. We&mdash;we'd hate
  awfully to lose our girl; she's all we've got. But&mdash;far as I'm
  concerned, I'd rather it would be you&mdash;if you're sure you can take care
  of her."</p>

  <p>"The boss has said it." Don gave his wife the look one bestows upon some
  treasured thing. "Sit down&mdash;sit down! Don't look as if you expected to
  be lynched for it. The women folks run this house, Bill. So you struck it
  rich! You say you're sure it ain't just a fluke?"</p>

  <p>Doris rose hastily, asking permission with her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Fluke!" She glanced eloquently at Bill, then at her father. "You wait a
  minute. I'll show you whether it's a fluke. There. I hid it under my gloves
  because I was going to wait till morning before we said anything. Look at
  <i>that</i>, will you, Mother? And cast your critical glance at <i>that</i>,
  Dad Hunter!" She placed a piece of ore beside each plate and returned
  triumphantly to her seat.</p>

  <p>A lump came into Bill's throat as he watched those two, slipping past
  middle age, never quite reaching rainbow's end except in love. Mrs. Don
  lifted the sample, looked at it, leaned and held it under the direct rays of
  the lamp, glanced diffidently at Bill, then looked questioningly across the
  table at Don.</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;gold, isn't it? Without my glasses I&mdash;but it
  looks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Don deliberately produced his reading glasses from an inner pocket of his
  vest, tucked the bows over his ears and picked up the specimen which Bill had
  chipped off the vein and given to Doris. Don moved his tongue in his cheek
  while he looked, slanting the rock so that the lamp shone on it. He was not a
  miner himself, but he had lived too long in Nevada not to know minerals
  fairly well. He pushed his glasses down his nose until he could look over
  them at Bill.</p>

  <p>"How much of this have you got in sight, did you say?"</p>

  <p>"I estimated it roughly at about five thousand dollars. When I first
  located the vein I mortared and panned enough to get a fair idea of how it
  was running. The vein averaged about ten inches, fairly uniform so far. The
  storm last night uncovered it so now it stands out clean from the side of the
  cut like an outcropping; or it did, before I covered it up. I didn't want to
  come away and leave it open. There are some strangers camped right beside me.
  Government men&mdash;but I didn't like the look of their packer."</p>

  <p>"Didn't like the look&mdash;my goodness, Mother! The fellow came to the
  tent when I was there getting ready to start home, and he started snooping
  around in the corner where Bill had a lot of this ore. He was bound and
  de-<i>ter</i>-mined he'd see what was in the sack. I told him more than once
  to go&mdash;but I had to shoot into the ground beside him before he'd go. He
  went then, all right!"</p>

  <p>Her mother looked alarmed. "Why, Doris! And where was Bill?"</p>

  <p>"I was up at the claims with Tommy," Bill explained. "You can see, maybe,
  why I can't be away long&mdash;and why I covered up this vein."</p>

  <p>"Oh dear!" Mrs. Hunter leaned her head on her hand as if she had become
  suddenly aware of a great weariness. "Must <i>you</i> go through all that
  fighting and grasping over gold? A boom always seems to me like a lot of wild
  animals fighting and tearing at one another, to get a bone which the first
  one on the hunting ground has already cleaned." She closed her eyes tightly
  for an instant, then looked wistfully from Doris to Bill. "I don't know but
  what gold costs more than it's worth, after all," she said. "And the more you
  have, the more terrible the price. I don't know but what I'd just about as
  soon see you two face poverty together, as to see you face a boom. You know,"
  she added apologetically, "I was born in Virginia City. I've seen sudden
  wealth and sudden poverty. And the sudden wealth was worse,
  sometimes&mdash;though I never heard of a man shooting himself because he
  struck it rich, and they do sometimes when they lose everything."</p>

  <p>"That's what Mr. Rayfield meant, I guess. He said if Bill had a lot of ore
  like the sample he saw, he'd have Bill's friends pray that wealth wouldn't
  spoil him." Doris smiled tolerantly at her mother, as youth is wont to smile
  at experience.</p>

  <p>"Who's Rayfield?" Don Hunter pushed back his chair with a rasping sound on
  the bare floor. "How did he come to see a sample? Doris, you help your mother
  with the dishes; you ought to have a lot to talk over. Bill, come on out on
  the porch and let's get at the bottom of this. So far I can't make head nor
  tail of anything."</p>

  <p>Out on the porch the two men smoked in silence, watching the twinkling of
  camp fires half a mile away, where travelers were availing themselves of
  running water and shade for one comfortable camp on the desert. The Hunter
  ranch saw many such wayfarers, for it lay close to the highway (such as it
  was) and formed a sort of oasis, all the more enticing because one could buy
  fresh eggs and milk and, if one were lucky, a loaf or two of delicious bread.
  Mrs. Don called such revenue her pin money, and Don himself grinned and
  wondered sometimes what she ever did with it.</p>

  <p>"Who's Rayfield?" Don repeated his question abruptly, after a lapse of
  several minutes.</p>

  <p>Bill told him, making few words of it but contriving to paint a very clear
  picture in Don's mind.</p>

  <p>"They didn't come this way&mdash;or if they did, they didn't stop." Don
  seemed to consider that omission somewhat derogatory to the character of the
  government men.</p>

  <p>"They didn't mention this place at all," Bill said. "I got the idea they
  diverged from the trail and cut towards the likeliest mineral showings. That
  would put them south."</p>

  <p>"What's your plan, Bill? Or haven't you got any?" Don inspected his pipe,
  prodding at the tobacco with his finger. "Yuh want to cash in as soon as yuh
  can, I reckon&mdash;anxious for the honeymoon."</p>

  <p>"You've been there," Bill retorted. "Sure, I'm anxious. That little girl
  has been hankering for the ocean and palm trees all her life, she said."</p>

  <p>"They won't run away in the next year or so, that I know of. Well, I'm no
  mining shark, but I reckon I better trail over to your diggin's and see what
  you've got. Maybe them fellows over there can be some help, and then again,
  maybe you want to steer clear of them. Just because a man draws down his pay
  from Uncle Sam don't give him any guarantee from the Almighty that he's a he
  angel. Doris seems to think so."</p>

  <p>"What I want, Don, is for you to take a hand and help me get started off
  on the right foot. I can see it's going to be a mighty big proposition, and I
  don't want to have the same experience my dad had. On the other hand, I don't
  want to act the darned fool sitting over my claims with a shotgun, afraid
  somebody's going to rob me. There's a safe line betwixt and between that I
  want to take and keep. And I wouldn't ask you to make the trip over there, if
  I didn't <i>know</i> the stuff's there; acres of it, by the looks."</p>

  <p>Don sucked at his pipe for some time before he spoke. Then,</p>

  <p>"I'll do all I can, Bill. If you're going to be one of the family I might
  as well start bossing yuh now. I want to see yuh make good without hurting
  the other fellow. It can be done, and if it's done rightly, there ain't any
  cleaner money in the world than what comes out of the ground. Mines or
  ranches, you're giving the world something it never had before; something it
  needs. Most money-making is just swapping the ownership of necessities, or
  else changing the shape and form of them and selling them that way. But when
  you take something outa old Mother Earth, you've got it clean. What I can't
  stomach is the way crooks come flockin' around every new strike, and making
  it rotten business.</p>

  <p>"Every boom suffers from 'em. When the news of this leaks
  out&mdash;<i>has</i> it leaked out, yet?"</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head, though Don could not see him in the dark.</p>

  <p>"Not so far as I know. I just brought down supplies and a mucker from
  Goldfield&mdash;and there's something funny happened up there. The darn
  parrot was outside while I was in recording the claims, and when I came out,
  she commenced talking a new speech that I'll swear <i>I</i> never taught her.
  She got it off to-night, if you noticed." Bill blushed consciously, but went
  on. "She said, 'Bill Dale's parrot has tipped Bill's hand. We'll lay
  low&mdash;see the recorder.' Only, she couldn't quite get the last word out.
  Now, she heard that said in Goldfield, while I was in the recorder's office,
  or she couldn't have repeated it. I've learned that much about parrots. She
  talks right along, and seems to know what she means&mdash;way she calls me
  down, sometimes, is right human&mdash;but she has to hear a sentence before
  she can say it. One hearing's enough, if she happens to take a notion to the
  words. But it was funny, her saying that." He flicked the ash off his
  cigarette. "I shut her up till I was ready to leave," he added. "I guess it
  didn't amount to anything. I wasn't trailed, anyway."</p>

  <p>"What about these fellows camped up there? You sure they
  ain't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, they came from Las Vegas way. No, they're not on my trail&mdash;or if
  they are they're pretty damned smooth."</p>

  <p>"Crooks are," Don remarked laconically. "How would the parrot be able to
  tip your hand? Ever think that out?"</p>

  <p>"No-o&mdash;only, I talk to the menagerie in camp, of course. When a
  fellow doesn't see a human for weeks at a time, he'll talk to anything; and
  Luella's next to human, seems like. Yes, I talked about buying her a gold
  perch, I remember, and about striking it. I was one tickled man, Don, when I
  first uncovered that vein and saw the gold showing right up in the rock."</p>

  <p>"Mh-hm&mdash;well, I reckon she must have overheard you talking about it.
  Same as she must have heard some remarks, coming over, that was kind of
  embarrassing for a minute, when repeated. I reckon I'll have to get you outa
  bed early, to-morrow morning, Bill. I'm getting mighty curious to see those
  government men and have a talk with them." He knocked the ashes from his pipe
  and rose. "I've learned that one hoof track is good as a dozen when you're
  trailin' stock. A critter's got to be present, to make one track. And I can't
  seem to see you teachin' that parrot to say that she's tipped your hand, and
  you'll lie low. Some other critter made that track, Bill. If I don't miss my
  guess, you'll have somebody trying to horn in somehow. Let's go in. I want to
  talk to Doris about that feller she took a shot at, that was nosin' around
  your samples."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">XI. &mdash; MR. RAYFIELD GIVES ADVICE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I C'ULDN'T turrn 'em out, Mr. Dale," Tommy explained in a
  worried tone, and pensively inspected a plug of tobacco before helping
  himself. "Al Freeman packed the burros an' hit the trail yistiddy, he
  did&mdash;an' phwat was I t' do wit' them experts but leave 'em eat uh your
  grub? They're t' pay fer the board&mdash;I made that plain to 'em 'fore they
  swallied a mout'ful&mdash;I did that."</p>

  <p>Bill stood with his hands on his hips, looking across to the junipers,
  where trampled brush and a tin can or two marked the spot where the
  government men had made their camp. Al Freeman had evidently made a clean job
  of it, though Tommy had said that the blankets of Rayfield and Emmett had
  been left in a pile on a convenient rock. But no food of any kind. Their
  canteens and prospectors' picks and sample bags, and the clothes they walked
  in constituted their sole equipment for camping on the desert. Of course,
  there was nothing for Tommy to do but take them in and feed them, at least
  until Bill's return.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Don?" Bill relaxed his muscles and turned to
  unsaddle.</p>

  <p>"Tell you better when I've sized up the experts," Don replied warily. "Of
  course, this Al Freeman could expect to hear from you when you got back; he
  maybe decided to go while the going was good and he could have burros and
  plenty of grub. When his bosses heard about his performance in your tent, I
  don't see how they could do anything less than haze him outa camp with a back
  pack&mdash;do you? The average skunk like him would beat 'em to it and choose
  his own pack. He seems to of been right liberal with himself."</p>

  <p>"Wanted to fix it so they couldn't follow him up, I reckon," Bill added.
  "When did Rayfield and Emmett find it out, Tommy?"</p>

  <p>"When they come in at night, Mr. Dale." Tommy had his chew, now, and felt
  more at ease. "Uh coorse, I seen him packin', an' I coulda stopped 'im easy.
  But not knowin' their plans, how sh'd I know they wasn't movin' on, an' Al
  under orrders t' pack an' go?"</p>

  <p>"You couldn't butt in, of course," said Bill. "I'd have stood right here
  and watched him carry off the works, and I'd never have thought to say a word
  against it. It was sure bold&mdash;and he could get away with it, too. And
  you couldn't do any less than feed the experts. Where did they sleep?"</p>

  <p>Tommy tilted his head much like Luella. "They slept outa doors, Mr. Dale.
  They did, that! I seen 'em look longin' at your bunk, but I says I has me
  orrders, an' they slept outside. They did, that! It was Hez that had the tent
  to hisself, Mr. Dale&mdash;barrin' the turkle which I left alone, she was
  that bashful wit' me." He grinned, showing broken teeth. Then he thought of
  something.</p>

  <p>"They was a growlin' an' a grumblin' from that dorg, Mr. Dale. "But if
  anny one wished to enter the tent, he changed his wish, I'm thinkin'. An' it
  might 'a' been Mr. Rayfield wantin' a drink from the bucket, fer I heard him
  tellin' that other how he was like to make a trip to the spring in the night,
  but recalled the canteen not bein' empty. He got no drink from the bucket
  befoor sun-up, that I c'ld swear to, Mr. Dale."</p>

  <p>Bill nodded and went thoughtfully about his cooking of an early supper.
  Riding the desert&mdash;or walking, for that matter&mdash;puts an edge on
  one's hunger, and eating is the first thought on arriving in camp. There
  would still be time to show Don his gold vein on Number One, and he quizzed
  Tommy carefully about the movements of the experts. Tommy had a deep, wide
  cut in the sidehill to show how his own time had been spent, and he had seen
  to it that Bill's tent had not been entered. Further than that he was vague.
  The experts had struck off to the west, that morning. They could have swung
  back around the hill and gone up the gulch without Tommy's knowledge,
  however, and Bill was uneasy; though with Al Freeman gone there could be no
  valid reason for being nervous.</p>

  <p>But there is a certain hypnotic quality in native gold. The very sight of
  it in its natural form will leave a mark on any man's mind. The possessor is
  affected according to his mental caliber. He will lose his head and spend
  money recklessly, feeling that he has all nature behind him; or he will grow
  wary, eyeing his fellow men with suspicion, haunted by the fear of being
  robbed. The higher the mentality, the more subtle the effect; but it is
  there, nevertheless.</p>

  <p>Don Hunter felt it when he stood beside Bill and stared at the vein which
  Bill had just uncovered. He stooped and laid a forefinger upon one great
  splotch of gold in the rock. His finger could not quite cover it from sight.
  He rubbed the gold almost caressingly. He feasted his eyes upon the many
  specks and splotches. Even when he got out his pipe and sat down on the edge
  of the cut, he could no more take his eyes off the gold than could Doris,
  when she first saw it.</p>

  <p>"My God, Bill, that's the richest stuff I ever saw!" he sighed. "I
  couldn't help thinking, all along, that you and Doris had got too excited
  right in the start. I was afraid maybe you both had a disappointment coming
  to you&mdash;the way you talked about millions. I take it all back."</p>

  <p>"I knew you felt that way about it," Bill grinned. "And I knew you'd
  change your tune when you saw it in the ground yourself. That's why I wanted
  you to see it and help me plan the next move. Doris wants to incorporate and
  let the company do the mining while we go off and play. Poor little kid, she
  wants to see something besides sagebrush, and I don't blame her. If this mine
  can't make Doris happy and give her the things she wants, then it's of no use
  to me. What do you think about forming a company, Don? Rayfield claims it's
  the only thing to do. I hate the very name 'corporation,' but I know that's
  partly prejudice. I don't want to be hidebound. I'm willing to leave it to
  you."</p>

  <p>"And I ain't going to give snap judgment on a thing the size of this." Don
  opened his knife and went over to pick out that big splotch of gold which
  seemed to fascinate him. This thing is going to take some studying."</p>

  <p>That night they talked long with the two research men. Don admired the
  careful conservatism of Mr. Emmett, but he responded more freely to Mr.
  Rayfield's genial manner and his clear, common-sense way of going at the
  heart of the subject. He had approached the acquaintance of the two men with
  mental reservations. In an hour he and Bill had both forgotten their caution;
  the conversation had drifted insensibly into a consultation.</p>

  <p>"My, my! I wish that scoundrel had at least left us our grips," Mr.
  Rayfield exclaimed regretfully. It's rather embarrassing to be obliged to
  trust that you will take our word in the place of regular credentials. All
  our papers, instructions, reports&mdash;everything that could prove our
  identity and standing, carried off by that pitiful sneak thief! And I
  suppose," he added with a grimace, "they'll go to start his camp fire. I
  doubt if the man can read; if he can he'll probably burn our papers as a
  means of self-protection. You can't identify slabs of bacon&mdash;or burros,
  either, as far as I'm concerned. They all look alike to me, the same as
  Chinamen. So he'll probably burn all our personal belongings and travel like
  an honest prospector. I don't suppose he managed to get any inkling of what
  you have here, Mr. Dale?"</p>

  <p>Bill replied that he didn't see how Al could have gotten wise to anything;
  though his prowling in the tent held a sinister meaning, he believed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rayfield pursed his lips. "I wouldn't think that would mean anything
  more than an attempt to steal whatever he could lay his hands on," he said
  judicially. "He had undoubtedly laid his plans to make off with our outfit,
  and he was quite willing to add as much of yours as he could steal. My, my,
  what a plucky young lady your daughter is, Mr. Hunter! There isn't a doubt in
  the world but what she saved Mr. Dale from being robbed. No," he returned to
  the point in question, "I don't see how Al could suspect that you had any
  rich claims here. He certainly had no time to locate any ground alongside you
  before he left. And that, I think, would be his first move. It would be very
  easy to sell his claims in Goldfield without ever showing up here again. That
  is, if he could get hold of some of your ore and show it to the right
  parties."</p>

  <p>"You've been in Goldfield, Mr. Rayfield?" Don lifted one eyebrow at
  him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Yes, we try to keep in touch more or less with all the mining
  camps. Emmett and I were there just this summer. Nice little camp there. But
  the speculators are ready for another stampede, nevertheless. Do you know,
  Mr. Hunter, this mining country has produced a type of men whom I should call
  professional boomers. A pernicious type, too, in the long run. For while they
  undoubtedly do start things moving when they rush to a new camp, they also
  knock the bottom out quite as unthinkingly when they rush off to the next
  boom camp.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you realize, Mr. Dale, that you'll have to take into
  consideration that very thing. I don't see any possibility of avoiding a boom
  here at Parowan. The moment the news leaks out in Goldfield there'll be a
  rush down here. It will be humanly impossible to prevent it. The only thing
  that you can do is to prepare yourself to handle it when it comes and see to
  it that the undesirables don't get control."</p>

  <p>"Has it occurred to you," Mr. Emmett asked abruptly, "that somebody's
  going to lay out a town site here? That's the first thing that will happen.
  If you'll take my advice, Mr. Dale, you'll beat them to it. If you own the
  town site, you can pretty nearly control the situation."</p>

  <p>Bill and Don looked at each other questioningly. Don turned to the other
  two, eyeing them quizzically. "What's the matter with you two laying out the
  town site yourselves?" he asked. "Seems to me you're entitled to some benefit
  here, if it's only to break even on your outfit."</p>

  <p>Mr. Rayfield laughed and threw out his hand in a gesture of
  helplessness.</p>

  <p>"Our hands are tied, Mr. Hunter. So long as we are in the employ of the
  government we are not permitted to profit in any way from the work that we do
  or from any mineral which may be uncovered. Sort of sanctified to the service
  of Uncle Sam. We'd have to resign before we could take any active part in
  your strike, Mr. Dale."</p>

  <p>Bill studied that for a moment. "You know all about the best way to handle
  this proposition," he said finally. "That town-site idea is a bird&mdash;only
  I'd be plumb helpless about starting a thing like that in country that isn't
  surveyed. I suppose you wouldn't think of such a thing as resigning from your
  jobs and taking hold here." He glanced at Don for approval.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rayfield shook his head slowly. "That, I'm afraid, would need some
  ve-ry serious consideration. Of course, we're not mere chattels; we could
  resign at any time. But there's the ethical point to consider. Speaking for
  myself, Mr. Dale, I'd have to feel very sure that I could be of real service,
  and that in a field broad enough to justify my leaving this research work to
  others. Of course," he went on musingly, "if I could be sure that I might be
  able to help develop this district and make the name Parowan stand for clean,
  efficient mining, with a clean, orderly town here, that would be a tremendous
  achievement for any man. The research work in this particular district would
  almost take care of itself. This whole Parowan neighborhood would be gone
  over with a fine-tooth comb by prospectors."</p>

  <p>He rose, glancing with his good eye at Mr. Emmett. "I think we'd all
  better sleep on the subject," he smiled disarmingly. "Mr. Emmett and I will
  in any event be glad to look over your claims and give you our honest opinion
  and as much advice as we feel competent to offer. And as to our resigning and
  taking hold here&mdash;we'll have to think that over. But I feel free to say,
  here and now, that we <i>will</i> think it over; and that, if you only knew
  it, is a very great compliment to you folks and to the mine we believe you
  have got here."</p>

  <p>Mr. Emmett had also risen to his feet. He smiled slightly, glancing from
  one to the other.</p>

  <p>"Walter is more impulsive than I am, more inclined to play hunches. But we
  stand pretty close together and I usually agree with him in the long run. I
  don't fall in with this idea of resigning. Right now I call it foolish. We've
  passed up dozens of chances to make a stake in some mining boom. I don't know
  what's got into him to-night. But it's only fair to tell you that I'm going
  to talk him out of that notion if I can."</p>

  <p>Mr. Rayfield threw back his head and laughed contagiously. "It isn't a
  notion," he denied jovially. "Bill Dale, here&mdash;<i>Hopeful</i> Bill
  Dale&mdash;paid us the high compliment of suggesting it. It's no treason,
  John, to think it over. Come along to bed and don't look so solemn." He
  turned to Don and Bill, smiling down at them almost paternally.</p>

  <p>"Don't mind John Emmett, boys. He has no sense of humor, anyway.
  To-morrow, I think we'll just postpone our field work and go into this
  proposition very thoroughly with you. Our time and what scant knowledge we
  have is at your disposal, and free as the desert air. I hope you won't
  hesitate to use both as long as you feel the need. And whether we decide to
  roll up our sleeves and help make you a millionaire, Bill, or whether we go
  on pecking at rocks for the government, I hope you'll rely always upon our
  friendship and good will."</p>

  <p>They had been gone some minutes before Don straightened from his hunched
  position on a box and knocked the cold ashes from his pipe.</p>

  <p>"We'll try and get them in," he said slowly. "That town-site idea is worth
  darn near as much as your mine."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">XII. &mdash; A MAN SHOULDN'T MIX BUSINESS WITH LOVE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE big hotel in Goldfield was humming with talk and
  laughter, as people rushed here and there. Arriving guests were lined up at
  the desk, waiting anxiously to hear whether they could have a room and bath,
  or must content themselves with a plain room. A third of them betrayed signs
  of having slept out under the stars or under canvas. A few of them gazed at
  these desert dwellers with curiosity that was more than a little envious. The
  rest were quite absorbed in their own affairs and gave no attention to their
  neighbors. And the loungers in the great, velvet-upholstered chairs scattered
  amongst the great pillars of the lobby, watched the new ones, idly amused or
  indifferent.</p>

  <p>"That's Bill Dale," a slender, black-eyed man volunteered to his companion
  on the right, and waved his cigar toward the elevator. "And that's his
  bride&mdash;the little Hunter girl. You know Don Hunter, don't you? Sure, you
  do! Well, that's his daughter and her mother. Bill? Why, he's the fellow that
  discovered Parowan! Gold you could hack out of the quartz with your knife!
  Yeah&mdash;that's the stuff they've got over across the street, in the
  window. Brought in a ton of it and dumped it in that window like so much
  dirt!</p>

  <p>"Talk about luck! You know how he found it? Why, he was prospecting around
  and happened to camp at Parowan spring one night. And I'm blamed if a young
  cloud-burst didn't hit that side of the mountain, that night, and uncovered
  the whole vein, bare as your hand. Fact. Bill ran slap on to it when he went
  to the spring next morning for water.</p>

  <p>"He was cute as the next one. Staked out a group of claims and kept the
  whole thing hushed up till he'd got everything nailed down. Laid out a town
  site, even. Did that on the quiet, too&mdash;Don Hunter got a surveyor friend
  of his to go down and run some lines on his ranch. When he got him down
  there, he just hitched up and hauled him over to Bill's claims, and had him
  lay out Parowan town and survey the group of claims so there wouldn't be any
  chance for fraction hunters. Everything air-tight&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Huh? No, I didn't say <i>water</i>-tight! Bill's incorporated, and
  everybody with two bits in his overalls is buying stock. Take my word, that
  stock's making a rocket look like a kid climbing a greased pole. I bought a
  block at par&mdash;first offering was at par, mind you. Nothing cheap about
  Bill! But then he's a fine, straight fellow, and everybody knows he wouldn't
  stand for any wildcatting. He's <i>got</i> it, you see. Why, they keep guards
  standing over that mine with sawed-off shotguns&mdash;or so I heard.</p>

  <p>"What's that? Sure, I'll take you down there. If I get a chance, I'll have
  you meet Bill. Nothing swell-headed about him&mdash;I used to know him when
  he packed his grub out of here on two burros; wasn't so long ago, either,
  that he did that same thing&mdash;but everybody is after him now, of course.
  He always was popular and now his millions are not getting him the cold
  shoulder any, that I've noticed. Then he was just married to-day&mdash;this
  morning, upstairs in the parlor&mdash;with all the big bugs in town present.
  They're leaving to-morrow morning for California on their honeymoon.</p>

  <p>"You know, Fred, if you want a good, safe investment that will bring quick
  returns, Parowan's your best bet. Either buy Parowan Consolidated, or else go
  down and pick up some lots in the town. As for the stock, they're shipping
  gold out of there in the rock right now and building a mill with the
  proceeds. There's going to be a railroad in there soon as it can be put
  through; two, I heard to-day&mdash;but that may be just street gossip. Some
  one was saying a cut-off's coming through from Las Vegas to Parowan, and on
  to Goldfield. Don't know how true that is, but I do know for a fact that a
  line will be put through from Barstow or thereabouts. That's been talked of
  for quite a while, but Goldfield has lost the peak of her boom in the last
  few months, and it took this new Parowan strike to bring things to a
  head.</p>

  <p>"Bill's heading this way. You hold my place&mdash;I'm going to wander
  across his trail and meet him. If I can, I'll bring him over. I want you to
  meet the man that's being talked about more than any other man in the West
  to-day."</p>

  <p>The black-eyed man manoeuvered cleverly so that he met Bill within six
  feet of the settee where his friend was waiting. But Bill was halted in the
  middle of a group that seemed disinclined to make their greetings brief. They
  were important-looking men, money-makers every one, if looks meant anything.
  All were laughing; several were talking at once. The black-eyed man caught
  Bill's eye over the shoulder of those in front, and tilted his head
  backwards. Bill answered the look with a slight nod and gradually worked his
  way toward the signaller.</p>

  <p>"How are you, Davis? Pretty crowded here to-night." Mechanically Bill
  shook hands, that friendly ceremony having been forced upon him in the past
  two months until his hand went out as unconsciously as does the hand of a
  politician at election time. Davis held to the hand and drew him toward the
  settee.</p>

  <p>"Gold's an old story to you, Bill, but all the same I want you to meet a
  friend of mine who is just down from Alaska after his own little clean-up.
  Fred Moore's his name, and he's not such a bad guy to have for a friend.
  Packed me in out of the cold on his back, once, when I was up there a year or
  two ago. How many miles was it, Fred, that you carried me that time?"</p>

  <p>Fred had gotten to his feet and was shaking hands with Bill. "Not over
  forty," he parried indifferently. "So you're a bloated plutocrat, eh? Davis
  has been telling me all about you. Placer or quartz?"</p>

  <p>"Free milling gold in quartz," Bill told him, and then excused himself
  hastily, with two valid reasons. One was the appearance of Doris by the
  elevator, evidently looking for him; and the other was his growing distaste
  for the subject of his mine. It seemed to him that every man he met seized
  the first opportunity to quiz and question him about Parowan. Over and over
  again he had told the truth about finding the mine. Now he was cynically
  content to let the garbled newspaper stories and the gossip of men stand for
  the truth.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rayfield joined him without greeting or apology as Bill made his way
  to the elevator,&mdash;and his bride. Mr. Emmett saw the two and came up, so
  that the three arrived together before Doris.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to have time this evening to hold that business meeting,
  Bill?" Emmett asked casually. "Your train leaves about nine o'clock in the
  morning, doesn't it? We ought to get that straightened out before you go, or
  we'll have to pester you with papers to sign and a lot of detail work. What
  do you want done about the meeting?"</p>

  <p>Bill hesitated, glancing toward Doris. Rayfield came to the rescue, laying
  his hand familiarly on Bill's arm, perfectly aware of the fact that half the
  men in the lobby were at that moment registering a certain degree of
  envy.</p>

  <p>"Now, if you don't want to attend that meeting, Bill, just leave it to us.
  We can get everything done and you can sign the minutes in the morning. My,
  my, events are surely moving fast! There's a bunch of New York men here
  to-day&mdash;just got in this morning. They want to start a bank at Parowan
  just as soon as they can get a roof to put it under. And that man O'Hara,
  with the chain of hotels all up and down the coast, wants a good corner with
  two hundred feet frontage on Main Street. He's going to build a hotel. We'll
  have to take that up to-night at the meeting. The question is, do we present
  him with the ground for the sake of getting him down there, or do we make him
  pay, the same as other folks? He argues that the prestige of having an O'Hara
  House at Parowan is worth the site to put it on." He pursed his lips, which
  was his substitute for a smile.</p>

  <p>"Make him pay!" Doris exclaimed, laughing a bit. "You can bet he isn't
  going to build an O'Hara House at Parowan just to help make our town look
  nice. He'll charge boom prices and clean up a fortune. Why should we donate
  to the cause? Won't he be making his money off us and the things we're
  doing?"</p>

  <p>"<i>That's</i> the way to talk!" Rayfield beamed upon her with his good
  eye. "O'Hara's not in the hotel business for his health, you can bet on that.
  And if he doesn't build a hotel down there, some one else will."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but let it once be known that O'Hara's going to put up a hotel in
  Parowan, and our stock will take another jump. We could well afford to give
  him the ground to build on." Mr. Emmett's tone betrayed the fact that this
  point had been discussed before.</p>

  <p>"Oh, split the difference," Bill suggested impatiently. "Let him pick his
  own site, and charge him half price for it. You're both right, according to
  my understanding of the case. O'Hara'll clean up a bunch of money on the
  investment, just as Doris says. And John's right about the prestige of having
  an O'Hara House. Make him call it that trade name. Then he won't dare work
  off poor accommodations on the public. When folks know that they can get
  O'Hara standard of cooking and so on at Parowan, they'll come in droves. I
  reckon that's what makes a town."</p>

  <p>"That's the talk!" Rayfield patted approval on Bill's flat, muscular
  shoulder. "Suppose we make that a regular policy, folks? Cut the prices on
  building sites for all enterprises that will reflect credit on the town, to
  just half the selling price?" He looked from one to the other eagerly. "The
  selling price is going up steadily, you know. Having to pay something for a
  site will shut out the little shoestring propositions that go broke and leave
  empty houses behind them. That always looks bad in a town. If they have to
  pay for their building site, it means they'll have to have capital behind
  them. And no firm is going to sink money in real estate unless they mean
  business."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come on up to our sitting room and let's have the meeting there and
  get it over with," said Doris. "I'm terribly interested in the whole
  thing&mdash;but honestly, my feet are just ready to drop off! It's a radical
  change from desert shoes to French-heeled pumps, let me tell you."</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;come on up," Bill invited resignedly.</p>

  <p>Rayfield looked at Emmett.</p>

  <p>"Sure, if your wife isn't too tired," Emmett hesitated. "You've got an
  early start to make in the morning, remember."</p>

  <p>"Oh, fudge!" Doris placed a finger tip on the elevator button. "This is
  important. We don't want to go away and leave a lot of tag ends, do we, Bill?
  Because," she added, smiling up at them, "goodness only knows when we'll come
  back!"</p>

  <p>The elevator slid down, the door slid open and Doris stepped inside, Bill
  just behind her, his hand placed solicitously under her elbow.</p>

  <p>"We'd better get all the books and bring up, then," Mr. Rayfield
  suggested, standing just outside. "I think it will be a good idea to clean up
  everything, so John and I won't have to bother you again. You go on up, and
  we'll be right along in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>He gave them a smile like a benediction. When it was quite certain that
  the conversation had terminated, the elevator boy deferentially closed the
  door and conveyed bride and groom to the second floor with the air of one who
  waits upon royalty.</p>

  <p>"Shall I unlock the door for you, sir?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"No, thanks," drawled Bill. "I'm not paralyzed, sonny." But he slid a coin
  into the boy's hand to salve the rebuff.</p>

  <p>"Now, Bill-dear, you <i>must</i> give enough time to business to let John
  and Walter go ahead without having to bother us every day. You know, we're
  going to travel around, just wherever we take the notion we want to go. We
  don't want Parowan riding our necks all the time. Walter told me that if you
  signed the stock books in blank, and the Corporation check book, he wouldn't
  have to bother you at all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's giving them a pretty free hand, honey," Bill objected, laying his
  cheek against her silky hair as she stood within his arms.</p>

  <p>Doris turned in the embrace so that she could look into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why, Bill Dale! If you don't <i>trust</i> John and Walter, why have you
  got them in the company? Why is Walter Rayfield Vice President and General
  Manager, then, and John, Secretary and Treasurer? Bill-dear, don't you think
  you are rather inconsistent?"</p>

  <p>Bill kissed her.</p>

  <p>"Bill, it would just about break my heart to see you tie yourself down to
  running Parowan Consolidated. I think that would show a streak of narrowness
  in you, dear. It seems to me that the whole advantage of having the mine and
  the town site and everything is to be able to let others do the work and
  leave you free. You see, dear, they both resigned from good government
  positions to take hold and help organize the company, and the best way to
  show your gratitude, I think, is to trust them with the management now. We've
  got the control, haven't we? And they certainly have shown that they know
  exactly how to go ahead and make money out of the mine.</p>

  <p>"Why, dear man, just think! <i>You'd</i> have plugged along, just digging
  out the gold and selling it. <i>They've</i> made a fortune for us already,
  without taking out more than enough gold to make all the expenses of the
  organization and the town-site promotion, and mining and hauling. I don't
  know how they do it&mdash;but they certainly are wizards at getting in
  money."</p>

  <p>"I love you, little wife," said Bill irrelevantly. "If money will make you
  the happiest woman on earth, they can't dig up too much."</p>

  <p>Doris pulled him over to a red velvet couch and sat down beside him,
  snuggling against his straight, strong body.</p>

  <p>"Bill, you mustn't think I worship money above other things. I don't. But
  all my life I've heard one sentence that always grated on my nerves and my
  sense of justice. Whenever I wanted something nice, daddy or mother would
  say, 'We can't afford it.' They worked hard, and I worked and tried to do
  right always&mdash;and still we couldn't <i>afford</i> to enjoy life.</p>

  <p>"Bill-dear, I never want to hear that said to me again, as long as I
  live!" She drew away from him, so that she could look into his face. Her own
  was flushed and very earnest. "Now we're rich, I mean to have the things and
  enjoy the things we couldn't <i>afford</i>. I never want to wonder whether
  the money will hold out to the end of the trip. I want to buy things without
  asking what they cost. I&mdash;I'm just <i>hungry</i> for the world, Bill!
  And if you had to hurry back and look after things,
  I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bill gathered her into his arms, his throat contracting painfully at the
  sudden quiver of her lips. One day married, and Doris had tears in her
  eyes!</p>

  <p>"I'll make you one promise, right now," he said contritely. "I'll never
  bring you back to this country unless you want to come. And I'll fix it so
  that you'll always be able to afford anything you want. Why, all <i>I</i>
  want is to see you happy and keep you loving me, sweetheart. I could grin at
  the world if I were a hobo and had your love. So never worry about having to
  come back to Parowan or any other place."</p>

  <p>Doris rewarded him properly for that, and immediately made use of her
  woman's prerogative and had the last word.</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better lay aside that suspiciousness of yours and fix things
  so you won't <i>have</i> to come back," she pouted. "John and Walter are
  perfectly capable of managing things, and it's to their interest. Look at the
  salary they're getting&mdash;and the big block of stock you gave them! Our
  interests are their interests, Bill-dear&mdash;and they can do the work. You
  did your share when you tramped the desert and found the mine. It's their
  turn now at the job."</p>

  <p>Into the echo of that speech walked John and Walter, drawn into
  Christian-name intimacy in the past two months. Their arms were full of
  books&mdash;too precious to be carried by anxious bellboys&mdash;their heads
  were full of plans and the details of their work. Their hearts were full,
  too, of zeal, perchance. One must judge most persons by their faces and the
  words they speak.</p>

  <p>So Bill spent a weary two hours signing stock certificates in blank, on
  the line in the right-hand corner entitled <span class=
  "smcap">"President"</span> in small caps. They were dignified-looking
  certificates, but Bill grew very tired of them before he was through.</p>

  <p>After that, Bill rubbed the cramp out of his right hand and wrist, and
  signed a large book of blank checks with "<span class="smcap">Parowan
  Consolidated Mining Company, Incorporated</span>," printed across the face in
  letters much larger than the name of the bank. Bill thought suspiciously of
  certain dishonest uses to which his signature as president might be put, and
  immediately throttled suspicion with the stern hand of loyalty. Doris was
  right. If he didn't trust John Emmett and Walter Rayfield, why were they
  officers in his company?</p>

  <p>"There's one thing I want done," he said abruptly, pushing the signed
  blanks away from him with a sigh of relief. "I want that whole
  block&mdash;the whole <i>block</i>, remember&mdash;where my tent and dugout
  stands made over to me. I want a high board fence built around it, with
  spikes in the top. I want a padlock on the gate. I want that tent and cellar
  left just as I left it, with Tommy as caretaker. And I want Tommy to have a
  block next to it, to do as he pleases with it. Can you make out the papers
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>They could. Bill sat for some time silent, smoking meditatively and
  staring at the door through which the fate of Parowan had passed, in the
  persons of John S. Emmett and Walter B. Rayfield.</p>

  <p>He was a rich man, even now. He was growing richer so fast that he felt
  slightly dizzy when he tried to follow the process by which his bank account
  increased. It wasn't the gold in the mine that did it&mdash;yet. Doris was
  right; the gold shipped had just about paid the expense of exploitation.
  People were buying town lots at boom prices and selling them at double what
  they paid. He was not the only man who was growing rich. Even Tommy was
  talking about starting a saloon and calling it "Tommy's Place" with naïve
  triteness.</p>

  <p>As Parowan Consolidated was selling in the open market, Bill was a
  millionaire. As Parowan lots were selling, Bill's income was better than a
  thousand dollars a day&mdash;real money, that, with a certain increase as men
  flocked to the new camp. Already that camp was noisy&mdash;garish,
  unwholesome, no place at all for Doris to live. Bill had tried to prevent
  that. He had wanted a decent town, had worked and sweated and sworn to make
  it so. But Parowan was like a landslide started with one ill-judged step. It
  has gathered a devastating power as it progressed, until now, Bill knew that
  it was out of hand; a boom town, living up to the reputation of other boom
  towns. Only&mdash;and Bill sighed relievedly as he thought of
  it&mdash;<i>his</i> boom had a mine to give it a solid foundation.</p>

  <p>"No reason in the world why Parowan shouldn't be on the map a hundred
  years from now," he muttered, and began to unlace the first pair of
  patent-leather shoes he had ever worn.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; BILL LEARNS ABOUT WOMEN FROM 'ER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A MYSTERIOUS, clotted haze of gray and blue and smoke
  smudges, shot with rose and deeper tints of carmine; a churning of white foam
  in an oily sweep of undulating water that caught the lights from the sunset
  so that they swam through a magic floating world; screaming gulls flapping
  close, their pink legs hanging straight down like little sticks; bellowing
  boat whistles, deep siren blasts, pricking lights in the haze. With frankly
  confessed eagerness, Doris stood with Bill in the bow of the ferry and gazed
  enraptured, her face pallid with emotion.</p>

  <p>Bill looked down at her, knew himself forgotten in that moment of blissful
  arrival into her dream world. A vague hurt, a slow understanding, sobered his
  face as he watched her. Then, like a blow that forces open a door, Bill saw.
  There, mirrored in her eyes, on the tremulous lips, glowing through the
  pallor of her cheeks, was a joy, an incredulous rapture such as he himself
  had known, not once, but many times in the past weeks. Doris was trying to
  feel the reality of a dream come true. Bill remembered poignantly how he had
  struggled to express that emotion, and the paucity of words that had held him
  dumb.</p>

  <p>He had felt it when his lips first touched the lips of Doris; when she had
  said that she loved him. Doris&mdash;why, Doris had wanted to talk about the
  gold, about whatever came into her mind. Things, other than their love, could
  claim her thoughts, while she stood abashed before the miracle. He had
  thought that Doris was different. She didn't show her feelings much; women
  were shy about love. It never occurred to him to question the depth of her
  love until that moment.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't she have that look in her eyes&mdash;<i>then</i>?" he thought
  sharply. He had never seen just this look in her face; no, nor anything
  approaching that look. There was an answer, but Bill shut his mind against
  it. And then, as if a devil had prompted the words, Doris turned and spoke a
  sentence which Bill recognized.</p>

  <p>"I was always scared to dream I'd ever actually be here," she said, and
  her voice was hushed. "Oh, Bill-dear, I'm so happy my heart just
  <i>aches</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Are you, honey?" Bill bit his lips and hid something away where even his
  own heart must never find it. She had elaborated on his broken speech there
  at Parowan Number One, but Bill set that down to a more versatile vocabulary.
  He too had been so happy his heart had ached; but he had not been able to
  find those words to say.</p>

  <p>Desert tan and mail-order trousseau hurt her pride terribly. She insisted
  upon a quiet hotel until the defects could be remedied but Bill only laughed
  at her vanity. He could call it that now, though he loved the
  trait,&mdash;since he could gratify it.</p>

  <p>"When you've got a million dollars in your fist nobody's going to mind if
  you walk into the Palace in a gingham dish apron," he told her shrewdly. "And
  besides, if you had everything you think you need, you'd lose the fun of
  buying." He paused, glancing from the window of the taxi,&mdash;there were
  not so many, in those days. "What do you like best, little lady, diamonds,
  pearls or rubies?"</p>

  <p>"All of them," Doris stated solemnly.</p>

  <p>They laughed together, and Doris squeezed Bill's arm and said she was
  happy.</p>

  <p>Mrs. William Gordon Dale proved herself a capable young woman who could
  adapt herself quickly to changed circumstances and surroundings. Once she
  discovered that desert tan can scarcely be distinguished from the carefully
  cultivated tan of ocean beaches, her self-consciousness melted into calm
  assurance. Likewise merged the mail-order trousseau into the almost-latest
  fashion of gowns, hats, cloaks, of a restrained elegance and a clever
  adaptation to that indefinable thing she called her "style" and clung to with
  firmness in the face of gorgeous temptations.</p>

  <p>Wherefore, she arrived in Santa Barbara (Bill accompanying her, of course)
  with only five trunks and the sophisticated air of a girl who was born to
  luxury.</p>

  <p>"You sure don't look as if you've ever had your hands in dough," was
  Bill's way of putting it. "I never noticed your hands so much before. I
  always loved them, but now I keep looking at them for their beauty."</p>

  <p>"There are arts and wiles, Bill-dear, that make a heap of difference. It
  just takes time and money&mdash;and I have loads of both. Weren't those
  people lovely, that we met on the beach?"</p>

  <p>"Baker Cole and his wife? Yes, he struck me just about right. Human cuss,
  that you can slip an improper remark to without wishing you had kept your
  darn mouth shut and concealed your ignorance. I'm sick of being made to think
  that desert words put me in the natural-curiosity class. Darn 'em, I've had
  more education than half the Johnnies that give me the tolerant look. There
  are men in this hotel with more money than I've got, that say, 'They told he
  and I&mdash;&mdash;' and never turn a hair. But if I forget to stand up when
  a woman comes within rifle shot, they look as if I had insulted their wives.
  Lord, little lady, I've lived too long where there weren't any women! A
  fellow gets out of practice."</p>

  <p>Doris came over and rumpled his hair with her meticulously manicured
  fingers that had won his astonished admiration.</p>

  <p>"You know, Bill-dear, there's another thing you forget. You must take soup
  from the <i>side</i> of the spoon; and peas, dear man, are eaten with a
  fork&mdash;out here."</p>

  <p>"I know it&mdash;but darn it, I like the juice. If I ain't wealthy enough
  to take mine with a spoon, I'll get out and rake in more money. Funny, isn't
  it, Doris? In the desert I felt myself a Beau Brummel&mdash;as I understand
  that term&mdash;amongst the miners and prospectors I came in contact with. I
  was as good as anybody&mdash;better than some. Out here, they make me feel
  like a cave man with his first clothes on."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure your manners are very good, Bill-dear," Doris comforted him
  absently. "Just a few little points to remember&mdash;things one never
  encounters in the desert. If you watch the others &mdash;at table, you
  know&mdash;and do as they do about which fork&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not on your life!" (After six weeks of hotel honeymoon and their clothes
  inextricably mixed in the dresser drawers, and Bill constantly on the alert
  lest he hurt Doris' feelings, he could argue with his divinity quite as if
  she were human.) "I'm not going to make a monkey of myself, copying the
  fellow who sits across the table. I'll do what's comfortable for me and the
  rest of the bunch, and let it go at that. I don't aspire to be any lady's
  man, Doris, nor any society bird. Men like Baker Cole don't grin behind their
  hands if you go first into the dining room and let your wife follow. I
  know&mdash;I saw you blush for shame last night, honey. But your old Bill
  wants to break trail for you all his life. It's second nature for me to go
  first and see what's ahead of us, and put it out of your way if it's
  dangerous."</p>

  <p>Doris laughed at him, showing the dimple in her left cheek,&mdash;with a
  faint film of powder distinguishable there nowadays.</p>

  <p>"You dear old silly, just take this view of the matter, and it'll help you
  remember the rules, maybe: I might be kidnaped behind your back, and you
  wouldn't know it, stalking ahead of me the way you do. You're supposed to
  shoo a lady gently before you down the aisle, and see that handsome villains
  don't cut in behind you." Her hand slipped down and patted his lean, freshly
  shaven jaw.</p>

  <p>"Dear man, is the money holding out?" she asked suddenly, coming at last
  to the thing that was foremost in her mind.</p>

  <p>Bill let his head drop back against the cushioned chair and laughed at
  her, his eyes half-closed and feasting on her face.</p>

  <p>"You never wanted to ask that question as long as you lived," he reminded
  her teasingly.</p>

  <p>"I know, dear. I don't mean that I think we're running short. I can't
  begin to spend my share that John sends me. But you know, dear, we're needing
  more and more, as we get the hang of it. We keep finding out about things
  rich people have and do, that I'm sure I never dreamed of, in the desert.
  Most of them have things that date back to their fathers and grandfathers,
  and we naturally have to spend a lot, just bringing ourselves up to date. For
  instance, Mrs. Baker Cole is thinking about a new automobile and wondering
  what kind she had better have. And Bill-dear&mdash;<i>we</i> haven't even had
  our first, yet!"</p>

  <p>"Lord, what a world!" chuckled Bill. "And you're wondering if we can have
  one. Honey, you wait and see what kind of an automobile Mrs. Baker Cole buys,
  and then you buy two just like it. Or else you find one that costs just twice
  as much as hers."</p>

  <p>"Don't tease so, Bill. But really, I <i>do</i> want one. And I&mdash;miss
  Little Dorrit, sort of. There are beautiful trails here, winding around
  through trees, and I've noticed that the really nicest people ride every
  morning. I've wished, when I saw them starting out or coming back, that I
  could go, too."</p>

  <p>"Do you want Little Dorrit, honey?" Bill lifted the necklace of Parowan
  gold spun into the finest of twisted threads and set with emeralds that made
  her skin look whiter. Bill had stood over the jeweler while that necklace was
  being made, and the result was a happy one.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;Little Dorrit hasn't got the style. I was wondering if we
  couldn't buy a couple of saddle horses. I'm crazy about Mrs. Burlingame's
  riding habit, Bill&mdash;and I've got one planned that would beat it. And I
  know the tailor who made hers. And Bill, couldn't we&mdash;no, I don't want
  to take a house, either. Not yet. I don't know enough of the nicest people,
  and couldn't entertain. I'd rather just stay here for awhile longer. Wouldn't
  you?"</p>

  <p>Bill secretly loathed hotel life, and his heart had given a great thump
  when she almost wanted a house like the Burlingame's. But he did not mention
  either his loathing or his desire. Why should he? His business was to keep
  Doris happy, to gratify every passing whim, except when the whim changed
  before gratification was humanly possible.</p>

  <p>They went together next day and chose an automobile, and hired a chauffeur
  warranted to give satisfaction and promised a speedy demise if ever he forgot
  to drive cautiously when his mistress was in the car.</p>

  <p>In the new automobile they drove out to a famous horsebreeder's place, and
  bought two saddle horses, and Doris ordered her riding habit and was
  deliciously happy for several hours. Then she awoke to the fact that it was a
  sheer waste of money, time and energy to have no maid to look after her
  clothes and do her hair and fetch and carry. Besides, Bill was getting
  acquainted with men and wanted to go here and there, looking up what he
  called "propositions," and Doris felt that it would look much better, and
  give her more real freedom, if she had a maid to accompany her on drives and
  at the beach&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And then I wouldn't have to keep an eye on my parasol and purse and book
  and bathrobe, and everything, Bill-dear," she detailed, unconsciously
  justifying what she instinctively felt would not meet with Bill's approval.
  "My maid would look after everything while I was in the surf. That would be
  her business." She was talking to Bill's back, which made her uncomfortable.
  She wished he would not stand staring out of the window, like that, while she
  talked things over with him. It was getting to be a regular habit. She always
  liked to see a person's face when she talked.</p>

  <p>"You don't mind, do you, Bill&mdash;if I have a maid? All the
  nicest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Anything your little heart desires!" Bill said, turning abruptly and
  smiling steadfastly down at her where she was sitting on the floor, on a
  purple silk cushion, trying on a pair of satin slippers that didn't seem to
  want to go on at the heel. He watched her, his eyes studying her flushed face
  and tousled hair.</p>

  <p>"I reckon you do need help," he said, a dryness in his tone of which he
  was not quite aware, and which Doris missed altogether in her absorption. "If
  you had somebody to do all the things you spend your time on, maybe we could
  enjoy life&mdash;better," he added hastily. "We could be together more,
  couldn't we?"</p>

  <p>"Together more?" Doris looked up, the silver shoehorn poised in her hand.
  "Good gracious! Aren't we together every single minute, almost? Bill, see if
  you can get this pesky slipper on; the other one's all right; they're half a
  size too small, but they're the only pair that just matches that new lace
  gown." (Doris had already learned to say gown and frock, and to avoid the
  word dress except as a verb.)</p>

  <p>Bill knelt and lifted the foot, thrilling again at the touch of her slim
  ankle.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember the night you came to camp, all wet and cold,
  and&mdash;you let me unlace your boots?" He smiled wistfully into her eyes.
  "I was all a-tremble, honey&mdash;I had to keep my lip between my teeth, and
  bite down hard to steady me. I was so happy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What about? The privilege of handling wet boot laces?" Doris leaned and
  tried to push her toes farther into the slipper.</p>

  <p>"They were <i>your</i> boot laces." Bill's soul withdrew from her
  matter-of-factness, much as Sister Mitchell used to draw into her shell at
  the first blast on the saxophone.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if the housekeeper won't have something to stretch this slipper
  on," said Doris. "Can you find out, dear? I simply <i>must</i> make them do
  for to-night, or I can't wear that gown."</p>

  <p>"Why can't you wear something else, then, and be comfortable?" Bill set
  her foot on the floor and got up. "You'd better take these back and change
  them."</p>

  <p>"I can't," Doris said shortly. "I've ordered our table decorated to
  harmonize with this particular outfit. You don't understand, Bill-dear. Men
  get the effect, all right, and call a woman beautiful or ugly or just so-so,
  and never dream that it's because the details have been thought out, or
  haven't. I've noticed things. I know exactly how women get that carelessly
  beautiful effect. It doesn't just happen so, dear man. They spend
  <i>hours</i>, just thinking up the careless touches.</p>

  <p>"Now, just to show you," she expanded graciously for Bill's education, "I
  have fallen into the habit of telling the head waiter that I'd like certain
  flowers, or whatever it is I choose, on our table for dinner. Then I dress
  accordingly. Nobody knows it's planned, but I'll bet you, dear, they get the
  effect just the same. The stupid ones pile it all on their persons and merely
  look new-rich. You've never seen <i>me</i> look new-rich, have you,
  Bill?"</p>

  <p>"Not on your life." Bill was startled into a fresh appraisal of his bride.
  Heretofore he had looked on, amused at her plunge into the pleasures of
  fashionable hotel life. Now it struck him suddenly that the slim, competent
  desert girl who could break a horse to the saddle or rope and brand a calf,
  bake pies and bread to make a chef envious, was bringing that clever brain
  into action in a field entirely new to her, and was demonstrating the same
  clever competence which had distinguished her on the ranch.</p>

  <p>With a new respect for her intelligence he saw to the detail of having the
  slipper stretched. Afterward he observed that Doris had really achieved a
  small triumph of harmonious beauty. The table decoration did add something
  indefinable to her own sweet self; something which caused the eyes of others
  to turn their way in unconscious tribute to her beauty, as one looks and
  looks again at any other charming picture. As a votary of wealth and fashion
  Mrs. William Gordon Dale was beyond criticism, destined to become a high
  priestess of the art of effective extravagance.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; BAKER COLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BAKER COLE was a man who did his own thinking and was
  willing that the other fellow should do the same; indeed, he was tolerantly
  disdainful when the other fellow failed to do the same. He was so rich that
  he did not think much about money, or judge a man by his Bradstreet rating.
  Money flowed toward Baker Cole apparently of its own volition. He had started
  life with a fortune for his birthright, and he had gone on his way with a
  humorous philosophy which armored him against flattery, abuse or the
  deliberate attacks of other men whose fortunes equalled his but who were not
  content with another man's well-being.</p>

  <p>Baker Cole's interest was first attracted to Bill's straight suppleness in
  the surf, and by the fact that, brown though he was to shoulders and chest,
  Bill was just learning to swim. Because of this incongruity, Baker Cole was
  given the opportunity of grabbing Bill by the hair and saving him from a
  vicious undertow. He wondered a bit, until he discovered that a man working
  in a sleeveless, low-necked undershirt under a desert sun may have the mark
  of a beach lounger burned into his skin.</p>

  <p>"That accounts for your legs not being tanned." Baker Cole hauled himself
  out of the surf like a big, good-looking seal, and lay puffing and looking
  Bill over. "Wish I had muscles like yours," he remarked, crooking his finger
  toward a young man who immediately hurried up with cigarettes and matches.
  Bill accepted a smoke, and the two began to talk.</p>

  <p>An hour later, they went toeing deep in the fine, loose sand to where a
  huge, striped umbrella hid all but a shapely, canvas-shod foot. Bill helped
  Doris to her feet and introduced Baker Cole, who appraised her shrewdly with
  one glance and decided that his wife would like her.</p>

  <p>That began the acquaintance. In a week, the Baker Coles and the William
  Gordon Dales (Doris had quietly insisted upon full names from the first hotel
  register,&mdash;and had put it over with complete success) were pairing off
  together quite naturally and without deliberate intent; which is the test of
  congeniality the world over.</p>

  <p>From a surreptitiously acquired paid teacher, Doris had learned bridge.
  She succeeded in teaching Bill, chiefly because he couldn't bear to
  disappoint her and because it gave him an opportunity to watch her hands
  without betraying a fatuous admiration. He had learned that Doris considered
  open love-making bad form, and was acquiring a more restrained manner of
  worship in accordance with her expressed wish. Wherefore, Bill willingly
  learned bridge after hours in their rooms, when he was dead tired, and
  watched unobtrusively for some sign of weariness in the sweet face opposite
  him. The reward for that was a more complete intimacy between the Baker Coles
  and the William Gordon Dales.</p>

  <p>Bill could not remember afterwards just when or how Doris first found her
  pleasures apart from him. He saw that "nice" women were becoming her friends,
  and of course there were little parties and purely feminine gatherings to
  which Doris went with avid enjoyment. She would sit and tell Bill all about
  them afterwards, and Bill would listen bewilderingly to detailed descriptions
  of gowns and refreshments and scores and prizes, and to gossip not quite so
  harmless.</p>

  <p>Sometimes his thoughts would wander to certain experiences of his
  own,&mdash;innocent experiences, though he did not tell her about them
  always. Baker Cole was at present amused with the spectacle of money flowing
  out of crude oil pumped from the ground. It amazed even him to see how fast
  the oil could turn into money. He called Bill's attention to the phenomenon,
  and Bill was immediately interested, and for reasons which he kept to
  himself.</p>

  <p>Through Baker Cole's shrewd acquaintance with the game of directing and
  augmenting the flow of money, Bill turned tiny trickles toward his own bank
  account, and was amazed at the speed with which they became swift-moving
  streams.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I thought Parowan was a miracle I'd never see repeated," he
  confided one day to Baker Cole. "Money commenced piling up before we started
  to move the gold. We laid out a town site, and people came in droves to buy
  lots and start building. It used to give me a chill at the chances they were
  taking. What if there wasn't a real mine there? Where would the town get off?
  Baker, if those men had lost on the gamble, who'd be
  responsible&mdash;me?"</p>

  <p>Baker Cole rolled a fragrant cigar between his lips and regarded Bill
  meditatively through half-closed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Depends on what or who induced them to speculate," he said bluntly. "How
  did you work it, Bill?"</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head and looked away to where breakers were beating white
  foam against a segment of cliffs.</p>

  <p>"Hell, I dunno," he confessed helplessly. "I found the mine. Then some
  government men came along and advised me to incorporate and to lay out a town
  site. I got them to resign their positions and take hold of it. We laid out
  the town site, and took some gold up to Goldfield and showed it, and that
  started the parade. Folks tromped each other's feet to get in."</p>

  <p>"What did you do then? Sell out?" Perhaps Baker Cole knew, since he was an
  exceedingly well-informed man. But he waited for Bill to tell him.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm president of the company. They fixed things so I wouldn't have to
  be on the ground, and we came out here to play around awhile." Bill started
  to explain that he had not wanted to leave, but shut his teeth upon the
  words. That would be unfair to Doris.</p>

  <p>"How are things going, with you out here? Got any idea?"</p>

  <p>Bill grinned, with a worried look back of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Two railroads are busting a lung trying to see which one will whistle
  first at the depot," he detailed laconically. "I guess that tells the tale,
  doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Several." Baker Cole took out his cigar and looked it over carefully
  before he put it back in his mouth.</p>

  <p>"The money keeps coming in," Bill went on. "Everything's fine. We're
  building a mill and that employs a good many men. A lot of companies have
  sprung up, claiming to have discovered gold&mdash;which I guess they have.
  The <i>Parowan Record</i> comes out every Saturday, and there's a bank and
  hotel&mdash;you know. It's a <i>town</i>. I feel like a loafer," he admitted
  ruefully. "But the boys are doing all I could do, I guess. They say
  everything is running smooth, and the town's a dandy&mdash;for a boom town.
  Soon as the railroads get there, so as to haul material faster, there'll be
  some fine buildings go up. Contracts are let and all."</p>

  <p>He sighed and looked around at Baker Cole, seeking understanding.</p>

  <p>"Parowan kind of rides my neck," he said simply. "It's all right&mdash;our
  mine is rich enough to hold it up till other mines get to producing&mdash;but
  I can't help feeling responsible for it, just the same. I feel as if I ought
  to be on the job myself."</p>

  <p>"The wife likes it here," Baker Cole stated calmly.</p>

  <p>"Yes. She hates the desert. I wouldn't take her back there into that raw
  mining town&mdash;I wouldn't think of such a thing."</p>

  <p>Baker Cole finished his cigar. Very deliberately he put out his hand, drew
  the ash tray closer and laid the cigar butt exactly in the middle of the
  tray, moving it twice, fractions of an inch to the center. Bill, his eyes
  fixed upon him, knew that Baker Cole was not conscious of tray, cigar, or
  mathematical measurements.</p>

  <p>"Bill, I've made money all my life," he said, drawing a long breath as if
  an important matter had been successfully accomplished. "As far as it's
  possible to make money honestly, I've made it. Silver in Mexico, copper in
  Michigan and Montana and Colorado, crude petroleum here in California; I've
  taken more millions from the ground, Bill, than you'd dare believe if I told
  you. Had half a million when I was born. Then I was taught how to take care
  of what I had&mdash;and I learned how to make more.</p>

  <p>"This Parowan of yours, now, would be something in my line; only, I'd want
  to take it in the start and handle it myself. I wouldn't invest a dime in the
  other fellow's game&mdash;not if he were my own brother. I'm not afraid of
  losing money&mdash;I <i>can't</i> lose money, seems like. It's the game. I
  see a chance to get something out of the ground that the world has use for,
  and I go after it like a dog after a ground squirrel. Money piles up when
  I've got it&mdash;but I've had the fun of the getting. And of course the
  money helps to play again. Dollars, you know, are mostly what you dig with.
  Dollars are the master tool of industry&mdash;and I don't see why the working
  men howl so about the man that can furnish that master tool. You take
  Parowan, now. Leaving out the gamblers that are risking their money, you've
  helped many a poor man to a job at top wages. Ain't that so?"</p>

  <p>"I reckon it is," Bill assented perfunctorily. "There's always big wages
  where there's a boom, and many a man got his start that way. But you've hit
  the spot that hurts. It's the fun of doing things that I want. The money's
  coming in fast enough for all we want, but I'm a loafer for the first time in
  my life, Baker. My Lord! Think of a grown man putting in day after day just
  taking a horseback ride in the morning and a swim in the afternoon; and
  calling that exercise!</p>

  <p>"When I was prospecting, Baker, I put in my time from dawn to dusk, hiking
  over the hills or swinging a pick. I ate because I was hungry. Now, by gosh,
  folks don't get hungry&mdash;they don't give themselves a chance. They eat
  because somebody's paid a big price to make grub taste good! This is a mighty
  pretty place to play around in, Baker&mdash;but I can't make a business of
  doing nothing." He made himself a cigarette&mdash;rolling his own whenever he
  was not under Doris' watchful eye&mdash;and lighted it absently. "Doris likes
  this sort of thing," he added pensively. "It's all right for women&mdash;but
  I'll be damned if it's any kinda life for a man!"</p>

  <p>Baker Cole chuckled somewhere down in his chest and laid an impressive
  forefinger on Bill's arm.</p>

  <p>"You come on and play with <i>me</i>, in my game," he invited. "I can't
  promise you won't make money at it&mdash;but you'll have fun."</p>

  <p>"I bet I would, at that," said Bill. "But my wife doesn't want me to get
  into business. She wants me to run along and play." It was the nearest that
  Bill had ever come to uttering a complaint. He did not realize that it was
  even distantly related to a protest against the future which Doris had mapped
  out for them.</p>

  <p>But as he spoke, he saw a swift, mental panorama of cities and shops and
  long, pillared, hotel corridors and suites furnished in velvet upholstery. He
  felt his feet sinking into the sickish softness of deep-piled carpets, and
  boys with bright buttons and little caps and silver trays dogging him with
  the prematurely calculating smirk. He saw long, shaded avenues down which he
  was carried swiftly on cushions,&mdash;always cushions and carpets and a
  smothery, scented atmosphere that sometimes nauseated him with its cloying
  sweetness.</p>

  <p>He shut his eyes, pressing his lips together in silent revolt against the
  picture. And there, sharply outlined before him, were the stark, barren hills
  of the desert. Volcanic rubble in the foreground, and stunted sage, and a
  lizard ducking its head with a queer, ticking motion while it watched him
  from a rock; soft shadows lying at the foot of great boulders, and all the
  magic tints of distance; the two burros shuffling before him, picking their
  way daintily, setting tiny feet between the rocks; Sister Mitchell, horny and
  gray and solemn, clinging to the canvas with claws thrust out from her shell
  the size of a dinner plate; and Luella, a vivid bit of green in the gray
  monotone, riding gallantly the pack of Wise One and talking gravely of things
  a parrot shouldn't know; and Hez, solemnly herding the little company and
  believing himself indispensable,&mdash;Bill's teeth came down hard on his
  under lip.</p>

  <p>"You're homesick," Baker Cole's voice shattered the vision for the
  moment.</p>

  <p>Bill swallowed and could not meet his eyes. He threw away his cigarette,
  gone cold between his lips&mdash;bitten, too, in the sharp pain of
  remembrance&mdash;and reached for his sack of tobacco.</p>

  <p>"I want the crunch of gravel under my feet," he admitted, smiling a
  twisted smile. "The ocean kind of filled the hankering for distance&mdash;but
  I want to get out and walk and walk&mdash;&mdash; Aw, hell! A man can't have
  everything at once. I had the desert, and all the while I dreamed of being
  rich and not having to eat beans and bacon. I was almost as sick of that
  country as Mrs. Dale was. But somehow&mdash;she takes to this life better
  than I do. She hates to be reminded of Nevada, and has been trying to coax
  her folks to sell out and come to the Coast. I don't blame her&mdash;not for
  one minute. It's no place for a woman, back there."</p>

  <p>Baker Cole rose and flicked cigar ashes off his vest.</p>

  <p>"You're dated up with me for a little trip down Bakersfield way," he
  grinned. "I'll show you desert&mdash;and a game you'll like to play. It's
  going to be a stag party, so you'll have to get your wife's permission. We'll
  be gone a week, maybe. You'll have to sleep on the ground and cook over a
  camp fire. Bring a roll of blankets, if you like. Can you make it
  to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>Doris thought it was rather sudden. She had several things on for the
  week, however,&mdash;things which Bill-dear would not enjoy at all. Moreover,
  she had learned that close friendship with the Baker Coles was like being
  favored by royalty, and the necessity of explaining that her husband was off
  somewhere with Baker Cole for a week would cause the other women to twitter
  enviously and draw her closer within their hallowed circle.</p>

  <p>"It'll be awfully lonesome, dear man, but I do think you'll enjoy the
  change. Don't worry one minute about me, Bill-dear. With my maid and
  chauffeur, I shall be all right. And Mrs. Baker Cole has asked me to stay
  with her, if I feel at all strange here at the hotel. Perhaps I shall. I
  haven't decided, yet."</p>

  <p>Had she met the situation with a shade less equanimity, Bill would not
  have gone with Baker Cole. And that would have made a great difference, later
  on. But Destiny has a way of providing for the seemingly unimportant things
  of life,&mdash;which are never unimportant, whether we know it or not. He
  went with Baker Cole down into a region where men were pumping wealth from
  the ground deep under the sage-covered plains. His going was the beginning of
  several changes in Bill's life.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">XV. &mdash; "MARY'S GOING TO HAVE A HOME!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BILL sat in a deep chair and held out his arms. Timorously,
  as if she were taking a great risk, a white-capped nurse stooped starchily
  and placed within the curve of them a soft little bundle. Bill held his
  breath until the precious, warm little body lay cuddled against his
  chest.</p>

  <p>Once each day, for a stingy ten minutes or so, Bill was permitted to hold
  his daughter in his arms. Sometimes, if the nurse and Doris forgot their
  vigilance for a space, Bill could fumble and uncover the smallest, pinkest,
  squirmiest feet he had ever seen in his life. On one memorable occasion, when
  fire engines went clanging past the silk-hung windows, he had been left
  unobserved long enough to brush the soft pink soles against his lips.</p>

  <p>Little Miss Mary Dale was growing at the astonishing rate of a pound a
  week, which Bill considered phenomenal and told of whenever he decided that
  it would not be a breach of etiquette to admit that he was human enough to be
  proud of his baby; which tells the story of Bill's servitude to conventions
  which he hated even while he meekly obeyed the rules.</p>

  <p>What Bill wanted to do was carry his daughter down into the lobby and show
  her off to everybody who came in. Why not, since there wasn't another baby in
  San Francisco that could come within a mile of her for looks and
  intelligence? What he did do was sneak up to the room set aside for the
  nursery&mdash;they were still living in a hotel, which at this particular
  time was the Palace&mdash;and pull down the silken coverlets and gaze at
  little Mary until he was discovered and shooed away. After two months of
  this, Bill was beginning to feel abused. She was <i>his</i> baby, as well as
  Doris'. He believed that he had a right to look at her now and then, since
  Doris assumed the privilege of rocking her and talking unintelligibly to her
  by the hour.</p>

  <p>Still, Bill was accustomed to carrying a proper sense of his limitations
  about with him. A year had convinced him that husbands didn't amount to much,
  after all; that they were frequently a real obstacle to a woman's pursuit of
  happiness. And since his whole soul was still fixed upon making Doris
  completely happy, he eliminated himself from the scene whenever he saw a
  certain look in the eyes of his wife, and ministered to her happiness as
  unobtrusively as possible. One deep hurt remained with Bill, do what he would
  to forget it. Doris had not been pleased about little Mary,&mdash;until she
  had actually arrived and won her own place in the family. That had hurt Bill
  terribly and made his own eagerness seem a fault which he must hide as best
  he could.</p>

  <p>Well, women had their own ideas of things, their own hopes and ambitions.
  Doris didn't seem to have had enough of the glitter of life, yet. She didn't
  want to have a house and settle down to real home life. Bill was beginning to
  feel that he did not understand her at all. Home life would be lonely, she
  complained; would shut her away from the things she loved best. For instance,
  Doris never tired of the big, beautiful dining places with the music and the
  soft lights, the flash of jewels and the hovering, obsequious servants. She
  wanted the deference that bowed and waited for largess. She loved the smiles
  and the nods from rich diners at other tables. She loved to have her maid
  telephone to the steward that he would please lay so many extra covers at the
  William Gordon Dale table. And would he please see that there were just a few
  orchids peeping out from dark-green foliage, massed very low,&mdash;that
  glossy green which Mrs. Dale likes so well?</p>

  <p>And then she liked to forget all about the dinner until the guests had
  actually arrived, and to know that the arrangements would be perfect to the
  slightest detail,&mdash;with Doris herself the most perfect part of it,
  smiling and showing the dimple in her left cheek, and sparkling across at her
  husband, addressing him humorously as Bill-dear. Doris, Bill observed
  (because the good Lord gave him powers of observation which worked
  automatically) had begun calling him Bill-dear openly, in social gatherings,
  immediately after she heard Mrs. Baker Cole say "angel husband" in an
  adorably quizzical tone that never failed to bring a smile. It rather spoiled
  the Bill-dear for him in private, but Doris never guessed that.</p>

  <p>Neither did she guess Bill's inner shame that his child should be born in
  a hotel. Bill flushed in secret over the thought that, years afterward, when
  little Mary asked about her birthplace, her parents must refer her to suite
  E, Palace Hotel,&mdash;which had housed thousands before their baby opened
  her eyes there, and would house thousands after she had been carried away.
  Being born in a hotel, in Bill's estimation, was a little better than being
  born on a train, but not much.</p>

  <p>So Bill's dream of a home with Doris&mdash;a place of their very
  own&mdash;seemed as far off as ever; and the fact that he could have bought a
  mansion fine enough even for Doris with the money he had paid to hotel
  cashiers in the past twelve months did not help him to resignation.</p>

  <p>A nomadic life; a life that to Bill seemed inexcusably shiftless,
  temporary. They had sampled several hotels, in the several cities they had
  visited during the first few months. They were all alike,&mdash;luxurious
  shelters for the traveling rich. He went about thinking how all the other
  guests had homes somewhere; places where they dropped anchor occasionally, at
  least, and took stock of themselves. He began to try and hide the fact that
  he and Doris had no home; that they were always tagged with a number and
  their mail messed up with forwarding addresses. And now, here was little Miss
  Mary without a home that she could look back to afterwards with affection. To
  Bill the thing was becoming a disgrace, the blame resting on his own
  shoulders. He had promised Doris that she should live where she pleased. Now
  he owed another duty to his daughter.</p>

  <p>"She's beginning to notice things, Bill-dear." Doris came up and sat on
  the arm of a near-by chair. "To-day her eyes followed the flash of my
  rings&mdash;I tried her out, and she really did notice. Wake up, s'eepy
  thing! Show daddy how 'em can smile!"</p>

  <p>"We'll have to get a place of our own," Bill began tentatively,
  consciously treading thin ice. "We can't have her think a hotel like this is
  all the kind of home there is in the world. Honey, don't you think a nice
  house up on the hill&mdash;or maybe in some other town&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bill, please don't start that! You're gone half the time,
  almost&mdash;running around the country playing you're doing important
  things. What would I do in a great big house with nobody around but servants?
  I'd go crazy, that's all. And then, if we wanted to go somewhere, like New
  York or Europe, there would be the house to worry about. As it is, all we
  have to do is pack our trunks&mdash;and we can hire professional packers to
  do that. We have every comfort we could possibly have at home, and a lot
  besides. And I can see people, Bill, without giving a dinner or a card party
  or something. I'm going to have an at-home day&mdash;lots of permanent guests
  here do. And if I want to entertain, look at the advantages.</p>

  <p>"Besides," she added artfully, "you know you couldn't keep in touch with
  men half so easily if you were struck off in a big house on Nob Hill or
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>Bill did not answer for a minute. He was apparently quite absorbed with
  the baby's hands; he had never seen such tiny, soft hands before.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't run around so much, honey, if I had a home," he said quietly,
  looking up at Doris.</p>

  <p>"Oh, fudge! Men with homes are gone <i>more</i>. You can't fool me! I've
  heard the women talk who have homes. Their husbands are always gone
  somewhere, their servants are always stealing them blind or quitting, and the
  house is a white elephant. Besides, I don't know where I'd like to live
  permanently. I can't picture myself settling down in any one town&mdash;can
  you, Bill? Now be honest."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Parowan."</p>

  <p>Well, she had wanted him honest, and she got the truth. Nor did she relish
  it, judging from the look on her face.</p>

  <p>"Parowan! Of all the places in the world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's where we got the money to spend here," Bill stated stubbornly. "I've
  had some mighty happy times there, even if I did eat bacon and beans and hike
  a hundred miles after them sometimes. It made our stake for us&mdash;that
  same Parowan. Only for that mountain, you'd still be hazing your dad's cattle
  away from the <i>loco</i> patches, maybe, and helping your mother with the
  dishes. I don't wish you were&mdash;I'm tickled to death that you can wear
  diamonds and hire a nigger to comb your hair for you. But just the same,
  Doris, let's not get our heads so high in the air we can't see what Parowan
  ought to mean to us.</p>

  <p>"This baby's mine&mdash;and yours. We've got her, and we haven't got a
  roof for her to sleep under, except what we hire by the week. Only for
  Parowan, we couldn't have married at all; don't forget that. You wouldn't
  have married a poor prospector, and if you would, I wouldn't have let you. It
  was the gold I found on that mountain side that made it possible for me to
  ask you to marry me. And it was the gold that made you say yes."</p>

  <p>He swallowed as if there were some obstruction in his throat and went on,
  staring straight before him,&mdash;seeing that cut in the gulch's side,
  perhaps, and the slim girl in the stained khaki riding skirt and cotton shirt
  waist staring at the vein of yellow-flecked rock.</p>

  <p>"You can't think of any place where you want to give our child a home.
  Well, I can! She's going to have one, whether it's ever lived in or not. It's
  going to be at Parowan, on the spot where her daddy lived when he found the
  gold that made her possible. I wouldn't do it for you, against your wish. You
  like this froth, and I want you to have what you like best. But <i>Mary's
  going to have a home</i>."</p>

  <p>He did not raise his voice; indeed he almost whispered the words. Yet they
  struck Doris like a lash. Never before had Bill opposed her wishes, or
  declared that he would do a thing which Doris had not first decided to
  do.</p>

  <p>"You can't take her away from me," she said breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"I don't intend to take her away from you." Bill's tone was flat,
  emotionless, because he dared not slip the leash from his emotions. "Some
  day, when she's old enough to know what she's missing, the kid may want to
  come&mdash;home. There's going to be one for her. It's her right."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Doris coldly, "why not build it in civilization, at
  least, where she can use it?"</p>

  <p>"I'm hoping," said Bill, very quietly, "that when my girl grows up she'll
  have some sense."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; SO BILL GOES BACK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">PAROWAN sprawled over the slope of the mountain without much
  regularity in her streets and with no dignity whatever. Bill had read
  faithfully each copy of the <i>Parowan Record</i> as soon as he received it,
  and he had calmly believed that he was keeping in close touch with the town.
  For instance, he had studied the picture of the new, two-story concrete
  schoolhouse with its graded yard and young shade trees and the cement walks
  and all. He had told Doris proudly that the building would reflect credit on
  any California town,&mdash;which was true, so far as the picture went.</p>

  <p>Just at first he did not recognize the schoolhouse as he came up the
  street from the pagoda-roofed, cement depot with its arches that purported to
  be Moorish or Mission, no one seemed to know which. The depot had looked
  cunning in the picture, Doris had thought, and Bill had enthusiastically
  agreed with her. It did not look so cunning in reality; merely pretentious in
  a cheap way that irritated him. When he failed to recognize the schoolhouse,
  a cracker-box edifice of ugly cement blocks surrounded by raw, unpainted
  shacks, Bill was shocked. He had mistaken it for the jail until he observed
  the absence of bars at the windows, and the trampled ground in front.</p>

  <p>He strode up the board walk&mdash;hastily laid, of cheap lumber and
  already showing wide cracks and broken sections where knot holes had weakened
  the wood and much trampling had done the rest. The Parowan Security and Trust
  Savings Bank stared at him from the next corner. This building he recognized
  the moment he saw it, and with reason. Parowan Consolidated occupied the
  entire front of the second story, and the building was printed in miniature
  upon the Company's letterheads, with the sign showing distinctly across the
  upper windows.</p>

  <p>Across from the bank, the O'Hara House floated a green pennant with the
  O'Hara in white upon it; which was the sign of the O'Hara House in cities all
  through the West. Bill and Doris had tried one in Portland, and had found it
  almost good enough for Doris, although "two-rooms-and-bath" were the best
  accommodations the place afforded, with the bath connecting, which was
  terrible. But the cuisine was above criticism. O'Hara food always was perfect
  and immaculately served. Nevertheless, Bill curled his lips at the sign and
  went into a grocery store and bought a can of tomatoes, a pound of coffee, a
  little flour and butter and onions and potatoes and such other supplies as he
  happened to see or remember, and called a loafing Mexican to carry the stuff
  to his old camp, Bill walking ahead with his suitcase to show the way.</p>

  <p>Tommy, it appeared, had been faithful to his trust. The camp was enclosed
  by a highboard fence, and there were signs which said, "KEEP OUT!! THIS MEANS
  YOU!!" Bill grinned happily and had the Mexican set the things down by the
  gate and go back whence he had come, an extra dollar in his overalls pocket
  and a wide smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Tommy had sent the extra padlock key to Bill, perhaps in proof of his good
  faith. Bill opened the gate and was set upon with deadly intent by Hezekiah,
  who evidently failed to remember him until Bill spoke his name. Then his joy
  became hysterical and brought a lump into Bill's throat.</p>

  <p>His tent stood just as he had left it, with the forge under the juniper
  tree and the dugout cellar in the bank. His bunk was neatly spread with his
  blankets, though dust lay on the calico-covered pillow. His dishes were
  placed in orderly rows upon the box shelves, a pile of dry wood lay behind
  the cook stove. And from the ridgepole, suspended by a bit of rope tied
  through the handle, hung a black leather case,&mdash;the silver
  saxophone.</p>

  <p>Bill laughed a little when he glanced up and saw the symbol of one secret
  hope, but there was no mirth in the laughter. He was thinking what a fool he
  had been to dream of playing "Love's Old, Sweet Song" with Doris. Doris never
  sang nowadays. She would not sing the old songs Bill loved, because they were
  so absolutely back-woodsy and she did not seem to care about learning the new
  ones. Besides, she explained, her voice had never been cultivated; an
  omission for which Bill thanked God in his heart, after hearing other women
  strain their vocal chords with technical skill and little melody. Doris did
  not even know about the saxophone. It seemed unlikely now that she ever would
  know.</p>

  <p>Bill started a fire, laid his coat across the pillow, removed his cuffs
  and his collar and began to peel the potatoes. He missed Luella, but he knew
  that she was down in Tommy's Place, in the back room where her speech would
  not be too corrupted, and he did not want to meet any one until he had eaten
  and smoked and planned exactly what he would do. Until he was actually on the
  ground he could not choose a site for the home he meant to build,&mdash;a
  home worthy his little Mary.</p>

  <p>Doris had not seemed to mind his coming, and she had made no open
  objection to his errand. She had adopted a neutral attitude, a slightly
  tolerant manner toward Bill and his plan. If he wanted to build a house for
  the baby, years before the baby would be able to appreciate the gift, that
  was his own affair. She supposed he realized that the house would be all out
  of date long before Mary was big enough to live in it,&mdash;and did he
  actually mean to furnish the thing?</p>

  <p>"It's going to be ready to step into and hang up your hat and the baby's
  bonnet, before I leave it," Bill had assured her steadfastly. "Whether you
  ever see the inside of it or not makes no difference. That will be up to you,
  honey. But I'm going to do my part. I'll make the home."</p>

  <p>Well, he was here for that purpose. He had the plans in his suitcase, and
  the builders had ordered the material and shipped two carloads. He was to
  choose the site and wire whether Parowan could furnish cement workers
  competent to lay the foundation. He had left only one thing undone: he had
  not told any one in Parowan that he was coming. Wherefore, he was surprised
  to hear the gate open and shut, and to see Tommy presently thrust his
  spectacled face belligerently into the tent opening.</p>

  <p>"An' it's yerself, is ut, Mr. Dale?" Tommy stood within the tent, goggling
  at Bill, his leathery face relaxing into a wide grin. "I was toold uh somewan
  makin' hisself free wit' this place, an' I left Dugan in charrge of the
  s'loon an' come along over t' have it out wit' the boorglar. I did that!"</p>

  <p>For the first time in months, the old, sunny twinkle was back in Bill's
  eyes. He would not have believed that he would ever be so glad to see
  Tommy.</p>

  <p>"You go back and get Luella, darn yuh," he commanded, trying to be harsh
  about it. "And don't let on I'm back, will you, Tommy? I want to surprise the
  boys. If you haven't eaten, we'll have a real feed. Good old onions and spuds
  fried in bacon grease!"</p>

  <p>"I've been stoppin' at the O'Hara House, Mr. Dale," said Tommy stiffly.
  "They set a foine table&mdash;they do, that! Pie an' ice cream bot' at the
  same meal, Mr. Dale, an' no extry charrge fer that same. I been settin' the
  buttons forrard on my vest since I been boardin' wit' O'Hara, an' it's the
  trut' I'm tellin' yuh now." He took a step toward the doorway and stopped,
  loath to go.</p>

  <p>"An' if it's the gin'ral manager uh Parowan yuh mean t' supprise, Mr.
  Dale, yuh'll do that same or I mistake. I ast 'im yisterday was yuh ever
  comin' back t' take holt, an' he says you was too busy makin' the money fly.
  An' I says to him, I says, 'It's to Parowan he sh'd come fer that,' I says,
  'fer I never in all my born days seen the like.'"</p>

  <p>Bill rescued the coffee from boiling over.</p>

  <p>"Thought I was going broke or something, did he?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno as to that, Mr. Dale. But he says you bin makin' it fly, an'
  c'llectin' yoor share fast as it comes in, he says. I take it he meant you
  been cuttin' a wide swathe, Mr. Dale&mdash;which nobody's got a better right,
  that I know. The best has been none too good, he says to me, an' named over
  the hotels yuh been boarding at. An' phwat business it was uh hisn I dunno,
  fer it's yer own money yuh been spendin'. An' I toold him that same, I
  did."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to spend some more too," Bill declared, and smiled queerly to
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Yuh'll never spend more than yuh've got, Mr. Dale&mdash;well I know
  that," drawled Tommy. "My last dime'd back that statement. It would that. An'
  it'd be well if I could put my good money on some others&mdash;which I would
  not." With that somewhat cryptic observation, Tommy withdrew to bring the
  parrot.</p>

  <p>Bill sat himself down to what he considered the most satisfying meal he
  had eaten in many a day. He was not a primitive soul, fit only to enjoy the
  cruder things of life; but there was something within him that rebelled
  against smiles and handshakes where no good will begot them, and at the
  servility of hotel servants hoping for tips, and the insipid, painted faces
  of women who bared their shoulders and whispered malicious gossip behind
  jeweled hands. He could remember some wonderful evenings filled with music or
  the genius of great actors picturing life before him on the stage; and he
  could also remember evenings when he had been too bored and resentful to see
  the humor that lay beneath the surface of the peacock parade. And more than
  anything else, Doris had made mealtime an occasion for studied display that
  should seem unconscious. He had come to dread dinner especially.</p>

  <p>Wherefore he enjoyed his onions and potatoes, his stewed tomatoes and
  fried corn all the more because he knew how certain eyebrows would lift in
  astonishment could their owners look in upon the wealthy William Gordon Dale,
  and see how he was enjoying his plebeian fare.</p>

  <p>"Doris would like a taste of this grub," he told himself gayly as he
  filled his plate the second time. "She's hypnotized now with the novelty of
  it&mdash;dazzled with the glamor. But it's no natural life for anybody that
  has lived the real thing; seen life stripped down to reality. It's all
  pretense&mdash;and Doris is more than half pretending, herself. Pretending
  she likes that sort of thing&mdash;when she's probably half homesick, right
  now, for the desert, and won't admit it.</p>

  <p>"Wait till she sees the house I'll build for her! No great barn of a place
  that she couldn't use, out here&mdash;but a jewel of a home. Everything she
  likes that will fit in here. <i>I</i> know! I've watched her eyes when we
  struck some new place. Big, rock fireplace&mdash;Parowan rock; beamed
  ceilings, broad stairway, hardwood floors&mdash;great, long stretches of
  space with arches&mdash;and a big window framing the desert like a picture.
  What she calls a vista. I know&mdash;you bet I know! She thinks I'm going to
  build some darned box of a place, perhaps of cement. I let her think so.
  It'll be all rock, and glass, and hardwoods that will last a century and
  longer.</p>

  <p>"I'll find a hillside where the town won't be right under her nose, and
  I'll frame a vista for her with every window in the house! She can have house
  parties, if she wants to&mdash;lots of those city folks would be crazy to
  come and spend a week or two over here. In fact, they've thrown out hints
  about it, some of them&mdash;only Doris wouldn't take it that way.</p>

  <p>"Things'll grow, here," he went on, thinking and planning more hopefully
  than he had done for months. "I'll have grounds laid out, and things planted
  that will make our home a garden spot. It may cost something,
  but&mdash;&mdash;" He grinned then, and offered Hez a bacon rind and held his
  chops for a minute so that he could gaze deep into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Hez, you old devil, I believe you're kind of glad I came home," he said,
  and lingered wistfully on the last word. "You can be bodyguard for little
  Mary, when she gets to toddling around. I'll have to put a fence around the
  place to keep her in, I expect. You'd take care of the snakes and scorpions
  and such, wouldn't you, old boy? Never saw a bug get away from you yet."</p>

  <p>Tommy came, with Luella riding solemnly on his shoulder. Bill rose to
  greet her, having been schooled in his deportment toward ladies. Luella
  craned her neck and eyed him suspiciously while he coaxed her, then
  remembered and stepped gravely upon his inviting forefinger.</p>

  <p>"I'll be damned," she observed, looking at him with her head tilted. "Look
  who's here! When did you get in?"</p>

  <p>"You can't tell me this bird ain't human," Bill exclaimed much impressed
  by the remark.</p>

  <p>"She's heard that talk in the s'loon," Tommy discounted her intelligence.
  "If she don't speak worse things I'll be contint. Your turkle's gone, Mr.
  Dale. I'm thinkin' she's wandered away, an' I've a reward out fer
  her&mdash;if it's a her, which I dunno&mdash;an' I'm hopin' she'll be
  returned to yuh. It's a week ago she disappeared&mdash;she did that."</p>

  <p>"Holed up for the winter, maybe. They do, you know."</p>

  <p>"That's a hell of a note!" cried Luella sharply.</p>

  <p>"Well, I must be gittin' back, Mr. Dale. An' when it pleases yuh, maybe
  yuh'll step into my place an' have a bit of a drink on the house. An' I'll be
  proud to see yuh enter the door&mdash;I will that."</p>

  <p>"First place I hit, Tommy, will be yours. And mind you, I want to surprise
  the boys."</p>

  <p>"It's the town itself'll be glad to see yer face, Mr. Dale," Tommy
  muttered and went off, wagging his head.</p>

  <p>Bill was trying to persuade Luella to kiss him, and did not hear.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; BILL GIVES THE PUBLIC MIND A LIFT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BILL brushed past the sleek-haired office girl who attempted
  to bar his way and turned the knob on the door marked PRIVATE. He did not
  know which man he would find within; he was slightly relieved to find Walter
  Rayfield sitting behind a great, mahogany desk, staring at him in blank
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Walter." Bill crossed the room, his hand outstretched in greeting,
  the old, humorous grin on his face that had lost much of its tan.</p>

  <p>"Well, well! The prodigal come home for the fatted calf?" Rayfield pulled
  himself together and rose, his lips pursed. "Veal's bringing a good price,
  Bill. Have to make it a small calf."</p>

  <p>Bill did not know what he meant by that; nothing, probably, unless he was
  aiming at a witty remark. A year had made a difference in Walter B. Rayfield.
  He was fatter, and there were heavy pouches under his eyes. The milky one was
  almost hidden under a drooping lid, which gave him a facetious appearance of
  winking slily at whomever he chanced to be looking. His face had lines graven
  deep by the responsibilities of the past months. Altogether, Walter Rayfield
  looked older and less paternal, Bill thought.</p>

  <p>"How are things going?" Bill sat down in the chair pulled close to the
  desk and reached for his tobacco and papers. "According to the <i>Record</i>,
  things are still humming at Parowan."</p>

  <p>Rayfield glanced down at a pile of correspondence on the desk. Then,
  knowing that Bill would probably stay until he had smoked one cigarette at
  least, he pushed the tray back resignedly and leaned forward, his fingers
  lightly clasped and tapping one another rhythmically.</p>

  <p>"Things are humming," Rayfield confirmed guardedly. "I suppose you read of
  our shutdown to replace certain machinery?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. That was last summer, sometime. Got it in, yet?"</p>

  <p>Rayfield shook his head. "Those things take time," he said. "Stock has
  fallen off a few points in consequence&mdash;naturally. And how is Mrs. Dale
  and daughter?"</p>

  <p>"Just fine. Doris sent regards."</p>

  <p>"Which I return fourfold." Rayfield smiled gallantly. "When are you going
  back? Of course, I take it you did not bring them with you."</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't bring them. They're camped at the Palace for the winter. I'm
  going to stick here for awhile." Bill glanced out of the window and down into
  the squalid street, and wondered how Doris would like that particular vista.
  He did not see the peculiar stiffening of the muscles along Rayfield's
  jaw.</p>

  <p>"Going to stay? That's great news, Bill. Come back to try and speed things
  up, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Bill looked at him. Did Walter resent his coming, as betraying a lack of
  confidence in the present management? His tone had sounded mildly
  aggrieved.</p>

  <p>"No need of that, is there? Things seem to be going all right, far as I've
  heard. No, Walter, I came back to take charge&mdash;of building us a home
  here. I'd like to see a plan of the town and look over any available ground
  left in the residence district. I'll want a full block, at least; high
  ground, where there's a view of the desert and the hills. I expect it will
  take a few months to build it, but I'm going to rush it right through. And
  say, by the way! Can you tell me whether there's anybody in town that's able
  to lay the foundation? I've got all the plans and specifications&mdash;copies
  of them&mdash;with me. I'm going to have the builders come on from San
  Francisco, but they're just finishing up a contract now, and I can save time
  by having the foundation ready when they're free to come. Think I'd better
  take bids on it, or just give the contract to the best man? A few dollars,
  one way or the other, won't make any difference. I want a good job; one
  that'll stand forever."</p>

  <p>Rayfield's mouth had opened slightly in the beginning, and had closed in
  his genial smile. The paternal look was back in his face.</p>

  <p>"My, my! That will be great news to the town, it surely will! I've had
  some little trouble, Bill, convincing people that you hadn't just made your
  clean-up and quit the town cold. When it's known that you are back and
  building a home, that will silence all criticism." Rayfield nodded and
  drummed his fingers animatedly.</p>

  <p>"Criticism&mdash;of me?" Bill's face clouded. "I thought you kept writing
  I wasn't needed."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly true. Unless you feel that John and I have shown that we are
  incompetent, you are not needed at all. But you know people will
  talk&mdash;and with you gone so long and showing no interest, it began to
  look to some of the leading business men as if you had&mdash;well,
  unloaded."</p>

  <p>What Bill would have replied to that was not known. They were interrupted
  by the entrance of John Emmett, who had evidently been in a hurry, but forgot
  his haste to stare at Bill.</p>

  <p>"Time I came home," said Bill, getting up to shake hands. "Everybody looks
  as if I were a ghost that ought to get back under my marble monument and stay
  there."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Emmett protested. "Your back was to the light, and I
  couldn't make out who you were, at first. Well, how are you?"</p>

  <p>"News for the town, John," Rayfield interrupted briskly. "Bill's here to
  build a fine home for his family. I've promised to help him look up a
  building site, and get a contractor on the job to lay the foundation. Going
  to start right away&mdash;that right, Bill? I got the impression you were in
  something of a hurry to begin."</p>

  <p>Emmett looked from one to the other and laughed a little.</p>

  <p>"Thought you'd come to fire us because we're about to pass a dividend," he
  said. "I was just writing you to that effect."</p>

  <p>Rayfield pursed his lips. "Bill is not a child," he said reprovingly. "He
  knows dividends aren't paid out of extension costs. Once we're running full
  blast again, we'll be paying double what we have in the past, and Parowan
  Consolidated will soar again. We've done well to pay last quarter's
  dividends&mdash;with the mill shut down and the men out on strike."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know we'd had a strike," Bill said inquiringly.</p>

  <p>Rayfield threw back his head and laughed silently.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was sort of hushed up in the paper, naturally. The men did walk
  out&mdash;and we seized the opportunity to make the necessary changes and
  repairs in the plant. John and I were rather glad, on the whole. Saved us
  laying men off, which would have looked bad. Company wasn't out a dollar on
  the strike, and to keep the stockholders easy in their minds, we paid last
  quarter's dividends out of our sinking fund. Now, because the alterations are
  taking longer than we expected, we have thought it best to pass this dividend
  and explain just why. Your appearance, with the intention of building a home
  in Parowan, should counteract any ill effect on the public mind." He stopped
  and looked at Bill inquiringly as a thought seemed to strike him
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;er&mdash;you have sufficient funds, I take it, to carry out
  your plans," he ventured. "Because, in the event that you haven't, I should
  strongly advise you to postpone your building until the mine is producing
  again. These repairs and changes run into money, my boy, and the Company will
  not be able to advance anything, I'm afraid, for another three or four
  months. I was on the point of writing you to trim sails a bit&mdash;until we
  are turning the wheels again."</p>

  <p>Bill chewed his lip thoughtfully, turning his eyes again to the
  window.</p>

  <p>"I'm safe on the building, I reckon," he said, after a pause which was not
  too comfortable for the others. "I saved that out." He turned toward them
  smilingly. "She's going to be a dandy, too," he said. "Parowan will sit up
  and take notice when my shack is finished. Not so very big, you
  know&mdash;but a gem all the way through. I've calculated to put about
  seventy-five thousand dollars into the building itself. She'll stand me a
  round hundred thousand when she's ready to walk into.</p>

  <p>His partners looked at each other. Rayfield sucked in his breath
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"My, my! And I was afraid you were short of money!" he chuckled, when he
  had recovered his breath. "Bill, you're a wonder. Way you've been
  living&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"About all the money I've spent," said Bill grimly, "is on hotel
  bills&mdash;and a few trinkets for Doris. Her income that you have been
  sending her she spent on clothes and truck. Didn't give me a chance. She
  liked to spend her own money, she said. So&mdash;I can build the house, all
  right. I've got money enough."</p>

  <p>"And what about your wife?" Rayfield spoke unguardedly. "She won't be
  getting any more from this office, for awhile." He waved a deprecating hand.
  "Pardon my apparent presumption, Bill. I merely want to make sure that you
  can ride along for the next ninety days or so without any money from us."</p>

  <p>"Why, sure! That's all right, Walter. I don't gamble or drink, you see.
  And I didn't play the races&mdash;which is gambling, too. So I didn't get
  away with all you sent me. I can make out all right for awhile."</p>

  <p>He rose and picked his hat off the desk.</p>

  <p>"I'll be going, I reckon. You've got work to do&mdash;hope your salaries
  will go on?" he looked at them.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;oh, yes. It's only the dividends that must be omitted this
  quarter," Rayfield hastened to assure him.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all fine, then. I'm afraid you'll have to go on earning your
  money. I've got this house to build, and I want to see that it's built the
  right way. I'm going to stand guard over them. Just now, I'm going downstairs
  and have an account opened for me. I've got the house money with me, and if
  it's in the bank, Parowan will know I'm not four-flushing about the home. If
  the public mind needs a tonic, that ought to help."</p>

  <p>Rayfield stood up and leaned with his knuckles on the desk.</p>

  <p>"It will help amazingly," he said solemnly. "It will serve to instil new
  life in the commercial veins of this town. I tell you frankly, Bill, I did
  not like to pass this dividend just now, when the town has passed the first
  fever of enthusiasm and should be stimulated to go on with full confidence in
  the future. The fact that you have sufficient confidence to invest in a fine
  house here will have a tremendous effect on the morale of the town."</p>

  <p>"All right," Bill grinned. "I'll go slide a pinchbar under the public mind
  and give it a lift. And say! Who's the best man to talk foundation to?"</p>

  <p>"Fellow name of McGaran," Emmett told him promptly. "You'll find his sign
  down the street in the next block. He did our cement work, and he's a good
  man."</p>

  <p>Bill went out and down the stairs, humming a little tune just above his
  breath. Presently, the president of the Parowan Security, Trust and Savings
  Bank was giving his hands a dry wash and smiling and bowing at almost
  everything Bill said. Teller, cashier and assistant cashier were bustling out
  of sight with slips of paper in their hands, looking extremely important
  until the ground-glass partition hid them from the front, and whispering
  then, heads close together, with the bookkeeper, trying his best to edge in a
  question or two.</p>

  <p>"Bill Dale&mdash;he's here&mdash;just deposited sixty-thousand dollars,
  cashier's check from the Hibernian, in 'Frisco!" The teller took hurried pity
  on the bookkeeper. "He's with the boss now. Come out in a minute and consult
  me about a check, and take a look at him. Boy, he looks like a regular
  fellow!"</p>

  <p>The bookkeeper almost missed him, at that. Bill was having his busy day.
  Before the bank employees quit buzzing, Bill was conferring with McGaran
  about cement and making time the essence of the contract, as lawyers say.</p>

  <p>From McGaran's office Bill went to a place said to be the Town-site
  Office,&mdash;just behind the bank, it was. And in fifteen minutes he was
  riding a hard-driven automobile over slopes which had furnished scant grazing
  for his burros not so long ago. For himself he would have built the house
  beside his tent, but for Doris that wouldn't do at all. The working class had
  crowded into that part of town, because it was close to the mine. Wherefore,
  Bill examined vacant plots far removed from the grime and the noise of
  money-getting.</p>

  <p>Before noon he had acquired personal title to a knoll not too far from the
  business section, nor so close that any part of the magnificent sweep of
  desert and distant mountains could ever be hidden from the windows and wide
  porches of his Mary's home. Laying aside his sentiment for his old camp
  ground, and trying to see all this with the eyes of Doris and, later, of his
  little Mary, Bill looked long and said to himself that he had done well.</p>

  <p>By then, all Parowan knew that Bill Dale had returned and meant to start
  immediately upon the building of a mansion. A new light shone in the eyes of
  certain men who had been looking anxiously for some sign in the heavens to
  tell them whether the prosperity of Parowan would break or hold.</p>

  <p>For this there was a reason. Other prospects had been exploited far beyond
  their deserts. Their little bubbles had glowed iridescent for a time, and
  were going the way of all bubbles. Parowan Consolidated was the only real
  mine behind the town, the one big industry that could hold prosperity upon
  the mountain side. Other small camps had appeared in near-by canyons, desert
  mushrooms more or less poisonous to the unwary.</p>

  <p>At first it had been believed that the gold Bill Dale had found would be
  uncovered elsewhere in the district. The promoters of Parowan had carefully
  fostered that belief, and even yet the men on the outside were unaware of the
  fact that certain other opulently named companies were riding precariously up
  the tail of Bill Dale's kite. They advertised their properties as being
  "adjoining the Parowan Consolidated properties," and sold stock on the
  strength of that statement rather than because of any particular value in
  their own claims. And the <i>Parowan Record</i> was doing all that any
  boom-town newspaper could do to discourage discouragement and foster faith in
  the district.</p>

  <p>There was meaning in Rayfield's declaration that the passing of a dividend
  by Parowan Consolidated was unfortunate at that particular time, and that the
  coming of Bill was likely to prove a godsend to the town.</p>

  <p>The business men watched Bill covertly for a time, still anxious. Then,
  when material for the big house began to arrive, and expert builders from the
  city; when trucks and men were busy on the knoll, certain of the watchers
  breathed freer and relinquished certain secret plans they had been making to
  leave Parowan as quietly as possible while they could pull out with a
  profit.</p>

  <p>Bill himself was enough to put heart into the most timorous. He was so
  happy to be back and to be building his home that his voice lifted the
  spirits and set men to smiling at nothing in particular. The twinkle was back
  in his eyes; his laugh was a tonic. With Hez slouching along at his heels and
  Luella riding his shoulder, he walked the streets and had a word for every
  man who met his eye with friendly glance; bossed the job of the building.
  When he made brief visits to Doris and the baby, Parowan was uneasy until he
  returned.</p>

  <p>The passing of the dividend created scarcely a ripple of comment, since
  Bill Dale was there, spending money on a home, and since Bill said that
  Parowan Consolidated was merely getting ready to shovel out the gold in
  chunks.</p>

  <p>"Can't pay dividends, boys, when we're spending money on new machinery,"
  he said easily, believing it all in the bottom of his heart.</p>

  <p>Those who had begun to sell a little of their Parowan stock wished they
  had kept it. And those who could, bought more. Four times par they paid for
  it, and called it a good investment. Bill told them that it was beyond
  question a deep, rich, permanent mine, and that as long as he had anything to
  do with it, Parowan was not going to turn a dishonest dollar.</p>

  <p>That winter the town continued to grow and to prosper. And on the
  fourteenth day of February Parowan Consolidated asked for extra guards for
  the express car, and made a valentine shipment of gold. Almost immediately,
  stockholders were notified that the regular dividend would be made.</p>

  <p>So Parowan had passed its critical period of uncertainty and was accepted
  as a permanent town that might even rival Goldfield and Tonopah in wealth,
  give it a little time.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; THE YARN AL FREEMAN TOLD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AL FREEMAN, slouched forward on a box, dangled a cold
  cigarette from his loose lips and gave Bill the slinking, slant-eyed regard
  of a trapped coyote. Behind him, Tommy stood grim, with his underjaw lifted
  and thrust forward in a comical attempt to look as deadly as he felt. Thrust
  within the waistband of his sagging gray trousers was an ivory-handled
  revolver which had lately done its share toward intimidating the man before
  him. Bill held his underlip between his teeth, lest he smile and so spoil a
  dramatic situation evidently quite precious to the little Irishman, whom
  Nature had never meant for a swashbuckling hero.</p>

  <p>"Spake up, now!" Thus Tommy cracked the whip of authority over Al. "Tell
  t' Mr. Dale phwat I heard yuh tellin' t' Jack Bole in my s'loon&mdash;an'
  tell it the same er I'll let the daylight t'rough yuh! I will, that." He
  rolled the words out with unction, with an eye canted up through his glasses
  to observe the effect of his harshness upon Bill. A small boy patting a tame
  bear could never have felt himself more dare-devilishly courageous.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a foine tale I heard him tellin', Mr. Dale, an' one that concerns
  you an' yoors. I'll have it outa him, never fear."</p>

  <p>"Shall I heat the poker Tommy?" Bill's tone was innocent, if his eyes were
  not. "Or have you put the fear of the Lord in him already?"</p>

  <p>"Aw, he ain't able t' scare a rabbit," Al protested with an ingratiating
  smile that managed to make itself mighty unpleasant, in spite of him. "What I
  tolt Jack Bole I'm willin' t' tell you, Mr. Dale&mdash;only I wisht to say
  that I never meant yuh no harm, an' fur as I kin see I ain't done yuh no harm
  neither. You made yer pile, an' I was only tryin' t' make a livin' best way I
  could. An' seein' yo're rich an' I'm broke, I cain't see as I done ye no
  harm. Which I wouldn't of wanted t' do yuh nohow."</p>

  <p>"Clear as the Colorado River in flood time," Bill made cheerful comment.
  "Let's have the story, and never mind the footnotes. Go ahead. I'll keep
  Tommy off your back&mdash;if I can. He's a hard man to stop, once he gets
  started, but I'll protect you if possible."</p>

  <p>Whereat Tommy scowled and clamped his jaws together anew, not perceiving
  the joke. And his captive, actuated by motives of his own, proceeded to tell
  his story, which startled Bill more than he would like to own.</p>

  <p>Since Al's illiterate speech is not particularly attractive and his manner
  of telling the tale wearisome with a frequent sez-e and sez-I, here is the
  gist of the matter which Tommy had thought fit for Bill's ears and best
  attention:</p>

  <p>In coming to Parowan as packer for the government research men, Al had
  come with instructions to do exactly what he had done. He declared that the
  sole object of Rayfield and Emmett had been to discover what value there was
  in Bill's claims. They had been first attracted by the parrot, talking
  unguardedly in Goldfield&mdash;Al here repeated almost verbatim what the
  parrot had said, since Jim Lambert had jotted down the sentences and had seen
  fit to study them seriously&mdash;and had laid their plans carefully before
  ever they left the town.</p>

  <p>Al said that he was taken up to Jim Lambert's office, and there he first
  heard of the scheme, agreed to play his part in it and was promised an
  interest in all that was gained. The three had followed Bill, keeping well
  out of sight. They had done this because they did not know just where he was
  going,&mdash;Parowan being a large mountain with wide shoulders and many
  gulches and canyons. They had timed their arrival so as to take advantage of
  the storm and share Bill's shelter, whatever it was. This, Al said, was
  intended to induce intimacy and the exchange of confidences.</p>

  <p>They were to secure samples, and what details they could, whereupon Al was
  to carry off the camp equipment and leave Rayfield and Emmett stranded there,
  so that Bill must take them in. This, he said, was to induce further intimacy
  and to make it more permanent.</p>

  <p>There Al's duty ended. After he had reported to Jim Lambert, he was to
  have the burro and the outfit, and could go where he pleased, so long as he
  kept his mouth shut and remained away from Goldfield. He was to be paid top
  packer's wages and a share in whatever was made out of Bill's claims.</p>

  <p>"Then what are you breaking your word with them for?" was Bill's first
  surprising question. "Why aren't you keeping your mouth shut?"</p>

  <p>"Wal, they hain't played square with me, Mr. Dale. They hain't give me the
  share they agreed to." Al lifted his dingy hat to scratch a head that looked
  as if it needed scratching.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you got a written agreement?"</p>

  <p>"No, I hain't. They wouldn't have any writin' on it. They said it wouldn't
  be best."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's good sense. It wouldn't." Bill got up and put more wood in
  the stove, for a raw wind was blowing up from the desert. "Well, what do you
  expect me to do about it?" He turned on Al so abruptly that Al dodged,
  expecting a blow perhaps.</p>

  <p>"Wal, I dunno&mdash;onless it might mebby be worth somethin' to yuh, t'
  know about the frame-up." Cupidity flared for a moment in Al's eyes. "Yo're a
  rich man, Mr. Dale," he whined. "I ain't got a dime to my name."</p>

  <p>Bill replaced the lid on the stove, scraped pieces of bark from the
  surface with the poker and sat down again, eyeing Al contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm a rich man&mdash;according to your standard. Did you ever hear
  of crooks making a man rich, Al? Doesn't that strike you as kind of
  funny&mdash;a crook doing that?"</p>

  <p>"Wal, I dunno's it does, Mr. Dale&mdash;not if they was gittin' five
  dollars, say, whilst you was gittin' one."</p>

  <p>Bill laughed contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"If they were all that generous, they'd be pretty apt to pay you enough to
  keep your mouth shut, anyway. Or give some one a few dollars to bump you off.
  There are thin spots in your yarn, Al. I'm afraid it isn't worth much."</p>

  <p>"Wall, they paid me some," Al retorted with a craven kind of acrimony.
  "An' they don't b'lieve in killin'. They say that's crewd an' danger'us."</p>

  <p>"They'll pay you more," Bill snapped, "if they're afraid of your tongue.
  You're a cheap skate, Al&mdash;an awful cheap skate. If you'll take my
  advice, you'll get out of town&mdash;to-night. The world's full of places
  besides Parowan. Take him out, Tommy; and dump him somewhere outside the city
  limits. And if you want to bring any more like him into camp, give them a
  good scrubbing first. I'll have to clean house after him. Get!"</p>

  <p>This last command was to Al, who overturned the box in his haste to get
  off it. Tommy herded him out with the ivory-handled gun, looking a bit
  crestfallen and a good deal puzzled. Tommy's thought processes were too
  simple to follow Bill's logic, or to understand his attitude. It seemed to
  him that Bill was almost criminally indifferent to his own interests, and
  that his leniency with Al Freeman fell but little short of approval. It had
  been labor wasted, bringing Al there to tell Bill his story, and he regretted
  now that he had not been content to kick Al out of the saloon and let it go
  at that.</p>

  <p>But after he was gone, Bill sat dejectedly beside the stove, his arms
  folded across his lifted knees, feet in the oven, and brooded over the
  amazing story. It seemed incredible that Al could be telling the
  truth,&mdash;and yet, there were some things that Al could not possibly have
  imagined. If there were thin spots in his story, there were also details that
  carried conviction.</p>

  <p>Luella, having retired under the bunk during the interview, came stalking
  out and climbed, beak and claws, up Bill's back and perched upon his
  shoulder, leaning forward and making kissing sounds against his cheek, which
  was her way of coaxing his attention. Bill reached up a hand and stroked her
  back absently.</p>

  <p>"Speak up now," Luella admonished, having liked the sound of that phrase.
  "That's a hell of a note, ain't it?"</p>

  <p>Bill pulled her down and held her on her back between his hands, rolling
  her gently from side to side.</p>

  <p>"It is," he answered gravely. "You've stated the case exactly." He set the
  parrot on his knee, where she immediately began to preen her ruffled
  feathers.</p>

  <p>That was the convincing part of Al's story,&mdash;repeating the things
  Luella had said before the courthouse. Al claimed to have been there, and to
  have heard her talk. He had chanced to pass by the steps just as Jim Lambert,
  Rayfield and Emmett were coming up to the courthouse from town. He claimed to
  have been in the offices of Jim Lambert later, when the plot was hatched. If
  that were a lie, how could Al repeat what the parrot must have said? How
  could he know that the burros, and the parrot with them, had waited before
  the courthouse steps alone or otherwise? Al had named the very day and the
  very hour of Bill's visit to the recorder's office. The date and hour were
  written upon his location filing, together with book and page of the record.
  Had Bill chanced to forget, that record would serve to remind him; but Bill
  did not forget. Al had never seen those papers. He could not possibly have
  told about Luella unless he had both seen and heard her there.</p>

  <p>The incredible feature of the yarn was the fact that Rayfield and
  Emmett&mdash;John and Walter, he had come to call them in his mind&mdash;had
  been the chief instigators of the plot. And there again Bill floundered in
  vain speculation. What <i>was</i> the plot? Not the mere creation of jobs for
  themselves, surely? Al had professed ignorance of their governmental
  position. They may have been research men, as they claimed. He didn't know,
  and he had never heard that talked about, except as a plausible reason for
  their showing up at Bill's claims. He was sure that they had lied about
  working out from Las Vegas west, however; having been in Goldfield, they
  could not have been prospecting Forty Mile Canyon at that particular
  time.</p>

  <p>What had they gained? A block of stock for each of them, to be sure. Bill
  had been generous; had given them each fifty thousand shares of the promotion
  stock. He could scarcely credit any plot to get it, however. Still, that
  meant fifty thousand dollars immediately after the company was organized.
  Bill had known of many a murder committed for a fraction of that amount.</p>

  <p>One discrepancy in the story eluded him for some time, though he groped
  for it vaguely. Then Al's retort came to him with force&mdash;"Not if they
  was gittin' five dollars where you was gittin' one"&mdash;and set him
  scowling, vacant-eyed, at the tent wall.</p>

  <p><i>Were</i> they getting five dollars to his one? How? They had full
  control, to be sure. But their control seemed to be of the conservative,
  constructive kind that favored dividends. And there was the thing that seemed
  incredible. Would crooks, of the bold type that would follow a prospector and
  lay cunning plans to grab what he had found, play a straight game afterwards?
  It did not seem to Bill that it could be possible. A crook is a crook. Once
  in control, they could have raided and wrecked the company a dozen times in
  his absence. Instead, they had worried over one passed dividend.</p>

  <p>Bill lay that night staring up at the whitish blur of his tent roof with a
  cloudy moon above it, and thought circles around the thing. Walter and John
  <i>couldn't</i> be the thieves Al Freeman had called them. A thief cannot
  keep his fingers off other men's money. Walter and John had made money for
  many a man. But that painfully exact report of seeing and hearing Luella in
  Goldfield was true. It had to be true. That was something which no man could
  build convincingly out of his imagination; not to Bill, where Luella was
  concerned. She had a certain fixed idea in her talk, always. She seemed able
  to discriminate between subjects, and to stick to one for minutes at a time
  before drifting into other sentences that conveyed an entirely different
  impression of what might be going on back of those observant, yellow eyes. To
  one who did not know Luella, it would be impossible to simulate her uncanny
  imitation of intelligence,&mdash;which Bill more than half believed to be
  genuine reasoning power. Perhaps the bird was especially quick to read faces
  and to connect certain expressions on the countenance with certain groups of
  words. It could not be accident, in Bill's opinion. Accidents do not happen
  with consistent regularity, and Luella's remarks were usually pithy and to
  the point. It was therefore a fixed basis of reasoning, in Bill's mind, to
  grant the authenticity of Al Freeman's contention that Luella was at the
  bottom of the plot.</p>

  <p>Beyond that point, however, Bill continued to flounder in doubts. He hated
  himself for even speculating upon the dishonesty of Walter and John, although
  he had found them a bit touchy, a shade jealous of their authority and their
  judgment. Walter had assumed executive control; John, as treasurer, had the
  responsibility of keeping the accounts impeccable. Bill had attended the
  annual stockholders' meeting, on the last afternoon of the year, and he had
  been almost awed by the meticulousness of John Emmett's financial report. It
  had sounded like some carefully compiled government statistics, and Bill had
  been compelled to sit and listen to a careful reading.</p>

  <p>The reëlection of the Board of Directors had been a mere form. Bill,
  Walter and John were the directors,&mdash;Nevada demanding only three. They
  were as inevitably reëlected to the same offices. There had not been many
  stockholders present, the day being almost a holiday. Those who were present
  voted perfunctorily and with complete unanimity; indeed, so harmonious had
  been the meeting that every one may as well have stayed at home, save the
  secretary, Bill thought.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in their pardonable desire to be left alone to run the
  machinery, since they had started it in the first place, Bill saw the full
  approval of the resident stockholders. And if the stockholders whose very
  business life depended upon the success of Parowan Consolidated and the
  integrity of her officers were satisfied, surely there was no reason why the
  president should meddle. The business men of Parowan would be the first to
  know if anything went wrong, Bill told himself over and over.</p>

  <p>Yet the story Al Freeman had told would not erase itself from his mind,
  nor could he call it a venomous bit of spite and so discount it. There had
  been bothersome details which a lawyer would call corroborative evidence.
  There was the ineffectual campsetting, the night of their arrival; rather,
  the late afternoon. Tommy had declared then that Al Freeman had been
  bluffing, that he had not tried to get their tent up and pegged down securely
  before the storm broke. Al confirmed Tommy's assertion. The plan, he
  declared, had been to manage to pass the night with Bill. They had decided
  that when they first glimpsed his tent.</p>

  <p>Then the invasion of the tent while Doris was there alone he had
  explained. Emmett had seen the sample sack half full of ore, but had not
  dared to investigate the contents at the time. He had ordered Al to go back
  and see what was in that sack. It it were the rich ore they suspected, he was
  to abstract what he could, load the burros and hurry back to Goldfield,
  leaving Rayfield and Emmett nothing but their blankets. He said they knew
  that Bill had plenty of grub.</p>

  <p>These details fitted in with what had occurred within Bill's knowledge. If
  Al were lying, he was assuredly making a fine, artistic job of it all. The
  inconceivable part was the personality of the two men he accused, and the
  part they had played and were still playing in Parowan Consolidated and in
  the town. They had promoted their campaign cleverly and efficiently, mostly
  by the power of suggestion.</p>

  <p>"If it's true," said Bill harassedly at breakfast next morning, "they're
  the tamest bandits I ever saw in my life. I can't believe it."</p>

  <p>"Seems like a dream," Luella assented promptly, pausing in her nibbling of
  coffee-soaked crust. "Ain't that a hell of a note! I can't believe it." Then,
  blinking rapidly as memory revived another speech, she added softly, "Kiss
  me, Doris. Say you love me."</p>

  <p>Bill's face paled. He looked at the bird, swept out an impulsive arm and
  pushed her off the table, soaked crust and all. He bit his lip, fighting the
  spasm of loneliness, or heartsick longing for the life he had dreamed of
  living with Doris.</p>

  <p>Of a sudden his head went down upon a curved arm, his shoulders twitching
  a bit as he still fought. Luella, crawling up to forgive and be forgiven,
  made her clicking, kissing sounds in vain against his cheek.</p>

  <p>"Hell of a note!" she complained at last, when Bill gave no sign of
  response. "I can't believe it. Seems like a dream. You don't say!" Then,
  spying the butter unguarded, she stepped down upon the table and pigeon-toed
  in that direction. "Help yourself," she invited gravely. "Plenty more where
  that came from. Help yourself."</p>

  <p>And Bill, his soul flayed with bitter memories, with dreams slowly
  strangled and returning wraithlike to mock his loneliness, did not even
  hear.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; "THERE'LL BE MORE TO COME OF IT"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WALTER RAYFIELD reached out his hand with deliberate
  firmness and laid his forefinger upon the push button on his desk. In the
  distance could be heard a faint buzzing. Almost immediately thereafter, John
  Emmett opened a door and walked in, a yellow invoice in his hand and a look
  of inquiry on his face.</p>

  <p>Rayfield waved a plump hand toward a chair.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, John, and listen to the story that Bill has brought us this
  morning. The most outrageous thing I ever heard in my life. Go on,
  Bill&mdash;but go back to the beginning, if you don't mind. I want John to
  hear what you have just told me."</p>

  <p>Impassively Bill obeyed. When he had finished&mdash;and he spared no
  details in the recital&mdash;he sat back and folded his arms, waiting to see
  how they would take it; watching, too, for some sign that should guide his
  judgment of the matter. He was still ashamed to doubt them, still ready to
  believe that Al, having overheard the parrot, and suspecting the significance
  of her remarks, had yet concocted the rest of the story from some dark
  purpose of his own; revenge, perhaps, but more likely in the hope of
  profiting by the tale. But Bill had not spoken of his own belief in the two.
  He had told them what Al said, making no comment of any kind, keeping his
  voice and his face carefully neutral.</p>

  <p>Rayfield and Emmett looked at each other. Emmett smiled slightly, shrugged
  his shoulders and glanced down at the yellow invoice.</p>

  <p>"Interesting bit of libel," he said contemptuously. "If there was any
  truth in it, I wouldn't be getting a hump in my shoulders and ruining my eyes
  over the Company books. Did you O K the order for these engine parts, Walter?
  This invoice is not correct. The total is wrong, and moreover the name of
  purchaser is not here. I wish you'd call up the shop and ask about it. Tell
  them I can't accept it as it stands. Make it plain that they must furnish a
  correct invoice, or take back the merchandise." He dropped the invoice before
  Rayfield. "And once more let me say that I absolutely refuse to accept
  anything that is not signed by the purchaser. Who did this buying? The
  engineer at the plant?"</p>

  <p>"Now, now, never mind the invoice for a minute, John! I want to ask Bill
  just one question. It may not be beneath your dignity, either, to join me in
  wanting to know why Bill did not bring this Al Freeman to us with that story.
  That hurts me, Bill. I can't understand why you heard him out and did not
  give us the chance to face him with it. I&mdash;I dislike to think that you
  gave the story any credence; but since&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Emmett turned and came back to the desk. His hard brown eyes fixed
  themselves upon Bill's face.</p>

  <p>"If Bill took enough stock in the yarn to listen to it, there's just one
  thing for me to do. I'm responsible for the Company's funds. I think I shall
  demand that you bring an auditor to examine the books."</p>

  <p>"An auditor has gone over the books, hasn't he? You showed his certificate
  at the annual meeting. And Al didn't say you had juggled the accounts,
  John."</p>

  <p>"No, he could hardly say that," Rayfield put in. "At this late
  day&mdash;hoping, I suppose, that we could not prosecute him for stealing our
  outfit&mdash;he claims that we arranged for him to steal it so that we could
  board with Bill!" He threw back his head suddenly and laughed, his sides and
  rounded front shaking with mirth.</p>

  <p>"A fine tribute to your cooking, Bill! You should have given him a dollar
  or two for that!"</p>

  <p>"I thought you two ought to know what he's saying," Bill replied soberly.
  He had no heart for joking, that morning. "He was telling it in Tommy's
  Place, and Tommy overheard him and made him come to me and repeat what he had
  said to others. I thought it was no more than right to let you know."</p>

  <p>"We appreciate your spirit, Bill, but I can't seem to understand his
  object. Did he give you any valid reason for concocting such a yarn?"</p>

  <p>"He said that you hadn't played fair with him. He said you had paid him
  some money, but not what you had promised." Bill sighed,&mdash;a purely
  physical incident caused by his general depression and the ache in his heart
  for Doris. This conspiracy tale did not seem important, now that he had told
  it to Walter and John. The sunny, well-regulated offices, the sight of John
  and Walter on the job, busy with Parowan affairs, reassured and shamed
  him&mdash;though he reflected that he had not really doubted them, even in
  his midnight musings when a man's faith burns weakest.</p>

  <p>"I told him you'd have paid enough to keep his mouth shut," he added. "And
  I wouldn't make enough of the yarn to bring him to you. I told Tommy to take
  him out and dump him outside the city limits."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said John in a tone of displeasure, "I don't see just what
  you can expect us to do about it; or why you came to us with it during office
  hours. Walter may have all the time in the world to gossip&mdash;but I happen
  to have work to do. When you decide what you're going to do about it, let me
  know and I'll stand any investigation you may want to start. But I can't
  stand here discussing a crazy yarn like that unless it's of some importance
  to the Company."</p>

  <p>Bill rose and picked up his hat.</p>

  <p>"I came and told you the yarn so you'll know what to do if Al Freeman
  shows up again in Parowan. I won't be here for a week or two, maybe. I'm
  taking the noon train. You can get me at the Palace Hotel in Frisco, any time
  it's necessary."</p>

  <p>"Going to bring the Missus back with you?" Rayfield pursed his lips
  good-humoredly. "Hope you mean to give a house-warming when you move into
  that mansion. I'd like to have some of these Parowan folks see what you've
  got there. Well, so-long, old man. And after all, I guess we're both grateful
  to you for warning us about Al Freeman. I'll put the Chief of Police on his
  trail. If he shows up we'll land him in the penitentiary for that robbery of
  our camp outfit. A man like that's dangerous, left running at large and
  slandering his betters."</p>

  <p>Bill agreed with him and went down the stairs wondering just how much of a
  fool he had made of himself. But that thought was presently swallowed up in
  his anticipation of seeing Doris and little Baby Mary within twenty-four
  hours. He had not intended to leave so soon. He had meant to write Doris that
  the house was finished and furnished, and to invite her, in a purely joking
  way, to invite her to come and inspect his job. But up in the office he had
  suddenly sickened of the town, and of Walter and John. He had a fierce desire
  to look into one pair of eyes that he knew was loyal. Doris might not agree
  with him always, she might fall short of his ideal as a wife, but at least
  their interests were identical and she could never be guilty of treachery. He
  was not so sure of the rest of the world.</p>

  <p>He hurried to camp and got Luella, taking her to Tommy's Place. He wanted
  Tommy to sleep up in the new house for safety's sake, and he wanted to know
  what had become of Al.</p>

  <p>He found Tommy in a rather difficult mood and did not stay to explain his
  reasons for turning Al out with so little thought of his importance. It
  seemed to Tommy that Bill was playing into the hands of crooks, and as
  plainly as he dared Tommy told Bill so.</p>

  <p>"Al's gone, Mr. Dale&mdash;but there'll be more to come of it," he said
  carpingly. "Kape wan eye open, is my advice to yuh. For I tell yuh plain that
  Al was not lyin', though yuh might think it. He c'uldn't look yuh in the eye,
  Mr. Dale&mdash;an' when he's tellin' one of his lies he has that way of
  lookin' at yuh, he puts the school books t' shame that says a liar cannot
  look a man in the eye. So I know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Train's whistling, Tommy. Keep your own eyes open and look after the new
  house." It disturbed Bill to have Tommy voice something which Bill himself
  would not concede to his consciousness. He did not believe Al's story,
  because he refused to doubt the integrity of his partners. He refused to
  doubt them, because to do so would pull down his faith in the stability of
  Parowan, which he had chosen for Mary's home. It was a round-about way to
  fight a doubt, but it was the best Bill could do at that time. For, as is
  well known, nothing ever thrives quite so luxuriantly as the seeds of
  suspicion.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">DORIS was glad to see Bill, though she was not enthusiastic
  over the invitation to Parowan. She had thought that they might take a trip
  east, now that the baby was old enough to travel, and had cut her first two
  teeth. Of course, Doris would like to see her mother and dad, but
  Parowan&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Well, you've got a hundred-thousand-dollar house to step into, honey, if
  you want to go." Bill looked at her wistfully. "I've heard several women
  wishing they could visit a real mining camp, and I thought maybe you'd like
  to take a party over for a week or two, and give a sort of house-warming.
  Mrs. Baker Cole helped me choose the furnishings, and she thought the plan of
  the house was perfect. You won't be ashamed to have your friends see it. And
  there are some nice folks in Parowan now."</p>

  <p>Doris considered the matter. If Sophy Cole had helped Bill, of course,
  that was different. The nice folks in Parowan, of course, did not appeal to
  her in the slightest degree; but the house-party idea was not a bad one. And
  she did want to see the old home again, she discovered.</p>

  <p>"We'd have to take servants from here, Bill&mdash;and you know I
  positively couldn't think of staying longer than a couple of weeks or so. And
  I'd have to see the place first, before I could ask any one over. You're a
  dear, and all that, but a man simply <i>can't</i> know about the little
  things that count when one is giving a party. And besides, I'd have to
  arrange for amusements for the guests. There is so little that one can do in
  the desert for entertainment."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to have you go with me alone," Bill confessed. "I'd like to have
  you all to myself for a little while in the new home. Has it ever struck you,
  Doris, that we have lived before the public ever since we were married?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see how you can call this public," Doris retorted, glancing
  around the room. "And until you went back to Nevada on this wild scheme of
  yours, I'm sure we were together all the time&mdash;and by ourselves too, an
  awful lot."</p>

  <p>Bill extended an arm and tapped lightly against the wall. "Six or eight
  inches between us and our neighbors. I call that living in public. Well,
  shall we go over there together, just us two and the baby?"</p>

  <p>"I'll see," said Doris lightly. "Perhaps&mdash;with servants, of course.
  I'm rather curious to see what kind of a house you and Sophy Cole would
  build, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Next week, then, let's go." Bill drew her toward him and kissed her. "It
  would be to-morrow, but I've got something to look after, first. Honey, don't
  think me a fool just because I love you so; and don't laugh at me for wanting
  to see my wife and my baby under our own roof. I can't help it. I'm
  human."</p>

  <p>"You're extravagant," Doris corrected, patting him on the shoulder with a
  slight condescension which Bill did not miss. "Think of spending all that
  money on a house in the desert! I never heard of such a thing. I'll bet folks
  over there are calling it Dale's Folly, this minute."</p>

  <p>Bill's eyebrows drew together. He looked down at her somberly.</p>

  <p>"They're sure mistaken, then," he said grimly. "<i>That's</i> not Dale's
  folly."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean me, I hope?" A sparkle came into her eyes.</p>

  <p>But Bill took his hat and left the room without even remembering that he
  should ask to be excused, or make some courteous explanation of his sudden
  departure.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">XX. &mdash; LUELLA ENTERTAINS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BILL stood on the south veranda and looked down upon the
  town, where smoke was rising lazily from bent stovepipe and brick
  chimney&mdash;the supper fires of Parowan's inhabitants&mdash;and away across
  the desert beyond, where the Funeral Mountains stood shoulder deep in purple
  shadows, the peaks smiling yet in rosetinted afterglow.</p>

  <p>"Home!" he said between his teeth. "I made a mistake. I've only built a
  house. I'm a damned fool. It takes two to make a home."</p>

  <p>Behind him came faint murmurs of talk, high-keyed laughter, little
  silences shattered suddenly by the refined babel of several women exclaiming
  in unison. The clink of china punctuating the pauses. Then, frank,
  uncompromising, came the voice of Luella, speaking with awful
  distinctness.</p>

  <p>"What the hell! Damned bunch of gossips. Won't you ever settle down?
  Doris, for God sake listen."</p>

  <p>A pause, then voices exclaiming once more. Slippered feet came tack-tack
  across polished floors, muffled on the rugs, clicking when the rug was
  passed. A ripple, rustle, quite close. Then silence. Without turning his head
  Bill knew that Doris was standing in the open doorway, looking at him in hot
  anger. Unconsciously he braced himself, his face setting into forced
  serenity.</p>

  <p>It came.</p>

  <p>"Bill, I wish to heaven you'd come and get that parrot! She's in there,
  walking up and down, looking at the floor and saying the most awful things!
  You'll have to explain it somehow to my guests&mdash;her calling them a bunch
  of damned gossips. It's beyond human endurance. She's talking something
  <i>awful</i>. I'll call a servant to take her out and wring her neck, if you
  don't come and get her. I mean that, Bill."</p>

  <p>Bill clicked his teeth together and faced her, smiling. But in the pockets
  of his Palm Beach coat his hands were clenched, so that trimmed nails dug
  into flesh.</p>

  <p>"Your guests wanted to see Luella and hear her talk," he reminded her with
  gentle raillery. "You told them how she would go up to baby Mary and smooth
  down the baby's dress with her beak, and make kissing sounds, and say, "She
  looks like you, Bill. Damned if she don't." I heard you telling them. She's
  heard Don say that, every time he comes here. Your <i>guests</i> begged to
  have her brought in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and what did she <i>do</i>?" Doris was almost in tears; but ladies
  with carefully powdered cheeks cannot afford tears, so Doris pressed a
  twenty-five-dollar handkerchief to her lips and controlled herself. "I'll
  tell you what she did! I brought the baby and held her down for the parrot to
  talk to. And what did she <i>say</i>? 'What the hell! You damned huzzy, git
  outa here!' <i>That's</i> what she said, to <i>your own baby</i>! Now those
  women will go home and say that's the way you talk to your family."</p>

  <p>Bill's chuckle did not soothe her appreciably. She stood looking at him as
  if she wanted to box his ears. Bill in cream colored Palm Beach coat and
  trousers, soft silk shirt, white canvas shoes, was the handsomest man in
  Parowan,&mdash;or in all Esmeralda County, for that matter. The women guests
  of Doris recognized that fact, if Doris herself overlooked it. Wherefore,
  when he yielded the point and returned to the midst of the assembly, he saw
  eyes that brightened as he looked into them, lips that smiled, a subdued
  little flutter at his coming.</p>

  <p>In the wide arch that Bill had designed to give Doris the long "vista"
  which she so admired in other houses, Luella was pigeon-toeing back and
  forth, her tail spread slightly, her eyes swift-flashing bits of amber. She
  was peeved at something, in Bill's opinion. She paused and tilted her head at
  him.</p>

  <p>"Look who's here! Well, I'll be damned!"</p>

  <p>Ladies laughed titteringly behind their fingers, and looked at one
  another. Bill, feeling himself an elephant at a doll's tea-party, stooped and
  let Luella step upon his hand.</p>

  <p>"Hell of a note! I just can't <i>stand</i> this place! Not a soul worth
  knowing. Ignorant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bill mercifully squelched her with his hand pressing down her head hard.
  He bit his lip, trying hard not to laugh right out in meeting, and turned to
  make a dignified retreat of it, when a pair of human-looking eyes in the
  crowd met his, and one lid drooped a bit.</p>

  <p>Bill stopped short, took the second look to make sure, and turned toward
  the wives and daughters of Parowan's leading citizens. He grinned,&mdash;the
  old, Bill Dale smile in the face of discouragement, the smile and the twinkle
  that had gone far to win him his nickname of Hopeful Bill.</p>

  <p>"Aw, shucks! You've all raised children that were brought out to act
  pretty before company, I guess." His voice wheedled them. "They generally
  wound up with a spanking after the company was gone, didn't they? Well, we're
  in that fix right now. Luella's been and gone and done it, just like any
  other kid. That's what I get for leaving her with a&mdash;gentleman that
  keeps a saloon, while we were in California for about a year.
  And&mdash;you've caught me with the goods, I guess. I do cuss, now and then.
  Every time the baby tries to say something else, I'm apt to holler, 'Doris,
  for so-and-so listen!' Luella's got it down pat." He looked around at them
  with his Hopeful Bill smile. "I hope I shut her off before she told that on
  me," he said.</p>

  <p>They laughed, much relieved, glad of his example so that they dared be
  human for a minute. Doris, with her perfect social manner, had kept them
  stiff-backed and guarding their tongues. One old lady who had been the wife
  of a governor and could afford to be herself on that account, waved half a
  wafer at Bill imperiously.</p>

  <p>"Don't take her away, whatever you do," she cried. "That would be a
  confession of guilt. I wouldn't have a parrot that couldn't swear&mdash;or a
  monkey that wouldn't steal the guests' earrings. Put her down and let her
  cuss. It's about the only chance we'll ever get to hear how men talk when
  we're not around."</p>

  <p>Bill hesitated, until he caught the eye of Doris, over by the door. Then
  he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My wife's trying to reform me before the baby's old enough to repeat
  things," he said. "Luella's influence is considered bad enough as it is. It
  would never do to encourage her. The custom is to shut her in a dark closet
  whenever she speaks in an unrefined manner. We hope to purify her speech
  before little Mary is old enough to copy it."</p>

  <p>He gave them all an endearing smile and carried Luella off. The
  awkwardness of the situation was considerably relieved, and Doris did her
  careful best to efface the memory of those last interrupted remarks of
  Luella's. She hoped that no one had noticed how the parrot's voice had
  changed, imitating her own tones. Luella never learned that in the saloon, at
  least; there was enough to set the ladies of Parowan thinking.</p>

  <p>The ladies of Parowan did think&mdash;and they talked, as well. They had
  felt all along, they said, that Bill Dale's wife held herself above the rest
  of the town; though why she should was beyond their powers of imagination.
  Everybody knew she was Don Hunter's girl,&mdash;respectable enough, but
  nobody in particular, and certainly not rich. Don had made some money out of
  Parowan, but they still ate in the kitchen, and Mrs. Hunter didn't even keep
  a hired girl. And here was Doris, trailing silken gowns over the polished
  floors, the Persian rugs of the mansion on the hill, and speaking loftily of
  this servant and that servant&mdash;by their last names&mdash;and bewailing
  the hardships of living in Parowan and trying to entertain with no caterer in
  town and cut flowers a practical impossibility on short notice or if the
  trains happened to be late.</p>

  <p>The ladies of Parowan descended to the satisfying luxury of speaking their
  minds. Some of the minds harbored spite and malice and envy, at that, and the
  things they said were not pleasant. It was fortunate that the series of "at
  homes" which Doris had condescended to give to the ladies in Parowan ended
  with what Bill unfeelingly dubbed "Luella's party."</p>

  <p>Five afternoons had been devoted to that memorable series. Twenty-five
  women to an afternoon, and the house decorated differently each day, and the
  prizes for the card games real, costly trifles such as Mrs. Baker Cole and
  her set always gave. Parowan society would have been content with a china
  plate or a doily for first prize, even at the bridge table,&mdash;which was
  new to Parowan. Plain whist and five hundred were the games usually played by
  the ladies of Parowan, and Doris had overawed them, intimidated them even,
  with her "bridge tables" ever since her arrival.</p>

  <p>Her house-party from Santa Barbara and San Francisco, arriving in a
  private car, twittering through the "camp" for a week and departing as they
  had come, had impressed even the ex-governor's wife. There had been a grand,
  house-warming ball, and the very elect of Parowan had been permitted to
  attend it; but the house-party of wealthy strangers had held themselves a bit
  aloof, and one woman had been overheard to express her surprise and
  disappointment because the natives had neglected to appear in red shirts and
  high boots, with six-shooters dangling at their hips. Parowan hadn't quite
  forgiven that, even yet.</p>

  <p>But Doris had responded to the involuntary deference which Parowan showed
  to the wife of Bill Dale. She had glowed secretly with pride in the house
  Bill had built on the hillside. It was a beautiful house; even her critical
  eye could find no flaw in its design, in its perfect appointments. Bill had
  been building a dream into the house. Love had gone into it, and a wistful
  longing for a home that should dumbly express his love for Doris and for his
  child. Hope had gone into the building of that house; the hope that Doris
  would love it and would want to call it home.</p>

  <p>He had visioned her standing at the great window that was set like the
  frame of a picture into the west end of the long drawing-room. The scene it
  framed each day was the sunset,&mdash;glorious sunsets such as only the
  desert may know. A great window of flawless plate glass, framing the far
  peaks that flamed each night anew.</p>

  <p>In the eastern wall the mate to that window was set cunningly so that it
  should frame a glory which Bill called dawn. Doris had never seen that
  picture, though Bill seldom missed it. But he had dreamed of her standing
  before the west window, looking upon the sunset. He had dreamed of other
  pictures of Doris in that house. Once or twice his heart had beat faster,
  believing that his dream was coming true. For Doris had been stimulated by
  the praise of her guests of the house-party. She had read in their faces a
  delight in this house set upon the edge of the wilderness. A few had asked if
  they might come back. So Doris was lingering in Parowan and playing great
  lady to the town,&mdash;and dramatizing herself to herself, with her
  California acquaintances for an imaginary audience. She had seen that they
  expected her to love the desert. Wherefore, she was professing to love the
  desert and the town, and to dread tearing herself away at the first frost.
  She meant to have her friends over again, she declared. She had thought of a
  perfectly original bit of fun for them. She would dress them all in miners'
  clothes and lead them right down into the mine, and let each one dig some
  gold for a souvenir. She wrote of this to Mrs. Baker Cole, who told her it
  was a wonderful idea.</p>

  <p>And now, here were the Parowan women gossiping about that wretched parrot.
  Doris did not need to hear what they were saying, in order to be sure that
  they were talking. She felt a difference in their attitude; thinly veiled
  resentment&mdash;and some sentiments which were not veiled at all. She would
  have left Parowan then, spurning it contemptuously as an impossible place to
  live in, but for one thing.</p>

  <p>Doris Hunter, born in the desert, knew desert ways and desert people.
  Though she would not admit it, she knew what would have been her own
  attitude, three or four years ago, toward a woman of wealth who lived in a
  mansion and patronized her friends. She knew that she would have resented the
  woman intensely, would have hated everything the woman said or did. And if
  the woman bungled her patronage and then left the place, Doris would have
  curled her lip and would have said that the woman left because she discovered
  that even in the desert people had their own ideas and refused to run after
  snobs.</p>

  <p>Knowing all that, Doris stayed, holding her head up proudly, as was her
  privilege. She had her house-party, and could be seen merrymaking on the
  broad porches, with colored lights and music and dancing, on cool nights
  after the days had been hot. Parowan was not invited to those frolics, but
  must view the colored lights and listen to the music from a distance.</p>

  <p>She returned with the party to Los Angeles and the beaches there, and was
  gone for a month or more. But she returned, quite unexpectedly to Bill and to
  the town, and made some pretense at being glad to be at home.</p>

  <p>And all the while gossip was flowing, a turgid underground stream fed by
  some unknown source. All the while it was taking to itself a bitter flavor
  which had not been there when it had been merely a thin trickle of feminine
  resentment. Men were talking,&mdash;in confidential undertones at first,
  later with an uneasy hope that certain rumors would be proven false; rumors
  that held an ugly meaning for the town.</p>

  <p>And Bill, keeping pretty much to himself when Doris was not at home, and
  devoting himself to her whims and her service when she was with him, leaving
  suddenly for short trips and returning more imperturbable than he had been
  before, never heard the gossip, or dreamed of what would happen when the
  whisperings grew into shouts.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">XXI. &mdash; BILL AND THE TAME BANDITS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BILL stood on the top step of the front porch, looking down
  into the scowling faces of a committee of workmen from the mine. Seamed, not
  too clean some of them, hard-eyed every one, they stood looking up at him,
  measuring as they were being measured. He had seen them coming up the hill,
  had thought some accident had happened, had come to meet them. There he
  stopped short, on guard. He had seen miners' committees before now. They
  needed no banner to announce their kind and purpose.</p>

  <p>"Come in, boys," he said, when the silence became marked. "You seem to
  have something on your chests."</p>

  <p>He turned to the door, and they followed him, saying nothing. That in
  itself was of unfriendly portent. Many of these men he knew by sight, a few
  had speaking acquaintance with him. He had returned the evening before from
  the Coast, and he felt a swift desire for a full record of the day since he
  had left Parowan. Something must have happened, some grievance of which he
  was wholly in ignorance must have arisen in his absence.</p>

  <p>Bill saw how they stared around at the beautiful room, and looked at one
  another afterwards with a grim significance. He stiffened mentally.</p>

  <p>"All right, now, let's have it&mdash;since you are here. But the office is
  the proper place for business, you know. Why didn't you go there?"</p>

  <p>"It's you we want to see this morning, Mr. Dale," a small, shrewd-faced
  man said quietly. "Mr. Rayfield and Mr. Emmett have done all they can for us.
  We'll have to talk straight from the shoulder, now, so we came to the man
  who's responsible."</p>

  <p>"All right." Bill sat down and crossed one leg over the other,&mdash;a
  habit of which Doris did not approve. "Responsible for what?"</p>

  <p>"For getting away with the money, so our wages haven't been paid this
  month. And so the company can't go ahead and find the ore again. The boss has
  done his best. He's proved that. When the Company failed to meet the payroll,
  Mr. Rayfield and Mr. Emmett lent a lot of the boys money out of their own
  pockets to tide things over. And we had just stood a cut in
  wages&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you'll excuse me just a minute," said Bill in his best city manner,
  "I'll call the office."</p>

  <p>They seemed to suspect some trick, even in that. But the small man did
  nothing to prevent Bill from leaving the room, so no one else did anything.
  But Bill had only reached the door when he swung back.</p>

  <p>"We'll go down to the office together," he said quietly. "You fellows
  aren't here just to pass the time away, I take it. And I just got back last
  night. I don't know what's happened while I was away, so we'll just go down
  where I can find out the truth of the matter."</p>

  <p>They were a taciturn lot. They said nothing whatever to that, but rose and
  followed him out, skidding a little on the polished floor. Bill was thankful
  for their silence. He wanted to think, and he needed to think swiftly.</p>

  <p>For two months, a new rule at the mine had shut him out almost entirely
  from the works. Rayfield had explained that it was because some one had
  tampered with the safety of the men,&mdash;had in fact set fire to a section
  of timbering. The effect was that no man was permitted on the works without a
  special, written permit from the general manager.</p>

  <p>Bill had run into that restriction unawares. The superintendent had been
  sorry, but firm. Rayfield, he said, would not excuse any violation of the
  rule. Bill must go to him for a permit. Bill had gone and had received the
  permit, which was good only for one visit. Rayfield could not risk the
  misuses of a pass, he said. He had too much on his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Bill had taken the permit and had torn it in two before Walter's eyes.
  "And who writes the permit for <i>you</i>?" he had asked contemptuously and
  had stalked out. Rayfield had attempted to make light of the affront, but he
  had not recalled the order.</p>

  <p>Bill would not run to him for permission when he wanted to go into his own
  mine, so he had kept away from the works, and as far as possible he had kept
  away from the office as well. Who was he to butt in? he had asked himself
  resentfully. <i>He</i> was only the president of the Company. And, having
  matters of his own to occupy his mind and his time, he had not concerned
  himself further with the management of the mine.</p>

  <p>Two or three men whom he met on the street looked at them strangely, but
  the group continued to the office without being questioned by
  any,&mdash;though Bill fancied that he could read anxiety in more than one
  pair of eyes that met him on the street. The silence of the mine machinery
  was noticeable and depressing. Bill was bracing himself for the worst.</p>

  <p>The worst met him in the office of Parowan Consolidated, and it met him
  with a soothing pat on the shoulder&mdash;which did not soothe&mdash;and a
  deprecatory shake of Walter Rayfield's head. Emmett was in the room, also,
  standing by the window with his hands in his pockets as if he were out of a
  job. Which he was, as a matter of fact.</p>

  <p>"I was going to send for you, Bill," said Walter. "I wasn't sure you came
  home last night, however."</p>

  <p>Bill passed the civilities by as of no moment.</p>

  <p>"What's all this about the mine being on the rocks?" He did not mince
  matters. He was past that.</p>

  <p>Walter looked at him reproachfully with his good eye and pursed his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"You saw it coming," he said mildly. "I kept preaching retrenchment, you
  know, when our ore began to pinch out. Hopeful Bill wouldn't listen." He
  glanced swiftly at the committee of six. "So the result that I warned you of
  has come to pass. We have no ore, no money, and some debts. The boys haven't
  had their wages this payday, Bill." His tone was maddeningly reproachful. It
  implied that Bill was to blame for all this. Bill accepted the challenge.</p>

  <p>"How do you blame <i>me</i> for that?" Again he was clenching his hands in
  his pockets, holding his temper rigidly under control. He wanted to get to
  the bottom of this amazing state of affairs. He <i>had</i> to get to the
  bottom of it.</p>

  <p>"Wel-l&mdash;&mdash;" Walter fiddled with a pencil on the desk,
  "&mdash;&mdash;of course we know it costs money to build fine houses, and
  dividends must be paid promptly to meet the needs of&mdash;the occasion. But
  one can't go on paying dividends unless there is some income to warrant it. I
  admit that I erred in my judgment in one respect. I was in hopes that the ore
  would hold out longer than it did. We might have carried things along until
  the first of the year, at least. Then, John and I intended to resign and let
  you take the load on your own shoulders. We have done the best we could
  but&mdash;&mdash;" he shook his head regretfully "&mdash;&mdash;we couldn't
  keep the dollars rolling in quite fast enough. Not&mdash;quite."</p>

  <p>Bill stared at him stupidly. He looked at John Emmett, who had turned and
  was facing them, his hard eyes fixed on Bill.</p>

  <p>"I should like," said Bill, "to bring in an auditor to go over the books.
  How you've worked it I don't pretend to know&mdash;but I see you've done it.
  I don't suppose the books will show it either. I reckon you've been too cute
  for that&mdash;since you've been working out a plan from the start. But we'll
  go through the motions of getting at the bottom of this. And before we go any
  farther, I'll admit that I know almost exactly how much of a damned fool I've
  been. But you're slick, you two. It took me so long to figure you out that
  you got away with it before I was in a position to stop you. There's
  nothing," he sneered, "like the friendship game to skin a man with. It beats
  a knife in the dark, any time. John, let's see the cash balance&mdash;if
  there is any; or did you two dig out the corners?"</p>

  <p>Rayfield sighed and shrugged his shoulders. Emmett lifted his lip at Bill
  like a wolf and did not move.</p>

  <p>"No use trying to put up any bluff," he snarled. "You're the president of
  this Company&mdash;you sign all the checks, don't you? If you don't know
  where the Company stands, who would?"</p>

  <p>The small, shrewd-faced man interrupted, standing a bit forward from the
  group.</p>

  <p>"All this is interesting," he said, "but it don't get us fellows anywhere.
  We came to find out about the payroll. We've been stood off now for ten days.
  We want to know where we stand."</p>

  <p>Bill turned his head and studied the men briefly, the small man
  longest.</p>

  <p>"You stand in line, along with the rest of the bunch," he said, with a
  heartening grin. "Go back and tell the men to mosey down here to the office.
  They'll get their pay, all right."</p>

  <p>They looked at him, and from him their eyes went to the other two. The
  small man turned to the door.</p>

  <p>"They'll be here, Mr. Dale," he said. Bill never could decide afterwards
  just what lay behind the little man's words. They had sounded somewhat like a
  threat.</p>

  <p>"Get out the payroll, John," he said crisply. "And the nice, big check
  book I've kept signed up for you. The men will be here, and they'll have to
  be paid."</p>

  <p>"There's not enough money in the bank to pay them." Emmett's voice was
  surly.</p>

  <p>"Get the books, I said. The men are going to be paid."</p>

  <p>Perhaps Emmett thought it would not be worth while to oppose him. Perhaps
  he knew the temper the men would be in. He brought the books, slapping them
  down on Rayfield's desk ill-naturedly.</p>

  <p>"They've waited ten days," said Bill. "You begin figuring their time up to
  and including to-day."</p>

  <p>Rayfield ceased for a moment to drum his fingers. "They've been out for
  two days, Bill," he said. "Quit of their own accord."</p>

  <p>"Up to and including to-day," Bill repeated distinctly. He picked up the
  telephone and called the bank, asked for the Company's balance and got it.
  The modesty of that balance astonished him, even now.</p>

  <p>"Send up a messenger for a deposit," he said easily and put down the
  'phone. "Now, what's the payroll?"</p>

  <p>"Including our salaries, which have not been paid for the last three
  months&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bill reached out a long arm and got him by the front, pulling him close.
  "I'd love to smash every bone in your body, you tame bandit," he gritted.
  "But we won't add any rough stuff to this&mdash;yet. I want to find out,
  first, just how rough to make it."</p>

  <p>He let John go with a savage push that slammed him against the wall. "I
  want you two crooks to know just where I stand," he said between his teeth.
  "You've raided and wrecked my Company, deliberately, and as completely as you
  could. You've squeezed the lemon dry, and you've been peddling lies about me
  and mine, to cover up your dirty work. I don't need to be knocked down with a
  club, once my eyes are open. You've asked me to accept paper for my
  dividends, all summer, so there would be a decent cut for the rest. I did
  it,&mdash;and don't you reckon I can't <i>prove</i> it?</p>

  <p>"Now, you're going to come clean. It won't get you anything but whole
  bones, because I mean to send you to the pen for this, if I can prove it on
  you. I fight for my own. And now, how much will it take to cover the payroll?
  The messenger's outside."</p>

  <p>Emmett growled the amount, and Bill wrote a check, asked for the bank book
  and got it just as the messenger rapped on the door.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, sonny," he called, when the boy was leaving. "I want you
  to do an errand for me, if you will."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Dale." Boys must worship heroes, and Bill was the man this
  youngster had chosen for his own. One read it in his eyes, in his voice, in
  his glowing eagerness to serve.</p>

  <p>Bill scribbled a short note to Tommy, and held it out with a dollar. The
  boy shook his head at the money, took the note and bowed himself out with a
  quaint courtesy that would have amused Bill at any other time.</p>

  <p>"Now, you'll write the checks, John. And you'll say no word to the
  men&mdash;that goes for both. Stay right where you are, Walter."</p>

  <p>There was a heavy trampling on the stairs, and Bill threw open the door
  into the outer office.</p>

  <p>"You can go," he said to the girl, sitting wide-eyed behind her
  typewriting desk. "Or, rather, come in here. I may need you later on." He
  raised his voice. "Come on in, boys. A's come first into the private office,
  B's follow, and so on. And as you get your checks, please go right on out.
  Saves crowding."</p>

  <p>He needn't have worried about their going right out. The first A headed
  straight down to the bank, and the second A was presently at his heels. The
  workmen of Parowan Consolidated had listened to ugly rumors too long to take
  chances.</p>

  <p>A late comer squeezed past and into the private office, accompanied by
  inquiries as to how he spelled his name. Bill turned his head and nodded at
  Tommy.</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;you sit over there by the window," he said carelessly,
  and went on with his work of watching Emmett write the pay checks, taking
  each one damp from his fingers, calling out the name of the man to whom it
  belonged and placing a pen in his fingers for the signing of the payroll.</p>

  <p>Bill saw the flare of surprise in more than one man's eyes as he read the
  amount of his pay. Bill's hand would clamp down on the man's shoulder for an
  instant with a friendly pressure as he spun the fellow out of the way of the
  next. He spoke to none, but he had a nod and a smile for many. He looked into
  the faces of men whom he believed were guilty of treachery to the Company and
  to him, but he gave no sign of suspicion. There were others who could have
  told him much, but he asked no question. The routine of payday was observed
  without comment. The only change was the paying of the men in the office.</p>

  <p>So presently the last man had clumped down the stairs and into the bank,
  and only Tommy remained, sitting grimly in his corner, staring owlishly
  through his thick-lensed glasses. Bill shot him a sidelong glance, lifted an
  eyebrow and bent over the check book before Emmett. John had a wonderful head
  for figures. The balance on the last stub would not have bought a dinner at
  the O'Hara House.</p>

  <p>"Not much chance to graft off that," grinned Bill, and pointed at the
  figures. "Now, you spoke about debts. Dig 'em up, John."</p>

  <p>"What's that roughneck doing here?" Emmett growled, looking at Tommy
  insultingly. "We don't owe him anything."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you do," Bill retorted evenly. "You owe him about the only thing
  in the world you're able to pay. Implicit obedience." He paused to let those
  two words sink in. "I never thought I'd ever have to call in a gun-man to
  camp on your shadow. But he's here, and he's got too many notches on his gun
  to be scared about adding another one or two. Tommy, you'll go with Mr.
  Emmett into the other office, and stand over him while he digs up Bills
  Payable. He should find them in a book&mdash;not in the right-hand drawer of
  his desk! You're a gun-man. You know what I mean, I guess."</p>

  <p>"I do that, Mr. Dale," Tommy rumbled ominously. "He'll return wit' the
  Bills Payable, have no doubt of that."</p>

  <p>"Bill, this is an outrage!" Walter Rayfield reached for the telephone, but
  Bill snatched it away from his finger tips.</p>

  <p>"You're damned right, it's an outrage. But the remedy is going to be
  applied as fast as possible."</p>

  <p>"You're letting the lies that Al Freeman told poison your mind. John and I
  have worked hard for this Company. We've gone without our salaries for three
  months now, because the funds were getting low. And this is all the thanks we
  get. You come blustering in here at the last minute, trying to bully and play
  the bad man. You can't get away with it, Bill." Rayfield shook his head
  sorrowfully. "Bluffing won't lift the Company out of the hole it's in. You've
  paid off the men&mdash;but there are the stockholders to think of, and the
  debts. And the ore has petered out, Bill. One of those rich surface deposits
  with no depth to it." He pursed his lips, drumming on the table with his
  fingers. "Your fine friends from San Francisco dug out the last of it, Bill,
  for souvenirs. A fitting end to Parowan and the fortunes of Hopeful Bill
  Dale. A picturesque ending&mdash;but the end, nevertheless."</p>

  <p>Bill did not trouble to answer him. In a moment, Emmett returned with his
  arms full of books, the dangerous Tommy treading close on his heels.</p>

  <p>"Not knowin' which would be the right wan, I had him bring them all, Mr.
  Dale. An' his gun was not in the right-hand drawer. It was in his pocket.
  Here it is, Mr. Dale,&mdash;in case yuh've neglected to pack wan yourself.
  An' if yuh don't mind, Mr. Dale, I'd like fer to have yuh search him fer a
  knife. Them's the kind of crooks that packs 'em, Mr. Dale,&mdash;as it's been
  my experience to know. An' I'd search the other wan whilst I was about it,
  Mr. Dale. I would that."</p>

  <p>Tommy's suggestion was gravely complied with, in the presence and to the
  horror of the wide-eyed typist. Bill apologized to her with a smile, but he
  did not suggest that she leave the room. Messrs. Rayfield and Emmett were
  wily gentlemen. The girl might easily be in their confidence and their
  private pay. He did not know where they had gotten her, but he remembered
  that she had reigned supreme over the outer office ever since Parowan
  Consolidated had established itself there.</p>

  <p>"Now, John, write checks for all these bills. All of them, that is, that
  are authentic. Have this girl get them ready for the mail. If you'll come
  with me, young lady, I'll help you bring your typewriter in here for sake of
  convenience. Mr. Emmett and Mr. Rayfield are not moving about much,
  to-day."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">XXII. &mdash; BILL BUYS PAROWAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the streets groups of men stood and talked together,
  scanned eagerly the faces of pedestrians, asked questions that halted men in
  their stride, formed new groups as some fresh bit of news became known. And
  without exception, all up and down the town, men talked of Bill Dale and
  Parowan Consolidated.</p>

  <p>Before the bank a prominent group had gathered. Men went up and down the
  stairs to the office, coming out upon the street to run the gauntlet of human
  eyes, and sometimes saying, "I got mine, all right&mdash;maybe." A trip in to
  the teller's window, and a nod of assurance as they came out again.</p>

  <p>Glances went up and clung to the windows of the office where a queer
  gathering sat silent, or did what Bill Dale commanded. Emmett and Rayfield
  had turned surly. The typist was in tears, having broken unexpectedly into
  speech. Things she had seen, sentences which she had overheard, trifles most
  of them, she told to Bill. Nothing was sufficiently definite to serve as
  evidence of fraud, but she accomplished one thing at least: She convinced
  Bill that she was not in their plot, that she was innocent of all knowledge
  of the inner workings of the office.</p>

  <p>Bill had a lawyer there,&mdash;a man whom he trusted to a certain extent,
  though he was not really trusting any one save Tommy, just now. The lawyer
  took the girl's name and address, and told her that she might go for the time
  being. "Which left Bill freer in his mind. He had not wanted to seem harsh
  with the girl if he could possibly avoid it.</p>

  <p>Rayfield looked up at him and sneered when the door closed behind her.</p>

  <p>"Now you've done every melodramatic stunt you can think of, with a lawyer
  in one room and an auditor in the next, and a roughneck with a gun at our
  backs, just what do you really expect to accomplish? It's all well enough to
  dissolve the Corporation, as you say you intend to do; but you surely don't
  expect to keep us here until that is accomplished, do you?"</p>

  <p>"It won't take so long," said Bill. "The written consent of the
  stockholders, waiving a meeting, and so on&mdash;Fuller, here, has all the
  dope, and can give you the details&mdash;why, it won't take long, at
  all."</p>

  <p>"With stock scattered from Coast to Coast? You'll have a nice time, Bill,
  getting the signatures of the stockholders!" Then the necessity of fighting
  for his honor occurred to Rayfield. He blustered a good deal about the
  outrage, and about Bill's insanity and his ingratitude.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Bill retorted imperturbably. "And Parowan stock is not
  scattered as badly as you think, maybe. I hold most of it myself. Been
  picking it up all summer, fast as I could without sending the price up. And
  you've helped quite a lot, unloading what you held, and lying about me and
  the way I've been squandering the money. I didn't know all of it, until
  yesterday. I thought you meant to carry things along smooth on the surface
  till the last minute, and then duck. I was ready for that. But you took me by
  surprise, working it this way. However," he yawned, "I'm an adaptable
  cuss.</p>

  <p>"You don't know it, but there's a bunch of bulletins being put up, right
  now, saying that Bill Dale will buy Parowan Consolidated at two dollars a
  share. Some will make money at that, and some will lose. But it can't be
  helped; I can't trail down every buyer and find out just what he paid. And
  the losers won't lose so much as if you had played it through your way."</p>

  <p>"You damn fool," said Rayfield softly, "You'll spend your last dime for
  nothing. The ore's gone. I made sure of that. No depth&mdash;like so many of
  these rich strikes." His good eye dwelt speculatively upon the lawyer.
  "Everything has been done properly, Mr. Fuller. Bill's biting off more than a
  mouthful, and it's your duty to tell him that he is not obliged to buy in the
  stock. John knows to a dollar what his income has been. It was big, I admit
  that. He's had close to a million dollars out of the mine so far&mdash;and
  the town site. What he's managed to spend is not my business, of course. But
  if he hadn't spent a dollar, you can see where he will wind up if he tries to
  buy up Parowan stock. I wish he would," he sighed. "I hold some shares I
  should like to dispose of."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're going to get rid of them," said Bill. "Right now while I'm in
  the mood, if you've got any sense. But don't think I'll pay you any fancy
  price. Ten cents a share for all you've got will be about right."</p>

  <p>Rayfield studied him, gave up trying to read his mind, and accepted the
  price. With less grace, Emmett followed. They hadn't much, and the
  insignificance of their holdings, their acceptance of his offer which he had
  intended as an insult, was more enlightening to Bill than all their
  protestations had been.</p>

  <p>They believed the mine had been worked out. They had held up the faith of
  the public until they could unload their stock; it was quite possible that
  his agents had bought in theirs and paid them a good price for it. The market
  was broken now. A panic was growing in the town. People were leaving by the
  dozens. They could not have gone out of the office and sold Parowan stock for
  one tenth of what Bill had contemptuously offered them.</p>

  <p>A man came in, holding a long envelope in his hand. He moved deprecatingly
  toward Bill.</p>

  <p>"It says down on the street that you're paying two dollars for Parowan,"
  he said. "I paid six for mine, but if you'll take it at two dollars you can
  have it&mdash;and glad to get rid of it," he added in a mutter that Bill
  caught quite plainly.</p>

  <p>"Here's your money. Go back and tell the rest it's no dream," Bill said
  shortly, blotting the check with a vicious thump of his fist. "Ask them not
  to obstruct the traffic, if they can help it, and to please form in
  line."</p>

  <p>The man folded his check and hurried out, ashamed of his act, but
  manifestly relieved to have recovered a part of his investment. In five
  minutes there were five other men in the office.</p>

  <p>All that day, Bill bought Parowan. The broker down the street, having been
  enterprising enough to wire Goldfield, Tonopah, all the towns within reach,
  came and sold to Bill Parowan stock,&mdash;stock which he could not deliver
  until the mail came in.</p>

  <p>That night Doris met him in the door of the big house on the hill. Her
  face was white, her eyes clouded with troubled anger.</p>

  <p>"Bill, you haven't been buying Parowan stock!" she began, trembling all
  over. "They told me you've been buying like a madman, for two dollars a
  share. It must be a lie. You aren't <i>that</i> crazy!"</p>

  <p>Her emphasis hit Bill's pride. He grinned down at her, though his eyes
  were tired and a bit sunken in his head.</p>

  <p>"Yup, I'm <i>that</i> crazy," he said. "Sign this slip of paper, and I'll
  have bought yours, too. Only I'm paying top price for yours, old girl. You
  get five dollars."</p>

  <p>"Five hundred thousand dollars?" She looked at him strangely. "All right,
  Bill. Only, where's the money? I'd have to sell for cash, dear."</p>

  <p>"Cash in the bank, sure. I haven't that much on me, right now." Bill sat
  down at the nearest table, pushed away a costly vase with flowers from Los
  Angeles drooping toward him, and shook his fountain pen.</p>

  <p>His check fluttering faintly in her white fingers, he watched her scrawl
  her name under the agreement of sale. "Doris Mary Dale," she wrote, and he
  saw how her right hand shook, and that there was no breeze to flutter his
  check in her left hand. She stood up, breathing quickly.</p>

  <p>"There's that much you can't throw away on strangers," she said
  triumphantly. "And you can't possibly have much more. But what possessed you
  to buy stock you know is worthless? These people have made their money out of
  Parowan. Let them go! They'll get it back in the next boom. They're just
  rushing out of town as if we had the plague here," she continued. "The
  bottom's dropped out of everything, I heard. And you stayed in that office
  and paid two dollars a share for Parowan stock! Bill, what did you <i>do</i>
  it for?"</p>

  <p>"Well, because I wanted Parowan stock, I guess," Bill evaded her
  flippantly. "And these poor devils needed to sell, I reckon. And there is
  such a thing as honor."</p>

  <p>"Honor!" Doris stared at him. "Do you mean to tell me there is any honor
  in throwing away your last dollar? I wonder," she said, "whether you've got
  enough to cover this check! Have you gone over your account, Bill, since you
  started this&mdash;this orgy of honor? You <i>can't</i> have this much
  left!"</p>

  <p>Bill flushed, then paled slowly.</p>

  <p>"So you think I'd give you a bad check?" His own voice shook slightly. "Do
  you think that? When I've given you all of myself, and let this mine go to
  hell because I couldn't be away from you, and you wanted to be where you
  could dazzle and be dazzled&mdash;do you think, when the whole thing smashes,
  I'd give you a bad check for your stock? You can give that check back to me,
  Doris." His eyes burned into hers. "As soon as mail can travel to Frisco and
  back, I'll have the money for you. Or place it on deposit for you at the
  Hibernian&mdash;if you can trust the bank's word when you get it! Since the
  committee called here at the house, I've been writing checks. There hasn't
  been a drunken Bohunk that asked if my check was good! Parowan has mopped
  them up and been glad to get them. It remains for my <i>wife</i> to question
  my honesty!"</p>

  <p>He picked up his hat and left the house again, going back into the town.
  His nerves were raw, his pride had been seared over and over by the open
  distrust of men who had grown prosperous in the town he had created. He
  wanted sympathy, Doris' arms around his neck, her indignant condemnation of
  the thieves who had after all wrecked the mine. He had thought that Doris
  would understand his reasons for doing what he had done. He had believed that
  her own pride would demand that they stand back of Parowan with their last
  dollar.</p>

  <p>He sent a long code telegram to Baker Cole, and one to his bank. Then,
  with hell still in his heart, he walked up the other slope, across the gulch,
  and entered the tent (now boarded and roofed and floored, but otherwise not
  changed) where he felt that he could at least call himself at home.</p>

  <p>Luella, banished since the fateful party that had set the gossips talking,
  greeted him with hysterical chatter. Hez poked a cold nose ingratiatingly
  into his palm. Even Sister Mitchell, long ago retrieved from her winter
  quarters under a rock by the cellar, crawled from under the stove and craned
  her long neck at him, begging for something green. Bill looked in the
  cupboard and found nothing eatable. He had been away too long, he remembered
  now. He had lost count of the time, so completely had his mind been given to
  meet a humiliating situation in such a way that he need never be ashamed to
  look any man in the face.</p>

  <p>Well, his menagerie was hungry and begging for food. He went out again,
  hurried to the nearest grocery and bought what he wanted, careless of the
  curious looks he excited. He stopped at Tommy's Place and told Tommy that he
  wouldn't be needed, close-herding anybody. The auditor had reported to Bill
  that he could find nothing wrong with the books, and there was not much
  chance of getting hold of any actual proof of crookedness against either
  Rayfield or Emmett.</p>

  <p>"And are yuh still buyin' Parowan stock, Mr. Dale?" Tommy's soft voice was
  softer, more plaintive than ever.</p>

  <p>"As long as there's a share out, I'm in the market," Bill answered
  shortly&mdash;defiantly too, though there was no reason for defiance.</p>

  <p>He returned to his camp and fed Sister Mitchell her lettuce, Luella a
  cookie, and flung a stale mutton chop outside the door for Hez. He did not
  cook anything for himself. He was too heartsick to think of food. The whole
  damnable robbery, the treachery,&mdash;and then, Doris!</p>

  <p>He tried to recall what words had passed between them; to remember just
  what Doris had said. But then he knew that it was not the words; she had not
  actually said anything awful, he suspected. But her tones, the hard,
  condemning look in her eyes! He could see her again, trembling with anger
  because he was spending money to keep his name&mdash;and hers&mdash;above
  reproach among men. In all the time since they were married, Bill had never
  seen Doris like that. The months had not been altogether peaceful, to be
  sure. Doris had frequently found something in her husband that required
  correcting, had enumerated his faults to him many, many times. She had often
  hurt Bill, had made him angry, so that he would go away until he forgot it.
  But there had been nothing like this.</p>

  <p>"Damn money, if that's what it does to people!" Bill groaned aloud, when
  Luella recalled him to his surroundings by crying, "Give us a light! Give us
  a light!" He lighted a lantern and hung it from the hook on the ridgepole,
  and for a long while he stood staring at the cased saxophone.</p>

  <p>Only two years ago he had dreamed of learning to play that thing,&mdash;to
  forward his wooing of Doris!</p>

  <p>"I didn't need music," he told himself bitterly, all her hysteria over
  money and luxury flooding his mind with a nauseating enlightenment. "She took
  me, quick enough, when she saw the gold! Money, money! That's all she has
  thought of, from the day I showed her the vein. Little peacock, strutting
  around, showing off her finery. What a blind fool a man can be. And it had to
  wind up this way. She took money from me for her stock&mdash;thinking it was
  my last dollar. Afraid my account wouldn't cover it! If she thinks I'm that
  near broke, why did she take that check? Sell out, just like all the rest,
  because Parowan's on the rocks and the stock's not worth a damn, and she
  stood to lose something if she didn't unload quick. So she
  unloaded&mdash;five dollars a share because I offered it&mdash;to <i>me</i>!
  Her own husband, the man who gave her the claim that put her in the Company
  to begin with.</p>

  <p>"What has she ever done to help? What's she doing now? Looking after her
  own little dollar pile&mdash;that's what. And she didn't <i>need</i> it! I
  gave her half a million in bonds, last Christmas. My God, even Rayfield
  wouldn't have done what she did to-night! And the way she's treated her
  folks. That shows the stuff she's made of. I don't blame Don for turning me
  down every time I tried to do something for him. They're proud&mdash;the
  right kind of pride. They're proud to make their own way. But
  Doris&mdash;neglecting them and not wanting them in California for a
  visit&mdash;excuses, the thinnest kind of excuses. Ashamed to have them at
  the hotels, that was why. She couldn't bear the thought of leading her pudgy
  old mother and her big, awkward dad into the dining room to her table! Afraid
  they might eat their salad with the fork dedicated to fish! Old Don might
  possibly put his soup spoon into his mouth front end forward! Snob!
  Cold-blooded, heartless little snob!"</p>

  <p>So he railed at her, lashing his anger with the memory of her foolishness.
  But when he thought of baby Mary, his heart failed him. Beginning to toddle
  now, she was. And squinting her nose at him and laughing, and hiding her head
  in a cushion when he went down on his hands and knees and boo-ooed at her.
  Holding out her little arms to him and pleading "Take!" when the nurse came
  to carry her off to bed.</p>

  <p>She must be in her little white nightgown now, with pink toes wriggling,
  little white teeth flashing when she laughed. He wondered, hungrily, if she
  missed her daddy,&mdash;wanted him to come and play
  little-pigs-going-to-market.</p>

  <p>Bill couldn't stand it. He put on his hat and went out, locking the gate
  after him and steeling himself against Luella's protestations. He would go
  back to the big house on the hill. He couldn't leave his baby girl to go
  "bye-bye" without kissing her daddy good night.</p>

  <p>But when he had walked to where the house stood revealed to him, bold
  against the starry sky, his steps slowed, faltered, stopped altogether. All
  the big rooms were lighted brilliantly, as if there were a party in the
  house. He knew the look,&mdash;having had his fill of that mockery of
  hospitality which Doris called entertaining. It would be like her, he told
  himself between clenched teeth. With Parowan fortunes sliding into the abyss
  of cataclysmic failure, it would be like Doris to throw wide her doors to
  merrymaking, to fling her defiance into the face of the town over which
  disaster hovered vulturelike, waiting to feed upon the broken fortunes left
  in the wake of the boom.</p>

  <p>He looked for what seemed a long while at the window upstairs, where a dim
  light was burning in the corner room. He knew well the meaning of that light
  also. It meant that baby Mary was in her bed, tucked in by the nurse, while
  her mother laughed and talked and "entertained" in the drawing-rooms
  below.</p>

  <p>Bill muttered a great oath, turned and went back to his dingy little
  board-and-canvas camp.</p>

     name="ch23">XXIII. &mdash; BILL IS BACK WHERE HE STARTED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BILL bought Parowan stock. When he saw that the price he had
  named was holding back many sales, that many a stockholder suspected a shrewd
  motive in his buying and held on in the hope of riding another high wave of
  frenzied finance, Bill gave a snort and sent another bulletin out from
  Parowan headquarters. He would buy Parowan stock at one-fifty.</p>

  <p>That day he wrote checks, an unpleasant curl of the lip betraying his
  consciousness of his wife, of the look in her eyes, of the hard bitterness of
  her tones because he was spending money on something other than her whims.
  His anger held and hardened with the congealing quality of his contempt for
  her selfishness, her cold-blooded acquisitiveness. He felt that the greatest
  ease he could know was never to see Doris again so long as he lived.</p>

  <p>Wherefore, he did not go home. But Doris called him on the telephone, just
  before noon.</p>

  <p>"Bill, are you going to be home for luncheon?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"When <i>are</i> you coming, then? Don't you realize what people will be
  saying? I should think you might have some little consideration for
  <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>"I can trust you to attend to that matter," Bill replied evenly. "I have
  never yet known you to fail. When I hear from San Francisco I shall let you
  know. I wired last evening, and should hear to-day or to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Bill Dale, you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Certainly. Good-by." Bill hung up and turned back unemotionally to
  his work. His lawyer, who sat within three feet of him, believed that Bill
  was speaking to a client, or an employee of some kind.</p>

  <p>The next day, Parowan Consolidated dropped to one dollar, and people were
  selling by wire,&mdash;and Bill was buying. He was appalled at the amount of
  stock which had been placed on the market and sold at boom prices. The
  incorporation had been for two million shares. There had been two million,
  seven hundred thousand shares issued. The auditor had discovered that for
  Bill.</p>

  <p>Bill had a happy half-hour, thinking that he had "got the goods" on
  Rayfield and Emmett. But Fuller, the attorney, dug into the records and
  discovered just when and where and how the capital stock had been increased
  nearly one million shares. Bill called to mind the times when he had been
  asked, just as he put on his hat to leave after some brief visit to the
  office, "Oh, just sign up these minutes, Mr. President. Catch you while I
  can, is the only way I can get at you!" And Bill, knowing that Doris was
  waiting for him, had signed minutes, documents, stock and check books
  hastily, without giving the time he should have devoted to the reading. So
  the capital stock had been increased with his official sanction, but without
  his knowledge. There was nothing that he could say, nothing that he could do.
  An officer of a corporation is supposed to know the official acts of his
  organization.</p>

  <p>Well, he had himself to blame, if there were more Parowan stock floating
  around than he had any idea of. He was prepared to buy every share that he
  himself did not hold,&mdash;and Doris. He had counted on Doris standing at
  his shoulder, since she had more than half a million in her own right and
  could never want for money unless she deliberately squandered it. Now, when
  he should be nearing the end of his buying, he found himself far from the
  goal.</p>

  <p>He went out and wired again to Baker Cole&mdash;an urgent call to
  liquidate at once all his holdings in the big Baker-Cole oil
  interests&mdash;and to place the money at his disposal in the Hibernian.</p>

  <p>Then he went back to the office and continued to buy Parowan at one
  dollar. More stock was coming in. The gamblers, having no inside
  information&mdash;though they tried hard enough to get hold of it&mdash;lost
  their nerve and began to let go. But not fast enough for Bill, who was
  impatient to be through with the thing.</p>

  <p>Parowan dropped to ninety, the new price being sent out imperturbably from
  Bill's office. More stock came in. The papers were full of the crash, full of
  wild rumors of the cause, full of Bill Dale's insane buying&mdash;or was it
  insane? Certainly, it was sensational. No stockholder could possibly remain
  in ignorance of the facts, the worst of the rumors concerning Bill and the
  mine.</p>

  <p>"Sell! Sell!" Every one was crying it. Sell before Bill Dale goes broke or
  quits buying because he has enough. They sold frantically. After Bill had
  bought so much, the most credulous old woman who held ten shares could not
  fail to see that she was hopelessly in the minority; that she would never get
  one dime for Parowan, unless Bill Dale willed that she should.</p>

  <p>So it went on for a week. At the end of that time, the silence was broken
  between Bill and Doris. One evening, in a cape borrowed from her maid, Doris
  visited Bill at his camp.</p>

  <p>Bill thought that it was Tommy, until Doris had closed the rough door
  behind her and stood there looking around the crude little place with its
  canvas walls and roof (inside, the room was still nearly all canvas) and at
  Bill hunkered down before the cookstove, blowing up his fire. She stood
  looking at him in silence. Perhaps she remembered that other night when she
  had cried, "Bill! Bill Dale! Let me in!" Perhaps she remembered the light in
  Bill's eyes then, the happy quiver of his lips which he could not hold from
  smiling just because she was there&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh, hello," he greeted involuntarily when she did not speak. "I thought
  it was Tommy." He stood up, looking down at her. There was no light in his
  eyes now. His lips were pressed together in a straight line, and he waited
  guardedly for her to speak first. She came up and held her ringed hands over
  the stove, for the night was cool. Perhaps, too, she wanted to be near him,
  to watch his face.</p>

  <p>"Well, Bill, since I am to be left a widow," she said lightly, "I'm going
  back to the Coast. Well, of course, I'm joking about the widow&mdash;though
  I'm sure I don't know what folks are saying about you not being home for
  days. I never saw such an ugly temper as you've got. I came to say that I'm
  leaving for Santa Barbara to-morrow. I want to be early so as to get a good
  suite before the crowd arrives. I suppose you'll at least help me get there
  and get settled?"</p>

  <p>Bill smiled darkly. "Any girl that's able to sling a pack on a horse and
  get out on this desert alone, and think nothing of it," he said, "ought to be
  able to take a train ride alone&mdash;with two hired women to wait on
  her."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean you won't go?"</p>

  <p>"I mean, I won't leave here. I might convoy you to your pet hotel, if
  you'll wait till I have time. But if you want to go now, you'll have to go
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Bill, sometimes I think I <i>hate</i> you!"</p>

  <p>"Never mind. That'll soon settle into a fixed habit&mdash;soon as I'm
  broke."</p>

  <p>"You're the most stubborn man I ever saw in my life. No one knows what I
  have endured from you. Everything must be your way&mdash;nothing that I say
  or do is worth your consideration. You never would listen to me&mdash;I know
  now that you must have been making money on the side, that you never told me
  about. If you hadn't you never could have acted the fool and kept it up the
  way you have, buying in worthless stock."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> didn't find it worthless," Bill could not refrain from
  reminding her. "You made a good thing out of yours, don't you think? There's
  not a man in the country can call Parowan stock worthless. What are
  <i>you</i> kicking about?"</p>

  <p>Doris looked him over scornfully. "What a fool you are!" she said.
  "Beggaring yourself just so you may have the satisfaction of saying that
  Parowan stock is worth par."</p>

  <p>"Ninety cents," Bill corrected her calmly. "I dropped it a bit
  to-day&mdash;shaking loose a few that have been hanging on."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Doris, "you consider it a great achievement, buying up
  Parowan. Cornering a worn-out mine!"</p>

  <p>Bill reached for the coffeepot, measured out coffee and poured in water
  from a dented tea-kettle. He was sick of fruitless argument with Doris. She
  was as she was made, he told himself resignedly. Some persons are unable by
  nature to see beyond a dollar, and Doris, he considered, was one of them.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever thought of me, in this performance of yours?" she cried,
  stung by his silence. "I am your wife. What right had you to throw away money
  the way you have done, without even asking me what I thought about it?
  Throwing away&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You aren't worrying about your hotel bill, are you? I believe you still
  have a few nickels left. You ought to make out&mdash;for awhile, anyway. I
  can land a job, maybe, after this blows over."</p>

  <p>"A job! You'll land in the insane asylum, if you keep on. I wish I'd never
  seen you, Bill Dale!"</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Bill, looking up from slicing bacon, "you'd still be
  punchin' cows for your dad, most likely."</p>

  <p>Doris gave him one furious glare and swept past him. "I hate the ground
  you walk on!" she cried. "I hope I never see you again, as long as I
  live!"</p>

  <p>Bill went on slicing bacon, even after he had heard the gate slam. When he
  came to himself, he had sliced enough for ten hungry men.</p>

  <p>"You won't, if I can help it," he said tardily; so tardily that Doris was
  probably at home by that time.</p>

  <p>But nothing is immutable save the Law, and Bill was up at the big house,
  the next day, attending to the small details of departure. Baby Mary was in
  his arms, bonneted and ready to go, a full hour before the train left. Bill
  wondered dully how he was ever going to loosen his clasp of her warm little
  body and let her go with Doris,&mdash;out of his life, since the break
  between him and her mother was irrevocable.</p>

  <p>He wondered if Doris would divorce him. But he would have bitten his
  tongue in two before he would ask. She was keeping up the pretense, speaking
  to him pleasantly when a servant was within hearing, ignoring his presence
  when they chanced to be alone.</p>

  <p>At the depot, whither he accompanied them, still carrying little Mary in
  his arms, Doris chatted lightly of trivial things and smiled frequently at
  Bill. The eyes of Parowan were upon them, and Doris would give them nothing
  more to roll under their tongues.</p>

  <p>"I wired for reservations at the hotel," Bill told her, as he was helping
  her on the train. "I asked for our old suite back, if possible. Thought you'd
  like it."</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd get one in the other wing," Doris answered perversely. "But
  that's all right, dear. Well, I'll write immediately, of course. Good-by,
  dear!"</p>

  <p>Bill hugged little Mary to him, gave her one kiss and put her in her
  nurse's arms. The last he heard was the baby's voice screaming, "Daddy,
  <i>take</i>!"</p>

  <p>He went back to the office and bought Parowan stock with a fierce
  eagerness that made Fuller, the attorney, look at him queerly.</p>

  <p>Before the week was out, Parowan Consolidated was dissolved and Bill was
  watching the last of the town's inhabitants leaving on the trail down the
  mountain side, and by train. The boom was "busted." From the Bill Dale
  mansion on the hill to the meanest shack perched on the edge of the gulch,
  the houses of Parowan stood empty. Bill had not lied to them. He had told
  them that there would be nothing for them in the town. He had advised
  anxious-eyed storekeepers to get out while they could, carry their stock to
  some other town and sell it or open another store. They had taken his advice.
  The exodus, while orderly, had been complete.</p>

  <p>One little store, the one nearest Bill's camp, remained much as it had
  been when Bill made his last purchases there. The storekeeper had a wife and
  a lot of children, and he had wanted to get out on a ranch that he owned near
  Reno. He was sick of business. He tried to sell, and nobody would buy. They
  had enough on their hands, getting out with their own goods, and landing
  business. They needed all their cash, and more too, they said. So Bill,
  hearing it all while he purchased coffee and a pound of butter and a few cans
  of milk, set down his packages and bought the man out. Not that he was trying
  to see how much money he could spend, but because he would need supplies and
  he thought that this was the cheapest way to stock up.</p>

  <p>One night, then, Bill sat down to his supper in the tent-shack and told
  Luella and Hez that they had the place to themselves. Parowan, as a town, was
  a thing of the past. That day, the train had made its last trip into the
  deserted camp. Its sole freight consisted of six cases of wine and whisky for
  Tommy's place&mdash;a consignment delayed somewhere in transit.</p>

  <p>"What are <i>you</i> kicking about?" Luella inquired sharply.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Bill stubbornly. "Nothing at all."</p>

  <p>Tommy came in, peering through his glasses at Bill. He grinned, setting
  his lantern down on the table.</p>

  <p>"The ghosts'll be out this night, I'm thinkin', Mr. Dale," he observed
  slily. "I've been all over the town, an' here's the only stovepipe that's
  smokin' t'night. Not mine&mdash;I thought mebby yuh might ast me t' eat wit'
  yuh, an' so I cooked nawthin' fer m'self."</p>

  <p>Bill nodded and got another cup and plate. "I thought you went to-day," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Me? Wit' the stock I've bought an' the stock I've helt befoor, I've a
  right t' stay wit' my investment."</p>

  <p>Bill studied him. "So it's you has been holding out on Parowan!" He
  laughed shortly not quite pleased. "Well, you'd better fork over, Tommy. I'll
  buy your stock. You know, don't you, that the Company's dissolved&mdash;there
  <i>ain't</i> no more Parowan Consolidated. What's left of the mine belongs to
  Bill Dale. Right where it began, it finishes. How much have you got?" Almost
  mechanically he reached for his fountain pen. The thought struck him that
  now, at last, he might not be able to buy Tommy out for any decent price. He
  might not have money enough. As poor as when he had followed his burros into
  Goldfield was Bill. But he had his mine; he had his self-respect.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sellin' Parowan stock," said Tommy stiffly. "When I seen you was
  buyin', I bought from them that come in the s'loon an' talkin'. If they's no
  Company left, I can thank Gawd fer that. An' we'll own the mine, the two of
  us. Fer I have no wish t' sell, Mr. Dale. Phwat's good enough fer you that
  found it, sh'd be good enough fer me. I'm keepin' my share. An' I'm thinkin'
  we'll find the ore, Mr. Dale, spite o' the experts that says it's gone. 'Tis
  not gone s' far but we can find it&mdash;you an' me worrkin'
  t'gether&mdash;though phwat yer plan is I dunno&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bill gulped. His eyes shone wet between his lashes, though he tried to
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"You bought&mdash;because I bought. Tommy, you're the biggest damn fool in
  Nevada. You ought to be shot."</p>

  <p>"Yiss," said Tommy, and blinked at him. "But not fer quittin' a friend,
  Mr. Dale. The durrty houn's that came an' fed from yer hand, an' when yuh had
  no more for them, they streaked it outa town an' left yuh holdin' the
  sack&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw, shut up!" Bill's tone was gruff. "This may not be O'Hara cooking,
  but&mdash;fill your plate. I'll do my killing in the morning."</p>

  <p>"Yuh will not&mdash;Bill." And Tommy pulled up a box, threw his hat into a
  corner and snickered happily over his supper.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">XXIV. &mdash; THE TOWN THAT WAS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EVERY day after that Bill would go up to the mine, Tommy and
  Hez shambling along at his heels. First of all, Bill must examine the
  workings closely to see where and why the vein first showed signs of
  "petering out." He knew that rich veins are tricky, that they seldom hold up
  under mining. Either the values drop as the ore body increases in volume, or
  the vein will pinch out, perhaps never to be rediscovered. He had to know
  just what had been done, what formations had been cut, just how the vein had
  dipped into the hill.</p>

  <p>He took his time, and his work was simplified because the workings were
  not really extensive. It sickened him to see how they had gutted the rich
  vein and passed up tiny stringers that might lead to other rich deposits. So
  far as he could determine, Rayfield had not attempted to explore the further
  resources of the mine. He had taken what was in sight, easy to mine, and had
  neglected the development of other possible veins.</p>

  <p>Well, he had probably been frightened off with Al Freeman's story and had
  proceeded to rake in as much loot as possible before the crash came. All the
  better for Bill, if he could pick up the vein again, or locate further
  deposits. It would be slow, with only two pairs of hands for the work. Bill
  could not even keep the compressor going, so that they could use the air
  drills.</p>

  <p>"It's the hand-drilling for us, Tommy," he decided, one night while they
  planned. "I can't afford to run that machinery&mdash;that's flat. I'm broke,
  so far as working men and machinery are concerned. I want you to know it
  before I start in. I've got less than a thousand dollars in the bank. I could
  borrow&mdash;I've a friend in California that would come in here and open
  things wide up, and like the fun of it. He doesn't know how rich he is;
  doesn't care. Never saw the bottom of his dollar pile, anyway.</p>

  <p>"But the truth of the matter is, I want to do this alone. If it takes the
  rest of my life, I mean to stick here and find that ore. I mean to bring
  Parowan to the front again. That's why I bought everything up and spent
  practically my last dollar to do it. But you don't have to stick. It isn't
  <i>your</i> pride that was ground under their heels. If I hadn't been
  able&mdash;well, that doesn't matter, now. But thank the Lord my money held
  out! They can call me crazy, but they can't say I'm a quitter."</p>

  <p>"They can not. An' Tommy'll be right here when the boom comes
  back&mdash;make no mistake, Bill. The furrst place of business will be
  Tommy's Place&mdash;an' I'm keepin' it swep' out an' the glasses wiped, agin
  that day when we strike ore. I am, that."</p>

  <p>Bill did not answer. He was thinking of one other place that was swept and
  dusted regularly every Sunday. Not because he had any hope that Doris would
  live in it, nor because of any desire, even. It troubled him now and then to
  think how his heart was hardening toward Doris. Perhaps he did it for baby
  Mary; because he had built her a home. She wouldn't remember&mdash;but some
  day, when she was a woman, she could come back and see her little crib, up in
  the corner bedroom. A scuffed pair of shoes left in a drawer. A broken,
  rubber doll with the whistle torn out. And she would know that she had crept
  over these floors, had slept under this roof; that this had been her
  home.</p>

  <p>Never once did it occur to Bill that he could sell the furnishings of the
  house for enough money to hire miners, run his machinery, expedite his work
  in a dozen different ways. He would have fought the man who suggested such a
  thing.</p>

  <p>He would walk through the room&mdash;wearing rich-man's shoes so that the
  floors would not be marred&mdash;and dream of the baby, trying all the while
  to shut Doris out of his mind. She had not seemed like <i>his</i> Doris, this
  proud young woman who rustled her silken gowns through the house, flashed her
  jewels and spoke imperiously to her servants. No, that was not the Doris he
  had loved. His Doris had been tanned and frank of eye and of speech. She had
  been lithe and competent, and looked life honestly in the face. His heart was
  very empty, sometimes, very hungry for that Doris whom he had loved. He even
  caught himself dreaming about her, now and then,&mdash;almost forgetting the
  other Doris who had kissed him good-by because others were watching and would
  gossip if the parting seemed too cold. A Judas kiss, it had seemed to Bill.
  He tried to forget it, lest his hatred grow against her.</p>

  <p>Every Sunday, Tommy would sweep and dust and polish,&mdash;and dream,
  perchance, some hidden little dream of his own. Bill would disappear for
  hours, coming in after sunset with tired eyes and with lines beside his
  mouth. And neither would speak of how the time had been spent.</p>

  <p>But the rest of Parowan was given over to the winds of the desert spaces.
  Doors began to sag, windows rattled. When the wind blew strong, corrugated
  iron roof would hammer like anvil blows. Old papers swept through the streets
  to lodge ghostlike in the corners. It was a place of desolation, watched over
  proudly by the big house on the hill, with its sheeted furniture and its big,
  plate-glass windows that looked and looked, and framed no face but Bill's,
  staring out through them moodily upon the town and the desert beyond.</p>

  <p>For a time there had been a certain somber activity about the camp,
  daytimes. Men hauled away salvage where ownership could be proved to Bill's
  satisfaction,&mdash;and Bill was hard to satisfy, these days. Precious time
  was lost from their mine while he and Tommy guarded against looting. For
  practically all of Parowan belonged to Bill Dale, and he was showing himself
  hard, grasping, suspicious, a man who carried a gun for the first time in
  years, and who would shoot, give him provocation.</p>

  <p>A railroad gang appeared&mdash;with flat cars and their
  cookhouse&mdash;and took up the rails, leaving the ties on the roadbed.
  Twenty miles away, running past the Hunter ranch with a flag station at his
  largest spring, the railroad still continued to give service of a sort
  between Los Angeles and Tonopah. But Parowan was wiped disdainfully off its
  map. It became a speck, away out on the southern slope of the
  mountain,&mdash;too far away to tempt the idly curious, especially with Bill
  Dale, said to be "a little off," resenting prowlers in the town that was; too
  dead to bring the meanest man there for gain. In this fashion was Parowan set
  apart from other decadent mining camps. Loot&mdash;men prowling through the
  buildings looking for whatever might be carried off&mdash;Parowan was saved
  that indignity. The big house on the hill must have been a temptation; but no
  one quite wanted to risk it. The general opinion was that Bill lived in the
  house, and spent much of his time watching the town.</p>

  <p>This opinion was strengthened by the fact that Bill did come down from the
  big house, one Sunday, and drive a looting party out of town with the silent
  ferocity of a jungle tiger. They did not come back. Bill had emptied his
  six-shooter after them, furrowing the dirt just behind their heels. It was
  close shooting. They took the hint.</p>

  <p>For awhile, Bill and Tommy occupied themselves with packing the best
  railroad ties up to the mine, using Wise One and Angelface&mdash;and the two
  other burros which Bill had bought, and which had been called whatever came
  handiest&mdash;principally epithets coined for the occasion. The ties made
  splendid mine timbers. They were preparing for a long siege.</p>

  <p>Fall chilled to winter. Sister Mitchell disappeared, and Bill began to
  hunt mittens for Tommy and himself. They had all the supplies they would need
  for a long, long time. The little store had catered to miners and carried a
  well-balanced stock of general supplies, ranging from needles and thread and
  candy and gum, to picks and overalls and shoes. And in the shed behind was a
  full ton of grain. The burros would not suffer in the work before them. For
  the burros, too, would have to help.</p>

  <p>Bill rigged a sweep arrangement which miners call a whim. It was the duty
  of the burros to walk round and round in a circle, and hoist the muck, when
  the two men settled down to their mining. They didn't like it, but they did
  like their pint of rolled barley at the end of the shift, so that even the
  burros became resigned to their labor; so resigned that they would walk of
  their own accord into their places, ready to be harnessed to the whim.</p>

  <p>One evening, when Tommy failed to show up after supper, Bill unhooked the
  saxophone case from its nail in the ridgepole and took out the instrument,
  fitting it together tentatively as if he were not at all sure that he would
  want to play it or do more than look it over. That first winter on the Coast,
  before his dreams had died of starvation, Bill had yielded to temptation and
  arranged for lessons on the saxophone. A Sunday advertisement had given him
  the idea, and Bill had worked hard, practising for two hours a day at a
  studio under the tutelage of a stern but thorough teacher. That was before he
  awoke to the fact that saxophones were not for the elect, and that Doris
  declined to agree with him that it would be nice if they could play things
  together.</p>

  <p>The valves were stiff, to begin with. Bill oiled them carefully and tried
  out his fingering. Swinging a single-jack, he discovered, did not tend to
  increase the flexibility of the fingers, but not all his patient work in the
  studio was lost. He wiped the mouthpiece absently, adjusted the reed to his
  liking and began to play, while Luella screamed at him hysterically.</p>

  <p>"Fer Gawd sake, Bill!" she implored, just as Tommy came panting into the
  yard, having run all the way from his saloon.</p>

  <p>"Don't <i>you</i> start in," Bill warned, looking up under his eyebrows at
  Tommy while he went down to low C and lingered there heartrendingly,
  finishing "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep" to his own satisfaction, at
  least.</p>

  <p>"Fer Gaw-wd <i>sake</i>!" Tommy breathed in an awed half-whisper.
  "There'll be no pinochle this night, Bill Dale. Yuh'll be playin'
  music&mdash;an' it hits the spot&mdash;it does that!" He did not mention what
  spot, and Bill did not ask.</p>

  <p>To Bill, the saxophone marked a milestone in his troubles. He could play
  it and enjoy himself without thinking too bitterly of Doris. But he never
  explained to himself why it was that he stuck to the things he had learned in
  San Francisco; why it was that he never played "Love's Old Sweet Song."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">XXV. &mdash; HOPELESS BILL DALE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CHRISTMAS came, by the big calendar that hung on the wall of
  Tommy's Place. It did not come in the heart of Bill Dale. Don Hunter, riding
  thoughtfully to dead Parowan, begged Bill to come and spend the holiday at
  the ranch. Mother Hunter, he said, had made fresh mincemeat and was fattening
  a turkey, and she'd feel hurt if Bill didn't show up to help celebrate.</p>

  <p>Bill was standing by the whim, watching Tommy unhitch the burros from the
  sweeps. Bill's face was grimed, his shoulders drooped a bit. He had put in
  five long holes since noon, and the rock was hard. His eyes went down to the
  empty roofs of Parowan that was; wandered farther, to where the big house
  stood staunchly upon its knoll, solid, beautiful,&mdash;but with no smoke
  curling up into the nipping air.</p>

  <p>"Tell her I'm sorry, Don. I can't&mdash;keep Christmas." He swung away and
  went down the trail, biting his lip, fighting the hot surge of rebellious
  thoughts. Christmas! Good God, did they think he was made of stone? Did they
  think, because he wouldn't whine like a beaten dog&mdash;did they think it
  meant so little to him&mdash;all this desolation?</p>

  <p>"Dead&mdash;inside and out," he muttered fiercely. "And they think I can
  eat turkey and mince pie and call it&mdash;Christmas!"</p>

  <p>Behind him, hazing the burros, Tommy was talking plaintively to Don.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't urrge 'im, Mr. Hunter. He worrks like tin men, he does. An' he
  eats hearty, an' he plays pinochle wit' me of an evenin'. He's havin' 'is
  joke wit' me an' the burrd an' the dorg&mdash;but I've eyes in me head, Mr.
  Hunter. The heart of 'im's weepin' tears of blood whilst the lips of 'em's
  laughin' belike. It shows in the eyes of 'im. It does that, Mr. Hunter."</p>

  <p>There was no Christmas in Parowan, then. On that day Bill worked harder
  than ever, and mortared and panned some pieces of quartz that seemed "likely
  looking rock." He got colors in the pan and professed to be very much
  encouraged, he talked about formations and ore deposits and bedding planes,
  on Christmas night, until Tommy fell asleep in his chair and dropped his
  pipe, breaking the mouthpiece.</p>

  <p>"I'll make you a bargain, Tommy," Bill said then, his eyes brighter than
  they should be, "We'll go over to my store, and you can pick out the best
  pipe there. And then, if you're human, you'll invite me into your 'Place' and
  set 'em up. I'd like to get drunk&mdash;stony, blind drunk. But I don't think
  I shall, because I want to put in a thundering big day to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Tommy blinked and couldn't find his hat, which was on his head. And Bill
  laughed at him all the way to the store. He laughed, too, when he pushed
  Tommy behind the bar to serve the drinks; made him put on a white apron,
  polish the bar with a towel before and afterwards,&mdash;do the thing in
  style. But neither of them mentioned Christmas.</p>

  <p>After that, Bill went away, still laughing at something funny. He said
  that he was going to bed. But the next morning, when Tommy went over to
  Bill's camp for breakfast, there were Bill's tracks in the fresh-fallen
  snow,&mdash;tracks coming up from across the gulch and turning in at the
  gate. Seeing them there, Tommy blinked again. He knew that it had not snowed
  until dawn was breaking.</p>

  <p>One day, when Tommy was washing the dishes&mdash;Bill taking a turn at the
  blacksmithing&mdash;he came across two letters tucked behind a jar of
  fermenting peaches which should have gone into the discard days ago. Tommy
  pulled out the envelopes, goggled down at them and saw that one was addressed
  to Parowan, Nevada, and that the address had been covered by a red stamped
  notice, "No Such Post Office." Below that was another address&mdash;where the
  Hunters got their mail. The other envelope bore a later date, and was
  addressed in care of D. L. Hunter. Neither envelope had been opened,&mdash;an
  over-sight which caused Tommy some anxiety. He thought it was darned careless
  of Don Hunter to put them up in the cupboard and say nothing about them.</p>

  <p>So, "Here's a coupla letters Mr. Hunter musta brought yuh an' fergot to
  give yuh," he said, the moment Bill stepped inside for a drink.</p>

  <p>Bill took the letters, glanced at them, lifted the lid of the stove and
  thrust them deep into the fire.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">XXVI. &mdash; BILL ACQUIRES A COOK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WE'RE on the right track," said Bill, and gathered up an
  armful of dulled steel to sharpen the next morning, preferring his own little
  forge by the camp for that purpose, and passing by the bigger shop at the
  mill.</p>

  <p>"We are that," Tommy agreed, just as he had agreed every day for the past
  month. "She's talkin' to us, Bill. She's t'rowed out 'er thread uh gold, an'
  says, 'Will yuh folly the t'read, now, byes?' A mont' ago she said
  that&mdash;she did."</p>

  <p>"We're on the trail," Bill repeated mechanically. "It may be a damn long
  one, but it's got to end."</p>

  <p>"It has," said Tommy, bouncing a rock off Wise One's rump. "Ivery trail
  has got an ind to it, Bill&mdash;it has, that."</p>

  <p>Bill walked several paces. "I wonder," he said then.</p>

  <p>"Did yuh leave a fire, Bill, in the stove?" Tommy broke a moody silence.
  "She's smokin' yit."</p>

  <p>"It's Don," Bill said indifferently. "I wish they'd quit worrying over me.
  Hell, you'd think I never spent months in the desert before! I hate to be
  treated like a sick kid," he added querulously.</p>

  <p>"Wit' a fire starrted a'ready, supper'll be quicker got," Tommy observed
  plaintively, and made for the camp. "I'll warrm up the beans an' bile the
  coffee in the time it takes t' tell it," he said.</p>

  <p>Bill went on with his steel and dumped it beside the blacksmith shop. The
  heads of two horses showed over the front gate,&mdash;Don's horses. Bill felt
  a contraction of the throat. He wished they would leave him alone; their
  unspoken loyalty hurt; their sympathy made him writhe. And then, Don might
  bring letters. Bill felt as if he could not bear to see another letter.</p>

  <p>So he walked into the camp&mdash;from which Tommy had fled&mdash;and
  confronted Doris. Bill pushed the door shut behind him and leaned against it,
  not knowing that he did so. He did not speak.</p>

  <p>Doris, in khaki riding skirt and flannel shirt, her hair braided down her
  back, was standing by the table, on which were three plates, three cups. She
  was holding a can of tomatoes in one hand, and with the other she was trying
  to open the can with a dull can-opener.</p>

  <p>"Did the man ever live," she asked, "that kept a decently sharp knife or
  anything on the place?"</p>

  <p>Bill came forward mechanically, took the can from her and opened it. Doris
  stood back and watched him, her breath coming unevenly. Bill's eyes were
  fixed upon the slight task. He did not look up.</p>

  <p>"Everything else is all&mdash;ready," Doris said. "I thought maybe&mdash;I
  thought I'd use up those cold biscuits in a tomato stew. Tommy says he boards
  himself. I&mdash;would you rather have them cold out of the can?"</p>

  <p>Bill looked into her face. His eyes seemed hard and bitter, with those
  hollows beneath.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter? Did your money play out?" His voice was hard,
  too&mdash;though God knows he did not mean to be hard. He was trying so hard
  not to be a fool!</p>

  <p>"Why, no." Doris winced a bit before she straightened her shoulders. "I
  can stew them in just a minute, if you'd rather." She stood waiting his
  decision, the can in her two hands before her. Her own eyes were sparkling,
  but social training helps a lot when one wants to cover emotion deep out of
  sight. "Which?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;any way." Bill turned away to the wash basin, feeling the old,
  baffled bewilderment. He washed his face, caught himself wishing he had
  shaved, swore at himself silently for the craven thought. Doris had chosen to
  come. Let her take him as she found him, or&mdash;not at all. He dried his
  hands carefully, glad of his broken nails. He combed his hair before the
  little, square mirror, spitefully pleased with Tommy's attempt at a
  haircut,&mdash;though his remarks had been biting at the time.</p>

  <p>"Well, how's the social elect?" he asked ironically, unconsciously
  responding to her presence so far that he stood beside his chair until she
  was seated. He never did that for Tommy.</p>

  <p>Doris poured his coffee with the grace he had loved when they were on
  their honeymoon,&mdash;when the coffeepot was silver and the cups toy things
  of china. She held out his chipped enamel cup to him with gracious
  composure.</p>

  <p>"The elect? They're riding and golfing and swimming and bridging, as
  usual." Then, unexpectedly, "I left baby down with mother and daddy. She's
  awfully well&mdash;little monkey; she trots around all over the place."</p>

  <p>Bill set his teeth and kept his composure. In a moment he could risk
  speaking. His voice was so steady that it was brutal.</p>

  <p>"And the maid and the nurse&mdash;are they down there, too?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. They're canned. And that reminds me. Those are peach preserves in
  that jar."</p>

  <p>Bill lifted his head a trifle, so that he could send her a sidelong
  glance. What, in heaven's name, had brought her here, in the dead of winter?
  Wanting him to go back with her, probably. Wanted to dodge the gossiping. But
  he would not ask her. She was here; let her tell her object in coming.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you've heard any news lately," Doris remarked, when Bill
  had declined every dish of food on the table, and was merely pretending to
  drink his coffee. "I heard it just as I was leaving the ranch. Walter and
  John and another man, and that Al Freeman&mdash;the one I shot out of here
  that time, you know&mdash;all had a terrible fight in this other man's
  office, in Goldfield. About money, they said. Walter and the other man were
  shot, and the other two are in jail. They think Walter won't live. I was
  thinking, Bill, maybe you ought to go and see him. He&mdash;they cheated you
  somehow, didn't they? Walter might tell, if you went to him and asked about
  it. I think he'd tell, to get even with John."</p>

  <p>"What's the use?" Bill pushed back his chair. "What's the use of anything?
  Doris, did you make the ride over here to tell me <i>that</i>?"</p>

  <p>Doris also was making a pretense of eating. She pushed back her plate and
  began rolling a bit of bread under her forefinger, patting it carefully into
  a flat little cake. Bill noticed then that she was wearing no rings, save her
  wedding ring and one with a Parowan nugget,&mdash;the first one he found in
  the claim.</p>

  <p>"Why, no. I just happened to think of that. No. What I really came
  for&mdash;well I <i>really</i> came for, was&mdash;well, I thought there was
  no sense in spending money living at a hotel when I have a wonderful home
  here, and&mdash;when the mine needs the money. I don't know whether you need
  any of mine, but I wish you'd take it and use it, Bill. I&mdash;it's a darned
  shame for you to be working like&mdash;like a Bohunk!"</p>

  <p>Bill was studying her fixedly.</p>

  <p>"I was working like a Bohunk when I found the mine in the first place," he
  said. "I guess there's nothing the matter with my back. It can stand up under
  a little more work. I haven't," he said deliberately, "found the ore yet. I
  may never find it. So you may need your money."</p>

  <p>"Our money," corrected Doris, under her breath. "Well, I suppose I can't
  get around it&mdash;you're the stubbornest mule of a man I ever saw in my
  life! I <i>really</i> came to say I've been a beast. I don't see why," she
  cried indignantly, "a man can get rich and make a darned fool of himself, and
  it's all right. But if a <i>woman</i> goes on a perfectly respectable society
  spree, it&mdash;it's <i>something awful</i>!" Her voice broke. "If it had
  been <i>you</i>&mdash;if you'd got drunk and gambled and&mdash;raised Cain
  generally, don't&mdash;don't you suppose I'd have overlooked it when
  you&mdash;so-sobered up and&mdash;wanted to get a fresh start?"</p>

  <p>Bill stared at her.</p>

  <p>"What I <i>really</i> came over for," she said, sniffling a little, "was
  to be w-with you. If you can s-stand it like this, I&mdash;can't. I just
  about went <i>crazy</i>, seeing other women with their husbands
  and&mdash;being around those darned hotels alone, and you here working like a
  dog&mdash;I <i>couldn't sta-and</i> it!"</p>

  <p>"You poor little kid!" Bill whispered against her hair. "You poor little
  kid!" He laughed shakily, holding her close. "Sobered up with an awful head
  on her, I'll bet!"</p>

  <p>That was not what he expected to say, but Bill was never much of a hand to
  express his deeper emotions.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"ANYWAY, I can cook for you and Tommy, I hope!" Doris was,
  as usual, withering in her sarcasm. "If you're <i>determined</i> to grub
  along like this, all right. I'm game for it. I never liked
  cooking&mdash;much. But I can do it. We can move up to the
  house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not till we've struck the ore. Call me stubborn if you want to&mdash;I
  can't help it. I found the ore in the first place, and I'll find it again.
  Without touching a dollar of your money. I can't afford to keep up that big
  house. This is about my limit."</p>

  <p>Doris eyed the limited space, chewing her lip meditatively.</p>

  <p>"It isn't much of a place to bring baby," she said. "She'd have her little
  hands full of slivers, the first thing, off these rough boards. And I can't
  see the sense, Bill-dear. Not when there's the kitchen up there, and the
  breakfast room and maid's room that could be shut off from the rest of the
  house. I'd like to know how it's going to cost more to live there. Do you
  think you boys would <i>eat</i> more in that kitchen than you do here?"</p>

  <p>"Aw, hell! Come on, be a shport!" cried Luella into the silence, evidently
  believing that the two were playing pinochle.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THE winter passed quickly, after that. Bill wondered
  sometimes if there hadn't been some mistake about that honeymoon trip to
  California. This was the kind of honeymoon he had dreamed of, when he dared
  to dream of so remote a bliss. Baby Mary was just a lump of sweetness thrown
  in for good measure; by the way, you should have seen how she took to mining.
  On warm days, Doris and the baby would go up to the mine, little Mary smiling
  back over her daddy's shoulder until they overtook Tommy and the burros, when
  she would insist upon riding burro-back.</p>

  <p>Sometimes she had her way, if one of the burros on shift chanced to be
  Wise One. Luella, of course, would go along, language and all. They would
  have a hot lunch, cooked over the camp fire by Doris, who wore khaki, these
  days, and high-laced boots, and did not look in the least like a lady
  millionaire. Lady millionaires do not as a rule drive two burros round and
  round in a circle, hoisting muck from a mine.</p>

  <p>They were up there&mdash;baby Mary trying her little best to lift a
  single-jack, and wrinkling her nose at Doris, who was busy with the
  burros&mdash;one morning in April. Bill and Tommy were both below, examining
  the effect of their "shots" of the evening before. Parowan was "talkin' to
  'em louder 'n' the noon whistle," according to Tommy, and when Doris received
  the hoisting signal, she answered it and then picked up a double handful of
  rocks, with which to pelt the two burros whom nobody loved. Bill and Tommy
  had not been down underground longer than five minutes. Doris put an
  unexpected sharpness into her tone. The burros broke into a
  trot,&mdash;proving that the load was not muck.</p>

  <p>Bill heaved himself out of the bucket, his eyes dancing.</p>

  <p>"Ever see anything like that before?" he asked triumphantly, holding out a
  piece of rock the size of his fist.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;it's gold, isn't it?" The same old thrill hushed her voice as
  she took the quartz in her hand. Tiny, yellow specks showed here and
  there,&mdash;Parowan gold.</p>

  <p>"Busted right into it!" crowed Bill. "I told you last night I was willing
  to bet we'd get a change this morning. There she is, old girl. Whole face of
  the tunnel in quartz&mdash;gold ore or I'm a Chinaman. It won't be so rich as
  the surface ore was, but it'll be a darn sight more permanent. We trailed her
  close to a hundred feet&mdash;but we sure overhauled her at last!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bill-dear, isn't it simply great! Well, what are you going to do now?
  Organize&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not on your life. The crooks aren't all dead and in jail&mdash;not by any
  means! I'll borrow some money from my wife and put in a crew of men here and
  go to mining!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Doris, "you wouldn't consider selling an interest in the
  mine&mdash;to your wife? You couldn't borrow what's yours, you great, big
  silly!"</p>

  <p>Bill gave the ore to baby Mary, who tried harder than ever to lift the
  single-jack so that she could smash it down on the rock. His eyes strayed
  down the hill to the empty town, with the two-story cement bank standing up
  high above the wooden buildings around it. And the O'Hara House with staring,
  empty windows and no pennant at all.</p>

  <p>"The town'll come back," he said, squatting on his haunches beside Doris
  and beginning to plan and dream again. "I almost wish it wouldn't. This has
  been a great winter, honey. But it's bound to come back. I don't know what
  the darned railroad will do about it," he grinned. "We've swiped most of
  their ties!"</p>

  <p>"That's a hell of a note, ain't it!" cried Luella, and began crawling,
  beak and claws, up Bill's back.</p>
